https://openalex.org/W2100693791,"Photorhabdus luminescens is a symbiont of nematodes and a broad-spectrum insect pathogen. The complete genome sequence of strain TT01 is 5,688,987 base pairs (bp) long and contains 4,839 predicted protein-coding genes. Strikingly, it encodes a large number of adhesins, toxins, hemolysins, proteases and lipases, and contains a wide array of antibiotic synthesizing genes. These proteins are likely to play a role in the elimination of competitors, host colonization, invasion and bioconversion of the insect cadaver, making P. luminescens a promising model for the study of symbiosis and host-pathogen interactions. Comparison with the genomes of related bacteria reveals the acquisition of virulence factors by extensive horizontal transfer and provides clues about the evolution of an insect pathogen. Moreover, newly identified insecticidal proteins may be effective alternatives for the control of insect pests."

Consequently, we have studied the role of the FoxO transcription factors in determining cellular response to paclitaxel. Western blotting revealed that in a panel of nine breast cancer cell lines expression of FoxO1a and FoxO3a correlated with the expression of the pro-apoptotic FoxO target Bim, which was associated with paclitaxel-induced apoptosis. In MCF-7 cells, which were paclitaxel-sensitive, the already high basal levels of FoxO3a and Bim protein increased dramatically after drug treatment, as did Bim mRNA, which correlated with apoptosis induction. This was not observed in MDA-231 cells, which expressed low levels of FoxOs and Bim. Gene reporter experiments demonstrated that in MCF-7 cells maximal induction of Bim promoter was dependent on a FoxO binding site, suggesting that FoxO3a is responsible for the transcriptional up-regulation of Bim. Gene silencing experiments showed that small interference RNA (siRNA) specific for FoxO3a reduced the levels of FoxO3a and Bim protein as well as inhibited apoptosis in paclitaxel-treated MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, siRNA specific for Bim reduced the levels of Bim protein and inhibited apoptosis in paclitaxel-treated MCF-7 cells. This is the first demonstration that up-regulation of FoxO3a by paclitaxel can result in increased levels of Bim mRNA and protein, which can be a direct cause of apoptosis in breast cancer cells.

Breast cancer is one of the most common malignancies affecting women in the western world and arises following the accumulation of a series of somatic changes that serve to increase the rate of cellular proliferation and/or reduce the levels of apoptosis. These changes are often found to involve deregulation of key signal transduction pathways. Signal transduction pathways within the cell transmit the extracellular signals to transcription factors, resulting in changes in gene expression. These changes in gene expression are often cell type-specific and lead to cell growth, differentiation, or apoptosis, thereby regulating normal tissue structure and function. One key signal transduction pathway highly conserved in eukaryotes is the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) 1The abbreviations used are: PI3Kphosphatidylinositol 3-kinasePKBprotein kinase BCKIcyclin-dependent kinase inhibitorPBSphosphate-buffered salineGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenasesiRNAsmall interference RNA. pathway (1.Cantley L.C.

Science. 2002; 296: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4657) Google Scholar). Once a receptor tyrosine kinase has become activated by binding a specific ligand, it becomes autophosphorylated and binds PI3K heterodimers either directly, or indirectly via insulin receptor substrate (IRS) adaptor proteins (1.Cantley L.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4657) Google Scholar, 2.Vanhaesebroeck B. Jones G.E. Allen W.E. Zicha D. Hooshmand-Rad R. Sawyer C. Wells C. Waterfield M.D. Ridley A.J. Nat.

Sci. 1997; 22: 267-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). The interaction between the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K and the receptor brings the catalytic domain (p110 subunit) of PI3K into contact with the plasma membrane, where it is able to phosphorylate its targets. Alternatively, PI3K can be juxtaposed to the plasma membrane via interactions with activated RAS family members. PI3K phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-diphosphate at the 3 position, resulting in the formation of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate. Phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate binds to protein kinase B (PKB) also called AKT, a serine/threonine kinase, via its pleckstrin homology domain and recruits it to the inner surface of the cell membrane where it becomes activated by another pleckstrin homology domain-containing protein, PDK1 (1.Cantley L.C.

PKB phosphorylates a number of key substrates, including glycogen synthase kinase 3β and mammalian target of rapamycin, which is involved in cell growth and translation, and the transcription factor NFκB (1.Cantley L.C.

Genetic studies on the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans identified the DAF16 protein as a key downstream substrate of the insulin/PI3K/PKB signaling pathway, and showed that DAF16 is inactivated by PKB phosphorylation (4.Birkenkamp K.U.

(2003) Science's STKE, http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2003/53/re5.Google Scholar). The mammalian orthologues of the DAF16 protein are the FoxO class of the forkhead family of winged helix transcription factors, FoxO1a, FoxO3a, and FoxO4 (formally known as FKHR, FKHR-L1, and AFX, respectively) (4.Birkenkamp K.U.

(2003) Science's STKE, http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2003/53/re5.Google Scholar). In the absence of growth factor stimulation, FoxOs are localized in the nucleus, where they function as transcription factors. Upon stimulation of the PI3K signaling cascade, FoxOs become phosphorylated by PKB on highly conserved serine and threonine residues (6.Engstrom M. Karlsson R. Jonsson J.I. Exp.

These phosphorylations result in impairment of DNA binding ability and increased binding affinity for the 14-3-3 protein (6.Engstrom M. Karlsson R. Jonsson J.I. Exp.

One key FoxO target gene is the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI) p27Kip1 (10.Medema R. Kops G.J.P.L. Bos J.L. Burgering B.M.T. Nature. 2000; 404: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar, 11.Dijkers P.F. Medema R.H. Pals C. Banerji L. Thomas N.S. Lam E.W. Burgering B.M. Raaijmakers J.A. Lammers J.W. Koenderman L. Coffer P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9138-9148Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar), which serves to inhibit cell cycle progression by inhibiting the kinase activity of cyclin-CDK holoenzymes, thereby reducing cell proliferation. Another important target gene is Bim, a BH3 domain protein that is capable of inducing apoptosis (11.Dijkers P.F. Medema R.H. Pals C. Banerji L. Thomas N.S. Lam E.W. Burgering B.M. Raaijmakers J.A. Lammers J.W. Koenderman L. Coffer P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9138-9148Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 12.Dijkers P.F. Medemadagger R.H. Lammers J.W. Koenderman L. Coffer P.J. Curr.

Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Consequently, activation of the PI3K pathway serves to repress FoxO-mediated growth arrest and apoptosis. However, regulation of FoxO target genes is multifactorial, and therefore other transcription factors and post-translation regulatory events will also influence the final level of protein expression. It has been demonstrated that some promoters lacking the FoxO consensus site are still capable of being activated by FoxOs. Furthermore, there is evidence that FoxOs can interact strongly with other transcription factors such as the estrogen receptor-α (14.Schuur E.R. Loktev A.V. Sharma M. Sun Z. Roth R.A. Weigel R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33554-33560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), suggesting that the FoxOs can also modulate transcription via interaction with other transcription factors (14.Schuur E.R.

These results suggest that changes in gene expression resulting from the FoxO arm of the PI3K/PKB signaling pathway are likely to be cell type-dependent. Interestingly, overexpression of PKB (15.Razzini G. Berrie C.P. Vignati S. Broggini M. Mascetta G. Brancaccio A. Falasca M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1179-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and inactivation of the PI3K/PKB pathway inhibitor, PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome TEN), are frequently observed in breast cancer (16.Lu Y. Lin Y.Z. LaPushin R. Cuevas B. Fang X. Yu S.X. Davies M.A. Khan H. Furui T. Mao M. Zinner R. Hung M.C. Steck P. Siminovitch K. Mills G.B.

Oncol. 2001; 28: 125-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating a potential role for FoxOs in modulating both cell cycle and apoptosis during tumorigenesis and treatment. Typically, treatment of breast cancer involves surgery and chemotherapy using drugs that target the estrogen receptor, such as tamoxifen (18.Ali S. Coombes R.C. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). Although anti-estrogen therapy can be effective in treating estrogen-dependent tumors, some tumors exhibit intrinsic or acquired resistance to these modalities, and alternative treatments are needed (18.Ali S. Coombes R.C. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). Of these, the taxanes are one of the most frequently used classes of drugs, which include paclitaxel and its derivatives (19.Symmans F.W. Drug Resist. Updat. 2001; 4: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 20.Blagosklonny M.V. Fojo T. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 83: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). These drugs act by interacting with the cellular microtubules, and in particular, with the microtubules associated with the spindle apparatus during mitosis (19.Symmans F.W. Drug Resist. Updat. 2001; 4: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 20.Blagosklonny M.V. Fojo T. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 83: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Although the primary cellular targets of the taxanes are microtubules, our understanding of the signal transduction pathways involved in the induction of apoptosis by taxanes in breast cancer cells is not complete. Consequently, we have studied the role of the PI3K/PKB pathway, and chiefly the FoxO family of transcription factors, in mediating the apoptosis and survival of breast cancer cell lines treated with paclitaxel. In this report, we demonstrate that in a drug-sensitive cell line accumulation of hypophosphorylated FoxO3a is responsible for the up-regulation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim, whereas in a less sensitive cell line there is a reduction in hypophosphorylated FoxO3a, and significantly less Bim expression and apoptosis. We also propose that the regulation of FoxO family members by the PI3K/PKB pathway may be of prognostic value in the prediction of paclitaxel sensitivity in breast cancer. Cell Culture—A panel of human breast carcinoma cell lines HMT 3522, MCF-7, 734 B, ZR-75-1, T47-D, CAL-51, CAMA-1, MDA-MB-231, and SKBR-7 were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, in a humidified incubator in an atmosphere of 10% CO2 at 37 °C. Paclitaxel was obtained from Sigma chemical company (Poole Dorset) and dissolved in Me2SO. Transfections and Gene Reporter Assays—Based on the published mouse Bim promoter sequence (21.Bouillet P. Zhang L.C. Huang D.C. Webb G.C. Bottema C.D. Shore P. Eyre H.J. Sutherland G.R. Adams J.M. Mamm. Genome. 2001; 12: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), a 790-bp fragment of the human Bim promoter, containing a single inverse Forkhead box TAAACAC (nucleotide–266/–259 relative to the 3′terminus of the promoter) was amplified from genomic DNA by PCR using the following primers: 5′-AAGCTTCCCGCCCTCACCCGGGA-3′ and 5′-GAGCTCCAACAAACTGCAGACC-3′, cloned in pGEM-T easy vector (Promega, Southampton, UK) and validated by sequencing. The human Bim promoter was then mutated to introduce a single G to C substitution in the core of the Forkhead box (GTAAACAC) by site-directed point mutagenesis using the following primers: 5′-TTACTCCGGTAAAGACGCCAGGGA-3′ and 5′-TCCCTGGCGTCTTTACCGGAGTAA-3′. Subsequently, a double PCR was performed using the human Bim promoter primers described before. The pGL2-hBim and pGL2-mutant hBim plasmids were then created by cloning the respective Klenow-blunted EcoRI promoter fragment into the SmaI-linearized pGL2Basic vector (Promega, UK). MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method as described previously (22.Lam E.W.-F. Watson R.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2705-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Briefly, calcium phosphate precipitates containing 1 μg of wild type Bim promoter firefly-luciferase reporter plasmid (pGL2-hBim) or mutant plasmid (pGL2-mutant-hBim) together with 0.2 μg of a Renilla luciferase transfection control (pRL-TK; Promega) were incubated overnight with subconfluent cell cultures in each well of a 24-well plate. The cells were then washed twice in PBS, treated with paclitaxel, and harvested for firefly/Renilla luciferase assays using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). Apoptosis Determination Using Annexin V Staining—To determine the extent of apoptosis, Annexin V staining was used according to the manufacturer's instructions (R&D Systems). Briefly, paclitaxel-treated cells were trypsinized and washed in PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin, before being stained in fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled annexin V and propidium iodide (R&D Systems). Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACScan (BD Biosciences), and data were processed using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Cell Cycle Analysis—Cell cycle analysis was performed using propidium iodide staining as described previously (23.Williams C.D. Linch D.C. Watts M.J. Thomas N.S. Blood. 1997; 90: 194-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were trypsinized, washed in PBS, then fixed in 90% ethanol. Fixed cells were then washed twice in PBS and stained in 50 μm propidium iodide containing 5 μg/ml DNase-free RNase for 1 h, then analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACScan (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using Cell Quest software (BD Biosciences). Western Blotting—Western blotting was performed on whole cell extracts prepared by lysing cells in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 30 mm Naβ-glycerophosphate, and protease inhibitors (“Complete” protease inhibitor mixture, as instructed by the manufacturer, Roche Applied Science)) on ice for 15 min. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and protein concentration was determined by Bio-Rad Dc protein assay (Bio-Rad). 20 μg of protein was size-fractionated using SDS-PAGE, and electro-transferred onto Protran nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell). Membranes were incubated with specific antibodies recognizing FKHR/FoxO1a (9462s, Cell Signaling Technologies), FKHR/FoxO1a phosphorylated at Ser-253 (9461s, Cell Signaling Technologies), FKHR-L1/FoxO3a (Upstate 06951), FKHR-L1/FOXO3a phosphorylated at Ser-253 (Upstate 06953), BIM (Calbiochem, 202000), and β-tubulin (BD Pharmingen 556321). A mouse monoclonal antibody recognizing human p27Kip1 was generated by Dr. Eric Lam. Primary antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse or anti-rabbit conjugates as appropriate (DAKO), and visualized using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Northern Blotting Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from treated cells using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and quantitated using UV spectrophotometry, and gene expression was analyzed by Northern blotting as detailed previously (22.Lam E.W.-F. Watson R.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2705-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Briefly, 40 μg of RNA was size-fractionated using 1.5% (w/v) formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis. Following electrophoresis, RNA was transferred onto a Hybond N+ nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences) using capillary transfer Northern blotting as described previously (22.Lam E.W.-F. Watson R.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2705-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Bim, p27Kip1, and GAPDH mRNAs were detected using 32P-labeled human cDNA probes described previously (24.Banerji L. Glassford J. Lea N.C. Thomas N.S. Klaus G.G. Lam E.W.-F. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7352-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 25.Dijkers P.F. Birkenkamp K.U. Lam E.W.-F. Thomas N.S. Lammers J.W. Koenderman L. Coffer P.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Real-time Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated as before and DNase I-treated. Equal amounts of total RNA (2 μg) was reverse-transcribed using the Superscript First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen), and the resulting first strand cDNA was diluted and used as template in the real-time quantitative-PCR analysis. All measurements were performed in triplicate. The mRNAs analyzed were Bim and GAPDH, which served as internal control and was used to normalize for variances in input cDNA. The following gene-specific primer pairs were designed using the ABI Primer Express software: GAPDH-sense (5′-ATTTGGTCGTATTGGGCGCCTGGTCACC-3′) and GAPDH-antisense (5′-GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC-3′); Bim-sense (5′-CACAAAACCCCAAGTCCTCCTT-3′) and Bim-antisense (5′-TTCAGCCTGCCTCATGGAA-3′). Specificity of each primer was determined using NCBI BLAST module. Detection of Bim expression was performed with SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems) and an ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems), using the relative standard curve method. Gene Silencing with Small Interfering RNAs—The siRNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Dharmacon Research Inc. (Lafayette, CO). MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in six-well plates until 60% confluent. Cells in 2 ml of culture medium were transfected with 4 μg of annealed oligonucleotides using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen, UK) according to manufacturer's instructions. 24 h after transfection the cells were treated with 10 nm paclitaxel or Me2SO vehicle. After 48 h of treatment, both the suspension and the adherent cells were collected for either Western blot analysis, or Annexin V/propidium iodide staining. The FoxO3a siRNA sequence corresponds to the coding region 46–64 relative to the first nucleotide of the start codon (GenBank™ accession number BC020227) and does not match any other genomic sequence, except for that of the pseudogene FoxO3b in a Blast search from the NCBI website (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). FoxO3a sense 5′-ACUCCGGGUCCAGCUCCAC(dTdT)-3′; FoxO3a antisense 5′-GUGGAGCUGGACCCGGAGU(dTdT)-3′. The Bim siRNA sequence corresponds to the coding region 39–57 relative to the first nucleotide of the start codon of the published the BimEL cDNA (GenBank™ accession number NM_138621). This sequence is present in all known Bim mRNA splice forms, but does not match any other sequence, in the GenBank™. Bim sense 5′-CAAUUGUCUACCUUCUCGG(dTdT)-3′; Bim antisense 5′-CCGAGAAGGUAGACAAUUG(dTdT)-3′; control sense 5′-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGU(dTdT)-3′; and control antisense 5′-ACGUGACACGUUCGGAGAA(dTdT)-3′. Apoptosis Induced by Paclitaxel on a Panel of Breast Carcinoma Cell Lines—To delineate the mechanisms involved in paclitaxel-induced apoptosis in breast cancer, a panel of breast cancer cell lines were treated with 10 nm paclitaxel for 48 h, and the level of apoptosis was measured using annexin V staining. The data shown in Fig. 1A clearly demonstrate that there is extensive heterogeneity in the extent of apoptosis induction in the panel of cell lines. The least paclitaxel-sensitive cell lines were MDA-MB-231 and T47D, which displayed an increase in apoptosis of less than 5%. Intermediate sensitivity (an increase of between 5 and 10%) was observed in the ZR-75-1 and CAL-51 cell lines. The most drug-sensitive cell lines were HMT3552, MCF-7, 734B, CAMA-1, and SKBR-7, which all exhibited increases in apoptosis of greater than 10% following paclitaxel treatment. Consequently, Western blotting experiments were performed to identify differences in expression of potential apoptotic regulators that could explain the heterogeneous apoptotic response. The Protein Expression of FoxO Family Members and FoxO Targets Is Heterogeneous in a Panel of Breast Carcinoma Cell Lines—It has been shown that the FoxO family of transcription factors can induce the pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein Bim in hematopoietic cells, thereby causing cell death (11.Dijkers P.F. Medema R.H. Pals C. Banerji L. Thomas N.S. Lam E.W. Burgering B.M. Raaijmakers J.A. Lammers J.W. Koenderman L. Coffer P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9138-9148Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 25.Dijkers P.F. Birkenkamp K.U. Lam E.W.-F. Thomas N.S. Lammers J.W. Koenderman L. Coffer P.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Furthermore, because the PI3K/PKB pathway is often deregulated in breast cancer (26.Page C. Huang M. Jin X. Cho K. Lilja J. Reynolds R.K. Lin J. Int. J. Oncol. 2000; 17: 23-28PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Perez-Tenorio G. Stal O. Br. J. Cancer. 2002; 86: 540-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), and the FoxO family of transcription factors is subject to inhibitory phosphorylation by PKB, we sought to examine the expression levels of FoxO3a and FoxO1a to determine whether its expression correlated with the levels of apoptosis induced by paclitaxel in a panel of breast cancer cell lines. The expression pattern of total FoxO3a shows that expression is highest in MCF-7 and 734B and T47D, with intermediate levels of expression in HMT3522 and ZR-75-1 (Fig. 1B). The expression of FoxO3a is lowest in CAL-51, CAMA-1, MDA-MB-231, and SKBR-7. In the case of FoxO1a, the levels of total protein and the phosphorylated form are highest in MCF-7 and 734B. The expression levels in the remaining cell lines are much lower. Western blotting experiments demonstrated that the level of the FoxO target p27Kip1 was high in MCF-7, 734B, ZR-75-1, T47D, and CAL-51, with expression in HMT3552, CAMA-1, MDA-MB-231, and SKBR-7 being much lower. The expression of Bim also shows heterogeneity, its expression being high in HMT3552, MCF-7, 734B, and ZR-75-1, and very low in comparison with the remaining cell lines. The expression of β-tubulin was determined as a control for equal loading of the gels, and showed little variation. Taken together, these data suggest that in the MCF-7, 734B, T47D, and ZR-75-1, and to a lesser extent, the HMT3552 cell lines, there is a correlation between the expression of FoxO1a and -3a, and the expression of one or other of the known FoxO targets p27Kip1 and Bim. What is clear from the data is that the high level of expression of Bim in HMT3552, MCF-7, and 734B correlates with the induction of apoptosis by paclitaxel. Conversely, the low levels of Bim expression in T47D and MDA-MB-231 also correlated with the lack of apoptosis induction. The exceptions to this are ZR-75-1, which expresses high levels of Bim, but does not undergo apoptosis readily, and SKBR-7 and CAMA-1, which display high levels of apoptosis despite low levels of Bim, suggesting other mechanisms are responsible for regulating apoptosis in these cells. Paclitaxel Induces Cell Death in a Drug-sensitive Cell Line, but G2/M Arrest in a Less sensitive Cell Line—To investigate in more detail the role of FoxO family members and Bim in paclitaxel-induced apoptosis, we chose to perform further experiments in two cell lines: MCF-7, which expressed high levels of FoxOs and Bim and underwent apoptosis readily, and MDA-MB-231 cells, which expressed low levels of FoxOs and Bim and was refractory to paclitaxel-induced apoptosis. The cell-cycle phase distribution in these two cell lines was measured using flow cytometry of ethanol-fixed propidium iodide-stained cells after treatment with 10 nm paclitaxel. The data shown in Fig. 2 clearly shows that in the MCF-7 cell line there is an increase in the fraction of cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle for the first 24 h of treatment. After 24 h, there was a gradual increase in the number of dead and dying cells containing <2N DNA content. Although the determination of apoptosis in Fig. 1A was made using annexin V staining, we have found that the number of cells in the <2N fraction and the number of annexin V-positive cells are very similar following paclitaxel treatment. These results would suggest that the MCF-7 cells arrest in G2/M phase before death. In contrast, the MDA-MB-231 cells accumulate in the G2/M phase for the first 24 h and then become polyploid but do not undergo extensive cell death. Paclitaxel Induces Increased Protein Expression of FoxO3a, Bim, and p27Kip1 in a Drug-sensitive Breast Cancer Cell Line—To study the role of FoxOs in determining the apoptotic response to paclitaxel in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, we compared the changes in protein expression following treatment with paclitaxel at either 10 or 75 nm. Whole cell protein extracts were prepared 24, 48, and 72 h after drug treatment, which from the previous experiment were the times when apoptosis was initiated (24 h) and then was observed to be maximal (48 and 72 h). The protein expression was then analyzed by Western blotting. The data clearly demonstrated that in both cell lines that there was an increase in the levels of both phospho- and total FoxO1a 48 h after 10 nm paclitaxel treatment (Fig. 3A). Following treatment with 75 nm paclitaxel, the induction is still observable in the MDA-MB-231 cells, and is less pronounced in the MCF-7 cells, which underwent extensive cell death (data not shown). What is most striking is the observation that expression of both phosphorylated and total FoxO3a dramatically increased 48 h after 10 nm paclitaxel treatment in the MCF-7 cells but not in the MDA-MB-231 cells. Interestingly, this expression pattern is also observed in the 75 nm MCF-7 treatment group, but to a lesser extent. These data clearly demonstrate that FoxO3a is induced in the paclitaxel-sensitive MCF-7, but to"

The principle of this defense strategy in the African trypanosome paradigm involves a dense packing of variant surface glycoproteins (VSG) exposing only highly variable and immuno-dominant epitopes to the immune system, whereas conserved epitopes become inaccessible for large molecules. Reducing the size of binders that target the conserved, less-immunogenic, cryptic VSG epitopes forms an obvious solution to combat these parasites. This goal was achieved by introducing dromedary Heavy-chain antibodies. We found that only these unique antibodies recognize epitopes common to multiple VSG classes. After phage display of their antigen-binding repertoire, we isolated a single domain antibody fragment with high specificity for the conserved Asn-linked carbohydrate of VSG. In sharp contrast to labeled concanavalin-A that stains only the flagellar pocket where carbohydrates are accessible because of less dense VSG packing, the single domain binder stains the entire surface of viable parasites, irrespective of the VSG type expressed. This corroborates the idea that small antibody fragments, but not larger lectins or conventional antibody fragments, are able to penetrate the dense VSG coat to target their epitope. The diagnostic potential of this fluorescently labeled binder was proven by the direct, selective, and sensitive detection of parasites in blood smears. The employment of this binder as a molecular recognition unit in immuno-toxins designed for trypanosomosis therapy becomes feasible as well. This was illustrated by the specific trypanolysis induced by an antibody::β-lactamase fusion activating a prodrug.

This was illustrated by the specific trypanolysis induced by an antibody::β-lactamase fusion activating a prodrug. Several infectious agents, e.g. human immunodeficiency virus, Hepatitis, Plasmodium, and Trypanosomes, have acquired a system of antigenic variation to circumvent the immune response of their host (1.Johnson W.E.

Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 8: 83-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The paradigm of this defense mechanism can be found in the African trypanosomes (4.Cross G.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 8: 83-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 5.Vanhamme L. Pays E. McCulloch R. Barry J.D.

Parasitol. 1998; 91: 51-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The key player in their antigenic variation mechanism is the variant-specific surface glycoprotein (VSG) 1The abbreviations used are: VSG, variant-specific surface glycoprotein; CCM, 7-(4-carboxibutamido)-cephalosporin; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; Fv, variable fragment; HCAb, heavy-chain antibody; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PDM, phenylenediamine mustard; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; VHH, variable fragment of heavy chain of HCAb; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. dimer of which 107 identical copies form a dense layer covering the entire surface of the unicellular parasite (7.Cross G.A.

Parasitol. 1998; 91: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). At regular time intervals a new VSG type appears on the surface of the parasite, preventing recognition of the parasites by an upcoming anti-VSG response directed against the previous VSG type. Obviously, the trypanosomes possess a vast repertoire of VSG genes and multiple diversification mechanisms to express one VSG after the other so that only one type is expressed at the time (5.Vanhamme L. Pays E. McCulloch R. Barry J.D. Trends Parasitol. 2001; 17: 338-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 9.Borst P. Ulbert S. Mol. Biochem.

The comparison of the primary structures of VSGs taking into account the position and number of conserved cysteine residues and N-glycosylation sites revealed the presence of three VSG subclasses represented by AnTat 1.1 (class I), MITat 1.1 (class II), and MITat 1.5 (class III) (11.Richards F.F. J. Protozool. 1984; 31: 60-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 12.Carrington M. Boothroyd J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 81: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, even VSGs belonging to the same subclass expose only unique and immunogenic regions to the solvent when present on the coat of the parasite (13.Clarke M.W. Barbet A.F. Pearson T.W. Mol. Immunol. 1987; 24: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 14.Miller E.N. Allan L.M. Turner M.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1984; 13: 67-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 15.Reinitz D.M. Aizenstein B.D. Mansfield J.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 51: 119-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Therefore, trypanosomes have adopted a strategy of actively forcing the immune system to produce antibodies against regions that change continuously. Consequently, most monoclonal antibodies raised against VSG recognize a determinant with an accessible location on the parasite (13.Clarke M.W. Barbet A.F. Pearson T.W. Mol. Immunol. 1987; 24: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 14.Miller E.N. Allan L.M. Turner M.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1984; 13: 67-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Isolation of a monoclonal antibody with a pan-reactivity toward multiple VSGs on viable parasites appears to be far more challenging, because the conserved epitopes become cryptic upon the assembly of VSGs on the membrane of the parasite. To be effective as an anti-trypanosome agent it seems that molecules are required that infiltrate the dense VSG coat to reach a conserved epitope common to the majority of the VSG molecules. The VSGs contain such conserved epitopes, e.g. an Asn-linked high mannose oligosaccharide (GlnNAc2-Man5–9) is conserved among all VSG of Trypanosoma brucei brucei subspecies (16.Bangs J.D. Doering T.L. Englund P.T. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17697-17705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This particular carbohydrate epitope should be a preferred target to design specific drugs because it is absent from glycoproteins of the parasite host (17.Carroll M. McCrorie P. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1987; 88: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). To circumvent the inaccessibility of the conserved epitopes we introduced dromedary antibodies. The serum of Camelidae contains a high proportion of functional antibodies devoid of light chains (18.Hamers-Casterman C. Atarhouch T. Muyldermans S. Robinson G. Hamers C. Songa E.B. Bendahman N. Hamers R. Nature. 1993; 363: 446-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (2177) Google Scholar). The antigen-binding fragment of these so-called heavy-chain antibodies (HCAbs) is comprised in one single domain of only 15 kDa. This dedicated variable domain referred to as VHH is the smallest intact antigen-binding fragment derived from bona fide antibodies (19.Nguyen V.K. Desmyter A. Muyldermans S. Adv. Immunol. 2001; 79: 261-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). After immunization of dromedaries, or llamas, antigen-specific single domain VHHs can easily be isolated by the use of the phage-display technology (19.Nguyen V.K. Desmyter A. Muyldermans S. Adv. Immunol. 2001; 79: 261-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 20.Lauwereys M. Arbabi Ghahroudi M. Desmyter A. Kinne J. Holzer W. De Genst E. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3512-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 21.Conrath K.E. Lauwereys M. Galleni M. Matagne A. Frere J.M. Kinne J. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 2807-2812Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Because VHHs are about 10× smaller than conventional antibodies it is tempting to speculate that these recombinant antibody fragments exhibit a more efficient VSG coat-penetrating capacity and reach epitopes that are inaccessible for conventional antibodies. In addition, it has been reported that the antigenic regions for VHHs or HCAbs on a protein are different from those for the antigen-binding site of conventional antibodies (20.Lauwereys M. Arbabi Ghahroudi M. Desmyter A. Kinne J. Holzer W. De Genst E. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3512-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 21.Conrath K.E. Lauwereys M. Galleni M. Matagne A. Frere J.M. Kinne J. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 2807-2812Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). This aspect, together with their smaller size, suggests that VHHs constitute a yet unexplored pool of candidates to target new epitopes such as those scattered on the surface of living trypanosomes that are non-antigenic or inaccessible for conventional antibodies. The benefits of VHHs in this respect should not only be limited to African trypanosomes but could be extended to include other infectious agents relying on an active antigenic variation mechanism (1.Johnson W.E. Desrosiers R.C. Annu. Rev. Med. 2002; 53: 499-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 2.Staalsoe T. Hamad A.A. Hviid L. Elhassan I.M. Arnot D.E. Theander T.G. J. Infect. Dis. 2002; 186: 719-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 3.Wang H. Bian T. Merrill S.J. Eckels D.D. J. Mol. Evol. 2002; 54: 465-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Here we report on the isolation of a VHH, specific for the conserved carbohydrate epitope of VSGs. Unlike other, larger molecules, it is shown that this VHH penetrates the dense VSG coat of the living parasite and stains trypanosomes independent of the expressed VSG class. The efficacy of this antibody fragment as a small molecular recognition unit in a more complex construct opens promising routes to develop new diagnostic and therapeutic tools to combat trypanosomosis. An illustrative example is included of how this might be accomplished. Purification of VSG AnTat 1.1, MITat 1.1, MITat 1.5, and Deglycosilated VSG—Frozen stabilates of Trypanosoma brucei brucei bloodstream parasites expressing the respective VSG were expanded by infection of rats (Charles River). Rats with systemic parasitaemia (typically 4–5 days post infection) were exsanguinated, and parasites were purified from heparinized blood by DEAE-cellulose (DE52, Whatman) chromatography. VSG was isolated via ion-exchange chromatography and gel filtration (7.Cross G.A. Parasitology. 1975; 71: 393-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 22.Lanham S.M. Godfrey D.G. Exp. Parasitol. 1970; 28: 521-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). Deglycosilated AnTat1.1 was prepared by incubating 100 μg VSG for 16 h at 30 °C with 10 units of N-glycosidase-F (Roche Applied Science). Deglycosilated protein was recovered from the flow-through of the sample passed over concanavalin-A column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with PBS and was further purified by gelfiltration. Dromedary Immunization—A dromedary (Camelus dromedarius) received six injections of 1 mg VSG AnTat 1.1 at weekly intervals (20.Lauwereys M. Arbabi Ghahroudi M. Desmyter A. Kinne J. Holzer W. De Genst E. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3512-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). 45 days after the first injection serum was collected and separated into its different IgG subclasses by differential adsorption on HiTrap-Protein-A and HiTrap-Protein-G columns (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (21.Conrath K.E. Lauwereys M. Galleni M. Matagne A. Frere J.M. Kinne J. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 2807-2812Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). At the same time, anti-coagulated blood was collected to isolate lymphocytes with Uni-Sep (Sopagen). Peripheral blood lymphocytes were counted, and aliquots of 5 × 106 cells were pelleted and stored at -80 °C until further use. Dot-blot Analysis—Each VSG (2 μg) (AnTat 1.1, MITat 1.1 or MITat 1.5) was spotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane and dried, and residual protein-binding sites were blocked for 2 h with PBS with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. The membrane was incubated sequentially with one of the fractionated dromedary IgG isotype (5 μg/ml in PBS), a rabbit anti-dromedary IgG serum, and a goat anti-rabbit-IgG antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma). In between the successive 2 h incubations was a washing step with PBS-0.1% Tween 20. Thirty minutes after adding the substrate (methanol/4-chloro-1-nafthol in PBS/H2O2) the reaction was stopped by washing the membrane with water. Solid-phase Binding ELISA—Different VSG (AnTat 1.1, deglycosilated AnTat 1.1, MITat 1.1, or MITat 1.5) at 1 μg/ml 0.1 m NaHCO3, pH 8.2, were coated overnight (4 °C) to 96-well plates. Residual protein-binding sites were blocked (2 h, room temperature) with 1% casein in PBS. After incubation with serial dilutions of dromedary IgG subclasses, bound dromedary IgG was detected with a rabbit anti-dromedary IgG serum and a goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated to alkaline-phosphatase (Sigma). Ten minutes after addition of the substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma), the optical density was measured at 410 nm. The carbohydrate specificity of our VHHs was tested by ELISA. Wells of peptide immobilizer plates (SanverTech) were coated overnight (4 °C) with oligomannose-9 (Oxford Glycoscience) (0.1 μg/ml 0.1 m NaHCO3, pH 8.2). Overcoating was omitted and the VHH (in triplicate) was loaded in 1:2 serial dilutions starting at 10 μg/ml. Bound VHH was detected using a mouse anti-His antibody and a goat anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Thirty minutes after adding peroxidase substrate, the reaction was stopped with 0.1 N H2SO4 and the optical density was measured at 450 nm (690 nm was used as reference filter). For the concanavalin-A competition experiment, we coated VSG AnTat 1.1 (1 μg/ml 0.1 m NaHCO3, pH 8.2) overnight at 4 °C on 96-well plates. Residual protein-binding sites were blocked for 2 h at room temperature with 1% casein in PBS. The VHH (starting from 10 μg/ml, in triplicate) was serially diluted in PBS or 50 μg concanavalin-A/ml PBS and applied to the wells. Detection of bound VHH was as for the carbohydrate ELISA. VHH Library Construction and Selection of Binders—The preparation of mRNA from lymphocytes, cDNA generation, VHH amplification (with oligo-dT primers), and cloning into a phage-display vectors was performed as described (21.Conrath K.E. Lauwereys M. Galleni M. Matagne A. Frere J.M. Kinne J. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 2807-2812Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Retrieval of VSG specific VHHs was done by three consecutive rounds of panning on antigen immobilized at 10 μg/well in microtiter plates (21.Conrath K.E. Lauwereys M. Galleni M. Matagne A. Frere J.M. Kinne J. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 2807-2812Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). After the last panning individual colonies were picked and expression of the VHH gene was induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The recombinant VHH, extracted from the periplasm, was tested for antigen recognition by ELISA. Construction of the cAb-An33::β-lactamase Conjugates—The cAb-An33::β-lactamase conjugate was constructed by PCR amplification, and insertion of the cAb-An33 sequence, the llama γ2c hinge sequence, and the β-lactamase gene followed by a His6 tag between the NcoI and EcoRI sites of pHEN4 vector (20.Lauwereys M. Arbabi Ghahroudi M. Desmyter A. Kinne J. Holzer W. De Genst E. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3512-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 21.Conrath K.E. Lauwereys M. Galleni M. Matagne A. Frere J.M. Kinne J. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 2807-2812Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Firstly, the particular his-tagged β-lactamase was amplified from Enterobacter cloacae P99 strain (23.Graham M.N. Mantle T.J. Biochem. J. 1989; 260: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) by PCR using primers “βL forward” (5′-CATGCCATGGGCACGCCAGTGTCAGAAA AA-3′) and “βL reverse” (5′-CGCGAATTCTTAATGATGATGATGATGATGCTGTAGCGCCTCGAGG-3′) (restriction sites underlined) and ligated as a NcoI-EcoRI fragment into pHEN4. Secondly, the cAb-An33 gene linked to the llama γ2c hinge gene (19.Nguyen V.K. Desmyter A. Muyldermans S. Adv. Immunol. 2001; 79: 261-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) was engineered as a NcoI-NcoI fragment using primers “A4Short forward” (5′-CATGCCATGACTCGCGGCCCAGCCGGCCATGGC-3′) and “CEAMH reverse” (5′-CATGCCATGGGAGCTTTGGGAGCTTTGGAGCTGGGGTCTTCGCTGTGGTGCGCTGAGGAGACGGTGACCTGGGT-3′) (restriction sites underlined) encoding the 15-amino acids-long llama γ2c hinge (AHHSEDPSSKAPKAP). The plasmid containing the cAb-An33 gene, as obtained after the pannings, was used as template. The PCR fragment was digested by NcoI and ligated in the expression vector containing the β-lactamase gene, linearized by NcoI. Expression and Purification of Single Domain Antibodies and Conjugates—VHH genes of the clones that scored positive in ELISA were recloned into an expression vector pHEN6 as NcoI-BstEII fragments (21.Conrath K.E. Lauwereys M. Galleni M. Matagne A. Frere J.M. Kinne J. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 2807-2812Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Production and purification of recombinant antibody fragments and of the cAb-An33::β-lactamase conjugate was performed as described (21.Conrath K.E. Lauwereys M. Galleni M. Matagne A. Frere J.M. Kinne J. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 2807-2812Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 24.Conrath K.E. Lauwereys M. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7346-7350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Recombinant protein was > 95% pure as evaluated by Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE. The absorption at 280 nm of the fractions and the extinction coefficient, as calculated from the amino acid sequence, were used to determine the protein concentration. Immunofluorescent Microscopy and Flow Cytometry Analysis—The VHH, polyclonal rabbit antibodies and cAb-An33::β-lactamase conjugate were FITC-labeled (25.Freeman D.A. Crissman H.A. Stain Technol. 1975; 50: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and the amount of labeling was determined spectrophotometrically. The bloodstream-form of T. brucei brucei (AnTat 1.1, MITat 1.1, and MITat 1.5) was used in immunofluorescent microscopy and flow cytometric analysis. Aliquots of 107 parasites were incubated for 30 min in an ice-bath with 10% normal rabbit serum/PBS prior to adding different FITC-labeled VHHs (5 μg), FITC-labeled polyclonal rabbit anti-VSG, or FITC-labeled concanavalin-A (Sigma) (5 μg/ml). After 30 min the parasites were pelleted and extensively washed with PBS/10% normal rabbit serum to remove unbound antibodies and analyzed in FACSvantage Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorter (BD Biosciences) or by immunofluorescence microscopy (Nikon ECLIPSE E600 with phase contrast, 40–100× magnification). Two μl DAPI staining (Roche) was added to 10 μl sample prior to microscopic imaging with the corresponding filter. The same field was imaged with the FITC filter and both images were superimposed. Trypanolysis Assay—Purified parasites (106 parasites/ml phosphate-saline-glucose buffer) incubated with TNF-α (104 units/ml) were monitored for 6 h. The experiment was repeated in absence or presence of cAb-An33 or cAb-An04 (1 μg/ml) added to the parasite culture 1 h prior to TNF-α addition. The data shown are typical results from 3 independent experiments performed in triplicate (average standard deviation 1–2%). Cytotoxicity Assays—The LD50 of the phenylenediamine mustard parental drug (PDM) and the 7-(4-carboxibutamido)-cephalosporin mustard prodrug (CCM) were determined by incubating 106 T. brucei brucei AnTat 1.1 parasites (2.5 h, 30 °C) in phosphate-saline-glucose buffer with PDM or CCM (0–150 μm) (26.Vrudhula V.M. Svensson H.P. Kennedy K.A. Senter P.D. Wallace P.M. Bioconjug. Chem. 1993; 4: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To test the toxic effect of the VHH conjugated to β-lactamase and prodrug we incubated 106 T. brucei brucei AnTat 1.1 or MITat 1.5 parasites with 5 μg cAb-An33::β-lactamase (1 h, 4 °C). After washing off unbound material, various concentrations of CCM were added and the surviving parasites were counted. This experiment was repeated 7 times in triplicate, and congruent results were obtained (standard deviation of 1%, according to t test analysis). Identification of VSG-specific VHHs—A dromedary and a rabbit were immunized with VSG purified from T. brucei brucei AnTat 1.1. The conventional antibody subclass (i.e. the IgG1), and the HCAb subclasses (i.e. IgG2 and IgG3) were fractionated from the dromedary serum (18.Hamers-Casterman C. Atarhouch T. Muyldermans S.

Wyns L. Muyldermans S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 2807-2812Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). These fractionated dromedary IgGs and the rabbit anti-AnTat 1.1 serum were used in a dot-blot assay to evaluate their capacity to recognize epitopes shared by the three different VSG classes (I-III), represented by AnTat 1.1, MITat 1.1, and MITat 1.5, respectively (11.Richards F.F. J. Protozool. 1984; 31: 60-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 12.Carrington M. Boothroyd J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 81: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The conventional antibodies from rabbit and dromedary, as well as the HCAb of the IgG2 class, all recognize epitopes on the VSG AnTat 1.1 and MITat 1.5. Remarkably, the HCAbs of the IgG3 isotype bind all three VSG classes to a similar extent. Hence other parts of the immunogen (AnTat 1.1) seem to be antigenic for the IgG3. Moreover, from the signal intensity it is inferred that the dromedary IgG3 isotype contains a detectable titer of antibodies that associate with epitopes common to VSGs of different classes. Because the antigen-binding fragment of a dromedary HCAb is comprised within one single domain (i.e. the VHH) it was decided to isolate these small molecular recognition units via recombinant phage-display technology. The VHH repertoire present in an aliquot of 5 × 107 lymphocytes was cloned in a phage-display vector (20.Lauwereys M. Arbabi Ghahroudi M. Desmyter A. Kinne J. Holzer W. De Genst E. Wyns L.

Proteins. 1998; 32: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Pannings of this VHH library with immobilized AnTat 1.1 yielded seven VSG-specific VHHs (GenBank™ accession numbers AY263485-AY263491). All these VHH genes encoded the framework-2 hallmark amino acids that distinguish the variable domain of a heavy chain of a HCAb from that of a conventional antibody (19.Nguyen V.K. Desmyter A. Muyldermans S. Adv. Immunol. 2001; 79: 261-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). These seven VHHs were produced in Escherichia coli, purified, and their specificity and possible cross-reactivity with other VSGs was analyzed on AnTat 1.1, MITat 1.1, MITat 1.5, and deglycosilated AnTat 1.1 via solid-phase ELISA (Fig. 1B). Five VHHs recognize AnTat 1.1, independent of its glycosilation status, but fail to bind the MITat 1.1 and MITat 1.5. These VHHs are probably directed against unique epitopes present in the hypervariable region of AnTat 1.1. Interestingly, two VHHs, the cAb-An02 and cAb-An33, associate with all three VSG molecules. However, the antigen-binding capacity of the former is hardly influenced upon deglycosilation of the antigen, whereas the latter interacts poorly with the deglycosilated AnTat 1.1. Carbohydrate Specificity of cAb-An33—The binding properties of cAb-An33 were further analyzed because it is better expressed than cAb-An02, gives higher signals in ELISA, and seems to recognize the carbohydrate moiety of VSG, a part of the molecule that is expected to be solvent accessible in the trypanosomal coat. The carbohydrate specificity of cAb-An33 was confirmed by competition with lectins, by inhibition of TNF-α trypanolysis, and by direct binding to VSG peptide fragments or oligosaccharides. First, the binding curves of a serial dilution of the cAb-An33 from 10 to 0.01 μg/ml in a solid-phase ELISA with coated AnTat 1.1 are indicative for an affinity in the nm range. The binding is, however, competed by the presence of concanavalin-A (Fig. 2A), a lectin known to bind the carbohydrates attached to VSG (28.Brickman M.J. Balber A.E. J. Protozool. 1990; 37: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Because a direct interaction between the cAb-An33 and concanavalin-A could not be demonstrated in an ELISA approach nor by biosensor, it is clear that the lectin competes specifically with the antibody fragment for its epitope. The association of any other VSG-specific VHH with AnTat 1.1 is not impeded by an excess concanavalin-A. Second, the interaction of TNF-α and the carbohydrate moiety of the VSG, probably that exposed in the flagellar pocket, induces rapid lysis of parasites (29.Magez S. Geuskens M.

This in vitro TNF-α-mediated T. brucei AnTat 1.1 lysis is effectively inhibited by the presence of cAb-An33 (Fig. 2B). It is a specific inhibition because the co-incubation of TNF-α with any of the other VSG-specific VHH, e.g. cAb-An04, failed to protect the trypanosomes from lysing. There is no indication for a TNF-α and cAb-An33 interaction, so the antibody fragment and the area harboring the lectin-like activity of TNF-α compete with each other for the same target. Third, from all peptides fractionated after digesting AnTat 1.1 with various proteases (30.Magez S. Radwanska M. Stijlemans B. Xong H.V. Pays E. De Baetselier P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33458-33464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), only the fractions containing peptides carrying carbohydrates (revealed by orcinol staining) give a signal in a direct ELISA with cAb-An33. Finally, in a direct ELISA, only the cAb-An33 binds significantly to oligomannose-9, a complex carbohydrate structure resembling the Asn-linked oligomannose of trypanosomes (16.Bangs J.D. Doering T.L. Englund P.T. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17697-17705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, all other VSG-specific VHHs failed to interact with this oligomannose-9 as exemplified by cAb-An46 in Fig. 2C. Interaction of VSG Carbohydrate-specific VHHs with Living Trypanosomes—The capacity of cAb-An33 to recognize its epitope on living trypanosomes was analyzed via flow cytometry and microscopy.

There are three cysteine residues in human neuroglobin; those at positions CD7 and D5 are sufficiently close to form an internal disulfide bond. Both cysteine residues in cytoglobin, although localized in other positions than in human neuroglobin, may form a disulfide bond as well.

Mutation of the cysteines involved, or the use of reducing agents to break the S–S bond, led to a decrease in the observed oxygen affinity of human neuroglobin by an order of magnitude. The critical parameter is the histidine dissociation rate, which changes by about a factor of 10. The same effect is observed with human cytoglobin, although to a much lesser extent (less than a factor of 2). These results suggest a novel mechanism for the regulation of oxygen binding; contact with an appropriate electron donor would provoke the release of oxygen.

Ngb is predominantly expressed in the brain, the retina, and other nerve tissues, whereas Cygb is expressed in all organs studied so far. Although Ngb is clearly localized in the cytosolic compartment of the cell (2Geuens E. Brouns I. Flamez D. Dewilde S. Timmermans J.P. Moens L. J. Biol.

Human NGB and CYGB are composed of 151 and 190 amino acids, respectively, with the presence in CYGB of amino- and carboxyl-terminal extensions of ∼20 residues each.

Ngb and Cygb are hexacoordinated (hx), either in their ferrous forms or in their ferric forms, having the distal HisE7 as the internal ligand. Flash photolysis studies of Ngb, at normal temperature, show high recombination (kon) and low dissociation (koff) rates for O2 and CO, suggesting a high intrinsic affinity for both ligands. However, since the rate-limiting step in ligand binding to the ferrous deoxy-hx form involves dissociation of the distal HisE7 residue, ligand binding in vivo is suggested to be low (P50 = 1 torr) (6Burmester T.

It can be hypothesized that hx-Hbs are universally distributed over the living world and thus may have essential function(s) in cell metabolism. The physiological role of hx-Hbs, mostly expressed at low level, is not well understood. Several roles have been suggested. First, these proteins may scavenge O2 under hypoxic conditions and supply it for aerobic respiration (6Burmester T. Weich B. Reinhardt S. Hankeln T.

Second, they may function as terminal oxidases by oxidizing NADH under hypoxic conditions and hence enhance ATP production by glycolysis (19Sowa A.W. Guy P.A. Sowa S. Hill R.D. Acta Biochim. Pol. 1999; 46: 431-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Third, they could be O2 sensor proteins, activating other proteins with regulatory function (20Hargrove M.S. Brucker E.A. Stec B.

Fourth, they may be involved in nitric oxide metabolism. Sun et al. (17Sun Y. Jin K. Peel A. Mao X.O. Xie L. Greenberg D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

How Ngb protects neurons from hypoxia or ischemia is unclear. Initial ligand binding studies indicated a heterogeneity in the kinetics (12Dewilde S. Kiger L. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Baudin-Creuza V.

Hargrove M.S. J. Biol.

Distal heme pocket heterogeneity in NGB was also observed by Raman spectroscopy and NMR (22Couture M. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Rousseau D.L. J. Biol.

The bonding of these cysteines may play a major role in the observed heterogeneity. In this study, we focus on the structural and functional role of these residues. Expression Cloning and Purification of Recombinant Neuroglobin and Cytoglobin—Expression cloning and purification of wild type and mutant mouse and human neuroglobin was performed as described previously (12Dewilde S. Kiger L. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Baudin-Creuza V. Aerts T. Marden M.C. Caubergs R. Moens L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38949-38955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Human CYGB cDNA in the expression plasmid pET3a (7Burmester T. Ebner B. Weich B. Hankeln T. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2002; 19: 416-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) was expressed under the same conditions except that δ-aminolaevulinic acid was omitted. Expressed CYGB was purified from inclusion bodies using the procedure described by Geuens et al. (2Geuens E. Brouns I. Flamez D. Dewilde S. Timmermans J.P. Moens L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30417-30420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Reconstruction of the native CYGB from the apoprotein was undertaken by adding a 1.4-fold excess of hemin hydrochloride (stock solution in 0.1 m NaOH and diluted in 50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5 immediately before use) followed by dialysis against 50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.5. After reconstruction, insoluble material was eliminated by centrifugation (10,000 rpm; 30 min). Final purification of CYGB was performed by gel filtration using a Sephacryl S200 column equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.5. Mutation of both cysteines (at positions B2 and E9) in the CYGB sequence to serines was performed as described for NGB (12Dewilde S. Kiger L. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Baudin-Creuza V. Aerts T. Marden M.C. Caubergs R. Moens L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38949-38955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). A mini CYGB, missing the amino-terminal residues 1–17 and the carboxyl-terminal residues 165–190, was constructed. The 5′ and 3′ ends of the 570-bp coding regions of the human CYGB were deleted by PCR by using an oligonucleotide primer (GAGAGGCATATGGAGCTGTCCGAGGCGGAG) that incorporates an NdeI site at bp 46 and a primer (ACCCAGAGATCTTACTTGTAGGCTGCGGTC) that introduces a stop codon at bp 502 plus a BglII site at bp 505. The Pfu polymerase was used to minimize amplification errors. The PCR products were cloned in the pET3a vector using the NdeI and BamHI restriction sites. The clones were verified by sequencing before expression. Analyses and Separation of Different Neuro- and Cytoglobin Subforms—Samples of NGB and CYGB were further purified with an Akta purifier system on a Hitrap DEAE-Sepharose column from Amersham Biosciences. This was done with or without the prior incubation in 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) for 1 h at 37 °C. Because of the low pI of the NGB and CYGB, the samples were loaded onto the column equilibrated with 20 mm phosphate buffer at pH 8.0. After a pH decrease to 6.5 (20 mm bis-tris-HCl), the protein elution was initiated at 100 mm NaCl from a selective salt gradient. Protein elution was monitored at 280 and 410 nm. The fractions of the protein were dialyzed against 100 mm phosphate buffer at pH 7, and its purity was assessed by spectroscopic analysis and by gel filtration on a SuperoseR 12 HR10/30. Reaction and Binding Kinetics of Neuroglobin and Cytoglobin with Thiol Reagents—5,5′-Dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) was used to examine the reactivity of the sulfhydryl groups in the native NGB as described by Jocelyn (25Jocelyn P.C. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 44-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The reaction was performed at pH 7 in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer and 100 μm DTNB with a protein concentration of 5–6 μm protein, determined from the Soret band for the carboxylated species using the extinction coefficient ϵ420 = 190 mm–1 cm–1. The absorption at 412 nm, corresponding to the TNB anion (ϵ412 = 13.6 mm–1 cm–1), was continuously monitored over 4 h and corrected against a blank to which no protein was added. The reaction is TNBS-STNB + SCys → STNB + TNBS-SCys, where TNB is the species detected by visible spectroscopy. Human Hb, as well as the α and β globin chains, were used as controls. Under denaturing conditions (8 m guanidinium chloride), these samples showed the same signal amplitude per cysteine; this value was taken as 100% reactivity. The β chains show about half (44%) reactivity under native conditions: 20 mm phosphate buffer at pH 7. Ligand Binding Kinetics—Spectral measurements were carried out with an HP8453 or Varian Cary 400 spectrophotometer. Laser flash photolysis and stopped-flow rapid mixing, the methods used to assess hexacoordination and bimolecular CO and O2 rate constants, have been described previously (12Dewilde S. Kiger L. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Baudin-Creuza V. Aerts T. Marden M.C. Caubergs R. Moens L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38949-38955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Photolysis was performed with 10-ns pulses at 532 nm. Detection of the sample absorption was in the Soret band, typically at 436 nm, using a 50-watt lamp and interference filters. Samples from 1 to 10 μm on a heme basis were in 4 × 10-mm quartz cuvettes. The ligand binding kinetics of proteins with reduced disulfide bond was obtained after incubation of the mouse Ngb and human NGB with 10 mm DTT during 24 h. The transition from the cysteine oxidized form (capable of forming the disulfide bond) to the reduced form could be followed by measuring the CO binding kinetics at various times after addition of DTT. Sample Preparation and Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry—Native samples were infused (5 μl/min) into the mass spectrometer (Quattro Ultima, Micromass Ltd., Wythenshawe, UK) at ∼5 μm concentration in 1:1 acetonitrile:water containing 0.2% formic acid. Data were acquired over the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) range 600–2000 (5 min) and deconvoluted to present the spectra on a molecular weight (mass) scale using the maximum entropy (MaxEnt)-based software supplied with the spectrometer. Mass scale calibration employed the series of ions with multiple charges from separate introductions of Mb (sequence mass 16951.5 Da). Reduced samples were prepared by reacting the native samples (20 μm concentration) with 5 mm DTT in 10 mm ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8–9) for 10 min at 37 °C. The resulting solution was then diluted 5-fold in 1:1 acetonitrile:water containing 0.2% formic acid and infused directly into the mass spectrometer as described above. Reduced and S-carboxyamidomethylated (Cam) samples were prepared by reacting with 5 mm DTT and 5 mm iodoacetamide in 10 mm ammonium bicarbonate/8 m urea and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Excess reagents were removed from the resulting solutions by washing each of them twice with water as follows. First, each solution was centrifuged to dryness in a 10-kDa cut-off centrifugal filter device (Centricon YM10, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Then the proteins retained on the filter were dissolved in 200 μl of water, and the solution was centrifuged to dryness again. This last procedure was repeated once, and the washed proteins were finally dissolved in water. Aliquots of the washed reduced and Cam solutions were diluted to ∼5 μm concentration in 1:1 acetonitrile:water containing 0.2% formic acid and analyzed as described above or digested with trypsin. Cam samples were prepared and washed as described for the reduced and Cam samples except that the DTT was omitted from the reaction mixture. Samples were digested with trypsin for 30–80 min using procedures that were developed for identifying variants in human Hb (26Wild B.J. Green B.N. Cooper E.K. Lalloz M.R. Erten S. Stephens A.D. Layton D.M. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2001; 27: 691-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and adapted to suit the smaller quantities available in this work. Digest mixtures were analyzed by ESI-MS without prior separation of the tryptic peptides. Mass scale calibration used the tryptic peptide peaks from a separate introduction of a normal human Hb digest. In globin sequences, cysteine residues are rather scarce and occur at well defined positions, suggesting specific functions. Our globin data base, an updated version of that reported in Kapp et al. (27Kapp O.H. Moens L. Vanfleteren J. Trotman C.N. Suzuki T. Vinogradov S.N. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2179-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), consists of 811 sequences: 260 α, 272 β, 58 Mb, 12 Ngb, 5 Cygb, and 204 invertebrate sequences. There is a dominant occurrence of Cys at positions G11 (228/260) and G18 (51/260) for the α chains and at positions F9 (234/272), G14 (65/272), and G15 (10/272) for the β chains(Fig. 1, A and B). No specific clustering of Cys residues occurs in the globin sequences of invertebrates, except in nematodes (A8 and E15) and in annelids (NA2 and H11). The role of cysteine residues in globins is most likely the same as in proteins in general, namely, structural by the formation of intra- or intermolecular disulfide bonds or catalytic by being part of an active site or a place of direct ligand binding. Intramolecular disulfide bonds are well documented in many proteins but so far have never been observed in vertebrate globins. Intermolecular disulfide bonds between globin chains are unknown in vertebrate Hbs and Mbs but are essential in some invertebrate extracellular Hbs to form giant aggregates (∼3.5 × 106Mr; annelids, hexagonal bilayer Hbs), which are necessary to avoid elimination of the Hb molecule from the hemolymph by excretory processes (28Weber R.E. Vinogradov S.N. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 569-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 29Royer Jr., W.E. Strand K. van Heel M. Hendrickson W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7107-7111Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The specific S-nitrosylation of vertebrate HbO2 at Cys-93 of the β chain is proposed to be part of a dynamic transport cycle of nitric oxide, leading to control of blood pressure and facilitating efficient delivery of oxygen to tissues (30Jia L. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1996; 380: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar). The available Ngb sequences display conserved Cys at positions CD7, D5, and G18/19. There are two exceptions: the Rodentia Ngb are missing the CD7 Cys, and the zebrafish (Fig. 2) Ngb are missing the G18/19 Cys. Based on the crystal structure of the NGB (31Pesce A. Dewilde S. Nardini M. Moens L. Ascenzi P. Hankeln T. Burmester T. Bolognesi M. Structure. 2003; 11: 1087-1095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), sites CD7 and G19 host solvent-accessible residues, whereas the D5 residue is virtually solvent-inaccessible. The cysteine residues in CYGB occur at positions B2 and E9, different from those in NGB, and are less conserved. Although the number of Ngb and Cygb sequences available is rather small, the relative conservation of the Cys residues may suggest a functional significance. Chromatographic Analysis of Human Neuro- and Cytoglobin—Considering the potential effect of disulfide bonds in both molecules, the separation of “crude” NGB and CYGB preparations into fractions by ion-exchange and gel filtration chromatography was performed. Crude recombinant NGB was separated into three fractions, F1, F2, and F3, by DEAE ion exchange chromatography with gradient elution, with F1 being the major fraction. If the protein solution was first incubated in 1 mm DTT for 1 h at 37 °C, there was only one (monomeric) fraction, corresponding to F1, in the ion-exchange chromatography. This suggests the presence of a dimeric fraction in the crude extract, as confirmed by high performance liquid chromatography analysis. The same preparation for CYGB, with or without DTT, gave mainly a band corresponding to a dimeric form. Dilution experiments did not show a transition to the monomeric form; these results indicate a stable dimer not based on disulfide bonds. However, the mini Cygb, corresponding to the central globular fragment, was eluted as a monomer. Accessibility Studies—The reactivity of the cysteines can be probed by reaction with thiol reagents such as DTNB and iodoacetamide. DTNB binding experiments, under native or denaturing (8 m guanidinium chloride) conditions, show that about 35% of the cysteines are reactive for WT NGB (Fig. 3), indicating the presence of a disulfide bond. The NGB mutant Cys(G19) → Ser with only two cysteines (CD7 and D5) showed essentially no reaction with DTNB (Fig. 3, Table I), under normal or denaturing conditions, indicating that cysteines CD7 and D5 were involved in a disulfide bond. The presence of a CD7/D5 disulfide bond was also recently suggested (32Wakasugi K. Nakano T. Morishima I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36505-36512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Overall, these binding studies indicated the presence of disulfide bonds, but more information was necessary to fully determine all the possible bonding patterns, including dimers via intermolecular bonds.Table ITNB binding to cysteinesGlobinCysteinesState% reactionMouse NgbWTD5, G19F99 NgbCC → SCD5F100 NgbCC → CSG19F93Human NGBWTCD7, D5, G19F38 NGBWTCD7, D5, G19U35 NGBCCC → CCSCD7, D5F0 CYGBWTB2, E9F0 CYGBWTB2, E9U0 Open table in a new tab WT mouse Ngb, or mutants with either the D5 or the G19 cysteine changed to serine, show nearly 100% reactivity with DTNB. Note that cysteine D5 reacted more slowly than that at position G19 (Fig. 3), consistent with results from the x-ray structure, indicating that the D5 site is not directly solvent-accessible (31Pesce A. Dewilde S. Nardini M. Moens L. Ascenzi P. Hankeln T. Burmester T. Bolognesi M. Structure. 2003; 11: 1087-1095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Iodoacetamide accessibility for the cysteines in NGB and CYGB was studied using ESI-MS and will be discussed in the next section. Human Neuroglobin—To rigorously confirm the presence of disulfide bonds, the fractions obtained by DEAE-Sepharose chromatography were analyzed by ESI-MS with the following results. Fraction F1 (Fig. 4a) gave the mass of the dominant component as 16930.9 Da, agreeing, within experimental error, with the sequence mass of NGB with one disulfide bond (16931.4 Da). Also present was a minor component (∼10%: 33891.4 Da) that was 30.3 Da higher in mass than expected for a disulfide-linked dimer of NGB (33860.9 Da). Upon reduction with DTT, the mass of the monomer increased to 16933.2 Da (Fig. 4b), agreeing, within experimental error, with the sequence mass of NGB with all Cys free (16933.5 Da). Concomitantly, the minor dimer fraction disappeared. Fractions F2 and F3 comprised ∼50% of NGB (16931.3 and 16931.2 Da, respectively) and ∼50% of a component of 33862.8 and 33861.9 Da, respectively, in agreement with the sequence mass of a disulfide linked dimer of NGB (data not shown). The mass spectrum obtained from native NGB, after digestion with trypsin, exhibited all the tryptic peptides (Fig. 5) expected from the sequence with free Cys, except T5, T6, and T13, which contain CD7-Cys, D5-Cys, and G19-Cys, respectively (Fig. 6). However, two abundant peptides were present in several charge states whose masses correspond to (T5 + T6 – 2H) and a T13 dimer (T13 + T13 – 2H), inferring that CD7-Cys is coupled to D5-Cys by a disulfide bond and that G19-Cys is free in the native protein (Fig. 6a). Presumably, the T13 dimer was formed during the digest procedure since peptides containing free Cys generally couple with one another under these conditions. However, there was neither evidence for homodimers of T5 or T6 nor for hetero-dimers of T13 with T5 or T6, giving further support for the absence of free Cys in T5 and T6. The disulfide bond between CD7-Cys and D5-Cys was verified by reducing an aliquot of the digest solution with DTT when the (T5 + T6 – 2H) peptide disappeared with the concomitant appearance of the T5 and T6 peptides (Fig. 6b). Furthermore, the T13 dimer disappeared concomitantly with the appearance of T13 monomer.Fig. 6Partial electrospray ionization mass spectra from an 80-min tryptic digest of NGB before (a) and after (b) reduction with DTT.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The intramolecular disulfide bond apparently perturbs the three-dimensional structure of the CD-D region in the crystallized protein. The WT NGB was difficult to crystallize; the initial structure was obtained for the mutant without cysteines (CCC → GSS) bearing the Cys-46 → Gly, Cys-55 → Ser, Cys-120 → Ser mutations (31Pesce A. Dewilde S. Nardini M. Moens L. Ascenzi P. Hankeln T. Burmester T. Bolognesi M. Structure. 2003; 11: 1087-1095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Analysis of the mutated protein structure (i.e. in the absence of any intramolecular disulfide bonds) shows that two of the four crystallographically independent NGB molecules have disordered CD-D regions (residues 44–54), whereas the remaining two display a rather extended conformation for the CD-D region (31Pesce A.

Although the crystal structure observed for the latter two mutated NGB molecules does not suggest the formation of a CD7-D5 intramolecular disulfide, based on simple geometrical considerations, it should be considered that the local structure of the protein may have been altered by the introduction of a Gly residue at site CD7. Under this hypothesis, it appears structurally plausible that local conformational rearrangements may lead the CD7 and D5 residues to a closer mutual location, allowing formation of the d"

Apg8 is covalently but transiently attached to membrane lipids through the actions of activating, conjugating, and processing/deconjugating enzymes. The mammalian Apg8 homologues GATE-16, GARARAP, and MAP1-LC3 have been implicated in intra-Golgi transport, receptor sorting, and autophagy, respectively. All are served by a single set of activating and conjugating enzymes. Here we identify a novel mammalian Apg8 homologue, which we name Apg8L, and describe the synthesis of electrophilic probes based on the GATE-16, GARARAP, MAP1-LC3, and Apg8L proteins. These probes not only form specific adducts in crude cell lysates, but also allow identification of the cellular proteases specific for the C termini of these Apg8 homologues. We find a single protease, Apg4B/autophagin-1, capable of acting on GATE-16, GABARAP, MAP1-LC3, and Apg8L. The Apg4B/autophagin-1 protease thus serves as a processing/deconjugating enzyme for these four highly divergent mammalian Apg8 homologues.

Autophagy is a process via which both yeast and mammalian cells degrade and recycle cytoplasmic components. Upon nutrient starvation a so-called isolation membrane engulfs a portion of the cytoplasm, resulting in the formation of a double-membrane structure called an autophagosome. The outer membrane of the autophagosome subsequently fuses with the vacuole/lysosome, releasing a single-membrane-bound vesicle (also called autophagic body) into this compartment. The membrane is then broken down and its cytosolic contents degraded (Fig. 1D) (1Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Elegant work by Ohsumi, Klionsky, and colleagues (2Ohsumi Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar) has revealed the role of two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems in the formation of autophagosomes during autophagy in yeast.

Apg8/Aut7 and Apg12 associate with the autophagosomal membrane and are essential for autophagy in yeast (3Kirisako T. Baba M. Ishihara N. Miyazawa K. Ohsumi M. Yoshimori T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J.

Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 657-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar). Analogous to ubiquitin, E1 activating and E2 conjugating enzymes have been identified for both UBLs. Apg7 appears to be an E1 activating enzyme for both Apg8 and Apg12 (5Mizushima N. Noda T. Yoshimori T. Tanaka Y. Ishii T. George M.D. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y.

Ohsumi Y. Nature. 2000; 408: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar). Apg8 is transferred from Apg7 to Apg3, an E2 enzyme (7Ichimura Y. Kirisako T. Takao T. Satomi Y. Shimonishi Y. Ishihara N. Mizushima N. Tanida I. Kominami E. Ohsumi M. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 2000; 408: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar), whereas Apg12 is transferred from Apg7 to Apg10, another E2 enzyme (5Mizushima N. Noda T. Yoshimori T. Tanaka Y. Ishii T. George M.D. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 1998; 395: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). Apg12 is then conjugated to Apg5 in isopeptide linkage between the Apg12 C terminus and a lysine residue in Apg5 (5Mizushima N. Noda T. Yoshimori T. Tanaka Y. Ishii T. George M.D. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 1998; 395: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). So far, Apg8 is unique among UBLs in that it is the first protein thought to be linked to a lipid moiety via its C terminus. The sequential action of Apg7 and Apg3 results in the formation of an Apg8-phosphatidylethanolamine conjugate (7Ichimura Y. Kirisako T. Takao T. Satomi Y. Shimonishi Y. Ishihara N. Mizushima N. Tanida I. Kominami E. Ohsumi M. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 2000; 408: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar). Apg8 exists in two forms in the cell (a free/peripherally membrane-bound form and a tightly membrane-associated form), and it is the formation of the latter that depends on the presence of Apg7, Apg3, and the C-terminal glycine of the processed form of Apg8 (see below) (8Kirisako T. Ichimura Y. Okada H. Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi M. Takao T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar, 9Kim J. Huang W.P. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 51-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Lipidation of Apg8 is therefore thought to be important for the association of Apg8 with and the formation of the autophagosomal membrane (3Kirisako T. Baba M. Ishihara N. Miyazawa K. Ohsumi M.

An Apg8-specific protease analogous to ubiquitin-processing/deconjugating enzymes exists in yeast (8Kirisako T. Ichimura Y. Okada H. Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi M. Takao T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar, 9Kim J. Huang W.P. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 51-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). This constitutively expressed cysteine protease, Apg4/Aut2, is responsible for removing the C-terminal arginine residue from the nascent Apg8 precursor. The result of this proteolytic event is the mature Apg8 with an exposed C-terminal glycine residue, which is a prerequisite for the modification reactions performed by Apg7 and Apg3 described above (8Kirisako T. Ichimura Y. Okada H. Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi M. Takao T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Apg4 can deconjugate Apg8 from its target lipid, making the membrane association of Apg8 a reversible process (8Kirisako T. Ichimura Y. Okada H. Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi M. Takao T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). In agreement with this, Apg8 is enriched on the cytoplasmic face of premature autophagosomes and intermediate structures, whereas less Apg8 is present on mature autophagosomes and autophagic bodies (3Kirisako T. Baba M. Ishihara N. Miyazawa K. Ohsumi M. Yoshimori T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). The liberated Apg8 could therefore be recycled and used in a new cycle of conjugation or it might be entrapped in an autophagosome and degraded. Both the processing and the deconjugating activities of Apg4 are required for normal progression of autophagy in yeast (8Kirisako T. Ichimura Y. Okada H. Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi M. Takao T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). Several mammalian Apg8 homologues have been reported (GATE-16, MAP1-LC3, and GABARAP), all of which have been implicated in membrane processes (10Sagiv Y. Legesse-Miller A. Porat A. Elazar Z. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1494-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 11Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T.

GATE-16 (Golgi-associated ATPase enhancer of 16 kDa) is an Apg8 homologue proposed to play a role in intra-Golgi transport and post-mitotic Golgi re-assembly (10Sagiv Y. Legesse-Miller A. Porat A. Elazar Z. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1494-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 13Muller J.M. Shorter J. Newman R. Deinhardt K. Sagiv Y. Elazar Z. Warren G. Shima D.T. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1161-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Membrane fusion events involve interactions between SNARE (SNAP receptor) proteins on the vesicle (v-SNARE) and target (t-SNARE) membranes. v-/t-SNARE complexes bind N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion (NSF) protein and soluble NSF attachment protein (SNAP). NSF then catalyzes disassembly of the SNARE complex via its ATPase activity. GATE-16 interacts with NSF and enhances its ATPase activity (10Sagiv Y. Legesse-Miller A. Porat A. Elazar Z. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1494-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Furthermore, GATE-16 interacts with GOS-28, a Golgi v-SNARE, in a NSF/α-SNAP-dependent fashion, thereby preventing GOS-28 from interacting with its cognate t-SNARE syntaxin 5 (10Sagiv Y. Legesse-Miller A. Porat A. Elazar Z. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1494-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 13Muller J.M. Shorter J. Newman R. Deinhardt K. Sagiv Y. Elazar Z. Warren G. Shima D.T. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1161-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These GATE-16 interactions are thought to modulate Golgi membrane transport. GABARAP (GABAreceptor-associated protein) is another Apg8-like protein that reportedly interacts with NSF and the γ2 subunit of the receptor for the neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) (12Wang H. Bedford F.K. Brandon N.J. Moss S.J. Olsen R.W. Nature. 1999; 397: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 14Kittler J.T. Rostaing P. Schiavo G. Fritschy J.M. Olsen R. Triller A. Moss S.J. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2001; 18: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). GABARAP localizes to intracellular membranes, including the Golgi apparatus and post-synaptic cisternae. Accordingly, it has been proposed that GABARAP is involved in intracellular membrane trafficking, in particular in receptor sorting and/or targeting in neurons (15Kneussel M. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2002; 39: 74-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). GABARAP may also link GABA receptors to the cytoskeleton via its interactions with microtubules and microfilaments (12Wang H. Bedford F.K. Brandon N.J. Moss S.J. Olsen R.W. Nature. 1999; 397: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 14Kittler J.T. Rostaing P. Schiavo G. Fritschy J.M. Olsen R. Triller A. Moss S.J.

The Apg8 homologue MAP1-LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 1-light chain 3) has been implicated in autophagy in mammalian cells (11Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5306) Google Scholar). Rat MAP1-LC3 is processed by proteolysis C-terminally of its conserved glycine residue to produce an active cytosolic form, LC3-I. LC3-I is then further modified to generate LC3-II, which is electrophoretically distinct from MAP1-LC3-I and is localized to the autophagosomal membrane. The amount of LC3-II is correlated with the extent of autophagosome formation induced by starvation. Although the molecular nature of the modification is not known, LC3-II behaves like an integral membrane protein, consistent with its modification involving a lipid moiety, similar to Apg8 in yeast (11Kabeya Y.

Recently, three human isoforms of MAP1-LC3 have been cloned and characterized (MAP1-LC3A, -B, and -C), which differ in their post-translational modifications (17He H. Dang Y. Dai F. Guo Z. Wu J. She X. Pei Y. Chen Y. Ling W. Wu C. Zhao S. Liu J.O. Yu L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 11: 11Google Scholar). MAP1-LC3A and MAP1-LC3C exist in two forms, a higher molecular weight cytosolic form (-I) and a lower molecular weight membrane-associated form (-II), like rat MAP1-LC3. MAP1-LC3A and MAP1-LC3C are proteolytically processed C-terminally of the conserved glycine residue. MAP1-LC3B, on the other hand, does not undergo C-terminal cleavage and exists as a single modified form. Instead, the essential site for post-translational modification of MAP1-LC3B appears to be Lys-122, rather than the conserved Gly-120. Nevertheless, MAP1-LC3B is tightly associated with membrane, although the nature of the modification remains unknown. MAP1-LC3A and MAP1-LC3C largely colocalize with GFP-ratLC3, indicating autophagosomal localization and function, whereas MAP1-LC3B localizes to some other subcellular compartment (17He H. Dang Y. Dai F. Guo Z. Wu J. She X. Pei Y. Chen Y. Ling W. Wu C. Zhao S. Liu J.O. Yu L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 11: 11Google Scholar). The enzymatic pathways that mediate yeast Apg8 processing, conjugation, and deconjugation are conserved for the mammalian Apg8 homologues GATE-16, GABARAP, and MAP1-LC3. These three Apg8 homologues all possess a conserved glycine residue followed by a single variant amino acid at the C terminus (see Fig. 1A). Furthermore, structural analysis shows that GATE-16 and GABARAP contain a short N-terminal helical subdomain followed by a C-terminal domain with a conserved ubiquitin fold (18Paz Y. Elazar Z.

Mammalian E1-like and E2-like enzymes that are homologous to yeast Apg7 and Apg3, respectively, have been identified. All three Apg8 homologues are reportedly activated by mammalian Apg7 and transferred to Apg3, resulting in the generation of the modified forms GATE-16-II, GABARAP-II, and MAP1-LC3-II (21Tanida I.

Commun. 2003; 300: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Unlike MAP1-LC3-I, GATE-16-I and GABARAP-I localize to membrane compartments even prior to their modification (24Tanida I. Komatsu M. Ueno T. Kominami E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 300: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). These data suggest that an Apg8-like conjugation (perhaps lipidation) process is conserved for the mammalian homologues of Apg8. Post-translational processing of the Apg8 homologues exposes the C-terminal glycine and is required for their modification by the conjugation machinery. In addition, deconjugating mechanisms may also govern rate and extent of target modification by mammalian Apg8 homologues. Post-translational processing of a mammalian Apg8-like protein by an unknown cellular protease was first reported for rat MAP1-LC3, of which the C-terminal 22 amino acids are removed to expose the conserved glycine at position 120 (11Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5306) Google Scholar). As mentioned, human MAP1-LC3A and MAP1-LC3C are also thought to be proteolytically cleaved C-terminally of the conserved Gly, whereas MAP1-LC3B is not (17He H. Dang Y. Dai F. Guo Z. Wu J. She X. Pei Y. Chen Y. Ling W. Wu C. Zhao S. Liu J.O. Yu L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 11: 11Google Scholar). Indirect evidence for cellular Apg8-like processing activities comes from pestiviruses containing insertions of MAP1-LC3, GABARAP, or GATE-16 (25Meyers G. Stoll D. Gunn M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4139-4148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Becher P. Thiel H.J. Collins M. Brownlie J. Orlich M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 13069-13076Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These insertions lead to the additional processing of the viral polyprotein and thereby the expression of the viral product downstream. The proteases responsible for these cleavages were not identified (25Meyers G. Stoll D. Gunn M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4139-4148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Becher P. Thiel H.J. Collins M. Brownlie J. Orlich M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 13069-13076Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), but likely include those that act on the mammalian Apg8 homologues and their close relatives. Recent work further suggests that a human Apg4 homologue, known as Apg4A (also called autophagin-2) might be able to process the GATE-16 C terminus in vitro (27Scherz-Shouval R. Sagiv Y. Shorer H. Elazar Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14053-14058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Finally, based on sequence similarity with yeast Apg4, three other human Apg4 homologues (Apg4B/autophagin-1, Apg4C/autophagin-3, and Apg4D/autophagin-4) have been proposed as cysteine proteases involved in autophagy. Autophagin-1 and -4 complement an Apg4 deficiency in yeast, but the substrates of these putative proteases in vivo remain unknown (28Marino G. Uria J.A. Puente X.S. Quesada V. Bordallo J. Lopez-Otin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 21: 21Google Scholar). The exact role of Apg8 homologues in mammalian cells remains to be established. However, there is mounting evidence that they function as ubiquitin-like modifying proteins and that the enzymatic pathways governing their modification are conserved. Although Apg7 and Apg3 have been identified as activating and conjugating enzymes, respectively, for mammalian Apg8 homologues (21Tanida I. Tanida-Miyake E. Ueno T. Kominami E. J. Biol.

Commun. 2003; 300: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), the processing and deconjugating proteases acting on the Apg8-like C termini have remained unknown. Here we describe the synthesis of probes based on mouse GATE-16, GABARAP, MAP1-LC3, as well as a novel Apg8 homologue, Apg8L. These proteins were modified with a C-terminal electrophilic vinyl sulfone moiety and were shown to form specific adducts in crude cell lysates. These active site-directed probes were used to study the cellular proteases specific for the C termini of these Apg8-like proteins and led to the identification of Apg4B/autophagin-1 as a protease specific for GATE-16, GABARAP, MAP1-LC3, and Apg8L. A single protease thus serves this family of ubiquitin-like proteins, which diverge in sequence from each other by as much as 71%. Cloning of GATE-16, MAP1-LC3, GABARAP, and Apg8L into pTYB1—Sequences of mouse GATE-16, MAP1-LC3, GABARAP, and Apg8L were found by searching the NCBI data bases. The data base accession numbers of the sequences used are: AA097810 (GATE-16), AI181000 (MAP1-LC3), BF300927 (GABARAP), and BG244294 (Apg8L). Clones containing the desired sequences were obtained from Research Genetics and ATCC. Open reading frames of the predicted processed forms of the proteins, omitting the C-terminal codon (GATE-161-116, MAP1-LC31-120, GABARAP1-116, Apg8L1-116; see Fig. 1A), were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR primers used had extensions at their 5′ ends to generate an NdeI restriction site at the N-terminal coding end of the PCR product and a SapI restriction site at the C-terminal coding end of the PCR product. To generate the epitope-tagged versions of the MAP1-LC3 fusion, coding sequences for the HA epitope were included in the 5′ PCR primer, between the NdeI site and the methionine start codon of the MAP1-LC3 sequence. After digestion of the PCR product with NdeI and SapI, the fragment was cloned into the pTYB1 vector (New England Biolabs), generating an in-frame fusion with the intein and chitin binding domain (29Xu M.Q. Evans Jr., T.C. Methods. 2001; 24: 257-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). All constructs generated were sequence verified. Synthesis of Vinyl Sulfone Derivatives of GATE-16, MAP1-LC3, GABARAP, and Apg8L—The synthesis of vinyl sulfone derivatives of GATE-16, MAP1-LC3, GABARAP, and Apg8L was identical for all probes, and these proteins are here collectively referred to as “Apg8.” Expression of Apg8-intein-chitin binding domain fusion proteins in Escherichia coli was induced at A600 ∼ 0.5 with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma) for 2 h at 30 °C (30Borodovsky A.

Cells from 1 liter of bacterial culture were pelleted and resuspended in 30 ml of 50 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaOAc, pH 6.5, 50 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and lysed by French press (1500 p.s.i.). After centrifugation, the supernatant was loaded onto a 15-ml chitin bead column (New England Biolabs) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, to allow binding of the Apg8-inteinchitin binding domain fusion protein. The column was washed with 80 ml of lysis buffer, followed by 50 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mm β-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid (MESNa; Sigma). The column, containing buffer with MESNa, was incubated overnight at 37 °C to allow on-column cleavage. The Apg8-MESNa thioester was eluted with 25 ml of lysis buffer, and the fractions containing Apg8-MESNa product were concentrated using a Centriprep (Mr 3000 cut-off; Millipore). Overall yield was 1-5 mg of Apg8-MESNa/liter of bacterial culture. Apg8-MESNa was converted to the vinyl sulfone derivative in a chemical ligation reaction with a large excess of glycine vinyl sulfone (31Bogyo M. Shin S. McMaster J.S. Ploegh H.L. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 307-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Glycine vinyl sulfone was added to an aliquot of concentrated Apg8-MESNa (1-2 mg/ml; 500 μl) to a final concentration of 0.25 m, followed by addition of 75 μl of 2 mN-hydroxysuccinimide and 30 μl of 2 m NaOH. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for <1 h, and the reaction was monitored by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry, using an LCZ electrospray mass spectrometer instrument (Micromass) coupled with an HP1100 high performance liquid chromatography system (Hewlett Packard). Conversion to the desired product was ∼20-30%, as judged from the LC-MS spectra. The observed (calculated) molecular weights of the Apg8-like VS-probes were: GATE-16: 13,579.8 ± 2.4 (13,580.8); GABARAP: 13,866.9 ± 1.8 (13,866.0); MAP1-LC3: 14,185.6 ± 2.4 (14,186.4); Apg8L: 13,978.1 ± 2.1 (13,977.0). The reaction was terminated by addition of 30 μlof2 m HCl and the solution dialyzed against 50 mm NaOAc, pH 4.5, or phosphate-buffered saline, pH 6, in a 3.5-ml Slide-a-Lyzer (Mr 3500 cut-off, Pierce). The sample was subsequently aliquoted and stored at -80 °C. Probes were used without further purification. Preparation of Cell Lysates—EL-4 cells (mouse thymoma cell line) were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 50 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Single cell suspensions were prepared from mouse tissues by disrupting the organs between glass slides in phosphate-buffered saline. If required, red blood cells were lysed by resuspension in ACK buffer (0.15 m NH4Cl, 1 mm KHCO3, 0.1 mm Na2EDTA, pH 7.3). To lyse cells, cell pellets were resuspended in HR buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 250 mm sucrose, 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 2 mm adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP)) and vortexed vigorously with glass beads. Alternatively, cells were resuspended in buffer containing Nonidet P-40 (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 2 mm ATP) and incubated on ice for 30-45 min. Lysates were centrifuged to remove cell debris and aliquots snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. Subcellular Fractionation—Cells were lysed in 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm sucrose, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mm DTT, 2 mm ATP using a ball-bearing homogenizer. Lysates were centrifuged for 15 min at 1500 rpm in a Allegra 6KR centrifuge (Becton Dickinson), generating the low speed pellet containing unbroken cells and nuclei. The low speed pellet was solubilized with buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40. The low speed supernatant was transferred and centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g to pellet membranes. The supernatant (100,000 × g for 1 h) was removed and the pellet (100,000 × g for 1 h) resuspended in lysis buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Radio-iodination of GATE-16-VS, MAP1-LC3-VS, GABARAP-VS, and Apg8L-VS—Apg8-like probes were radio-iodinated as described (32Borodovsky A. Kessler B.M. Casagrande R. Overkleeft H.S. Wilkinson K.D. Ploegh H.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5187-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Briefly, 40 μg of UBL-VS was iodinated in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 mCi of Na125I, using IODO-GEN as a catalyst. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min on ice and was quenched with 0.1 mg/ml tyrosine. 1 mg/ml hen egg lysozyme was added as a carrier protein for the subsequent purification over a G25 Sephadex (Amersham Biosciences) spin column. Iodinated probes were stored at -80 °C. Labeling Reactions and Detection—125I-Labeled probe (5 × 105 to 2 × 106 cpm) was incubated with 20-40 μg of cell lysate for 1 h at 37 °C. Where indicated, non-radioactive competing Apg8-like probes were mixed with the iodinated probes prior to addition of cell lysate. Unlabeled competing probes were added, increasing in 3-fold increments, in the following amounts (in μl): GATE-16 or MAP1-LC3: 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, and 1; GABARAP: 0.2, 0.6, 2, and 6; Apg8L"
https://openalex.org/W2161412395,"The human multidrug resistance gene MDR3 encodes a P-glycoprotein that belongs to the ATP-binding cassette transporter family (ABCB4). MDR3 is a critical trans-locator for phospholipids across canalicular membranes of hepatocytes, evidenced by the fact that human MDR3 deficiencies result in progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type III. It has been reported previously that MDR3 expression is modulated by hormones, cellular stress, and xenobiotics. Here we show that the MDR3 gene is trans-activated by the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) via a direct binding of FXR/retinoid X receptor α heterodimers to a highly conserved inverted repeat element (a FXR response element) at the distal promoter (-1970 to -1958). In FXR trans-activation assays, both the endogenous FXR agonist chenodeoxycholate and the synthetic agonist GW4064 activated the MDR3 promoter. Deletion or mutation of this inverted repeat element abolished FXR-mediated MDR3 promoter activation. Consistent with these data, MDR3 mRNA was significantly induced by both chenodeoxycholate and GW4064 in primary human hepatocytes in time- and dose-dependent fashions. In conclusion, we demonstrate that MDR3 expression is directly up-regulated by FXR. These results, together with the previous report that the bile salt export pump is a direct FXR target, suggest that FXR coordinately controls secretion of bile salts and phospholipids.

We hypothesized that FXR might also regulate expression of MDR3 to coordinately control secretion of bile acids and phospholipids.To determine whether the MDR3 gene is a target of FXR, we first treated primary human hepatocytes with FXR agonists and analyzed endogenous MDR3 expression by real time PCR and by Northern blot analysis. Indeed, in primary human hepatocytes, the MDR3 mRNA was strongly induced by both the endogenous FXR agonist CDCA and the synthetic ligand GW4064. We further identified an IR-1 element in the MDR3 promoter and demonstrated that the FXR/RXRα heterodimer specifically bound to the IR-1 and that the integrity of this IR-1 is essential for FXR-mediated promoter activation. These results indicate that the human MDR3 gene is directly trans-activated by FXR via the IR-1 element in the MDR3 promoter and suggest that FXR regulates expression of MDR3 and BSEP coordinately by a feed-forward mechanism to facilitate hepatic export of bile acids and phospholipids. These results support the critical role of FXR in cholesterol and bile acid metabolism.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents—The following reagents were obtained from Invitrogen: DMEM and Opti-MEM I medium, regular fetal bovine serum (FBS) and charcoal-stripped FBS (CS-FBS), TRIzol reagents, T4 polynucleotide kinase, PCR Supermix, and oligonucleotide primers for gene cloning.

TaqMan reagents for cDNA synthesis and real time PCR and TaqMan oligonucleotide primers and probes for human MDR3 were purchased from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA).Sequence Analysis of MDR3 Genomic Region—Previous study has identified multiple transcription start sites for human MDR3 (17Smit J.J. Mol C.A. van Deemter L. Wagenaar E. Schinkel A.H. Borst P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1261: 44-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To better define the transcription start site of MDR3, we blasted the predominant form of the gene, NM_000443, against human mRNA and EST data bases. Multiple transcripts of human MDR3 were identified and retrieved. Each of them was mapped onto the Celera human genome (R26) using BLAT (18Kent W.J. Genome Res. 2002; 12: 656-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (6071) Google Scholar). The map indicated two transcription start sites >5 kb apart. Based on information from the full-length transcripts, we refer to the upstream site as the transcription start site of human MDR3. The genomic region spanning MDR3 and its 10-kb upstream flanking region was then extracted. Putative binding sites for transcription factors were identified by scanning this genomic sequence against the TRANSFAC data base (19Wingender E. Chen X. Fricke E. Geffers R. Hehl R. Liebich I.

The fragment of -2201/+37 was amplified by PCR, and the MDR32201-Luc construct was generated by subcloning of the PCR-amplified fragment (-2201/+37) into the pGL3-enhancer plasmid vector (Promega) at NheI/HindIII sites. Similarly, the MDR32000-Luc and MDR31955-Luc constructs were also generated by subcloning of the PCR-amplified fragment (-2000/+37) and (-1955/+37) into the pGL3-enhancer plasmid, respectively. The sequence integrity for all constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The expression vector pcDNA3.1-hFXR, pcDNA3.1-hRXRα, and pCMV-lacZ were described previously (20Cui J. Huang L. Zhao A. Lew J.L. Yu J. Sahoo S. Meinke P.T. Royo I. Pelaez F. Wright S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10214-10220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar).MDR3 Promoter Mutants—FXRE in the MDR3 promoter was mutated using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). PCR reactions were carried out according to the manufacturer's directions with the MDR32000-Luc construct as a template. The sense primer was 5′-AG AGT TAG TAA A AATCA A TAATTT TAAGCC TAG TG-3′, and the antisense primer was 5′-CA CTA GGC TTA AAATTA T TGA TTT TT A CTA ACT CT-3′ (altered bases are in bold and underlined).Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—cDNA encoding human FXR or RXRα was transcribed and translated using the TnT quick-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Double-stranded oligonucleotide probes for the EMSA were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (3000 mCi/mmol) by T4 polynucleotide kinase. The EMSA was performed as described previously (21Grober J. Zaghini I. Fujii H. Jones S.A. Kliewer S.A. Willson T.M. Ono T. Besnard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29749-29754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, 2 μl of in vitro translated FXR or RXR protein alone or together were added to 20 μl of reaction containing 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 40 mm KCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 6% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC). Cold competitor oligonucleotides including the wild type MDR3 FXRE (5′-AGT TAG TAA ATGTCAATAACCT TAAGC-3′), mutated MDR3 FXRE (5′-AG AGT TAG TAA A aaTCA A TAAttT TAAGCC TAG TG-3′) and ideal IR-1 containing an IR-1 consensus (5′-GATGGGCCA AGGTCA A TGACCT CGGGG-3′) were included in 20-, 50-, and 200-fold excess. After a 20-min incubation on ice, 10 fmol of the 5′-end-labeled MDR3 FXRE probes were added, and the mixture was continuously incubated for an additional 20 min on ice. DNA-protein complexes were resolved on a 4% native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis containing 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA (0.89 m Tris, 0.89 m boric acid, 0.02 m disodium EDTA for 10× Tris borate-EDTA). The gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film at -70 °C.FXR Trans-activation—HepG2 cells were transfected in 96-well plates using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent as described previously (22Cui J. Heard T.S. Yu J. Lo J.L. Huang L. Li Y. Schaeffer J.M. Wright S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25963-25969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Transfection mixtures for each well contained 0.405 μl of FuGENE 6, 10.4 ng of pcDNA3.1-hFXR, 10.4 ng of pcDNA3.1-hRXRα, 10.4 ng of pGL3-enhancer-MDR3-promoter-Luc, and 103.8 ng of pCMV-lacZ. The treatment of transfected cells with various FXR ligands, assays for luciferase, and β-galactosidase activities were performed following the same protocols as described previously (22Cui J. Heard T.S. Yu J. Lo J.L. Huang L. Li Y. Schaeffer J.M. Wright S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25963-25969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This assay was performed at Merck Sharp and Dohme de España in Spain.Treatment of Primary Human Hepatocytes for Gene Expression— Primary human hepatocytes were purchased from In Vitro Technologies. Cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 5 mm HEPES. For determination of gene specific expression by TaqMan analysis, cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 2 million cells/well in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 5 mm HEPES. Twenty-four hours after seeding, cells were treated with various concentrations of compounds in DMEM containing 0.5% CS-FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 5 mm HEPES. Unless specified, cells were treated for 24 h.RNA Isolation and Real Time Quantitative PCR—Total RNA was extracted from the treated human primary hepatocytes using the TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription reactions and TaqMan PCRs were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems). Sequence-specific amplification was detected with an increased fluorescent signal of carboxyfluorescein (reporter dye) during the amplification cycles. Amplification of human 18 S RNA was used in the same reaction of all samples as an internal control. Gene-specific mRNA was subsequently normalized to 18 S RNA. Levels of human MDR3 mRNA were expressed as the -fold difference of compound-treated cells against Me2SO-treated cells.Northern Blot Analysis—Isolation of total RNA was similar to that used in real time quantitative PCR. Total RNA (10 μg) was separated by electrophoresis on a 1% denaturing agarose gel with 1× formaldehyde/MOPS (Ambion, TX) and then transferred to a nylon membrane (Nytran SuPerCharge, Schleicher and Schuell). Blots were hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA probe of the human MDR3 gene (GenBank™ accession number M23234, bases 536-1129) and then re-probed with a radiolabeled cDNA probe of the β-actin gene (Ambion, TX).TaqMan Primers and Probes—Oligonucleotide primers and probe for human MDR3 were designed using the Primer Express program and were synthesized by Applied Biosystems. These sequences (5′-3′) are as follows: forward primer (GTACTGGTGCACTTTCTACAAGACTTG), probe (6FAM-CACAGATGCTGCCCAAGTCCAAGGA-TAMRA), and reverse primer (TGCAATTAAAGCCAACCTGGTT) (where 6FAM is 6-carboxyfluorescein and TAMRA is carboxytetramethylrhodamine). The primers and probe for human 18 S RNA were also purchased from Applied Biosystems.RESULTSEndogenous Expression of MDR3 Is Increased by FXR Agonists in Primary Human Hepatocytes—To determine whether MDR3 expression is regulated by FXR, primary human hepatocytes were treated with the endogenous FXR agonist CDCA (60 μm) and the synthetic FXR agonist GW4064 (5 μm) for 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h, and the endogenous expression of MDR3 was determined by real time PCR (TaqMan). Up-regulation was readily detectable within 3 h with a maximum induction of 1.5-2-fold, which increased to around 3-fold at 6 h and about 4-fold at 12 h (Fig. 1A). Twenty-four-hour treatment yielded a peak induction of 5-6-fold, which decreased slightly at 48 h (Fig. 1A). The fact that MDR3 up-regulation by FXR agonists was readily detectable as early as 3 h suggests MDR3 is a direct target of FXR. Upon 24-h treatment, MDR3 mRNA was increased by CDCA in a dose-dependent manner with a maximum induction of 15-fold (Fig. 1B). Compared with the result in Fig. 1A, the more robust induction on MDR3 mRNA by CDCA in Fig. 1B may be because of the variation of individual donors.Northern blot analysis was carried out to confirm the results obtained from the real time PCR. Treatment of the primary human hepatocyte cells with 60 μm CDCA or 5 μm GW4064 resulted in a 10-20-fold increase of the 4.2-kb RNA band seen with a radiolabeled human MDR3 cDNA probe (Fig. 1C). The Northern blot analysis confirms that endogenous expression of MDR3 is induced by FXR agonists.The MDR3 Promoter Contains an IR-1 That Binds Specifically to the FXR/RXRα Heterodimer—The FXR/RXRα heterodimer binds to specific DNA sequences in promoters of target genes to regulate gene transcription. The DNA sequences recognized by the heterodimer comprise an inverted repeat separated by a single nucleotide (IR-1). A data base search using the IR-1 consensus sequence identified a highly conserved IR-1 element in the distal promoter of MDR3 (-1970 to -1958). To examine whether the FXR/RXRα heterodimer binds to this IR-1 element, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed using 32P-labeled IR-1 from the human MDR3 promoter in the presence of in vitro translated human FXR and/or human RXRα proteins. The results of EMSAs are shown in Fig. 2A. Neither FXR nor RXRα alone bound to the probe (lanes 1 and 2). However, when both FXR and RXRα proteins were present, a complex was formed indicating that it is the FXR/RXRα heterodimer that is bound by the IR-1 element (lane 3). Competition analysis showed that an unlabeled IR-1 oligonucleotide from MDR3 promoter (Fig. 2B, WT) at a 20-, 50-, or 200-fold molar excess was able to compete for binding in a dose-dependent manner (lanes 4-6), whereas the same molar excess of a mutated oligonucleotide (Fig. 2B, Mut) failed to compete for binding (lanes 7-9). Moreover, an ideal IR-1 sequence (Fig. 2B, IR-1) efficiently competed for binding at a 20-, 50-, or 200-fold molar excess (lanes 10-12). These results indicate that the IR-1 element in the MDR3 promoter is an authentic FXR/RXRα-binding cis element.Fig. 2FXR/RXRα heterodimers bind specifically to the IR-1 element in the human MDR3 promoter.A, EMSAs were performed as described under “Materials and Methods” with in vitro translated FXR (lane 1), RXRα (lane 2), or FXR/RXRα (lanes 3-12) with the wild type (WT) IR-1 in the human MDR3 promoter as probe. Competition analysis was performed with a 20-, 50-, or 200-fold excess of wild type MDR3 IR-1 (lanes 4-6), mutated IR-1 (Mut, lanes 7-9), or idealized IR-1 (lanes 10-12).

This construct (MDR32201-Luc) was transiently transfected into HepG2 cells together with FXR and RXRα expression vectors, and the transfected cells were treated with 50 μm CDCA or 0.5 μm GW4064. Luciferase activity was induced by CDCA (Fig. 3B) or GW4064 (Fig. 3C) by 4-6-fold compared with the Me2SO control.Fig. 3Deletion-mutation analysis of the human MDR3 promoter.A, schematic presentation of different MDR3 promoter constructs. The constructs of MDR32201-Luc and MDR32000-Luc contain the IR-1 sequence localized between -1970 and -1958. MDR31955-Luc lacks the IR-1 element, and MDR3mut-Luc contains a mutated IR-1 (mutation in lowercase), which is otherwise the same as MDR32000-Luc. B and C, HepG2 cells (3.2 × 104 cells/well of 96-well plates) were co-transfected with pCMV-lacZ, FXR/RXRα expression vectors, and each of the MDR3 promoter constructs as indicated in A. Cells were then treated with 50 μm CDCA (B, hatched bars) or 0.5 μm GW4064 (C, solid bars) for 40-48 h, and the cell lysate was used for determination of luciferase and β-galactosidase activities as described under “Materials and Methods.” Luciferase activities were normalized to β-galactosidase activities individually for each well. Each value represents the mean ± S.D. of six determinations. DMSO (open bars), Me2SO.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further define the importance of IR-1 element in MDR3 promoter activation, two other reporter constructs, MDR32000-Luc and MDR31955-Luc, were also generated (Fig. 3A). MDR32000-Luc is a minimal promoter that contained the IR-1 element, whereas MDR31955-Luc contained a deletion of IR-1 and upstream sequences (Fig. 3A). HepG2 cells were transfected with each of the constructs along with FXR and RXRα expression vectors. Luciferase activity was readily induced by 50 μm CDCA or 0.5 μm GW4064 (∼5-fold) for the MDR32000-Luc construct, whereas only minimal induction was observed for MDR31955-Luc, which was similar to that of the pGL3 vector control (Fig. 3, B and C). These results indicate that the IR-1 element is necessary for FXR ligand-induced MDR3 promoter activation.Mutation of MDR3 IR-1 Abolishes Promoter Trans-activation by FXR/RXRα—To demonstrate further that the IR-1 element at -1970 to -1958 is responsible for the trans-activation of MDR3 promoter, mutations in both halves of the IR-1 element (ATGTCA A TAACCT to AaaTCA A TAAttT; mutated bases in lowercase type) were created in the MDR32000-Luc construct using site-directed mutagenesis, and the mutant construct (MDR3mut-Luc) was transfected in HepG2 cells together with FXR and RXRα expression vectors. Compared with MDR32000-Luc, MDR3mut-Luc showed only a modest residual induction by 50 μm CDCA (Fig. 3B) and 0.5 μm GW4064 (Fig. 3C). This induction was indistinguishable from that of the construct lacking the IR-1 element (MDR31955-Luc) and the pGL3 vector control (Fig. 3, B and C). This result indicates that the integrity of the IR-1 element in the MDR3 promoter is essential for the promoter trans-activation by FXR/RXRα.GW4064 Activates the MDR3 Promoter in a Dose-dependent Fashion—To determine the dose dependence of MDR3 promoter activation by FXR, the MDR32000-Luc construct (a minimal promoter containing the IR-1 element) was transiently transfected into HepG2 cells together with the FXR and RXRα expression vectors, and cells were treated by the synthetic FXR ligand GW4064. Fig. 4 indicates that GW4064 increased the luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner with an EC50 value of 25 nm and a maximum induction of 8-10-fold. The EC50 value in this assay correlates well with the binding affinity of this ligand on FXR (23Willson T.M. Jones S.A. Moore J.T. Kliewer S.A. Med. Res. Rev. 2001; 21: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In the absence of exogenous FXR/RXR (without co-transfection with the FXR and RXRα expression vectors), GW4064 did not significantly increase the luciferase activity (Fig. 4B). This is presumably because of a low basal level of FXR expression in HepG2 cells that was not enough for activating the MDR3 promoter construct that was transiently transfected into the cells.Fig. 4GW4064 induces expression of the MDR3 promoter in a dose-dependent fashion.A, HepG2 cells (3.2 × 104 cells/well of 96-well plates) were co-transfected with pCMV-lacZ, FXR/RXRα expression vectors, and the MDR32000-Luc construct (see Fig. 3A). B, HepG2 cells (3.2 × 104 cells/well of 96-well plates) were co-transfected with MDR32000-Luc construct and pCMV-lacZ. Cells were then treated with various concentrations of GW4064 for 40-48 h, and the cell lysate was used for determination of luciferase and β-galactosidase activities as described under “Materials and Methods.” Luciferase activities were normalized to β-galactosidase activities individually for each well. Each value represents the mean ± S.D. of six determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The FXR and RXRα Ligands Additively Activate the MDR3 Promoter—It has been shown previously that several FXR targets are regulated by both bile acids and the RXRα ligand, 9-cis-retinoic acid (RA) (21Grober J. Zaghini I. Fujii H. Jones S.A. Kliewer S.A. Willson T.M. Ono T. Besnard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29749-29754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 23Willson T.M.

To determine whether the MDR3 promoter is also regulated by the RXRα ligand, the MDR32000-Luc construct was transiently transfected into HepG2 cells together with the FXR and RXRα expression vectors. As expected, 9-cis-RA alone efficaciously increased the luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner with a maximum induction of 6-fold (Fig. 5). In the presence of 50 nm GW4064, this induction was further increased by 2-3-fold compared with that induced by 9-cis-RA alone (Fig. 5) indicating that FXR and RXRα ligands work additively on the activation of the MDR3 promoter. These results confirm that FXR is a permissive receptor and that it is the FXR/RXRα heterodimer that trans-activates the MDR3 promoter.Fig. 5GW4064 and 9-cis-RA additively increase expression of the MDR3 promoter. HepG2 cells (3.2 × 104 cells/well of 96-well plates) were co-transfected with pCMV-lacZ, FXR/RXRα expression vectors, and the MDR32000-Luc construct (see Fig 3A). Cells were then treated with various concentrations of 9-cis-RA in the presence (solid bars) or absence (hatched bars) of 50 nm GW4064 for 40-48 h, and the cell lysate was used for determination of luciferase and β-galactosidase activities as described under “Materials and Methods.” Luciferase activities were normalized to β-galactosidase activities individually for each well.

https://openalex.org/W2090342862,"p21-activated kinase 1 (Pak1) has been shown recently to induce hyperplasia in the mammary epithelium, a phenotype also manifested by overexpression of cyclin D1, a known indicator of the proliferative stage. Here we investigated the role of the Pak1 pathway in the expression of cyclin D1 using tissue culture models and transgenic mice expressing activated Pak1 in mammary glands. We found that hyperplastic mammary glands from catalytically active Pak1 transgenic mice exhibit a 5- to 7-fold increased expression of cyclin D1 as compared with stage-matched wild-type mice. In addition, Pak1 levels were elevated in human breast tumors and also correlated well with increased cyclin D1 expression. Increased expression of Pak1 in breast cancer cells stimulated cyclin D1 promoter activity, elevated levels of cyclin D1 mRNA, protein, and nuclear accumulation of cyclin D1. Conversely, Pak1 inhibition by an auto-inhibitory peptide (amino acids 83-149) or Pak1 knockdown by short interference RNA markedly reduced the expression of cyclin D1, suggesting a requirement of a functional Pak1 pathway for optimal expression of cyclin D1. Results from deletion and mutant analysis indicate that Pak1 regulates cyclin D1 transcription by means of an NF-κB-dependent pathway. Together, these findings suggest a model wherein Pak1 regulation of cyclin D1 expression might involve an NF-κB-dependent pathway and that hyperplasia in the mammary glands of Pak1-TG mice may be associated, at least in part, with the up-regulation of cyclin D1, and that Pak1 is up-regulated in human breast tumors. p21-activated kinase 1 (Pak1) has been shown recently to induce hyperplasia in the mammary epithelium, a phenotype also manifested by overexpression of cyclin D1, a known indicator of the proliferative stage.

The small GTPases, including Cdc42 and Rac1, have been implicated in the regulation of mammalian cell morphology and motility (1.Narumiya S. Ishizaki T. Watanabe N. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). More specifically, Rac1 induces cortical actin polymerization, which is seen as membrane ruffling and lamellipodia, and Cdc42 induces the formation of peripheral actin microspikes and filopodia (2.Ridley A.J.

The small GTPases regulate the formation of cytoskeletal structures by means of a family of serine/threonine kinases known as p21-activated kinases (Paks). 1The abbreviations used are: Pak1, p21-activated kinase; ER, estrogen receptor-α; NF-κB, nuclear factor κB; Dox, doxycycline; siRNA, short interference RNA; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; WT, wild type; GST, glutathione S-transferase. 1The abbreviations used are: Pak1, p21-activated kinase; ER, estrogen receptor-α; NF-κB, nuclear factor κB; Dox, doxycycline; siRNA, short interference RNA; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; WT, wild type; GST, glutathione S-transferase. Activation of Pak1 is accompanied by the disassembly of stress fibers and focal adhesion complexes, as well as by maintenance of the integrity of the motile leading edge (5.Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Chen X.Q. Chong C. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Manser E. Huang H.Y. Loo T.H. Chen X.Q. Dong J.M. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1129-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pak1 is activated by a number of extracellular signals, including heregulin-β1 and epidermal growth factor, which are potent inducers of Pak1 activity and cell motility of breast cancer cells (7.Galiesteo M.L.

Activation of Pak1 involves autophosphorylation of several sites, including Thr-423 within the auto-inhibitory loop of the kinase (9.Vadlamudi R.K. Li F. Adam L. Nguyen D. Ohta Y. Stossel T.H. Kumar R. Nat. Cell. Bio. 2002; 4: 681-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Accordingly, Pak1 phosphorylation at Thr-423 has been linked with its activation, as substitution of the acidic residue glutamic acid at this site yields a constitutively active T423E Pak1 enzyme (9.Vadlamudi R.K.

In addition to its cytoskeleton effects, Pak1 also activates c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinases, and thus influences nuclear signaling (11.Bagrodia S.

Furthermore, expression of a kinase-dead Pak1 mutant in the highly invasive breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231 led to stabilization of stress fibers, enhanced cell spreading, and reduction in invasiveness (14.Adam L. Vadlamudi R.K. Mandal M. Chernoff J. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12041-12050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Conversely, hyperactivation of the Pak1 pathway by conditional expression of catalytically active T423E Pak1 in the non-invasive breast cancer cell line MCF-7 promotes cell migration and anchorage-independent growth (15.Vadlamudi R.K.

For example, Pak1 gene amplification has also been reported in ovarian (16.Schraml P. Schwerdtfeger G. Burkhalter F. Raggi A. Schmidt D. Ruffalo T. King W. Wilber K. Mihatsch M.J. Moch H. Am. J.

Furthermore, Pak1 protein has been shown to be up-regulated in ovarian tumors (16.Schraml P. Schwerdtfeger G. Burkhalter F. Raggi A. Schmidt D. Ruffalo T. King W. Wilber K. Mihatsch M.J. Moch H. Am.

Mazumdar A. Vadlamudi R.K. Kumar R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5437-5447Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Additionally, expression of kinase-active T423E Pak1 transgene in mammary glands induces hyperplasia in the mammary epithelium (19.Wang R.A. Mazumdar A. Vadlamudi R.K. Kumar R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5437-5447Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), a phenotype manifested by several other oncogenes including cyclin D1 (20.Wang T.C. Cardiff R.D. Zukerberg L. Lees A. Arnold A. Schmidt E.V. Nature. 1994; 369: 669-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar).Overexpression of cyclin D1 has been noted in over 50% of human breast tumors of all histological types (20.Wang T.C.

Cyclin D1 overexpression is found at the earliest stages of breast cancer progression such as ductal carcinoma in situ and maintained in all stages of the metastasis (23.Joyce D. Bouzahzah B. Fu M. Albanese C. D'Amico M. Steer J. Klein J.U. Lee R.J. Segall J.E. Westwick J.K. Der C.J. Pestell R.G. J. Biol.

Accordingly, overexpression of murine mammary tumor virus-cyclin D1 in mammary glands leads to breast cancer (20.Wang T.C. Cardiff R.D. Zukerberg L. Lees A. Arnold A. Schmidt E.V. Nature. 1994; 369: 669-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). The expression of cyclin D1 is regulated by diverse signaling cascades. For example, growth factor-dependent growth stimulation of hematopoietic cells has been shown to be dependent on STAT5 regulation of the cyclin D1 promoter (21.Matsumura I. Kitamura T. Wakao H. Tanaka H. Hashimoto K. Albanese C. Downward J. Pestell R.G. Kanakura Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1367-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Also, NF-κB interaction with the NF-κB binding sites in the cyclin D1 promoter is required for cyclin D1 expression, leading to cell cycle progression. The small GTPase Rac1 signaling has been found to activate cyclin D1 transcription by means of an NF-κB-dependent pathway in murine NIH3T3 cells (22.Henry D.O. Moskalenko S.A. Kaur K.J. Fu M.

In addition, up-regulation of cyclin D1 by ERα signaling is accompanied by an increased proliferative response in breast cancer cells (24.Wilcken N.R. Prall O.W. Musgrove E.A. Sutherland R.L. Clin. Cancer Res. 1997; 3: 849-854PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Prall O.W. Rogan E.M. Musgrove E.A. Watts C.K. Sutherland R.L. Mol. Cell.

Up-regulation of cyclin D1 expression has also been found in hyperplastic mammary glands and proliferative human breast disease (28.Wang C. Pattabiraman N. Zhou J.N. Fu M. Sakamaki T. Albanese C.

Together, these observations suggest that cyclin D1 may constitute an important downstream target of diverse upstream signals, with a role in mammary gland development and tumorigenesis. Despite the widespread role of cyclin D1 in the biology of breast cancer, its involvement in Pak1 signaling, a common point of convergence of growth factor signaling in breast cancer cells, remains unknown. Here we investigated the role of Pak1 signaling pathways in the expression of cyclin D1 using breast cancer cell culture models and transgenic mice expressing activated Pak1 in mammary glands.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Cultures and Reagents—MCF-7 cells, MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells, HeLa cells, and endometrial Ishikawa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium F12 (1:1) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. HC11 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml). Antibodies were purchased from the following companies: anti-Pak1 from Cell Signaling, anti-cyclin D1 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, anti-vinculin from Sigma, and anti-HA from Roche Applied Science.Metabolic Labeling—MCF-7 cells constitutively expressing active Pak1 were grown to 50% confluency and were metabolically labeled with 20 μCi/ml of [35S]methionine for 24 h in a methionine-free medium containing 2% dialyzed fetal bovine serum in the absence or presence of doxycycline (Dox) (30.Kumar R. Mandal M. Ratzkin B.J. Liu N. Lipton A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 62: 102-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conditioned media with equal trichloroacetic acid precipitable counts were immunoprecipitated with the desired or control antibody, resolved on PAGE gels, and analyzed using autoradiography.Cell Extracts, Immunoprecipitation, Immunoblotting Assays—For preparation of cell extracts, cells were washed 3× with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaF, 200 mm NaVO5, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (GIBCO) for 15 min on ice. The lysates were centrifuged in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 4 °C for 15 min. Cell lysates containing equal amounts of protein were immunoprecipitated, resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with the appropriate antibodies using an ECL method.Northern Blotting—Total cytoplasmic RNA (20 μg) was analyzed by Northern blot analysis. Northern blots were probed with 32P-labeled cyclin D1 and Pak1 cDNA probe. Actin mRNA was used to assess the integrity of the RNA and to control for the RNA loading.Cyclin D1 Promoter-Reporter Assays—Subconfluent cells cultured in 6-well plates were transiently cotransfected with 1 μg of full-length cyclin D1 promoter-luciferase reporter construct (23.Joyce D. Bouzahzah B. Fu M. Albanese C. D'Amico M. Steer J. Klein J.U. Lee R.J. Segall J.E. Westwick J.K. Der C.J. Pestell R.G. J. Biol.

Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were lysed with passive lysis buffer, and luciferase assay was performed using luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI). β-galactosidase activity was used to normalize the transfection. Each transfection was performed in triplicate wells (31.Mazumdar A. Wang R.A. Mishra S.K. Adam L. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Mandal M. Vadlamudi R.K. Kumar R. Nat. Cell. Bio. 2001; 3: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar).Transgenic Studies—Generation of transgenic mice expressing constitutively kinase active T423E Pak1 has been described previously (19.Wang R.A. Mazumdar A. Vadlamudi R.K. Kumar R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5437-5447Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar).Short Interference RNA (siRNA) Design and Treatment—For Pak1 siRNA, the siRNA was synthesized by using the silencer siRNA construction kit (Ambion, Texas) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The Pak1 targeted sequences were described earlier (19.Wang R.A. Mazumdar A. Vadlamudi R.K. Kumar R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5437-5447Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar).Immunofluorescence and Confocal Imaging—Cells were plated on glass coverslips in 6-well culture plates and treated with or without Dox. After 24 h, the cells were rinsed in PBS, fixed in cold 100% methanol for 10 min, processed for immunofluorescent localization of cyclin D1 and HA-tagged Pak1 or cyclin D1 and F-actin (using Alexa-568-labeled phalloidin, Molecular Probes). The DNA was visualized by counter-staining with ToPro3. Fluorescent labeling was visualized by using a Zeiss LSM 510 microscope and a 63× objective.Immunohistochemistry—For immunohistochemical detection of cyclin D1 and Pak1 sections were deparaffinized with xylene and rehydrated using graded ethanol. Sections were incubated in 0.3% H2O2 and methanol for 30 min to inactivate endogenous peroxidase. The sections were then boiled for 10 min in 0.01 m citrate buffer and cooled for 30 min at room temperature to expose antigenic epitopes. The sections were incubated with 2% normal goat serum in 1% bovine serum albumin, PBS for 30 min. The sections were incubated with a mouse-cyclin D1 (1:25 diluted in 2% normal goat serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, and PBS) at a dilution of 1:50 in breast tumor arrays, and with Pak1 at 1:25 dilution and incubated overnight and at room temperature. The sections were washed three times with 0.05% Tween in PBS for 10 min, incubated with secondary antibody, developed with DAB-H2O2, and then counter-stained with Mayer's hematoxylin. Negative controls were performed by replacing the primary antibody with corresponding IgG.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONPak1 Regulates Cyclin D1 Expression in a Transgenic Model—In an attempt to define the role of Pak1 in the mammary gland, we recently demonstrated that overexpression of a kinase-active T423E Pak1 transgene in the murine mammary gland leads to a widespread hyperplasia (19.Wang R.A. Mazumdar A. Vadlamudi R.K. Kumar R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5437-5447Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Because cyclin D1 overexpression in the mammary tissues has been reported to cause hyperplasia (28.Wang C. Pattabiraman N. Zhou J.N. Fu M. Sakamaki T. Albanese C. Li Z. Wu K. Hulit J. Neumeister P. Novikoff P.M. Brownlee M. Scherer P.E. Jones J.G. Whitney K.D. Donehower L.A. Harris E.L. Rohan T. Johns D.C. Pestell R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6159-6173Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 29.Michaelson J.S. Leder P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5093-5099Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and the finding that Rac, an upstream effector of Pak1, regulates cyclin D1 transcription activity (23.Joyce D. Bouzahzah B. Fu M. Albanese C. D'Amico M. Steer J. Klein J.U. Lee R.J. Segall J.E. Westwick J.K. Der C.J. Pestell R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25245-25249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that Pak1 might also regulate cyclin D1 expression. Therefore, we explored the possibility of involvement of cyclin D1 in the action of Pak1 by examining the status of cyclin D1 expression in mammary glands from T423E transgenic and stage-matched wild-type mice. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a background level of cyclin D1 staining in wild-type mammary glands. In contrast, mammary epithelium from T423E Pak1 transgenic mice exhibited an intense cyclin D1 nuclear staining (Fig. 1A). Quantitation of signals in three independent transgenic lines indicated an ∼5- to 7-fold-increased expression of cyclin D1 in T423E-Pak1 transgenic mammary glands (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that hyperplasia in mammary glands of Pak1-TG mice may be associated, at least in part, with the potential up-regulation of cyclin D1.Overexpression of Pak1 in Breast Tumors—To assess the significance of Pak1 in breast cancer, we next determined the status of Pak1 expression in breast tumor specimens. We performed immunohistochemical staining of Pak1 and cyclin D1 in tumor arrays containing 60 breast cancer sections. Overexpression of Pak1 was observed in 34 tumors (55%) and cyclin D1 in 42 tumors (70%). Subcellular localization of Pak1 was variable. Of the 34 Pak1-positive tumors, an intense Pak1 cytoplasmic staining was observed in 19 tumors (56%) (Fig. 2A), nuclear staining in 5 tumors (15%) (Fig. 2B), and both nuclear and cytoplasmic Pak1 immunoreactivity in 10 breast tumor specimens (29%) (Fig. 2C). Pak1 expression also correlated well with the overall cyclin D1 expression in about 40% of tumors. Representative examples of co-expression of Pak1 and cyclin D1 in the same tumor specimen are shown in Fig. 2 (I-L).Fig. 2Pak1 and cyclin D1 expression in breast tumors.

Bouzahzah B. Fu M. Albanese C. D'Amico M. Steer J. Klein J.U. Lee R.J. Segall J.E. Westwick J.K. Der C.J. Pestell R.G. J. Biol.

Cotransfection of WTPak1 or T423E Pak1 in murine normal mammary epithelial HC11 cells stimulated transcription from the cyclin D1 promoter as compared with the transcription driven by control vector (Fig. 3). The stimulatory effect of Pak1 signaling on the cyclin D1 promoter was a wide-spread phenomenon, as WT-Pak1 or T423E Pak1 efficiently stimulated cyclin D1 promoter activity in invasive breast cancer MDA-MB-231, cervical cancer HeLa, and in well differentiated endometrial Ishikawa cells (Fig. 3). Together, these results implied a role of the Pak1 pathway in the expression of cyclin D1.Fig. 3Effect of Pak1 signaling on cyclin D1 promoter activity. C, HC11, MDA-MB-231, HeLa, and Ishikawa cells were cotransfected with 0.5 μg of -1745 cyclin D1-luciferase reporter with or without 0.5 μg of Pak1-T423E or plasmid cytomegalovirus. After 24 h, the cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was measured (n = 3). Activity was normalized with β-galactosidase activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effect of Kinase-Active T423E Pak1 on Cyclin D1 Expression—To further implicate a regulatory role for Pak1 signaling in the regulation of cyclin D1 expression, we next used a previously characterized MCF-7 breast cancer cell clone expressing HA-tagged-T423E Pak1 under the control of an inducible tetracycline promoter (15.Vadlamudi R.K.

As expected, induced expression of HA-tagged T423E-Pak1 in MCF-7 cells stimulated transcription from the cyclin D1 promoter-luciferase reporter (Fig. 4A). The increased expression of kinase-active Pak1 in MCF-7 cells was also accompanied by elevated steady-state levels of cyclin D1 mRNA (Fig. 4B) and cyclin D1 protein (Fig. 4C), as well as in the levels of newly synthesized metabolic-labeled 35S-cyclin D1 level (Fig. 4D). To gain clues about the functional consequence of Pak1-mediated increased expression of cyclin D1, we determined the subcellular distribution of cyclin D1 in MCF-7 cells expressing kinase-active Pak1 by quantitative confocal scanning microscopy. After 24 h of Dox treatment, both Pak1 and cyclin D1 protein expression were greatly induced, with the majority of cyclin D1 accumulating in the nucleus. (Fig. 5A). Quantitation of cellular localization of cyclin D1 upon Pak1 signaling is presented in Fig. 5B. The observed nuclear accumulation of cyclin D1 seems to be due to increased cyclin D1 expression as well as to increased levels of phosphorylated cyclin D1 in MCF-7 cells with a hyperactivated Pak1 pathway (Fig. 5C). Taken together, these results suggest that Pak1 signaling regulates the expression of cyclin D1 and that Pak1 may be an important mediator of upstream signals leading to cyclin D1 expression.Fig. 4Pak1 signaling regulates the cyclin D1 promoter activity and cyclin D1 expression. A, MCF-7/T423E and MCF-7/vector cells were transfected with cyclin D1-luciferase for determination of luciferase activity. The expression of HA-tagged T423E Pak1 expression is shown (inset).

Little is known concerning the function of the WFS1 protein (wolframin). Endoglycosidase H digestion, immunocytochemistry, and subcellular fractionation studies all indicated that wolframin is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum in rat brain hippocampus and rat pancreatic islet β-cells, and after ectopic expression in Xenopus oocytes.

Inositol triphosphate was capable of activating channels in the fused bilayers that were similar to channel components induced by wolframin expression. Expression of wolframin also increased cytosolic calcium levels in oocytes. Wolframin thus appears to be important in the regulation of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis.

These expression sites correlate well with the atrophic changes associated with the syndrome. diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy disorder Wolfram syndrome 1 gene or protein inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate microfarad(s) picosiemen(s) endoplasmic reticulum modified Barth's saline transient receptor potential vallinoid-like human embryonic kidney. It was suggested that wolframin may be a mitochondrial protein (8Bu X. Rotter I.J. Lancet. 1993; 342: 598-600Abstract PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), because many of the clinical features characteristic of this syndrome are similar to defects in oxidative phosphorylation that are seen in mitochondrial diseases, such as MELAS (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike symptoms), Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, and maternally inherited diabetes and deafness (mitochondrial diabetes). Supporting this hypothesis, deletions of mitochondrial DNA have been reported in some Wolfram patients (9Barrientos A. Casademont J. Saiz A. Cardellach F. Volpini V. Solans A. Tolosa E. Urbano-Marquez A. Estivill X. Nunes V. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 58: 963-970PubMed Google Scholar). However, recent reports have provided direct evidence to refute this hypothesis (10Barrett T.G.

Shinoda K. Oka Y. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 477-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Various homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations, including nonsense, frame-shift, deletion, insertion, and missense mutations were identified in Wolfram patients without revealing a clear relation between these mutations and phenotype (12Awata T.

Although Wolfram syndrome is rare, heterozygous carriers have been reported as 26 times more likely to require hospitalization for depression and psychiatric illness, leading to the hypothesis that heterozygosity for WFS1 gene mutations may be a significant cause of psychiatric illness in the general population (13Swift R.G. Polymeropoulos M.H. Torres R. Swift M. Mol. Psychiatry. 1998; 3: 86-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar).

Recently, several single amino acid mutations associated with Wolfram's disease have been associated with type 2 diabetes in non-Wolfram patients (2Hardy C. Khanim F. Torres R. Scott-Brown M.

A recent report has shown that wolframin is localized to the ER when overexpressed in cultured fibroblasts (11Takeda K. Inoue H. Tanizawa Y. Matsuzaki Y. Oba J. Watanabe Y. Shinoda K. Oka Y. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 477-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). This localization suggests that wolframin may play an as yet undefined role in membrane trafficking, secretion, processing, and/or regulation of ER calcium homeostasis. Rapid but controlled redistribution of intracellular calcium is central in signaling, secretion, and apoptosis in all eukaryotic cells (15Granville D.J. Ruehlmann D.O. Choy J.C.

The unfolded protein response and calcium regulation are well defined ER functions that have been shown to play prominent roles in cellular apoptosis (23Patil C. Walter P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 24Ferri K.F. Kroemer G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E255-E263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar, 25Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4491) Google Scholar). Calcium release and uptake by the ER are fundamental to calcium regulation but are thus far only partially understood (25Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4491) Google Scholar). Based on the pathophysiology of the syndrome, it appears reasonable that wolframin may be somehow involved in the survival pathways of pancreatic islet β-cells and neurons (26Gerbitz K.-D. Diabetologia. 1999; 42: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The presence of 9–10 predicted transmembrane segments in wolframin suggested that it might function in the transport of ions or other small molecules across membranes. In the present study, we conducted a series of experiments to test this hypothesis. Immunohistochemical studies of the rat pancreas confirmed that wolframin is primarily localized in the islet β-cells, present at low levels in α-cells and absent from the exocrine tissue. We demonstrate that ectopic expression of wolframin in Xenopus oocytes results in its strict localization to the endoplasmic reticulum, consistent with the subcellular localization of the native protein in mammalian cells. Expression of wolframin in oocytes produced an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ and induced novel cation-selective channel activities in ER membranes. Given that Ca2+ regulation by the ER is prominent in cellular apoptosis, these data suggest that wolframin may be involved in the regulation of ER-mediated cellular mortality and that a defect in this regulatory process is the cause of the progressive β-cell loss and neuronal degeneration associated with the disease. Antibody directed against WFS1 was generated using a synthetic peptide corresponding to the 20 N-terminal amino acids of WFS1 coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin via an N-terminal cysteine residue. Immunization of rabbits and production of antiserum was conducted by Charles River Laboratories (Southbridge, MA) according to their standard protocols. IgG was purified from the rabbit antiserum using protein A-agarose. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were carried out after transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose membranes (MSI, Westborough, MA). 125I-Labeled goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (at 1:500 dilution, Amersham Biosciences) was used as the secondary antibody. Signals were visualized by autoradiography. Full-length human WFS1 cDNA was subcloned into the oocyte expression vector pSP64T. Xenopus laevis or Xenopus tropicalis oocytes were isolated and prepared for injection according to published methods (27Garcia J.C. Strube M. Leingang K. Keller K. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7770-7776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, stage V to VI oocytes were isolated from excised ovaries and treated with 2 mg/ml type II collagenase (Sigma) in modified Barth's saline (MBS) for 15 min at room temperature, washed extensively in MBS supplemented with 5% bovine serum albumin, and maintained in MBS plus bovine serum albumin at 18 °C for all subsequent procedures. After an overnight incubation, healthy oocytes lacking a vitellin layer were selected using a dissecting microscope. WFS1 mRNA was prepared from BglII-linearized pSP64T. In vitro transcription was performed using SP6 RNA polymerase system (Promega). Oocytes were injected with 50 nl of water (sham) or 50 ng of cRNA and then incubated for 3 days at 18 °C before analysis. N-Glycanase Digestion—Thirty μg of intracellular membranes purified from oocytes and 50 μg of rat brain hippocampal tissue lysate were solubilized in 1% SDS, adjusted to a final concentration of 0.25% SDS, 1.9% Nonidet P-40, 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 25 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and then digested with 0.25 units of N-glycanase (Enzyme, Boston, MA) overnight at 37 °C. Endoglycosidase H Digestion—Xenopus oocyte intracellular membranes and rat brain hippocampal tissue lysate were digested with endoglycosidase H overnight at 37 °C in a 25-μl total reaction volume containing 0.5 liters of 3 m sodium acetate, pH 5.5, and 0.3 milliunits of enzyme (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). All membranes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting as described above. Frozen thin sections of oocyte were prepared as described previously (27Garcia J.C. Strube M. Leingang K. Keller K. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7770-7776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and HEK293 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Thin sections and cell monolayers were analyzed by laser confocal immunofluorescence microscopy using protein A-agarose-purified anti-WFS1 antibody (1:100 dilution) and fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:500 dilution) (Cappel, Durham, NC). Rat pancreas sections were prepared, and immunohistochemical analysis was performed as described previously (28Shinoda K. Mon S. Ohtsuki T. Osawa Y. J. Comp. Neuron. 1992; 322: 360-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, rats were killed by decapitation and pancreata were removed. Pancreata were fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin for serial sectioning (5 μm thickness). Antigen unmasking was performed by treating the tissue sections in 10 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0, at 95 °C for 5 min. Tissue sections were incubated with anti-WFS1 and mouse anti-BiP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) antibodies at 1:50 dilution for 1 h at room temperature in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% goat serum, then with secondary antibodies (Alexa 594 goat anti-rabbit IgG, Alexa 488 goat anti-mouse IgG) (1:500 dilution; Molecular Probes). For detection of WFS1 in pancreatic islets, sections were processed by a modification of the indirect immunoperoxidase method (29Humason G.L. Animal Tissue Techniques. The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore1997: 361-378Google Scholar), using mouse anti-insulin and anti-glucagon primary antibodies (1:500, Sigma) and the anti-WFS1 antibody followed by incubation with the secondary antibody as described. Fluorescence was detected using a Bio-Rad MRC-600 laser scanning confocal microscope. X. tropicalis oocytes were placed in a tissue chamber on the stage of an inverted fluorescence microscope (Axiovert 100M, Zeiss, Lambda 10-Z, Sutter Instrument Co.). Free cytosolic calcium was determined by incubating Xenopus oocytes with fura-2 AM (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at room temperature. Each oocyte was then exposed to 340 and 380 nm excitation wavelengths, respectively. The filter control and data acquisition were carried out using Slidebook, version 3.0.4.9 (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Cambridge, MA). The excitation light passed through a 10× objective lens to the oocyte through a dichroic mirror. All experiments were carried out at room temperature. Ca2+concentrations were determined by converting the 340 nm/380 nm fura-2 fluorescence ratios to free [Ca2+] using in situ calibration with Ca2+-EGTA standards (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). X. laevis oocytes were injected with cRNA from either wild-type or mutant (I269S, R456H) WFS cDNA, and ER membranes were prepared as described previously (30Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7610-7618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, after collagenase treatment, oocytes were rinsed five times with 5 volumes of H/K buffer (90 mm KCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.1). Stage V–VI oocytes were selected, and the volume of packed oocytes was measured. All residual H/K buffer was removed, and a volume of ice-cold sucrose/H/K (40% sucrose weight/volume in H/K buffer containing 3 mm MgCl2) equal to the volume of the oocytes was added. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. The oocytes were gently broken open by passing the mixture through a 3.8-cm 19-gauge needle 10 times. The homogenate was centrifuged for 3 min at 3000 × g. The cloudy gray supernatant was then gently mixed and transferred to a fresh centrifuge tube, and the pellet was discarded. This process was repeated three times. The resulting milky white supernatant was mixed gently and diluted with 0.3 volume of cold H/K buffer. The microsomal membranes were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded and the membranes were resuspended in H/K buffer containing 3 mm MgCl2 and then either used directly for SDS-PAGE or stored at –80 °C for bilayer experiments. Planar lipid bilayers were prepared from azolectin type II (Sigma) according to published methods (31Schlesinger P. Gross A. Xin X. Yamamoto K. Saito M. Waksman G. Korsmeyer S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11357-11362Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). The lipids, 70% dioleylphosphatidylcholine and 30% dioleylphosphatidic acid, were dissolved in decane at 30 mg/ml and stored under nitrogen until use. Briefly, 2 μl of lipid solution was applied to 0.25-mm orifice of a polystyrene cuvette (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT), and the solvent was allowed to evaporate. The cuvette was then placed into a bilayer chamber and connected to a bilayer clamp (BC525-c; Warner Instruments) by Ag/AgCl electrodes via agar bridges. Data were collected using CLAMPEX 8.0 (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), archived on videotape using a Neurocorder DR-484 (Neuro Data Instruments, Delaware Water Gap, PA), and analyzed using ORIGIN (Microcal, Amherst, MA) and CLAMPFIT (Axon Instruments). Bilayers were formed by spreading with a polished glass rod and allowed to thin to a capacitance of 0.4 μF/cm2, at which point the noise was typically 0.2 pA and the leak conductance was 20 pS. The salt concentrations were initially 150 mm KCl in the cis and trans chamber and adjusted to a 450 mm in the cis chamber as indicated. Outward (positive) currents were defined as K+ moving cis to trans. All solutions were buffered to pH 7.0 with 10 mm K-HEPES. Oocyte microsomal membranes (10 μg of protein) were added to the cis chamber with mixing. To vary calcium concentration in the bilayer, EGTA and CaCl2were added. The MilliQ water employed for buffers in these studies averaged 30 μm Ca2+. When low calcium was required, 300 μm EGTA was added to the buffer, reducing the free calcium to less than 1 μm. High calcium was obtained by adding 100 μm CaCl2 to the buffer. All experimental protocols were approved by the Animal Studies Committee and conducted according to the Guidelines for Animal Research at Washington University School of Medicine. Generation and Characterization of Wolframin Antibody— Rabbits were immunized with a synthetic peptide corresponding to the 20 N-terminal amino acids of human wolframin. Characterization of the wolframin antiserum was conducted by immunoblot analysis using membranes from Xenopus oocytes injected with wolframin mRNA. The anti-wolframin antibody detected a distinct band migrating at a molecular mass of ∼100 kDa (Fig. 1A, lane 2). The observed band is consistent with the expected molecular mass of 100.29 kDa predicted from the hWFS1 cDNA. Specificity was confirmed by pre-incubation of the antibody with the wolframin immunizing peptide, which completely blocked the appearance of the 100-kDa band on the film (data not shown). The antibody also detected endogenous wolframin expressed in rat hippocampal tissue lysate (Fig. 2A, lane 3).Fig. 2Immunocytochemical localization of wolframin by laser confocal microscopy. Frozen thin sections were prepared from oocytes injected with WFS1 cRNA (A) or water (B) and then stained with WFS1 antibody as described under “Materials and Methods.” HEK293 cells were stained with WFS1 antibody in the absence (C) or presence (D) of a 100-fold molar excess of immunizing peptide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Wolframin Is Localized Exclusively to the Endoplasmic Reticulum Membrane—Previously published data suggested that wolframin is localized to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes when overexpressed in primary human fibroblasts (12Awata T. Inoue K. Kurihara S. Ohkubo T. Inoue I. Abe T. Takino H. Kanazawa Y. Katayama S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 612-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To confirm these data for endogenous wolframin and determine the subcellular distribution of wolframin after ectopic expression, total membranes from Xenopus oocytes (Fig. 1B, upper panel) and rat brain hippocampus (Fig. 1B, lower panel) were prepared. Digestion of these membranes with N-glycanase, an enzyme that cleaves N-linked oligosaccharides from proteins, or endoglycosidase H, an enzyme that cleaves only high mannose core oligosaccharides from glycosylated proteins, was conducted. Western blot analysis showed a shift in the electrophoretic mobility of wolframin after digestion with either glycosidase (Fig. 1B). These data indicate that the N-linked oligosaccharides of wolframin, in both native cells and after ectopic expression of the protein in oocytes, are not processed to a complex form. This result strongly suggests that wolframin is strictly confined to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. The intracellular localization of endogenous and ectopically expressed wolframin was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence microscopic analysis of frozen sections of Xenopus oocytes injected with wolframin cRNA, HEK293 cells, and rat pancreas. In oocytes, wolframin exhibited a granular cytoplasmic distribution, suggesting intracellular membrane labeling (Fig. 2A). Endogenous wolframin in HEK293 cells also demonstrated a granular cytoplasmic pattern, consistent with localization to intracellular membranes (Fig. 2C). Preadsorption of the WFS1 antibody with the immunizing peptide abolished labeling of pancreatic islet cells (Fig. 3, A–C). Interestingly, the β-cells of rat pancreatic islets stained strongly positive for wolframin (Fig. 3, D–F) and only slight staining was observed in the glucagon positive α-cells (Fig. 3, G–I). Double-labeling indirect immunofluorescence analysis using antibodies to wolframin and the ER marker, BiP, was consistent with the strict localization of wolframin to the ER (Fig. 3, J–L). These data confirm that wolframin is expressed predominantly, if not exclusively, in the endoplasmic reticulum in both native cell types and after ectopic expression in Xenopus oocytes. Expression of Wolframin Induces Specific Ion Channel Activity in Planar Bilayers Derived from Endoplasmic Reticulum Membranes of Xenopus Oocytes—The presence of predicted transmembrane segments, a very mild similarity to the pore region of the transient receptor potential (TRP)-caspasin channel family, and the lack of any other significant homology with a functional amino acid sequence suggested wolframin might be a novel cation channel in the ER membrane. Because of the strict localization of wolframin to the ER, it was necessary to use reconstitution into planar lipid bilayers to determine whether wolframin possessed channel activity. Microsomal membranes from control (sham-injected) and wolframin-expressing oocytes were studied in planar lipid bilayers using KCl salt solutions to determine how channel activity and its voltage dependence were affected by wolframin expression. The control membranes from four preparations, five preparations from wolframin-expressing oocytes, and two preparations expressing the mutant wolframin proteins were fused into bilayers a minimum of three times each, giving results that were qualitatively consistent. The magnitude of the currents from a fusion varied 5-fold, but several characteristics were reproducibly associated with wolframin expression and distinct from control membranes isolated from sham-injected oocytes. Single-channel records can be difficult to attain from isolated membrane fragments, and therefore the voltage dependence was determined from the mean current normalized to the mean current at zero applied potential in a KCl gradient, which allowed comparison between membrane preparations and individual fusions into bilayers. A short segment representing the currents observed in control membranes is shown in Fig. 4. We employed all points histograms to characterize the multichannel recordings that were observed in the reconstituted bilayers. An extensive summation of data from four membrane preparations yielding 2–8 min each of recording in a 450/150 mm KCl gradient is shown under the “untreated” heading. Under this trace is the voltage dependence summarized as an average from eight control bilayers. This series demonstrates that our membrane preparation contains a number of channels and that the normalization process allows the incorporation of data from separate experiments. In a KCl gradient, the control microsomes are dominated by inward currents representing chloride movement across the bilayer. We used the voltage dependence of these currents to study calcium and IP3 effects on these membrane preparations. When 100 μm Ca2+ was added to bilayers containing control membranes, the histogram indicated one open state with a conductance approximately double that of control membranes in the absence of Ca2+ (Fig. 4, 100 μm Ca2+). The addition of 100 nm IP3 also increased the bilayer currents, but with a small decrease in reversal potential (Fig. 4, 100 nm IP3). These observations are consistent with previous studies on endoplasmic reticulum but do not exclude some contamination by other membrane components (32Franco-Obrego A. Wang H. Clapham D.E. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 202-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 33Edwards J. Tulk B. Schlesinger P. J. Membr.

When microsomal membranes from oocytes expressing wolframin were studied in a 450/150 KCl gradient, strikingly different patterns were observed. Although the inward current patterns previously described were present in all membrane preparations, outward currents not seen in the controls were observed (Fig. 5). Wolframin-expressing membranes frequently displayed a conductance 5-fold larger than the examples shown here, but they were unstable and difficult to analyze. The histogram under the Wolframin heading in Fig. 5 is a summation of 20 min of recording in 10 membranes that had moderate to low conductance after fusion with membranes from wolframin-expressing oocytes. Routinely we saw multiple conductance levels in the outward currents and could identify two distinct phases of wolframin-associated channel activity. The large outward currents with mult"

To identify domains of Peri A that mediate these multiple actions, we introduced adenoviruses expressing truncated or mutated Peri A and HSL into NIH 3T3 fibroblasts lacking endogenous perilipins and HSL but overexpressing acyl-CoA synthetase 1 and fatty acid transporter 1. We identified two lipase-selective functional domains: 1) Peri A (amino acids 1–300), which inhibits basal lipolysis and promotes PKA-stimulated lipolysis by HSL, and 2) Peri A (amino acids 301–517), which inhibits basal lipolysis by non-HSL and promotes PKA-stimulated lipolysis by both HSL and non-HSL. PKA site mutagenesis revealed that PKA-stimulated lipolysis by HSL requires phosphorylation of one or more sites within Peri 1–300 (Ser81, Ser222, and Ser276). PKA-stimulated lipolysis by non-HSL additionally requires phosphorylation of one or more PKA sites within Peri 301–517 (Ser433, Ser492, and Ser517). Peri 301–517 promoted PKA-stimulated lipolysis by HSL yet did not block HSL-mediated basal lipolysis, indicating that an additional region(s) within Peri 301–517 promotes hormone-stimulated lipolysis by HSL. These results suggest a model of Peri A function in which 1) lipase-specific “barrier” domains block basal lipolysis by HSL and non-HSL, 2) differential PKA site phosphorylation allows PKA-stimulated lipolysis by HSL and non-HSL, respectively, and 3) additional domains within Peri A further facilitate PKA-stimulated lipolysis, again with lipase selectivity.

Res. 2001; 56: 309-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Activation of PKA results in a marked increase in lipolysis as compared with spontaneous lipolysis in the absence of hormones (basal or constitutive lipolysis). Thus, basal and PKA-stimulated lipolysis reflect the lipolytic response of adipocytes to the changing energy requirements of the body. In obesity, basal lipolysis is increased, and PKA-stimulated lipolysis is blunted (8Large V. Reynisdottir S. Langin D. Fredby K. Klannemark M. Holm C. Arner P. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 2059-2065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This dysregulation of adipocyte lipolysis is associated with the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (9Arner P. Trends Endocrinol.

TAG breakdown (lipolysis) is mediated by lipases, which hydrolyze TAG sequestered in intracellular lipid droplets. Approximately 50% of the neutral triglyceride lipase activity in white adipose tissue is attributable to hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) (10Haemmerle G. Zimmerman R. Hayn M. Theussl C. Waeg G.

Thus, both HSL and non-HSL(s) play important roles in basal and PKA-stimulated lipolysis. The hydrolytic actions of HSL and non-HSLs are regulated at the lipid droplet surface by perilipins, a family of lipid droplet-associated phosphoproteins (24Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Dwyer N.K.

Peri A and Peri B are the predominant isoforms of murine adipocytes, with Peri A constituting ∼85% of total perilipin. Derived from alternative splicing of a single gene, Peri A and Peri B share a common N-terminal region of 1–405 amino acids (aa) but possess unique C termini (26Greenberg A. Egan J. Wek S. Moos J.

Peri A therefore functions as both a suppressor of basal lipolysis and as an enhancer of PKA-stimulated lipolysis. The functions of Peri B are less defined. How does the dual function of perilipin in regulating lipolyis arise from perilipin protein structure? Recent data have suggested a model of Peri A function in which the phosphorylation of N-terminal PKA sites (PKA1, PKA2, and PKA3; Fig. 1) promotes PKA-stimulated lipolysis (22Souza S. Muliro K.

Huml A.M. Vogt R. Davis K.E. Jones J.M. Fraser K.A. Brasaemle D.L. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8401-8406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In contrast, novel data in the present study identify multiple, lipase-selective domains within Peri A that function coordinately to regulate basal and stimulated lipolysis. Our data support a model of perilipin function in which 1) discrete lipase-selective protein domains of perilipin act as barriers to HSL and non-HSL(s), respectively, 2) phosphorylation of different PKA sites allows PKA-stimulated lipolysis mediated by HSL and non-HSL(s), respectively, and 3) additional “facilitative” domains within Peri A enhance PKA-stimulated lipolysis, again with lipase selectivity. A polyclonal antibody (MSM) specific for the N terminus of Peri A was generated using an N-terminal peptide (aa 1–21, MSMNKGPTLLDGDLPEQENVL). A polyclonal antibody (PREK) specific for the C terminus of Peri A was generated using a C-terminal peptide (aa 483–517, PREKPARRVSDSFFRPSVC). A polyclonal anti-HSL antibody was generated using a peptide based upon the rat HSL sequence KDLSFKGNSEPSDSPEM. The antibodies were subsequently affinity-purified and used for Western blotting (1:1000). Tissue culture reagents and media were purchased from Invitrogen. LipofectAMINE Plus™ reagent was purchased from Invitrogen. Horseradish-linked anti-rabbit IgG was from Amersham Biosciences; SuperSignal® Chemiluminescent Substrate was obtained from Pierce. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Generation of Truncation and Mutational Constructs of Peri A—Truncations and mutations of Peri A constructed for the study are shown in Fig. 1. A C-terminal deletion expressing 1–300 aa of Peri A (Peri 1–300) was generated by PCR amplification of mouse Peri A cDNA using a 5′-primer containing a BglII restriction site (5′-GCG TCT GCC AGA TCT AGC TGC TTT CTC-3′) and a 3′-primer that contains a KpnI restriction site and a FLAG epitope tag sequence: 5′-CTC TTC GGT ACC TCA CTT ATC GTC GTC ATC CTT GTA ATC TGT GTC TGT CTG GTC GTC ATG-3′. N-terminal deletions of Peri A were generated by PCR amplification of a cDNA that encodes Peri A-FLAG. A common 3′-primer containing a SalI restriction site (5′-CGA CCT GTC GAC TCA CTT ATC GTC GTC-3′) and the following 5′-primers containing a BglII restriction site and the Kozak translation initiation sequence were used: Peri 142–517, 5′-AGC ATC AGT GTG CCC ATT GCA AGA TCT TCC ACC ATG GTT CTG GGG GCC ACT CTG GCC-3′; Peri 201–517, 5′-GTA GAG TTC CTC CTG CCA CCA GAC AGA TCT TCC ACC ATG TCT TCC GGA CGG CAG AGG ACC-3′; Peri 233–517, 5′-GTA GAG TTC CTC CTG CCA CCA GAC AGA TCT TCC ACC TG TCT TCC GGA CGG CAG AGG ACC-3′; Peri 251–517, 5′-GCC CTG AAG CAG GGC CAC TCT AGA TCT ACC ACC ATG CCG GGT GTG GCA CCC CTG AGC AGC-3′; and Peri 301–517, 5′-GCC TCT CAG GAT GAG AGC CAT GAC AGA TCT ACC ACC ATG GAG GGA GAG GAG ACA GAC GAC-3′. Mutagenesis of six putative PKA recognition sites was carried out using Muta-Gene Phagemid in vitro mutagenesis version 2 (Bio-Rad). Mutations of serines to alanines were made in a set of all six sites or in sets of three by grouping the three N-terminal PKA sites as PKA cassette 1 (Ser81, Ser222, and Ser276) and the three C-terminal PKA sites as PKA cassette 2 (Ser433, Ser492, and Ser517). Primers used for mutagenesis were as follows: sequences for Ser81, PKA 1 (5′-GTC CGT CGG CTG GCC ACC CAG TTC ACA GC-3′); Ser222, PKA2 (5′-TTT TGA GGA GGG TCG CCA CCC TGG CCA ACAC TC-3′); Ser276, PKA3 (5′-CCC GGC GGC AGG CTG AGG TGC-3′); Ser433, PKA4 (5′-CAG CAG AGG CGG AGC GCA AAG GGG CCG GGG CGC GG-3′); Ser492, PKA5 (5′-CCT GCG CGC AGA GTC GCC GAC ACG TTC TTC CGG-3′); and Ser517, PKA6 (5′-GCC AGC TGC GCA AGA AGG CCT GAG CAG ACT GCG CC-3′). The identity of each of the truncations and mutated PKA sites was confirmed by sequencing. The cDNAs were used to generate adenoviruses. Generation of Recombinant Adenoviruses—Adenoviruses expressing β-galactosidase (Ad β-gal), the Aequoria Victoria green fluorescent protein (Ad GFP), Peri A (Ad Peri A), Peri B (Ad Peri B), and HSL (Ad HSL) were generated as described previously (22Souza S. Muliro K. Liscum L. Lien P. Yamamoto Y. Schaffer J. Dallal G. Wang X. Kraemer F. Obin M. Greenberg A. J. Biol.

Adenoviruses expressing 1–300 aa of Peri A (Ad 1–300) and N-terminal PKA site-mutated Peri A (Ad Peri AΔ123) were constructed using the two-cosmid system (32Wang Z. Zeng W. Murakawa M. Freeman M. Seed B. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 11296-11303Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) in which perilipin cDNAs were subcloned into BglII-KpnI-opened pLEP-CMV vector. Adenoviruses expressing the C-terminal regions of Peri A (Ad 142–517, Ad 201–517, Ad 233–517, Ad 251–517, and Ad 301–517) and PKA site-mutated Peri A (Ad Peri AΔ456 and Ad Peri AΔ1–6) were generated using the AdEasy™ adenoviral vector system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). In brief, perilipin cDNAs were subcloned into pShuttle-CMV vector cleaved with BglII and SalI. The expression vector was linearized with PmeI and co-transformed into BJ5183 bacterial cells with supercoiled viral DNA plasmid pAdEasy. Recombinant plasmid DNA was then used to transfect HEK293 cells in which deleted viral assembly genes were complemented. Adenoviral amplification was performed as described (22Souza S. Muliro K.

Adenovirus-mediated Expression of Perilipins and HSL—Adenoviruses expressing truncated/mutated Peri A and HSL were expressed in ACS1/FATP1 cells (kindly provided by Dr. Jean E. Schaffer from Washington University, St. Louis, MO). ACS1/FATP1 are NIH 3T3 fibroblasts that are engineered to stably overexpress acyl-CoA synthetase 1 (ACS1) and long chain fatty acid (FA) transport protein 1 (FATP1) (33Gargilulo C. Stuhlsatz-Krouper S. Schaffer J. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 881-892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These cells were selected for use because 1) they lack endogenous perilipins and HSL, and 2) overexpression of ACS1/FATP1 stimulates FA import and substantial TAG accumulation in lipid droplets (22Souza S. Muliro K. Liscum L. Lien P. Yamamoto Y. Schaffer J. Dallal G. Wang X. Kraemer F. Obin M. Greenberg A. J. Biol.

These features make ACS1/FATP1 cells powerful tools for elucidating the relative roles of adenovirally expressed perilipins in HSL and non-HSL(s)-mediated lipolysis. ACS1/FATP1 cells in confluent cultures were transduced with either Ad Control (Ad GFP or Ad β-gal) to control for nonspecific effects of adenoviral infection or Ad HSL in combination with adenoviruses expressing various perilipins. Transduction was performed as described (22Souza S. Muliro K. Liscum L. Lien P. Yamamoto Y. Schaffer J. Dallal G. Wang X. Kraemer F. Obin M. Greenberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8267-8272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). To minimize differences in the expression levels of HSL and perilipins among samples and assays, each adenovirus was pretitered, and an optimal titer was maintained thereafter to transduce ACS1/FATP1 cells. The optimal titer for Ad HSL was defined as the titer that maximally increased basal lipolysis, which could be inhibited by Peri A (22Souza S. Muliro K. Liscum L. Lien P. Yamamoto Y. Schaffer J.

The optimal titers for adenoviruses expressing various perilipins were chosen so that all these perilipins were expressed at similar levels. FA Loading—Transduced ACS1/FATP1 cells were incubated for 48 h of incubation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5 mm glucose, 10% calf serum, and 1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin bound to palmitic and oleic acid (240 μm each). Incubation was terminated by removing lipid loading medium and washing cells with phosphate-buffered saline. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy was performed (22Souza S. Muliro K. Liscum L. Lien P. Yamamoto Y. Schaffer J. Dallal G. Wang X. Kraemer F. Obin M. Greenberg A. J.

MSM antibody (1:100 dilution) was used to immunolocalize Peri A, Peri B, and Peri 1–300. PREK antibody (1:100) was used to localize Peri A, N-terminally deleted Peri A, and PKA site-mutated Peri A. Alexa Fluor 637-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) was used to visualize perilipin staining. Bodipy 493/503 (Molecular Probes) was used at 10 μg/ml to visualize neutral lipid staining (34Garcia A. Sekowski A. Subramanian V. Brasaemle D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 625-635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Lipolysis—After transduction and 48 h of incubation with FA, the ACS1/FATP1 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and treated for 4 h with or without a PKA activator, forskolin (20 μm) (35Laurenza A., K.Y. De Souza N.J. Rupp R.H. Metzger H. Seamon K.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1987; 32: 133-139PubMed Google Scholar), in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5 mm glucose, 2% FA-free bovine serum albumin. The medium was collected, and glycerol was measured as an index of lipolysis as described (22Souza S. Muliro K. Liscum L. Lien P. Yamamoto Y. Schaffer J. Dallal G. Wang X. Kraemer F. Obin M.

Western Blotting—The cellular proteins were extracted and quantified as described (36Souza S.C. Yamamoto M. Franciosa M. Lien P. Greenberg A. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 691-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The total lysates (10 μg/sample) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (37Zhang H. Halbleib M. Ahmed F.

The data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance using Graph-Pad InStat Software (version 2.04a, Neoptolemos, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK). Multiple comparisons were performed with Tukey's honestly significant differences procedure. p values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Localization of Truncated and Mutated Perilipins on the Lipid Droplet Surface—ACS1/FATP1 cells were transduced with adenoviruses expressing either Peri A, Peri A truncations, Peri B (a naturally occurring Peri A truncation), or Peri A PKA site mutants. Because association with the lipid droplet membrane is a prerequisite for the ability of perilipin to regulate lipolysis, we initially assessed the ability of these perilipin constructs to target to and associate with lipid droplets. Transduced cells were fixed and prepared for confocal microscopy after incubation with FA for 48 h. Simultaneous fluorescent detection of neutral lipids and perilipins allowed us to correlate immunoreactivity with intracellular structure (Fig. 2). Neutral lipids were stained with Bodipy (red fluorescence). Perilipins were detected with specific antibodies directed against the N or C terminus of Peri A (green fluorescence). Immunostaining for Peri 1–300, Peri 142–517, Peri 233–517, Peri 251–517, and Peri 301–517 revealed a ring-like pattern that was similarly observed with Peri A and Peri B (Fig. 2). The distinct perilipin rings appear localizing around the perimeters of lipid droplets as shown in the overlay of perlilipin and lipid staining. Coincident staining of perilipin and neutral lipid (yellow color) was also evident in the overlay. These staining patterns are clearly distinct from the diffuse cytoplasmic staining observed with Peri 1–200, which serves as a negative control for perilipin association with lipid droplets. Thus, Peri 1–300 and N-terminal truncated Peri A retain the ability to target and associate with lipid droplets. Mutation of PKA phosphorylation sites had no effect on the ability of Peri A to target and associate with lipid droplets, because Peri AΔ123, Peri AΔ456, and Peri AΔ1–6 all localized to the surface of lipid droplets (data not shown). No perilipin immunoreactivity was evident in control cells lacking perilipin expression constructs (data not shown).

https://openalex.org/W1988750758,"Fatty acid synthesis in bacteria is catalyzed by a set of individual enzymes collectively known as type II fatty-acid synthase. Each enzyme interacts with acyl carrier protein (ACP), which shuttles the pathway intermediates between the proteins. The type II enzymes do not possess primary sequence similarity that defines a common ACP-binding site, but rather are hypothesized to possess an electropositive/hydrophobic surface feature that interacts with the electronegative/hydrophobic residues along helix α2 of ACP (Zhang, Y.-M., Marrakchi, H., White, S. W., and Rock, C. O. (2003) J. Lipid Res. 44, 1-10). We tested this hypothesis by mutating two surface residues, Arg-129 and Arg-172, located in a hydrophobic patch adjacent to the active site entrance on β-ketoacyl-ACP reductase (FabG). Enzymatic analysis showed that the mutant enzymes were compromised in their ability to utilize ACP thioester substrates but were fully active in assays with a substrate analog. Direct binding assays and competitive inhibition experiments showed that the FabG mutant proteins had reduced affinities for ACP. Chemical shift perturbation protein NMR experiments showed that FabG-ACP interactions occurred along the length of ACP helix α2 and extended into the adjacent loop-2 region to involve Ile-54. These data confirm a role for the highly conserved electronegative/hydrophobic residues along ACP helix α2 in recognizing a constellation of Arg residues embedded in a hydrophobic patch on the surface of its partner enzymes, and reveal a role for the loop-2 region in the conformational change associated with ACP binding. The specific FabG-ACP interactions involve the most conserved ACP residues, which accounts for the ability of ACPs and the type II proteins from different species to function interchangeably.

Fatty acid biosynthesis in bacteria and plants is carried out by a series of enzymes that are collectively known as the type II fatty-acid synthase and is most extensively studied in the Escherichia coli system (1Heath R.J.

The acyl intermediates are attached to the terminal sulfhydryl of the 4′-phosphopantetheine prosthetic group (8Prescott D.J. Vagelos P.R. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1972; 36: 269-311PubMed Google Scholar), which is attached via a phosphodiester linkage to Ser-36 located at the beginning of the second helical segment. The primary gene product is an apoprotein that is converted to ACP by the transfer of the 4′-phosphopantetheine moiety of CoA to Ser-36 by [ACP]synthase (AcpS) (9Flugel R.S. Hwangbo Y. Lambalot R.H.

First, it sequesters the growing acyl chain from the aqueous environment, and second, upon binding to one of the type II proteins, it releases its grip on the fatty acid, which is inserted into the active site cavity of the enzyme. ACPs are widely distributed in nature and are easily recognized by their significant primary sequence identity, particularly at the prosthetic group attachment site and extending along helix α2 (11Zhang Y.-M. Marrakchi H. White S.W. Rock C.O. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These similarities are thought to underlie the observation that ACPs from virtually any source are substrates for AcpS and function with the fatty acid biosynthetic enzymes of E. coli (11Zhang Y.-M. Marrakchi H. White S.W. Rock C.O. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, the individual enzymes of type II fatty acid synthesis do not share a primary structure motif that would define the presence of a common ACP-binding motif. acyl carrier protein fatty acid biosynthesis enzyme β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III β-ketoacyl-ACP reductase malonyl-CoA:ACP transacylase holo[ACP]synthase. acyl carrier protein fatty acid biosynthesis enzyme β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III β-ketoacyl-ACP reductase malonyl-CoA:ACP transacylase holo[ACP]synthase. The molecular details that govern the specific interactions between ACP and the type II enzymes are poorly known. The analysis of the binding of ACP to FabH points to ionic interactions playing a determinant role in the interaction between these two proteins (12Zhang Y.-M. Rao M.S. Heath R.J. Price A.C.

This study used a computational algorithm to dock the NMR structure of E. coli ACP to FabH. ACP was predicted to dock to a hydrophobic patch with embedded positively charged residues adjacent to the active site tunnel. Kinetic analysis and direct binding studies between FabH mutants and ACP confirmed the importance of the positively charged residues to the FabH-ACP interaction. Several ACP mutants have been made, and their ability to function in type II fatty acid synthesis has been assessed (13Flaman A.S. Chen J.M. Van Iderstine S.C. Byers D.M. J. Biol.

These data are consistent with the conclusion that residues along ACP helix α2, such as Glu-41 and Glu-48, are important for ACP function, although the binding of ACP to individual components in the crude extracts used in this work was not addressed. One surprise that emerged from this body of work was the importance of Ile-54 for ACP function. Ile-54 lies in the loop region between helices α2 and α3, and whether this highly conserved amino acid has a role in docking or acyl chain binding is unknown. Somers and co-workers (10Parris K.D. Lin L. Tam A. Mathew R. Hixon J. Stahl M. Fritz C.C. Seehra J. Somers W.S. Structure. 2000; 8: 883-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) determined the crystal structure of ACP from Bacillus subtilis in complex with AcpS. The contacts between ACP and AcpS are predominantly ionic occurring between the positively charged residues of AcpS helix α1 and the negatively charged residues of ACP helix α2. The hydrophobic residues on ACP helix α2 (Met-44 and Ala-45) are complemented by hydrophobic counterparts on AcpS. Thus, the AcpS-ACP structure provides direct support for the hypothesis that the conserved helix α2 (“recognition helix”) of ACP functions as a universal protein interaction domain (11Zhang Y.-M. Marrakchi H. White S.W. Rock C.O. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This study explores the recognition helix hypothesis with a second enzyme of type II fatty acid synthesis by examining the protein-protein interaction from the standpoint of both the enzyme and ACP. The fabG gene product, β-ketoacyl-ACP reductase, was selected because it is an essential and universally expressed component of type II fatty acid biosynthesis. FabG catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of β-ketoacyl-ACP intermediates, and only a single isoform is known. In addition, the crystal structures of E. coli FabG (16Price A.C. Zhang Y.-M. Rock C.O. White S.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12772-12781Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and the Brassica napas FabG·NADP+ binary complex (17Fisher M. Kroon J.T. Martindale W. Stuitje A.R. Slabas A.R. Rafferty J.B.

We used site-directed mutagenesis to determine the residues on FabG required for high affinity ACP binding and protein NMR spectroscopy to identify the ACP residues that contribute to the formation of the FabG·ACP complex. Materials—Amersham Biosciences supplied the [1-14C]acetyl-CoA; Sigma supplied the acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, and ACP; Qiagen supplied the Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin; Promega supplied the molecular biology reagents. NH2-terminally His-tagged FabD, FabH, and FabG were expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen) and purified by nickel chelation affinity chromatography as described previously (18Heath R.J.

Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford method with γ-globulin as the standard (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). All other reagents were of the highest available purity. Construction of FabG and ACP Mutants—Mutations were introduced into the fabG gene by using an overlap extension PCR method. Wild type fabG gene was cloned into pET-15b plasmid (pET-fabG) using NdeI and BamHI sites. All of the FabG mutants were prepared using the same two outside primers on the plasmid, T7 promoter primer (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG) and T7 terminator primer (5′-GCTAGTTATTGCTCAGCGG). The internal primers for all the FabG mutants are listed in Table I. To construct each mutant, two PCRs with the wide type plasmid as the template, one outside primer and the respective inside primer were performed, and the products were then pooled and used as a template for a second PCR using both outside primers. The ∼980-bp PCR product was purified from a 1% agarose gel using QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and ligated into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). Following transformation into E. coli INVαF′, plasmid DNA was isolated and sequenced. A clone with the sequence containing the desired mutation was digested with NdeI and BamHI and ligated into pET-15b, which had been digested with the same enzymes and dephosphorylated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphorylase. The resultant plasmids were transformed into competent E. coli BL21(DE3) cells by electroporation. Expression and purification was as for the wild type protein. The proper folding of the mutant proteins was checked by circular dichroism spectroscopy.Table IPrimers used for FabG mutagenesisMutantForward primeraCodons changed to introduce the mutations are underlined.Reverse primerArg 129 → Ala5′-GAAAAAGGCTCATGGTCGTATTATCAC5′-ACGACCATGAGCCTTTTTCATCATAGArg 129 → Glu5′-GAAAAAGGAACATGGTCGTATTATCAC5′-ACGACCATGTTCCTTTTTCATCATAGArg 172 → Ala5′-GCGTCAGCCGGTATTACTGTAAAC5′-AATACCGGCTGACGCAACTTCGArg 172 → Glu5′-GCGTCAGAAGGTATTACTGTAAAC5′-AATACCTTCTGACGCAACTTCGa Codons changed to introduce the mutations are underlined. Open table in a new tab ACP-dependent Gel Reconstitution Assay of FabG Activity—FabG activity was tested in an ACP-dependent assay by analyzing the formation of β-hydroxybutyryl-ACP with a conformational sensitive gel electrophoresis method. The assay contained 25 μm ACP, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 65 μm malonyl-CoA, 45 μm [1-14C]acetyl-CoA (specific activity 60 μCi/μmol), 200 μm NADPH, 1 μg of purified FabD, 0.5 μg of purified FabH in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and 1 ng to 0.256 μg of FabG (or FabG mutant) protein in a final volume of 40 μl. The ACP, β-mercaptoethanol, and buffer were preincubated at 37 °C for 30 min to ensure the complete reduction of ACP. The substrate for the FabG reaction was generated using FabD to transfer the malonyl group from CoA to ACP to produce malonyl-ACP and FabH to condense acetyl-CoA and malonyl-ACP to form β-ketobutyryl-ACP. The reaction was initiated by the addition of FabG. After incubation at 37 °C for 15 min, the reaction was stopped by adding 8 μl of 6× sample buffer to the reaction mix and placing the reaction tubes on ice. Then 40 μl of each of the assay mixtures was loaded onto conformational sensitive gels that contained 13% acrylamide and 0.5 m urea. The electrophoresis was performed under constant current of 32 mA/gel at 25 °C. The gels were stained in Coomassie Blue, destained, and dried with a vacuum gel drier at 80 °C. The gels were exposed against PhosphorImager screens that were scanned by Typhoon 9200. The product of FabG, β-hydroxy-[1-14C]butyryl-ACP, was quantitated with ImageQuant 5.2. ACP-independent Spectrophotometric Assay of FabG Activity—This assay measured the disappearance of NADPH, the cofactor for FabG reaction, spectrophotometrically at 340 nm. The reaction mixture contained 0.5 mm acetoacetyl-CoA, 0.2 mm NADPH, 1-20 μg of FabG (or FabG mutant) protein, 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, in a final volume of 300 μl. The reaction was initiated by the addition of acetoacetyl-CoA. Decrease in the absorbance at 340 nm was recorded for 2 min. The initial rate was used to calculate the enzymatic activity. The ability of ACP to inhibit either FabG or FabG mutant activity in the spectrophotometric assay was tested by incubating ACP with the protein at room temperature for 5 min before the addition of acetoacetyl-CoA to initiate the reaction. FabG-ACP Binding Measured by Surface Plasmon Resonance—Binding studies were performed on a Biacore 3000 Surface Plasmon Resonance instrument. ACP was covalently attached to a carboxymethyl-dextran-coated gold surface (CM-5 Chip, Biacore). The carboxymethyl groups on the chip were activated with N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide and N-hydroxysuccinimide to activate the carboxymethyl-dextran. The ACP was attached at pH 4.5 to this activated surface by reaction of the carboxyl groups of the dextran with primary amines on the ACP to form an amide linkage. The remaining reactive sites were blocked by reaction with ethanolamine. A reference cell was prepared similarly except that no ACP was added. Binding was measured by flowing 370 nm FabG in 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, at a flow rate of 20 μl/min through the reference and ACP-containing flow cells in sequence. A blank run consisted of buffer only. Following the injection, release of the bound FabG was measured by flowing only buffer through the flow cells. Regeneration of the chip surface to remove bound FabG consisted of allowing the protein to dissociate in buffer for 60 min between injections. The data reported show the difference in surface plasmon resonance signal between the flow cell containing ACP and the reference cell. Mutant FabG concentrations used in the assay were 335 nm for FabG[R172A] and 408 nm for FabG[R172E]. FabG-ACP Binding Measured by AlphaScreen—AlphaScreen technology is an approach to study biological interactions by energy transfer (22Beaudet L. Bedard J. Breton B. Mercuri R.J. Budarf M.L. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 600-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Upon laser excitation, a chemical signal is generated on the donor beads (streptavidin-coated). When a specific interaction brings the acceptor beads (a specific antibody coated) to the proximity of the donor beads, a cascade of energy transfers take place, emitting highly amplified fluorescence (or AlphaScreen signal) at a wavelength that is lower than that of the excitation. Binding between the biotinylated ACP and His-tagged FabG brings streptavidin donor beads and nickel chelate acceptor beads together, emitting AlphaScreen signals. ACP was biotinylated using EZ-Link™ sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce). To study the ACP binding ability of FabG and FabG mutants, 1 μm biotinylated ACP was incubated with different concentrations (30 nm to 2 μm) of His-tagged FabG at room temperature in a 384-well ProxiPlate (Packard Instrument Co.). After a 30-min incubation, streptavidin donor beads and nickel chelate acceptor beads (50 μg/ml final concentration for each bead, (His)6Tag detection system, Packard Instrument Co.) were added to the above solutions. The reaction mixtures were then incubated for 1 h before being read by Fusion™ Universal Microplate Analyzer (Packard Instrument Co.), with excitation at 680 nm and emission at 600 nm. NMR Spectroscopy and Titration Experiments—All NMR data were acquired with Varian Inova 600-MHz spectrometer at 27 °C. Data were processed and displayed by the program package NMRPipe and NMRDraw (23Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11280) Google Scholar) on an SGI Octane work station. The programs XEASY (ETH Automated Spectroscopy for X Window System) and Sparky (24Goddard T.D. Kneller D.G. SPARKY 3.0. University of California, San Francisco1998Google Scholar) were used for data analysis. Backbone resonance of 13C/15N-labeled ACP was determined on the basis of three-dimensional HNCO, HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH (25Yamazaki T. Lee W. Arrowsmith D.H. Muhandriam D. Kay L.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 11655-11666Crossref Scopus (491) Google Scholar), and HSQC-TOCSY (26Marion D. Driscoll P.C. Kay L.E. Wingfield P.T. Bax A. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6150-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). Titrations of FabG to 15N-ACP were monitored by 15N-1H HSQC-TROSY experiments. The molar ratios of FabG:ACP at each titration point were 0.07, 0.14, 0.21, 0.28, 0.35, 0.42, 0.54, 0.65, and 0.85, respectively. For the first six points in the titration series of 15N-labeled ACP with FabG, 50 μl of 0.96 mm FabG in 40 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.5, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol were added successively to the NMR tube containing 550 μl of 1.34 mm15N-labeled ACP in the same buffer. The samples were mixed thoroughly after each addition. For the last two points, 80 μl of 0.96 mm FabG was added. When the mutant FabG[R129E/R172E] was titrated to 15N-labeled ACP, 70 μl of 0.93 mm mutant FabG in the same buffer as wild type FabG was added successively to 460 μl of 1.34 mm15N-labeled ACP. The molar ratios of FabG[R129E/R172E]:ACP in the titration series were 0.11, 0.22, 0.33, 0.43, 0.54, and 0.65, respectively. The Electropositive/Hydrophobic Patch at the Entrance to the FabG Active Site—FabG is a highly conserved and universal component of the type II system that catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of all β-ketoacyl-ACP intermediates in the elongation cycle. Unlike other enzymes in the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway, there is only a single FabG isozyme that has been identified (2Jackowski S. Rock C.O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 1155-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Multiple sequence alignment indicates that FabG sequences from different species including bacteria and plants share a high degree of sequence identity (Fig. 1A). The crystal structures of FabG from E. coli (16Price A.C. Zhang Y.-M. Rock C.O. White S.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12772-12781Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and B. napus (17Fisher M.

Structure. 2000; 8: 339-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) are also homologous and reveal FabG as a tetramer consisting of dimers composed of monomers arranged in a head-to-tail configuration (Fig. 1B). Two conserved arginine residues, Arg-129 and Arg-172, are located adjacent to the active site opening (Fig. 1). We have shown previously (12Zhang Y.-M. Rao M.S. Heath R.J. Price A.C. Olson A.J. Rock C.O. White S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8231-8238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) that the positively charged residues at the entrance to the FabH active site are important for the binding of the ACP substrate. The location of the conserved arginines within a hydrophobic area adjacent to the entrance to the FabG active site tunnel suggested they were key residues in the interaction with the acidic residues located along helix α2 of ACP. A Crucial Role for Arg-129 and Arg-172 of FabG for ACP Binding—FabG mutants of Arg-129 and Arg-172 were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. Two assays were used to evaluate the effects of these mutations on the FabG-specific activity. The first was ACP-dependent and used β-ketobutyryl-ACP as the substrate in a radiochemical assay (20Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10996-11000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 27Tsay J.-T. Oh W. Larson T.J. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6807-6814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The second assay was ACP-independent. β-Ketobutyryl-CoA was used as a substrate analog in place of β-ketobutyryl-ACP, and the disappearance of NADPH was monitored spectrophotometrically at 340 nm. The wild type FabG enzyme was much less active with the β-ketobutyryl-CoA analog compared with its normal substrate β-ketobutyryl-ACP (Table II). Mutations that selectively interfere with the FabG-ACP interaction adversely affect the ACP-dependent assay but not the ACP-independent assay. All FabG mutants had circular dichroism spectra that were identical to the wild type enzyme (not shown) indicating that the mutations did not perturb the overall protein structure.Table IISpecific activity of FabG wild type and the ACP-binding site mutants in the ACP-dependent and ACP-independent assaysFabGSpecific activity (% activity)ACP-dependentACP-independentμmol/min/μgμmol/min/mgWild type2.90 ± 0.49 (100%)2.60 ± 0.22 (100)R129E0.245 ± 0.006 (8.5)2.68 ± 0.082 (103)R129A0.284 ± 0.013 (9.8)3.24 ± 0.059 (124.5)R172E0.102 ± 0.011 (3.5)1.04 ± 0.027 (40.0)R172A0.405 ± 0.042 (14.0)1.60 ± 0.041 (61.5)R129E/R172E0.029 ± 0.006 (1.0)1.47 ± 0.017 (56.5)R129A/R172A0.110 ± 0.011 (3.8)2.08 ± 0.023 (80.0) Open table in a new tab Table II lists the FabG mutants that were produced and their activities in the two assays. All of the FabG mutant proteins exhibited similar activities with the CoA substrate analog compared with the wild type FabG. This result illustrated that the FabG mutants were catalytically competent, a finding anticipated because the surface arginine mutations were not directed against the known active site residues buried in the active site cavity of FabG (16Price A.C. Zhang Y.-M. Rock C.O. White S.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12772-12781Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 28Davies C. Heath R.J. White S.W. Rock C.O. Structure. 2000; 8: 185-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In contrast, all of the mutant proteins exhibited significantly reduced enzyme activity with β-ketobutyryl-ACP in comparison to the wild type enzyme (Table II). Changing the arginine residues to glutamate was more deleterious than changing the residues to the neutral alanine. The most affected protein was the FabG[R129E/R172E] double mutant. These biochemical data are consistent with the idea that these two arginines are important for the interaction between ACP and FabG. Thus, this biochemical analysis showed that the panel of FabG mutants were selectively deficient in the utilization of ACP thioester substrates suggesting a defect in FabG-ACP interaction. The binding of ACP to FabG and the panel of mutant proteins was directly addressed using AlphaScreen™ technology described under “Experimental Procedures.” Biotinylated ACP and His-tagged FabG, either wild type or the individual mutants, were incubated together before the addition of the streptavidin-coated donor beads and the nickel-chelate acceptor beads. Interactions between FabG and ACP bring the two beads into proximity, which allows an energy transfer cascade to take place following laser excitation that leads to the production of a fluorescent signal that was detected by a fusion reader. Wild type FabG exhibited strong AlphaScreen signals at less than 1 μm concentration (Fig. 2). In contrast, neither the single mutants nor the double mutants produced a signal even at higher protein concentrations, illustrating that mutations at the two Arg residues of FabG attenuated its ability to bind ACP. To corroborate the binding results obtained with AlphaScreen™, two other methods were used to directly measure the FabG-ACP interaction. Wild type FabG and the Arg-172 single mutants were used in these experiments. The first approach used was surface plasmon resonance (BIAcore®). In these experiments (see “Experimental Procedures” and Ref. 16Price A.C. Zhang Y.-M. Rock C.O. White S.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12772-12781Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), the ACP molecule was covalently attached to the chip (the “ligand”), and FabG flowed across the chip and was monitored for binding (the “analyte”). The important results are shown in Fig. 3. Wild type FabG produced a robust signal at 370 nm, whereas with FabG[R172E] and FabG[R172A] there was little evidence for ACP binding at similar protein concentrations. The apparent dissociation constant for the FabG-ACP interaction calculated in this study was 4.7 μm using the on and off rate constants determined in the plasmon resonance experiment. This number was essentially the same as the 4.5 μm dissociation constant reported by our group earlier (16Price A.C. Zhang Y.-M. Rock C.O. White S.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12772-12781Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), where a more comprehensive surface plasmon resonance analysis of ACP binding to wild type FabG is presented. The second method was based on the ability of free ACP to inhibit the FabG reaction using β-ketobutyryl-CoA substrate analog (the ACP-independent assay described under “Experimental Procedures”). When bound to FabG, ACP and its prosthetic group occludes the active site tunnel and prevents the entry of β-ketobutyryl-CoA. This effect will be attenuated in FabG mutants that have reduced affinity for ACP. The results of these experiments using wild type FabG, FabG[R172E], and FabG[R172A] are presented in Fig. 4. ACP exhibited an IC50 of 120 μm with the wild type enzyme, but both FabG[R172E] and FabG[R172A] were refractory to ACP inhibition. These data coupled with the direct binding experiments provide strong evidence that A"

Arrestin binding prevents further G protein activation and often redirects signaling to other pathways. The comparison of the high-resolution crystal structures of arrestin2, visual arrestin, and rhodopsin as well as earlier mutagenesis and peptide inhibition data collectively suggest that the elements on the concave sides of both arrestin domains most likely participate in receptor binding directly, thereby dictating its receptor preference. Using comparative binding of visual arrestin/arrestin2 chimeras to the preferred target of visual arrestin, light-activated phosphorylated rhodopsin (PRh*), and to the arrestin2 target, phosphorylated activated m2 muscarinic receptor (P-m2 mAChR*), we identified the elements that determine the receptor specificity of arrestins. We found that residues 49–90 (β-strands V and VI and adjacent loops in the N-domain) and 237–268 (β-strands XV and XVI in the C-domain) in visual arrestin and homologous regions in arrestin2 are largely responsible for their receptor preference. Only 35 amino acids (22 of which are nonconservative substitutions) in the two elements are different. Simultaneous exchange of both elements between visual arrestin and arrestin2 fully reverses their receptor specificity, demonstrating that these two elements in the two domains of arrestin are necessary and sufficient to determine their preferred receptor targets.

Preferential interaction of a heterotrimeric G protein with an activated receptor is a surprisingly uniform mechanism initiating the first round of signaling by a vast and diverse superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; P-m2 mAChR*, phosphorylated carbachol-activated m2 muscarinic cholinergic receptor; P-Rh*, light-activated phosphorhodopsin; Rh*, light-activated unphosphorylated rhodopsin. 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; P-m2 mAChR*, phosphorylated carbachol-activated m2 muscarinic cholinergic receptor; P-Rh*, light-activated phosphorhodopsin; Rh*, light-activated unphosphorylated rhodopsin. The two-step mechanism that terminates signaling via G proteins and often redirects it to other pathways is also well conserved. First, an activated GPCR is phosphorylated by a cognate receptor kinase. Next, arrestin selectively binds to the active phosphorylated receptor covering its cytoplasmic tip and essentially crowding out G proteins (1.Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 155: 455-465Google Scholar, 2.Krupnick J.G. Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18125-18131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Mammals have only four arrestin proteins, which apparently participate in the regulation of over 1000 different GPCRs (1.Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 155: 455-465Google Scholar). The expression of two of the four arrestins (visual arrestin, or arrestin1, and cone arrestin, or arrestin4) 2In this paper we use systematic names of arrestin proteins, with the exception of arrestin1, which is historically called visual arrestin. The synonyms for arrestin2 are β-arrestin and β-arrestin1; arrestin3 is also called β-arrestin2. 2In this paper we use systematic names of arrestin proteins, with the exception of arrestin1, which is historically called visual arrestin. The synonyms for arrestin2 are β-arrestin and β-arrestin1; arrestin3 is also called β-arrestin2. is limited to rod and cone photoreceptors, where they quench the signaling of rhodopsin and cone opsins, respectively. Thus, only two remaining nonvisual arrestins (arrestin2 and arrestin3) regulate the vast majority of GPCRs. Obviously, a one-to-one receptor specificity of nonvisual arrestins is out of the question, although arrestins 2 and 3 do demonstrate a detectable preference for particular groups of receptors (3.Oakley R.H.

On the other hand, both visual arrestins are highly specialized; arrestin1 demonstrates clear preference for rhodopsin over any other receptor tested (5.Lohse M.J. Benovic J.L. Codina J. Caron M.G.

Therefore, to delineate the structural elements responsible for arrestin receptor specificity, we took advantage of a dramatic difference between arrestin1 and arrestin2 binding to rhodopsin (Rh) and the m2 muscarinic cholinergic receptor (m2 mAChR), which is easily measurable in a direct binding assay in vitro (6.Gurevich V.V.

The comparison of the binding behavior of arrestin1/2 chimeras with that of parental arrestins allowed us to identify two elements in arrestin proteins largely responsible for their receptor preference.

These pGEM2-based plasmids encode bovine wild type arrestins with an “idealized” 5′-untranslated region (20.Gurevich V.V. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 275: 382-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) under the control of a SP6 promoter. The following restriction sites (either existing or engineered by silent mutagenesis) were used for chimera construction (corresponding codons in the arrestin1 open reading frame followed by homologous codons in the arrestin2 open reading frame are shown in parentheses): EcoRI (upstream of start codon), AvrII (25–27; 21–23), BamHI (47–49; 43–45), PmlI (61–63; 57–59), AatII (73–74; 69–70), MluI (101–102; 98–99), SalI (145–146; 142–143), BsiWI (169–171; 163–165), BspEI (174–177; 168–170), ApaI (185–186; 179–180), XbaI (294–296; 288–290), XhoI (307–309; 301–303), BstXI (345–349; 340–344), and HindIII (downstream of stop codon) (Fig. 1). Certain other sites were eliminated by silent mutagenesis to make these sites unique. In some cases (inside regions 5 and 14) in which it was impossible to introduce convenient restriction sites, arrestin coding sequences were joined as follows. An oligonucleotide with the 5′ half matching the arrestin1 sequence and the 3′ half matching arrestin2 was used as a forward primer, and an arrestin2 oligonucleotide downstream from the far restriction site intended for use in subcloning as a reverse primer on the arrestin2 template. The resulting fragments, containing a short arrestin1 sequence at one end along with an arrestin1 primer upstream of the near restriction site, were then used as the reverse and forward primers, respectively. This second round of PCR on the arrestin1 template generated a fragment in which the sequence switched from arrestin1 to arrestin2 between restriction sites. Combination chimeras were constructed using the same sites. In this paper we named visual arrestin-based and arrestin2-based chimeras ChV and ChB, respectively, with a number following these letters to designate the region exchanged (cf. Fig. 1). The sequence of all constructs was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing.In Vitro Transcription, Translation, and Evaluation of Mutant StabilityPlasmids were linearized using the HindIII site downstream of the coding sequence (Fig. 1) before in vitro transcription to produce mRNAs encoding full-length arrestin proteins. In vitro transcription and translation were performed as described previously (6.Gurevich V.V. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J. Ptasienski J. Kim C.M. Sterne-Marr R. Hosey M.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol.

All arrestin proteins were labeled by incorporation of [3H]leucine and [14C]leucine with the specific activity of the mix 1.5–3 Ci/mmol, resulting in the specific activity of arrestin proteins within the range of 66 to 85 Ci/mmol (150–230 dpm/fmol). The translation of every mutant used in this study produced a single labeled protein band with the expected mobility on SDS-PAGE. Two parameters were used for the assessment of mutant relative stability as described (12.Pulvermuller A. Schroder K. Fischer T. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol.

This integral parameter calculated for a mutant was expressed as a percent of that for wild type arrestin (22.Gurevich V.V. J. Biol.

Based on enhanced specificity of the binding of phosphorylation-independent mutants to activated unphosphorylated receptors (7.Smith W.C. Gurevich E.V. Dugger D.R. Shelamer C.L. Vishnivetskiy S.A.

Therefore we targeted the arrestin N-domain first. Using engineered restriction sites (Fig. 1) we constructed a series of visual arrestin-based chimeras containing nine different elements of the arrestin2 N-domain (Fig. 2). These proteins were expressed in cell-free translation, and their binding to phosphorylated light-activated rhodopsin (PRh*) and phosphorylated carbachol-activated m2 mAChR (P-m2 mAChR*) was compared with parental arrestins 1 and 2. We expected the introduction of any arrestin2 element playing a role in receptor specificity to decrease the binding of the chimera to P-Rh* and increase its binding to P-m2 mAChR* as compared with arrestin1. Indeed, the exchange of three consecutive elements spanning residues 45 through 98 reduced the binding of the chimeras to P-Rh* while enhancing their binding to P-m2 mAChR* at the same time (Fig. 2). We constructed and tested three additional chimeras with arrestin2-derived sequences in this region and found that the incorporation of arrestin2 element 45–86 in place of the homologous part of arrestin1 yields a chimera (ChV11) with arrestin2-like receptor preference, high binding to P-m2 mAChR* and low binding to P-Rh* (Fig. 2). According to the crystal structures of both proteins, this region encompasses β-strands V and VI and adjacent loops (9.Hirsch J.A. Schubert C. Gurevich V.V. Sigler P.B.

Wild type arrestins 1 and 2 and chimeras are shown as bars with elements of arrestin2 origin in black. In a direct m2 mAChR binding assay, 100 fmol of m2 mAChR that was purified, reconstituted into liposomes, and phosphorylated by GRK2 was incubated in 50 μl with 50 fmol of the indicated tritiated arrestin (specific activities, 80–200 dpm/fmol) in the presence of 100 μm m2 agonist carbachol (P-m2 mAChR*) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In rhodopsin binding, 0.3 μg of rhodopsin kinase-phosphorylated rhodopsin, P-Rh*, was incubated with the same amounts of arrestins under room light. In both cases, membrane-bound arrestins were separated by gel filtration on Sepharose 2B and quantified in a liquid scintillation counter. Means ± S.D. from three experiments each performed in duplicate are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further test the role of the whole 55-amino acid element in the N-domain, we constructed arrestin2-based chimeras in which all (ChB10) or parts (ChB11, ChB12) of corresponding visual arrestin-derived elements were placed into the context of arrestin2 (Fig. 3). We reasoned that if this element were necessary and sufficient to switch receptor preference of arrestin proteins (as appears to be the case with ChV10 and ChV11), ChB10 and ChB11 would behave like visual arrestin. However, we found that although these substitutions decrease arrestin2 binding to P-m2 mAChR*, they fail to increase its binding to P-Rh*, suggesting that additional elements likely localized in the C-domain are also involved in arrestin receptor recognition.Fig. 3Short arrestin2-derived element enables high visual arrestin binding to P-m2 mAChR* but fails to enhance the binding to P-Rh* of a symmetrical arrestin2-based chimera. The schematic representation of proteins and binding assays is as described in the legend to Fig. 2. Means ± S.D. from three experiments each performed in duplicate are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Therefore we “scanned” the arrestin C-domain in the same fashion, constructing visual arrestin-based chimeras with arrestin2-derived parts (Fig. 4A). We found that the replacement of residues 186–295 with arrestin2 residues 180–289 (ChV14) dramatically changes arrestin specificity, whereas all three downstream replacements (in ChV15, 16, and 17) do not have this effect. In fact, ChV14 behaves almost like arrestin2, whereas symmetrical arrestin2-based ChB14 demonstrates binding behavior that is intermediate between that of visual arrestin and arrestin2 (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, either the N- or the C-domain element derived from arrestin2 in the context of visual arrestin (in ChV11 (Fig. 3) and ChV14 (Fig. 4)) effectively decreases its ability to bind P-Rh* and enhances its binding to P-m2 mAChR* to the level of arrestin2 or higher, whereas symmetrical substitutions in the context of arrestin2 (Figs. 3 and 4, ChB11 and ChB14, respectively) are a lot less effective in “converting” it into visual arrestin. Apparently, it is a lot easier to destroy the exact fit of visual arrestin to P-Rh* and create a chimera that can accommodate P-m2 mAChR* than it is to reconstruct highly specific visual arrestin on arrestin2 “backbone.”Fig. 4The large C-domain element enables high visual arrestin binding to P-m2 mAChR* (A) and enhances arrestin2 binding to P-Rh* (B). The schematic representation of proteins and binding assays is as described in the legend to Fig. 2. Means ± S.D. from two experiments each performed in duplicate are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because the element exchanged in ChV14 and ChB14 is relatively large, we divided it into four parts (termed A, B, C, and D) and constructed visual arrestin-based chimeras with these smaller arrestin2-derived elements (Fig. 5A). We found that none of these parts alone gives the full effect of the larger element on P-Rh* binding. The largest, part A (arrestin2 residues 180–230), appears to be the least potent, whereas two smaller parts, in B (residues 231–244) and D (residues 263–289), yield stronger effects (Fig. 5A), none of which is dramatic. Because the C-domain acts in concert with the N-domain in determining arrestin receptor preference, we constructed several visual arrestin-based chimeras with the identified N-domain element from arrestin2 (as in ChV11) combined with smaller C-domain elements (Fig. 5B), as well as arrestin2-based chimeras combining the identified N-domain element from visual arrestin (as in ChB11) with small C-domain elements and their combinations (Fig. 5C). The combination of the N-domain and large (A+B+C+D) C-domain elements yields a complete switch from visual arrestin-like to arrestin2-like receptor specificity. Although no single arrestin2-derived C-domain element in the context of ChV11 is as potent as the large element, the combination of elements B+C mimics the effect of the large element (Fig. 5B). Similarly, the combination of the visual arrestin-derived N-domain element with the large C-domain piece fully switches the specificity of arrestin2 to visual arrestin-like (Fig. 5C). The combinations of smaller C-domain elements that mimic it are the ones containing both B and C parts, whereas combinations of either B or C element with other elements appears less effective.

This increased rate is attributed to a decrease in Km with little effect on Vmax. An ∼2.5-fold increase in the rate of amyloid β peptide hydrolysis is produced by dynorphin B-9. However, with insulin as substrate, dynorphin B-9 is inhibitory.

These findings suggest that peptides bind to one subunit of IDE and induce a conformational change that shifts the equilibrium to the more active dimer as well as activates the adjacent subunit.

Although IDE is primarily located in the cytosol (1.Duckworth W.C. Bennett R.G. Hamel F.G. Endocr.

It has been suggested that the enzyme exhibits a preference for P1 basic (arginine, lysine) or bulky hydrophobic (phenylalanine, leucine, tyrosine) residues (5.Authier F. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J.M. Clin. Investig. Med. 1996; 19: 149-160PubMed Google Scholar). Studies from this laboratory confirmed the preference, but not requirement, for cleavage at hydrophobic and basic residues (6.Safavi A. Miller B.C. Cottam L. Hersh L.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14318-14325Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It has also been proposed that the specificity of the enzyme is governed by the three-dimensional structure of the substrate (1.Duckworth W.C. Bennett R.G. Hamel F.G. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 608-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar), and this is likely to be a contributing factor with larger substrates. A variety of physiological peptides has been shown to be in vitro substrates for IDE including insulin (7.Kirschner R.J. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol.

Interest in IDE has recently emerged based on its potential involvement in the catabolism of amyloid β peptides in the brain.

Genetic linkage studies indicate that a region of chromosome 10q, which is within 195 kilobases of the IDE gene, is genetically linked to late-onset Alzheimer's disease (16.Bertram L. Saunders A.J.

However, the linkage of this region of chromosome 10q and IDE has yet to be firmly established and has been questioned (19.Abraham R. Myers A. Wavrant-DeVrieze F. Hamshere M.L. Thomas H.V.

Perhaps the most convincing evidence that IDE contributes to amyloid β peptide catabolism in vivo comes from the finding that Aβ peptide levels are elevated in the brains of IDE-deficient mice (20.Miller B.C. Eckman E.A. Sambamurti K. Dobbs N. Chow K.M. Eckman C.B. Hersh L.B. Thiele D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6221-6226Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 21.Farris W.

During the course of our studies of the reaction of IDE with various peptide substrates we observed that several of these peptides, when tested as alternate substrate inhibitors, actually increased enzyme activity. We report here the results of these studies, which suggest that IDE can be a therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The fluorogenic substrates Abz-GGFLRKHGQ-EDDnp, Abz-GGFLRKAGQ-EDDnp, and Abz-GGFLRKMGQ-EDDnp were synthesized and purified as previously described (22.Csuhai E. Juliano M.A. Pyrek J.S. Harms A.C. Juliano L. Hersh L.B Anal. Biochem. 1999; 269: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Recombinant rat IDE was produced in Sf-9 cells as a fusion protein containing an N-terminal hexahistidine attached to the enzyme through a linker region containing a tobacco etch virus protease site (23.Song E-S.

The enzyme was purified to homogeneity by chromatography on a His-Select HC nickel affinity gel column (Sigma). In some experiments the hexahistidine affinity tag was removed by treatment with tobacco etch virus protease and confirmed by Western blot analysis with an anti-hexahistidine antisera (Clontech). Recombinant nardilysin was produced in Sf-9 cells and purified in a similar manner (24.Ma Z. Chow K.M. Csuhai E. Hersh L.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 401: 198-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Dynorphin B-9, dynorphin A-17, dynorphin B-13, bradykinin, γ-endorphin, insulin B-chain, insulin, Leu-Arg, and Leu-enkephalin were obtained from Bachem. β-Endorphin was obtained from Multiple Peptide Systems through the National Institute on Drug Abuse Research Tools program. Iodinated-Aβ1–40 and iodinated insulin were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. The hydrolysis of the fluorogenic peptides was measured by following the increase in fluorescence (excitation at 318 nm and emission at 419 nm) that occurred upon peptide bond cleavage (22.Csuhai E. Juliano M.A. Pyrek J.S. Harms A.C. Juliano L. Hersh L.B Anal. Biochem. 1999; 269: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Alternatively, Abz-GGFLRKHGQ-EDDnp hydrolysis was followed by measuring the disappearance of the substrate by HPLC. A linear gradient of 5% acetonitrile in 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid to 50% acetonitrile in 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid was used. Peptide peaks were monitored by absorbance at 214 nm. The same HPLC system was used to measure the hydrolysis of other peptides. The hydrolysis of 125I-labeled Aβ1–40 was determined in 15-μl reaction mixtures containing 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.3, 10.7 nm125I-labeled Aβ1–40 (specific activity 2 × 105 cpm/nmol), and 0.25 ng of IDE. After incubation at 37 °C for 15 min the reaction was stopped by the addition of 15 μl of SDS sample buffer. An aliquot was electrophoresed on a 15% Bicine/Tris/urea polyacrylamide gel as described by Klafki et al. (25.Klafki H.W. Wiltfang J. Staufenbiel M. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 24-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). After drying the gel, band intensities were then quantitated with a storm PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The hydrolysis of 125I-labeled insulin was assayed by a modification of the method of Garcia et al. (26.Garcia J.V. Fenton B.W. Rosner M.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4237-4244Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (50 μl) containing 0.25 ng of enzyme, 50 nm125I-labeled insulin (specific activity 2 × 105 cpm/nmol), 0.15% bovine serum albumin, and 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of an equal volume of 15% trichloroacetic acid. After allowing the sample to sit on ice for 15 min to precipitate unreacted insulin, the reaction was centrifuged for 5 min at 2,000 × g, and the supernatant was counted on a γ counter. Gel filtration was performed on a Superdex-200 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, and 50 μm bradykinin when added. When bradykinin was included in the gel filtration buffer, the eluted fractions containing IDE were immediately adjusted to 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid and analyzed by HPLC for bradykinin hydrolysis. Isolation of dimers between His6-IDE and FLAG-IDE was accomplished by co-expression in COS-7 cells. The mixed dimers were precipitated with anti-His antisera and protein G Sepharose beads and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with anti-FLAG antisera. The formation of dimers between His6-IDEH112Q and wild type IDE and between His6-IDEE111Vand wild type IDE was accomplished by co-expression of baculovirus expressing the appropriate form of IDE in Sf-9 cells. Cell extracts were prepared and dimers isolated by chromatography on columns of His-Select HC nickel affinity gel (Sigma). In an attempt to determine the relative affinity of a number of peptides for IDE we tested them as alternate substrate inhibitors. Initially we assayed IDE activity with the fluorogenic substrate Abz-GGFLRKHGQ-EDDnp (Km = 10 μm) (23.Song E-S. Mukherjee A Juliano M.A. St. Pyrek J. Goodman Jr., J.P. Juliano L. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1152-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) in the presence of the putative peptide substrate dynorphin A-17. As noted in Table I, at 50 μm dynorphin A-17, instead of observing inhibition of Abz-GGFLRKHGQ-EDDnp hydrolysis, we noted an ∼4.7-fold increase in activity. We then examined two additional putative IDE substrates, dynorphin B-9 and dynorphin B-13. As shown in Table I IDE activity was increased ∼4-fold with each of these peptides. To ensure that the observed increase in IDE activity was not attributable to an artifact caused by the fluorometric assay, the same experiment was conducted with two other proteases, trypsin and nardilysin, which both cleave the fluorogenic substrate. As can be seen in Table I, both dynorphin B-9 and dynorphin A-17, which increased IDE activity, were as expected, inhibitors of the trypsin- and nardilysin-catalyzed reactions. These data indicate that the assay per se was not the cause of the observed increase in IDE activity.Table IEffect of dynorphin peptides on the activity of IDE, nardilysin, and trypsinRate% of control activitynmols/minIDE No addition29.3(100) + 50 μm dynorphin A-17136.6466 + 50 μm dynorphin B-9117.1400 + 50 μm dynorphin B-13114.6392Nardilysin No addition18.3(100) + 50 μM dynorphin A-17Not detectable0 + 50 μM dynorphin B-9Not detectable0Trypsin No addition30.5(100) + 50 μM dynorphin A-17Not detectable0 + 50 μM dynorphin B-924.179 Open table in a new tab To further substantiate the activation of IDE we used dynorphin B-9 as the variable peptide and measured cleavage of the substrate Abz-GGFLRKHGQ-EDDnp by both a fluorogenic assay and by following the reaction by the appearance of product by HPLC. As shown in Fig. 1, dynorphin B-9 increased IDE activity independent of the assay method used to follow the reaction. No difference was noted between IDE containing a hexahistidine affinity tag and IDE with the affinity tag removed. Furthermore, activation was observed with two other fluorogenic substrates, Abz-GGFLRKAGQ-EDDnp and Abz-GGFLRKMGQ-EDDnp. We next measured the concentration dependence for the effect of a number of different peptides on IDE activity with Abz-GGFLRKHGQ-EDDnp as the substrate. As shown in Fig. 2, A–H, some but not all of the peptides examined increased IDE activity. Those that increased IDE activity (Fig. 2, A–E) included β-endorphin, bradykinin, dynorphin B-13, dynorphin A-17, and insulin B chain. However, there was considerable variation in the extent of activation observed and the shape of the curves. Activation at low concentrations followed by inhibition at higher concentrations was seen for β-endorphin, dynorphin B-13, dynorphin A-17, and insulin B chain, whereas bradykinin produced a hyperbolic response with a 7-fold increase in activity. At the other extreme the peptides Leu-Arg, Leu-enkephalin, and γ-endorphin were without significant effect, Fig. 2, F–H. The peptides shown in Fig. 2 were tested as substrates for IDE by following their hydrolysis by HPLC. We found that those peptides that activated IDE, namely dynorphin B-9, β-endorphin, bradykinin, dynorphin B-13, dynorphin A-17, and insulin B-chain, were all substrates. Those peptides that had a minimal effect on IDE activity, γ-endorphin, Leu-Arg, and Leu-enkephalin were not significantly cleaved. To provide insight into the kinetic mechanism by which peptides increased IDE activity we measured the effect of dynorphin B-9 on the kinetics of Abz-GGFLRKHGQ-EDDnp hydrolysis. As shown in Fig. 3, the effect of dynorphin B-9 was primarily to decrease the Km for the substrate, with a relatively small effect on Vmax. Attempts to show substrate activation with Abz-GGFLRKHGQ-EDDnp were suggestive that this phenomena occurred. However, sigmoidicity in the substrate versus rate curve was difficult to ascertain with certainty since rate measurements were less reliable at the low substrate concentrations where deviation from a hyperbolic response appeared to occur. We next determined whether the peptide-dependent increase in IDE activity could be extended to two physiological substrates for the enzyme, Aβ1–40 and insulin. As shown in Fig. 4A, dynorphin B-9 at low concentrations produced an ∼2.5-fold increase in the rate of Aβ1–40 cleavage. However, as shown in Fig. 4B, dynorphin B-9 did not increase the rate of hydrolysis of insulin and was actually inhibitory. We previously reported that IDE appeared as a dimer as judged by gel filtration (6.Safavi A. Miller B.C. Cottam L. Hersh L.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14318-14325Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To confirm the oligomeric nature of IDE we co-expressed an N-terminally His6-tagged IDE with an N-terminally FLAG-tagged IDE in COS-7 cells. Immunoprecipitation with anti-His6 antisera co-precipitated FLAG-IDE as determined by Western blot analysis with anti-FLAG antisera, Fig. 5. To look for other oligomeric forms of IDE we conducted gel filtration analysis at a protein load of 9 mg/ml and a protein load of 1 mg/ml, Fig. 6. At the lower protein load, ∼80% of the activity migrated as an ∼220-kDa species, corresponding to a dimer with the remainder of the activity migrating as a tetramer. At the higher protein load the activity was distributed more nearly equal between the dimer and tetramer. Thus IDE can undergo a concentration-dependent dimer-tetramer equilibrium but is likely a dimer under assay conditions.Fig. 6Gel filtration shows IDE undergoes concentration-dependent dimer-tetramer formation. Gel filtration of IDE on a Superdex S-200 column loaded at a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml (top) or 9 mg/ml (bottom). Fractions of 1 ml were collected and assayed for IDE activity with 2 μm Abz-GGFLRKHGQ-EDDnp as substrate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the peptide activation affected the dimer-tetramer equilibrium, we took enzyme at a high concentration (9 mg/ml) and diluted it to ∼1 mg/ml in the presence and absence of 50 μm bradykinin. The distribution between tetramer and dimer was then determined on a Superdex column, which was equilibrated, and run with either 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, or this buffer containing bradykinin. In the presence of bradykinin the tetramer/dimer equilibrium was shifted to the more active dimer, Fig. 7. To determine whether the dimer or tetramer exhibited the same activity, we compared the specific activity of the enzyme on the ascending peak of the tetramer and the descending peak of the dimer. It was found that the dimer exhibited a 1.6-fold higher specific activity than the tetramer. This is probably a minimal estimate since it is likely that diluting the tetramer into the assay mix led to dissociation of the tetramer into the more active dimer. We found that the bradykinin in the tetramer-containing fractions was significantly hydrolyzed (20–50%); however, complete hydrolysis was seen in the dimer-containing fractions. This observation further suggests that the dimer is the more active species. The oligomeric nature of IDE suggested that its observed activation by peptides might also occur via a peptide-induced conformational change. To test this hypothesis we utilized two mutant forms of IDE. One, IDEH112Q, exhibits about 1% of the activity of the wild type enzyme and a substrate Km >10-fold higher than that of the wild type enzyme. The other, IDEE111V, also exhibits about 1% activity but binds substrate with virtually the same Km as the wild type enzyme. 2E.-S. Song and L. B. Hersh, manuscript in preparation. Based on the induced conformational change model, a dimer between IDEH112Q and wild type IDE should not exhibit significant activation by peptides since only one of its subunits can bind substrate and catalyze the reaction. In contrast, a dimer between wild type IDE and IDEE111V would be expected to exhibit peptide-dependent activation since both subunits can bind substrate, and the catalytically inactive subunit should be able to induce the hypothetical conformation change in the active subunit. To generate these dimers we co-expressed wild type IDE with His6-IDEH112Q or with His6-IDEE111V in Sf-9 cells and isolated the enzyme on a His-Select HC nickel affinity gel column, which bound the hexahistidine-containing inactive subunit. In this way the only IDE activity obtained is from a dimer between the His6-IDE mutant and wild type IDE. The His6-tagged IDE forms that were in excess, being inactive, would not contribute to any observed IDE activity. Preliminary experiments showed that only a trace of wild type IDE was non-specifically bound to and subsequently eluted from the His-Select HC nickel affinity gel and, under the conditions of the assays performed, contributed little if at all to the observed activity. As shown in Fig. 8, when a dimer between His6-IDEH112Q and wild type enzyme was tested for activation by dynorphin B-9, little activation was seen. In contrast, when a dimer between His6-IDEE111V and wild type enzyme was tested for activation by dynorphin B-9, this mixed dimer showed activation similar to the wild type enzyme. The results reported here demonstrate that peptide substrates can affect the kinetics of the IDE reaction by lowering the Km for the substrate. Because we have shown that IDE is oligomeric undergoing a concentration-dependent dimer-tetramer equilibrium, we propose that the activating effect of peptide substrates is a result of their binding to one subunit and inducing a conformational change. We suggest that this conformational change is induced within the dimer, making it more active by increasing the affinity of the adjacent subunit for its substrate and also by shifting the equilibrium from the less active tetramer to the more active dimer. Several observations support this hypothesis. First, only substrates are able to increase IDE activity. Thus, γ-endorphin and Leu-enkephalin, which are not substrates, were without effect. This would suggest that peptide activation is the result of binding to the active site. This would also mean that both subunits do not have to turn over simultaneously; that is, one subunit can retain bound substrate, whereas the other subunit undergoes catalysis. In such a model only one of the two subunits within the dimeric unit need be catalytically active. Secondly, activation is observed with the physiological substrate amyloid β-peptide 1–40 but not with another physiological substrate insulin. This can be explained by suggesting that insulin, which is a dimer of A and B chains, can simultaneously bind to both subunits of the IDE dimer, with the A chain of insulin bound to one subunit and the B chain bound to the other subunit. This would preclude other peptide substrates from binding to an “empty” subunit and activating the enzyme. Peptide binding could only displace insulin, leading to inhibition as is observed. The binding of insulin to both subunits of the IDE dimer can also explain why insulin has such a high affinity for IDE. The kcat for insulin cleavage (0.56 min–1) is not particularly high in relation to other IDE substrates; the kcat for gastrin-releasing factor 1–29 is 23 min–1, whereas the kcat for β-endorphin is 21 min–1 (6.Safavi A. Miller B.C. Cottam L. Hersh L.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14318-14325Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However the Km of 0.13 μm for insulin is considerably lower than that for GRF 1–29 (12 μm) and β-endorphin (13 μm) (6.Safavi A. Miller B.C. Cottam L. Hersh L.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14318-14325Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Last, we show that a mixed dimer containing an active IDE subunit and an inactive low affinity subunit is not activated to nearly the same extent as the wild type enzyme. This can be accounted for by the inability of the inactive subunit to bind substrate. In contrast, a mixed dimer containing an active IDE subunit and an inactive subunit that binds substrate with approximately the same affinity as the wild type enzyme is activated by peptide to nearly the same extent as the wild type enzyme. This can best be explained by the catalytically inactive subunit binding peptide and inducing a conformational change that affects the active subunit. Direct measure of the specific activity of the tetrameric and dimeric forms of IDE show that the dimer is the more active form. This is further supported by the finding that during gel filtration in the presence of bradykinin, the tetramer-containing fractions only partially hydrolyzed bradykinin, whereas in the dimer-containing fractions bradykinin was completely hydrolyzed. Although peptide binding can shift the equilibrium from the less active tetramer to the more active dimer, this effect would only be significant at higher enzyme concentrations where the tetramer predominates. Camberos et al. (27.Camberos M.C. Perez A.A. Udrisar D.P. Wanderley M.I. Cresto J.C. Exp. Biol. Med. 2001; 226: 334-341Crossref Google Scholar) recently report ATP inhibition of insulin cleavage by IDE. Preliminary studies suggest that ATP binds at a distal site that is distinct from the peptide binding site observed in this study. The finding of selective substrate activation of IDE toward amyloid β-peptide cleavage, but not toward insulin cleavage, suggests the opportunity to develop small molecule peptide analogs that increase IDE activity toward amyloid β-peptide cleavage in vivo. Because IDE has been implicated in the clearance of amyloid β-peptides in the brain (20.Miller B.C. Eckman E.A. Sambamurti K. Dobbs N. Chow K.M. Eckman C.B. Hersh L.B. Thiele D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad.

A. 2003; 100: 4162-4167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar), elevating its activity has the potential to decrease amyloid burden without affecting insulin levels and, thus, possibly delay or prevent the onset of Alzheimer's disease. Thus IDE represents a target for the development of a new class of drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease that lowers amyloid β-peptide levels by increasing its rate of catabolism."

The fact suggests that p57 has a specific role that cannot be compensated by other Cdk inhibitors. LIM-kinase 1 (LIMK-1) is a downstream effector of the Rho family of GTPases that phosphorylates and inactivates an actin depolymerization factor, cofilin, to induce the formation of actin fiber. Here we demonstrate that p57 regulates actin dynamics by binding and translocating LIMK-1 from the cytoplasm into the nucleus, which in turn results in a reorganization of actin fiber. The central region of p57, a unique feature among the Cdk inhibitors, and the N-terminal region of LIMK-1, which contains the LIM domains were essential for the interaction. Expression of p57, but not p27Kip1 or a p57 mutant, with a deletion in the central region was shown to induce marked reorganization of actin filament and a translocation of LIMK-1. Our findings indicate p57 may act as a key regulator in embryogenesis by bearing two distinct functions, the regulation of cell cycle through binding to Cdks and the regulation of actin dynamics through binding to LIMK-1, both of which should be important in developmental procedure. p57Kip2 is the only cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor shown to be essential for mouse embryogenesis.

In these regulatory processes, cyclin-Cdk positively drives the progression of the cell cycle, whereas Cdk inhibitory protein (CKI) acts as negative regulators by binding to cyclin-Cdk complexes. On the basis of homology and specificities of interactions, CKIs can be classified into two distinct families, i.e. the INK4 (inhibitor of Cdks) family and the Cip/Kip (Cdk-interacting protein/kinase inhibitory protein) family.

The Cip/Kip family of CKIs is known to induce cell cycle arrest in response to antiproliferative stimuli, including contact inhibition, serum deprivation, and differentiation in vitro (1Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3205) Google Scholar). Conversely, the p27 level was shown to be decreased following mitogenic stimulation of quiescent cells in a number of systems (16Nourse J. Firpo E. Flanagan W.M. Coats S. Polyak K. Lee M.H.

Therefore, the Cip/Kip family may have important roles in the withdrawal of the cells from the cell cycle in the differentiation process.However, among the studies of mice deficient in CKIs, only p57 is shown to be essential for mouse embryogenesis, where neither the lack of p21, p27, nor INK family proteins show gross developmental defects (25Zhang P. Liegeois N.J. Wong C. Finegold M. Hou H. Thompson J.C. Silverman A. Harper J.W. DePinho R.A. Elledge S.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 26Yan Y. Frisen J. Lee M.H. Massague J. Barbacid M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 973-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). These observations suggested that p57 might have a specific role in developmental process that cannot be compensated by other CKIs.Developmental defects shown in p57 knock-out mice include a cleft palate and abnormal endochondral ossification, attributable to increased apoptosis or proliferation at the expense of cell differentiation. Thus, it is of interest to explore the relationship between p57 expression and cell proliferation under physiological circumstances.Recently, we found that p57 accumulates in primary cultured rat osteoblastic cells induced to differentiate by serum starvation. Furthermore, transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) was shown to re-stimulate the proliferation where reversing the differentiation process of osteoblastic cells by rapidly degrading p57 through proteasome-dependent pathway (27Urano T.

There was no significant change in the expressions of p21 and p27 in these experiments, which strongly suggested that p57 may play a specific role in the regulation of osteoblastic cell differentiation.In the present study, to further investigate the significance of p57, we performed yeast two-hybrid screen to search for proteins interacting with p57 in primary cultured osteoblastic cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Sources of materials were as follows: recombinant human TGF-β1 (R & D Systems Inc.), mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Roche Diagnostics Co.), mouse monoclonal anti-c-Myc antibody (Roche Diagnostics Co.), mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma), rabbit polyclonal anti-LIMK-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), rabbit polyclonal anti-p21Cip1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.).

The samples were separated on 18% SDS-PAGE. 32P-Labeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography.Immunocytochemistry—For immunocytochemistry, cells were plated onto a chambered slide glass (Falcon). Cells were fixed and permeabilized with a 4% formaldehyde, 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. After blocking with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 10 min, cells were incubated with either anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody or anti-HA monoclonal antibody, for 1 h at room temperature. After washing three times with PBS, cells were incubated with a fluorescein-anti-mouse IgG antibody (Dako) for 1 h at room temperature. For F-actin staining, rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Inc.) was added in incubation with the secondary antibody. After washing three times with PBS, cells were photographed on a fluorescence microscopy (Leica Microsystems Inc.).RESULTSInteraction of p57Kip2 with LIMK-1-159 by Using Yeast Two-hybrid System—To investigate the relationship to p57 and cell growth and differentiation of osteoblastic cells, we searched for proteins interacting with p57 in osteoblasts by using a yeast two-hybrid system. A p57 fragment devoid of the Cdk inhibitory domain (p57C2; residues 79-335) was used as a bait (Fig. 1A). A complementary DNA (cDNA) library was prepared from primary cultured mouse osteoblastic cells induced to differentiation and was screened as a prey. Sequence analysis of the positive clones revealed that one clone contained the N-terminal portion of LIM-kinase 1 (LIMK-1-159, contains residues 1-159; Fig. 1A). LIMK-1 is a serine/threonine kinase with structures composed of two LIM domains and a PDZ domain in the N-terminal half and a kinase domain in the C-terminal half (Fig. 1A) and has been shown to phosphorylate and inactivate an actin depolymerization factor (ADF), cofilin (29Arber S.

Mizuno K. Nature. 1998; 393: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). The clone obtained from our screening, LIMK-1-159, spanned the two LIM domains. The LIM domain is a double zinc finger motif found in a variety of proteins, including homeodomain-containing transcription factors, cytoskeletal-component proteins, and other signaling molecules, that is thought to be involved in protein-protein interaction. Thus, it is likely that the LIM domains are responsible for the interaction of LIMK-1 with p57.p57 has a Cdk inhibitory domain in its N-terminal region, which is well conserved among the Cip/Kip family of the CKIs, and a region termed QT box, which shares similarity with p27 in its C-terminal region (14Lee M.H. Reynisdottir I. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 15Matsuoka S. Edwards M.C. Bai C. Parker S. Zhang P. Baldini A. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 650-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). In addition, p57 has a unique central region, consisting of a proline-rich region followed by an acidic repeat region in mouse or a region containing proline-alanine repeats in human (14Lee M.H. Reynisdottir I. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 15Matsuoka S. Edwards M.C. Bai C. Parker S. Zhang P. Baldini A. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 650-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar), where its significance remained unclear. Therefore we next investigated which part of the p57 is required for the interaction with LIMK-1. LIMK-1-159 did not show interaction with a shorter C-terminal fragment of p57 (p57C1, residues 267-335; Fig. 1A), nor with a C-terminal fragment of p27 (p27C, residues 95-127) in the yeast two-hybrid system (Fig. 1B and data not shown). Our findings indicated that the central region of p57 has an essential role for the interaction with LIMK-1 and suggested that the interaction is specific to p57.Interaction of p57Kip2 and LIMK-1—We tested the interaction between p57 and LIMK-1 in overexpressed cells. HA-tagged full-length p57 and c-Myc-tagged LIMK-1-159 were transfected in the HEK 293T cells. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the interaction of LIMK-1-159 with full-length p57 (Fig. 2A). Full-length LIMK-1 was also shown to interact with p57, but not with p27 or p21 in similar experiments, indicating that LIMK-1 interacts specifically to p57 (Fig. 2, B and C). Finally, interaction of endogenous p57 to LIMK-1 was also demonstrated in osteoblastic cells induced to differentiation by serum starvation (Fig. 2D).Fig. 2Interaction of p57Kip2 and LIMK-1.A, co-transfection and co-immunoprecipitation assay confirmed the interaction of p57 and the c-Myc-tagged LIMK-1-159 fragment in HEK293T cells. B, p57 bound to full-length LIMK-1 in HEK293T cells. C, LIMK-1 binds specifically to p57, but not with p21 or p27. Lane 1, HEK293T cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged LIMK1 expression plasmid (pFLAG-LIMK-1) as a control. Lanes 2 and 3, cells were co-transfected with HA-tagged p21 expression plasmid (pHA-p21) together with pFLAG-LIMK-1. Lanes 4 and 5, with HA-tagged p27 expression plasmid (pHA-p27) together with pFLAG-LIMK-1. Lanes 6 and 7, HA-tagged p57 expression plasmid (pHA-p57) together with pFLAG-LIMK-1. Extracts obtained from each cells were immunoprecipitated with the antibodies indicated and blotted with anti-FLAG antibody to visualize LIMK-1, where no antibody was added in the negative controls (lanes 2, 4, and 6). The amounts of each CKIs immunoprecipitated in the experiment were confirmed by blotting the same membrane with anti-HA antibody (lower panel). D, binding of endogenous p57 with LIMK-1 was demonstrated in primary cultured osteoblastic cells induced to differentiation by serum starvation, where the binding was not seen when the cells were re-stimulated by TGF-β1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)p57Kip2 Binding Does Not Inhibit the Kinase Activity of LIMK-1—Next, we examined whether the binding of p57 affects the kinase activity of LIMK-1. FLAG-tagged LIMK-1 was expressed in HEK 293T cells, together with either p57, p57, with deletion in its unique central region (p57Δ, Fig. 1A), or p27 (Fig. 3A). LIMK-1 was immunoprecipitated from total cell extracts prepared from each cells, and the kinase activity was measured using cofilin as a substrate. Cofilin-phosphorylating activity of LIMK-1 was reduced in cells transfected with p57 compared with the cells transfected with p57Δ or p27 (Fig. 3A, upper panel). However, the amount of LIMK-1 expressed in cells transfected with p57 was also reduced compared with the cells transfected with p57Δ or p27 (Fig. 3A, lower panel). Relative kinase activities to phosphorylate cofilin did not differ significantly when they were normalized with the amounts of LIMK-1 expressed in each cell (Fig. 3B). Thus, we conclude that binding of p57 to LIMK-1 does not directly inhibit the kinase activity of LIMK-1. It is possible that the interaction may affect the expression level of LIMK-1, since reduced expression of LIMK-1 in cells co-transfected with p57 compared with the cells co-transfected with p57Δ or p27 was seen in repeated experiments, where the mechanism is not clear.Fig. 3p57Kip2 binding does not inhibit the kinase activity of LIMK-1.A, HEK293T cells were co-transfected with pFLAG-LIMK-1 (lanes 1, 3, 4, and 5), or pFLAG-LIMK-1-D460A, a dominant negative mutation (lane 2), together with pcDNA (lanes 1 and 2), pHA-p57 (lane 3), pHA-p57Δ (lane 4), or pHA-p27 (lane 5). The lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody and subjected to kinase reaction in vitro. The kinase activity was measured by 32P incorporation into cofilin (upper panel). The middle panel indicates Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) staining of cofilin. The amounts of the LIMK-1 protein immunoprecipitated and subjected in each assay was quantified by immunoblot analysis with anti-LIMK-1 antibody (lower panel). Expression of FLAG tagged LIMK-1 protein in the cells were quantified by immunoblot analysis with anti-FLAG antibody. B, activities to phosphorylate cofilin were normalized by the amount of LIMK-1 subjected in each reaction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effect of p57Kip2 on Actin Dynamics—Finally, we investigated whether this interaction affects the actin cytoskeleton of the cells. Forced expression of FLAG-tagged LIMK-1 in COS-7 cells induced the formation of thick bundled actin fibers, which is consistent with previous reports (29Arber S. Barbayannis F.A. Hanser H. Schneider C. Stanyon C.A. Bernard O. Caroni P. Nature. 1998; 393: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar, 30Yang N. Higuchi O. Ohashi K. Nagata K. Wada A. Kangawa K. Nishida E. Mizuno K. Nature. 1998; 393: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). Co-expression of p57, but not p57Δ or p27, resulted in the marked dissolution of these fibers, which may reflect an inhibition of the activity of LIMK-1 (Fig. 4). This was intriguing, as p57 did not show significant inhibition of the kinase activity of LIMK-1 in our experiment (see above). p57, as a Cdk inhibitor, has been shown to be localized specifically in the nucleus. Since the localization of LIMK-1 has been reported to be cytoplasmic, thereby affecting the actin dynamics in the cytoplasm (35Yang N. Higuchi O. Mizuno K. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 241: 242-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), we were prompted to investigate if the expression of p57 may affect the subcellular location of LIMK-1. As expected, in the cells co-expressing p57, LIMK-1 staining was demonstrated mainly in the nucleus, in sharp contrast with the cells expressing LIMK-1 alone, or cells co-expressing either p57Δ or p27, where LIMK-1 remained in the cytoplasm leaving the nucleus unstained (Fig. 4). p57, p57Δ, and p27 were all shown to be localized in the nucleus in duplicated experiments (data not shown).Fig. 4Effect of p57Kip2 on LIMK-1-induced actin reorganization. COS-7 cells were transfected with pFLAG-LIMK-1 and pcDNA, pHA-p57, pHA-p57Δ, or pHA-p27. Cells were stained with anti-FLAG antibody and phalloidin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONIn this paper, we have shown evidences that p57 binds to LIMK-1, both in vitro and in vivo, and can regulate actin dynamics through this interaction. LIMK-1 is a LIM domain containing protein kinase, which regulates actin dynamics through phosphorylation of an ADF family protein, cofilin at Ser-3. Actin depolymerization activity of cofilin is inactivated by this phosphorylation, which results in stabilization and accumulation of assembled actin filaments in the cells (29Arber S.

Inhibitors of apoptosis (IAP) family members, including NAIP, cIAP-1, cIAP-2, XIAP/hILP, survivin, and BRUCE, block apoptosis by binding and potently inhibiting caspases. Activation of NF-κB contributes to cIAP-2 induction; however, the cellular mechanisms regulating cIAP-2 expression have not been entirely defined. In this study, we examined the role of the PKC and NF-κB pathways in the regulation of cIAP-2 in human colon cancers. We found that cIAP-2 mRNA levels were markedly increased in human colon cancer cells by treatment with the phorbol ester, phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA), or bryostatin 1. Inhibitors of the Ca2+-independent, novel PKC isoforms, but not inhibitors of MAPK, PI3-kinase, or PKA, blocked PMA-stimulated cIAP-2 mRNA expression, suggesting a role of PKC in PMA-mediated cIAP-2 induction. Pretreatment with the PKCδ-selective inhibitor rottlerin or transfection with an antisense PKCδ oligonucleotide inhibited PMA-induced cIAP-2 expression, whereas cotransfection with a PKCδ plasmid induced cIAP-2 promoter activity, which, taken together, identifies a role for PKCδ in cIAP-2 induction. Treatment with the proteasome inhibitor, MG132 or inhibitors of NF-κB (e.g. PDTC and gliotoxin), decreased PMA-induced up-regulation of cIAP-2. PMA-induced NF-κB activation was blocked by either GF109203x, MG132, PDTC, or gliotoxin. Moreover, overexpression of PKCδ-induced cIAP-2 promoter activity and increased NF-κB transactivation, suggesting regulation of cIAP-2 expression by a PKCδ/NF-κB pathway. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate a role for a PKC/NF-κB-dependent pathway in the regulation of cIAP-2 expression in human colon cancer cells.

Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States with ∼130,000 new cases diagnosed per year (1Jemal A. Murray T. Samuels A. Ghafoor A. Ward E. Thun M.J. CA Cancer J. Clin. 2003; 53: 5-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar). Despite advances in surgical management and multimodality therapy, ∼50% of patients with cancers of the colon and rectum die from their disease (2Declan Fleming R.Y. Surg. Oncol. 1998; 7: 125-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A significant obstacle for the successful management of patients with colorectal cancer is intrinsic drug resistance or, in patients who initially respond to chemotherapy, acquired drug resistance (3Gorlick R. Bertino J.R. Semin. Oncol. 1999; 26: 606-611PubMed Google Scholar). Alterations in genes that confer a survival and anti-apoptotic advantage and the related signaling transduction pathways involved in the regulation of the cell cycle or in DNA damage repair may result in the resistance of populations of cancer cells to chemotherapy (3Gorlick R. Bertino J.R. Semin. Oncol. 1999; 26: 606-611PubMed Google Scholar). Programmed cell death, often referred to as apoptosis, is a physiological cell suicide program that is critical for the development and maintenance of healthy tissues. Caspases are synthesized initially as single polypeptide chains representing latent precursors that undergo proteolytic processing at specific aspartic acid residues to produce subunits that form the active heterotetrameric protease (4Deveraux Q.L.

To date, six human IAP family proteins have been identified: NAIP, cIAP-1/HIAP-2, cIAP-2/HIAP-1, XIAP/hILP, Survivin, and BRUCE (4Deveraux Q.L. Reed J.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2281) Google Scholar). IAPs have been shown to be involved in the resistance of certain tumor cells to chemotherapeutic drugs or other apoptotic agents (12Cheng J.Q. Jiang X. Fraser M. Li M. Dan H.C. Sun M. Tsang B.K. Drug Resist. Updat. 2002; 5: 131-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). For example, overexpression of cIAP-2 appears to be responsible for sustained neutrophilia in some cases of chronic neutrophilic leukemia (13Hasegawa T. Suzuki K. Sakamoto C. Ohta K. Nishiki S.

Our laboratory is interested in the regulation of proteins and signaling pathways which can contribute to the inhibition of cell death in resistant cancer cells. Previously, we have shown that inhibition of NF-κB or PI 3-kinase sensitizes colon cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis (35Thomas R.P. Farrow B.J. Kim S. May M.J. Hellmich M.R. Evers B.M.

The purpose of our present study was to better define the cellular mechanisms regulating the expression of the IAP family members in human colon cancer cells. Here, we show that expression of one of the IAP family member, cIAP-2, is preferentially induced in human colon cancer cells following PMA treatment; inhibition of Ca2+-independent, novel PKC isoforms, but not inhibition of MAPK, PI3-kinase and PKA, blocked PMA-stimulated cIAP-2 mRNA expression, suggesting a role for PKC in PMA-mediated cIAP-2 induction. Further studies utilizing complementary approaches identified PKCδ as a critical isoform mediating these effects. Finally, a role for NF-κB activation, mediated through PKC, acts ultimately to induce cIAP-2 expression. Thus, these results demonstrate that the PKCδ/NF-κB pathway plays an important role in the regulation of the anti-apoptosis protein cIAP-2 in human colon cancer cells.

PMA, and inhibitors were initially dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and compared with cells treated with Me2SO at the same final concentration. RNA Isolation and RNase Protection Assays—RNA was isolated from cells using Ultraspec RNA according to the manufacturer's protocol. RiboQuant MultiProbe RNase Protection Assay (RPA) System was used for the detection of multiple, specific mRNA species as we have previously described (38Wang Q. Wang X. Hernandez A. Hellmich M.R. Gatalica Z. Evers B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36602-36610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). 32P-labeled antisense RNA probes were prepared using the Human Apoptosis hAPO-5 Template Set and hybridization performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Protein Preparation and Western Immunoblot—Western immunoblot analyses were performed as described previously (39Wang Q. Ding Q. Dong Z. Ehlers R.A. Evers B.M. Anticancer Res. 2000; 20: 75-83PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were lysed with TNN buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 25 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A) at 4 °C for 30 min. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C) and protein concentrations determined using the method of Bradford (40Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216391) Google Scholar). Briefly, total protein was resolved on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Filters were incubated overnight at 4 °C in blotting solution (Tris-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat dried milk and 0.1% Tween 20). Protein expression was detected with antibodies to various PKC isoforms, cIAP-2, HA, or to β-actin following blotting with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and visualized using ECL detection. PKCδ Kinase Assay—PKCδ activity was determined in cell extracts as described (41Brandt D.T. Goerke A. Heuer M. Gimona M. Leitges M. Kremmer E. Lammers R. Haller H. Mischak H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34073-34078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, total PKCδ was determined by measuring the incorporation of 32P into MBP. Extracts from Caco-2 cells treatment with or without PMA were incubated with PKCδ antibody overnight and with protein A beads for 3 h at 4 °C by gentle rocking. Immunocomplexed beads were washed twice with cell lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4; 2 mm dithiothreitol; 0.1 mm Na3 VO4; 10 mm MgCl2; and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP). Immunocomplexes were resuspended in 40 μl of kinase buffer supplemented with 10 μm ATP and 5 μg of MBP and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Kinase reactions were terminated with SDS sample buffer. Samples were size-fractionated by SDS-PAGE and 32P-labeled MBP was quantified autoradiographically after fixing and drying the gel. Preparation of Nuclear Extracts and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs)—The nuclear extracts were prepared from Caco-2 cells according to the procedure described by Han et al. (42Han Y. Meng T. Murray N.R. Fields A.P. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 939-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). EMSAs were performed as described previously (43Wang Q. Kim S. Wang X. Evers B.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 853-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Nuclear extracts (10 μg) were incubated with 40,000 cpm of 32P-labeled NF-κB consensus oligonucleotide (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGG-3′) and 2 μg of poly(dA·dT) in a buffer containing 8% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in a final volume of 20 μl, for 15 min at room temperature. For supershift studies, 2 μl of antiserum was added to the nuclear protein for 20 min at room temperature prior to the addition of labeled probe. The complexes were fractionated on 6% native polyacrylamide gels run in 1× TBE buffer (89 mm Tris, 89 mm boric acid, and 2.0 mm EDTA), dried, and exposed to Kodak X-AR film at -70 °C. Competition binding experiments were performed by the addition of the nonradioactive oligonucleotide, in 100-fold molar excess, at the time of addition of radioactive probe. Transient Transfections, Luciferase Assays—Caco-2 cells (0.1 × 106/well) were seeded in 6-well plates 24 h prior to transfection. Cells were then transfected with 1 μg of pTB701-HA vector or pTB701-HA-PKCδ and 0.3 μg of the cIAP-2 promoter-luciferase construct or pNF-κB-luc construct using LipofectAMINE following the supplier's instructions. The pRL-Tk-luc plasmid (0.05 μg per well) was co-transfected to normalize for variation in transfection efficiency. After 12 h, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then maintained in fresh medium for 36 h prior to harvest. In each experiment, the pGL2 plasmid was also transfected in separate wells to compare the specific activity of promoter-reporter constructs with the basic activity of the promoterless plasmid. Luciferase assays were performed as described previously (43Wang Q. Kim S. Wang X. Evers B.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 853-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, 48 h after transfection, the cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, harvested and lysed with 1× cell culture lysis reagent. Luciferase activity in 20 μl of extract was assayed with the dual luciferase assay system. Light emissions were integrated for the initial 10 s of emission by using a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory). Transient transfection of cells with PKCδ oligonucleotides was performed using antisense (5′-CCCACCATGGCGCCGTTC-3′) and sense oligonucleotide sequences to the translation start site of PKCδ (44Shih S.C. Mullen A. Abrams K. Mukhopadhyay D. Claffey K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15407-15414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were dissolved in sterile deionized water to a final concentration of 1 mm, aliquoted, and stored at -20 °C until use. Antisense and sense oligonucleotides to PKCδ (1 μm) were transfected into Caco-2 cells using LipofectAMINE. After transfection, cells were incubated 48 h before treatment. PMA Treatment Induces cIAP-2 mRNA and Protein Expression in Caco-2 Cells—PKC isoforms are involved in the regulation of certain anti-apoptotic proteins (23Nishizuka Y.

To better delineate upstream signaling pathways responsible for cIAP-2 induction, the human colon cancer cell line Caco-2 was treated with the phorbol ester PMA, and RNA extracted for RPA using a multiprobe (hAPO-5; BD Pharmingen) containing cDNAs for a number of anti-apoptotic genes as well as the housekeeping genes L32 and GAPDH (Fig. 1). Treatment with PMA (100 nm) markedly induced cIAP-2 mRNA expression over a time course with maximal induction occurring 4 h after treatment (Fig. 1A). In contrast, xIAP, another IAP family member, was not affected by PMA treatment. The expression of TRAF-4, a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor (TRAF) family of putative signal-transducing proteins, and cIAP-1 was slightly increased with PMA. The remainder of the apoptosis-related genes in this multiprobe template were either not expressed in Caco-2 cells or the level was not affected by PMA. The expression of L32 and GAPDH remained constant thus demonstrating equal loading. Caco-2 cells were then treated with varying concentrations of PMA and harvested at 4 h (Fig. 1B). Induction of cIAP-2 was noted with the lowest concentration (5 nm); maximal expression occurred with dosages between 20 and 50 nm. Once again, expression of TRAF-4 was minimally affected and expression of L32 and GAPDH remained constant. Steady-state mRNA levels may be modulated by transcriptional or post-transcriptional mechanisms. To assess whether the induction of cIAP-2 was due to an increase in transcription, Caco-2 cells were treated with PMA (100 nm) for 4 h in the presence or absence of actinomycin D (10 μg/ml), which inhibits transcription by inhibiting DNA-primed RNA polymerase (45Shi M.M. Kugelman A. Iwamoto T. Tian L. Forman H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26512-26517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and assessed by RPA (Fig. 1C). As expected, treatment with PMA alone induced cIAP-2 expression; this induction was blocked by actinomycin D suggesting that PMA increases cIAP-2 expression levels by increasing transcription. There was no effect of either PMA or actinomycin D on the expression of TRPM-2 (testosterone repressed prostate message 2), an apoptotic gene, or the housekeeping genes L32 and GAPDH. We next determined whether the induction of cIAP-2 mRNA levels by PMA also resulted in the corresponding induction of cIAP-2 protein expression (Fig. 1D). Treatment with PMA (100 nm) increased cIAP-2 protein expression. The blot was stripped and reprobed with β-actin to ensure equal protein loading. Taken together, these results identify induction of cIAP-2 mRNA and protein levels with PMA treatment. Regulation of PMA-stimulated cIAP-2 Expression Through the PKC Pathway—To better delineate the signaling pathway leading to PMA-mediated cIAP-2 induction, Caco-2 cells were pretreated for 30 min with inhibitors to PKC (GF109203x), MEK (PD98059), PI 3-kinase (wortmannin), or PKA (H89) prior to addition of PMA (100 nm). Cells were harvested 4 h later and RNA extracted for RPA (Fig. 2A). As expected, PMA increased cIAP-2 expression (lane 2); this induction was completely blocked by treatment with GF109203x (lane 3). In contrast, treatment with PD98059, wortmannin, or H89 did not block cIAP-2 induction by PMA (lanes 4-6). Treatment with the inhibitors alone had no effect on cIAP-2 expression (lanes 7-10). Similar to PMA, the non-phorbol ester PKC agonist bryostatin-1, induced cIAP-2 expression; this induction was completely blocked by GF109203x treatment (Fig. 2B). Minimal to no effect on xIAP or TRAF-4 expression was noted with either PMA, bryostatin 1 or the inhibitors. In a similar fashion, L32 and GAPDH expression remained constant indicating equal loading. Bryostatin stimulates various PKC isoforms in certain cell lines (46Yoo J. Nichols A. Song J.C. Mammen J. Calvo I. Worrell R.T. Cuppoletti J. Matlin K. Matthews J.B. Am. J. Physiol.

Yeast SAC1 mutants display a wide array of phenotypes including inositol auxotrophy, cold sensitivity, secretory defects, disturbed ATP transport into the ER, or suppression of actin gene mutations. At present, it is not clear how these phenotypes relate to the finding that SAC1 displays polyphosphoinositide phosphatase activity.

Mutation of a putative COPI interaction motif (KXKXX) at its C terminus abolishes interaction with COPI and causes accumulation of hSAC1 in the Golgi. In addition, we generated a catalytically inactive mutant, demonstrate that its lipid binding capacity is unaltered, and show that it accumulates in the Golgi, incapable of interacting with the COPI complex despite the presence of the KXKXX motif.

For example, mutations in the OCRL1 gene, which encodes a phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate 5-phosphatase of the trans-Golgi network, are responsible for the oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe (3Dressman M.A. Olivos-Glander I.M.

Synaptojanin 2 displays similar substrate specificity, yet a wider tissue distribution than synaptojanin 1 and appears to act at an earlier step in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (15Nemoto Y.

None of the human PtdIns phosphatases containing a SAC domain have been characterized in depth for their biological function. Information about human SAC1 (hSAC1) is hitherto restricted to an EST (KIAA0851), which maps to the C3CER1 segment on chromosome 3p21.3. C3CER1 is commonly eliminated in SCID-derived tumors (17Kiss H. Kedra D. Kiss C. Kost-Alimova M. Yang Y. Klein G. Imreh S. Dumanski J.P. Genomics. 2001; 73: 10-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 18Kiss H. Yang Y. Kiss C. Andersson K. Klein G. Imreh S. Dumanski J.P. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 10: 52-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Human SAC2 was enzymatically characterized and found to exert 5-phosphatase activity specific for PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (19Minagawa T. Ijuin T. Mochizuki Y. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22011-22015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Yeast strains with mutations in SAC1 exhibit an array of phenotypes including inositol auxotrophy (20Whitters E.A. Cleves A.E. McGee T.P. Skinner H.B. Bankaitis V.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 79-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), cold sensitivity (21Novick P. Osmond B.C. Botstein D. Genetics. 1989; 121: 659-674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), secretory defects in chitin deposition (13Schorr M. Then A. Tahirovic S. Hug N. Mayinger P. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1421-1426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), multiple drug sensitivity (22Hughes W.E. Pocklington M.J. Orr E. Paddon C.J. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1111-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and ATP transport deficiencies into the ER (23Kochendörfer K.U. Then A.R. Kearns B.G. Bankaitis V.A. Mayinger P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1506-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Mutations in yeast SAC1 are capable of suppressing lethality of some secretory pathway (SEC) mutants, like SEC14 deficiency (24Cleves A.E. Novick P.J. Bankaitis V.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2939-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). SEC14, a phosphatidylinositol/phosphatidylcholine transport protein, is responsible for establishing a critical phospholipid composition in yeast Golgi membranes and is required for secretory competence (25Rivas M.P. Kearns B.G. Xie Z. Guo S. Sekar M.C. Hosaka K. Kagiwada S. York J.D. Bankaitis V.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2235-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This is in line with the finding that ySac1p negatively regulates a pool of PtdIns(4)P in the yeast Golgi that is important for forward trafficking of chitin synthases to the cell periphery (13Schorr M. Then A. Tahirovic S. Hug N. Mayinger P. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1421-1426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells, three vesicle-based protein cargo trafficking systems have evolved, which are each defined by a special set of membrane-covering protein coats. Clathrin-coated vesicles allow transport from the plasma membrane to the trans-Golgi network and from the trans-Golgi network to endosomes. Coatomer II (COPII)-coated vesicles have been assigned to ER to Golgi anterograde transport (26Kirchhausen T. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 27Barlowe C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In contrast, coatomer (COPI)-coated vesicles are involved in membrane traffic mainly between Golgi and ER or intra-Golgi compartments (28Lowe M. Kreis T.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 53-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 29Barlowe C. Traffic. 2000; 1: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The COPI coatomer consists of seven proteins (α, β, β′, γ, δ, ϵ, and ζ). Formation of the COPI coat depends on the GTPase ARF1 (ADP-ribosylation factor 1), which in its GTP-bound form inserts into the target membrane and attracts coatomer components prior to vesicle budding. GTP hydrolysis by ARF correlates with uncoating of COPI proteins followed by vesicle fusion with the target membrane (26Kirchhausen T. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 30Nickel W. Brugger B. Wieland F.T. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3235-3240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ySac1p is described as an integral protein of ER and Golgi membranes with the SAC domain pointing toward the cytoplasm. There is still controversy about the number of functional transmembrane (TM) domains and thus the topology of SAC1, since ySac1p was demonstrated to utilize its two C-terminal TM domains (31Konrad G. Schlecker T. Faulhammer F. Mayinger P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10547-10554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), whereas rSAC1 apparently only uses the first one (11Nemoto Y. Kearns B.G. Wenk M.R. Chen H. Mori K. Alb Jr., J.G. De Camilli P. Bankaitis V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34293-34305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In addition to this controversy, the subcellular localization of endogenous mammalian SAC1 is still open, and it is not clear whether it is involved in the secretory pathway to the same extent as in yeast, which of its functions might depend on its enzymatic activity, or which binding proteins might aid in its biological functions. To address these questions, we characterized human SAC1 and show that it localizes to ER and Golgi. We generated a PtdIns phosphatase inactive variant by mutation of the core CX5R(T/S) motif (hSAC1-C/S) and find it accumulated in the Golgi. We also demonstrate for the first time that wild type hSAC1 interacts with members of the coatomer I complex and with itself. Mutation of a putative COPI-interaction motif, K(X)KXX, in hSAC1 causes a loss in COPI binding and accumulation in the Golgi. Interestingly, although the hSAC1-C/S mutant has an unaltered COPI interaction motif, it fails to efficiently bind to coatomer I. Our findings suggest that the localization of hSAC1 might not only depend on the mere presence of an intact COPI interaction motif and that the PtdIns phosphatase function of hSAC1 is needed to achieve appropriate usage of the K(X)KXX motif. Molecular Cloning of hSAC1 and Plasmids—The EST KIAA0851 was found to contain an open reading frame that is highly homologous to the yeast enzyme SAC1 (31.8% identity, 46.1% similarity). Human SAC1 cDNA was amplified from brain mRNA (Invitrogen) by reverse transcriptase-PCR using the following primers: primer a, 5′-GAG AGA GAA GGA AGG AGG TGG T-3′; primer b, 5′-TGT GGA AAA GTA TGC CTG CTA ATA GTG-3′. PCR products were subcloned into pCRII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) generating pCRII-hSAC1 and confirmed to be identical to KIAA0851 (nucleotide coordinates 40–2272) via sequencing. The hSAC1 ORF is covered by KIAA0851 nucleotides 70–1833. The hSAC1-C/S mutation was introduced into pCRII-hSAC1 with a Transfomer™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Clontech) using mutagenic primer 5′-GTT CCG AAG CAA TAG CAT GGA TTG TCT AG-3′ and selection primer 5′-GTG ACT GGT GAG GCC TCA ACC AAG TC-3′ according to the manufacturer's instructions. The hSAC1-KEKID mutation was generated by PCR using the following primers: primer c, 5′-GCA CAA TCC ATC TGG TGG CA-3′; mutagenic primer (primer d), 5′-A TCC TCA GTC TAT CGC TTC TGC CTG GA-3′ with the changed nucleotides underlined. The respective fragment was cloned into pCRII-TOPO, and an EcoRI fragment thereof was swapped into pGFP-hSAC1wt (see below). All mutations were confirmed by sequencing. An N-terminal FLAG tag (amino acids MDYDDDDKATAA, with hSAC1 amino acids 2–5 underlined) was fused to hSAC1wt and hSAC1-C/S coding sequences using standard PCR techniques. Insertion into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) generated pcDNA3.1-FLAG-hSAC1wt and pcDNA3.1-FLAG-hSAC1-C/S. To generate Schizosaccharomyces pombe expression vectors pESP-hSAC1wt and pESP-hSAC1-C/S, the BamHI site of pESP1 (Stratagene) was exploited to introduce the hSAC1 variants following the PCR-mediated addition of BamHI sites directly to the respective coding sequences. Products were confirmed by sequencing. BamHI-flanked ORFs from pESP-hSAC1wt and pESP-hSAC1-C/S were used to generate Cu2+-inducible hSAC1 variants in pYEX-BX (Clontech), resulting in pYEX-BX-hSAC1wt and pYEX-BX-hSAC1-C/S, respectively. To build pGFP-hSAC1wt and pGFP-hSAC1-C/S, the same BamHI-fragments were used to generate intermediates in pENTR3C prior to Gateway™-mediated shuttling (Invitrogen) into gEGFP-A30, an appropriately modified derivative of pEGFP-C2 (Clontech). Inducible Expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae—The vectors pYEX-BX, pYEX-BX-hSAC1wt, and pYEX-BX-hSAC1-C/S were transformed into the SAC1 null strain ATY 202 (31Konrad G. Schlecker T. Faulhammer F. Mayinger P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10547-10554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), streaked out onto Cu2+-containing inositol-free plates (0.5 mm CuCl2), and monitored for growth. Expression and Purification of Recombinant GST-hSAC1 Proteins in S. pombe—The vectors pESP-hSAC1wt and pESP-hSAC1-C/S, containing GST-hSAC1 fusion sequences, were transformed into the S. pombe strain SP-Q01 (Stratagene) and induced as described by the manufacturer (Stratagene). Cells were disrupted by French press in lysis buffer containing 0.3 m sorbitol, 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2,10mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.2, and 1% Triton X-100 followed by batch purification of GST fusion proteins with glutathione 4B FF-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer. Washings were done with lysis puffer, and elution of proteins occurred in 10 mm Tris/Cl, 10 mm glutathione, pH 7.5. For storage at –80 °C, glycerol was added to 25% final concentration. Identification of hSAC1 Interaction Partners—Following SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining, respective gel pieces were excised and sent to Mobidab Molekularbiologie GmbH (Leipzig, Germany) for MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis. Peptide masses corresponding to human α-COP were covered by 36 peptides (Mowse score 111, p < 0.05). 25 peptide masses matched β-COP (Mowse score 66; p < 0.05). Phosphatase Activity Assay—To measure phosphatase activity, a modified version of a malachite green assay was used (32Maehama T. Taylor G.S. Slama J.T. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 279: 248-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Phospho inositides were purchased from Cell Signals Inc., and phosphatidylserine was obtained from Sigma (P-1060). 1 μg of recombinant GST-hSAC1wt and GST-hSAC1-C/S in 25 μl of storage buffer were incubated (1 h, 32 °C) with 25 μl of liposomes, prepared by sonification in reaction buffer (500 μm phosphatidylserine, 100 μm diC16-PtdInsP isoform, 200 mm sodium acetate, 100 mm Tris-base, 100 mm Bis-Tris, 20 μg/ml porcine gelatin, pH 6.0). Reactions were stopped by the addition of 20 μl of 100 mmN-ethylmaleimide and centrifugation (14,000 × g, 15 min). 25 μl of the reaction supernatant was transferred to a multiwell plate, incubated with (20 min, room temperature) 50 μl of malachite green solution (33Harder K.W. Owen P. Wong L.K. Aebersold R. Clark-Lewis I. Jirik F.R. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) to quantify released phosphate at 600 nm. Phosphate release was calibrated to a dilution series of KH2PO4. Peptides, Immunization, and Antibodies—Peptides were synthesized according to standard procedures followed by purification on a reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatograph. Peptides used for competition experiments were hSAC1/578–587 (PRLVQKEKID), hSAC1/41–55 (TLAVKKDVPPSAVTR), and crosstide (biotin-GRPRTSSFAEG). hSAC1 antibodies were raised against recombinant GST-hSAC1 wild type protein in rabbits (Eurogentec). GST-reactive immunoglobulins were removed by adsorption to GST-Sepharose beads (serum 252 and serum 253). Additionally, polyclonal peptide antisera 69 and 7889 were raised against hSAC1 amino acids 570–587 and 41–55, respectively. The following antibodies were commercially available and used according to the manufacturer's instructions: anti-FLAG M2 (F-3165; Sigma), anti-GFP (1814460; Roche Applied Science), anti-COPA (PA1-067; Affinity Bioreagents), anti-COPB, -E, and -G, (sc-13335, sc-13345, and sc-14167; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-Sec61α (sc-12322; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-golgin-97 (A-21270; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), anti-GST (27-4577-01; Amersham Biosciences), anti-Golgi 58 K protein (G2404; Sigma), and phospho-Ser193 AFX (sc-12892; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoprecipitations and Western Blotting—Transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose was performed according to standard procedures. For hSAC1 immunoblotting, membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in TBST (50 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) and washed with TBST. Visualization was done using suitable horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL. For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were prepared by scraping subconfluent cells on ice into lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, Complete™), followed by passage through a 26-gauge needle (five times), clearance of the lysate by centrifugation (10 min, 6000 × g, 4 °C), and preincubation (15 min, 4 °C) with either protein A- or protein G-Sepharose 4B FF (Amersham Biosciences). Precleared lysates were incubated (2 h, 4 °C) with antibodies, followed by the addition and further incubation (45 min, 4 °C) of 50 μl of protein A- or protein G-Sepharose and five washes in lysis buffer. For oligomerization experiments, precleared lysates were incubated (32 °C, 30 min) prior to antibody reactions. Samples were boiled in 2× sample buffer (Roti®-load 1; Roth) and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Lipid Binding Assay—For assessment of phospholipid binding properties, PIP Strips™ (Echelon, Inc.) were blocked (1 h, room temperature) with TBST including 3% bovine serum albumin, incubated either with purified GST, GST-hSAC1wt, or GST-hSAC1-C/S at a concentration of 0.5 μg/ml in blocking buffer at 4 °C overnight. Following three washes in TBST, PIP Strips™ were incubated (1 h, room temperature) with anti-GST antibody in TBST followed by standard secondary antibody incubation and ECL to detect GST-tagged proteins bound to the phospholipid spots on the membrane. Cell Lines and Media—Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. All media were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum unless stated otherwise. Human glioblastoma cells U373MG were kept in Eagle's minimum essential medium (BioWhittaker), human prostate carcinoma cells PC-3 were kept in RPMI1640 (Invitrogen), human colon carcinoma cells HCT116, HeLa (cervix carcinoma) cells were kept in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), and monkey kidney COS-7 cells were kept in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen). Mammalian expression constructs (10 μg) were transfected using Fugene 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To generate U373MG cell lines stably expressing FLAG-hSAC1wt, FLAG-hSAC1-C/S, GFP-hSAC1wt, and GFP-hSAC1-C/S, the constructs and appropriate vector controls were transfected and selected in the presence of G418 (1 mg/ml; Calbiochem). Resistant clones were routinely kept in medium containing 200 μg/ml G418. Prior to experiments, cells were adapted for 24 h to G418-free medium. Fluorescence Microscopy—Cells grown to 70–80% confluence on chamber slides (Nalge Nunc) were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, permeabilized (10 min) with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100, and washed. All washes were in PBS. For detection of golgin-97, samples were blocked (1 h, room temperature) in 1× Roti®-block (Roth) and incubated (1 h, 37 °C) with antibody in Roti®-block. After washing, cells were incubated with Cy3-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2 (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories Inc.; 1:500 in 1× Roti®-block) for 30 min. For detection of Sec61α, p58, and endogenous hSAC1, fixed cells were incubated with 0.1 m glycine in PBS (1 min, room temperature), permeabilized in 0.4% Triton X-100 in PBS (3 min, room temperature), and incubated with respective antibodies in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (1 h, 37 °C). Secondary antibodies used were Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Dianova) or DTAF-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG for hSAC1, fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled donkey anti-goat IgG (sc-2024; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or Cy3-labeled rabbit anti-goat IgG F(ab′)2 for Sec61α, and Cy-3 labeled goat anti-mouse IgG for p58. Slides were mounted in Mowiol (Sigma). Pictures were recorded using confocal microscopes as indicated in the figure legends. Picture processing was performed with Adobe® Photoshop 5.5 software. For reasons of simplicity, the anti-hSAC1 immunofluorescence channel is displayed in green, independent of the fluorochrome of the secondary antibody used. Identification of Human SAC1 and Generation of a PtdIns phosphatase Inactive Mutant—To clone hSAC1 cDNA, we used a set of primers flanking the ORF found in the EST KIAA0851. A cDNA fragment identical to KIAA0851 nucleotides 40–2272 was amplified via reverse transcriptase-PCR from brain mRNA (see “Experimental Procedures”). Two other human ESTs (KIAA0966 and KIAA0274) also contain a SAC1 homology domain within their sequence. KIAA0966 was recently designated hSAC2 (19Minagawa T. Ijuin T. Mochizuki Y. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22011-22015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), whereas KIAA0274 still awaits characterization. The hSAC1 ORF (587 amino acids (aa)) exhibits 32% identity to ySac1p and 95% identity to rSAC1 (11Nemoto Y. Kearns B.G. Wenk M.R. Chen H. Mori K. Alb Jr., J.G. De Camilli P. Bankaitis V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34293-34305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and is predicted to code for a protein of 64 kDa with a pI of 6.69. Inspection of the primary amino acid sequence reveals (Fig. 1) two potential TM domains at the C terminus (aa 521–543, aa 550–569) also present in ySAC1. A third TM domain at the N terminus of hSAC1 is not consistently predicted using different software tools and is therefore omitted in Fig. 1. A highly conserved phosphatase signature motif, CX5R(T/S), starts at aa 389 (Fig. 1). Furthermore, a putative leucine zipper (hSAC1, aa 98–126) is conserved in the mammalian SAC1 family members but absent in Caenorhabditis elegans or ySac1p (Fig. 1) (17Kiss H. Kedra D. Kiss C. Kost-Alimova M. Yang Y. Klein G. Imreh S. Dumanski J.P. Genomics. 2001; 73: 10-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To generate a PtdIns phosphatase inactive mutant, cysteine 389 was replaced by serine to generate hSAC1-C/S. Sequences covering the ORFs for wild type and mutant hSAC1 were subcloned into various expression constructs (see “Experimental Procedures”) to analyze their functions. hSAC1, but Not hSAC1-C/S, Complements Inositol Auxotrophy of ΔSAC1 Yeast Cells—To assess whether wild type hSAC1 is functionally equivalent to ySac1p in yeast cells and to confirm that the hSAC1-C/S mutant is inactive, we inducibly expressed hSAC1wt, hSAC1-C/S, and ySAC1 in a yeast strain deleted for the SAC1 gene (ΔSAC1; see “Experimental Procedures”). Immunoblotting demonstrated that induction in this strain yielded equal protein levels for both hSAC1 variants (Fig. 2). One important phenotype of the ΔSAC1 yeast strain is inositol auxotrophy (20Whitters E.A. Cleves A.E. McGee T.P. Skinner H.B. Bankaitis V.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 79-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), the inability to grow on inositol-free medium. As shown in Fig. 2, the ΔSAC1 inositol auxotrophy phenotype could be rescued by Cu2+-inducible expression of hSAC1 to an extent comparable with expression of wild type ySac1p. In contrast, the hSAC1-C/S mutant was not able to complement inositol auxotrophy similar to the empty vector control. This result demonstrates (i) functional similarity between the yeast and the human SAC1 proteins and (ii) a successful impairment of hSAC1 enzymatic function through mutation of the core phosphatase motif.

https://openalex.org/W2019509622,"Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are responsible for activating specific amino acids and transferring them onto cognate tRNA molecules. Due to the similarity in many amino acid side chains, certain synthetases misactivate non-cognate amino acids to an extent that would be detrimental to protein synthesis if left uncorrected. To ensure accurate translation of the genetic code, some synthetases therefore utilize editing mechanisms to hydrolyze non-cognate products. Previously class II Escherichia coli proline-tRNA synthetase (ProRS) was shown to exhibit pre- and post-transfer editing activity, hydrolyzing a misactivated alanine-adenylate (Ala-AMP) and a mischarged Ala-tRNAPro variant, respectively. Residues critical for the editing activity (Asp-350 and Lys-279) are found in a novel insertion domain (INS) positioned between motifs 2 and 3 of the class defining aminoacylation active site. In this work, we present further evidence that INS is responsible for editing in ProRS. We deleted the INS from wild-type E. coli ProRS to yield ΔINS-ProRS. While ΔINS-ProRS was still capable of misactivating alanine, the truncated construct was defective in hydrolyzing non-cognate Ala-AMP. When the INS domain was cloned and expressed as an independent protein, it was capable of deacylating a mischarged Ala-microhelixPro variant. Similar to full-length ProRS, post-transfer editing was abolished in a K279A mutant INS. We also show that YbaK, a protein of unknown function from Haemophilus influenzae with high sequence homology to the prokaryotic INS domain, was capable of deacylating Ala-tRNAPro and Ala-microhelixPro variants but not cognate Pro-tRNAPro. Thus, we demonstrate for the first time that an independently folded class II synthetase editing domain and a previously identified homolog can catalyze a hydrolytic editing reaction.

Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are the family of enzymes responsible for activating cognate amino acids with ATP to form aminoacyl-adenylates and subsequently transferring the activated amino acids onto their corresponding tRNAs (1Freist W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6787-6795Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The aminoacylated or charged tRNA is then delivered to the ribosome for use in protein synthesis. Each aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase must select and activate its cognate amino acid from the cellular pool of 20 different proteinaceous amino acids. High fidelity in this selection process is necessary to ensure faithful protein translation as an accumulation of mistakes in the aminoacylation process will eventually lead to cell death (2Orgel L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1963; 49: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 3Laughrea M. Exp. Gerontol. 1982; 17: 305-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 4Freist W. Sternbach H. Pardowitz I. Cramer F. J. Theor. Biol. 1998; 193: 19-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).Some amino acids have chemical structures that closely resemble each other, making accurate discrimination by synthetases difficult. In particular, smaller non-cognate amino acids may enter into the active sites of synthetases and be misactivated and subsequently transferred onto the wrong tRNA. Some synthetases are capable of correcting mistakes in amino acid selection through hydrolysis of the misactivated aminoacyl-adenylate prior to amino acid transfer to the tRNA (pretransfer editing) and hydrolysis of the ester linkage of the misacylated tRNA (post-transfer editing) (5Jakubowski H. Goldman E. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 412-429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Editing has been well documented in the case of class I synthetases. For example, class I isoleucine-tRNA synthetase (IleRS) 1The abbreviations used are: IleRSisoleucine-tRNA synthetaseValRSvaline-tRNA synthetaseLeuRSleucine-tRNA synthetaseCP1connective polypeptide 1ThrRSthreonine-tRNA synthetase, ProRS, proline-tRNA synthetaseAlaRSalanine-tRNA synthetaseINSinsertion domainMBPmaltose-binding proteinHI1434H. influenzae YbaK protein.1The abbreviations used are: IleRSisoleucine-tRNA synthetaseValRSvaline-tRNA synthetaseLeuRSleucine-tRNA synthetaseCP1connective polypeptide 1ThrRSthreonine-tRNA synthetase, ProRS, proline-tRNA synthetaseAlaRSalanine-tRNA synthetaseINSinsertion domainMBPmaltose-binding proteinHI1434H. influenzae YbaK protein. and valine-tRNA synthetase (ValRS) activate and edit the non-cognate amino acids leucine and threonine, respectively (6Baldwin A.N.

More recently, class I leucine-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS) has also been shown to misactivate and edit isoleucine as well as a series of non-standard amino acids (8Englisch S. Englisch U. von der Haar F.

In all of these class I enzymes, a structural domain distinct from the aminoacylation active site known as connective polypeptide 1 (CP1) (12Starzyk R.M. Webster T.A. Schimmel P. Science. 1987; 237: 1614-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) is responsible for the editing activity (9Chen J.-F. Guo N.-N. Li T. Wang E.-D. Wang Y.-L.

Hale S.P. Schimmel P. Nature. 1996; 384: 33-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Biochemical and structural studies have also identified editing activities in class II synthetases, including editing of serine by threonine-tRNA synthetase (ThrRS) (15Dock-Bregeon A.C.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7108-7115Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and editing of glycine and serine by alanine-tRNA synthetase (AlaRS) (19Tsui W.-C. Fersht A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 4627-4637Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 20Beebe K. Ribas de Pouplana L. Schimmel P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 668-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar).Synthetases are modular proteins composed of domains that have distinct functional roles (21Schimmel P. Ribas de Pouplana L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 207-209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 22Alexander R.W. Schimmel P. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 69: 317-349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The core catalytic domain is responsible for amino acid activation and tRNA acceptor stem docking. It has been proposed that ancestral aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases consisted only of the core catalytic domain, while the anticodon-binding domain was recruited later to improve the binding and discrimination of tRNA substrates (21Schimmel P. Ribas de Pouplana L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 207-209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 22Alexander R.W. Schimmel P. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

The catalytic domain alone of some synthetases is capable of aminoacylating tRNA or microhelix substrates that mimic the acceptor stem of full-length tRNA (24Buechter D.D. Schimmel P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6014-6019Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 25Augustine J. Francklyn C.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3473-3482Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), supporting such an evolutionary scenario. In some cases, an editing domain may have been recruited to improve amino acid specificity and eliminate non-cognate product formation (22Alexander R.W. Schimmel P. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 69: 317-349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Schimmel P. Ribas de Pouplana L. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 2001; 66: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). “Extra” domains such as the editing domains of certain class I synthetases have been cloned and expressed as independent functional domains. In particular, the independently expressed CP1 domains from IleRS and ValRS were shown to deacylate Val-tRNAIle and Thr-tRNAVal, respectively (14Lin L. Hale S.P. Schimmel P. Nature. 1996; 384: 33-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Interestingly the CP1 domain of LeuRS has been shown to play a critical role in group I intron splicing (26Rho S.B. Lincecum Jr., T.L. Martinis S.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6874-6881Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).Editing domains found in class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are significantly different from the CP1 domain responsible for editing in class I synthetases. Moreover, in the case of class II enzymes, editing domains identified to date are believed to be distinct from each other, although there is weak homology between the editing domains of ThrRS and AlaRS (15Dock-Bregeon A.C. Sankaranarayanan R. Romby P. Caillet J. Springer M. Rees B. Francklyn C.S. Ehresmann C. Moras D. Cell. 2000; 103: 877-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 20Beebe K. Ribas de Pouplana L. Schimmel P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 668-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Based on sequence alignments, class II ProRSs can be divided into two distinct groups (27Cusack S. Yaremchuk A. Krikliviy I. Tukalo M. Structure. 1998; 6: 101-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 28Stehlin C. Burke B. Yang F. Liu H. Shiba K. Musier-Forsyth K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8605-8613Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 29Ribas de Pouplana L. Brown J.R. Schimmel P. J. Mol. Evol. 2001; 53: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The “prokaryotic-like” group contains synthetases from bacteria and eukaryotic mitochondrial enzymes, whereas the “eukaryotic-like” group contains synthetases from Eukaryotae, Archaea, and Bacteria. In the case of Escherichia coli ProRS, a representative member of the prokaryotic-like grouping, the editing active site is a novel insertion domain (INS) located between motifs 2 and 3, which together constitute the aminoacylation active site (18Wong F.C. Beuning P.J. Nagan M.C. Shiba K. Musier-Forsyth K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7108-7115Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Surprisingly this ∼200-amino acid INS is absent from eukaryotic-like ProRS. This observation suggests either that the INS domain was recruited late in evolution to enhance the performance of the prokaryotic-like enzymes (23Schimmel P. Ribas de Pouplana L. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 2001; 66: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) or that it was present early in both groupings of ProRS and then lost from the eukaryotic-like group, which generally exhibits higher amino acid specificity (30Beuning P.J. Musier-Forsyth K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30779-30785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Whereas the three-dimensional structures of two members of the eukaryotic-like ProRS group have been solved by x-ray crystallography (27Cusack S. Yaremchuk A. Krikliviy I. Tukalo M. Structure. 1998; 6: 101-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 31Yaremchuk A. Cusack S. Tukalo M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4745-4758Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 32Kamtekar S. Kennedy W.D. Wang J. Stathopoulos C. Söll D. Steitz T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1673-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the structure of a bacterial ProRS containing the INS domain is not yet known.Previously we have shown that E. coli ProRS is capable of hydrolyzing non-cognate Ala-AMP in a tRNA-independent pre-transfer editing reaction and of deacylating Ala-tRNAPro via post-transfer editing (17Beuning P.J. Musier-Forsyth K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8916-8960Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Using alanine-scanning mutagenesis, we have also identified residues within the INS domain that are critical for both pre- and post-transfer editing (18Wong F.C. Beuning P.J. Nagan M.C. Shiba K. Musier-Forsyth K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7108-7115Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). More recently, ProRS from the bacterium Aquifex aeolicus was shown to possess post-transfer editing activity, whereas a mutant lacking 117 residues of the insertion domain also lacked detectable deacylation activity (33Ahel I. Stathopoulos C. Ambrogelly A. Sauerwald A. Toogood H. Hartsch T. Söll D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34743-34748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Taken together with the mutagenesis data obtained with the E. coli enzyme, these data provide strong support for the role of the prokaryotic INS domain in amino acid editing by ProRS.By analogy to the class I CP1 domain, we hypothesized that the INS domain alone might be capable of hydrolytic editing activity. To test this hypothesis, we cloned and expressed the E. coli INS domain and tested its post-transfer editing capability. In addition, we deleted the INS from full-length E. coli ProRS to yield ΔINS-ProRS. We also tested the Haemophilus influenzae YbaK protein, previously reported to have high homology to the bacterial ProRS INS domain (34Wolf Y.I. Aravind L. Grishin N.V. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 689-710PubMed Google Scholar, 35Zhang H. Huang K. Li Z. Banerjei L. Fisher K.E. Grishin N.V. Eisenstein E. Herzberg O. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2000; 40: 86-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), for editing activity. The data presented here provide further support for the functional role of the INS domain in translational editing and demonstrate for the first time that an independently folded domain derived from a class II synthetase can catalyze hydrolytic editing.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Construction—A plasmid encoding ΔINS-ProRS was constructed from plasmid pCS-M1S, which encodes wild-type E. coli ProRS with an N-terminal histidine tag (28Stehlin C. Burke B. Yang F. Liu H. Shiba K. Musier-Forsyth K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8605-8613Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This plasmid contains a single KpnI restriction site at the N terminus of the INS domain. A second KpnI restriction site was introduced at the C-terminal end of the INS domain using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and the following primers: 5′-GCGCGCTGCTGGTACCCAGGAAATG-3′ and 5′-CATTTCCTGGGTACCAGCAGCGCGC-3′. After digesting with KpnI to excise the insertion domain, the digested plasmid was then ligated to yield the ΔINS-ProRS with amino acid residues 249–418 of wild-type E. coli ProRS deleted.The plasmid containing the E. coli INS domain was prepared by PCR amplifying the INS fragment from full-length plasmid pCS-M1S using the following primers: 5′-CGCGGATCCATGGGGCTGGATTTCCGCGC-3′ and 5′-CCCAAGCTTGTTACGGCCATCTTCACCC-3′. After digesting with BamHI and HindIII, the PCR fragments were ligated into the corresponding sites of the pMAL-c2E vector (New England Biolabs) immediately following the maltose-binding protein (MBP) coding region. Following ligation, plasmids were transformed into XL-1 Blue supercompetent cells (Stratagene). Results of all cloning and deletion steps were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing (Microchemical Facility, University of Minnesota).RNA Preparation—Wild-type E. coli tRNAPro and a G1:C72/U70-tRNAPro triple mutant were prepared by in vitro transcription from BstNI-linearized plasmids using T7 RNA polymerase as described previously (28Stehlin C. Burke B. Yang F. Liu H. Shiba K. Musier-Forsyth K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8605-8613Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 36Liu H. Yap L.-P. Musier-Forsyth K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 2523-2524Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The G1:C72/U70-microhelixPro variant was synthesized using automated chemical RNA synthesis as described previously (37Yap L.-P. Stehlin C. Musier-Forsyth K. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 661-666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 38Burke B. Yang F. Chen F. Stehlin C. Chan B. Musier-Forsyth K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15540-15547Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Mischarged G1:C72/U70-tRNAPro and G1:C72/U70-microhelixPro for use in post-transfer deacylation assays were prepared as described previously (17Beuning P.J. Musier-Forsyth K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8916-8960Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 18Wong F.C. Beuning P.J. Nagan M.C. Shiba K. Musier-Forsyth K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7108-7115Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). All reactions contained 2 units/ml inorganic pyrophosphatase, and reactions were quenched by the addition of acetic acid to 1% final concentration. Purified charged tRNA and microhelix were quantified by scintillation counting.Protein Preparation—Expression of wild-type and truncated ΔINS-ProRS was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside in SG13009(pREP4) or BL21(DE3) pLysE competent cells. His-tagged proteins were then purified and prepared using a Talon cobalt affinity resin (Clontech) as described previously (39Stehlin C. Heacock D.H. Liu H. Musier-Forsyth K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2932-2938Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The MBP-INS fusion protein was purified using amylose affinity chromatography according to the manufacturer's protocol (New England Biolabs). In brief, sonicated protein solution was loaded onto the amylose affinity column followed by extensive washing with 15 column volumes of column buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA). The MBP-INS fusion protein was then eluted with column buffer containing 10 mm maltose. Fractions containing the fusion protein were identified via SDS-PAGE, pooled, and subjected to cleavage by 0.1% enterokinase (New England Biolabs). The latter was performed at 37 °C for 1 h followed by incubation at 25 °C overnight. Following the removal of maltose from the cleaved fusion protein by hydroxyapatite chromatography (Bio-Rad), the solution was loaded onto a second amylose affinity column. The cleaved INS domain was then eluted using column buffer, and fractions containing the purified protein were pooled and concentrated using Centricon 10 microconcentrators (Amicon). Purified enzyme concentrations were determined either by active site titration (full-length and ΔINS-ProRS) or by Bradford protein assay (INS) (BioRad). Concentrated protein was stored in column buffer with the addition of an equal volume of 80% glycerol.Plasmid pCYB2_HI1434 encoding H. influenzae YbaK protein (HI1434) was a gift from Prof. Osnat Herzberg (University of Maryland). The HI1434 is expressed as a fusion protein consisting of an N-terminal HI1434 polypeptide followed by a self-splicing intein and a chitin-binding domain. Protein purification was performed essentially as described previously (35Zhang H. Huang K. Li Z. Banerjei L. Fisher K.E. Grishin N.V. Eisenstein E. Herzberg O. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2000; 40: 86-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) using the IMPACT™ I system (New England Biolabs). In brief, protein expression was induced in the presence of 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and cell pellets were harvested after 4 h of growth at 37 °C. Cell pellets were then lysed by sonication and clarified by centrifugation. Cell-free lysate was then passed through a chitin column. After washing with column buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Triton), intein-mediated cleavage was initiated by the addition of column buffer containing 50 mm dithiothreitol. Protein was then eluted with column buffer, and fractions containing the YbaK protein were pooled and concentrated using Centriprep 10 and Centricon 10 concentrators (Amicon). Concentrated protein was stored in column buffer containing an equal volume of 80% glycerol.Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectroscopy—CD spectra of proteins were obtained at room temperature using a J-710 spectropolarimeter (Jasco). Protein samples at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0 were analyzed using a 0.1-cm-path length cuvette, and spectra were accumulated over six scans. Subtraction of the INS domain spectrum from the wild-type ProRS spectrum was performed using Excel and Origin programs.Enzyme Assays—Active site titration was performed using the adenylate burst assay as described previously (40Fersht A.R. Ashford J.S. Bruton C.J. Jakes R. Koch G.L. Hartley B.S. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Cognate tRNA aminoacylation assays were performed at room temperature using the published conditions (41Musier-Forsyth K. Scaringe S. Usman N. Schimmel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 42Liu H. Peterson R. Kessler J. Musier-Forsyth K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Mischarging assays were performed using 22.5 μm [3H]alanine, 2 μm enzyme, and 10 μm tRNA as described previously (18Wong F.C. Beuning P.J. Nagan M.C. Shiba K. Musier-Forsyth K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7108-7115Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). ATP-PPi exchange assays were performed at 37 °C using the published conditions (43Heacock D. Forsyth C.J. Shiba K. Musier-Forsyth K. Bioorg. Chem. 1996; 24: 273-289Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The amino acid concentrations used were 0.05–2 mm (proline) and 25–500 mm (alanine), and the final enzyme concentrations were 1 nm (with proline) and 20 nm (with alanine). Kinetic parameters were determined from Lineweaver-Burk plots and represent the average of three determinations. Editing assays were performed at room temperature using the published conditions (17Beuning P.J. Musier-Forsyth K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8916-8960Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In brief, ATPase assays for assessing pretransfer editing were initiated with a 1–5 μm final concentration of enzymes in the presence of 3 mm [γ-32P]ATP, 4 units/ml inorganic pyrophosphatase, 2 mm proline or 500 mm alanine. Reactions were quenched with 25 volumes of 7% HClO4, 10 mm NaPPi, and 3% charcoal, and the charcoal-bound ATP/AMP was separated from the [32P]Pi in solution by centrifugation. A 50-μl aliquot of the supernatant was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Deacylation assays for assessing post-transfer editing were performed using 2.5–21 μm protein, as indicated in the figure legends, and 20,000–100,000 cpm mischarged RNA substrate prepared as described above. Aliquots of the reaction mixture were quenched on 5% trichloroacetic acid-soaked Whatman No. 3MM filter pads and washed extensively to remove free 3H-labeled amino acid prior to quantifying by scintillation counting.RESULTSExpression and Stability of Truncated ProRS Constructs—Fig. 1 shows a schematic illustration of the domain architecture of full-length E. coli ProRS (top). Two additional proteins derived from full-length E. coli ProRS were constructed for this work. ΔINS-ProRS, a variant with a deletion from residues 249 to 418 resulting in removal of 86% of the INS domain, is shown in Fig. 1 (bottom). The end points for this internal deletion were chosen to encompass the majority of the INS domain and also reflected convenient sites for cloning without disrupting sequences within the class II consensus motifs 2 and 3. A protein that contains the entire 183-amino acid INS domain and 65 flanking residues chosen to help stabilize the isolated domain (residues 188–436) was also constructed (Fig. 1, middle). This construct was appended to a cleavable MBP fusion protein.To evaluate the structure and folding of the truncated ΔINS-ProRS and the cloned INS domain in comparison to full-length E. coli ProRS, we used CD spectroscopy. Fig. 2 shows the CD spectra of wild-type ProRS (Fig. 2A, solid curve), ΔINS-ProRS (Fig. 2A, dashed curve), and INS (Fig. 2B, solid curve). The wild-type and ΔINS-ProRS spectra are consistent with a combination of α-helical and β-sheet secondary structural elements with minima near 208 and 220 nm. The INS domain has a single minimum at 205 nm, suggesting a higher content of β-sheet and random coil elements than the full-length protein. Subtraction of the INS domain spectrum from the wild-type ProRS spectrum yields the spectrum shown in Fig. 2A, inset (WT-INS). The close resemblance between the calculated WT-INS spectrum and the experimental spectrum for ΔINS-ProRS (Fig. 2A, dashed curve) provides strong support for the structural integrity of the engineered proteins.Fig. 2CD spectra of wild-type E. coli ProRS and truncated constructs. Protein samples were measured at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0 at room temperature using a 0.1-cm-path length cuvette. Spectra were accumulated over six scans. A shows full-length E. coli ProRS (solid curve) and ΔINS-ProRS (dashed curve). B shows the INS domain (solid curve) and K279A-INS (dashed curve). The inset to A shows a spectrum calculated by subtraction of the INS spectrum from that of the full-length protein (WT-INS). WT, wild type; deg, degrees.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Misactivation of Non-cognate Amino Acids—Misactivation of non-cognate alanine by wild-type E. coli ProRS and ΔINS-ProRS was tested by assaying ATP-PPi exchange. Wild-type ProRS misactivates alanine with a kcat of 3 ± 2 s–1 and Km of 300 ± 30 mm, while ΔINS-ProRS was found to misactivate alanine with a kcat of 0.4 ± 0.2 s–1 and Km of 80 ± 30 mm. Thus, relative to wild-type ProRS, the kcat/Km of the deletion mutant is only reduced by ∼2-fold. These data indicate that the deletion of the INS domain results in only a moderate decrease in the ability of the ΔINS-ProRS to activate alanine. As expected, no activation of alanine was detected with the cloned INS domain, which lacks the aminoacylation active site. We also tested the purified ΔINS-ProRS for misactivation of glycine in the ATP-PPi exchange assay as wild-type E. coli ProRS is known to weakly misactivate non-cognate glycine (30Beuning P.J. Musier-Forsyth K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30779-30785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, no glycine activation was detected.To ensure that the observed alanine misactivation by ΔINS-ProRS was not due to trace contamination of E. coli AlaRS during protein purification, we tested the purified ΔINS-ProRS for its ability to charge an E. coli tRNAAla transcript with alanine. No aminoacylation activity was detected using 0.5 μm ΔINS-ProRS and 0.5 μm tRNAAla. Under the same conditions, aminoacylation activity was readily detected using 0.1 μm purified E. coli AlaRS and 0.5 μm tRNAAla.Activation of Cognate Proline, Cognate tRNA Aminoacylation, and Mischarging—Under standard reaction condit"
https://openalex.org/W2112907690,"Infection with human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) results in adult T-cell leukemia and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis. Tax, a 40-kDa protein, regulates viral and cellular transcription, host signal transduction, the cell cycle, and apoptosis. Tax has been shown to modulate cellular CREB and NFκB pathways; however, to date, its role in binding to various host cellular proteins involved in tumorigenesis has not been fully described. In this study, we describe the Tax-associated proteins and their functions in cells using several approaches. Tax eluted from a sizing column mostly at an apparent molecular mass of 1800 kDa. Following Tax immunoprecipitation, washes with high salt buffer, two-dimensional gel separation, and mass spectrometric analysis, a total of 32 proteins was identified. Many of these proteins belong to the signal transduction and cytoskeleton pathways and transcription/chromatin remodeling. A few of these proteins, including TXBP151, have been shown previously to bind to Tax. The interaction of Tax with small GTPase-cytoskeleton proteins, such as ras GAP1m, Rac1, Cdc42, RhoA, and gelsolin, indicates how Tax may regulate migration, invasion, and adhesion in T-cell cancers. Finally, the physical and functional association of Tax with the chromatin remodeling SWI/SNF complex was assessed using in vitro chromatin remodeling assays, chromatin remodeling factor BRG1 mutant cells, and RNA interference experiments. Collectively, Tax is able to bind and regulate many cellular proteins that regulate transcription and cytoskeletal related pathways, which might explain the pleiotropic effects of Tax leading to T-cell transformation and leukemia in HTLV-1-infected patients.

Tax has been shown to modulate cellular CREB and NFκB pathways; however, to date, its role in binding to various host cellular proteins involved in tumorigenesis has not been fully described. In this study, we describe the Tax-associated proteins and their functions in cells using several approaches. Tax eluted from a sizing column mostly at an apparent molecular mass of 1800 kDa. Following Tax immunoprecipitation, washes with high salt buffer, two-dimensional gel separation, and mass spectrometric analysis, a total of 32 proteins was identified. Many of these proteins belong to the signal transduction and cytoskeleton pathways and transcription/chromatin remodeling. A few of these proteins, including TXBP151, have been shown previously to bind to Tax. The interaction of Tax with small GTPase-cytoskeleton proteins, such as ras GAP1m, Rac1, Cdc42, RhoA, and gelsolin, indicates how Tax may regulate migration, invasion, and adhesion in T-cell cancers. Finally, the physical and functional association of Tax with the chromatin remodeling SWI/SNF complex was assessed using in vitro chromatin remodeling assays, chromatin remodeling factor BRG1 mutant cells, and RNA interference experiments. Collectively, Tax is able to bind and regulate many cellular proteins that regulate transcription and cytoskeletal related pathways, which might explain the pleiotropic effects of Tax leading to T-cell transformation and leukemia in HTLV-1-infected patients.

The Tax protein encoded by HTLV-1 plays a central role in the development of both adult T-cell leukemia and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis. Although Tax itself does not bind to DNA directly or function as an enzyme, its ability to regulate multiple cellular responses is conferred by its protein-protein interactions with various host cellular factors. Importantly, HTLV-1-mediated activation of the host T-cell is induced primarily by the viral protein Tax, which influences transcriptional activation, signal transduction, cell cycle control, and apoptosis. Therefore, understanding how Tax controls these pathways is of significant importance. Tax targets several transcriptional pathways including CREB/activating transcription factor, NFκB, and multiple other factors including cell cycle regulators, such as cyclins D2 and D3, the mitotic checkpoint regulator MAD1, the cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdk) Cdk4 and Cdk6, Cdk inhibitors (p16/INK4A and p21/Waf1), and the tumor suppressor p53 (1.Jeang K.T. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2001; 12: 207-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Moreover, Tax regulation is observed at both nuclear (e.g. CREB-dependent) and cytoplasmic (e.g. NFκB-dependent) levels, functioning through shuttling proteins between these two compartments (2.Burton M. Upadhyaya C.D. Maier B. Hope T.J. Semmes O.J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2351-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 3.Nicot C. Tie F. Giam C.Z. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6777-6784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To activate transcription of the HTLV-1 genome, nuclear Tax interacts with the CREB/activating transcription factor family of transcriptional activators, which bind to the viral long terminal repeat (LTR). The interaction of Tax with CREB and the CREB response elements in the LTR results in a CREB response element-CREB-Tax ternary complex (4.Lenzmeier B.A. Giebler H.A. Nyborg J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 721-731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tax also directly binds to the KIX domain of the transcriptional co-activators CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300 (5.Riou P. Bex F. Gazzolo L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10551-10560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). CBP and p300 covalently modify (acetylate) substrates such as histones and transcription factors and may serve as integrators of numerous cellular signaling processes with the basal RNA polymerase II machinery (3.Nicot C. Tie F. Giam C.Z. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6777-6784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Kwok R.P. Laurance M.E. Lundblad J.R. Goldman P.S. Shih H. Connor L.M. Marriott S.J. Goodman R.H.

This would, in turn, allow controlled regulation and interaction with many cellular transcription factors including CREB, NFκB/Rel, p53, c-Myb, c-Jun, c-Fos, and transcription factor IIB in a signal-dependent and, sometimes, mutually exclusive fashion. Equally important among Tax-binding proteins is the persistent activation of NFκB by Tax, which contributes to the initiation and maintenance of the malignant phenotype. Cytoplasmic Tax interferes with the NFκB pathway via a direct Tax/IKK interaction, which leads sequentially to chronic IKK activation, continuous IκB turnover, and persistent NFκB activity (8.Hiscott J. Kwon H. Genin P. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Genetic complementation analyses with IKKγ-deficient rat fibroblast cells that fail to activate NFκB in the presence of Tax suggested that IKKγ is required for the assembly of the Tax-responsive IKK complex (9.Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israel A. Cell. 1998; 93: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). IKKγ functions as a molecular adapter and provides a site for Tax binding in the assembly of Tax/IKK complexes. IκB kinase activity can be reconstituted in vivo by over-expressing Tax, IKKγ, and either IKKα or IKKβ. However, interaction of Tax with IKKα and IKKβ does not induce kinase activity in the absence of IKKγ expression (10.Jin D.Y. Giordano V. Kibler K.V. Nakano H. Jeang K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17402-17405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). These interactions with Tax require sequences in the C-terminal region of IKKγ whereas the N-terminal region of IKKγ is required for the formation of a stable and active holo-IKK complex (11.Caliendo A.M.

Potential binding sites on the Tax polypeptide have been determined previously (3.Nicot C. Tie F. Giam C.Z. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6777-6784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Xiao G. Harhaj E.W.

Biol. 2000; 20: 3470-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) through mutation analysis of various amino acid residues. For example, both N-terminal and C-terminal domains are responsible for CREB binding (15.Gachon F. Thebault S. Peleraux A. Devaux C. Mesnard J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3470-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 16.Yin M.J. Paulssen E.J. Seeler J.S. Gaynor R.B. J.

Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34060-34067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In addition, amino acids 81 to 95 of Tax are required for p300/CBP interaction (17.Harrod R. Tang Y. Nicot C. Lu H.S. Vassilev A. Nakatani Y. Giam C.Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5052-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The dimerization of Tax, which relies on the leucine repeats, results in a more active protein as compared with its monomeric form (14.Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34060-34067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 18.Jin D.Y. Teramoto H. Giam C.Z. Chun R.F. Gutkind J.S. Jeang K.T. J. Biol.

Retroviruses. 2000; 16: 1689-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) demonstrated that a few of the targets of Tax share coiled-coil structures and that the same domain of Tax is responsible for interaction with different coiled-coil proteins. Here, we have attempted to determine and define Tax-binding proteins using chromatography, 2-D gel electrophoresis, and mass spectrometric analysis. Through these proteomic approaches, we have identified new proteins that bound to Tax, some of which operate with small GTPases, and control many well known cytoskeleton proteins. We also have identified nuclear-containing Tax complexes containing chromatin remodeling factors such as BRG1 and BRG-associated factors (BAFs), which remodel resident nucleosomes. Finally, through the use of a “conserved domain” BLAST search, we demonstrate that Tax contains many overlapping structures and domains, including a LIM binding domain, a coiled-coil region, an ERM domain, and a myosin tail-like domain, which could account for the ability of Tax to act at both the nuclear and cytoplasmic level. Cell culture was performed as described previously (20.de La Fuente C. Santiago F. Chong S.Y. Deng L. Mayhood T. Fu P. Stein D. Denny T. Coffman F. Azimi N. Mahieux R. Kashanchi F. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7270-7283Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). C8166 (C81) is an HTLV-1-infected T-cell line, and CEM (12D7) is an uninfected human T-cell line established from patients with T-cell leukemia. All cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% streptomycin/penicillin, and 1% l-glutamine (Quality Biological) at 37 °C and in 5% CO2. MT-2 and HUT102 cells are HTLV-1-infected T-cells producing viral particles and are positive for Tax expression. JPX-9 is a Tax-inducible (Cd2+) cell line. Whole cell extracts were made at 30 mg/ml, as determined by the Coomassie Blue and BCA (Bio-Rad) protein assay method and were used in chromatography and subsequent immunoaffinity/Western blot analysis. Aliquoted extracts were kept at -80 °C in 10% glycerol for later use. Expression of GST fusion proteins was performed in Escherichia coli transformed with GST-Cdc42, -RhoA, -Rac1, and -Tax plasmids (a generous gifts from Dr. Richard A. Cerione, Dept. of Molecular Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY). Sonicated lysates were treated as described previously and added to a 30% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) (20.de La Fuente C. Santiago F. Chong S.Y. Deng L. Mayhood T. Fu P. Stein D. Denny T. Coffman F. Azimi N. Mahieux R. Kashanchi F. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7270-7283Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Reduced glutathione was added to elute fusion proteins, which were dialyzed against 2 liters of Transcription Buffer D. Tax protein was purified by differential precipitation and zinc chelate chromatography as described previously (21.Kashanchi F. Duvall J.F. Kwok R.P. Lundblad J.R. Goodman R.H. Brady J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34646-34652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Gel filtration was conducted on an AKTA Purifier system (Amersham Biosciences) with a Superose 6 10/30 column. One ml of C81 lysate (protein concentration, 30 mg/ml) was applied to the column each time. Samples were eluted with Buffer D (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.05 m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.05 m DTT, and 20% glycerol; Quality Biological, Inc.) plus 600 mm NaCl at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Eluates were monitored by absorbency at 280 nm. Fractions were collected at 0.5 ml in individual tubes. Standard molecular masses (aldolase, catalase, ferritin, tryroglobulin, and blue dextran 2000, from Amersham Biosciences) were applied to the column and ran under the same conditions as the C81 extracts to calculate the size and range of each fraction. Anti-Tax polyclonal antibody was raised in rabbits as described previously (20.de La Fuente C. Santiago F. Chong S.Y. Deng L. Mayhood T. Fu P. Stein D. Denny T. Coffman F. Azimi N. Mahieux R. Kashanchi F. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7270-7283Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies against BAF53, BAF57, BAF155, and BRG1 were generous gifts from Dr. Weidong Wang (Laboratory of Genetics, NIA, National Institutes of Health, Baltimore, MD). Other antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) including annexin VI, actin, Cdc42, cyclin D2, GAP1m, gelsolin, p21, βpak, PCTAIRE-1, Rad51, and RAG2, from Upstate Biotechnology (CDK2), and from Calbiochem (p53 (Ab-1)). Each antibody was diluted 1:1000 in TNE buffer for Western blot analysis. Immunoprecipitation (IP)—Aliquots of cell extracts or fractions from gel filtration were incubated with various antibodies overnight at 4 °C followed by addition of 30% (v/v) protein A-protein G-agarose beads (Oncogene Research Products, Boston, MA). Bound complexes were washed three times with 150, 300, or 1000 mm NaCl in 100 mm Tris-HCl solution, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. A final wash was performed with 50 mm NaCl/Tris-HCl with 0.1% Nonidet P-40. For washes with 1000 mm salt solution, the protein A/G beads were also treated with 1% bovine serum albumin (in the same solution) for 20 min and washed with buffer without bovine serum albumin. As a control for 2-D gel electrophoresis, a parallel IP experiment was performed at the same time with IgG antibodies. The washed samples were used for electrophoresis on either SDS-PAGE or IEF/SDS-PAGE (2-D). Pull-down Assay—Two micrograms of GST-Rac1, GST-Cdc42, GSTRhoA, GST-Tax, or purified GST proteins were mixed with 1 mg of various lysates (CEM or C81). Aliquots of 30% glutathione-Sepharose beads were then added to the reaction mixture at a total volume of 200–300 μl and rocked overnight at 4 °C. The next day, bound complexes were washed three times with 600 mm NaCl in 100 mm Tris-HCl solution, pH 7.3, containing 1 mm EDTA and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and subsequently washed in 50 mm NaCl/100 mm Tris-HCl. Beads were dissociated in loading buffer prior to SDS-PAGE. For concentrating column fractions and subsequent Western blotting, an equal volume of 20% trichloroacetic acid was added to the protein solutions. After incubation for 30 min at 4 °C, the mixture was centrifuged to obtain pellets, followed by two washes with 0.4 ml of cold acetone (two times). Supernatants were removed, and the pellets were dried by high speed vacuum at 4 °C and used in SDS-PAGE analysis. One-dimensional SDS-PAGE—SDS-PAGE was carried out as described (22.Wang D. de la Fuente C. Deng L. Wang L. Zilberman I. Eadie C. Healey M. Stein D. Denny T. Harrison L.E. Meijer L. Kashanchi F. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7266-7279Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) with a pre-cast gradient gel (4–20%; Invitrogen). After electrophoresis, gels were either stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 or silver staining reagent (Bio-Rad) or were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for Western blot analysis. Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis (IEF/SDS-PAGE)—Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed according to the method of O'Farrell (23.O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as follows: isoelectric focusing was carried out in glass tubes with an inner diameter of 2.0 mm using 2.0%, pH 3.5–10, ampholines (Amersham Biosciences) for 9600 V-h. Fifty ng of an IEF internal standard (tropomyosin with a molecular mass of 33 kDa and pI of 5.2) was added to the sample solution as an internal control. The pH gradient plot for this set of ampholines was determined with a surface pH electrode. After equilibration for 10 min in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 6.8, including 50 mm DTT, 2.3% SDS, 10% glycerol, each tube gel was sealed at the top of a stacking gel, which was put on top of a 10% acrylamide slab gel (0.75 mm thick, 17 × 14 cm). SDS slab gel electrophoresis was carried out for about 4 h at 12.5 mA/gel. Standard molecular mass proteins were added to a well near the basic edge. After electrophoresis, the gel was stained by the silver staining method of O'Connell and Stults (24.O'Connell K.L. Stults J.T. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 349-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and dried between two sheets of cellophane. For Western blots, protein samples were separated on SDS-PAGE and then transferred to an Immobilon-P (polyvinylidene difluoride; Millipore) membrane and blocked with 5% fat-free milk (in TNE50/0.1% Nonidet P-40). Membranes were incubated overnight with various primary antibodies. Reactive complexes were developed with protein G-labeled 125I and visualized with a PhosphorImager scanner (Amersham Biosciences) (20.de La Fuente C. Santiago F. Chong S.Y. Deng L. Mayhood T. Fu P. Stein D. Denny T. Coffman F. Azimi N. Mahieux R. Kashanchi F. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7270-7283Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Individual protein spots were excised from the silver-stained gel and destained with a solution of 30 mm potassium ferricyanide/100 mm sodium thiosulfate (1:1) (v/v). Trypsin-digested sample solutions were further desalted and concentrated with C18 ZipTips (Millipore). Samples were mixed with the same volume of the matrix solution (α-cyano-4-hydroxycynnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile/0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid). Two μl of the mixtures were applied to the sample plate and introduced into the mass spectrometer after drying. Mass spectra were recorded in the reflectron mode of a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Voyager-Elite; PerSeptive Biosystems) by summing 200–300 laser shots with an acceleration voltage of 20 kV, 70% grid voltage, 0.05 guide wire voltage, 100-ns delay, and low mass gate at 700 m/z. Proteins were identified using the peptide mass fingerprinting analysis software ProFound (129.85.19.192/prowl-cgi/ProFound.exe). The NCBInr data base was used for the searches with several passes of searching with different limitations for each spot. In general, all spots were searched with methionine oxidation and no-limitation for pI. The best match for each spot was considered with higher coverage rate, more matched peptides, and higher score without limitation on the taxonomic category and protein mass. Zero missed cleavage by trypsin and lowest mass tolerance, i.e. ±50 ppm, were considered for most of the proteins. A few spots were searched with the following parameters to find the best match: two missed cut cleavages, limited to the “mammal” category, and/or a set ±50% of total molecular mass (see website for more details). We consistently used various multiple parameters such as low miss cut, low ppm, first methionine oxidation, and others in our searches to obtain more reliably matched proteins. Identification of the proteins was confirmed by Western blot analysis. Unless stated specifically, all data bases and tools used for bioinformatics analysis were from the following public websites: PubMed, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed/; ExPASy, us.expasy.org/; BLAST, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/; Pfam, pfam.wustl.edu/; PBIL, pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/pbil.html; COILS, www.ch.embnet.org/software/COILS_form.html; and PIR, www-nbrf.georgetown.edu/pirwww/. Plasmid pG5E4T DNA (five Gal4 binding sites upstream of the adenovirus 2 E4 minimal promoter) was linearized with Asp-718. The fragments were biotinylated, gel purified, and reconstituted with core histones by step dilution. Briefly, core histones were purified from HeLa cells and mixed with DNA. The biotinylated mononucleosome were prepared by mixing the biotinylated pG5E4T DNA and purified core histones by sequential dilution from 1 to 0.1 m NaCl. Ten to twenty micrograms of pG5E4T PCR products were mixed with 5 μl of 5 m NaCl and 2 μl of 10× reconstitution buffer (0.15 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 2 mm EDTA) by pipetting up and down repeatedly. Next 30– 40 μg of core histones were added in a total volume of 50 μl, adjusting the volume by adding distilled deionized water. Samples were then gently flicked in the tube and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. Sequential dilution was carried out by adding 10 μl of 1× reconstitution buffer every 10 min, for 3 h at 37 °C. At each time point, samples were mixed by gently pipetting up and down. An aliquot was run on an agarose gel to ensure proper nucleosome assembly prior to each experiment. The biotinylated nucleosomal arrays were then incubated at 30 °C for 1 h with paramagnetic beads coupled to streptavidin in a binding buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm DTT, 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5% glycerol, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 2 mm MgCl2, supplemented with 300 mm KCl. Following the standard ChIP protocol (25.Kuo M.H. Allis C.D. Methods. 1999; 19: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar) modified for in vitro conditions (26.Vignali M. Steger D.J. Neely K.E. Workman J.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2629-2640Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), 100 nm Gal4-VP16, 200 nm Gal4, 200 nm Gal4-Tax (M47), or Gal4-Tax (WT) were added to ∼500 ng of biotinylated nucleosomal array in 20 μl of binding buffer (4.2 nm) and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Twenty-five nm SWI/SNF and 10-fold excess of competitor chromatin was then added. After 30 min of incubation at 30 °C, formaldehyde was added to 1% of the final reaction volume and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The templates were then released from biotin and the Dynabeads by digestion with restriction enzyme at 37 °C for 4 h. Samples were digested with 10 milliunits of MNase in 3 mm CaCl2 for 5 min at room temperature. The samples were then immunoprecipitated using affinity matrix HA antibody to pull-down SWI/SNF and the cross-linked DNA. The beads were washed, and cross-linking was reversed by adding 5 m NaCl. DNA was extracted by proteinase K digestion, phenol-chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitation. The denatured samples were applied to Zeta-probe membranes by slot blot and hybridized to successive probes of 250–300 bp generated by PCR and labeled by random hexanucleotide primer extension (Roche Applied Science). To ensure the presence of chromatin structure in our reconstitution assays, we used micrococcal nuclease digestion of plasmid pG5E4T DNA. Chromatin was analyzed by digesting 2000 ng (20 μl) at each time point with 5 units of micrococcal nuclease per microliter and 0.3 mm CaCl2 for 0, 0.5, 1, and 5 min at room temperature. Reactions were stopped with 8 μl of 2.5% Sarkosyl-0.1 m EDTA. Proteins were then digested overnight at 37 °C with 10 μl of 10 mg/ml proteinase K and 0.2% SDS. Following an ethanol precipitation, DNA was analyzed on a 1.2% agarose gel. Oligos were designed and synthesized using the OligoEngine website at www.oligoengine.com and the accession number for BRG1. Five oligos (see below), which span the 5′ end, middle, and 3′ end of the BRG1 mRNA, were chosen. The most optimal sequences had a GC content between 30 and 70%. HTLV-1-infected cell lines, C91/PL and MT-2, were treated with TNF-α for 2 h. A mixture of the five oligos was electroporated (27.Kashanchi F. Duvall J.F. Brady J.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4673-4674Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) into the cells, and HTLV-1 replication was monitored by p19/gag enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The sequences of oligos used for BRG1 siRNA (wild type) were as follows: U29175–1716, GGACAAGCGCCUGGCCUAC; U29175–2142, GAAGAUUCCAGAUCCAGAC; U29175–3210, GAUCUGCAACCACCCCUAC; U29175–4236, GCAGUGGCUCAAGGCCAUC; U29175–4776, GGAGGAUGACAGUGAAGGC. The sequences used for BRG1 siRNA (mutant) were as follows: U29175–1716, GGACAAAAAAAUGGCCUAC; U29175–2142, GAAGAUUCCAAAAAAAGAC; U29175–3210, GAUCUGCAACCAAAAAUAC; U29175–4236, GCAGUGGCUCAAAAAAAUC; U29175–4776, GGAGGAUGAAAAAAAAGGC. Generally, there are two strategies for high throughput proteome analysis of protein samples prepared from cells or tissues. Two-dimension gel electrophoresis (IEF/SDS-PAGE, 2-D) displays and quantifies proteins from 10 to 100 kDa. The identification of spots on 2-D gels is usually performed by in-gel trypsin digestion combined with MALDI-TOF and/or electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (MS). Another approach fragments protein samples with trypsin, followed by separation of peptides using liquid chromatography, which directly interfaces with the mass spectrometer. In the present study, we first focused on determining the components of Tax associated complexes in HTLV-1-infected cells using fractionation on a sizing column, followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-Tax polyclonal antibody, 2-D gel electrophoresis, and identification of associated polypeptides by MALDI-TOF analysis (Fig. 1A). Extracts from HTLV-1-infected lymphocyte cell lines were separated using a size-exclusion column. The extracts were equilibrated to high salt (600 mM) concentrations of eluate to wash out nonspecific Tax-binding proteins. Standard protein markers (inset in Fig. 1B) with apparent molecular masses ranging from 158 to 2,000 stokes radius values were initially used to calibrate the size of protein peaks. Various apparent protein peaks were observed including dextran blue 2000 (peak 1, MM 2000), tryroglobulin (peak 2, MM 670), ferritin (peak 3, MM 440), catalase (peak 4, MM 232), and aldolase (peak 5, MM 158). When applying the infected cell lysates to the column, there were at least seven peaks with apparent molecular masses ranging from 30 kDa to more than 4,000 kDa. Consistent with a previously published report (28.Li X.H. Murphy K.M. Palka K.T. Surabhi R.M. Gaynor R.B. J. Biol.

However, the Tax eluted at three sizes with the majority found in peak 5 (apparent molecular mass of 1800 kDa). The results of fractionations at high salt (600 mM, A) and low salt (150 mM, B) are shown in Fig. 1B. Either condition essentially showed similar peak profiles. We focused on one particular fraction, the 1800-kDa fraction, because it was reproducibly observed in four different HTLV-1- and Tax-expressing cells (C8166, MT-2, HUT 102, a"

Here we show that the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal regions of Mi-2β have distinct transcriptional activities and bind to BRG1, a component of the SWI/SNF complex, and the RET finger protein (RFP), respectively. Analysis by luciferase reporter assay revealed that the amino-terminal region of Mi-2β has a strong transactivating ability, whereas its carboxyl-terminal region has transcriptional repressive activity. Co-localization and association of Mi-2, RFP, and histone deacetylase 1 suggested that these proteins cooperate in transcriptional repression. Furthermore, the functional importance of the association of Mi-2β and RFP was confirmed by using Rfp–/– fibroblasts. On the other hand, we demonstrated that Mi-2 and BRG1 were associated with each other and that the bromodomain region of BRG1 strongly suppressed transactivation by the amino-terminal region of Mi-2β. The findings that Mi-2β interacts with both transactivating and repressing proteins and directly associates with another chromatin remodeling protein, BRG1, provide new insight into the formation of multiprotein supercomplex involved in transcriptional regulation.

Epigenetic control of gene expression contributes to the genome-wide mechanism of information storage and retrieval by changing chromatin structure (1Riddihough G. Pennisi E. Science. 2001; 293: 1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Emerging evidence suggests that dynamic changes in chromatin structure, including heterochromatin and euchromatin formation, modification of histone tails, ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling activity, and binding of Polycomb and trithorax group proteins, play an important role in transcriptional regulation by changing the access to the underlying DNA (2Struhl K.

Mi-2 is involved in transcriptional repression, in cooperation with its associating proteins such as methyl CpG-binding protein MBD2/3, histone deacetylases HDAC1/2, MTA1/2/3, and RbAp46/48 (7Wade P.A.

Nature. 1998; 395: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). The NuRD complex associates with distinct types of transcriptional repressors. In particular, the carboxyl-terminal region of Mi-2 was identified as a binding site for several transcriptional repressors including hunchback, Trk69 (tram-track69), and KAP-1 co-repressor (11Schultz D.C. Friedman J.R. Rauscher III, F.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 428-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 12Murawsky C.M. Brehm A. Badenhorst P. Lowe N. Becker P.B. Travers A.A.

In addition, recent work has shown that Mi-2 is a component of the cohesin complex that functions in sister chromatin segregation (14Hakimi M.A. Bochar D.A. Schmiesing J.A. Dong Y. Barak O.G.

The RET finger protein (RFP) was originally identified as a protein that became oncogenic after fusing with the RET receptor tyrosine kinase (15Takahashi M. Inaguma Y. Hiai H. Hirose F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1853-1856Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). RFP belongs to the RBCC-B30.2 protein family that contains a RING finger, a B-box zinc finger, a coiled-coil domain, and a specific carboxyl-terminal region known as the RFP domain or the B30.2-like domain (16Henry J. Mather I.H. McDermott M.F. Pontarotti P. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1998; 15: 1696-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We reported previously (15Takahashi M. Inaguma Y. Hiai H. Hirose F. Mol.

Int. 1999; 49: 88-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) that RFP mRNA was highly expressed in a variety of human and rodent tumor cell lines, as well as in male germ cells, and that its protein expression was detected in the nuclei of male germ cells, peripheral and central neurons, hepatocytes, and adrenal chromaffin cells. Moreover, our recent study provided evidence that RFP binds and colocalizes with EPC1 (Enhancer of Polycomb 1) in the nucleus and is involved in transcriptional repression (18Shimono Y. Murakami H. Hasegawa Y. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39411-39419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 19Tezel G. Shimono Y. Murakumo Y. Kawai K. Fukuda T. Iwahashi N. Takahashi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 409-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The repressive activity of RFP resided mainly in its coiled-coil domain, which represents the binding site for EPC1. BRG1 is a central subunit of the SWI/SNF complex that participates in transcriptional activation (20Khavari P.A. Peterson C.L. Tamkun J.W. Mendel D.B. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1993; 366: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 21Kadam S. McAlpine G.S. Phelan M.L. Kingston R.E. Jones K.A. Emerson B.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2441-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The SWI/SNF complex is recruited to promoters of specific genes, where it remodels nucleosomes to facilitate the binding of transcriptional activators. Interestingly, recent results show that the SWI/SNF complex also has transcriptional repressing activity in Drosophila and yeast (22Martens J.A. Winston F. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2231-2236Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 23Muchardt C. Yaniv M.

Sanchez C. Ichinose H. Cervino M. Lerouge T. Chambon P. Losson R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5797-5806Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In addition, BRG1 modulates the transcriptional activity of retinoblastoma, β-catenin, the estrogen receptor, and BRCA1 and is mutated or deleted in a variety of human tumor cell lines (23Muchardt C.

Whereas Mi-2 and BRG1 are the main subunits of the well known protein complexes NuRD and SWI/SNF, co-existence of SWI/SNF and NuRD components has been reported in several multiprotein complexes. An Ikaros-containing chromatin remodeling complex that is involved in γ-to β-globin switching in hematopoietic cells includes Mi-2, BRG1, HDAC, RbAp46/48, and BAF57 in a single complex (29O'Neill D.W. Schoetz S.S. Lopez R.A. Castle M. Rabinowitz L. Shor E. Krawchuk D. Goll M.G. Renz M. Seelig H.P. Han S. Seong R.H. Park S.D. Agalioti T. Munshi N. Thanos D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Bank A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 7572-7582Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). ALL-1, a trithorax/Polycomb group protein that is involved in acute leukemia, was reported recently (30Nakamura T. Mori T. Tada S. Krajewski W. Rozovskaia T. Wassell R. Dubois G. Mazo A. Croce C.M. Canaani E. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1119-1128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar) to form the multiprotein supercomplex that includes both Mi-2 and Brahma that is highly homologous to BRG1. Here we provide evidence that Mi-2β has both transcriptional repressing and activating domains. RFP directly binds the carboxyl-terminal region of Mi-2β, and the transcriptional repressing activity of RFP is enhanced by Mi-2β in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, the transcriptional repressing activity of Mi-2β was markedly weakened in Rfp–/– fibroblasts. On the other hand, the amino-terminal region of Mi-2β has a strong transcriptional activating ability and contains a binding site for BRG1. These data indicate that Mi-2 can cooperate with both transactivating and repressing proteins at distinct regions. These findings suggest that the direct association of chromatin remodeling proteins such as Mi-2 and BRG1 could mediate formation of multiprotein supercomplexes involved in epigenetic transcription. Plasmids—Fragments of RFP cDNA containing the RING finger B box region, the coiled-coil region, or the RFP domain region were cloned into the pAS2–1 vector as described previously (18Shimono Y. Murakami H. Hasegawa Y. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39411-39419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Mi-2β cDNA cloned into the pBS or pcDNA3 HA vector was a kind gift from F. Hirose (Aichi Cancer Center, Nagoya, Japan). Each region of Mi-2β was amplified by PCR using 5′ primers with an EcoRI or BamHI site and 3′ primers with a NotI site. The resulting PCR products were subcloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega) and sequenced. Each product was inserted into the EcoRI/NotI or BamHI/NotI site of the pcDNA3.1V5 HisC GAL4 DBD vector (18Shimono Y. Murakami H. Hasegawa Y. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39411-39419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and then subcloned into the EcoRI/XhoI or BamHI/XhoI site of the pACT2 vector. Mi-2β cDNA was also cloned into the EcoRV/SalI site of the pFLAG CMV2 vector. The carboxyl-terminal region of the BRG1 cDNA was obtained by PCR using the human testis cDNA library as a template and was sequenced. BRG1 cDNA fragments were amplified by PCR using 5′ primers with an EcoRI site and 3′ primers with an XhoI site and were cloned into the pGEM-T vector. The resulting cDNA fragments were subcloned into the EcoRI/XhoI site of the pACT2 vector. To generate pFLAG CMV2 BRG1 expression plasmids, each BRG1 cDNA fragment was subcloned into the EcoRI/SalI site of the pFLAG CMV2 vector. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening and Interaction Assays—Full-length RFP cDNA or the amino-terminal region of Mi-2β cDNA was cloned into the pAS2–1 vector (Clontech) and used as a bait to identify interacting proteins by a yeast two-hybrid assay. The pAS2–1 RFP or Mi-2β plasmid was co-transfected with a human testis cDNA library (Clontech) into the Y190 strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The transformants were plated on selective medium lacking histidine, tryptophan, and leucine with 40 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT). From ∼1.4 × 105 independent clones, positive colonies were found by their growth on minimal medium lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine and by β-galactosidase expression. β-Galactosidase activity was measured by the filter assay method according to the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech). After DNA isolation, these clones were further characterized by sequencing and analyzed for gene homology using the BLAST data base. To characterize the interaction between RFP and Mi-2β in the yeast two-hybrid system, each RFP and Mi-2β domain amplified by PCR was cloned into pAS2–1 and pACT2, respectively, and transformed into Y190. Positive interactions were also determined by two criteria of the growth in the presence of 40 mm 3-AT, as well as by expression of β-galactosidase. Measurements were performed using at least four independent colonies. GAL4-fused Reporter Gene Targeted Transcription Assay—The generation of pGL3 luciferase reporter plasmids has been described previously (18Shimono Y. Murakami H. Hasegawa Y. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39411-39419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were cultured in 24-well tissue culture plates and co-transfected with 40 ng of luciferase reporter plasmid, 40 ng of pRL-TK plasmid (Promega), and 320 ng of pCMV-GAL4 RFP or Mi-2β fusion constructs by the LipofectAMINE PLUS method (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To assess the effect of co-expressing FLAG expression constructs, 20 ng of luciferase reporter plasmid, 20 ng of the pRL-TK plasmid (Promega), and 60 ng of the pCMV-GAL4 DBD fusion constructs, together with 400 ng of the pCMV FLAG construct, were transfected by the Lipo-fectAMINE PLUS method. The cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and luciferase assays were performed as described previously (18Shimono Y. Murakami H. Hasegawa Y. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39411-39419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Co-transfection with the pRL-TK plasmid was used to normalize all luciferase values. Values were expressed as means and standard deviations of the results from three independent experiments. Antibodies—The anti-RFP and anti-Mi-2 polyclonal antibodies were described previously (7Wade P.A. Gegonne A. Jones P.L. Ballestar E. Aubry F. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 18Shimono Y. Murakami H. Hasegawa Y. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39411-39419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M2) was obtained from Sigma. The anti-BRG1 and anti-HDAC1 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Co-immunoprecipitation Studies—293 cells were plated in 60-mm dishes and were transfected with 2 μg of pFLAG-CMV2 expression vector using the LipofectAMINE PLUS method. After 48 h of incubation, cells were washed twice with ice-cold washing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) and suspended in 1 ml of hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). The suspension was sonicated very briefly and mixed with 160 μl of 2.5 m sucrose solution. After centrifugation at 12000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, the pellet was lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing Complete protease inhibitor mixture and centrifuged again at 12,000 × g for 25 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants were incubated with specific polyclonal antibody or with 2 μg of mouse anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) coupled with protein A-Sepharose or protein G-Sepharose (Sigma) for 5 h at 4 °C. After washing five times in lysis buffer, the samples were suspended in SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. They were then separated by SDS-8% PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride filters (Millipore). After blocking with 5% skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20, the filters were incubated with specific antibodies. Peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were added, and films were developed using the ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—Immunofluorescence studies were performed as described previously (18Shimono Y. Murakami H. Hasegawa Y. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39411-39419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To perform double labeling of RFP and Mi-2β, the anti-RFP polyclonal antibody was conjugated with Alexa 546 using the Alexa 546 antibody labeling kit (Molecular Probes). The cells were incubated with the anti-Mi-2 polyclonal antibody, followed by incubation with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody and then stained with an Alexa 546-labeled anti-RFP antibody. Identification of Interacting Domains between RFP and Mi-2β—We have shown previously (18Shimono Y. Murakami H. Hasegawa Y. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39411-39419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) that RFP is involved in epigenetic gene silencing, cooperating, and co-localizing with EPC1. To further identify RFP-binding proteins, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening using full-length RFP cDNA as bait. Carboxyl-terminal fragments of Mi-2β cDNA were isolated from a human testis Matchmaker two-hybrid library (Clontech). Mi-2 is the main component of the NuRD complex, which is known to be involved in gene silencing. Mi-2 has two isoforms, Mi-2α and Mi-2β, that possesses plant homeodomain zinc finger motifs, a chromodomain, and an ATPase/helicase region (Fig. 1A). The isoforms show a 69% amino acid identity. To clarify the interacting domains between RFP and Mi-2β, different fragments of RFP and Mi-2β cDNAs were cloned in-frame into pAS2–1 and pACT2 vectors, respectively. Because library screening showed that the full-length RFP interacts with the carboxyl-terminal region of Mi-2β, we chose the carboxyl-terminal half of Mi-2β for further analysis. pAS2–1 RFP and pACT2 Mi-2β constructs were transformed into the yeast Y190 strain, and interactions were assayed both by growth on selective medium lacking histidine, tryptophan, and leucine with 40 mm 3-AT and by β-galactosidase activity. As shown in Fig. 1B, a strong interaction was detected between the RFP coiled-coil domain and the Mi-2β carboxyl-terminal fragments (fragments D and H). On the other hand, the constructs without the carboxyl-terminal region (A, B, C, and E in Fig. 1A) had very weak or no binding activity, confirming that the D region is important and specific for RFP binding. The carboxyl-terminal region of Mi-2 has been reported to be the binding site for several repressors such as hunchback, Trk69, and KAP-1 (11Schultz D.C. Friedman J.R. Rauscher III, F.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 428-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 12Murawsky C.M. Brehm A. Badenhorst P. Lowe N. Becker P.B. Travers A.A. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 1089-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 13Kehle J. Beuchle D. Treuheit S. Christen B. Kennison J.A. Bienz M. Muller J. Science. 1998; 282: 1897-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), and our results support the idea that this region provides common binding sites for different types of repressors, including RFP. Association and Co-localization of RFP, Mi-2, and HDAC1—To verify the interaction between RFP and Mi-2, immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using human embryo kidney 293 cells, in which the expression of both proteins was detected by Western blotting (18Shimono Y. Murakami H. Hasegawa Y. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39411-39419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We also examined the association of RFP with HDAC1 that is known to be a component of the NuRD complex. When the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-RFP antibody, both Mi-2 and HDAC1 were detected in the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2), suggesting the association of these three proteins. These interactions were not observed when normal rabbit immunoglobulins were used for immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2). We were not able to perform the reciprocal experiment, because the band of RFP that should be detected by the secondary anti-rabbit IgG antibody was superimposed on the band for the anti-Mi-2 antibody that was used for the immunoprecipitation. We next analyzed the subcellular localization of RFP, Mi-2, and HDAC1 by immunofluorescence. To determine the endogenous localization of these proteins, SW480 human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells, in which the expression of these proteins was detected by Western blotting (data not shown), were stained with an anti-Mi-2 polyclonal antibody, an Alexa 546-conjugated anti-RFP polyclonal antibody, and an anti-HDAC1 monoclonal antibody. The localization patterns of these three proteins were characterized by diffuse distribution throughout the nucleoplasm, dot-like structures of various sizes, and brightly labeled domain formation (Fig. 3, A–C). Superimposition of confocal images revealed that RFP, Mi-2, and HDAC largely co-localized in these nuclear structures. Analysis of Transcriptional Activity of Mi-2β—Because the carboxyl-terminal region of Mi-2 is the binding site for various transcriptional repressors including RFP, a panel of Mi-2β fragments fused to a GAL4 DBD was generated to evaluate the transcriptional activity of this region in comparison with other regions of Mi-2β (Fig. 4A). Four different luciferase reporter constructs were used, each containing five tandem repeats of the GAL4 binding sequence, binding sites for transcriptional enhancers (serum response element (SRE) or cyclic AMP response element (CRE)), and a SV40 promoter or herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase minimal promoter (Fig. 4A). The transcriptional activities were assessed by transient transfection of each GAL4 DBD-Mi-2β construct, together with four different luciferase reporter plasmids, into 293 cells. In the experiments using the CRE reporter construct, the cells were treated with 100 μm forskolin for 2 h. As we have shown previously (18Shimono Y. Murakami H. Hasegawa Y. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39411-39419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), RFP reduced the luciferase activity by ∼65–75% as compared with the control (GAL4 DBD only) (Fig. 4B). Full-length Mi-2β also reduced the activity by 55–70%. We found that the carboxyl-terminal fragment (fragment J; 1321–1912 amino acids) that includes the RFP binding region has a transcriptional repressive ability similar to that of RFP, independent of the differences of the reporter plasmids used (Fig. 4B). The chromodomain region (fragment E) also showed repressive activity (activity reduced by 40–70%), whereas other regions (fragments D, F, and G), including the plant homeodomain zinc finger region and the ATPase/helicase region, had weak or no repressive activity. To further characterize the repressive activity of the carboxyl-terminal region, we made additional deletion constructs of this region. As shown in Fig. 4C, the region between 1671 and 1912 amino acids (fragment N) was necessary for maximal repressive activity. Cooperation of RFP and Mi-2β in Transcriptional Repression—We have succeeded recently in generating Rfp knockout mice. 2K. Kawai, Y. Shimono, and M. Takahashi, unpublished data. To investigate the cooperation of RFP and Mi-2β in transcriptional repression, a luciferase reporter assay was performed using a fibroblast cell line derived from a Rfp knockout mouse. As shown in Fig. 5A, the transcriptional repressive activity of the full-length Mi-2β was almost abolished in Rfp–/– fibroblasts. Its carboxyl-terminal region (fragment J; 132–1912 amino acids), which has a repressing activity in 293 cells (Fig. 4B), instead showed transcriptional activating ability in Rfp–/– fibroblasts. In contrast, the activity of fragment F of Mi-2β was not affected in Rfp–/– fibroblasts (Fig. 5A). It is noteworthy that co-expression of RFP markedly restored the repressive activities of both full-length Mi-2β and its carboxyl-terminal fragment J in Rfp–/– fibroblasts (Fig. 5A). In addition, co-expression of full-length Mi-2β enhanced the transcriptional repressive activity of RFP in 293 cells (Fig. 5B). These results strongly argue that RFP plays a role in Mi-2β-mediated transcriptional repression. Strong Transactivating Ability of the Amino Terminal Region of Mi-2β and Its Association with BRG1—In contrast to the repressive activity of the carboxyl-terminal region of Mi-2β, we found that the amino-terminal region (1–376 amino acids; see fragment A in Fig. 4A) of Mi-2β has a strong transcriptional activating ability, resulting in a 10–20-fold increase of luciferase activity (Fig. 6A). When shorter fragments (fragments B and C in Fig. 4A) were used for the assay, the transactivating ability markedly decreased (Fig. 6A), indicating that the whole region of fragment A is necessary for transactivation. To elucidate whether binding of other proteins regulates the transactivating ability of the amino-terminal region of Mi-2β, yeast two-hybrid screening was carried out, using the amino-terminal region of Mi-2β as bait. From ∼1.4 × 105 independent colonies grown from a human testis cDNA library, six colonies were identified as positive clones. By sequencing analysis, two clones were identified that contained the carboxyl-terminal fragments of BRG1 (clones 3 and 5 in Fig. 6B). BRG1 is known to be another chromatin remodeling protein and is a component of the SWI/SNF complex that facilitates transactivation (20Khavari P.A. Peterson C.L. Tamkun J.W. Mendel D.B. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1993; 366: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 21Kadam S. McAlpine G.S. Phelan M.L. Kingston R.E. Jones K.A. Emerson B.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2441-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The association between the carboxyl-terminal region of BRG1 and the amino-terminal region of Mi-2β (1–376 amino acids) was investigated by a yeast two-hybrid assay. As a consequence, a positive association was detected between the bromodomain of BRG1 (fragment B in Fig. 6B) and Mi-2β, whereas three other fragments examined (A, C, and D) showed no binding activity (Fig. 6C). These findings suggested that the unique transcriptional activating ability of the amino-terminal region of Mi-2β may be regulated by direct association with the bromodomain region of BRG1. To investigate the association of BRG1 with Mi-2β in vivo, we performed the immunoprecipitation experiments using human embryonic kidney 293 cells. First, the FLAG expression vectors containing three different regions of Mi-2β were transfected into the cells, and the resulting lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody, followed by immunoblotting with an anti-BRG1 antibody. As shown in Fig. 7A, BRG1 was specifically co-immunoprecipitated with the amino-terminal region of Mi-2β, but no association was detected with two other regions of Mi-2β. To further assess the interaction of endogenous Mi-2 and BRG1 in vivo, the reciprocal immunoprecipitation experiments were performed. As shown in Fig. 7B, BRG1 was co-immunoprecipitated with Mi-2 using an anti-Mi-2 polyclonal antibody, and Mi-2 was co-immunoprecipitated with BRG1 using an anti-BRG1 polyclonal antibody. These findings suggest that part of the endogenous BRG1 and Mi-2 proteins are associate with each other in vivo, although it is possible that this association is mediated by a common factor present in the BRG1 and Mi-2 complexes. Involvement of BRG1 in the Transactivating Ability of Mi-2β—Finally, we assessed the effect of BRG1 on the transactivating ability of the amino-terminal region of Mi-2β. FLAG-tagged expression constructs were made that contained three different fragments of the BRG1 carboxyl-terminal region. These were transfected with the plasmid containing the GAL4 DBD-fused Mi-2β amino-terminal transactivating region into 293 cells to carry out the luciferase reporter assay. Intriguingly, the transactivating ability of the amino-terminal region of Mi-2β was markedly impaired when it was co-expressed with the bromodomain region of BRG1 (Fig. 7C). In contrast, two other regions of BRG1 showed weak effects on its transactivating ability, implying that binding of BRG1 bromodomain may interfere with the binding of endogenous BRG1, and thus have a dominantly negative effect on the transactivating ability of the Mi-2β amino-terminal region. Mi-2 has chromatin remodeling activity and forms a protein complex involved in epigenetic transcriptional repression. Recent reports (31van der Vlag J. Otte A.P. Nat.

Science. 2002; 298: 1039-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (2849) Google Scholar) suggest the cooperation of Mi-2, Polycomb proteins, HDAC activity, and methyltransferase activity in transcriptional repression. In fact, it was shown that human Polycomb group protein EED interacts with HDAC (31van der Vlag J. Otte A.P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 474-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) and that Drosophila dMi-2 functions in Polycomb group gene silencing (13Kehle J. Beuchle D. Treuheit S. Christen B. Kennison J.A. Bienz M. Muller J. Science. 1998; 282: 1897-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). In addition, KAP-1, a member of the RBCC protein family, associates with Mi-2α (11Schultz D.C. Friedman J.R. Rauscher III, F.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 428-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). RFP belongs to the RBCC-B30.2 protein family. These proteins contain a RING finger, a B-box zinc finger, a coiled-coil domain, and a specific carboxyl-terminal region that was named the RFP domain or the B30.2-like domain (15Takahashi M. Inaguma Y. Hiai H. Hirose F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1853-1856Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). To date, over 200 members of the RING finger protein family have been identified. These proteins are known to play diverse roles in oncogenesis, apoptosis, development, and ubiquitination (36Joazeiro C.A. Weissman A.M. Cell. 2000; 102: 549-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar, 37Yang Y.L. Li X.M. Cell Res. 2000; 10: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 38Borden K.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 1103-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Both the RING finger itself and the RBCC motifs are suspected to be involved in protein-protein interactions responsible for various biological events (38Borden K.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 1103-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). In our previous report (18Shimono Y. Murakami H. Hasegawa Y. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39411-39419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), we showed that RFP is a transcriptional repressor and that its coiled-coil domain directly associates with a Polycomb group protein, EPC1, suggesting that RFP may function physiologically in a protein complex formed by Polycomb group proteins. In the current study, we show that Mi-2β was also identified as a protein that interacts with RFP and enhances RFP-mediated transcriptional repression. The association of RFP and Mi-2β was further confirmed using Rfp–/– fibroblasts. These findings suggest that Mi-2 is involved in gene silencing that is mediated by a variety of RBCC proteins, as well as by Polycomb group proteins. Mi-2 is an ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling protein. Nucleosome remodeling domains have been identified in both transcriptional activating and repressing proteins, such as SWI/SNF-related proteins and Mi-2. Our present results indicate that the ATPase/helicase region of Mi-2 has little transcriptional activity, as indicated by the assay using all four luciferase constructs. Although nucleosome remodeling is probably a general property of epigenetic transcriptional control, we speculate that specific associations with these proteins may determine the consequence of the remodeling (39Wade P.A. Wolffe A.P. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R221-R224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Mi-2 forms a protein complex with HDAC and methyl CpG-binding protein in the transcriptional repressing NuRD protein complex (7Wade P.A. Gegonne A. Jones P.L. Ballestar E. Aubry F. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 8Wade P.A. Jones P.L. Vermaak D. Wolffe A.P. Curr.

Nature. 1998; 395: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Mi-2 also binds several types of transcriptional repressors, including hunchback, Trk69, and KAP-1 co-repressor. Furthermore, its carboxyl-terminal region was identified as the binding site of their repression domains (11Schultz D.C. Friedman J.R. Rauscher III, F.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 428-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 12Murawsky C.M. Brehm A. Badenhorst P. Lowe N. Becker P.B. Travers A.A. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 1089-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 13Kehle J. Beuchle D. Treuheit S. Christen B. Kennison J.A. Bienz M. Muller J. Science. 1998; 282: 1897-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrated that the Mi-2β carboxyl-terminal region interacts with the coiled-coil domain of RFP. Although the mechanism that makes this area repressive is unknown, we speculate that cooperation among various repressors and co-repressors is involved in the repressive activity of this region. In addition, RFP, Mi-2, and HDAC were associated with each other and co-localized in the nucleus, suggesting the possibility that the function of RFP may also be linked with the chromatin remodeling and histone deacetylase activities. The transcriptional repressive activities of both full-length Mi-2β and its carboxyl-terminal region were almost abolished in the fibroblasts generated from a Rfp knockout mouse. This demonstrates the functional importance of the association of RFP with Mi-2 in RFP-expressing cells. Surprisingly, we discovered that the amino-terminal region of Mi-2β has a strong transcriptional activating ability, in contrast to the repressing activity of its carboxyl-terminal region. It turned out that BRG1, a component of another nucleosome remodeling SWI/SNF complex, binds to the Mi-2β amino-terminal region, and the bromodomain of BRG1 is required for this interaction. Intriguingly, expression of the bromodomain markedly impaired the transactivating ability of the Mi-2β amino-terminal region, probably by competing with the binding of endogenous BRG1. This suggests that BRG1 is involved in the transactivating activity of this region. The NuRD complex is generally associated with transcriptional gene silencing. However, recent reports indicate that HDAC1, a subunit of the NuRD complex, is bound to the active promoters of some Drosophila genes (40Breiling A. Turner B.M. Bianchi M.E. Orlando V. Nature. 2001; 412: 65-655Crossref Scopus (203) Google Scholar), and histone deacetylation might be required to enable H3-K4 methylation (41Nakayama J. Rice J.C. Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Grewal S.I. Science. 2001; 292: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that some transcriptional repressing mechanisms are associated with transactivation. BRG1 is part of the SWI/SNF protein complex that is generally involved in transcriptional activation (42Varga-Weisz P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3076-3085Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). BRG1 enhances the activity of the β-catenin and Tcf-target genes (28Barker N. Hurlstone A. Musisi H. Miles A. Bienz M. Clevers H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4935-4943Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) and is required for the activation of Rb (43Strobeck M.W. Reisman D.N. Gunawardena R.W. Betz B.L. Angus S.P. Knudsen K.E. Kowalik T.F. Weissman B.E. Knudsen E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4782-4789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, interestingly, recent reports (22Martens J.A. Winston F. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2231-2236Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 23Muchardt C. Yaniv M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3067-3075Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) indicate that BRG1 also acts as a transcriptional repressor in various species including Drosophila, yeast, and mammals. For example, the interaction of BRG1 with HP1 modulated the heterochromatin structure and enhanced transcriptional repression (24Nielsen A.L. Sanchez C. Ichinose H. Cervino M. Lerouge T. Chambon P. Losson R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5797-5806Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In addition, BRG1 was associated with Sin3A and was involved in transcriptional repression, especially in the repression of neural genes, by the REST transcription factor (44Sif S. Saurin A.J. Imbalzano A.N. Kingston R.E. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 603-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 45Battaglioli E. Andres M.E. Rose D.W. Chenoweth J.G. Rosenfeld M.G. Anderson M.E. Mandel G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41038-41045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), indicating that the function of BRG1 is not limited to transactivation. Whereas BRG1 and Mi-2 are the main subunits of SWI/SNF and NuRD, which are two well known chromatin remodeling complexes, BRG1 and Mi-2 could also be components of other multiprotein complexes in the context of transcriptional regulation, especially in development. In this regard, it is noteworthy that the Ikaros-containing chromatin remodeling complex (PYR complex) contains components of both the SWI/SNF and NuRD complexes in a single complex that includes Mi-2 and BRG1. It has been speculated that this complex plays a role in γ- to β-globin switching in hematopoietic cells (29O'Neill D.W. Schoetz S.S. Lopez R.A. Castle M. Rabinowitz L. Shor E. Krawchuk D. Goll M.G. Renz M. Seelig H.P. Han S. Seong R.H. Park S.D. Agalioti T. Munshi N. Thanos D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Bank A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 7572-7582Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In addition, ALL-1, a member of the human trithrax group protein family and a mammalian homologue of Drosophila trithorax, assembles the stable multiprotein supercomplex composed of over 29 proteins. These include the components of TFIID, SWI/SNF, NuRD, SNF2H, and Sin3A, and this complex binds the promoter region of the Hox a9 gene. Mi-2 and Brahma, which is highly homologous to BRG-1, were found to be involved in the ALL-1-containing multiprotein supercomplex (30Nakamura T. Mori T. Tada S. Krajewski W. Rozovskaia T. Wassell R. Dubois G. Mazo A. Croce C.M. Canaani E. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1119-1128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). We speculate that direct association of chromatin remodeling proteins plays a key role in the formation of multiprotein complexes that includes components of distinct protein complexes such as SWI/SNF and NuRD. In conclusion, we have identified transcriptional activating and repressing regions in the chromatin remodeling protein Mi-2β. These regions were associated with different proteins, BRG1 and RFP, and had distinct transcriptional activities. These findings provide new insight into the cooperation of transactivating and repressing protein complexes and the formation of multiprotein supercomplexes that are involved in transcriptional regulation.

https://openalex.org/W2084625453,"Members of the FE65 family of adaptor proteins, FE65, FE65L1, and FE65L2, bind the C-terminal region of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Overexpression of FE65 and FE65L1 was previously reported to increase the levels of α-secretase-derived APP (APPsα). Increased β-amyloid (Aβ) generation was also observed in cells showing the FE65-dependent increase in APPsα. To understand the mechanism for the observed increase in both Aβ and APPsα given that α-secretase cleavage of a single APP molecule precludes Aβ generation, we examined the effects of FE65L1 overexpression on APP C-terminal fragments (APP CTFs). Our data show that FE65L1 potentiates γ-secretase processing of APP CTFs, including the amyloidogenic CTF C99, accounting for the ability of FE65L1 to increase generation of APP C-terminal domain and Aβ40. The FE65L1 modulation of these processing events requires binding of FE65L1 to APP and APP CTFs and is not because of a direct effect on γ-secretase activity, because Notch intracellular domain generation is not altered by FE65L1. Furthermore, enhanced APP CTF processing can be detected in early endosome vesicles but not in endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi membranes, suggesting that the effects of FE65L1 occur at or near the plasma membrane. Finally, although FE65L1 increases APP C-terminal domain production, it does not mediate the APP-dependent transcriptional activation observed with FE65. Members of the FE65 family of adaptor proteins, FE65, FE65L1, and FE65L2, bind the C-terminal region of the amyloid precursor protein (APP).

Cleavage of C99, the APP C-terminal fragment derived from β-secretase processing of APP, by γ-secretase generates the Aβ peptide. Furthermore, γ-secretase cleavage of C99 and C83, the α-secretase derived APP C-terminal fragment (APP CTF), releases the APP C-terminal domain (AICD), a 6-kDa peptide also called CTFγ or AID, that regulates transcription after translocation to the nucleus (1Kimberly W.T.

YENP is a clathrin-coated pit internalization domain required for trafficking of APP into the endocytic pathway (8Perez R.G. Squazzo S.L. Koo E.H. J. Biol.

Previous studies have shown that FE65 protein family members can alter the processing of APP by influencing APP trafficking. Increased maturation of APP and increased α-secretase-cleaved APP (APPsα) secretion was observed in H4 neuroglioma cells induced for FE65L1 overexpression (10Guenette S.Y. Chen J. Ferland A. Haass C. Capell A. Tanzi R.E. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 985-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Furthermore, enhanced secretion of APPsα and Aβ was reported in Madin-Darby canine kidney APP695 cells stably overexpressing FE65 (11Sabo S.L. Lanier L.M. Ikin A.F. Khorkova O. Sahasrabudhe S.

Cell surface APP levels were elevated in these cells, and increased routing of APP into the endocytic pathway from the plasma membrane was suggested to account for the observed increase in Aβ (11Sabo S.L.

The FE65 proteins are adaptor proteins that have three protein-protein interaction domains, a WW domain and two PID/PTB domains, and are thus capable of mediating the formation of protein complexes.

Neurobiol. Aging. 2002; 23: 283Google Scholar). In addition, up-regulation of FE65 and Tip60 is observed in mouse brains of APP transgenic mice and results in enhanced expression of the tetraspanin, KAI-1 (4Baek S.H. Ohgi K.A. Rose D.W. Koo E.H.

Given the importance of the APP CTFs for Aβ generation and transcriptional activation and the fact that the FE65 proteins bind the NPXY motif present in all APP CTFs, we examined the effect of FE65L1 overexpression on APP CTF processing in H4 neuroglioma cells. Our data show that FE65L1 overexpression results in increased generation of AICD and Aβ in these cells by increasing γ-secretase processing of both C83 and C99. Furthermore, FE65L1 does not directly alter γ-secretase activity, but binding of FE65L1 to APP and APP CTFs is necessary for FE65L1-dependent γ-secretase processing of APP CTFs. These data suggest that the interaction of FE65L1 with APP CTFs facilitates access of γ-secretase to its substrates. In addition, we provide evidence that these events occur at or near the cell surface. Reagents—The anti-APP C-terminal polyclonal sera (A8717, Sigma) and the APP C-terminal monoclonal antibodies 13G8 (a generous gift from Peter Seubert) and C1/6.1 (a generous gift from Paul Mathews and Ralph Nixon) were used to detect APP and APP CTFs. The 6E10 monoclonal antibody (Signet, Dedham, MA) was used to recognize APPsα and C99. The PS1 antisera Ab14 recognizing the N-terminal fragment of PS1 was a gift from Sam Gandy.

The anti-FE65L1 polyclonal sera was raised in rabbit against a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein coding for amino acids 201-305, which include the WW domain of human FE65L1 (GenBank™ accession number U62325). Antibodies against early endosome marker (EEA1), GM130 (cis-Golgi marker), and syntaxin 6 (trans-Golgi marker) were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Polyclonal antibodies detecting the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein calnexin (Stressgen) and the endosome marker Rab5 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used to identify these membrane fractions.

Complete protease inhibitor pellets without EDTA (Roche Applied Science) were used for all cell extractions. Cell Culture, cDNA Constructs, and Transfections—The human H4 neuroglioma cell line, 32-6, is tetracycline-repressible for human HA-tagged FE65L1 and expresses endogenous levels of APP (10Guenette S.Y.

The tetracycline-repressible HA-tagged mutant FE65L1 cell line (C702V) expressing a mutant allele of FE65L1 bearing a C → V substitution at residue 702 of FE65L1 (National Center for Biotechnology accession number XM_051782), a conserved residue located in the APP binding PID2 domain, was established as described (26Guenette S.Y. Chen J. Ferland A. Tanzi R.E. Iqbal K. Swaab D.F. Winblad B. Wisniewski H.M. Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., Chichester, UK1999: 591-598Google Scholar). The C702V mutation was created in the pHA-FE65L1 plasmid using the primers 5′-GCACTTCTGATATCGTAACATGACGGCGGCCTGCACCGCT-3′ and 5′-AGCGGTGCAGGCCGCCGTCATGTTACGATATCAGAAGTGC-3′ by PCR mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene). Cells induced for 72 h by removal of tetracycline showed similar expression levels for WT HA-FE65L1 and C702V HA-FE65L1. FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) was used for all transient transfections. The mammalian notch NΔE construct (a generous gift from R. Kopan) was transiently transfected into H4 neuroglioma cells uninduced and induced for FE65L1 at 24 h post-induction, and cells were harvested at 72 h. Proteasomal, lysosomal, calpain, and γ-secretase inhibitors in Me2SO were added at the concentrations indicated to complete media containing the appropriate antibiotics for cell treatments of 3 h with the exception of the lactacystin treatment, which lasted 24 h. Immunoprecipitations and Western Blot Analyses—Cells were lysed in extraction buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors. Protein concentrations of total cell lysates were determined by the BCA protein assay (Pierce). APP CTFs were immunoprecipitated from 500 μg of total protein using the A8717 antibody and protein A magnetic beads (Qiagen). The precipitates were washed three times in extraction buffer and subjected to electrophoresis on 10-20% acrylamide Tris-Tricine gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore), and Western blot analysis was performed using the 13G8 antibody according to standard protocols. Metabolic Labeling—H4 32-6 cells were grown to 80-90% confluency in the presence or absence of tetracycline on 150-mm-diameter culture dishes. Cells were trypsinized and resuspended in 1 ml methionine- and cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. After a 30-min starvation at 37 °C, cells were labeled for 20 min with 250 mCi/ml [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), washed, and chased in complete medium containing excess (5-fold) unlabeled methionine and cysteine. The addition of inhibitors to the growth medium was made 2 h before initiation of each pulse/chase experiment, and tetracycline was added to maintain the uninduced state of the controls throughout. Cell lysate volumes containing 1000 μg of protein were immunoprecipitated with APP CTF antibody and 20 μl of protein A/G PLUS-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The immune complexes were separated on a 10-20% Tricine gel. The gels were dried after fixation, and the radioactive signal was detected using a Cyclone phosphorimaging device (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cell-free AICD Generation—AICD generation was examined in vitro using an active membrane preparation as described by Pinnix et al. (27Pinnix I. Musunuru U. Tun H. Sridharan A. Golde T. Eckman C. Ziani-Cherif C. Onstead L. Sambamurti K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 481-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The 10,000 × g active post-nuclear membrane fraction containing the same amount of protein (5 mg) isolated from cells uninduced or induced for FE65L1 was resuspended in 200 μl of Buffer A (50 mm HEPES buffer, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, containing 5 mm 1,10-phenanthroline) and incubated at 37 °C or on ice for the indicated times. After the incubation, the released APP CTFs and AICD were separated from the membranes by centrifugation at 10,000 × g. APP CTFs and AICD were immunoprecipitated with A8717 (20 μg of purified serum IgG) from the reaction supernatant. The membrane fractions were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Western blot analysis using the A8717 antibody was performed on these immune complexes, and equal volumes of the active membrane fractions were loaded after completion of the reaction. Subcellular Fractionation—Five 15-cm dishes of cells were resuspended in 3 ml of homogenization buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.25 m sucrose plus protease inhibitor. Cells were disrupted by 10 strokes in a metal homogenizer followed by 5 passages through a 27-gauge needle. Nuclei and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 10 min. The post-nuclear supernatants were centrifuged for 1 h at 65,000 × g. The resultant membrane pellets were resuspended in 0.8 ml of homogenization buffer. Discontinuous iodixanol gradients were prepared as described by Xia et al. (28Xia W. Zhang J. Ostaszewski B.L. Kimberly W.T. Seubert P. Koo E.H. Shen J. Selkoe D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16465-16471Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) starting from an OptiPrep (Invitrogen) gradient stock solution containing a final concentration of 50% OptiPrep in 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. The resuspended vesicle fractions were loaded on top of the gradients and centrifuged in a SW41 rotor at 40,000 rpm for 2.5 h at 4 °C. Fractions of 1 ml were collected. Early Endosome Isolation—Five 15-cm dishes of cells were resuspended in 2-ml homogenization buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 320 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm MgCl2 with protease inhibitors. Cells were disrupted by 10 strokes in a metal homogenizer followed by 5 passages through a 27-gauge needle. After centrifugation for 10 min at 4,000 × g, the post-nuclear supernatants were collected and loaded on an OptiPrep gradient consisting of 1 ml of 60%, 3 ml of 30%, 3 ml of 20%, and 3 ml of 10% OptiPrep diluted in buffer with 250 mm sucrose, 6 mm EDTA, 60 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 in 13-ml Beckman SW41 centrifuge tubes. After centrifugation at 40,000 rpm for 1 h and 15 min, the endosome-enriched light vesicle fraction was collected by taking the 0-10% interface. Early endosome vesicles were further enriched from the light vesicle fraction (1 mg) by immunoprecipitation of early endosome vesicles with the EEA1 antibody (1 μg) and goat anti-mouse IgG magnetic beads (Polysciences Inc.). APPsα and Aβ Measurements—Media conditioned for 4 h was collected from cells uninduced or induced for HA-hFE65L1 for 65 h, and APPs was enriched by MacroPrep High Q chromatography as previously described (10Guenette S.Y. Chen J. Ferland A. Haass C. Capell A. Tanzi R.E. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 985-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Cell lysates corresponding to each of the conditioned media samples were obtained, and Western blot analysis using 6E10 showed that cellular APP levels were no different for cells induced for WT FE65L1 or FE65L1 C702V (data not shown). APPsα was detected by Western blot analysis from the MacroPrep High Q eluates using the 6E10 antibody. For Aβ measurement, conditioned media was collected after a 24-h incubation from cells that were either uninduced or induced for FE65L1 expression for 48 h. Endogenous Aβ levels were measured by Sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using the antibodies BAN50/BA27 for Aβ 1-40 and BAN50/BC05 for Aβ1-42 as previously described (29Eckman E.A. Reed D.K. Eckman C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24540-24548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Luciferase Assays—H4 neuroglioma naïve cells were transiently transfected for measurement of APP-dependent transcriptional activation of a GAL4-luciferase construct as previously described (3Cao X. Sudhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). Each transfection contained the pG5E1B-luc luciferase reporter construct and the pCMVlacZ β-galactosidase control plasmid and either pMST (GAL4) or pMST-APP (APP-GAL4) plasmids in combination with one of the FE65 plasmids, FE65-myc (CMV promoter), rat FE65 (RSV promoter), hFE65L1 (CMV promoter), or mouse FE65L1 (CMV promoter). DNA amounts used for transfection are as previously described (3Cao X. Sudhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). Luciferase assays were performed with the luciferase assay system (Promega), and β-galactosidase activity was measured with the luminescent β-gal kit (BD Biosciences). Luciferase measurements were normalized for transfection efficiency using the β-galactosidase activity values. Results are expressed as fold increase over the luciferase activity obtained with the pMST control plasmid. Increased γ-Secretase Cleavage of the α-Secretase-derived APP CTF, C83, in H4 Cells Overexpressing FE65L1—We examined APP CTF levels in H4 neuroglioma cells overexpressing FE65L1 to determine whether FE65L1 influenced APP CTF stability. Western blot analysis of total protein lysates obtained from cells uninduced or induced for FE65L1 overexpression using an APP CTF antibody (13G8) showed a single 10-kDa APP CTF fragment corresponding to the α-secretase-derived APP CTF, C83, that was dramatically decreased in lysates obtained from H4 cells induced for FE65L1 overexpression (Fig. 1A). To determine whether the effect of FE65L1 on C83 steady state levels was due to increased degradation of C83, we tested lysosome and proteasome inhibitors for their ability to block the FE65L1-dependent decrease in C83. Our data show that neither ammonium chloride nor chloroquine had any effect on the observed decrease in C83 upon FE65L1 overexpression (Fig. 1B), indicating that the lysosomal pathway is not responsible for the observed reduction in C83 levels. MG132 cell treatments resulted in accumulation of APP CTFβ and Aβ40, indicating that the proteasome plays a role in APP CTFβ degradation (30Nunan J. Shearman M.S. Checler F. Cappai R. Evin G. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Small D.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5329-5336Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Similarly, calpain was previously implicated in the degradation of C83 and C99 and in the generation of Aβ, particularly Aβ42 (20Mathews P.M. Jiang Y. Schmidt S.D. Grbovic O.M. Mercken M. Nixon R.A.

Chem. 1998; 273: 31947-31955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To test the possibility that calpain or proteasomal processing of C83 was increased in H4 cells overexpressing FE65L1, we treated cells with the calpain inhibitor CI-III and the proteasome inhibitors MG132 and lactacystin and examined C83 levels. Neither proteasomal nor calpain inhibitors were able to abolish the FE65L1-dependent decrease in C83 (Fig. 1B). However, a comparison of the APP CTF levels in Me2SO-treated versus drug-treated cells showed that the drug-treated cells had higher APP CTF levels in both uninduced and induced cells than the Me2SO controls. These data suggest that these inhibitors affect activities that alter APP CTF levels but do not prevent the FE65L1-dependent C83 decrease. ALLN, reported to inhibit calpain, the proteasome, and cathepsins (31Bunnell W.L. Pham H.V. Glabe C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31947-31955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), was able to partially inhibit the FE65L1-dependent decrease in C83, but did not completely reverse the effects of FE65L1 on APP CTF processing. For ALLN treatments, C83 levels were higher in the uninduced cells treated with ALLN by 1.8-fold, and accumulation of a higher APP CTF fragment was also observed (possibly C89) (Fig. 1B). We can conclude from these data that the observed decrease in C83 in H4 cells overexpressing FE65L1 is not due to increased catabolism of C83 by calpain, the proteasome, or the lysosome. Both C99 and C83 are substrates for γ-secretase (32Weidemann A. Eggert S. Reinhard F.B. Vogel M. Paliga K. Baier G. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Evin G.

To determine whether FE65L1 can modulate γ-secretase cleavage of C83, we treated H4 neuroglioma cells uninduced and induced for FE65L1 overexpression with structurally different γ-secretase inhibitors (22Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Moore C.L. Leatherwood D.D. Ostaszewski B. Rahmati T. Donkor I.O. Selkoe D.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4720-4727Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 24Kimberly W.T. Esler W.P. Ye W. Ostaszewski B.L. Gao J. Diehl T. Selkoe D.J. Wolfe M.S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Our results show that all five γ-secretase inhibitors can restore C83 levels to those of the uninduced controls (Fig. 1C). In fact, γ-secretase inhibitor treatments produce C83 levels that are higher in cells overexpressing FE65L1 than in the control cells, consistent with our previous observation that APP undergoes increased processing by α-secretase (10Guenette S.Y. Chen J. Ferland A. Haass C. Capell A. Tanzi R.E. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 985-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These data indicate that C83 processing by γ-secretase can account for the FE65L1-dependent increase in C83 turnover. FE65L1 Overexpression Decreases the Half-life of C83 and Facilitates AICD Generation—Cleavage of C83 by γ-secretase results in the generation of p3 and AICD (35Haass C. Hung A.Y. Schlossmacher M.G. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3021-3024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Given that C83 processing by γ-secretase is increased in H4 neuroglioma cells overexpressing FE65L1, we predicted that AICD generation from these cells would be increased. To test whether FE65L1 decreases the half-life of C83 and produces higher levels of AICD, H4 cells uninduced and induced for FE65L1 overexpression were metabolically labeled for 20 min and chased with excess methionine for up to 4"

The genes for this system are encoded in the ptsGHI operon, which is induced by glucose and depends on a termination/antitermination mechanism involving a riboswitch and the RNA-binding antitermination protein GlcT. In the absence of glucose, GlcT is inactive, and a terminator is formed in the leader region of the ptsG mRNA. If glucose is present, GlcT can bind to its RNA target and prevent transcription termination. The GlcT protein is composed of three domains, an N-terminal RNA binding domain and two PTS regulation domains, PTS regulation domain (PRD) I and PRD-II. In this work, we demonstrate that GlcT can be phosphorylated by two PTS proteins, HPr and the glucose-specific enzyme II (EIIGlc). HPr-dependent phosphorylation occurs on PRD-II and has a slight stimulatory effect on GlcT activity. In contrast, EIIGlc phosphorylates the PRD-I of GlcT, and this phosphorylation inactivates GlcT. This latter phosphorylation event links the availability of glucose to the expression of the ptsGHI operon via the phosphorylation state of EIIGlc and GlcT. This is the first in vitro demonstration of a direct phosphorylation of an antiterminator of the BglG family by the corresponding PTS permease.

Glucose is the preferred source of carbon and energy for many bacteria. The sugar is transported into the cell and phosphorylated. The resulting glucose 6-phosphate can immediately feed into glycolysis. In Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and several other bacteria, glucose is taken up and concomitantly phosphorylated by the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS). 1The abbreviations used are: PTSphosphotransferase systemEI and EIIEnzymes I and II, respectivelyRATRNA antiterminatorPRDPTS regulation domainPEPphosphoenol pyruvate. This system is made up of two general energy-coupling proteins, Enzyme I (EI) and HPr, and several multi-domain sugar specific permeases (Enzyme II, EII), which may exist as individual proteins or fused in a single polypeptide. In E. coli, the glucose-specific EII is composed of a membrane-bound protein comprising the actual transporter domain EIIC and the phosphotransfer domain EIIB. In addition, the EIIA domain is present as a cytoplasmic protein. In B. subtilis, all domains of the glucose permease are fused to form a single polypeptide with the domain arrangement EIICBA (1Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Microbiol.

It was long considered that the genes encoding the components of the glucose PTS are constitutively expressed in bacteria. Although this is the case for the genes encoding the general proteins, ptsI and ptsH, the gene encoding EIIGlc, ptsG, is induced by glucose in both E. coli and B. subtilis (1Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 543-594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Stülke J. Hillen W. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2000; 54: 849-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 3Plumbridge J. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2002; 5: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In E. coli, regulation of ptsG expression is accomplished by the transcriptional repressor Mlc. In the presence of glucose, this repressor is sequestered by the non-phosphorylated EIICBGlc and, thus, is unable to repress ptsG transcription (3Plumbridge J. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2002; 5: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In B. subtilis, glucose induction of ptsG expression is mediated by transcriptional antitermination. In the absence of glucose, transcription initiated at the ptsG promoter is terminated in the leader region of the mRNA. If glucose is present, an antitermination protein, GlcT, is active and prevents transcription termination by binding to the RNA antiterminator (RAT), which overlaps the terminator. Binding of GlcT to the RAT is thought to stabilize the RAT structure and to prevent formation of the terminator (4Stülke J. Martin-Verstraete I. Zagorec M. Rose M. Klier A. Rapoport G. Mol.

Microbiol. 1998; 28: 865-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In the E. coli BglG and the B. subtilis LicT protein, the second PRD (PRD-II) is phosphorylated on conserved histidine residues by the HPr protein of the PTS in the absence of glucose. This phosphorylation results in a structural change of the protein and stimulates the activity of these antiterminator proteins. In contrast, phosphorylation of PRD-I by the corresponding EII is thought to inactivate these antiterminator proteins in the absence of the inducer, salicin (8Görke B. Rak B.

The direct phosphorylation of antiterminators of the BglG family by HPr is well documented for several proteins (8Görke B. Rak B.

In contrast, the regulatory pathway leading from absence of inducer via phosphorylation of EII and PRD-I to the inactivity of the antiterminators is much less understood. The phosphotransfer from EII to an antiterminator has never been demonstrated unequivocally in vitro. Phosphorylation of antiterminators of the BglG family was proposed to affect the dimerization of the protein, which is required for interacting with the RNA (14Amster-Choder O. Wright A. Science. 1992; 257: 1395-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 15van Tilbeurgh H. Declerck N. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 685-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Activity of GlcT is also controlled by PTS components. However, in contrast to BglG and LicT, HPr is not required to stimulate the activity of GlcT. Constitutive activity of GlcT was observed in mutants affecting HPr or EIIGlc. However, mutations of the phosphorylation sites of EIIGlc did not completely abolish regulation of GlcT activity. The mechanism by which EIIGlc controls GlcT activity in response to the availability of glucose has, therefore, remained a matter of speculation. It was proposed that either EIIGlc phosphorylates and inactivates GlcT directly in the absence of glucose or that HPr is the actual phosphate donor in a ternary complex with GlcT and EIIGlc (16Bachem S. Stülke J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5319-5326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this work, we studied the pathways of phosphorylation of GlcT by HPr and EIIGlc. Although HPr efficiently phosphorylates the PRD-II, EIIGlc does directly and specifically phosphorylate PRD-I of GlcT. This is the first time that direct phosphorylation of an antiterminator of the BglG family by an EII was demonstrated. Phosphorylation in PRD-I inactivates GlcT, whereas phosphorylation of PRD-II has no significant impact on GlcT antitermination activity. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—The E. coli and B. subtilis strains used in this study are listed in Table I. All B. subtilis strains are derivatives of the wild type strain 168. B. subtilis was grown in CSE minimal medium (70 mm K2HPO4, 30 mm KH2PO4, 25 mm (NH4)2SO4, 0.5 mm MgSO4, 10 μm MnSO4, 22 mg ferric ammonium citrate/liter, sodium succinate (6 g l-1) potassium glutamate (8 g l-1)) supplemented with auxotrophic requirements (at 50 mg liter-1) (17Faires N. Tobisch S. Bachem S. Martin-Verstraete I. Hecker M. Stülke J. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1999; 1: 141-148PubMed Google Scholar). Carbon sources were added as indicated. E. coli was grown in LB medium, and transformants were selected on plates containing ampicillin (100 μg ml-1). LB and SP plates were prepared by the addition of 17 g liter-1 Bacto agar (Difco) to the medium.Table IBacterial strains and plasmids used in this studyStrainRelevant genotypeReference/ConstructionE. coliDH5αrecA1 end A1 gyrA96 thi hsdR17rK− mK+relA1 supE44 Φ80ΔlacZΔM15 Δ(lacZYA-argF)U16918FT1F− lon ompT rBmB hsdS gal (clts857 ind1 Sam7 nin5 lacUV-T7 gene1) Δ(ptsHI crr)55NM522supE thi-1 Δ(lac-proAB) Δ (mcrB-hsdSM)5 (rK− mK−) [F′ proAB lac1qZΔM15]56B. subtilis168trpC2Laboratory collectionQB5448trpC2 amyE::(ΔLA ptsG′-′lacZ aphA3)4QB7035trpC2 amyE::(ΔLA pts G′-′lacZ cat)4GP103trpC2 glcT-H104D amyE::(ΔLA ptsG-lacZ, aphA3)16GP113trpC2 ptsG ΔEIIBA amyE::(ΔLA ptsG′-′lacZ aphA3)16GP125trpC2 glcT-H104D amyE::(ΔLA ptsG′-′lacZ cat)QB7035→GP103GP126trpC2 glcT-H104A amyE::(ΔLA ptsG′-′lacZ aphA3)pGP142 + QB5448 → 168GP127trpC2 glcT-H163D amyE::(ΔLA ptsG′-′lacZ aphA3)pGP128 + QB5448 → 168GP128trpC2 glcT-H210D amyE::(ΔLA ptsG′-′lacZ aphA3)pGP130 + QB5448 → GP125 Open table in a new tab DNA Manipulation—Transformation of E. coli and plasmid DNA extraction were performed using standard procedures (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, and DNA polymerases were used as recommended by the manufacturers. DNA fragments were purified from agarose gels using the Nucleospin extract kit (Macherey and Nagel). Pfu DNA polymerase was used for the PCR as recommended by the manufacturer. DNA sequences were determined using the dideoxy chain termination method (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Chromosomal DNA of B. subtilis was isolated as described (19Kunst F. Rapoport G. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2403-2407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformation and Characterization of the Phenotype—B. subtilis was transformed with plasmid DNA and chromosomal DNA according to the two-step protocol (19Kunst F. Rapoport G. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2403-2407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformants were selected on SP plates containing kanamycin (5 μg ml-1), chloramphenicol (5 μg ml-1), or erythromycin plus lincomycin (2 μg ml-1 and 25 μg ml-1, respectively). The presence of point mutations in glcT or ptsG was verified by sequencing of the relevant alleles. Quantitative assays of lacZ expression in B. subtilis were performed with cell extracts using o-nitrophenyl β-galactopyranoside as the substrate (19Kunst F. Rapoport G. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2403-2407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One unit of β-galactosidase is defined as the amount of enzyme that produces 1 nmol min-1 of o-nitrophenol at 28 °C. Expression and Mutagenesis—For overexpression of His-tagged Enzyme I and HPr of B. subtilis, the plasmids pAG3 and pAG2, respectively, were used (20Galinier A. Haiech J. Kilhoffer M.C. Jaquinod M. Stülke J. Deutscher J. Martin-Verstraete I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8439-8444Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). HPr carrying am N-terminal Strep tag was constructed as follows. In a first step, the ptsH gene was amplified using the oligonucleotides SB51 (5′-AAAGGCGCCATGGCACAAAAAACATTTAAA) and SB46 (5′-AAAGGATCCTTACTCGCCGAGTCCTTCGCTTTTCAT). The resulting PCR product was digested with KasI and BamHI (the restriction sites were introduced with the primers (underlined)) and cloned into the vector pASK-IBA5 (IBA, Göttingen, Germany) cut with the same enzymes. This plasmid, pGP151, contains the ptsH gene fused to a sequence encoding a Strep tag. In a next step the fusion was amplified using primers SB52 (5′ CGAGGGCAACATATGGCTAGCTGGAGC; an NdeI restriction site is underlined) and SB46. This PCR product was cloned between the NdeI and BamHI sites of the expression vector pET3c (Novagen, Inc., Madison, WI). The resulting plasmid was pGP152. To express and purify GlcT fused to a hexahistidine sequence at the N terminus, we used plasmid pGP124 (5Langbein I. Bachem S. Stülke J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 795-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Mutant alleles of glcT were obtained by two-step PCR mutagenesis essentially as described previously (16Bachem S. Stülke J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5319-5326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting fragments were cloned between the SalI and HindIII sites of the expression vector pWH844 (21Schirmer F. Ehrt S. Hillen W. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1329-1336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting plasmids were pGP128 (glcT-H163D), pGP130 (glcT-H210D), pGP133 (glcT-H210D H272D), pGP135 (glcT-H163D H210D), pGP142 (glcT-H104A), and pGP148 (glcT-H104A H210D). The EIIBA domains of the glucose permease were fused to an N-terminal His tag by amplifying the part of ptsG encoding these domains with the oligonucleotides SB25 (5′-AAAGTCGACGGTGAAGCAGGAGATCTTCCT; a SalI site is underlined) and SB2 (5′-CCGGTACGCTTTTGCATTCGC) and plasmid pTS22 (22Gonzy-Tréboul G. Steinmetz M. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2287-2290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as a template. The PCR product was digested with SalI and HindIII and cloned into pWH844. The resulting plasmid was pGP123. Plasmid pBQ200 was used for the expression of cloned genes in B. subtilis under control of the strong degQ36 promoter (23Martin-Verstraete I. Débarbouillé M. Klier A. Rapoport G. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 178-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The ptsG fragment encoding EIIBA was amplified using the primers SB24 (5′-AAAGGATCCAGAGGAGGTCAATTCTTATGGGTGAAGCAGGAGATCTTCTTCCTTATGAG) and SB2 (24Bachem S. Faires N. Stülke J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 156: 233-238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SB24 introduces a BamHI restriction site (underlined in the sequence), a ribosomal binding site identical to the one found upstream of the ptsG coding region, and a ATG start codon. The resulting PCR product was cloned as a BamHI/HindIII fragment into pBQ200 treated with the same enzymes. The resulting plasmid was pGP122. Protein Purification—E. coli DH5α, NM522, and FT1 were used as hosts for the overexpression of recombinant proteins. The cultures were grown in one liter of LB medium at 37 °C (for the purification of wild type GlcT, HPr, and EI) or 23 °C (mutant forms of GlcT). Expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration 1 mm) to logarithmically growing cultures (A600 of 0.8). Cells were harvested 1 h after induction. The pellets were resuspended in 30 ml of disruption buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, 200 ml NaCl, pH 7.5). The cells were disrupted by using a French press (20,000 p.s.i., 138,000 kilopascals; Spectronic Instruments, UK). For proteins carrying a His tag, the crude extracts were passed over a 3-ml Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column. The column was washed with 30 ml of disruption buffer followed by elution with an imidazole gradient. Seven different concentration of imidazole were used: 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 300, and 500 mm imidazole in 10 ml of disruption buffer, pH 7.5. For HPr carrying a Strep tag, the crude extracts were prepared as described above. The extract was passed over a 3-ml Streptactin column (IBA, Göttingen, Germany) followed by washing with 20 ml of disruption buffer. The recombinant protein was eluted with 5 ml of disruption buffer containing desthiobiotin (Sigma, final concentration 2.5 mm). The Bio-Rad dye binding assay was used to determine protein concentrations. Bovine serum albumin was used as the standard. Western Blot Analysis—For Western blot analyses of HPr, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) by electroblotting. HPr was detected with rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against HPr of B. subtilis (25Monedero V. Poncet S. Mijakovic I. Fieulaine S. Dossonnet V. Martin-Verstraete I. Nessler S. Deutscher J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3928-3937Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The antibodies were visualized by using anti-rabbit IgG-AP secondary antibodies (Chemikon International, Temecula, CA) and the CDP* detection system (Roche Diagnostics). Protein Phosphorylation and Stability Assays of the Phosphorylated Proteins—In vitro phosphorylation of GlcT and of EIIBAGlc by EI and HPr were performed with 0.5 μm [32P]PEP (0.1 μCi) in a total volume of 20 μl essentially as described previously (9Lindner C. Galinier A. Hecker M. Deutscher J. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 995-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). [32P]PEP was synthesized in an enzymatic reaction using pyruvate kinase (26Roossien F.F. Brink J. Robillard G.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 760: 185-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). [32P]PEP was separated from [γ-32P]ATP by ion-exchange chromatography (35Stülke J. Martin-Verstraete I. Charrier V. Klier A. Deutscher J. Rapoport G. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6928-6936Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The stabilities of GlcT and EIIBAGlc phosphate were studied under acidic and basic conditions (27Amster-Choder O. Wright A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5621-5624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of GlcT by Enzyme I and HPr—The HPr protein of the PTS is capable of interacting with and of phosphorylating several other proteins in B. subtilis, including sugar specific Enzymes II of the PTS, the glycerol kinase, and PRD containing regulators (7Stülke J. Arnaud M. Rapoport G. Martin-Verstraete I. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 865-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 28Reizer J. Bachem S. Reizer A. Arnaud M. Saier Jr., M.H. Stülke J. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 3419-3429Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 29Darbon E. Servant P. Poncet S. Deutscher J. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 1039-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We asked therefore whether HPr would also directly phosphorylate GlcT. Phosphorylation assays were performed with [32P]PEP in the presence of EI, HPr, or both proteins. As shown in Fig. 1, the His-tagged general PTS proteins were able to autophosphorylate (EI) and to accept the phosphate residue (HPr). Phosphorylation of GlcT was observed in the presence of both general PTS proteins, whereas no GlcT phosphorylation was detected in the absence of HPr (Fig. 1). Thus, GlcT was phosphorylated by HPr. The PRDs of GlcT contain four strongly conserved histidine residues. In other PRD-containing regulators, these histidine residues are the sites of phosphorylation (9Lindner C. Galinier A. Hecker M. Deutscher J. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 995-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 27Amster-Choder O. Wright A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5621-5624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Martin-Verstraete I. Charrier V. Stülke J. Galinier A. Erni B. Rapoport G. Deutscher J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 293-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To test whether histidine residues serve as phosphorylation sites in GlcT, we studied the stability of the phosphate bound. As a control, EIIBAGlc was used; it is known to be phosphorylated on a histidine and a cysteine residue in its EIIA and EIIB domains, respectively (1Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 543-594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Bachem S. Faires N. Stülke J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 156: 233-238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In both proteins the phosphate bounds were stable in the presence of sodium hydroxide (Fig. 2). In contrast, the GlcT phosphorylation signal disappeared completely after incubation with hydrochloric acid, whereas some phosphorylation of EIIBAGlc was still detectable under these conditions. The strong reduction of signal intensity of phosphorylated EIIBAGlc is in good agreement with the fact that one phosphate is present as a phosphoamidate (which is acid-labile), whereas the other is bound to a cysteine (this phosphate is stable under strongly acidic conditions) (31Fujitaki J.M. Smith R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, we may assume that a phosphoamidate is present in GlcT. Phosphorylated EI exhibited the same stability pattern as GlcT. This observation is in good agreement with the idea that the phosphate in both EI and GlcT is present as a phosphoamidate and, therefore, most likely bound to a histidyl residue. HPr Specifically Phosphorylates PRD-II of GlcT—GlcT contains two conserved histidyl residues in each PRD. HPr might therefore phosphorylate sites in both PRDs as proposed for LicT (9Lindner C. Galinier A. Hecker M. Deutscher J. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 995-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) or it might specifically phosphorylate one of the two PRDs. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we purified a series of GlcT proteins with mutations at the positions of the conserved histidine residues. These mutant proteins were used for phosphorylation assays with [32P]PEP in the presence of EI and HPr. GlcT proteins with mutations affecting the two histidine residues in PRD-I (His-104, His-163) were phosphorylated as efficiently as the wild type protein (Fig. 3). We may, thus, conclude that HPr does not phosphorylate the PRD-I. In contrast, a replacement of His-210 by a aspartyl residue resulted in strongly reduced phosphorylation of GlcT. Unfortunately, we were not able to test the effect of a replacement of His-272 since this mutant protein could not be purified. To verify the specific phosphorylation of PRD-II by HPr, we constructed plasmids encoding GlcT variants with double mutations of His-210 and either of the three other potential phosphorylation sites. As observed before (see Fig. 3), the replacement of His-210 resulted in a strong decrease of phosphorylation. A quantitative analysis of phosphorylation signals revealed that the H210D mutation reduced the phosphorylation to about 12%. Similarly, the H210D,H272Q double mutant protein exhibited about 10% residual phosphorylation (Fig. 3). In contrast, double mutant proteins in which one of the conserved histidyl residues of the PRD-I was replaced in addition to His-210 were no longer phosphorylated by EI and HPr (Fig. 3). We may, thus, conclude that HPr phosphorylates mainly PRD-II, whereas PRD-I is a minor substrate for HPr. However, our results do not allow us to decide whether HPr phosphorylates His-210 or His-272 or both amino acids in PRD-II. Similarly, the weak HPr-dependent phosphorylation of PRD-I may occur on either or both histidine residues (see “Discussion”). Regulatory Functions of PRD-II—The two PRDs of transcriptional antiterminators are specialized in their functions; PRD-I is thought to be involved in the response to the specific inducer, whereas PRD-II was implicated in carbon catabolite repression (7Stülke J. Arnaud M. Rapoport G. Martin-Verstraete I. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 865-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 8Görke B. Rak B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3370-3379Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 32Lindner C. Hecker M. Le Coq D. Deutscher J. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4819-4828Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The role of HPr-dependent phosphorylation of GlcT in the PRD-II was studied by analyzing the antitermination activity of mutant GlcT variants in vivo. For this purpose we constructed a series of strains containing a fusion of the ptsG promoter region to a promoterless lacZ gene and different glcT alleles. The glcT mutations were transferred into the chromosome of B. subtilis by transformation as described previously (16Bachem S. Stülke J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5319-5326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The strains were grown in CSE minimal medium in the presence and absence of glucose, and their β-galactosidase activities were determined (Table II). In the wild type strain QB5448, expression of ptsG was low in the absence of glucose and strongly induced if glucose was present in the medium. Strain GP128 was isogenic with QB5448, but its glcT gene specified a protein with a H210D replacement. As observed with the wild type, this GlcT variant was inactive in the absence of glucose, suggesting that it was still inactivated as long as no inducer was added to the medium. In the presence of glucose, expression of ptsG was induced in GP128. However, the expression level was somewhat reduced in this strain as compared with the wild type (210 versus 600 units, see Table II), suggesting that GlcT was not fully active. This may indicate that GlcT requires HPr-dependent phosphorylation on PRD-II for full activity or may result from the amino acid exchange. Because GlcT activity is reduced in a ptsH mutant devoid of HPr as compared with induced conditions in the wild type (4Stülke J. Martin-Verstraete I. Zagorec M. Rose M. Klier A. Rapoport G. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), we may conclude that some further activation of GlcT by HPr is required for full antitermination activity (see “Discussion”).Table IIEffect of different glcT alleles on ptsG expressionStrainGenotypeptsG-lacZ expressionaptsG expression is indicated in units/mg of protein.

Open table in a new tab The Role of EIIBAGlc in the Control of GlcT Activity—In contrast to HPr, which exerts a weak stimulating effect on GlcT activity, the glucose-specific EII of the PTS acts as a negative regulator of GlcT activity. A deletion of the phosphotransfer domains of EIIGlc results in constitutive GlcT activity (16Bachem S. Stülke J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5319-5326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To study the phosphorylation of GlcT by EIIGlc, we intended to purify the soluble part of the glucose permease, EIIBAGlc, and to test whether it could phosphorylate GlcT. Before studying the activity of EIIBAGlcin vitro, we analyzed the regulatory effect of the isolated phosphotransfer domains in vivo. For this purpose, we expressed a truncated ptsG gene encoding these domains from plasmid pGP122. The effect of EIIBAGlc on GlcT activity was assayed by measuring the expression of a ptsG-lacZ fusion in the wild type strain QB5448 and in the ΔptsG mutant strain GP113. In this latter strain, the part of ptsG encoding the EIIBA domains was deleted from the chromosome (16Bachem S. Stülke J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5319-5326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the expression of ptsG was inducible by glucose in the wild type strain QB5448, constitutive expression was observed in the ΔptsG mutant GP113. This is in good agreement with previous observations (Ref. 16Bachem S. Stülke J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5319-5326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Table III). In contrast, expression of EIIBAGlc had a severe negative effect on the induction of ptsG in both genetic backgrounds (Table III).

https://openalex.org/W2069117760,"Kainate receptors (KARs) are mediators of excitatory neurotransmission in the mammalian central nervous system, and their efficient targeting and trafficking is critical for normal synaptic function. A key step in the delivery of KARs to the neuronal plasma membrane is the exit of newly assembled receptors from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Here we report the identification of a novel ER retention signal in the alternatively spliced C-terminal domain of the GluR5–2b subunit, which controls receptor trafficking in both heterologous cells and neurons. The ER retention motif consists of a critical arginine (Arg-896) and surrounding amino acids, disruption of which promotes ER exit and surface expression of the receptors, as well as altering their physiological properties. The Arg-896-mediated ER retention of GluR5 is regulated by a mutation that mimics phosphorylation of Thr-898, but not by PDZ interactions. Furthermore, two positively charged residues (Arg-900 and Lys-901) in the C terminus were also found to regulate ER export of the receptors. Taken together, our results identify novel trafficking signals in the C-terminal domain of GluR5–2b and demonstrate that alternative splicing is an important mechanism regulating KAR function.

The intracellular trafficking and surface delivery of multimeric transmembrane proteins, such as kainate receptors, are likely to be tightly controlled processes requiring proper folding and assembly of constituent subunits, so that only fully assembled, functional receptors can be expressed on the plasma membrane. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the primary checkpoint for these complex events (3Teasdale R.D. Jackson M.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 27-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that an arginine-rich ER retention signal controls the ER egress and surface expression of KA2 kainate receptor subunits (4Ren Z. Riley N.J. Garcia E.P. Sanders J.M.

Alternative splicing and RNA editing of ionotropic glutamate receptors have been shown to play important roles in receptor assembly and trafficking (5Okabe S. Miwa A. Okado H. J.

In particular, an RXR (where R is arginine and X a large neutral or positively charged residue) motif was found in the alternatively spliced C1 cassette in the C terminus of NMDA receptor NR1 subunit, mediating the intracellular retention of most C1-containing NR1 isoforms (6Standley S. Roche K.W. McCallum J. Sans N. Wenthold R.J. Neuron. 2000; 28: 887-898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 7Scott D.B. Blanpied T.A. Swanson G.T. Zhang C. Ehlers M.D. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3063-3072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, this RXR-mediated ER retention was regulated by protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation (6Standley S. Roche K.W. McCallum J. Sans N. Wenthold R.J. Neuron. 2000; 28: 887-898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) and a type I PDZ (postsynaptic density-95/Disc large/zona occludens-1)-binding motif in the alternate C2′ splice cassette (6Standley S.

Ehlers M.D. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3063-3072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, arginine 607 (Arg-607) at a Q/R (glutamine/arginine) mRNA editing site has been reported to determine the ER retention of GluR2 AMPA receptor subunits in cultured neurons (8Greger I.H. Khatri L. Ziff E.B. Neuron. 2002; 34: 759-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The GluR5 kainate receptor subunit also undergoes alternative splicing and RNA editing. Alternative splicing of the N-terminal region of the rat GluR5 mRNA yields two different isoforms, GluR5–1 and GluR5–2, where GluR5–1 contains an extra 15 amino acids compared with GluR5–2 (9Bettler B. Boulter J. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. O'Shea-Greenfield A. Deneris E.S. Moll C. Borgmeyer U. Hollmann M. Heinemann S. Neuron. 1990; 5: 583-595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). In addition, GluR5–2 has three splice variants in the C terminus, named GluR5–2a, GluR5–2b, and GluR5–2c (9Bettler B. Boulter J. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. O'Shea-Greenfield A. Deneris E.S. Moll C.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1651-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The shortest isoform, GluR5–2a, results from the introduction of a stop codon after 2 amino acids in the alternatively spliced cassette (10Sommer B. Burnashev N. Verdoorn T.A. Keinanen K. Sakmann B. Seeburg P.H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1651-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), whereas the longest variant, GluR5–2c, is generated by an in-frame insertion of nucleotides, coding for an additional 29 amino acids, into the GluR5–2b sequence (10Sommer B. Burnashev N. Verdoorn T.A. Keinanen K. Sakmann B. Seeburg P.H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1651-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). GluR5–2b and GluR5–2c share a C-terminal consensus type I PDZ-binding domain that is absent in GluR5–2a. Although RNA editing of GluR5 is known to modulate its single-channel conductance, calcium permeability, and rectification properties (10Sommer B. Burnashev N. Verdoorn T.A. Keinanen K. Sakmann B. Seeburg P.H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1651-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 11Swanson G.T. Feldmeyer D. Kaneda M. Cull-Candy S.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 492: 129-142Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar), the functional significance of these splice variants remains to be defined. In the present study, we investigated the intracellular trafficking and surface expression of the GluR5 splice variants, GluR5–2a and GluR5–2b. We now report the identification of a novel ER retention signal present in the alternatively spliced C-terminal domain of GluR5–2b. This signal consists of a critical Arg-896 and surrounding residues, disruption of which promotes ER exit and surface delivery of GluR5–2b receptors in both heterologous cells and hippocampal neurons. In addition, a pair of positively charged residues in the C-terminal region, Arg-900 and Lys-901, were found to regulate ER export of the receptors. Together, our results demonstrate the functional significance of GluR5 alternative splicing and identify ER retention as an important mechanism regulating kainate receptor trafficking and surface expression. Cell Culture—Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells, normal rat kidney (NRK) cells, and COS7 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were grown in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin (37 °C, 5% CO2). For immunocytochemistry experiments, cells were plated onto poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips in the same growth medium. Primary cultures of hippocampal neurons were obtained from E18 rat embryos. Briefly, hippocampi were dissected from E18 Sprague-Dawley rats and dissociated with trypsin. Dissociated cells were then plated onto poly-l-lysine (Sigma)-coated glass coverslips at a density of 7500 cells/cm2 in Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with Glutamax and B27. Arabinofuranosyl-cytosine (5 μm) was added 3 days after plating, and cells were fed twice weekly thereafter. Molecular Biology—The pMLSV N1/N4 expression vector for human Tac was purchased from ATCC. The Tac coding sequence was then amplified by PCR and subcloned into a HindIII-XbaI site in pcDNA3. To generate the Tac-GluR5 and Tac-GluR6 chimeras, we first amplified the N-terminal and transmembrane sequences of Tac, as well as the C termini of GluR5/2a, GluR5–2b, and GluR6 by PCR, then ligated both fragments into a HindIII-XbaI site in pcDNA3 vector after digestion. Deletion mutants of Tac-G5/2b were made by PCR amplification of the desired sequences and subsequent subcloning into the HindIII-XbaI site in pcDNA3 expression vector. Tac-G5/2b and Tac-G6 point mutations were also made by PCR. GluR5–2a-pRK5 and GluR5–2b-pBluescript SK(–) were generous gifts from Dr. Peter Seeburg (Max Planck Institute for Medical Research, Heidelberg, Germany) and Dr. Steve Heinemann (Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA), respectively. To make GFP-GluR5–2b in pRK5 expression vector, we first replaced a C-terminal BamHI-EcoRI fragment in GluR5–2a-pRK5 with the corresponding piece from GluR5–2b amplified by PCR. The GFP coding sequence was then amplified by PCR from pEGFP-C2 vector (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and inserted after residue 36 (counted from the initiator methionine) of GluR5–2b in pRK5, using an XhoI site created by QuikChange (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The pDsRed2-ER vector was purchased from BD Biosciences. Myc-tagged PICK1 (protein interacting with C kinase) and GRIP1a (glutamate receptor interacting protein) in pRK5 vector were gifts from Dr. Richard Huganir (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD), and PSD-95-pGW1 (postsynaptic density-95) was a gift from Dr. Morgan Sheng (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA). All the mutagenesis and PCR-derived sequences were sequenced for verification. Transfection—HEK293, COS7, and NRK cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), following the manufacturer's protocol for transient transfection of adherent cells. Cultured hippocampal neurons (DIV7) were transfected with the LipofectAMINE 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen), using the protocol from the manufacturer. Surface and intracellular protein expressions were analyzed 48 h after transfection. Antibodies—Monoclonal anti-Tac (Covance, Princeton, NJ) was used at 1:800 or 1:2000 for immunostaining of heterologous cells or hippocampal neurons, and 1:4000 for flow cytometry. Polyclonal anti-Tac (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was used at 1:200 for staining and 1:300 for Western blots. Monoclonal anti-TGN38 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), anti-mannosidase II (Covance), and polyclonal anti-giantin (Covance) were used at 1:1000 for immunofluorescence of heterologous cells. Polyclonal anti-calnexin (Stressgen, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada) and anti-GFP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used at 1:200 for immunostaining. Monoclonal anti-autofluorescent protein antibody (Qbiogene, Carlsbad, CA) was used at 1:200 for immunofluorescence and 1:500 for flow cytometry. Monoclonal anti-GFP (B-2) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used at 1:300 for Western blots. Polyclonal anti-GluR5 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) was used at 1:100 for immunofluorescence and 1:1000 for Western blots. Monoclonal anti-PSD-95 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) and anti-Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used at 1:100,000 and 1:250, respectively, for Western blots. All secondary antibodies conjugated to fluorescein (FITC), phycoerythrin, or rhodamine red-X (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) were used at 1:200 for immunostaining. All secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (BD Biosciences) were used at 1:10,000 for Western blot. Protein Preparation and Immunoblotting—Forty-eight hours after transfection, HEK cells grown in 60-mm culture dishes were washed once with cold TBS and homogenized in 1 ml of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100 in TBS with 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). The samples were then solubilized for 1 h at 4 °C and cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 min. Aliquots of the supernatants were boiled for 5 min in 1× sample buffer and resolved on 8% or 10% SDS-PAGE. Gels were then Western blotted, immunostained, and visualized with Supersignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Biotinylation of Cell Surface Protein—Transfected HEK cells, grown in poly-d-lysine-coated 60-mm culture dishes, were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and incubated 15 min with 1.0 mg/ml EZ-link™ sulfo-N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (NHS)-S-S-biotin (Pierce) in cold PBS, pH 8.0, with gentle agitation at 4 °C. Cells were washed once and incubated with a quenching buffer (192 mm glycine, 25 mm Tris in PBS) for 10 min. Next, cells were rinsed twice in cold PBS, collected, homogenized in lysis buffer, and centrifuged. Supernatants were then incubated with 50 μl of 50% slurry of streptavidin-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were pelleted by brief centrifugation, and aliquots of the supernatant were taken to represent the unbound, intracellular pool. Beads were then washed three times with lysis buffer, and biotinylated proteins were eluted by boiling in 1× sample buffer for 5 min, separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted as above. Immunofluorescence—For selective labeling of surface receptors, transfected live COS7 cells were incubated with appropriate primary antibodies (monoclonal anti-Tac or anti-autofluorescent protein) diluted in DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum for 1 h at 4 °C. The cells were then washed with cold PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 4% sucrose on ice for 20 min. After fixation, cells were washed with PBS and labeled with fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies. Next, cells were permeabilized at room temperature with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Intracellular expression was then determined by sequentially incubating with a second set of primary (polyclonal anti-Tac or anti-GFP) and secondary antibodies. A slightly modified protocol was used for staining transfected hippocampal neurons. Briefly, for surface labeling, cultured live neurons were incubated with anti-Tac diluted in PBS with 5% normal goat serum for 30 min at room temperature, fixed, and incubated with a rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody. To detect intracellular expression, neurons were then permeabilized and sequentially incubated with anti-Tac and FITC-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody diluted in PBS with 10% normal goat serum. Both surface and intracellular expression were visualized on a Axioskop fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) coupled to a CCD camera (Hamamatsu, Hamamatsu City, Japan) and analyzed by OpenLab imaging software (Improvision, Coventry, United Kingdom). Colocalization images were obtained with the permeabilized staining protocol, visualized with a Zeiss LSM410 confocal microscope (Zeiss), and analyzed with Renaissance imaging software (Microcosm, Columbia, MD). Flow-assisted Cytometry—Transfected live HEK293 cells grown in 6-well tissue culture plates were incubated with monoclonal anti-Tac or anti-Myc antibodies diluted in DMEM supplemented with 5% serum for 1hat4 °C. Cells were then washed with PBS and incubated with FITC- or phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies in PBS for 1 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing, cells were detached from the plates with 500 μl of PBS plus 5 mm EDTA, and transferred to 12 × 75-mm polystyrene test tubes (VWR Scientific, South Plainfield, NJ). Finally, 500 μl of 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS was added to fix the cells. Surface expression was quantified using a FACScalibur cell sorter (BD Biosciences). Background fluorescence was determined using mock-transfected HEK293 cells incubated with corresponding primary and secondary antibodies. Mean fluorescence intensity was acquired and plotted with Prism4.0 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). In Vitro Deglycosylation—Transfected HEK cells grown in 35-mm dishes were washed with ice-cold TBS and homogenized in 1 ml lysis buffer (0.1% SDS, 5% deoxycholate and 1% Nonidet P-40 in TBS, plus 2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml chemostatin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 8.0). After brief sonication and centrifugation (14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C), the supernatants were collected. 6 μl of Denature Buffer (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) was added to 54 μl of cell lysate. The samples were then boiled for 10 min, divided into thirds, and treated with 500 units of peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F; New England Biolabs), 500 units of endoglycosidase H (endo H; New England Biolabs), or no enzyme for 5 h at 37 °C. After incubation, samples were boiled for 5 min in 1× sample buffer, resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted as described. Kinase Activation Experiments—HEK cells transfected with Tac-G5/2b were treated with (a) 100 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in Me2SO for 30 min, washed with fresh media, and allowed to recover at 37 °C for 3 h; (b) 50 μm forskolin together with 10 μm phosphodiesterase inhibitor, isobutylmethylxanthine, in Me2SO for 2 h; or (c) Me2SO only. Cells were then examined for surface expression as by flow-assisted cytometry (FAC) analysis. Transfected COS cells were treated similarly; surface and intracellular expression of the receptors were then examined by live immunostaining as described. All experiments were done in a blind manner. Electrophysiology—HEK293 cells were plated on glass coverslips coated with 100 μg/ml collagen and poly-d-lysine. The following day, cells were transfected with plasmids containing the wild type or mutant GFP-GluR5–2b (0.2 μg/coverslip) using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent according to the instructions from the manufacturer. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were made with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) 2–3 days after transfection. The external bath solution contained 150 mm NaCl, 2.8 mm KCl, 10 mm glucose, 2 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH was adjusted to 7.3 with NaOH). The internal solution was composed of 110 mm CsF, 30 mm CsCl, 4 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 5 mm EGTA (adjusted to pH 7.3 with CsOH). For rapid agonist application, cells were lifted from the coverslip into a laminar solution stream exiting a three-barrel glass pipette (Vitro Dynamics, Rockaway, NJ) pulled to an internal barrel diameter of ∼80 μm and mounted on a piezo-ceramic bimorph. The solution stream was rapidly moved across the transfected cells by applying voltage to the bimorph with a stimulation-isolation unit triggered by a digital signal from pClamp 8 software. Data were acquired and analyzed using pClamp 8 software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) and Origin 6.0 (OriginLab Corp., Northampton, MA). GluR5–2b C-terminal Domain Contains an Intracellular Retention Signal—The distinct C-terminal sequences of GluR5 splice variants (Fig. 1A) are known to be responsible for their differential interactions with intracellular scaffolding molecules (12Hirbec H. Francis J.C. Lauri S.E. Braithwaite S.P. Coussen F. Mulle C. Dev K.K. Coutinho V. Meyer G. Isaac J.T. Collingridge G.L. Henley J.M. Neuron. 2003; 37: 625-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), however their roles in receptor trafficking remain unexplored. To facilitate the search for potential trafficking signals in these alternatively spliced C termini and to avoid the complication of assembly with native subunits in neurons, we constructed chimeric receptors consisting of the N-terminal and transmembrane domains of the human interleukin-2 receptor α subunit (Tac), and the C terminus of either GluR5–2a or GluR5–2b (designated Tac-G5/2a and Tac-G5/2b, respectively) (Fig. 1A). The expression profiles of the Tac-G5 chimeras and Tac alone were then examined in HEK cells with a biotinylation method using sulfo-NHS-S-S-biotin. Because this modified biotin is membrane-impermeable, it only binds to surface proteins, which can then be separated from the intracellular pool by conjugation with streptavidin beads and visualized by Western blotting. Using this method, we observed strong surface expression of Tac and Tac-G5/2a (Fig. 1B), whereas Tac-G5/2b signal could not be detected on the plasma membrane, despite its robust intracellular expression (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, the intracellular Tac was present as both a high molecular mass (55 kDa) and a low molecular mass (45 kDa) form (Fig. 1B), but only the high molecular mass species was detected in the biotinylated surface fraction (Fig. 1B). This is consistent with previous studies demonstrating that Tac is synthesized as a 45-kDa immature form in the ER and further processed upon transport into the Golgi apparatus, resulting in a shift of molecular mass (13Leonard W.J. Depper J.M. Robb R.J. Waldmann T.A. Greene W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6957-6961Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 14Bonifacino J.S. Suzuki C.K. Klausner R.D. Science. 1990; 247: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The same pattern was also observed for Tac-G5/2a (Fig. 1B), whereas Tac-G5/2b could only be detected as a low molecular mass species (Fig. 1B). The lack of a mature form for Tac-G5/2b suggests that it is unable to exit the early secretory compartments that include ER and ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC). To quantify receptor surface expression, we performed a FAC analysis on HEK293 cells transfected with Tac or Tac-G5 receptors. Cells expressing Tac or Tac-G5/2a had 70-fold higher surface fluorescence compared with that of Tac-G5/2b (Fig. 1C). In all cases, total protein abundance of different receptors was comparable, as revealed by Western blot analyses of whole cell extracts (data not shown). To confirm the intracellular retention of Tac-G5/2b, we employed a live immunofluorescence technique to visualize surface receptors. In agreement with the biotinylation and FAC data, Tac-G5/2b was not found on the plasma membrane, but rather retained intracellularly in a mesh network-like intracellular compartment reminiscent of ER morphology, with most of the staining concentrated in the perinuclear region (Fig. 1D). In contrast, Tac and Tac-G5/2a were readily detectable on the cell surface (Fig. 1D). Finally, to determine whether the intracellular retention of Tac-G5/2b receptor occurs in neurons, we transfected cultured hippocampal neurons with the Tac-G5 chimeras and analyzed their surface expression. As in the HEK and COS cells, Tac-G5/2b was retained inside the neurons, whereas both Tac and Tac-GluR5/2a were efficiently delivered to the neuronal surface (Fig. 1E). Together these data indicate that the C-terminal domain of GluR5–2b contains signal(s) sufficient to confer intracellular retention of Tac receptors in both heterologous cells and neurons. Tac-G5/2b Receptors Are Retained in the ER—The two major intracellular organelles involved in protein biogenesis and trafficking are the ER and Golgi apparatus, both of which have distinctive morphology and unique molecular markers. To determine the precise intracellular location of the retained Tac-G5/2b receptor, we compared its distribution profile with those of the ER and Golgi markers. When expressed in COS7 or NRK cells, Tac-G5/2b colocalized extensively with the ER markers, calnexin and DsRed-ER (Fig. 2A), while showing no overlap with the Golgi proteins, giantin, mannosidase II, and TGN-38 (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, in agreement with the earlier observation that Tac-G5/2b failed to reach the Golgi apparatus for post-translational processing (Fig. 1B), the receptor remained sensitive to endo H (Fig. 2C), an enzyme that preferentially hydrolyzes the high mannose N-glycans present on immature proteins in the ER (15Trimble R.B. Maley F. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 141: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In contrast, Tac and Tac-G5/2a were resistant to endo H (Fig. 2C), indicating that these receptors had been processed in the Golgi, a result consistent with their strong surface expression (Fig. 1, B–E). To ensure that endo H-mediated deglycosylation was selective for Tac-G5/2b, we used PNGase F, a less selective glycosidase that cleaves most asparagine-bound glycans (16Tarentino A.L. Gomez C.M. Plummer Jr., T.H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4665-4671Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). Indeed, all the receptors exhibited increased electrophoretic mobility, indicating PNGase F sensitivity (Fig. 2C). These experiments provide both immunocytochemical and biochemical evidence for the selective ER retention of Tac-G5/2b receptors. Arg-896 Is Critical for the ER Retention of Tac-G5/2b—The C terminus of GluR5–2b contains a number of arginine- and lysine-rich sequences, but no regions that match previously identified ER retention signals. To map the residue(s) conferring ER retention of Tac-G5/2b, we first made a series of deletional mutations (Fig. 3A), based on the positions of these arginine- and lysine-rich sequences, and examined their effects on ER retention. Deletion of the last 10 amino acids (Tac-G5/2bΔ10), but not the last 6 residues (Tac-G5/2bΔ6), effectively released Tac-G5/2b from ER retention in both COS7 cells (Fig. 3B) and hippocampal neurons (Fig. 3C). In contrast to Tac-G5/2b and Tac-G5/2bΔ6, Western blot analyses showed that Tac-G5/2bΔ10 was present as both mature and immature forms, providing biochemical evidence for its egress from ER (Fig. 3D). Quantification of surface expression using FAC indicated that the Tac-G5/2bΔ10 mutant had 35-fold greater surface fluorescence than that of Tac-G5/2b (Fig. 3E). The other two deletion mutants, Tac-G5/2bΔ15 and Tac-G5/2bΔ36, also exhibited robust surface expression (Fig. 3, B, C, and E). Together these results suggest that the ER retention signal(s) is likely embedded in a short sequence, LTCHQRRTQ, in the distal portion of GluR5–2b C terminus. To determine the precise molecular composition of the ER retention signal, each of the 9 residues (LTCHQRRTQ) (Fig. 4A, top panel) was replaced with an alanine. The mutants were then expressed in HEK cells and examined for surface expression using FAC analysis. A robust surface signal was only detected for the R896A mutant (Tac-G5/2b-R896A), whereas other mutations either had no effect (i.e. L891A, T892A, Q895A, T898A, and Q899A) or showed an insignificant increase (C893A, H894A, and R897A) (Fig. 4A, middle panel). Accordingly, no mature form could be detected for any other receptor except the R896A mutant (Fig. 4A, bottom panel). Furthermore, when expressed in COS cells and hippocampal neurons, Tac-G5/2b-R896A showed strong surface expression (Fig. 4B). These data indicate that Arg-896 is essential for the ER retention of the Tac-G5/2b, whereas other residues do not have such a dominant effect. Consistent with this idea, mutating multiple residues surrounding Arg-896 (i.e. CHQRR/AAAAA) did not further enhance surface expression. In addition, replacement of Arg-896 with a lysine residue (Tac-G5/2b-R896K) also resulted in robust surface expression, both in heterologous cells (Fig. 4, A and C) and hippocampal neurons (Fig. 4C). Surface expression of the R896A mutant (Fig. 4A), although robust, was significantly lower than that of the deletion mutants Δ10, Δ15, and Δ36 when tested in para"

https://openalex.org/W2032335304,"In addition to the classical role of protein kinase C (PKC) as a mediator of transmembrane signals initiated at the plasma membrane, there is also significant evidence to suggest that a more sustained PKC activity is necessary for a variety of long term cellular responses. To date, the subcellular localization of PKC during sustained activation has not been extensively studied. We report here that long term activation of PKC (1 h) leads to the selective translocation of classical PKC isoenzymes, α and βII, to a juxtanuclear compartment. Jux-tanuclear translocation of PKC required an intact C1 and C2 domain, and occurred in a microtubule-dependent manner. This juxtanuclear compartment was localized close to the Golgi complex but displayed no overlap with Golgi markers, and was resistant to dispersal with Golgi disrupting agents, brefeldin A and nocodazole. Further characterization revealed that PKCα and βII translocated to a compartment that colocalized with the small GTPase, rab11, which is a marker for the subset of recycling endosomes concentrated around the microtubule-organizing center/centrosome. Analysis of the functional consequence of cPKC translocation on membrane recycling demonstrated a cPKC-dependent sequestration of transferrin, a marker of membrane recycling, in the cPKC compartment. These results identify a novel site for cPKC translocation and define a novel function for the sustained activation of PKCα and βII in regulation of recycling components. In addition to the classical role of protein kinase C (PKC) as a mediator of transmembrane signals initiated at the plasma membrane, there is also significant evidence to suggest that a more sustained PKC activity is necessary for a variety of long term cellular responses. To date, the subcellular localization of PKC during sustained activation has not been extensively studied. We report here that long term activation of PKC (1 h) leads to the selective translocation of classical PKC isoenzymes, α and βII, to a juxtanuclear compartment. Jux-tanuclear translocation of PKC required an intact C1 and C2 domain, and occurred in a microtubule-dependent manner.

Currently, PKC consists of 11 distinct isoenzymes grouped into three subfamilies (classical, novel, and atypical) on the basis of lipid cofactor requirements and structural homology (1Ohno S. Nishizuka Y. J. Biochem. 2002; 132: 509-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The first PKC kinases to be identified were the calcium-dependent or classical PKC (cPKC) isoenzymes (α, βI, βII, and γ). Members of this subfamily contain a cysteine-rich zinc finger C1 domain, which is the site of sn-1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) and phorbol ester binding, and a C2 domain which confers calcium-dependent phospholipid binding properties. The novel PKC (nPKC) isoenzymes (δ, ϵ, η, θ) also contain a C1 domain and bind DAG similar to the classical isoenzymes but display calcium independence due to a truncated, non-functional C2 domain. Lipid regulation of the atypical PKC (aPKC) subfamily (λ/ι, ζ) is the most divergent due to a truncated, DAG-insensitive C1 domain and no C2 domain (1Ohno S. Nishizuka Y. J. Biochem. 2002; 132: 509-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 2Newton A.C. Johnson J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 155-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 3Mellor H. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar).A key determinant of cellular PKC activation lies in the ability of individual isoenzymes, especially those of cPKC and less so that of nPKC, to translocate to the plasma membrane in response to DAG and tumor-promoting phorbol esters. At the plasma membrane, PKC becomes fully activated and gains access to specific substrates (4Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2352) Google Scholar). Although this classical model of acute PKC activation (seconds to minutes) stands today as a paradigm for the study of lipid-dependent signal transduction, there is additional biochemical and immunocytochemical evidence to suggest that PKC may translocate to sites other than the plasma membrane (5Mochly-Rosen D. Kauvar L.M. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 44: 91-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Using a variety of PKC agonists, including extracellular agonists and phorbol esters, PKC has been localized to the Golgi complex (6Goodnight J.A. Mischak H. Kolch W. Mushinski J.F. J. Biol.

Characterization of this compartment revealed PKCα and βII translocated to a rab11-positive subset of recycling endosomes found concentrated around the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC)/centrosome.The endosomal recycling compartment consists primarily of a vesiculo-tubular system that carries proteins and lipids to various subcellular destinations, and also serves as a sorting center for lipids and proteins. It is also involved in the recycling of plasma membrane proteins by shuttling those proteins intracellularly and then back to the cell surface (15Mukherjee S. Ghosh R.N. Maxfield F.R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 759-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar). Although PKC has been implicated in receptor desensitization and internalization, little is known regarding the possible roles for PKC in regulating recycling function (16Johnson J.A. Clark R.B.

These results suggest a role for PKC in trapping/sequestering recycling components.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Eagle's minimal essential media, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and HEPES were from Invitrogen.

Transient transfection of DNA (1.5 μg/dish) was performed with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's recommendations. Twelve hours post-transfection, cells were treated and fixed with 3–3.7% paraformaldehyde with or without 10% methanol for 10 min at 37 °C or room temperature. Following fixation, cells were permeabilized with –20 °C 100% methanol for 5 min. The methanol was aspirated, and cells were allowed to air dry (∼5 min). Cells were washed three times with 1.5% FBS/PBS for 5 min each and then blocked in 2.5% FBS for 1 h at room temperature. All primary antibody incubations were performed in 1.5% FBS/PBS with 0.15% saponin at dilutions of 1:50–1:100 for 3 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Following incubation with the primary antibody, cells were washed three times with 1.5% FBS/PBS for 5 min each. Cells were incubated with secondary antibody diluted in 1.5% FBS/PBS and 0.15% saponin at a dilution of 1:50 to 1:100 for 1 h at room temperature.

Twelve hours post-transfection, cells were treated with 100 nm PMA for 1 h at 37 °C to induce the translocation of PKCα to the pericentrion. Following this initial PKC stimulation, cells were then treated with concentrations of either nocodazole (5 μm) or brefeldin A (5 μg/ml) that were previously (23Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G.

All labeling was performed in the presence of complete culture media with 10% FBS.Recycling Assay—Cells were plated onto 35-mm confocal dishes at a density of 2.5–5.0 × 10–5 cells/dish, grown for 24 h, and then were transiently transfected with GFP-PKCα. Twelve hours later, the recycling of membrane components was visualized by chase labeling of transfected cells with 10 μg/ml of unlabelled transferrin for 30 min following a 1 h steady state labeling of cells with 10 μg/ml Alexa Fluor-conjugated transferrin. The steady state labeling and subsequent chase with unlabeled transferrin were performed either in the presence of 0.01% Me2SO or 100 nm PMA. All images represent the average appearance of a minimum of 20 60× fields from 3–5 separate experiments.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONEndogenous and Overexpressed PKC Translocates to a Juxtanuclear Location When Stimulated in a Prolonged Manner— Whereas acute (5–10 min) stimulation of PKC with its agonist 4β-phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) results in translocation of PKC to the plasma membrane, longer PMA treatments (1 h) of Hela cells resulted in the translocation of both endogenous PKCα and GFP-fused PKCα to the plasma membrane and, to a singular, juxtanuclear region (Fig. 1, A and B). The inactive phorbol ester analogue, 4α-phorbol, did not result in translocation of PKC to either the plasma membrane or the juxtanuclear region (Fig. 1C), and translocation of PKCα was not limited to activation by phorbol esters since the non-phorbol PKC activator 7-octylindolactam, was also able to induce translocation of GFP-PKCα to the juxtanuclear region (data not shown).Fig. 1Juxtanuclear translocation of endogenous and GFP-tagged classical PKC isoenzymes in various cell lines.A and B, indirect immunofluorescence of endogenous PKCα and GFP-tagged PKCα in HeLa cells treated with Me2SO alone (0.01%) for 1 h or 100 nm PMA for 10 min and 1 h. Indirect immunofluorescence was performed with anti-PKCα antibody as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Arrows indicate site of juxtanuclear compartment. For overexpression studies, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with GFP-PKCα and 12 h post-transfection were treated with Me2SO alone or 100 nm PMA. C, HeLa cells transiently transfected with GFP-cPKCα were treated 12 h post-transfection with either 100 nm 4-β phorbol or 100 nm 4-α phorbol ester. D, cells were transfected with either GFP-PKCα alone (panel 1) or co-transfected with GFP-PKCα and the PDGF-β receptor (panels 2 and 3). Twelve hours post-transfection, cells were serum-starved for 2 h and then treated with 50 ng/ml PDGF-BB (panels 1 and 3) or untreated (panel 2). E, transient transfection of various cell lines including HEK 293, HT-1080, and DLD-1 with GFP-cPKCα. Cells were treated 12 h post-transfection with 1 h, 100 nm PMA. All fluorescent images were captured on an Olympus Ultra View Spinning Disk Confocal Microscope IX-70, and each panel is representative of a minimum of 20 fields. All experiments were repeated three to five times each with similar results. Bar represents 10.0 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In order to determine if endogenous DAG could also induce this translocation, we employed the PDGF-β receptor, which is known to activate phospholipase D and cause a sustained elevation in endogenous DAG (25Welsh C.J. Schmeichel K. McBride K. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1991; 27A: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 26Plevin R. Cook S.J. Palmer S. Wakelam M.J. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 559-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). A similar juxtanuclear concentration of GFP-PKCα was observed when cells overexpressing the PDGF-β receptor and GFP-PKCα were treated with PDGF-BB for 1 h (Fig. 1D), thus demonstrating that physiologic agonists are capable of inducing this translocation.To investigate whether this juxtanuclear translocation was restricted to HeLa cells, GFP-PKCα was transiently transfected into a variety of other cell lines, and the cells were treated with PMA for 1 h. Juxtanuclear cPKC translocation was observed in several cell lines including HEK 293, HT-1080, DLD-1 (Fig. 1E), CHO, COS-1, and A549 adenocarcinoma cells (data not shown), indicating that translocation of PKC to this site represents an ubiquitous response to sustained activation. Thus, PKCα undergoes translocation to a novel, juxtanuclear location upon prolonged stimulation with various PKC agonists.PKCα and βII Translocate to a Juxtanuclear Compartment—To determine if translocation of PKC to the juxtanuclear compartment was specific to PKCα, representatives of each PKC subfamily (classical, βII; novel, ϵ; atypicals, ζ) were subcloned into GFP vectors and transiently transfected into HeLa cells. Following 1 h exposure to PMA, only GFP-PKCβII was observed to translocate to both the plasma membrane and to the juxtanuclear site (Fig. 2A, panels 1 and 2). The DAG/PMA-sensitive and calcium-independent PKC isoenzyme GFP-PKCϵ was found only at the plasma membrane (Fig. 2B, panels 3 and 4), whereas the DAG-insensitive GFP-PKCζ did not respond to PMA and exhibited no alteration in cytoplasmic localization (Fig. 2C, panels 5 and 6). These data suggest that the translocation of PKC to the juxtanuclear region involves a mechanism that appears restricted to some members of the calcium- and DAG/PMA-sensitive cPKC subfamily.Fig. 2Translocation to the juxtanuclear compartment is specific for PKCα and βII, requires intact C1 and C2 domains, and occurs in a microtubule-dependent manner.A–C, representative isoenzymes from each PKC subfamily (classical, βII; novel, ϵ; atypical, ζ) were subcloned into pEGFP vector and Hela cells were transiently transfected. Twelve hours post-transfection, cells were treated with 100 nm PMA for 1 h. D, transient transfection of HeLa cells with wild-type GFP-PKCβII (panel 1), GFP-PKCβII-mt-C1 (panel 2), isolated GFP-fused C1 domain (panel 3), and GFP-PKCβII-ΔC2 (panel 4). Twelve hours post-transfection cells were treated with 100 nm PMA for 1 h. E, time course of cells transiently transfected with GFP-cPKCβII and stimulated with PMA for the indicated time periods. Panel 5 was preincubated 30 min with 5 μm nocodazole followed by 100 nm PMA. Panel 6 was preincubated 30 min with 5 μm cytochalasin D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Juxtanuclear Translocation of cPKC Requires a C1 and C2 Domain—Members of the classical PKC subfamily are distinguished by the presence of the highly conserved calcium-dependent, acidic phospholipid-binding, C2 domain. To investigate the requirement of the C2 and/or C1 domain in translocation of PKC isoenzymes to the juxtanuclear compartment, a series of cPKC mutants were generated encoding either a mutant of the C1 domain (PKCβII-mtC1) that disrupts binding of DAG/PMA, a full deletion of the C2 domain (PKCβII-ΔC2), and an isolated C1 domain (GFP-C1) of PKCβII. One hour treatment with 100 nm PMA led to the translocation of wild-type GFP-PKCβII to both the plasma membrane and juxtanuclear location, whereas the diffuse cytoplasmic localization of PKCβII-mtC1 remained unchanged following PMA treatment (Fig. 2D, panels 1 and 2). These data demonstrate that PKC translocation to both the plasma membrane and juxtanuclear compartment requires a functional interaction with its agonist at the C1 domain. Importantly, GFP-C1 exhibited translocation to the plasma membrane as has been previously reported (27Oancea E. Teruel M.N. Quest A.F. Meyer T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 485-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) but there was no translocation to the juxtanuclear region evident (Fig. 2D, panel 3). This suggested that C1 domain binding to the phorbol ester alone at the plasma membrane was not sufficient to induce translocation and that translocation to the juxtanuclear compartment requires other conserved domains (e.g. C2 domain) and/or a full-length protein. To that end, similar to the isolated C1 domain, the full length GFP-PKCβII-ΔC2 exhibited translocation to only the plasma membrane (Fig. 2D, panel 4). These results suggest that unlike translocation of PKC to the plasma membrane in response to PMA, wherein a C1 domain is sufficient, translocation to the juxtanuclear compartment requires both the C1 and C2 domains. This requirement for the C2 domain may account for the cPKC subfamily-specific translocation. Of note, in subsequent studies, the PKCα and βII isoforms were found to behave very similarly in parallel experiments, and therefore, for extended investigation we chose to focus on the cPKCα isoenzyme.Translocation of PKC to the Juxtanuclear Compartment Is Dependent upon Microtubules—To investigate the mechanism of cPKC accumulation at the juxtanuclear compartment, a time course was performed with 100 nm PMA. At 5 min PMA, a large percentage of the GFP-tagged PKCα was observed to translocate to the plasma membrane (Fig. 2E, panel 1). Beginning at 15 min of PMA, filamentous structures began to appear in the cytosol and these seemed to radiate from the cell periphery (Fig. 2E, panel 2). At later time points these filaments were observed to coalesce into denser filamentous structures (Fig. 2E, panel 3). At 60 min PMA, PKC was observed localized at both the plasma membrane and at the juxtanuclear compartment with relatively little filaments observed (Fig. 2E, panel 4). The time-dependent appearance of these cytoplasmic filaments suggested the possibility that PKC was translocating to the juxtanuclear compartment in a cytoskeletal-dependent manner. To investigate this further, cells were preincubated with either the actin poison, cytochalasin D (28Miranda A.F. Godman G.C. Tanenbaum S.W. J. Cell Biol. 1974; 62: 406-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), or the microtubule depolymerizing agent nocodazole (24Cole N.B. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) and then treated with PMA for 1 h. As seen in Fig. 2E, panel 5, in the presence of nocodazole, PKC was able to translocate to the plasma membrane but there was no subsequent translocation to the juxtanuclear region. On the other hand, cytochalasin D did not block PKC translocation to the juxtanuclear location but did appear to have an effect on the compartment itself suggesting that actin may be involved in the structure of the compartment (Fig. 2E, panel 6). Taken together, these data suggest that at early time points of stimulation, PKC translocates to the plasma membrane and that this occurs in a microtubule-independent manner. Upon more long term stimulation, PKC then requires microtubules for further translocation to the juxtanuclear compartment.PKCα Translocates to a Singular, Juxtanuclear Location Distinct from the Golgi Complex—In an effort to identify the juxtanuclear compartment to which cPKC translocated, an extensive colocalization study was undertaken. As expected, given that cPKC translocates to a singular location in the center of the cell, the mitochondria-specific dye, MitoTracker, the late endosome/lysosomal-specific dye, LysoTracker, and an ER-targeted protein, pDS-Red-ER, all failed to display any overlap with GFP-PKCα translocated to the juxtanuclear region (data not shown). Translocation of cPKC to a central region of HeLa or HEK 293 cells suggested that under conditions of prolonged stimulation, PKCα may associate with an organelle that can also be found as a single compartment such as the Golgi complex. This was thought to be a strong possibility since the PKCγ isoenzyme was suggested to localize to the golgi complex in the NIH 3T3 cell line following long term activation with PMA (6Goodnight J.A.

However at higher magnification, it was evident that the pattern of cPKC translocation was separable from the Golgi complex (Fig. 3A, panels 4–6). Analysis of the high magnification micrographs revealed that GFP-PKCα translocated to a region of the cell that was surrounded by the Golgi complex but displayed only minimal overlap with that organelle.In order to conclusively rule out any association of PKCα with the Golgi, the Golgi complex was disrupted with 5 μg/ml Brefeldin A (BFA) (23Klausner R.D.

https://openalex.org/W1970872037,"Replication factor C (RFC) is a heteropentameric AAA+ protein clamp loader of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) processivity factor. The prokaryotic homologue, γ complex, is also a heteropentamer, and structural studies show the subunits are arranged in a circle. In this report, Saccharomyces cerevisiae RFC protomers are examined for their interaction with each other and PCNA. The data lead to a model of subunit order around the circle. A characteristic of AAA+ oligomers is the use of bipartite ATP sites in which one subunit supplies a catalytic arginine residue for hydrolysis of ATP bound to the neighboring subunit. We find that the RFC(3/4) complex is a DNA-dependent ATPase, and we use this activity to determine that RFC3 supplies a catalytic arginine to the ATP site of RFC4. This information, combined with the subunit arrangement, defines the composition of the remaining ATP sites. Furthermore, the RFC(2/3) and RFC(3/4) subassemblies bind stably to PCNA, yet neither RFC2 nor RFC4 bind tightly to PCNA, indicating that RFC3 forms a strong contact point to PCNA. The RFC1 subunit also binds PCNA tightly, and we identify two hydrophobic residues in RFC1 that are important for this interaction. Therefore, at least two subunits in RFC make strong contacts with PCNA, unlike the Escherichia coli γ complex in which only one subunit makes strong contact with the β clamp. Multiple strong contact points to PCNA may reflect the extra demands of loading the PCNA trimeric ring onto DNA compared with the dimeric β ring.

Replicases of cellular chromosomes utilize a circular sliding clamp protein that encircles DNA and tethers the polymerase to the template for high processivity in DNA synthesis (1.Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 171-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). An example of this protein class is the Escherichia coli β subunit, which confers high processivity onto the chromosomal replicase, DNA polymerase III holoenzyme (2.Stukenberg P.T.

The eukaryotic clamp loader is the heteropentameric replication factor C (RFC). The five subunits of RFC are each different proteins, but they are homologous to one another (6.Cullmann G. Fien K.

Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The recent crystal structure of E. coli γ complex, the prokaryotic counterpart of RFC, has facilitated detailed hypothesis regarding RFC structure and mechanism (9.O'Donnell M. Jeruzalmi D. Kuriyan J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R935-R946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 10.Jeruzalmi D. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2001; 106: 429-441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The γ complex (γ3δδ′χΨ) consists of a minimal core of five proteins (γ3δδ′), which contain the clamp loading activity (11.Onrust R. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11766-11772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The remaining two subunits, χ and Ψ, are involved in recruiting an RNA primed DNA site from the primase, and they bind single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) to assist polymerase elongation but are not essential to the clamp loading activity of γ complex (12.Glover B.P.

Cell. 2001; 106: 429-441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) and δ-β1 complex (18.Jeruzalmi D. Yurieva O. Zhao Y. Young M. Stewart J. Hingorani M. O'Donnell M.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 771-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), reveal a highly detailed view of γ3δδ′ clamp loader form and function. The five subunits of the γ3δδ′ complex are arranged in a circular formation (see Fig. 1). Like RFC, the γ3, δ, and δ′ subunits are members of the AAA+ family; they share a characteristic chain-folding pattern consisting of three domains each. The main intersubunit contacts in the heteropentamer are made via the C-terminal domains, which form a tight circular collar (Fig. 1A, top view). The N-terminal domains contain the ATP binding sites, and there is a gap between the N-terminal domains of the δ and δ′ subunits (Fig. 1A, front view). Only the γ subunits contain ATP binding and hydrolysis activity and therefore serve as the motor of this machine; both δ and δ′ lack a consensus ATP binding sequence, and neither of them bind ATP. The γ and δ′ subunits contain an SRC motif that is highly conserved from γ complex to RFC (20.Guenther B. Onrust R. Sali A. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1997; 91: 335-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The arginine residue (Arg finger) within the SRC motif is positioned such that it may participate in hydrolysis of ATP bound to the neighboring subunit (Fig. 1A, back view). Hence, the Arg finger within the δ′ SRC motif functions with ATP bound to γ1 (site 1), the γ1 SRC functions with ATP bound to γ2 (site 2), and the γ2 SRC functions with ATP bound to γ3 (site 3) (see Fig. 1B). Biochemical studies confirm that these conserved Arg residues are catalytic and suggest that ATP must first be hydrolyzed in sites 2 and/or 3 before ATP in site 1 is hydrolyzed (21.Johnson A. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14406-14413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Study of γ complex and its subunits shows that the δ subunit forms the strongest attachment to the β clamp, and in fact can open the ring by itself, leading to unloading of β clamps from closed circular DNA (19.Turner J. Hingorani M.M. Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 771-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The γ trimer can also bind β and unload it, but it is feeble in these actions compared with δ (15.Leu F.P. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47185-47194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Although δ binds β2 tightly, the γ complex does not bind β2 in the absence of ATP, indicating that one or more subunits of γ complex block the δ-to-β2 interaction (22.Naktinis V. Onrust R. Fang L. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13358-13365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). ATP binding to the γ subunits promotes tight interaction between γ complex and β, implying that ATP binding induces a conformation change in γ complex that exposes δ, and presumably γ subunits as well, for interaction with β and opening of the β2 ring. The δ′ subunit appears to be a rigid protein and has been termed the stator, the stationary part of a machine upon which other pieces move (10.Jeruzalmi D. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2001; 106: 429-441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 20.Guenther B. Onrust R. Sali A. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1997; 91: 335-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Results of mutational studies are consistent with the idea that the ATP-induced conformation change of γ complex requires δ′ and that it may serve as a “backboard” to direct the ATP-induced changes in γ complex (23.Indiani C. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; (In press)Google Scholar). The similarities in RFC and γ complex subunit sequences and their common function in loading circular clamps onto DNA suggest that the RFC subunits may also be arranged in a circular fashion like γ3δδ′ (10.Jeruzalmi D. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2001; 106: 429-441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy studies of RFC are consistent with a circular arrangement of RFC subunits (9.O'Donnell M. Jeruzalmi D. Kuriyan J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R935-R946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 24.Shiomi Y. Usukura J. Masamura Y. Takeyasu K. Nakayama Y. Obuse C. Yoshikawa H. Tsurimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14127-14132Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The human RFC1 subunit (p140), like δ, binds to PCNA (25.Fotedar R. Mossi R. Fitzgerald P. Rousselle T. Maga G. Brickner H. Messier H. Kasibhatla S. Hubscher U. Fotedar A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4423-4433Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), leading to the proposal that RFC1 may act to open PCNA just as the δ wrench opens β (9.O'Donnell M. Jeruzalmi D. Kuriyan J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R935-R946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 18.Jeruzalmi D. Yurieva O. Zhao Y. Young M. Stewart J. Hingorani M. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2001; 106: 417-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). RFC5, like δ′, contains an SRC motif, and the putative ATP site deviates from the consensus sequence (GKKT instead of GKT) suggesting that if it can bind ATP, the ATP may not hydrolyze efficiently. These similarities suggest that RFC5 may play a similar role as the δ′ stator. On the basis of the γ3δδ′ structure, it is proposed that the RFC1 (wrench) and RFC5 (stator) subunits may bracket the RFC2, 3, and 4, subunits, which, like γ3, contain both ATP binding and SRC motifs and thus may act as the motor of the RFC clamp loader (9.O'Donnell M. Jeruzalmi D. Kuriyan J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R935-R946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, the order of the RFC2, 3, and 4 subunits within the pentamer and the identity of the subunits that bind RFC5 and RFC1 are not certain. The aim of this study is to define the arrangement of the subunits within the RFC complex and determine which subunits form the major contact(s) to PCNA. The results indicate the arrangement RFC5:RFC2:RFC3 RFC4:RFC1, and in an orientation looking down the C-terminal plane, RFC5 contributes an arginine finger (SRC) to ATP in RFC2 (site 1), RFC2 contributes an arginine finger to the RFC3 ATP site (site 2), RFC3 contributes an arginine finger to the ATP site in RFC4 (site 3), and RFC4 contributes an arginine finger to the RFC1 ATP site (site 4). Moreover, we find that the RFC(3/4) complex, RFC(2/3) complex, and RFC1 subunit form major contacts to PCNA, unlike the case of the single major contact between δ subunit of γ complex and the β clamp. Radioactive nucleotides were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Unlabeled deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates were supplied by Amersham Biosciences. DNA modification enzymes were supplied by New England Biolabs; DNA oligonucleotides were from Integrated DNA Technologies. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad Protein stain and bovine serum albumin as a standard. Buffer A is 30 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA (pH 7.5), 1 mm DTT, and 0.04% Bio-Lyte 3/10 ampholyte (Bio-Rad). Buffer B is 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 2 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, and 200 mm NaCl. Buffer C is 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 mm DTT, 10 mm magnesium acetate, and 60 mm NaCl. Buffer D is 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm DTT, 0.1 m EDTA, 40 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 8 mm MgCl2, 4% glycerol, and 0.5 mm ATP. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae RFC genes were cloned into either pET (Novagen) or pLANT (26.Finkelstein J. Antony E. Hingorani M.M. O'Donnell M. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 319: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) vectors. The plasmids containing single genes include pET(11a)-RFC(1), pET(11a)-RFC(2), pLANT (2)-RFC(2), pET(11a)RFC(3), pET(11a)-RFC(4), and pET(11a)-RFC(5). Expression plasmids containing two or more genes include pET(11a)-RFC[3+4], pLANT (2)RFC[1+5], pET(11a)-RFC[2+3+4], and pET(11a)-RFC[1+2+3+4+5]. Mutations in the RFC1 Gene—Codons TAT and TTC in pET(11a)RFC(1) corresponding to residues Tyr-404 and Phe-405 in RFC1 were mutated to GCT and GCC, respectively, by Commonwealth Biotechnologies, changing both hydrophobic residues to alanine. The mutated RFC(1) gene was then cloned into the pLANT (2)-RFC[1+5] to replace the wild-type copy of the RFC(1) gene Mutations in the RFC3 and RFC4 Genes—Mutations were introduced into the RFC(3) and RFC(4) genes using the QuikChange method (Stratagene). RFC[3SAC] was generated in pET(11a)-RFC(3) using the following oligonucleotides: 5′-CAT AAA CTT ACA CT GCG TTA TTG AGC GCT TGC ACG AGA TTC AGA TTT CAG CCC TTG-3′ and 5′-CAA GGG CTG AAA TCT GAA TCT CGT GCA AGC GCT CAA TAA CGC AGG TGT AAG TTT ATG-3′. RFC[4SAC] was generated in pET(11a)RFC(4) using the following oligonucleotides: 5′-CAA GAT CAT TGA GCC GCT GCA AAG CGC TTG TGC GAT TTT GAG GTA TTC TAA AC-3′ and 5′-GTT TAG AAT ACC TCA AAA TCG CAC AAG CG TTT GCA GCG GCT CAA TGA TCT TG-3′. The entire open reading frames were then confirmed by DNA sequencing. Mutant genes were cloned into pET(11a)-RFC[3+4] as follows: the RFC[3SAC] gene was exchanged for the wild-type RFC(3) gene in the pET(11a)-RFC[3+4] plasmid using KpnI. Recombinants were screened with Afe and MfeI/ApaI restriction digest was performed to confirm the proper orientation of the insert. The RFC[4SAC] gene was exchanged for the wild-type RFC(4) gene in the pET(11a)-RFC[3+4] plasmid using AflII/GstBI; recombinants were screened using AfeI. The pET(11a)-RFC derived expression plasmids were transformed into BL21(DE3) codon plus (Stratagene) E. coli cells, which contain a secondary plasmid encoding genes for rare transfer RNAs, as well as chloramphenicol resistance. Transformants were selected using ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (25 μg/ml). Co-transformations involving pLANT (2.Stukenberg P.T. Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11328-11334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and pET(11a)–derived plasmids were performed with BLR(DE3) (Novagen) E. coli-competent cells. These transformants were selected using ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and kanamycin (50 μg/ml). Fresh transformants were grown in 12–24 liters of LB media containing the appropriate antibiotics at 30 °C until reaching an A600 value of 0.6. The cultures were then briefly chilled on ice before adding 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and then were incubated at 15 °C for ∼18 h. For RFC(2/3) and RFC(2/5), induction was at 37 °C for 3 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation. Purification of S. cerevisiae RFC1mut and RFCwt Complex—RFCwt was overexpressed from the single plasmid, pET(11a)-RFC[1+2+3+4+5]. The RFC1mut was expressed by co-transformation of pLANT (2)-RFC[1mut+5] and pET(11a)-RFC[2+3+4]. The harvested cells (from 24 liters of culture) were resuspended in ∼200 ml of Buffer A containing 1 m NaCl and then lysed using a French press at 22,000 p.s.i. The cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation, diluted with Buffer A to ∼150 mm NaCl, and then applied to a 30-ml SP-Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated with Buffer A containing 150 mm NaCl. The column was eluted with a 300-ml gradient of 150–600 mm NaCl in Buffer A. Presence of proteins was followed in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels stained with Coomassie Blue. The peak of RFC (which eluted at ∼365 mm NaCl) was pooled and diluted with Buffer A to ∼150 mm NaCl. The protein was then applied to a 40 ml Q-Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated with Buffer A containing 150 mm NaCl and eluted with a 400-ml gradient of 150–600 mm NaCl in Buffer A. The fractions containing RFC complex (which eluted at ∼300 mm NaCl) were saved individually and stored at -70 °C. Protein concentration was measured by Bradford assay, and a typical final yield was ∼1 mg purified RFC complex/1 liter of culture. Purification of S. cerevisiae Wild-type and Mutant RFC(3/4) Subcomplexes—RFC(3/4) subcomplexes (wild-type or SAC mutants) were expressed using the pET(11a)-RFC[3+4] plasmid containing either wild-type or mutant genes. The cell pellet (harvested from 12 liters of culture) was resuspended in 200 ml of Buffer A containing 800 mm NaCl, lysed with a French press, and clarified by centrifugation. The clarified cell lysate was diluted with Buffer A to ∼180 mm NaCl before being applied to a 100-ml SP-Sepharose column and eluted with a 1-liter gradient of 150–600 mm NaCl in Buffer A. The peak of RFC(3/4) (which eluted at about 350 mm NaCl) was pooled, diluted with Buffer A to ∼150 mm NaCl, and then applied to a 50-ml Heparin-agarose (Amersham Biosciences) column followed by a 500-ml elution gradient of 150–600 mm NaCl in Buffer A. The peak fractions of RFC(3/4) subcomplex eluted at ∼300 mm NaCl and were stored at -70 °C. The final yields for RFC(3/4) were ∼4 mg of RFC(3/4)wt, 4 mg of RFC(3/4SAC), and 15 mg of RFC(3SAC/4) per liter of cell culture. Purification of S. cerevisiae RFC(2/3) Subcomplex—The RFC(2/3) protein complex was expressed by co-transformation of pLANT (2)RFC(2) and pET(11a)-RFC(3). The clarified cell lysate was diluted to 150 mm NaCl with Buffer A and then purified over a 20-ml SP-Sepharose Fast Flow column with a 200-ml gradient of 300–700 mm NaCl in Buffer A. The peak of RFC(2/3) was pooled and diluted with Buffer A to 100 mm NaCl before being further purified over a 6-ml Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column with a 60-ml gradient of 200–400 mm NaCl in Buffer A. The purified protein was dialyzed against Buffer A containing 100 mm NaCl before being stored at -70 °C. The yield was ∼1 mg RFC(2/3) per liter of cell culture. Purification of S. cerevisiae RFC(2/5) Subcomplex—The RFC(2/5) subcomplex was coexpressed upon co-transformation of pLANT (2)RFC(2) and pET(11a)-RFC(5). The purification protocol for this subcomplex is the same as for the RFC(2/3) complex (refer to above), except that a 150–600 mm NaCl gradient in Buffer A was used with the SPSepharose Fast Flow column, and a 100–450 mm NaCl gradient in Buffer A was used with the Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column. Yield was also ∼1 mg of RFC(2/5) per liter of cell culture. Purification of S. cerevisiae RFC2 Protein—The individual subunit, RFC2, was expressed from the pET(11a)-RFC2 plasmid. The cells were lysed and then the lysate was clarified and diluted to 180 mm NaCl as described above for RFC complex purification. The protein was first fractionated over a 100-ml SP-Sepharose Fast Flow column with a 1-liter gradient of 150–600 mm NaCl in Buffer A. The peak of RFC2 (which eluted at about 300 mm NaCl) was pooled and diluted with Buffer A to ∼200 mm NaCl, before being applied to a 50-ml Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column. The flow through fraction containing RFC2 was precipitated by addition of ammonium sulfate (0.5 g/ml). After centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in Buffer A and dialyzed against Buffer A containing 250 mm NaCl at 4 °C overnight. The yield of protein was ∼4 mg of RFC2 per liter of cell culture. Trace contaminants containing ATPase activity were separated away from the RFC(2) protein by gel filtration. Approximately, 700 μg of RFC2 protein was applied to a 24-ml Superdex-75 (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated with Buffer A containing 200 mm NaCl. After collecting 240 drops (6.1 ml), 5-drop (120 μl) fractions were collected (79 fractions). Aliquots (3 μl) from every other fraction were assayed for ATPase activity (refer to protocol below), and 16-μl aliquots from the same fractions were analyzed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. ATPase activity was detected in fractions 17–27, whereas RFC2 protein was present in fractions 25–37. RFC2 free from contaminating ATPase activity (fractions 29–37) was used in the ATPase assays reported in this study. Purification of S. cerevisiae RFC4 Protein—Expression of RFC(3/4) subcomplex from the pET(11a)-RFC[3+4] plasmid results in the production of excess soluble RFC4 protein. Clarified cell lysate was diluted to ∼100 mm NaCl with Buffer A before being fractionated over an 18-ml SP-Sepharose Fast Flow column with a 180-ml gradient of 100–500 mm NaCl in Buffer A. Fractions containing both RFC(3/4) and excess RFC4 were pooled and dialyzed for 2 h against Buffer A until the conductivity was approximately equal to 50 mm NaCl. The protein was then applied to a 7-ml Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column and washed with 50 ml of Buffer A. Pure RFC4 eluted in the wash. Yield was ∼1 mg RFC4 per liter of cell culture. Wild-type and mutant RFC(3/4) subcomplexes were tested for ATPase activity in the presence or absence of a synthetic primed template. The primed template was formed by mixing the following two oligonucleotides: 79-mer, 5′-GGG TAG CAT ATG CTT CCC GAA TTC ACT GGC CGT CGT TTT ACA ACG TCG TGA CTG GGA AAA CCC TGG CGT TAC CCA ACT T-3′; and 45-mer, 5′-GGG TTT TCC CAG TCA CGA CGT TGT AAA ACG ACG GCC AGT GAA TTC-3′. The 79-mer (800 pmols) and 45-mer (2.4 nmol) were mixed in 100 μlof5mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, and 15 mm sodium citrate (final pH 8.5). The mixture was brought to 95 °C and then cooled to room temperature over a 30-min interval. The ATPase reactions contained 2 μm RFC(3/4), 2 mm [α-32P]ATP, 500 nm primed template (when present), and 2 μm RFC2 (when present) in a final volume of 70 μl of Buffer C. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C, and 10-μl aliquots were removed at intervals (0 to 4 min) and quenched with an equal volume of 5% SDS/40 mm EDTA mixture. One microliter of each quenched reaction was spotted on a polyethyleneimine cellulose TLC sheet (EM Science) and developed in 1 m formic acid/0.5 m lithium chloride buffer. After the TLC sheet was dried, [α-32P]ATP and [α-32P]ADP were quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and the ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Gel filtration was performed at 4 °C using a 24-ml Superdex-200 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in Buffer B. Subunit mixtures (protein concentrations indicated in the figure legends) were incubated at 16 °C for 15 min in 250 μl Buffer B and, when present, included 1 μm ATP, 8 mm MgCl2, and 6.5 μm PCNA (as trimer). Subunit mixtures were applied to the column, and after collecting the first 5.6 ml (void volume), fractions of 180 μl were collected. Column fractions were analyzed in 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels stained with Coomassie Blue. Bovine serum albumin (Sigma) (66 kDa) was added to the protein mixtures to serve as an internal molecular mass marker for each gel filtration analysis. The fraction numbers were normalized to the 66-kDa standard, which was set at peak fraction 49. Steady-state fluorescence intensity measurements were performed using a PTI spectrofluorimeter (Photon Technology International). Fluorescence emission spectra were obtained from 500 to 600 nm using an excitation wavelength of 490 nm. The band-pass for excitation and emission was 2 and 4, respectively. All samples were in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 8 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, and 150 mm NaCl, as indicated. Fluorescent measurements utilized PCNA labeled at its two exposed Cys residues (22 and 62) with Oregon Green 488 maleimide (Molecular Probes). Measurements were performed at 100 nm, 200 nm, or 1 μm PCNA3 and increasing amounts of RFCwt or RFC1mut. The primer-template was prepared by annealing a synthetic DNA 30-mer oligonucleotide (M13mp18 map position 6815–6847) to M13mp18 ssDNA as described (2.Stukenberg P.T. Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11328-11334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The large subunit of Pol δ used in this assay was a truncated version of the full-length protein; it contained the N-terminal 807 amino acids (from a total of 1098 amino acids in the full-length Pol δ) and an additional 14 amino acids (LRDPLIISPKRNHV). The gene for this subunit of Pol δ was cloned into a pET(11a) vector, along with the other two subunits of Pol δ holoenzyme. Induced cell lysate was fractionated over a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column. The enzyme activity required the presence of both PCNA and yeast RFC and had a specific activity of ∼1.0 fmol dNTP incorporated per μg of protein per min. Assays contained 14.1 fmol of primed ssDNA, 3.55 pmol of E. coli SSB, 60 μm deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dGTP, dCTP, dATP), and 20 μm [α-32P]TTP in 12.5 μl of Buffer E. First, 50 fmol of RFC and PCNA (ranging from 25 fmol to 2.5 pmol) were incubated together at 30 °C for 5 min and then 1 μl of recombinant yeast Pol δ was added to initiate replication. After 5 min at 30 °C, the reaction was quenched with an equal volume of 40 mm EDTA/1% SDS and then spotted onto DE81 paper followed by quantitation of DNA synthesis by scintillation counting as described (2.Stukenberg P.T. Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11328-11334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have reported previously a compatible two-vector expression plasmid system for coexpression of multiple proteins in E. coli (26.Finkelstein J. Antony E. Hingorani M.M. O'Donnell M. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 319: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In that study we described the expression and purification of five-subunit yeast RFC in which an unessential N-terminal region of RFC1 is deleted. In the current study we express and purify RFC in which all subunits are full-length and unmodified. The earlier study indicated that expression of individual RFC subunits provided only insoluble protein. In the current study we coexpress two subunits at a time and find that three heterodimeric RFC subcomplexes are soluble and can be purified. In fact, during preparation of an RFC(3/4) complex, isolated RFC4 is also obtained from one of the purification steps. Moreover, we find that RFC2 expression results in some RFC2 that remains soluble and can be purified as an isolated subunit. In the experiments to follow, these subunit preparations are used to examine the architecture of RFC and its interactions with PCNA.

Here we show up-regulation of mouse mast cell protease-7 (mMCP-7), which is expressed in differentiated mast cells, by activin A and TGF-β1 in BMCMCs, and the molecular mechanism of the gene induction of mmcp-7. Smad3, a signal mediator of the activin/TGF-β pathway, transcriptionally activated mmcp-7. Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), a tissue-specific transcription factor predominantly expressed in mast cells, melanocytes, and heart and skeletal muscle, inhibited Smad3-mediated mmcp-7 transcription. MITF associated with Smad3, and the C terminus of MITF and the MH1 and linker region of Smad3 were required for this association. Complex formation between Smad3 and MITF was neither necessary nor sufficient for the inhibition of Smad3 signaling by MITF. MITF inhibited the transcriptional activation induced by the MH2 domain of Smad3. In addition, MITF-truncated N-terminal amino acids could associate with Smad3 but did not inhibit Smad3-mediated transcription. The level of Smad3 was decreased by co-expression of MITF but not of dominant-negative MITF, which resulted from proteasomal protein degradation. The changes in the level of Smad3 protein were paralleled by those in Smad3-mediated signaling activity. These findings suggest that MITF negatively regulates Smad-dependent activin/TGF-β signaling in a tissue-specific manner.

Mast cells play a crucial role in inflammatory and immediate allergic responses. The multivalent binding of an antigen to receptor-bound IgE provides the trigger for activation of mast cells, leading to secretion of granules containing mast cell proteases (MCPs) 1The abbreviations used are: MCPsmast cell proteasesmMCPsmouse MCPsTGF-βtransforming growth factor-βMITFmicrophthalmia-associated transcription factorSCFstem cell factorBMCMCsbone marrow-derived cultured mast cell progenitorsbHLHLZbasic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipperRT-PCRreverse transcriptase-PCRHAhemagglutininWTwild typeG3PDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenasemmouse.

Immunology. 2002; 105: 375-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Mouse MCP-1, -2, -4, -5, and -9 are chymases, and mMCP-6 and -7 are tryptases (3Miller H.R. Pemberton A.D. Immunology. 2002; 105: 375-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Expression of mMCPs in mast cells varies between tissues, e.g. mmcp-7 mRNA is present in differentiated mast cells of the skin but not in mast cells of the intestinal mucosa (4McNeil H.P. Reynolds D.S. Schiller V. Ghildyal N. Gurley D.S. Austen K.F. Stevens R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11174-11178Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), whereas mmcp-2 mRNA is expressed in mast cells located in the mucosa of the stomach (5Jippo T. Tsujino K. Kim H.M. Kim D.K. Lee Y.M. Nawa Y. Kitamura Y. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 150: 1373-1382PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest that gene expression of mMCPs is regulated by the local environment (6Kitamura Y. Morii E. Jippo T. Ito A. Int. J. Hematol. 2000; 71: 197-202PubMed Google Scholar), but currently little information is available on regulation of mMCP expression by local growth and differentiation factors (6Kitamura Y. Morii E.

Activin and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) are members of the TGF-β superfamily and are multipotent growth and differentiation factors (7Mathews L.S. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 310-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 8Luisi S. Florio P. Reis F.M. Petraglia F. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 2001; 145: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). These peptides are not only among the most potent cellular growth inhibitors, but they also regulate other diverse biological processes including early embryonic patterning and cell fate determination. Activin and TGF-β bind to two different types of serine/threonine kinase receptors, termed type I and type II. Type I receptor is activated by type II receptor upon ligand binding and mediates specific intracellular signals. Smads are the central signal mediators of the TGF-β superfamily (9Massagué J. Chen Y.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 627-644PubMed Google Scholar, 10Moustakas A. Souchelnytskyi S. Heldin C.H. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4359-4369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Smad2 and -3 directly interact with type I receptors for activin and TGF-β and become activated through phosphorylation of the C-terminal SSXS motif. Smad2 and -3 then form heteromeric complexes with common partner Smad, Smad4, and translocate into the nucleus. Nuclear Smad complexes bind to transcriptional activators or co-repressors and regulate transcription of target genes (9Massagué J. Chen Y.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 627-644PubMed Google Scholar, 10Moustakas A. Souchelnytskyi S. Heldin C.H. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4359-4369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that expression of activin A, a homodimer of inhibin/activin βA, is up-regulated in immune cells, including monocytes (8Luisi S. Florio P. Reis F.M. Petraglia F. Eur. J.

Signal. 2003; 15: 605-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), in response to activation. Activin A induced migration of human monocytes (14Petraglia F. Sacerdote P. Cossarizza A. Angioni S.

Mathews L.S. Mizutani T. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2997-3003Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Furthermore, activin A and TGF-β1 also induced migration at lower concentrations and morphological changes and gene expression of mmcp-1 at higher concentrations in mouse mast cell progenitors (15Miller H.R. Wright S.H. Knight P.A. Thornton E.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 3473-3486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Funaba M. Ikeda T. Ogawa K. Murakami M. Abe M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2003; 73: 793-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that activin and TGF-β up-regulate the mmcp-7 gene, which is transcriptionally regulated. Smad3 but not Smad2 is responsible for the transcriptional activation. Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), which is a tissue-specific transcription factor predominantly expressed in mast cells, melanocytes, and heart and skeletal muscle (17Hodgkinson C.A.

As a result, the Smad3-mediated transcription is inhibited in the presence of MITF. Our results suggest that the tissue-specific and negative regulation of Smad3 activity by MITF plays a role in the discrete control of activin and TGF-β activities in mast cells.

Cell Culture and Transfection—Bone marrow-derived cultured mast cell progenitors (BMCMCs) were cultured from the bone marrow cells of BALB/c mice as described previously (16Funaba M. Ikeda T. Ogawa K. Murakami M. Abe M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2003; 73: 793-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). More than 95% of the trypan blue-excluding viable cells were mast cells on the basis of staining with acid toluidine. L17 cells, a derivative of the mink lung epithelial cell line (Mv1Lu) (35Attisano L. Carcamo J. Ventura F. Weis F.M. Massagué J. Wrana J.L.

HepG2, COS7, and HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. NIH3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% calf serum. For transient transfection, cells in 24- or 6-well plates were transfected using PolyFect transfection reagent (Qiagen). RNA Isolation, Competitive RT-PCR—Total RNA from BMCMCs was isolated using an RNA isolation kit (RNeasy, Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Recovered RNA was reverse-transcribed as described previously (12Ogawa K. Funaba M. Mathews L.S. Mizutani T. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2997-3003Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To examine the mRNA levels semi-quantitatively, competitive RT-PCR was performed as described previously (16Funaba M. Ikeda T. Ogawa K. Murakami M. Abe M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2003; 73: 793-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For the mmcp-7 gene transcript (GenBank™ accession number NM031187), oligonucleotides encoding positions from 177 to 198 and 812 to 789 were used as the PCR primers. A competitor for mMCP-7 was made by a deletional mutation of the mMCP-7 PCR product, which deleted a cDNA segment between positions 199 and 493. The competitor was made by overlap extension PCR of the native PCR product, followed by purification using a Suprec-02 column (Takara, Tokyo, Japan). The PCR primers and competitor for G3PDH were as described previously (12Ogawa K. Funaba M. Mathews L.S. Mizutani T. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2997-3003Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A constant amount (2 × 10-5 amol for mMCP-7 and 5 × 10-4 amol for G3PDH) of the competitor template was co-amplified with the specific primers with reverse-transcribed samples or varying amounts of the target cDNA standard. The PCR products were separated on 2% agarose gels in 1× TAE buffer and visualized with ethidium bromide. Real Time Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA from BMCMCs was reverse-transcribed as described previously (12Ogawa K. Funaba M. Mathews L.S. Mizutani T. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2997-3003Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). PCR was performed in a total volume of 25 μl with SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), 2 μl of cDNA, and 200 nm of each primer. PCR primers were designed with the computer program Primer Express (Applied Biosystems), using parameters recommended by the manufacturer. For the mmcp-7 and g3pdh gene transcripts (GenBank™ accession numbers NM031187 and M32599, respectively), oligonucleotides encoding positions from 361 to 379 and 425 to 404 for mMCP-7 and those from 740 to 759 and 812 to 789 for G3PDH were used as the PCR primers. Reactions were carried out in an ABI-prism 7700 sequence detector (Applied Biosystems), using the following conditions: an initial denaturation step consisted of 2 min at 50 °C and 10 min at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C. Levels of mMCP-7 and G3PDH expression in each sample were determined by using the relative standard curve method. A relative amount of DNA of mMCP-7 was expressed as a ratio to G3PDH DNA, and the mMCP-7 level in BMCMCs without TGF-β1, activin A, and SCF was 1. Reporter Assay—Luciferase assays were conducted as described previously (36Funaba M. Mathews L.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1583-1591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Funaba M. Zimmerman C.M.

Cells were transiently transfected with the indicated expression vectors, reporter construct, or a plasmid expressing β-galactosidase (pCMV-βGal). Equal amounts of DNA were transfected in each experiment and adjusted with pcDNA1 and pcDNA3, and cells were harvested 40 h after transfection. Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity, and the luciferase activity in the cell lysate transfected with empty vector was set at 1. Sequential Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot—COS7 cells were transfected with HA-tagged Smad and Myc-tagged MITF. Twenty seven hours after transfection, cells were treated with or without 10 μm lactacystin or 50 μm MG-132 for 16 h. The cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% aprotinin). After 30 min on ice, cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 600 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with anti-HA antibody (12CA5) and incubated with protein G-agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with lysis buffer, followed by elution in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to Western blotting with anti-HA antibody (12CA5) or anti-Myc antibody (9E10) as primary antibody, and the bands were visualized with ECL Plus reagent (Invitrogen). Mammalian Two-hybrid Assay—Mammalian two-hybrid assays were performed using the checkmate mammalian two-hybrid system (Promega), according to the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with the plasmid of interest, a plasmid expressing β-galactosidase (pCMV-βGal). Equal amounts of DNA were transfected in each experiment and adjusted with pBIND or pACT. Twenty seven hours after transfection, cells were treated with or without 10 μm lactacystin for 16 h. Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity, and the luciferase activity in the cell lysate transfected with empty vector was set at 1. Mouse mcp-7 Gene Is Transcriptionally Activated by Smad3—To investigate the effect of activin and TGF-β on BMCMCs, gene transcripts of mmcp-1, -7, and -9 were first examined by RT-PCR, which was conducted under nonsaturating conditions for the PCR products. The band intensities of mMCP-1 and mMCP-7 were reproducibly increased by treatment with activin A or TGF-β1 (data not shown). Activin A- and TGF-β1-induced gene expression of mMCP-1 has been described elsewhere (16Funaba M. Ikeda T. Ogawa K. Murakami M. Abe M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2003; 73: 793-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To characterize mmcp-7 gene induction in response to activin A and TGF-β1 in detail, we semi-quantitatively measured levels of mmcp-7 gene transcript by competitive RT-PCR. Treatment of BMCMCs with activin A or TGF-β1 for 24 h clearly increased the gene transcript level of mmcp-7 (Fig. 1A). Consistent with a previous study (38Gu Y. Byrne M.C. Paranavitana N.C. Aronow B. Siefring J.E. D'Souza M. Horton H.F. Quilliam L.A. Williams D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7645-7657Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), treatment with SCF also increased the mRNA level of mmcp-7. Co-treatment with SCF and activin A or TGF-β1 resulted in further accumulation of mmcp-7 mRNA (Fig. 1A). Real time quantitative RT-PCR analyses also revealed the stimulatory effect of activin A and TGF-β1 on mmcp-7 gene transcript (Fig. 1B). To examine whether the mmcp-7 gene induction by activin A and TGF-β1 is transcriptionally regulated, we performed transcriptional activation assays using the 5′-flanking region of mmcp-7 fused to the luciferase reporter gene (25Ogihara H. Morii E. Kim D.K. Oboki K. Kitamura Y. Blood. 2001; 97: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, transfection of type II (TβRII) and type I (ALK5) TGF-β receptor into HepG2 cells did not affect luciferase expression, whereas transfection of a constitutively active type I TGF-β receptor (ALK5(TD)) (31Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Massagué J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2199-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar) increased luciferase expression 5.6-fold. Consistent with expression of a series of TGF-β receptor isoforms, expression of a constitutively active type I activin receptor (ALK4(TE)) (21Willis S.A. Zimmerman C.M. Li L. Mathews L.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 367-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) but not of a type II (ActRII) or type I (ALK4) activin receptor increased luciferase expression 6.3-fold. Transcriptional assays in NIH3T3 cells and L17 cells, a derivative of mink lung epithelial cells (35Attisano L. Carcamo J. Ventura F. Weis F.M. Massagué J. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1993; 75: 671-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar), also showed increased luciferase expression only in cells expressing constitutively active type I receptors (ALK5(TD) and ALK4(TE)) (Fig. 2, B and C). These results suggest that TGF-β- and activin-induced mmcp-7 mRNA is transcriptionally regulated and that the receptor activation is responsible for transcriptional activation of mmcp-7. When individual Smad proteins were overexpressed in HepG2 cells (Fig. 2D), NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 2E), and L17 cells (Fig. 2F), Smad3, but not Smad2 or -4, increased luciferase expression. Overexpression of a constitutively active Smad3, which replaced the last three Ser to Glu (Smad3–3E) (39Chacko B.M. Qin B. Correia J.J. Lam S.S. de Caestecker M.P. Lin K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), tended to further increase luciferase expression as compared with that of Smad3, whereas overexpression of a constitutively active Smad2 (Smad2–2E) (36Funaba M. Mathews L.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1583-1591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) did not affect luciferase expression. Smad3 Signaling Is Blocked by MITF—MITF is a transcription factor of the basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (bHLHLZ) family, which controls gene expression of several mmcps (6Kitamura Y. Morii E. Jippo T. Ito A. Int. J. Hematol. 2000; 71: 197-202PubMed Google Scholar). The relationship between TGF-β signaling and the effect of MITF on mmcp-7 transcription was explored in HepG2 cells (Fig. 3A), NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 3B), and L17 cells (Fig. 3C). Co-expression of WT-MITF inhibited the luciferase expression induced by ALK5(TD), suggesting that MITF negatively regulates TGF-β-induced transcriptional activation of mmcp-7. Expression of WT-MITF also decreased Smad3-induced transcription of mmcp-7 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A). In contrast, overexpression of mi-MITF, a dominant-negative mutant that deletes one of four consecutive Arg in the basic domain (6Kitamura Y. Morii E. Jippo T. Ito A. Int. J. Hematol. 2000; 71: 197-202PubMed Google Scholar), had a weak effect on inhibition of the induced luciferase expression (Fig. 4A). We also examined the effect of MITF expression on transcriptional activation of AR3-luc, which contains regulatory sequences from the Xenopus mix2 gene (27Hayashi H. Abdollah S. Qiu Y. Cai J. Xu Y.Y. Grinnell B.W. Richardson M.A. Topper J.N. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Wrana J.L. Falb D. Cell. 1997; 89: 1165-1173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar) and is activated by co-expression of the transcription factors FoxH3 and Smad2 (36Funaba M. Mathews L.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1583-1591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Funaba M. Zimmerman C.M. Mathews L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41361-41368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Similar to the inhibitory effect on mmcp-7 transcription, WT-MITF inhibited FoxH3-dependent and Smad2-mediated AR3 transcription, whereas mi-MITF hardly affected transcriptional activity (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that functional MITF acts as a negative regulator for Smad2 and -3 signaling. Transcriptional inhibition of WTMITF was not a nonspecific event, since overexpression of WT-MITF but not mi-MITF increased luciferase expression when the 5′-flanking region of mmcp-6 fused to the luciferase gene was used as a reporter gene (Fig. 4C). In addition, when the 5′-flanking region of mmcp-9 fused to the luciferase gene was used, overexpression of ALK5(TD) and Smad3 neither increased luciferase expression nor affected WT-MITF-induced transcription of mMCP-9-luc (Fig. 4D). MITF has several isoforms. The mouse MITF gene contains at least five isoform-specific first exons, and exons 2–9 of all isoforms of MITF are the same (18Oboki K. Morii E. Kataoka T.R. Jippo T. Kitamura Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 1250-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 40Udono T. Yasumoto K. Takeda K. Amae S. Watanabe K. Saito H. Fuse N. Tachibana M.

Takahashi K. Noda M. Shibahara S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1574: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Two isoforms of MITF, MITF-mc (19Takemoto C.M. Yoon Y.J. Fisher D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30244-30252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and MITF-E (18Oboki K. Morii E. Kataoka T.R. Jippo T. Kitamura Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 1250-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), inhibited Smad3-mediated mMCP-7 transcription and FoxH3-dependent and Smad2-mediated AR3-luc transcription (data not shown). MITF Binds to and Induces Breakdown of Smad Proteins—To explore the molecular basis of the inhibitory effect of MITF on Smad2 and -3 signaling, we examined the expression of Smads in response to co-expression of MITF in COS7 cells. Protein expression levels of Smad2, -3, and -4 were significantly decreased by co-expression of WT-MITF (Fig. 5, A–C). In contrast, mi-MITF hardly affected the protein level of Smad2, -3, or -4. The WT-MITF-induced decreases in Smad protein level were independent of TGF-β signaling; expression of ALK5(TD) had no effect on decreases in Smad2 and -3 when co-expressed with WT-MITF. The decreased protein levels of Smad associated with co-expression of WT-MITF were not nonspecific events, because the protein level of MEK1, a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, was relatively unchanged in response to WT-MITF expression (Fig. 5D). Next, we examined whether the decreased protein levels of Smad2 and -3 due to co-expression of WT-MITF resulted from proteasomal breakdown. Treatment with lactacystin (10 μm), which inhibits activity of 20 S proteasome (42Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar), effectively blocked the decreases in Smad2 and -3 proteins caused by co-expression of WT-MITF, resulting in constant protein levels of Smad2 and -3 irrespective of co-expression of WT-MITF (Fig. 6A). In addition, decreases in protein expression of Smad2 and -3 by co-expression of WT-MITF were also blocked by treatment with another proteasome inhibitor, MG-132 (50 μm) (Fig. 6B). These results suggest that expression of WT-MITF but not mi-MITF induces proteasome-dependent degradation of Smad2 and -3. Smad signaling is modulated by association"

Although the identity of these channels is unknown, there is considerable evidence that the transient receptor potential channel 1 (TRPC1) participates in the formation of these channels. We show that TRPC1 physically interacts with the a-isoform of the inhibitor of the myogenic family (I-mfa), a known inhibitor of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors, in vitro and in vivo. The interaction is mediated by the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of TRPC1 and the C-terminal cysteine-rich domain of I-mfa. Using the whole cell configuration of the patch clamp technique, we show that ectopic expression of I-mfa in CHO-K1 cells reduces native store-activated Ca2+ currents, whereas knock-down of endogenous I-mfa in A431 cells by RNA interference enhances these currents. Pipette perfusion of purified recombinant I-mfa rescues the effect of I-mfa knock-down on store-operated conductance. Finally, cell dialysis with a monoclonal antibody specific to TRPC1 results in the suppression of store-activated conductance in cells lacking I-mfa, but not in I-mfa expressing cells. We propose that I-mfa functions as a molecular switch to suppress the store dependence of TRPC1.

G protein-coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases comprise a very large group of cell surface receptors that elicit their physiological responses through the production of inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate (IP3) 1The abbreviations used are: IP3inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphateIP3Rinositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate receptorTRPC1transient receptor potential 1 of the canonical groupI-mfinhibitor of myogenic familyI-mfaa-isoform of I-mfI-mfbb-isoform of ImfI-mfcc-isoform of I-mfRNAiRNA interferencebHLHbasic helix-loop-helixMBPmaltose-binding proteinGSTglutathione S-transferaseTGthapsigarginHAhemagglutininCHOChinese hamster ovaryECSextracellular solutionF-I-mfaFLAG-tagged I-mfa.1The abbreviations used are: IP3inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphateIP3Rinositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate receptorTRPC1transient receptor potential 1 of the canonical groupI-mfinhibitor of myogenic familyI-mfaa-isoform of I-mfI-mfbb-isoform of ImfI-mfcc-isoform of I-mfRNAiRNA interferencebHLHbasic helix-loop-helixMBPmaltose-binding proteinGSTglutathione S-transferaseTGthapsigarginHAhemagglutininCHOChinese hamster ovaryECSextracellular solutionF-I-mfaFLAG-tagged I-mfa. (1Berridge M.J. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1984; 312: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (4218) Google Scholar). Upon receptor activation, newly synthesized IP3 acts on IP3 receptors (IP3Rs) to trigger a rapid increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration by releasing free Ca2+ from intracellular stores (2Burgess G.M. Godfrey P.P. McKinney J.S. Berridge M.J. Irvine R.F. Putney Jr., J.W. Nature. 1984; 309: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Intracellular Ca2+ concentration returns to normal levels by extrusion of cytoplasmic Ca2+ to the extracellular space by plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase and Na+-Ca2+ exchangers, re-admission of Ca2+ into the endoplasmic reticulum by the SERCA pump, and Ca2+ entry via the store-operated Ca2+ channels (3Fasolato C.

Bioessays. 1999; 21: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Whereas all of these pathways contribute to the maintenance of normal Ca2+ homeostasis, store-operated Ca2+ entry is of particular interest because it is responsible for the regulation of diverse cellular functions (5Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar) ranging from cell proliferation and gene expression in T lymphocytes (6Lewis R.S. Annu. Rev.

Despite intensive investigation, the identity of the store-operated channels and the cellular mechanisms underlying the coupling of store depletion and Ca2+ entry remain elusive (9Clapham D.E. J.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E263-E272Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Mammalian TRPCs have been proposed to function as store-operated channels (11Minke B. Selinger Z. Mol. Neurobiol. 1996; 12: 163-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 12Birnbaumer L. Zhu X. Jiang M. Boulay G. Peyton M. Vannier B. Brown D. Platano D. Sadeghi H. Stefani E. Birnbaumer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15195-15202Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear whether they are store-, receptor-operated (13Clapham D.E. Runnels L.W. Strubing C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar, 14Montell C. Birnbaumer L. Flockerzi V. Cell. 2002; 108: 595-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar), and/or channels serving other functions. TRPC1 was the first mammalian TRP channel cloned (15Zhu X.

U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9652-9656Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar) and there has been considerable evidence to support its role in store-operated Ca2+ entry. First, genetic elimination of TRPC1 by homologous recombination significantly reduces Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ currents in DT40 cells (17Mori Y. Wakamori M. Miyakawa T. Hermosura M. Hara Y. Nishida M. Hirose K. Mizushima A. Kurosaki M. Mori E. Gotoh K. Okada T. Fleig A. Penner R. Iino M. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 673-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Second, TRPC1 knock-down by RNAi reduces store-operated currents in CHO-K1 cells (18Vaca L. Sampieri A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42178-42187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Third, heterologous expression of TRPC1 augments store-operated Ca2+ entry in some cell types including CHO-K1 cells (19Zitt C. Zobel A. Obukhov A.G. Harteneck C. Kalkbrenner F. Luckhoff A. Schultz G. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1189-1196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 20Delmas P. Wanaverbecq N. Abogadie F.C. Mistry M. Brown D.A. Neuron. 2002; 34: 209-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Fourth, TRPC1 is responsible for the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent feedback inhibition of store-operated Ca2+ entry, a hallmark of native store-activated Ca2+ conductance (21Singh B.B. Liu X. Tang J. Zhu M.X. Ambudkar I.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 739-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Fifth, TRPC1 can physically interact with various isoforms of the IP3R (22Lockwich T.P. Liu X. Singh B.B. Jadlowiec J. Weiland S. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol.

Arnould T. Zhu C. Kim E. Walz G. Sukhatme V.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3934-3939Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), both functioning as intracellular Ca2+ release channels activated in response to IP3 (26Thrower E.C. Hagar R.E. Ehrlich B.E. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 580-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 27Koulen P. Cai Y. Geng L. Maeda Y. Nishimura S. Witzgall R. Ehrlich B.E. Somlo S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the conformational coupling model of the store-operated Ca2+ entry by which store-operated channels are gated by Ca2+ release channels via protein-protein interactions (28Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Gill D.L. Cell. 1999; 98: 487-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). In contrast, there are independent functional and biochemical studies showing that TRPC1 does not have channel function by itself, but it is required for the formation of receptorbut not store-activated channel complexes with TRPC4 and TRPC5 (29Strubing C. Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 2001; 29: 645-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 30Hofmann T. Schaefer M. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Proc. Natl.

Chem. 2002; 277: 48303-48310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In addition, when TRPC1 is successfully expressed in CHO-K1 cells it does not reconstitute the properties of the prototypical Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ current extensively studied in hematopoietic cells (19Zitt C. Zobel A. Obukhov A.G. Harteneck C. Kalkbrenner F. Luckhoff A. Schultz G. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1189-1196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 32Clapham D.E. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1069-1072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Although these findings are difficult to reconcile with each other, most of the controversy appears to be because of results obtained from gain-versus loss-of-function experiments. Thus, it has been suggested that as yet unidentified proteins may be required to successfully reconstitute a true store-operated channel containing one or more of the currently known TRPCs (6Lewis R.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 497-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 33Xu X.Z. Li H.S. Guggino W.B. Montell C.

Another possibility is that proteins with inhibitory activity may prevent activation of mammalian TRPCs by store-depletion, similar to the Calliphora vicina TRP homolog (35Harteneck C. Kuchta S.N. Huber A. Paulsen R. Schultz G. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1668-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). It was recently shown that the PDZ containing domain protein, INAD (inactivation no afterpotential D) inhibited the activation of C. vicina TRP by store depletion (35Harteneck C. Kuchta S.N. Huber A. Paulsen R. Schultz G. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1668-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). I-mf is the founding member of a group of related proteins with an unusual cysteine-rich domain (36Thebault S. Mesnard J.M. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2001; 2: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), first identified as an interacting protein with MyoD in a yeast two-hybrid screen. I-mf exists in three isoforms (a, b, and c) produced by alternative splicing (37Chen C.M. Kraut N. Groudine M. Weintraub H. Cell. 1996; 86: 731-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), with each isoform containing a common N-terminal and a variable C-terminal region (a, b, or c) (37Chen C.M. Kraut N. Groudine M. Weintraub H. Cell. 1996; 86: 731-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). All three transcripts encode small cytoplasmic proteins lacking any predicted transmembrane segments or nuclear localization signals (37Chen C.M. Kraut N. Groudine M. Weintraub H. Cell. 1996; 86: 731-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). I-mfa, the a-isoform, inhibits the transcriptional activity of MyoD and other basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors such as myogenin, Myf5, Mash2, and Hand1 by preventing their nuclear localization (37Chen C.M. Kraut N. Groudine M. Weintraub H. Cell. 1996; 86: 731-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 38Kraut N. Snider L. Chen C.M. Tapscott S.J. Groudine M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6276-6288Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). I-mfa has also been shown to function within the Wnt/β-catenin pathway (39Snider L. Thirlwell H. Miller J.R. Moon R.T. Groudine M. Tapscott S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1866-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 40Kusano S. Raab-Traub N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6393-6405Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Specifically, it binds and inhibits the transcriptional activity of the Xenopus HMG box transcription factor XTcf3 (39Snider L. Thirlwell H. Miller J.R. Moon R.T. Groudine M. Tapscott S.J. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2002; 22: 6393-6405Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Consistent with its molecular role as an inhibitor of both the bHLH proteins and canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway, inactivation of the I-mfa gene by homologous recombination in mice resulted in skeletal patterning and placental defects (38Kraut N. Snider L. Chen C.M. Tapscott S.J. Groudine M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6276-6288Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). I-mfa mutant mice on a C57B1/6 background died around E10.5 because of a placental defect associated with a reduced number of trophoblast giant cells, whereas mutant mice on a 129/Sv background survived to adulthood and showed skeletal patterning defects associated with deregulated osteogenic differentiation (38Kraut N. Snider L. Chen C.M. Tapscott S.J. Groudine M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6276-6288Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, the exact mechanisms by which I-mfa mediates its effects during development still remain unknown. In the present study, we have identified and characterized a physical interaction between I-mfa and TRPC1 in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, gain- and loss-of-expression experiments show that I-mfa functions as an inhibitor of store-operated currents by negatively modulating TRPC1 activity. Cell Culture—CHO-K1 and A431 cells were obtained from ATCC and maintained in F-12 (Ham's) supplemented with 0.05% sodium bicarbonate and 10% fetal bovine serum or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum, respectively. Plasmids—F-I-mfa was made by inserting the coding region of human I-mfa downstream of the FLAG epitope in the pCMV5-FLAG vector (Kodak). Mouse myogenin in pCMV-SPORT6 was obtained from Incyte Genetics. The “a-region” of human I-mfa was fused to pMAL-c2 (New England Biolabs) to generate maltose-binding protein (MBP)-I-mfa(a). Portions of the C-terminal (Asp639-Ser750, accession number Z73903) and the N-terminal cytoplasmic region of human TRPC1 (Ser27-Ser306) were cloned in pGEX-3X (Pharmacia) to generate glutathione S-transferase (GST)-TRPC1-C or GST-TRPC1-N, respectively. F-ImfaΔ5 and TRPC1Δ were generated by the introduction of termination codons at positions Ser170 and Arg630 of human I-mfa (accession number NM_005586) and human TRPC1, respectively, by site-directed mutagenesis using QuikChange (Stratagene). All other constructs were described previously (25Tsiokas L. Arnould T. Zhu C. Kim E. Walz G. Sukhatme V.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3934-3939Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Production of Polyclonal Antibodies—Mouse α-TRPC1-N, rabbit α-TRPC1-C, or rabbit α-TRPC1-N was mouse polyclonal against the N-terminal cytoplasmic region, rabbit polyclonal against the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail, or rabbit polyclonal antibody made against the N-terminal region of human TRPC1, respectively. Mouse or chicken α-I-mfa was raised against the entire I-mfa molecule. All antibodies were raised against fusions of TRPC1 or I-mfa with GST. Antibody titers were initially determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using purified TRPC1 or I-mfa fusions with MBP. Rabbit α-TRPC1-C and chicken α-I-mfa were further affinity purified using the AminoLink method (Pierce). All polyclonal antibodies recognized human, mouse, and rat TRPC1 or I-mfa protein. Production of Monoclonal Antibody (1F1)—Monoclonal antibody was produced by standard methods (41Cambell A.M. Monoclonal Antibody Technology. Elsevier, Amsterdam1984Google Scholar). Briefly, female Balb/c mice were immunized to purified GST-TRPC1-N by three biweekly injections (intraperitoneally and subcutaneous) of 15 μg each. Serum levels of specific antibody were determined by direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Four days following the final injection, the spleen of the animal determined to have the highest specific titer was removed and then fused to Sp/2O myeloma cells in 50% polyethylene glycol-500. Following hypoxanthine-aminopterine-thymidine selection, resulting clones were screened for specific antibody production by direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a purified fusion of the N-terminal of human TRPC1 with MBP (MBP-TRPC1-N). Positive clones were subcloned twice by limiting dilution. 1F1 showed the highest titers and was further used for ascites production. 1F1 was isotyped mouse IgG1 and its specificity to TRPC1 was additionally characterized by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence staining in transfected cells. 1F1 recognized human, mouse, and rat TRPC1. Yeast Two-hybrid—The L40 yeast strain containing both His and LacZ reporters under the control of LexA binding sites was sequentially transformed with a bait plasmid in pLexA containing a portion of the C-terminal cytoplasmic region of human TRPC1 (Asp639-Ser750, accession number Z73903) and a human fetal kidney library (Clontech) in pGAD10 or a whole mouse embryonic library in pVP16. Four million independent clones from each library were screened with pLexA-TRPC1. Two overlapping clones of human I-mfa were obtained from the human fetal kidney library and a single mouse clone was obtained from the mouse embryonic library. In Vitro Binding Using Recombinant Proteins—MBP or GST fusions were expressed and purified from bacteria using amylose resin or glutathione-Sepharose 4B column, respectively. GST fusions were retained on the column, whereas MBP fusions were eluted by 10 mm maltose. The concentration and integrity of purified soluble or immobilized MBP or GST fusions, respectively, were determined by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of 12% SDS-PAGE gel containing known amounts of purified bovine serum albumin or MBP. In a typical in vitro binding assay, 2 μg of immobilized GST fusions were incubated with 5 μg of soluble MBP or MBP fusion in a total volume of 1 ml of immunoprecipitation solution (1% Triton X-100 buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, aprotinin (1 μg/ml), and pepstatin). Binding was done overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed five times in immunoprecipitation buffer, resuspended in 40 μl of gel loading buffer, separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, and followed by Western blotting using α-MBP (1:10,000) (New England Biolabs). Transient Transfections and Immunoprecipitations—Transient transfections and immunoprecipitations were done in HEK293T cells as described previously (42Tsiokas L. Kim E. Arnould T. Sukhatme V.P. Walz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6965-6970Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Stable Transfections in CHO-K1 Cells—CHO-K1 cells were transfected with pSV2-neo (CHOmock cells) or F-I-mfa, pSV2-neo, and CD4 (CHOI-mfa) using LipofectAMINE PLUS (Invitrogen) and stable transfectants were selected in 500 μg/ml G418 for 2 weeks. CD4 did not affect the interaction between TRPC1 and I-mfa, as determined by transient transfections followed by co-immunoprecipitations (data not shown). Individual clones were isolated, expanded, and sorted twice for CD4+ cells using a phycoerythrin-conjugated monoclonal antibody against CD4 to obtain pure populations of F-I-mfa expressing cells. Individual clones were first tested for F-I-mfa expression by immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting using α-FLAG. Clone CHOI-mfa showed the highest levels of F-I-mfa. Electrophysiology—The conventional whole cell voltage-clamp configuration was used to measure transmembrane currents in single cells. Patch clamp recordings were obtained from single cells at room temperature using a Warner PC-505B amplifier (Warner Instrument Corp., Hamden, CT) and pClamp 8 software (Axon Instrument, Foster City, CA). Glass pipettes (plain, Fisher Scientific) with resistances of 5–8MΩ were prepared with a pipette puller and polisher (PP-830 and MF-830, respectively, Narishige, Tokyo, Japan). After the whole cell configuration was achieved, cell capacitance and series resistance were compensated before each recording period. From a holding potential of 0 mV, voltage steps were applied from –100 to 80 mV in 20-mV increments with 100 ms duration at 5-s intervals. I-V relationships were measured by voltage ramping from –80 to 90 mV within 100 ms. Current traces were filtered at 1 kHz and analyzed off-line with pClamp 8. Statistical analysis was employed with the SigmaStat (Chicago, IL) software. Data were reported as mean ± S.E. One-way repeated measures analysis of variance followed by Student-Newman-Keul's tests were used for comparisons among sequential treatments in the same group. Student's t test was used for comparisons between groups. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. The pipette solution contained (in mm): 135 cesium methane sulfonate, 8 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 0.3 Mg-ATP, 0.03 GTP, 10 HEPES, and 10 EGTA (pH 7.2). The external (bath) solution contained (in mm): 110 NaCl, 5 CsCl, 1 MgCl2, 20 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, and 10 glucose (pH 7.4). Permeability ratio of Ca2+ to Na+ was calculated from the modified GHK equation as described in Ref. 43Vennekens R. Hoenderop J.G. Prenen J. Stuiver M. Willems P.H. Droogmans G. Nilius B. Bindels R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3963-3969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, assuming a permeability ratio of Cs+ to Na+ equals to 1. Ratiometric Ca2+Measurements—Cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5 mm EDTA, washed with normal extracellular solution (ECS) (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), and loaded with 2 μm Indo-1/AM in ECS containing 0.05% pluronic F-127 (Molecular Probes) for 40 min at room temperature. After the 40-min incubation, cells were washed three times with a nominally Ca2+-free solution (same as ECS but 2 mm CaCl2 was replaced by 0.5 mm EGTA, ECS-EGTA). 2 × 106 cells were resuspended in 2 ml of ECS-EGTA. Cells in ECS-EGTA were first incubated with 1 μm thapsigargin (TG) for 1 h to deplete the internal stores and then Ca2+ entry was determined by CaCl2 re-addition (6.25 mm CaCl2). Ca2+ entry in response to Ca2+ re-addition without prior store depletion was also determined. Ratiometric measurements representing free intracellular Ca2+ concentration were obtained by a PTI QuantaMaster spectrofluorometer equipped with an excitation monochromator set at 350 nm and two emission monochromators set at 405 and 485 nm. RNAi—To inactivate human I-mfa in A431 cells, we first constructed a vector that would allow the production of a small I-mfa-specific interfering RNA driven by the polymerase-III H1-RNA gene promoter. Specifically, a fragment of H1-RNA promoter was cloned into pUB/Bsd (Invitrogen) by EcoRI-BamHI digestion to generate pUB/Bsd/H1. This vector allowed blasticidin selection for stable integration. We then cloned a 64-mer I-mfa-specific oligo (sense strand: 5′-GATCCCCGAGTAAGAGCAGCAGCAAATTCAAGAGATTTGCTGCTGCTCTTACTCTTTTTGGAAA-3′) into pUB/Bsd/H1 digested with BamHI-HindIII to generate a construct that would allow the production of a short hairpin I-mfa RNA in mammalian cells. A431 cells were transfected in 10-cm plates using FuGENE (Qiagen). 48 h following transfection, cells were placed in selective media containing 10 μg/ml blasticidin. After 2 weeks, individual clones were picked and expanded. Clone A431I-mfa-RNAi showed the highest I-mfa reduction and was used in the described experiments. I-mfa Is an Interacting Partner of TRPC1—A yeast two-hybrid screen using two independent libraries, a human fetal kidney or whole mouse embryonic (E9.5) library, resulted in the identification of I-mfa as an interacting partner with TRPC1. Two overlapping clones containing the entire I-mfa cDNA including a portion of the 5′-untranslated region or just the a-region were obtained from the human fetal kidney library, and a partial clone containing the a-region and a portion of the common region was obtained from the whole mouse embryonic library. DNA sequence analysis revealed that all interacting clones were in-frame with the transactivation domain of GAL4. Because the smaller interacting clone contained just the a-region of I-mfa, we inferred that TRPC1 might specifically interact with the a- but not the b- or c-isoforms of I-mf. In Vitro Interaction and Co-localization of I-mfa and TRPC1 in Transfected Cells—To test whether the a-region of I-mfa specifically interacted with the C-terminal cytoplasmic region of TRPC1 (TRPC1-C), we employed purified recombinant proteins to examine these interactions. 2 μg of immobilized GST, a fusion protein with GST and the C-terminal tail of human TRPC1 (GST-TRPC1-C), or the N-terminal region of human TRPC1 (GST-TRPC1-N) were incubated with 5 μg of soluble, purified MBP or MBP fused to the a-region of human I-mfa (MBP-Imfa(a)). Fig. 1A shows that MBP-Imfa(a), but not MBP (lanes 3, 5, and 7), bound to GST-TRPC1-C (lane 6) but not GST (lane 4) or GST-TRPC1-N (lane 8). These results show that the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of TRPC1 can mediate a direct, physical interaction with the a-region of I-mfa. To determine whether full-length TRPC1 and I-mfa could interact in mammalian cells, we transfected FLAG-tagged I-mfa (F-I-mfa), myc-tagged TRPC1 (M-TRPC1), or myc-tagged TRPC3 (M-TRPC3) in HEK293T cells and tested their interactions by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. F-I-mfa co-immunoprecipitated with M-TRPC1 (Fig. 1B, lane 3) but failed to interact with M-TRPC3 (Fig. 1B, lane 2) showing specificity of I-mfa for TRPC1 but not for a homologous channel protein. A TRPC1-truncation mutant lacking the domain used in the yeast two-hybrid screen to identify I-mfa (TRPC1Δ) failed to interact with I-mfa (Fig. 1C, lane 2). Conversely, a truncation mutant of I-mfa lacking almost the entire a-region (F-I-mfaΔ5) could not associate with TRPC1 (Fig. 1C, lane 4). HA-tagged I-mfb (HA-I-mfb) was also unable to associate with TRPC1 (Fig. 1D, lane 2) supporting the finding that the interaction between TRPC1 and F-I-mfa is mediated by the a-region of I-mf. Altogether, these results demonstrate not only the specificity of the interaction but also the lack of additional interaction domains in the two proteins. Myogenin Competes with TRPC1 for Binding to I-mfa— Because the a-region of I-mfa was independently found to mediate an interaction with bHLH proteins (37Chen C.M. Kraut N. Groudine M. Weintraub H. Cell. 1996; 86: 731-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), we tested whether the bHLH protein myogenin could compete with TRPC1 for binding to I-mfa. Fig. 1E shows that increasing amounts of transfected myogenin did inhibit the TRPC1-I-mfa association in a concentration-dependent fashion. These results suggest th"

In particular, control of transcriptional elongation by RNA polymerase II has proved to be important for alternative splicing regulation. In this report we demonstrate that the efficiency of exon recognition by the splicing machinery is crucial for the elongation control. Alternative splicing of the fibronectin extra domain I (EDI) is because the polypyrimidine tract of its 3′-splice site occurs suboptimal. By mutating the polypyrimidine tract of EDI in two different positions, individually or in combination, and by disrupting its exonic splicing silencer, we managed to generate minigenes with increasing degrees of exon recognition. Improvement of exon recognition is evidenced by independence from the splicing regulator SF2/ASF for inclusion. The mutated minigenes were used to transfect human cells in culture and study the responsiveness of EDI alternative splicing to activation or inhibition of pol II elongation. Our results revealed that responsiveness of exon skipping to elongation is inversely proportional to 3′-splice site strength, which means that the better the alternative exon is recognized by the splicing machinery, the less its degree of inclusion is affected by transcriptional elongation.

Most human gene transcripts are alternatively spliced generating several different mRNAs that increase protein diversity (1International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium Nature. 2001; 409: 860-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (17572) Google Scholar). cis-Acting sequences and trans-acting factors regulate splicing.

In metazoans, the PPT is essential for efficient branch point utilization and 3′-ss recognition (2Reed R. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2113-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). On the other hand, protein factors can act on regulatory sequences. When alternative splicing exists, the choice between the alternative sites depends on the relative quality of the constitutive signals. In addition, regulatory proteins can shift this balance and favor one site usage to the detriment of the other. This implies the presence of complex regulatory mechanisms. splice site polymerase extra domain I polypyrimidine tract exonic splicing enhancer wild type fibronectin 5′,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole exonic splicing silencer human immunodeficiency virus, type 2. splice site polymerase extra domain I polypyrimidine tract exonic splicing enhancer wild type fibronectin 5′,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole exonic splicing silencer human immunodeficiency virus, type 2. Reactions involved in pre-mRNA processing such as capping, splicing, and 3′-end processing/polyadenylation are closely coupled to RNA polymerase II (pol II) transcription and can modulate each other, adding to the intricacy of these events (for reviews see Refs. 3Bentley D.

For example, we have demonstrated that promoter identity can affect alternative splicing (8Cramer P. Pesce C.G. Baralle F.E. Kornblihtt A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11456-11460Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 9Cramer P. Caceres J.F. Cazalla D. Kadener S. Muro A.F. Baralle F.E. Kornblihtt A.R. Mol.

Factors that increase elongation, such as certain transcriptional activators, stimulate skipping of the fibronectin (FN) EDI exon, whereas treatments with drugs that inhibit elongation like 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB), favor exon inclusion (10Kadener S. Cramer P. Nogués G. Cazalla D. de la Mata M. Fededa J.P. Werbajh S.E. Srebrow A. Kornblihtt A.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5759-5768Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 11Kadener S. Fededa J.P.

The C4 point mutation of the Drosophila pol II largest subunit confers the enzyme a lower elongation rate (“slow” polymerase), and it was shown in Drosophila embryos carrying this mutation that resplicing of the Hox gene Ultrabithorax is stimulated. This provides the first evidence for the transcriptional control of alternative splicing on an endogenous gene (13de la Mata M. Alonso C.R. Kadener S. Fededa J.P. Blaustein M. Pelisch F. Cramer P. Bentley D. Kornblihtt A.R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 525-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). The ability of activators to enhance elongation by pol II correlates with their ability to enhance exon skipping. EDI exon skipping occurs because the 3′-ss of the upstream intron (named EDI 3′-ss) is suboptimal compared with the 3′-ss of the downstream intron. Our model assumes that if the polymerase pauses anywhere between these two sites, only elimination of the upstream intron can take place. Once the pause is passed or the polymerase proceeds, there is no option for the splicing machinery but to eliminate the downstream intron, which leads to exon inclusion (Fig. 1A, left). A highly processive elongating pol II would favor the simultaneous presentation of both introns to the splicing machinery, a situation in which the stronger 3′-ss of the downstream intron outcompetes the weaker EDI 3′-ss site, resulting in exon skipping (Fig. 1A, right). At the pre-mRNA primary sequence level, this model relies almost exclusively on the weakness of EDI 3′-ss. Therefore, the model can be tested by looking at the effects of pol II elongation rate on a transcript in which EDI 3′-ss has been strengthened (Fig. 1B). In this study we strengthened EDI 3′-ss by mutating its polypyrimidine tract in two different positions, independently or in combination. These mutants not only provoked much higher EDI basal inclusion levels but also abolished the stimulation of EDI skipping caused by treatments that stimulate pol II elongation. Furthermore, the SR protein SF2/ASF that binds to the EDI exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) and thus enhances 3′-ss recognition of the EDI (9Cramer P. Caceres J.F. Cazalla D. Kadener S. Muro A.F.

Plasmid Constructs—pSVEDA/Gal5-HIV-2 has been described previously (12Nogués G. Kadener S. Cramer P. Bentley D. Kornblihtt A.R. J. Biol.

This plasmid contains the α-globin/FN minigene reporter for alternative splicing of the EDI alternative exon of human FN (also named EDA and EIIIA) under the control of the HIV-2 promoter fused to five copies of the target site for the DNA-binding domain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Gal4 transcription factor. pSVEDA/Gal5-HIV-2 ESS- bears a disruption of the exonic splicing silencer (ESS). pSVEDA/FN contains the EDI alternative exon of human FN under the control of the human FN promoter (9Cramer P.

None of these minigene reporter constructs contains the SV40 enhancer/origin region. Expression vector for Gal4 fusion protein Gal4-VP16-(410–490) and the control vector Gal4-(1–147) were described previously (14Blau J. Xiao H. McCracken S. O'Hare P. Greenblatt J. Bentley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2044-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). g10 SF2/ASF wild type expression plasmid was described previously (15Caceres J.F. Misteli T. Screaton G.R. Spector D.L. Krainer A.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 225-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Generation of Point Mutations—The point mutations G→ T at position -9, A→ T at position -5, and the double mutation G→ T and A→ T were generated by PCR-directed mutagenesis using complementary primers carrying the mutations as well as primers anchoring at the unique restriction sites of SnaBI (∼1260 bp upstream of the mutation site) and XhoI (∼120 bp downstream of the mutation site). Successive PCRs were performed with Pfu Turbo polymerase (Stratagene) until a product of ∼1.4 kbp was obtained. This product was digested with SnaBI and XhoI and inserted into the minigene plasmids previously digested with the same enzymes. In this way, pSVEDA/Gal5-HIV-2 AT that carries the A→ T mutation and pSVEDA/Gal5-HIV-2 DM that carries the G→ T and A→ T mutations were generated from the wild type plasmid (pSVEDA/Gal5-HIV-2 WT). In the case of plasmids in which the FN promoter drove transcription, the mutant constructs pSVEDA/FN GT (carrying the G→ T mutation), pSVEDA/FN AT (carrying the A→ T mutation), and pSVEDA/FN DM (carrying the G→ T and A→ T mutations) were generated from the wild type plasmid pSVEDA/FN WT. The resulting constructs were sequenced to confirm that they carried the designed mutations. Transfections—Conditions for transfection of human hepatoma Hep3B cells with minigene constructs were described elsewhere (10Kadener S. Cramer P. Nogués G. Cazalla D. de la Mata M. Fededa J.P.

For RNAi functional knock down experiments, cells were co-transfected with 600 ng of the reporter minigene for FN EDI splicing and 500 ng of either one of the following siRNAs duplexes (only sense sequence shown): SF2/ASF, 5′-CCAAGGACAUUGAGGACGUdTdT-3′; Luc (GL3 luciferase), 5′-CUUACGCUGAGUACUUCGAdTdT-3′ (16Elbashir S.M.

Generation of Point Mutations to Strengthen the Polypyrimidine Tract of EDI 3′-Splice Site—As a tool to assess the effects on alternative splicing, we used a minigene in which the human fibronectin EDI alternative exon and its flanking regions were embedded in the third exon of the human α-globin gene. By sequence inspection, the EDI 3′-ss appears weak compared with the 3′-ss of the intron downstream (intron +1), which seems to be the main cause of the EDI exon being alternative. In particular, the PPT falls apart from the consensus sequence (17Zhang M.Q. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 919-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 18Mount S.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 459-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (2776) Google Scholar). Based on this information, we decided to mutate two purines found in the PPT at positions -9 and -5 (G and A, respectively) to T (see under “Experimental Procedures” for details). In this way, we generated two different point mutant constructs named GT and AT, and the double mutant named DM (Fig. 1C). These mutant minigenes were placed under the control of the Gal5-HIV-2 minimal promoter or the FN promoter. VP16 Effect on EDI Skipping Is Inverted in the Polypyrimidine Mutants—The model in Fig. 1A predicts that if the 3′-ss of EDI is made stronger, treatments that increase pol II elongation rate should have smaller or null effects in promoting exon skipping of the EDI. We first assessed the effect of the elongation activator protein VP16 on the mutated constructs. As shown previously (10Kadener S. Cramer P. Nogués G. Cazalla D. de la Mata M. Fededa J.P. Werbajh S.E. Srebrow A. Kornblihtt A.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5759-5768Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), Gal4-VP16 provokes exon skipping on transcripts of a construct driven by the Gal5-HIV-2 promoter (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 1 and 2). As expected, constructs with the mutated PPT have a much higher (44- and 68-fold, respectively) basal exon inclusion (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 5), reflecting better exon recognition by the splicing machinery. Surprisingly, VP16 not only does not provoke exon skipping in the mutated transcripts (Fig. 2A, lanes 4 and 6) but enhances EDI retention. VP16 Has No Effect on EDI Inclusion in a Construct Where the ESS Has Been Disrupted—To rule out that the observed results were caused by mutation effects other than a strengthening of EDI exon recognition, we tested a minigene in which the ESS has been disrupted. EDI carries an ESS downstream of the ESE (19Caputi M. Casari G. Guenzi S. Tagliabue R. Sidoli A. Melo C.A. Baralle F.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1018-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Disruption of this element provoked a 13-fold stimulation of basal EDI inclusion (Fig. 2B, lane 3) as a consequence of improving EDI exon recognition through a strategy different from PPT mutagenesis. Consistently, however, with the PPT results, VP16 failed to induce EDI skipping in the ESS- mutant (Fig. 2B, lane 4). We assumed that basal EDI inclusion levels in each construct reflect indirectly 3′-ss strength. Thus, in this particular case, the ESS mutant would be stronger than the WT but weaker than the PPT mutants. These PPT mutants showed that these point mutations strongly enhanced exon recognition almost as if it were a constitutive exon. On the other hand, the ESS disruption perhaps had a more feeble effect as it acted indirectly on the 3′-ss as a way to strengthen this splice site. Nonetheless, the effects of the two strengthening strategies are qualitatively similar. Fig. 2C shows that the effect of enhancing exon skipping by VP16 correlates with the effectiveness of the 3′-ss recognition. Inhibition of EDI Skipping by the Elongation Inhibitor DRB Is Smaller in the PPT Mutants—The positive transcription elongation factor (P-TEFb) complex is a dimer of CDK9 and cyclin T1/2. Its kinase activity (20Marshall N.F. Peng J. Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27176-27183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar) was involved in the stimulation of pol II elongation by activators. P-TEFb phosphorylates the carboxyl-terminal domain of pol II, and this phosphorylation converts the polymerase from a nonprocessive to a processive form (for a thorough review on P-TEFb action see Ref. 21Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2629-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). The fact that an inhibitor of this kinase, like DRB, prevents pol II elongation (22Tamm I. Kikuchi T. Darnell Jr., J.E. Salditt-Georgieff M. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2743-2748Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) strongly supports this idea. Cells were transfected with wild type (WT) minigenes and with minigenes carrying the PPT mutations (GT, AT, and DM) under the control of the FN promoter (Fig. 3A) and were treated with DRB for the last 24 h of transfection. As foreseen, PPT mutations strongly provoked higher EDI inclusion levels also with this promoter. The GT, AT, and DM mutants showed 24-, 84-, and 142-fold increases in EDI inclusion, respectively (Fig. 3A, lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7). The mutation at position -9 (GT) appeared to be less effective than that at position -5 (AT) to promote exon recognition. DRB had a 3.2-fold effect on the WT construct (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 2), but this effect strongly decreased when the reporter minigene carries the PPT mutations (Fig. 3A, lanes 3–8). This supports our hypothesis that sensitivity to changes in pol II processivity correlates with the relative weakness of EDI 3′-ss compared with the 3′-ss located downstream of the alternative exon. Curiously, the effect of DRB is not completely abolished even in the DM constructs. Fig. 3B shows that the stronger the 3′-ss is, the less the minigene is responsive to the elongation inhibitor DRB. As in Fig. 2C, we assumed that basal EDI inclusion correlates with 3′-ss strength. Apparently, at least when transcription is driven by the FN promoter, a plateau is reached, as the AT and DM mutants do not differ significantly in their behavior. The SR Protein SF2/ASF Fails to Further Augment EDI Inclusion in the PPT Mutants—It has been shown that a 3′-ss is recognized and used depending on a combination between the branch point, the PPT, and splicing enhancer elements. Splicing enhancers can compensate for either a weak PPT or a weak branch point (23Buvoli M. Mayer S.A. Patton J.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7174-7183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When regulation of the splice sites selection is required, cells can modulate the production of different mRNAs by differentially expressing SR proteins that bind to splicing enhancer elements. In the β-tropomyosin pre-mRNA, for example, inappropriate exon skipping can be prevented by an excess of the SR protein SF2/ASF (24Mayeda A. Helfman D.M. Krainer A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2993-3001Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In the case of FN, SF2/ASF binds to the purine-rich sequence 5′-GAAGAAGAC-3′ found in the ESE of EDI. By doing so, it stimulates the use of the suboptimal EDI 3′-ss and consequently increases EDI inclusion (9Cramer P. Caceres J.F. Cazalla D. Kadener S. Muro A.F. Baralle F.E. Kornblihtt A.R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 251-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Thus, SF2/ASF binding functionally strengthens exon recognition in trans by improving splicing factor assembly on the intrinsically weak EDI 3′-ss. Therefore, SF2/ASF effect is somehow equivalent to make the 3′-ss closer to the consensus by mutagenesis. We assessed the effect of SF2/ASF overexpression on the PPT mutants in the human FN minigene. It was shown previously that sensitivity to SF2/ASF was dependent on exon definition (25Pagani F. Stuani C. Zuccato E. Kornblihtt A.R. Baralle F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1511-1517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Whereas SF2/ASF enhanced EDI inclusion by more than 20-fold on the WT construct, it did so only by 5-fold on the GT mutant, and it had no effect at all on the AT and DM mutants (Fig. 4A). Once more, the point mutant GT appears to be weaker than the AT, which behaves like the DM as in Fig. 3A. Overexpression of a protein could perturb normal cell behavior, as it may commit the transcription and translation machineries to work on its production to the detriment of other proteins of the cell. As a control of a different nature, we evaluated the SF2/ASF effect by specifically preventing its translation instead of overexpressing it. We did this through the RNAi technique. We have shown previously, by Western blot experiments, that co-transfection of RNAi against SF2/ASF completely abolishes SF2/ASF production (13de la Mata M. Alonso C.R. Kadener S. Fededa J.P. Blaustein M. Pelisch F. Cramer P. Bentley D. Kornblihtt A.R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 525-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar) in transfected cells. Fig. 4B (lanes 1–4) shows that the WT and GT constructs are equally responsive to EDI inclusion inhibition by RNAi to SF2/ASF (∼3-fold inhibition). The AT and DM mutants are less sensitive to SF2/ASF RNAi than the WT (Fig. 4B, lanes 5–8). Transcriptional modulation of alternative splicing was first suggested by promoter swapping experiments with minigenes transfected into mammalian cells (8Cramer P. Pesce C.G. Baralle F.E. Kornblihtt A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11456-11460Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 9Cramer P. Caceres J.F. Cazalla D. Kadener S. Muro A.F. Baralle F.E. Kornblihtt A.R.

Science. 2002; 298: 416-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). More physiological evidence for the existence of co-transcriptional events controlling alternative splicing involved findings that transcription factors with different effects on pol II elongation, acting on a single promoter, had differential effects on alternative splicing (12Nogués G. Kadener S. Cramer P. Bentley D. Kornblihtt A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43110-43114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The use of a mutated large subunit of RNA polymerase II with lower processivity permitted a more direct demonstration that changes in transcription elongation rates modulate alternative splicing both on reporter minigenes transfected in human cells and on an endogenous gene in Drosophila embryos (13de la Mata M. Alonso C.R. Kadener S. Fededa J.P. Blaustein M. Pelisch F. Cramer P. Bentley D. Kornblihtt A.R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 525-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it is important to point out that not all alternatively spliced regions are subjected to transcriptional control. For example, inclusion levels of the alternatively spliced EDII exon of human fibronectin (also named EDB and EIIIB) are not affected by promoter swapping, transcription factor activation, or the slow polymerase but are stimulated by overexpression of the SR protein Srp40 (27Du K. Peng Y. Greenbaum L.E. Haber B.A. Taub R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4096-4104Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This indicates that control by SR proteins might or might not co-exist with transcriptional control. Responsiveness of alternative splicing to transcriptional elongation might not only depend on factors that are known to affect pol II elongation in general such as chromatin organization (10Kadener S. Cramer P. Nogués G. Cazalla D. de la Mata M. Fededa J.P. Werbajh S.E. Srebrow A. Kornblihtt A.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5759-5768Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), histone acetylation (12Nogués G. Kadener S. Cramer P. Bentley D. Kornblihtt A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43110-43114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), or carboxyl-terminal domain phosphorylation (DRB effect, see Ref. 12Nogués G. Kadener S. Cramer P.

Chem. 2002; 277: 43110-43114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar and Fig. 3 in this paper) but also the gene pausing architecture, i.e. the number, strength, and distribution of transcription pauses along the DNA template (28Roberts G.C. Gooding C. Mak H.Y. Proudfoot N.J. Smith C.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5568-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) as well as the presence of long introns in the alternatively spliced regions (29Hatton A.R. Subramaniam V. Lopez A.J. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 787-796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate that the efficiency of exon recognition by the splicing machinery is crucial for the elongation control. Previous studies have demonstrated that strengthening of EDI 3′-ss and 5′-ss of a mouse FN minigene increase exon recognition (30Muro A.F. Iaconcig A. Baralle F.E. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). By mutating the polypyrimidine tract of human EDI in two different positions, individually or in combination, and by disrupting its ESS, we managed to generate five constructs (including the wild type) with the following increasing degrees of EDI exon recognition: WT, ESS-, GT, AT, and DM. Improvement of exon recognition is evidenced both by increases in basal EDI inclusion/exclusion ratios and by independence from SF2/ASF for inclusion (Fig. 4). The mutated constructs were used to study responsiveness to activators (VP16) and inhibitors (DRB) of pol II elongation. Our results validate the model in Fig. 1A by demonstrating the hypothesis in Fig. 1B, and revealed that responsiveness of exon skipping to elongation correlates inversely with 3′-ss strength. In other words, the better the alternative exon is recognized by the splicing machinery, the less its degree of inclusion is affected by transcriptional elongation. An inverse approach has been used recently in yeast to show a similar link between elongation and exon recognition. Alternative splicing is a very rare event in yeast. By mutating the branch point upstream of the constitutive internal exon of the DYN2 gene, Howe et al. (31Howe K. Kane C.M. Ares M. RNA (New York). 2003; 9: 993-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) created an artificial cassette exon that becomes alternatively spliced. Skipping of this exon can be partially prevented when expressed in a yeast mutant carrying a slow pol II or in the presence of elongation inhibitors. This supports the hypothesis that what is important to the balance between exon skipping and exon inclusion is the relative rates of spliceosome formation and pol II processivity. Regulation of alternative splicing by trans-acting factors has also been shown to depend on the presence of suboptimal splicing sites. TRA-2 protein is regulated in the male germ line of Drosophila through a negative feedback mechanism in which a specific TRA-2 isoform represses splicing of the M1 intron in the TRA-2 pre-mRNA. This repression depends on the presence of a suboptimal non-consensus 3′-splice site. Substitution of this 3′-splice site with a strong splice site resulted in TRA-2 independent splicing, implying that reduced basal splicing efficiency is important for regulation (32Chandler D.S. McGuffin M.E. Mattox W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3012-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Fig. 2B shows that complete loss of regulation by pol II elongation is achieved by disruption of the exonic splicing silencer present in EDI exon. This silencer probably acts by stabilizing a pre-mRNA secondary structure that inhibits recognition of the neighboring splicing enhancer by SF2/ASF. Disruption of the ESS would alter secondary structure to better expose ESE sequences (33Muro A.F. Caputi M. Pariyarath R. Pagani F. Buratti E. Baralle F.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2657-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In this context it is possible to speculate that, from an evolutionary point of view, the appearance of ESEs not only compensated for mutations that weaken splice sites but also allowed fine-tuning in splicing regulation through combinatory control by the abundance of SR proteins and the modulation of transcriptional elongation rates. This dual regulatory strategy seems to have an advantage in metazoans where, compared with other eukaryotes, introns are usually longer and have highly degenerate splice site and branch point recognition sequences.

Three SUMO isoforms, SUMO-1 to SUMO-3, have been identified in mammals (12Hay R.T. Trends Biochem.

The SUMO-1-interacting motif comprises the sequence ψKXE, where ψ is a large hydrophobic residue, K is the lysine to which SUMO-1 is conjugated, X is any amino acid, and E is glutamic acid. The pathway of sumoylation is similar to that of ubiquitination, involving a cascade of three enzymes (E1, E2, and E3) and resulting in the formation of a bond between the COOH-terminal carboxyl group of SUMO and a lysine side chain of the target protein (14Kagey M.H.

In contrast to ubiquitination, sumoylation does not appear to promote protein degradation but rather contributes to the regulation of protein-protein interaction as well as to subcellular compartmentalization and protein stability. The sumoylation of diverse proteins, including c-Jun, c-Myb, IκB, p53, PML, and histone deacetylases, influences the function of these proteins in transcriptional repression or activation or in cell cycle regulation as well as their nuclear localization or ubiquitination (15Vergers A.

PLZF has indeed been found to be modified by SUMO-1 conjugation in vivo. We identified Lys242 in the RD2 domain of PLZF as the target for sumoylation and found that such modification modulates the transcriptional activity of PLZF as well as PLZF function in cell cycle regulation.

The PLZF mutant K242R was generated with the use of a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and verified by DNA sequencing. For expression of FLAG epitope-tagged wild-type PLZF or PLZF(K242R) in 293T cells, the corresponding cDNAs were cloned into pFLAG-CMV-5 (Sigma). For expression of glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins of wild-type PLZF or PLZF(K242R) in bacteria, the corresponding cDNAs were cloned into pGEX 5X-1 (Amersham Biosciences).

Cell Culture and Transfection—The human embryonic kidney cell line 293T was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen.). The human APL cell line HL-60 was maintained in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum and glutamine (2 mg/ml). All tissue culture media were also supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (Invitrogen). For transient transfection, 293T cells were grown in 60-mm culture dishes to 50-80% confluence and then transfected with expression vectors (total of 2-10 μg) by the calcium phosphate method (24Dong S.

Transfected 293T cells were lysed in lysis buffer and subjected to immunoprecipitation by incubation for 3 h at 4 °C with mouse monoclonal antibodies to FLAG (Sigma). Immune complexes were collected by centrifugation after the addition of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The beads were washed five times with lysis buffer, and the immunoprecipitates were then subjected to immunoblot analysis with the antibodies to FLAG or the mouse monoclonal antibodies to SUMO-1 (anti-Xpress; Invitrogen) (25Eloranta J.J.

For normalization of transfection efficiency, cells were also transfected with 100 ng of a β-galactosidase expression plasmid (pCMV-β-gal). After incubation for 36 h, the cells were assayed for luciferase activity with a luciferase assay system (Promega) as well as for β-galactosidase activity. Expression of PLZF protein was evaluated by immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis of cell extracts with antibodies to FLAG (19Kirsh O. Seeler J.S. Pichler A. Gast A. Muller S. Miska E.

EMSA Analysis—In vitro protein translation was performed with the TnT-coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). GST-PLZF and GST-PLZF(K242R) fusion proteins (5 μg), purified from bacteria, were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in a reaction mixture (30 μl) containing in vitro-translated SUMO-1 (0.5 μg), HeLa cell extracts, purified UBC9 (1 μg) (kindly provided by R.

The PLZF proteins were then isolated with glutathione-agarose beads and subjected to electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) by incubation for 1 h on ice in 30 μl of a reaction mixture containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 0.1 ng of 32P end-labeled DNA probe (7Li J.Y.

The binding mixture was then subjected to electrophoresis on a native 4% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA, and PLZF-DNA complexes were detected by autoradiography (20Goodson M.L. Hong Y.

Cell Cycle Analysis—HL-60 cells stably expressing wild-type PLZF or PLZF(K242R) were fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol, centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 × g, and resuspended in PBS containing 5 mm EDTA and RNase A (50 μg/ml). After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, the cells were stained with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) and analyzed by flow cytometry with a FACSCalibur instrument (BD Biosciences) (11Yeyati P.L. Shaknovich R. Boterashvili S. Li J. Ball H.J. Waxman S. Nason-Burchenal K. Dmitrovsky E. Zelent A. Licht J.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 925-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). PLZF Is Modified by SUMO-1 in Vivo—Immunoprecipitation of endogenous PLZF from HL-60 cells that had been metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine yielded two labeled bands upon analysis by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (Fig. 1A). The major band migrated at a position corresponding to a molecular mass of 81 kDa, consistent with the size of wild-type PLZF, whereas the minor band migrated at a position corresponding to a molecular size of 96 kDa. This observation suggested that the 96 kDa protein is a modified form of PLZF, and the difference in size between the two proteins was consistent with the addition of one molecule of SUMO-1. To determine whether PLZF is indeed modified by sumoylation, we transiently transfected 293T cells, which do not express endogenous PLZF at a detectable level, with an expression vector for FLAG-tagged PLZF in the absence or presence of a vector for His-tagged SUMO-1. FLAG-PLZF was then immunoprecipitated from the transfected cells and subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to FLAG or SUMO-1 (Fig. 1B). Immunoblot analysis with the antibodies to FLAG of the FLAG-PLZF precipitates (or the original lysates) prepared from cells coexpressing His-SUMO-1 revealed the presence of a prominent band corresponding to FLAG-PLZF. This additional band was not detected in the immunoprecipitates (or lysates) prepared from cells expressing FLAG-PLZF in the absence of His-SUMO-1, indicating that it corresponded to a SUMO-1-modified form of PLZF. We next determined whether PLZF colocalized with SUMO-1 in 293T cells cotransfected with plasmids encoding FLAG-PLZF and GFP-tagged SUMO-1. Immunofluorescence analysis with antibodies to FLAG and confocal microscopy revealed that FLAG-PLZF immunofluorescence and GFP-SUMO-1 fluorescence were colocalized in nuclear granules (Fig. 1C), again indicating that PLZF is modified by conjugation with SUMO-1 in vivo. Lysine 242 Is the Target Residue of PLZF for SUMO-1 Modification—To identify the residue of PLZF that is modified by SUMO-1, we examined the amino acid sequence of the human protein for the presence of the consensus sequence (ψKXE) for such a modification. The RD2 domain of PLZF indeed contains the sequence Val-Lys242 → Thr-Glu, which matches the consensus sumoylation motif perfectly (Fig. 2A). We mutated Lys242 of PLZF to arginine and then tested the ability of the PLZF(K242R) mutant to undergo SUMO-1 conjugation in transfected 293T cells. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis revealed that the mutation of Lys242 in the sumoylation consensus sequence prevented conjugation of FLAG-PZLF with His-SUMO-1 (Fig. 2B), indicating that this residue is indeed the target for modification by SUMO-1. SUMO-1 Modification Regulates Transcriptional Repression by PLZF—To examine whether SUMO-1 modification affects the transcriptional regulatory activity of PLZF, we compared the activity of wild-type PLZF with that of the sumoylation-resistant mutant PLZF(K242R) with the use of a luciferase reporter assay. The reporter plasmid contained four copies of a high-affinity binding site for PLZF derived from the IL-3Rα gene promoter (Fig. 3A). 293T cells were transfected with this reporter plasmid as well as with expression vectors for His-SUMO-1 and either wild-type FLAG-PLZF or the mutant FLAG-PLZF(K242R). The marked repression of luciferase gene transcription apparent in cells expressing wild-type PLZF was almost completely abolished by the K242R mutation (Fig. 3B). The expression of the corresponding luciferase reporter plasmid lacking the PLZF binding sites was not affected by either wild-type or mutant PLZF (data not shown). These results thus suggested that sumoylation of Lys242 is required for transcriptional repression by PLZF. To determine whether sumoylation regulates transcriptional repression by PLZF through an effect on the interaction of PLZF with its DNA binding site, we performed EMSA analysis. Whereas the binding of wild-type GST-PLZF to the specific DNA probe was markedly increased by incubation with SUMO-1 and a sumoylation reaction mixture, the GST-PLZF(K242R) mutant did not bind substantially to the probe in the absence or presence of these components (Fig. 3C). These data thus indicated that SUMO-1 modification of PLZF regulates transcriptional repression by this protein through an effect on its binding affinity for DNA. SUMO-1 Modification Regulates PLZF Function in the Cell Cycle—To investigate the possible effect of SUMO-1 modification on the function of PLZF in regulation of the cell cycle, we generated HL-60 cell lines stably expressing wild-type PLZF or PLZF(K242R). These cells were synchronized by incubation for 72 h in serum-deficient medium (0.5% fetal bovine serum) and then re-exposed to complete medium for 24 h. The DNA content of the cells was then determined by flow cytometry. Compared with HL-60 cells stably transfected with the empty vector, cells stably expressing wild-type PLZF exhibited a marked increase in the proportion of cells in S phase and a decrease in the percentage of cells in G0-G1 (Fig. 4A). In contrast, stable expression of PLZF(K242R) induced a small decrease in the proportion of cells in S phase. PLZF represses transcription of the gene for cyclin A2. We therefore finally determined the effect of PLZF sumoylation on cyclin A expression in stably transfected HL-60 cells. Immunoblot analysis revealed that stable expression of wild-type PLZF resulted in a decrease in the abundance of cyclin A compared with that in cells transfected with the empty vector (Fig. 4B). In contrast, stable expression of PLZF(K242R) had no such effect. APL accounts for 10-15% of adult acute myeloid leukemia. One of the causes of this condition is the t(11, 17)(q23:q21) translocation that disrupts the PLZF gene, resulting in the generation of two new transcripts, PLZF-RARα and RARα-PLZF. PLZF is localized to the nucleus of cells, where it functions as a transcriptional repressor through its interaction with various corepressors, including histone deacetylases, and regulates cell cycle progression by inhibiting transcription of the cyclin A2 gene (11Yeyati P.L. Shaknovich R. Boterashvili S. Li J. Ball H.J. Waxman S. Nason-Burchenal K. Dmitrovsky E. Zelent A. Licht J.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 925-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 24Dong S. Zhu J.

We have now shown that PLZF is modified by SUMO-1 conjugation at Lys242 and that mutation of this residue to prevent its sumoylation greatly inhibited the biological activity of PLZF. We thus found that sumoylation of PLZF appeared to localize in the nucleus and be required for transcriptional repression by this protein in a luciferase reporter gene assay (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, EMSA analysis revealed that this requirement for modification of PLZF by SUMO-1 conjugation in transcriptional repression by PLZF was due, at least in part, to a sumoylation-induced increase in the affinity of PLZF for its DNA binding site (Fig. 3C). It has been reported that the expression of heat shock protein (hsp) genes are regulated by heat shock transcription factors (HSFs), which bind to the heat shock element (HSE) in the promoter of heat shock genes and stimulate their transcription. Constitutive or stress-induced sumoylation of the heat shock factors HSF1 and HSF2 also stimulate their DNA binding activity and can regulate the function of heat shock factors (20Goodson M.L.

PLZF belongs to the POK (POZ domain and Kruppel zinc finger) family of proteins, all of which interact directly with the PML protein (31Dhordain P. Albagli O. Honore N. Guidez F. Lantoine D. Schmid M. The H.D. Zelent A. Koken M.H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6240-6250Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). POK family proteins localize to nuclear subdomains as a result of self-interaction or association with transcriptional corepressors (32Davies J.M. Hawe N. Kabarowski J. Huang Q.H. Zhu J. Brand N.J. Leprince D. Dhordain P. Cook M. Morriss-Kay G. Zelent A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 365-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). PLZF shares many functional properties with LAZ3 (BCL6), which also concentrates in nuclear subdomains and acts as a sequence-specific transcriptional repressor to inhibit cell growth (31Dhordain P. Albagli O. Honore N. Guidez F. Lantoine D. Schmid M. The H.D. Zelent A. Koken M.H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6240-6250Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 33Albagli O. Lantoine D. Quief S. Quignon F. Englert C. Kerckaert J.P. Montarras D. Pinset C. Lindon C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5063-5075Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Although PLZF has been shown to associate with other POK proteins involved in cell cycle progression, little has been known of the role of SUMO-1 in the control of cell growth, differentiation, and survival (33Albagli O. Lantoine D. Quief S. Quignon F. Englert C. Kerckaert J.P. Montarras D. Pinset C. Lindon C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5063-5075Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We have now shown that sumoylation of PLZF appears to be required for the transcriptional repression of the cyclin A2 gene by PLZF and for the effects of this protein on cell cycle distribution. Compared with stably expressing PLZF(K242R), wild type PLZF showed an increase in the proportion of cells in S phase and a decrease in the percentage of cells in G0-G1, whereas PLZF(K242R) induced a small decrease in the proportion of cells in S phase (Fig. 4). Because the number of SUMO targets has increased rapidly, the function and regulation of SUMO conjugation will apparently vary depending on the substrates. The enzymatic pathway responsible for the sumoylation of PLZF remains to be characterized, although E3s such as RanBP2 and PIAS may play a role. The formation of a thioester between SUMO and E1 is required for SUMO activation. UBC9 physically interacts with most sumoylation substrates, suggesting that it might be sufficient for substrate recognition (15Vergers A. Perdomo J. Crossley M. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). In summary, we have demonstrated posttranslational modification of the transcriptional repressor PLZF. Dynamic posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation and acetylation, regulate the biological functions of many proteins. Modification of PLZF by SUMO-1 conjugation increased the DNA binding affinity, transcriptional repressor activity, and cell cycle regulatory function of this protein. We thank Dr. J. D. Licht and Dr. R.T. Hay for plasmid constructs and advice. We also thank Dr. M. Ruthardt for helpful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2081577956,"Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a potent vasoconstrictor peptide with mitogenic actions linked to activation of tyrosine kinase signaling pathways. ET-1 induces cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), an enzyme that converts arachidonic acid to pro-inflammatory eicosanoids. Activation of each of the three major mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, ERK1/2, JNK/SAPK, and p38 MAPK (p38), have been shown to enhance the expression of COX-2. Negative regulation of MAPK may occur via a family of dual specificity phosphatases referred to as mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatases (MKP). The goal of this work was to test the hypothesis that wild type MKP-1 regulates the expression of ET-1-induced COX-2 expression by inhibiting the activation of p38 in cultured glomerular mesangial cells (GMC). An adenovirus expressing both wild type and a catalytically inactive mutant of MKP-1 (MKP-1/CS) were constructed to study ET-1-regulated MAPK signaling and COX-2 expression in cultured GMC. ET-1 stimulated the phosphorylation of ERK and p38α MAPK and induced the expression of COX-2. Expression of COX-2 was partially blocked by U0126, a MEK inhibitor, and SB 203580, a p38 MAPK inhibitor. Adenoviral expression of MKP-1/CS augmented basal and ET-1-induced phosphorylation of p38α MAPK with less pronounced effects on ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Ectopic expression of wild type MKP-1 blocked the phosphorylation of p38α MAPK by ET-1 but increased the phosphorylation of p38γ MAPK. Co-precipitation studies demonstrated association of MKP-1 with p38α MAPK and ERK1/2. Immunofluorescent image analysis demonstrated trapping of phospho-p38 MAPK in the cytoplasm by MKP-1/CS/green fluorescent protein. ET-1-stimulated expression of COX-2 was increased in MKP-1/CS versus LacZ or green fluorescent protein-infected control cells. These results indicate that MKP-1 demonstrates a relative selectivity for p38α MAPK versus p38γ MAPK in GMC and is likely to indirectly regulate the expression of COX-2.

Investigations into possible signaling mechanisms involved in the regulation of COX-2 expression indicate that in 3T3 fibroblasts and human umbilical vein endothelial cells, activation of ERK1/2 by adenoviral delivery of constitutively active MEK1 induces the expression of COX-2. Additionally, human mesangial cells infected with adenovirus expressing constitutively active mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-3/6 and constitutively active mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-7 demonstrated that the p38 MAPK and JNK/SAPK, respectively, induce the COX-2 enzyme (6McGinty A.

Han J. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar, 10Shi Y Gaestel M. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 1519-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Several pharmacological antagonists (including SB 203580) are potent inhibitors of the α and β isoforms (11Lee J.C. Kassis S. Kumar S. Badger A. Adams J.L. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 82: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Activation of p38 MAPK occurs as a result of tyrosine and threonine phosphorylation within the TGY motif (9Ono K. Han J. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar). A downstream target of p38 MAPK includes MAPKAP-2, that when phosphorylated by p38 MAPK, translocates to the cytoplasm and phosphorylates HSP27 (12Ben-Levy R. Hooper S. Wilson R. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1049-1057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 13Engel K. Kotlyarov A. Gaestel M. EMBO. J. 1998; 17: 3363-3371Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Inactivation of p38 MAPK results from the coordinated removal of phosphates from tyrosine, threonine, or both residues (14Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. Faseb. J. 2000; 14: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). Although serine/threonine phosphatases such as PP2A members (15Alessi D.R. Gomez N. Moorhead G. Lewis T. Keyse S.M. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 283-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) or protein tyrosine phosphatases such as PTP-SL or STEP are capable of inactivating MAPK (16Pulido R. Zuniga A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7337-7350Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), it is also clear that a family of dual-specificity phosphatases (DSP), the mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatases (MKPs), are emerging as likely candidates for the negative regulation of MAPKs in vivo (14Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. Faseb. J. 2000; 14: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). The family of DSP includes ten members (14Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. Faseb. J. 2000; 14: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). Expression of DSP occurs in response to G protein-coupled agonists (17Duff J.L. Monia B.P. Berk B.C. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12890-12897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Although transcriptional regulation appears to be a primary mechanism of DSP expression (21Bokemeyer D. Sorokin A. Dunn M.J. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1997; 8: 40-50PubMed Google Scholar), subcellular localization of DSPs also may contribute to their regulation. For example, MKP-1 is a nuclear localized enzyme (22Brondello J.M. McKenzie F.R. Sun H. Tonks N.K. Pouyssegur J. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1895-1904PubMed Google Scholar), whereas MKP-3 is retained in the cytoplasm (23Groom L.A. Sneddon A.A. Alessi D.R. Dowd S. Keyse S.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3621-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). In addition, the phosphatase activity of MKP-3 is stimulated by binding of ERK to its N-terminal domain (24Muda M. Theodosiou A. Gillieron C. Smith A. Chabert C. Camps M. Boschert U. Rodrigues N. Davies K. Ashworth A. Arkinstall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9323-9329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Similarly, the catalytic activity of MKP-1 is increased by C-terminal binding of JNK1, ERK1/2, and p38α MAPK (25Slack D.N. Seternes O.M. Gabrielsen M. Keyse S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16491-16500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). These results indicate that substrate specificity is tightly linked with protein binding domains, which can have a significant impact on the catalytic activity of the DSP. The DSPs MKP-3 and M3/6 appear to demonstrate selectivity toward ERK and p38 MAPK, respectively (26Muda M. Theodosiou A. Rodrigues N. Boschert U. Camps M. Gillieron C. Davies K. Ashworth A. Arkinstall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27205-27208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), whereas MKP-1 has been reported to inactivate target kinases including ERK, SAPK/JNK, and p38 MAPK (27Chu Y. Solski P.A. Khosravi-Far R. Der C.J. Kelly K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6497-6501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 28Franklin C.C. Kraft A.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 4568-4575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The reasons for these observations are unclear but may partially rely on the cell type and experimental stimulus used to activate the respective MAPK pathways. Previously, we found that ET-1 induced the expression of MKP-1 in a time frame compatible with a model for negative feedback control of ERK1/2 activation (30Foschi M. Chari S. Dunn M.J. Sorokin A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6439-6451Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). However, those studies failed to address the potential role of other MAPK pathways in regulating the expression of COX-2. Therefore, the present work utilizes adenoviral delivery of wild type and a catalytically inactive, “substrate trapping” mutant of MKP-1 to determine their potential role in regulating the MAPKs, ERK1/2 and p38, and COX-2 expression in glomerular mesangial cells in response to ET-1 treatment (31Flint A.J. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Additionally, studies were performed with inhibitors of MEK and p38 MAPK to determine the importance of these MAPK pathways for ET-1-stimulated expression of COX-2. Our findings provide initial evidence for a substrate specificity of MKP-1 for p38α MAPK but not p38γ MAPK and demonstrate that alteration in the localization of active p38 MAPK by the catalytically inactive form of MKP-1 can result in enhanced expression of COX-2. Based on these results and those of earlier studies, we have proposed a model for DSP regulation of p38-dependent COX-2 regulation in glomerular mesangial cells. Reagents—Tissue culture media and reagents were from Invitrogen. Purified human ET-1 was from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. [γ-32P]ATP and [32P]orthophosphate were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. BCA protein assay kit was from Pierce. 4′-6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was from Sigma. Cell Culture and Transfection—Primary RMCs were cultured from isolated glomeruli from male Sprague-Dawley rats as described previously (32Simonson M.S. Dunn M.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 187: 544-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Mesangial cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing HEPES (25 mm) and supplemented with 17% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 5 μg/ml each insulin and transferrin, and 5 ng/ml selenium at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 95% air/5% CO2. For some experiments, a transformed human mesangial cell line was used and cultured in RPMI 1640 containing HEPES (25 mm) and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and incubated under the same conditions as RMC. Cells were typically cultured in 60- or 100-mm Petri dishes and serum-starved for 48 h prior to the addition of stimulus. Antibodies and Plasmid Vectors—Rabbit polyclonal phospho-MAPK, phospho-p38 antibodies, and phospho-HSP27 were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Mouse anti-phospho p38 MAPK antibodies were from Sigma. Goat polyclonal antibodies against COX-2 (N20) and p38 (C20) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies against p38γ MAPK were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to MKP-1 were produced by immunizing rabbits with a synthetic peptide derived from the C terminus of the protein (21Bokemeyer D. Sorokin A. Dunn M.J. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1997; 8: 40-50PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal antibodies against the FLAG epitope were from Sigma and were used for immunoprecipitation of p38-FLAG. Mouse monoclonal antibodies recognizing the hemagglutinin epitope (HA) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) were used for immunoprecipitation of HA-ERK. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies recognizing HSP27 were from Stressgen (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). Goat anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) conjugated to TRITC were used as the secondary antibody for detection of p38 and p38-HA, respectively. MKP-1 was mutated to the catalytically inactive form as follows. The cDNA encoding wild type MKP-1 was mutated using the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (Clontech). In position 1006, thymidine was changed to adenine resulting in the substitution of serine for cysteine. The mutation was confirmed by manual sequencing using Sequenase version 2.0 (United States Biochemical, Cleveland, OH). The primers used for mutagenesis were as follows: catalytic domain, 5′-GTGTTTGTCCCACAGCCAGGCAGGC-3′; NotI site introduced for selection, 5′-CCGAGCTCCGAGGCCGCCTGCTG-3′. The cDNA encoding wild type MKP-1 and MKP-1/CS was digested with KpnI and PvuII and ligated into pEGFP(N3) vector (Clonetech) to create the 67-kDa fusion protein. HA-ERK was a kind gift from Dr. Joseph Barbieri (Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI), and HA-p38 was a kind gift from Dr. Steven Keyse (Biomedical Research Centre, Dundee, Scotland). Construction of Adenoviral Recombinant MKP-1/CS and Infection of Primary Rat Mesangial Cells—The recombinant adenoviral vectors AdvCMVMKP-1/CS and AdvCMVMKP-1 were constructed according to a method described previously (30Foschi M. Chari S. Dunn M.J. Sorokin A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6439-6451Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Briefly, cDNA encoding MKP-1/CS or MKP-1 was digested with KpnI and XhoI and cloned into pCA3 shuttle vector for homologous recombination in HEK 293 cells. Linearized plasmid was cotransfected with ClaI-digested Ad-dl327 using HEK 293 cells. Individual plaques resulting from virion formation were isolated and amplified in HEK 293 cells, and viral DNA was isolated (33Hirt B. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 26: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (3352) Google Scholar) and analyzed for identification of recombinant viruses by HindIII DNA restriction analysis. High titer preparations (1 × 1010 to 1 × 1011 pfu/ml) were made using HEK 293 cells, and resultant viral DNA was purified by CsCl density gradient centrifugation (34Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar). Purified viral DNA was dialyzed and stored at -70 °C in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol until used. Virus titer was determined by plaque assay using HEK 293 cells (34Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar). In Vitro Transcription/Translation and Immunoprecipitation—Enhanced GFP and wild type MKP-1/GFP were subcloned into pcDNA 3.1 (+). ERK2 was subcloned into pBKII. 4.5 μg of each plasmid was transcribed and translated using the Promega TnT kit. Equal volumes of [35S]methionine-labeled proteins were mixed and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG or anti-HA antibody followed by electrophoretic separation on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and labeled proteins were detected by autoradiography. Metabolic Labeling, Cell Lysis, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblot Analysis—Cell labeling was performed essentially as described (35Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). Metabolic labeling of RMC was performed by incubating cells in phosphate-free RPMI 1640 supplemented with 0.5 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for 3 h at 37 °C. After stimulation with ET-1 for the appropriate time, the labeling solution was removed and discarded. The cells were lysed as described previously (30Foschi M. Chari S. Dunn M.J. Sorokin A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6439-6451Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) after stimulation. Cells were lysed for 20 min at 4 °C in 500 μl of Triton lysis buffer containing the following (in mm): HEPES (50Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar), pH 7.5, NaCl (150), MgCl2 (1.5), EGTA (1Noble S.L. King D.S. Olutade J.I. Am. Fam. Physician. 2000; 61: 3669-3676PubMed Google Scholar), 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, protease inhibitor mixture, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1Noble S.L. King D.S. Olutade J.I. Am. Fam. Physician. 2000; 61: 3669-3676PubMed Google Scholar), sodium orthovanadate (0.2), and sodium fluoride (10Shi Y Gaestel M. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 1519-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were collected in microcentrifuge tubes and cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were then resolved by SDS-PAGE for Western blot analysis or subjected to immunoprecipitation. Cells lysates, normalized for protein, were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against MKP-1 for 1.5 h at 4 °C with constant rotation. Protein A-Sepharose was added, and the lysates were incubated for an additional 1 h. After washing the immunoprecipitates three times in Triton lysis buffer, 2× Laemmli sample buffer was added, and the samples were boiled for 5 min, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). After transfer of proteins, the PVDF membrane was blocked with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing the following: 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, and 3% bovine serum albumin (United States Biochemical, Cleveland, OH) for 2 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies were added, and the membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with constant rotation. The following day the membranes were washed five times with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 followed by two washes with TBS prior to the addition of secondary antibodies. Secondary antibodies were diluted in TBS containing 5% non-fat dry milk and incubated with the membrane for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were again washed five times with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and twice with TBS prior to development of immunoreactive signal by chemiluminescence. Immunofluorescence and Digital Imaging—Human mesangial cells were plated to 60-mm dishes prior to transfection. The cells were transfected the following day with a total of 4 μg of cDNA using LipofectAMINE. The following day the cells were plated to 4-well glass chamber slides. The next day the cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4, for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were washed three times with PBS and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were washed once for 5 min with PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20 and incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% normal goat serum. The following day the primary antibodies were removed, and the cells were washed three times over 15 min with PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20. The cells were then incubated for 1 h with secondary antibody in PBS containing 5% normal goat serum and 0.1% Tween 20. The cells were washed three times over 15 min with PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20 and once for 5 min with PBS. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (50 ng/ml) in PBS for 5 min. The cells were washed once with PBS, a coverslip was mounted, fluorescence was detected, and images were taken using a Nikon Eclipse microscope (model E600) with an RT Slider SPOT CCD camera and Spot Advanced imaging software. Differential Regulation of COX-2 Expression in Mesangial Cells Transduced with Wild Type or Catalytically Inactive MKP-1—ET-1-induced expression of COX-2 was determined in RMC infected with GFP, wild type, or catalytically-inactive MKP-1 (CS). COX-2 protein was increased after 4 h of treatment with ET-1 when compared with serum-restricted control cells (Fig. 1). Adenoviral delivery of wild type MKP-1 resulted in diminished basal and ET-1-induced expression of COX-2 whereas MKP-1/CS-infected cells had enhanced basal and ET-1-induced expression of COX-2. Notably, ET-1 stimulated an increase in adenoviral delivered MKP-1 at 4 h when compared with control. The reason for this increase is unclear at present, although evidence from other laboratories indicates that the turnover of MKP-1 may be slowed in an ERK-dependent manner by phosphorylation of C-terminal serine residues of MKP-1 (36Brondello J.M. Brunet A. Pouyssegur J. McKenzie F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1368-1376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). There was no apparent change in the expression of the catalytically inactive MKP-1 mutant, suggesting that stabilization of this mutant with an activated (i.e. phosphorylated) substrate may protect it from degradation. Constitutively active members of the MEKs have been shown previously (6McGinty A. Foschi M. Chang Y.W. Han J. Dunn M.J. Sorokin A. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) to drive the expression of COX-2. Thus, experiments were conducted to determine whether inhibition of MEK1/2, the upstream kinase for ERK1/2, and/or inhibition of p38 MAPK could account for the observed ET-1-induced increase in COX-2 expression. The MEK1/2 inhibitor, U0126, completely inhibited the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in response to ET-1 in RMC at 5 and 10 μm (Fig. 2, top panel) but had no effect on the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK (Fig. 2, middle panel). Furthermore, U0126 had no effect on the phosphorylation of HSP27, an indirect measure of p38 MAPK activity (Fig. 2, bottom panel) (9Ono K. Han J. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar). To support this, we found that SB 203580, a direct inhibitor of p38 MAPK (11Lee J.C. Kassis S. Kumar S. Badger A. Adams J.L. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 82: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), blocked ET-1-stimulated phosphorylation of HSP27 at 10 μm with little additional effect at 25 μm (Fig. 2, bottom panel). SB 203580 had no effect on the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 at either concentration tested (Fig. 2, top panel). Once the concentrations of inhibitors to achieve specificity were determined, their effects on ET-1-stimulated expression of COX-2 were examined. Expression of COX-2 in RMC pretreated with either U0126 or SB 203580 alone was reduced when compared with control cells (Fig. 3A). Combined treatment of RMC with U0126 and SB 203580 resulted in COX-2 expression that was only slightly less than either inhibitor used alone (Fig. 3B). Taken together, these data suggest that ET-1 stimulates the expression of COX-2 in an ERK1/2 and p38-dependent manner in RMC. Temporal Activation of ERK and p38 MAPK by ET-1 in Rat Mesangial Cells—Mutation of cysteine 258 to serine within the active site of MKP-1 was shown previously (35Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar) to stabilize its association with one of its proposed substrates, phospho-ERK. Thus, we examined ET-1-stimulated RMC labeled with [32P]orthophosphate to determine whether antibodies against MKP-1 might co-precipitate phosphorylated protein(s). Cell lysates from RMC infected with an adenovirus encoding MKP-1/CS co-precipitated a phosphoprotein using anti-MKP-1 antibodies (Fig. 4). Phosphorylation of this protein was enhanced by the addition of ET-1 in a time-dependent manner. The phosphoprotein detected was in the molecular weight range of the MAPKs, ERK1/ERK2 and p38 MAPK. To identify the MAPK that co-immunoprecipitated with catalytically inactive MKP-1, we first investigated the effects of the cysteine-to-serine mutant on ET-1-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK. We have demonstrated previously (30Foschi M. Chari S. Dunn M.J. Sorokin A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6439-6451Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) that recombinant adenovirus can deliver a gene of interest to 100% of primary RMC. Therefore, experiments were performed to determine whether MKP-1/CS could exert a dominant interfering effect on ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK signaling cascades in RMC and human mesangial cells (HMC). Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK were followed at several time points after the addition of ET-1. Parallel dishes of RMC and HMC were infected with an adenovirus encoding LacZ or GFP, as reporter genes for infection. RMC and HMC stimulated with ET-1 displayed biphasic kinetics of ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 5A, upper and lower panels, respectively). ERK1/2 phosphorylation was maximal at 5 min, returned to basal by 15 min, and was again phosphorylated within 4 h of ET-1 treatment in RMC and within 3 h of treatment in HMC. Adenoviral delivery of MKP-1/CS resulted in elevated basal phosphorylation of ERK1/2 with marginal enhancement of ERK1/2 phosphorylation in response to ET-1. In contrast, adenoviral delivery of MKP-1/CS greatly accentuated the basal and ET-1-stimulated phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in RMC and HMC (Fig. 5B, upper and lower panels, respectively). These results suggest that MKP-1/CS may stably interact with p38 MAPK to maintain its phosphorylated state. Adenoviral-delivered MKP-1 Attenuates ET-1-stimulated Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK—Because adenoviral delivery of MKP-1/CS resulted in a greater accentuation of basal and ET-1 stimulated phosphorylation of p38 MAPK than ERK1/2, we hypothesized that adenoviral delivery of the wild type form of MKP-1 would result in greater inhibition of basal and ET-1-stimulated phosphorylation of p38 MAPK. Fig. 6A demonstrates a partial inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation stimulated by ET-1 in HMC (lower panel) but not RMC (upper panel) infected with an adenovirus encoding wild type MKP-1 when compared with cells infected with GFP. However, ET-1-stimulated phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was ma"

In this study two antisense approaches were employed to down-regulate expression of the endogenous DAPK-α and DAPK-β proteins. Transient expression of an antisense DAPK cDNA or antisense morpholino oligonucleotides in HeLa, 3T3, or primary human vascular smooth muscle cells demonstrate that decreased DAPK expression promotes a spontaneous, caspase-mediated apoptosis as evidenced by increased activities of caspases-3 and -9. Clonal HeLa cell lines with attenuated levels of DAPK expression, obtained following selection in the presence of antisense DAPK cDNA, are more sensitive to tumor necrosis factor-induced caspase-mediated apoptosis, and their sensitivity is inversely related to DAPK expression. In contrast, HeLa cells with reduced DAPK expression are moderately resistant to cell death induced by interferon-γ. This finding is consistent with previous studies showing that DAPK has a role in promoting caspase-independent cell death. Together, these studies demonstrate that the cellular activities of DAPK are critical for antagonizing caspase-dependent apoptosis to promote cell survival under normal cell growth conditions.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar) and two mouse DAPK forms DAPK-α and DAPK-β have been described (1Jin Y. Blue E.K. Dixon S. Hou L. Wysolmerski R.B. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39667-39678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). DAPK-β is an alternatively spliced isoform of DAPK-α, with a carboxyl-terminal 12-amino acid extension. The human DAPK, which is the counterpart to mouse DAPK-α, was originally cloned using a technical knockout approach that involved expression of an antisense cDNA library in HeLa cells treated for 28 days with interferon-γ (IFN-γ) (4Deiss L.P. Feinstein E. Berissi H. Cohen O. Kimchi A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). This selection was used to identify novel pro-apoptotic factors and one of the antisense cDNA fragments encoded DAPK. These results and others have lead to a paradigm in which DAPK plays a central role as a pro-apoptotic factor (2Cohen O. Feinstein E. Kimchi A.

Cytokine Netw. 2002; 13: 398-400PubMed Google Scholar).In contrast to the studies supporting the role of DAPK is a pro-apoptotic factor, the results of other studies challenge this paradigm and raise the possibility that DAPK can also act as an anti-apoptotic factor, depending on the apoptotic stimuli. For example, the original antisense DAPK cDNA fragment that protected cells from IFN-γ-induced cell death has not been found to be effective in protecting cells from TNF-induced apoptosis (4Deiss L.P. Feinstein E. Berissi H. Cohen O. Kimchi A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 8Jang C.W. Chen C.H. Chen C.C. Chen J.Y. Su Y.H. Chen R.H. Nat. Cell.

Chem. 2001; 276: 39667-39678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) that overexpression of DAPK-α has a weak survival effect whereas DAPK-β confers a strong protective effect to rescue Madin-Darby canine kidney and HeLa cells from TNF-induced apoptosis (1Jin Y.

DAPK is also found to be highly expressed in an active form in many non-apoptotic tissues such as brain cortex and hippocampus (9Sakagami H. Kondo H. Brain Res. Mol.

Acta. 2002; 1600: 128-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and DAPK has been suggested to have other functional roles such as regulating exocytosis of neurotransmitter release by phosphorylation of syntaxin-1 (12Tian J.H. Das S. Sheng Z.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; Google Scholar) and protecting neurons during development or recovery from hypoxic-ischemic injury (11Schumacher A.M. Velentza A.V. Watterson D.M. Wainwright M.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1600: 128-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition, DAPK expression is induced in a rat seizure model in regions of the brain that were not undergoing apoptosis (13Henshall D.C. Araki T. Schindler C.K. Shinoda S. Lan J.Q. Simon R.P. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 1260-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).Many of the studies supporting a pro-apoptotic paradigm for DAPK rely on the use of over-expression of wild type or mutant forms of DAPK (2Cohen O.

Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 6-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), but there are also examples where under normal growth conditions the over-expression of DAPK does not induce a caspase-dependent apoptosis (1Jin Y. Blue E.K. Dixon S. Hou L. Wysolmerski R.B. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39667-39678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 6Inbal B. Cohen O. Polak-Charcon S. Kopolovic J. Vadai E. Eisenbach L. Kimchi A. Nature. 1997; 390: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Previously, in our own studies we utilized either a transient or an inducible promoter system in which the expression of DAPK could be turned on or off and fine-tuned, but concerns about the effects of over-expression, as well as the potential for compensatory cellular alterations to occur during extended culture for selection of cell lines, prompted the current study where two antisense gene-silencing approaches were used to attenuate expression of the endogenous DAPK. In this study, we utilized both antisense cDNA transfection and morpholino oligonucleotides (M-oligonucleotides) to deplete expression of DAPK in a variety of cells, including primary smooth muscle cells. These studies show that depletion of DAPK expression promotes a caspase-dependent apoptosis in the absence of any overt apoptotic stimuli and thus suggests that the activities of DAPK are necessary for cell survival.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture, Antibodies, and Reagents—HeLa cells and NIH3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Primary human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMC) were purchased from Cascade Biologics (Portland, OR). These cells were cultured in medium 231 supplemented with smooth muscle growth supplement (Cascade Biologics) and differentiated by culturing in medium 231 supplemented with smooth muscle differentiation supplement (Cascade Biologics) for 3 days. The HASMC were used no later than passage five and maintained in differentiated state for 72 h before each experiment, to ensure the differentiated phenotype. Smooth muscle α-actin was detected using a monoclonal antibody (clone 1A4; Sigma) and served as a marker of smooth muscle cell differentiation.Total DAPK (DAPK-α and DAPK-β) was detected with a monoclonal (clone 17; BD Biosciences) antibody against human DAPK. Another antibody to specifically detect DAPK-β was produced by immunization of rabbits with a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-coupled synthetic peptide comprised of the sequence unique to the carboxyl terminus of DAPK-β (CRDSHAWTPLTDL). This antibody was shown by Western blotting and immunoprecipitation (not shown) to be specific for the β form and does not react with the α form of DAPK. Poly(ADP)ribose polymerase (PARP) antibody that recognizes both the full-length (116 kDa) and the caspase-cleaved fragment (89 kDa) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Human and mouse recombinant TNF were purchased from Calbiochem.Transfection and Generation of Stable Cell Lines—HeLa or 3T3 cells were transfected with a pcDNA3 plasmid (Invitrogen) encoding either mouse DAPK-α cDNA (GenBank™ accession number gi:29825682) or inverted, antisense orientation (bp 4910 to bp 1) mouse DAPK-α cDNA, using FuGENE 6 transfection reagents (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacture's protocol. The mRNA transcribed from the inverted DAPK-α is complementary to the endogenous DAPK mRNA, thus blocking translation of both DAPK-α and DAPK-β. Where indicated, pEGFP plasmid (Clontech) was co-transfected at a ratio of 1:5 to serve as a visual selection for transfected cells, which were identified by the expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP). Stable cell lines were cloned by seeding transfected cells at low density in medium containing G418 at concentrations of 500 μg/ml. Individual colonies were amplified and tested for DAPK expression by Western blotting.Antisense DAPK Oligonucleotides—DAPK-α/β antisense M-oligonucleotides (GeneTools LLC, Philomath, OR) (18Summerton J. Weller D. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 1997; 7: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar, 19Summerton J. Stein D. Huang S.B. Matthews P. Weller D. Partridge M. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 1997; 7: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) were designed based upon the published mouse (5′-CCACGTTTTCCTGCCTGAACACAGT-3′) and human (5′-CGTTTTCCTGAACACGGTCAT-3′) DAPK cDNA sequences and correspond to the region near the 5′ translational start site of the DAPK open reading frame for each species. A random, scrambled M-oligonucleotide was used as control. For experiments, cells were seeded in 6-well dishes and 24 h later were treated with or without the DAPK-α/β antisense M-oligonucleotides. The M-oligonucleotides were mixed with ethoxylated polyethylenimine (Gene Tools) and delivered into cells according to the manufacture's protocol, which resulted in >98% transfection efficiency as determined by including control fluorescinated oligonucleotides. Dose response experiments were performed by varying the amount of DAPK and control M-oligonucleotides to achieve a final concentration of 2 μm. DAPK expression levels were evaluated by Western blotting to determine the optimal M-oligonucleotide concentration necessary to achieve maximum gene silencing at 24 h after transfection by collecting floating and adherent cells and preparing cell lysates for Western blotting analysis.Analysis of Apoptosis—Quantification of apoptotic cell death was performed as described previously (1Jin Y. Blue E.K. Dixon S. Hou L. Wysolmerski R.B. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39667-39678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, at the indicated times, viable, attached cells were identified using trypan blue exclusion and counted. The extent of apoptosis is defined as (the number of control cells – the number of treated cells)/(the number of control cells). Apoptosis was also quantified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of DNA fragmentation in cells fixed with 95% ethanol and 5% acetic acid at –20 °C and stained with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) on a FACStar plus flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).Caspase Activity Assays—For measurement of caspase activity in vivo, both adherent and floating cells were collected and lysed with CHAPS lysis buffer (0.1% CHAPS, 100 mm NaCl, 100 μm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). After centrifugation, equal amounts of total cellular proteins were incubated at 37 °C, and the assay was initiated by addition of 200 μm Ac-IETD-pNA (caspase-8), 200 μm Ac-DEVD-pNA (caspase-3), or 200 μm Ac-LEHD-pNA (caspase-9). Change in absorbance at 405 nm versus time was monitored by spectrophotometry, and caspase activities (pmol/min/mg total protein) were calculated after subtraction of background, using pure p-nitroanilline for calibration of a standard curve. For every cell sample, the background was determined by adding the caspase-specific inhibitors, Ac-IETD-CHO (caspase-8), Ac-DEVD-CHO (caspase-3), or Ac-LEHD-CHO (caspase-9) as negative control.Western Blotting and Immunofluorescence—Western blotting and indirect immunofluorescence were performed as described previously (20Jin Y. Atkinson S.J. Marrs J.A. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 30: 30Google Scholar). Where indicated, vinculin was detected and used as control for loading. All densitometry analysis of Western blotting data was normalized to vinculin levels.Data Analysis—All experiments were performed at least three times. All statistic analysis and graphs were created using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Western blotting and immunofluorescence images are representative of the repeated experiments, and all panels have been treated identically. Significance (*) as determined by Student's t test (GraphPad Prism Software) was accepted at p ≤ 0.01.RESULTSAntisense DAPK cDNA Reduces Expression of Endogenous DAPK—To examine the function of endogenous DAPK, expression vectors with DAPK-α either in the sense (DAPK) or antisense (AS-DAPK-α) orientation were generated and transfected into HeLa or 3T3 cells, together with the pEGFP plasmid encoding GFP, to identify transfected cells. Control cells were also transfected with a vector encoding β-galactosidase (LacZ). The RNA transcribed from the AS-DAPK-α plasmid was expected to block the translation of the total endogenous pool of DAPK, including both DAPK-α and DAPK-β. DAPK-β represents an alternative splice variant of DAPK-α with an additional 36-bp exon, which extends the extreme carboxyl terminus of the protein by 12 residues but is otherwise identical to DAPK-α (1Jin Y. Blue E.K. Dixon S. Hou L. Wysolmerski R.B. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39667-39678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A shows representative immunofluorescence micrographs of HeLa cells transfected with plasmids encoding LacZ (Control), sense DAPK, or AS-DAPK. The monoclonal anti-DAPK antibody used to detect the expression of DAPK recognizes both the recombinant DAPK-α and the endogenous DAPK, which includes both DAPK-α and DAPK-β. GFP-positive cells transfected with AS-DAPK-α plasmid have a visible reduction in the intensity of DAPK fluorescence confirming that the AS-DAPK-α plasmid was able to decrease the endogenous DAPK level, whereas the sense DAPK plasmid increased the overall level of expression of DAPK. Similar results were seen in 3T3 cells (not shown). In another experiment, HeLa cells were transfected with vectors for expression of sense DAPK, AS-DAPK-α, or a LacZ expression vector. At 24 h following transfection, the cells were treated with G418 for 1 week to enrich for transfected cells. Western blotting of whole cell extracts was performed to detect the expression levels of total DAPK (DAPK-α+β) or DAPK-β prepared from this enriched cell population, and a representative blot is shown in Fig. 1B. In HeLa cells transfected with AS-DAPK-α plasmid, both total DAPK and DAPK-β expression levels were reduced, suggesting that as expected this AS-DAPK-α plasmid can deplete expression of both forms of DAPK. In cells transfected with sense DAPK-α plasmid, the total DAPK level increased, reflecting over-expression of DAPK-α, and the expression of DAPK-β was not affected. Although there is no antibody that is specific for DAPK-α, our previous studies using RNase protection analysis have determined that both 3T3 and HeLa cells have similar mRNA levels of each isoform (1Jin Y. Blue E.K. Dixon S. Hou L. Wysolmerski R.B. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39667-39678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Based on these results it is reasonable to conclude that the antisense RNA produced from the AS-DAPK-α plasmid is equally effective for blocking the expression of both DAPK-α and DAPK-β.Because our previous data suggested that DAPK has a cytoprotective role, we asked whether the expression of this kinase is essential for cell survival. If this is true, then depletion of DAPK below a critical level might spontaneously induce apoptosis. This would, however, make the selection of cells with very low levels of DAPK impossible unless compensatory events had occurred. To circumvent this possibility, FACS was used to enrich for cells transiently expressing AS-DAPK-α cDNA, while simultaneously analyzing DNA fragmentation as a measure of caspase-dependent apoptosis. For this experiment, 3T3 and HeLa cells were co-transfected with pEGFP and either sense or antisense DAPK-α plasmid, at a ratio of 1:5. A vector for expression of LacZ was used in the control transfections. At 16 h following transfection all the floating and attached cells were collected, and the GFP-positive cells were analyzed to determine the levels of DNA fragmentation using propidium iodide staining of DNA. Fig. 2A shows DNA content histograms of GFP-positive cells. Cells with sub-G1 DNA content (indicated by the gated region) representing apoptotic cells with fragmented DNA were quantified. This experiment shows that in the absence of apoptotic stimulus, GFP-positive cells transfected with AS-DAPK-α have dramatically increased levels of apoptosis (55% for HeLa and 88% for 3T3), compared with control cells (18% for HeLa and 9% for 3T3). Consistent with our previous results, expression of DAPK from the sense plasmid does not induce apoptosis in transfected cells.Fig. 2Antisense depletion of DAPK induces spontaneous apoptosis.A, flow cytometry analysis of DNA content (propidium iodide staining) in antisense DAPK transfected cells. HeLa or 3T3 cells were co-transfected with GFP and sense DAPK-α or antisense (AS) DAPK-α plasmid at ratios of 1:5. Control cells were co-transfected with GFP and LacZ. Only GFP-positive cells were selected and analyzed. Percentages of cells gated with sub-G1 DNA were quantified. B, Western blot of total DAPK (DAPK-α+β) or DAPK-β, PARP, and vinculin (loading control) in transfected 3T3 or HeLa cells as described for A. GFP-positive cells were enriched by FACS of transfected cells. Data shown are representative of four independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Total protein extracts from the GFP-positive cells were prepared by collecting and lysing the sorted cells directly into SDS lysis buffer. Lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting to determine the expression levels of DAPK (Fig. 2B). Antisense DAPK-α transfected 3T3 cells have undetectable levels of DAPK, either total DAPK (DAPK-α+β) or DAPK-β. Activation of effector caspases such as caspase-3 was determined by examining the levels of full-length PARP and the caspase-cleaved form having a mass of 89 kDa. As shown in Fig. 2B, antisense depletion of DAPK resulted in increased levels of PARP cleavage suggesting that caspases (e.g. caspase-3) that cleave PARP have been activated in both 3T3 and HeLa cells. In contrast for both cell lines, transfection with sense DAPK-α increased total DAPK-α protein but not DAPK-β levels, with no resulting, detectable cleavage of PARP. This is consistent with our previous studies, which showed that expression of DAPK-α does not initiate a caspase-dependent apoptosis in the absence of pro-apoptotic stimuli (1Jin Y. Blue E.K. Dixon S. Hou L. Wysolmerski R.B. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39667-39678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).To examine the effect of reduced DAPK expression on apoptosis in primary cultured smooth muscle cells, M-oligonucleotides complementary to the mRNA sequence flanking the start AUG codon of human DAPK were synthesized and delivered into differentiated HASMC using an ethoxylated polyethylenimine transfection reagent (21Morcos P.A. Genesis. 2001; 30: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Similar to the antisense plasmids described above, the antisense M-oligonucleotides were predicted to block translation of both DAPK-α and DAPK-β because of the overlap and identity of the sequences encoding these two proteins. Mixtures of antisense DAPK and random scrambled (control) M-oligonucleotides were prepared as indicated to result in a 2 μm final concentration. At 36 h posttransfection the adherent and floating HASMC were collected and examined by Western blotting to detect expression of DAPK. A representative blot, shown in Fig. 3A, revealed that the antisense M-oligonucleotides were effective in depleting expression of DAPK in HASMC in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment of primary HASMC with a mixture containing 2 μm antisense DAPK oligonucleotides reduced the DAPK expression level to ∼10% of that found in cells treated with an M-oligonucleotide mixture containing only control oligonucleotides. In addition there was an increase in non-adherent floating cells, as well as an increase in the number of adherent HASMC with apoptotic morphology that included blebbing cells, and cells with condensed cytoplasm and nuclei (not shown). The levels of spontaneous apoptosis in the cells treated with 1 or 2 μm antisense M-oligonucleotides were 14 ± 3 and 34 ± 7%, respectively, and were significantly higher than control M-oligonucleotide-treated HASMC (2 ± 1%; see Fig. 3B). Consistent with this being a caspase-dependent apoptosis, there was also a significant, dose-dependent increase in PARP cleavage (Fig. 3A). To confirm this, HASMC were treated with 2 μm antisense DAPK M-oligonucleotides. Control cells were treated with 2 μm control M-oligonucleotides. Following treatment for 24 h, both adherent and floating cells were collected, and caspase activities were measured. Antisense M-oligonucleotide-treated HASMC have significantly higher levels of caspase-3 (88 ± 22 versus 5 ± 2 units/mg) and caspase-9 (18 ± 2 versus 1.5 ± 1 units/mg) activities as compared with control cells. Caspase-8 activities are not significantly different in control cells and antisense M-oligonucleotide-transfected cells, suggesting the depletion of DAPK activates signaling events downstream of caspase-8 that lead to the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3.Fig. 3Loss of DAPK expression induces apoptosis in differentiated HASMC.A, Western blot showing the levels of total DAPK (DAPK-α+β) and PARP in HASMC treated with varying concentration of antisense DAPK M-oligonucleotides (AS M-Oligo). A total of 2 μm oligonucleotides was transfected in each experiment by addition of control M-oligonucleotides. The blot is representative of three independent experiments. B, quantification of apoptosis in HASMC treated with AS or control M-oligonucleotides. Levels of apoptosis were determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” C, analysis of caspase activity. For each experiment, at 24 h post-transfection with AS or control M-oligonucleotides (2 μm) cells were lysed, and caspase activity was determined by quantitating cleavage of IETD-pNA (Caspase-8), LEHD-pNA (Caspase-9), or DEVD-pNA (Caspase-3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Clonal Cell Lines Expressing Antisense DAPK cDNA—Mouse 3T3 cells transfected with control LacZ or a sense or antisense plasmid encoding DAPK-α were subjected to G418 selection for 7 days. Isolated G418-positive clones were amplified and examined for DAPK expression. Fig. 4A shows Western blots of total DAPK (DAPK-α+β) and DAPK-β in five independent 3T3 clones, which have variable expression levels of DAPK. The five clonal cell lines (AS3 through AS7) expressing an antisense DAPK-α cDNA all have reduced levels of total DAPK expression ranging from 11–69% of the levels in the parental LacZ-positive control (Cont) clonal cell line. As expected for this antisense cDNA, the decrease in total DAPK was paralleled by an equivalent decrease in the expression level of DAPK-β. To assess the effect of reduced endogenous DAPK on apoptosis, these clonal cell lines were treated with TNF (10 ng/ml) and cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) to induce apoptosis. Control cells were treated with cycloheximide only. After 4 h, apoptosis was measured by cell counting as described under “Materials and Methods.” The control cell line that expresses LacZ has 41% apoptosis, a level that is comparable with apoptosis measured in parental 3T3 cells (Fig. 4B). Cells with reduced expression of DAPK, because of expression of antisense DAPK-α, had a significantly increased sensitivity to TNF as evidenced by an increased level of apoptotic cells (ranging from 59 to 84%) after 4 h of TNF treatment. A correlation between the relative levels of total DAPK or DAPK-β and the TNF apoptotic sensitivity reveals that there was an inverse relationship between DAPK expression and apoptosis (Fig. 4C). This result is consistent with ou"

One of the more commonly occurring types of protein damage is deamidation; the conversion of asparagines into aspartyls and isoaspartyls. The physiological significance of isoaspartyl formation is emphasized by the presence of the conserved enzyme l-isoaspartyl O-methyltransferase (PIMT), whose physiological function appears to be in preventing the accumulation of deamidated proteins. Seemingly consistent with a repair function, overexpression of PIMT in Drosophila melanogaster extends lifespan under conditions expected to contribute to protein damage. Based on structural information and sequence homology we have created mutants of residues proposed to be involved in co-factor binding in Escherichia coli PIMT. Both mutants retain S-adenosyl l-methionine binding capabilities but demonstrate dramatically reduced kinetic capabilities, perhaps suggestive of catalytic roles beyond co-factor binding. As anticipated, overexpression of the wild type enzyme in E. coli results in bacteria with increased tolerance to thermal stress. Surprisingly, even greater levels of heat tolerance were observed with overexpression of the inactive PIMT mutants. The increased survival capabilities observed with overexpression of PIMT in E. coli, and possibly in Drosophila, are not due to increased isoaspartyl repair capabilities but rather a temperature-independent induction of the heat shock system as a result of overexpression of a misfolding-prone protein. An alternate hypothesis as to the physiological substrate and function of l-isoaspartyl methyltransferase is proposed.

Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1987; 30: 808-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The metamorphosis of asparagine and aspartate residues is initiated by the nucleophilic attack of the neighboring peptide nitrogen on the side chain carbonyl, resulting in the cyclization of the side chain with the main chain to the formation of a succinimide ring (Fig. 1) (2Clarke S. Stephenson R.C. Lowenson J.D. Ahren T.J. Manning M.C. Stability of Protein Pharmaceuticals: Chemical and Physical Pathways of Protein Degradation. Plenum Press, New York1992: 1-29Google Scholar). Succinimides are unstable intermediates that undergo rapid, nonenzymatic hydrolysis to a mixture of aspartyl and isoaspartyl residues. Isoaspartyls typically account for two-thirds of the emerging products and with the introduction of an extra carbon into the main chain have the greater potential for disruption of protein structure and biological activity (2Clarke S. Stephenson R.C. Lowenson J.D. Ahren T.J. Manning M.C. Stability of Protein Pharmaceuticals: Chemical and Physical Pathways of Protein Degradation. Plenum Press, New York1992: 1-29Google Scholar). The precise ratio of the aspartyl and isoaspartyl products is determined by the accessibility of the succinimide carbonyls to attacking water or hydroxide molecules; attack at the main chain carbonyl produces isoaspartyls, whereas attack at the side chain carbonyl produces aspartyls. The α-carbon of a succinimide is also prone to racemization, resulting in the D-configurations of these amino acids, although at low yields (3Geiger T. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 785-794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological significance of isoaspartyl formation is emphasized by the presence of an enzyme, l-isoaspartyl O-methyltransferase (PIMT) 1The abbreviations used are: PIMTl-isoaspartyl O-methyltransferaseAdoMetS-adenosyl l-methionineHPrhistidine-containing proteinCAPS3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acidHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatography.1The abbreviations used are: PIMTl-isoaspartyl O-methyltransferaseAdoMetS-adenosyl l-methionineHPrhistidine-containing proteinCAPS3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acidHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatography. whose function appears to be in limiting the accumulation of isoaspartyl-containing proteins within the cell. PIMT is a highly conserved enzyme found in a wide variety of organisms, including plants (4Urao T. Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Dhinozaki K. Trends Plant Sci. 2000; 5: 67-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), insects (5Kagan R.M. McFadden H.J. McFadden P.N. O'Conner C. Clarke S. Comp. Biochem. Pysiol. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 117: 379-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), bacteria (6Gross R. Arico B. Rappuoli R. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 1661-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and mammals (7O'Connor C.M. Clarke S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 132: 1144-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), that has the ability to specifically recognize and methylate isoaspartyl residues in a variety of peptide and protein contexts (1Clarke S. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1987; 30: 808-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 2Clarke S. Stephenson R.C. Lowenson J.D. Ahren T.J. Manning M.C. Stability of Protein Pharmaceuticals: Chemical and Physical Pathways of Protein Degradation. Plenum Press, New York1992: 1-29Google Scholar). PIMT catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) to the α-carboxyl of the l-isoaspartyl group, methylation stimulates reformation of the succinimide, and subsequent hydrolysis converts a fraction of the offending residues to aspartyls. The overall reaction therefore represents true repair when the isoaspartyl results from an isomerized aspartyl and only partial repair of a deamidated asparagine. Because only a fraction of the isoaspartyls are converted to aspartyls with each round of methylation-induced succinimide formation, complete repair requires numerous rounds of cycling utilizing an energetically expensive methyl group donor, making the “repair” reaction quite inefficient. l-isoaspartyl O-methyltransferase S-adenosyl l-methionine histidine-containing protein 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid high pressure liquid chromatography. l-isoaspartyl O-methyltransferase S-adenosyl l-methionine histidine-containing protein 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid high pressure liquid chromatography. Genetic studies of the physiological role of PIMT in lower organism have not been clearly supportive of a repair function. In Caenorhabditis elegans, mutants having a disruption of the gene show poor Dauer stage survival, but substrate for the enzyme was found primarily in peptide fragments in both the wild type and PIMT-deficient organisms, suggesting that damaged proteins are cleared by proteolysis rather than repair (8Niewmierzycka A. Clarke S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 364: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). An Escherichia coli strain deficient in PIMT did not exhibit greater susceptibility to conditions anticipated to promote deamidation but did demonstrate increased sensitivity to changing conditions in the stationary phase (9Visick J.E. Cai H. Clarke S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2623-2628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic studies in higher organisms are more supportive of a repair function for PIMT. Mice lacking PIMT show an accumulation of damaged proteins, particularly in the brain; display abnormal brain activity; and suffer fatal seizures at an early age (10Kim E. Lowenson J.D. Maclaren D.C. Clarke S. Young S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6132-6137Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Consistent with the hypothesis that the accumulation of isoaspartyl-containing proteins can be limiting to lifespan, overexpression of PIMT in Drosophila melanogaster extends the lifespan by 32-39% under conditions that accelerate the rates of deamidation, suggesting that PIMT activity is limiting in these situations (11Chavous D.A. Jackson F.R. O'Connor C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14814-14818Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The ability of overexpression of a protein to extend lifespan is rare but not unprecedented. In particular, overexpression of enzymes that function in protein repair have been shown to prolong lifespan, supportive of the hypothesis that senescence results from a decline in cellular repair processes (12Knight J.A. Adv. Clin. Chem. 2000; 35: 1-62Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Examples include the limiting of the accumulation of potentially damaging agents, as with superoxide dismutase (13Orr W.C. Sohal R.S. Science. 1994; 263: 1128-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar), as well as general protein repair systems, such as the heat shock proteins (14Tatar M. Khazaeli A.A. Curtsinger J.W. Nature. 1997; 390: 30Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The ability for overexpression of these proteins to increase longevity is presumably due to an increased capacity to deal with damaged or misfolded proteins that limit the lifespan of the organism. Recently, crystallographic structures of PIMT have been determined from human (15Ryttersgaard C. Griffith S.C. Sawaya M.R. MacLaren D.C. Clarke S. Yeates T.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10642-10646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), Thermotoga maritima (16Skinner M.M. Puvathingal J.M. Walter R.L. Friedman A.M. Structure Fold Des. 2000; 8: 1189-1201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and Pyrococcus furiosus (17Griffith S.C. Sawaya M.R. Boutz D.R. Thapar N. Katz J.E. Clarke S. Yeates T.O. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 1103-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). All three show high similarity in their amino acid sequences as well as three-dimensional folds, which are characteristic of the AdoMet-dependent methyltransferase superfamily. Complexes of PIMT with AdoMet, as well as isoaspartyl-containing substrate, provide structural insights into the workings of this enzyme. A particularly interesting feature of co-factor binding in PIMT is the occurrence of two highly conserved, negatively charged residues buried in the interior of the protein within the AdoMet-binding pocket. These residues are Glu97 and Glu121 in P. furiosus, Asp83 and Asp109 in human, and Glu82 and Glu108 in T. maritima. The side chain carboxyl of the first acidic residue interacts with the α-carbon amino group of AdoMet, and the side chain carboxyl of the second acidic residue hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyls of the ribose. Similar interactions between protein and co-factor have been reported for other AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases (18Bussiere D.E. Muchmore S.W. Dealwis C.G. Schluckebeir G. Nienaber V.L.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8323-8333Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Although the precise role of these acidic residues has not been determined, given their conservation and atypical positioning, it seems likely that they play an important role in the reaction cycle. The electrostatic contribution of these residues might be toward the energetics of substrate and/or co-factor binding or perhaps playing a more direct role in catalysis. Notably, prior to the reaction, the isoaspartyl substrate has a negatively charged carboxyl group, and the AdoMet co-factor has a positively charged sulfonium; upon completion of the reaction, both of these charged groups are neutralized. Based on sequence alignments, the corresponding residues in E. coli PIMT are Glu81 and Glu104 (Fig. 2). In this investigation we examine the role of Glu81 and Glu104 in the catalytic mechanism of E. coli PIMT, as well as the ability of PIMT overexpression in E. coli to protect cells in conditions where the accumulation of damaged proteins may limit survival. Cloning and Purification of E. coli l-Isoaspartyl O-Methyltransferase—Two oligonucleotide primers were designed based on the E. coli pcm gene sequence (22June C. Ding L. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14562-14572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to allow for amplification of the full-length gene from E. coli genomic DNA. The 5′ primer (5′-CGGCGGCATATGGTAAGCAGACGC-3′) overlaps the ATG initiation codon (underlined) of the pcm gene and was designed to include a NdeI restriction site (shown in bold type). The 3′ primer (5′-CGGATCCTCACGTTTTAAGCC-3′) incorporates a BamHI restriction site (shown in bold type). PCR amplification using a single colony of E. coli as template for a total of 25 cycles resulted in a single product of the appropriate size as detected by agarose gel electrophoresis. The PCR product was purified and ligated into the pT7 vector using the pT7 Perfectly Blunt cloning kit (Novagen). The resulting plasmid DNA was digested with NdeI and BamHI, and the insert DNA was ligated into the pet15b plasmid under the control of the T7 promoter with the incorporation of an N-terminal His6 tag. The complete sequence of the gene and correct incorporation into the plasmid was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis with mutations being confirmed by DNA sequencing. Overexpression of all proteins was carried out in Tuner (DE3) pLysS cells. At mid-log phase growth in 1.5 liters of Terrific Broth (100 μg/ml ampicillin, 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol) at 37 °C, the cultures were induced with 0.5 mm isopropylthiogalactoside and grown for an additional 3 h. The cells were harvested and sonicated as previously described (23Anderson J.W. Bhanot P. Georges F. Klevit R.E. Waygood E.B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9601-9607Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Crude lysate was diluted 2-fold in buffer B (50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, pH 8.0) and applied to a nickel column equilibrated with buffer B. The column was washed with three column volumes of buffer B, followed by three column volumes of buffer W (50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, pH 8.0). The proteins were eluted with buffer E (50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, pH 8.0), and 20-ml fractions were collected. Protein-containing fractions were determined by SDS-PAGE, and purity was estimated to be greater than 95%. PIMT-containing fractions were pooled, and myoglobin, a carrier protein for PIMT, was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. This mixture was dialyzed overnight against 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 2 mm EDTA, and 1 mm EDTA. For PIMT samples for thermal denaturation investigation PIMTs were analyzed immediately after purification without dialysis or the addition of carrier protein. Methyltransferase Assays—Methyltransferase activities were performed based on a modified protocol (24Aswad D.W. Promega Notes. 1995; 52: 27Google Scholar). Each reaction mixture contained 1 μCi of [methyl-3H]-S-adenosyl-l-methionine, 20 μmS-adenosyl-l-methionine, 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.8), 5 mm EGTA, 0-0.5 mm methyl-accepting substrate, either 1 μg of wild type PIMT or 30 μg of the PIMT mutants, in a final volume of 50 μl. The substrate, HPr-2, was generated by incubating E. coli HPr (5 mg/ml 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) at 80 °C for 3 h to promote deamidation of both Asn12 and Asn38 (25Sharma S. Hammen P.K. Anderson J.W. Leung A. Georges F. Hengstenberg W. Klevit R.E. Waygood E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17695-17704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Treated and untreated HPrs were visualized by isoelectric focusing to ensure that complete deamidation of both positions had occurred. This isoaspartyl substrate has been previously characterized with respect to their methyl group accepting abilities from the human PIMT (26Brennan T.V. Anderson J.W. Jia Z. Waygood E.B. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24586-24595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Methyltransferase reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 2 h and then placed on ice for 10 min to slow the PIMT reaction and condense any methanol vapor. The tubes were centrifuged for 10 s at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge and returned to ice. 50 μl of Stop solution (0.4 m CAPS, pH 10, 5% SDS, 2.2% methanol) was added and mixed thoroughly by pipetting. The tubes were placed within a scintillation vial containing 3 ml of Beckman Ready-Safe scintillation mixture. The vials were capped, incubated at 40 °C for 2 h, and chilled on ice for 15 min, and the interior reaction tube was removed. The samples were then counted in a liquid scintillation counter. For assays performed on crude extracts a similar protocol was utilized in which aliquots from the high speed spin of the protein purification method were used as the source of PIMT. Chromatographic Analysis of Co-factors—The presence and identity of the small molecule co-factors in different protein preparations were determined by reverse-phase HPLC analysis. Protein samples (90 μl of 0.11 mg/ml (4.5 nm)) were incubated with 10 μl of 60% (w/v) perchloric acid at room temperature for 30 min and centrifuged for 3 min at 14,000 rpm, and the supernatant was analyzed using a modified protocol (17Griffith S.C. Sawaya M.R. Boutz D.R. Thapar N. Katz J.E. Clarke S. Yeates T.O. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 1103-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The samples were chromatographed using a Varian C18 column (5-μm pore size, 160 mm long, 4.6-mm inner diameter) with a matching 10-mm-long guard column. The column was eluted with a gradient of Buffer A (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 3.2, 10 mm heptane sulfonic acid, 4% (v/v) acetonitrile) to buffer B (100% acetonitrile) linearly from 100 to 84% buffer A over 16 min, 84 to 79% over 9 min, and then 79 to 5% over 3 min. The column was finally held at 5% buffer A for 6 min. The samples were run at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, and absorbance was measured at 254 nm. All of the column runs were preceded by a 20-min equilibration in buffer A. Elution profiles for AdoMet and S-adenosyl l-homocysteine standards, each at a concentration of 4.0 nm, were determined; S-adenosyl l-homocysteine eluted at 15.4 min, and AdoMet eluted at 3.12 min. Parallel experiments were also performed under nondenaturing conditions in which the protein samples were not treated with perchloric acid. For these investigations, the protein component was removed from the solution by centrifugation through a Millipore Ultrafree-MC centrifugal filter device with a molecular weight cut-off 10,000. SDS-PAGE confirmed retention of the protein by the spin column. Stress Survival Tests—Stress survival tests were based on a modified protocol (9Visick J.E. Cai H. Clarke S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2623-2628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Resistance to heat shock was measured using cultures that were grown to mid-log phase in LB broth (100 μg/ml ampicillin, 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol), induced with 0.5 mm isopropylthiogalactoside, and allowed to grow for 3 h. The cells from these cultures were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended to one-tenth their original density in 0.85% NaCl. In 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes, aliquots of 50 μl were heated to 60 °C for 10 min in a thermal cycler; control samples were left on ice for this period. Viable counts were performed by making serial dilutions in 0.85% NaCl and plating them on LB agar (100 μg/ml ampicillin, 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol) and incubated at 16 h at 37 °C to determine the number of surviving bacteria; these results were then compared as the percentages of surviving colonies of the samples that were not heat-shocked. Stability of the E. coli Isoaspartyl O-Methyltransferase—To assess the stability of the wild type and mutant proteins, thermal denaturation profiles were measured with a heating rate of 0.5 °C/min on a Gilford 600 spectrophotometer. The absorbance was continuously monitored at 293 nm over a temperature range of 25-90 °C. The proteins were in Buffer E of the purification protocol. Western Blot Analysis of Hsp70 Induction—One hour following isopropylthiogalactoside induction, 5 ml of culture was pelleted by centrifugation. Preparation of the lysates has been previously described (27Davies G.F. Crosson S.M. Khandelwal R.L. Roseler W.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 10: 477-483Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). For Western analysis, equivalent amounts of protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Following electrophoresis, the proteins were transblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PolyScree; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The membranes were blocked with 5% molecular grade fat-free skim milk powder in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.02% (v/v) Tween 20. Primary and secondary washes were carried out using this sample buffer. Primary antibodies to Hsp70 were obtained from Stressgen (Victoria, Canada). The antibody SC-7298 manufactured by Santa Cruz Biotechnologies was used to probe for protein levels of Hsc70. Protein levels were assessed by Western analysis. An enhanced chemiluminescent detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used to detect antigen-antibody complex. E81A and E104A PIMT Have Limited Methyltransferase Activity—The catalytic capabilities of wild type and mutant E. coli PIMTs were determined. Using fully deamidated E. coli HPr as an isoaspartyl substrate, E. coli wild type PIMT had a Vmax of 2.55 nmol/min/mg and a Km of 160 μm, comparable with the kinetic parameters previously determined for the same substrate using human PIMT. The E81A PIMT mutant has a Vmax of 0.1 nmol/min/mg and a Km of 220 μm for the isoaspartyl substrate, corresponding to a Vmax of ∼4% that of the wild type enzyme with a small increase in Km (Table I). Purified E104A PIMT failed to demonstrate any detectable methyltransferase activity. Similarly assays performed on the E104A crude extract prior to purification also failed to demonstrate any methyltransferase activity above background.Table IComparison of several characteristics of the wild type and mutant PIMTsPIMTVmaxKmTmSoluble protein yield*nmol/min/mgμM°C% wild typeWild type25.516041.5100E81A0.122042.165-75E104A39.815-25a Percentage of soluble yield is based on comparison of purification efficiencies over two large scale purifications performed under identical conditions. Open table in a new tab a Percentage of soluble yield is based on comparison of purification efficiencies over two large scale purifications performed under identical conditions. E81A and E104A E. coli PIMT Retain Co-factor Binding Ability—To determine whether the kinetic consequences of these mutations were due to an inability to bind the AdoMet co-factor, HPLC analysis for co-factor co-purification was performed. PIMT has a remarkably high affinity for the co-factor, likely a result of the nearly complete sequestering of the molecule from solvent. Disruption of protein structure allows for co-factor release and characterization by HPLC. A standard of pure AdoMet of equivalent concentration to the PIMT proteins was analyzed to serve as an internal standard for retention time and magnitude of response. AdoMet eluted from the column with a retention time of 3.12 min. Analysis of supernatants of the denatured PIMT samples confirmed a peak of comparable magnitude eluting at 3.12 min, confirming AdoMet co-purified with all three enzymes (Fig. 3). The ability to co-purify AdoMet verifies proper folding of the mutants within the cell. HPLC analysis for AdoMet was also performed on PIMT samples under nondenaturing conditions. Without disruption of protein structure, AdoMet remained effectively chelated and could not be detected in the supernatants of either the wild type PIMT or the E81A mutant. For the E104A mutant, however, AdoMet is present in the supernatant, although in smaller quantities than with the denatured sample (Fig. 4), suggesting that this mutant has reduced affinity for the co-factor or a propensity for spontaneous unfolding. Another as yet unidentified peak eluted at 1.79 min. This peak was not present in any other runs. Given the previous reports of a specific interaction between adenosine and PIMT (17Griffith S.C. Sawaya M.R. Boutz D.R. Thapar N. Katz J.E. Clarke S. Yeates T.O. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 1103-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), we are investigating the possibility of the co-purification of adenosine specifically by this inactive mutant and not the other forms of PIMT. Methyltransferase Activity and Heat Shock Protection—It has been reported that in Drosophila increased expression of PIMT can prolong lifespan under conditions in which the formation of damaged proteins may limit survival (11Chavous D.A. Jackson F.R. O'Connor C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14814-14818Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We examine the ability of overexpression of wild type, partially active, and completely inactive PIMTs to influence survival capabilities of heat-shocked bacteria. There is a considerable increase in the survival rates of bacteria overexpressing the wild type enzyme as compared with those harboring empty expression vector or expressing an unrelated protein such as the PhoB response regulator from Salmonella typhimurium. However, overexpression of the partially active E81A mutant resulted in comparable increases in survival capabilities as the wild type enzyme. Surprisingly, overexpression of the inactive E104A mutant had significantly higher survival rates than cells enriched with the wild type enzyme (Table II). These results indicate that the survival capabilities bestowed by PIMT overexpression, at least in this circumstance, are independent of PIMT repair function and are likely due to some secondary characteristic of the protein.Table IIShort term stress survivalStrainSurvival%Tuner DE3 plysS DE3 pet15b0Tuner DE3 plysS DE3 pet15b:PhoB0Tuner DE3 plysS DE3 pet15b:wt PIMT3.0 × 10−6Tuner DE3 plysS DE3 pet15b:E81A PIMT9.3 × 10−6Tuner DE3 plysS DE3 pet15b:E104A PIMT2.0 × 10−4 Open table in a new tab Stability of the Wild Type and Mutant Isoaspartyl Methyltransferases—We considered the possibility that the increased survival capabilities were being mediated through the induction of a heat shock response as a consequence of overexpression of an unstable protein. The overexpression of any unstable or misfolding-prone protein has the potential for induction of a heat shock response, regardless of the physiological role of the protein. Furthermore E. coli PIMT is known to be a rather unstable enzyme (22June C. Ding L. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14562-14572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the substitution of glutamate with alanine may further contribute to this instability. Through thermal denaturation curves, wild type E. coli PIMT has a melting temperature of 41.5 °C. The E81A mutant is very comparable with a melting temperature of 42.1 °C, and the E104A showed slightly reduced stability, with a melting temperature of 39.8 °C (Table I). Although these relative stabilities would appear to correlate with the observed survival phenotypes, the stability of a folded protein is not necessarily predictive of the potential for misfolding following translation. The effects of the mutations on misfolding are more accurately reflected by the yields of soluble protein obtained from identical overexpression trials. The expression levels of mutant and wild type PIMTs also support the hypothesis of misfolding of a fraction of the mutant proteins. Over numerous purificati"

This requires molecular motors (portal complexes) converting chemical energy (ATP hydrolysis) into mechanical work (translocation). A wealth of structural and functional data has been obtained for portal complexes of dsDNA 1The abbreviations used are: ds, double-stranded; ss, single stranded; TNP-ATP, 2′(3′)-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)adenosine 5′-triphosphate; TNP-ADP, 2′(3′)-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)adenosine 5′-diphosphate; MANT-ATP, 2′-(or-3′)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)adenosine 5′-triphosphate; ϵ-ATP, 1,N6-ethenoadenosine 5′-triphosphate; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate. 1The abbreviations used are: ds, double-stranded; ss, single stranded; TNP-ATP, 2′(3′)-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)adenosine 5′-triphosphate; TNP-ADP, 2′(3′)-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)adenosine 5′-diphosphate; MANT-ATP, 2′-(or-3′)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)adenosine 5′-triphosphate; ϵ-ATP, 1,N6-ethenoadenosine 5′-triphosphate; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate. bacteriophages (e.g. ϕ29, λ, SPP1, P22, T4, and T-odd phages (1.Ibarra B.

This is partly because of the complexity of portal complexes, in which the packaging ATPase is a multifunctional enzyme and associates transiently with the packaging machinery (i.e. the ATPase is a non-structural protein) (4.Catalano C.E. Cell. Mol. Life. Sci. 2000; 57: 128-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In particular, very little is known about the enzymatic action of these ATPases during packaging (7.Yang Q.

The packaging system of dsRNA bacteriophages from the Cystoviridae family (phages ϕ6-ϕ14 (10.Mindich L. Adv. Virus Res. 1988; 35: 137-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 11.Mindich L. Qiao X. Qiao J. Onodera S. Romantschuk M. Hoogstraten D. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4505-4508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) is considerably simpler. The ssRNA translocation is fueled by a single structural protein P4. P4 forms stable hexamers (12.Juuti J.T. Bamford D.H. Tuma R. Thomas Jr, G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 347-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 13.Kainov, D. E., Pirtimaa, M., Tuma, R., Butcher, S. J., Thomas, G. J., Jr., Bamford, D. H., and Makeyev, E. V.

The dodecahedral procapsid results from co-assembly of the major structural protein P1 with P4 hexamers and minor proteins P2 (RNA polymerase) and P7 (assembly and functional cofactor) (16.Poranen M.M.

Biol. 2003; 328: 791-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cystoviruses have a tripartite dsRNA genome. The procapsid-associated P4 sequentially translocates the three ssRNA genomic precursors into the particle interior (18.Qiao X. Qiao J. Mindich L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4074-4079Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 19.Mindich L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 149-160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Sun Y. Qiao X. Qiao J. Onodera S. Mindich L. Virology. 2003; 308: 354-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The packaged RNA precursors are then replicated inside the viral particle into dsRNA genome segments (21.Gottlieb P. Strassman J. Qiao X.Y. Frucht A. Mindich L. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5774-5782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the procapsid-associated packaging is highly specific for the viral RNA, an unspecific, in vitro translocase activity was recently demonstrated for isolated P4 hexamers from bacteriophages ϕ8 and ϕ13 (13.Kainov, D. E., Pirtimaa, M., Tuma, R., Butcher, S. J., Thomas, G. J., Jr., Bamford, D. H., and Makeyev, E. V. (September 8, 2003) J. Biol. Chem. 10.1074/jbc. M306928200Google Scholar). The translocation is unidirectional (5′ to 3′) and leads to efficient helicase activity (13.Kainov, D. E., Pirtimaa, M., Tuma, R., Butcher, S. J., Thomas, G. J., Jr., Bamford, D. H., and Makeyev, E. V. (September 8, 2003) J. Biol. Chem. 10.1074/jbc. M306928200Google Scholar). Given the hexameric ring morphology, common α/β-fold, and helicase activity, it was concluded that P4 proteins share structural and functional similarity to hexameric helicases (13.Kainov, D. E., Pirtimaa, M., Tuma, R., Butcher, S. J., Thomas, G. J., Jr., Bamford, D. H., and Makeyev, E. V. (September 8, 2003) J. Biol. Chem. 10.1074/jbc. M306928200Google Scholar). In particular, P4 proteins share limited sequence similarity with the bacteriophage T7 gene 4 product, which is a hexameric helicase of known three-dimensional structure (22.Singleton M.R. Sawaya M.R. Ellenberger T. Wigley D.B. Cell. 2000; 101: 589-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Based on the structure, a model for sequential ATP hydrolysis was proposed (22.Singleton M.R. Sawaya M.R. Ellenberger T. Wigley D.B. Cell. 2000; 101: 589-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar): two opposite binding sites are occupied by ATP molecules, two binding sites contain ADPs and the two remaining sites are empty. Subsequently, the ATP molecules are hydrolyzed, ADP is released, and the empty sites become occupied by ATP. Binding, hydrolysis, and release of nucleotides induces conformational changes and modulates subunit affinity for DNA. However, the x-ray structure was obtained for a 2-fold symmetric form of the hexamer without a bound ssDNA substrate. Because ssDNA lacks such symmetry, the P4 conformation and nucleotide stoichiometry in the presence of ssDNA may differ from the solved x-ray structure (23.Lohman T.M. Bjornson K.P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 169-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 24.Patel S.S. Picha K.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 651-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 25.Hingorani M.M. Washington M.T. Moore K.C. Patel S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5012-5017Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In accordance with this view, a DNA substrate has been shown to induce cooperativity in a replicative hexameric helicase, DnaB, from Escherichia coli (26.Jezewska M.J. Kim U.S. Bujalowski W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2129-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Although considerable structural and biochemical evidence has been gathered for hexameric helicases (26.Jezewska M.J. Kim U.S. Bujalowski W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2129-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 27.Caruthers J.M. McKay D.B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 28.Kim D.E. Narayan M. Patel S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 807-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), the role of the nucleic acid substrate in coordinating ATP hydrolysis has not been clarified. It remains to be seen whether the apparent similarity between hexameric helicases and packaging ATPases of dsRNA bacteriophages extends also to enzymatic and mechanochemical functions. In this study, we exploit the in vitro RNA translocation system of bacteriophage ϕ8 as a model and present the first detailed enzymatic characterization of an RNA translocation reaction. The ϕ8 P4 system offers two advantages: 1) P4 exhibits tight coupling between ATP hydrolysis and RNA translocation; 2) P4 hexamer is stable in the presence of magnesium alone without the need for nucleotide di- or triphosphates (13.Kainov, D. E., Pirtimaa, M., Tuma, R., Butcher, S. J., Thomas, G. J., Jr., Bamford, D. H., and Makeyev, E. V. (September 8, 2003) J. Biol. Chem. 10.1074/jbc. M306928200Google Scholar). We characterize the steps and corresponding rates of ATP binding, hydrolysis, and product release. Conformational changes during the enzymatic cycle and upon RNA binding are also characterized. We discover that RNA induces cooperativity and undergoes conformational changes upon ATP binding to P4. A model of sequential ATP hydrolysis and ssRNA translocation consistent with the experimental data is presented and compared with mechanisms proposed for the hexameric helicases. ϕ8 P4 protein was expressed in E. coli and purified as previously described (17.Kainov D.E. Butcher S.J. Bamford D.H. Tuma R. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 791-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). P4 concentrations were determined by absorption at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 11,920 m-1 cm-1 that was calculated based on amino acid composition. Fluorescent nucleotide analogs TNP-ATP, TNP-ADP, MANT-ATP, and ϵ-ATP (Molecular Probes, Inc.) were used. All experiments were done in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 75 mm NaCl and 7.5 mm MgCl2. Rapid mixing of fluorescence nucleotide analogs with P4 protein was achieved in a μSFM 20 stopped-flow apparatus (Bio-Logic) equipped with an F-15 flow cell (dead time 6 ms). Changes in TNP-nucleotide fluorescence intensity were detected by an MOS 250 fluorometer (Bio-Logic) using λexc = 408 nm (20 nm slit) and λdet = 550 nm (20 nm slit) and concurrently by an external photomultiplier through a 515-nm edge filter. The kinetic traces of fluorescence intensity, f, were fitted by a single exponential term, f=b-aexp(-kt) where a is the amplitude of fluorescence change, b is the saturating fluorescence value, k is the apparent first-order rate, and t is time. In the case of a simple second-order reaction, the linear dependence of the apparent rate on substrate concentration [S] was described by, k=koff+kon[S] kon and koff are the fitted second-order rate constants. In the case of two-step binding the hyperbolic dependence of the apparent rate on substrate concentration was fitted by, k=kr+kf[S]Ks+[S] Ks is the equilibrium constant for the fast second-order binding, which is followed by a slower, first-order phase with the corresponding forward and reverse rate constants being kf and kr. The nucleotide dissociation constants were estimated using amplitudes of fluorescence intensity increase, ΔF, upon TNP-ATP and TNP-ADP binding. The fluorescence spectrum of a nucleotide analog at a given concentration was measured first (λexc = 408 nm, 20 nm slit, 10 nm detection slit). Then a small volume of P4 was added (final concentration 6 μm) and another fluorescence spectrum was measured. The difference between these two spectra yielded ΔF. Measurements with TNP-ATP in the presence of poly(C) were done as fast as possible (within 15 s) to minimize the effect of TNP-ATP hydrolysis. All spectra were corrected for dilution and the inner filter effect as previously described (29.Lakowicz J. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Publishing, New York1999Crossref Google Scholar), F=Fobs(Vi/V0)100.5εcl where F and Fobs are the corrected and the measured fluorescence intensities in arbitrary units; the term Vi/V0 accounts for the dilution; the inner filter effect because of TNP-nucleotide absorption was corrected according to Beer-Lambert's law. ϵ is the molar extinction coefficient of TNP-nucleotide at the excitation wavelength, c is the TNP-nucleotide concentration, and l is the optical path (1.5 mm). In the case of stoichiometric binding of nucleotide analogs the fluorescence enhancement ΔF was fitted to, ΔF=C[P]+[S]+Kd-([P]+[S]+Kd)2-4[P][S]2 where [P] is the protein concentration, [S] is the substrate concentration, and Kd is the dissociation constant. The constant C describes the maximum increase in quantum yield upon binding. Steady-state Kinetics—Phosphate release assays were done using the EnzChek Phosphate Assay Kit (Molecular Probes, Inc.) in the standard reaction buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, containing 0.2 mm sodium azide). The concentration of inorganic phosphate (Pi) was proportional to the absorbance at 360 nm and was calibrated by standard KH2PO4 solutions. AMP was used as a background control for all experiments. The detection limit of the assay was 7 ± 1 μm s-1 (room temperature, 25 °C). At the typical enzyme concentration of 0.1 μm the detection limit was 70 s-1, i.e. 1 order of magnitude faster than the highest kcat measured. Steady-state kinetics of phosphate release were measured using a Victor2 plate reader (Wallac-PerkinElmer, time resolution 20 s) and a Jasco V-560 spectrophotometer (time resolution, 0.2 s). ATP and ADP were purchased from Amersham Biosciences, poly(rC) was from Sigma (concentration is expressed as moles of bases). The rate of NTP hydrolysis (measured by phosphate release), v, is in the simplest case described by Michaelis-Menten kinetics, v[P]=kcat[S]KM+[S] KM is the Michaelis constant. In the case of cooperativity, the Hill equation was used instead with the Hill coefficient, n, v[P]=kcat[S]nKMn+[S]n The activation energy, EA, for an enzymatic reaction was estimated from the temperature dependence of the rate constant, v, using the Arrhenius equation, v=Aexp-EART where A is a frequency factor and R is the universal gas constant. SsRNA strands of lengths of 62, 700, 1410, and 2948 (full-length viral s segment) bases were prepared using T7 RNA polymerase (Promega), plasmid pLM659 containing a cDNA clone of the ϕ6 genome s segment, and restriction enzymes BanI, BamHI, and EcoRV (New England Biolabs, Inc.) as previously described (30.Makeyev E.V. Bamford D.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6275-6284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The steady-state rates of ATP hydrolysis were measured as a function of RNA length according to the procedure described above. In the case of processive translocation, the rate of ATP hydrolysis, k, increases with the length of RNA substrate, L. ATP hydrolysis during translocation (with rate ktr) is interrupted by periods of no hydrolysis between protein dissociation from the 3′ end of one ssRNA molecule and association with another substrate. The frequency of these interruptions is proportional to 1/L. P4 may also hydrolyze ATP (with rate kend) while it remains associated with the 3′ end. In the limiting situation of a very long RNA substrate, the contributions of end effects and dissociation are negligible, and ATP will be hydrolyzed with an apparent rate equal to ktr. Conversely, in the case of a short RNA substrate the translocation will be negligible and all ATP will be hydrolyzed with rate kend. Thus, the dependence of the ATPase rate on the RNA substrate length can be described as a combination of two terms corresponding to the two limiting cases (where c is a parameter corresponding to the RNA length for which end effects become negligible). k=ktrLL+c+kendcL+c Protein and RNA (poly(rC)) solutions were concentrated (to ∼10 mg/ml each), sealed in sterile capillaries (Kimax number 34504), and thermostated at 5 °C. Raman spectra were recorded on a Spex 500M spectrograph equipped with a notch filter and charge-coupled device detector (SpectrumOne, Instruments S.A., Edison, NJ) using a spectral slit width of 4 cm-1. A solid state, diode-pumped, frequency doubled Nd:YVO4 laser (excitation wavelength 532 nm, model Verdi, Coherent, Santa Clara, CA) was used to generate 150 milliwatts at the sample. Each spectrum represents the accumulation of 15 exposures of 2 min duration on each of two independently prepared protein solutions. Spectra were corrected for buffer and NTP contributions, and normalized for difference computations as described previously (31.Benevides J.M. Juuti J.T. Tuma R. Bamford D.H. Thomas Jr, G.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11946-11953Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The positions of strong bands are reported with ±1 cm-1 accuracy, whereas those of weak and broad bands are reported with ±2 cm-1 accuracy. An intensity change within a difference spectrum is deemed significant if its magnitude exceeds two times the level of noise. The ssRNA binding properties of P4 were studied by polyacrylamide gel-shift assay. Protein (40 nm) was incubated with 1 nm32P-labeled 20-mer RNA oligonucleotide 5′-CGACUCAUGGACCUUGGGAG-3′ in 10-μl mixtures containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 75 mm NaCl, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2% glycerol. After 30 min incubation at 23 °C with or without 4 mm of the appropriate nucleotide (ATP, ADP, or AMP-PNP), the samples were adjusted to 5% glycerol and analyzed by non-denaturing 12% PAGE in Tris borate-EDTA buffer (32.Sambrook J. Russell D. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). ATP Binding Triggers Conformational Change in the Hexamer—ATP binding was investigated using fluorescence ATP analogs producing spectral changes upon binding. Several analogs were tested: TNP-ATP, MANT-ATP, and ϵ-ATP. All analogs were hydrolyzed by P4 but only TNP-ATP produced a measurable change in fluorescence intensity (20% increase). After rapid mixing of TNP-ATP and P4 protein in a stopped-flow apparatus a monoexponential increase in fluorescence intensity was observed (Fig. 1A). Such a simple kinetics profile suggested that only one type of ATP binding site could be kinetically resolved. Dependence of the apparent first-order rate, k, on TNP-ATP concentration (Fig. 1B) in the absence of RNA was hyperbolic indicating a two-step binding process, where a fast, second-order association is followed by a slower, first-order phase. The slower, first-order phase could represent a conformational change within the hexamer. This is further studied by Raman spectroscopy (see below). The binding parameters are summarized in Table I.Table IKinetic parameters of TNP-ATP bindingKs (μm)188 ± 85kf (s−1)121 ± 36kr (s−1)16 ± 1Kd (μm)18 ± 9 Open table in a new tab RNA Binding Induces ATP Binding Cooperativity—The dependence of the apparent rate constant, k, on TNP-ATP concentration (Fig. 1B) was sigmoidal in the presence of poly(C). The time course of fluorescence increase remained monoexponential. Thus, the plateau regions of the concentration dependence were assigned to first-order processes, whereas the linear part of the sigmoidal curve (Fig. 1B) was interpreted as a second-order binding. The initial plateau is followed by a linear rise and a second plateau indicating sequential, cooperative, binding of two or more ATP molecules. Upon assumption that the cooperativity results from sequential binding of two ATP molecules the observed kinetics can be qualitatively explained. At low concentrations, the kinetics are first-order indicating that the binding rate (kf(1) + kr(1) = 24 ± 1 s-1) of the first ATP is limited by a conformational change. At higher concentrations binding becomes second order, suggesting that the first conformational change facilitates binding of the second ATP. Ultimately, the binding of the second ATP is limited by another conformational change as it becomes first-order (kf(2) + kr(2) = 81 ± 3 s-1) at concentrations above 60 μm (TNP-ATP, Fig. 1B). The first-order step exhibited strong temperature dependence (Fig. 1B), whereas the fast second-order binding remained unaffected. Fig. 1C shows the temperature dependence of the rate of fluorescence increase upon mixing the 3 μm P4 protein and 1 mm poly(C) with 100 μm TNP-ATP (saturating concentration, e.g. the apparent rate corresponded to kf). The activation energy of the first-order phase 63 ± 9 kJ/mol was estimated from an Arrhenius plot (Fig. 1C, inset). Equilibrium Nucleotide Binding—Equilibrium dissociation constants were estimated using the stationary amplitudes of the fluorescence intensity increase, ΔF, upon nucleotide binding (Fig. 2). No cooperativity was observed for TNP-ATP binding in the presence of poly(C) in the TNP-ATP concentration region 0 to 50 μm, in which the kinetic and catalytic (see below) cooperativity was apparent. The dissociation constants were obtained from fitting the data to Equation 5, which was derived with an assumption of stoichiometric occupancy, i.e. each subunit binds one nucleotide. In principle, only one or a few subunits per hexamer may be occupied by the same nucleotide. In that case [P] should be replaced by apparent concentration of the binding sites [A] = r[P]/6, where r is the number of nucleotides per hexamer. We assumed r = 6 for all cases to calculate the apparent dissociation constant of TNP-ATP and TNP-ADP (Table II). Comparison of dissociation constants suggests lower affinity of P4 for ADP than for ATP.Table IIEquilibrium dissociation constants (μm) estimated assuming binding of six nucleotides per hexamerNucleotideNo nucleic acid1 mm Poly(C)TNP-ATP12 ± 37 ± 3TNP-ADP28 ± 432 ± 13 Open table in a new tab Cooperativity of ATP Hydrolysis—The steady-state rate of ATP hydrolysis at room temperature was measured as the rate of phosphate release after addition of ATP. No ATP hydrolysis was detected in the absence of nucleic acid or in the presence of DNA (Fig. 3A). ATP hydrolysis was detected only in the presence of ssRNA (poly(C) or 20-mer RNA oligonucleotide) (Fig. 3A). The steady-state ATPase rate had sigmoidal concentration dependence and kinetic parameters were extracted by fitting the data to Equation 7 (Table III). The fit indicates cooperativity of ATP hydrolysis involving at least two subunits (n > 1). This suggests that at least two ATP molecules have to be bound before one of them is hydrolyzed.Table IIIKinetics of phosphate releasekcatKMns−1μmPoly(C), ATP6.4 ± 0.2167 ± 111.4 ± 0.120-mer RNA, ATP1.6 ± 0.1320 ± 381.6 ± 0.2Poly(C), TNP-ATP2.3 ± 0.125 ± 41.9 ± 0.4 Open table in a new tab Because P4 hexamer is stable (13.Kainov, D. E., Pirtimaa, M., Tuma, R., Butcher, S. J., Thomas, G. J., Jr., Bamford, D. H., and Makeyev, E. V. (September 8, 2003) J. Biol. Chem. 10.1074/jbc. M306928200Google Scholar) the other possible source of cooperativity would be stacking of two or more hexamers into a larger oligomer as observed in negative stain electron micrographs for ϕ6 P4 (15.de Haas F. Paatero A.O. Mindich L. Bamford D.H. Fuller S.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 357-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). If the cooperativity resulted from such an oligomer then the Hill coefficient should be dependent on P4 concentration. This is not the case (data not shown), i.e. only one P4 hexamer participates in hydrolysis and the cooperativity results from interactions within the same ring. P4 hydrolyzes also the fluorescence ATP analog, TNP-ATP, although with lower kcat. The apparent KM constant was lower, suggesting tighter binding of TNP-ATP than ATP but cooperativity and tight coupling between hydrolysis and RNA binding was conserved. Thus, TNP-ATP constitutes a good model for kinetic analysis. The rate of ATP hydrolysis increases with temperature (Fig. 3B). Apparent activation energies were estimated to be 36 ± 3 kJ/mol for ATP and 58 ± 8 kJ/mol for TNP-ATP hydrolysis, respectively. Processive Translocation—The maximum rate of ATP hydrolysis depended on the length of the ssRNA (Figs. 3A and 4) indicating processive translocation, for which the rate-limiting step was the P4-RNA association and/or dissociation (28.Kim D.E. Narayan M. Patel S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 807-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The rate of ATP hydrolysis for translocation along the poly(C) substrate (an average length 3000 bases, estimated by gel electrophoresis) was higher than in the case of the full-length ϕ6 genomic segment s (length 2948 bases) most likely because the secondary structure of the s segment (33.Pirttimaa M.J. Bamford D.H. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 880-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) slowed down the translocation. Our simple model (Equation 9) matched the experimental data well (Fig. 4) and gave the value of a processive rate ktr of 8.1 ± 1.7 s-1 (kend = 0.5 ± 0.2 s-1, C = 1990 ± 950). This value is close to the rate of ATP hydrolysis in the presence of poly(C) (k = 6.2 ± 0.6 s-1). Thus, poly(C) is a good model for an infinitely long RNA strand without any secondary structure. ADP and Inorganic Phosphate Release Are Fast—The fluorescence intensity change upon binding of 30 μm TNP-ADP to 3 μm P4 was faster than the detection limit of 6 ms (Fig. 1A) irrespective of the presence of poly(C). The value of the TNP-ADP dissociation constant 28 ± 4 s-1 (see above) and Equation 2 yield a limit for koff of >170 s-1. The same result was obtained also for 30 μm TNP-ADP in 50 mm phosphate buffer. Thus, the release of products (ADP and phosphate) appears to be faster than all other steps of the ATP hydrolysis cycle. Another control experiment was performed to demonstrate that the phosphate release step was not coupled to RNA binding. P4 protein was incubated in an excess of ATP and the unbound nucleotides were removed by a spin column. Subsequently, poly(C) was added and phosphate release was measured. If the phosphate release step was RNA-dependent a burst of inorganic phosphate should be concomitant with poly(C) addition. Instead, a slow linear increase in phosphate concentration (rate 0.03 s-1, data not shown) was observed. This slow rate is consistent with the hydrolysis of ATP that was bound to P4. Thus,"
https://openalex.org/W2004701417,"C3b2-IgG complexes are formed during complement activation in serum by attachment of two C3b molecules (the proteolytically activated form of C3) to one IgG heavy chain (IgG HC) via ester bonds. Because of the presence of two C3b molecules, these complexes are very efficient activators of the alternative complement pathway. Likewise, dimeric C3b is known to enhance complement receptor 1-dependent phagocytosis, and dimeric C3d (the smallest thioester-containing fragment of C3) linked to a protein antigen facilitates CR2-dependent B-cell proliferation. Because the efficiency of all these interactions depends on the number of C3 fragments, we investigated whether C3b2-IgG complexes retained dimeric structure upon physiological inactivation. We used two-dimensional SDS-PAGE and Western blot to study the arrangement of the C3b molecules by analyzing the fragmentation pattern after cleavage of the ester bonds. Upon inactivation with factors H and I, a 185-kDa band was generated under reducing conditions. It released IgG HC and the 65-kDa fragment of C3b α′ chain after hydrolysis of the ester bonds with hydroxylamine. The two C3b molecules were not 65-kDa-to-40-kDa linked, because neither ester-bonded 65 kDa HC nor 65 kDa-40 kDa fragments were observed, nor was a 40-kDa peptide released after hydroxylamine cleavage. Factor I and CR1 cleaved the C3b2-IgG molecule to its final physiological product, C3dg2-IgG, which migrated as a 133-kDa fragment in reduced form. This fragment released exclusively C3dg (the final physiological product of C3b inactivation by factor I) and IgG HC. C3dg2-HC appeared as a double band on SDS-PAGE only at low gel porosity, suggesting the presence of two conformers of the same composition. Our results suggest that, upon physiological inactivation, C3b2-IgG complexes retain dimeric inactivated C3b and C3dg, which allows bivalent binding to the corresponding complement receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2092511440,"Although bismuth salts have been used for over two centuries for the treatment of various gastrointestinal disorders, the mechanism of their therapeutic action remains controversial. Because gastrins bind two trivalent ferric ions with high affinity, and because ferric ions are essential for the biological activity of glycine-extended gastrin 17, we have investigated the hypothesis that trivalent bismuth ions influence the biological activity of gastrins. Binding of bismuth ions to gastrins was measured by fluorescence quenching and NMR spectroscopy. The effects of bismuth ions on gastrin-stimulated biological activities were measured in inositol phosphate, cell proliferation, and cell migration assays. Fluorescence quenching experiments indicated that both glycine-extended and amidated gastrin 17 bound two bismuth ions. The NMR spectral changes observed on addition of bismuth ions revealed that Glu-7 acted as a ligand at the first bismuth ion binding site. In the presence of bismuth ions the ability of glycine-extended gastrin 17 to stimulate inositol phosphate production, cell proliferation, and cell migration was markedly reduced. In contrast, bismuth ions had little effect on the affinity of the CCK-2 receptor for amidated gastrin 17, or on the stimulation of inositol phosphate production by amidated gastrin 17. We conclude that bismuth ions may act, at least in part, by blocking the effects of glycine-extended gastrin 17 on cell proliferation and cell migration in the gastrointestinal tract. This is the first report of a specific inhibitory effect of bismuth ions on the action of a gastrointestinal hormone.

This is the first report of a specific inhibitory effect of bismuth ions on the action of a gastrointestinal hormone. Since the first recorded medical use of bismuth subsalicylate in 1733 (1.Bierer D.W. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1990; 12: S3-S8Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), bismuth salts have been used for the treatment of various gastrointestinal disorders, including gastric and duodenal ulcers, dyspepsia, diarrhea, and colitis (2.Rokkas T. Sladen G.E. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 1988; 23: 82-86Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 3.Gorbach S.L. Gastroenterology. 1990; 99: 863-875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, this broad spectrum of effects is associated with a large number of putative mechanisms of action. Bismuth has a direct antibacterial effect on Helicobacter pylori (4.Van Oijen A.H. Verbeek A.L. Jansen J.B. De Boer W.A. Aliment. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 14: 991-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and different combinations of bismuth, gastric acid inhibitors, and antibiotics are variously effective in eradicating the bacterium (5.Houben M.H. Van De Beek D. Hensen E.F. De Craen A.J. Rauws E.A. Tygtat G.N. Aliment. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 13: 1047-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Although bismuth is no longer a front-line treatment for H. pylori infection, quadruple therapy incorporating bismuth, antibiotics, and a proton pump inhibitor is currently recommended for eradication of H. pylori in patients infected with strains resistant to metronidazole (6.Katelaris P.H. Forbes G.M. Talley N.J. Crotty B. Gastroenterology. 2002; 123: 1763-1769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Bismuth salts also preferentially coat ulcer craters preventing back diffusion of H+ ions (2.Rokkas T. Sladen G.E. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 1988; 23: 82-86Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 7.Lambert J.D. Midolo P. Aliment. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 11: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), and additionally accelerate crater repair through stimulation of macrophage influx and prostaglandin synthesis, and through a reduction in pepsin activity (2.Rokkas T.

Ther. 1997; 11: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In colitis the anti-diarrheal and anti-inflammatory effects of bismuth have proved beneficial (8.Fine K.D. Lee E.L. Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: 29-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar).Infection with H. pylori causes an increase in circulating gastrin concentrations via a variety of mechanisms (9.Gillen D.

Med. 2001; 345: 829-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Antral infection directly increases serum gastrin, perhaps via release of inflammatory cytokines, and the increased gastrin in turn increases gastric acidity. In contrast, colonization of the body of the stomach decreases gastric acidity resulting in a reciprocal increase in serum gastrin. The hypergastrinemia and hyperchlorhydria associated with antral H. pylori infection predispose to duodenal ulcer, whereas infection of the gastric body results in atrophic gastritis and an increased risk of gastric cancer. Gastrin has also been reported to stimulate the growth of H. pylori directly (11.Chowers M.Y. Keller N. Tal R. Barshack I. Lang R. Bar-Meir S. Chowers Y.

Until recently, amidation of the carboxyl terminus of gastrin was thought to be essential for biological activity (14.Dockray G.J. J.

In addition Ggly acts synergistically with Gamide in the stimulation and maintenance of elevated gastric acid production (23.Higashide S. Gomez G. Greeley Jr., G.H. Townsend Jr., C.M. Thompson J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G220-G224PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Chen D. Zhao C.M. Dockray G.J. Varro A. Van Hoek A. Sinclair N.F. Wang T.C. Koh T.J.

Curtain C.C. Sawyer W.H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10741-10746Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and that binding of ferric ions was essential for biological activity (26.Pannequin J.

Because bismuth ions are also trivalent, and have been shown to substitute for ferric ions in binding to lactoferrin (27.Zhang L. Szeto K.Y. Wong W.B. Loh T.T. Sadler P.J. Sun H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13281-13287Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and transferrin (28.Sun H. Li H. Mason A.B. Woodworth R.C. Sadler P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8829-8835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that gastrins might also bind bismuth ions and that binding might influence biological activity. To investigate this question, we have studied the fluorescence and NMR spectra of gastrins in the presence of bismuth salts. We have also investigated the effect of bismuth ions on gastrin-induced inositol phosphate production, cell proliferation, and cell migration, and on the binding of gastrins to their receptors. Our results indicate that bismuth ions selectively inhibit the biological activity of Ggly, but have little effect on the actions of Gamide. This novel effect of bismuth has implications for treatment of peptic ulcer disease and colorectal cancer.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals and Cell Lines—Ggly and Gamide were purchased from Auspep (Melbourne, Australia) and Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland), respectively.The T lymphoblastoid cell line Jurkat (29.Galleyrand J.C. Lima-Leite A.C. Lallement J.C. Lignon M.F. Bernad N. Fulcrand P. Martinez J. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1994; 44: 348-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Dr. C. Oiry, Université de Montpellier I, France) was grown at 37 °C in 225-cm2 culture flasks in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The human colorectal carcinoma cell line HT29 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, and was grown at 37 °C in 175-cm2 culture flasks in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. COS-7 cells were grown at 37 °C in 175-cm2 culture flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid encoding the CCK-2 receptor as described previously (30.Baldwin G.S. Hollande F. Yang Z. Karelina Y. Paterson A. Strang R. Fourmy D. Neumann G. Shulkes A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7791-7796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).The IMGE-5 cell line was established from the gastric mucosa of mice transgenic for a temperature-sensitive mutant of the SV40 large T antigen as described previously (31.Hollande F. Blanc E.M. Bali J.P. Whitehead R.H. Pelegrin A. Baldwin G.S. Choquet A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: G910-G921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IMGE-5 cells were generally grown at 33 °C in DMEM containing 1 unit/ml γ-interferon, 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (permissive conditions). For all experiments, cells were transferred to 39 °C in the same medium without γ-interferon (non-permissive conditions), where they display differentiated characteristics such as expression of functional adherens and tight junctions. All experiments have been performed on cells between passages 20 and 30.Fluorescence Spectroscopy—The tryptophan fluorescence of peptide solutions was measured, in 3-ml quartz cuvettes thermostated at 25 °C, with a Spex Fluorolog-2 spectrofluorimeter (Spex Industries, Edison, NJ), with the excitation and emission wavelengths set at 290 and 345 nm, respectively. The quenching of tryptophan fluorescence induced by the binding of metal ions was used to calculate the fraction of binding sites occupied, fa, fa=(yf-y)/(yf-yb) where y is the fluorescence signal at a given concentration of metal ions and yb and yf are the signals when the binding sites are fully occupied and unoccupied, respectively (32.Winzor D.J. Sawyer W.H. Quantitative Characterization of Ligand Binding. Wiley-Liss, New York1995: 28-41Google Scholar). The data was fitted by non-linear regression with the program Sigmaplot (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA) to the equations for models with 1 or 2 binding sites with identical affinities, fa=x/(Kd1+x) or to the model with 2 binding sites with different affinities, fa=(Kd1·x+Kd2·x+2x2)/2(Kd1·Kd2+Kd1·x+Kd2·x+x2) where x is the concentration of free metal ions, Kd1 is the first site dissociation constant and Kd2 is the second site dissociation constant. For the 1-site model the value of x at any given total concentration of metal ions was obtained by the exact solution of the appropriate quadratic (33.Malby S. Pickering R. Saha S. Smallridge R. Linse S. Downing A.K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2555-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). For the 2-site model the value of x was obtained by an iterative Newton-Raphson procedure (34.Linse S. Johansson C. Brodin P. Grundstrom T. Drakenberg T. Forsen S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 154-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar).NMR Spectroscopy—Samples were prepared for NMR spectroscopy by dissolving 2.5 mg of peptide in 0.6 ml of 10% Me2SO, 10% 2H2O, 80% H2O at 278 K. The pH was adjusted with small amounts of 1 m NaO2H or 2HCl to pH 5.3. 1H chemical shifts were referenced to 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapenthane-5-sulfonate at 0 ppm via the chemical shift of the H2O resonance or an impurity at 0.15 ppm. NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker DRX-600 and AMX-500 spectrometers as described previously (35.Barnham K.J. Catalfamo F. Pallaghy P.K. Howlett G.J. Norton R.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1435: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar).Measurement of Inositol Phosphate Production—Intracellular inositol phosphate production stimulated by Ggly in HT29 or IMGE-5 cells, or by Gamide in COS-7 cells transiently transfected with the CCK-2 receptor, was determined as described by Jensen and co-workers (36.Qian J.M. Rowley W.H. Jensen R.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: G718-G727PubMed Google Scholar). IMGE-5 cells (105 cells/ml) were plated in 24-multiwell culture plates in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. 24 h later, cells were incubated with DMEM supplemented with antibiotics and myo-[2-3H]inositol (2.5 μCi/well) and shifted to 39 °C for 16 h. Cells were then washed with pre-warmed DMEM and incubated (20–30 min at 37 °C) with DMEM supplemented with 20 mm LiCl. Loaded cells were then washed in 1 ml of IP buffer (135 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm LiCl, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.45) and incubated with or without agonist in a final volume of 0.5 ml of IP buffer. After a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by removing the incubation medium and adding 1 ml of a mixture of ethanol/HCl (2000:1, v/v). One ml of each aliquot was applied to a column containing 1.6 ml of 1:2 (v/v) Dowex AG-1-X8 anion exchange resin in distilled water. The columns were washed with 4 ml of distilled water, followed by 4 ml of 40 mm HCOONH4, and inositol phosphates were eluted with 4 ml of 1 m HCOONH4. The radioactivity of each eluate was counted after addition of 5 ml of complete phase combining system solution (Amersham Biosciences). For the positive control, IMGE-5 cells were incubated with a combination of 30 mm NaF and 10 μm AlCl3 under the same experimental conditions.Proliferation Assay—A colorimetric assay was used to measure Ggly-stimulated HT29 cell proliferation. Briefly, cells were seeded in a 96-well plate at a density of 104 cells/well in DMEM containing 10% FBS and antibiotics. The following day, cells were synchronized in G0 by incubation for 24 h in the same medium lacking FBS. The medium was replaced the next day with fresh medium containing 1% FBS and antibiotics and the peptides under investigation, and incubation was continued for 72 h. Fifteen μl of 5 mg/ml MTT (Sigma) was added per well, and the plate was incubated at 37 °C for 4 h before the medium was discarded. Two hundred μl of 40 mm HCl in isopropyl alcohol was added to lyse the cells, and the absorbance at 570 nm was read on a Bio-Rad model 550 microplate reader (Bio-Rad).Because Jurkat cells grow in suspension, and their proliferation cannot therefore be readily measured by MTT assay, proliferation of HT29 cells in response to Ggly, and of Jurkat cells in response to Gamide, was also measured by counting. HT29 cells were seeded at a concentration of 5 × 103 cells/200 μl in media without FBS. After 24 h the medium was replaced with 200 μl/well RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.2% FBS with and without the test compounds at 10 nm concentration. Jurkat cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium without FBS for 24 h and subsequently seeded into 96-well plates at a concentration of 5 × 104 cells/200 μl in media containing 2% FBS with and without the test compounds at 10 nm concentration. After incubation for 48 h at 37 °C the cells were stained with trypan blue (0.4%), and live cells were counted using a hemocytometer.Estimates of Ki (the dissociation constant for the complex between Ggly and bismuth ions) were obtained from the proliferation data by nonlinear regression with the program Sigmaplot (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA) to the equation that describes the effect of a competitive inhibitor, y=M·G/(G+Kd[1+Bi/Ki]) where y is the increase in cell count above the control value observed in the absence of Ggly or bismuth ions expressed as a percentage of that value, M is the maximum cell count observed in the absence of inhibitor, G is the concentration of Ggly, Bi is the concentration of inhibitory bismuth ions, and Kd is the Ggly dissociation constant (37.Mathews C.K. Van Holde K.E. Biochemistry. 2nd Ed. Benjamin/Cummings, Menlo Park, CA1995: 383-387Google Scholar). To present this data graphically the equation was transformed to the form, 1/y=(1+Kd/G)/M+Bi·Kd/M·G·Ki so that a plot of 1/y versus Bi at different G values would be expected to yield intercepting straight lines. If cell counts in the test well are expressed as a percentage of the control value in the absence of Ggly or bismuth ions the following equation applies. 1/y=control/100(test-control)Migration Experiments—To assess the effects of bismuth ions on Ggly-induced cell migration, wound healing experiments were performed as detailed elsewhere (18.Hollande F. Choquet A. Blanc E.M. Lee D.J. Bali J.P. Baldwin G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40402-40410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In brief, IMGE-5 cells were grown in 12-well plates in DMEM at 33 °C until they reached 80% confluence, then shifted to 39 °C and serum starved for 24 h. The confluent monolayer was wounded using a 20-μl pipette tip, and cells were then washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline (2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 142 mm NaCl, and 10 mm Na2HPO4, pH 6.95) and treated with or without different compounds in DMEM with antibiotics. Morphology and migration of cells were observed and photographed immediately, and after treatment for 17 and 24 h. Wound width was measured at six different positions on the 24-h photographs, and averages were calculated.CCK-2 Receptor Binding Assays—Binding of Gamide to the human CCK-2 receptor on transiently transfected COS-7 cells was measured in triplicate by competition for 125I-labeled Bolton and Hunter-CCK8 ([125I]BH-CCK8) binding as described previously (30.Baldwin G.S. Hollande F. Yang Z. Karelina Y. Paterson A. Strang R. Fourmy D. Neumann G. Shulkes A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7791-7796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Transfected COS-7 cells were grown to 60–70% confluence as described above, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and then incubated for 45 min at 37 °C in 500 μl of DMEM containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and [125I]BH-CCK8 (100,000 cpm, 14.5 fmol, Amersham Biosciences), with or without various unlabeled compounds. Nonspecific binding was evaluated with 1 μm unlabeled CCK8. Incubation was stopped by adding 2 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% bovine serum albumin. After centrifugation, supernatants were removed and the radioactivity bound to the cell membranes was measured in a γ-counter (LKB-Wallac, Turku, Finland). Estimates of IC50 values, and of the levels of [125I]BH-CCK8 bound in the absence of competitor, were obtained by nonlinear regression with the program Sigmaplot (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA) to the equation, y=a/(1+x/b) where y is the binding expressed as a percentage of the value a observed in the absence of peptide competitor, x is the concentration of peptide competitor, and b is the IC50 value.Ggly Receptor Binding Assay—Ggly was iodinated using the IODOGEN method and purified by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (38.Karelina Y. Baldwin G.S. J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2001; 16: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Binding assays with mono-[125I]Ggly were carried out by methods described previously (39.Yang C.H. Ford J. Karelina Y. Shulkes A. Xiao S.D. Baldwin G.S. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 1071-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 105 IMGE-5 cells/well were seeded in 6-well plates and grown at 33 °C for 24 h. The cells were then serum starved and shifted to 39 °C for 24 h. The next day they were incubated for 60 min at 39 °C in 200 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) containing 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 5 × 105 cpm of [125I]Ggly with or without cold compounds. Nonspecific binding was evaluated with 1 μm cold Ggly. Cells were then washed three times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 1 m NaOH, and the amount of radioactivity bound was measured in a γ-counter.Statistics—Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance, or by one-way repeated measures analysis of variance, as appropriate. If there was a statistically significant difference in the data set, individual values were compared with the appropriate value without bismuth ions by Bonferroni's t test. Differences with p values of <0.05 were considered significant.RESULTSWe have previously utilized quenching of tryptophan fluorescence to show that Ggly bound two trivalent ferric ions in aqueous solution (25.Baldwin G.S. Curtain C.C. Sawyer W.H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10741-10746Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Examination of the structure of Ggly in aqueous solution by 1H NMR spectroscopy indicated that the first ferric ion bound to Glu-7, and the second ferric ion to Glu-8 and Glu-9 (26.Pannequin J. Barnham K.J. Hollande F. Shulkes A. Norton R.S. Baldwin G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48602-48609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The same techniques were used to investigate the hypothesis that gastrins bind bismuth ions.Gastrins Bind Two Bismuth Ions—Ggly binds two ferric ions, and the binding data are well fitted by a model with two equivalent but independent binding sites, with Kd = 0.62 μm (25.Baldwin G.S. Curtain C.C. Sawyer W.H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10741-10746Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that gastrins bound bismuth ions, we compared the ability of trivalent bismuth, chromium, and ferric ions to quench the fluorescence of Gamide and Ggly. Bismuth ions quenched Gamide fluorescence, but the quenching was less marked than with ferric ions; in contrast chromium ions had little effect (Fig. 2A). Similar results were obtained with Ggly (data not shown). When the bismuth data were fitted by non-linear regression to models with either one binding site or two binding sites with identical affinity, the better fit was obtained with a 2-site model (Fig. 2B); when a model with two non-identical binding sites was used the Kd values converged. We conclude that both Gamide and Ggly bind two bismuth ions, and that the two binding sites have very similar affinities. The deviation observed between the experimental data and the lines of best fit may indicate the presence of some co-operativity between binding of the first and second bismuth ions, or of polymeric species because bismuth compounds have a propensity to polymerize. The Kd values obtained for the binding of bismuth ions to Gamide and Ggly were similar to each other, and were 41- and 10-fold higher than the Kd values for the binding of ferric ions to Gamide and Ggly, respectively (Table I).Fig. 2Binding of bismuth ions by gastrins. The tryptophan fluorescence (A) of 10.35 μm Gamide, in 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.0) containing 100 mm NaCl and 0.005% Tween 20, was quenched in the presence of increasing concentrations of trivalent bismuth (▴) or ferric (•) ions, but not chromium (▾) ions. B, the values for the fraction of occupied sites (Fa) for the binding of bismuth ions to Gamide (▴) or Ggly (▿) were calculated, and fitted to various binding models, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The lines of best fit for Gamide (—, Kd = 8.6 ± 1.2 μm) or Ggly (- - -, Kd = 7.3 ± 1.0 μm) were obtained with a model with two independent binding sites with identical affinities. These values were combined with the values from four other experiments to obtain the mean values presented in Table I.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IAffinity of gastrins for bismuth and ferric ionsPeptideBismuth KdReplicatesFerric KdReplicatesμmμmGamide8.2 ± 0.850.2 ± 0.13Ggly5.8 ± 1.450.6 ± 0.212 Open table in a new tab Glutamates 7–9 Act as Bismuth Ligands—To define the ligands involved in bismuth ion binding, we next investigated the effect of bismuth ions on the Ggly NMR spectrum (Fig. 3).

A differentially expressed cDNA, wound-inducible transcript 3.0 (wit3.0), was isolated from oral mucosal wound in rats (Sukotjo, C., Abanmy, A. A., Ogawa, T., and Nishimura, I. (2002) J. Dent. Res. 81, 229–235). The purpose of this study was to characterize the wit3.0 gene structure and the function of its deduced peptide. Human and rat genome databases revealed that the gene for wit3.0 was located in human chromosome 12p11.23 and rat chromosome 4q44. Its human and rat gene structures were well conserved, composed of 7 exons spread over 20 kb. Exon 5 was alternatively spliced generating two transcripts encoding deduced peptides of 215 and 253 amino acids (wit3.0α and wit3.0β, respectively). The protein families data base of alignments (Pfam) analysis suggested the wit3.0 peptide sequence shared similarity with a portion of the myosin II coiled-coil domain consensus sequence. Fibroblasts isolated from the rat oral wound up-regulated wit3.0 expression and exhibited greater ability to contract collagen gel in vitro than fibroblasts isolated from untreated oral mucosa/gingiva. NIH3T3 and rat oral fibroblasts transfected with expression vector containing the coding sequences of wit3.0α or wit3.0β increased in vitro collagen gel contraction. When treated with TGFβ-1, NIH3T3 fibroblast expression of wit3.0 showed no significant change, whereas alpha smooth muscle actin was increased in a dose-dependent manner. These data suggest that there may be a novel wound healing pathway involving wit3.0 underlying the favorable early wound closure characteristics of oral mucosa. Wounds of the oral mucosa show faster closure with less scar formation than skin wounds in other areas. A differentially expressed cDNA, wound-inducible transcript 3.0 (wit3.0), was isolated from oral mucosal wound in rats (Sukotjo, C., Abanmy, A. A., Ogawa, T., and Nishimura, I. (2002) J. Dent.

These data suggest that there may be a novel wound healing pathway involving wit3.0 underlying the favorable early wound closure characteristics of oral mucosa. Tooth extraction is one of the most frequently prescribed oral surgeries (1Marcus S.E. Drury T.F. Brown L.J. Zion G.R. J. Dent. Res. 1996; 75: 684-695Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The surgical removal of a tooth creates a large open wound, which heals generally without complication (2Jahangiri L. Devlin H. Ting K. Nishimura I. J. Prosthet. Dent. 1998; 80: 224-237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Characteristically, the oral mucosa open wound closes rapidly primarily due to the spontaneous approximation of gingival wound margins, often without the aid of surgical suturing (see Fig. 1). Oral mucosa and skin wounds undergo the similar healing sequence, including hemostatis, inflammation, granulation tissue formation, and remodeling of the connective tissue matrix. However, clinical observations and experimental animal studies consistently indicate that the extent of granulation and scar formation in oral mucosa is generally small, and wound healing in the oral mucosa demonstrate the better outcome as compared with the equivalent wound in skin (3Sciubba J.J.

We recently isolated the overlapping full-length cDNAs encoding a differentially expressed gene, wound-inducible transcript 3.0 (wit3.0) from a cDNA library of rat gingiva tissue undergoing wound healing after tooth extraction. We also found, appearing to generate from the wit3.0 gene, two alternative transcripts were presented; these encode 215 (wit3.0α)- and 253 (wit3.0β)-amino acid long peptides. In situ hybridization has revealed that the fibroblasts localized in the oral wound were the cellular source of wit3.0 (13Sukotjo C. Abanmy A.A. Ogawa T. Nishimura I. J. Dent.

Dent. 1988; 60: 381-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Forty-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane inhalation. The gingival tissue firmly attached to the maxillary molars was carefully dissociated by a dental explorer, and the maxillary first, second, and third molars were extracted from the left jaw. The wound healing tissue and the contralateral untreated oral mucosa/gingival tissue were harvested at the predetermined healing time as described below. RT-PCR Studies on Steady-state mRNA Levels of the Extracellular-matrix molecules, Wound-related Molecules, and wit3.0 during Wound Healing—The oral mucosa wound specimen, as well as untreated contralateral gingival tissue, were harvested at postsurgery days 4 and 7. Each tissue specimen was homogenized separately, and total RNA was extracted by the guanidium isothiocyanade method (TRIzol, Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY). After the DNase treatment, 1 μg of total RNA sample was used to synthesize cDNA using random hexamer primer (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Steady-state mRNA levels of the following extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules and wound-related peptides were examined using RT-PCR: type I collagen alpha 1 chain (col1a1), type III collagen alpha 1 chain (col3a1), type XII collagen alpha 1 chain isoforms A, B, 1, and 2 (col12a1A, col12a1B, col12a1-1, and col12a1-2, respectively), TGF-β1, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SM actin) as well as wit3.0α and wit3.0β. Primer sequences and PCR conditions achieving the exponential amplification for each target mRNA molecule are summarized in Table I. During the preliminary experiments, PCR conditions were determined to represent the exponential amplification cycle for each target molecule.

The tissue was minced into ∼2 mm3 under phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (PBS), then rinsed twice with PBS. Minced pieces of the tissue were planted onto the surface of 10-mm cell culture dishes. After 1 h of incubation at 37 °C, 10 ml of growth medium: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), with 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin antibiotics, was added. The fibroblasts were obtained by trypsinization of the primary outgrowth of cells. Isolated primary cells were cultured under 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 80% humidity condition. Growth medium was continually replenished every 4 days. The cells were routinely passaged using 0.05% trypsin in PBS containing 0.53 mm EDTA. Cells used for the experiments were collected from between the 4th and 10th passages. The steady-state level of wit3.0 mRNA was examined by RT-PCR as described above. Collagen gels were cast in 6-well plates from type I collagen/DMEM solution composed of 5 parts of bovine skin collagen type I (Vitrogen 100, Cohesion Corp., Palo Alto, CA), 2 parts of 5× DMEM containing Hepes and gentamicin, 1 part of NaOH (0.142 m), 5 parts of FBS, and 1.5 parts of PBS (16Bateman A. Birney E. Cerruti L. Durbin R. Etwiller L. Eddy S.R. Griffiths-Jones S. Howe K.L. Marshall M. Sonnhammer E.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2021) Google Scholar). The gels were in liquid form at 4 °C and solidified at 37 °C. Primary fibroblasts were seeded into the collagen gel (1.2 × 105 cells/well) and incubated at 37 °C, humidity of 80%, and CO2 level of 5%. Fibroblasts-gel complex contraction was monitored by standardized photography every 10 h for 120 h. The area of fibroblast-gel complex in digitized photographs was measured using Image Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). The ratio of collagen gel area against the culture well area was calculated at each measurement point. Multiple data sets of different groups and different time points were analyzed by repeated measures analysis of variants (ANOVA), or two-way ANOVA at a 5% level. In Silico Search for Human, Rat, and Mouse Genome Databases and the Protein Families Data Base of Alignments—The nucleotide sequence of rat wit3.0 was used to search chromosomal assignment and gene structure in silico using the public human, rat, and mouse genome databases. The genomic sequences were further compared with the cDNA sequences, and the exon structure was determined. The deduced peptide sequences of wit3.0α and wit3.0β were submitted to the online protein families data base of alignment (Pfam) search (16Bateman A. Birney E. Cerruti L. Durbin R. Etwiller L.

The wit3.0 peptide sequence and the candidate sequences were compared by the protein BLAST search. Cellular Localization of wit3.0-FLAG Fusion Peptide in NIH3T3 Fibroblastic Cells—Expression vectors containing a cytomegalovirus promoter leading fusion peptides of FLAG epitope (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO) and wit3.0α or wit3.0β coding sequences were constructed. NIH3T3 fibroblastic cells were transfected with the wit3.0-FLAG fusion peptide expression vectors using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) at 70% confluency. Transfected cells were cultured at 37 °C in DMEM (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B, under 5% CO2 conditions for 24–48 h. Transfected NIH3T3 fibroblastic cells were centrifuged at 500 × g for 2–3 min; nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were separately collected using an NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL) using the manufacturer's protocol. The extracts in Laemmli buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol were subjected to 4–20% SDS-gel electrophoresis. The transferred Western blot was examined with M2 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody using HSP89 monoclonal antibody as a positive cytoplasmic protein control. For fluorescent cytology experiments, NIH3T3 fibroblastic cells were cultured on a Permanox Chamber Slide (Lab Tek, Nalgen Nunc Int., Rochester, NY). Transfection of NIH3T3 fibroblastic cells using recombinant expression vector containing coding sequences of wit3.0α, wit3.0β, and bacterial alkaline phosphatase (BAP: positive control) was performed as previously described. After 24–48 h, cells were washed with Tris-buffered saline/CA (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm calcium chloride) and fixed with freshly prepared 1:1 mix of acetone/methanol for 1 min. Ten micrograms/ml of M5 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody was used as a primary antibody to recognize the FLAG epitope. After 1 h of primary antibody incubation, the chambers were washed five times with Tris-buffered saline/CA. Texas Red, fluorescein-conjugated antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was used as a secondary antibody. Sytox green (Molecular Probes) was used to stain the cell's nucleus, and a confocal laser scanning microscope was used to determine the terminal localization of the wit3.0-translated peptides. In Vitro Gel Contraction Assay for NIH 3T3 Fibroblastic Cells and Rat Gingival Fibroblasts Transfected with wit3.0 Expression Vectors—To test the hypothesis that wit3.0 participates in facilitating fibroblast-derived wound contraction, NIH3T3 fibroblastic cells transfected with the expression vectors containing wit3.0α-FLAG, wit3.0β-FLAG, and bacterial alkaline phosphatase-FLAG fusion peptides were subjected to the in vitro collagen gel contraction assay. The areas of collagen gel of the following four groups were compared: NIH3T3 plus wit3.0α-FLAG, NIH3T3 plus wit3.0β-FLAG, NIH3T3 plus BAP-FLAG (transfection control), and NIH3T3 cells alone (no transfection control). Antisense oligonucleotide treatment was performed to validate the effect of wit3.0 on gel contraction. Antisense oligonucleotide: 5′-CTGAATGGTGCAGCTCAT-3′ and Sense oligonucleotide: 5′-ATGAGCTGCACCATTCAG-3′ were dissolved in DMEM culture medium into 100 μm stock solution and sterilized by filtration through 0.2 μm cellulose acetate filter. Serum free medium containing 2 μm oligonucleotide was mixed with LipofectAMINE and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The mixture was later added to the NIH3T3 fibroblastic cells that had previously received one of each expression vectors containing wit3.0α-FLAG, wit3.0β-FLAG, or BAP-FLAG fusion peptide. Cells were incubated for 4 h without serum prior to addition of FBS. Subsequently, the cells were divided into two groups. The first group was further incubated for 24 h at 37 °C and subjected for Western blot assay using M2 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody. The second group was mixed with bovine type I collagen gel solution (Vitrogen 100, Cohesion Corp, Palo Alto, CA) as described above to a concentration of 1 × 105 cells/ml/well. Non-transfected cells served as an untreated control in both groups. A consistent volume of collagen gel was used throughout the experiment. Solidified gel was released from the well after 2 h of incubation. Standardized photography was used to monitor the longitudinal gel contraction. In a separate experiment, rat gingival fibroblasts were transfected with each of expression vectors containing wit3.0α-FLAG or wit3.0β-FLAG, or both simultaneously. The expression levels of wit3.0 mRNAs were confirmed by RT-PCR. The transfected and untreated rat gingival fibroblasts as well as rat oral wound fibroblasts were subjected to in vitro collagen contraction assay as described above. Transforming Growth Factor-β1 Treatment of NIH3T3 Fibroblastic Cells—NIH3T3 fibroblastic cells were cultured in a 6-well plate at a cell density of 1 × 104 cells/cm2. The cells were starved for 12 h in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% FBS and 1× Amphotericin B and penicillin (3 ml/well). After 12 h, 0.1 or 5.0 ng/ml of TGF-β1 was added to the culture medium. No TGF-β1 addition was used as a control. The cells were cultured at 37 °C, humidity of 80%, and 5% CO2 level for an additional 18 h until total RNA from the cells was extracted using the TRIzol method. α-SM actin and wit3.0 expressions were examined by RT-PCR. The housekeeping gene, β-actin, was used to standardize the gene expression level. Primer sequences and PCR conditions representing experiments performed in triplicate are listed in Table I. Oral Mucosa Wound Healing Profile—Rapid wound healing as shown in the rat oral wound model was reinforced in our studies. Following tooth extraction, by day 4 of wound healing, granulation tissue, through which thin epithelial cell layers migrate (Fig. 1C, arrowheads), was apparent. By day 7, the wound closure progresses by approximation of the wound margins (Fig. 1D). During early wound healing stage, TGFβ-1 and α-SM actin mRNAs increased moderately, whereas synthesis of both wit3.0α and wit3.0β mRNAs was robust. Expression of type I collagen mRNA during the first week remained at the baseline level, whereas synthesis of type III, type XIIB-1, and XIIB-2 collagens increased (Fig. 1E). Fibroblasts isolated from day 7 wound healing tissue maintained the high level of wit3.0 expression even after 10 passages. Both wound fibroblasts and untreated gingival fibroblast controls exhibited more than 95% contraction during the first 15–20 h of incubation in the in vitro collagen gel contraction assay (Fig. 1F). The wound fibroblasts-gel complex showed significantly greater intensity of contraction than untreated control fibroblasts-gel complex (p < 0.05). Although the contraction rate of both leveled off after 20 h, fibroblasts from the wounded tissue exhibited greater overall gel contraction (42% ± 7.3 of its original area) compared with that of untreated gingival fibroblasts (76% ± 9.6) as shown in Fig. 1F. In Silico Evaluation of the wit3.0 Gene and Peptide Structures—Matches in the online genome databases located the nucleotide sequence of wit3.0 within human chromosome 12p11.23 and rat chromosome 4q44 (Fig. 2A). The genomic DNA structures of human and rat wit3.0 were highly conserved and encoded by seven exons spread over 20 kbp (Fig. 2B). The deduced peptide sequence was encoded by a part of exon 2, exons 3–6, and a part of exon 7. Exon 1 encoded the 5′-untranslated region; exon 7, the large 3′-untranslated region. Exon 5 encoded the in-frame insertion sequence found in wit3.0β but not in wit3.0α (Fig. 2, B and C). Rat wit3.0-deduced peptide sequence was searched in BLAST for homologous sequences. Results showed matches with myosin heavy chain among Oryctolagus cuniculus (44% positive amino acid match, including 22% identical match), Drosophila melanogaster (42% positive amino acid match, including 21% identical match), and Argopecten irradians (43% positive amino acid match, including 24% identical match). The 228 amino acids that match with skeletal muscle myosin heavy chain belong to a conserved domain: pfam01576.8 (35% positive amino acid match, including 15% identical match). With a consensus sequence of 860 amino acids, pfam 01576.8 myosin tail family consists of the coiled-coil myosin heavy chain tail region (Fig. 3). In addition, wit3.0 matched with pfam COG4372 (499 amino acids long), which is an uncharacterized protein conserved in bacteria with the myosin-like domain (data not shown). Intracellular Peptide Localization—NIH3T3 fibroblastic cells overexpressing the wit3.0-FLAG fusion peptide showed that both wit3.0α-FLAG and wit3.0β-FLAG peptides were detected in the cytoplasmic fraction by Western blot (Fig. 4, A and B, respectively). wit3.0α and wit3.0β-FLAG peptides were demonstrated as the single band of 40 kDa and 43 kDa, respectively, with or without the β-mercaptoethanol treatment. Confocal laser scanning microscopy confirmed that wit3.0α and wit3.0β localized in the cytoplasm of transfected fibroblasts (Fig. 4, C and D, respectively). The Effect of wit3.0 on Collagen Gel Contraction—Gel contraction rate in NIH3T3 fibroblastic cells overexpressing wit3.0α or wit3.0β was significantly higher than the control groups (p < 0.05) as shown in Table II. The BAP transfection control and non-transfected control groups showed no differences in gel area size at each time point. The antisense oligonucleotide designed to block wit3.0β mRNA partially inhibited the wit3.0β-FLAG peptide synthesis. The accelerated collagen gel contraction in the wit3.0β transfection group was partially but significantly blocked by the antisense treatment (p < 0.05) (Fig. 5A). Treatment with the sense oligonucleotide also decreased the wit3.0β-FLAG peptide synthesis and proportionately decreased the accelerated collagen gel contraction. The effect of wit3.0 on the collagen contraction lasted up to 15–20 h. Similarly, the rat gingival fibroblasts overexpressing wit3.0α or wit3.0β peptides exhibited the increased collagen gel contraction as compared with the untransfected gingival fibroblast control (p < 0.05). The gingival fibroblasts received both wit3.0α and wit3.0β expression vectors demonstrated more increased collagen gel contraction as compared with the untransfected gingival fibroblast control (p < 0.01); however, the contraction rates of these transfected gingival fibroblast groups did not reach the collagen gel contraction rate of wound fibroblasts (Fig. 5B).Table IIAreas of fibroblasts/gel complex (% of the culture well ± S.D.)TimeNo transfection control (NIH3T3)Transfection control (NIH3T3 + BAP)Overexpressing wit3.0α (NIH3T3 + wit3.0α)Overexpressing wit3.0β (NIH3T3 + wit3.0β)h%697.8 ± 1.196.7 ± 2.785.2 ± 2.5ap < 0.05 as compared to the no transfection control.84.0 ± 1.1ap < 0.05 as compared to the no transfection control.970.2 ± 0.972.5 ± 3.563.2 ± 1.9ap < 0.05 as compared to the no transfection control.59.9 ± 3.0ap < 0.05 as compared to the no transfection control.1260.6 ± 2.261.3 ± 1.949.2 ± 2.8ap < 0.05 as compared to the no transfection control.45.7 ± 0.9ap < 0.05 as compared to the no transfection control.1545.7 ± 0.646.9 ± 1.636.9 ± 0.1ap < 0.05 as compared to the no transfection control.35.6 ± 0.8ap < 0.05 as compared to the no transfection control.1838.0 ± 0.835.6 ± 0.630.9 ± 0.3ap < 0.05 as compared to the no transfection control.26.2 ± 1.2ap < 0.05 as compared to the no transfection control.2132.9 ± 0.930.5 ± 0.427.0 ± 1.2ap < 0.05 as compared to the no transfection control.23.4 ± 1.5ap < 0.05 as compared to the no transfection control.2424.9 ± 0.423.0 ± 1.119.9 ± 0.2ap < 0.05 as compared to the no transfection control.17.3 ± 1.0ap < 0.05 as compared to the no transfection control.a p < 0.05 as compared to the no transfection control. Open table in a new tab The Effect of TGF-β1 on wit3.0 Expression—The expression of α-SM actin mRNA in NIH3T3 fibroblastic cells increased 1.6-fold with 0.1 ng/ml and 1.8-fold with 5.0 ng/ml of TGF-β1, compared with the untreated control as shown in Fig. 5C. NIH3T3 fibroblasts expressed both wit3.0α and wit3.0β mRNAs at baseline level. When treated with TGF-β1 (0.1 and 5.0 ng/ml), NIH3T3 fibroblasts showed non-significant increase in wit3.0α and wit3.0β mRNA levels (Fig. 5D). Factorial ANOVA analysis revealed that only α-SM actin increased significantly with TGF-β1 treatment (p < 0.05). The steady-state mRNA levels of wit3.0α and wit3.0β were not significantly affected by the TGF-β1 treatment. As shown, rapid wound closure by the approximation of wound margins in the rat oral mucosal wound by tooth extraction (Fig. 1, A–D) was observed, along with accelerated collagen gel contraction during the initial 15- to 20-h period (Fig. 1F). The inflammatory response to the injury in oral mucosa has been shown less in the equivalent dermal wound (9Szpaderska A.M. Zuckerman J.D. DiPietro L.A. J. Dent. Res. 2003; 82: 621-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), and the expression of cytokines is relatively minimal in oral wound tissue during the healing period compared with other tissues (5Stephens P.

Song B. Torio A.J. Gallagher G.T. Tsuji T. Elovic A. McBride J. Yung C.M. Galli S.J. Weller P.F. Wong D.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G191-G202PubMed Google Scholar, 20Ohshima M. Sato M. Ishikawa M.

The RT-PCR analysis in the present study generally support that the transcriptional response to the tooth extraction wound was mild to moderate among the genes examined. Therefore, it was distinctively noted that the steady-state mRNA level of wit3.0 increased the most from an initial minimal state to 40-fold within 4 days and over 50-fold after 1 week of healing. Utilizing the genomic DNA sequence databases of humans and other animals recently available, the chromosomal location of wit3.0 was determined to be 12p11.23 in the human and 4q44 in the rat. The mouse data base indicated a wit3.0 match, but the chromosomal location has not yet been determined. The Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) data base (21Wheeler D.L. Church D.M. Lash A.E. Leipe D.D. Madden T.L. Pontius J.U. Schuler G.D. Schriml L.M. Tatusova T.A. Wagner L. Rapp B.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 22Hamosh A. Scott A.F. Amberger J. Bocchini C. Valle D. McKusick V.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 52-55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for known inheritable diseases linked to the 12p11.23 allele did not reveal wit3.0 linkage to any recorded diseases. The overlapping rat wit3.0 cDNAs of 2746 bp suggest a small open reading frame of 645 bp (13Sukotjo C. Abanmy A.A. Ogawa T. Nishimura I. J. Dent. Res. 2002; 81: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The online genome data base search showed that the open reading frame was encoded from exon 2 through exon 7 in both humans and rats. The disproportionately large 3′-untranslated region was encoded in the last exon 7. Based on the complete agreement between cDNA and genomic DNA exon sequences, as well as the highly conserved gene structure, we concluded that the coding sequence of wit3.0 might translate to a functional protein. Furthermore, our new data clearly show that alternative splicing of exon 5 accounts for the previously reported two different transcripts, wit3.0α and wit3.0β (13Sukotjo C. Abanmy A.A. Ogawa T. Nishimura I. J. Dent. Res. 2002; 81: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The wit3.0 deduced peptide was correlated with the Pfam consensus sequence motif of myosin heavy chain II coiled-coil domain (Fig. 3). Myosin heavy chain II is a multidomain protein important for both cellular structure and contraction (23Wendel B. Reinhard R. Wachtendorf U. Zacharzowsky U.B. Osterziel K.J. Schulte H.D. Haase H. Hoehe M.R. Morano I. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 79: 566-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 24Morano I. J. Mol. Med. 2003; 81: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Myosin heavy chain II molecules are dimerized through the coiled-coil α-helix and provide the phosphorylation site. Thus, the coiled-coil domain is thought to regulate the ability of the myosin to produce force (25Trybus K.M. Freyzon Y. Faust L.Z. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 26Ikebe M. Yamada M. Mabuchi K. Kambara T. Ikebe R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10768-10774Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 27Hoppe P.E. Andrews R.C. Parikh P.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1677-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The peptide sequence of wit3.0β suggests a potential α-helix structure (Fig. 2C). The wit3.0-FLAG peptide examined on the SDS-PAGE Western blot appeared as a single peptide (Fig. 4, A and B); however, because the myosin dimer is formed through ionic bonding, the possible molecular interaction by wit3.0 remains to be examined. Our studies localized both wit3.0α and wit3.0β to cytoplasmic sites in the fibroblasts we studied. Together with the possible structural relationship with the myosin heavy chain II, which plays a regulatory role in the myofilament-cytoskeleton complex, we postulated that wit3.0 may participate in the fibroblast-derived wound contraction. Tested in our in vitro collagen gel contraction assay, fibroblasts overexpressing wit3.0α or wit3.0β peptides contracted the collagen gel at the faster rate than controls. The accelerated in vitro gel contraction was temporally limited to the first 15- to 20-h period. Because the presence of wit3.0-FLAG fusion peptides was confirmed by Western blot after the collagen contraction assay (data not shown), the change in the collagen contraction rate only during the initial period is unlikely due to depletion of wit3.0 expression vectors. There is a considerable similarity in the gel contraction profile between transfected fibroblasts overexpressing wit3.0 and oral wound fibroblasts, which continued to up-regulate the endogenous wit3.0 expression. Thus, we speculated that the contribution of wit3.0 to wound contraction might require unidentified cofactors or partner molecules that are not simulated in the in vitro experiments. Early wound contraction, typically characterized by actively proliferating, migrating epithelial cells and loose connective tissue ECM, is an essential initial healing process that establishes the epithelial integrity in the dermal and mucosal open wound. Clinical observations suggest that migration of fibroblasts into and through the ECM during the initial phase of wound healing, prior to the expression of α-SM actin, appears to be a fundamental component of wound contraction (28Nedelec B. Ghahary A. Scott P.G. Tredget E.E. Hand Clin. 2000; 16: 289-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Due to the greater compliance of immature connective tissue, early wound contraction does not result in generating tensile stress. The wound repair process continues to precipitate ECM, and the wound connective tissue increasingly becomes rigid. The inflexible ECM combined with a group of cytokines stimulates the differentiation of myofibroblasts expressing α-SM actin (29Arora P.D. Narani N. McCulloch C.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 871-882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 30Lanning D.A. Diegelmann R.F. Yager D.R. Wallace M.L. Bagwell C.E. Haynes J.H. J. Pediatr. Surg. 2000; 35: 183-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), which are more prevalent in the late wound repair tissue. The findings in our studies supported that TGFβ stimulated the α-SM actin expression. Other studies showed TGFβ has a capacity to accelerate the contraction rate of NIH3T3, BHK-21 cell lines, and human foreskin fibroblast cultured in collagen gel (31Montesano R. Orci L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4894-4897Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), which has been believed to be caused by the increased synthesis of α-SM actin. Although the myofibroblast-mediated wound contraction mechanism has been well investigated, the mechanism responsible for the initial wound contraction is poorly understood. The involvement of wit3.0 in the initial wound contraction may shed the light to new investigations on this important wound-healing process.

BimC is the founding member of the BimC/Eg5 or N-2 class of motor proteins in the kinesin superfamily (see Refs. 1Kim A.J. Endow S.A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113 (Pt. 21): 3681-3682PubMed Google Scholar and 2Miki H. Setou M. Kaneshiro K. Hirokawa N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7004-7011Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). The motor domain is at the N terminus, followed by an extended region with a number of predicted coiled-coil domains. BimC was first discovered in Aspergillus nidulans (3Enos A.P. Morris N.R. Cell. 1990; 60: 1019-1027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), and members of this class are widely distributed from yeast to higher organisms. The native molecule is a homotetramer that is apparently formed by antiparallel combination of two parallel dimers (see Ref. 4Kashina A.S. Rogers G.C. Scholey J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1357: 257-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar for review).

The motor domains are at each end of the tetramer and are attached to different microtubules that are capable of producing the sliding that pushes apart the poles (5Sharp D.J. McDonald K.L.

Because of its role in mitosis, human Eg5 is an attractive target for drug development, and monastrol is a reversible inhibitor of Eg5 that blocks mitosis (6Mayer T.U. Kapoor T.M. Haggarty S.J.

Detailed studies of the kinetics and structural properties of BimC motor domains from lower organisms have not been performed, but the related Eg5 from higher organisms has been studied more extensively. The crystal structure of the motor domain of human Eg5 (9Turner J. Anderson R. Guo J. Beraud C. Fletterick R. Sakowicz R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25496-25502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) indicates that the overall folding of the motor domain is similar to that of other kinesins, but the neck linker is in a novel conformation. Image reconstruction of decorated MTs indicates that the attached head of an Eg5 dimer is in a similar position to that of other kinesins with an additional detached density whose position is less sensitive to nucleotide than to conventional kinesin (10Hirose K. Henningsen U. Schliwa M. Toyoshima C. Shimizu T. Alonso M. Cross R.A. Amos L.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5308-5314Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Initial kinetic characterization (11Lockhart A. Cross R.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2365-2373Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) established that the ATPase mechanism of Eg5 was similar to that of conventional kinesin except that it was slower, with ADP release being at least partially rate-limiting and with non-hydrolyzable ATP analogs producing tighter binding to MTs. Unlike conventional kinesin, however, there are indications that Eg5 dimers are not processive (12Crevel I.M. Lockhart A. Cross R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 160-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Recent work has indicated how the kinetics and state of oligomerization vary with inclusion of increasing regions of the neck coil (7Maliga Z. Kapoor T. Mitchison T.J. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 989-996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 8DeBonis S. Simorre J.P. Crevel I. Lebeau L. Skoufias D.A. Blangy A. Ebel C. Gans P. Cross R. Hackney D.D. Wade R.H. Kozielski F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 338-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Although BimC is classified as an N-terminal motor because of its grouping with other N-terminal motors by similarity of sequence of the motor domains, BimC from A. nidulans actually has a significant domain of ∼70 amino acids appended to the N terminus of the motor (3Enos A.P. Morris N.R. Cell. 1990; 60: 1019-1027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). This N-terminal extension (Nte) is highly positively charged and has weak sequence similarity to part of the proline-rich region of MAP2 that is involved in MT binding (Fig. 1). These features suggest that the Nte of BimC may constitute a second MT-binding site that could influence the kinetics of BimC and its affinity for MTs. We report here that the Nte binds independently to MTs and that attachment of the Nte to the BimC motor domain greatly increases the affinity for MTs. Furthermore, the Nte can act in a modular manner, as attachment of the Nte to the motor domain of conventional kinesin also results in a large increase in affinity for MTs, without significant inhibition of kcat or sliding velocity. Construction of Expression Plasmids—The BimC constructs indicated in Figs. 1, 2, 3 were derived from the partial cDNA clone and the overlapping genomic clone of Enos and Morris (3Enos A.P. Morris N.R. Cell. 1990; 60: 1019-1027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The cDNA and genomic clones were fused to generate a full-length construct using the DdeI site at position 559. PCR was then used to generate a series of motor domain constructs that were cloned into pET21 (Novagen) for expression. BC72M is a nonfusion protein that contains the core motor domain and the region homologous to the neck linker of conventional kinesin but lacks the Nte of BimC. It was obtained by converting Ile72 of BimC into an initiation methionine and introducing a stop codon after Lys428. Although BC72M expresses well, constructs beginning at residue 1 and containing the Nte did not express protein at detectable levels. The 5′ coding region is highly enriched in GC base pairs, and a new primer with the sequence GCCATGCGTGGTCCGCAGCGTGCTACTTATGG was used to reduce the number of GC base pairs and to replace codons with unfavorable usage by Escherichia coli. This new construct had detectable, but low, levels of expression as a non-fusion protein. The amount of protein that could be isolated, however, was not enough for extensive biochemical characterization, and this construct was subsequently subcloned into pET32 (Novagen) as a fusion protein with thioredoxin (TT-BC1M), which expressed at a high level.Fig. 3Sequences of thioredoxin fusion proteins and the products of cleavage with thrombin. Most of the motor domain constructs described in Fig. 2 were expressed as fusion proteins with thioredoxin (Trx) and cleaved with thrombin to release the motor domain. The sequences of the fusion junctions and the final cleaved proteins are indicated. Unless otherwise indicated, all of the experiments reported here with constructs containing the full Nte were performed with the version having the S9Y substitution (see “Experimental Procedures”). More limited results with the version having the wild-type Ser-9 (see “Results”) indicated no significant difference in properties between the two versions. The TT series are thioredoxin fusions derived from pET32 (Novagen), with the DNA sequence for the terminal Gly-Ser of the thrombin cleavage site converted into a restriction site for BamH1 to facilitate cassette cloning. The location of thrombin cleavage is indicated by an arrow. Cleavage of these constructs with thrombin yields proteins with Gly-Ser appended to the N terminus, as indicated. The TM series are fusions with thioredoxin in which a BamH1 site has been introduced at the end of the spacer after thioredoxin. Consequently, the TM series has lost the His tag and the thrombin cleavage site. TM-Nte extends to residue 71, with an additional Gly appended to the C terminus.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The DNA sequence of the derived constructs did not agree completely with the published sequence (GenBankTM accession number M32075; Ref. 3Enos A.P. Morris N.R. Cell. 1990; 60: 1019-1027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). A sample of whole genomic DNA from A. nidulans was also kindly provided by N. R. Morris. PCR was used to amplify the regions where discrepancies were found. The sequence of these genomic samples matched the sequence of the original clones provided by Enos and Morris (3Enos A.P. Morris N.R. Cell. 1990; 60: 1019-1027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) and the above constructs derived from them but did not match the published sequence. The revised sequence has three amino acid changes from that of the published sequence as Tyr to Ser at position 9, Gly to Pro at position 12, and Met to Ile at position 393. All of the clones used for the work reported here contain the wild-type Pro12 and Ile393. Clones derived from the modified 5′-primer above, however, contain Tyr at position 9 instead of Ser because the 5′ PCR primer was originally designed to match the published sequence. Ser9 is near the N terminus in a region that is likely to be unstructured and outside of the region of sequence similarity with MAP2. Consequently the change of Ser to Tyr at position 9 is not likely to significantly affect the MT binding properties. As a control, constructs containing the wild-type Ser9 were also generated as indicated in Fig. 3, and their ATPase and hydrodynamic properties were indistinguishable for those containing the S9Y substitution (see “Results”). TT-BKinM and TT-BKin412GS contain the same N-terminal region of BimC fused to thioredoxin as described for TT-BC1M(Tyr9), but the motor domain of BimC is replaced by the motor domain of conventional kinesin as indicted in Figs. 1, 2, 3. DKH412GS and BKin412GS in addition are fused at the C terminus to cytoplasmic gelsolin derived from pKN172 (13Way M. Gooch J. Pope B. Weeds A.G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 593-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Protein Expression and Purification—General procedures for induction and purification on phosphocellulose were carried out as described (14Stock M.F. Hackney D.D. Vernos I. Methods in Molecular Biology-Kinesin Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2001: 43-48Google Scholar). MgATP was maintained at ≥0.1 mm during the purification of all constructs containing the motor domain. DKH412GS and BC72M were expressed as non-fusion proteins and purified essentially as described for conventional kinesin motor domains (14Stock M.F. Hackney D.D. Vernos I. Methods in Molecular Biology-Kinesin Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2001: 43-48Google Scholar, 15Huang T.-G. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16493-16501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The TT series of thioredoxin fusions (Fig. 3) contains a His tag, and they were purified by both phosphocellulose and Ni-NTA metal affinity chromatography. The fusion proteins were cleaved with thrombin, and the released motor domains were separated from thioredoxin and thrombin by chromatography on phosphocellulose at pH 6.5. TM-Nte does not contain a His tag and was purified by chromatography on phosphocellulose and gel filtration on Sephacryl S-300. Final preparations were dialyzed against 50% glycerol in A25 buffer with 50 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol and 0.1 mm MgATP (for motor domain constructs) and stored at -80 °C in small aliquots. Taxol-stabilized MTs were prepared from phosphocellulose-purified tubulin as described (16Hackney D.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4437-4446Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), except that the source of the tubulin was pig brain rather than cow brain. MT concentrations are reported as the concentration of tubulin heterodimers. Hydrodynamic Characterization—Gel filtration and velocity sedimentation in a sucrose gradient were used to estimate the D20,w and s20,w values. Standards proteins were bovine catalase, bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, bovine carbonic anhydrase, and bovine cytochrome c with s20,w values of 11.3, 4.4, 3.7, 3.0, and 1.9 S and D20,w values of 4.4, 6.1, 7.4, 9.3, and 12.7 × 107 cm2/s, respectively. Most values are from Ref. 17Sober H. Handbook of Biochemistry. Chemical Rubber Co., Cleveland, OH1968Google Scholar, but in some cases, the literature values are not self-consistent, and minor adjustments have been made so that each set of s20,w, D20,w, and Mr values obeys the Svedberg equation and yields an f/fmin > 1.10. Gel filtration chromatography was done on Sephacryl S-300 (Amersham Biosciences). Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE to determine the peak positions. Cytochrome c is retarded on the column at low ionic strength and was not included in the regression in determinations in the absence of added NaCl. Ultracentrifugation was performed on 5-ml linear gradients of 9–20% sucrose in an MLS-50 rotor (Beckman-Coulter) that were approximately isokinetic at 4 °C for proteins, with a partial specific volume of 0.73 cm3/g. The buffer used was A25 buffer (25 mm potassium ACES, pH 6.9, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm K-EGTA, 0.1 mm K-EDTA and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol) with 25 mm KCl and was supplemented with 200 mm NaCl, as indicated. For motor domains, the centrifugation was for 15 h at 44,000 rpm with catalase, serum albumin and carbonic anhydrase as standards. For the smaller TM-Nte constructs, centrifugation was for 36 h at 50,000 rpm with ovalbumin, carbonic anhydrase and cytochrome c as standards. A partial specific volume of 0.73 cm3/g was used in all calculations. Kinetic and Binding Measurements—All reactions and binding experiments were conducted at 25 °C in A25 buffer supplemented with KCl and NaCl as indicated. The coupled enzyme system of pyruvate kinase and lactic dehydrogenase were used to monitor ATP hydrolysis in the presence of 2 mm P-enolpyruvate and 1 mm MgATP as described (15Huang T.-G. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16493-16501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Stock M.F. Hackney D.D. Vernos I. Methods in Molecular Biology-Kinesin Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2001: 65-72Google Scholar). Determination of kcat and K0.5(MT) values were typically performed at 5 or more concentrations of MTs in duplicate, with error bars indicating the range of the values. The data were fit by nonlinear regression to the full quadratic expression for mutual depletion (19Griffiths J.R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1979; 7: 429-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) using the Solver routine of Excel (Microsoft). When it was not possible to go to a high enough MT concentration to accurately determine kcat and K0.5(MT) separately, only the kbi(ATPase) ratio equal to kcat/K0.5(MT) is reported. At high ionic strength when the maximum MT concentration was much less than K0.5(MT), the kbi(ATPase) value was determined from the linear increase in rate with increasing MT concentration. Motility—Short F-actin filaments were capped with complexes of kinesin-gelsolin fusion proteins and labeled with rhodamine phalloidin essentially as described by Yajima et al. (20Yajima J. Alonso M.C. Cross R.A. Toyoshima Y.Y. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 301-306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The complexes with F-actin were formed in 100 mm KCl in A25 buffer without EDTA or EGTA and containing 1 mm MgATP and 1 mm CaCl2. Immediately before loading into a flow cell for observation, the complexes were diluted 1:100 into the same buffer but without CaCl2 and with 25 mm KCl and 0.4 mg/ml casein. Movement of these complexes along salt-washed sea urchin sperm axonemes was observed by fluorescence microscopy with an Olympus XI71 microscope using excitation by a 10 milliwatt laser at 532 nm (Beta Electronics) and a 550–610 nm bandpass filter for emission. A 60 × 1.45 numerical aperture objective was used with an additional 4× projection lens. Images were acquired with a PicIII intensified camera (Instrutech) at 30 frames/s, recorded on S-VHS tape, digitized, and analyzed with NIH-Image. In some cases, a rolling average of 2 or 4 video frames was used. Motility was only measured for spots that exhibited continuous movement for > 1 s. Motility was difficult to observe with BKin412GS because most of the short actin filaments rapidly became tethered to the surface of the coverslip through one end only, with the other end moving freely in solution. This was also observed with DKH412GS, but to a much reduced extent. Pretreatment of the coverslip with the basic protein lysozyme reduced the amount of surface binding, suggesting that the binding was enhanced by the interaction of the positive Nte with anionic sites on the coverslip. For all of the measurements reported here, the coverslips were washed with detergent, blocked with lysozyme at 2 mg/ml for 5 min, thoroughly rinsed with water, and air dried before assembly of a flow cell using two strips of double-sided tape. Axonemes were flowed through the cell to allow attachment, and then the cell was flushed with buffer containing 0.4 mg/ml casein to further block the surface before introduction of the motor-actin complexes. Properties of BimC Motor Domain—Previous work (21Jiang W. Stock M. Li X. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7626-7632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) indicated that DKH346 (residues 1–346 of Drosophila kinesin as indicated in Fig. 1A) is a good model for a motor domain of conventional kinesin that contains the core ATPase domain of Drosophila kinesin plus a complete neck linker. DHK346 is monomeric because it lacks the neck coiled-coil region that is required for dimerization. BC72M (see Figs. 1, 2, and 3) is an analogous BimC construct that begins and ends on positions that are equivalent in a sequence alignment to positions 3 and 345 of Drosophila kinesin. Hydrodynamic analysis (Table I) indicates that BC72M is also monomeric. The basal ATPase rate in the absence of MTs is ∼0.1 s-1 for all of the BimC motor domain constructs studied here. The dependence of the ATPase rate of BC72M on the concentration of MTs over a range of KCl concentrations is given in Fig. 4A, and kinetic parameters are summarized in Table II. Even in low salt buffer, saturation is far from complete at the highest MT concentration. The kcat value for the maximum ATPase rate at saturating levels of MTs and the K0.5(MT) value for the concentration of MTs producing half the maximum rate can only be estimated at ∼31 s-1 and ∼17 μm, respectively, in 3 mm KCl. At higher ionic strength, the ATPase rate is strongly inhibited, as is also observed with other kinesin family members. Separate estimation of kcat and K0.5(MT) values is not feasible at higher salt, but the bimolecular rate kbi(ATPase) = kcat/K0.5(MT) can still be determined, and the dependence of kbi(ATPase) on ionic strength is indicated in Fig. 5. For comparison, the ATPase rate of the motor domain of conventional kinesin (DKH346) was determined at 3 and 25 mm KCl as indicated in Fig. 4B. The kcat and K0.5(MT) values of ∼86 s-1 and ∼5 μm in 3 mm KCl for DKH346 indicate that BimC is slower than an equivalent construct of conventional kinesin and has weaker affinity for MTs in the presence of ATP.Table IHydrodynamic characterization Hydrodynamic parameters were determined by velocity sedimentation in a sucrose gradient and by gel filtration as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Analysis was performed in A25 buffer with 25 mm KCl for BC72M and BC1M and with 200 mm NaCl for TM-Nte and TM-S.ConstructsS20,w (S)D20,wMraCalculated by the Svedberg equation SvedbergMrbCalculated from the amino acid sequence PeptideOligomeric state×107 cm2/s×10-3×10-3BC72M3.22 ± 0.11 (4Kashina A.S.

Slopes for BC72M and BC1M are -2.8 and -9.8, respectively. Data at <50 mm KCl were not included in the fit for BC1M. The ionic strength of the ATPase reaction is 0.042 in the absence of added KCl or NaCl.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Influence of Nte—BC1M contains the full Nte domain of BimC in addition to the motor domain and neck linker of BC72M as indicated in Figs. 1, 2, 3. The D20,w value of BC1M could not be obtained by gel filtration because it binds to the column, even in the presence of 200 mm NaCl, but the sedimentation coefficient of 3.3 S (Table I) is similar to that of BC72M and indicates that BC1M is also a monomer under these conditions. Inclusion of the Nte in BC1M produces a striking increase in the affinity of the motor for MTs during ATP hydrolysis as indicated in Fig. 6. At 3 mm KCl in Fig. 6A, the activation by MTs is close to stoichiometric, even at a BimC concentration of only 8.3 nm. Exact determination of the K0.5(MT) value under these conditions is complicated by the tight binding with K0.5(MT) < Etotal and the possibility that the affinity for BimC may change as the MT lattice approaches saturation with bound BimC. However, the 7000-fold decrease in K0.5(MT) on addition of the Nte (∼0.0025 μm for BC1M versus ∼17 μm for BC72M) clearly indicates a dramatic increase in MT affinity. The kcat value of 24 s-1 for BC1M is similar to the value of ∼33 s-1 for BC72M, indicating that addition of the Nte does not prevent catalytic turnover at close to the normal rate. The kbi(ATPase) of BC1M is also strongly dependent on ionic strength (Fig. 6), and the dependence is even greater than for BC72M, as indicated in Fig. 5. BC1M with wild-type Ser at position 9 has kcat and K0.5(MT) values of 24.2 s-1 and 0.118 μm, respectively, in 75 mm KCl. These values are essentially identical to the corresponding values of 24.5 s-1 and 0.107 μm for BC1M with Tyr at position 9 (Table II); thus, this substitution has no influence on kcat or MT affinity. BimC contains a region with a high concentration of mixed negative and positively charged groups that immediately adjoins the motor domain (Fig. 1). BC65M contains this highly charged region but lacks the highly positively charged MSR region with similarity to MAP2. The MT-stimulated ATPase of BC65M is elevated over that of BC72M as indicated in Fig. 5 and Table II. However, the increase represents only a fraction of the total increase produced by the full Nte. In the linear phase of the ionic strength dependence of BC1M at 50 mm KCl, the kbi(ATPase) value of 1.54 μm-1 s-1 for BC65M is 5-fold larger than for BC72M but still 1300-fold smaller than for BC1M. Ionic Strength Dependence—The influence of the Nte decreases with increasing ionic strength as seen by the convergence of the lines for BC72M and BC1M in Fig. 5 at high ionic strength. This suggests that the Nte has a diminished influence at physiological ionic strength, but even at 200 mm KCl the Nte still produces almost a 10-fold increase in kbi(ATPase) (Table II). Also, MT-stimulated ADP release of conventional kinesin has a large dependence on the nature of the anion, with chloride being more inhibitory than acetate or aspartate (22Cheng J.Q. Jiang W. Hackney D.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5288-5295Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), which are more typical of physiological conditions. The kbi(ATPase) of BC1M, BC65M, and BC72M are 1.01 ± 0.07 (3Enos A.P. Morris N.R. Cell. 1990; 60: 1019-1027Abstract Full"
https://openalex.org/W2061902215,"Activation of the serine/threonine kinase c-Raf-1 requires membrane localization, phosphorylation, and oligomerization. To study these mechanisms of Raf activation more precisely, we have used a membrane-localized fusion protein, myr-Raf-GyrB, which can be activated by coumermycin-induced oligomerization in NIH3T3 transfectants. By introducing a series of point mutations into the myr-Raf-GyrB kinase domain (S338A, S338A/Y341F, Y340F/Y341F, and T491A/S494A) we can separately study the role that membrane localization, phosphorylation, and oligomerization play in the process of Raf activation. We find that phosphorylation of Ser-338 plays a critical role in Raf activation and that this requires membrane localization but not oligomerization of Raf. Mutation of Tyr-341 had a limited effect, whereas mutation of both Ser-338 and Tyr-341 resulted in a synergistic loss of Raf activation following coumermycin-induced dimerization. Importantly, we found that membrane localization and phosphorylation of Ser-338 were not sufficient to activate Raf in the absence of oligomerization. Thus, our studies suggest that three key steps are required for optimal Raf activation: recruitment to the plasma membrane by GTP-bound Ras, phosphorylation via membrane-resident kinases, and oligomerization."
https://openalex.org/W2006673705,"Over a decade ago, the gene STT3 was identified in a staurosporine and temperature sensitivity screen of yeast. Subsequently the product of this gene was shown to be a subunit of the endoplasmic reticulum-localized oligosaccharyl transferase (OT) complex. Although stt3 mutants are known to be staurosporine-sensitive, we found that mutants of other OT subunits (except ost4Δ) are staurosporine-resistant, which indicates that this phenotype of stt3 mutants is not simply a consequence of their defect in glycosylation, as previously speculated. Staurosporine sensitivity was found to be an allele-specific phenotype restricted to cells harboring mutations in highly conserved residues in the N-terminal domain of the STT3 protein. Cells bearing mutations in one of the cytosolic-oriented loops (amino acids 158-168) in the N terminus of Stt3p were found to be specifically susceptible to staurosporine. Staurosporine is a specific inhibitor of Pkc1p, and a genetic link had previously been suggested between PKC1 and STT3. It is known that overexpression of PKC1 suppresses the staurosporine sensitivity of the stt3 mutants in an allele-specific manner, which is typical of mutants of Pkc1p cascade. It has been shown that the pkc1 null mutant exhibits lowered OT activity. Our results combined with these previous observations indicate that the N-terminal domain of Stt3p may interact with members of the Pkc1p cascade and consequently mutations in this domain result in staurosporine sensitivity. We further speculate that the Pkc1p regulates OT activity through the N-terminal domain of Stt3p, the C-terminal domain of which possesses the recognition and/or catalytic site of the OT complex.

A potential role of Pkc1p in regulation of OT activity has been previously proposed by our laboratory because novel interaction of the lumenal domain of several OT subunits with Pkc1p were identified in a two-hybrid study (18Park H.

The work described in this paper involving analysis of OT subunit mutants, besides that of several stt3 mutants suggests that staurosporine sensitivity of stt3 mutants is not a direct consequence of their glycosylation defect as previously speculated (3Zufferey R. Knauer R. Burda P. Stagljar I. te Heesen S. Lehle L. Aebi M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4949-4960Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Based on our observations and those from other laboratories, we hypothesize that the N-terminal domain of Stt3p interacts with members of the Pkc1p cascade and that mutations in this domain result in hypersensitivity to staurosporine and thereby lethality in the presence of the drug. This led us to propose that Pkc1p cascade controls N-glycosylation by regulation of Stt3p activity. Yeast Strains, Media, and Materials—Yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table I.

Luria-Bertani medium was used for bacterial growth. Standard recombinant DNA procedures were carried out as described by Sambrook et al. (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Spotting Assay—Yeast cells were grown to early log phase (A600 nm < 0.5) in either YPD or synthetic media. Equal amount of cells (3 × 106) were collected, and following serial 10-fold dilution, aliquots of 5 μl were spotted on appropriate plates. Sequencing of stt3-1 and stt3-2 Alleles—The 2.9-kb STT3 loci were amplified using genomic DNA from SYT3-1RA, SYT32-4B, and YS3-6D strains using PWO polymerase and primers 5′-ATACTCTGTTCGGAATGCGT-3′ and 5′-CTAGAGCAATGAATCGTT-3′, and ligated into pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen) by TOPO-TA cloning to generate pCR2.1-stt3-1, pCR2.1-stt3-2, and pCR2.1-STT3, respectively. Sequencing was carried out. The EcoRV-SstI insert from pCR2.1-stt3-1 and pCR2.1-stt3-2 was ligated into pRS314 digested with SmaI and SstI, so as to generate pRS314-stt3-1 and pRS314-stt3-2, respectively. Site-directed Mutagenesis—pRS314-STT3-HA was used as a template for the PCR mutagenesis, which was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Mutagenized plasmids were sequenced and those with the expected sequence were transformed into QYY700-1. The transformants were selected on SC-Trp plates and further analyzed for FOA sensitivity. Western Blot Analysis with Anti-CPY Antibody—Yeast lysate equivalent to 1.0 A600 nm was applied per lane on SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. The blot was probed with anti-CPY antibody raised in rabbit, which was used at a dilution of 1:5000 and the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody raised in goat was used to a dilution of 1:3000. Western blots were developed using the Lumiglo kit from KPL (Gaithersburg, MD). Co-immunoprecipitation—Spheroplasts were subjected to immunoprecipitation, which was carried out as described by Karaoglu et al. (26Karaoglu D. Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32513-32520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) except that the spheroplast suspension was adjusted to 1.5% digitonin, 0.5 m NaCl, 3.5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4. The solution was centrifuged for 20 min at 55,000 rpm in a TLA 100.3 rotor (Beckman, Fullerton, CA) and the supernatant fraction was incubated with anti-hemagglutinin (HA.11) monoclonal antibody followed by incubation with protein G-agarose beads. The beads were recovered by centrifugation and washed three times with the same buffer and once with 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm EDTA. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot using the appropriate antibody. Mutants of Most of the OT Subunits Are Staurosporine Resistant—To understand the basis of the staurosporine sensitivity of stt3 mutants, which is believed to be a result of a defect in N-glycosylation, we examined the staurosporine sensitivity of mutants of the 8 subunits of the oligosaccharyl transferase complex (Fig. 1). The mutants used for this study have been characterized previously (1Yoshida S. Ikeda E. Uno I. Mitsuzawa H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 231: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 12Chi J.H.

In case of OT subunits that were encoded by non-essential genes, we examined the respective deletion strains. In case of the subunits that are products of essential genes, we studied strains bearing temperature-sensitive alleles that are known to result in a severe glycosylation defect. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, only the stt3-1,stt3-2 mutants and the deletion strain of ost4 were found to be staurosporine-sensitive. It is noteworthy that even the wbp1-2 or the ost2-3 mutant strains do not exhibit staurosporine sensitivity, although these mutations exhibit a severe glycosylation defect (30Silberstein S. Collins P.G. Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 371-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 31te Heesen S. Janetzky B. Lehle L. Aebi M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2071-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Mutants of swp1 were not tested in this study because of their unavailability. The hygromycin B-sensitive phenotype is common to a large number of yeast mutants with a variety of glycosylation defects and therefore for comparison, we examined the hygromycin B sensitivity of the OT mutants (33Dean N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1287-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1C, all the OT mutants were found to be hygromycin-sensitive to varying degrees. Thus of the mutants tested above, only the deletion strain of ost4 and the stt3 mutant strains exhibited staurosporine sensitivity. Stt3p and Ost4p are known to exist in one subcomplex of OT (26Karaoglu D. Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. J. Biol.

Comparison of growth of mutants of different OT subunits on staurosporine plates. Cultures of wild-type controls and various mutants listed in Table I were diluted serially and spotted on the following plates: YPD (A), YPD + staurosporine (1 μg/ml) (B), or YPD + hygromycin B (50 μg/ml) (C). All plates were incubated at 25 °C. After 3 days the growth of colonies was compared.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Mutation in the N-terminal Domain of Stt3p Lead to Staurosporine Sensitivity—Staurosporine is an inhibitor of Pkc1p (7Nakano H.

Tomita F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 135: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (2215) Google Scholar). Because none of the OT subunit mutants exhibit staurosporine sensitivity except the stt3 mutants and the ost4 deletion strain, we examined the basis of staurosporine sensitivity of stt3 mutants. We carried out sequencing of the two mutant alleles stt3-1 and stt3-2 that were previously identified in the staurosporine sensitivity screening (1Yoshida S. Ikeda E. Uno I. Mitsuzawa H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 231: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) using the primers listed in Table II. Sequencing of the stt3-1 allele identified a point mutation at residue 163 converting Gly to Arg, and in the stt3-2 allele, two point mutations were found converting G210D and V393I. Thus both of the alleles bear mutations in the N-terminal domain of the protein (see Fig. 2). The stt3-1 mutation is known to result in a very severe growth and glycosylation defect, and a staurosporine-sensitive phenotype, which cannot be suppressed by overexpression of PKC1 (2Yoshida S. Ohya Y. Nakano A. Anraku Y. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 164: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Because the 163rd residue is predicted to be a part of a cytosol-oriented loop (aa 158-168) (SRSVAGSYDNE) between the first and the second transmembrane domain and is conserved with 100% identity among all of the known Stt3p homologs from yeast to human, we proceeded in a stepwise manner to mutate each residue in this loop (Fig. 2). We mutated all the polar residues (Ser-158, Arg-159, Ser-160, Ser-164, Tyr-165, Asp-166, Asn-167, and Glu-168) to alanine and non-polar amino acids (Val-161 and Ala-162) to arginine. All the mutant plasmids (TRP) were generated using a HA-epitope-tagged STT3 construct (pRS314-STT3-HA) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We examined if the TRP-plasmid borne mutant allele rescues the FOA sensitivity of the stt3Δ strain harboring an URA plasmid-borne STT3 WT allele. We determined if any of the mutations resulted in a growth defect followed by examining their sensitivity to staurosporine. The results of growth phenotypes of the mutants are summarized in Table III and depicted in Fig. 2. The mutant alleles R159A, S160A, or S164A behave like the stt3-1 allele and lead to a temperature- and stauroporine-sensitive phenotype (Fig. 3). Mutation of Ser-158, Val-161, Ala-162, or Tyr-165 did not result in any obvious growth defect or staurosporine sensitivity. All the remaining point mutations (D166A, N167A, or E168A) could not rescue the FOA sensitivity of the stt3Δ (Yep352-STT3) strain and resulted in a lethal phenotype. Additionally, we prepared 5 other single amino acid mutants in which a highly conserved residue in other regions of the N-terminal domain of Stt3p (Tyr-131, Trp-208, Tyr-211, Tyr-397, or Arg-404) was replaced by Ala. The point mutants (Y131A, Y211A, or Y397A) did not exhibit any growth defect or staurosporine sensitivity, whereas the other two mutations (W208A or R404A) resulted in a lethal phenotype. Of the two point mutations in the stt3-2 allele, we found that G210D but not V393I was responsible for the staurosporine and temperature sensitivity of this mutant allele (Fig. 3).Table IIPrimers used for sequencing of stt3-1 and stt3-2 mutant allelesPrimerSequenceM13 reverse5′-CAGGAAACAGCTATGAC-3′M13 forward5′-GTAAAACGACGGCCAG-3′STT3-start5′-GGGATCCGACCGGTCGTCTG-3′STT3-4635′-GGTTATATATCTAGATCAG-3′STT3-9235′-TTGGTGTGGTCGGACTTTCT-3′STT3-14035′-GGGTAACAAGAACTGCATAC-3′STT3-A5′-GGGCTTCTGAGACCATG-3′STT3-B5′-ATGGACCTTCTGGTTTTCG-3′STT3-C5′-CTAGAGCAATGAATCGTT-3′ Open table in a new tab Fig. 2Diagrammatic representation of the location of mutations and predicted topology of Stt3p. Based on the PSORTII program, Stt3p from S. cerevisiae bears a signal peptide (aa 1-30), a hydrophobic N-terminal domain (aa 31-460) bearing 11 transmembrane segments, and a hydrophilic C-terminal domain (aa 460-718) oriented toward the ER lumen. The extreme N terminus of Stt3p (aa 31-113) is believed to be oriented toward the cytosol (37Andrulis E.D. Neiman A.M. Zappulla D.C. Sternglanz R. Nature. 1998; 394: 592-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Each star indicates the residue mutated in the respective stt3 allele. The first cytosol-oriented loop comprising residues 158-168 is completely conserved, when Stt3p homologs from several species from yeast to human are aligned. This loop is indicated in the figure. Mutations leading to staurosporine sensitivity are marked in blue and those resulting in a lethal phenotype are indicated in crimson. Those point mutations having no obvious effect in terms of temperature or staurosporine sensitivity are indicated in black. The temperature-sensitive C-terminal domain mutants, which were found to be staurosporine-resistant, are indicated in green. The stt3-3 mutation that was previously identified (3Zufferey R. Knauer R.
