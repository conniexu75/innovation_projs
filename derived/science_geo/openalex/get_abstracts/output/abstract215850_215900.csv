Like other enzyme systems this one has a st,oichiometry and presumably, a reaction sequence and active sites. Knowledge of the latter feat,ures is fragmentary. Isolation of a reaction intermediate would clarify the reaction sequence and could lead to chemical characterization of an active site. Active sodium and potassium transport in the human erythro- cyte is a stoichiometric reaction in which three sodium ions move outward, two potassium ions move inward, and one terminal phosphate bond of adenosine triphosphate is hydrolyzed at the inner surface of the membrane in the presence of magnesium ion (1). It is inhibited by cardiac glycosides such as ouabain. It appears in broken membranes as an ATPase activity which is dependent upon sodium plus potassium, and is sensitive to ouabain (2, 3). This will be abbreviated as (Na+ + K+)- ATPase in this paper. There is high (Na+ + K+)-ATPase ac- tivity in membrane preparations of many excitable and secret- ing tissues, particularly, electric organ (4), brain (5), peripheral nerve (6)) salt gland (7), kidney (5), and salivary gland (8). In 1957, Glynn (9) presented a scheme of Shaw to account for the stoichiometry of sodium and potassium transport by an alter- nation of carrier forms. Metabolic energy, now known to come from ATP, would convert a potassium carrier, X, into a sodium carrier, Y, on the inner face of the membrane. After outward translocation in combination with sodium ion, Y would revert to X on the outer face and, in combination with potassium ion, return through the membrane to the initial state. The scheme is consistent with reciprocal competitive inhibitory effects be- tween sodium ion and potassium ion (10). On the basis of tracer exchange experiments with (Na+ + K+)-ATPase in crab nerve, Skou (11) proposed an enzyme-high energy phosphate inter- mediate, E - P. His scheme was"

They can be distinguished by the ability of each of them to accept only one amino acid and transfer it to protein (1). The elucidation of the structures of tRNAsl is of considerable interest in view of the highly specific nature of these reactions. It has been shown that the 3’.hydroxyl terminal sequence, the amino acid acceptor end, of all functional tRNA molecules is -pCpCpA (2, 3). The 5’-phosphate terminal was found to be predominantly pGp(4). Aside from these similarities, the structures of different tRNA molecules seem to vary significantly, as indicated by structural studies performed on bulk (I) as well as purified tRNA preparations (5). The nucleotide composition of tRNA is characterized by the presence of several minor components in addition to the four major nucleotides. The minor nucleotides include pseudouridylic acid (tip) and ribothymidylic acid (Tp), as well as other methylated derivatives of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides (6, 7). Each of the purified RNAs studied has a specific content of minor nucleotides, which occupy definite positions along the RNA chain (5). The role of the minor nucleotides in the structure and function of tRNA is still little understood. This paper presents evidence that strongly suggests that the sequence -GpTp$pCpGp-, including two minor nucleotides, is part of the structure of all tRNh molecules. This sequence gives the tetranucleotide Tp$pCpGp on digestion of the RNAs with RNase Tl. The isolation of this tetranucleotide from digests of purified alanine-, valine-, and tyrosine-tRNAs, as well as from bulk tRNA of yeast, Escherichia co& and rat liver, will be described."

The manner in which pancreatic deoxyribonuclease degrades deoxyribonucleic acid has been thoroughly analyzed both with regard to the breakdown of secondary structure and to the products formed. The activities of several other deoxyribonucleases have been characterized, especially those from Escherichia coli. A variety of specificities has been observed in which the preference seems to be most directly related to the secondary structure of the substrate and not rigorously to the internucleotide linkage."

https://openalex.org/W150382597,"Considerable evidence supports the view (1) that the primary metabolic lesion in phenylketonuria is a block in the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine due to the absence of a labile protein component of the liver hydroxylating system (2). However, the mechanism by which this metabolic defect in liver is translated into the mental retardation which clinically characterizes this disease is unclear. Several approaches to the problem have been made and the experimental model introduced by Auerbach (3) has proven particularly useful in nutritionally simulating some biochemical features of this genetic disease. More recent neurochemical and behavioral studies (4, 5) have demonstrated that animals fed diets rich in phenylalanine have diminished brain serotonin accompanied by impaired behavior in some, but not all, problem-solving tasks. A necessary connection between these two phenomena has not yet been established, although suggestive evidence has been presented from several sources. The metabolism of serotonin from tryptophan to 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid is well established and all the intermediate steps are known to occur in brain with the exception of 5.hydroxylation of tryptophan. To date, attempts to demonstrate this reaction in nervous tissue have been unsuccessful. This failure, together with the observation that 5-hydroxytryptophan easily transverses the blood-brain barrier while serotonin does not, suggests that serotonin synthesis in the central nervous system may be intimately related to peripheral disposition of tryptophan and 5-hydroxytryptophan. Based on the known observations, several explanations"
