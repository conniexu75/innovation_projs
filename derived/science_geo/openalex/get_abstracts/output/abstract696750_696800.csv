https://openalex.org/W4285085196,"In recent decades, several studies have considered the use of plastic waste as a partial substitute for aggregate in green concrete. Such concrete has been limited to non-structural applications due to its low strength. This raises whether such concrete can be enhanced for use in some structural applications. This paper reports an attempt to develop a structural-grade concrete containing plastic waste aggregate with high proportions of substitution and confined with carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) fabrics. Experimental research was conducted involving the casting and testing 54 plain and confined concrete cylinders. A concrete mixture was designed in which the fine aggregate was partially replaced by polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste plastic at ratios of 0%, 25%, and 50%, and with different w/c ratios of 0.40, 0.45, and 0.55. The results show that confinement has a substantial positive effect on the compressive behavior of PET concrete. The enhancement efficiency increases by 8-190%, with higher enhancement levels for higher substitution ratios. Adding one layer of CFRP fabric raises the ultimate strength of samples that have lost compressive strength to a level close to that of unconfined samples not containing PET. This confinement is accompanied by an increase in the slope of the stress-strain curve and greater axial and lateral strain values at failure. For the specimens confined by CFRP fabric, PET aggregate can be used as a partial substitute for sand at a replacement ratio of up to 50% by volume for structural applications. This paper also considers the ability of existing models to predict the strength of confined-PET concrete circular cross-sections by comparing model predictions with experimental results. The strength of confined PET concrete elements can't be accurately predicted by any of the models that are already out there. It's important to come up with a new model for these elements."

This study aims to identify natural compounds that could affect the fusion between the viral membrane (receptor-binding domain of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 spike protein) and the human cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. Accordingly, we performed the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based screening of 10 phytochemicals that already showed numerous positive effects on human health in several epidemiological studies and clinical trials. Among these phytochemicals, epigallocatechin gallate, a polyphenol and a major component of green tea, could effectively inhibit the interaction between the receptor-binding domain of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 spike protein and the human cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. Alternately, in silico molecular docking studies of epigallocatechin gallate and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 indicated a binding score of -7.8 kcal/mol and identified a hydrogen bond between R393 and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, which is considered as a key interacting residue involved in binding with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 spike protein receptor-binding domain, suggesting the possible blocking of interaction between receptor-binding domain and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. Furthermore, epigallocatechin gallate could attenuate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and replication in Caco-2 cells. These results shed insight into identification and validation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 entry inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W4285392838,"The Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine has offered a great promise to reduce the cervical cancer burden; its utilization (uptake) however has been lagging. However, the levels and factors associated with the uptake of the vaccine have not been well investigated, especially in the local context.To assess the uptake of human papillomavirus vaccination and its associated factors among adolescent school girls in ambo town, Oromia, Ethiopia, 2020.An institution-based cross-sectional quantitative study design supplemented with the qualitative inquiry was employed to assess Human Papillomavirus vaccination uptake and its associated factors among 422 adolescent school girls in Ambo town, central Ethiopia from December 1-30, 2020. The collected data were coded, entered, and cleaned by using Epi info 7.2.3 and exported to SPSS version 25 for analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to compute summary statistics and proportions. Both bivariate and multivariable logistic regression was employed to identify factors associated with HPV vaccine uptake. Adjusted odds ratio and 95% confidence interval were used for the strength and directions of association. A P-value of < 0.05 was used to declare statistical significance. Qualitative findings have been analyzed with manual thematic analysis.The proportion of HPV vaccination uptake among school girls in this study was 44.4%. Hearing about HPV vaccine [AOR = 2.50, 95%CI: (1.045-5.959)], availability of awareness creation [AOR = 2.53, 95%CI: (1.507-4.258)], and favorable attitude [AOR = 2.049, 95%CI: (1.153-3.64)] were the key identified factors associated with vaccination uptake. In addition, poor perception, fear of side effects, and misunderstanding were among the major factors identified by qualitative findings.There was low uptake of HPV vaccination among the school Adolescents in the study area. Availability of awareness creation programs, favorable attitude towards HPV vaccine, and hearing about HPV vaccine was significantly associated with the uptake of the HPV vaccination. Therefore, awareness creation and behavior change education are mandatory to scale up the vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W4285384944,"Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is associated with a disturbed metabolism in liver, insulin resistance, and excessive accumulation of ectopic fat. Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) may beneficially modulate hepatic lipids, however, it remains unclear whether individual BCAAs can attenuate already established NASH and associated oxidative-inflammatory stress. After a 26 weeks run-in on fast food diet (FFD), obese Ldlr−/−.Leiden mice were treated for another 12 weeks with either valine or isoleucine (3% of FFD) and then compared to FFD controls. Valine and isoleucine did not affect obesity, dyslipidemia, gut permeability, or fecal fatty acid excretion, but significantly reduced hyperinsulinemia. Valine and isoleucine reduced ALT, CK18-M30, and liver steatosis with a particularly pronounced suppression of the microvesicular component (−61% by valine and −71% by isoleucine). Both BCAAs decreased intrahepatic diacylglycerols and 4-hydroxynonenal immunoreactivity, a marker for oxidative stress-induced lipid peroxidation. Functional genomics analysis demonstrated that valine and isoleucine affected BCAA metabolism genes, deactivated master regulators of anabolic pathways related to steatosis (e.g., SREBPF1), and activated master regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis (e.g., PPARGC1A) and lipid catabolism (e.g., ACOX1, AMPK). This correction of critical metabolic pathways on gene expression level was accompanied by a significant decrease in histological liver inflammation, and suppression of FFD-stimulated cytokine and chemokine proteins KC/CXCL1, MCP-1/CCL2, and MIP-2/CXCL2 and their pathways. In conclusion, dietary intervention with either valine or isoleucine corrected liver diacylglycerols, gene expression of multiple metabolic processes, and reduced NASH histology with profound hepatoprotective effects on oxidative stress and inflammatory proteins."
https://openalex.org/W4285085337,"Emerging resistance to colistin in Acinetobacter baumannii clinical strains is concerning because of the limited therapeutic choices for these important clinical pathogens. We studied the in vitro activities of different colistin-based antimicrobial agent combinations against colistin-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii . Fourteen clinical isolates of colistin-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii were obtained between 2015 and 2016. To identify colistin-based combinations with synergistic activities, multiple two antimicrobial combinations based on 8 commercially available drugs were evaluated by the checkerboard method. The most effective colistin-based combinations were vancomycin, aztreonam, ceftazidime and imipenem which showed synergistic activities against all examined strains. Colistin-rifampin showed synergy against four strains. Colistin-tigecycline and colistin-amikacin mostly showed indifferent results. By using the checkerboard tests, we were able to find the most promising colistin-based combinations that may provide more therapeutic options against colistin-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii ."
https://openalex.org/W4285391646,"The present study deals with new material of carnivorans (Mustelidae, Mephitidae, Ailuridae, Potamotheriinae and Viverridae) from the basal Tortonian (Late Miocene, late Astaracian) hominid-bearing locality of Hammerschmiede (Bavaria, Germany). The small carnivoran fauna includes 20 species belonging to nine different subfamilies (Guloninae, Lutrinae, Mellivorinae, Potamotheriinae, Leptarctinae, Mephitinae, Simocyoninae, Genettinae and Viverrinae). The identified forms include: ""Martes"" sansaniensis, ""Martes"" cf. munki, ""Martes"" sp., Circamustela hartmanni n. sp., Laphyctis mustelinus, Guloninae indet., Eomellivora moralesi, Vishnuonyx neptuni, Paralutra jaegeri, Lartetictis cf. dubia, Trocharion albanense, Palaeomeles pachecoi, Proputorius sansaniensis, Proputorius pusillus, Alopecocyon goeriachensis, Simocyoninae indet., Potamotherium sp., Semigenetta sansaniensis, Semigenetta grandis and Viverrictis modica. The new species Circamustela hartmanni n. sp. is differentiated from the other members of the genus by its small size and the morphology of its dental cusps in the upper and lower carnassials. This is one of the highest reported taxonomic diversities for fossil small carnivorans in the Miocene of Europe, including also first and last occurrences for several genera and species. Additionally, the assemblage comprises some rare taxa such as Palaeomeles pachecoi and Eomellivora moralesi. An ecomorphological comparison of the discovered taxa reveals possible cases of competition and niche partitioning."
https://openalex.org/W4285084926,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder with high incidence. Recently it has been implicated as a significant risk factor for endometrial cancer (EC). Our study aims to detect shared gene signatures and biological mechanism between PCOS and EC by bioinformatics analysis.Bioinformatics analysis based on GEO database consisted of data integration, network construction and functional enrichment analysis was applied. In addition, the pharmacological methodology and molecular docking was also performed.Totally 10 hub common genes, MRPL16, MRPL22, MRPS11, RPL26L1, ESR1, JUN, UBE2I, MRPL17, RPL37A, GTF2H3, were considered as shared gene signatures for EC and PCOS. The GO and KEGG pathway analysis of these hub genes showed that ""mitochondrial translational elongation"", ""ribosomal subunit"", ""structural constituent of ribosome"" and ""ribosome"" were highly correlated. Besides, associated transcription factors (TFs) and miRNAs network were constructed. We identified candidate drug molecules including fenofibrate, cinnarizine, propanil, fenthion, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, demeclocycline, hydrochloride, azacitidine, chrysene and artenimol according to these hub genes. Molecular docking analysis verified a good binding interaction of fenofibrate against available targets (JUN, ESR1, UBE2I).Gene signatures and regulatory biological pathways were identified through bioinformatics analysis. Moreover, the molecular mechanisms of these signatures were explored and potential drug molecules associated with PCOS and EC were screened out."
https://openalex.org/W4285085838,"At our university based high throughput screening program, we test all members of our community weekly using RT-qPCR. RT-qPCR cycle threshold (C T ) values are inversely proportional to the amount of viral RNA in a sample and are a proxy for viral load. We hypothesized that C T values would be higher, and thus the viral loads at the time of diagnosis would be lower, in individuals who were infected with the virus but remained asymptomatic throughout the course of the infection. We collected the N1 and N2 target gene C T values from 1633 SARS-CoV-2 positive RT-qPCR tests of individuals sampled between August 7, 2020, and March 18, 2021, at the BU Clinical Testing Laboratory. We matched this data with symptom reporting data from our clinical team. We found that asymptomatic patients had C T values significantly higher than symptomatic individuals on the day of diagnosis. Symptoms were followed by the clinical team for 10 days post the first positive test. Within the entire population, 78.1% experienced at least one symptom during surveillance by the clinical team (n = 1276/1633). Of those experiencing symptoms, the most common symptoms were nasal congestion (73%, n = 932/1276), cough (60.0%, n = 761/1276), fatigue (59.0%, n = 753/1276), and sore throat (53.1%, n = 678/1276). The least common symptoms were diarrhea (12.5%, n = 160/1276), dyspnea on exertion (DOE) (6.9%, n = 88/1276), foot or skin changes (including rash) (4.2%, n = 53/1276), and vomiting (2.1%, n = 27/1276). Presymptomatic individuals, those who were not symptomatic on the day of diagnosis but became symptomatic over the following 10 days, had C T values higher for both N1 (median = 27.1, IQR 20.2–32.9) and N2 (median = 26.6, IQR 20.1–32.8) than the symptomatic group N1 (median = 21.8, IQR 17.2–29.4) and N2 (median = 21.4, IQR 17.3–28.9) but lower than the asymptomatic group N1 (median = 29.9, IQR 23.6–35.5) and N2 (median = 30.0, IQR 23.1–35.7). This study supports the hypothesis that viral load in the anterior nares on the day of diagnosis is a measure of disease intensity at that time."
https://openalex.org/W4285086457,"In science, certain theories led to a paradigm shift in human being’s approach to explain nature, such as the theory of relativity, the quantum theory, and the theory of evolution. The latter explains the emergence of biodiversity on Earth and all living beings’ relatedness, including humans. Accordingly, evolutionary theory is a central part of scientific literacy. However, scholars have demonstrated that misconceptions emerging in childhood hinder learners from grasping evolutionary processes. Implementing evolution in early science education could enhance scientific ideas as a basis for subsequent learning at school. Currently, children’s literature that deals with evolution is increasing and may enable more children to encounter evolutionary theory before entering school. This explorative study aimed to analyze how children’s books about evolution approach explaining this complex topic to young children in terms of covered contents, underlying concepts and use of language. We conducted (1) a text-based qualitative content analysis of 31 children’s books in the categories of organismal context, evolutionary principles, and misconceptions, and (2) a computer-supported content analysis of 33 word labels concerning (a) scientific terms and (b) verbs expressing evolutionary change. Although evolution is a universal concept, children’s books seem to promote specific contexts such as animal and human evolution. Even though the principle of selection requires an understanding of complex interactions between individuals and environmental factors, this principle was more frequent than the principles variation and inheritance. Phylogenetic history was covered more often than basic evolutionary processes, and evolutionary change was mainly mentioned at the species level over long periods. Besides, most books conveyed misconceptions such as transformationist, teleological or anthropomorphic reasoning. Consequently, books covering evolution may bias children’s first ideas concerning this topic or introduce unscientific ideas. Based on our results, we propose implications for early evolution educators and education researchers."
https://openalex.org/W4285394131,"The mlaA gene encodes a lipoprotein to maintain an outer membrane lipid asymmetry in gram-negative bacteria. Although the role of mlaA in bacterial virulence has been studied in several bacterial species, there are no reports of its role in E. coli virulence. In this study, we found that knockout of mlaA in E. coli increased its virulence against silkworms. The mlaA-knockout mutant was sensitive to several antibiotics and detergents, but resistant to vancomycin and chlorhexidine. The mlaA-knockout mutant grew faster than the parent strain in the presence of silkworm hemolymph. The mlaA-knockout mutant also produced a larger amount of outer membrane vesicles than the parent strain. These findings suggest that mlaA knockout causes E. coli resistance to specific antimicrobial substances and increases outer membrane vesicle production, thereby enhancing E. coli virulence properties in the silkworm infection model."
https://openalex.org/W4285083705,"Clinical data point toward gender-based differences in COVID-19 severity. However, there is insufficient research examining whether gender predicts physical activity (PA) and fatigue severity in patients recovering from COVID-19. Therefore, this study aimed to characterize the PA and fatigue severity in a cohort of patients recovering from COVID-19 infection and measure the extent to which gender-based differences moderate the relationship of PA with fatigue.A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The sample comprised patients recovering from COVID-19 over at least 3 months. Recovered patients were stratified into two groups based on gender. The survey included items pertaining to sociodemographic, a fatigue severity scale and a self-reported international PA questionnaire.Eighty-seven patients (44 women and 43 men) met the inclusion criteria. Compared with men, women reported sedentary behavior (70%) and high fatigue severity (64%). A significantly higher number of women had a low PA score compared with men (p = .002). The findings indicated that gender significantly moderates the effect of total PA in metabolic equivalents (METs; min/wk) on fatigue severity [F = 4.8, p = .03, ΔR2 = 0.24].The current study suggests that women might be at risk of higher fatigue severity, in addition to engaging less in PA. Physical activity may plays a significant role in modulate the fatigue severity. Consequently, interventions aimed at promoting physical activity in women stand high chances of addressing the disparity in the distribution of prevalence of fatigue between men and women."
https://openalex.org/W4285085018,"Pressing the fingertips into surfaces causes skin deformations that enable humans to grip objects and sense their physical properties. This process involves intricate finger geometry, non-uniform tissue properties, and moisture, complicating the underlying contact mechanics. Here we explore the initial contact evolution of dry and hydrated fingers to isolate the roles of governing physical factors. Two participants gradually pressed an index finger on a glass surface under three moisture conditions: dry, water-hydrated, and glycerin-hydrated. Gross and real contact area were optically measured over time, revealing that glycerin hydration produced strikingly higher real contact area, while gross contact area was similar for all conditions. To elucidate the causes for this phenomenon, we investigated the combined effects of tissue elasticity, skin-surface friction, and fingerprint ridges on contact area using simulation. Our analyses show the dominant influence of elastic modulus over friction and an unusual contact phenomenon, which we call friction-induced hinging."
https://openalex.org/W4285086118,"U.S. Commuting Zones (CZs) are an aggregation of county-level data that researchers commonly use to create less arbitrary spatial entities and to reduce spatial autocorrelation. However, by further aggregating data, researchers lose point data and the associated detail. Thus, the choice between using counties or CZs often remains subjective with insufficient empirical evidence guiding researchers in the choice. This article categorizes regional data as entrepreneurial, economic, social, demographic, or industrial and tests for the existence of local spatial autocorrelation in county and CZ data. We find CZs often reduce-but do not eliminate and can even increase-spatial autocorrelation for variables across categories. We then test the potential for regional variation in spatial autocorrelation with a series of maps and find variation based on the variable of interest. We conclude that the use of CZs does not eliminate the need to test for spatial autocorrection, but CZs may be useful for reducing spatial autocorrelation in many cases."
https://openalex.org/W4285086450,"Declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), COVID-19 has spread rapidly around the globe. With eventually substantial global underestimation of infection, by the end of March 2022, more than 470 million cases were confirmed, counting more than 6.1 million deaths worldwide. COVID-19 symptoms range from mild (or no) symptoms to severe illness, with disease severity and death occurring according to a hierarchy of risks, with age and pre-existing health conditions enhancing risks of disease severity. In order to understand the dynamics of disease severity during the initial phase of the pandemic, we propose a modeling framework stratifying the studied population into two groups, older and younger, assuming different risks for severe disease manifestation. The deterministic and the stochastic models are parametrized using epidemiological data for the Basque Country population referring to confirmed cases, hospitalizations and deaths, from February to the end of March 2020. Using similar parameter values, both models were able to describe well the existing data. A detailed sensitivity analysis was performed to identify the key parameters influencing the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in the population. We observed that the population younger than 60 years old of age would contribute more to the overall force of infection than the older population, as opposed to the already existing age-structured models, opening new ways to understand the effect of population age on disease severity during the COVID-19 pandemic. With mild/asymptomatic cases significantly influencing the disease spreading and control, our findings support the vaccination strategy prioritising the most vulnerable individuals to reduce hospitalization and deaths, as well as the non-pharmaceutical intervention measures to reduce disease transmission."
https://openalex.org/W4285087389,"Accurate and sufficient water quality data is essential for watershed management and sustainability. Machine learning models have shown great potentials for estimating water quality with the development of online sensors. However, accurate estimation is challenging because of uncertainties related to models used and data input. In this study, random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and back-propagation neural network (BPNN) models are developed with three sampling frequency datasets (i.e., 4-hourly, daily, and weekly) and five conventional indicators (i.e., water temperature (WT), hydrogen ion concentration (pH), electrical conductivity (EC), dissolved oxygen (DO), and turbidity (TUR)) as surrogates to individually estimate riverine total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), and ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N) in a small-scale coastal watershed. The results show that the RF model outperforms the SVM and BPNN machine learning models in terms of estimative performance, which explains much of the variation in TP (79 ± 1.3%), TN (84 ± 0.9%), and NH4+-N (75 ± 1.3%), when using the 4-hourly sampling frequency dataset. The higher sampling frequency would help the RF obtain a significantly better performance for the three nutrient estimation measures (4-hourly > daily > weekly) for R2 and NSE values. WT, EC, and TUR were the three key input indicators for nutrient estimations in RF. Our study highlights the importance of high-frequency data as input to machine learning model development. The RF model is shown to be viable for riverine nutrient estimation in small-scale watersheds of important local water security."

https://openalex.org/W4285391557,"The fear of COVID-19 has become a social problem during the pandemic. The present study compares the fear of COVID-19 among members of the general public, college students, pregnant women, and hospital nurses. It also examines various factors associated with the fear of COVID-19. In this study, we conducted a survey of the general public on fear of infection and related factors and compared from previous studies of college students, pregnant women, and hospital nurses. A crowdsourced survey was administered to 450 members of the general public, who were asked about their fear of COVID-19 infection. Data from college students, nurses, and pregnant women were recruited from a May-June 2020 survey on fear of COVID-19. An analysis of variance was used to compare the fear of infection among different attribution. The results showed that more pregnant women and fewer college students feared infection, as did equal numbers of hospital nurses and members of the general public. The multiple regression analysis revealed that college students and pregnant women associated the fear of infection with their key source of information, while hospital nurses associated the fear of infection with living with an older person. These results suggest that pregnant women have a significant fear of infection, which is further defined by the risk of serious illness in cases of infection. Although the fear of infection is relatively low among hospital nurses, they fear becoming a source of infection. These results reveal the groups in Japan that fear infection and the reasons for their concern. The present study may help to provide psychological support to counteract the fear of infection in vulnerable groups."
https://openalex.org/W4285394875,"Animals use odors in many natural contexts, for example, for finding mates or food, or signaling danger. Most analyses of natural odors search for either the most meaningful components of a natural odor mixture, or they use linear metrics to analyze the mixture compositions. However, we have recently shown that the physical space for complex mixtures is 'hyperbolic', meaning that there are certain combinations of variables that have a disproportionately large impact on perception and that these variables have specific interpretations in terms of metabolic processes taking place inside the flower and fruit that produce the odors. Here we show that the statistics of odorants and odorant mixtures produced by inflorescences (Brassica rapa) are also better described with a hyperbolic rather than a linear metric, and that combinations of odorants in the hyperbolic space are better predictors of the nectar and pollen resources sought by bee pollinators than the standard Euclidian combinations. We also show that honey bee and bumble bee antennae can detect most components of the B. rapa odor space that we tested, and the strength of responses correlates with positions of odorants in the hyperbolic space. In sum, a hyperbolic representation can be used to guide investigation of how information is represented at different levels of processing in the CNS."
https://openalex.org/W4285084983,"Background The increasing number of aerobiological stations empower comparative studies to determine the relationship between pollen concentrations in different localities and the appropriate distance, which should be established between sampling stations. In Qatar, this is basically the first aerobiological study for a continuous monitoring interval. Objectives The study aimed to assess the abundance and seasonality of the most prevalent pollen types, plus identify potential differences between two sites within the country. Methods Airborne pollen data were collected during 2017–2020 by using Hirst-type volumetric samplers in Doha capital city and Al Khor city in Qatar, placed 50 km apart. Results Higher total pollen indexes were recorded in the Al Khor station (2931 pollen * day/m 3 ) compared to the Doha station (1618 pollen * day/m 3 ). Comparing the pollen spectrum between the sampling stations revealed that ten pollen types were found in common. Amaranthaceae and Poaceae airborne pollen constituted 73.5% and 70.9% of the total amount of pollen detected at the samplers of Al Khor station and Doha station. In both sampling sites, a very pronounced seasonality was shown; August–October appeared as the period with the most intense incidence of atmospheric herbaceous pollen, with 71% and 51% of the annual total counts in Al Khor and Doha stations, respectively. August (Al Khor, 21%; Doha, 9%), September (Al Khor, 33%; Doha, 26%), October (Al Khor, 17%; Doha, 16%) were the months in which the herbs pollen concentrations were highest. Significant statistical differences between the two stations were observed in specific pollen types with local distribution in each trap’s vicinity. Conclusions Comparison of data obtained by the two samplers running at a distance of 50 Km indicated that potential inter-site differences could be attributed to the vegetation surrounding the city having a decisive influence on data collected."
https://openalex.org/W4285086163,"Despite the significant mental health challenges the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated government measures have presented, research has shown that the majority of people have adapted and coped well. The aim of this study was i) to determine the proportion of people with mental stability and volatility during the pandemic in a North West England city region sample and ii) to establish group differences in psychosocial variables. Mental stability and volatility refer to the extent to which individuals reported change in levels of common mental health symptoms over the course of 12 weeks. No change in mental health over the 12 weeks reflected mental stability whilst change in mental health reflected mental volatility.A two-wave-online survey (N = 163) was used to explore the psychological and social impact of the pandemic on relatively disadvantaged neighbourhoods within the region. The data collected represents 12 weeks of individual pandemic experience between mid-June and mid-December 2020. A three-level composite common mental health change variable was created combining self-reported anxiety and depression to group stable, volatile, and very volatile individuals in terms of the changeability of their mental health. Kruskal-Wallis with post-hoc tests were used to determine how people with mental stability and volatility differed on factors categorised within an ecological framework of resilience (individual, community, societal, and COVID-19 specific).Individuals categorised as 'stable' in terms of mental health symptoms (63.6%) had better mental and physical health; were more tolerant of uncertainty; and reported higher levels of resilience and wellbeing compared to 'very volatile' people (19.8%). These individuals also reported feeling less socially isolated, experienced a greater sense of belonging to their community which was more likely to fulfil their needs, and were more likely to have access to green space nearby for their recommended daily exercise. 'Stable' individuals did not report worrying any more during the pandemic than usual and tolerated uncertainty better compared to those in the 'volatile' group.The majority of participants in this sample were mentally stable and coping well with the challenges presented by the pandemic. The resilience of these individuals was related to key place-based factors such as a strong sense of community and useable local assets. The data showcase the role of place-based social determinants in supporting resilience and thereby highlight key preventative measures for public mental health during times of international crisis."
https://openalex.org/W4285086331,"Next generation sequencing has become essential for pathogen characterization and typing. The most popular second generation sequencing technique produces data of high quality with very low error rates and high depths. One major drawback of this technique is the short reads. Indeed, short-read sequencing data of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) are difficult to assemble because of the presence of numerous mobile genetic elements (MGEs), which contain repeated elements. The resulting draft assemblies are often highly fragmented, which results in a loss of information, especially concerning MGEs or large structural variations. The use of long-read sequencing can circumvent these problems and produce complete or nearly complete genomes. The ONT MinION, for its small size and minimal investment requirements, is particularly popular. The ultra-long reads generated with the MinION can easily span prophages and repeat regions. In order to take full advantage of this technology it requires High Molecular Weight (HMW) DNA of high quality in high quantity. In this study, we have tested three different extraction methods: bead-based, solid-phase and salting-out, and evaluated their impact on STEC DNA yield, quality and integrity as well as performance in MinION long-read sequencing. Both the bead-based and salting-out methods allowed the recovery of large quantities of HMW STEC DNA suitable for MinION library preparation. The DNA extracted using the salting-out method consistently produced longer reads in the subsequent MinION runs, compared with the bead-based methods. While both methods performed similarly in subsequent STEC genome assembly, DNA extraction based on salting-out appeared to be the overall best method to produce high quantity of pure HMW STEC DNA for MinION sequencing."
https://openalex.org/W4285087350,"Purpose Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a significant independent risk factor for 1-year mortality in patients with first acute ischemic stroke (AIS). The CHA2DS2-VASc score was initially developed to assess the risk of stroke in patients with AF. Recently, this scoring system has been demonstrated to have clinical value for predicting long-term clinical outcomes in AIS but the evidence is insufficient. This large-scale prospective cohort study investigated the independent predictive value of the score in such patients. Methods We included patients with AIS from the Taiwan Stroke Registry (TSR) during 2006–2016 as the present study population. Patients were divided into those with high (≥2) and low (&lt;2) CHA2DS2-VASc scores. We further analyzed and classified patients according to the presence of AF. The clinical endpoint was major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs) at 1 year after the index AIS. Results A total of 62,227 patients with AIS were enrolled. The median age was 70.3 years, and 59% of the patients were women. After confounding factors were controlled, patients with high CHA2DS2-VASc scores had significantly higher incidence of 1-year MACCEs (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 1.63; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.52, 1.76), re-stroke (adjusted HR = 1.28; 95% CI = 1.16, 1.42), and all-cause mortality (adjusted HR = 2.03; 95% CI = 1.83, 2.24) than those with low CHA2DS2-VASc scores did. In the comparison between AF and non-AF groups, the AF group had increased MACCEs (adjusted HR = 1.74; 95% CI = 1.60, 1.89), myocardial infarction (adjusted HR = 4.86; 95% CI = 2.07, 11.4), re-stroke (adjusted HR = 1.47; 95% CI = 1.26, 1.71), and all-cause mortality (adjusted HR = 1.90; 95% CI = 1.72, 2.10). The Kaplan–Meier curve revealed that both CHA2DS2-VASc scores and AF were independent risk predictors for 1-year MACCEs and mortality. Conclusions The CHA2DS2-VASc score and AF appeared to consistently predict 1-year MACCEs of AIS patients and provide more accurate risk stratification. Therefore, increased use of the CHA2DS2-VASc score may help improve the holistic clinical assessment of AIS patients with or without AF."
https://openalex.org/W4285087547,"Yersiniosis is the third most reported food-borne zoonosis in Europe. The aim of the present study was to perform the search for Yersinia enterocolitica in food samples collected from Apulia and Basilicata regions (Southern Italy) and to characterize any isolates by classical and modern analytical methods. A total of 130 samples were analyzed between July 2018 and July 2019: most of them were raw milk and dairy products made from it. Furthermore, 8 out of 130 samples were individual milk samples collected from bovines reared in a Brucella -free farm which showed false positive serological reaction for brucellosis due to the presence of pathogenic Y . enterocolitica O:9 biotype 2 in faeces. The Real Time PCR targeting the ail gene and the culture method were performed to detect pathogenic Y . enterocolitica . Isolates were subjected to API 20E (Biomerieux) and MALDI-TOF MS (Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-Flight) for species identification. All samples were negative for the ail gene. The culture method allowed to isolate suspicious colonies from 28 samples. The API 20E system and the MALDI-TOF MS technique identified 20 Y . enterocolitica and 1 Y . intermedia in a concordant way. The remaining 7 strains were all identified as Y . enterocolitica by the API 20E system, while the MALDI-TOF MS recognized 4 Y . intermedia , 1 Y . bercovieri and 2 Y . massiliensis . Genotypic characterization of the discordant strains was performed by rMLST and it confirmed the MALDI-TOF MS’ results. Only non-pathogenic Y . enterocolitica biotype 1A strains were found, although with a non-negligible prevalence (P = 0.15 with CI 95% = ± 0.06). This study indicates a poor circulation of pathogenic Y . enterocolitica in food products made and marketed in the investigated areas. However, the small number of samples, insufficient for some food categories such as meat and vegetable, does not allow to exclude the presence of pathogenic strains at all."
https://openalex.org/W4285393419,"Field hockey is a high-intensity intermittent team sport that has recently undergone a series of rule changes that have resulted in a greater demand for repeated high-intensity movements. Coaches and practitioners now require a reliable assessment of repeated accelerations, decelerations and changes of direction to assess these important match qualities. This investigation assessed the test-retest reliability of a novel 6x40m repeated shuttle sprint test (20m + 20m with a 180° turn) and its association with 40m straight line sprint and YoYo Intermittent Recovery Test performance in 28 International field hockey players (n = 14 females and n = 14 males). The sum of 6 sprint times (SUM) demonstrated 'excellent' (ICC = 0.94 and CV = 0.59%) and 'good' (ICC = 0.84 and CV = 0.75%) reliability in females and males, respectively. Best sprint time during the repeated shuttle sprint test also demonstrated suitable reliability to evaluate field hockey physical performance (ICC = 0.92 & 0.76, CV = 0.76% & 1.00% in females and males, respectively). SUM was significantly associated with 40 m straight line sprint performance in females (r = 0.90; p<0.001) and males (r = 0.92; p<0.001), but only a weak association was found with YoYo Intermittent Recovery Test performance for either group (r = 0.20; p = 0.495 & r = -0.19; p = 0.525 in females and males, respectively). In summary, field hockey testing batteries that include a repeated shuttle sprint test should consider including a test of intermittent endurance. Further, changes in SUM greater than 1.0% can be confidently interpreted by coaches and practitioners as a real change for both female and male elite field hockey players."
https://openalex.org/W4285084283,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that play important roles in the genetic heritability of traits and diseases. With most of these SNPs located on the non-coding part of the genome, it is currently assumed that these SNPs influence the expression of nearby genes on the genome. However, identifying which genes are targeted by these disease-associated SNPs remains challenging. In the past, protein knowledge graphs have often been used to identify genes that are associated with disease, also referred to as ""disease genes"". Here, we explore whether protein knowledge graphs can be used to identify genes that are targeted by disease-associated non-coding SNPs by testing and comparing the performance of six existing methods for a protein knowledge graph, four of which were developed for disease gene identification. We compare our performance against two baselines: (1) an existing state-of-the-art method that is based on guilt-by-association, and (2) the leading assumption that SNPs target the nearest gene on the genome. We test these methods with four reference sets, three of which were obtained by different means. Furthermore, we combine methods to investigate whether their combination improves performance. We find that protein knowledge graphs that include predicate information perform comparable to the current state of the art, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 79.6% on average across all four reference sets. Protein knowledge graphs that lack predicate information perform comparable to our other baseline (genetic distance) which achieved an AUC of 75.7% across all four reference sets. Combining multiple methods improved performance to 84.9% AUC. We conclude that methods for a protein knowledge graph can be used to identify which genes are targeted by disease-associated non-coding SNPs."
https://openalex.org/W4285084476,"With the development of information technology, improving the efficiency of public services with the help of the Internet has become an important work of local governments. However, under different institutional environments, the impact mechanism of Internet development on the supply efficiency of government public services is still unclear. Based on China's interprovincial panel data from 2011 to 2019, this paper constructs a threshold effect model, sets the institutional environment as the threshold variable, and empirically analyzes the impact of Internet development on the supply efficiency of government public services. The results show that the difference in regional institutional environment will lead to the obvious threshold effect of Internet development on the supply efficiency of government public services: When the institutional environment is poor, the role of Internet development on the supply efficiency of government public services is not significant. With the improvement of the institutional environment, the role of Internet development in promoting the supply efficiency of government public services gradually appears, but the marginal intensity of promotion weakens. Compared with existing studies that mostly use linear models, this paper incorporates the institutional environment into the complex relationship between Internet development and government public service supply efficiency, and clarifies the role of the institutional environment in the process of Internet development affecting government public service supply efficiency and the non-linear relationship among the three. This paper reveals the mechanism of Internet development affecting the supply efficiency of government public services under different institutional environments and provides a new perspective for solving the shortage of public services."
https://openalex.org/W4285084612,"Background Fear of spiders, or Arachnophobia, is one of the most common specific phobias. The gold standard treatment, in vivo exposure therapy, is effective, but comes with significant limitations, including restricted availability, high costs, and high refusal rates. Novel technologies, such as augmented reality, may help to overcome these limitations and make Exposure Therapy more accessible by using mobile devices. Objective This study will use a Randomized Controlled Trial design to investigate whether ZeroPhobia: Arachnophobia, a 6-week Augmented Reality Exposure Therapy smartphone self-help application, can effectively reduce spider phobia symptoms. Additionally, we will examine user-friendliness of the application and the effect of usage intensity and presence on treatment outcome. Methods This study is registered in the Netherlands Trial Registry under NL70238.029.19 (Trial NL9221). Ethical approval was received on October 11, 2019. One-hundred-twelve participants (age 18–64, score ≥ 59) on the Fear of Spiders Questionnaire [FSQ] will be recruited from the general Dutch population and randomly assigned to a treatment or waitlist control group. The ZeroPhobia application can be accessed on users’ smartphone. Baseline, post-test (i.e., at six weeks), 3- and 12-month follow-up assessments will be done, each including the Fear of Spiders Questionnaire as the main outcome measure as well as additional measures of anxiety, depression, user-friendliness, and presence as secondary measures and covariates. Results The study was funded on September 25, 2018. Data collection started in September 2021 and the study is expected to run until September 2022. Conclusions Our study will improve our understanding of the efficacy and feasibility of providing Exposure Therapy for spider phobia using an Augmented Reality self-help application, with the intention of making mental health care more accessible."
https://openalex.org/W4285085174,"An increase in telomere shortening in gestational tissues has been proposed as a mechanism involved in the timing for the initiation of parturition. An increase in very short telomeres with increasing gestational age has been observed in mice; this study sought to explore this phenomenon in human pregnancies. Specifically, this study addressed the hypothesis that prior to labor, the quantity of very short telomeres (<3 kilobase (kb) lengths) increases in human placental tissue as term gestation approaches. The primary outcome was the quantity of very short telomeres present in placental tissue. Quantitative measurements of very short telomeres were performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) adaptation of the telomere restriction fragment technique. Placental tissue from 69 pregnant individuals were included. Mean gestational age was 39.1 weeks (term) and 36.2 weeks (preterm). For term versus preterm placentas, the observed increase in very short telomeres were as follows: 500 bp telomeres increased by 1.67-fold (p < 0.03); 1 kb telomeres increased 1.67-fold (p < 0.08); and 3 kb telomeres increased 5.20-fold (p < 0.001). This study confirms a significant increase in very short telomeres in human placental tissue at term; thereby supporting the hypothesis that telomere shortening at term contributes to the mechanism that determine the length of pregnancy thereby leading to onset of parturition."
https://openalex.org/W4285086151,"Hippocampal subfield atrophy is a prime structural change in the brain, associated with cognitive aging and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Recent developments in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified genetic loci that characterize the risk of hippocampal volume loss based on the processes of normal and abnormal aging. Polygenic risk scores are the genetic proxies mimicking the genetic role of the pre-existing vulnerabilities of the underlying mechanisms influencing these changes. Discriminating the genetic predispositions of hippocampal subfield atrophy between cognitive aging and neurodegenerative diseases will be helpful in understanding the disease etiology. In this study, we evaluated the polygenic risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD PGRS) for hippocampal subfield atrophy in 1,086 individuals (319 cognitively normal (CN), 591 mild cognitively impaired (MCI), and 176 Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD)). Our results showed a stronger association of AD PGRS effect on the left hemisphere than on the right hemisphere for all the hippocampal subfield volumes in a mixed clinical population (CN+MCI+ADD). The subfields CA1, CA4, hippocampal tail, subiculum, presubiculum, molecular layer, GC-ML-DG, and HATA showed stronger AD PGRS associations with the MCI+ADD group than with the CN group. The subfields CA3, parasubiculum, and fimbria showed moderately higher AD PGRS associations with the MCI+ADD group than with the CN group. Our findings suggest that the eight subfield regions, which were strongly associated with AD PGRS are likely involved in the early stage ADD and a specific focus on the left hemisphere could enhance the early prediction of ADD."
https://openalex.org/W4285086701,"To assess a species' impact on its environment-and the environment's impact upon a species-we need to pinpoint its links to surrounding taxa. The honeybee (Apis mellifera) provides a promising model system for such an exercise. While pollination is an important ecosystem service, recent studies suggest that honeybees can also provide disservices. Developing a comprehensive understanding of the full suite of services and disservices that honeybees provide is a key priority for such a ubiquitous species. In this perspective paper, we propose that the DNA contents of honey can be used to establish the honeybee's functional niche, as reflected by ecosystem services and disservices. Drawing upon previously published genomic data, we analysed the DNA found within 43 honey samples from Northern Europe. Based on metagenomic analysis, we find that the taxonomic composition of DNA is dominated by a low pathogenicity bee virus with 40.2% of the reads, followed by bacteria (16.7%), plants (9.4%) and only 1.1% from fungi. In terms of ecological roles of taxa associated with the bees or taxa in their environment, bee gut microbes dominate the honey DNA, with plants as the second most abundant group. A range of pathogens associated with plants, bees and other animals occur frequently, but with lower relative read abundance, across the samples. The associations found here reflect a versatile the honeybee's role in the North-European ecosystem. Feeding on nectar and pollen, the honeybee interacts with plants-in particular with cultivated crops. In doing so, the honeybee appears to disperse common pathogens of plants, pollinators and other animals, but also microbes potentially protective of these pathogens. Thus, honey-borne DNA helps us define the honeybee's functional niche, offering directions to expound the benefits and drawbacks of the associations to the honeybee itself and its interacting organisms."
https://openalex.org/W4285087129,"Background The diabetes mellitus prevalence is rapidly increasing in most parts of the world and has become a vital health problem. Probiotic and herbal foods are valuable in the treatment of diabetes. Methods and performance In this study, Bacillus licheniformis (BL) and Astragalus membranaceus extract (AE) were given with food to InR [E19] /TM2 Drosophila melanogaster , and the blood glucose, antioxidation activity and intestinal microbiota were investigated. The obtained results showed that BA (BL and AE combination) supplementation markedly decreased the blood glucose concentration compared with the standard diet control group, accompanied by significantly increased enzymatic activities of catalase (CAT), decreased MDA levels and prolonged lifespan of InR [E19] /TM2 D . melanogaster . The treatments with BL, AE and BA also ameliorated intestinal microbiota equilibrium by increasing the population of Lactobacillus and significantly decreasing the abundance of Wolbachia . In addition, clearly different evolutionary clusters were found among the control, BL, AE and BA-supplemented diets, and the beneficial microbiota, Lactobacillaceae and Acetobacter , were found to be significantly increased in male flies that were fed BA. These results indicated that dietary supplementation with AE combined with BL not only decreased blood glucose but also extended the lifespan, with CAT increasing, MDA decreasing, and intestinal microbiota improving in InR [E19] /TM2 D . melanogaster . Conclusion The obtained results showed that dietary supplementation with BL and AE, under the synergistic effect of BL and AE, not only prolonged the lifespan of InR [E19] /TM2 D . melanogaster , increased body weight, and improved the body’s antiaging enzyme activity but also effectively improved the types and quantities of beneficial bacteria in the intestinal flora of InR [E19] /TM2 D . melanogaster to improve the characteristics of diabetes symptoms. This study provides scientific evidence for a safe and effective dietary therapeutic method for diabetes mellitus."

It is one of the potentially preventable cancers, and an effective screening program can result in a significant reduction in the morbidity and mortality associated with this cancer; however, evidence showed that only a small percentage of the women were screened. As a result, predictors of cervical cancer screening usage among women in Ambo town, central Ethiopia, were identified in this study.Unmatched, a community-based case-control study was conducted among 195 randomly sampled women in the age group of 30-49 years in Ambo town from February 1 to March 30, 2020. Data was collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Descriptive, bivariate, and multivariable binary logistic regression analysis was done using SPSS.A total of 195 study participants, sixty-five cases and one hundred thirty controls, participated in this study, making a response rate of 100%.

https://openalex.org/W4285392104,"Different levels of arterial occlusive disease (aortoiliac, femoropopliteal, multi-level disease) can produce claudication symptoms in different leg muscle groups (buttocks, thighs, calves) in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD). We tested the hypothesis that different locations of occlusive disease uniquely affect the muscles of PAD legs and produce distinctive patterns in the way claudicating patients walk. Ninety-seven PAD patients and 35 healthy controls were recruited. PAD patients were categorized to aortoiliac, femoropopliteal and multi-level disease groups using computerized tomographic angiography. Subjects performed walking trials both pain-free and during claudication pain and joint kinematics, kinetics, and spatiotemporal parameters were calculated to evaluate the net contribution of the calf, thigh and buttock muscles. PAD patients with occlusive disease affecting different segments of the arterial tree (aortoiliac, femoropopliteal, multi-level disease) presented with symptoms affecting different muscle groups of the lower extremity (calves, thighs and buttocks alone or in combination). However, no significant biomechanical differences were found between PAD groups during the pain-free conditions with minimal differences between PAD groups in the claudicating state. All statistical differences in the pain-free condition occurred between healthy controls and one or more PAD groups. A discriminant analysis function was able to adequately predict if a subject was a control with over 70% accuracy, but the function was unable to differentiate between PAD groups. In-depth gait analyses of claudicating PAD patients indicate that different locations of arterial disease produce claudication symptoms that affect different muscle groups across the lower extremity but impact the function of the leg muscles in a diffuse manner generating similar walking impairments."
https://openalex.org/W4285392778,"Isotope analysis has proven useful for understanding diets of animals that are difficult to track for extended periods. Bees are small yet highly mobile and often forage from multiple habitats. However, current methods of assessing diet are limited in scope. Efficient methods of tracking bee diets that integrate across life stages, distinguish habitat use, and are sensitive to taxonomic differences will inform conservation strategies. We evaluated the utility of stable isotope analysis for estimating contributions of adjacent habitats to bees' diets. We also investigated taxonomic variation in bee and flower isotope composition. We measured natural abundance of carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes in two body regions from three wild bee genera, as well as in 25 species of flowers that likely comprised their diets. Bee ∂13C and ∂15N varied with habitat and taxonomic groups (conflated with month), but did not match spatial or seasonal trends in their food plants. Flower ∂13C was lowest in the forest and in April-June, as expected if driven by water availability. However, bee ∂13C was elevated in the spring, likely from overwintering nutritional stress or unpredictable food availability. Bumble bees (Bombus) were enriched in ∂15N compared to others, possibly reflecting differences in larval feeding. Bee diet mixing models had high variation and should be interpreted with caution. Models estimated similar habitat contributions to diets of spring Andrena and overwintered Bombus queens. Summer Bombus queens and workers were indistinguishable. Sweat bees (Halictus) were estimated to use comparatively more field flowers than others. Overall, taxon more strongly influenced isotope composition than either foraging habitat or month, likely because of associated differences in sociality and timing of annual activity. Future studies seeking to reveal bee diets by isotope analysis may gain better resolution in more isotopically distinct habitats, in conjunction with controlled feeding or isotope labeling experiments."

Multistage sampling technique was used to select study participants. Self-administered questionnaire was employed to collect the data. General help seeking questionnaire with major depressive disorder case vignette was used to assess students' intention to seek help for depression. The collected data was analyzed using SPSS version 20. Simple and multiple linear regression analysis were performed to identify factors for intention to seek help for depression. Association was described by using adjusted unstandardized β coefficient along with 95% confidence interval. Finally, P-values < 0.05 in adjusted analysis were taken as a cut off for significant association.The mean score of intention to seek help from health professionals was 3.84 (±0.76)with a range of (1 ""very unlikely"" to 5 ""very likely""). About 67.8% of the study participants would seek help from health professionals if they would have depressive symptoms which was depicted in the case vignette. In the multiple linear regression analyses, student age (unstandardized ß = 0.07, 95% CI: (0.05, 0.10)), good attitude towards seeking professional help (ß = 0.03, 95% CI: (0.02, 0.04)) were factors positively associated with intention to seek help.The current study showed that more than three-fifth of the study participants reported they were likely or very likely to seek help for depression from health professionals.

This has resulted in the need to identify patients that can be discharged early before full clinical recovery. We designed this study to determine if in changes routine tests like CBCD and CRP can be a useful complement to clinical status when deciding to discharge patients from ICU.This retrospective study was conducted in Rafic Hariri University Hospital. Levels of biomarkers measured at admission (T1) and within 3 days of outcome (T2) were collected and ratios (T2/T1) were calculated. The Odds Ratios of association between the changes in these biomarkers and outcome were estimated. Multivariate analysis and AUC for the performance of these biomarkers were also conducted.We found on multivariate analysis that reduction in counts of lymphocyte and platelets and elevation in counts of neutrophils and level of CRP (T2/T1 ratio > 1) are strongly associated with mortality with respective ORs estimated at 6.74, 3.26, 5.65 and 4.34 [p-values < 0.001]. AUCs were found to lie in a range of 0.68 to 0.81 indicating fair to good performance. Other factors found to impact survival were AKI, AF and ACS [p-values < 0.01]. In contrast to other studies, risk factors didn't show an association with survival when adjusted for effects of complications and changes in biomarker levels.Our results confirm that inexpensive tests like lymphocyte count and CRP can be reliably used to follow COVID-19 patients in ICU and to support the decision to discharge patients."
https://openalex.org/W4285086589,"Cave-dwelling bats widely use anthropogenic structures such as temples in south Asia as roosting and nursery sites. Such roosts are constantly under threat, even more so after the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the importance of such roosts, there is no detailed understanding of what makes temples favorable for bats and the critical factors for their persistence. Here we relate temple microhabitat characteristics and land use around ancient temples (>400 years) to bat species richness and abundance in the Tamiraparani river basin of south India. Temples were selected for sampling along the river basin based on logistics and permission to access them. We counted bats at the roost in the mornings and late afternoons from inside the temples. Temple characteristics such as dark rooms, walkways, crevices, towers, and disturbances to the roosts were recorded. Based on European Space Agency land use classifications, we recorded land use such as crops, trees, scrub, grassland, urban areas, and water availability within a 5 km radius of the temple. Generalized Linear Mixed Models were used to relate the counts in temples with microhabitats and land use. We sampled 59 temples repeatedly across 5 years which yielded a sample of 246 survey events. The total number of bats counted was 20,211, of which Hipposideros speoris was the most common (9,715), followed by Rousettus leschenaultii (5,306), Taphozous melanopogon (3,196), Megaderma lyra (1,497), Tadarida aegyptiaca (303), Pipistrellus sp. (144) and Rhinopoma hardwickii (50). About 39% of the total bats occurred in dark rooms and 51% along walkways. Species richness and total abundance were related to the availability of dark rooms and the number of buildings in the temple. Land use elements only had a weak effect, but scrub and grassland, even though they were few, are critical for bats. We conclude that retaining undisturbed dark rooms with small exits in temples and other dimly lit areas and having natural areas around temples are vital for bat conservation."
https://openalex.org/W4285086744,"Currently, both manual and automatic evaluation technology can evaluate the translation quality of unreferenced English articles, playing a particular role in detecting translation results. Still, their deficiency is the lack of a close or noticeable relationship between evaluation time and evaluation theory. Thereupon, to realize the automatic Translation Quality Assessment (TQA) of unreferenced English articles, this paper proposes an automatic TQA model based on Sparse AutoEncoder (SAE) under the background of Deep Learning (DL). Meanwhile, the DL-based information extraction method employs AutoEncoder (AE) in the bilingual words’ unsupervised learning stage to reconstruct the translation language vector features. Then, it imports the translation information of unreferenced English articles into Bilingual words and optimizes the extraction effect of language vector features. Meantime, the translation language vector feature is introduced into the automatic DL-based TQA. The experimental findings corroborate that when the number of sentences increases, the number of actual translation errors and the evaluation scores of the proposed model increase, but the Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score is not significantly affected. When the number of sentences increases from 1,000 to 6,000, the BLEU increases from 96 to 98, which shows that the proposed model has good performance. Finally, the proposed model can realize the high-precision TQA of unreferenced English articles."

https://openalex.org/W4285087319,"Railways are an indispensable component of sustainable transportation systems, but also exact a toll on wildlife. Wild Asian elephants are often killed by trains in Assam, India, where we assess temporal variations in the occurrences of elephant-train collisions (ETCs) and casualties during 1990-2018. This study also assesses spatially varying relationships between elephant-train collision (ETC) rates and elephant and train densities in the adjoining 10 km2 grid cells of 11 prioritized railroad segments using ordinary least squares (OLS) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) models. The temporal analysis indicated that ETCs spiked at certain hours and months. The adult and calf elephant casualties on the railroads were found to be two to fivefold high during the post monsoon season compared to other seasons. During the operation period of meter gauge railroads (1990-1997), the proportions of ETCs and casualties were only 15.6% and 8.7% respectively. However, these increased substantially to 84.4% and 91.3% respectively during the operation of broad gauge railroads (1998-2018). The OLS model indicated that both elephant and train densities explained 37% of the variance of ETC rate, while GWR model showed 83% of the variance of ETC rate. The local coefficient values of GWR indicated that both the predictor variables interplayed significantly and positively to determine ETC rates in the Mariani-Nakachari and Khatkhati-Dimapur railroad segments. However, the relationship between ETC rate and elephant density is significantly negative in the Habaipur-Diphu railroad, implying that the elephant population along this railroad stretch is significantly affected by railways through large scale ETCs. Hence, there is an urgent need to address long-term mitigation strategies so that elephants can be conserved by providing safe passages and survival resources along railway lines."

Six online surveys were carried out between April 2020 and July 2021. 4,992 participants were engaged in the cross-sectional study and 203 participants who provided repeat responses were included in the subset sample of prospective cohort analysis. Primary outcomes measured were the frequency and the mode of doing the activities (online or in-person) across sixteen selected activity groups, as defined by the UK National Time Use Survey. The results show that cultural activities, spending time with others, and travelling, were the activities with the largest proportions of frequency and mode changes. The most significant changes occurred from March to June 2020, a period that included the first lockdown. Survey results from this period show a significant decrease among most of the sixteen measured activities. From March to October 2020, a period which spans the first lockdown and its subsequent ease of restrictions, showed the most significant shift from accessing activities in-person to online. Despite ‘Freedom Day’, the July 19 th 2021 date in which all restrictions were abolished, it was found that people do cultural activities and group activities at a significantly lower frequency than before the pandemic. In addition, despite a lack of restrictions after this date, more than half of participants access many activities, such as spending time with others, shopping, work and studying, online or hybrid. This study provides an invaluable insight into understanding how people in the UK changed their lifestyle, including what activities they do, and how they accessed those activities in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and related public health policy implemented to address the pandemic. These results may serve as unique evidence for policymakers."

Testing to identify and isolate infectious individuals remains the most proactive strategy for containing an ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. We developed a stochastic, compartmentalized model to simulate the impact of using Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) assays, rapid antigen tests, and vaccinations on SARS-CoV-2 spread. We compare testing strategies across an example high-income country (the United States) and low- and middle-income country (India). We detail the optimal testing frequency and coverage in the US and India to mitigate an emerging outbreak even in a vaccinated population: overall, maximizing testing frequency is most important, but having high testing coverage remains necessary when there is sustained transmission. A resource-limited vaccination strategy still requires high-frequency testing to minimize subsequent outbreaks and is 16.50% more effective in reducing cases in India than the United States. Tailoring testing strategies to transmission settings can help effectively reduce disease burden more than if a uniform approach were employed without regard to epidemiological variability across locations."

https://openalex.org/W4285391891,"Machine learning is widely used for personalisation, that is, to tune systems with the aim of adapting their behaviour to the responses of humans. This tuning relies on quantified features that capture the human actions, and also on objective functions-that is, proxies - that are intended to represent desirable outcomes. However, a learning system's representation of the world can be incomplete or insufficiently rich, for example if users' decisions are based on properties of which the system is unaware. Moreover, the incompleteness of proxies can be argued to be an intrinsic property of computational systems, as they are based on literal representations of human actions rather than on the human actions themselves; this problem is distinct from the usual aspects of bias that are examined in machine learning literature. We use mathematical analysis and simulations of a reinforcement-learning case study to demonstrate that incompleteness of representation can, first, lead to learning that is no better than random; and second, means that the learning system can be inherently unaware that it is failing. This result has implications for the limits and applications of machine learning systems in human domains."
https://openalex.org/W4285392768,"To prevent soil pollution caused by polyethylene (PE) films in the central region of Gansu, China, liquid mulching made from cow dung (CDLM) was trailed in silage maize fields. The degradation of CDLM and PE films, soil temperature, soil organic matter content, silage maize yield and water use efficiency (WUE) were evaluated for three years (2018-2020). The degradability of CDLM has been found to be much stronger than the one of PE films, with CDLM degrading 40-60 days after sowing and finishing around 100 days. CDLM had a lower insulating impact than PE films but a higher insulating effect than non-mulching films as the control (CK); CDLM could successfully increase soil organic matter, with a total increase of 1.01% over three years. CDLM increased silage maize yield by 6.2% compared to PE films and 17.2% compared to CK. Consequently, CDLM may be an interesting alternative to PE films for enhancing silage maize yield while decreasing soil contamination."
https://openalex.org/W4285392856,"Structural fluctuations of nucleosomes modulate the access to internal DNA in eukaryotic cells; clearly characterisation of this fundamental process is crucial to understanding gene regulation. Here we apply PhAST (Photochemical Analysis of Structural Transitions) to monitor at a base pair level, structural alterations induced all along the DNA upon histone binding or release. By offering the first reliable, detailed comparison of nucleosome assembly and disassembly in vitro , we reveal similarities and differences between the two processes. We identify multiple, sequential intermediate states characterised by specific PhAST signals whose localisation and amplitude reflect asymmetries of DNA/histone interactions with respect to the nucleosome pseudo dyad. These asymmetries involve not only the DNA extremities but also regions close to the pseudo dyad. Localisations of asymmetries develop in a consistent manner during both assembly and disassembly processes; they primarily reflect the DNA sequence effect on the efficiency of DNA-histone binding. More unexpectedly, the amplitude component of PhAST signals not only evolves as a function of intermediate states but does so differently between assembly and disassembly pathways. Our observation of differences between assembly and disassembly opens up new avenues to define the role of the DNA sequence in processes underlying the regulation of gene expression. Overall, we provide new insights into how the intrinsic properties of DNA are integrated into a holistic mechanism that controls chromatin structure."
https://openalex.org/W4285393407,"Background Recent studies have shown that elective induction of labor versus expectant management after 39 weeks of pregnancy result in lower incidence of perinatal complications, while the proportion of cesarean deliveries remains stable, or even decreases. Still, evidence regarding collateral consequences of the potential increase of induction of labor procedures is still lacking. Also, the results of these studies must be carefully interpreted and thoroughly counter-balanced with women’s thoughts and opinions regarding the active management of the last weeks of pregnancy. Therefore, it may be useful to develop a tool that aids in the decision-making process by differentiating women who will spontaneously go into labor from those who will require induction. Objective To develop a predictive model to calculate the probability of spontaneous onset of labor at term. Methods We designed a prospective national multicentric observational study including women enrolled at 39 weeks of gestation, carrying singleton pregnancies. After signing an informed consent form, several clinical, ultrasonographic, biophysical and biochemical variables will be collected by trained staff. If delivery has not occurred at 40 weeks of pregnancy, a second visit and evaluation will be performed. Prenatal care will be continued according to current hospital guidelines. Once recruitment is completed, the information gathered will be used to develop a logistic regression-based predictive model of spontaneous onset of labor between 39 and 41 weeks of gestation. A secondary exploration of the data collected at 40 weeks, as well as a survival analysis regarding time-to-delivery outcomes will also be performed. A total sample of 429 participants is needed for the expected number of events. Conclusion This study aims to develop a model which may help in the decision-making process during follow-up of the last weeks of pregnancy. Trial registration NCT05109247 (clinicaltrials.gov)."
