https://openalex.org/W1988652743,"Until now the most efficient solution to align nucleotide sequences containing open reading frames was to use indirect procedures that align amino acid translation before reporting the inferred gap positions at the codon level. There are two important pitfalls with this approach. Firstly, any premature stop codon impedes using such a strategy. Secondly, each sequence is translated with the same reading frame from beginning to end, so that the presence of a single additional nucleotide leads to both aberrant translation and alignment.We present an algorithm that has the same space and time complexity as the classical Needleman-Wunsch algorithm while accommodating sequencing errors and other biological deviations from the coding frame. The resulting pairwise coding sequence alignment method was extended to a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) algorithm implemented in a program called MACSE (Multiple Alignment of Coding SEquences accounting for frameshifts and stop codons). MACSE is the first automatic solution to align protein-coding gene datasets containing non-functional sequences (pseudogenes) without disrupting the underlying codon structure. It has also proved useful in detecting undocumented frameshifts in public database sequences and in aligning next-generation sequencing reads/contigs against a reference coding sequence.MACSE is distributed as an open-source java file executable with freely available source code and can be used via a web interface at: http://mbb.univ-montp2.fr/macse."
https://openalex.org/W2057028928,"Progressive ocean acidification due to anthropogenic CO(2) emissions will alter marine ecosystem processes. Calcifying organisms might be particularly vulnerable to these alterations in the speciation of the marine carbonate system. While previous research efforts have mainly focused on external dissolution of shells in seawater under saturated with respect to calcium carbonate, the internal shell interface might be more vulnerable to acidification. In the case of the blue mussel Mytilus edulis, high body fluid pCO(2) causes low pH and low carbonate concentrations in the extrapallial fluid, which is in direct contact with the inner shell surface. In order to test whether elevated seawater pCO(2) impacts calcification and inner shell surface integrity we exposed Baltic M. edulis to four different seawater pCO(2) (39, 142, 240, 405 Pa) and two food algae (310-350 cells mL(-1) vs. 1600-2000 cells mL(-1)) concentrations for a period of seven weeks during winter (5°C). We found that low food algae concentrations and high pCO(2) values each significantly decreased shell length growth. Internal shell surface corrosion of nacreous ( = aragonite) layers was documented via stereomicroscopy and SEM at the two highest pCO(2) treatments in the high food group, while it was found in all treatments in the low food group. Both factors, food and pCO(2), significantly influenced the magnitude of inner shell surface dissolution. Our findings illustrate for the first time that integrity of inner shell surfaces is tightly coupled to the animals' energy budget under conditions of CO(2) stress. It is likely that under food limited conditions, energy is allocated to more vital processes (e.g. somatic mass maintenance) instead of shell conservation. It is evident from our results that mussels exert significant biological control over the structural integrity of their inner shell surfaces."

However, if these pro-inflammatory cytokines control ADAMTS activity is not definitively known. The goal of the investigation was to study if TNF-α and IL-1β regulate syndecan-4 (SDC4) expression, and if SDC4 was responsible for promoting aggrecan degradation through controlling ADAMTS activity in nucleus pulposus cells of the intervertebral disc. Cytokine treatment increased SDC4 expression and promoter activity. Use of inhibitor, SM7368 and co-transfections with IκBα, RelA/p50 showed that NF-κΒ regulated both basal and cytokine-dependent SDC4 transcription. SDC4 promoter harboring RelA binding site mutation was unresponsive to the cytokines. Moreover, cytokines failed to increase SDC4 promoter activity in RelA-null cells. Cytokines increased ADAMTS-4/5 expression and aggrecan degradation and promoted SDC4 interaction with ADAMTS-5. Treatment with heparinase-III and p-nitrophenyl-β-D-xylopyranoside (PNPX), an inhibitor of heparan sulfate synthesis and transfection with SDC4-shRNA partially blocked cytokine mediated aggrecan degradation. Analysis of human tissues showed increased aggrecan degradation with a concomitant increase in SDC4 and ADAMTS-5 protein expression with severity of disc disease. Likewise, SDC4, TNF-α, IL-1β, ADAMTS-4, and ADAMTS-5 mRNA expression increased in degenerate tissues. We conclude that in nucleus pulposus, TNF-α and IL-1β regulate SDC4 expression, which plays a key role in pathogenesis of degenerative disc disease by promoting aggrecan degradation by ADAMTS-5."
https://openalex.org/W2160991148,"Clinically available sources of bone for repair and reconstruction are limited by the accessibility of autologous grafts, infectious risks of cadaveric materials, and durability of synthetic substitutes. Cell-based approaches for skeletal regeneration can potentially fill this need, and adipose tissue represents a promising source for development of such therapies. Here, we enriched for an osteogenic subpopulation of cells derived from human subcutaneous adipose tissue utilizing microfluidic-based single cell transcriptional analysis and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Statistical analysis of single cell transcriptional profiles demonstrated that low expression of endoglin (CD105) correlated with a subgroup of adipose-derived cells with increased osteogenic gene expression. FACS-sorted CD105(low) cells demonstrated significantly enhanced in vitro osteogenic differentiation and in vivo bone regeneration when compared with either CD105(high) or unsorted cells. Evaluation of the endoglin pathway suggested that enhanced osteogenesis among CD105(low) adipose-derived cells is likely due to identification of a subpopulation with lower TGF-β1/Smad2 signaling. These findings thus highlight a potential avenue to promote osteogenesis in adipose-derived mesenchymal cells for skeletal regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W1985075107,"Background In recent years the Later Stone Age has been redated to a much deeper time depth than previously thought. At the same time, human remains from this time period are scarce in Africa, and even rarer in West Africa. The Iwo Eleru burial is one of the few human skeletal remains associated with Later Stone Age artifacts in that region with a proposed Pleistocene date. We undertook a morphometric reanalysis of this cranium in order to better assess its affinities. We also conducted Uranium-series dating to re-evaluate its chronology. Methodology/Principal Findings A 3-D geometric morphometric analysis of cranial landmarks and semilandmarks was conducted using a large comparative fossil and modern human sample. The measurements were collected in the form of three dimensional coordinates and processed using Generalized Procrustes Analysis. Principal components, canonical variates, Mahalanobis D2 and Procrustes distance analyses were performed. The results were further visualized by comparing specimen and mean configurations. Results point to a morphological similarity with late archaic African specimens dating to the Late Pleistocene. A long bone cortical fragment was made available for U-series analysis in order to re-date the specimen. The results (∼11.7–16.3 ka) support a terminal Pleistocene chronology for the Iwo Eleru burial as was also suggested by the original radiocarbon dating results and by stratigraphic evidence. Conclusions/Significance Our findings are in accordance with suggestions of deep population substructure in Africa and a complex evolutionary process for the origin of modern humans. They further highlight the dearth of hominin finds from West Africa, and underscore our real lack of knowledge of human evolution in that region."
https://openalex.org/W2116239493,"We present immunological data from two clinical trials where the effect of experimental human hookworm (Necator americanus) infection on the pathology of celiac disease was evaluated. We found that basal production of Interferon- (IFN-)γ and Interleukin- (IL-)17A from duodenal biopsy culture was suppressed in hookworm-infected participants compared to uninfected controls. Increased levels of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ cells in the circulation and mucosa are associated with active celiac disease. We show that this accumulation also occurs during a short-term (1 week) oral gluten challenge, and that hookworm infection suppressed the increase of circulating CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ cells during this challenge period. When duodenal biopsies from hookworm-infected participants were restimulated with the immunodominant gliadin peptide QE65, robust production of IL-2, IFN-γ and IL-17A was detected, even prior to gluten challenge while participants were strictly adhering to a gluten-free diet. Intriguingly, IL-5 was produced only after hookworm infection in response to QE65. Thus we hypothesise that hookworm-induced TH2 and IL-10 cross-regulation of the TH1/TH17 inflammatory response may be responsible for the suppression of these responses during experimental hookworm infection."
https://openalex.org/W2050317530,"Background Neuroimaging has demonstrated that voluntary emotion regulation is effective in reducing amygdala activation to aversive stimuli during regulation. However, to date little is known about the sustainability of these neural effects once active emotion regulation has been terminated. Methodology/Principal Findings We addressed this issue by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in healthy female subjects. We performed an active emotion regulation task using aversive visual scenes (task 1) and a subsequent passive viewing task using the same stimuli (task 2). Here we demonstrate not only a significantly reduced amygdala activation during active regulation but also a sustained regulation effect on the amygdala in the subsequent passive viewing task. This effect was related to an immediate increase of amygdala signal in task 1 once active emotion regulation has been terminated: The larger this peak postregulation signal in the amygdala in task 1, the smaller the sustained regulation effect in task 2. Conclusions/Significance In summary, we found clear evidence that effects of voluntary emotion regulation extend beyond the period of active regulation. These findings are of importance for the understanding of emotion regulation in general, for disorders of emotion regulation and for psychotherapeutic interventions."

In this study we characterize an Arabidopsis thaliana double mutant ugd2,3 that lacks two of the four UGD isoforms. This mutant was obtained from a cross of ugd2 and ugd3 single mutants, which do not show phenotypical differences compared with the WT. In contrast, ugd2,3 has a strong dwarfed phenotype and often develops seedlings with severe root defects suggesting that the UGD2 and UGD3 isoforms act in concert. Differences in its cell wall composition in comparison to the WT were determined using biochemical methods indicating a significant reduction in arabinose, xylose, apiose, and galacturonic acid residues. Xyloglucan is less substituted with xylose, and pectins have a reduced amount of arabinan side chains. In particular, the amount of the apiose containing side chains A and B of rhamnogalacturonan II is strongly reduced, resulting in a swollen cell wall. The alternative pathway to UDP-glucuronic acid with the key enzyme myo-inositol oxygenase is not up-regulated in ugd2,3. The pathway also does not complement the ugd2,3 mutation, likely because the supply of myo-inositol is limited.

https://openalex.org/W2012896889,"The type II secretion system enables gram-negative bacteria to secrete exoproteins into the extracellular milieu. We performed biophysical and biochemical experiments to identify systematic interactions between Pseudomonas aeruginosa Xcp type II secretion system components and their substrates. We observed that three Xcp components, XcpP(C), the secretin XcpQ(D), and the pseudopilus tip, directly and specifically interact with secreted exoproteins. We established that XcpP(C), in addition to its interaction with the substrate, likely shields the entire periplasmic portion of the secreton. It can therefore be considered as the recruiter of the machinery. Moreover, the direct interaction observed between the substrate and the pseudopilus tip validates the piston model hypothesis, in which the pseudopilus pushes the substrate through the secretin pore during the secretion process. All together, our results allowed us to propose a model of the different consecutive steps followed by the substrate during the type II secretion process."
https://openalex.org/W2072197976,"To assess renoprotective effects of a blueberry-enriched diet in a rat model of hypertension. Oxidative stress (OS) appears to be involved in the development of hypertension and related renal injury. Pharmacological antioxidants can attenuate hypertension and hypertension-induced renal injury; however, attention has shifted recently to the therapeutic potential of natural products as antioxidants. Blueberries (BB) have among the highest antioxidant capacities of fruits and vegetables.Male spontaneously hypertensive rats received a BB-enriched diet (2% w/w) or an isocaloric control diet for 6 or 12 weeks or 2 days. Compared to controls, rats fed BB-enriched diet for 6 or 12 weeks exhibited lower blood pressure, improved glomerular filtration rate, and decreased renovascular resistance. As measured by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, significant decreases in total reactive oxygen species (ROS), peroxynitrite, and superoxide production rates were observed in kidney tissues in rats on long-term dietary treatment, consistent with reduced pathology and improved function. Additionally, measures of antioxidant status improved; specifically, renal glutathione and catalase activities increased markedly. Contrasted to these observations indicating reduced OS in the BB group after long-term feeding, similar measurements made in rats fed the same diet for only 2 days yielded evidence of increased OS; specifically, significant increases in total ROS, peroxynitrite, and superoxide production rates in all tissues (kidney, brain, and liver) assayed in BB-fed rats. These results were evidence of ""hormesis"" during brief exposure, which dissipated with time as indicated by enhanced levels of catalase in heart and liver of BB group.Long-term feeding of BB-enriched diet lowered blood pressure, preserved renal hemodynamics, and improved redox status in kidneys of hypertensive rats and concomitantly demonstrated the potential to delay or attenuate development of hypertension-induced renal injury, and these effects appear to be mediated by a short-term hormetic response."
https://openalex.org/W1980875662,"The use of computational models in metabolic engineering has been increasing as more genome-scale metabolic models and computational approaches become available. Various computational approaches have been developed to predict how genetic perturbations affect metabolic behavior at a systems level, and have been successfully used to engineer microbial strains with improved primary or secondary metabolite production. However, identification of metabolic engineering strategies involving a large number of perturbations is currently limited by computational resources due to the size of genome-scale models and the combinatorial nature of the problem. In this study, we present (i) two new bi-level strain design approaches using mixed-integer programming (MIP), and (ii) general solution techniques that improve the performance of MIP-based bi-level approaches. The first approach (SimOptStrain) simultaneously considers gene deletion and non-native reaction addition, while the second approach (BiMOMA) uses minimization of metabolic adjustment to predict knockout behavior in a MIP-based bi-level problem for the first time. Our general MIP solution techniques significantly reduced the CPU times needed to find optimal strategies when applied to an existing strain design approach (OptORF) (e.g., from ∼10 days to ∼5 minutes for metabolic engineering strategies with 4 gene deletions), and identified strategies for producing compounds where previous studies could not (e.g., malate and serine). Additionally, we found novel strategies using SimOptStrain with higher predicted production levels (for succinate and glycerol) than could have been found using an existing approach that considers network additions and deletions in sequential steps rather than simultaneously. Finally, using BiMOMA we found novel strategies involving large numbers of modifications (for pyruvate and glutamate), which sequential search and genetic algorithms were unable to find. The approaches and solution techniques developed here will facilitate the strain design process and extend the scope of its application to metabolic engineering."

Although the role of GSK-3β in osteoblasts is well characterized as a negative regulator of β-catenin, its effect on osteoclast formation remains largely unidentified. Here, we show that the GSK-3β inactivation upon receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) stimulation is crucial for osteoclast differentiation. Regulation of GSK-3β activity in bone marrow macrophages by retroviral expression of the constitutively active GSK-3β (GSK3β-S9A) mutant inhibits RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis, whereas expression of the catalytically inactive GSK-3β (GSK3β-K85R) or small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated GSK-3β silencing enhances osteoclast formation.

https://openalex.org/W2089411617,"The search for antituberculosis drugs active against persistent bacilli has led to our interest in metallodependent class II fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (FBA-tb), a key enzyme of gluconeogenesis absent from mammalian cells. Knock-out experiments at the fba-tb locus indicated that this gene is required for the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis on gluconeogenetic substrates and in glucose-containing medium. Surface labeling and enzymatic activity measurements revealed that this enzyme was exported to the cell surface of M. tuberculosis and produced under various axenic growth conditions including oxygen depletion and hence by non-replicating bacilli. Importantly, FBA-tb was also produced in vivo in the lungs of infected guinea pigs and mice. FBA-tb bound human plasmin(ogen) and protected FBA-tb-bound plasmin from regulation by α2-antiplasmin, suggestive of an involvement of this enzyme in host/pathogen interactions. The crystal structures of FBA-tb in the native form and in complex with a hydroxamate substrate analog were determined to 2.35- and 1.9-Å resolution, respectively. Whereas inhibitor attachment had no effect on the plasminogen binding activity of FBA-tb, it competed with the natural substrate of the enzyme, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, and substantiated a previously unknown reaction mechanism associated with metallodependent aldolases involving recruitment of the catalytic zinc ion by the substrate upon active site binding.

https://openalex.org/W2063566928,"Malaria has reemerged in many regions where once it was nearly eliminated. Yet the source of these parasites, the process of repopulation, their population structure, and dynamics are ill defined. Peru was one of malaria eradication's successes, where Plasmodium falciparum was nearly eliminated for two decades. It reemerged in the 1990s. In the new era of malaria elimination, Peruvian P. falciparum is a model of malaria reinvasion. We investigated its population structure and drug resistance profiles. We hypothesized that only populations adapted to local ecological niches could expand and repopulate and originated as vestigial populations or recent introductions. We investigated the genetic structure (using microsatellites) and drug resistant genotypes of 220 parasites collected from patients immediately after peak epidemic expansion (1999–2000) from seven sites across the country. The majority of parasites could be grouped into five clonal lineages by networks and AMOVA. The distribution of clonal lineages and their drug sensitivity profiles suggested geographic structure. In 2001, artesunate combination therapy was introduced in Peru. We tested 62 parasites collected in 2006–2007 for changes in genetic structure. Clonal lineages had recombined under selection for the fittest parasites. Our findings illustrate that local adaptations in the post-eradication era have contributed to clonal lineage expansion. Within the shifting confluence of drug policy and malaria incidence, populations continue to evolve through genetic outcrossing influenced by antimalarial selection pressure. Understanding the population substructure of P. falciparum has implications for vaccine, drug, and epidemiologic studies, including monitoring malaria during and after the elimination phase."
https://openalex.org/W2041685436,"AZD8055 is an ATP-competitive inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) that forms two multiprotein complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, and negatively regulates autophagy. We demonstrate that AZD8055 stimulates and potentiates chemotherapy-mediated autophagy, as shown by LC3I-II conversion and down-regulation of the ubiquitin-binding protein p62/sequestosome 1. AZD8055-induced autophagy was pro-survival as shown by its ability to attenuate cell death and DNA damage (p-H2AX), and to enhance clonogenic survival by cytotoxic chemotherapy. Autophagy inhibition by siRNA against Beclin 1 or LC3B, or by chloroquine, partially reversed the cytoprotective effect of AZD8055 that was independent of cell cycle inhibition. The pro-survival role of autophagy was confirmed using ectopic expression of Beclin 1 that conferred cytoprotection. To determine whether autophagy-mediated down-regulation of p62/sequestosome 1 contributes to its pro-survival role, we generated p62 knockdown cells using shRNA that showed protection from chemotherapy-induced cell death and DNA damage. We also overexpressed wild-type (wt) p62 that promoted chemotherapy-induced cell death, whereas mutated p62 at functional domains (PB1, UBA) failed to do so. The ability of ectopic wt p62 to promote cell death was blocked by AZD8055. AZD8055 was shown to inhibit phosphorylation of the autophagy-initiating kinase ULK1 at Ser757 and inhibited known targets of mTORC1 (p-mTOR Ser2448, p70S6K, p-S6, p4EBP1) and mTORC2 (p-mTOR Ser2481, p-AKT Ser473). Knockdown of mTOR, but not Raptor or Rictor, reduced p-ULK1 at Ser757 and enhanced chemotherapy-induced autophagy that resulted in a similar cytoprotective effect as shown for AZD8055.

Furthermore, rapamycin-resistant functions of mTORC1 can lead to increased AKT signaling that may be overcome by dual mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibition (11Meric-Bernstam F. Gonzalez-Angulo A.M. J. Clin.

AZD8055 is a more potent inhibitor of cell proliferation than is rapamycin and has also been shown to inhibit the growth of xenografts representing a broad range of human tumor types (13Chresta C.M.

Under conditions of cellular stress (nutrient deprivation, hypoxia, or cytotoxic stress), tumor cells induce autophagy to maintain energy metabolism and to enable cell survival. Therefore, autophagy serves as a mechanism of stress tolerance that can protect tumor cells from anti-cancer therapy (20Degenhardt K. Mathew R. Beaudoin B. Bray K. Anderson D. Chen G. Mukherjee C.

Cancer Res. 2009; 15: 5308-5316Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). In some cellular contexts, sustained or prolonged autophagy may trigger cell death although its relevance in tumors remains unknown (22Kroemer G. Levine B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 1004-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar). Autophagy is regulated by Beclin 1 that forms a complex with a class III PI3 kinase, Vps34, that is involved in autophagosome formation (19Pattingre S. Espert L. Biard-Piechaczyk M. Codogno P. Biochimie. 2008; 90: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) during which the cytosolic microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3-I) is converted to the membrane-bound LC3-II form (23Kabeya Y.

LC3-II is known to bind to the ubiquitin-binding protein p62/sequestosome 1 (SQSTM 1) that transports protein aggregates to the lysosome for their degradation by autophagy (24Pankiv S. Clausen T.H.

Evidence suggests that p62 acts as a signaling hub through its ability to recruit and oligomerize important signaling molecules into cytosolic aggregates to control cell survival and apoptosis (26Sanz L.

Cell. 2009; 137: 721-735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). We studied the ability of AZD8055-induced autophagy to modulate chemotherapy-induced DNA damage and cell death, and determined the role of autophagy-mediated down-regulation of p62 in this process. AZD8055 was shown to significantly attenuate chemotherapy-induced DNA damage and cell death that was independent of cell cycle inhibition and was associated with induction of pro-survival autophagy. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of autophagy partially reversed AZD8055-mediated cytoprotection. Autophagy induction by AZD8055 was due to direct inhibition of mTOR kinase and the dephosphorylation of ULK1 at Ser757. Furthermore, autophagy-mediated down-regulation of p62/sequestosome 1 was shown to contribute to the pro-survival effect of autophagy. Colon carcinoma cell lines (HT-29, DLD-1) were cultured as monolayers in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS and 2 mmol/L of l-glutamine. Cells were treated with AZD8055 [5-{2,4-Bis[(3S)-3-methylmorpholin-4-yl]pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-7-yl}B-2-methoxyphenyl)methanol], obtained from Dr. C. Yu (Roswell Park, Buffalo, NY), or rapamycin (LC Lab., Woburn, MA), alone and in combination with 5-fluorouracil or CPT-11 (both from Sigma) in the presence or absence of chloroquine (Sigma). AZD8055 and rapamycin were prepared as 10 mmol/liter stock solutions in DMSO and stored at −20 °C. Protein samples were prepared in a lysis buffer (5 mmol/liter MgCl2, 137 mmol/liter KCl, 1 mmol/liter EDTA, 1 mmol/liter EGTA, 1% CHAPS, 10 mmol/liter HEPES (pH 7.5)) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and were normalized using nanodrop measurement (Thermo Scientific, Franklin, MA) or a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). The samples were boiled in LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) and loaded onto a 14% SDS-PAGE gel for protein separation with electrophoretic transfer onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked in 0.2% I-Block (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in 1× PBS/0.1% Tween 20 and then probed with the respective primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After washing and incubation with secondary antibodies, the immunoblotted proteins were visualized using the CDP-star alkaline phosphatase chemiluminescence substrate (Applied Biosystems). All primary antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling (Boston, MA) with the exception of antibodies against p62/SQSTM 1 (MBL, Woburn, MA) and tubulin (Sigma). Experiments were repeated and results from representative immunoblots are shown. The lentiviral shRNA for mTOR (plasmid 1855 and 1856) and a scramble shRNA (plasmid 1864) were obtained from Addgene (Cambridge, MA). For p62 knockdown, a shRNA targeting sequence (GCATTGAAGTTGATATCGAT) was cloned into pSIH1-puro, as previously described (28Huang S. Sinicrope F.A. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 2944-2951Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). A non-targeting control sequence (CAACAAGATGAAGAGCACCAA; Sigma) was also cloned into pSIH1-puro. The p27 cDNA (Origene, Rockville, MD) was cloned into a lentiviral cDNA expression vector pCDH1-puro (System Biosciences, Mountain View, CA), as previously described (29Huang S. Sinicrope F.A. Autophagy. 2010; 6: 256-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Each of the lentiviral expression constructs was then mixed with two packaging plasmids (Addgene plasmids 12259 and 12260) and transfected into HEK293T cells using Lipofactamine/PLUS reagent (Invitrogen) to produce lentivirus. The resultant lentivirus-containing medium was concentrated by incubating with 10% PEG-8000 (Sigma) and centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 10 min. The virus-containing pellet was then resuspended in a small volume of OPTI-MEM medium (Invitrogen) and directly added to the target cells in the presence of 8 μg/ml polybrene (Sigma). siRNA oligonucleotides for mTOR, Beclin 1, and LC3B (all from Cell Signaling) and Raptor or Rictor siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were transfected into target cells using Lipofectamine™ RNAiMAX Reagent (Invitrogen), per the manufacture's protocol. Briefly, cells were seeded onto 6-well plates at ∼50% confluence in 2.5 ml complete medium without antibiotics and incubated overnight. A total of 75–300 nmol siRNA was diluted into 0.5 ml of OPTI-MEM medium (Invitrogen) containing 7.5 μl of RNAiMAX reagent and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The siRNA/RNAiMAX complex formed was directly added into the 6-well plates to produce a final concentration of 25–100 nm siRNA. Cells were then returned to incubation and knockdown efficiency was determined at least 72 h post-transfection by immunoblotting. Beclin 1 (Origene) or p62 (gift of Dr. S. V. Reddy, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC) cDNA was cloned into a retroviral expression vector containing an N-terminal 3-tandem tag (s-tag, 2X FLAG and streptavidin-binding protein tag; 3-tag) that was derived from a parent empty vector (30Huang S. Sinicrope F.A. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2010; 9: 742-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Using site-directed mutagenesis, p62 mutants were generated at UBA or PB1 domains containing mutations of I431A or D69A sites, respectively, that have been shown to impair the ability of p62 to be sequestered into aggregates (31Donaldson K.M. Li W. Ching K.A. Batalov S. Tsai C.C. Joazeiro C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 8892-8897Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) (32Bj⊘rk⊘y G. Lamark T. Brech A. Outzen H. Perander M. Overvatn A. Stenmark H. Johansen T. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2506) Google Scholar). The resultant retroviral vectors encoding Beclin 1, p62 (WT or mutant), or empty vector were individually mixed with packaging plasmids and retrovirus was generated, as previously described (30Huang S. Sinicrope F.A. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2010; 9: 742-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Retrovirus-containing supernatant was concentrated and utilized to transduce the target cells, as previously described (30Huang S. Sinicrope F.A. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2010; 9: 742-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of the 3-tag proteins was detected using an anti-FLAG antibody or by a size shift from endogenous proteins. Cells were plated onto Lab-Tek® II CC2TM chamber slides, incubated overnight in media, and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were rinsed with PBS ×2 and then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS at room temperature for 10 min. Cells were incubated with the primary antibody (anti-FLAG, Cell Signaling) diluted in 1% BSA in PBS at room temperature for 1 h. After rinsing in PBS ×3, a fluorescence dye-conjugated secondary antibody (AF594, Invitrogen) diluted in 1% BSA in PBS was added and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Slides were rinsed with PBS and mounted. Immunofluorescence was visualized and captured using an inverted LSM 5 Pascal Laser Scanning Microscope (Carl Zeiss) with appropriate filter and detector combinations according to the spectrum of the fluorochrome used. For cell cycle analysis, cells were detached with trypsin, washed once with cold PBS, and then counted. An aliquot of 0.5–1 × 106 cells was centrifuged and pelleted, then resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS. Cells were fixed by adding 0.5 ml of 100% cold ethanol while vortexing, followed by incubation at −20 °C overnight. Cells were centrifuged, pelleted, and resuspended in 0.5 ml of PI-RNase solution (50 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI) plus 100 μg/ml RNase A (Sigma) in PBS). Cells were stained with PI for at least 20 min at room temperature and then analyzed by flow cytometry. Cell cycle distribution was determined using ModFit LT (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME). Cell death was measured with the annexin V assay (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), as previously described (30Huang S. Sinicrope F.A. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2010; 9: 742-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). After drug treatment, adherent cells were detached from culture dishes by trypsinization for 3 to 5 min and then combined with floating cells. The extent of apoptosis was indicated as the percentage of Annexin V+PI− cells, whereas cells labeled Annexin V+PI+ were interpreted to represent late apoptosis or necrosis. Cells were plated in 6-well plates and treated with the study drugs for 3 days. Cells were then lifted using TrypLE™ Express (Invitrogen), a trypsin replacement that is stable at RT, and counted with a cell counter (Bio-Rad). Then, 20 × 104 cells for each condition were plated onto 10-cm dishes and incubated. Cells carrying ectopic Beclin 1 were directly seeded (200 cells/well) onto 6-well plates, allowed to attach overnight, and then treated with the study drugs for 3 days. After incubating in drug-free medium at 37 °C for 7 to 14 days, colonies were fixed and stained with crystal violet. Excess dye was rinsed off with tap water, and the plates were air dried. The statistical significance of the differences between experimental variables was determined using the Student's t test. The values shown represent the mean ± S.D. for triplicate experiments. p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. We determined whether AZD8055 can modulate cell death induction by cytotoxic drugs in human colon cancer cell lines (HT-29, DLD1). While AZD8055 alone did not induce cell death, AZD8055 was shown to significantly reduce 5-FU-induced cell death by 41 to 46% as shown by annexin V+ labeling (Fig. 1A), and attenuated 5-FU-induced caspase-9 and -3 cleavage (Fig. 1B) compared with 5-FU alone. AZD8055 treatment was also shown to reduce 5-FU-induced DNA damage in both cell lines, as shown by expression of p-H2AX, a marker of DNA double-strand breaks (Fig. 1C). To demonstrate that the protective effect of AZD8055 was not limited to 5-FU, we utilized the topoisomerase 1 inhibitor CPT-11 (irinotecan) and found that AZD8055 can similarly attenuate CPT-11-induced caspase cleavage and DNA damage (Fig. 1, B and C). We then studied the effect of AZD8055 alone and in combination with 5-FU on long-term cell viability in a clonogenic survival assay. While AZD8055 did not inhibit clonogenic survival in contrast to 5-FU, AZD8055 was shown to significantly attenuate the ability of 5-FU to inhibit colony formation (Fig. 1D). Because AZD8055 is known to potently inhibit cell proliferation (13Chresta C.M. Davies B.R. Hickson I. Harding T. Cosulich S. Critchlow S.E. Vincent J.P. Ellston R. Jones D. Sini P. James D. Howard Z. Dudley P. Hughes G. Smith L. Maguire S. Hummersone M. Malagu K. Menear K. Jenkins R. Jacobsen M. Smith G.C. Guichard S. Pass M. Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 288-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar), we examined the ability of AZD8055 to modulate expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitor, p27Kip1, that inhibits G1 cyclin/cdk complexes to produce cell cycle arrest (33Toyoshima H. Hunter T. Cell. 1994; 78: 67-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar, 34Polyak K. Kato J.Y. Solomon M.J. Sherr C.J. Massague J. Roberts J.M. Koff A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1831) Google Scholar). AZD8055 was shown to induce p27Kip1protein expression in both cell lines (Fig. 2A). To determine whether p27Kip1 can contribute to cytoprotection, we generated DLD1 cells that overexpress a lentiviral p27 construct. Stable overexpression of p27Kip1 increased accumulation of cells in G1 compared with control cells (62.9 ± 0.5% versus 52.9 ± 0.6%). Cells were then treated with 5-FU or oxaliplatin, an alkylating agent whose cytotoxic effect is independent of the cell cycle (35Wilkes G. Clin. J. Oncol. Nursing. 2003; 7: 353-356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of p27Kip1 failed to attenuate 5-FU- or oxaliplatin-induced caspase cleavage or DNA damage (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, AZD8055 was shown to block oxaliplatin-induced DNA damage and caspase cleavage (Fig. 2C). Together, these data suggest that the cytoprotective effect of AZD8055 is unrelated to cell cycle inhibition. Whereas mTOR is known to negatively regulate autophagy (19Pattingre S. Espert L. Biard-Piechaczyk M. Codogno P. Biochimie. 2008; 90: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), the effect of autophagy induction on chemotherapy-induced cell death is poorly defined. We demonstrate that AZD8055 can induce autophagy and potentiate autophagy induction by 5-FU, CPT-11 (Fig. 3, A and B), or oxaliplatin (Fig. 2C), as shown by LC3I-II conversion and reduced expression of the autophagy substrate, p62/SQSTM1. To confirm that down-regulation of p62 was mediated by autophagy, we utilized the anti-malarial drug CQ that prevents lysosomal acidification to block autophagic catabolism (21White E. DiPaola R.S. Clin. Cancer Res. 2009; 15: 5308-5316Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with CQ or CQ plus AZD8055 and 5-FU was shown to accumulate p62 consistent with inhibition of autophagy (Fig. 3, A and C). AZD8055 was shown to induce autophagy to a greater extent than did rapamycin (Fig. 3B). In contrast to AZD8055 (Fig. 1), rapamycin at equivalent doses induced caspase-3 cleavage (Fig. 3B) and failed to confer cytoprotection against 5-FU (Fig. 3B). To determine whether pro-survival autophagy can account for the cytoprotective effect of AZD8055, we inhibited autophagy using CQ or by gene knockdown. The addition of CQ to AZD8055 plus 5-FU resulted in the accumulation of LC3II and p62 and enhanced both DNA damage (p-H2AX) and caspase cleavage (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, knockdown of LC3B or Beclin 1 by siRNA attenuated LC3I-II conversion and potentiated caspase cleavage and DNA damage induced by 5-FU alone or combined with AZD8055 (Fig. 3C). To further support autophagy as the mechanism of AZD8055-mediated cytoprotection, we generated HT-29 cells that constitutively express Beclin 1. Overexpression of Beclin 1 (versus vector control) was shown to increase LC3I-II conversion in the presence of CQ or combined with 5-FU (Fig. 4A), indicating the ability of Beclin 1 to increase autophagic flux. Beclin 1 overexpression-protected cells from 5-FU-induced caspase-9 and -3 cleavage and from DNA damage, (p-H2AX) [Fig. 4A]. Furthermore, ectopic Beclin 1 was shown to significantly attenuate the ability of 5-FU or oxaliplatin to reduce colony formation in a clonogenic survival assay (Fig. 4B). Taken together, these data indicate that AZD8055 induces pro-survival autophagy that underlies its ability to attenuate chemotherapy-mediated cell death. AZD8055 was shown to stimulate autophagy and enhance chemotherapy-induced autophagy that were associated with a reduction in p62/SQSTM 1 expression levels (Fig. 3 A). Evidence suggests that p62 acts as a signaling hub through its ability to recruit and oligomerize important signaling molecules into cytosolic aggregates to regulate cell survival and apoptosis (26Sanz L. Diaz-Meco M.T. Nakano H. Moscat J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1576-1586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Jin Z. Li Y. Pitti R. Lawrence D. Pham V.C. Lill J.R. Ashkenazi A. Cell. 2009; 137: 721-735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). To determine whether autophagy-mediated down-regulation of p62 can contribute to the cytoprotective effect of AZD8055, we generated cells with knockdown of p62 by shRNA. Suppression of p62 was shown to significantly attenuate 5-FU-induced apoptosis, as shown by annexin V+ PI− labeling (Fig. 5A) and caspase-8, -9, -3 cleavage (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, suppression of p62 also attenuated 5-FU-induced DNA damage (Fig. 5, C and D). Despite the ability of the autophagy inhibitor CQ to accumulate p62 (Fig. 3, A and C), attenuation of 5-FU-induced apoptosis by p62 knockdown was maintained in the presence of CQ (Fig. 5, A and B). Next, we generated cells with ectopic wild-type (WT) or mutant p62 proteins that can mimic the accumulation of p62 that occurs when autophagy is disabled. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we generated mutations in p62 at the ubiquitin-associated (UBA: I431A) and PB1 (PB1: D69A) domains (31Donaldson K.M. Li W. Ching K.A. Batalov S. Tsai C.C.

https://openalex.org/W2032769297,"As single agents, ABT-263 and ABT-737 (ABT), molecular antagonists of the Bcl-2 family, bind tightly to Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Bcl-w, but not to Mcl-1, and induce apoptosis only in limited cell types. The compound 2-deoxyglucose (2DG), in contrast, partially blocks glycolysis, slowing cell growth but rarely causing cell death. Injected into an animal, 2DG accumulates predominantly in tumors but does not harm other tissues. However, when cells that were highly resistant to ABT were pre-treated with 2DG for 3 hours, ABT became a potent inducer of apoptosis, rapidly releasing cytochrome c from the mitochondria and activating caspases at submicromolar concentrations in a Bak/Bax-dependent manner. Bak is normally sequestered in complexes with Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL. 2DG primes cells by interfering with Bak-Mcl-1 association, making it easier for ABT to dissociate Bak from Bcl-xL, freeing Bak to induce apoptosis. A highly active glucose transporter and Bid, as an agent of the mitochondrial apoptotic signal amplification loop, are necessary for efficient apoptosis induction in this system. This combination treatment of cancer-bearing mice was very effective against tumor xenograft from hormone-independent highly metastasized chemo-resistant human prostate cancer cells, suggesting that the combination treatment may provide a safe and effective alternative to genotoxin-based cancer therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2050520098,"Blood glucose homeostasis between meals depends upon production of glucose within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of the liver and kidney by hydrolysis of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) into glucose and phosphate (Pi). This reaction depends on coupling the G6P transporter (G6PT) with glucose-6-phosphatase-α (G6Pase-α). Only one G6PT, also known as SLC37A4, has been characterized, and it acts as a Pi-linked G6P antiporter. The other three SLC37 family members, predicted to be sugar-phosphate:Pi exchangers, have not been characterized functionally. Using reconstituted proteoliposomes, we examine the antiporter activity of the other SLC37 members along with their ability to couple with G6Pase-α. G6PT- and mock-proteoliposomes are used as positive and negative controls, respectively. We show that SLC37A1 and SLC37A2 are ER-associated, Pi-linked antiporters, that can transport G6P. Unlike G6PT, neither is sensitive to chlorogenic acid, a competitive inhibitor of physiological ER G6P transport, and neither couples to G6Pase-α. We conclude that three of the four SLC37 family members are functional sugar-phosphate antiporters.

Several different microbial pathways of nicotine metabolism have been reported: Arthrobacter uses the pyridine pathway, and Pseudomonas, like mammals, uses the pyrrolidine pathway. We identified and characterized a novel 6-hydroxy-3-succinoyl-pyridine (HSP) hydroxylase (HspB) using enzyme purification, peptide sequencing, and sequencing of the Pseudomonas putida S16 genome. The HSP hydroxylase has no known orthologs and converts HSP to 2,5-dihydroxy-pyridine and succinic semialdehyde, using NADH. (18)O(2) labeling experiments provided direct evidence for the incorporation of oxygen from O(2) into 2,5-dihydroxy-pyridine. The hspB gene deletion showed that this enzyme is essential for nicotine degradation, and site-directed mutagenesis identified an FAD-binding domain. This study demonstrates the importance of the newly discovered enzyme HspB, which is crucial for nicotine degradation by the Pseudomonas strain."

Trypanosoma brucei is unusual in having five metacaspases (MCA1–MCA5), of which MCA1 and MCA4 have active site substitutions, making them possible non-enzymatic homologues. Here we demonstrate that recombinant MCA4 lacks detectable peptidase activity despite maintaining a functional peptidase structure. MCA4 is expressed primarily in the bloodstream form of the parasite and associates with the flagellar membrane via dual myristoylation/palmitoylation. Loss of function phenotyping revealed critical roles for MCA4; rapid depletion by RNAi caused lethal disruption to the parasite's cell cycle, yet the generation of MCA4 null mutant parasites (Δmca4) was possible. Δmca4 had normal growth in axenic culture but markedly reduced virulence in mice. Further analysis revealed that MCA4 is released from the parasite and is specifically processed by MCA3, the only metacaspase that is both palmitoylated and enzymatically active. Accordingly, we have identified that the multiple metacaspases in T. brucei form a membrane-associated proteolytic cascade to generate a pseudopeptidase virulence factor.

https://openalex.org/W2098757961,"Membrane repair is mediated by multiprotein complexes, such as that formed between the dimeric EF-hand protein S100A10, the calcium- and phospholipid-binding protein annexin A2, the enlargeosome protein AHNAK, and members of the transmembrane ferlin family. Although interactions between these proteins have been shown, little is known about their structural arrangement and mechanisms of formation. In this work, we used a non-covalent complex between S100A10 and the N terminus of annexin A2 (residues 1–15) and a designed hybrid protein (A10A2), where S100A10 is linked in tandem to the N-terminal region of annexin A2, to explore the binding region, stoichiometry, and affinity with a synthetic peptide from the C terminus of AHNAK. Using multiple biophysical methods, we identified a novel asymmetric arrangement between a single AHNAK peptide and the A10A2 dimer. The AHNAK peptide was shown to require the annexin A2 N terminus, indicating that the AHNAK binding site comprises regions on both S100A10 and annexin proteins.

IntroductionThe fusion of cellular phospholipid membranes is an important step during membrane repair, vesicular trafficking, and exocytosis. A requisite for plasma membrane repair is calcium-regulated exocytosis, controlled by a number of proteins that coordinate resealing of the membrane. One exocytotic compartment implicated in membrane fusion is the enlargeosome, characterized by the large scaffolding protein AHNAK, that relocates to the plasma membrane immediately following membrane damage (1Zhang Z.Q. Wietgrefe S.W. Li Q. Shore M.D. Duan L. Reilly C. Lifson J.D. Haase A.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 5640-5645Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In addition to AHNAK, calcium sensors, such as members from the synaptotagmin, ferlin (dysferlin), and annexin protein families, are involved in membrane repair. Upon membrane rupture, these sensor proteins respond to the calcium influx by localizing near the inner membrane surface. For example, annexins A1 and A2 have been implicated in skeletal muscle cell repair based on their calcium-dependent interaction and localization with dysferlin near the plasma membrane (2Lennon N.J. Kho A. Bacskai B.J. Perlmutter S.L. Hyman B.T. Brown Jr., R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50466-50473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), whereas others, such as the SNARE protein VAMP2, have been shown to co-localize and interact with annexin A2 and S100A10 during exocytosis in chromaffin cells (3Umbrecht-Jenck E. Demais V. Calco V. Bailly Y. Bader M.F. Chasserot-Golaz S. Traffic. 2010; 11: 958-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Recent proteomic analyses have identified ∼115 proteins in the dysferlin complex, including calpain 3, annexin A2, and AHNAK (4de Morrée A. Hensbergen P.J. van Haagen H.H. Dragan I. Deelder A.M.

These studies indicate that large protein complexes are probably needed to orchestrate the repair process and restore the integrity of the membrane.One potential multiprotein repair complex includes S100A10, annexin A2, AHNAK, and actin identified in enlargeosomes. S100A10 is a member of the S100 protein family of dimeric, EF-hand proteins. Three-dimensional structures of several S100 proteins have revealed a calcium-induced conformational change in these molecules (6Rintala-Dempsey A.C. Santamaria-Kisiel L. Liao Y. Lajoie G. Shaw G.S.

Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 324-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) that modulates their interactions with other proteins. S100A10 is a unique member of the family that has lost its ability to accommodate calcium ions due to alterations in both of its calcium-binding loops. Consequently, S100A10 recruits annexins A1 and A2 (8Réty S. Sopkova J. Renouard M. Osterloh D. Gerke V. Tabaries S. Russo-Marie F. Lewit-Bentley A. Nat. Struct.

Members of the annexin family form a group of highly helical proteins containing a core domain composed of four (annexins A1–A5, A7–A11, and A13) or eight (annexin A6) conserved structural repeat sequences (I–IV), each about 70–75 residues in length, and a short N-terminal region (21Rosengarth A.

Biol. 2003; 326: 1317-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Calcium binding to the annexins promotes their localization and association with phospholipid-containing membranes through the convex surface of the core domain (23Swairjo M.A. Concha N.O. Kaetzel M.A. Dedman J.R. Seaton B.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 968-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In the case of annexins A1 and A2, calcium binding is proposed to lead to the release of the previously buried N terminus to an exposed position available for interaction with S100A10 protein (24Gerke V. Moss S.E. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 331-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (1610) Google Scholar). Thus, an S100A10 dimer can coordinate a pair of annexin A2 proteins, potentially bridging adjacent phospholipid membranes into close proximity during a membrane fusion event (24Gerke V. Moss S.E. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 331-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (1610) Google Scholar). As with S100A10 and annexin A2, the enlargeosome protein AHNAK is also trafficked to the plasma membrane in response to calcium flux (25Kouno M. Kondoh G. Horie K. Komazawa N. Ishii N. Takahashi Y. Takeda J. Hashimoto T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2004; 123: 700-707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Recruitment of AHNAK to the plasma membrane by S100A10 in complex with annexin A2 is also proposed to maintain the proper cytoarchitecture of epithelial cells (26Benaud C. Gentil B.J. Assard N.

In this work, we have used peptide array analysis to uncover the binding site(s) for the S100A10-annexin A2 complex with the C-terminal region of AHNAK. We provide evidence for a novel asymmetric interaction between the S100A10-annexin A2 dimer and AHNAK that requires contributions from both the S100A10 protein and the N terminus of annexin A2 and utilizes a surface not previously observed in any other S100 target protein complex. Overall, our work indicates a novel ternary arrangement of S100A10, annexin A2, and AHNAK that provides the first structural model of a multiprotein assemblage required for membrane repair.RESULTSThe crystal structures of calcium-S100A11 and S100A10 bound to the N-terminal regions of the phospholipid-binding proteins annexin A1 (9Rety S.

These structures show that some variation in the target peptide binding site exists (46Rezvanpour A. Shaw G.S. Gen. Physiol. Biophys. 2009; 28: F39-F46Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), although a symmetric arrangement is always maintained, comprising two S100 protomers and two target peptides. Structural information on the architecture of higher order complexes, such as those involving S100A10, annexin A2, and the AHNAK, are unknown and would be important to understand how this group of proteins assembles to participate in the cell membrane repair process. To examine how S100A10 and annexin A2 recruit AHNAK, we used two S100A10 complexes. The first utilized a non-covalent complex between S100A10 and a 15-residue N-terminal peptide from annexin A2. In addition, we used a hybrid protein complex (A10A2) in which S100A10 was linked in tandem to the N-terminal 15 residues of annexin A2, separated by a 9-residue spacer sequence. Previous work has shown that the A10A2 hybrid protein has an association and structure similar to those of the non-covalent S100A10-annexin A2 peptide complex (32Rezvanpour A. Phillips J.M. Shaw G.S. Protein Sci. 2009; 18: 2528-2536Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).A10A2 Binds to Multiple Consensus Regions on AHNAKTo identify the AHNAK residues involved in the interaction with annexin A2-bound S100A10 complex, Alexa Fluor 680-labeled A10A2 hybrid (Alexa-A10A2) protein was used in two separate peptide array experiments covering the C terminus of AHNAK (residues 4884–5890). This approach identifies the sequence-dependent but structurally independent interactions between A10A2 and a series of 18-residue peptides spanning the C-terminal sequence of AHNAK. Overlapping sequences in the arrays that fluoresced upon Alexa-A10A2 binding were used to identify the AHNAK binding sites (Fig. 1). Blotting of the arrays with Alexa-A10A2 revealed that A10A2 associates with eight distinct regions within the C terminus of AHNAK. Using the Blocks Server (available on the World Wide Web) to analyze these regions, a 10-residue consensus sequence was identified for AHNAK that could best be represented as ϕ+X+XPKϕXϕ (where X is variable, ϕ represents a hydrophobic residue; and + represents a positively charged residue).Examination of the sequences that interact with A10A2 allowed for the identification of some general trends. For example, sequences b, e, and f show the highest sequence similarity, whereas the most intense binding at any one spot was observed within sequences b and e (4968–4985 and 5652–5669). Because the residues of the conserved motif for these sequences are identical, the differences in the binding intensities for A10A2 could indicate that the variable residues in the motif or residues on the periphery may be important for the interaction. Sequences a, d, and g showed weaker interactions with the A10A2 protein, probably due to one or more substitutions within the consensus region. For example, sequences a and d have a histidine at the first position instead of lysine, whereas sequences d and g have a small non-polar residue (G/S) at the last position in place of a larger hydrophobe. Sequence c is unusual due to the presence of two possible consensus sequences, the first as shown in Fig. 1 and an alternate sequence starting at Ala5229, 5 residues prior to the indicated consensus sequence.In general, these results agree with a previous study in which the S100A10-annexin A2 binding region within the C terminus of AHNAK was mapped utilizing a series of GST-AHNAK deletion mutants by pull-down assays (30De Seranno S. Benaud C. Assard N. Khediri S. Gerke V. Baudier J. Delphin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35030-35038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A 20-residue region in the C terminus of AHNAK corresponding to residues 5654–5673 (lying within sequence e, residues 5652–5675) was shown to be sufficient for binding to the S100A10-annexin A2 complex. Further deletions from the N- or C-terminal extremity of this 20-residue peptide abolished the interaction with the S100A10-annexin A2 complex, confirming that these residues are crucial for the interaction (30De Seranno S.

Initially, the AHNAK5 peptide was titrated into a non-covalent complex formed between 15N-labeled S100A10 and unlabeled annexin A2 peptides (residues 1–15) (Fig. 2A). In the absence of AHNAK5, a single resonance was observed in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum for each residue in S100A10, consistent with the symmetric structure of the S100A10-annexin A2 complex, where only the 15N-labeled S100A10 is visible. Titration of unlabeled AHNAK5 peptide to this solution led to the gradual disappearance of many of the S100A10 resonances in the S100A10-annexin A2 complex and the reappearance of new peaks, indicative of a slow exchange binding process. Remarkably, the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of the 15N-labeled S100A10 in the presence of annexin A2 and AHNAK5 resulted in an increased number of peaks that did not change even in the presence of a 4-fold excess of AHNAK5 peptide. In addition, many of the new resonances appeared in pairs, with each peak having ∼50% of the intensity of the original peak (Fig. 2A). For example, Phe13, Ala50, Val66, Ala76, and Gly77 in 15N-labeled S100A10 all appeared as two peaks in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of S100A10-annexin A2 in complex with AHNAK5.FIGURE 2An overlay of 1H-15N HSQC spectra of annexin A2-bound S100A10 or A10A2 hybrid protein complexes bound to the AHNAK5 peptide.

Phillips J.M. Shaw G.S. Protein Sci. 2009; 18: 2528-2536Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The A10A2 complex also offers the ability to examine the binding effects of AHNAK5 on annexin A2 using NMR titration experiments because it is also 15N-labeled in the A10A2 hybrid. As expected, the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of A10A2 (Fig. 2B) is very similar to that of the S100A10-annexin A2 complex (Fig. 2A), indicating that the structures and interactions between the S100A10 and N terminus of annexin A2 are similar in the two complexes (32Rezvanpour A. Phillips J.M. Shaw G.S. Protein Sci. 2009; 18: 2528-2536Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In addition, because the annexin A2 portion of A10A2 is also 15N-labeled, resonances from this segment of the hybrid protein (i.e. Leu112 and Gly114) are clearly visible in the spectrum. Similar to the S100A10-annexin A2 peptide complex, the addition of AHNAK5 to the 15N-labeled A10A2 protein led to the disappearance of peaks from S100A10 and the appearance of new resonances on the slow exchange time scale. Upon saturation, the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of 15N-labeled A10A2 bound to unlabeled AHNAK5 (Fig. 2B) bore a strong resemblance to that of 15N-labeled S100A10 in complex with both unlabeled annexin A2 and AHNAK5 peptides (Fig. 2A). This included an increased number of peaks in the A10A2 spectrum, where several resonances from the S100A10 protein appeared as pairs (Phe13, Ala50, Val66, Ala76, and Gly77). Interestingly, resonances from the annexin A2 portion of A10A2 also exhibited peak doubling upon the addition of AHNAK5 (Leu112 and Gly114), indicating that binding of AHNAK5 also affected the annexin A2 portion of the hybrid protein.The increased number of resonances and multiplicity of some peaks in both the S100A10-annexin A2 and A10A2 complexes with AHNAK5 are in contrast to 1H-15N HSQC spectra of all other S100-target peptide complexes, including calcium-bound S100B with CapZ, p53, or NDR kinase; S100A6 with Siah1-interacting protein; and S100A1 in complex with CapZ or ryanodine receptor (38Rustandi R.R.

NMR spectra from these complexes all display a similar number of resonances in the presence or absence of target, indicating that a symmetric relationship in the dimer is maintained. This is borne out in three-dimensional structures of the complexes. In order to account for the unique spectral observations made for the S100A10-annexin A2 complex with AHNAK5, several models were considered, including displacement of annexin A2 by AHNAK5, multiple orientations of AHNAK5 binding, and asymmetric binding of a single AHNAK5 peptide to the S100A10-annexin A2 complex.Asymmetric Binding of AHNAK to the A10A2 DimerTitrations of 15N-labeled S100A10 with AHNAK5 in the absence of annexin A2 peptide did not show an interaction between S100A10 and AHNAK5 and were prone to precipitation (data not shown). This result indicates that both S100A10 and annexin A2 are required for the recruitment of AHNAK5 to the ternary complex. Analysis of the NMR experiments using 15N-labeled A10A2 titrated with unlabeled AHNAK5 peptide were carried out to investigate the stoichiometry and affinity of the interaction. The change in the peak intensities of residues from a variety of locations in S100A10 and annexin A2 moieties (Gly40, Val51, and Gly77 in S100A10 and Leu112 in annexin A2) were plotted as a function of AHNAK5 and A10A2 concentrations (Fig. 3). The data show that all of the peaks have nearly linear decreases for their intensities in 15N-labeled A10A2 (Fig. 3A) and concomitant increases in the peak intensities in the AHNAK5 complex (Fig. 3B). The inflection point for the data sets occurs near a stoichiometry of one AHNAK5 peptide to one A10A2 dimer. Fitting for this interaction indicated a Kd of <1 μm, although a precise determination was not possible by this method due to the high A10A2 protein concentrations used in the NMR experiments. The data were also fit for the interaction of two AHNAK5 peptides per A10A2 dimer, similar to other S100-target peptide complexes that display symmetric binding (Fig. 3C). This resulted in obvious disagreement with the data, indicating the 2:1 AHNAK/A10A2 (dimer) model was incorrect.FIGURE 3Stoichiometry of the AHNAK5 peptide with A10A2 measured from 1H-15N HSQC experiments. Aliquots of the unlabeled AHNAK5 peptide were added to a solution of 143 μm 15N,13C-labeled A10A2 (dimer concentration), and the resulting changes in peak intensity were monitored. The binding between AHNAK5 and A10A2 is shown as the plot of decrease (A) and increase (B) in peak intensities for Gly40 (●), Val51 (♦), and Gly77 (▴) in S100A10 and Leu112 (▾) in annexin A2 as a function of the AHNAK5/A10A2 ratio. C, the normalized changes in peak intensities are shown as a function of AHNAK5 concentration. Data sets for Gly40 (●), Val51 (♦), Gly77 (▴), and Leu112 (▾) were globally fit for 1:1 (solid line) and 2:1 (dashed line) AHNAK5/A10A2 stoichiometries, indicating that the dissociation constant (Kd) was <1 μm.

Int. J. Mass Spectrom. 2000; 200: 175-186Crossref Scopus (436) Google Scholar). These data showed three major peaks in the spectrum corresponding to the A10A2 protomer (MWobs = 13,731.8, MWcalc = 13,733.8), A10A2 dimer (MWobs = 27,462.4, MWcalc = 27,467.6), and the A10A2 dimer in complex with a single AHNAK5 peptide (MWobs = 29,815.5, MWcalc = 29,820.4). There was no evidence for a peak at 32,173.2 in the spectrum that would be expected for the mass of the A10A2 dimer in complex with two AHNAK5 peptides. This result corroborates the NMR titration experiments that show that only one AHNAK5 peptide is bound to the A10A2 dimer. In separate experi"
https://openalex.org/W2088122627,"Secreted Protein Acidic and Rich in Cysteine (SPARC) is one of the major non-structural proteins of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in remodeling tissues. The functional significance of SPARC is emphasized by its origin in the first multicellular organisms and its high degree of evolutionary conservation. Although SPARC has been shown to act as a critical modulator of ECM remodeling with profound effects on tissue physiology and architecture, no plausible molecular mechanism of its action has been proposed. In the present study, we demonstrate that SPARC mediates the disassembly and degradation of ECM networks by functioning as a matricellular chaperone. While it has low affinity to its targets inside the cells where the Ca2+ concentrations are low, high extracellular concentrations of Ca2+ activate binding to multiple ECM proteins, including collagens. We demonstrated that in vitro, this leads to the inhibition of collagen I fibrillogenesis and disassembly of pre-formed collagen I fibrils by SPARC at high Ca2+ concentrations. In cell culture, exogenous SPARC was internalized by the fibroblast cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Pulse-chase assay further revealed that internalized SPARC is quickly released outside the cell, demonstrating that SPARC shuttles between the cell and ECM. Fluorescently labeled collagen I, fibronectin, vitronectin, and laminin were co-internalized with SPARC by fibroblasts, and semi-quantitative Western blot showed that SPARC mediates internalization of collagen I. Using a novel 3-dimentional model of fluorescent ECM networks pre-deposited by live fibroblasts, we demonstrated that degradation of ECM depends on the chaperone activity of SPARC. These results indicate that SPARC may represent a new class of scavenger chaperones, which mediate ECM degradation, remodeling and repair by disassembling ECM networks and shuttling ECM proteins into the cell. Further understanding of this mechanism may provide insight into the pathogenesis of matrix-associated disorders and lead to the novel treatment strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2006685024,"The perihydroxylated perylene quinone hypericin has been reported to possess potent anti-metastatic and antiangiogenic activities, generated by targeting diverse crossroads of cancer-promoting processes via unique mechanisms. Hypericin is the only known exogenous reagent that can induce forced poly-ubiquitination and accelerated degradation of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) in cancer cells. Hsp90 client proteins are thereby destabilized and rapidly degraded. Hsp70 client proteins may potentially be also affected via preventing formation of hsp90-hsp70 intermediate complexes. We show here that hypericin also induces enhanced degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) in two human tumor cell lines, U87-MG glioblastoma and RCC-C2VHL−/− renal cell carcinoma and in the non-malignant ARPE19 retinal pigment epithelial cell line. The hypericin-accelerated turnover of HIF-1α, the regulatory precursor of the HIF-1 transcription factor which promotes hypoxic stress and angiogenic responses, overcomes the physiologic HIF-1α protein stabilization which occurs in hypoxic cells. The hypericin effect also eliminates the high HIF-1α levels expressed constitutively in the von-Hippel Lindau protein (pVHL)-deficient RCC-C2VHL−/− renal cell carcinoma cell line. Unlike the normal ubiquitin-proteasome pathway-dependent turnover of HIF-α proteins which occurs in normoxia, the hypericin-induced HIF-1α catabolism can occur independently of cellular oxygen levels or pVHL-promoted ubiquitin ligation of HIF-1α. It is mediated by lysosomal cathepsin-B enzymes with cathepsin-B activity being optimized in the cells through hypericin-mediated reduction in intracellular pH. Our findings suggest that hypericin may potentially be useful in preventing growth of tumors in which HIF-1α plays pivotal roles, and in pVHL ablated tumor cells such as renal cell carcinoma through elimination of elevated HIF-1α contents in these cells, scaling down the excessive angiogenesis which characterizes these tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2124430600,"Coordination of apical constriction in epithelial sheets is a fundamental process during embryogenesis. Here, we show that DRhoGEF2 is a key regulator of apical pulsation and constriction of amnioserosal cells during Drosophila dorsal closure. Amnioserosal cells mutant for DRhoGEF2 exhibit a consistent decrease in amnioserosa pulsations whereas overexpression of DRhoGEF2 in this tissue leads to an increase in the contraction time of pulsations. We probed the physical properties of the amnioserosa to show that the average tension in DRhoGEF2 mutant cells is lower than wild-type and that overexpression of DRhoGEF2 results in a tissue that is more solid-like than wild-type. We also observe that in the DRhoGEF2 overexpressing cells there is a dramatic increase of apical actomyosin coalescence that can contribute to the generation of more contractile forces, leading to amnioserosal cells with smaller apical surface than wild-type. Conversely, in DRhoGEF2 mutants, the apical actomyosin coalescence is impaired. These results identify DRhoGEF2 as an upstream regulator of the actomyosin contractile machinery that drives amnioserosa cells pulsations and apical constriction."

During messenger (m)RNA export, Gle1 bound to inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) acts via Dbp5 to facilitate remodeling of mRNA-protein complexes. In contrast, here we define a novel Gle1 role in translation initiation through regulation of a different DEAD-box protein, the initiation factor Ded1. We find that Gle1 physically and genetically interacts with Ded1. Surprisingly, whereas Gle1 stimulates Dbp5, it inhibits Ded1 ATPase activity in vitro, and IP6 does not affect this inhibition. Functionally, a gle1–4 mutant specifically suppresses initiation defects in a ded1–120 mutant, and ded1 and gle1 mutants have complementary perturbations in AUG start site recognition. Consistent with this role in initiation, Gle1 inhibits translation in vitro in competent extracts. These results indicate that Gle1 has a direct role in initiation and negatively regulates Ded1.

In eukaryotic cells, nuclear export of messenger (m)RNA is required to link the transcription, processing, and translation mechanisms. Recent studies have revealed several independent mechanisms by which these steps can be functionally coupled to one another. On the one hand, factors can be co-transcriptionally recruited to the mRNA for subsequent action. For example, during transcription and splicing, mRNA export factors are incorporated in the maturing mRNA-protein complex (mRNP) 3The abbreviations used are: mRNPmRNA-protein complexDbpDEAD-box proteinNPCnuclear pore complexPICpreinitiation complexNTDN-terminal domain. to allow targeting to and translocation through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) (1Stewart M.

Remarkably, we also found that Gle1 plays a separate, uncharacterized role in translation initiation that is independent of both Dbp5 and IP6 (22Bolger T.A. Folkmann A.W. Tran E.J. Wente S.R. Cell. 2008; 134: 624-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Translation initiation, defined as the assembly of translation-competent ribosomes on mRNA, requires a number of steps. Preinitiation complex (PIC) formation by the eIFs, the 40 S ribosomal subunit, and the mRNA precedes scanning by the PIC for the AUG start codon in a 5′ to 3′ direction (23Kapp L.D. Lorsch J.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 657-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Once the PIC reaches an appropriate AUG, start site recognition takes place, resulting in a conformational change to a “closed,” scanning-incompetent form (for review, see Ref. 24Mitchell S.F. Lorsch J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 27345-27349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Dissociation of eIF1 then allows phosphate release by eIF2-GDP, committing the PIC to initiation at that site. Most of the eIFs dissociate, and eIF5B stimulates subunit joining, forming a competent 80 S ribosome. The mechanism of Gle1 function during initiation is unknown. Several members of the ubiquitous DEAD-box protein family have been implicated in translation initiation (25Jankowsky E. Gross C.H. Shuman S. Pyle A.M. Science. 2001; 291: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 26Linder P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4168-4180Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 27Linder P. Biol. Cell. 2003; 95: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Ded1, a conserved, essential DEAD-box protein, has been proposed to function by unwinding structured RNA in the 5′ untranslated region to facilitate start site scanning by the 43S PIC (for review see Ref. 28Tarn W.Y. Chang T.H. RNA Biol. 2009; 6: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In this regard, the Ded1 role is similar to that proposed for eIF4A, although some data suggest that Ded1 is the more critical factor for this activity (29Berthelot K. Muldoon M. Rajkowitsch L. Hughes J. McCarthy J.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 987-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 30Marsden S. Nardelli M. Linder P. McCarthy J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 361: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, the exact role of Ded1 in initiation has remained unclear, and no regulatory factors have been identified. In this study, we define a novel functional interaction between Gle1 and Ded1. We show that Gle1 negatively regulates Ded1 in an IP6-independent manner and that this modulation is crucial for proper translation initiation. Further, we present data suggesting that the two proteins may play roles in AUG start site recognition. By demonstrating that a single factor, Gle1, can differentially modulate the activity of more than one DEAD-box protein (Dbp5 and Ded1), this work reveals a potential new mechanism for coupling the function of multiple DEAD-box proteins during the life cycle of an mRNA. Yeast strains and plasmids used are listed in supplemental Tables S1 and S2. SWY4092 (ded1::KAN +pDED1) was constructed by integration of a Kanamycin resistance cassette at the DED1 locus in a W303 strain background. Double mutants were generated by crossing ded1::KAN +pDED1 to other mutant strains via standard methods. Mutant ded1–120, DED1-GFP, and control strains were generated by plasmid shuffle.

RNA was added to translation reactions at 0.9 ng/μl along with Gle1, gle1-VAI/DDD, or Dbp5, and samples were incubated for 45 min at 25 °C. Luciferase assays were performed as above to determine the extent of translation. Because Gle1 regulates a DEAD-box protein (Dbp5) in mRNA export and translation termination (8Alcázar-Román A.R. Tran E.J. Guo S. Wente S.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 711-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 9Weirich C.S. Erzberger J.P. Flick J.S. Berger J.M. Thorner J. Weis K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 668-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 22Bolger T.A. Folkmann A.W. Tran E.J. Wente S.R. Cell. 2008; 134: 624-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), we speculated that Gle1 might act with a different DEAD-box protein during translation initiation. To address this, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were conducted with yeast lysates from cells expressing either protein-A tagged (Gle1-ProtA) or untagged Gle1. Bound fractions were immunoblotted using a Ded1-specific antibody (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1A). Ded1 was only co-isolated with Gle1-ProtA (Fig. 1A, lane 3). To test for a direct Gle1:Ded1 physical interaction, in vitro soluble binding assays were conducted with purified recombinant His-tagged Ded1 and Gle1 (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 3). The His-tagged N-terminal domain (NTD) of Nup159 was used as a control (lane 2). His-Ded1 or His-NTD were incubated with purified Gle1 and bound to Ni-agarose. Bound fractions were eluted and evaluated by SDS-PAGE. Near-stoichiometric levels of Gle1 were isolated with His-Ded1 (lane 7), revealing a direct interaction. Minimal Gle1 binding was detected with His-NTD (lane 8) or with Ni-agarose alone (lane 6). The Gle1:Ded1 interaction was maintained after RNase treatment, indicating it is not mediated through potentially co-purified RNA contaminants (supplemental Fig. S1B). Thus, Gle1 interacts with Ded1 both in vivo and in vitro. In mRNA export, Gle1:IP6 stimulates the RNA-dependent ATPase activity of Dbp5 (8Alcázar-Román A.R. Tran E.J. Guo S. Wente S.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 711-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 9Weirich C.S. Erzberger J.P. Flick J.S. Berger J.M. Thorner J. Weis K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 668-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). To investigate whether Gle1 also alters Ded1 activity, ATPase assays were conducted with purified recombinant proteins at different molar ratios. As expected, we observed an RNA-dependent increase in the ATPase activity of Ded1 (Fig. 1, C and E). However, when Gle1 was added, Ded1 ATPase activity was reduced in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1C). This is in direct contrast to Gle1:IP6 activation of Dbp5 ATPase activity. Furthermore, addition of IP6 did not change Ded1 ATPase activity or the Gle1 inhibition (supplemental Fig. S2A). As a control, addition of glutathione S-transferase (GST) or an unrelated RNA-binding protein (Hrp1) had no effect (supplemental Fig. S2B). To examine the ATP and RNA dependence of Ded1 activity with Gle1, ATP, and RNA concentrations were varied in ATPase assays. In altering ATP concentration, the Vmax of Ded1 activity was reduced with Gle1 whereas the EC50 was not significantly altered (Fig. 1D). However, with Gle1, an ∼2-fold increase in total RNA concentration (from 0.4 to 0.8 μg/ml) was required for half-maximal Ded1 ATPase activity (Fig. 1E). Again, this was opposite of the Gle:IP6 effect on Dbp5 wherein ATPase activation is coincident with a decrease in the required RNA concentration (8Alcázar-Román A.R. Tran E.J. Guo S. Wente S.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 711-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 9Weirich C.S. Erzberger J.P. Flick J.S. Berger J.M. Thorner J. Weis K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 668-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The direct binding of Gle1 and inhibition of Ded1 ATPase activity revealed a potential direct role for Gle1 in translation initiation. We hypothesized that the Gle1:Ded1 interaction might be mediated in a manner similar to the Gle1:Dbp5 interaction. Extensive structural analysis of Dbp5 has been reported, and very recently an ADP-bound Δ90dbp5L327V:Δ243gle1H337R:IP6 complex was characterized (17Montpetit B. Thomsen N.D. Helmke K.J. Seeliger M.A. Berger J.M. Weis K. Nature. 2011; 472: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). To gain further insight into Gle1:Ded1 binding, we generated altered forms of Gle1 and Ded1 based on the Gle1-Dbp5 findings and assayed for effects on protein interaction and Ded1 activity. First, we utilized a Gle1 protein in which three residues (Val-513, Ala-516, and Ile-520) that are proposed to facilitate binding of the Dbp5 N-terminal RecA domain are changed to aspartic acid (17Montpetit B. Thomsen N.D. Helmke K.J. Seeliger M.A. Berger J.M. Weis K. Nature. 2011; 472: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The altered gle1-VAI/DDD protein still binds to Dbp5 but is defective in ATPase activation, and the corresponding yeast gle1-VAI/DDD mutant strain is inviable (17Montpetit B. Thomsen N.D. Helmke K.J. Seeliger M.A. Berger J.M. Weis K. Nature. 2011; 472: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). We performed in vitro pull-downs with His-Ded1 and gle1-VAI/DDD and found it bound at levels similar to wild-type Gle1 (Fig. 2A). This indicates that the gle1-VAI/DDD protein is not perturbed for interaction with either Dbp5 or Ded1. However, the gle1-VAI/DDD protein, despite binding to Ded1, was completely deficient in inhibiting the ATPase activity of Ded1 (Fig. 2B). This result is similar, though correspondingly opposite in effect, to ATPase assays performed with Dbp5 and gle1-VAI/DDD (17Montpetit B. Thomsen N.D. Helmke K.J. Seeliger M.A. Berger J.M. Weis K. Nature. 2011; 472: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Thus, gle1-VAI/DDD is defective for modulating both Dbp5 and Ded1, indicating a potential shared biochemical mechanism of action on the two different DEAD-box proteins. Second, a recent report discovered a DBP5 dominant negative mutant (DBP5-R369G), which generates a dbp5-R369G protein that is deficient in RNA binding and sequesters Gle1 (34Hodge C.A. Tran E.J. Noble K.N. Alcazar-Roman A.R. Ben-Yishay R. Scarcelli J.J. Folkmann A.W. Shav-Tal Y. Wente S.R. Cole C.N. Genes Dev. 2011; 25: 1052-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The dbp5-R369G protein, which has reduced ATPase activity compared with wild-type due to the lack of RNA binding, inhibits activation of wild-type Dbp5 in vitro by titering away Gle1:IP6 (34Hodge C.A. Tran E.J. Noble K.N. Alcazar-Roman A.R. Ben-Yishay R. Scarcelli J.J. Folkmann A.W. Shav-Tal Y. Wente S.R. Cole C.N. Genes Dev. 2011; 25: 1052-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). As the changed arginine-369 residue is conserved in multiple DEAD-box proteins (data not shown), we generated an equivalent DED1 mutant (DED1-R438G). We found that the altered ded1-R438G protein bound to Gle1 in pull-down assays (Fig. 2C). Similarly to dbp5-R369G, the ded1-R438G protein had little ATPase activity, and in fact no additive effect compared with wild-type Ded1 was seen when both proteins are added together (Fig. 2D). However, Gle1-mediated inhibition of Ded1 ATPase activity was significantly reversed by the addition of ded1-R438G protein, consistent with the ability of ded1-R438G to still bind Gle1. Thus, both the ded1-R438G and gle1-VAI/DDD proteins affected Ded1 ATPase activity in ways similar to their effects on Dbp5 activity, though reversed in orientation. Taken together, these biochemical data support direct inhibition of Ded1 by Gle1. Moreover, this indicates that Gle1 potentially binds Ded1 in a manner similar to its interaction with Dbp5. However, the interactions are not completely equivalent. We also generated a ded1 mutant (D392K) similar to a dbp5-E323K mutant that reportedly ablates Gle1 binding and activation (35Dossani Z.Y. Weirich C.S. Erzberger J.P. Berger J.M. Weis K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 16251-16256Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The ded1-D392K protein bound Gle1, and its activity in the presence of Gle1 was not significantly different from wild-type Ded1 (data not shown). Furthermore, a ded1-D392K mutant strain also had no observable growth phenotypes (data not shown). Overall, Ded1:Gle1 has both shared and distinct mechanistic determinants compared with Dbp5:Gle1:IP6. Next we evaluated the in vivo significance of Ded1 regulation by Gle1. A double mutant strain harboring the temperature-sensitive gle1–4 allele and the cold-sensitive ded1–120 allele was generated and tested for growth at different temperatures (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, the growth defect of the gle1–4 mutant at 30 °C was suppressed in the gle1–4 ded1–120 double mutant strain. This genetic suppression of the growth defect is consistent with the negative biochemical regulation of Ded1 by Gle1 and suggests that Gle1 and Ded1 have opposing actions in vivo. No significant synthetic growth suppression or synthetic lethal effects were observed at other temperatures tested. The lack of suppression of the ded1–120 growth defect at 25 °C and the lack of suppression of the gle1–4 growth defect at 37 °C likely reflect differences in the severity of their defects at different temperatures. In addition, Ded1 and Gle1 each play roles in more than one process and the suppression effect might be linked to only one of these functions (see below) (22Bolger T.A. Folkmann A.W. Tran E.J. Wente S.R. Cell. 2008; 134: 624-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We did not test the gle1-VAI/DDD mutant because it is lethal at all temperatures in vivo and is defective in regulating both Ded1 and Dbp5 (Fig. 2B and Ref. 17Montpetit B. Thomsen N.D. Helmke K.J. Seeliger M.A. Berger J.M. Weis K. Nature. 2011; 472: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In parallel, ipk1Δ and rat7-1 (nup159) mutants were tested as controls. Ipk1 is the 2-kinase responsible for IP6 production (32York J.D. Odom A.R. Murphy R. Ives E.B. Wente S.R.

https://openalex.org/W1980122996,"During embryonic vasculogenesis, endothelial precursor cells of mesodermal origin known as angioblasts assemble into a characteristic network pattern. Although a considerable amount of markers and signals involved in this process have been identified, the mechanisms underlying the coalescence of angioblasts into this reticular pattern remain unclear. Various recent studies hypothesize that autocrine regulation of the chemoattractant vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is responsible for the formation of vascular networks in vitro. However, the autocrine regulation hypothesis does not fit well with reported data on in vivo early vascular development. In this study, we propose a mathematical model based on the alternative assumption that endodermal VEGF signalling activity, having a paracrine effect on adjacent angioblasts, is mediated by its binding to the extracellular matrix (ECM). Detailed morphometric analysis of simulated networks and images obtained from in vivo quail embryos reveals the model mimics the vascular patterns with high accuracy. These results show that paracrine signalling can result in the formation of fine-grained cellular networks when mediated by angioblast-produced ECM. This lends additional support to the theory that patterning during early vascular development in the vertebrate embryo is regulated by paracrine signalling."
https://openalex.org/W2083019028,"Somatic mutations or reduced expression of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor occurs in the majority of the clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and is a causal factor for the pathogenesis of ccRCC. pVHL was reported to suppress the oncogenic activity of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) by reducing the expression of the EGFR agonist TGF-α and by reducing the translation efficiency of EGFR itself. Furthermore, it was reported that pVHL down-regulates activated EGFR by promoting efficient lysosomal degradation of the receptor. These modes of negative regulation of EGFR by pVHL were dependent on Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF). In this study, we report that HIF was not the only factor stabilizing the activated EGFR in VHL-deficient ccRCC cells. Down-regulation of endogenous HIF in these cells had little effect on the turnover rates of the activated EGFR. Furthermore, neither pretreatment with lysosomal inhibitors pretreatment nor down-regulation of c-Cbl, a major E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets the activated EGFR for lysosomal degradation, significantly increased the stabilities of EGFR in VHL-expressing ccRCC cells. In contrast, pretreatment with proteasomal inhibitors extended EGFR lifetime and led to similar EGFR half-lives in VHL-expressing and VHL-deficient ccRCC cells. Down-regulation of c-Cbl in VHL-deficient ccRCC cells revealed that the c-Cbl and pVHL collaborated to down-regulate the activated EGFR. Finally, we found that pVHL promoted the poly-ubiquitylation of the activated EGFR, and this function was c-Cbl-independent. Thus these results indicate that pVHL limits EGFR signaling by promoting c-Cbl-independent poly-ubiquitylation of the activated receptor, which likely results in its degradation by proteasome."

https://openalex.org/W2044802039,"Syntenin-1 is a PDZ domain-containing adaptor that controls trafficking of transmembrane proteins including those associated with tetraspanin-enriched microdomains. We describe the interaction of syntenin-1 with ubiquitin through a novel binding site spanning the C terminus of ubiquitin, centered on Arg(72), Leu(73), and Arg(74). A conserved LYPSL sequence in the N terminus, as well as the C-terminal region of syntenin-1, are essential for binding to ubiquitin. We present evidence for the regulation of this interaction through syntenin-1 dimerization. We have also established that syntenin-1 is phosphorylated downstream of Ulk1, a serine/threonine kinase that plays a critical role in autophagy and regulates endocytic trafficking. Importantly, Ulk1-dependent phosphorylation of Ser(6) in the LYPSL prevents the interaction of syntenin-1 with ubiquitin. These results define an unprecedented ubiquitin-dependent pathway involving syntenin-1 that is regulated by Ulk1."
https://openalex.org/W2086150909,"During embryonic development, there are numerous cases where organ or tissue formation depends upon the migration of primordial cells. In the Drosophila embryo, the visceral mesoderm (vm) acts as a substrate for the migration of several cell populations of epithelial origin, including the endoderm, the trachea and the salivary glands. These migratory processes require both integrins and laminins. The current model is that αPS1βPS (PS1) and/or αPS3βPS (PS3) integrins are required in migrating cells, whereas αPS2βPS (PS2) integrin is required in the vm, where it performs an as yet unidentified function. Here, we show that PS1 integrins are also required for the migration over the vm of cells of mesodermal origin, the caudal visceral mesoderm (CVM). These results support a model in which PS1 might have evolved to acquire the migratory function of integrins, irrespective of the origin of the tissue. This integrin function is highly specific and its specificity resides mainly in the extracellular domain. In addition, we have identified the Laminin α1,2 trimer, as the key extracellular matrix (ECM) component regulating CVM migration. Furthermore, we show that, as it is the case in vertebrates, integrins, and specifically PS2, contributes to CVM movement by participating in the correct assembly of the ECM that serves as tracks for migration."
https://openalex.org/W2169691907,"ADAM17 is a membrane-associated metalloprotease that cleaves proteins from the surface of neutrophils and modulates the density of various receptors and adhesion molecules. The protease activity of ADAM17 is highly inducible and occurs upon neutrophil activation as well as apoptosis. At this time, little is known about the signal transduction pathway that promotes ADAM17 activity in neutrophils upon the induction of apoptosis. We show that caspase-8 activation, Bid cleavage, and the release of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species are sequential transduction components of the Fas signaling cascade that induces ADAM17. This is different from ADAM17 stimulation upon overt neutrophil activation, which requires MAPK p38 or ERK, but not caspases and reactive oxygen species. ADAM17 activity in apoptotic neutrophils may serve to inactivate select effector molecules that promote the pro-inflammatory activity of recruited neutrophils. For instance, TNFα receptors TNF-RI and TNF-RII are substrates of ADAM17, and we show that they are shed during apoptosis, decreasing neutrophil sensitivity to TNFα. Altogether, our findings provide significant new insights into the signal transduction pathway that stimulates ADAM17 during induced neutrophil apoptosis. ADAM17 induction during apoptosis may rapidly diminish neutrophil sensitivity to the inflammatory environment, complementing other anti-inflammatory activities by these cells during inflammation resolution."
https://openalex.org/W2003513863,"Developmental stress, and individual variation in response to it, can have important fitness consequences. Here we investigated the consequences of variable dietary protein on the duration of growth and associative learning abilities of zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, which are obligate graminivores. The high-protein conditions that zebra finches would experience in nature when half-ripe seed is available were mimicked by the use of egg protein to supplement mature seed, which is low in protein content. Growth rates and relative body proportions of males reared either on a low-protein diet (mature seed only) or a high-protein diet (seed plus egg) were determined from body size traits (mass, head width, and tarsus) measured at three developmental stages. Birds reared on the high-protein diet were larger in all size traits at all ages, but growth rates of size traits showed no treatment effects. Relative head size of birds reared on the two diets differed from age day 95 onward, with high-diet birds having larger heads in proportion to both tarsus length and body mass. High-diet birds mastered an associative learning task in fewer bouts than those reared on the low-protein diet. In both diet treatments, amount of sub-adult head growth varied directly, and sub-adult mass change varied inversely, with performance on the learning task. Results indicate that small differences in head growth during the sub-adult period can be associated with substantial differences in adult cognitive performance. Contrary to a previous report, we found no evidence for growth compensation among birds on the low-protein diet. These results have implications for the study of vertebrate cognition, developmental stress, and growth compensation."
https://openalex.org/W2022725837,"The mechanism of fibronectin (FN) assembly and the self-association sites are still unclear and contradictory, although the N-terminal 70-kDa region (I1–9) is commonly accepted as one of the assembly sites. We previously found that I1–9 binds to superfibronectin, which is an artificial FN aggregate induced by anastellin. In the present study, we found that I1–9 bound to the aggregate formed by anastellin and a small FN fragment, III1–2. An engineered disulfide bond in III2, which stabilizes folding, inhibited aggregation, but a disulfide bond in III1 did not. A gelatin precipitation assay showed that I1–9 did not interact with anastellin, III1, III2, III1–2, or several III1–2 mutants including III1–2KADA. (In contrast to previous studies, we found that the III1–2KADA mutant was identical in conformation to wild-type III1–2.) Because I1–9 only bound to the aggregate and the unfolding of III2 played a role in aggregation, we generated a III2 domain that was destabilized by deletion of the G strand. This mutant bound I1–9 as shown by the gelatin precipitation assay and fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis, and it inhibited FN matrix assembly when added to cell culture. Next, we introduced disulfide mutations into full-length FN. Three disulfide locks in III2, III3, and III11 were required to dramatically reduce anastellin-induced aggregation. When we tested the disulfide mutants in cell culture, only the disulfide bond in III2 reduced the FN matrix.

Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1463-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). III7–10 and the variable domain seem to play roles as integrin binding sites. III4–5, III12–14, and I10–12 have contradictory reports (24Ohashi T. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39143-39151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 26Sechler J.L. Rao H. Cumiskey A.M. Vega-Colón I. Smith M.S. Murata T. Schwarzbauer J.E. J.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1641-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), so they may only be required for particular cell types or under some conditions. On the other hand, many studies consistently show that I1–9 is crucial for FN matrix assembly. More precisely, I1–5 appears to be important because an antibody against this region inhibited FN matrix assembly (23Wu C. Keightley S.Y. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Radeva G. Coppolino M. Goicoechea S. McDonald J.A. Dedhar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 528-536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), and mutants in which this region was deleted did not form the FN matrix (20Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1463-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In addition to I1–9, many studies indicate that III1 and/or III2 are important for FN matrix assembly. An antibody that recognized III1 was able to inhibit FN matrix formation (25Chernousov M.A. Fogerty F.J. Koteliansky V.E. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10851-10858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Solid phase binding assays showed that III1–2 and III2 (without the linker between III1 and III2), when adsorbed to plastic, interacted with full-length FN and I1–9 (26Sechler J.L. Rao H.

Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 1081-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) showed that FN deletion mutants lacking III2 had significantly decreased matrix assembly. A recent NMR study showed a unique structure for the domain pair III1–2 (32Vakonakis I. Staunton D. Rooney L.M. Campbell I.D. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2575-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It had been recognized from sequence analysis that there is an 18-amino acid linker between these domains. The NMR structure showed that the A strand of III2 was disordered, giving a total length of ∼35 amino acids for the linker, and further indicated that III1 and III2 formed a closed compact structure, with a potential salt bridge between Lys-669 in III1 and Asp-767 in III2. These two amino acids were mutated to alanine, giving the mutant designated KADA. The native III1–2 was found not to bind I1–5, but the KADA mutation was reported to dramatically enhance binding of I1–5, as measured by surface plasmon resonance. The authors proposed that III1–2 had a cryptic high affinity binding site for I1–5, which could be exposed when the KADA mutations disrupted the binding of III1 to III2. Another study used fluorescent protein (FP)-based FRET to explore the conformation of III1–2 (33Karuri N.W. Lin Z. Rye H.S. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 3445-3452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It was reported elsewhere that a construct with two FNIII domains (III7–8) inserted between YFP and CFP showed a negligible FRET signal (34Ohashi T. Galiacy S.D. Briscoe G. Erickson H.P. Protein Sci. 2007; 16: 1429-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In contrast, when III1–2 was inserted between the FPs, there was a significant FRET signal, consistent with the model that the two domains folded back over the flexible linker and made contact, bringing the N and C termini close together (33Karuri N.W. Lin Z. Rye H.S. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 3445-3452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, however, in that study the KADA mutations increased the FRET signal rather than decreasing it. The addition of I1–9 reduced the FRET signal of the KADA mutant and had no effect on the FRET of wild type. These authors also suggested a cryptic binding site for I1–9 in III1–2, which was exposed in the KADA mutant. In contrast to many protein polymers, which can self-assemble in vitro, FN matrix cannot be reconstructed in a test tube. However, there are several approaches to make artificial FN aggregates that resemble the matrix. One of the methods uses anastellin, a truncated form of the first FNIII domain, lacking the A and B β strands (35Morla A. Zhang Z. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1994; 367: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 36Briknarová K. Akerman M.E. Hoyt D.W. Ruoslahti E. Ely K.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Anastellin binds FN to form a large aggregate, called superFN, which has FN matrix-like fibrillar structures when observed by light microscopy. Our previous studies indicated that the opening or unfolding of FNIII domains is important for anastellin binding and aggregation (24Ohashi T. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39143-39151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 37Ohashi T. Augustus A.M. Erickson H.P. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 4189-4197Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We also found that the N-terminal FN fragment, I1–9, which prevented FN matrix formation in cell culture, did not inhibit superFN aggregation. Instead, I1–9 co-precipitated with the aggregate (24Ohashi T. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39143-39151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In the present study, we further investigated the mechanism of superFN aggregation and FN matrix assembly, by introducing disulfide bonds that prevented opening of the targeted FNIII domains. The cDNA fragments of III1–2, III1–2(4aa) (which has a four-amino acid extension at the C terminus), III1–2ΔL (a 14-amino acid deletion in the linker), III2, LIII2 (with the linker), III2ΔA (the A strand deletion), and III2ΔG (the G strand deletion) were amplified by PCR using III1–5 (24Ohashi T. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39143-39151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) as a template and were cloned into the pET15b expression vector (Novagen), which added an N-terminal His tag. The additional N-terminal sequence is MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHM. Fragments III1 (SGPV … FTTT), III1–2 (SGPV … SQTT), III1–2(4aa) (SGPV … SQTTAPDA), III1–2ΔL (SGPV … SQTT without PVTSNTVTGETTPF), LIII2 (TTST … APDA), III2 (SPLV … SQTT), III2ΔA (TASS … SQTT), III2ΔG (SPLV … GEQS), and III11 (EIDK … TAVT) were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) at 37 °C and were purified with a cobalt column (TALON; Clontech) using standard procedures. Proteins were eluted with imidazole from the column and were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris with 150 mm NaCl (TBS, pH 8.0) or PBS (pH 7.2). Most of the proteins were obtained from the soluble portion of the bacterial lysate except for III2ΔG, which required denaturation and renaturation, using the procedure we reported previously for anastellin (24Ohashi T. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39143-39151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Previously generated III1L and anastellin were also used in this study (24Ohashi T. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39143-39151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Disulfide mutations in III1SS (S625C and K669C), III2SS (S735C and P778C), and III11SS (S1648C and E1691C) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis with Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene), like III3SS engineered previously (37Ohashi T. Augustus A.M. Erickson H.P. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 4189-4197Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These cysteines are in equivalent positions in each of the domains as shown in Fig. 1. We also created III1–2KADA (K669A and D767A), III1SS-2, and III1–2SS mutants by mutagenesis. The KADA mutations were verified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry in addition to DNA sequencing. The amino acid numbering used here follows that of recent publications (32Vakonakis I. Staunton D. Rooney L.M. Campbell I.D. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2575-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 33Karuri N.W. Lin Z. Rye H.S. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Biol.

In addition to the FN fragments, we made the functional upstream domain (FUD; from Streptococcus pyogenes) construct. The original FUD construct (38Tomasini-Johansson B.R. Kaufman N.R. Ensenberger M.G. Ozeri V. Hanski E. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23430-23439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Drs. Bianca Tomasini-Johansson and Deane Mosher at the University of Wisconsin. Because FUD is a small peptide of 49 amino acids, even with a His tag it was difficult to see in SDS-PAGE at low concentrations. Therefore, we fused FUD to maltose-binding protein (MBP) for visualization. The cDNA fragment of FUD was amplified by PCR using the original construct as a template and was cloned into the author-made MBP expression vector, in which MBP was inserted into the pET24b vector (Novagen). The sequence of the MBP construct is MKIE … (MBP) … ITKaaaLEHHHHHH (the MBP sequence is underlined). The sequence of the MBP-FUD construct is MKIE … (MBP) … ITKaaaKDQS … (FUD) … TEDTaaaLEHHHHHH. These constructs were expressed and purified with standard procedures the same as most of the FN fragments mentioned above. The concentrations of purified proteins were determined from their absorbance at 280 nm using the extinction coefficient of each protein calculated by the Protean computer program (DNAstar Inc.). 5,5′-Dithio-bis (2-nitrobenzoic acid) was used to confirm disulfide bond formation under denaturing conditions (37Ohashi T.

Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21618) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed with standard procedures. We also created FP-based FRET constructs in which PCR-amplified III1–2, III1–2KADA, III2 and III2ΔG were cloned into the SpeI and KpnI sites between mYPet and mECFP*. Each FP has a monomeric mutation, A206K (34Ohashi T. Galiacy S.D. Briscoe G. Erickson H.P. Protein Sci. 2007; 16: 1429-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar).

These FRET constructs were expressed in E. coli C41 (DE3) at room temperature and purified as described above. The concentrations of the FRET constructs were estimated from the absorbance at 433 nm using the extinction coefficient of mECFP* (23,500 m−1 cm−1). For transient mammalian cell expression, the cDNA fragments of I1–9 (QAQQ … TTSS) and I1–5 (QAQQ … YPSS) were amplified by PCR with FN-YPet/Neo (18Ohashi T. Erickson H.P. Matrix Biol. 2009; 28: 170-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) as a template and were cloned into the pHLSec2 vector, which was slightly modified from the original pHLSec vector (40Aricescu A.R. Lu W. Jones E.Y. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 1243-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar) by Dan Leahy (Johns Hopkins University). This vector has an engineered signal sequence, which gives an additional three amino acids (EGS) at the N terminus of the secreted protein and also adds a C-terminal His tag (EFHHHHHHHH). FN-YPet (QAQQ … DSRE, where monomeric YPet is inserted between III6 and III7) was also cloned into the pHLSec2 vector without adding the C-terminal His tag. The full-length FN disulfide mutants, FN2SS, FN3SS, FN3–11SS, and FN2–3-11SS, were generated by site-directed mutagenesis of FN-YPet. Purified expression vectors were transfected into HEK293T cells with polyethylenimine (25-kDa branched; Aldrich) as reported previously (40Aricescu A.R. Lu W. Jones E.Y. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 1243-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). To avoid exogenous FN contamination from serum, the serum-free medium Hybridoma SFM (Invitrogen) was used for transfection and expression. HEK293T produces a negligible amount of endogenous FN. The conditioned medium was collected after 4–6 days of transfection. I1–9 and I1–5 were purified with a cobalt column using imidazole, whereas FN-YPet and the disulfide mutants were purified with a gelatin column using 4 m urea for elution. To exchange the buffer, purified proteins were run through a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences), which was equilibrated with TBS or PBS. We also tried to express I6–9, but it suffered from proteolysis during expression. Because I1–9 and I6–9 were expressed in the same system, a protease-sensitive site in I6–9 is probably protected in I1–9. Therefore, I6–9 was generated from purified I1–9 by plasmin digestion. Plasmin cleaves at the C terminus of arginine 259, which is located between domains I5 and I6 (2Petersen T.E. Th⊘gersen H.C. Skorstengaard K. Vibe-Pedersen K. Sahl P. Sottrup-Jensen L. Magnusson S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1983; 80: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). 5 μm I1–9 was digested with 10 μg/ml plasmin at room temperature overnight. The digestion was quenched with 2 mm PMSF, and then I6–9 was purified by passage over the cobalt column as described above. The proteins of interest were mixed in a final volume of 25 μl with TBS or PBS containing 5 mm EDTA and incubated at room temperature for ∼16 h. After incubation, the samples were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were collected. The pellets were rinsed with 100 μl of TBS or PBS and resuspended with SDS-PAGE loading buffer. SDS-PAGE (15%) was performed using standard procedures. Fluorescence measurements were performed with a Shimadzu RF-5301-PC spectrofluorometer (37Ohashi T. Augustus A.M. Erickson H.P. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 4189-4197Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). For intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence measurements, 1 μm purified single FNIII domains in PBS were excited at 280 nm in the presence of 0–8 m urea, and emission spectra were recorded at 1-nm intervals from 300 to 400 nm with slit widths of 3 nm for excitation and 5 nm for emission. These measurements were carried out with triplicate samples at room temperature. For 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonate (ANS) fluorescence measurements, samples that contained 50 μm ANS and combinations of 10 μm anastellin and 10 μm FNIII domains or the disulfide mutants were excited at 360 nm, and emission spectra were recorded at 1-nm intervals from 370 to 620 nm using slit widths of 5 nm for both excitation and emission. The measurements for the disulfide mutants were performed with or without 1 mm DTT. For FRET measurements, 1 μm samples were excited at 433 nm, and emission spectra were recorded at 1-nm intervals from 440 to 620 nm using slit widths of 3 nm for both excitation and emission. These measurements were done with quadruplicate samples at room temperature. Trypsin (10 μg/ml) digestion and I1–9 (2 μm) incubation were carried out for 1 h before measurements were made. The proteins of interests were mixed in a final volume of 200 μl of PBS containing 5 mm EDTA and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. 30 μl of gelatin-agarose (Sigma) was added and incubated for an additional hour at room temperature. After incubation, the samples were centrifuged at 300 rpm for 1 min, and the supernatants were removed. The agarose beads were washed with 1 ml of PBS five times. The bound components were eluted from the beads with 30 μl of 8 m urea/PBS. We used glycerol gradient sedimentation to estimate the sedimentation coefficients. Wild-type III1–2 and III1–2KADA were sedimented on a 15–40% glycerol gradient in 0.2 m ammonium bicarbonate at 50,000 rpm for 16 h with a Beckman SW 55.1 rotor. Aldolase (7.3 S), BSA (4.6 S), ovalbumin (3.5 S), and cytochrome c (1.7 S) were used to calibrate the glycerol gradients. The Stokes radii (Rs) of III1–2 and III1–2KADA were estimated by gel filtration on a Sephacryl S-100 column (GE Healthcare) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. PBS was used for elution. The column was calibrated with BSA (Rs = 3.55 nm), ovalbumin (3.05 nm), and cytochrome c (1.41 nm). The FN(−/−) cell line 5F was kindly provided by Deane Mosher (University of Wisconsin). These cells were maintained with DMEM containing 10% FCS (Sigma). The cells were harvested with 0.05% trypsin, 2 mm EDTA (Invitrogen), after which 2 mm PMSF was added to quench the trypsin. The cells were rinsed with DMEM and resuspended with DMEM containing 1% FCS, which was depleted of FN by passage through a gelatin column. Cell suspensions (0.4 ml; 5 × 105 cells/ml) containing 30 nm FN-YPet with various FN fragments or FN2SS, FN3–11SS, or FN2–3-11SS were plated into a 24-well culture plate. The concentrations of FN-YPet and disulfide mutants were estimated from the absorbance at 514 nm with the molar extinction coefficient of monomeric YPet, 85,000 m−1 cm−1 (34Ohashi T. Galiacy S.D. Briscoe G. Erickson H.P. Protein Sci. 2007; 16: 1429-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). 12-mm circular coverglasses were added to several wells for microscopy. After the cells were cultured for ∼16 h, each well was rinsed three times with 0.5 ml of PBS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+ and then treated with 0.1 ml of trypsin (10 μg/ml) in PBS containing 5 mm EDTA for 30 min at room temperature. Trypsin digestion was quenched with 2 mm PMSF, and samples were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min to remove the cells. This solubilized most of the matrix, as indicated by the loss of almost all fluorescence in the light microscope. Total matrix FN-YPet was then determined from fluorescence of the supernatant. Samples were excited at 514 nm, and emission spectra were recorded at 528 nm using slit widths of 3 nm for excitation and 5 nm for emission. These measurements were carried out with quadruplicate samples at room temperature. Note that mild trypsin digestion does not affect YPet fluorescence (34Ohashi T. Galiacy S.D. Briscoe G. Erickson H.P. Protein Sci. 2007; 16: 1429-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). For microscopy, the samples were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS, washed, and mounted on slides. The samples were observed with a light microscope (Zeiss Axiophot), and the images were captured with a cooled charge-coupled device camera (CoolSNAPHQ; Roper Scientific). The recombinant proteins used in this study are diagrammed in Fig. 1. We have previously shown that a disulfide bond introduced into III3, locking the B strand to the E strand, inhibited anastellin binding (37Ohashi T. Augustus A.M. Erickson H.P. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 4189-4197Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Here we have introduced the equivalent disulfide bond into domains III1, III2 (Fig. 1), and III11. We have also previously shown that the whole FN molecule is not needed for superFN formation; a small FN fragment, III1–2, forms a superFN-like aggregate when mixed with anastellin (24Ohashi T.

https://openalex.org/W2028059958,"The topologically similar βγ-crystallins that are prevalent in all kingdoms of life have evolved for high innate domain stability to perform their specialized functions. The evolution of stability and its control in βγ-crystallins that possess either a canonical (mostly from microorganisms) or degenerate (principally found in vertebrate homologues) Ca2+-binding motif is not known. Using equilibrium unfolding of βγ-crystallin domains (26 wild-type domains and their mutants) in apo- and holo-forms, we demonstrate the presence of a stability gradient across these members, which is attained by the choice of residues in the (N/D)(N/D)XX(S/T)S Ca2+-binding motif. The occurrence of a polar, hydrophobic, or Ser residue at the 1st, 3rd, or 5th position of the motif is likely linked to a higher domain stability. Partial conversion of a microbe-type domain (with a canonical Ca2+-binding motif) to a vertebrate-type domain (with a degenerate Ca2+-binding motif) by mutating serine to arginine/lysine disables the Ca2+-binding but significantly augments its stability. Conversely, stability is compromised when arginine (in a vertebrate-type disabled domain) is replaced by serine (as a microbe type). Our results suggest that such conversions were acquired as a strategy for desired stability in vertebrate members at the cost of Ca2+-binding. In a physiological context, we demonstrate that a mutation such as an arginine to serine (R77S) mutation in this motif of γ-crystallin (partial conversion to microbe-type), implicated in cataracts, decreases the domain stability. Thus, this motif acts as a ""central tuning knob"" for innate as well as Ca2+-induced gain in stability, incorporating a stability gradient across βγ-crystallin members critical for their specialized functions."
https://openalex.org/W2052939347,"The prenatal period of germ cell development is a key time of epigenetic programming in the male, a window of development that has been shown to be influenced by maternal factors such as dietary methyl donor supply. DNA methylation occurring outside of promoter regions differs significantly between sperm and somatic tissues and has recently been linked with the regulation of gene expression during development as well as successful germline development. We examined DNA methylation at nonpromoter, intergenic sequences in purified prenatal and postnatal germ cells isolated from wildtype mice and mice deficient in the DNA methyltransferase cofactor DNMT3L. Erasure of the parental DNA methylation pattern occurred by 13.5 days post coitum (dpc) with the exception of approximately 8% of loci demonstrating incomplete erasure. For most loci, DNA methylation acquisition occurred between embryonic day 13.5 to 16.5 indicating that the key phase of epigenetic pattern establishment for intergenic sequences in male germ cells occurs prior to birth. In DNMT3L-deficient germ cells at 16.5 dpc, average DNA methylation levels were low, about 30% of wildtype levels; however, by postnatal day 6, about half of the DNMT3L deficiency-specific hypomethylated loci had acquired normal methylation levels. Those loci normally methylated earliest in the prenatal period were the least affected in the DNMT3L-deficient mice, suggesting that some loci may be more susceptible than others to perturbations occurring prenatally. These results indicate that the critical period of DNA methylation programming of nonpromoter, intergenic sequences occurs in male germline progenitor cells in the prenatal period, a time when external perturbations of epigenetic patterns could result in diminished fertility."
https://openalex.org/W2075778187,"Mutations in the p21-activated kinase 3 gene (pak3) are responsible for nonsyndromic forms of mental retardation. Expression of mutated PAK3 proteins in hippocampal neurons induces abnormal dendritic spine morphology and long term potentiation anomalies, whereas pak3 gene invalidation leads to cognitive impairments. How PAK3 regulates synaptic plasticity is still largely unknown. To better understand how PAK3 affects neuronal synaptic plasticity, we focused on its interaction with the Nck adaptors that play a crucial role in PAK signaling. We report here that PAK3 interacts preferentially with Nck2/Grb4 in brain extracts and in transfected cells. This interaction is independent of PAK3 kinase activity. Selective uncoupling of the Nck2 interactions in acute cortical slices using an interfering peptide leads to a rapid increase in evoked transmission to pyramidal neurons. The P12A mutation in the PAK3 protein strongly decreases the interaction with Nck2 but only slightly with Nck1. In transfected hippocampal cultures, expression of the P12A-mutated protein has no effect on spine morphogenesis or synaptic density. The PAK3-P12A mutant does not affect synaptic transmission, whereas the expression of the wild-type PAK3 protein decreases the amplitude of spontaneous miniature excitatory currents. Altogether, these data show that PAK3 down-regulates synaptic transmission through its interaction with Nck2."
https://openalex.org/W2094374318,"Enterotoxigenic F4-fimbriated Escherichia coli is associated with diarrheal disease in neonatal and postweaning pigs. The F4 fimbriae mediate attachment of the bacteria to the pig intestinal epithelium, enabling an efficient delivery of diarrhea-inducing enterotoxins to the target epithelial cells. There are three variants of F4 fimbriae designated F4ab, F4ac and F4ad, respectively, having different antigenic and adhesive properties. In the present study, the binding of isolated F4ab, F4ac and F4ad fimbriae, and F4ab/ac/ad-fimbriated E. coli, to glycosphingolipids from erythrocytes and from porcine small intestinal epithelium was examined, in order to get a comprehensive view of the F4-binding glycosphingolipids involved in F4-mediated hemagglutination and adhesion to the epithelial cells of porcine intestine. Specific interactions between the F4ab, F4ac and F4ad fimbriae and both acid and non-acid glycosphingolipids were obtained, and after isolation of binding-active glycosphingolipids and characterization by mass spectrometry and proton NMR, distinct carbohydrate binding patterns were defined for each fimbrial subtype. Two novel glycosphingolipids were isolated from chicken erythrocytes, and characterized as GalNAcα3GalNAcß3Galß4Glcß1Cer and GalNAcα3GalNAcß3Galß4GlcNAcß3Galß4Glcß1Cer. These two compounds, and lactosylceramide (Galß4Glcß1Cer) with phytosphingosine and hydroxy fatty acid, were recognized by all three variants of F4 fimbriae. No binding of the F4ad fimbriae or F4ad-fimbriated E. coli to the porcine intestinal glycosphingolipids occurred. However, for F4ab and F4ac two distinct binding patterns were observed. The F4ac fimbriae and the F4ac-expressing E. coli selectively bound to galactosylceramide (Galß1Cer) with sphingosine and hydroxy 24:0 fatty acid, while the porcine intestinal glycosphingolipids recognized by F4ab fimbriae and the F4ab-fimbriated bacteria were characterized as galactosylceramide, sulfatide (SO3-3Galß1Cer), sulf-lactosylceramide (SO3-3Galß4Glcß1Cer), and globotriaosylceramide (Galα4Galß4Glcß1Cer) with phytosphingosine and hydroxy 24:0 fatty acid. Finally, the F4ad fimbriae and the F4ad-fimbriated E. coli, but not the F4ab or F4ac subtypes, bound to reference gangliotriaosylceramide (GalNAcß4Galß4Glcß1Cer), gangliotetraosylceramide (Galß3GalNAcß4Galß4Glcß1Cer), isoglobotriaosylceramide (Galα3Galß4Glcß1Cer), and neolactotetraosylceramide (Galß4GlcNAcß3Galß4Glcß1Cer)."
https://openalex.org/W1972121660,"Although the main role of P-glycoprotein (Pgp) is to extrude a broad range of xenochemicals and to protect the organism against xenotoxicity, it also transports a large range of endogenous lipids. Using mice lacking Pgp, we have investigated the possible involvement of Pgp in lipid homeostasis in vivo. In a long term study, we have followed the food intake, body status and lipid markers in plasma and liver of wild-type and mdr1ab-/- mice over 35 weeks. Pgp-deficient mice showed excess weight, hypertrophy of adipose mass, high insulin and glucose levels in plasma. Some of these metabolic disruptions appeared earlier in Pgp-deficient mice fed high-fat diet. Moreover, hepatosteatosis with increased expression of genes involved in liver detoxification and in de novo lipid synthesis occurred in Pgp-deficient mice. Overall, Pgp deficiency clearly induced obesity in FVB genetic background, which is known to be resistant to diet-induced obesity. These data reinforce the finding that Pgp gene could be a contributing factor and possibly a relevant marker for lipid disorder and obesity. Subsequent to Pgp deficiency, changes in body availabilities of lipids or any Pgp substrates may affect metabolic pathways that favour the occurrence of obesity. This is of special concern because people are often facing simultaneous exposition to many xenochemicals, which inhibits Pgp, and an excess in lipid dietary intake that may contribute to the high prevalence of obesity in our occidental societies."
https://openalex.org/W2044671167,"Integrin linked kinase (ILK), as an important component of mechanical stretch sensor, can initiate cellular signaling response in the heart when cardiac preload increases. Previous work demonstrated increased ILK expression could induce angiogenesis to improved heart function after MI. However the patholo-physiological role of ILK in cardiac remodeling after MI is not clear.Hearts were induced to cardiac remodeling by infarction and studied in Sprague-Dawley rats. Until 4 weeks after infarction, ILK expression was increased in non-ischemic tissue in parallel with myocytes hypertrophy and compensatory cardiac function. 8 weeks later, when decompensation of heart function occurred, ILK level returned to baseline. Followed ILK alternation, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) was significantly decreased 8 weeks after MI. Histology study also showed significantly microvessel decreased and myocytes loss 8 weeks paralleled with ILK down-regulation. While ILK expression was maintained by gene delivery, tissue angiogenesis and cardiac function was preserved during cardiac remodeling.Temporally up-regulation of ILK level in non-ischemic myocytes by increased external load is associated with beneficial angiogenesis to maintain infarction-induced cardiac hypertrophy. When ILK expression returns to normal, this cardiac adaptive response for infarction is weaken. Understanding the ILK related mechanism of cardiac maladaptation leads to a new strategy for treatment of heart failure after infarction."

However, molecular mechanisms associated with PLZF/RARA-dependent leukaemogenesis still remain unclear.We searched for specific PLZF/RARA target genes by ChIP-on-chip in the haematopoietic cell line U937 conditionally expressing PLZF/RARA. By comparing bound regions found in U937 cells expressing endogenous PLZF with PLZF/RARA-induced U937 cells, we isolated specific PLZF/RARA target gene promoters. We next analysed gene expression profiles of our identified target genes in PLZF/RARA APL patients and analysed DNA sequences and epigenetic modification at PLZF/RARA binding sites. We identify 413 specific PLZF/RARA target genes including a number encoding transcription factors involved in the regulation of haematopoiesis. Among these genes, 22 were significantly down regulated in primary PLZF/RARA APL cells. In addition, repressed PLZF/RARA target genes were associated with increased levels of H3K27me3 and decreased levels of H3K9K14ac. Finally, sequence analysis of PLZF/RARA bound sequences reveals the presence of both consensus and degenerated RAREs as well as enrichment for tissue-specific transcription factor motifs, highlighting the complexity of targeting fusion protein to chromatin. Our study suggests that PLZF/RARA directly targets genes important for haematopoietic development and supports the notion that PLZF/RARA acts mainly as an epigenetic regulator of its direct target genes."
https://openalex.org/W2082038304,"Activation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) triggers the innate immune response and leads to the induction of adaptive immunity. TLR4 agonists are known to function as immunostimulants and exhibit promising therapeutic potential for cancer immunotherapy. We have previously developed a synthetic serine-based glycolipid (designated as CCL-34) that can activate TLR4-dependent signaling pathways. In this study, the anticancer immunity of CCL-34 was further demonstrated. CCL-34-activated macrophages induced cancer cell death via the apoptotic pathway, and this cytotoxicity was significantly inhibited by NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (an inducible NOS inhibitor). Notably, conditioned medium collected from CCL-34-treated splenocytes also induced cytotoxicity toward cancer cells. Furthermore, CCL-34 treatment suppressed tumor growth and increased the survival rate in TLR4-functional C3H/HeN mice but not in TLR4-defective C3H/HeJ mice. Increased apoptosis, the induction of cytokines (IFN-γ and IL-12) and chemokines (CXCL9 and CXCL10), and the elevation of leukocyte markers (CD11b, CD11c, CD4, and CD8) were detected at tumor sites in C3H/HeN mice but not in C3H/HeJ mice. Structure-and-activity relationship analysis of CCL-34 and its structural analogs revealed that a sugar moiety is essential for its activity. However, the substitution of the galactose in CCL-34 with glucose or fucose did not reduce its activity. Altogether, this study reveals the anticancer activity of a new synthetic TLR4 agonist and broadens the molecular basis of TLR4-activating glycolipids."
https://openalex.org/W2038165431,"Myotonic dystrophy 1 (DM1) is a multisystemic disease caused by a triplet nucleotide repeat expansion in the 3' untranslated region of the gene coding for myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK). DMPK is a nuclear envelope (NE) protein that promotes myogenic gene expression in skeletal myoblasts. Muscular dystrophy research has revealed the NE to be a key determinant of nuclear structure, gene regulation, and muscle function. To investigate the role of DMPK in NE stability, we analyzed DMPK expression in epithelial and myoblast cells. We found that DMPK localizes to the NE and coimmunoprecipitates with Lamin-A/C. Overexpression of DMPK in HeLa cells or C2C12 myoblasts disrupts Lamin-A/C and Lamin-B1 localization and causes nuclear fragmentation. Depletion of DMPK also disrupts NE lamina, showing that DMPK is required for NE stability. Our data demonstrate for the first time that DMPK is a critical component of the NE. These novel findings suggest that reduced DMPK may contribute to NE instability, a common mechanism of skeletal muscle wasting in muscular dystrophies."

Our results showed that angiotensin II and aldosterone increased Osteopontin expression in adventitial fibroblasts in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. MAPKs and AP-1 pathways were involved in Osteopontin upregulation. In addition, Adventitial fibroblast migration stimulated by Angiotensin II and aldosterone required OPN expression. Perivascular delivery of antisense oligonucleotide for Osteopontin suppressed neointimal formation post-injury. We concluded that upregulation of Osteopontin expression in adventitial fibroblasts might be important in the pathogenesis of vascular remodeling after arterial injury."

In this work, a new K(+)-specific microelectrode was used to study possible alterations in intracellular K(+) in Xenopus laevis oocytes during chemically induced apoptosis. The accuracy of the microelectrode to detect changes in intracellular K(+) was verified with parallel electrophysiological measurements. In concordance with previous studies on other cell types, apoptotic stimuli reduced the intracellular K(+) concentration in Xenopus oocytes and increased caspase-3 activity. The reduction in intracellular K(+) was prevented by dense expression of voltage-gated K (Kv) channels. Despite this, the caspase-3 activity was increased similarly in Kv channel-expressing oocytes as in oocytes not expressing Kv channels. Thus, in Xenopus oocytes caspase-3 activity is not dependent on the intracellular concentration of K(+)."

Here, we investigate the biological role of LZTS2 using newly established Lzts2 KO mice. Homozygosity for loss-of-function of the Lzts2-targeted allele resulted in severe kidney and urinary tract developmental defects, including renal/ureteral duplication, hydroureter, and hydronephrosis, which were visible prenatally. Altered ureteric bud outgrowth was identified in Lzts2 null embryos. Further analysis indicated that β-catenin subcellular localization was altered in fibroblasts isolated from Lzts2 null embryos. In addition, Wnt growth factor-induced β-catenin-mediated transcriptional activity was increased in Lzts2 null fibroblasts, suggesting a direct role for Lzts2 in the Wnt signaling pathway. These data demonstrate a critical role of LZTS2 in renal development and implicate LZTS2 as a critical regulator of β-catenin-mediated nephrogenesis."

NIH3T3 mouse fibroblast cells and B78H1 mouse melanoma cells are naturally resistant to EHV-1 infection; however, these cell lines become susceptible to EHV-1 infection by the exogenous expression of equine MHC class I (13Kurtz B.M.

Taniyama H. Sawa H. Kimura T. Genes Cells. 2011; 16: 343-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The equine MHC class I molecule interacts with EHV-1 gD and mediates EHV-1 entry into equine cell types that are naturally susceptible to EHV-1 infection (14Sasaki M. Hasebe R. Makino Y. Suzuki T. Fukushi H. Okamoto M. Matsuda K. Taniyama H. Sawa H. Kimura T. Genes Cells. 2011; 16: 343-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). MHC class I molecules are known primarily for their role in presenting peptides from intracellular antigens to cytotoxic T cells. MHC class I is polygenic and polymorphic (15Janeway C.A. Travers P. Walport M. Shlomchik M. Immunobiology. 6th Ed. Garland Science Publishing, New York2005: 169-201Google Scholar). Fifty equine MHC class I genes were identified among 10 different serologically defined equine MHC class I haplotypes (16Tallmadge R.L. Campbell J.A. Miller D.C. Antczak D.F. Immunogenetics. 2010; 62: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and seven MHC class I loci were transcribed in an MHC homozygous individual (17Tallmadge R.L. Lear T.L. Antczak D.F. Immunogenetics. 2005; 57: 763-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Although previous studies have shown that three equine MHC class I molecules can act as EHV-1 receptors (13Kurtz B.M. Singletary L.B. Kelly S.D. Frampton Jr., A.R. J. Virol. 2010; 84: 9027-9034Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 14Sasaki M. Hasebe R. Makino Y. Suzuki T. Fukushi H. Okamoto M. Matsuda K. Taniyama H. Sawa H. Kimura T. Genes Cells. 2011; 16: 343-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), it is unclear whether all MHC class I molecules are involved in EHV-1 infection. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells are known to be susceptible to EHV-1 infection (10Frampton Jr., A.R. Goins W.F. Cohen J.B. von Einem J. Osterrieder N. O'Callaghan D.J. Glorioso J.C. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 3169-3173Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Unlike equine cells, inhibition of the cell surface expression of MHC class I molecules by β2-microglobulin knockdown does not reduce the susceptibility of CHO-K1 cells to EHV-1 infection (14Sasaki M. Hasebe R. Makino Y. Suzuki T. Fukushi H. Okamoto M. Matsuda K. Taniyama H. Sawa H. Kimura T. Genes Cells. 2011; 16: 343-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This result suggests that hamster MHC class I has no role in EHV-1 entry into CHO-K1 cells. In this study, we expressed hamster MHC class I on NIH3T3 cells and confirmed the inability of hamster MHC class I to mediate the cellular entry of EHV-1. To clarify the region of equine MHC class I responsible for EHV-1 entry, we performed domain exchange and site-directed mutagenesis experiments on the hamster MHC class I backbone, in which parts of the extracellular region were replaced with corresponding sequences from equine MHC class I. Results from these experiments revealed an important amino acid residue of MHC class I that mediates the efficiency of EHV-1 entry, as well as an equine MHC class I gene that does not act as a receptor for EHV-1. NIH3T3 and 293T cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS. The EHV-1 mutant Ab4-GFP contains a GFP expression cassette between open reading frame (ORF) 62 and ORF 63 (18Ibrahim el S.M. Pagmajav O. Yamaguchi T. Matsumura T. Fukushi H. Microbiol. Immunol. 2004; 48: 831-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Stock viruses were cultured in equine dermis cells and were titrated by plaque formation assay on rabbit kidney (RK13) cells. Equine MHC class I heavy chain clones A68 and B118 were described previously (14Sasaki M. Hasebe R. Makino Y. Suzuki T. Fukushi H. Okamoto M. Matsuda K. Taniyama H. Sawa H. Kimura T. Genes Cells. 2011; 16: 343-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Equine MHC class I heavy chain clone 3.4 (GenBank accession number XM_001493795) cDNA) was obtained by RT-PCR from a primary cultured equine brain microvascular endothelial cell cDNA library (14Sasaki M. Hasebe R. Makino Y. Suzuki T. Fukushi H. Okamoto M. Matsuda K. Taniyama H. Sawa H. Kimura T. Genes Cells. 2011; 16: 343-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Hamster MHC class I heavy chain clone C5 (GenBank accession number AY064390) cDNA was obtained by RT-PCR from CHO-K1 cells. These cDNA fragments were cloned into the pCXSN vector (14Sasaki M. Hasebe R. Makino Y. Suzuki T. Fukushi H. Okamoto M. Matsuda K. Taniyama H. Sawa H. Kimura T. Genes Cells. 2011; 16: 343-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). pCXSN-FLAG-A68, pCXSN-FLAG-B118, and pCXSN-HA-C5 were constructed by insertion of the FLAG or HA epitope tag between the putative signal sequence and the remaining coding sequence. Equine and hamster MHC class I domain-exchanged mutants were generated with the In-Fusion Advantage PCR Cloning kit (Clontech) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Amino acid substitutions in MHC class I were introduced by PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis. NIH3T3 cells seeded in 24-well plates were transfected with plasmid DNA encoding MHC class I or its mutant by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). At 24 h after transfection, cells were infected with Ab4-GFP at a multiplicity of infection of 10. At 12 h postinfection (p.i.), GFP-expressing cells were observed under an inverted fluorescence microscope (IX70; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and counted by flow cytometry. For neutralization of viral gD, EHV-1 Ab4-GFP at a multiplicity of infection of 10 was incubated with anti-gD rabbit polyclonal antibody (generated in the author's laboratory) or control rabbit IgG (Beckman Coulter) for 30 min at 37 °C and then added to the cells. After incubation for 1 h, extracellular virus was inactivated by treatment with 0.1 m citrate buffer, pH 3.0. The cells were cultured in fresh growth medium for an additional 12 h p.i. Viral entry was assessed by counting the number of GFP-positive cells with flow cytometry. Soluble gD-Ig fusion protein (gD-Ig) consisting of the extracellular domain of EHV-1 gD and the Fc segment of the human IgG1 was generated as described previously (14Sasaki M. Hasebe R. Makino Y. Suzuki T. Fukushi H. Okamoto M. Matsuda K. Taniyama H. Sawa H. Kimura T. Genes Cells. 2011; 16: 343-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Purified human IgG (Invitrogen) was used as a control (control-Ig). NIH3T3 cells were plated in 12-well plates and transiently transfected with expression plasmids with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). 293T cells were plated in 12-well plates and cotransfected with equine MHC class I and equine β2-microglobulin expression plasmids with TransIT-2020 (Mirus Bio, Madison, WI). After transfection, cells were stained with primary mouse mAbs against FLAG (clone M2; Sigma), HA (clone HA-7; Sigma), or equine MHC class I (clone H58A; VMRD, Pullman, WA). Bound antibodies were visualized by the addition of Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Invitrogen). Flow cytometric analysis was performed with a FACS Canto system (BD Biosciences). The data collected were analyzed with the Flowjo software package (Tree Star, Ashland, OR). To assess the binding of the gD-Ig fusion protein to equine MHC class I, cells were detached and incubated with gD-Ig or control-Ig at 4 °C for 30 min. Bound gD-Ig or control-Ig was stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-human IgG antibody (Beckman Coulter). The fluorescence signal was analyzed by flow cytometry. 293T cells plated in poly-l-lysine-coated 48-well plates were cotransfected with the indicated equine MHC class I and equine β2-microglobulin expression plasmids as described above. After 20 h, cells were incubated with serially diluted gD-Ig or control-Ig in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were washed with PBS containing 0.1% BSA and fixed with PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde. Fixed cells were exposed to HRP-conjugated anti-human IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Signals were developed by adding o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride substrate (Sigma) in phosphate-citrate buffer, pH 5.0. After addition of 3 n HCl, the absorbance at 490 nm was measured with a microplate reader (Bio-Rad). 293T cells were cotransfected with indicated equine MHC class I and equine β2-microglobulin expression plasmids as described above. After 36 h, cells were lysed in a lysis buffer (1% Brij 98, 200 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Lysates were immunoprecipitated with Dynabeads Protein A (Invitrogen) for 2 h at 4 °C after coating with gD-Ig or control-Ig. After washing with lysis buffer, precipitated protein complexes were eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred onto Immobilon-P transfer membranes (Millipore) and detected with anti-DYKDDDDK (FLAG tag) monoclonal antibody (clone L5; BioLegend, San Diego, CA) or anti-human IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). A homology model of equine MHC class I A68 was constructed based on the crystal structure of HLA-B (Protein Data Bank code 2BVO). After 100 models were generated by Modeler 9v6 (19Eswar N. John B. Mirkovic N. Fiser A. Ilyin V.A. Pieper U. Stuart A.C. Marti-Renom M.A. Madhusudhan M.S. Yerkovich B. Sali A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3375-3380Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), a model was chosen by a combination of the Modeler objective function value and the discrete optimized protein energy statistical potential score (20Shen M.Y. Sali A. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 2507-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar). After the addition of hydrogen atoms, the model was refined by energy minimization with the CHARMm force field and the Discovery Studio 2.5 software package (Accelrys, San Diego, CA). Steepest descent followed by conjugate gradient minimizations was carried out until the root mean square gradient was ≤0.01 kcal/mol per A. The generalized Born implicit solvent model (21Still W.C. Tempczyk A. Hawley R.C. Hendrickson T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 6127-6129Crossref Scopus (3363) Google Scholar, 22Tsui V. Case D.A. Biopolymers. 2000; 56: 275-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar) was used to model the effects of solvation. The molecular model was evaluated with PROCHECK (23Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallog. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) and VERIFY-3D (24Eisenberg D. Lüthy R. Bowie J.U. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 396-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar), and the model structure was displayed by PyMOL (25DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar). We obtained the hamster MHC class I heavy chain clone C5 cDNA (26Furukawa H. Iizuka K. Poursine-Laurent J. Shastri N. Yokoyama W.M. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 126-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) from CHO-K1 cells. C5 showed 70% amino acid sequence identity and 94% similarity with the equine MHC class I heavy chain clone A68, which we previously identified as an EHV-1 receptor. NIH3T3 cells are naturally resistant to EHV-1 infection (14Sasaki M. Hasebe R. Makino Y. Suzuki T. Fukushi H. Okamoto M. Matsuda K. Taniyama H. Sawa H. Kimura T. Genes Cells. 2011; 16: 343-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar); however, exogenous expression of FLAG-tagged A68 rendered the cells susceptible to infection by the GFP-expressing EHV-1 mutant strain Ab4-GFP (Fig. 1A). By contrast, no GFP signal was observed in NIH3T3 cells transfected with HA-tagged C5 (Fig. 1A). Cell surface expressions of A68 and C5 were confirmed by staining with anti-FLAG and anti-HA tag antibodies, respectively (Fig. 1A). These data suggest that the hamster MHC class I clone C5 expressed on the NIH3T3 cell surface does not mediate EHV-1 entry. MHC class I heavy chain is a type I transmembrane protein composed of three extracellular domains (α1, α2, and α3), a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail (27Bjorkman P.J. Parham P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 253-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). To identify the domain responsible for EHV-1 entry, we constructed three mutants, C5A68(α1), C5A68(α2), and C5A68(α3), in which each extracellular domain of C5 was exchanged with that of A68 (Fig. 1B). The expression level of the C5A68(α1) mutant on the NIH3T3 cell surface was relatively low compared with that of the C5A68(α2) and C5A68(α3) mutants (Fig. 1C). Among those three mutants, only C5A68(α2) supported EHV-1 entry into NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 1, C and D). We then constructed four additional C5 mutants, C5A68(115–161), C5A68(162–206), C5A68(162–187), and C5A68(188–206), in which each segment of the α2 domain was substituted with the corresponding region of A68 (Fig. 1B). Entry of Ab4-GFP occurred in NIH3T3 cells expressing C5A68(162–206) or C5A68(162–187), but not in NIH3T3 cells expressing C5A68(115–161) or C5A68(188–206) (Fig. 1, C and D). These results suggest that the amino acid residues at positions 162–187 of A68 play a role in EHV-1 receptor function. Between amino acid residues at positions 162 and 186, A68 and C5 differ in four positions (Fig. 2A). To identify the amino acid residues responsible for function of the EHV-1 receptor, we mutated these four positions individually in C5 (Fig. 2A). All of these C5 mutants were expressed on the NIH3T3 cell surface upon transfection; however, the EHV-1 entry was observed only in NIH3T3 cells expressing C5 Q173A (Fig. 2, B and C). We previously demonstrated the involvement of EHV-1 gD in equine MHC class I-mediated EHV-1 entry (14Sasaki M. Hasebe R. Makino Y. Suzuki T. Fukushi H. Okamoto M. Matsuda K. Taniyama H. Sawa H. Kimura T. Genes Cells. 2011; 16: 343-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To examine whether EHV-1 gD is also involved in viral entry via C5 Q173A, we tested the ability of anti-gD polyclonal antibody to block the EHV-1 infection of C5 Q173A-expressing cells. Anti-gD inhibited EHV-1 entry into C5 Q173A-expressing cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2D). These results indicate that the hamster MHC class I C5 Q173A mutant acts as a weak receptor for EHV-1. We next constructed a series of A68 mutants with replacement of amino acid residues at positions between 162 and 186 of A68 with those of C5 (summarized in Fig. 3A) and examined the susceptibility of NIH3T3 cells transfected with these mutants to EHV-1 infection. The W171L mutation reduced cell surface expression of A68 and inhibited viral entry into NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 3, B and C). The A173Q mutation drastically decreased EHV-1 receptor function, although similar levels of cell surface expression were observed between A68 A173Q and other mutants (Fig. 3, B and C). By contrast, EHD178DRQ and N182A did not impair EHV-1 receptor function (Fig. 3, B and C). A previous study showed that another equine MHC class I clone (B118) also acts as an EHV-1 receptor (14Sasaki M. Hasebe R. Makino Y. Suzuki T. Fukushi H. Okamoto M. Matsuda K. Taniyama H. Sawa H. Kimura T. Genes Cells. 2011; 16: 343-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of B118 showed high similarity to that of A68 (84% identity, 96% similarity), and the alanine residue at position 170 in B118 was equivalent to the alanine residue at position 173 in A68 (Fig. 4A). Induction of the A170Q mutation in B118 greatly decreased the efficiency of EHV-1 entry, although both B118 and B118 A170Q displayed comparable cell surface expression levels (Fig. 4, B and C). These mutagenesis studies reveal that a single amino acid within the α2 domain of equine MHC class I is important for the efficient entry of EHV-1. Because equine MHC class I mediates viral entry via its interaction with EHV-1 gD (14Sasaki M. Hasebe R. Makino Y. Suzuki T. Fukushi H. Okamoto M. Matsuda K. Taniyama H. Sawa H. Kimura T. Genes Cells. 2011; 16: 343-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), we investigated the influence of the A173Q mutation on the binding of A68 with EHV-1 gD, using a soluble gD-Ig fusion protein consisting of the extracellular domain of EHV-1 gD and the Fc segment of human IgG1. Flow cytometric analysis showed that the interaction of gD-Ig with A68 A173Q was much weaker than that with A68, although the level of cell surface expression of A68 A173Q was comparable with that of wild-type A68 (Fig. 5A). Similarly, the A170Q mutation in B118 resulted in a greatly reduced affinity for EHV-1 gD (Fig. 5A). To examine further the effect of the A173Q mutation on the interaction between A68 and gD, cell-based ELISA and immunoprecipitation assays were performed with A68 or A68 A173Q-expressing cells. Cell-based ELISA showed that gD-Ig bound to A68-expressing cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5B). By contrast, gD-Ig did not bind to A68 A173Q-expressing cells (Fig. 5B). Interaction of gD-Ig with A68, but not with A68 A173Q, was observed by immunoprecipitation using gD-Ig (Fig. 5C). These results suggest that substitution of a glutamine residue for alanine at position 173 in A68 (or at position 170 in B118) deprives equine MHC class I of gD-binding capacity, which is required for MHC class I to act as an EHV-1 receptor. Because no crystal structures of equine MHC class I molecules are available, homology modeling of the extracellular domain of the equine MHC class I A68 was performed based on the crystal structure of human MHC class I HLA-B (Protein Data Bank code 2BVO). The alanine residue at position 173 was part of an α-helical structure in the α2 domain and was located near the apical surface of equine MHC class I A68 (Fig. 6). We investigated the effect of mutations at position 173 in A68 to amino acids of various hydrophobicities. These mutants displayed comparable cell surface expression levels (data not shown). The alanine residue has a hydrophobic side chain. Replacement of the alanine at position 173 in A68 by valine or methionine, which are also hydrophobic, had little effect on the function of the EHV-1 receptor (Fig. 7). Replacement of the alanine at position 173 by glutamine, which is relatively hydrophilic, greatly decreased the EHV-1 receptor function (Fig. 7). Replacement of alanine by more hydrophilic amino acids (A173T, A173S, A173E, and A173N) greatly decreased activity of the EHV-1 receptor (Fig. 7). These results suggest that the hydrophobicity of the amino acid at residue 173 of equine MHC class I may be involved in the ability of MHC class I to act as an EHV-1 receptor. Some equine MHC class I genes reportedly have valine, glutamic acid, or threonine instead of alanine at the position corresponding to position 173 of A68 (16Tallmadge R.L. Campbell J.A. Miller D.C. Antczak D.F. Immunogenetics. 2010; 62: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Among the equine MHC class I nucleotide sequences registered in GenBank, we successfully obtained the equine MHC class I clone 3.4 cDNA, which has a threonine residue at position 173, from primary equine cells by RT-PCR (Fig. 8A). NIH3T3 cells transfected with equine MHC class I clone 3.4 were not susceptible to EHV-1 infection, although surface expression on NIH3T3 cells was confirmed by flow cytometry with an anti-equine MHC class I antibody (Fig. 8, B and C). To determine whether the threonine residue at position 173 of clone 3.4 is involved in the inability of this clone to act as an EHV-1 receptor, the T173A mutation was induced in clone 3.4. As expected, NIH3T3 cells expressing equine MHC class I clone 3.4 T173A showed susceptibility to EHV-1 infection (Fig. 8, B and C). Furthermore, preincubation of the virus with anti-gD polyclonal antibody reduced EHV-1 entry into equine MHC class I clone 3.4 T173A-expressing cells (Fig. 8D). These data suggest that equine MHC class I clone 3.4, which is expressed naturally on equine cells, is unable to function as an EHV-1 receptor. The findings also suggest that the residue at position 173 of equine MHC class I is involved in the efficiency of EHV-1 entry into cells. The present study revealed that a single amino acid at position 173 of equine MHC class I plays an important role in the entry of EHV-1. Although hamster MHC class I C5 showed amino acid sequence similarity to A68, C5 was unable to mediate EHV-1 entry into cells. A glutamine to alanine substitution at position 173 enabled C5 to act as an EHV-1 receptor, whereas an alanine to glutamine substitution at position 173 in equine MHC class I A68 resulted in loss of the EHV-1 receptor function. The importance of the amino acid residue at position 173 of equine MHC class I is further suggested by the finding that an alanine substitution at position 173 of equine MHC class I clone 3.4 (which does not naturally work as an EHV-1 receptor) resulted in the acquisition of EHV-1 receptor function. Equine MHC class I reacts with EHV-1 gD, and this interaction mediates EHV-1 entry into cells (14Sasaki M. Hasebe R. Makino Y. Suzuki T. Fukushi H. Okamoto M. Matsuda K. Taniyama H. Sawa H. Kimura T. Genes Cells. 2011; 16: 343-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Soluble gD-Ig fusion protein bound to equine MHC class I A68 and B118 on the cell surface. However, a mutation of alanine at position 173 in A68 or at position 170 in B118 impaired the interaction of gD-Ig with A68 or B118, respectively. These results indicate that these residues are directly involved in binding to EHV-1 gD and thereby influence EHV-1 receptor function. Although EHV-1 infection occurred in NIH3T3 cells expressing hamster MHC class I C5 or equine MHC class I clone 3.4 with an alanine substitution at position 173, the infection rate was lower than that in NIH3T3 cells expressing equine MHC class I clone A68. This finding suggests that other amino acid residues, in addition to alanine 173, contribute to EHV-1 receptor function. MHC class I molecules are polymorphic and broadly distributed in mammalian bodies (15Janeway C.A. Travers P. Walport M. Shlomchik M. Immunobiology. 6th Ed. Garland Science Publishing, New York2005: 169-201Google Scholar). Tallmadge et al. (16Tallmadge R.L. Campbell J.A. Miller D.C. Antczak D.F. Immunogenetics. 2010; 62: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) cloned 50 equine MHC class I genes from 10 different MHC class I haplotypes and classified their deduced amino acid sequences. Based on the amino acid alignment, 32 of the 50 genes have alanine at the position corresponding to position 173 of A68. In addition to A68 and B118, which we previously identified as an EHV-1 receptor, another equine MHC class I molecule (GenBank accession number XM_001915759) that reportedly mediates EHV-1 entry has alanine at the position corresponding to position 173 of A68 (13Kurtz B.M. Singletary L.B. Kelly S.D. Frampton Jr., A.R. J. Virol. 2010; 84: 9027-9034Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In this study, we showed that equine MHC class I clone 3.4 is unable to act as an EHV-1 receptor, and we further showed that threonine at position 173 is involved in the nonfunction as an EHV-1 receptor. Although the ability of other equine MHC class I molecules to mediate EHV-1 entry remains unclear, our findings suggest that EHV-1 utilizes a subset of equine MHC class I molecules in viral entry into equine cells. The extracellular region of MHC class I heavy chain is composed of three domains (α1, α2, and α3), and the α1 and α2 domains lie at the tip of MHC class I (27Bjorkman P.J. Parham P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 253-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Our molecular model suggests that the residue at position 173 within the α2 domain of A68 protrudes outside, as it is accessible to virus. It will be interesting to investigate how the amino acid residue at position 173 contributes to the interaction between MHC class I and EHV-1. Our substitution experiment suggests that the hydrophobicity of the amino acid at residue 173 may influence the efficiency of the MHC class I-dependent entry of EHV-1. In this work, we identified an amino acid residue in the α2 domain of equine MHC class I as a determinant involved in the efficiency of EHV-1 entry into cells. To understand further the interaction between EHV-1 and equine MHC class I molecules, structural determination of the complex formed by EHV-1 and equine MHC class I will be needed. The current work opens the way toward understanding the interaction between EHV-1 and equine MHC class I molecules at the molecular level and provides new insights into the host-virus interaction of EHV-1 infection.

https://openalex.org/W1999904021,"Background We conducted a novel pilot study comparing different delivery routes of ALVAC-HIV (vCP205), a canarypox vaccine containing HIV gene inserts: env, gag and pol. We explored the concept that direct ex vivo targeting of human dendritic cells (DC) would enhance the immune response compared to either conventional intramuscular or intradermal injections of the vaccine alone. Methodology/Principal Findings Healthy HIV-1 uninfected volunteers were administered ALVAC-HIV or placebo by intramuscular injection (IM), intradermal injection (ID) or subcutaneous injection (SQ) of autologous ex vivo transfected DC at months 0, 1, 3 and 6. All vaccine delivery routes were well tolerated. Binding antibodies were observed to both the ALVAC vector and HIV-1 gp160 proteins. Modest cellular responses were observed in 2/7 individuals in the DC arm and 1/8 in the IM arm as determined by IFN-γ ELISPOT. Proliferative responses were most frequent in the DC arm where 4/7 individuals had measurable responses to multiple HIV-1 antigens. Loading DC after maturation resulted in lower gene expression, but overall better responses to both HIV-1 and control antigens, and were associated with better IL-2, TNF-α and IFN-γ production. Conclusions/Significance ALVAC-HIV delivered IM, ID or SQ with autologous ex vivo transfected DC proved to be safe. The DC arm was most immunogenic. Proliferative immune responses were readily detected with only modest cytotoxic CD8 T cell responses. Loading mature DC with the live viral vaccine induced stronger immune responses than loading immature DC, despite increased transgene expression with the latter approach. Volunteers who received the autologous vaccine loaded mature DC developed a broader and durable immune response compared to those vaccinated by conventional routes.

https://openalex.org/W2003032060,"Retinoic acid receptor (RAR) signaling is important for regulating transcriptional activity of genes involved in growth, differentiation, metabolism and reproduction. Defects in RAR signaling have been implicated in cancer. TEL, a member of the ETS family of transcription factors, is a DNA-binding transcriptional repressor. Here, we identify TEL as a transcriptional repressor of RAR signaling by its direct binding to both RAR and its dimerisation partner, the retinoid x receptor (RXR) in a ligand-independent fashion. TEL is found in two isoforms, created by the use of an alternative startcodon at amino acid 43. Although both isoforms bind to RAR and RXR in vitro and in vivo, the shorter form of TEL represses RAR signaling much more efficiently. Binding studies revealed that TEL binds closely to the DNA binding domain of RAR and that both Helix Loop Helix (HLH) and DNA binding domains of TEL are mandatory for interaction. We have shown that repression by TEL does not involve recruitment of histone deacetylases and suggest that polycomb group proteins participate in the process."
https://openalex.org/W2129043854,"Although sialic acids have a key role in many aspects of human biology, the expression of polysialic acid (PSA) in human tissues is thought to be relatively rare. We identified a derivative of PSA called neuraminic acid-containing PSA or NeuPSA that was highly expressed in primary human melanoma tumors and in several cancer cell lines. Moreover, anti-NeuPSA antibodies could induce apoptosis of cancer cells. However, little was known about NeuPSA expression in normal or diseased tissues. In this study we investigated the complete expression profile of NeuPSA in human tissues and a few primary tumors using the anti-NeuPSA monoclonal antibody, SEAM 3. Almost every human tissue tested spanning a representative sample of all organ types was positive for SEAM 3 binding. Specificity of SEAM 3 binding was established by inhibition with NeuPSA but not closely related meningococcal C polysaccharide and loss of SEAM 3 binding when specimens were treated with periodate at high pH, which specifically destroys NeuPSA. Only subsets of cells in each specimen stained positive, and the relative staining between tissues was variable. The distribution and amount of NeuPSA antigen in tissues was correlated with known levels of polysialyltransferase PST or STX expression. The majority of anti-NeuPSA binding occurred intracellularly in the cytoplasm of cells. Tumors generally exhibited considerably increased staining compared with corresponding normal tissues. Identifying the diverse tissue distribution and intracellular location of NeuPSA provides a foundation for investigating the functional role of NeuPSA in human health and disease.

In addition to the small number of mammalian proteins, PSA is expressed on fish egg glycoproteins (11Kitajima K. Inoue S. Inoue Y. Troy F.A. J. Biol.

During the development of a vaccine to prevent disease caused by NmB, we discovered that some antibodies elicited by an N-propionyl derivative of NmB capsular polysaccharide (N-Pr MBPS) (14Granoff D.M. Bartoloni A. Ricci S. Gallo E. Rosa D. Ravenscroft N. Guarnieri V. Seid R.C. Shan A. Usinger W.R. Tan S. McHugh Y.E. Moe G.R. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5028-5036PubMed Google Scholar) were reactive with PSA derivatives that contained de-N-acetyl sialic acid residues (i.e. neuraminic acid) (15Moe G.R. Dave A. Granoff D.M. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 2123-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Neuraminic acid-containing polysialic acid (NeuPSA), which was an unintended side product of the preparation of N-Pr MBPS, was shown to be immunogenic in mice and to elicit antibodies protective against NmB and NmC strains (16Moe G.R. Bhandari T.S. Flitter B.A. J. Immunol. 2009; 182: 6610-6617Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The specificity and functional activity of two murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), SEAM 2 and SEAM 3, that were produced using the N-Pr MBPS-based vaccine, have been studied extensively (15Moe G.R. Dave A. Granoff D.M. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 2123-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 16Moe G.R. Bhandari T.S. Flitter B.A. J.

Bhandari T.S. Flitter B.A. J. Immunol. 2009; 182: 6610-6617Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). SEAM 3 binds to PSA oligosaccharides as short as three residues where the non-reducing end residue is likely Neu. Additionally, it binds to long chain PSA that is less than 50% de-N-acetylated (15Moe G.R. Dave A. Granoff D.M. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 2123-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 16Moe G.R. Bhandari T.S. Flitter B.A. J. Immunol. 2009; 182: 6610-6617Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 17Moe G.R.

Both mAbs bind to Nm group B bacteria and mediate bactericidal activity (14Granoff D.M. Bartoloni A. Ricci S. Gallo E. Rosa D. Ravenscroft N. Guarnieri V. Seid R.C. Shan A. Usinger W.R. Tan S. McHugh Y.E. Moe G.R. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5028-5036PubMed Google Scholar, 19Flitter B.A. Ing J.Y. Moe G.R. Vaccine. 2010; 28: 5967-5972Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Using SEAM 2 and anti-PSA mAbs, we showed that PSA and NeuPSA are expressed as intracellular antigens in Leishmania major parasites but moved to the cell surface during rosette formation (20Iovannisci D.M. Plested C.P. Moe G.R. J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 2010; 57: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Recently, we investigated NeuPSA expression in human melanoma tumors and in melanoma, leukemia, and neuroblastoma cell lines using SEAM 3. SEAM 3-reactive NeuPSA antigens were found to be located mainly intracellularly with only a fraction of cells expressing NeuPSA on the cell surface to varying degrees among the cell lines tested (30Steirer, L. M., Moe, G. R. (2011) PLoS ONE, in press.Google Scholar). Knocking down expression of both PST and STX with siRNA nearly eliminates SEAM 3 binding (30Steirer, L. M., Moe, G. R. (2011) PLoS ONE, in press.Google Scholar). SEAM 3 mediated antibody-dependent cytotoxicity against the tumor cells. However, SEAM 3 was also reactive with antigens in normal human skin cells. Because expression of PSA and NeuPSA was unknown in normal human skin, the results raised questions of whether PSA/NeuPSA expression could be prevalent in normal human tissues. NeuPSA is not reactive with anti-PSA antibodies or sialic acid binding lectins and is resistant to degradation by low pH and exoneuraminidases. 5G. R. Moe and T. S. Bhandari, unpublished information. Therefore, NeuPSA may not be detected by methods commonly used to detect PSA. In the present study we utilized the novel specificity of SEAM 3 against NeuPSA to carry out immunohistochemical studies on normal and malignant adult human tissues. Our primary goal was to produce a complete expression profile for NeuPSA in the human body that would help us better identify any biologically meaningful expression patterns that may exist at a tissue, cellular, and/or intracellular level. This information will for the first time help us understand the potential functional roles NeuPSA may play in the pathophysiology of human cells. Secondary goals of this study include a look at how NeuPSA expression changes at various stages of human development and how expression changes in the face of disease, which in our study is represented by malignancy. The changing pattern of NeuPSA expression noted throughout human development and the changes noted at times of disease ought to help define the functional role of NeuPSA in the human body. Murine mAbs, SEAM 2 and SEAM 3, were produced by immunizing a CD1 mouse with an N-Pr MBPS tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine (14Granoff D.M. Bartoloni A. Ricci S. Gallo E. Rosa D. Ravenscroft N. Guarnieri V. Seid R.C. Shan A. Usinger W.R. Tan S. McHugh Y.E. Moe G.R. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5028-5036PubMed Google Scholar). The polysaccharide vaccine antigen contained ∼16% Neu (21Seid, R. (October 28, 2003) U.S. Patent 6, 638, 513.Google Scholar). The mAbs were obtained from cell culture by precipitation with 50% (w/v) ammonium sulfate. The precipitated antibody was washed with ice-cold 30% ammonium sulfate solution, dialyzed against PBS buffer, and purified by affinity chromatography as described previously (19Flitter B.A. Ing J.Y. Moe G.R. Vaccine. 2010; 28: 5967-5972Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Irrelevant isotype control mAbs were obtained from Southern Biotech (Birmingham, AL). Unless stated otherwise, all human tissues were purchased from the National Disease Research Interchange, and procedures for their use were performed under a protocol approved by the Children's Hospital and Research Institute Oakland (CHRCO) Institutional Review Board. Tissues were provided as frozen tissue, optimal cutting temperature compound-embedded blocks, and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks. Placental tissue was provided by the laboratory of Dr. Vladimir Serkov and fetal tissue by Dr. Alexander Lucas at the Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute (CHORI), both of which were obtained under CHRCO IRB-approved protocols. Mouse normal skin and basal cell carcinoma specimens were provided by the laboratory of Dr. Ervin Epstein, also at CHORI. Cryosections of frozen tissue (6 μm thick) and microsections of FFPE tissue (4 μm thick) were prepared at the Alta Bates Medical Center's Department of Pathology Services (Berkeley, CA). Immunohistochemistry was carried out manually with a Nemesis 3600 stainer (BioCare Medical, Pleasanton, CA) at CHORI or using a Ventana BenchMark XT automated stainer located at the CHRCO Department of Pathology. Microtome-sliced paraffin sections were mounted onto Superfrost Plus slides and stored at room temperature until use. Before manual staining, slides were incubated in a gravity convection oven at 60 °C for 60 min. Slides next underwent deparaffinization with 3 treatments of xylene (5 min each), then rehydrated by serially dipping the slide in 100, 95, and 70% v/v ethanol for 5 min each with a final PBS wash. Antigen retrieval was performed using a Decloaking Chamber (BioCare Medical) device in combination with Reveal Decloaker antigen retrieval solution per manufacture protocol (BioCare Medical). After washing the slides with deionized water, they were treated with 3% peroxide for 10 min to block endogenous peroxidases followed by blocking with 2.5% normal horse serum (Vector Laboratories) for 30 min at room temperature to prevent nonspecific binding. Sections were incubated with 100 μl of primary antibody (∼0.5 μg/ml SEAM 3, purified SEAM 2, or irrelevant mouse IgG2b control) in a humidified chamber for 1 h at room temperature or 4 °C overnight. Bound primary antibody was detected using ImmPRESS universal Ig-peroxidase conjugate reagent from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA) incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The slides were developed using the AEC substrate kit (Vector Laboratories) per the manufacture protocol. Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin QS (Vector Laboratories) and mounted in aqueous mounting medium Vectramount AQ (Vector Laboratories). Automated staining was performed using a BenchMark XT Ventana stainer at the CHRCO Department of Pathology. A program based on the manual staining protocol described above was used to control the automated staining procedures. Before staining, the automated stainer performs deparaffinization with the manufacturer's dewaxing solution and cell conditioner. Slides were treated with inhibitors to block endogenous peroxidases, and then the program was stopped for manual application of primary antibody (0.5 μg/ml of SEAM 3, purified SEAM 2, or murine IgG control). A universal secondary rabbit anti-mouse Ig reagent was then applied, and chromogenic detection was carried out with 3,3-diaminobenzidine substrate. Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin and mounted with a coverslip. For periodate treatment, FFPE tissues were deparaffinized in xylene and then rehydrated in a series of 95, 90, 75, and 50% alcohol incubations. Antigen retrieval was conducted using a Decloaking Chamber (BioCare Medical) and Reveal Decloaker (BioCare). After antigen retrieval, tissues were treated with 0.1 m carbonate buffer, pH 10.3, or 100 mm periodate in 0.1 m carbonate buffer, pH 10.3, for 30 min. Tissues were briefly rinsed with water then treated with 10% ethylene glycol for 10 min. Tissues were rinsed with water, then stained using a Nemesis 3600 (BioCare) automated stainer and IntelliPATH FLX Universal HRP Detection kit (BioCare). Samples were blocked for 5 min with peroxidase block and incubated for 1 h with 0.5 μg/ml SEAM 3, 20 min with secondary antibody, 20 min with tertiary antibody, 5 min with 3,3-diaminobenzidine, and counterstained with hemotoxylin. Cryosections were thaw-mounted onto Superfrost Plus slides and stored at −80 °C until use. Before staining, slides were kept at room temperature for 60 min. No fixation step was used on cryosections. Slides were treated with 3% peroxide to block endogenous peroxidases and then treated with avidin/biotin blocking reagent. All sections were then incubated with primary antibody (0.5 μg/ml of purified SEAM 3, purified SEAM 2, or irrelevant murine IgG control). Primary mAbs were incubated for 1 h at ambient temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Protocols for incubations with a biotinylated secondary antibody and appropriate streptavidin conjugates and substrate used were those recommended by the manufacturer (Vector Laboratories). N-Pr MBPS was diluted in Da Vinci Green (Biocare Medical) to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml. A solution containing primary antibody plus N-Pr MBPS inhibitor was applied to specimens during the manual application step of automated immunohistochemistry approximately 1 h after preparation. Separate inhibition studies were carried out using NmB and NmC capsular polysaccharide (MBPS and NmC capsular polysaccharide (MCPS), respectively). MBPS or MCPS was added to a solution containing primary antibody and was applied to specimens during the manual titration step of automated immunohistochemistry as described above for N-Pr MBPS. Stained slides were reviewed by Dr. Hua Guo of the Department of Pathology at CHRCO. Slides were graded based on staining intensity using a scale from zero (no staining) to four plus (++++, most intense staining). The characteristics of staining specificity were further documented noting the tissue and cell types stained (for example, epithelial and endothelial versus interstitial cell involvement) and noting the staining distribution intracellularly (cytoplasmic versus nuclear). CHO cells were graciously donated by the laboratory of Donald Reason (CHORI). Cells were grown in liquid media (RPMI complete) and collected for quantification with the Guava EasyCyte capillary flow cytometer using the Guava ViaCount reagent (Millipore). The cells were washed in PBS twice, and 300 μl of NuPAGE buffer containing reducing agent (Invitrogen) was added. DNA was sheared by repeated pipetting using a 20-gauge needle. The samples were heated to 70 °C for 15 min followed by centrifugation for 5 min at 15,000 × g. Wells of a prepoured 10% NuPAGE (Novex) gel (Invitrogen) were loaded with 10 μl of sample, and the proteins were resolved by electrophoresis. The proteins on the gel were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. After transfer, the membrane was cut into strips according to lanes loaded and the strips were soaked in blocking buffer (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). Primary antibody SEAM 3 was diluted in blocking buffer and incubated with the PVDF strips for 1 h. The strips were then washed 4 times for 5 min and incubated with IR dye-labeled secondary antibody in blocking buffer (both from LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). Strips were washed 4 times, and the staining was quantified on a LI-COR Odyssey scanner. All slides were analyzed using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 Upright Light/Fluorescence Microscope with digital video capture using Q Capture software (Technical Instruments, San Jose, CA). An electronic image of the Northern blot published in Angata et al. (22Angata K. Nakayama J. Fredette B. Chong K. Ranscht B. Fukuda M. J. Biol.

The integrated pixel density of a blank portion on each blot was subtracted from the pixel density of PST/STX transcript band and divided by the background pixel density to produce a measure of the relative increase over background for each transcript. Qualitative mRNA expression values represented by +, ++, +++, ++++, and +++++ for a 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6-fold increase over background are indicated in Table 2.TABLE 2Comparison of anti-NeuPSA mAb SEAM 3 in normal human tissues with polysialyltransferase PST and STX mRNA expressionTissueNorthern blot mRNAaOriginal Northern blot data published by Angata et al.

Open table in a new tab To develop an efficient and reproducible immunohistochemistry (IHC) protocol for SEAM 3 that minimized nonspecific binding, we chose to work first with human placental tissue, which is known to express polysialylated antigens. The placenta is a simple organ made up of vasculature and a villous structure composed of only a few cell types. FFPE slides of normal human placental tissue were prepared as stated under “Experimental Procedures.” Staining procedures were initially developed manually but were finally automated for consistency using a Ventana stainer. Controls included secondary antibody-only and an irrelevant murine isotype-matched IgG mAb. Both controls (IgG2b shown in Fig. 1, left panel; the IgG3 control for anti-CD34 is not shown) were negative for any binding activity (graded zero out of a possible four plus for stain intensity). An anti-CD34 mAb was used to identify hematopoietic stem cells in the placenta. As shown in Fig. 1, anti-CD34 was reactive with placental cells (right panel indicated with arrows). Anti-CD34 is known to mark areas of the vasculature (endothelial cells of arteries and veins) of the placenta that are richly populated with stem cells (23Andrews R.G. Singer J.W. Bernstein I.D. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 1721-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 24Baumhueter S. Dybdal N. Kyle C. Lasky L.A. Blood. 1994; 84: 2554-2565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but does not mark trophoblast cells at the external surfaces of the tissue. In contrast to antigens marked by the anti-CD34 mAb, light microscopy images showed that SEAM 3 binding was specific for the outer trophoblast cells of the placental villi (Fig. 1, middle panel indicated by arrows). Staining occurred primarily in the intracellular space including the cytoplasm and around the nuclei of trophoblast cells. The surrounding intervillous space and all vasculature components of the placental tissue remained unstained. Therefore, hematopoietic stem cells did not express NeuPSA antigens, which were highly expressed in trophoblasts. The lack of reactivity with hematopoietic stem cells is of particular interest because, as described below, SEAM 3 was strongly reactive with thymic lymphocytes. Using SEAM 3 as a marker for NeuPSA expression, representative specimens from all major normal human organs were collected and screened for binding activity using the automated staining program described above (Table 1). The choice of tissues to include in this study was based on the Food and Drug Administration requirements created for the development of standard normal tissue arrays used for testing mAbs for human use in the United States (25Kini U. Km S. Das K. Diagn. Cytopathol. 2005; 33: 145Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). As shown in the examples in Fig. 2 and summarized in Table 1, nearly all normal human tissues tested show some degree of reactivity with SEAM 3. However, only specific cell types within a particular organ were positive for staining, and there was a wide range of reactivity with SEAM 3. All samples were graded for staining intensity both by the authors and separately by Dr. Hua Guo (CHRCO) who was kept blind from information regarding the antibody used during staining and any changes in staining protocol. Each organ system demonstrated its own unique staining pattern. The following are a few representative tissue types in the human body.TABLE 1Summary of anti-NeuPSA mAb SEAM 3 reactivity with normal human tissue specimensORGANTissue typeStainingPositive cell typeStaining patternBrainCerebrum white matter++Glial cellsPerinuclear stainingCerebrum grey matter+++Glial and neuronal cellsPerinuclear staining of glial cells, granular cytoplasm and perinuclear staining of neuronsPons++Neuronal cellsPerinuclear area and granular cytoplasm stainedThyroidThyroid+++Thyroid epithelial cellsPerinuclear area and granular cytoplasm stainedHeartCardiac muscle+++Cardiac muscle cellsPerinuclear stainingGastrointestinal tractColon+++Epidermal cells of villi, lymphocytesPerinuclear stainingSmall intestine++++Epidermal cells of villiBloodLymphocytes+++B and T cell lymphocytesPerinuclear stainingLiverLiver+HepatocytesGranular cytoplasm-stainedPancreasAcinar cells++Acinar cellsGranular cytoplasm-stainedIslet cells++Islet cellsGranular cytoplasm-stainedAdrenal glandAdrenal cortex+++Large cytoplasm rich cells of the cortexGranular cytoplasm-stained, weak perinuclear stainingThymusThymus++++B and T cell lymphocytesPerinuclear stainingLungLung+++A and B pneumocytesGranular cytoplasm and perinuclear stainingSpleenSpleen+++B and T cell lymphocytesPerinuclear stainingKidneyCortex+Epithelial cells of tubulesGranular cytoplasm stainedGlomeruli−Female reproductive TractOvary+Cortical stromaPerinuclear stainingFallopian tube+Mucosal columnar epitheliumPerinuclear stainingCervix++Epithelial cellsPerinuclear stainingBladderBladder++Epithelial cellsPerinuclear stainingProstateLobule++Lobule epithelial cellsPerinuclear stainingFibromuscular stroma−SkinSkin+++Squamous cellsPerinuclear stainingEyeRetina+Retinal cellsPerinuclear stainingCiliary body−PlacentaChorionic villi+++TrophoblastsPerinuclear area and cytoplasm stainedBlood vessels−Endothelial cells Open table in a new tab The colon is a classic representative organ of the gastrointestinal tract that demonstrates unique tissue layers, including the mucosa, submucosa, and muscularis. Staining with SEAM 3 revealed a pattern that was specific for the epithelial mucosa and for the crypts of glands present in the mucosal layer (Fig. 2). Also of significance, the lamina propria remained mostly negative except for infiltrative lymphocytes that stained positive with SEAM 3. The area around nuclei of these lymphocytes, which make up a majority of the cell structure, appear to be where binding and, therefore, staining occurred. Some weak staining was noted in the submucosal tissue of the colon but was reported as nonspecific binding during pathologic analysis. The underlying muscularis remained negative. The thyroid is a classic representative of an endocrine organ with secretory function in the human body. Treatment of the tissue sample with SEAM 3 r"
https://openalex.org/W2004554669,"D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) from pig has been reported to catalyze the β-elimination of Cl(-) from βCl-D-alanine via abstraction of the substrate α-H as H(+) (""carbanion mechanism"") (Walsh, C. T., Schonbrunn, A., and Abeles, R. H. (1971) J. Biol. Chem. 246, 6855-6866). In view of the fundamental mechanistic importance of this reaction and of the recent reinterpretation of the DAAO dehydrogenation step as occurring via a hydride mechanism, we reinvestigated the elimination reaction using yeast DAAO. That enzyme catalyzes the same reactions as the pig enzyme but with a much higher efficiency and a substantially different kinetic behavior. The reaction is initiated by a very rapid and fully reversible dehydrogenation step. This leads to an equilibrium (k(on) ≈ k(reverse)) between the complexes of oxidized enzyme-βCl-D-alanine and reduced enzyme-βCl-iminopyruvate. In the presence of O(2) the latter complex can partition between an oxidative half-reaction and elimination of Cl(-), which proceeds at a rate of ≈50 s(-1). This step forms a complex between oxidized enzyme and enamine that is characterized by a charge transfer absorption (which describes its rates of formation and decay). A minimal scheme that lists relevant steps of the reductive and oxidative half-reactions and elimination pathways along with the estimate of the corresponding rate constants is presented. β-Elimination of Cl(-) is proposed to originate at the locus of the enzyme-βCl-iminopyruvate complex. A chemical mechanism that can account for elimination is discussed in detail."
