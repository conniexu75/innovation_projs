https://openalex.org/W2094740641,An index for the estimation of synchronization in a microbial population is proposed and discussed. The index is equal to the fraction of cells that divide during a measured interval in excess of the fraction that would divide during random growth in the same interval.

The dietary level of iodine appears to be highly important when nitrate is present in the diet."

https://openalex.org/W2054345983,Tests in which an animal receives or avoids direct electrical stimulation of its brain according to its position in the tank as well as tests of free operant behavior demonstrate the existence of both positively and negatively rewarding areas in the brain of the goldfish.

In three cats showing poor recovery over periods of 2 to 6 months, and then surviving removal of the ipsilateral frontal lobe, further recovery of placing occurred after the second operation."

https://openalex.org/W2067208742,"Studies of synthetic iron sulfides formed from aqueous solution at 25 degrees C and atmospheric pressure have revealed the existence of a new phase, tetragonal FeS. This phase is formed as the initial corrosion product of metallic iron or steel in solutions of hydrogen sulfide. It has been discovered as an iron corrosion product in the sediments of the Mystic River at Boston, Massachusetts."

https://openalex.org/W1970631503,"Five Hereford cattle, that had spent their entire lives in northeast Nevada under range pasture conditions, were slaughtered in May 1960. Seven bones were removed from each animal, ashed, Ca and Sr were separated, and the amounts of Ca, Sr, and Sr/sup 90/ were determined for each bone. Data are tabulated for each bone and for different ages. The incisors contained more Ca and less Sr/sup 90/ and the frontal bone was higher in both total Sr and Sr/sup 90/ than the other bones. A calf had less Ca and Sr in its skeleton than older animals. The concentration of Ca apparently reached equilibrium in the skeleton at 1 year, while total Sr exhibited a progressive increase. The concentration of Sr/sup 90/ apparently reached a maximum in the 2-year-old animal and remained about the same thereafter, although it was somewhat lower in older animals. (C.H.)"
