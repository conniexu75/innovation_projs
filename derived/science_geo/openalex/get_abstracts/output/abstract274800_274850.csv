https://openalex.org/W2005057009,"Cotyledons are specialized leaves produced during plant embryogenesis. Cotyledons and leaves typically differ in morphology, ultrastructure, and patterns of gene expression. The leafy cotyledon (Iec) mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana fails to maintain this distinction between embryonic and vegetative patterns of plant development. Mutant embryos are phenotypically abnormal, occasionally viviparous, and intolerant of desiccation. Mutant cotyledons produce trichomes characteristic of leaves, lack embryo-specific protein bodies, and exhibit a vascular pattern intermediate between that of leaves and cotyledons. These results suggest that lec cotyledons are partially transformed into leaves and that the wild-type gene (LEC) functions to activate a wide range of embryo-specific pathways in higher plants."
https://openalex.org/W2047426612,"Variabilities in sea-surface temperature and size of the Western Pacific Warm Pool were tracked with 10 years of satellite multichannel sea-surface temperature observations from 1982 to 1991. The results show that both annual mean sea-surface temperature and the size of the warm pool increased from 1983 to 1987 and fluctuated after 1987. Possible causes of these variations include solar irradiance variabilities, EI Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation events, volcanic activities, and global warming."
https://openalex.org/W2037836461,"In higher plants, the transition from the vegetative to the; reproductive state in the shoot meristem initiates flowering. To study this floral transition, Constitutively flowering mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype columbia, embryonic flower (emf), was characterized. No vegetative shoots were produced from emf embryos or calli; the shoot apical meristems (SAMs) in the emf embryos were altered compared to wild-type SAMs. The mutant SAMs enlarged precociously and produced inflorescence meritems upon germination. These results suggest that the dominant, wild-type allele EMF is required for the vegetative state of the SAM. In the absence of EMF function, the mutant embryo assumes the reproductive state."
https://openalex.org/W1983124843,"The energetics and the electronic, magnetic, and geometric structure of the metallocarbohedrene Ti(8)C(12) have been calculated self-consistently in the density functional formulation. The structure of Ti(8)C(12) is a distorted dodecahedron with a binding energy of 6.1 electron volts per atom. The unusual stability is derived from covalent-like bonding between carbon atoms and between titanium and carbon atoms with no appreciable interaction between titanium atoms. The density of states at the Fermi energy is high and is derived from a strong hybridization between titanium 3d and carbon sp electrons. Titanium sites carry a small magnetic moment of 0.35 Bohr magneton per atom and the cluster is only weakly magnetic."

https://openalex.org/W2060185788,"Photoemission spectra of compounds prepared by the reaction of C(60) films with calcium show two distinct metallic phases, whereas alkali-doped C(60) films have only one. In the first phase the bulk t(1u) band, derived from the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of C(60), is partially occupied. This is followed by an insulating phase that has the composition Ca(3)C(60) in which the t(1u) band is filled and has properties analogous to those of K(6)C(60). Continued exposure to calcium produces a second metallic phase in which electrons are donated into the t(1g) band. The superconductivity of Ca(5)C(60) is associated with the t(1g) band."
https://openalex.org/W1975583469,"The energy spectrum of solar cosmic-ray particles of the iron group has been determined for the first time over the energy range from 1 to 100 million electron volts per nucleon by the use of glass removed from the Surveyor 3 spacecraft. The difference between the observed (energy)(-3) spectrum and the limiting spectrum derived previously from tracks in lunar rocks gives an erosion rate of 0 to 2 angstroms per year. High-energy fission of lead, induced by galactic cosmicray protons and alpha particles, has also been observed."
https://openalex.org/W2101725964,The most conspicuous climatic aberration of the past two millennia was the temperature decline and glacial advance of the A.D. 1550 to 1900 period. This temperature decline has been correlated with an interval of lower solar activity and there is evidence from both the post-Pleistocene glacial record and from oxygen-18 analysis that such an interval han recurred at cyclic periods of around 2400 to 2600 years.
https://openalex.org/W1977277288,"A glass filter from Surveyor 3 has a surface density of approximately 1 x 10(6) tracks per square centimeter from heavy solar flare particles. The variation with depth is best fitted with a solar particle spectrum dN/dE = 2.42 x 10(6) E(-2) [in particles per square centimeter per year per steradian per (million electron volts per nucleon)], where E is the energy and N is the number of particles, from 2 million electron volts per nucleon to approximately 7 million electron volts per nucleon and dN/dE = 1.17 x 10(7) E(-3) at higher energies. Not much difference is observed between 0.5 and 5 micrometers, an indication that there is a lack of track-registering particles below 0.5 million electron volts per nucleon. The Surveyor data are compatible with track results in lunar rocks, provided an erosion rate of approximately 10(-7) centimeter per year is assumed for the latter. The results also suggest a small-scale erosion process in lunar rocks."
https://openalex.org/W2057983750,"Parthenocarpy was induced in cucumber Cucumis sativus L. by foliar application of morphactin. Morphactin (chlorfluorenol) was most effective in inducing parthenocarpy when applied in the flowering stage, and the response was enhanced by prior treatment with Ethrel (2-chloroethylphosphonic acid). Morphactin stimulated pistillate flower development in a monoecious cultivar but did not modify sex expression of a gynoecious line."
https://openalex.org/W2062941663,"Nine different crystalline rocks of the Apollo 12 samples have been analyzed with conventional chemical rock analysis methods. Five of the rocks have normative quartz, whereas the others have normative olivine and hypersthene. The rocks show a wide range in the ratio of iron to magnesium, and their compositions fall on relatively smooth curves in the oxide variation diagram. It is suggested that these rocks, with one exception, represent different parts of a differentiated magmatic body, in which magmatic differentiation by crystallization and settling of olivine was most effective. The source material of the original magma may be peridotite with or without minor amounts of plagioclase or spinel or garnet, with the presence or absence of these minerals dependent on the depth of magma generation."
https://openalex.org/W1972972450,The fission track age of a basalt recovered from beneath Campanian sediments on the lower western flank of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is (15.9 +/- 1.6) x 10(6) years. The major element composition of a glassy margin of the basalt is similar to that of oceanic tholeiites except for a markedly higher potassium concentration.

https://openalex.org/W2080543782,"Filaments of methyl 2-cyanoacrylate polymer were developed from the vapors of the monomer. While growing, the fibers seem to be chemically more active at their ends than along their sides, with this chemical specificity leading to a linearly ordered polymer structure. The number and character of the fibers are a function of the surface from which the fibers emanate and of the concentration of the monomer."
