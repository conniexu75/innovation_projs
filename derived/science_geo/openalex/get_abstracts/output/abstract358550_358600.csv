One of these (strain 4545) has been utilized in a method for biological assay for this amino acid (3). More recently evidence for some interrelation between the biosynthesis of uridine and lysine (4) has prompted further investigations of the group of lysineless mutants."

https://openalex.org/W2137238960,"Mendel and Rudney1 demonstrated that mammalian tissues may contain two distinct esterases, both capable of hydrolysing acetylcholine in vitro : a specific enzyme (‘true' cholinesterase) and a nonspecific enzyme (‘pseudo' cholinesterase). The chemically dissimilar natures of the two enzymes were indicated by their selective behaviour towards particular choline esters2 and by the selective toxic effects, on the pseudo esterase, of the dimethylcarbamate of (2-hydroxy : 5-phenylbenzyl)-trimethylammonium bromide3 and of diisopropylfluorophosphate4. Both these substances exert powerful effects on pseudocholinesterase at concentrations which are relatively ineffective against true cholinesterase."

(wet weight) of guinea pig liver homogenate were added to a reaction mixture containing 1.3 per cent of an amino acid mixture corresponding to the composition of casein and 0.005 M fumarate, all in a final volume of 4 ml. of isotonic saline solution(1) at pH 7.4. The reaction was carried out under oxygen for 6 hours at 38°."

https://openalex.org/W1994636577,"THE conventional ‘parasite-rate' (percentage proportion of children aged 3–10 years in whose blood malaria parasites are detected by a single examination) may be a misleading standard of qualitative measurement giving a distorted idea of the amount of malaria in a locality. But in practice a reduction from 70 to 40 per cent is often claimed to be evidence of effective malaria control, and we are led to believe that a figure of 5 per cent is a splendid achievement indicating a very low malaria incidence."

https://openalex.org/W2031014779,THE view that the contractile vacuoles of Protozoa in many cases perform an osmoregulatory function has been supported by much evidence1 which need not be repeated here. Recent observations carried out on the freshwater peritrich ciliate Carchesium aselli have demonstrated the remarkably close regulation of body volume which is achieved in spite of wide variation in the osmotic stress imposed by the environment.

https://openalex.org/W4253959505,"IN one of those fanciful stories for children included in the “Just So Stories”, Rudyard Kipling takes us in imagination back to Neolithic times and describes how an alphabet might have been devised. A stranger came upon a man and his small daughter, and the little girl thought she could send a message back to her mother by the stranger. Her message consisted of ‘pictures' scratched on birch bark, but unhappily the pictures were completely misunderstood, with sad consequences for the stranger. As a result of this misadventure, the little girl started to draw signs to represent sounds, and in a short time with the help of her father produced an alphabet —it may seem curious that this alphabet should consist of the very letters used in modern English, but any other would clearly be pointless in a child‘s story written in English. Kipling must have realized when he wrote these two fascinating little stories, one showing the inadequacy of the picture language, and the other purporting to describe the origins of writing, the natural attraction of signs and symbols for children. The simplicity of the symbol in contrast with the complexity of a pictorial representation for conveying a message has always attracted children, and in these stories he gives the child struggling with the alphabet something tangible on which to base the written characters it is trying to recognize and reproduce."

https://openalex.org/W2043623955,"POLAND is at present faced with a venereal disease problem against which the state of affairs in Britain appears insignificant. The incidence of venereal diseases has increased enormously over the war years and the number of fresh infections with syphilis is now calculated to be about 150,000 per year. There is a decrease in live births of about 40,000-50,000 per year, the mortality-rate from syphilis being about 11 per cent. The reason for this state of affairs is not far to seek. The Germans spared little attention for the Poles whether they were in Poland or displaced to other countries. Venereal diseases were prevalent among displaced persons, and although plans were formulated before D-day for the treatment of infected persons before they were repatriated, nothing was, in fact, ever done for them."
https://openalex.org/W4246517392,"The remarks which Sir Percival Waterfield, the First Commissioner of the Civil Service, made at Oxford in March regarding the low standard in personality and intelligence shown by applicants for entry into the Civil Service have aroused a considerable discussion and formed the subject of a debate on the Civil Service initiated by Viscount Mersey in the House of Lords on May 26. Sir Percival‘s statement that, of three thousand graduates interviewed, 40 per cent of those who wanted to go into the administrative service and 50 per cent of applicants for the foreign service scored marks for personality and intelligence which represented complete failure, is one of which industry and the universities as well as the Civil Service are bound to take careful note. His further statement that about five per cent of applicants for the administrative service and eight per cent for the foreign service were below even the lowest category may well be discounted, as was suggested in the debate, by war-time conditions and the absence of the screening which was practised by the universities with candidates for the written examinations ; but the feature that, among those who failed, 60 per cent had university or college scholarships and 20 per cent were those who had State scholarships, should cause at least as much disquiet to the educationist and industrialist as to the Civil Service Commissioners."
