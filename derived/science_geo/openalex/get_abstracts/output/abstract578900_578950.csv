https://openalex.org/W2581179619,"Cancer cells survive cellular crisis through telomere maintenance mechanisms. We report telomere lengths in 18,430 samples, including tumors and non-neoplastic samples, across 31 cancer types. Telomeres were shorter in tumors than in normal tissues and longer in sarcomas and gliomas than in other cancers. Among 6,835 cancers, 73% expressed telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), which was associated with TERT point mutations, rearrangements, DNA amplifications and transcript fusions and predictive of telomerase activity. TERT promoter methylation provided an additional deregulatory TERT expression mechanism. Five percent of cases, characterized by undetectable TERT expression and alterations in ATRX or DAXX, demonstrated elongated telomeres and increased telomeric repeat-containing RNA (TERRA). The remaining 22% of tumors neither expressed TERT nor harbored alterations in ATRX or DAXX. In this group, telomere length positively correlated with TP53 and RB1 mutations. Our analysis integrates TERT abnormalities, telomerase activity and genomic alterations with telomere length in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2582407848,"Pericytes are perivascular mural cells of brain capillaries. They are positioned centrally in the neurovascular unit between endothelial cells, astrocytes and neurons. This position allows them to regulate key neurovascular functions of the brain. The role of pericytes in the regulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and neurovascular coupling remains, however, under debate. Using loss-of-function pericyte-deficient mice, here we show that pericyte degeneration diminishes global and individual capillary CBF responses to neuronal stimuli, resulting in neurovascular uncoupling, reduced oxygen supply to the brain and metabolic stress. Neurovascular deficits lead over time to impaired neuronal excitability and neurodegenerative changes. Thus, pericyte degeneration as seen in neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease may contribute to neurovascular dysfunction and neurodegeneration associated with human disease."

Conventional hardware for such studies, however, physically tethers the experimental animal to an external light source, limiting the range of possible experiments. Emerging wireless options offer important capabilities that avoid some of these limitations, but the current size, bulk, weight, and wireless area of coverage is often disadvantageous. Here, we present a simple but powerful setup based on wireless, near-field power transfer and miniaturized, thin, flexible optoelectronic implants, for complete optical control in a variety of behavioral paradigms. The devices combine subdermal magnetic coil antennas connected to microscale, injectable light-emitting diodes (LEDs), with the ability to operate at wavelengths ranging from UV to blue, green-yellow, and red. An external loop antenna allows robust, straightforward application in a multitude of behavioral apparatuses. The result is a readily mass-producible, user-friendly technology with broad potential for optogenetics applications."

https://openalex.org/W2580419078,"The recent Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic is associated with microcephaly in newborns. Although the connection between ZIKV and neurodevelopmental defects is widely recognized, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we show that two recently isolated strains of ZIKV, an American strain from an infected fetal brain (FB-GWUH-2016) and a closely-related Asian strain (H/PF/2013), productively infect human iPSC-derived brain organoids. Both of these strains readily target to and replicate in proliferating ventricular zone (VZ) apical progenitors. The main phenotypic effect was premature differentiation of neural progenitors associated with centrosome perturbation, even during early stages of infection, leading to progenitor depletion, disruption of the VZ, impaired neurogenesis, and cortical thinning. The infection pattern and cellular outcome differ from those seen with the extensively passaged ZIKV strain MR766. The structural changes we see after infection with these more recently isolated viral strains closely resemble those seen in ZIKV-associated microcephaly."
https://openalex.org/W2581980900,"The hippocampal dentate gyrus is often viewed as a segregator of upstream information. Physiological support for such function has been hampered by a lack of well-defined characteristics that can identify granule cells and mossy cells. We developed an electrophysiology-based classification of dentate granule cells and mossy cells in mice that we validated by optogenetic tagging of mossy cells. Granule cells exhibited sparse firing, had a single place field, and showed only modest changes when the mouse was tested in different mazes in the same room. In contrast, mossy cells were more active, had multiple place fields and showed stronger remapping of place fields under the same conditions. Although the granule cell-mossy cell synapse was strong and facilitating, mossy cells rarely ""inherited"" place fields from single granule cells. Our findings suggest that the granule cells and mossy cells could be modulated separately and their joint action may be critical for pattern separation."

Here we provide positron emission tomography evidence that activation of astrocytic glutamate transport via the excitatory amino acid transporter GLT-1 triggers widespread but graded glucose uptake in the rodent brain. Our results highlight the need for a reevaluation of the interpretation of [18F]FDG positron emission tomography data, whereby astrocytes would be recognized as contributing to the [18F]FDG signal."

A second excitatory cell type in the dentate gyrus, the mossy cell, forms an intricate circuit with granule cells, CA3c pyramidal cells, and local interneurons, but the influence of mossy cells on dentate function is often overlooked. Multiple tetrode recordings, supported by juxtacellular recording techniques, showed that granule cells fired very sparsely, whereas mossy cells in the hilus fired promiscuously in multiple locations and in multiple environments. The activity patterns of these cell types thus represent different environments through distinct computational mechanisms: sparse coding in granule cells and changes in firing field locations in mossy cells. Granule cells in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus are thought to be essential to memory function by decorrelating overlapping input patterns (pattern separation). A second excitatory cell type in the dentate gyrus, the mossy cell, forms an intricate circuit with granule cells, CA3c pyramidal cells, and local interneurons, but the influence of mossy cells on dentate function is often overlooked.

The activity patterns of these cell types thus represent different environments through distinct computational mechanisms: sparse coding in granule cells and changes in firing field locations in mossy cells. One of the key goals of systems neuroscience is to understand specific neural circuits in terms of anatomical connectivity and computational functions of the individual cell types in those circuits. Local circuits within a small brain volume present a particular challenge to this goal when the circuits are probed with extracellular, electrophysiological techniques in freely moving animals. The inability of such techniques to identify which particular neuronal types generate which particular spikes creates a major obstacle to relating the neural correlates of single units during freely moving behavior to the exquisite circuitry revealed by anatomical studies and the sophisticated computational models inspired by the anatomy and cellular physiology. The simple, laminated structure of the hippocampus provides a prime system that is amenable to such analyses. The dentate gyrus (DG) is the only region of the hippocampus that contains two distinct, excitatory cell types. Granule cells, located in the densely packed granule cell layer (GCL), are by far the most numerous cell type in the DG (Amaral et al., 1990Amaral D.G. Ishizuka N. Claiborne B. Neurons, numbers and the hippocampal network.Prog. Brain Res. 1990; 83: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Mossy cells, located in the subjacent hilus, are the second excitatory cell type (Amaral, 1978Amaral D.G. A Golgi study of cell types in the hilar region of the hippocampus in the rat.J. Comp. Neurol. 1978; 182: 851-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). In the classic notion of hippocampal circuitry, the DG granule cells are the first processing stage of the “trisynaptic loop,” receiving inputs from the entorhinal cortex and sending projections to the CA3 region. Modern techniques have revealed a more complex circuitry, with the mossy cell occupying a pivotal node mediating both a disynaptic, recurrent processing loop within the DG and a disynaptic feedback loop from the CA3 region back to the DG granule layer (Figure 1A; Scharfman, 1994Scharfman H.E.

CA3 is thought to mediate memory storage and retrieval of full patterns from partial or degraded cues, a process termed pattern completion (McClelland and Goddard, 1996McClelland J.L. Goddard N.H.

McClelland J.L. Hippocampal conjunctive encoding, storage, and recall: avoiding a trade-off.Hippocampus. 1994; 4: 661-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). However, the storage capacity of such a distributed memory system is limited and susceptible to interference if the stored patterns are too similar to each other (McNaughton and Morris, 1987McNaughton B.L.

The mechanisms for pattern completion and pattern separation in the hippocampus.Front. Syst. Neurosci. 2013; 7: 74Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The DG is thought to perform a complementary pattern separation computation, receiving overlapping inputs from entorhinal cortex and sending less correlated outputs to CA3 (Yassa and Stark, 2011Yassa M.A. Stark C.E.L.

Early computational models of DG pattern separation, inspired by Marr’s “expansion recoding” theory of the cerebellar granule layer (Marr, 1969Marr D. A theory of cerebellar cortex.J. Physiol. 1969; 202: 437-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (2187) Google Scholar), suggested a particular mechanism of pattern separation in which overlapping entorhinal input patterns are projected onto the larger, sparsely firing population of dentate granule cells, thereby recruiting ensembles of active granule cells that have reduced overlap compared to the entorhinal inputs (McNaughton and Morris, 1987McNaughton B.L.

Although accumulating evidence strongly supports the role of the DG in pattern separation (Neunuebel and Knierim, 2014Neunuebel J.P. Knierim J.J.

A computational theory of hippocampal function, and empirical tests of the theory.Prog. Neurobiol. 2006; 79: 1-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), the precise computational and circuit mechanisms underlying this role remain under debate. In particular, the “expansion recoding” mechanism of DG pattern separation was challenged by the finding that cells recorded in the DG often have multiple place fields in a single environment and fire promiscuously in multiple environments, rather than being sparsely active and selective for a small fraction of environments (Jung and McNaughton, 1993Jung M.W.

Moser E.I. et al.Hippocampal granule cells opt for early retirement.Hippocampus. 2010; 20: 1109-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This type of firing could still support pattern separation, but by an entirely different mechanism in which an active population discriminates environments based on changes in the spatial or temporal coincidence of firing, rather than the sparse activation of discrete subsets of cells (Leutgeb et al., 2007Leutgeb J.K. Leutgeb S. Moser M.-B. Moser E.I. Pattern separation in the dentate gyrus and CA3 of the hippocampus.Science. 2007; 315: 961-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar). Both single- and multiple-field cells can be recorded from the DG (Jung and McNaughton, 1993Jung M.W. McNaughton B.L. Spatial selectivity of unit activity in the hippocampal granular layer.Hippocampus. 1993; 3: 165-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, Leutgeb et al., 2007Leutgeb J.K. Leutgeb S. Moser M.-B. Moser E.I. Pattern separation in the dentate gyrus and CA3 of the hippocampus.Science. 2007; 315: 961-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar), and recent evidence suggested that the multiple-field cells may be confined to the hilus (Neunuebel and Knierim, 2012Neunuebel J.P. Knierim J.J. Spatial firing correlates of physiologically distinct cell types of the rat dentate gyrus.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 3848-3858Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, limitations in the data reported in the latter study made it uncertain whether these response types represent the firing of distinct, anatomically defined cell types and how these cells would fire in multiple environments. We recorded excitatory cells from the GCL, hilus, and CA3 while rats foraged for food in four distinct environments. Cells recorded in the GCL rarely fired during behavior and typically had single place fields in a single environment when active. In contrast, cells recorded in the hilus were active in all or most environments and usually had multiple firing fields. Juxtacellular recordings from identified granule cells and mossy cells suggest that the single-field cells recorded in the GCL correspond to granule cells and multiple-field cells recorded in the hilus correspond to mossy cells. As unique populations of putative granule cells were active in each environment, this result supports classic models of DG pattern separation (Marr, 1969Marr D. A theory of cerebellar cortex.J. Physiol. 1969; 202: 437-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (2187) Google Scholar, McNaughton and Morris, 1987McNaughton B.L. Morris R.G.M. Hippocampal synaptic enhancement and information storage within a distributed memory system.Trends Neurosci. 1987; 10: 408-415Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (947) Google Scholar, Rolls and Treves, 1998Rolls E.T. Treves A. Neural Networks and Brain Function. Oxford University Press, 1998Google Scholar), while the firing of mossy cells may support pattern separation through changes in coincident firing (Leutgeb et al., 2007Leutgeb J.K. Leutgeb S. Moser M.-B. Moser E.I. Pattern separation in the dentate gyrus and CA3 of the hippocampus.Science. 2007; 315: 961-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar), demonstrating two modes of pattern separation in the distinct excitatory cell components of the same computational circuit in the DG. Single unit activity was recorded from the DG (GCL and hilus) and CA3 of 8 adult rats as they foraged for food in four distinct environments. Each of the four environments was in a different room, with distinct visual cues, on a platform with different shape, color, and/or texture (Figure 1B). The firing rates of granule cells when the rat was not asleep were extremely low (in some cases, zero spikes were recorded in >15 min of awake resting; Figure S2; Movie S1). It was therefore essential to record long periods of sleep in order to identify granule cells, as it was otherwise easy to move electrodes through the GCL without recording any cells (Jung and McNaughton, 1993Jung M.W. McNaughton B.L. Spatial selectivity of unit activity in the hippocampal granular layer.Hippocampus. 1993; 3: 165-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, Skaggs et al., 1996Skaggs W.E.

Knierim J.J. Spatial firing correlates of physiologically distinct cell types of the rat dentate gyrus.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 3848-3858Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To minimize ambiguity in the recording location for each tetrode, rats were perfused on the final day of recording and only well-isolated cells recorded on the final day were analyzed initially. We excluded putative interneurons (Figure S3) and cells recorded on tetrodes that did not show, upon histological examination, tracks that ended clearly in the GCL, hilus, or CA3 (Figures 1C and S1). With these criteria, 37, 23, and 28 cells from 12, 10, and 5 tetrodes located clearly in the GCL, hilus, and CA3, respectively, were selected for initial analysis. These cells came from four (GCL), five (hilus), and two (CA3) rats, since the strict selection criteria excluded many cells from this initial analysis. This selection process was completely independent of any of the spatial firing properties analyzed below. Overall, the number of environments in which cells had a place field was higher in the hilus than the GCL or CA3 (GCL, 0.35 ± 0.09; hilus, 3.52 ± 0.21; CA3, 1.14 ± 0.18; Kruskal-Wallis test across all three areas, p = 2.48 × 10−12; Dunn’s tests, hilus versus GCL, p = 8.00 × 10−13; hilus versus CA3, p = 5.50 × 10−5; GCL versus CA3, p = 0.010) (Figure 2A). The majority of cells recorded in the GCL (25/37) were silent in all four environments. The proportion of silent cells in the GCL was significantly higher than the proportion in either the hilus (1/23) or CA3 (6/28) (Figure 2A; overall, χ2 = 28.45, p = 6.62 × 10−7; GCL versus hilus, χ2 = 23.09, p = 4.65 × 10−6; GCL versus CA3, χ2 = 13.60, p = 6.77 × 10−4). Only one cell in the GCL was active in more than one room, whereas the majority of cells in the hilus (17/23) were active in all four environments. Averaged over all four environments, only 9% of cells in the GCL were active in a given environment, compared to 88% of cells in the hilus and 29% of CA3 cells. Cells in the hilus were more likely than cells in the GCL or CA3 to have multiple firing fields in a given recording session (Figure 2B). Because each cell contributed four data points to Figure 2B (one for each environment), for statistical testing we calculated the average number of place fields for each cell that was active in at least one room (total fields across all environments / number of active environments). Cells in the hilus had a higher average number of place fields (2.26 ± 0.14) than cells in the GCL (1.04 ± 0.04) or CA3 (1.19 ± 0.07) (Kruskal-Wallis, p = 1.63 × 10−8; Dunn’s tests, GCL versus hilus, p = 1.43 × 10−6; hilus versus CA3, p = 1.27 × 10−6; GCL versus CA3, p = 0.817). Some hilus cells had zero or one field in some sessions (Figure 2B), but these same cells often had multiple fields in other rooms (Data S1H). Thus, the presence and number of place fields in a single environment are insufficient criteria to distinguish between individual cells of the hilus and GCL. As compared to tetrodes in the hilus, tetrodes in the GCL tended to record a larger number of cells during sleep and fewer cells that were active during open-field exploration. The average sparseness ratio (defined as the number of active cells during behavior / the number of cells recorded during sleep; Neunuebel and Knierim, 2012Neunuebel J.P. Knierim J.J. Spatial firing correlates of physiologically distinct cell types of the rat dentate gyrus.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 3848-3858Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) across all four rooms was higher (i.e., less sparse) in the hilus (median, 0.96; interquartile range [IQR], 0.83–1.0) than the GCL (median, 0.05, IQR 0.0–0.18) (Kruskal-Wallis, p = 3.50 × 10−5; Dunn’s tests, GCL versus hilus, p = 1.86 × 10−5; hilus versus CA3, p = 0.079; GCL versus CA3, p = 0.44) (Figure 2C). In contrast, cells in the hilus had 5- to 7-fold higher mean firing rates during sleep sessions (0.70 ± 0.11 Hz) than cells in the GCL (0.10 ± 0.02 Hz) or CA3 (0.13 ± 0.02 Hz) (Figure 2D; Kruskal-Wallis, p = 1.04 × 10−8; Dunn’s tests, GCL versus hilus, p = 8.76 × 10−9; hilus versus CA3, p = 2.46 × 10−5; GCL versus CA3, p = 0.488). For cells active in at least one environment, the mean and peak firing rates of the most active session for each cell were also higher in the hilus (Figures 2E and 2F, left; see Table S1 for statistics). When silent cells were included, mean and peak firing rates were significantly different between CA3 and the GCL (Figures 2E and 2F right; see Table S1 for statistics); these differences were driven by the proportions of active cells in these areas. We next expanded our analyses to include earlier recording days and tetrodes that ended too close to the GCL-hilus boundary or the hilus-CA3 boundary to be included in our initial analyses. For each tetrode that reached the DG or CA3, we selected the recording day on which the largest number of well-isolated, putative excitatory units were recorded. This selection process generated a dataset of 242 cells from 57 tetrodes, while ensuring that individual units were not counted more than once from the same tetrode. For each tetrode, the number of cells active in 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 environments is shown in Figure 3A. A subset of the tetrodes that were used in the initial analysis (GCL, hilus, and CA3) were segregated from the more ambiguous tetrodes (i.e., tetrodes on which no cells were recorded on the last day or tetrodes judged to be too close to the layer boundaries: GCL/hilus and hilus/CA3). Each anatomically segregated group of tetrodes was sorted by the average mean firing rate of all cells recorded on the tetrode during the post-behavior sleep session. The tetrode with the lowest average firing rate within the anatomical region is labeled on the x axis as “low,” while the tetrode with the highest rate is labeled “high.” Some tetrodes in the GCL/hilus and hilus/CA3 groups simultaneously recorded cells that were silent or active in a single room with other cells that were active in all or most rooms (Figure 3A, arrows). The firing of cells recorded on one example tetrode, marked by a red arrow in Figure 3A, is shown in Figure 3B. Simultaneous recording of both response types near layer boundaries is expected, as multiple cell types would be within the recording area of the tetrode. Since it is unlikely that a granule cell would be recorded near the hilus/CA3 border, the presence of cells active in all rooms on the hilus/CA3 tetrodes further supports the conclusion that multiple-field cells correspond to cells in the hilus rather than granule cells. Reconstruction of tetrode location based solely on histology is insufficient to reliably assign cell identity to all cells on a tetrode (Neunuebel and Knierim, 2012Neunuebel J.P. Knierim J.J. Spatial firing correlates of physiologically distinct cell types of the rat dentate gyrus.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 3848-3858Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Due to the proximity of the hilus to the GCL and CA3, small amounts of electrode drift between recording and perfusion can result in inaccurate classification. In addition, cells in the hilus, such as mossy cells, can be recorded on electrodes up to 300 microns apart (Henze and Buzsáki, 2007Henze D.A. Buzsáki G. Hilar mossy cells: functional identification and activity in vivo.Prog. Brain Res. 2007; 163: 199-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and some tetrodes may simultaneously record cells from the hilus and either the GCL or CA3 (Figure 3). Our initial analysis minimized these issues by excluding cells recorded on days preceding the day of perfusion and on tetrodes located near area boundaries. To improve the accuracy of histological classification and assign putative cell types to the larger dataset, we used firing properties recorded during the baseline sleep/rest sessions of our initial dataset of 88 cells to train a random forests classifier (Breiman, 2001Breiman L. Random forests.Mach. Learn. 2001; 45: 5-32Crossref Scopus (65007) Google Scholar; Figure S4; STAR Methods). This classification technique was chosen because it is more resistant to overfitting relative to other supervised learning methods, and it generates an estimate of the classifier’s generalization error (the “out of bag” [OOB] error rate) without the need for additional cross-validation steps. We trained the model using spiking and histological features of the initial dataset (i.e., Figure 2 data) recorded during the post-behavior sleep session (Figure S4). The classifier learned to accurately assign the training set to the experimenter-defined histological regions, with an OOB error rate of 5.7% (Figure S4D). We used the trained classifier to assign cell layers to the larger dataset of 242 cells from all tetrodes with the largest number of recorded cells per day (Figure 3 data). The model classified 112 cells as GCL, 33 cells as hilus, and 97 cells as CA3 recordings. Although the class labels of the training data were based on histology alone, and the features used for random forests classification did not include any firing properties of cells recorded during foraging sessions, the spatial firing properties of the classified cells during foraging sessions (Figure 4) were very similar to the firing properties of the cells recorded on histologically unambiguous tetrodes on the final day (Figures 2A and 2B; Table S1). This consistency reinforced the robust differences in the spatial firing properties among the cell classes. Although some of the cells used for training were also included in the larger dataset, similar results were produced when we restricted classification to only cells recorded on tetrodes not used for training (Figures S5A–S5D). These results were not driven by any individual animals, as the firing properties of classified cells were consistent across all animals (Figure S5E). Finally, K-means clustering using the number of active rooms and total number of fields revealed two clusters that separated between hilus recordings and combined CA3 and GCL recordings (Figures S4F–S4I). The outputs of these two models generated the same class label for ∼92% of cells (Figure S4I), suggesting that the random forests classifier is able to accurately detect patterns of activity in the sleep data that correspond to cells with distinct clusters of spatial firing properties. Although the extracellular recordings analyzed above are highly likely to correspond to the excitatory cell types in the GCL, hilus, and CA3c region (i.e., granule cells, mossy cells, and pyramidal cells, respectively), direct evidence from identified cells would add additional support to this identification. We thus recorded and labeled single cells with juxtacellular procedures (Tang et al., 2014Tang Q. Brecht M. Burgalossi A. Juxtacellular recording and morphological identification of single neurons in freely moving rats.Nat. Protoc. 2014; 9: 2369-2381Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) as well-trained rats foraged for food reward on a square platform (95 × 95 cm). We only attempted to label cells that were active when rats were running on the platform; thus, these data do not provide any measures of the proportion of active cells in any region. Electrodes were often advanced through the entire GCL without encountering an active GC, consistent with the extremely sparse firing of putative granule cells observed in our tetrode recordings. Of 46 juxtacellular recording and labeling attempts (including attempts in neocortex and CA1 to establish the technique), 30 cells were recovered without ambiguity, including 23 cells in the hippocampus: 8 granule cells, 3 mossy cells, 3 CA3 pyramidal cells, 1 hilar interneuron, 6 CA1 pyramidal cells, 1 putative interneuron in the GCL, and 1 putative interneuron in CA1. We concentrate on the granule cells and mossy cells here, but all recorded hippocampal cells are presented in Data S1. All identified granule cells (4 in the upper blade and 4 in the lower blade of the GCL) had a single firing field in the environment tested (Figures 5A, 5D, and 5G ; Data S1A). The average peak rate of the granule cells was 6.44 ± 1.25 Hz (Figure S6). The peak rates and spatial firing fields were similar to the identified GCL recordings from the tetrode data (Figure 1; Data S1). Consistent with observations from other laboratories (Andrea Burgalossi and Michael Brecht, personal communication) and possibly due to their known vulnerability to cytochemical and mechanical stress (Sloviter et al., 2003Sloviter R.S.

Neural Circuits. 2013; 6: 106Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), it was particularly difficult to label and recover the full morphology of mossy cells in freely moving rats. Instead, we used GluR2/3 as a marker to confirm the identity of the mossy cells, as mossy cells are the only cell type in the hilus to express this marker (Leranth et al., 1996Leranth C. Szeidemann Z. Hsu M. Buzsáki G.

A role for hilar cells in pattern separation in the dentate gyrus: a computational approach.Hippocampus. 2009; 19: 321-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). For the cell shown in Figure 6A, which is positive for GluR2/3, the somato-dendritic morphology could be recovered and was typical of a mossy cell. The other two hilar cells (Figures 6D and 6G) were also positive for GluR2/3. Additionally, the soma diameters of these two cells (∼20 μm, similar to the mossy cell in Figure 6A) were larger than the identified granule cells (∼10 μm), providing further evidence that the recorded cells are mossy cells rather than the extremely rare ectopic granule cells in the hilus. Of the three recorded and labeled mossy cells, two had multiple place fields, and one had a single field (Figure 6). The single-field mossy cell is consistent with tetrode recordings from the hilus, where cells had single fields in 20%–30% of foraging sessions (Figure 2B). In addition, we recorded two more cells in the hilus but failed to label the recorded cells (Data S1C). The end of the electrode tracks were in the hilus (arrows in Data S1C), and a depos"
https://openalex.org/W2583012620,"Social behaviors require neural circuits to process social cues and orchestrate motivational states. This study identifies a subpopulation of hypothalamic neurons expressing neurotensin that are engaged by social and hormonal signals. These neurons project to midbrain dopaminergic reward systems to promote and reinforce social and motivated behavior in a hormone-sensitive manner. Neural networks that control reproduction must integrate social and hormonal signals, tune motivation, and coordinate social interactions. However, the neural circuit mechanisms for these processes remain unresolved. The medial preoptic area (mPOA), an essential node for social behaviors, comprises molecularly diverse neurons with widespread projections. Here we identify a steroid-responsive subset of neurotensin (Nts)-expressing mPOA neurons that interface with the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to form a socially engaged reward circuit. Using in vivo two-photon imaging in female mice, we show that mPOANts neurons preferentially encode attractive male cues compared to nonsocial appetitive stimuli. Ovarian hormone signals regulate both the physiological and cue-encoding properties of these cells. Furthermore, optogenetic stimulation of mPOANts–VTA circuitry promotes rewarding phenotypes, social approach and striatal dopamine release. Collectively, these data demonstrate that steroid-sensitive mPOA neurons encode ethologically relevant stimuli and co-opt midbrain reward circuits to promote prosocial behaviors critical for species survival."
https://openalex.org/W2581467944,"Developmental tumors in children and young adults carry few genetic alterations, yet they have diverse clinical presentation. Focusing on Ewing sarcoma, we sought to establish the prevalence and characteristics of epigenetic heterogeneity in genetically homogeneous cancers. We performed genome-scale DNA methylation sequencing for a large cohort of Ewing sarcoma tumors and analyzed epigenetic heterogeneity on three levels: between cancers, between tumors, and within tumors. We observed consistent DNA hypomethylation at enhancers regulated by the disease-defining EWS-FLI1 fusion protein, thus establishing epigenomic enhancer reprogramming as a ubiquitous and characteristic feature of Ewing sarcoma. DNA methylation differences between tumors identified a continuous disease spectrum underlying Ewing sarcoma, which reflected the strength of an EWS-FLI1 regulatory signature and a continuum between mesenchymal and stem cell signatures. There was substantial epigenetic heterogeneity within tumors, particularly in patients with metastatic disease. In summary, our study provides a comprehensive assessment of epigenetic heterogeneity in Ewing sarcoma and thereby highlights the importance of considering nongenetic aspects of tumor heterogeneity in the context of cancer biology and personalized medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2580257691,"Ewing sarcoma is characterized by the expression of the chimeric EWSR1-FLI1 transcription factor. Proteomic analyses indicate that the decrease of EWSR1-FLI1 expression leads to major changes in effectors of the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton and the adhesion processes with a shift from cell-to-cell to cell-matrix adhesion. These changes are associated with a dramatic increase of in vivo cell migration and invasion potential. Importantly, EWSR1-FLI1 expression, evaluated by single-cell RT-ddPCR/immunofluorescence analyses, and activity, assessed by expression of EWSR1-FLI1 downstream targets, are heterogeneous in cell lines and in tumours and can fluctuate along time in a fully reversible process between EWSR1-FLI1high states, characterized by highly active cell proliferation, and EWSR1-FLI1low states where cells have a strong propensity to migrate, invade and metastasize. This new model of phenotypic plasticity proposes that the dynamic fluctuation of the expression level of a dominant oncogene is an intrinsic characteristic of its oncogenic potential."

Here, we have used two-photon Ca2+ imaging to monitor the activity of mossy cells in awake, behaving mice. We find that mossy cells are significantly more active than dentate granule cells in vivo, exhibit spatial tuning during head-fixed spatial navigation, and undergo robust remapping of their spatial representations in response to contextual manipulation. Our results provide a functional characterization of mossy cells in the behaving animal and demonstrate their active participation in spatial coding and contextual representation."
https://openalex.org/W2582329608,"David Page and colleagues report the sequence of the chicken W sex chromosome and compare ancestral W-linked genes across bird species. They find that the W chromosome did not acquire genes expressed exclusively in reproductive tissue, but retained genes through selection to maintain appropriate dosage levels of broadly expressed genes. After birds diverged from mammals, different ancestral autosomes evolved into sex chromosomes in each lineage. In birds, females are ZW and males are ZZ, but in mammals females are XX and males are XY. We sequenced the chicken W chromosome, compared its gene content with our reconstruction of the ancestral autosomes, and followed the evolutionary trajectory of ancestral W-linked genes across birds. Avian W chromosomes evolved in parallel with mammalian Y chromosomes, preserving ancestral genes through selection to maintain the dosage of broadly expressed regulators of key cellular processes. We propose that, like the human Y chromosome, the chicken W chromosome is essential for embryonic viability of the heterogametic sex. Unlike other sequenced sex chromosomes, the chicken W chromosome did not acquire and amplify genes specifically expressed in reproductive tissues. We speculate that the pressures that drive the acquisition of reproduction-related genes on sex chromosomes may be specific to the male germ line."
https://openalex.org/W2582658728,"Overlearning refers to the continued training of a skill after performance improvement has plateaued. Whether overlearning is beneficial is a question in our daily lives that has never been clearly answered. Here we report a new important role: overlearning in humans abruptly changes neurochemical processing, to hyperstabilize and protect trained perceptual learning from subsequent new learning. Usually, learning immediately after training is so unstable that it can be disrupted by subsequent new learning until after passive stabilization occurs hours later. However, overlearning so rapidly and strongly stabilizes the learning state that it not only becomes resilient against, but also disrupts, subsequent new learning. Such hyperstabilization is associated with an abrupt shift from glutamate-dominant excitatory to GABA-dominant inhibitory processing in early visual areas. Hyperstabilization contrasts with passive and slower stabilization, which is associated with a mere reduction of excitatory dominance to baseline levels. Using hyperstabilization may lead to efficient learning paradigms."

There are no disease-altering therapies for dry AMD, which is characterized by accumulation of subretinal drusen deposits and complement-driven inflammation. We report the derivation of human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) from patients with diagnosed AMD, including two donors with the rare ARMS2/HTRA1 homozygous genotype. The hiPSC-derived RPE cells produce several AMD/drusen-related proteins, and those from the AMD donors show significantly increased complement and inflammatory factors, which are most exaggerated in the ARMS2/HTRA1 lines. Using a panel of AMD biomarkers and candidate drug screening, combined with transcriptome analysis, we discover that nicotinamide (NAM) ameliorated disease-related phenotypes by inhibiting drusen proteins and inflammatory and complement factors while upregulating nucleosome, ribosome, and chromatin-modifying genes. Thus, targeting NAM-regulated pathways is a promising avenue for developing therapeutics to combat AMD."
https://openalex.org/W2582265733,"Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations frequently cause neurological diseases. Modeling of these defects has been difficult because of the challenges associated with engineering mtDNA.

NPCs derived in this way from patients carrying a deleterious homoplasmic mutation in the mitochondrial gene MT-ATP6 (m.9185T>C) showed defective ATP production and abnormally high mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), plus altered calcium homeostasis, which represents a potential cause of neural impairment. High-content screening of FDA-approved drugs using the MMP phenotype highlighted avanafil, which we found was able to partially rescue the calcium defect in patient NPCs and differentiated neurons. Overall, our results show that iPSC-derived NPCs provide an effective model for drug screening to target mtDNA disorders that affect the nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2582950460,"The molecular composition of the postsynaptic membrane is sculpted by synaptic activity. During synaptic plasticity at excitatory synapses, numerous structural, signaling, and receptor molecules concentrate at the postsynaptic density (PSD) to regulate synaptic strength. We developed an approach that uses light to tune the abundance of specific molecules in the PSD. We used this approach to investigate the relationship between the number of AMPA-type glutamate receptors in the PSD and synaptic strength. Surprisingly, adding more AMPA receptors to excitatory contacts had little effect on synaptic strength. Instead, we observed increased excitatory input through the apparent addition of new functional sites. Our data support a model where adding AMPA receptors is sufficient to activate synapses that had few receptors to begin with, but that additional remodeling events are required to strengthen established synapses. More broadly, this approach introduces the precise spatiotemporal control of optogenetics to the molecular control of synaptic function."

They show that these introgressed regions are enriched for genes involved in nervous system development and function, supporting the idea that introgressive hybridization contributed to the improvement of yak management and breeding. The yak is remarkable for its adaptation to high altitude and occupies a central place in the economies of the mountainous regions of Asia. At lower elevations, it is common to hybridize yaks with cattle to combine the yak's hardiness with the productivity of cattle. Hybrid males are sterile, however, preventing the establishment of stable hybrid populations, but not a limited introgression after backcrossing several generations of female hybrids to male yaks. Here we inferred bovine haplotypes in the genomes of 76 Mongolian yaks using high-density SNP genotyping and whole-genome sequencing. These yaks inherited ∼1.3% of their genome from bovine ancestors after nearly continuous admixture over at least the last 1,500 years. The introgressed regions are enriched in genes involved in nervous system development and function, and particularly in glutamate metabolism and neurotransmission. We also identified a novel mutation associated with a polled (hornless) phenotype originating from Mongolian Turano cattle. Our results suggest that introgressive hybridization contributed to the improvement of yak management and breeding."

https://openalex.org/W2580597002,"Random Positioning Machines (RPMs) are widely used as tools to simulate microgravity on ground. They consist of two gimbal mounted frames, which constantly rotate biological samples around two perpendicular axes and thus distribute the Earth's gravity vector in all directions over time. In recent years, the RPM is increasingly becoming appreciated as a laboratory instrument also in non-space-related research. For instance, it can be applied for the formation of scaffold-free spheroid cell clusters. The kinematic rotation of the RPM, however, does not only distribute the gravity vector in such a way that it averages to zero, but it also introduces local forces to the cell culture. These forces can be described by rigid body analysis. Although RPMs are commonly used in laboratories, the fluid motion in the cell culture flasks on the RPM and the possible effects of such on cells have not been examined until today; thus, such aspects have been widely neglected. In this study, we used a numerical approach to describe the fluid dynamic characteristic occurring inside a cell culture flask turning on an operating RPM. The simulations showed that the fluid motion within the cell culture flask never reached a steady state or neared a steady state condition. The fluid velocity depends on the rotational velocity of the RPM and is in the order of a few centimeters per second. The highest shear stresses are found along the flask walls; depending of the rotational velocity, they can reach up to a few 100 mPa. The shear stresses in the ""bulk volume,"" however, are always smaller, and their magnitude is in the order of 10 mPa. In conclusion, RPMs are highly appreciated as reliable tools in microgravity research. They have even started to become useful instruments in new research fields of mechanobiology. Depending on the experiment, the fluid dynamic on the RPM cannot be neglected and needs to be taken into consideration. The results presented in this study elucidate the fluid motion and provide insight into the convection and shear stresses that occur inside a cell culture flask during RPM experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2580384406,"Defining the large-scale behavior of brain circuits with cell type specificity is a major goal of neuroscience. However, neuronal circuit diagrams typically draw upon anatomical and electrophysiological measurements acquired in isolation. Consequently, a dynamic and cell-type-specific connectivity map has never been constructed from simultaneous measurements across the brain. Here, we introduce dynamic causal modeling (DCM) for optogenetic fMRI experiments-which uniquely allow cell-type-specific, brain-wide functional measurements-to parameterize the causal relationships among regions of a distributed brain network with cell type specificity. Strikingly, when applied to the brain-wide basal ganglia-thalamocortical network, DCM accurately reproduced the empirically observed time series, and the strongest connections were key connections of optogenetically stimulated pathways. We predict that quantitative and cell-type-specific descriptions of dynamic connectivity, as illustrated here, will empower novel systems-level understanding of neuronal circuit dynamics and facilitate the design of more effective neuromodulation therapies."

https://openalex.org/W2582508801,"Unequal centrosome maturation correlates with asymmetric division in multiple cell types. Nevertheless, centrosomal fate determinants have yet to be identified. Here, we show that the Notch pathway regulator Mindbomb1 co-localizes asymmetrically with centriolar satellite proteins PCM1 and AZI1 at the daughter centriole in interphase. Remarkably, while PCM1 and AZI1 remain asymmetric during mitosis, Mindbomb1 is associated with either one or both spindle poles. Asymmetric Mindbomb1 correlates with neurogenic divisions and Mindbomb1 is inherited by the prospective neuron. By contrast, in proliferative divisions, a supplementary pool of Mindbomb1 associated with the Golgi apparatus in interphase is released during mitosis and compensates for Mindbomb1 centrosomal asymmetry. Finally, we show that preventing Mindbomb1 centrosomal association induces reciprocal Notch activation between sister cells and promotes symmetric divisions. Thus, we uncover a link between differential centrosome maturation and Notch signaling and reveal an unexpected compensatory mechanism involving the Golgi apparatus in restoring symmetry in proliferative divisions."

A set of transcriptional repressors of E-cadherin (CDH1) gene expression, including Snail1, Snail2 and Zeb2 mediate E-cadherin downregulation in breast cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the control of E-cadherin expression in breast cancer progression remain largely unknown. Here, by using global gene expression approaches, we uncover a novel function for Cdc42 GTPase-activating protein (CdGAP) in the regulation of expression of genes involved in EMT. We found that CdGAP used its proline-rich domain to form a functional complex with Zeb2 to mediate the repression of E-cadherin expression in ErbB2-transformed breast cancer cells. Conversely, knockdown of CdGAP expression led to a decrease of the transcriptional repressors Snail1 and Zeb2, and this correlated with an increase in E-cadherin levels, restoration of cell–cell junctions, and epithelial-like morphological changes. In vivo, loss of CdGAP in ErbB2-transformed breast cancer cells impaired tumor growth and suppressed metastasis to lungs. Finally, CdGAP was highly expressed in basal-type breast cancer cells, and its strong expression correlated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. Together, these data support a previously unknown nuclear function for CdGAP where it cooperates in a GAP-independent manner with transcriptional repressors to function as a critical modulator of breast cancer through repression of E-cadherin transcription. Targeting Zeb2–CdGAP interactions may represent novel therapeutic opportunities for breast cancer treatment."

There is little knowledge about the effect of insulin on the decidualization process and previous findings are contradictory. We investigated the effect of insulin on the regulation of forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1), one of the most important transcription factors during decidualization. Endometrial stromal cells were isolated from six healthy, regularly menstruating women and decidualized in vitro. Gene expression levels of six putative FOXO1 target genes (including insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP1) and prolactin (PRL)) were measured with Real-Time PCR following FOXO1 inhibition or insulin treatment. PI3K inhibition was used to identify the possible mechanism behind regulation. Subcellular localization of FOXO1 was analyzed with immunofluorescence. All the genes (IGFBP1, CTGF, INSR, DCN, LEFTY2), except prolactin, were evaluated as FOXO1 target genes in decidualizing stromal cells. Insulin caused a significant dose-dependent inhibition of the verified FOXO1 target genes. It was also demonstrated that insulin regulated FOXO1 target genes by transcriptional inactivation and nuclear export of FOXO1 via PI3K pathway. However, insulin did not inhibit the morphological transformation of endometrial stromal cells via transcriptional inactivation of FOXO1. This study provides new insights on the action of insulin on the endometrium via regulation of FOXO1. It is suggested that hyperinsulinemia results in dysregulation of a high number of FOXO1 controlled genes that may contribute to endometrial dysfunction and reproductive failure. Our findings may illuminate possible reasons for unexplained infertility."

Unfortunately, prolonged MV results in the rapid development of diaphragmatic atrophy and weakness. Importantly, endurance exercise training results in a diaphragmatic phenotype that is protected against ventilator-induced diaphragmatic atrophy and weakness. The mechanisms responsible for this exercise-induced protection against ventilator-induced diaphragmatic atrophy remain unknown. Therefore, to investigate exercise-induced changes in diaphragm muscle proteins, we compared the diaphragmatic proteome from sedentary and exercise-trained rats. Specifically, using label-free liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, we performed a proteomics analysis of both soluble proteins and mitochondrial proteins isolated from diaphragm muscle. The total number of diaphragm proteins profiled in the soluble protein fraction and mitochondrial protein fraction were 813 and 732, respectively. Endurance exercise training significantly (P<0.05, FDR <10%) altered the abundance of 70 proteins in the soluble diaphragm proteome and 25 proteins of the mitochondrial proteome. In particular, key cytoprotective proteins that increased in relative abundance following exercise training included mitochondrial fission process 1 (Mtfp1; MTP18), 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3MPST), microsomal glutathione S-transferase 3 (Mgst3; GST-III), and heat shock protein 70 kDa protein 1A/1B (HSP70). While these proteins are known to be cytoprotective in several cell types, the cyto-protective roles of these proteins have yet to be fully elucidated in diaphragm muscle fibers. Based upon these important findings, future experiments can now determine which of these diaphragmatic proteins are sufficient and/or required to promote exercise-induced protection against inactivity-induced muscle atrophy."

We aimed to determine if KMMS is a valid and acceptable method of identifying Kimberley Aboriginal perinatal women at risk of anxiety or depressive disorders compared to a semi-structured clinical interview.Across 15 sites in the Kimberley, Western Australia, 97 Aboriginal women aged 16 years and older who intended to continue with their pregnancy or had a baby within the previous 12 months were administered the KMMS by trained healthcare providers who provided an overall assessment of no, low, moderate or high risk; 91 participants were then independently assessed by a blinded clinical expert using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition criteria. A qualitative approach was used to determine KMMS' acceptability.Part 1 had high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha, 0.89), and overall KMMS risk equivalence for screening for anxiety or depressive disorders was moderate (sensitivity, 83%; specificity, 87%; positive predictive value, 68%). Participants found the process easy and useful, and healthcare providers found KMMS more useful than EPDS. Part 2 allowed healthcare providers to ask questions that gave participants an opportunity to express themselves, resulting in a deeper understanding between them.KMMS is an effective tool for identifying Kimberley Aboriginal perinatal women at risk of anxiety and depressive disorders. Adoption of KMMS with culturally safe training and support is likely to improve screening processes, and with further validation may have broader applicability across remote Australia."

Poly I:C, when used as an adjuvant, improves humoral and cellular immunity in many animals but has not been tested in ducks. In this study, we investigated the protective efficacy of Poly I:C as an adjuvant for an inactivated H9N2 Avian influenza vaccine in ducks. We found that an H9N2 vaccine administered with poly I:C (H9-PIC vaccine) induced a significantly more rapid response with higher anti-influenza antibody titers than those of the vaccine alone (H9 vaccine). Moreover, virus shedding was reduced in ducks immunized with the H9-PIC vaccine after challenge with an H9 subtype antigenic variant viruses. IFN-α, IFN-γ, IL-6 and MHC-II mRNA levels were all elevated in ducks receiving the H9-PIC vaccine. In addition, lower expression level of MHC-I may be a reason for inefficient protective ability against heterologous influenza viruses in H9-PIC vaccination of ducks. In conclusion, poly I:C adjuvant enhanced both humoral and cellular immune responses in ducks induced by immunization of inactivated H9N2 vaccine."

We test the method on a dataset of 10 million roaming mobile phone users in a European country. The average prediction accuracy is significantly higher than that of individual sequence prediction algorithms, primarily constant order Markov models derived from the user's own data, that have been shown to achieve high accuracy in previous studies of human mobility.

However, due to reduced coverage of poly(A) tails by reads, poly(A) reads are not routinely identified during RNA-seq mapping. Nevertheless, recent studies for several herpesviruses successfully employed mapping of poly(A) reads to identify herpesvirus poly(A) sites using different strategies and customized programs. To more easily allow such analyses without requiring additional programs, we integrated poly(A) read mapping and prediction of poly(A) sites into our RNA-seq mapping program ContextMap 2. The implemented approach essentially generalizes previously used poly(A) read mapping approaches and combines them with the context-based approach of ContextMap 2 to take into account information provided by other reads aligned to the same location. Poly(A) read mapping using ContextMap 2 was evaluated on real-life data from the ENCODE project and compared against a competing approach based on transcriptome assembly (KLEAT). This showed high positive predictive value for our approach, evidenced also by the presence of poly(A) signals, and considerably lower runtime than KLEAT. Although sensitivity is low for both methods, we show that this is in part due to a high extent of spurious results in the gold standard set derived from RNA-PET data. Sensitivity improves for poly(A) sites of known transcripts or determined with a more specific poly(A) sequencing protocol and increases with read coverage on transcript ends. Finally, we illustrate the usefulness of the approach in a high read coverage scenario by a re-analysis of published data for herpes simplex virus 1. Thus, with current trends towards increasing sequencing depth and read length, poly(A) read mapping will prove to be increasingly useful and can now be performed automatically during RNA-seq mapping with ContextMap 2."

However, little is known about the synthesis of optically active phycoerythrinin in G. lemaneiformis at the molecular level. With the advent of high-throughput sequencing technology, analysis of genetic information for G. lemaneiformis by transcriptome sequencing is an effective means to get a deeper insight into the molecular mechanism of phycoerythrin synthesis. Illumina technology was employed to sequence the transcriptome of two strains of G. lemaneiformis- the wild type and a green-pigmented mutant. We obtained a total of 86915 assembled unigenes as a reference gene set, and 42884 unigenes were annotated in at least one public database. Taking the above transcriptome sequencing as a reference gene set, 4041 differentially expressed genes were screened to analyze and compare the gene expression profiles of the wild type and green mutant. By GO and KEGG pathway analysis, we concluded that three factors, including a reduction in the expression level of apo-phycoerythrin, an increase of chlorophyll light-harvesting complex synthesis, and reduction of phycoerythrobilin by competitive inhibition, caused the reduction of optically active phycoerythrin in the green-pigmented mutant."
https://openalex.org/W2580823173,"The highly mutagenic A:8-oxoguanine (oxoG) base pair is generated mainly by misreplication of the C:oxoG base pair, the oxidation product of the C:G base pair. The A:oxoG base pair is particularly insidious because neither base in it carries faithful information to direct the repair of the other. The bacterial MutY (MUTYH in humans) adenine DNA glycosylase is able to initiate the repair of A:oxoG by selectively cleaving the A base from the A:oxoG base pair. The difference between faithful repair and wreaking mutagenic havoc on the genome lies in the accurate discrimination between two structurally similar base pairs: A:oxoG and A:T. Here we present two crystal structures of the MutY N-terminal domain in complex with either undamaged DNA or DNA containing an intrahelical lesion. These structures have captured for the first time a DNA glycosylase scanning the genome for a damaged base in the very first stage of lesion recognition and the base extrusion pathway. The mode of interaction observed here has suggested a common lesion-scanning mechanism across the entire helix-hairpin-helix superfamily to which MutY belongs. In addition, small angle X-ray scattering studies together with accompanying biochemical assays have suggested a possible role played by the C-terminal oxoG-recognition domain of MutY in lesion scanning.

https://openalex.org/W2582805875,"Background Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is one of the most serious acute complications of type 1 diabetes (T1D) and the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children with T1D. This study was aimed at assessing the prevalence and associated factors of DKA in children with newly diagnosed T1D in Addis Ababa. Methods A hospital based cross-sectional study was conducted in selected hospitals in Addis Ababa. Children below the age of 12 years with DKA who were admitted to the pediatric ward in the selected hospitals between January 2009 and December 2014 and the residence of Addis Ababa were included. DKA was defined as children below the age of 12 years who have blood glucose level ≥250mg/dl, ketonuria, and ketonemia and diagnosed being T1D patient for the first time. Descriptive statistics was performed using frequency distribution, mean, median, tables, and graphs. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent factors associated with the prevalence of DKA in children with newly diagnosed T1D. Results Of 395 DKA patients who were hospitalized during the five-year period, 142(35.8%) presented with DKA at first diagnosis of diabetes. On the other hand 253 (64.2%) children with DKA had longstanding T1D. Independent factors associated with DKA include: Age category 2–4.49years, 7–9.49 years and ≥9.5years (Adjusted odd ratio (AOR) = 3.14[1.21,8.06]), 3.44(1.39,8.49) and 4.02(1.68,9.60), respectively); parents’ knowledge on the sign and symptoms of DKA (AOR = 0.51[0.27, 0.95]); sign and symptoms of DKA before the onset of DKA (AOR = 0.35[0.21, 0.59]) and infection prior to DKA onset (AOR = 3.45[1.97, 6.04]). Conclusions The overall proportion of children diagnosed with DKA and new onset of T1D in Addis Ababa was high. In particular, children between 9–12 years of age and children whose parents did not know the sign and symptoms of DKA had a high risk of DKA at primary diagnosis of T1D."
https://openalex.org/W2582870488,"Alternative islet transplantation sites have the potential to reduce the marginal number of islets required to ameliorate hyperglycemia in recipients with diabetes. Previously, we reported that T cell leukemia homeobox 1 (Tlx1)+ stem cells in the spleen effectively regenerated into insulin-producing cells in the pancreas of non-obese diabetic mice with end-stage disease. Thus, we investigated the spleen as a potential alternative islet transplantation site. Streptozotocin-induced diabetic C57BL/6 mice received syngeneic islets into the portal vein (PV), beneath the kidney capsule (KC), or into the spleen (SP). The marginal number of islets by PV, KC, or SP was 200, 100, and 50, respectively. Some plasma inflammatory cytokine levels in the SP group were significantly lower than those of the PV group after receiving a marginal number of islets, indicating reduced inflammation in the SP group. Insulin contents were increased 280 days after islet transplantation compared with those immediately following transplantation (p<0.05). Additionally, Tlx1-related genes, including Rrm2b and Pla2g2d, were up-regulated, which indicates that islet grafts expanded in the spleen. The spleen is an ideal candidate for an alternative islet transplantation site because of the resulting reduced inflammation and expansion of the islet graft."
https://openalex.org/W2580992196,"Gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM) is a precancerous lesion of the stomach. The detection of GIM using conventional white-light endoscopy (WLE) is difficult. In this study, we determined whether acetic acid-enhanced narrow band imaging (AA-NBI) improves the detection of GIM. A consecutive cohort of 132 individuals aged 40 years or older was subjected to upper gastrointestinal endoscopy using WLE, NBI and AA-NBI. The ability of the three methods to diagnose GIM in patients was compared. Histological assessment (per-patient and per-biopsy) was used for the accuracy assessment. Sixty-six (50.0%) out of the 132 individuals examined were found to have GIM, of which 44 (66.7%) were diagnosed correctly by NBI (sensitivity 66.7% and specificity 68.2%) and 58 (87.9%) were correctly identified by AA–NBI (sensitivity 87.9% and specificity 68.2%), as compared to only 22 (33.3%) by WLE (sensitivity 33.3% and specificity 28.8%). Therefore, the sensitivity of AA–NBI in the diagnosis of GIM was significantly higher than NBI (p<0.05) and WLE (p < 0.001). Our study indicates that AA-NBI can improve the accuracy of endoscopy-targeted biopsies for GIM."
https://openalex.org/W2581690086,"Several studies on global change over the next century predict increases in mean air temperatures of between 1°C to 5°C that would affect not only water temperature but also river flow. Climate is the predominant environmental driver of thermal and flow regimes of freshwater ecosystems, determining survival, growth, metabolism, phenology and behaviour as well as biotic interactions of aquatic fauna. Thus, these changes would also have consequences for species phenology, their distribution range, and the composition and dynamics of communities. These effects are expected to be especially severe in the Mediterranean basin due its particular climate conditions, seriously threatening Southern European ecosystems. In addition, species with restricted distributions and narrow ecological requirements, such as those living in the headwaters of rivers, will be severely affected. The study area corresponds to the Spanish Mediterranean and Balearic Islands, delimited by the Köppen climate boundary. With the application of the MEDPACS (MEDiterranean Prediction And Classification System) predictive approach, the macroinvertebrate community was predicted for current conditions and compared with three posible scenarios of watertemperature increase and its associated water flow reductions. The results indicate that the aquatic macroinvertebrate communities will undergo a drastic impact, with reductions in taxa richness for each scenario in relation to simulated current conditions, accompanied by changes in the taxa distribution pattern. Accordingly, the distribution area of most of the taxa (65.96%) inhabiting the mid-high elevations would contract and rise in altitude. Thus, families containing a great number of generalist species will move upstream to colonize new zones with lower water temperatures. By contrast, more vulnerable taxa will undergo reductions in their distribution area."
https://openalex.org/W2580469007,"Motor systems are highly adaptive. Both birds and humans compensate for synthetically induced shifts in the pitch (fundamental frequency) of auditory feedback stemming from their vocalizations. Pitch-shift compensation is partial in the sense that large shifts lead to smaller relative compensatory adjustments of vocal pitch than small shifts. Also, compensation is larger in subjects with high motor variability. To formulate a mechanistic description of these findings, we adapt a Bayesian model of error relevance. We assume that vocal-auditory feedback loops in the brain cope optimally with known sensory and motor variability. Based on measurements of motor variability, optimal compensatory responses in our model provide accurate fits to published experimental data. Optimal compensation correctly predicts sensory acuity, which has been estimated in psychophysical experiments as just-noticeable pitch differences. Our model extends the utility of Bayesian approaches to adaptive vocal behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2582607545,"Genetic differentiation in historically connected populations could be the result of genetic drift or adaptation, two processes that imply a need for differing strategies in population management. The aim of our study was to use neutral genetic markers to characterize C. pyrenaica populations genetically and examine results in terms of (i) demographic history, (ii) subspecific classification and (iii) the implications for the management of Iberian ibex.We used 30 neutral microsatellite markers from 333 Iberian ibex to explore genetic diversity in the three main Iberian ibex populations in Spain corresponding to the two persisting subspecies (victoria and hispanica). Our molecular analyses detected recent genetic bottlenecks in all the studied populations, a finding that coincides with the documented demographic decline in C. pyrenaica in recent decades. Genetic divergence between the two C. pyrenaica subspecies (hispanica and victoriae) was substantial (FST between 0.39 and 0.47). Unexpectedly, we found similarly high genetic differentiation between two populations (Sierra Nevada and Maestrazgo) belonging to the subspecies hispanica. The genetic pattern identified in our study could be the result of strong genetic drift due to the severe genetic bottlenecks in the studied populations, caused in turn by the progressive destruction of natural habitat, disease epidemics and/or uncontrolled hunting.Previous Capra pyrenaica conservation decision-making was based on the clear distinction between the two subspecies (victoriae and hispanica); yet our paper raises questions about the usefulness for conservation plans of the distinction between these subspecies."

https://openalex.org/W2581104961,"Conservation of biodiversity is determined in part by human preferences. Preferences relevant to conservation have been examined largely via explicit measures (e.g., a self-reported degree of liking), with implicit measures (e.g., preconscious, automatic evaluations) receiving relatively less attention. This is the case despite psychological evidence from other contexts that implicit preferences are more informative of behavior. Thus, the type of measure that predicts conservation intentions for biodiversity is unknown. We conducted three studies to examine conservation intentions in light of people's explicit and implicit preferences toward four endangered species (sea otter, American badger, caribou, yellow-breasted chat) and four biomes (forest, ocean, grassland, tundra). In Study 1 (n = 55), we found that people implicitly preferred caribou most, but explicitly preferred sea otter most, with a significant multiple regression where participants' explicit preferences dictated their stated intended donations for conservation of each species. In Study 2 (n = 57) we found that people implicitly and explicitly preferred forest and ocean over grassland and tundra. Explicit rather than implicit preferences predicted the intended donation for conservation of the ocean biome. Study 3 involved a broader online sample of participants (n = 463) and also found that explicit preferences dictated the intended donations for conservation of biomes and species. Our findings reveal discrepancies between implicit and explicit preferences toward species, but not toward biomes. Importantly, the results demonstrate that explicit rather than implicit preferences predict conservation intentions for biodiversity. The current findings have several implications for conservation and the communication of biodiversity initiatives."
https://openalex.org/W2580377372,"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs), which consist of a large number of sensor nodes, have become among the most important technologies in numerous fields, such as environmental monitoring, military surveillance, control systems in nuclear reactors, vehicle safety systems, and medical monitoring. The most serious drawback for the widespread application of WSNs is the lack of security. Given the resource limitation of WSNs, traditional security schemes are unsuitable. Approaches toward withstanding related attacks with small overhead have thus recently been studied by many researchers. Numerous studies have focused on the authentication scheme for WSNs, but most of these works cannot achieve the security performance and overhead perfectly. Nam et al. proposed a two-factor authentication scheme with lightweight sensor computation for WSNs. In this paper, we review this scheme, emphasize its drawbacks, and propose a temporal credential-based mutual authentication with a multiple-password scheme for WSNs. Our scheme uses multiple passwords to achieve three-factor security performance and generate a session key between user and sensor nodes. The security analysis phase shows that our scheme can withstand related attacks, including a lost password threat, and the comparison phase shows that our scheme involves a relatively small overhead. In the comparison of the overhead phase, the result indicates that more than 95% of the overhead is composed of communication and not computation overhead. Therefore, the result motivates us to pay further attention to communication overhead than computation overhead in future research."
https://openalex.org/W2580734691,"Social interaction starts with perception of the world around you. This study investigated two fundamental issues regarding the development of discrimination of higher spatial frequencies, which are important building blocks of perception. Firstly, it mapped the typical developmental trajectory of higher spatial frequency discrimination. Secondly, it developed and validated a novel design that could be applied to improve atypically developed vision. Specifically, this study examined the effect of age and reward on task performance, practice effects, and motivation (i.e., number of trials completed) in a higher spatial frequency (reference frequency: 6 cycles per degree) discrimination task. We measured discrimination thresholds in children aged between 7 to 12 years and adults (N = 135). Reward was manipulated by presenting either positive reinforcement or punishment. Results showed a decrease in discrimination thresholds with age, thus revealing that higher spatial frequency discrimination continues to develop after 12 years of age. This development continues longer than previously shown for discrimination of lower spatial frequencies. Moreover, thresholds decreased during the run, indicating that discrimination abilities improved. Reward did not affect performance or improvement. However, in an additional group of 5–6 year-olds (N = 28) punishments resulted in the completion of fewer trials compared to reinforcements. In both reward conditions children aged 5–6 years completed only a fourth or half of the run (64 to 128 out of 254 trials) and were not motivated to continue. The design thus needs further adaptation before it can be applied to this age group. Children aged 7–12 years and adults completed the run, suggesting that the design is successful and motivating for children aged 7–12 years. This study thus presents developmental differences in higher spatial frequency discrimination thresholds. Furthermore, it presents a design that can be used in future developmental studies that require multiple stimulus presentations such as visual perceptual learning."
https://openalex.org/W2581277123,"Unintentional injuries are among the ten leading causes of death in older adults; falls cause 60% of these deaths. Despite their effectiveness to improve balance and reduce the risk of falls, balance training programs have several drawbacks in practice, such as lack of engaging elements, boring exercises, and the effort and cost of travelling, ultimately resulting in low adherence. Exergames, that is, digital games controlled by body movements, have been proposed as an alternative to improve balance. One of the main challenges for exergames is to automatically quantify balance during game-play in order to adapt the game difficulty according to the skills of the player. Here we perform a multidimensional exploratory data analysis, using visualization techniques, to find useful measures for quantifying balance in real-time. First, we visualize exergaming data, derived from 400 force plate recordings of 40 participants from 20 to 79 years and 10 trials per participant, as heat maps and violin plots to get quick insight into the nature of the data. Second, we extract known and new features from the data, such as instantaneous speed, measures of dispersion, turbulence measures derived from speed, and curvature values. Finally, we analyze and visualize these features using several visualizations such as a heat map, overlapping violin plots, a parallel coordinate plot, a projection of the two first principal components, and a scatter plot matrix. Our visualizations and findings suggest that heat maps and violin plots can provide quick insight and directions for further data exploration. The most promising measures to quantify balance in real-time are speed, curvature and a turbulence measure, because these measures show age-related changes in balance performance. The next step is to apply the present techniques to data of whole body movements as recorded by devices such as Kinect."
https://openalex.org/W2582179907,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have identified more than 50 loci associated with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), a measure of kidney function. However, significant SNPs account for a small proportion of eGFR variability. Other forms of genetic variation have not been comprehensively evaluated for association with eGFR. In this study, we assess whether changes in germline DNA copy number are associated with GFR estimated from serum creatinine, eGFRcrea. We used hidden Markov models (HMMs) to identify copy number polymorphic regions (CNPs) from high-throughput SNP arrays for 2,514 African (AA) and 8,645 European ancestry (EA) participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. Separately for the EA and AA cohorts, we used Bayesian Gaussian mixture models to estimate copy number at regions identified by the HMM or previously reported in the HapMap Project. We identified 312 and 464 autosomal CNPs among individuals of EA and AA, respectively. Multivariate models adjusted for SNP-derived covariates of population structure identified one CNP in the EA cohort near genome-wide statistical significance (Bonferroni-adjusted p = 0.067) located on chromosome 5 (876-880kb). Overall, our findings suggest a limited role of CNPs in explaining eGFR variability."
https://openalex.org/W2582255114,"Myelofibrosis is an indicator of poor prognosis in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), but the precise mechanism(s) contributing to extracellular matrix remodeling and collagen deposition in the bone marrow (BM) niche remains unanswered. In this study, we isolated mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) from mice transplanted with wild-type thrombopoietin receptor (MPLWT) and MPLW515L retroviral-transduced bone marrow. Using MSCs derived from MPLW515-transplant recipients, excessive collagen deposition was maintained in the absence of the virus and neoplastic hematopoietic cells suggested that the MSCs were reprogrammed in vivo. TGFβ production by malignant megakaryocytes plays a definitive role promoting myelofibrosis in MPNs. However, TGFβ was equally expressed by MSCs derived from MPLWT and MPLW515L expressing mice and the addition of neutralizing anti-TGFβ antibody only partially reduced collagen secretion in vitro. Interestingly, profibrotic MSCs displayed increased levels of pSmad3 and pSTAT3 suggesting that inflammatory mediators cooperating with the TGFβ-receptor signaling may maintain the aberrant phenotype ex vivo. FGFb is a known suppressor of TGFβ signaling. Reduced collagen deposition by FGFb-treated MSCs derived from MPLW515L mice suggests that the activating pathway is vulnerable to this suppressive mediator. Therefore, our findings have implications for the future investigation of therapies to reverse fibrosis in MPNs."
https://openalex.org/W2580691616,"The morphology and severity of human congenital cataract varies even among individuals with the same mutation, suggesting that genetic background modifies phenotypic penetrance. The spontaneous mouse mutant, vacuolated lens (vl), arose on the C3H/HeSnJ background. The mutation disrupts secondary lens fiber development by E16.5, leading to full penetrance of congenital cataract. The vl locus was mapped to a frameshift deletion in the orphan G protein-coupled receptor, Gpr161, which is expressed in differentiating lens fiber cells. When Gpr161vl/vl C3H mice are crossed to MOLF/EiJ mice an unexpected rescue of cataract is observed, suggesting that MOLF modifiers affect cataract penetrance. Subsequent QTL analysis mapped three modifiers (Modvl3-5: Modifier of vl) and in this study we characterized Modvl4 (Chr15; LOD = 4.4). A Modvl4MOLF congenic was generated and is sufficient to rescue congenital cataract and the lens fiber defect at E16.5. Additional phenotypic analysis on three subcongenic lines narrowed down the interval from 55 to 15Mb. In total only 18 protein-coding genes and 2 micro-RNAs are in this region. Fifteen of the 20 genes show detectable expression in the E16.5 eye. Subsequent expression studies in Gpr161vl/vl and subcongenic E16.5 eyes, bioinformatics analysis of C3H/MOLF polymorphisms, and the biological relevancy of the genes in the interval identified three genes (Cdh6, Ank and Trio) that likely contribute to the rescue of the lens phenotype. These studies demonstrate that modification of the Gpr161vl/vl cataract phenotype is likely due to genetic variants in at least one of three closely linked candidate genes on proximal Chr15."
