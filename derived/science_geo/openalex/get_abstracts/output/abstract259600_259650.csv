FAK expression is increased in many cancers, including breast and prostate cancer. Here we describe perturbation of adhesion-mediated signaling with a FAK inhibitor, PF-573,228. In vitro, this compound inhibited purified recombinant catalytic fragment of FAK with an IC50 of 4 nm. In cultured cells, PF-573,228 inhibited FAK phosphorylation on Tyr397 with an IC50 of 30–100 nm. Treatment of cells with concentrations of PF-573,228 that significantly decreased FAK Tyr397 phosphorylation failed to inhibit cell growth or induce apoptosis. In contrast, treatment with PF-573,228 inhibited both chemotactic and haptotactic migration concomitant with the inhibition of focal adhesion turnover. These studies show that PF-573,228 serves as a useful tool to dissect the functions of FAK in integrin-dependent signaling pathways in normal and cancer cells and forms the basis for the generation of compounds amenable for preclinical and patient trials.

The ability of cells to respond appropriately to environmental cues is critical to maintaining cellular, tissue, and organism homeostasis. One such environmental cue is derived from cellular adhesion to the extracellular matrix. The loss of adhesion-dependent cellular regulation can lead to increased cellular proliferation, decreased cell death, changes in cellular differentiation status, and altered cellular migratory capacity, all of which are critical components of cell carcinogenesis and metastatic progression.

J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1409-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar, 2Mitra S.K. Hanson D.A. Schlaepfer D.D. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Adhesion of cells to the extracellular matrix is mediated by heterodimeric transmembrane integrin receptors located within sites of close opposition to the underlying matrix called focal adhesions. Integrin engagement and clustering stimulates FAK phosphorylation on Tyr397, creating a high affinity binding site for Src and Src family kinases. The FAK·Src complex phosphorylates many components of the focal adhesion, resulting in changes in adhesion dynamics and the initiation of signaling cascades. In addition to FAK catalytic activity, FAK also functions as a scaffold to organize structural and signaling proteins within focal adhesions. The importance of FAK as a regulator of normal cellular function is underscored by the number of cancers reported to have alterations in FAK expression and/or activity, including colon, breast, thyroid, prostate, cervical, ovarian, head and neck, oral, liver, stomach, sarcoma, glioblastoma, and melanoma (4Gabarra-Niecko V. Schaller M.D. Dunty J.M. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2003; 22: 359-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 5McLean G.W. Carragher N.O. Avizienyte E. Evans J. Brunton V.G. Frame M.C. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 505-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). Additionally, alterations in FAK expression and/or activity have been associated with tumorigenesis and increased metastatic potential (4Gabarra-Niecko V. Schaller M.D. Dunty J.M. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2003; 22: 359-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 5McLean G.W. Carragher N.O. Avizienyte E. Evans J. Brunton V.G. Frame M.C. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 505-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). Currently, it is unclear how the catalytic and/or scaffolding function of FAK contributes to tumor progression. To date studies of FAK function have relied on the expression of dominant interfering mutants or elimination of FAK expression by genetic knock-out, antisense oligonucleotide expression, or small interfering RNA. Herein, we report the biochemical and cellular characterization of a novel small molecule inhibitor, PF-573,228 (here after referred to as PF-228), that targets FAK catalytic activity. The inhibitor interacts with FAK in the ATP-binding pocket and effectively blocks the catalytic activity of recombinant FAK protein or endogenous FAK expressed in a variety of normal and cancer cell lines. Treatment of cells with PF-228 blocked FAK phosphorylation on Tyr397 and concomitantly reduced the tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin, a recognized downstream effector of FAK signaling. Drug treatment of normal and cancer cells resulted in decreased cell migration and inhibited adhesion turnover, biological activities previously ascribed to FAK. Interestingly, inhibition of FAK activity had little effect on normal or cancer cell growth or apoptosis in culture. PF-573,228 provides an appropriate tool to dissect the role of FAK in regulation of cell adhesion signaling and the regulation of adhesion dynamics. Chemical Synthesis—PF-573,228 was identified through a combination of high throughput screening, structure based drug design, and conventional medicinal chemistry approaches (38Luzzio M.J. Autry C. Berliner M. Coleman K. Cooper B. Emerson E. Griffor M. Hulford C. Jani J. Kath J. LaGreca S. Lin J. Lorenzen M. Matt E. Martinez-Alsina L. Patel N. Richter D. Schmitt E. Ung E. Vajdos F. Wessell M. Whalen P. Yao L. Roberts W.G. Proc. Annu. Meet. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 2007; 48: 1283Google Scholar). PF-573,228 was prepared according to the procedures described in a patent (35Kath J.C. Luzzio M.J. U. S. Patent Application WO 2004056786. 2004; Google Scholar). The structure and inhibitory activity are shown in Fig. 1. Recombinant Kinase Assay—Purified activated FAK kinase domain (amino acids 410–689) was reacted with 50 μm ATP, and 10 μg/well of a random peptide polymer of Glu and Tyr (molar ratio of 4:1), poly(Glu/Tyr) in kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 125 mm NaCl, 48 mm MgCl2) for 15 min. Phosphorylation of poly(Glu/Tyr) was challenged with serially diluted compounds at ½-Log concentrations starting at a top concentration of 1 μm. Each concentration was run in triplicate. Phosphorylation of poly(Glu/Tyr) was detected with a general anti-phospho-tyrosine (PY20) antibody, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody. The standard horseradish peroxidase substrate 3, 3′, 5, 5′-tetramethylbenzidine was added, and Optical Density readings at 450 nm were obtained following the addition of stop solution (2 m H2SO4). The IC50 values were determined using the Hill slope model. Broad kinase selectivity profiling was performed using the KinaseProfiler™ selectivity screening service available through Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. For more information please see: www.upstate.com/discovery/services/kp_overview.q. Cellular Kinase Assays—Using the GeneSwitch inducible system from Invitrogen, stable A431 epithelial carcinoma clones were generated to express either wild type V5-tagged FAK protein or mutant FAK Y397F V5-tagged protein under the inducible regulation of mifepristone (36Ung E.J. Whalen P.M. Roberts W.G. Cell Assay for Inhibitors of Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK). 2002; (Patent Cooperation Treaty application number W004027018)Google Scholar). Stable clones were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, 750 μg/ml Zeocin, and 50 μg/ml Hygromycin. One day prior to running the FAK cell ELISA, A431·FAKwt cells were seeded at 1.2 × 106 cells/ml in growth medium in 96-well U-bottom plates. After 4–6 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2, FAK expression was induced with 0.1 nm miferpristone. Uninduced controls were included. Goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit plates were subsequently coated with either anti-V5 or anti-FAK (1.0 μg/ml) or an irrelevant antibody control in Superblock Tris-buffered saline buffer. Anti-V5- or anti-FAK-coated plates were blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin, 0.5% Tween for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were treated with ½-Log serial dilutions starting at a top concentration of 1 μm for 30 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Lysates from cells treated with indicated concentrations of compound were prepared in P-lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, and protease inhibitors) and transferred to the anti-V5- or anti-FAK-coated plates to capture total induced or total FAK protein. Anti-phosphospecific FAK[Y397] was used to detect autophosphorylated FAK Tyr397, followed by secondary reporter antibody. Horseradish peroxidase substrate was added, and plates were read at 450 nm. The IC50 values were determined using the Hill slope model. For Western blot analysis, REF52 cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of inhibitor for the indicated periods of time prior to lysis in CH buffer (50 mm HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, pH 7.2) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 mm leupeptin, and 0.05 TIU/ml aprotinin, 1 mm Na3VO4, 40 mm NaF, and 10 mm Na4P2O7. For suspension/replating experiments, REF52 cells were suspended in serum-free medium in the presence or absence of the indicated concentrations of inhibitor and were allowed to reattach to plates coated with 5 μg/ml FN for 30 min in the continued presence or absence of inhibitor. The cells were lysed in CH-buffer, and Western blot analysis of whole cell lysates was performed using 25–50 μg of protein. Cell Growth and Apoptosis—Growth assays were performed by seeding 1 × 104 REF52 or PC3 cells/well of a 24-well plate in triplicate 24 h prior to daily treatment with the indicated concentrations of each inhibitor for 3 days. Subsequently, the cells were harvested and counted. Apoptosis assays were performed using a cell death detection ELISA (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, REF52, PC3 or MDCK cells were treated for 24 h (16 h for MDCK) with the indicated concentrations of each inhibitor prior to lysis. Cells suspended for 16–24 h in serum-free medium served as a positive control. The cell lysates were incubated in duplicate in the ELISA system. The data represent the means ± standard deviation of one of three experiments performed in duplicate. Cell Migration Assays—Cell migration was assessed using modified Boyden chambers (tissue culture-treated, 6.5-mm diameter, 10-mm thickness, 8-mm pores; BioCoat; Fisher) as described previously (6Slack J.K. Catling A.D. Eblen S.T. Weber M.J. Parsons J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27177-27184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Chemokinesis was determined to be the number of cells migrating to the lower side of the chamber in serum-free medium. For growth factor-mediated chemotaxis, 10% fetal bovine serum was included in the lower chamber. To assess FN-stimulated haptotaxis, the underside of the membrane was coated with 1.5 μg/ml FN suspended in PBS in the lower chamber, and PBS was placed in the upper chamber. After incubating the chambers overnight at 4 °C, the FN solutions were removed, and Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium without serum was added to each chamber. For inhibitor studies, 1 × 105 REF52 cells were pretreated with each inhibitor for 30 min prior to harvest and addition to the transwell. The inhibitor remained in both chambers of each well for the duration of the migration assay. The cells were allowed to migrate for 6 h at 37 °C. Nonmigrating cells on the upper side of the membrane were removed with a cotton swab. The cells that had migrated to the underside of the membrane were washed twice in PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 20 min, washed twice with PBS, and stained with crystal violet. Migration was assessed by counting four 320× fields using a Zeiss Axiovert 135TV inverted fluorescence microscope. The data presented represent the means ± standard deviation of one of three experiments performed in triplicate normalized to the untreated control. Each experimental group was analyzed using single-factor analysis of variance. If the global F test for differences among any one of the groups was significant at the 5% level, we proceeded to investigate which treated sample(s) differed from untreated controls using Student’s t tests assuming unequal variance. Statistical significance was defined as p ≤ 0.05. Wound Healing Assay—Confluent REF52 monolayers on 35-mm Bioptechs delta-T dishes (Fisher) were wounded with a 10-μl pipette tip, and cells migrating into the wound were filmed for 9 h at 37 °C by time lapse microscopy. PF-573,228 was added at the time of wounding, and filming was initiated 1 h post-wounding. Time lapse microscopy was performed using a Nikon TE200 inverted microscope with a 20× differential interference contrast objective and a Bioptechs heated stage. The images were captured with a Hamamatsu Orca camera and compiled using Improvision Openlab software (Improvision, Lexington, MA). Following image capture, the nuclei of single cells were tracked over time as they migrated into the wound, and the cell speed was calculated by dividing the length of the cell track by the total time of the movie. Immunofluorescence and Cell Spreading—Adherent REF52 cells were washed and treated with increasing concentrations of PF-573,228 for 1 h in the absence of serum. For replating experiments REF52 cells were held in suspension for 30 min without serum and in the presence of increasing amounts of the FAK inhibitors. The cells were plated onto FN-coated (5 μg/ml) coverslips (for immunofluorescence) or delta-T dishes (for differential interference contrast time lapse movies) for 60 min in the continued presence of inhibitors. The cells were fixed for 20 min with fresh 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 2 min and blocked in 20% goat serum, 2% bovine serum albumin for 30 min. The cells were then stained with antibodies to paxillin (Transduction Laboratories, Franklin Lakes, NJ) or FAK Tyr(P)397 (BioSource International, Camarillo, CA). Secondary antibodies were labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 or 594 dyes (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Images were acquired using a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope with a 60× oil objective, a Hamamatsu digital camera, and the Openlab imaging software package (Improvision). TIRF Microscopy and Adhesion Turnover Analysis—NIH-3T3 cells were stably transfected with green fluorescent protein-paxillin using the FLP-In system (Invitrogen). Confluent monolayers on delta-T dishes were treated with PF-573,228 and wounded with a pipette tip as described above. Fluorescent adhesions were visualized at 37 °C using a Nikon TE2000-E Eclipse inverted TIRF microscope equipped with a 60 × 1.45 N.A. TIRF objective, a Retiga digital camera (QImaging) and QCapture Pro acquisition software. The images were acquired every 5 min for 60–90 min. Image analysis was performed using Openlab software. The intensity of each adhesion was measured over time, and the peak (maximal) intensity for each adhesion was determined. Adhesion lifetime was calculated as the sum of the time required for the adhesion to reach the peak intensity from its half-peak intensity and the time required for the adhesion to return to its half-peak intensity from its peak intensity. At least seven adhesions were analyzed per cell. Inhibition of FAK Kinase Activity in Vitro and in Vivo—PF-573,228, (6-[(4-((3-(methanesulfonyl)benzyl)amino)-5-trifluoromethylpyrimidin-2-yl)amino]-3,4-dihydro-1H-quinolin-2-one) is a competitive inhibitor of ATP with specificity for FAK family protein-tyrosine kinases (Fig. 1A). PF-573,228 was one of several compounds evaluated for biochemical and cellular activities against FAK and was chosen for additional studies based on its specificity for FAK, minimal activity against other kinases tested, and utility for in vitro evaluation. Using a catalytically active fragment of FAK, the inhibitory properties of PF-228 were assessed initially by measuring the phosphorylation of poly(Glu/Tyr) by enzymatically active recombinant FAK protein. PF-228 inhibited catalytic activity in this assay with an IC50 of 4 nm (Fig. 1B and Table 1). In a parallel assay, PF-228 inhibited Pyk2 with an IC50 of 1 μm (Table 1). PF-228 was screened against a commercially available panel of recombinant enzymes (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.; (7Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3910) Google Scholar)) at 1 μm (Table 1). In this assay, 1 μm PF-228 (250-fold the IC50 for FAK) inhibited the cyclin-dependent kinases CDK1/cyclin B and CDK7/cyclin H 77% and 86%, respectively, and GSK3β 64%. Therefore, the inhibitory effect of PF-228 on recombinant CDK1/cyyclin B, CDK7/cyclin H, and GSK3β kinase activity was determined. The IC50 values for PF-228 on all kinases were 50–250 times greater than the IC50 for FAK (Table 1).TABLE 1Kinase selectivity profile of PF-228KinasePF-228aPercentage of inhibition.1 μmIC50NmFAK4Pyk2>1000Abl(h)8ACK29AKT0ASK1BTK11c-RAF(h)0CaMKIV(h)0CDK1/cyclinB(h)77486CDK2/cyclinA(h)50CDK2/cyclinE(h)44CDK3/cyclinE(h)44CDK5/p35(h)0CDK6/cyclinD3(h)15CDK7/cyclinH/MAT1(h)86197CHK113cSRC(h)1EGFR(h)0EphA215EphB211Fyn28GSK3β(h)64>1000IR27IGF-1R21IKKβ(h)56JAK327JNK1α1(h)4c-kit25LCK0MAPK1(h)48MEK1(h)20MKK48MKK616PDGFR-β2P70S6K(h)31PI 3-Kγ(h)0PKA(h)0PKBα(h)13PKCα(h)12PKC-θ36ROCK-II(h)8a Percentage of inhibition. Open table in a new tab Two cell-based assays were used to assess the activity of PF-228. First, A431 epithelial carcinoma cells expressing epitope-tagged FAK under the inducible regulation of mifepristone were incubated with increasing concentrations of PF-228, and the phosphorylation of FAK Tyr397 was measured in a quantitative ELISA (see “Experimental Procedures”). PF-228 inhibited FAK phosphorylation in A431 cells with IC50 of 11 nm (Fig. 2A). To assess the ability of PF-228 to block endogenous FAK activity, the phosphorylation of FAK Tyr397 was measured in cultured REF52 cells (a nontransformed, immortalized rat fibroblast cell line). Treatment of cells with increasing concentrations of PF-228 for 60 min revealed half-maximal inhibition of Tyr397 phosphorylation of ∼100 nm. Greater than 75–80% inhibition was routinely achieved with PF-228 concentrations of 0.3–3 μm (Fig. 2B). PF-228 also blocked FAK Tyr397 phosphorylation in PC3 (prostate carcinoma), SKOV-3 (ovarian carcinoma), L3.6p1 and F-G (pancreatic carcinomas), and MDCK cells with IC50 of 30–500 nm (Fig. 2B, inset). FAK Tyr397 phosphorylation decreased within 15 min of treatment with 1 μm PF-228 and was accompanied by a decrease in the phosphorylation of a downstream substrate, paxillin Tyr31 (Fig. 2C). FAK localizes to and is activated within focal adhesions (1Parsons J.T. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1409-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar, 2Mitra S.K. Hanson D.A. Schlaepfer D.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 56-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1902) Google Scholar). Therefore, the subcellular localization of phosphorylated FAK was examined in adherent REF52 cells 1 h after treatment with increasing concentrations of the FAK inhibitors in the absence of serum. Paralleling the Western blot analysis, there was a dose-dependent decrease in FAK phosphorylation within paxillin-containing focal adhesions, particularly noticeable in the larger adhesions underlying the cell body (Fig. 2D). Effects of FAK Inhibition on Cell Growth and Apoptosis—Adhesion-dependent signaling events have been reported to regulate cell growth and apoptosis (8Playford M.P. Schaller M.D. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7928-7946Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 9Cary L.A. Han D.C. Guan J.L. Histol. Histopathol. 1999; 14: 1001-1009PubMed Google Scholar). Because increased FAK expression has been correlated with increased tumorigenicity (reviewed in Refs. 4Gabarra-Niecko V. Schaller M.D. Dunty J.M. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2003; 22: 359-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar and 5McLean G.W. Carragher N.O. Avizienyte E. Evans J. Brunton V.G. Frame M.C. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 505-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar), the growth inhibitory effects of PF-228 on PC3 cells, a prostate adenocarcinoma with increased FAK expression (10Slack J.K. Adams R.B. Rovin J.D. Bissonette E.A. Stoker C.E. Parsons J.T. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1152-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), as well as a nontransformed cell line (REF52) were assessed. REF52 or PC3 cells were treated with PF-228 each day for 3 days, after which the total number of cells was determined and compared with the Me2SO-treated controls (Table 2). Treatment of cells with 1 μm PF-228 failed to inhibit cell growth, although this concentration of PF-228 was sufficient to inhibit FAK phosphorylation by greater than 80–90%. Growth of REF52 and PC3 cells was significantly inhibited at the higher concentration of 10 μm PF-228 (Table 2). To assess whether the inhibition of growth observed at higher concentrations was perhaps due to off target effects of PF-228, FAK-deficient fibroblasts (11Ilic D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T. Nature. 1995; 377: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar) were treated with increasing concentrations of PF-228. Inhibition of growth was observed using 10 μm PF-228 (data not shown), indicating that prolonged treatment of cells at high concentrations of drug may inhibit cell growth in a FAK-independent manner.TABLE 2Effects of PF-228 on cell growthPF-228Me2SO1 μm10 μmGrowthaPercentage of Me2SO control.REF52100141 ± 357 ± 5PC3100109 ± 617 ± 6a Percentage of Me2SO control. Open table in a new tab To examine whether inhibition of FAK catalytic activity induced apoptosis, REF52, PC3, or MDCK cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of PF-228 for 24 h, and apoptosis was assessed using an ELISA assay, which measures the presence of free histones in lysates (Fig. 3). As previously reported suspension of MDCK cells for 16 h readily induced apoptosis (Fig. 3) (12Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2735) Google Scholar). Similarly, suspending REF52 cells for 24 h also induced apoptosis, although to a lesser extent than the apoptosis induced in MDCK cells. PC3 cells did not undergo apoptosis in suspension. Treatment of attached REF52, PC3, or MDCK cells with PF-228 failed to induce histone accumulation at concentrations shown to significantly block FAK Tyr397 phosphorylation. Effects of FAK Inhibition on Cell Spreading and Migration—Cell adhesion to extracellular matrix components such as FN stimulates FAK activity and cell spreading (1Parsons J.T. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1409-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar, 2Mitra S.K. Hanson D.A. Schlaepfer D.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 56-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1902) Google Scholar). To assess the ability of PF-228 to block adhesion-dependent FAK activation, REF52 cells were suspended in serum-free medium containing increasing concentrations of PF-228 or vehicle control for 1 h and plated on FN-coated dishes for 30 min in the continued presence or absence of inhibitor (Fig. 4A). Treatment of cells with 1–3 μm PF-228 reduced FN-stimulated FAK Tyr397 phosphorylation by ∼65–85% (Fig. 4A). In addition, treatment of cells with PF-228 also reduced the tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin on Tyr31 in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown). To examine the effects of PF-228 on the morphology of cell spreading, REF52 cells were suspended in the presence of the inhibitor and then plated on 5 μg/ml FN for 60 min in the continued presence of inhibitor. Immunostaining showed a maximal inhibition of FAK phosphorylation and a loss of paxillin organization in focal adhesions with 3 μm PF-228 (Fig. 4B). A role for FAK catalytic activity in cell migration was assessed in transwell assays using 10% serum or FN as chemoattractants. REF52 cells were pretreated with the indicated concentrations of PF-228 for 30 min and allowed to migrate toward 10% serum or FN for 6 h in the continued presence of inhibitor (Table 3). Treatment of cells with 1.0 μm PF-228 (a concentration that reduces FAK phosphorylation by 80%) had no significant effect on random migration of REF52 cells (Table 3). However, at this concentration of PF-228, both FN and serum-stimulated migration were significantly inhibited. Treatment of cells with 10 μm PF-228 blocked random migration and also efficiently blocked serum and FN-stimulated migration (Table 3).TABLE 3Effects of PF-228 on cell migrationAssayPF-228Me2SO1.0 μm10 μmTranswell assayaThe data represent fold increase over mock-treated, Me2SO control ± standard error.Mock1.01.2 ± 0.7cNot significantly different from Me2SO.0.4 ± 0.110% serum4.0 ± 2.01.0 ± 0.10.3 ± 0.02FN4.0 ± 1.82.2 ± 0.230.5 ± 0.04Wound healingbSee “Experimental Procedures.”10% serum300 nm/min220 nm/min (27%)120 nm/min (60%)a The data represent fold increase over mock-treated, Me2SO control ± standard error.b See “Experimental Procedures.”c Not significantly different from Me2SO. Open table in a new tab Inhibition of cell migration by PF-228 was also assessed in wound assays performed with REF52 cells (supplemental Fig S1). Treatment of cultures with 1 μm PF-228 significantly reduced the rate of movement of individual cells into the wound, supporting the results from the transwell assay (Table 3). Cell migration requires the coordinated formation and disassembly of focal adhesions, a phenomenon known as focal adhesion turnover (13Webb D.J. Donais K. Whitmore L.A. Thomas S.M. Turner C.E. Parsons J.T. Horwitz A.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). The effects of PF-228 treatment on focal adhesion turnover were analyzed using a wound assay in NIH-3T3 cells stably expressing green fluorescent protein-paxillin. Focal adhesions in cells at the edge of the wound were analyzed by TIRF microscopy. The lifetime of the adhesions was measured by monitoring the fluorescence intensity of single adhesions over time. Untreated cells exhibited active adhesion assembly and disassembly (Fig. 5A, arrowheads), and the average adhesion lifetime was 21.9 ± 11.3 min (Fig. 5B). In contrast, all of the adhesions in the cells pretreated with PF-228 showed a decrease in the rate of disassembly (Fig. 5A, arrowheads) and exhibited significantly longer lifetimes than the adhesions in the untreated cells (Fig. 5B, average adhesion lifetime of 33.1 ± 12.9 and 42.0 ± 14.4 min for 1 and 10 μm PF-228, respectively). Treatment with PF-228 did not inhibit the assembly of new adhesions (Fig. 5A, arrow). Interestingly, whereas the adhesions in the cells treated with PF-228 showed a lack of turnover, they exhibited a pattern of movement toward the center of the cell (see supplemental Movies S1 and S2). In this study we characterize the biochemical and cellular properties of a novel and specific small molecule inhibitor of FAK, PF-228. The inhibitor effectively blocked recombinant FAK catalytic activity and FAK Tyr397 phosphorylation in cultured cells. Treatment of cultured cells with concentrations of the inhibitor that significantly inhibited FAK autophosphorylation of Tyr397 failed to inhibit growth or apoptosis. However, similar treatment of cells with PF-228 resulted in inhibition of serum or FN-directed migration and decreased focal adhesion turnover. Because increased FAK expression and activity are hallmarks of many cancers and the observations that increased cell migration often characterizes tumor cells with increased metastatic potential, FAK inhibitors may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of cancer. PF-228 inhibited recombinant FAK kinase activity with an IC50 of 4 nm, 50–250-fold lower than any other kinase tested. In cultured cells, PF-228 inhibited FAK phosphorylation to varying degrees. ELISA measurements of FAK phosphorylation in A431 cells engineered to overexpress FAK produced an IC50 of 11 nm compared with ∼1"

H., Grinkova, Y. V., and Sligar, S. G. (2002) Nano. Lett. 2, 853–856). Integral membrane proteins can be self-assembled into the Nanodisc bilayer with defined stoichiometry, which allows an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the nature of the oligomerization state of a G-protein-coupled receptor and its coupling to heterotrimeric G-proteins. We generated Nanodiscs having one and two rhodopsins present in the 10-nm-diameter lipid bilayer domain. Efficient transducin activation and isolation of a high affinity transducin-metarhodopsin II complex was demonstrated for a monodisperse and monomeric receptor. A population of Nanodiscs containing two rhodopsins was generated using an increased ratio of receptor to membrane scaffold protein in the self-assembly mixture. The two-rhodopsin population was isolated and purified by density gradient centrifugation. Interestingly, in this case, only one of the two receptors present in the Nanodisc was able to form a stable metarhodopsin II-G-protein complex. Thus there is clear evidence that a monomeric rhodopsin is capable of full coupling to transducin. Importantly, presumably due to steric interactions, it appears that only a single receptor in the Nanodiscs containing two rhodopsins can interact with G-protein. These results have important implications for the stoichiometry of receptor-G-protein coupling and cross talk in signaling pathways.

To resolve the important question of GPCR oligomerization in cellular signaling, we utilized a self-assembled system consisting of a membrane bilayer of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine and an encircling membrane scaffold protein (MSP) (15Bayburt T.H.

Nanodiscs were developed to solubilize membrane proteins as nanometer-sized membrane particles as an effective alternative to detergent (15Bayburt T.H. Grinkova Y.V. Sligar S.G. Nano Lett. 2002; 2: 853-856Crossref Scopus (542) Google Scholar). The Nanodisc is composed of phospholipid and two copies of an MSP that stabilize the discoidal bilayer (15Bayburt T.H. Grinkova Y.V.

Using Nanodisc methodology, we isolated Nanodiscs containing one and two rhodopsin molecules and compared their functional interactions with transducin. Materials—MSP1E3D1 was expressed and purified as described (16Denisov I.G. Grinkova Y.V. Lazarides A.A. Sligar S.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 3477-3487Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). POPC was obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL), and octyl glucoside and dodecyl maltoside were obtained from Anatrace (Maumee, OH). Rod outer segments were isolated from frozen bovine retina (SPCI Retina Inc.) and rhodopsin purified on ConA-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) using published procedures (19Papermaster D.S. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 20Litman B.J. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 150-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Transducin was purified essentially as described (21Wessling-Resnick M. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3697-3705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GTPγS was from Sigma. The 1D4 monoclonal antibody was obtained from the University of British Columbia and coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated CL-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) as described (22Oprian D.D. Molday R.S. Kaufman R.J. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8874-8878Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Nonapeptide TETSQVAPA was obtained from EZBiolab, Inc. (Westfield, IN). Standard buffer is 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.01% NaN3 using MilliQ-purified water (Millipore). Nanodisc Self-assembly and Purification—All rhodopsin manipulations were performed under dim red light. Nanodiscs were self-assembled at ratios of 140:1:0.1 POPC:MSP:rhodopsin for monomeric rhodopsin and 90:1:1 POPC:MSP:rhodopsin to obtain two rhodopsins per Nanodisc. Octyl glucoside (0.5 m stock in water) was added to ConA-purified rhodopsin for a final concentration of 90 mm to ensure monomerization. The rhodopsin stock (typically near 100 μm) was added to a mixture of MSP1E3D1 (typically 200 μm) and POPC/cholate (0.2 m/0.4 m sodium cholate in buffer) at the correct ratio. A protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science, Complete without EDTA) was added followed by a brief incubation on ice. An equal volume of moist Biobeads SM-2 (Bio-Rad) or Amberlite XAD-2 (Supelco), prepared by washing extensively with methanol followed by water and decantation of fines, was added to the Nanodisc assembly mixture to remove detergent. Detergent removal was allowed to proceed overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The beads were removed by centrifugation. The sample was concentrated with a 10-kDa molecular mass cut-off centrifugal device and injected onto a Superdex 200 prep grade column (1.6 × 30 cm) run at 0.5 ml/min. Absorbance was continuously monitored at 630 nm, allowing determination of chromatographic peaks without bleaching. Monomer was further purified by ConA-Sepharose or 1D4 affinity chromatography essentially as described (20Litman B.J. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 150-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 22Oprian D.D. Molday R.S. Kaufman R.J. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nanodiscs containing one and two rhodopsins were separated on linear 10–30% (w/v) sucrose gradients centrifuged at 45,000 rpm in a type 70 Ti rotor (Beckman) for 18 h at 4 °C with slow acceleration and without braking. Gradients were fractionated from the bottom of the tube, and sucrose was removed by size exclusion chromatography. Measurement of Nanodisc Compositions—MSP1E3D1 was quantitated by 280 nm absorbance (29,910 m–1 cm–1), and rhodopsin was quantitated by absorbance at 500 nm (40,600 m–1 cm–1). The contribution of rhodopsin to 280 nm absorbance was corrected using the ratio of absorbance A280/A500 = 1.7 (20Litman B.J. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 150-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Lipid phosphate was determined as described (23Chen P.S. Toribara T.Y. Warner H. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 1756-1758Crossref Scopus (5807) Google Scholar). Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS)—ConA-purified Nanodiscs (monomer) were concentrated to 140 μm rhodopsin. SAXS data were measured on the DuPont-Northwestern-Dow Collaborative Access Team (DND-CAT) beamline at the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne National Laboratory) using a photon wavelength of λ = 0.827 Aå and analyzed as described (17Bayburt T.H. Grinkova Y.V. Sligar S.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2006; 450: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Atomistic models were constructed using a model POPC molecule to form a bilayer, and rhodopsin (Protein Data Bank ID 1F88; Ref. 24Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H.

Biophys. 2006; 450: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Scattering intensities were generated using the program Crysol, and electron density distributions were obtained using the program GNOM (25Svergun D.I. J. Appl.

Transducin Activation Assay—Fluorescence assays were performed at 10 °C in a thermostated, stirred cuvette in a volume of 400 μl with continuous excitation at 543.5 nm (27Fahmy K. Sakmar T.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7229-7236Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 28Ernst O.P. Bieri C. Vogel H. Hofmann K.P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 471-489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using buffer containing 2 mm MgCl2. Fluorescence excitation and emission wavelengths were set to 300 and 345 nm, respectively. The transducin concentration was 300 nm, determined by titrating with known amounts of GTPγS. Reactions were started by the addition of 5 μm GTPγS from a 1 mm stock. Reaction time courses were fit to an exponential function to obtain rate constants, which were converted to the rate of Gtα-GTPγS formation. Due to slow rates in 0.01% w/v dodecyl maltoside, initial rates were measured. Fluorescence was calibrated by adding known amounts of GTPγS to a reaction mixture containing Gt and rhodopsin Nanodiscs. Isolation of Rhodopsin-Gt Complexes—For size exclusion chromatography of the rhodopsin-Gt complex, a mixture of rhodopsin monomer Nanodiscs prepared as described above and Gt (3.4 μm each) with or without 55 μm GTPγS was exposed to room light for 5 min and injected onto a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column. Elution was monitored with a photodiode array detector. In the case of isolation by ConA-Sepharose, Nanodiscs were assembled by dialysis of a 2.1% CHAPS-solubilized mixture containing POPC, MSP1E3D1, and rhodopsin (solubilized from rod outer segments) in the ratio 140:1:0.1. To 340 μl of Nanodiscs (containing 7 μm rhodopsin) was added 14 μm all-trans-retinal and 14 μm Gt. Following a 30-min incubation on ice, the mixture was exposed to light from a 300-watt tungsten bulb filtered through a 480-nm cut-on filter and incubated for an additional 30 min on ice. 180 μl of ConA-Sepharose was added, and the rhodopsin was allowed to bind for 2 h on ice. The matrix was then washed extensively with 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 m NaCl and 0.01% (w/v) NaN3 to remove unbound Gt, free Nanodiscs, and excess retinal. The rhodopsin/Gt complex was eluted with 0.2 m methyl α-d-manno-pyranoside in the same buffer. Transducin Binding Measurements—Transducin binding was measured using the method of extra-MII formation (28Ernst O.P. Bieri C. Vogel H. Hofmann K.P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 471-489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Emeis D. Kuöhn H. Reichert J. Hofmann K.P. FEBS Lett. 1982; 143: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 30Schleicher A. Kuöhn H. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1770-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Purified samples at a rhodopsin concentration of 1 μm and varying transducin in standard buffer were equilibrated at 10 °C. After measurement of a dark spectrum, the sample was exposed to light from a 100-watt tungsten lamp (Oriel) passed through a 480 ± 10 nm interference filter and mechanical shutter. Bleaching by the measuring beam was negligible. Data were fit to a quadratic equation for coupled equilibria between MI, MII, and extra-MII (30Schleicher A. Kuöhn H. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1770-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) using the equation MII⋅Gt=[RL+Gtot+KD(1/K1+1)]/2-[RL+Gtot+KD(1/K1+1)]2/2-RLGtotEq. 1 where MII · Gt is the concentration of MII-G-protein complex, Gtot is the total concentration of G-protein, the concentration of photolyzed rhodopsin RL = MI + MII + MII · Gt, the equilibrium constant K1 = MII/MI, and the dissociation constant KD = [MII][Gt]/[MII · Gt]. KD was determined from least squares fits to the data. K1 was measured as described below. Estimation of Photoproduct Compositions—Photoproducts were measured using spectra of light-activated samples taken at 10 °C before and after treatment at 25 °C in the dark with 0.1 m hydroxylamine (31Matthews R.G. Hubbard R. Brown P.K. Wald G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1963; 47: 215-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 32Parkes J.H. Gibson S.K. Liebman P.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6862-6878Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The amounts of rhodopsin and isorhodopsin remaining after hydroxylamine treatment were estimated by fitting to the known spectrum of rhodopsin in Nanodiscs and a published spectrum of isorhodopsin in detergent (33Crouch R. Purvin V. Nakanishi V. Ebrey T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 1538-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). MI was determined from the light minus hydroxylamine difference spectrum (corrected for dilution) using an extinction coefficient of 45,000 m–1 cm–1 at 478 nm (31Matthews R.G. Hubbard R. Brown P.K. Wald G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1963; 47: 215-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). After correction for isorhodopsin absorbance, the amount of MII was estimated from light minus dark difference spectra using published difference extinction coefficients (34Gibson S.K. Parkes J.H. Liebman P.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11393-11398Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The amounts of MI and MII in the absence of transducin were used to calculate K1. Assembly of Rhodopsin into Nanodisc Structures—Upon removal of detergent, Nanodiscs self-assemble from a mixture of phospholipid/cholate micelles and membrane scaffold protein (15Bayburt T.H. Grinkova Y.V. Sligar S.G. Nano Lett. 2002; 2: 853-856Crossref Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 16Denisov I.G. Grinkova Y.V. Lazarides A.A. Sligar S.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 3477-3487Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). Purified rhodopsin solubilized in octyl glucoside was added to the assembly mixture followed by removal of detergent with polystyrene adsorbent as described under “Experimental Procedures” (17Bayburt T.H. Grinkova Y.V. Sligar S.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2006; 450: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 35Levy D. Bluzat A. Seigneuret M. Rigaud J.L. Biochim. Biophys.

The assembly mixture contained POPC as phospholipid and the membrane scaffold protein MSP1E3D1 (16Denisov I.G. Grinkova Y.V. Lazarides A.A. Sligar S.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 3477-3487Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar) in excess over rhodopsin to favor assembly of single rhodopsin molecules. After removal of detergent, the nanoparticles were isolated from small amounts of aggregated side products using size exclusion chromatography (15Bayburt T.H. Grinkova Y.V. Sligar S.G. Nano Lett. 2002; 2: 853-856Crossref Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 16Denisov I.G. Grinkova Y.V. Lazarides A.A. Sligar S.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 3477-3487Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar) with typically 60–80% recovery of rhodopsin. Removal of the majority of Nanodiscs without an incorporated receptor was accomplished by affinity chromatography on concanavalin A-Sepharose or 1D4 immunoaffinity resin. ConA and 1D4 affinity purification were found to yield samples of similar purity. Fig. 1A shows an analytical size exclusion profile of material purified by immunoaffinity eluting at an apparent Stokes diameter of 12 nm. The traces at 500 and 280 nm are superimposable, suggesting the absence of a significant fraction of Nanodiscs with no incorporated rhodopsin. Absorbance spectra of material purified sequentially through 1D4 affinity and ConA-Sepharose chromatography are illustrated in Fig. 1B. Material purified by 1D4-chromatography was able to bind quantitatively to ConA, demonstrating that both the N-terminal and the C-terminal faces of rhodopsin are available for interaction. As expected, MSP and rhodopsin copurify as indicated by SDS-PAGE shown in the inset. The stoichiometry of rhodopsin in immunoaffinity-purified material was found to be 0.9 rhodopsin per Nanodisc containing two MSP molecules as quantitated by optical absorbance. The measured stoichiometry of slightly less than unity may be due to systematic error in the extinction coefficients of rhodopsin and MSP or the presence of a small amount of bare Nanodiscs or opsin. Phospholipid in the affinity-purified rhodopsin Nanodiscs was determined to be 196 ± 20 POPC by phosphate analysis. Bare Nanodiscs contain 250 POPC per Nanodisc (16Denisov I.G. Grinkova Y.V. Lazarides A.A. Sligar S.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 3477-3487Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar), suggesting that insertion of rhodopsin into the Nanodisc displaces approximately 50 phospholipids. Displacement of similar amounts of phospholipid from the Nanodisc structure has been observed with bacteriorhodopsin (17Bayburt T.H. Grinkova Y.V. Sligar S.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2006; 450: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Small angle x-ray scattering was used to characterize the Nanodisc assemblies (16Denisov I.G. Grinkova Y.V. Lazarides A.A.

Fig. 2 shows electron density probability distributions calculated from scattering intensities for ConA-purified material in panel A and for bare Nanodiscs in panel B. The region of negative contrast for bare Nanodiscs is a characteristic of a phospholipid bilayer organization arising from the lipid acyl chains (25Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 495-503Crossref Scopus (2875) Google Scholar, 38Funari S.S. Nuscher B. Rapp G. Beyer K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nanodiscs containing incorporated rhodopsin have an increased contrast in this region due to the presence of protein within the bilayer domain. The radii of gyration for bare Nanodiscs, 63 Aå, and rhodopsin Nanodiscs, 52 Aå, also indicate the presence of increased electron density near the center of the particle. The overall particle size is ∼130 Aå for the Nanodisc structures, in good agreement with the apparent size obtained by size exclusion chromatography. Similar electron density distributions were obtained using calculated scattering amplitudes from atomistic models of bare Nanodiscs as well as those for a single incorporated GPCR (Fig. 2, dashed lines) as has been described (17Bayburt T.H. Grinkova Y.V. Sligar S.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2006; 450: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Transducin Binding to Monomeric Rhodopsin Nanodiscs—Rhodopsin-transducin complexes were isolated by ConA affinity chromatography, as shown in Fig. 3A, inset. The starting material contained an excess of bare Nanodisc, which was removed along with unbound transducin with a wash step. Rhodopsin-transducin complexes were eluted specifically with α-methyl mannoside. The observed spectrum indicates an MII · Gt complex absorbing at 380 nm along with minor fraction of photoproducts absorbing at higher wavelengths. Formation of an MII · Gt complex can also be observed as an increase in particle size, as shown in Fig. 3B. The apparent size of non-photolyzed rhodopsin Nanodiscs absorbing at 500 nm shifts from 12.2 to 13.2 nm for the complex monitored at the MII absorbance peak at 380 nm. The presence of GTPγS prohibits an observable complex formation. Two Rhodopsin Molecules in Nanodiscs—Nanodiscs containing two rhodopsin molecules were assembled and isolated to address the issue of functionality of dimer versus monomer. Nanodiscs were assembled as for monomer but by using a stoichiometry of two rhodopsins per Nanodisc component rather than an excess of lipid and membrane scaffold protein. The assembled Nanodisc mixture was isolated by size exclusion followed by sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation. The results of ultracentrifugation are shown in Fig. 4 for Nanodiscs assembled at a ratio of two rhodopsins per Nanodisc and at a ratio of 0.2 rhodopsin per Nanodisc (monomer). The monomeric rhodopsin in Nanodiscs (found to be 0.8 rhodopsin/Nanodisc) fractionates as a lower density peak when compared with Nanodiscs containing two rhodopsins (found to be 1.9 rhodopsin/Nanodisc). The apparent size based on size exclusion chromatography of the Nanodiscs containing two rhodopsins appears slightly larger than rhodopsin monomer Nanodisc and with 143 ± 7 phospholipids per Nanodisc when compared with 196 ± 20 for monomer, as expected for incorporation of an additional rhodopsin molecule. G-Protein Coupling to Rhodopsin in Nanodiscs—Rate constants were measured using the fluorescence increase of Gtα tryptophans upon GTPγS binding in the presence of catalytic amounts of rhodopsin, excess GTPγS, and a fixed amount of transducin (Fig. 5). The initial rates are linear with rhodopsin concentration. No measurable rate was observed in the absence of rhodopsin. The measured rates for monomer correspond to an apparent second order rate constant of 2 × 106 m–1 s–1 at 10 °C, indicating that rhodopsin monomer in Nanodiscs efficiently catalyzes GDP/GTP exchange. Assays performed at 20 °C exhibit ∼2-fold increases in rates (provided as supplemental data). Rates using dodecyl-maltoside solubilized rhodopsin at dodecyl maltoside concentration near the critical micelle concentration are presented for comparison. Excess detergent micelles are known to decrease the rate of transducin activation due to phase partitioning effects (28Ernst O.P. Bieri C. Vogel H. Hofmann K.P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 471-489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, bare Nanodiscs decrease the rate of activation of Gt with half-inhibition at 280 nm bare Nanodisc (provided as supplemental data). The rhodopsin present in Nanodiscs at the stoichiometry of a dimer is approximately half as active (49%) as monomer in catalyzing GTPγS exchange. A partially diffusion-limited reaction could explain this result since the particle concentration is half that of monomer at equal rhodopsin concentration, and the apparent second order rate constant approaches the range of a diffusion-limited reaction in solution for particles the size of Nanodiscs and transducin heterotrimer. However, the results detailed below indicate that diffusion-limited reaction conditions are not the most likely explanation. Transducin interaction with rhodopsin was quantitated using the method of extra-MII formation. In this experiment, rhodopsin in Nanodiscs was photolyzed by different timed exposures to light in the presence of varying amounts of transducin. The absorbance change at 380 nm with respect to a sample in the absence of transducin is a monitor of extra-MII formation (29Emeis D. Kuöhn H. Reichert J. Hofmann K.P. FEBS Lett. 1982; 143: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 40Emeis D. Hofmann K.P. FEBS Lett. 1981; 136: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), a consequence of the coupled equilibria among MI, MII, and the transducin-MII complex. The results of representative experiments are shown in Fig. 6, A and B, for rhodopsin monomer and two rhodopsins present in each Nanodisc. The MII/MI equilibria for one (0.45) and two (0.09) rhodopsins per Nanodisc in the absence of transducin were determined in a separate experiment. The data of Fig. 6 were fit as described under “Experimental Procedures” to obtain a dissociation constant (KD) for transducin-MII interaction of 40 ± 19 nm for rhodopsin monomer (three s"

Nigral dopaminergic neurons are particularly exposed to oxidative stress because a pathological accumulation of cytosolic dopamine gives rise to various toxic molecules, including free radicals and reactive quinones. These latter species can react with proteins preventing them from exerting their physiological functions. Among the possible targets of quinones, α-synuclein is of primary interest because of its direct involvement in dopamine metabolism. Contrary to the neurotoxic processes, neuromelanin synthesis seems to play a protective role by its ability to sequester a variety of potentially damaging substances. In this study, we carried out a kinetic and structural analysis of the early oxidation products of dopamine. Specifically, considering the potential high toxicity of aminochrome for both cells and mitochondria, we focused our attention on its rearrangement to 5,6-dihydroxyindole. After the spectroscopic characterization of the products derived from the oxidation of dopamine, the structural information obtained was used to analyze the reactivity of quinones toward α-synuclein. Our results suggest that indole-5,6-quinone, rather than dopamine-o-quinone or aminochrome, is the reactive species. We propose that the observed reactivity could represent a general reaction pathway whenever cysteinyl residues are absent in proteins or if they are sterically protected.

Parkinson disease, the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, is a chronic and progressive disease characterized by degeneration of dopaminergic neuromelanin-containing neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (1Hirsch E. Graybiel A.M. Agid Y.A. Nature. 1988; 334: 345-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar) and by the presence of cytoplasmic inclusions that are mainly composed of fibrillar α-synuclein (αsyn) 2The abbreviations used are: αsyn, α-synuclein; AC, aminochrome; DA, dopamine; DAQs, dopamine-derived quinones; DHI, 5,6-dihydroxyindole; DQ, dopamine-3,4-quinone; IQ, indole-5,6-quinone; NM, neuromelanin.

Postmortem studies support the involvement of oxidative stress and the production of reactive oxygen species in Parkinson disease (3Hirsch E.C. Eur. Neurol. 1993; 33: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 4Jenner P. Movement Disorders. 1998; 13: 24-34PubMed Google Scholar). A possible source of oxidative stress is the redox reactions that specifically involve dopamine (DA). A critical aspect is the amount of DA present in the cytoplasm, outside the synaptic vesicles where the neurotransmitter is confined under physiological conditions. Spontaneous oxidation of DA in the presence of molecular oxygen leads to the formation of several cytotoxic molecules, including superoxide anions (O2-˙), hydroxyl radicals (OH·), and reactive quinones (DAQs) (5Graham D.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1978; 14: 633-643PubMed Google Scholar). Reactive oxygen species derived from the oxidation of DA can damage cellular components such as lipids, proteins, and DNA (6Lotharius J. Brundin P. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 932-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). The electron-deficient quinones can also react with cellular nucleophiles, leading to further cytotoxicity. DAQs have been shown to bind covalently to cysteinyl residues of proteins both in vitro and in vivo (7Ito S. Kato T. Fujita K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 1707-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 8Hastings T.G. Lewis D.A. Zigmond M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Med. 2005; 11: 1214-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Because these residues are often located at the active site of a protein, it has been proposed that covalent modifications result in an impairment of protein function with potentially deleterious effects on the cell (10LaVoie M.J. Hastings T.G. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1484-1491Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among the several proteins that appear to be physiological targets of DAQs, α-synuclein is of particular interest because it seems to be directly involved in DA storage, synthesis, and uptake (13Sidhu A. Wersinger C. Vernier P. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Therefore, modifications induced by DAQs on αsyn that prevent the protein from exerting its physiological function could generate a circular process that leads to an increased cytosolic DA concentration that in turn exacerbates the oxidative damage in dopaminergic neurons. As a neurotransmitter, DA is synthesized in the cytoplasm and rapidly sequestered by the VMAT2 transporter into synaptic vesicles (14Erickson J.D. Eiden L.E. Hoffman B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10993-10997Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 15Liu Y. Peter D. Roghani A. Schuldiner S. Prive G.G. Eisenberg D. Brecha N. Edwards R.H. Cell. 1992; 70: 539-551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) where it is stabilized by the low pH. When the amount of cytosolic DA exceeds the physiological concentration, DA can be metabolized via monoamine oxidase and aldehyde dehydrogenase into the non-toxic metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and hydrogen peroxide (16Elsworth J.D. Roth R.H. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 144: 4-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) or it can be sequestered into the lysosomes (17Sulzer D. Zecca L. Neurotox. Res. 2000; 1: 181-195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) where it can auto-oxidize to form neuromelanin (NM). NM is a dark polymer present in the brain of humans and, to a lesser amount, of some other primates. It is primarily distributed in the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra and the noradrenergic neurons of the locus coeruleus (18Graham D.G. Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med. 1979; 103: 359-362PubMed Google Scholar). No physiological function has been defined for NM, although the hypothesis of a protective role has been suggested in the literature. This role seems to be related to the ability of NM to sequester a variety of potentially damaging substances, such as toxic catechol derivatives, hydroxyl radicals, or redox active transition metals, including iron and copper (17Sulzer D. Zecca L. Neurotox. Res. 2000; 1: 181-195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Sulzer D. Bogulavsky J. Larsen K.E. Behr G. Karatekin E. Kleinman M.H. Turro N. Krantz D. Edwards R.H. Greene L.A. Zecca L.

(Oxf.). 2005; 75: 109-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The pathway for NM genesis, which involves DA oxidation, has been proposed to be similar to that originally described by Raper and later by Mason in their pioneering work on melanogenesis (22Raper H.S. Physiol. Rev. 1928; 8: 245-282Crossref Google Scholar, 23Mason H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1948; 172: 83-99Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is shown in Fig. 1. The overall process does not require enzymatic action (17Sulzer D. Zecca L. Neurotox. Res. 2000; 1: 181-195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Fedorow H. Tribl F. Halliday G. Gerlach M. Riederer P. Double K.L. Prog. Neurobiol. (Oxf.). 2005; 75: 109-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). However, tyrosinase, the trigger of melanin formation, has been recently detected in brain tissues (24Greggio E. Bergantino E. Carter D. Ahmad R. Costin G.E. Hearing V.J. Clarimon J. Singleton A. Eerola J. Hellstrom O. Tienari P.J. Miller D.W. Beilina A. Bubacco L. Cookson M.R. J. Neurochem. 2005; 93: 246-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Understanding the kinetics of the early steps in NM synthesis is important because of the potential neuroprotective role of neuromelanins. The goal is to determine the factors that prevent its formation, exposing the cell to damaging oxidative conditions. Until now, the kinetic information available in the literature has been primarily obtained for the first two steps of NM synthesis, i.e. dopamine-o-quinone (DQ) formation and its cyclization, or from studies carried out on dihydroxyphenylalanine (25Garcia-Carmona F. Garcia-Canovas F. Iborra J.L. Lozano J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 717: 124-131Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 26Chedekel M.R. Land E.J. Thompson A. Truscott T.G. J. Chem. Soc. Chem.

Acta. 1987; 925: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). However, a different behavior was observed in the cyclization step using DA instead of dihydroxyphenylalanine (29Tse D.C.S. McCreery R.L. Adams R.N. J. Med. Chem. 1976; 19: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), indicating, as expected, that the presence of the carboxyl group can influence the kinetics of the reactions. In this study, we characterized the early oxidation products of dopamine by nuclear magnetic resonance. Specifically, considering the potentially high toxicity of aminochrome (AC) for both cell and mitochondria (30Bindoli A. Rigobello M.P. Galzigna L. Toxicol. Lett. 1989; 48: 3-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 31Asanuma M. Miyazaki I. Ogawa N. Neurotox. Res. 2003; 5: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 32Zoccarato F. Toscano P. Alexandre A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15587-15594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), we focused our attention on its rearrangement to 5,6-dihydroxyindole (DHI). Furthermore, by generating DA-derived quinones in a sample containing partially deuterated αsyn, we characterized the most reactive quinone demonstrating the potential reactivity of indole-5,6-quinone (IQ) toward αsyn. Chemicals—Dopamine hydrochloride, sodium (meta)periodate, sodium phosphate salts, and l-ascorbic acid were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Water-d2 and sodium 3-trimethylsilyl propionate-2,2,3,3-d4 were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories. Protein Preparation and Purification—Human α-synuclein cDNA was subcloned into the NcoI and XhoI restriction sites of the pET28b plasmid (Novagen). The protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells grown in M9 minimal medium, using 95% D2O when protein deuteration was desired. After boiling the cell homogenate for 15 min, the soluble fraction, containing αsyn, was treated with 50% ammonium sulfate. The pellet was then resuspended, dialyzed, loaded into a 6-ml Resource Q column (Amersham Biosciences), and eluted with a NaCl gradient. UV Spectroscopy—Spectra were recorded on a personal computer-interfaced diode array Agilent 8453 UV-visible spectrophotometer. Optical measurements were performed at 25 and 37 °C using HELLMA quartz cell with Suprasil windows and an optical path length of 0.1 cm. Experiments were recorded with 30-s delays on 2-mm DA samples in water alone or in the presence of 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, saturated with nitrogen, and with the addition of 2 mm NaIO4. The wavelength range was 190–1100 nm. Millipore Milli-Q water was always used in the preparation of stock solutions to avoid metal-induced oxidative processes on DA. NMR Experiments—Spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance DMX600 spectrometer equipped with a gradient triple resonance probe. Stock solutions of the reagents were obtained by dissolving them in 99.9% D2O. Samples were then prepared by mixing the stock solutions to obtain the desired final concentrations. Sodium 3-trimethylsilyl propionate-2,2,3,3-d4 was used as an internal chemical shift reference. After the transfer into the NMR tube, and before the addition of the oxidant, the samples were fluxed with dry nitrogen gas for ∼15 min to remove dissolved oxygen. Two-dimensional homonuclear experiments were used to assist the assignment of the peaks that appeared during the progress of the melanogenesis reaction. DQF-COSY spectra were acquired with gradient coherence selection (33Hurd R.E. J. Magn. Res. 1990; 87: 422-428Google Scholar, 34Ancian B. Bourgeois I. Dauphin J.F. Shaw A.A. J. Magn. Res. A. 1997; 125: 348-354Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and Clean-TOCSY spectra were recorded in the phase-sensitive manner using the TPPI method (35Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Res. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar, 36Griesinger C. Otting G. Wütrich K. Ernst R.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 7870-7872Crossref Scopus (1199) Google Scholar) with 100 ms of mixing time. All two-dimensional experiments were carried out by collecting 400 increments, each one consisting of 8 scans and 2048 data points. The spectral width was 6000 Hz in both dimensions. Prior to Fourier transformation, the time domain data were multiplied by shifted sine-bell functions in the F1 dimension and Gaussian functions in F2; zero filling to 4K × 1K real points was employed to increase the digital resolution. Kinetics Studies—After recording the spectrum of DA alone, sodium periodate was added to the solution, and the reaction was followed by recording a series of one-dimensional spectra at 2–4-min intervals. An initial delay of ∼4 min was necessary for thermal equilibration of the sample and for probe tuning and field shimming. Series of experiments were carried out by varying the pH (6.0–7.4), the temperature (15–37 °C), and the sodium periodate concentration (1–4 mm). The spectra were processed with GIFA (37Pons J.L. Malliavin T.E. Delsuc M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), and the data were analyzed with Origin. The quantitative determination of the various compounds was carried out by integration of the corresponding peaks. The known concentration of dopamine before the reaction was used to determine concentrations from peak areas. The Levenberg-Marquardt χ2 minimization algorithm was used to fit the data. αSyn-DAQ Interactions—The reactions were performed in a final volume of 25 μl, at 37 °C, in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, in the presence of 500 μm α-syn and 1 mm DA (containing 5 mCi of radioactive [14C]DA). After the addition of 1 mm sodium periodate, aliquots (3 μl) were taken at 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min and mixed with 22 μl of gel loading buffer containing 5 mm ascorbic acid. The reaction products were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography. In parallel, a control was performed by incubating for 90 min αsyn and DA in the same experimental conditions but without sodium periodate. Characterization of the Reactive Oxidation Product of DA—Stock solutions of the reagents were obtained by dissolving them in 99.9% D2O. They were then mixed to obtain a 500-μm αsyn sample in 20 mm phosphate buffer, in the presence of 1 mm dopamine. After the acquisition of a reference one-dimensional NMR spectrum, NaIO4 was added to the sample to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the reaction was followed for 2 h by recording a series of one-dimensional spectra at 37 °C at 2-min intervals. An initial delay of ∼2 min was necessary for thermal equilibration of the sample and for probe tuning and field shimming. When deuterated αsyn was used, the reagent concentrations were the following: 250 μm αsyn, 250 μm dopamine, 500 μm NaIO4, and spectra were recorded at 4-min intervals. UV Studies—The time evolution of the UV-visible spectrum of DA in the presence of NaIO4 is shown in Fig. 2. The reaction was first carried out in H2O without buffer, as described in a previous study (18Graham D.G. Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med. 1979; 103: 359-362PubMed Google Scholar). Upon addition of NaIO4, the absorption at λ = 280 nm decreases, indicating the disappearance of dopamine. Immediately, an absorption maximum appears at λ = 395 nm, corresponding to the yellow chromophore DQ, which is progressively replaced by the orange AC (Fig. 2A). Two new features appear in the spectra at 300 and 475 nm that have been associated with AC (18Graham D.G. Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med. 1979; 103: 359-362PubMed Google Scholar). Under more physiological conditions, i.e. at 37 °C and pH 7.4, addition of the oxidant causes only the peaks corresponding to AC to arise while peaks relative to other intermediate species, and in particular to DQ, are not detected (Fig. 2B). The time evolution of AC can be easily followed; unfortunately, the quantitative analysis of the decay is hampered by the formation of a black precipitate that induces light scattering. NMR Assignment—Before carrying out a kinetic analysis by NMR spectroscopy, it is mandatory to unambiguously assign each resonance observed in the spectra during the evolution of the polymerization process. In the present case, the transient character of many products complicated the assignment. However, by following the reaction at 25 °C in an unbuffered equimolar solution of DA and NaIO4, the species DA, DQ, and AC were stable for enough time to record two-dimensional COSY and TOCSY experiments. The multiplicity of the peaks and chemical shift information available in the literature were also used for the assignment (38Silverstein R.M. Webster F.X. Spectrometric Identification of Organic Compounds.6th Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1997: 144-216Google Scholar). In agreement with the UV analysis, when the NMR experiments were repeated at 37 °C, pH 7.4, a closer approximation of the physiological conditions, the formation of DQ was not detected. On the contrary, four new peaks appeared, two singlets and two doublets, later assigned to DHI. The onedimensional spectrum recorded 10 min after the addition of the oxidant in these latter experimental conditions is shown in Fig. 3. All the NMR data obtained from our analysis are summarized in Table 1.TABLE 11H NMR data and structural assignment s, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet; dd, doublet of doublets; dt, doublet of triplets.DopamineDopamine-o-quinoneAminochrome5,6-Dihydroxyindoleδ3J (H,H)AssignmentaThe notation is the same as in Fig. 1δ3J (H,H)AssignmentaThe notation is the same as in Fig. 1δ3J (H,H)AssignmentaThe notation is the same as in Fig. 1δ3J (H,H)AssignmentaThe notation is the same as in Fig. 1ppmHzppmHzppmHzppmHz6.91d (8.1)47.14dd (10.2, 2.2)46.55t (2.6)37.23d (3.1)16.85d (2.1)36.49d (10.3)55.81s47.15s36.76dd (8.1, 2.2)56.38d (1.8)33.95t (5.3)17.05s43.23t (7.3)13.32t (7.5)13.15dt (2.6, 5.2)26.42d (3.0)22.88t (7.3)22.85t (7.5)2a The notation is the same as in Fig. 1 Open table in a new tab Kinetics Studies—After the assignment of the individual resonances, kinetics measurements were carried out at different concentrations of the oxidizing agent by acquiring series of one-dimensional spectra. Under the experimental conditions used, i.e. 37 °C, pH 7.4, a 2-mm DA solution was stable over several hours, excluding the contribution of autooxidative processes. To exclude possible interference by sodium 3-trimethylsilyl propionate-2,2,3,3-d4 or transition metal ions, the experiments were repeated both without sodium 3-trimethylsilyl propionate-2,2,3,3-d4 and in the presence of 2 mm EDTA with no observable differences. Finally, to test whether radical species are formed in the early steps of the process (which should alter the peak intensities), we recorded a series of one-dimensional spectra in the presence of 2 mm phenylalanine as well as DA. After the addition of 2 mm NaIO4 and the subsequent formation of AC and DHI, the peak intensities corresponding to phenylalanine were unchanged, indicating that even if the oxidizing process proceeds through formation of radicals, these do not affect peak intensities. The pseudo-two-dimensional spectrum recorded at 37 °C, pH 7.4 in the presence of 2 mm DA after the addition of 1 equivalent of oxidant is shown in Fig. 4. All peaks relative to DA, AC, and DHI are visible, and the evolution can be followed over time. Under these experimental conditions and in the reaction time indicated, no peaks corresponding to oligomeric species appear. This result may be explained as follows: either the polymerization is too fast to allow the accumulation of dimers, trimers, and oligomers in high enough concentrations to be detectable by NMR, or the solubility of these species is below the NMR detection level, or a combination of the two. For a quantitative analysis of the kinetics data, the concentrations of the different molecules were obtained from the integration of the corresponding peaks; the known initial concentration of DA (and of phenylalanine as an internal standard, when present) was used to determine concentrations from peak areas. The time evolution of DA, AC, and DHI at 37 °C, pH 7.4, starting from 2 mm DA in the presence of 1 equivalent of oxidant is shown in Fig. 5A. As expected, cyclization of DQ is very fast at pH 7.4 (27Land E.J. Ito S. Wakamatsu K. Riley P.A. Pig. Cell Res. 2003; 16: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) so that NaIO4 is consumed to oxidize not only DA, but also leukoaminochrome. Accordingly, a few seconds after the addition of the oxidant, DA and AC are present in solution approximately at the same concentration. The slow disappearance of DA, which continues for more than 1 h after the beginning of the reaction, may indicate that slight oxidative conditions are still present in solution. This may also justify the disappearance of DHI after its accumulation. Another possibility is that DA is partially sequestered during the formation of a precipitate that was always observed in the experimental conditions used in this work. The overall reaction we studied can be summarized as follows,DA→→k1AC→kaDHI→kbIQ→→k2PrecipitateREACTION 1 where k1 and k2 are too fast to be followed by NMR (28Palumbo A. d'Ischia M. Misuraca G. Prota G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 925: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and ka and kb represent the apparent constants of the disappearance processes of AC and DHI, respectively. The rearrangement of AC, which should not be affected by any oxidative condition, follows a first order kinetics curve, and the data can be fitted well (correlation factor >0.98) by Equation 1, [AC] = [AC]0 exp{-kat}, where [AC] is the aminochrome concentration, [AC]0 is the concentration at time 0, i.e. a few seconds after the addition of NaIO4, t is time, and ka is the rate constant of the rearrangement reaction. The interpolation of the experimental data with Equation 1 leads to a value of ka = 0.16 ± 0.02 min-1, where the error is the maximum deviation calculated on three separate experiments. In the simplest case of two consecutive first order reactions, we also calculated a value of kb = 0.073 ± 0.018 min-1, where the uncertainty is the maximum deviation calculated on three separate experiments. This value of kb, however, does not lead to a good fit of the time dependence of the variation in DHI concentration, suggesting that the observed consumption of DHI depends on more than one process, possibly of an order higher than one. To verify the independence of the decay of AC from the presence of oxidant, different experiments were conducted varying the NaIO4 concentration while keeping the initial DA concentration constant. As expected, the concentrations of DA and AC, a few seconds after addition of NaIO4, were sensitive to the oxidant concentration (Fig. 5, A–D). On the contrary, the rate of disappearance of AC was not affected, and the kinetic constants found at oxidant-to-DA ratios of 1:2, 1.5:1, and 2:1 (0.16 ± 0.02, 0.18 ± 0.04, and 0.18 ± 0.03 min-1, respectively) were consistent with the value found at a 1:1 ratio. We also analyzed the effects of temperature and pH on the reaction rate (Fig. 6, A–C). Lowering the temperature causes a decrease of the rearrangement rate, as well as of all the reactions observed. Using the three points available, we estimated the value of the activation energy of the rearrangement reaction from the temperature dependence of its rate constant. The logarithmic plot of ka versus 1/T (data not shown) is a straight line (correlation factor >0.999), suggesting that the process follows Arrhenius's law as shown in Equation 2, ka = A exp{-Ea/kBNaT}, where the pre-exponential factor A is a measure of the collision rate, kB is the Boltzmann constant, Na is Avogadro's number, T is the temperature, and Ea is the energy of activation. The linearity of the plot indicates that Ea is independent of temperature. The interpolation of the experimental data leads to a value of A = 7.28 × 1010 min-1 and Ea = 69 kJ mol-1. The kinetic constant decreases also with a decrease in pH, as shown in Fig. 6, D–F. However, the influence of pH seems to be more relevant for the rearrangement reaction. The accumulation of DHI at lower pH values is very limited, indicating that the rate of disappearance of DHI is much less affected by pH variations than the accumulation rate. The values of the calculated rate constants are summarized in Table 2.TABLE 2Effect of temperature and pH on the apparent rate constant for AC disappearanceT (°C) (pH 7.4)372515ka (min-1)0.160.060.02pH (T 37 °C)7.06.56.0ka (min-1)0.100.060.04 Open table in a new tab NMR Characterization of DAQ Species Reactive toward αSyn—The spectroscopic characterization of all the species involved in the early steps of the NM synthesis allowed us to study their reactivity toward target proteins. Previous studies pointed to αsyn as a cytoplasmatic target for DAQs, suggesting a potential pathological effect of DAQ-modified αsyn. On these premises, we chose to characterize the most reactive DAQs toward this protein. DA reactivity has generally been ascribed to DQ, but αsyn lacks sulfhydryl groups. The latter are the nucleophilic groups in proteins that are usually reported to interact with DQ (7Ito S. Kato T. Fujita K. Biochem.

As indicated in Fig. 1, the quinones generated during the oxidative pathway of NM synthesis are DQ, AC, and IQ. Consequently, all of these are possible reactive species. To verify that DAQs react covalently with αsyn, the reaction with [14C]DA was followed in time and the products identified by autoradiography of the SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 7, immediately after the addition of the oxidant, a band corresponding to the αsyn monomer became visible, indicating the incorporation of the radioactive molecule into the protein. We observed other bands in the gel corresponding to dimeric and oligomeric forms of DAQ-modified αsyn. The relative intensities of these bands seemed to increase with increasing reaction time. Once the interaction of DAQs with αsyn was shown to lead to a co"

The finding that mice deficient in collagenase-2 (MMP-8) are more susceptible to develop skin cancer, prompted us to investigate the role of this protease in cutaneous wound healing. We have observed a significant delay in wound closure in MMP8-/- mice and an altered inflammatory response in their wounds, with a delay of neutrophil infiltration during the first days and a persistent inflammation at later time points. These changes were accompanied by alterations in the TGF-beta1 signaling pathway and by an apoptosis defect in MMP8-/- mice. The delay in wound healing observed in MMP8-/- mice was rescued by bone marrow transplantation from wild-type mice. Analysis of other MMPs showed that MMP8-/- mice had a significant increase in the expression of MMP-9, suggesting that both proteases might act coordinately in this process. This possibility was further supported by the novel finding that MMP-8 and MMP-9 form specific complexes in vivo. Taken together, these data indicate that MMP-8 participates in wound repair by contributing to the resolution of inflammation and open the possibility to develop new strategies for treating wound healing defects."
https://openalex.org/W2131114370,"Plutonium displays phase transitions with enormous volume differences among its phases and both its Pauli like magnetic susceptibility and resistivity are an order of magnitude larger than those of simple metals. Curium is also highly resistive but its susceptibility is Curie-like at high temperatures and orders antiferromagnetically at low temperatures. The anomalous properties of the late actinides stem from the competition between the itinerancy and localization of its f electrons, which makes the late actinides elemental strongly correlated materials. A central problem in this field is to understand the mechanism by which these materials resolve these conflicting tendencies. In this letter we identify the electronic mechanisms responsible for the anomalous behaviour of late actinides. We revisit the concept of valence using theoretical approach that treats magnetism, Kondo screening, atomic multiplet effects, spin orbit coupling and crystal field splitting on the same footing. Plutonium is found to be in a rare mixed valent state, namely its ground state is a superposition of two distinct valencies. Curium settles in a single valence magnetically ordered state at low temperatures. The f7 atomic configuration of Curium is contrasted with the multiple configuration manifolds present in Plutonium ground state which we characterize by a valence histogram. The balance between the Kondo screening and magnetism is determined by the competition between spin orbit coupling and the strength of atomic multiplets which is in turn regulated by the degree of itinerancy. The approach presented here, highlights the electronic origin of the bonding anomalies in plutonium and can be applied to predict generalized valences and the presence or absence of magnetism in other compounds starting from first principles."

Rhamm is a nonintegral cell surface hyaluronan receptor (CD168) and intracellular protein that promotes cell motility in culture. Here we describe an autocrine mechanism utilizing cell surface Rhamm-CD44 interactions to sustain rapid basal motility in invasive breast cancer cell lines that requires endogenous hyaluronan synthesis and the formation of Rhamm-CD44-ERK1,2 complexes. Motile/invasive MDA-MB-231 and Ras-MCF10A cells produce more endogenous hyaluronan, cell surface CD44 and Rhamm, an oncogenic Rhamm isoform, and exhibit more elevated basal activation of ERK1,2 than less invasive MCF7 and MCF10A breast cancer cells. Furthermore, CD44, Rhamm, and ERK1,2 uniquely co-immunoprecipitate and co-localize in MDA-MB-231 and Ras-MCF10A cells. Combinations of anti-CD44, anti-Rhamm antibodies, and a MEK1 inhibitor (PD098059) had less-than-additive blocking effects, suggesting the action of all three proteins on a common motogenic signaling pathway. Collectively, these results show that cell surface Rhamm and CD44 act together in a hyaluronan-dependent autocrine mechanism to coordinate sustained signaling through ERK1,2, leading to high basal motility of invasive breast cancer cells.

Sionov R.V. Ish-Shalom D. Adv. Cancer Res. 1997; 71: 241-319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Naor D. Nedvetzki S. Golan I. Melnik L. Faitelson Y. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 2002; 39: 527-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). It is encoded by a single gene but exists as multiple isoforms that are generated by alternative splicing of 10 variable exons, as well as through post-translational modifications (12.Naor D. Sionov R.V. Ish-Shalom D. Adv. Cancer Res. 1997; 71: 241-319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The most commonly expressed CD44 isoform (the standard form or CD44std) is an 85-kDa protein that contains none of the variable exons. Originally described as the principal cell surface receptor for HA (14.Aruffo A. Stamenkovic I. Melnick M. Underhill C.B. Seed B. Cell. 1990; 61: 1303-1313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2135) Google Scholar), CD44 has since been shown to bind multiple ligands including fibronectin (15.Jalkanen S. Jalkanen M. J.

Science. 1996; 271: 509-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar); in general, the ligands for many of the CD44 variants are not yet known. However, a role for CD44std as a mediator of HA-promoted motility in breast cancer cell lines is well established on tissue culture plastic (two-dimensional cultures) (7.Tammi M.I. Day A.J.

CD44 isoforms containing variable exons v6 and v9 are also involved in HA-mediated signaling (e.g. in activated T cells (20.Galluzzo E. Albi N. Fiorucci S. Merigiola C. Ruggeri L. Tosti A. Grossi C.E. Velardi A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 2932-2939Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar)), and expression of isoforms containing variable exons v4-v7 enhances HA binding of a rat pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line (21.Sleeman J.P. Arming S. Moll J.F. Hekele A. Rudy W. Sherman L.S. Kreil G. Ponta H. Herrlich P. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3134-3141PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that in addition to CD44std, at least some variants of CD44 isoforms can bind HA. CD44 binds to HA via an extracellular domain, whereas the cytoplasmic tail activates intracellular signaling pathways that regulate the association of signaling complexes with the cortical actin cytoskeleton (13.Naor D.

Although several groups report that CD44std expression positively correlates with disease-related survival, whereas expression of CD44 variants correlates with poor prognosis (50.Gotte M. Yip G.W. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 10233-10237Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), other studies contradict these results (24.Morris S.F. O'Hanlon D.M. McLaughlin R. McHale T. Connolly G.E. Given H.F.

Histopathology. 2005; 47: 420-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Furthermore, analysis of breast cancer progression in a CD44-/- mouse background (where there is an absence of all CD44 isoforms) indicates that loss rather than gain of CD44 expression is associated with increased metastasis (13.Naor D. Nedvetzki S. Golan I. Melnik L. Faitelson Y. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 2002; 39: 527-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 27.Auvinen P. Tammi R. Tammi M. Johansson R. Kosma V.M. Histopathology. 2005; 47: 420-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These observations predict a potential for CD44 to act as both as a tumor progression enhancer and a tumor suppressor (e.g. Refs. 28.Watanabe O. Kinoshita J. Shimizu T. Imamura H. Hirano A. Okabe T. Aiba M. Ogawa K. J. Exp. Clin. Cancer Res. 2005; 24: 75-82PubMed Google Scholar and 29.Diaz L.K. Zhou X. Wright E.T. Cristofanilli M. Smith T. Yang Y. Sneige N. Sahin A. Gilcrease M.Z. Clin.

The basis for an association of CD44 with different outcomes in breast cancer patients or in animal models of this disease is not well understood. One possibility is that differential expression/function of CD44 isoforms in tumor cell subsets, including progenitors, may affect clinical outcome (30.Sheridan C. Kishimoto H. Fuchs R.K. Mehrotra S.

Cancer. 2006; 42: 1219-1224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, CD44 is also known to associate with, and facilitate, signaling through such tumor cell-associated proteins/receptors as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) (33.Yu W.H. Woessner Jr., J.F. McNeish J.D. Stamenkovic I. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 307-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 34.Thanakit V. Sampatanukul P. Ruangvejvorachai P. Keelawat S. J. Med. Assoc.

Therefore, the consequences of CD44 expression to tumor cell behavior and its signaling properties may be modified by the proteins it associates with and vice versa. For example, co-expression of CD44v4 with one of its cell surface binding partners (MMP-9) correlates with node positivity in breast cancer patients, whereas the expression of CD44v4 alone does not (34.Thanakit V. Sampatanukul P. Ruangvejvorachai P. Keelawat S. J. Med. Assoc. Thai. 2005; 88: S30-S35PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, hyperexpression of other CD44 binding partners, including specific hyaluronan synthases and hyaluronidases (e.g. HAS-2 and hyal-2), together with CD44 (but not CD44 alone), correlates with the degree of invasiveness of human breast cancer cell lines (10.Udabage L. Brownlee G.R. Nilsson S.K. Brown T.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 310: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar).Cell surface Rhamm (CD168) is an HA-binding protein/receptor that is not highly expressed in normal tissues but is commonly overexpressed in many advanced cancers (18.Turley E.A.

Cell. 2006; 127: 539-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Importantly, spindle-associated functions of Rhamm are blocked by the breast/ovarian tumor suppressor gene BRCA1 (43.Joukov V. Groen A.C. Prokhorova T. Gerson R. White E. Rodriguez A. Walter J.C. Livingston D.M. Cell. 2006; 127: 539-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). This functional link between Rhamm and BRCA1, a factor in hereditary forms of breast cancer, as well as evidence that hyperexpression of Rhamm predicts poor clinical outcome and increased risk of sporadic breast cancer metastasis (37.Wang C. Thor A.D. Moore II, D.H. Zhao Y. Kerschmann R. Stern R. Watson P.H. Turley E.A. Clin. Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 567-576PubMed Google Scholar), suggests that Rhamm may be influential in both inherited and noninherited forms of breast cancer. However, the relevance of its multiple intracellular versus extracellular functions to human breast cancer aggressiveness has not been fully established yet. We recently showed that the motility defects of Rhamm-/- wound fibroblasts could be rescued by soluble recombinant Rhamm protein linked to Sepharose beads. Rescue required a concomitant surface display of CD44 (42.Assmann V. Jenkinson D. Marshall J.F. Hart I.R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3943-3954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but did not require expression of intracellular Rhamm forms. These results suggest that at least some of the functions regulated by intracellular versus extracellular Rhamm are distinct.As a consequence of its ability to bind to HA, cell surface Rhamm activates multiple motogenic signaling pathways that have been implicated in breast cancer progression. These include Ras (40.Hall C.L. Yang B. Yang X. Zhang S. Turley M. Samuel S. Lange L.A. Wang C. Curpen G.D. Savani R.C. Greenberg A.H. Turley E.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 19-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), pp60-c-Src (44.Hall C.L. Lange L.A. Prober D.A. Zhang S. Turley E.A. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2213-2224PubMed Google Scholar), and ERK1,2 (37.Wang C. Thor A.D. Moore II, D.H. Zhao Y. Kerschmann R. Stern R. Watson P.H. Turley E.A. Clin. Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 567-576PubMed Google Scholar). Cell surface Rhamm is required for sustained activation and intracellular targeting of ERK1,2 in dermal wound fibroblasts (45.Tolg C. Hamilton S.R. Nakrieko K.A. Kooshesh F. Walton P. Mc-Carthy J.B. Bissell M.J. Turley E.A. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 1017-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), suggesting that the extracellular Rhamm form could potentially function in tumor progression to increase the intensity and duration of signaling pathways associated with tumor invasion/motility. Importantly, cell surface Rhamm can additionally perform motogenic/invasive functions similar to CD44 and can even replace CD44 (46.Nedvetzki S. Gonen E. Assayag N. Reich R. Williams R.O. Thurmond R.L. Huang J.F. Neudecker B.A. Wang F.S. Turley E.A. Naor D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 18081-18086Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). These observations have raised the possibility that cell surface Rhamm may partner with CD44 to “unleash” its motogenic potential (45.Tolg C. Hamilton S.R. Nakrieko K.A. Kooshesh F. Walton P. Mc-Carthy J.B. Bissell M.J. Turley E.A. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 1017-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 46.Nedvetzki S. Gonen E. Assayag N. Reich R. Williams R.O. Thurmond R.L.

A. 2004; 101: 18081-18086Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar).Although cell-autonomous tumor progression events can clearly contribute to the aggressiveness of breast cancer cells, such cells still remain sensitive to some exogenous factors in their microenvironment (for review see Ref. 47.Kenny P.A. Bissell M.J. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 107: 688-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), including cytokines/growth factors and extracellular matrix components such as HA (48.Hall C.L. Wang C. Lange L.A. Turley E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 575-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 49.Sohara Y. Ishiguro N. Machida K. Kurata H. Thant A.A. Senga T. Matsuda S. Kimata K. Iwata H. Hamaguchi M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1859-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Indeed, the accumulation of HA within breast tumors or peritumor stroma is an indicator of poor prognosis in breast cancer patients (50.Gotte M. Yip G.W. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 10233-10237Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). ECM factors such as HA act coordinately with activating mutations in critical signal transduction pathways to modify tumor cell behavior (51.Wang F. Hansen R.K. Radisky D. Yoneda T. Barcellos-Hoff M.H. Petersen O.W. Turley E.A. Bissell M.J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2002; 94: 1494-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). ECM-mediated activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK1,2/ERK1,2 cascade (52.Viala E. Pouyssegur J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2004; 1030: 208-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 53.Santen R.J. Song R.X.

Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2003; 22: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) is one motogenic pathway associated with breast tumor progression. Invasive breast cancer cell lines such as MDA-MB-231 have higher basal ERK1,2 activity than less invasive cell lines (including MCF7), and sustained ERK1,2 activity is required for the increased motility/invasion of the aggressive breast cancer cell lines (54.Reddy K.B. Nabha S.M. Atanaskova N. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2003; 22: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms driving sustained ERK1,2 activation and the consequent effects on tumor motility/invasion are poorly understood (55.Pouyssegur J. Volmat V. Lenormand P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 56.Torii S. Kusakabe M. Yamamoto T. Maekawa M. Nishida E. Dev.

Chromosoma (Berl.). 2005; 114: 86-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).In this study we show that invasive breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231 and Ras-MCF10A) sustain elevated levels of ERK1,2 activation upon growth factor/motogenic stimulation when cell surface CD44 and Rhamm are co-expressed and co-associate with each other. In contrast, less invasive (MCF7) and non-malignant (MCF10A) cell lines express lower levels of either HA receptor at the cell surface, despite the fact that Rhamm is expressed as a cytoplasmic protein and can only transiently activate ERK1,2. We demonstrate also that CD44 and Rhamm co-associate with ERK1,2 as complexes in aggressive breast tumor cell lines. Finally, we show that these CD44-Rhamm-ERK1,2 complexes are required for rapid basal motility of the more invasive cell lines. These results are consistent with a model in which HA, CD44, Rhamm, and activated ERK1,2 are physically and functionally linked in a biological complex to establish an autocrine mechanism for promoting motility in breast cancer cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents (Antibodies, Growth Factors, Hyaluronan and Peptide Inhibitors)−Medical grade HA prepared from bacterial fermentation (provided by Hyal Pharmaceutical Co., Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) was free of detectable proteins, DNA, or endotoxins. The molecular mass range was 250-300 kDa. The following primary antibodies were obtained commercially or as gifts: ERK1 and nonimmune IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phospho-ERK1,2 (Cell Signaling), p21Ras (Oncogene Science, Cambridge, MA), CD44 (IM7, Pharmingen), CD44 (Hermes-3, kind gift of Dr. Sirpa Jalkanen, University of Kuopio, Finland). Anti-CD44 antibodies used were raised against sequence in the CD44std form and therefore could detect all CD44 isoforms. Polyclonal Rhamm antibodies used in this study were prepared (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Diego, CA) against the following human Rhamm sequences: antibody-1 (Ab-1): KSKFSENGNQKN (aa 150-162), antibody-2 (Ab-2): VSIEKEKIDEKS (aa 217-229), and antibody-3 (Ab-3): QLRQQDEDFR (aa 543-553) (59.Lynn B.D.

Specificities of Rhamm and CD44 antibodies were determined using Rhamm-/- and CD44-/- lysates, respectively, and with Rhamm peptide competition. The following secondary antibodies were purchased: for Western blot detection, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse (Bio-Rad Laboratories), anti-rabbit (Amersham Biosciences), and anti-rat (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); for immunofluorescence analysis, anti-rabbit Alexa 555 and anti-rat Alexa 433 (Molecular Probes). The MEK1 inhibitor PD098059 (2-[2′-amino-3′-methoxyphenyl]-oxanaphthalen-4-one]) was purchased from Calbiochem. An HA-binding peptide, YKQKIKHVVKLK, which blocks macrophage migration, was synthesized (61.Savani R.C. Hou G. Liu P. Wang C. Simons E. Grimm P.C. Stern R. Greenberg A.H. DeLisser H.M. Khalil N. Am.

A scrambled peptide, YLKQKKVKKHIV, was used as a control.Cell Culture−Human breast carcinoma cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories Inc., Logan, UT) and 10 mm HEPES (Sigma) at pH 7.2. The immortalized human breast epithelial cell line MCF10A, transfected with the empty pH106 plasmid containing the neomycin resistance gene, and MCF10A cells, transfected with the human mutant H-ras oncogene (mutated at G12-V12), were a kind gift of Dr. Channing Der (North Carolina) and were grown as described previously (62.Soule H.D. Maloney T.M. Wolman S.R. Peterson Jr., W.D. Brenz R. McGrath C.M. Russo J. Pauley R.J. Jones R.F. Brooks S.C. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6075-6086PubMed Google Scholar, 63.Basolo F. Elliott J. Tait L.

Briefly, the cells were grown in DMEM/F-12 (1:1) supplemented with 5% equine serum, 0.1 μg/ml cholera toxin, 10 μg/ml insulin (Invitrogen), 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma), and 0.02 μg/ml epidermal growth factor (Collaborative Research Inc., Palo Alto, CA). All cultures were incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C.Western Immunoblotting−Cells plated at 50% subconfluency for 12 h were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton-X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 50 nm HEPES, pH 7.3) containing the protease and phosphatase inhibitors leupeptin (1 μg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (2 mm), pepstatin A (1 g/ml), aprotinin (0.2 trypsin inhibitory units/ml) and 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin (200 mm), sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm NaF (Sigma). Cell lysates were then microcentrifuged at 13,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C (Heraeus Biofuge 13, Baxter Diagnostics, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) after standing for 20 min on ice. Protein concentrations of the supernatants were determined using the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). 10 μg of total protein from each cell lysate was loaded and separated by electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel together with prestained molecular weight standards (Invitrogen). Following electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol using electrophoretic transfer cells (Bio-Rad) at 100 V for 1.5 h at 4 °C. Additional protein binding sites on the membrane were blocked with 5% defatted milk in TBST (10 mm Tris base (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma)). The membranes were incubated with the primary antibodies for Rhamm, CD44, Ras, or ERK1,2 (all diluted at 1:1000 or 1 μg/ml in 1% defatted milk in TBST) for 2 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed three times at 15-min intervals with 1% defatted milk in TBST. Immunodetection was performed using secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (diluted 1:5000 or 1 mg/ml) in 1% defatted milk in TBST for 1 h at room temperature followed by three washes with TBST. Blotting was visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection system (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Quantification of optical densities of the reactive protein bands was performed on a Bio-Rad video densitometer. To account for variations in loading, parallel SDS gels were carried out with each experiment in which equal amounts of the protein lysates were run. These gels were then stained with Coomassie Blue dye to confirm equal loading. The densitometric results were presented as a mean of three experiments ± S.D. and are presented as a percentage of the protein of interest normalized to a dominant 60-kDa marker band on the Coomassie-stained gels.Analysis of EGF-stimulated ERK1,2 Activation−5 × 104 MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were plated in complete growth medium (DMEM, 10% FCS) on 6-cm cell culture plates and allowed to attach for 4 h. The growth medium was replaced by defined medium (DMEM, 4 μg/ml insulin, 8 μg/ml transferr"

https://openalex.org/W2077808334,"A molecule is 'chiral' when it cannot be superimposed on its mirror image; this property is of decisive importance throughout nature, as DNA, proteins, and many small molecules are chiral. Anomalous X-ray scattering has become the definitive method for determining the absolute configuration of a molecule, but this approach cannot be used unless the molecule contains a 'heavy' atom (for example, bromine). Haesler et al. now show that instrumental advances in Raman optical activity, combined with quantum chemical computations, have made it possible to determine the absolute configuration of molecules that do not contain a heavy atom — in this case, a specially synthesized chirally deuterated version of neopentane that represents the archetype of all molecules that are chiral as a result of a dissymmetric mass distribution. The unequivocal spectroscopic determination of the absolute configuration of this molecule presented a major challenge, one that was at the very limit of what is possible. Decisive instrumental advances in Raman optical activity (ROA), combined with quantum chemical computations, make it possible to determine the absolute configuration of (R)-[2H1, 2H2, 2H3]-neopentane. The relationship between macroscopic chirality and chirality on the molecular level was unequivocally established in 1951 through anomalous X-ray scattering1. Although this technique became the definitive method for determining the absolute configuration of a molecule, one important limitation of the approach is that the molecule must contain ‘heavy’ atoms (for example, bromine). The direct determination of absolute configurations for a wider range of molecules has recently become possible by measuring a molecule’s vibrational optical activity2,3. Here we show that instrumental advances in Raman optical activity4,5, combined with quantum chemical computations6,7,8, make it possible to determine the absolute configuration of (R)-[2H1, 2H2, 2H3]-neopentane9. This saturated hydrocarbon represents the archetype of all molecules that are chiral as a result of a dissymmetric mass distribution. It is chemically inert and cannot be derivatized to yield molecules that would reveal the absolute configuration of the parent compound. Diastereomeric interactions with other molecules, optical rotation, and electronic circular dichroism are, in contrast to the well-known case of bromochlorofluoromethane10,11,12, not expected to be measurable. Vibronic effects in the vacuum ultraviolet circular dichroism might reveal that the molecule is chiral, but the presence of nine rotamers would make it extremely difficult to interpret the spectra, because the spatial arrangement of the rotamers’ nuclei resembles that of enantiomers. The unequivocal spectroscopic determination of the absolute configuration of (R)-[2H1, 2H2, 2H3]-neopentane therefore presented a major challenge, one that was at the very limit of what is possible."

Introduction of the P712H mutation, responsible for lipopolysaccharide (LPS) unresponsiveness of C3H/HeJ mice, into the TIR domain of constitutively active mouse ΔTLR4 and mutation of the homologous P714 in human CD4-TLR4 rendered them signaling-incompetent and blocked TLR4 tyrosine phosphorylation. Mutations of tyrosine residues Y674A and Y680A within the TIR domains of CD4-TLR4 impaired its ability to elicit phosphorylation of p38 and JNK mitogen-activated protein kinases, IκB-α degradation, and activation of NF-κB and RANTES reporters. Likewise, full-length human TLR4 expressing Y674A or Y680A mutations showed suppressed capacities to mediate LPS-inducible cell activation. Signaling deficiencies of the Y674A and Y680A TLR4s correlated with altered MyD88-TLR4 interactions, increased associations with a short IRAK-1 isoform, and decreased amounts of activated IRAK-1 in complex with TLR4. Pretreatment of human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293/TLR4/MD-2 cells with protein tyrosine kinase or Src kinase inhibitors suppressed LPS-driven TLR4 tyrosine phosphorylation, p38 and NF-κB activation. TLR2 and TLR4 agonists induced TLR tyrosine phosphorylation in HEK293 cells overexpressing CD14, MD-2, and TLR4 or TLR2. Induction of endotoxin tolerance in HEK293/TLR4/MD-2 transfectants and in human monocytes markedly suppressed LPS-mediated TLR4 tyrosine phosphorylation and recruitment of Lyn kinase to TLR4, but did not affect TLR4-MD-2 interactions.

Recognition of PAMPS by TLRs leads to TLR oligomerization and recruitment of adapter proteins and kinases to their intracellular TIR signaling domains. These processes trigger activation of transcription factors and expression of cytokines, as well as adhesion and co-stimulatory molecules via two main signaling pathways. The “MyD88-dependent” pathway is activated by all TLRs except TLR3, engages adapter proteins MyD88 and TIR domain containing adapter protein (TIRAP) also called MyD88-like adapter (Mal) (engaged by TLR2 and TLR4), as well as the kinases IL-1R-associated kinase (IRAK)-4 and IRAK-1. This pathway results in early NF-κB and MAPK activation, production of proinflammatory cytokines, and B cell proliferation (1.Medzhitov R. Janeway Jr., C. N. Engl. J.

Prior exposure to LPS induces a state of cell refractoriness to subsequent LPS challenge known as endotoxin tolerance, which is thought to limit excessive inflammatory responses (review in 53.Schade F.U.

Golenbock D.T. Vogel S.N. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 5209-5216Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In this report, we suggest that impaired recruitment of MyD88 to TLR4 and activation of IRAK-1 in endotoxin-tolerant cells is secondary to a decrease in TLR4 tyrosine phosphorylation. Our findings support the hypothesis that tyrosine phosphorylation of the TLR4 TIR domain is required for TLR4 signaling, and is blocked in endotoxin-tolerant cells. Tyrosine-deficient TLR4 species exhibited constitutive associations with MyD88, suppressed LPS-inducible MyD88 recruitment to TLR4, increased interactions with a short isoform of IRAK-1, and impaired activation of IRAK-1 at the receptor. Furthermore, endotoxin-tolerant cells were found to show suppressed LPS-inducible TLR4 tyrosine phosphorylation, which correlates with impaired MyD88 recruitment to TLR4 and inhibited IRAK-1 activation. Moreover, the ability of protein tyrosine kinase and Src kinase inhibitors to block TLR4 tyrosine phosphorylation and signaling, coupled with the observation of LPS-inducible recruitment of Lyn kinase to TLR4 and its impairment in LPS-tolerant cells, suggest involvement of Lyn kinase in TLR4 signaling.

The P712H Mutation in the TIR Domain of Murine HA-ΔTLR4 Abolishes TLR4 Signaling and Tyrosine Phosphorylation−Positional cloning of TLR4 identified a P712H mutation within the TIR domain as the molecular basis for the LPS-hyporesponsive phenotype of C3H/HeJ mice (4.Qureshi S.T.

However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the signaling deficiency of the mutant P712H TLR4 still remain obscure. In this study, we hypothesized that the P712H mutation alters the secondary structure of the TIR domain, resulting in the failure of TLR4 to undergo agonist-induced post-translational modifications that may be necessary for initiation of downstream signaling. Because an earlier report correlated LPS-induced TLR4 tyrosine phosphorylation with TLR4 signaling (70.Chen L.Y. Zuraw B.L. Zhao M. Liu F.T. Huang S. Pan Z.K. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2101348459,"Many viruses have evolved mechanisms to alter mitochondrial function. The hepatitis C virus (HCV) produces a viral core protein that targets to mitochondria and increases Ca2+-dependent ROS production. The aim of this study was to determine whether core's effects are mediated by changes in mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. Core expression caused enhanced mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in response to ER Ca2+ release induced by thapsigargin or ATP. It also increased mitochondrial superoxide production and mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT). Incubating mouse liver mitochondria with an HCV core (100 ng/mg) in vitro increased Ca2+ entry rate by approximately 2-fold. Entry was entirely inhibited by the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter inhibitor, Ru-360, but not influenced by an Na+/Ca2+ exchanger inhibitor or ROS scavengers. These results indicate that core directly increases mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake via a primary effect on the uniporter. This enhanced the ability of mitochondria to sequester Ca2+ in response to ER Ca2+ release, and increased mitochondrial ROS production and MPT.

Nature has devised several mechanisms to polarize the terminal olefin of linear terpenes to facilitate the creation of new C–X bonds. For instance, cyclization of the C30 hydrocarbon squalene to steroids and hopanoids is initiated, respectively, by epoxidation or protonation of the terminal olefin. Although these biosynthetic strategies are widely distributed, a third mechanism for terpene cyclization has been characterized in marine macroalgae involving bromonium ion-induced ring closure (1.Butler A.

Oxidation of the halide is catalyzed by vanadium-dependent bromoperoxidase in the presence of hydrogen peroxide to produce the corresponding hypohalous acid. This species then further reacts with electron-rich organic substrates in a regio- and stereoselective manner, giving rise to brominated terpenes and other halogenated natural products (1.Butler A.

Vanadium-dependent bromoperoxidases are widely distributed in marine algae, and the first enzyme was discovered in 1984 from the brown alga Ascophyllum nodosum (5.Vitler H.

Although the biological function of V-ClPOs has not yet been elucidated, marine algal vanadium-dependent bromoperoxidases have been shown through in vitro chemoenzymatic conversions to catalyze bromonium ion-initiated cyclization of terpenes and ethers (1.Butler A.

These studies not only demonstrated that the enzymes were able to initiate cyclization of a terpene by a bromonium ion but also proved that the halogenation reaction occurred with stereochemical control. To date, all known V-dependent haloperoxidases have been characterized in vitro from eukaryotic systems (9.Hofrichter M. Ullrich R. Appl. Microbiol.

In most cases, the isoprenoid building blocks are derived from the mevalonic acid biosynthetic pathway. Recent biosynthetic gene cluster analysis of the hybrid monoterpene-polyketides furaquinocin from Streptomyces sp. strain KO-3988 and furanonaphthoquinone I from Streptomyces cinnamonensis DSM 1042 revealed a clustering of genes coding for the type III polyketide synthase THN synthase, a prenyltransferase, and a complete set of mevalonic acid-specific geranyl diphosphate biosynthetic enzymes (19.Kawasaki T.

Herein we report the cloning and sequence analysis of the napyradiomycin biosynthetic gene cluster (nap) from Streptomcyces sp. CNQ-525 and S. aculeolatus NRRL 18442, its functional expression in the heterologous host Streptomyces albus, and the structure elucidation of a new napyradiomycin analog. The bioinformatics analysis of the nap cluster, which contains the unprecedented distribution of three V-ClPOs, further revealed the molecular basis for the chlorination and cyclization of the terpene units in the napyradiomycin family of antibiotics. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Culture Conditions−Streptomyces sp. CNQ-525 (14.Soria-Mercado I.E. Prieto-Davo A. Jensen P.R. Fenical W. J. Nat.

For sporulation, it was grown in A1 growth medium for nine days at 30 °C with shaking (250 revolutions/min). pOJ446 (21.Bierman J. Logan R. O'Brien K. Seno E.T. Rao R.N. Schoner B.E. Gene. 1992; 116: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar) was used for cosmid library construction and was grown in LB liquid medium. The expression host S. albus was provided by Dr. Joern Piel (University of Bonn). Strain and DNA manipulations as well as southern hybridization experiments were performed according to standard procedures (22.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.

Practical Streptomyces Genetics. The John Innes Foundation, Norwich2000Google Scholar). Cosmid Library Construction and Sequencing−pOJ446 was digested with HpaI, dephosphorylated with calf intestinal phosphatase, and digested with BamHI. Streptomyces sp. CNQ-525 genomic DNA was partially digested with Sau3AI. DNA fragments between 35 and 40 kb were isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis and purified for ligation. Before adding the ligase, the mixture containing plasmid and genomic DNA was incubated at 50 °C for 5 min and then placed on ice for 5 min. Ligation was carried out overnight at 16 °C using T4 DNA ligase. Packaging and titration were performed using XL-1 blue MRF cells (Stratagene) and MaxPlax λ packaging extracts (Epicenter) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After selection with apramycin (100 μg/ml), ∼2000 colonies were picked and grown overnight in 96-well plates. Cultures were transferred to a Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and grown overnight on LB agar containing apramycin (100 μg/ml). Colonies were lysed and DNA denatured and fixed according to standard procedures (22.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, a Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed.. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The library was screened using Streptomyces sp. CNH-099-based type III polyketide synthase and prenyltransferase genes as heterologous probes. 4M. C. Moffitt and B. S. Moore, unpublished data. Peroxidase labeling and detection of enzyme-labeled positives were performed with the ECL direct nucleic acid labeling and detection systems kit (Amersham Biosciences). Cosmid clone pJW6F11 was sequenced by the shotgun method (Macrogen Inc., Seoul, Korea) and annotated with BLASTP (24.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol.

The genome scanning of S. aculeolatus NRRL 18422 was previously reported (26.Banskota A.H. McAlpine J.B. Sorensen D. Aouidate M. Piraee M. Alarco A. Οmura S. Shiomi K. Farnet C.M. Zazopoulos E. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 2006; 59: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The GenBank™ accession numbers for the nap cluster are EF397639 from Streptomyces sp. CNQ-525 and EF397638 from S. aculeolatus. Streptomyces Transformation, Culture Conditions, and MS Analysis of Halogenated Meroterpenoids−pJW6F11 was introduced into S. albus protoplasts, apramycin-resistant transformants were selected, and the transformants were cultivated according to standard procedures (23.Kieser T. Bibb M.J. Buttner M.J. Chater K.F. Hopwood D.A. Practical Streptomyces Genetics. The John Innes Foundation, Norwich2000Google Scholar). Several 100-ml cultures of S. albus/pJW6F11 were grown in R2YE containing 100 μg/ml apramycin at 30 °C for 9–14 days by rotary shaking (250 revolutions/min). The cells were lysed using 80% MeOH:H2O, and after extraction with 1:1 MeOH:CH2Cl2, the production of nap-based compounds was analyzed using a Hewlett Packard 1100 series high performance liquid chromatography system linked to an Agilent ESI-1100 MSD mass spectrometer (gas flow set to 13 ml/min, drying temperature set to 350 °C, and nebulizing pressure set to 40 pounds/square inch). A Luna 4.6 × 150 mm C18 column was used at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min with a linear solvent gradient of 10–100% acetonitrile in water over a period of 20 min. Fourier transform mass spectral analysis was accomplished with a LTQ-FTMS (ThermoFinnigan). Diluted organic extracts from S. albus/pJW6F11 were introduced into the spectrometer via direct infusion at 1–3 μl/min. The sheath gas was set to 4 liters/min, and the capillary inlet was set to 275 °C. The signal was optimized at the 509 m/z peak using the autotuning feature in the LTQ portion of the instrument. All FTMS analysis was performed in the negative ion mode, and the data were collected at 200,000 resolution. Extracts from clones harboring pOJ446 without insert did not produce any napyradiomycins. All of the theoretical values were obtained by importing the molecular formulas into the Qual browser software (ThermoFinnigan). Purification of 2-Deschloro-2-hydroxy-A80915C−Cultures of the wild-type Streptomyces sp. CNQ-525 (14.Soria-Mercado I.E. Prieto-Davo A. Jensen P.R. Fenical W. J. Nat.

Extracts were dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and concentrated in vacuo. The crude extract (310 mg) from a 1-liter fermentation was subjected to reversed phase C18 flash column chromatography (Fisher Scientific, PrepSep C18 1 g/6 ml) with 1:4 MeCN/H2O, 2:3 MeCN/H2O, 3:2 MeCN/H2O, 4:1 MeCN/H2O, MeCN, and MeOH. Each fraction was analyzed by reversed-phase C18 analytical LC-MS as described above, and the fraction eluting with 3:2 MeCN/H2O was subjected to purification by high performance liquid chromatography using a Waters differential refractometer R401 detector. Compounds were purified on a Luna 250 × 10 mm C8 column employing an isocratic condition of 67% MeCN/H2O with a flow rate of 2.0 ml/min. 2-Deschloro-2-hydroxyl-A80915C (4.Vaillancourt F.H. Yeh E.

NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Inova 500-MHz spectrometer. 1H and 13C chemical shifts were referenced to the solvent peak (CDCl3) δ 7.26 and 77.0, respectively.

The napyradiomycin biosynthetic cluster (nap) was discovered from each bacterium using distinct methods. In Streptomyces sp. CNQ-525, PCR-amplified THN synthase and prenyltransferase gene fragments were used as probes for the identification of a single pOJ446 cosmid clone (pJW6F11) containing a 36-kb genomic insert, which was sequenced by a shotgun approach. Identification of the complete 43-kb nap locus was alternatively achieved in S. aculeolatus NRRL 18422 by genome scanning (26.Banskota A.H. McAlpine J.B. Sorensen D. Aouidate M. Piraee M. Alarco A. Οmura S. Shiomi K. Farnet C.M. Zazopoulos E. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 2006; 59: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). When aligned, the two clusters are similarly organized and 97% identical at the nucleotide level (Fig. 2). The DNA sequence is interrupted by a ∼350-bp gap between the convergent genes napH2 and napT8 that proved impervious to our sequencing efforts in CNQ-525. Analysis of the 43-kb nap cluster revealed 33 open reading frames, which included five genes putatively involved in the construction of the naphthoquinone polyketide core (napB1–B5), nine genes associated with the biosynthesis (napT1–T7) and attachment (napT8–T9) of the terpenoid units, four halogenases (napH1–H4), nine putative regulatory and resistance proteins (napR1–R9), four open reading frames of unknown function (napU1–U4), and two transposases that suggest this cluster may have been acquired via horizontal gene transfer (Table 1 and Fig. 2). Of the four nap halogenases, three show striking similarity to fungal V-ClPOs and a hypothetical protein TioM from Micromonospora sp. ML1, which is unprecedented in prokaryotic gene clusters.TABLE 1Deduced function of the open reading frames in Fig. 2TABLE 1Deduced function of the open reading frames in Fig. 2 To verify that all of the genetic information for the production of chlorinated dihydroquinones, such as A80915C (1.Butler A. Carter-Franklin J.N. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2004; 21: 180-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), 3″-hydroxy-7-methylnapyradiomycin B2 (2.Moore B.S. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2006; 23: 615-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and 2-deschloro-A80915C (3.van Pee H.K. Unversucht S. Chemosphere. 2003; 52: 200-312Crossref Scopus (222) Google Scholar), is contained on the nap gene cluster, the Streptomyces sp. CNQ-525 cosmid clone pJW6F11 that contained the truncated 36-kb nap cluster was heterologously expressed in S. albus. Although the mevalonic acid pathway genes napT1–T4 and part of napT5 are absent in pJW6F11, the host strain was reasoned to provide the isopentenyl pyrophosphate and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate building blocks from primary metabolism. Co-injection with authentic napyradiomycin standards, high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and FTMS analysis of the organic extracts from S. albus/pJW6F11 unequivocally demonstrated that the transformant yielded the nap-based chlorinated dihydroquinones 1–3 as well as a series of related analogs that exhibited the characteristic napyradiomycin chromophore (14.Soria-Mercado I.E. Prieto-Davo A. Jensen P.R. Fenical W. J. Nat. Prod. 2005; 68: 904-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) with high UV light absorption at 258, 300, and 356 nm (Fig. 3). The observed masses for two of these dichlorinated analogs at m/z 527 and 509 (negative ion mode) were observed in both the wild type strain CNQ-525 and the S. albus/pJW6F11 transformant, whereas a monochlorinated analog (m/z 473) and a dichlorinated analog (m/z 525) were only identified in the transformant. High resolution FTMS analysis of the organic extracts from the transformant verified exact masses for napyradiomycins 1 (calculated for [M - H]+: m/z 545.1259, observed: 545.1279), 2 (calculated for [M - H]+: m/z 509.1429, observed: 509.1429), and 3 (calculated for [M - H]+: m/z 511.1649, observed: 511.1654) (Fig. 4). FTMS analysis further provided molecular composition data of three new napyradiomycin analogs, namely the dichlorinated 525 species (a) (calculated for C26H30Cl2O7- m/z 525.1447, observed: 525.1423), the dichlorinated 527 species (4.Vaillancourt F.H. Yeh E. Vosburg D.A. Garneau-Tsodikova S. Walsh C.T. Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 3364-3378Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) (calculated for C26H33Cl2O7- m/z 527.1598, observed: 527.1614), and the monochlorinated 473 species (b) (calculated for C26H30Cl2O6- m/z 473.1725, observed: 473.1734) (Fig. 4). The unknown dichlorinated 509 species (c) observed by high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis (Fig. 3) likely has the same molecular formula as compound 2 (C26H31Cl2O6-), so its exact mass could not be distinguished by FTMS. Fermentation of Streptomyces sp. CNQ-525 followed by extraction and chromatography provided the dichlorinated 527 species (4.Vaillancourt F.H. Yeh E. Vosburg D.A. Garneau-Tsodikova S. Walsh C.T. Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 3364-3378Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) in 4.3 mg/liter. Analysis of the proton and carbon NMR spectra, with the aid of gradient-enhanced heteronuclear multiple bond correlation data, clearly established that 4 contained the chlorocyclohexyl monoterpenoid unit common to 1–3. NMR comparison with structurally related compounds 1 and 3 indicated that they only differed in the substitution at C-2. The presence of a broad singlet at δ 4.16 in the 1H spectrum for 4 indicated an additional hydroxyl signal not observed in 1 and 3, which was confirmed by high resolution FTMS. This new C-2 hydroxyl substitution resulted in subtle differences in the NMR spectra of 4 in comparison to that of the chloro analog 1 at C-1′, in which the methylene protons shift from δ 2.62 and 2.45 in 1 to δ 2.15 in 4. The relative stereochemistry of 4 was assigned by comparing nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy correlations to those previously described for 1 (14.Soria-Mercado I.E. Prieto-Davo A. Jensen P.R.

Acta Crystallogr. 2004; 62: 1627-1629Google Scholar). Expression of the nap cluster in S. albus unequivocally confirmed that all of the genes required for the production of the 7-methylnapyradiomycin family of chlorinated dihydroquinones were contained on the cosmid clone pJW6F11. A biosynthetic scheme for the production of napyradiomycins 1–3 was proposed on the basis of the molecular logic of the nap cluster (Fig. 1). As in furaquinocin (19.Kawasaki T. Hayashi Y. Kuzuyama T. Furihata K. Itoh N. Seto H. Dairi T. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 1236-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and furanonaphthoquinone I (20.Haagen Y. Glueck K. Fay K. Kammerer B. Gust B. Heide L. Chembiochem. 2006; 7: 2016-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) biosynthesis, assembly of the dihydroquinone core is catalyzed by the type III polyketide synthase homologous THN synthase NapB1, which condenses five malonyl-CoA molecules to THN. The monooxygenase NapB2 putatively oxidizes THN to flaviolin, as is the case in S. antibioticus IF013271 (28.Funa N. Funabashi M. Yoshimura E. Horinouchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14514-14523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), which is then methylated by the methyltransferase NapB5. Attachment of the first isoprene unit, using dimethylallyl pyrophosphate as the substrate, occurs through a nucleophilic attack involving one of the two prenyltransferases (NapT8/T9). Hydrogenation or chlorination at C-2 by the FADH2-dependent halogenase NapH2 may facilitate the second prenylation reaction at C-3 with geranyl pyrophosphate by the second nap prenyltransferase to yield the diprenylated intermediate SF2415B1 (13.Gomi S. Ohuchi S. Sasaki T. Itoh J. Sezaki M. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1987; 40: 740-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Cyclization of the hemiterpene subunit via a chloronium ion is putatively catalyzed by one of the three nap V-ClPOs (NapH1, H3, H4) giving rise to the 7-methyl derivative of napyradiomycin A1. The monoterpene subunit of 7-methylnapyradiomycin A1 putatively undergoes a related V-ClPO-facilitated cyclization to form 1 and 3, in which a molecule of water is incorporated into the cyclohexanol moiety. Further dechlorination of 1 likely gives rise to 2 (Fig. 1). Although the specifics of the biosynthetic reaction sequence have yet to be confirmed, the successful heterologous expression of the nap cluster confirms that all of the genes required for biosynthesis are present. Phylogenetic analysis of the three nap V-ClPOs with characterized fungal V-ClPOs and algal vanadium-dependent bromoperoxidases shows that the three nap V-ClPOs form their own clade, with NapH1 and NapH4 being most closely related (Fig. 5A). Inspection of the amino acid residues in the active sites of the vanadium haloperoxidases suggests that NapH3 may not be directly involved in the chlorination and cyclization of the terpene units and may instead act as a hydroxylase. Structural and functional comparisons of vanadium haloperoxidases from eukaryotic organisms have shown that six amino acids are required for halogenating activity, whereas two are required for halide selectivity (29.Renirie R. Hemrika W. Wever R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11650-11657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 30.Littlechild J. Garcia-Rodriguez E. Dalby A. Isupov M. J. Mol.

All three nap enzymes contain His-496 (which covalently binds to the vanadate co-factor) and five of the six residues that participate in hydrogen bonding, Lys-353, Arg-360, Ser-402, Gly-403, and Arg-490. Conserved residue His-404, which is proposed to form a hydrogen bond to the apical oxygen of the co-factor (29.Renirie R. Hemrika W. Wever R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11650-11657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), is replaced with Ser (as seen in NapH1 and NapH4) or Phe (as in NapH3). Mutagenesis studies have shown that the V-ClPO mutant H404A from C. inaequalis (29.Renirie R. Hemrika W. Wever R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11650-11657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) loses chlorinating activity, and a similar natural exchange is observed in NapH3. Hence, NapH3 may not be involved in halogenation but rather may be used to hydrate aliphatic carbons to produce such compounds as 7-methylnapyradiomycin A2 (15.Shiomi K. Iinuma H. Naganawa H. Isshiki K. Takeuchi T. Umezawa H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1987; 40: 1740-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). NapH1 and NapH4, on the other hand, contain a hydrophilic Ser residue at this position and are therefore predicted to catalyze the chloronium-induced cyclization of the two terpene units. Analysis of the recombinant proteins is presently underway and will help delineate their functions and specificities. In conclusion, we have demonstrated for the first time the molecular basis for the chlorination and cyclization of terpene units involving novel bacterial V-ClPOs. The isolation of the nap biosynthetic cluster from two bacteria provides a powerful toolbox to study these unique halogenating enzymes. We thank Drs. W. Fenical, P. R. Jensen, and I.

Microglia play a critical role in major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II)-dependent antigen presentation and in reactivation of CNS-infiltrated encephalitogenic T cells. Minocycline, a tetracycline anti-biotic, has profound anti-inflammatory properties and is experimentally used for treatment of many CNS disorders; however, the mechanisms involved in minocycline effects remain unknown. We show that administration of minocycline for 2 weeks ameliorated clinical severity of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, an effect that partially involves the down-regulation of MHC II proteins in the spinal cord. Therefore, we sought to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of minocycline inhibitory effects on MHC II expression in microglia. Although complex, the co-activator class II transactivator (CIITA) is a key regulator of MHC II expression. Here we show that minocycline inhibited interferonγ (IFNγ)-induced CIITA and MHC II mRNA. Interestingly, however, it was without effect on STAT1 phosphorylation or IRF-1 expression, transcription factors that are activated by IFNγ and necessary for CIITA expression. Further experiments revealed that MHC II expression is down-regulated in the presence of the PKCα inhibitor Goö6976. Minocycline inhibited IFNγ-induced PKCα/βII phosphorylation and the nuclear translocation of both PKCα/βII and IRF-1 that subsequently inhibits CIITA expression. Our present data delineate a molecular pathway of minocycline action that includes inhibitory effects on PKCα/βII and transcription factors that regulate the expression of critical inflammatory genes such as MHC II.

Susceptibility to EAE and MS is associated with the major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) genes (1Gunther E. Walter L. Immunogenetics. 2001; 53: 520-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 2de Graaf K.L. Barth S. Herrmann M.M. Storch M.K. Otto C. Olsson T. Melms A. Jung G. Wiesmuller K.H. Weissert R. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 2792-2802Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), suggesting that presentation of antigens on MHC II plays an important role in CD4+ T cell activation and disease initiation. After priming of encephalitogenic T cells in the periphery, they migrate into the CNS, where they trigger inflammatory responses including microglial activation. To sustain their activation, the self-reactive T cells have to be reactivated in the CNS by encountering their cognate antigen bound to MHC II. Microglia, the resident innate immune cells of the CNS, have been shown to be the main antigen-presenting cells of the CNS (3Aloisi F. Glia. 2001; 36: 165-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar, 4O'Keefe G.M. Nguyen V.T. Benveniste E.N. J. Neurovirol. 2002; 8: 496-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). They normally express low levels of MHC II proteins; however, in inflammatory or neurodegenerative conditions, activated microglia highly up-regulate MHC II and co-stimulatory molecules (5Kreutzberg G.W. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 312-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3753) Google Scholar). It was recently shown that microglial paralysis inhibited the development and maintenance of inflammatory CNS lesions, providing the first direct evidence of microglial significance in EAE pathology (6Heppner F.L. Greter M. Marino D. Falsig J. Raivich G. Hovelmeyer N. Waisman A. Rulicke T. Prinz M. Priller J. Becher B. Aguzzi A. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 146-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Microglial activation precedes the clinical onset of EAE and infiltration of peripheral myeloid cells into the CNS, suggesting that they play a critical role in the induction and progression of EAE (7Ponomarev E.D. Shriver L.P. Maresz K. Dittel B.N. J. Neurosci. Res. 2005; 81: 374-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Therefore, the inhibition of microglial activation and MHC II expression may be therapeutically significant in MS. In recent years, minocycline, a semisynthetic antibiotic of the tetracycline family, has emerged as a potent anti-inflammatory drug that has been shown to be beneficial in animal models of many CNS disorders including ischemia (8Yrjanheikki J.

Ann. Neurol. 2004; 55: 756Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that minocycline ameliorated the clinical course of EAE and decreased MHC II expression in the spinal cord (13Popovic N. Schubart A. Goetz B.D. Zhang S.C. Linington C. Duncan I.D. Ann. Neurol. 2002; 51: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar); however, the exact molecular mechanisms underlying these anti-inflammatory effects of minocycline remain unknown. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of minocycline effects on MHC II expression both in vivo in an EAE model and in vitro using primary rat microglial and macrophage cultures. Since MHC II expression in microglia is requisite for T cell reactivation, understanding the mechanism whereby minocycline represses MHC II expression may elucidate critical pathways that can be targeted by other therapies to treat EAE or MS. The regulation of MHC II protein expression is under the control of a complex cytokine network that requires the coordinated action of multiple transcription factors and co-activators. Among the latter, class II transactivator (CIITA), a non-DNA-binding protein, was identified as a key regulator of both constitutive and inducible MHC II expression (14Harton J.A. Ting J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6185-6194Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 9). Our data reveal that minocycline inhibits MHC II expression in microglia via the inhibition of CIITA expression by a mechanism involving the inhibition of IFNγ regulatory factor (IRF-1) translocation to the nucleus in a PKCα/β-dependent manner. Animals—Female Dark Agouti rats and Sprague-Dawley rats purchased from Harlan Sprague Dawley, Inc. (Madison, WI) were housed under standard conditions. All experiments were conducted with approval of Research Animal Resources Center of the University of Wisconsin. MOG Purification—DH5α cells transfected with pQE12 vector with rat myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) insert (amino acids 1-125) with a His6 sequence at the 3′ end was a generous gift of N. Ruddle (Yale University School of Medicine). After isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction (4 h) of protein expression, bacterial extract was prepared using BugBuster reagent (Novagen, Madison, WI). MOG protein was purified from cell extract using His-Bind columns (Novagen) under denaturating conditions following the manufacturer’s protocol. Isolated proteins were then dialyzed against acetate buffer for 24 h using Slide-A-Lyzer dialysis cassette (Pierce). To determine the purity of isolated MOG, proteins were run on 10% SDS-PAGE gel and stained with GelCode blue stain reagent (Pierce). Induction of EAE and Minocycline Treatment—EAE was induced in 150-175 g of Dark Agouti female rats by immunization with 10 μg of MOG in complete Freund’s adjuvant. MOG protein in phosphate-buffered saline was emulsified with an equal volume of complete Freund’s adjuvant, to a final concentration of 10 μg of MOG and 50 μ g of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra in 100 μl of emulsion. Rats were immunized by subcutaneous injection of a 100-μl emulsion at the base of the tail. Control animals were injected with complete Freund’s adjuvant only. Animals were weighed daily and examined for clinical signs of EAE, scored on the following scale: 0.5, partial loss of tail tone; 1, complete tail atony; 2, hind limb weakness; 3, hind limb paralysis; 4, moribund; 5, death. The first clinical signs usually occurred between 10 and 12 days after immunization. Minocycline was administered intraperitoneally twice a day at the first day of clinical signs and then once a day for 14 days at the dose of 45 mg/kg. Immunohistochemistry—Animals underwent transcardiac perfusion with phosphate-buffered saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. Spinal cords were dissected and cut into ∼2-mm segments and post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight. Blocks were cryoprotected in 15% and then 30% sucrose for 24 h followed by embedding into OCT compound (Sakura, Tokyo, Japan) and stored at -80 °C until further use. 14-μm sections were cut from the blocks with a cryostat and used for immunostaining and hematoxylin and eosin staining. The quantification of immunostaining was performed using MetaView Software. Immunopositive areas were measured at a set threshold and expressed as the percentage of the total area of the section. Primary Microglial Cultures—Primary rat microglial cultures were prepared by the shaking method from 4-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat brain as we described previously (15Nikodemova M. Duncan I.D. Watters J.J. J. Neurochem. 2006; 96: 314-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Briefly, brains were dissected, minced, and trypsinized with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA for 20 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of horse serum, and the tissue was triturated with a Pasteur pipette and filtered consecutively through 70- and 45-μm pore size nylon cell strainers. Cells were resuspended in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin and plated in 80-mm2 tissue culture flasks. After 10 days, the flasks were gently shaken for 1 h, and medium was harvested and centrifuged for 10 min at 1000 × g to collect microglial cells. The microglia were resuspended in the medium described above and plated in either 12-well plates at a density of 750,000 cells/well or 8-chamber slides at a density of 150,000 cells/chamber. Isolation of Peritoneal Macrophages—Peritoneal macrophages were isolated from Sprague-Dawley rats by flushing the peritoneal cavity with 30 ml of ice-cold Hanks’ balanced salt solution. After centrifugation, the cells were resuspended in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm MOPS, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin and plated on a 12-well plate at a density of 800,000 cells/well. After a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, the medium was changed to remove non-adherent cells. Western Blot—Whole cell extract was prepared by lysing cell in 2× lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 20% glycerol). Proteins (5-20 μg/lane) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk for 1 h at room temperature followed by incubation with primary antibodies. Anti-phospho-STAT1 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) and anti-phospho-PKCα/βII (Cell Signaling) anti-bodies were used at a 1:1000 dilution overnight at 4 °C. OX6 antibody (anti-MHC II) and IRF-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were used at a 1:500 dilution overnight at 4 °C. After washing, the membranes were incubated with appropriate secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (anti-rabbit, anti-mouse or anti-goat, 1:8000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at room temperature followed by detection with chemiluminescence. An image analysis system was used to collect and analyze data obtained from the chemiluminescent light emission (UVP Inc., Upland, CA). After analysis, membranes were stripped with Restore Western blot stripping buffer (Pierce) for 30 min at 37 °C and reprobed with anti-tubulin antibody (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-STAT1 (1:1000, Cell Signaling), or anti-PKCα (1:2000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at 37°C. Although the PKCα antibody is specific for the PKCα isoform, it also has 80% cross-reactivity with the PKCβ isoform. Immunocytochemistry—Primary microglial cells or macrophages were treated as described above. Cells were fixed with cold 100% methanol for 10 min followed by a 10-min incubation in 10% normal goat serum to block nonspecific binding. Cells were stained with OX42 antibody (CD11b) and OX6 anti-body (MHC II) at 1:1000 or 1:200 dilution, respectively, for 1 h at room temperature followed by a 30-min incubation with anti-mouse secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 or 595 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Nuclear Extract Preparation—Primary microglial cells were treated for 24 h as described above. Nuclear extracts were prepared using a NucBuster protein extraction kit (Novagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Nuclear proteins were then separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot. RNA Isolation and RT-PCR—Primary microglial cells were grown on 6-well plates at the density of 1.5 × 106 cells/well. After a 30-min preincubation with minocycline, cells were treated with 100 units/ml IFNγ with or without minocycline (100 μm) for 24 h. Cells were lysed in 1 ml of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and total RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA was treated with DNase I (Invitrogen) for 15 min at room temperature, and 1 μg of total RNA was then used for reverse transcription (RT) using oligo(dT) primers and MMLV reverse transcriptase (Retroscript kit, Ambion, Austin, TX). Following RT, 3 μl of RT reaction was utilized for 35 cycles of PCR using SuperTaq polymerase (Ambion). The sequences of primers were: 5′-CACCAAAGCACCTTGCA-3′ and 5′-CACATCTGGGGCTGTGA-3′ for CIITA; 5′-TTGTGCAGACGCAGCA-3′ and 5′-TCCTGCATTTCCCAGTGA-3′ for MHC II; 5′-AGACAGCCGCATCTTCTTGT-3′ and 5′-CCACAGTCTTCTGAGTGGCA-3′ for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The PCR products were separated on a 1% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Data Analysis—Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance and Student’s t test using SigmaStat software. All in vitro experiments were repeated at least four times, and data represent the mean ± S.E. Differences between experimental groups were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05. The clinical scores of minocycline-treated and untreated groups were analyzed by a two-way analysis of variance. Minocycline Attenuates the Clinical Course of EAE—Immunization of Dark Agouti rats with 10 μg of MOG resulted in a biphasic disease course with the onset occurring 10-12 days after immunization. The clinical course of disease was less severe in minocycline-treated animals when compared with the non-treated group (Fig. 1). Hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed a significant infiltration of leukocytes into the parenchyma of both the white and the gray matter of the spinal cord in EAE, an effect that was ameliorated by minocycline (Fig. 2). Both the number and the size of lesions in the spinal cord were decreased by minocycline treatment (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Minocycline decreases the number and size of lesions in the spinal cord. 14-μm sections of spinal cord from control animals and EAE animals either treated or untreated with minocycline were used for hematoxylin and eosin staining. A massive infiltration of leukocytes in both white matter and gray matter of spinal cord (arrows) was observed in untreated EAE animals.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Minocycline Decreases MHC II Expression in EAE—MOG-induced EAE in Dark Agouti rats is characterized by severe inflammatory lesions found predominantly in the spinal cord accompanied by a strong microglial response. In naive animals (control), the number of CD11b+ cells (microglial marker; Fig. 3, A and C) is 10 times greater than the number of MHC II+ cells (Fig. 3, B and C), suggesting that most microglia do not express MHC II in the resting state. Only a few MCH II-positive cells with a ramified morphology can be found localized mostly in the white matter of the spinal cord (Fig. 3B, arrowhead). At the onset of the disease, we did not observe any increase in the total number of CD11b+ cells; however, the density of CD11b+ cells was increased in lesion sites located adjacent to blood vessels (Fig. 3A, arrows, and 3C). Also, we noticed a change in morphology of microglial cells from ramified to amoeboid, suggesting phagocytic properties. There was a significant increase in the number of MHCII+ cells at the onset of the disease that correlated with the number of CD11b+ cells. 2 weeks after the clinical onset of EAE, the number of CD11b+ and MHC II+ cells was three times higher than at the onset. Treatment of animals with minocycline for 2 weeks decreased the number of CD11b+ cells by 24%, suggesting decreased microglial proliferation and/or decreased migration of macrophages from the periphery into the CNS parenchyma. The number of MHC II+ cells was reduced by 42% in the minocycline group, although MHC II levels were still significantly higher than those observed upon disease onset when minocycline treatment was initiated. Minocycline Decreases MHC II and CIITA Expression in Microglia—As was observed in vivo, primary microglial cells are CD11b+ (Fig. 4A), but they do not express MHC II under resting conditions. Treatment of cells with IFNγ (100 units/ml) for 24 h induced MHC II expression in 30% of the cells, and this was decreased by 55% upon treatment with minocycline (Fig. 4A). This correlated well with the quantification of MHC II proteins by Western blot, which revealed an almost 45% decrease in MHC II proteins after minocycline treatment (Fig. 4B). Minocycline also significantly decreased MHC II mRNA levels, suggesting that the inhibitory effects of minocycline occur at the transcriptional level (Fig. 5). Because the co-activator CIITA, an inducible non-DNA-binding protein, is vital for MHC II gene expression (see Fig. 9), we investigated the ability of minocycline to affect CIITA expression as a potential mechanism of minocycline inhibitory effects on MHC II mRNA. Minocycline significantly decreased IFNγ-induced CIITA mRNA, suggesting that this drug might target signaling path-ways involved in CIITA expression.FIGURE 5Minocycline (Mino) decreases MHC II and CIITA mRNA. Primary microglial cells were treated with IFNγ (100 units/ml) in the presence or absence of minocycline (100 μm) for 24 h. Total mRNA was isolated and used for RT-PCR to evaluate levels of MHC II and CIITA. Unstimulated microglia did not express MHC II or CIITA. mRNA for both proteins was induced by IFNγ and was abolished in the presence of minocycline.

The JAK-STAT signaling pathway is central to IFNγ-induced responses; therefore, we first examined the effect of minocycline on the activation of STAT1 (Fig. 6A). Treatment of microglia with IFNγ for 15 min resulted in STAT1 activation, which was assessed by phospho-specific antibodies. Surprisingly, minocycline did not affect phosphorylation of STAT1, indicating that its inhibitory effect on MHC II expression likely occurs downstream of this protein. We next investigated minocycline effects on IRF-1 expression, a transcription factor essential for CIITA expression, and thus, for MHC II production. In IFNγ-activated microglia, the levels of IRF-1 protein were two times higher when compared with unstimulated cells, and this increase was not affected by minocycline (Fig. 6B). PKCα/βII Is Involved in MHC II Expression on Microglia—PKCα has been shown to modulate IFNγ-induced expression of MHC II in the mouse macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 (16Giroux M. Schmidt M. Descoteaux A. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 4187-4194Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In agreement with this, our previous work implicated an effect of minocycline on inhibition of PKC activity in microglial BV-2 cells (15Nikodemova M. Duncan I.D. Watters J.J. J. Neurochem. 2006; 96: 314-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), suggesting that minocycline may target MHC II via inhibition of PKC. To test this idea, we first evaluated the role of PKC in MHC II regulation in rat primary microglial cells. MHC II expression induced by IFNγ was attenuated in the presence of the PKC inhibitor Goö6976 (1.3 μm), a highly specific inhibitor of PKCα (IC50 = 2.3 nm) and PKCβI (IC50 = 6.2 nm), which does not affect Ca2+-independent PKC isoforms. Both immunohistochemistry (Fig. 4A) and Western blot analysis (Fig. 4B) revealed that MHC II expression in microglia was significantly repressed in the presence of the PKC inhibitor. Minocycline Inhibits Phosphorylation and Nuclear Translocation of PKCα/βII and IRF-1—Minocycline reduced IFNγ-stimulated phosphorylation of PKCα/βII, suggesting that minocycline may modulate PKC activity (Fig. 6C). Interestingly, the increase in IFNγ-induced IRF-1 levels was prevented by Goö6976, suggesting that PKC isoforms that are not targeted by minocycline might also be involved in IRF-1 expression. Upon IFNγ stimulation, IRF-1 translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to the promoter IV region of CIITA, a transactivator critical for MHC II transcription. The recent study by Giroux et al. (16Giroux M. Schmidt M. Descoteaux A. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 4187-4194Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) showed that in RAW 264.7 macrophages, PKCα translocates to the nucleus together with IRF-1, where it increases IRF-1 transcriptional activity after IFNγ stimulation. So we sought to evaluate in microglia the effects of minocycline on the nuclear transfer of PKCα/βII and IRF-1 since the PKC inhibitor Goö6976 repressed translocation of both proteins (Fig. 7). IFNγ-induced translocation of both proteins into the nucleus was prevented by minocycline treatment (Fig. 7), implying that there is decreased IRF-1 transcriptional activity in the presence of minocycline. Minocycline Inhibits IFNγ-independent MHC II Expression—Since our data show a potent inhibitory effect of minocycline on IFNγ-inducible MHC II expression in microglia, we were interested in determining whether minocycline could also affect IFNγ-independent MHC II expression. Peritoneal macrophages isolated from naive adult Sprague-Dawley rats express high levels of MHC II proteins (Fig. 8A). In the presence of the PKC inhibitor Goö6976 MHC II, expression was abolished, suggesting that in addition to IFNγ-inducible MHC II expression, PKCα is also involved in IFNγ-independent MHC II production. As observed in microglia, minocycline also inhibited PKCα phosphorylation in macrophages (Fig. 8B), suggesting that its inhibitory effect on MHC II expression is mediated via interactions with PKCα. Minocycline has profound anti-inflammatory properties quite separate from its antibiotic function. Since minocycline has the greatest permeability of all tetracyclines through the blood-brain barrier, this drug is well suited for treatment of CNS disorders. In EAE, minocycline treatment, which started at the onset of clinical symptoms, considerably decreased the severity of the clinical course of disease. The significant difference in clinical score between the treated and untreated groups was immediately observed after the first day of minocycline treatment. Therapeutically, this is important in MS because minocycline treatment would likely be initiated at the time of clinically active disease. In our study, histological examination of the spinal cord revealed that minocycline reduced both the number and the size of lesions and decreased expression of MHC II in microglia. Microglia are the primary antigen-presenting cells of the CNS, and they are the main immune effector cells mediating this demyelinating disease (4O'Keefe G.M. Nguyen V.T. Benveniste E.N. J. Neurovirol. 2002; 8: 496-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In EAE, activated microglia differentiate into macrophage-like and dendritic-like cells, and they up-regulate levels of MHC II and co-stimulatory proteins that are necessary for antigen presentation to the encephalitogenic T cells (7Ponomarev E.D. Shriver L.P. Maresz K. Dittel B.N. J. Neurosci. Res. 2005; 81: 374-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Moreover, activated microglia can recruit additional T cells from the periphery, thus amplifying the inflammatory process in the CNS. A number of studies suggest that the immune response induced by immunization with MOG is predominantly mediated by autoreactive CD4+ T cells, although the involvement of CD8+ T cells and B cells has also been shown (17Behi M.E. Dubucquoi S. Lefranc D. Zephir H. De Seze J. Vermersch P. Prin L. Immunol. Lett. 2005; 96: 11-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 18McDole J. Johnson A.J. Pirko I. Neurol. Res. 2006; 28: 256-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The ability of microglia to prime naive CD4+ cells and to activate memory CD4+ cells in vitro in an antigen-specific and MHC II-restricted manner is well documented (17Behi M.E. Dubucquoi S. Lefranc D. Zephir H. De Seze J. Vermersch P. Prin L. Immunol. Lett. 2005; 96: 11-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 19Fontana A. Frei K. Bodmer S. Hofer E. Immunol.

Immunol. 1987; 17: 1271-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). The significance of microglial cells in EAE as well as in other CNS pathologies is apparent, and in recent years, these cells have become an attractive target for development of new therapeutic strategies for CNS disorders. Although the exact mechanisms of minocycline anti-inflammatory effects are still poorly understood, they may include the inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase-2 activity, the inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase, prostag-landin E2, caspase-1, caspase-3, and COX-2 expressions and the impairment of cytokine production (9Chen M. Ona V.O. Li M. Ferrante R.J. Fink K.B. Zhu S. Bian J. Guo L. Farrell L.A. Hersch S.M. Hobbs W. Vonsattel J.P. Cha J.H. Friedlander R.M. Nat.

Attur M.G. Thakker G.D. Patel P.D. Vyas P.R. Patel R.N. Patel I.R. Abramson S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14014-14019Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 22Kim S.S. Kong P.J.

Brain. 2002; 125: 1297-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). It has been shown that some of these effects are manifested, at least in part, by the inhibition of MAP kinases (10Du Y. Ma Z. Lin S. Dodel R.C. Gao F. Bales K.R. Triarhou L.C. Chernet E. Perry K.W. Nelson D.L. Luecke S. Phebus L.A. Bymaster F.P. Paul S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Koistinaho J.E. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7527-7533Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar), although the exact intracellular and molecular mechanisms of minocycline actions on the expression of these genes remain poorly understood. Our results show that inhibition of MHC II expression by minocycline involves the inhibition of PKC that subsequently prevents nuclear translocation of the transcription factor IRF-1, which ultimately controls MHC II expression. Because PKC activity has such pleiotropic effects in cells, the ability of minocycline to affect such a wide array of gene expression may involve the interaction with PKC. High levels of MHC II molecules are expressed constitutively on professional antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells and B-cells, whereas in other cell types, including microglia, MHC II expression can be induced by IFNγ. In MS or EAE, IFNγ is produced by T cells infiltrating into the CNS parenchyma. The regulation of MHC II proteins is complex and occurs mostly at the transcriptional level, involving several transcription factors acting on the MHC II promoter (Fig. 9). However, these factors, although necessary, are not sufficient for activation of MHC II promoter on their own. Recruitment of CIITA, a transcriptional co-activator that binds to the multiprotein complex of transcription factors on the MHC II promoter to initiate its transcription, is absolutely required for both constitutive and IFNγ-inducible MHC II expression (14Harton J.A. Ting J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6185-6194Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 25Steimle V. Siegrist C.A. Mottet A. Lisowska-Grospierre B. Mach B. Science. 1994; 265: 106-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). CIITA-deficient mice lack inducible MHC II expression and have sparse constitutive MHC II expression on subsets of thymic stromal cells (26Chang C.H. Guerder S. Hong S.C. van Ewijk W. Flavell R.A. Immunity. 1996; 4: 167-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The expression of the CIITA gene is cell-specific and is controlled by the alternative usage of three promoters, depending on cell type (4O'Keefe G.M. Nguyen V.T. Benveniste E.N. J. Neurovirol. 2002; 8: 496-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 27Zika E. Ting J.P. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2005; 17: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Promoter I controls the constitutive expression of CIITA, and subsequently, MHC II in dendritic cells. Promoter III is primarily responsible for controlling constitutive expression in B lymphocytes, and promoter IV is used to regulate the IFNγ-inducible expression of CIITA in cells such as microglia (4O'Keefe G.M. Nguyen V.T. Benveniste E.N. J. Neurovirol. 2002; 8: 496-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). After binding to its membrane receptor, IFNγ activates a signaling cascade leading to the activation of STAT1. STAT1 activation is subsequently involved in the regulation of IRF-1 and CIITA expression. Both STAT1 and IRF-1 transcription factors are necessary for inducible CIITA expression from promoter IV (Fig. 9). In our experiments, IFNγ induced MHC II expression in 30% of microglial cells, which was reduced by more than 50% in the presence of minocycline. Since our results showed that minocycline decreased IFNγ-induced CIITA mRNA levels, we hypothesized that minocycline may affect the activation status of STAT1 and/or IRF-1 in primary microglial cells. However, interestingly, we observed that minocycline did not affect either IFNγ-induced STAT1 phosphorylation or IRF-1 expression, suggesting that these transcription factors are not direct targets for minocycline action. Several studies have showed that the activation of PKC is required for MHC II expression, and the PKCα isoform specifically has been identified to regulate IFNγ-induced expression of MHC II by modulating the transcriptional activity of IRF-1 on the CIITA promoter in murine RAW264.7 macrophage cells (16Giroux M. Schmidt M. Descoteaux A. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 4187-4194Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Our present data revealed that PKCα/β is involved in both the constitutive and the IFNγ-inducible MHC II expression in macrophages and microglia, respectively. We have previously shown that minocycline inhibited PMA (a PKC activator) -induced activation of p38 and JNK1/2 MAP kinases, suggesting that minocycline interfered with PKC activity; however, we did not identify which PKC isoform was affected by minocycline (15Nikodemova M. Duncan I.D. Watters J.J. J. Neurochem. 2006; 96: 314-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Since it is known that PKCα is involved in the regulation of MHC II expression in macrophages, in this study, we investigated the minocycline effect on this PKC isoform in microglia. Minocycline significantly decreased IFNγ-induced PKCα/βII phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of this enzyme. It is difficult to distinguish between PKCα and PKCβII isoforms because commercially available PKCα antibodies have up to 80% cross-reactivity with PKCβ. Nuclear translocation of IRF-1 induced by IFNγ was inhibited in the presence of Goö6976, a PKCα inhibitor, suggesting that this process is PKC-dependent. However, it remains unclear how PKCα facilitates IRF-1 translocation into the nucleus. In addition, we found that minocycline also inhibited nuclear translocation of IRF-1, implicating decreased transcriptional activity of IRF-1 in the nucleus. This observation correlates well with the inhibitory effect of minocycline on CIITA mRNA expression. Interestingly, we found that PKCα/βII is involved in the regulation of both the IFNγ-dependent and the IFNγ-independent MHC II expression; however, further studies are needed to elucidate the exact mechanism of PKCα participation. Nonetheless, the ability of minocycline to generally inhibit IFNγ-independent MHC II expression suggests that this drug might also affect the antigen presentation capacity of professional antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells. This process is necessary for the activation of CD4+ T cells in the periphery prior to their infiltration to the CNS. In our previous study, the administration of minocycline from the day of immunization in a high dose MOG-induced EAE model resulted in a significant delay in the onset and severity of the clinical course of disease (13Popovic N. Schubart A. Goetz B.D. Zhang S.C. Linington C. Duncan I.D. Ann. Neurol. 2002; 51: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), suggesting that the inhibition of MHC II expression on peripheral macrophages and/or dendritic cells could be one of the mechanisms by which minocycline exerted its anti-inflammatory effects in this EAE model. In conclusion, our data show that minocycline significantly decreased the severity of the clinical course of EAE and that these effects may be at least partially mediated by the inhibitory effect of minocycline on the MHC II expression in microglia. Our in vitro experiments on primary microglial cells revealed that the molecular mechanisms of minocycline action involve the inhibition of IFNγ-induced PKCα/βII phosphorylation and subsequent inhibition of IRF-1 translocation to the nucleus, resulting in decreased CIITA expression. Decreased expression of this transcriptional co-activator is directly related to the expression of MHC II, providing a potential mechanistic link between the attenuated symptom severity of EAE and decreased antigen presentation capacity of CNS resident microglia. We are grateful to Dr. Zsuzsana Fabry (University of Wisconsin) for critical reading and valuable comments on the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2042968117,"TRPV2 has been proposed as a potential pain target, in part due to its relatedness to the nociceptor TRPV1 and to its reported activation by noxious high temperatures (>52 °C). However, TRPV2 responses to heat as well as to the nonselective agonist 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) have not been universally reproduced in other laboratories, leading to debate about the activation properties of this channel. Here, we report the expression of rat, mouse, and human TRPV2 in HEK293 cells and the differential properties of their responses to heat and 2-APB. Expression of mouse or rat TRPV2 in HEK293 cells resulted in robust channel activation when induced by either temperature (>53 °C) or 2-APB. By contrast, expression of human TRPV2 did not lead to detectable activation by either of these stimuli. Human TRPV2 protein was expressed at levels comparable with those of rat TRPV2, exhibited similar surface localization and responded to a novelly identified TRPV2 agonist, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol, indicating that human TRPV2 is functionally expressed on the cell surface. Studies using deletion mutants and chimeras between rat and human TRPV2 indicated that both amino- and carboxyl-cytoplasmic termini of rat TRPV2 are important for responses to heat and 2-APB but can be supplied in trans to form an active channel. The present study not only confirms and extends previous reports demonstrating that rat and mouse TRPV2 respond to 2-APB and noxious heat but also indicates that further investigation will be required to elucidate TRPV2 activation and regulatory mechanisms.

TRP (transient receptor potential) proteins comprise a large family of nonselective cation channels responsible for diverse cellular functions, including the transduction of thermal, chemical, and mechanical stimuli, as well as the regulation of cellular calcium levels. Named after the Drosophila phototransduction pathway mutant trp, with which they share common structural homology (1Cosens D.J. Manning A. Nature. 1969; 224: 285-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), these proteins are characterized by a six-transmembrane domain region, including a pore and cytosolically oriented NH2 and COOH termini, the former of which typically includes one or more ankyrin domain repeats (for a review, see Ref. 2Ramsey I.S. Delling M. Clapham D.E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2006; 68: 619-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1240) Google Scholar). Recent studies have provided evidence that there are at least six distinct TRP channels that are temperature sensors (3Wang H. Woolf C.J. Neuron. 2005; 46: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). These thermo-TRPs are believed to be important transducers of temperature to the nervous system, including the sensation of pain due to noxious heat and cold. TRPV1, the most extensively characterized member of the TRP family, is activated by moderate heat (∼43 °C), capsaicin, protons, and certain lipidic mediators, such as anandamide (4Tominaga M.

Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (7143) Google Scholar). Moreover, numerous studies using a variety of experimental approaches have implicated TRPV1 in the transduction of pain signals in animal models of hyperalgesia (6Caterina M.J. Leffler A. Malmberg A.B. Martin W.J. Trafton J. Petersen-Zeitz K.R. Koltzenburg M. Basbaum A.I. Julius D. Science. 2000; 288: 306-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar, 7Davis J.B. Gray J.

Nature. 2000; 405: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar); hence, this TRP has been aggressively pursued as a target for the alleviation of certain types of pain. The TRP vanilloid subfamily, type 2 channel (TRPV2; also known as vanilloid receptor-like 1, or VRL-1), is closely related to TRPV1 and was identified by homologous cloning from rats and humans (8Caterina M.J. Rosen T.A. Tominaga M. Brake A.J. Julius D. Nature. 1999; 398: 436-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar) as well as mice (9Kanzaki M. Zhang Y.Q. Mashima H. Li L. Shibata H. Kojima I. Nat. Cell. Biol. 1999; 1: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Unlike TRPV1, however, no selective activators of TRPV2 have been reported. Functional studies have revealed that rat TRPV2 responds to noxious heat, with an activation threshold above 52 °C (8Caterina M.J. Rosen T.A. Tominaga M. Brake A.J. Julius D. Nature. 1999; 398: 436-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar) and that mouse TRPV2 responds to changes in osmolarity or to membrane stretch (10Muraki K. Iwata Y. Katanosaka Y. Ito T. Ohya S. Shigekawa M. Imaizumi Y. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 829-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). The hypothesis that TRPV2 is an endogenous sensor of noxious heat and mechanical stretch is further supported by findings that it is expressed in medium to large diameter Aδ mechano- and thermosensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglion (8Caterina M.J. Rosen T.A. Tominaga M. Brake A.J. Julius D. Nature. 1999; 398: 436-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar, 11Lewinter R.D. Skinner K. Julius D. Basbaum A.I. J. Comp. Neurol. 2004; 470: 400-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Interestingly, translocation of mouse TRPV2 to the cell surface has been reported to be stimulated by insulin-like growth factor-I, suggesting an additional role in cell growth and prompting its alternate appellation as growth factor-regulated channel (9Kanzaki M. Zhang Y.Q. Mashima H. Li L. Shibata H. Kojima I. Nat. Cell. Biol. 1999; 1: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 12Boels K. Glassmeier G. Herrmann D. Riedel I.B. Hampe W. Kojima I. Schwarz J.R. Schaller H.C. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3599-3606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that TRPV2 protein levels were up-regulated in rat dorsal root ganglion after intra-plantar injection of complete Freund's adjuvant to induce peripheral inflammation (13Shimosato G. Amaya F. Ueda M. Tanaka Y. Decosterd I. Tanaka M. Pain. 2005; 119: 225-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In addition, TRPV2 protein expression was also up-regulated in rat sympathetic postganglionic neurons following nerve injury (14Gaudet A.D. Williams S.J. Hwi L.P.R. Ramer M.S. Brain Res. 2004; 1017: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Together, these studies suggest that TRPV2 may be involved in. However, the proposed role of TRPV2 as a nociceptor still remains a topic of some debate among researchers. Thus, although the mouse ortholog exhibited a mere 40% increase above basal current in response to a 54 °C stimulus in transfected CHO cells (9Kanzaki M. Zhang Y.Q. Mashima H. Li L. Shibata H. Kojima I. Nat. Cell. Biol. 1999; 1: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), TRPV2 activation by heat could not be reproduced at all in other laboratories (15Benham C.D. Gunthorpe M.J. Davis J.B. Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Furthermore, although TRPV2 is found in the sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglion, it is also found in nonneuronal tissues, including the lung, spleen, and intestine (8Caterina M.J. Rosen T.A. Tominaga M. Brake A.J. Julius D. Nature. 1999; 398: 436-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar), where it would seem unlikely to have a temperature-sensing role, particularly in the proposed range for TRPV2 (i.e. >52 °C). Little else is known about TRPV2 responses, in part because of the current lack of selective pharmacological tools and knock-out animals. Recently, it was reported that 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB), 2The abbreviations used are: 2-APB, 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate; Δ9-THC, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol; HA, hemagglutinin; aa, amino acids. a nonselective TRP modulator, was able to induce calcium influx (EC50 ∼ 130 μm) in HEK293 cells transfected with mouse TRPV2 (16Hu H.-Z. Gu Q. Wang C. Colton C.K. Tang J. Kinoshita-Kawada M. Lee L.-Y. Wood J.D. Zhu M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35741-35748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). However, TRPV2 activation by 2-APB was not observed by other laboratories (17Bender F.L. Mederos Y.S.M. Li Y. Ji A. Weihe E. Gudermann T. Schafer M.K. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 2005; 15: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 18Chung M.K. Lee H. Mizuno A. Suzuki M. Caterina M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21569-21575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Here, we compare the functional expression of human, mouse, and rat TRPV2 in HEK293 cells and the properties of their responses to heat and 2-APB using calcium imaging and patch clamp electrophysiological assays. We demonstrate that there are species-specific differences in the activation properties of TRPV2 and show that both NH2- and COOH-terminal domains of TRPV2 are involved in conferring responsivity to both 2-APB and noxious heat. Reagents—2-APB was purchased from Sigma and stored at -20 °C as a 1 m stock solution in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide. Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) was from Sigma and was supplied as a 30 mg/ml stock in ethanol. Cloning and Expression—Genes encoding human, mouse, and rat TRPV2 (accession numbers BC051305, BC005415, and BC089215, respectively) were obtained from Open Biosystems, Inc. (Huntsville, AL), and the open reading frames of each gene were subcloned into the expression vector, pCI-neo (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). For constructs containing a hemagglutinin (HA) tag, the DNA sequence tccaggttctatccatacgacgtacctgactacgcctaa (encoding amino acids SRFYPYDVPDYA) was appended to the 3′end by PCR. The generated fragment was digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes and then reinserted into the expression vector by ligation. Construction of the rat/human chimeras was performed by overlap PCR joining of DNA encoding portions of the TRPV2 open reading frame from each species to form full-length TRPV2 hybrids. For construct RRH, DNA encoding rat TRPV2 amino acids 1-646 was fused upstream of and in frame with DNAs encoding human TRPV2 amino acids 647-764. In a similar manner, construct HRR was created to express human TRPV2 amino acids 1-390 fused to rat TRPV2 amino acids 393-761. For construct RHR, DNA encoding human TRPV2 amino acids 391-646 was joined with DNAs to encode rat TRPV2 amino acids 1-392 at the human amino terminus and rat TRPV2 amino acids 647-761 at the carboxyl terminus. The open reading frames of all constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. A HEK293 cell line that exhibited a low background response to 2-APB (a kind gift from Michael Zhu at Ohio State University) was used as the expression host. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected for adherent cell transfection using FuGene 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science), as recommended by the manufacturer. Stable TRPV2-expressing cell lines were prepared by transfecting HEK293 cells in the same manner and then selecting for G418 resistance (400 μg/ml) at 48 h post-transfection. Clonal lines were then generated by limited dilution of surviving cells at ∼5 days post-drug selection. Individual clones were expanded and evaluated by immunoblot and/or calcium mobilization assays to identify clones with the highest TRPV2 expression levels. Calcium Mobilization Assays—Transfected cells were replated 24 h posttransfection into 96- or 384-well plates and analyzed ∼24 h later using FLIPR or FLEX Station instruments with Calcium 3 Assay dye (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA), as recommended by the manufacturer. FLIPR assays were conducted as previously described (19Liu Y. Lubin M.L. Reitz T.L. Wang Y. Colburn R.W. Flores C.M. Qin N. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2006; 530: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Temperature activation studies were performed using a Flex Station in a 96-well plate format. After a 1-h incubation in 200 μl of 1 × loading dye buffer at 37 °C, 160 μl of buffer was removed from each well prior to insertion of the cell plate into the Flex Station chamber. Temperature activation was triggered by the addition of 160 μl of heated (85 °C) isotonic HEPES buffer (same components as loading dye buffer minus the Calcium 3 dye) into the compound plate just prior to closing the chamber door and starting the run. All of the pipette tip rack and empty buffer plate were pre-equilibrated to 37 °C. Empirical testing showed that, after allowing for elapsed time before the buffer addition to the well (∼30 s) and dilution with the sample buffer in each well, an initial peak temperature of ∼53 °C was obtained. Electrophysiology—Transfected cells were plated on glass coverslips, maintained in 5% CO2 at 37 °C, and used 1-2 days after plating. Recordings from TRPV2-expressing HEK293 cells were performed using the whole-cell patch clamp technique. Control and test solutions were applied onto the cell at 0.5 ml/min via a gravity-fed perfusion system. Recordings were performed at 22 °C. Currents were sampled (Digidata 1322A), amplified, and filtered at 2 kHz (Axopatch 200B) and acquired and analyzed using pClamp 9.0 (all instruments/software from Molecular Devices). 2-APB-activated ramp currents were elicited with a 600-ms voltage ramp from -100 to +60 mV at a sampling rate of 10 kHz. The holding potential was -100 mV. The standard extracellular solution contained 132 mm NaCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4. Cell Surface Expression—Biotinylation and purification of cell surface proteins were performed using a biotinylation kit available from Pierce and used as reported previously (20Liu Y. Qin N. Reitz T. Wang Y. Flores C.M. Epilepsy Res. 2006; 70: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2.5 × 106 HEK293 cells were seeded onto 75-cm2 poly-d-lysine-coated flasks (BD Biosciences) 24 h prior to transfection. At 48 h post-transfection, the cells were washed and biotinylated while they still adhered to the flask; the reaction was then quenched, the cells were lysed, and the surface labeled proteins were purified on avidin-immobilized resin. After extensive washing to remove unlabeled proteins, the biotinylated proteins were eluted, separated on 10-20% polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen), and transferred to nitrocellulose as recommended by the manufacturer. Anti-HA staining utilized a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (2013819; Roche Applied Science) at a 1:500 dilution, which was detected after incubation and washing using the ECL Plus detection reagent (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp.), as recommended by the manufacturer. Antibody Staining—An antibody directed to the carboxyl terminus of native rat TRPV2 (AB5398P) was purchased from Chemicon International Inc. (Temacula, CA). Anti-human TRPV2 antibody was developed in rabbits using as an immunogen a synthetic peptide (EDGASEENYVPVQLLQSN), which corresponds to amino acids 747-764 of the carboxyl terminus of human TRPV2. The peptide was synthesized and conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and the antibody was raised and affinity-purified by Quality Controlled Biochemicals, Inc. (Hopkinton, MA). The resulting affinity-purified antibody was used for Western blotting analysis. Immunofluorescent staining of HA-labeled proteins was performed using fluorescein-conjugated anti-HA antibody (1988506; Roche Applied Science) at a concentration of 1 μg/ml. Cells for immunofluorescence studies were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated slides (BD Biosciences) 24 h prior to staining and were fixed and permeabilized by a 10-min treatment with 10% formalin fixative solution (Sigma) containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Microscopy and Imaging—Fluorescent Mounting Medium (Dako Corp., Carpinteria, CA) was added to the fixed cell-coated slides to minimize bleaching of the fluorescent signal. Cells were viewed on an Eclipse E600 fluorescent microscope equipped with a Photometrics Coolsnap cf camera (Nikon Corp., Melville, NY), and the images were captured using Image Pro Plus software (MediaCybernetics, Inc., Silver Spring, MD). Black and white images were then pseudocolored green to better reflect the staining by the fluorescein dye-conjugated anti-HA antibody. Rodent but Not Human TRPV2 Responds to 2-APB—Responses of HEK293 cells transiently transfected with TRPV2-expressing or vector control plasmids to 2-APB were evaluated using FLIPR calcium mobilization assays. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, 2-APB elicited a robust, concentration-dependent response in HEK293 cells expressing rat or mouse TRPV2, with EC50 values of 18 and 22 μm, respectively. At higher concentrations (i.e. >100 μm), 2-APB also elicited an endogenous response in vector-transfected HEK293 cells, with an EC50 value of 239 μm. The endogenous response was transient (lasting less than 3 min) compared with the response in rodent TRPV2-transfected cells, which was sustained throughout the assay. This background response is probably the result of 2-APB-mediated mobilization of internal calcium stores, which would also be detected by this assay, since 2-APB is a nonselective TRP channel modulator. When human TRPV2-transfected HEK293 cells were evaluated, there was no response to 2-APB above that observed for vector-transfected cells over a >104-fold range in 2-APB concentration. A similar response to 2-APB was observed in patch clamp studies of TRPV2-transfected cells. The responses of HEK293 cells transiently transfected with rat or human TRPV2 to the application of 2-APB (300 μm) were also compared using a voltage ramp protocol from -100 mV to +60 mV. In cells expressing rat TRPV2 (Fig. 2A), 2-APB elicited a large current response with a reversal potential near 0 mV. The current-voltage relationship of 2-APB-activated rat TRPV2 current showed dual rectification, characteristic of this channel, as reported by others (8Caterina M.J. Rosen T.A. Tominaga M. Brake A.J. Julius D. Nature. 1999; 398: 436-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar, 16Hu H.-Z. Gu Q. Wang C. Colton C.K. Tang J. Kinoshita-Kawada M. Lee L.-Y. Wood J.D. Zhu M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35741-35748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). By contrast, in human TRPV2-expressing HEK293s (Fig. 2B), the same 300 μm 2-APB concentration did not activate any measurable current. There also was no measurable background response to 2-APB in HEK293 cells alone, which is consistent with the premise that 2-APB may be causing low level internal calcium mobilization that would be detected fluorescently using FLIPR but not electrophysiologically. Rodent but Not Human TRPV2 Responds to Heat—Rat TRPV2 was previously shown to be activated by temperatures of >52 °C (8Caterina M.J. Rosen T.A. Tominaga M. Brake A.J. Julius D. Nature. 1999; 398: 436-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar). This was confirmed in cells transiently transfected with mouse or rat TRPV2 (Fig. 3A). In this experiment, the assay temperature was quickly raised to ∼53 °C by the direct addition of heated assay buffer to each well. The increases in Ca2+-activated fluorescent signal observed in either rat or mouse TRPV2 transfected cells upon exposure to elevated temperature was not due to changes in cell viability, since the cells were still able to respond to a second addition of 2-APB after heat treatment (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, the response to elevated temperature in a rat TRPV2-expressing cell line could be completely inhibited by 300 μm ruthenium red (Fig. 3B), a nonselective TRP channel blocker. However, under the same conditions in HEK293 cells transiently transfected with human TRPV2, no significant response above vector control levels was observed when the temperature was elevated to ∼53 °C (Fig. 3A). This lack of response to elevated temperature by human TRPV2 was further confirmed using cells that stably expressed human TRPV2, which were evaluated in an attempt to maximize any potential responses, since presumably, the number of expressing cells/expression levels would be higher in these cells than in transiently transfected cells. As shown in Fig. 3C, the human TRPV2 cell line did not respond to elevated temperature above controls despite detectable levels of TRPV2 product present in cell lysates (inset). TRPV2 Is on the Cell Surface and Is Functionally Expressed—One possible explanation for the lack of activity by human TRPV2 could be that human TRPV2 is not expressed as well as rodent TRPV2 in HEK293 cells. To facilitate the direct evaluation of the relative expression levels of both rat and human TRPV2, an HA tag was appended to the COOH terminus of rat and human TRPV2. The addition of this tag did not appear to affect the response of rat TRPV2 to 2-APB or noxious heat (Fig. 4, A and B). When immunoblots of cell lysates from human and rat TRPV2-HA were stained with an anti-HA antibody, human TRPV2 was shown to be expressed at higher levels relative to rat TRPV2 (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, both human and rat TRPV2-HA migrate as doublet bands at ∼100 kDa, which is consistent with previous reports for the monomeric form of the protein (21Stokes A.J. Wakano C. Del Carmen K.A. Koblan-Huberson M. Turner H. J. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 94: 669-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Additional bands are also present at higher molecular weight in both species, which others have reported to be a multimeric complex of TRPV2 that persists even under apparent denaturing SDS-PAGE conditions (21Stokes A.J. Wakano C. Del Carmen K.A. Koblan-Huberson M. Turner H. J. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 94: 669-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Another potential explanation for the lack of activity exhibited by human TRPV2 could be the lack of surface expression. To evaluate TRPV2 cell surface expression levels, equal numbers of cells transiently transfected with either rat or human TRPV2-HA were surface-biotinylated, and the biotin-labeled proteins were purified, immunoblotted, and stained with an anti-HA antibody. As shown in Fig. 3D, human TRPV2-HA was well expressed on the cell surface relative to rat TRPV2-HA. Interestingly, one of the doublet bands present in the Western blot of total cell lysate (Fig. 4C) was absent in lanes containing avidin-purified protein for both human and rat TRPV2-HA (Fig. 4D), suggesting that this form is not localized on the cell surface, a finding that was previously observed for rat TRPV2 by others (21Stokes A.J. Wakano C. Del Carmen K.A. Koblan-Huberson M. Turner H. J. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 94: 669-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Further confirmation of human TRPV2 cell surface expression was demonstrated by immunofluorescence microscopy. HEK293 cells transiently transfected with rat or human TRPV2-HA exhibited comparable levels of HA-specific staining on the cell surface (Fig. 4, E and F, respectively). Thus, human TRPV2-HA appears to be abundantly expressed on the cell surface. To determine whether human TRPV2 is fully functional, a compound screen was performed to identify additional activators of TRPV2. One such compound, Δ9-THC, was identified that activates both rat and human TRPV2, causing robust responses above that observed for the parental HEK293 cell control (Fig. 5, A and D). Furthermore, these responses were dose-dependent (Fig. 5, B and E) and could be inhibited with ruthenium red (Fig. 5, C and F). This result demonstrates that human TRPV2 is functionally expressed and activable. TRPV2 Chimera Responses—In an attempt to understand which regions of rat TRPV2 are responsible for 2-APB and heat activation, a series of chimeras were prepared between rat and human TRPV2. The proteins were divided into three domains: 1) the NH2-terminal intracellular domain; 2) the six-transmembrane domain, including the pore; and 3) the COOH-terminal intracellular domain (Fig. 6A). These domains were then exchanged to create full-length TRPV2 of mixed species origin. As shown in Fig. 6C, when the human transmembrane domain was used to replace the comparable region of rat TRPV2 (designated chimera RHR), the resulting protein was found to be highly responsive to 2-APB. To further assess the impact of intracellular regions on 2-APB responses, two additional chimeras were constructed: chimera RRH, which is composed of rat NH2-terminal and transmembrane domains and a human COOH terminus, and chimera HRR, which is composed of a human NH2-terminal domain and rat transmembrane and COOH-terminal domains. Neither of these chimeras responded to 2-APB (Fig. 6C), although their expression levels were comparable with that of rat and human TRPV2 (Fig. 6B). However, when both of these inactive chimeras, RRH and HRR, were co-expressed in HEK293 cells, a full response to 2-APB was restored, albeit with a more rapid drop in fluorescent signal after activation. Furthermore, coexpression of equal levels of full-length, non-chimeric human and rat TRPV2 led to 2-APB responses that were comparable with those of rat TRPV2 alone (data not shown). By contrast, each of the chimeras appeared to be largely unresponsive to activation by heat (Fig. 6D). In particular, neither chimera RHR nor the combination of chimera RRH and chimera HRR had significant responses to temperature elevation in this assay. TRPV2 Deletion Mutant Activities—Since studies using the above chimeras implicated both the N- and COOH termini as being responsible for the activity differences observed between rat and human TRPV2, a series of deletion mutants of each intracellular domain of rat TRPV2 was prepared (Figs. 7A and 8A) and evaluated to more precisely define the regions conferring responsivity to 2-APB and heat. NH2-terminal mutants lacking as much as the first 65 aa (mutant ΔN65) were still responsive to 100 μm 2-APB (Fig. 7C) and 53 °C (Fig. 7D). However, when NH2-terminal deletions were 83 or 120 aa, (mutants ΔN83 and ΔN120, respectively), the mutants were inactive (Fig. 7A), although they were well expressed (Fig. 7B). Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that both of these mutants appeared not to be well surface-localized (data not shown). Mutants of rat TRPV2 lacking the COOH-terminal 11, 23, or 32 aa (Fig. 8A) were also responsive to 100 μm 2-APB (Fig. 8C) and 53 °C (Fig. 8D), despite the removal of a potential protein kinase C phosphorylation site at Ser740 in the -23 and -32 mutants. The ΔC55 mutant displayed only minimal activation by 2-APB and heat, but the decreased responses may be due to protein instability, since considerably less protein was detected on Western immunoblots (Fig. 8B).FIGURE 8Activity of COOH-terminal rat TRPV2 mutants.

https://openalex.org/W2069207490,"Rituximab is a widely used monoclonal antibody drug for treating certain lymphomas and autoimmune diseases. To understand the molecular mechanism of recognition of human CD20 by Rituximab, we determined the crystal structure of the Rituximab Fab in complex with a synthesized peptide comprising the CD20 epitope (residues 163-187) at 2.6-Aå resolution. The combining site of the Fab consists of four complementarity determining regions that form a large, deep pocket to accommodate the epitope peptide. The bound peptide assumes a unique cyclic conformation that is constrained by a disulfide bond and a rigid proline residue (Pro172). The 170ANPS173 motif of CD20 is deeply embedded into the pocket on the antibody surface and plays an essential role in the recognition and binding of Rituximab. The antigen-antibody interactions involve both hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts and display a high degree of structural and chemical complementarity. These results provide a molecular basis for the specific recognition of CD20 by Rituximab as well as valuable information for development of improved antibody drugs with better specificity and higher affinity.

CD20 is a pan-B cell marker expressed from pre-B cells until B cells are differentiated into plasma cells (1Stashenko P. Nadler L.M. Hardy R. Schlossman S.F. J. Immunol. 1980; 125: 1678-1685PubMed Google Scholar). It is a tetraspan membrane protein that is predicted to contain a large extracellular loop (about residues 142 to 182) and to form oligomers on the cell surface (2Teeling J.L. Mackus W.J.

Although the precise function of CD20 remains unclear, biochemical and cell biological data have shown that it seems to form or regulate a voltage-independent calcium channel (3Bubien J.K. Zhou L.J.

Despite the limited knowledge about its function, several lines of evidence have clearly demonstrated that CD20 is an ideal target for passive immunotherapy of B-cell lymphoma: it is highly expressed in more than 80% of the B-cell lymphomas but not in stem cells, pro-B cells, normal plasma cells, or other normal tissues; it remains on the cell surface without substantial internalization after cross-linking with antibodies; and it is not shed to the circulation to inhibit the antibody therapy (6Anderson K.C.

Rituximab (Rituxan,® IDEC-C2B8) was the first Food and Drug Administration approved mAb drug for the treatment of malignancy. Although it was originally used for treating low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Rituximab has been proven to be also effective against other types of lymphomas (9Leget G.A. Czuczman M.S. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1998; 10: 548-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 10Boye J. Elter T. Engert A. Ann.

Multiple mechanisms have been proposed for the action of Rituximab in the depletion of B cells including its ability to mediate complement-dependent cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, and to induce cell apoptosis (reviewed in Refs. 14Smith M.R. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7359-7368Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar and 15Jazirehi A.R. Bonavida B. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2121-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). With the expansion of the clinical application of Rituximab in the treatment of lymphoproliferative diseases, it has been noticed that intensity of CD20 expression on B cells varies in patients that may affect the binding and efficacy of Rituximab therapy (16Keating M. O'Brien S. Semin. Oncol. 2000; 27: 86-90PubMed Google Scholar, 17McLaughlin P. Hagemeister F.B. Rodriguez M.A. Sarris A.H. Pate O. Younes A. Lee M.S. Dang N.H. Romaguera J.E. Preti A.H. McAda N. Cabanillas F. Semin. Oncol. 2000; 27: 37-41PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is rational to expect that new antibodies with higher affinity and better specificity developed based on Rituximab might be beneficial in clinical use, especially for patients who have low expression levels of CD20. Besides Rituximab and Zevalin® (the prototype of Rituximab 2B8 attached by a radioactive substance 90Y), another mAb specific to human CD20, namely B1, in both native and radioderivative forms (Bexxar,® Tositumomab and 131I-Tositumomab), was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in 2003 (18Garber K. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2003; 95: 189Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). These antibody drugs along with some other mAbs against CD20 such as 1F5, AT80, and 2H7 were suggested to most likely recognize the same region (Tyr165 to Tyr182) of the large extracellular loop of human CD20 with fine specificities (2Teeling J.L. Mackus W.J. Wiegman L.J. van den Brakel J.H. Beers S.A. French R.R. van Meerten T. Ebeling S. Vink T. Slootstra J.W. Parren P.W. Glennie M.J. van de Winkel J.G. J.

However, these antibodies vary considerably in their functional activities. For example, treatment of B cells with most mAbs promotes segregation of CD20 into detergent-insoluble lipid raft, whereas B1 is the exception. This property seems to be correlated with the ability of the antibodies to mediate complement-dependent cytotoxicity but irrespective of activation of cell apoptosis pathways (20Deans J.P.

To understand the functional diversity of CD20 mAbs and the underlying mechanisms, identification of the epitope of CD20 recognized by Rituximab and other CD20-targeted mAbs has raised great interest in recent years. Sequence comparison of human and murine CD20 reveals that although the two species share 73% sequence identity, the large extracellular loop is less conserved as 16 of the approximate 43 amino acids are different (19Polyak M.J. Deans J.P. Blood. 2002; 99: 3256-3262Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies by exchanging variant residues of the large extracellular loop between human CD20 and mouse CD20 at the equivalent position indicate that residues Ala170 and Pro172 of human CD20 are critical determinants for the CD20 epitope (19Polyak M.J. Deans J.P. Blood. 2002; 99: 3256-3262Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Using a process of biopanning of a phage display peptide library consisting of randomized 7-mer cyclic peptides, it has been shown that an NPS motif corresponding to 171NPS173 of human CD20 is essential for Rituximab binding and Ala170 can be substituted by Ser (4Perosa F. Favoino E. Caragnano M.A. Dammacco F. Blood. 2006; 107: 1070-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Similar studies have also defined a discontinuous epitope that comprises 170ANPS173 and 182YCYSI185 of CD20 joined together spatially by a disulfide bond between Cys167 and Cys183 (23Binder M. Otto F. Mertelsmann R. Veelken H. Trepel M. Blood. 2006; 108: 1975-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, the underlying mechanism of the recognition and binding of Rituximab with the CD20 epitope remains unclear. We report here the crystal structure of the Rituximab Fab fragment in complex with an epitope peptide of the large extracellular loop (residues 163-187) of CD20 that provides the molecular basis for the antigen-antibody recognition and binding. Analysis of the complex structure explains very well biochemical data from the epitope-mapping studies and provides useful hints for the design and development of improved antibody drugs. Preparation of Antibody and Peptide—Rituximab was purchased from Roche. The Fab fragment was obtained by papain digestion of Rituximab and purified by cation exchange chromatography using SP-Sepharose FF (GE Healthcare) followed by hydrophobic interaction chromatography using phenyl-Sepharose HP (GE Healthcare). The purity and homogeneity of the Fab fragment was characterized by SDS-PAGE and dynamic light scattering analyses. The protein sample was concentrated to 8 mg/ml and then exchanged into a stock buffer (100 mm NaCl and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) for crystallization. The amino acid sequence of the Fab fragment was determined according to United States patent 5843439 (42Anderson D.R. Hanna N. Leonard J.E. Newman R.A. Reff M.E. Rastetter W.H. U. S. patent. 1998; 439 (December 1): 5843Google Scholar). A 25-mer cyclic peptide (NIYNCEPANPSEKNSPSTQYCYSIQ) corresponding to residues 163-187 of the large extracellular loop of human CD20 was synthesized in which an intra-chain disulfide bond was introduced between Cys167 and Cys183 (Shanghai Science Peptide Biological Technology). The quality of the peptide was determined by analytical reverse-phase chromatography and mass spectral analysis with a purity of greater than 95%. Crystallization and Diffraction Data Collection—Initial crystallization trials of the Rituximab Fab fragment itself yielded large crystals that, however, did not diffract x-ray beyond 7-Aå resolution and could not be used for structure determination. For co-crystallization experiments, the purified Rituximab Fab and the epitope peptide were mixed at a molar ratio of 1:5 at 4 °C for 12 h. Co-crystallization was carried out using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method by mixing equal volumes of the protein/peptide mixture solution and a reservoir solution (0.2 m calcium acetate, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, and 18% PEG8000). Square shaped crystals grew to a maximum size of 0.1 × 0.1 × 0.2 mm3 at 4 °C in 2 weeks. For diffraction data collection, crystals were cryostabilized by Paratone-N (Hampton Research) and then flash-cooled to -170 °C. Diffraction data were collected to 2.6-Aå resolution at beamline NW12 of Photon Factory, Japan, and processed using suite HKL2000 (24Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

The structure of the Fab fragment of human mAb A5B7 (26Banfield M.J. King D.J. Mountain A. Brady R.L. Proteins. 1997; 29: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank code 1AD0) was used as the search model. Structure refinement was carried out by CNS using standard protocols consisting of conjugate-gradient energy minimization, torsion-constrained molecular dynamics simulated annealing, group B factor refinement, and individual B factor refinement (27Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

The stereochemistry of the structure model was analyzed with Procheck (29Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Zemla A. Wilson I.A. Rupp B. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 357: 1566-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Figures were prepared using programs Ribbons (31Carson M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 493-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar) and Pymol (32DeLano W.L. Pymol. 2002; (pymol.sourceforge.net)Google Scholar). Overall Structure of the Rituximab Fab-CD20 Epitope Peptide Complex—Recent studies have identified the epitope of CD20 recognized by Rituximab being a sequence motif located at the large extracellular loop of CD20 consisting of 170ANPS173 (4Perosa F. Favoino E. Caragnano M.A. Dammacco F. Blood. 2006; 107: 1070-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 19Polyak M.J. Deans J.P. Blood. 2002; 99: 3256-3262Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 23Binder M. Otto F. Mertelsmann R. Veelken H. Trepel M. Blood. 2006; 108: 1975-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To understand the structural basis of the recognition of CD20 by Rituximab, we synthesized a 25-mer peptide mimic of the epitope of CD20 comprising the CD20 sequence from Asn163 to Gln187 (numbered according to the CD20 sequence). To mimic the conformation of the CD20 epitope, an intra-chain disulfide bond was introduced between residues Cys167 and Cys183 of the synthesized peptide because such linkage has been found in human CD20 expressed in Escherichia coli and probably exists naturally (33Ernst J.A. Li H. Kim H.S. Nakamura G.R. Yansura D.G. Vandlen R.L. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 15150-15158Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This disulfide linkage has also been implicated to play an important role in the recognition and binding of the epitope by Rituximab because disruption of the disulfide bond abolishes the binding of CD20 to Rituximab and reconstruction of the disulfide bond can partially restore the binding (33Ernst J.A. Li H. Kim H.S. Nakamura G.R. Yansura D.G. Vandlen R.L. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 15150-15158Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The peptide was conjugated to a protein carrier keyhole limpet hemocyanin and shown to have similar reactivity with Rituximab as the keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated cyclic peptides Rp15-C and Rp3-C (4Perosa F. Favoino E. Caragnano M.A. Dammacco F. Blood. 2006; 107: 1070-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay binding assay (supplementary Fig. S1A). Specificity of the reactivity was also confirmed by peptide blocking assays with immunofluorescence and complement-dependent cytotoxicity using Raji cells (supplementary Fig. S1, B and C). The CD20 epitope peptide was co-crystallized in complex with the Rituximab Fab fragment. The structure of the complex was solved using molecular replacement and refined to a resolution of 2.6 Aå with an R factor of 23.9% and a free R factor of 29.6% (Table 1). There are two Fab-peptide complexes (A and B) in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. The two complexes adopt very similar conformation (root mean square deviation of 0.96 Aå for 449 Cα atoms) except that the heavy chain in complex A contains three more residues at the C terminus than in complex B and two extra residues can be visualized at the N terminus of the peptide chain in complex B than in complex A. Due to the better electron density quality, the structure model of complex A will be used for further structural analysis and discussion. Chain identifiers L, H, and P are designated to identify the light chain and heavy chain of the Fab fragment and the epitope peptide, respectively (Fig. 1). Overall the Rituximab Fab has very good electron density, except residues from SerH135 to GlyH141 of a loop in the constant region that have high B factors above 80 Aå2 compared with the average B factor of 49 Aå2 for the whole model. The Rituximab Fab has a canonical immunoglobulin fold consisting of four β-barrel domains (Fig. 1A). The light chain comprises residues Leu1 to Leu213 that fold into the VL and CL domains, and heavy chain residues His1 to His224 that fold into the VH and CH domains. The elbow angle made by the two pseudo 2-fold axes that define the relative disposition of VH to VL and CH to CL is about 139°. There are four intra-domain disulfide bonds between CysL23 and CysL87, CysL133 and CysL193, CysH22 and CysH96, and CysH148 and CysH204, and one inter-domain disulfide bond between CysL213 and CysH224. Like other Fab structures, residue Thr50 of the light chain (ThrL50) lies in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot and forms part of the classic γ-turn (34Al-Lazikani B. Lesk A.M. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 927-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). The complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of the Rituximab Fab have ordinary length without unusual residues according to Kabat sequence data base searching (35Martin A.C. Proteins. 1996; 25: 130-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The CDR loops L1, L2, L3, H1, and H2 belong to Chothia canonical classes (34Al-Lazikani B. Lesk A.M. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 927-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar) 1, 1, 1, 1, and 2, respectively. The CDR loops L3, H1, H2, and H3 together form a large, deep pocket to accommodate the epitope peptide, whereas loops L1 and L2 are located behind loops L3 and H3 (Fig. 1A). The electron density for the bound epitope peptide is well defined without ambiguity in the positioning of the main chains and side chains (Fig. 1B). Residues CysP167 and CysP183 of the peptide form a disulfide bond that drags the termini of the peptide together covalently and makes the peptide to adopt a unique cyclic conformation (Fig. 1C). The N-terminal part of the peptide (CysP167 to AsnP171) forms a short coil that is stabilized by the tense restraints of the disulfide bond and the hydrogen-bonding interactions between residues of the coil and the CDRs of the Rituximab Fab. The middle part of the peptide forms a short 310 helix (ProP172 to GluP174) and a small loop (LysP175 to SerP177) that are stabilized by hydrogen-bonding interactions with the other regions (Table 2 and Fig. 1C). The C-terminal part of the peptide (ProP178 to TyrP184) forms a short α-helix of hydrophobic nature (TyrP182, TyrP184, and IleP186). Considering it is at the end of the extracellular loop and must be close to the cell membrane, this short α-helix might be the extension of a long transmembrane α-helix of CD20 as predicted by PredictProtein Server (36Rost B. Yachdav G. Liu J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W321-W326Crossref PubMed Scopus (1184) Google Scholar).TABLE 2Hydrogen-bonding interactions between the middle part of the peptide and the other regions of the peptideDonorAcceptorDistanceAåGluP174-NAsnP171-O3.08SerP173-OγGluP174-Oɛ22.93LysP175-NProP172-O3.15SerP177-NGluP174-O2.69SerP177-OγThrP180-Oγ12.76 Open table in a new tab Interactions between the Rituximab Fab and the Epitope Peptide—Rituximab can bind to CD20 on B cells with a binding affinity of 5 nm (37Reff M.E. Carner K. Chambers K.S. Chinn P.C. Leonard J.E. Raab R. Newman R.A. Hanna N. Anderson D.R. Blood. 1994; 83: 435-445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the complex structure, the epitope peptide of human CD20 is bound at the large pocket formed by CDR loops L3, H1, H2, and H3 of the Rituximab Fab (Fig. 2A), which is consistent with the observation that the heavy chain CDRs usually make more contributions than the light chain CDRs in antigen binding especially when Fab binds with a small antigen (38Davies D.R. Padlan E.A. Sheriff S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 439-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 39Wilson I.A. Stanfield R.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 857-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). The binding of the epitope peptide with the Fab buries a solvent accessible surface area of about 440 Aå2 (calculated with a probe radius of 1.4 Aå) which is about 23% of the peptide surface (1911 Aå2) or 2.3% of the Fab surface (19403 Aå2). Although the buried surface area is within the average range of the protein-peptide complexes (400-700 Aå2) (40Stanfield R.L. Wilson I.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), the peptide fits the CDR regions of the Rituximab Fab quite well with a high degree of structural and chemical complementarity (Fig. 2B) as indicated by the high shape complementarity value (Sc) of 0.83 (calculated with default parameters) compared with the average Sc value of 0.64-0.68 for antibody-antigen complexes (41Lawrence M.C. Colman P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 946-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar). The CDR loops L3, H1, H2, and H3 of the Fab participate in interactions primarily with four residues, 170ANPS173, of the epitope peptide that have been shown to be a critical motif on the CD20 surface for antibody recognition (2Teeling J.L. Mackus W.J. Wiegman L.J. van den Brakel J.H. Beers S.A. French R.R. van Meerten T. Ebeling S. Vink T. Slootstra J.W. Parren P.W. Glennie M.J. van de Winkel J.G. J.

Residues of the motif form a network of hydrogen bonds with residues of the surrounding CDR loops (Table 3 and Fig. 2, C and D). Specifically, the side chain of AsnP171 forms two hydrogen bonds with the side chains of SerH99 and TrpH106 of the H3 loop, respectively. The main chain carbonyl of ProP172 forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of AsnH55 of loop H2 via a water molecule; and the main chain amide and side chain Oγ of SerP173 make two hydrogen bonds with the side chain of AsnH33 of loop H1, respectively. Moreover, the residues flanking the motif including GluP168, ProP169, and LysP175 also contribute to the interactions of the peptide with the Fab by forming hydrogen bonds with AsnL93, SerH59, and ThrH58, respectively (Table 3 and Fig. 2, C and D). In addition to these hydrogen-bonding interactions, extensive van der Waals contacts are observed between residues 168 and 179 of the peptide and the Fab (Table 4). In particular, the 170ANPS173 motif contributes 79 of the 97 van der Waals contacts between the peptide and the Fab (Table 4). These interactions can partially explain the high affinity of Rituximab with human CD20.TABLE 3Hydrogen-bonding interactions between the Rituximab Fab CDRs and the epitope peptidePeptide atomFab atomCDR loopDistanceAåGluP168-OAsnL93-Nδ2L32.94ProP169-OSerH59-OγH22.75AsnP171-Oδ1SerH99-OγH32.79AsnP171-Nδ2TrpH106-NξH33.10ProP172-OAsnH55-Oδ1H22.66/2.97aHydrogen bond mediated by water molecule.

Favoino E. Caragnano M.A. Dammacco F. Blood. 2006; 107: 1070-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 19Polyak M.J. Deans J.P. Blood. 2002; 99: 3256-3262Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), is located at the bottom of the CDR pocket (Fig. 2B) formed by residues AlaH50, TyrH52, AspH57, and SerH59 of loop H2 of the Fab and residue AsnH33 of loop H1, and has both hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions with the surrounding residues of the Fab. The special position of ProP172 at the turn of the 310 helix and the rigid conformation of proline might play an important role in maintaining the unique conformation of the peptide and hence in the recognition and binding of Rituximab. Structural Basis for the Specificity of Rituximab—Human CD20 is an important drug target for the treatment of lymphomas. Rituximab is the first Food and Drug Administration approved mAb drug against CD20 for the treatment of B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and now has been used to treat autoimmune diseases and reduce the alloreaction in organic transplantations. Our crystal structure of the Rituximab Fab in complex with a 25-mer peptide mimicking the epitope on the large extracellular loop of human CD20 has provided a molecular basis for understanding the underlying mechanisms of the recognition and binding of CD20 with its antibodies and will be valuable in the modification of Rituximab for development of more effective mAb drugs against non-Hodgkin lymphoma and other diseases. Screenings of phage display peptide libraries that can express 7-mer cyclic and 7-/12-mer linear peptides have shown that the sequence motif A(S)NPS corresponding to 170ANPS173 of the large extracellular loop of human CD20 is the most important region for Rituximab recognition and binding (4Perosa F. Favoino E. Caragnano M.A. Dammacco F. Blood. 2006; 107: 1070-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 23Binder M. Otto F. Mertelsmann R. Veelken H. Trepel M. Blood. 2006; 108: 1975-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In particular, Ala170 and Pro172 are the most critical ones determined by means of phage display, mutagenesis, and peptide scanning (2Teeling J.L. Mackus W.J. Wiegman L.J. van den Brakel J.H. Beers S.A. French R.R. van Meerten T. Ebeling S. Vink T. Slootstra J.W. Parren P.W. Glennie M.J. van de Winkel J.G. J.

Blood. 2006; 107: 1070-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 19Polyak M.J. Deans J.P. Blood. 2002; 99: 3256-3262Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In our structure of the Rituximab Fab-CD20 epitope-peptide complex, four residues 170ANPS173 of the motif are deeply buried in the pocket formed by four CDR loops (L3, H1, H2, and H3). Ala170 is located in a hydrophobic cavity formed by TrpL47, TrpL90, AsnL93, and ProL95 of the Fab. The space of the cavity is too narrow to accommodate other residues with a large side chain except serine due to steric conflict (Fig. 2B), providing an explanation for the result that only serine is interchangeable with Ala170 (4Perosa F. Favoino E. Caragnano M.A. Dammacco F. Blood. 2006; 107: 1070-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Similarly, Pro172 is positioned at the tip of the 310 helix and is bound at the bottom of the CDR pocket (Fig. 2B). Modeling study indicates that a serine residue could fit at the same site. However, the relaxation of the rigid conformation of Pro172 might disrupt the conformational constraint of the 310 helix and hence reduce the specificity and binding affinity, which explains the result that when Pro172 was substituted by serine in the cyclic 7-mer peptide, the mutant peptide could not bind to Rituximab (4Perosa F. Favoino E. Caragnano M.A. Dammacco F. Blood. 2006; 107: 1070-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The importance and requirement of the two other residues, Asn171 and Ser173, of the motif are also supported by our crystal structure showing that each residue makes two of total eight hydrogen bonds as well as extensive van der Waals contacts with the Rituximab Fab. In the structure model, six residues (Glu168, Pro169, Asn171, Pro172, Ser173, and Lys175) of the epitope peptide make hydrogen-bonding interactions, and additionally Ala170, Glu174, Asn176, and Ser179 make van der Waals contacts with the Rituximab Fab. Although only 170ANPS173 of CD20 were documented to be involved in the Rituximab binding, the other residues might also play some roles in the recognition and binding of CD20 by Rituximab. Based on phage display results, it was suggested that fragment 182YCYSI186 at the C terminus of the large extracellular loop of CD20 is also involved in Rituximab binding (23Binder M. Otto F. Mertelsmann R. Veelken H. Trepel M. Blood. 2006; 108: 1975-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In our structure, this region forms part of the C-terminal α-helix and has no direct interaction with the Fab. However, residues CysP183 and CysP167 of the epitope peptide form a disulfide bond that makes the peptide adopt a unique cyclic conformation. In search for the epitope of CD20 with phage display peptide libraries, a series of cyclic and linear peptides were obtained; however, only the cyclic peptides match the sequence of human CD20 (4Perosa F. Favoino E. Caragnano M.A. Dammacco F. Blood. 2006; 107: 1070-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Biochemical data have shown that disruption of the disulfide bond on the large extracellular loop of CD20 completely ablates the binding of CD20 with Rituximab (33Ernst J.A. Li H. Kim H.S. Nakamura G.R. Yansura D.G. Vandlen R.L. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 15150-15158Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It is very likely that the involvement of the C-terminal 182YCYSI186 fragment of the large extracellular loop in the recognition and binding of Rituximab is through the formation of the disulfide bond and the constraint and stabilization of the cyclic conformation of the epitope rather than direct interaction with the antibody. Analysis of the crystal structure of the Rituximab Fab in complex with its epitope peptide also provides valuable information for modification of the antibody to improve the specificity and binding affinity. Changes of residues on the CDR loops of the Rituximab Fab that could generate more favorable interactions with residues of the epitope of CD20 might increase its binding affinity and specificity with CD20. For instance, substitution of SerH59 with a polar residue having a slightly longer side chain could introduce favorable hydrophilic interactions with the side chains of GluP168 and/or LysP175. Change of AspH57 to Glu could generate more hydrophilic interactions with the side chain of LysP175 and/or AsnP176. Mutation of AsnH55 to Gln might form potential hydrogen bonds with the side chain of AsnP176. Similarly, substitution of TyrH102 with a basic residue such as Lys might form a salt bridge with the side chain of GluP174 and/or hydrophilic interaction with the side chain of SerP179. Substitution of TrpH106 with a basic residue like Lys might form new hydrophilic interactions with the side chain of AsnP171 and GluP174. In summary, we report here the crystal structure of the Fab fragment of therapeutic antibody Rituximab in complex with its epitope peptide of human CD20. Structural analysis reveals the molecular basis of the specific recognition and binding of CD20 by Rituximab. Specifically, the most important epitope region 170ANPS173 on the large extracellular loop of CD20 is bound at a pocket formed by four CDR loops of the Rituximab Fab and recognized by residues of the CDR loops through a network of hydrogen-bonding interactions and extensive van der Waals contacts. The unique cyclic conformation of the epitope peptide, which is attributed to the formation of a disulfide bond between CysP167 and CysP183 and the presence of a rigid ProP172, forms the basis of the specificity of Rituximab. Our structural results also provide useful hints for the development of new therapeutic antibodies with higher binding affinity and better specificity for the treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

https://openalex.org/W2086434022,"Networks of interactions between thousands of molecules within cells seem to defy comprehension, but shared principles of design may simplify the picture. Uri Alon's book An Introduction to Systems Biology: Design Principles of Biological Circuits, has done much to introduce systems biology to a wider audience. It's one of a clutch of systems biology texts reviewed this week. And in Connections, Alon reflects on the idea that the apparent complexity of biological systems is just that, apparent. A closer look suggests that biological net works display a degree of simplicity that is intriguing given that cells evolved to survive, and not for scientists to understand."
https://openalex.org/W2134500795,"ADAMTS13 is a plasma metalloproteinase that cleaves von Willebrand factor to smaller, less thrombogenic forms. Deficiency of ADAMTS13 activity in plasma leads to thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. ADAMTS13 contains eight thrombospondin type 1 repeats (TSR), seven of which contain a consensus sequence for the direct addition of fucose to the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine. Mass spectral analysis of tryptic peptides derived from human ADAMTS13 indicate that at least six of the TSRs are modified with an O-fucose disaccharide. Analysis of [3H]fucose metabolically incorporated into ADAMTS13 demonstrated that the disaccharide has the structure glucose-β1,3-fucose. Mutation of the modified serine to alanine in TSR2, TSR5, TSR7, and TSR8 reduced the secretion of ADAMTS13. Mutation of more than one site dramatically reduced secretion regardless of the sites mutated. When the expression of protein O-fucosyltransferase 2 (POFUT2), the enzyme that transfers fucose to serines in TSRs, was reduced using siRNA, the secretion of ADAMTS13 decreased. A similar outcome was observed when ADAMTS13 was expressed in a cell line unable to synthesize the donor for fucose addition, GDP-fucose. Although overexpression of POFUT2 did not affect the secretion of wild-type ADAMTS13, it did increase the secretion of the ADAMTS13 TSR1,2 double mutant but not that of ADAMTS13 TSR1–8 mutant. Together these findings indicate that O-fucosylation is functionally significant for secretion of ADAMTS13."
https://openalex.org/W2083477112,"When brief stimuli contact the skin in rapid succession at two or more locations, perception strikingly shrinks the intervening distance, and expands the elapsed time, between consecutive events. The origins of these perceptual space-time distortions are unknown.Here I show that these illusory effects, which I term perceptual length contraction and time dilation, are emergent properties of a Bayesian observer model that incorporates prior expectation for speed. Rapidly moving stimuli violate expectation, provoking perceptual length contraction and time dilation. The Bayesian observer replicates the cutaneous rabbit illusion, the tau effect, the kappa effect, and other spatiotemporal illusions. Additionally, it shows realistic tactile temporal order judgment and spatial attention effects.The remarkable explanatory power of this simple model supports the hypothesis, first proposed by Helmholtz, that the brain biases perception in favor of expectation. Specifically, the results suggest that the brain automatically incorporates prior expectation for speed in order to overcome spatial and temporal imprecision inherent in the sensorineural signal."

https://openalex.org/W2089430646,"Patients with advanced cancer exhibit multifaceted defects in their immune capacity, which are likely to contribute to an increased susceptibility to infections and disease progression. We demonstrated earlier that curcumin inhibits tumor growth and prevents immune cell death in tumor-bearing hosts. Here we report that tumor-induced immunodepletion involves apoptosis of thymic CD4+/CD8+ single/double positive cells as well as loss of circulating CD4+/CD8+ T cells. Administration of curcumin to tumor-bearing animals resulted in restoration of progenitor, effecter, and circulating T cells. In fact, tumor burden decreased the expression level of the pro-proliferative protein Bcl-2 while increasing the pro-apoptotic protein Bax in T cells. Curcumin down-regulated the Bax level while augmenting Bcl-2 expression in these cells, thereby protecting the immunocytes from tumor-induced apoptosis. A search for the upstream mechanism revealed down-regulation of the common cytokine receptor γ chain (γc) expression in T cells by tumor-secreted prostaglandin E2. As a result, Jak-3 and Stat-5a phosphorylation and to a lesser extent Stat-5b phosphorylation were also decreased in T cells. These entire phenomena could be reverted back by curcumin, indicating that this phytochemical restored the cytokine-dependent Jak-3/Stat-5a signaling pathway in T cells of tumor bearers. Overexpressed Stat-5a/constitutively active Stat-5a1*6 but not Stat-5b could efficiently elevate Bcl-2 levels and protect T cells from tumor-induced death, whereas C-terminal truncated Stat-5a713 overexpression failed to do so, indicating the importance of Stat-5a signaling in T cell survival. Thus, these results raise the possibility of inclusion of curcumin in successful therapeutic regimens against cancer.

Thus, these results raise the possibility of inclusion of curcumin in successful therapeutic regimens against cancer. The multifaceted defect in the immune capacity of patients with advanced malignancy contributes not only to an increased susceptibility to infection and disease progression but also constitutes a barrier to therapeutic interventions. Both human patients and experimental animals with advanced cancer often exhibit a poorly functioning immune system (1.Kiessling R. Wasserman K. Horiguchi S. Kono K. Sjoberg J. Pisa P. Petersson M.

Removal of tumor burden by surgical resection was associated with normalization of the cytokine production capacity of cancer patients (7.Saito T. Dworacki G. Gooding W. Lotze M.T. Whiteside T.L. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 1351-1364PubMed Google Scholar). In order to establish itself, a growing tumor must evade the immune system of the host. This contributes to tumor-induced immune suppression. A growing tumor can evade the proposed immune surveillance by several mechanisms. There is evidence of increased apoptosis among CD8+ T cells in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) 2The abbreviations used are: PBL, peripheral blood lymphocyte; Cox-2, cyclooxygenase-2; EAC, Ehrlich’s ascites carcinoma; IL, interleukin; Jak, Janus kinase; PI, propidium iodide; PGE2, prostaglandin E2; RCC, renal cell carcinoma; Stat, signal transducer and activator of transcription; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; DTT, dithiothreitol; siRNA, short interfering RNA; TUNEL, TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling; PE, phycoerythrin; TdT, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase; PerCP, peridinin chlorophyll protein. from cancer patients and animal models (2.Mandal D.

By having evaded the innate immune system, the tumor can progress by turning its genetic instability into an advantage by evading the adaptive immune response in various ways. Increased oxidative stress because of the growing tumor can be another cause of immune disruptions. Recently, several observations indicate that a chronic inflammatory condition develops in patients with advanced cancer, causing oxidative stress that can shut off immune functions, including those of T and NK cells. In addition to that, macrophage-derived nitric oxide as well as soluble mediators from tumors reduce the phosphorylation or down-regulate the expression of Jak-3/Stat-5 (8.Bingisser R.M. Tilbrook P.A. Holt P.G. Kess U.R. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5729-5734PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Wang H. Xie X. Lu W.G. Ye D.F. Chen H.Z. Li X. Cheng Q. Life Sci. 2004; 74: 1739-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) thus inhibiting the proliferative responses of T cells to various cytokines, including IL-2 and IL-7 (9.Wang H. Xie X. Lu W.G. Ye D.F. Chen H.Z. Li X. Cheng Q. Life Sci. 2004; 74: 1739-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It is acknowledged that targets for Jak-mediated survival signals include the Bcl-2 family of apoptotic regulator proteins (10.Yang E. Korsmeyer S.J. Blood. 1996; 88: 386-401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies with Jak-3-deficient mice showed down-regulation of Bcl-2 in the CD8+ population in thymus (11.Wen R. Wang D. McKay C. Bunting D.K. Marini C.J. Vanin F.E. Zambetti P.G. Korsemeyer S.J. Ihle J.N. Cleveland J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 678-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Other report demonstrated correlation between loss in Bcl-2 expression and death of thymocytes (12.Morales-Montor J. Rodriguez-Dorantes M. Mendoza-Rodriguez C.A. Camacho-Arroyo I. Parasitol. Res. 1998; 84: 616-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). All these reports indicate the role of Bcl-2 in T cell survival. It is known that the pro-proliferative protein Bcl-2 also plays a significant role in T cell maturation (13.Veis D.J. Sentman C.L. Bach E.A. Korsmeyer S.J. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 2546-2554PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, Bcl-2 expression in the thymus is an indication of both positive selection and survival of CD4+ and CD8+ cells in the organ (14.Marden V.S. Strasser A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 71-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Depletion of the thymic CD4+8+ double positive population of tumor-bearing animals coupled with an increase in CD4–CD8– double negative immature thymocytes cause a declining CD4+ and CD8+ effecter population in secondary immune compartment as well as in circulation, weakens the cellular defense mechanism, and induces thymic atrophy (2.Mandal D. Bhattacharyya A. Lahiry L. Choudhuri T. Sa G. Das T. Life Sci. 2005; 77: 2703-2716Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 15.Shankar A. Singh S.M. Sodhi A. Tumour Biol. 2000; 21: 288-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Therefore, therapeutic intervention, which can protect the immune system in cancer patients, may enhance the immune competence and increase the survival. This study was conducted to delineate the mechanisms of tumor-induced immunodepletion and the role of curcumin (the major pigment of ground rhizome Curcuma longa and a known antioxidant with proven anti-tumor activity (16.Choudhuri T. Pal S. Das T. Sa G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20059-20068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar)) in prevention of immunosuppression caused by progressing tumor. It was observed that CD4+ and CD8+ effecter T cells as well as progenitor CD4+CD8+ T cell population was severely depleted in the thymus of tumor-bearing animals, resulting in eventual loss of CD4+and CD8+ effecter T cells in peripheral circulation. The critical role of the Jak/Stat family of signaling proteins as regulators of the Bcl-2 family proteins in cancer-induced immunosuppression was evaluated. Reports of immunomodulatory power of curcumin in the tumor-bearing host were only scantily available, and this is the first time we are reporting the intricate mechanism of curcumin-induced immuno-restoration in tumor-bearing animals. Our study suggests the role of curcumin as a possible therapeutic agent with a strong immunomodulatory effect, which can be used alone or in combination with tumoricidal drugs to treat patients with cancer. Treatment of Animals−Swiss albino mice (National Clinical and Laboratory Animal Sciences, Hyderabad, India) weighing 25–27 g were maintained in temperature-controlled room with a light-dark cycle. All animal experiments were performed following the “Principles of Laboratory Animal Care” (National Institutes of Health Publication 85-23, revised in 1985) and Indian laws on “Protection of Animals” under the prevision of authorized investigators. Mice were divided into four groups of 10 animals each, including a normal set (non-tumor-bearing), a tumor-bearing set (which were intraperitoneally injected with 1 × 105 exponentially grown ascites carcinoma), a curcumin-treated set (non-tumor-bearing), and a curcumin-treated tumor-bearing set. Curcumin (treatment started 7 days after tumor inoculation) was fed orally (50 mg/kg body weight every other day) (17.Pal S. Choudhuri T. Chattopadhyay S. Bhattacharya A. Datta G.K. Das T. Sa G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 658-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Cell Culture−At day 21 of tumor inoculation, thymus was removed and a single cell suspension was made in RPMI 1640 medium. Macrophages were allowed to adhere at 37 °C for 1 h. Peripheral blood collected from mice and from healthy human volunteers with informed consent (IRB 1382) were centrifuged over Ficoll-Paque density gradient (Amersham Biosciences) to obtain total leukocytes. T cells were purified from total leukocytes and thymocytes by negative magnetic selection using microbeads coated with antibodies to CD14 (macrophages), CD16 (NK cells), CD19 (B cells), CD56 (NK cells), and glycophorin A (erythrocytes) (human T cell enrichment mixture; Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada). Viable cell numbers were determined by trypan blue exclusion test. The T cell isolated procedure yielded >97% positive for CD3 cells as defined by immunocytometry. Isolated cells were maintained in complete RPMI 1640 medium (supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 μg/ml sodium pyruvate, 100 μm nonessential amino acids, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 units/ml penicillin; Sigma) at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. Tissues from primary lesions of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) were provided by the Cooperative Human Tissue Network. Informed consent was obtained from all patients with localized disease. Tissues were digested and primary RCC cells were allowed to adhere overnight. The adherent cells were maintained in complete RPMI 1640 medium and allowed to reach confluence before use. Ascites fluids were collected from the peritoneal cavity of tumor-bearing mice. Tumor supernatants freed from cellular components were used in a 1:1 ratio with RPMI 1640 medium to study the effect of tumor supernatants on T cells in the absence or presence of 10 μm curcumin, 50 μm celecoxib, and/or recombinant IL-2, 1000 IU/ml (reviewed in Ref. 21.Kolenko V. Rayman P. Roy B. Cathcart M.K. O'Shea J. Tubbs R. Rybicki L. Bukowski R. Finke J. Blood. 1999; 93: 2308-2318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After 48 h of incubation or as described in the figure legends, cells were harvested for further experiments. In separate sets of experiments T cells were incubated for 48 h with 3.5 ng/ml prostaglandin E2 (PGE2; Sigma) and/or 1000 IU/ml recombinant IL-2. Plasmid Constructs, siRNA, and Transfections−FLAG-tagged (N terminus) cDNA encoding full-length Stat-5a and Stat-5b, C-terminal truncated Stat-5a (Stat-5a713) and Stat-5b (Stat-5b718) (provided by Dr. J. N. Ihle of St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, Memphis, TN), constitutively active mutant Stat-5a1*6 (generous gift from Prof. T. Kitamura, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo), Bcl-2, and Bax (kind gift from Dr. C. S. Tannenbaum of The Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH) in Prk5 vector (2 μg each/million cells) were introduced separately into isolated T cells using the T cell nucleofector kit (Amaxa, Koein, Germany). Isolation of stably expressing clones was done by limiting dilution and selection with IL-2 (25 units/ml) and hygromycin B (800 mg/ml) for 14 days, and cells surviving this treatment were cloned and assessed for Bcl-2, Bax, and Stat-5 expression by Western blot analysis. Tumor cells were transfected with 300 pmol of Cox-2/control double-stranded siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and Lipofectamine 2000 separately for 12 h. mRNA and protein levels of Cox-2 were estimated by reverse transcription-PCR and Western blotting. Transfected cells were cultured for 72 h, and cell-free supernatants were collected for subsequent experiments. Flow Cytometry−For the determination of cell death, T cells were stained with propidium iodide (PI) and annexin-V-FITC and analyzed on a flow cytometer (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences), equipped with a 488 nm argon laser light source using CellQuest software. Electronic compensation of the instrument was done to exclude overlapping of the emission spectra. A total of 10,000 events were acquired, and cells were properly gated for analysis (18.Choudhuri T. Pal S. Agwarwal M.L. Das T. Sa G. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The fragmented DNA of apoptotic cells was labeled by catalytically incorporating FITC-dUTP at the 3′-hydroxyl ends of the fragmented DNA by enzyme terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT) using the apo-direct kit (Pharmingen) following the principles of TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL). The cells were then analyzed on a flow cytometer. For assaying CD4+/CD8+ cells, T cells from thymus and PBL were stained with FITC-conjugated CD4 and peridinin chlorophyll protein (PerCP)-conjugated CD8 (Pharmingen) and analyzed in FACS. For the assessment of apoptotic populations in thymic and peripheral blood, T cells were stained with either FITC-/PerCP-conjugated CD4/CD8 antibodies and then with phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated annexin-V. The percentage of CD4–8–, CD4+8+, CD4+8–, and CD4–8+ cells positive for annexin-V was determined using FACSCalibur. Co-immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting−Cells were lysed in buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, and 0.5 mm DTT), and nuclei were pelleted by brief centrifugation. The supernatant was spun at 105,000 × g to get a cytosolic fraction. The nuclear extract was prepared in buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 420 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. For whole cell lysates, cells were homogenized in buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na-EDTA, 1 mm Na-EGTA, and 1 mm DTT). All the buffers were supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures (16.Choudhuri T. Pal S. Das T. Sa G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20059-20068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 18.Choudhuri T. Pal S. Agwarwal M.L. Das T. Sa G. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). For direct Western blot analysis, the cell lysates or the particular fractions containing 50 μg of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The protein of interest was visualized by chemiluminescence. For the determination of direct interaction between two proteins, co-immunoprecipitation technique was employed. The immunopurified proteins were then detected by Western blot using specific antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Equal protein loading was confirmed by reprobing the blots with α-actin/histone H1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (16.Choudhuri T. Pal S. Das T. Sa G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20059-20068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Prostaglandin E2 Assay−PGE2 contents in culture supernatants were determined using PGE2 ELISA bioassay kit (US Biological). For the determination of serum and PGE2 content of ascites fluid, samples were treated with 0.2 ml of methanol, 1 ml of sample and then applied to C-18 Sep-Pac column (Waters). PGE2 was eluted with methyl formate. PGE2 content in eluent was determined according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Statistical Analysis−Values are shown as means ± S.E., except if indicated otherwise. Data were analyzed and, when appropriate, significance of the differences between mean values was determined by a Student’s t test. Results were considered significant at p < 0.05. Curcumin Prevents Tumor-induced CD4+/CD8+ T Lymphocyte Depletion−It is known that T cells play a pivotal role in cell-mediated tumor immunity, and tumors induce T cell apoptosis as a mechanism to evade the host defense system. Thymus is the major organ where the T cell maturation process takes place and mature effecter T cells subsequently enter the bloodstream. Closer scrutiny of the thymus using flow cytometry revealed massive loss of CD4+CD8+ double positive as well as CD4+ or CD8+ single positive effecter populations in tumor-bearing animals, with an apparent increase in the CD4–CD8– double negative population (Fig. 1A, upper panels). Loss of the CD4+8+ double positive population can cause a decrease in the number of mature effecter cells emerging from the thymus. Similarly, it was also observed that tumor burden severely decreased effecter CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations in peripheral blood (Fig. 1A, lower panels), indicating that tumor-induced T cell depletion encompasses both the primary and effecter immune compartments of the host, as decreased thymic output results in disruption of the circulating T cell repertoire. Interestingly, curcumin administration brought back thymic CD4+8+, CD4+, and CD8+ cells as well as circulatory effecter CD4+ and CD8+ cells to control level (Fig. 1A). Curcumin Protects T Lymphocytes from Tumor-induced Apoptosis−The observations of massive depletion of both thymic and circulatory T cell populations prompted us to investigate the underlying cause. Using a flow cytometric technique, we observed increased annexin-V/PI positivity in CD3+ T cells, which indicates that apoptotic cell death is one of the major causes behind tumor-induced depletion of both thymic and circulatory T cells. Curcumin administration prevents such tumor-induced T cell death. To determine specific subpopulations of T cells most affected by tumor assault, we used three-color flow cytometry (FITC-CD4, PerCP-CD8, and PE-annexin-V). Our results indicated that 5.28% double negative cells, 23.14% double positive cells, 6.21% CD4+, and 8.16% CD8+ cells were apoptotic in the thymus of tumor-bearing animals, whereas the thymus of normal animals showed only 1.66% double negative cells, 4.39% double positive cells, 1.22% CD4+, and 1.81% CD8+ apoptotic cells (Fig. 1B, left panel). Administration of curcumin reduced the overall percentage of apoptotic cells in thymus (16.64%) from that of its untreated counterpart (42.79%) with marked reduction in both double and single positive populations (Fig. 1B, left panel). Similar results were obtained when peripheral T cells were co-cultured with tumor supernatants. When mouse or human T cells were incubated with cell-free EAC or RCC supernatants, both CD4+ and CD8+ cells became susceptible to tumor-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, CD8+ T cells were more vulnerable than CD4+ cells. When both the T cells were preincubated with curcumin, the cells became resistant to killing (Fig. 1B, middle panel). Similar trends were observed with both mouse and human T cells thereby indicating that curcumin could protect both the CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from tumor-induced apoptosis. In in vivo studies, 13.47% CD4+ and 22.85% CD8+ cells of tumor-bearing mice were apoptotic, and curcumin administration could protect these cells from tumor insult (Fig. 1B, right panel) indicating that the in vitro results are reflected in an in vivo system. Similarly, when we compared the percentage of circulatory T cell killing in renal cell carcinoma-bearing patients to that of age- and sex-matched normal individuals, we observed an increase in the percent apoptosis in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Fig. 1B, right panel). We could not perform a clinical trial with curcumin in RCC patients, but from aforementioned in vitro and in vivo results, it may be envisaged that curcumin might also protect T cells from a tumor-induced demise in humans. Our results also indicated that tumor-induced depletion of thymic T cells and the eventual loss of peripheral mature T cell pull are both because of increased apoptosis of double positive progenitor T cells and maturation block as suggested by the increased accumulation of double negative immature thymocytes. Curcumin could protect double positive thymocytes from tumor-induced apoptosis thus ensuring the continuous export of mature T cells in the peripheral circulation. Tumor Induces T Cell Apoptosis by Altering Bcl-2/Bax Ratio, Releasing Cytochrome c, and Activating Caspase-3; Protection by Curcumin−To delineate the underlying mechanism, which enables curcumin to prevent tumor-induced T cell apoptosis, we examined the expression level of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and pro-apoptotic Bax proteins in T cells. We observed that tumor insult down-regulated Bcl-2 and up-regulated Bax thus lowering the Bcl-2:Bax ratio (Fig. 2, A and B) creating a pro-apoptotic environment in T cells. We further investigated the release of cytochrome c in T cell cytosol as a measure of mitochondrial transmembrane potential loss and initiation of caspase cascades. As shown in Fig. 3A, tumor burden significantly increased cytochrome c levels in cytosol, whereas in normal T cells cytochrome c was minimally detected in the cytosolic fraction. Downstream, the tumor insult activated critical executioner caspase-3, as was evident from the substantial decrease in pro-caspase-3 and increase in caspase-3 bands in these cells (Fig. 2A). Curcumin treatment restored the Bcl-2:Bax ratio toward the survival environment, normalized cytochrome c release, and inhibited caspase-3 activation thereby protecting thymic T cells from tumor-induced death (Fig. 2, A and B).FIGURE 3Curcumin prevents tumor-induced down-regulation of Jak-3/Stat-5 activation via restoration of γ chain in T cells. T cells from untreated or curcumin-treated normal and tumor-bearing mice were lysed. Jak-1/Jak-3 (A) and Stat-3/Stat-5/Stat-6 (B) were immunoprecipitated (IP) using specific antibodies and then Western-blotted with anti-phosphotyrosine or anti-Jak-1/Jak-3/Stat-3/Stat-5/Stat-6 antibodies to determine the phosphorylation status of specific proteins. C, Jak-3-Stat-5 complexes were immunopurified with anti-Jak-3 antibody from T cell lysates. The immunopurified proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis to identify the Jak-3-associated phospho-Stat-5. D, nuclear fractions from T cells were Western-blotted using anti-phospho-Stat-5 antibodies to determine nuclear translocation as well as activation of Stat-5. Histone H1 was used as internal control. E, Stat-5a and Stat-5b isoforms were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using specific antibodies and then Western-blotted with anti-phosphotyrosine or anti-Stat-5a/Stat-5b antibodies to determine the phosphorylation status of specific proteins. F, T cells lysates were Western-blotted with anti-γ chain antibody to determine the expression level of specific protein. α-Actin was used as internal control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Results obtained so far indicated that tumor-induced immune cell death involves disruption of Bcl-2:Bax ratio and initiation of caspase cascades. Because the decrease in Bcl-2 expression was found to be one of the major causes of T cell death, we overexpressed these anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2) as well as pro-apoptotic (Bax) proteins in T cells in order to alter the Bcl-2:Bax ratios in these cells. Western blot analysis performed on FLAG-tagged Bcl-2/Bax-transfected clones revealed two protein bands recognized by anti-Bcl-2/Bax antibodies as follows: a native molecule also present in lysates from wild-type cells and an additional, approximately higher molecular mass protein specific to transfected cells (Fig. 2C). To assess the possibility that Bcl-2 overexpression would confer T cell protection from tumor-shed supernatant-induced apoptosis, control vector and Bcl-2 transfected cells were analyzed for DNA break by TUNEL. Multiple experiments demonstrated that control T cells were highly sensitive to tumor-shed supernatant, with an average of 36% of lymphocytes testing positive for apoptosis. Unlike wild-type cells, however, Bcl-2-transfected cells were only minimally affected, with an average of only 7% of the transfected cells succumbing to a tumor shed-induced apoptotic death (Fig. 2C). The fact that Bcl-2 overexpression provided T cells with significant protection against tumor-mediated apoptosis led us to ask the question whether overexpression of Bax would make T cells more susceptible to tumor-induced death. In fact, when these cells were expressed with the Bax gene, more killing was observed (Fig. 2C), and curcumin could not rescue them from tumor-induced apoptosis (data not shown). All these data indicate that normalization of the Bcl-2:Bax ratio (which plays an important role in both the selection procedure and survival of T cells) may be the mechanism by which curcumin prevents tumor-induced T cell loss. Curcumin Prevents Tumor-induced Down-regulation of Jak-3/Stat-5 Activation via Restoration of γ Chain in T Cells−We have already shown that tumor-induced down-regulation of Bcl-2 expression with a moderate increase in Bax level leading to T cell death and depletion of thymic T cells eventually resulted in a diminished peripheral blood T cell repertoire. These results prompted us to investigate the phosphorylation status of Jak and Stat proteins in T cells that are known to be involved in the regulation of both the pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein expression. It is known that Jak phosphorylation by cytokines or other stimuli leads to Stat activation via phosphorylation and subsequent translocation to the nucleus (19.Zhang Q. Nowak I. Vonderheid E.C.

We observed that out of two Jak proteins (Jak-1 and Jak-3) and three associated Stat proteins (Stat-3, Stat-5, and Stat-6) responsible for Bcl-2 induction, only Jak-3 (Fig. 3A) and Stat-5 (Fig. 3B) phosphorylations were down-regulated in T cells of tumor-bearing mice. To test whether reduced Jak-3 phosphorylation was associated with decreased Stat-5 phosphorylation, we co-immunoprecipitated Stat-5 with anti-Jak-3 antibody, and the immunopurified proteins were"

The mechanisms involved in the biogenesis and trafficking of GPCRs from the ER to the cell surface are poorly understood, but they may involve interactions with other proteins. We have now identified the ER chaperone protein calnexin as an interacting protein for both D1 and D2 dopamine receptors. These protein-protein interactions were confirmed using Western blot analysis and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. To determine the influence of calnexin on receptor expression, we conducted assays in HEK293T cells using a variety of calnexin-modifying conditions. Inhibition of glycosylation either through receptor mutations or treatments with glycosylation inhibitors partially blocks the interactions with calnexin with a resulting decrease in cell surface receptor expression. Confocal fluorescence microscopy reveals the accumulation of D1-green fluorescent protein and D2-yellow fluorescent protein receptors within internal stores following treatment with calnexin inhibitors. Overexpression of calnexin also results in a marked decrease in both D1 and D2 receptor expression. This is likely because of an increase in ER retention because confocal microscopy revealed intracellular clustering of dopamine receptors that were co-localized with an ER marker protein. Additionally, we show that calnexin interacts with the receptors via two distinct mechanisms, glycan-dependent and glycan-independent, which may underlie the multiple effects (ER retention and surface trafficking) of calnexin on receptor expression. Our data suggest that optimal receptor-calnexin interactions critically regulate D1 and D2 receptor trafficking and expression at the cell surface, a mechanism likely to be of importance for many GPCRs.

It is estimated that nearly 5% of the human genome consists of GPCRs, and that more than 70% of the current drugs on the market are targeted to these essential receptor proteins (1Lundstrom K. IDrugs. 2005; 8: 909-913PubMed Google Scholar). Clearly, GPCRs have an established importance in a vast variety of physiological and pathological conditions; but despite the observed significance of GPCR regulation in a variety of diseases, little is known about the specific mechanisms associated with their regulation in terms of cell surface expression. Overall expression of these receptors on the cellular surface likely involves a dynamic balance between surface trafficking, internalization, and degradation. Although significant progress has been made in understanding the internalization mechanisms of GPCRs once they are expressed on the cell surface (2Marchese A. Chen C. Kim Y.M. Benovic J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 369-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), surprisingly little information is available concerning the mechanisms of GPCR biogenesis and trafficking to the plasma membrane. Recent studies have suggested that GPCRs are synthesized, assembled, and folded in a conformation-dependent sorting paradigm within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (3Van Craenenbroeck K. Clark S.D. Cox M.J. Oak J.N. Liu F. Van Tol H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19350-19357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This allows for their continued trafficking to the cell surface as functional protein receptors (4Duvernay M.T. Filipeanu C.M. Wu G. Cell. Signal. 2005; 17: 1457-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Surface trafficking of newly formed receptors, working in harmony with the more extensively studied endocytotic pathway, determines receptor expression levels and thereby influences the magnitude of the cellular response (for review see Ref. 5Tan C.M. Brady A.E. Nickols H.H. Wang Q. Limbird L.E. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2004; 44: 559-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). However, the ER processing steps for GPCRs are poorly understood, as is the subsequent regulation of receptor trafficking to the cell surface. It is beginning to emerge that a complex system of regulation exists at the level of the ER that represents critical steps in the trafficking and expression of GPCRs. Dopamine, a critically important neurotransmitter in the central nervous system and periphery, exerts its biological effects through activating a distinct family of GPCRs. These include five separate receptor proteins (D1–D5), with D1 and D2 representing the most abundant subtypes (6Sibley D.R. Monsma Jr., F.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1992; 13: 61-69Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar, 7Missale C. Nash S.R. Robinson S.W. Jaber M. Caron M.G. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 189-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (2737) Google Scholar). It has now become clear that dopamine receptors, as well as most GPCRs, exist as components of preformed signaling complexes that can consist of G proteins, enzymes, scaffolding proteins, and other receptors (8Bockaert J. Fagni L. Dumuis A. Marin P. Pharmacol. Ther. 2004; 103: 203-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 9Bergson C. Levenson R. Goldman-Rakic P.S. Lidow M.S. Trends Pharmacol.

Indeed, a number of dopamine receptor-interacting proteins have now been identified, some of which may affect receptor trafficking and expression or may be altered in neuropsychiatric disorders (11Bai J. He F. Novikova S.I. Undie A.S. Dracheva S. Haroutunian V. Lidow M.S. Biol. Psychiatry. 2004; 56: 427-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 12Laurin N. Misener V.L.

As part of our efforts to identify novel dopamine receptor-interacting proteins, we have employed receptor immunoprecipitation (IP) assays along with mass spectrometry. By using this approach, we found that both D1 and D2 dopamine receptors interact with the ER chaperone protein calnexin, a transmembrane protein that resides in the ER where it acts as a chaperone for nascent and newly synthesized glycoproteins. Calnexin is involved in protein folding and quality control, which includes retaining misfolded and incomplete proteins in the ER (13Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 14Swanton E. High S. Woodman P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2948-2958Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 15Molinari M. Eriksson K.K. Calanca V. Galli C. Cresswell P. Michalak M. Helenius A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 125-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). If proper folding is achieved, the glycoprotein will be allowed to leave the ER when the association with the lectin is terminated. If not in the proper conformation, the glycoprotein will be retained to ensure folding efficiency and prevent misfolded glycoproteins from exiting the ER (16Labriola C. Cazzulo J.J. Parodi A.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 771-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We report here that the extent of calnexin-receptor interactions is critical to ensure proper trafficking of D1 and D2 receptors to the cell surface. Our results suggest that calnexin may represent a critically important ER chaperone protein that is involved in regulating the expression of many GPCRs. Materials—HEK293-tsa201 (HEK293T) cells (17Heinzel S.S. Krysan P.J. Calos M.P. DuBridge R.B. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 3738-3746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were a gift from Dr. Vanitha Ramakrishnan.

CAD cells were transfected using NeuroPORTER reagent (Gene Therapy Systems, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Several expression constructs were used in this study. An amino-terminal FLAG epitope-tagged construct for the rat D1 receptor (18Monsma Jr., F.J. Mahan L.C. McVittie L.D. Gerfen C.R. Sibley D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6723-6727Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) was created and named pSFD1, as reported previously by our laboratory (19Gardner B. Liu Z.F. Jiang D. Sibley D.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 310-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar); pCMV-Tag2B, an expression construct expressing only the FLAG peptide (FLAG tag), was obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA).

This is used to allow for fluorescent visualization of the endoplasmic reticulum and was purchased from BD Biosciences. Immunoprecipitation and Gel Electrophoresis—Cells were removed from culture flasks and collected by centrifugation (300 × g). They were then resuspended in 1 ml of solubilization buffer (50 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 40 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and Complete-Mini (Roche Applied Science) protease inhibitor mixture) and incubated on ice for 1 h. The lysates were then centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min to remove insoluble cell debris and then precleared via incubation with protein G-agarose for 3 h. The agarose was removed by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 5 min) and discarded. Anti-FLAG M2-agarose (Sigma) was added and incubated with the lysate overnight at 4 °C. The beads were collected via centrifugation and washed three times by resuspension and recentrifugation in solubilization buffer. The agarose was then subjected to a final wash in 1× TE buffer, pH 7.4. Proteins were eluted from the beads using NuPAGE-lithium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer (Invitrogen). Agarose was removed via centrifugation, and proteins were separated on 4–12% BisTris NuPAGE gel (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Western Blotting and Gel Staining—Proteins separated by PAGE were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were blocked in Superblock (Pierce) prior to incubation with the primary antibody. Primary antibodies used in this study include the following: rat monoclonal anti-D1 dopamine receptor (clone 1-1-F11 S.E6, catalog number D-187, Sigma), rabbit polyclonal anti-calnexin (catalog number SPA-860, StressGen, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada), and rabbit polyclonal anti-D2L/S (catalog number AB5084P, Chemicon, Temecula, CA). After washing, membranes were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) (anti-rat for the D1 and anti-rabbit for D2 and calnexin). Proteins were visualized via the SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and images were recorded on film. In some experiments, blots were stripped of all antibodies using Restore Western blot stripping buffer (Pierce) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Removal of all primary antibodies by the buffer was initially checked via incubation with HRP-secondary antibodies followed by ECL and film exposure. In other experiments where total protein was examined, gels were stained using either Coomassie Blue or the SilverQuest staining kit (Invitrogen). Mass Spectrometry—The identification of PAGE-resolved proteins by mass spectroscopy was carried out by ProtTech, Inc. (Norristown, PA). In brief, proteins in each gel band were digested “in-gel” with modified sequencing grade trypsin (Promega), and the resulting peptide mixture was subjected to tandem mass spectrometry for peptide sequencing. A Finnigan ion trap mass spectrometer LCQ coupled with an HPLC system running a 75 μm ID C18 column was used. Data were acquired in a data-dependent mode. MS/MS spectra were used to search the most recent nonredundant protein data bases, including the Protein Information Resources data base and GenBank™ using ProtQuest software suite from ProtTech. The output of the data base search was manually analyzed and validated to verify proper protein identification. Radioligand Binding Assays—HEK293T (5 × 106 cells) cells were plated in 150-mm tissue culture dishes and transfected as described above. Forty eight hours later, the cells were removed mechanically using calcium-free Earle’s balanced salt solution (EBSS). Intact cells were collected by centrifugation and then lysed with 5 mm Tris-HCl and 5 mm MgCl2 at pH 7.4. Homogenates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min. The membranes were then resuspended with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Membrane preparations were incubated for 90 min at room temperature with various concentrations of [3H]SCH23390 (D1 binding) or [3H]methylspiperone (D2 binding) in a reaction volume of 1 ml. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 4 μm (+)-butaclamol. Bound ligand was separated from unbound ligand by filtration through polyethyleneimine-soaked GF/C filters using a Brandel cell harvester. GF/C filter disks were then analyzed via liquid scintillation spectroscopy at a counting efficiency of 60%. Protein concentration was determined using a Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). cAMP Accumulation Assays—Transfected HEK293T cells were seeded into 24-well poly-d-lysine-coated plates (150,000 cells/well for D1; 200,000 cells/well for D2) and cultured for 1 day prior to the experiment. For D1 receptor accumulation assays, cells were washed three times with 200 μl of EBSS per well. Various concentrations of dopamine dissolved in stimulation buffer (DMEM, 20 μm Ro-20-1724, 0.2 mm sodium metabisulfite) were added to each well in a volume of 250 μl for 10 min at 37 °C. For D2 receptor assays, the cells were washed three times with 200 μl of EBSS per well. Various concentrations of dopamine containing 3 μm forskolin and 10 μm propranalol in stimulation buffer were added to each well in a volume of 250 μl for 10 min at 37 °C. The reactions were terminated by adding 200 μl of 3% perchloric acid and incubated on ice for 30 min. 80 μl of 15% KHCO3 was then added to neutralize the acid. The plates remained on ice for an additional 20 min and were then centrifuged at 1,300 × g for 25 min. 50 μl of the supernatant from each well was transferred to a 1.2-ml reaction tube containing 50 μl of cAMP-binding protein, 50 μl of [3H]cAMP, and 150 μl of Tris-EDTA buffer. The reaction was incubated for 90 min at 4 °C. After the incubation, 250 μl of 1% charcoal/dextran mixture was added to each tube and vortexed gently. Tubes were then incubated at 4 °C for 10 min followed by centrifugation (1,300 × g) for 20 min. Radioactivity in the supernatant was then quantified by liquid scintillation spectroscopy at a counting efficiency of 60%. cAMP concentrations were then determined using a standard assay curve according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Confocal Microscopy—1 × 106 HEK293T cells were seeded in 100-mm culture dishes and transfected the next day with either D1-GFP or D2-YFP. For some experiments, cells were also transfected with calnexin. For double-labeling experiments that visualized the ER, the cells were co-transfected with pDsRed2-ER. Cells were cultured for an additional 24 h prior to reseeding at 100,000 cells per poly-d-lysine-coated 35-mm glass bottom culture dishes. Confocal microscopy was performed on a Zeiss laser-scanning confocal microscope (LSM 5 Pascal). Images were collected using a single line excitation (488 nm for D1-GFP and D2-YFP and 563 nm for pDsRed2-ER). Identification of Calnexin as an Interacting Protein for Both D1 and D2 Dopamine Receptors—As part of our efforts to identify novel dopamine receptor-interacting proteins, we employed immunoprecipitation (IP) assays using tagged receptor constructs along with mass spectrometry to identify associated proteins. For these studies, either FLAG-tagged dopamine receptor expression constructs or a vector expressing only the FLAG peptide (FLAG tag) was transfected into HEK293T cells. The cells were then solubilized, and the receptors and associated proteins were immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG-agarose. The precipitated protein mixtures were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fig. 1A shows an experiment using the D1 dopamine receptor expressed in HEK293T cells. Coomassie Blue staining of the gel reveals the presence of multiple protein species in the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1A, left lane). A few of these proteins were also found in the negative control cells expressing only the FLAG tag peptide (Fig. 1A, right lane). The proteins precipitated only in the presence of the D1 receptor were tentatively assumed to interact specifically with the receptor. To identify these proteins, specific bands were excised from the gels and digested with trypsin. The eluted peptides were then subjected to LS-MS/MS tandem mass spectrometry as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A number of proteins were identified using this approach and are listed in Table 1. The proteins identified in both the D1 receptor and FLAG peptide immunoprecipitates were presumed to be nonspecific in nature. Importantly, we did not observe any proteins that were unique to the FLAG tag peptide samples. Among the putative D1 receptor-interacting proteins was the ER chaperone protein calnexin. We hypothesized from these initial studies that calnexin was involved in dopamine receptor expression, and we therefore chose it for further study.TABLE 1Proteins identified by mass spectroscopy that co-immunoprecipitated with the D1 receptor as shown in Fig. 1 NCBI accession numbers are indicated.Importin 7TNF receptor-associated protein3-Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenaseTIMM50NP_006382AAH18950AAB88664AAH09072Importin 9CalnexinVimentinGlyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-1-dehydrogenaseNP_060555NP_001737A25074CAA25833Exportin 1HSPA8D1 dopamine receptor (rat)RibonucleoproteinNP_003391AAH07276NP_036678NP_112533Scaffold attachment factor AHSP70aData denote nonspecific proteins that were found in both the D1-FLAG IP and the FLAG-only IPβ5-tubulinaData denote nonspecific proteins that were found in both the D1-FLAG IP and the FLAG-only IPNucleophosminNP_114032NP_005337AAH20946AAQ24860Cellular apoptosis susceptibilitySKB1 HsaData denote nonspecific proteins that were found in both the D1-FLAG IP and the FLAG-only IPα-TubulinaData denote nonspecific proteins that were found in both the D1-FLAG IP and the FLAG-only IP60 S ribosomal proteinaData denote nonspecific proteins that were found in both the D1-FLAG IP and the FLAG-only IPAAC35008AAB66581CAA25855AAD08846RibophorinPoly(A)-binding proteinRibonuclear protein H1Solute carrier family 25AAH07995AAD08718NP_005511NP_001143Methionine tRNA ligaseTransformation up-regulated nuclear proteinSSA1Phosphate carrier precursor isoform 1bJC5224CAA51267AAK76432NP_002626Na + /K + ATPase α1 subunitChaperoninElongation factoraData denote nonspecific proteins that were found in both the D1-FLAG IP and the FLAG-only IPRibosomal protein S3NP_000692NP_002147CAA34756NP_000996NucleolinaData denote nonspecific proteins that were found in both the D1-FLAG IP and the FLAG-only IPSerine/threonine kinase 38α6-TubulinaData denote nonspecific proteins that were found in both the D1-FLAG IP and the FLAG-only IPSignal sequence receptor, α; TRAPNP_005372NP_009202NP_116093NP_003135HSP90TCP1Nuclear ribonucleoprotein FDDX1NP_031381AAH00665NP_004957Q92841MitofilinIgG heavy chainaData denote nonspecific proteins that were found in both the D1-FLAG IP and the FLAG-only IPDnaJ protein homologQ16891BAA37168BAA02656a Data denote nonspecific proteins that were found in both the D1-FLAG IP and the FLAG-only IP Open table in a new tab Fig. 1B shows a representative MS/MS spectrum of a calnexin peptide found in the D1 dopamine receptor sample (Fig. 1A, band 1). This protein was absent in the corresponding gel band (cut in parallel) from the FLAG tag sample lane (Fig. 1A). Three separate peptides corresponding to calnexin sequences were identified (Fig. 1B and Table 2). Mass spectrometry was also performed on Fig. 1A, band 2, and three peptides for the D1 receptor were identified (Table 2). None of these peptides were apparent in the FLAG tag control. Using the D2 receptor, we performed similar experiments (data not shown) as described in Fig. 1, which also identified calnexin in the D2 receptor immunoprecipitates. Table 2 shows that two of the calnexin tryptic fragments identified in the D1 and D2 receptor experiments are identical. These results suggest that calnexin interacts with both D1 and D2 receptors in HEK293T cells.TABLE 2Peptides and corresponding parent proteins found in co-IP mass spectrometry experimentsTransfectionaIndicated receptor cDNA was transfected into HEK293T cellsBand numberTrypsin-digested PeptidesbPeptides identified from SDS-polyacrylamide gel bands that were excised, trypsinized, and subjected to mass spectrometry as described under “Experimental Procedures”Parent proteincParent proteins identified via data base search of trypsin-digested peptides are as described under “Experimental Procedures”D1-FLAG1AEEDEILNRCalnexinTPELNLDQFHDKdIdentical peptides for parent protein calnexin are found in both D1 and D2 receptor IPsAPVPTGEVYFADSFDRdIdentical peptides for parent protein calnexin are found in both D1 and D2 receptor IPs2EEAGGIAKPLEKD1 DAReDAR indicates dopamine receptorLSPALSVILDYDTDVSLEKIQPVTHSGQHSTYWAISSPFQYERD2-FLAGTPELNLDQFHDKdIdentical peptides for parent protein calnexin are found in both D1 and D2 receptor IPsCalnexinAPVPTGEVYFADSFDRdIdentical peptides for parent protein calnexin are found in both D1 and D2 receptor IPsKIPNPDFFEDLEPFRYTAVAMPMLYNTRD2 DARQNWSRPFNGSEGKa Indicated receptor cDNA was transfected into HEK293T cellsb Peptides identified from SDS-polyacrylamide gel bands that were excised, trypsinized, and subjected to mass spectrometry as described under “Experimental Procedures”c Parent proteins identified via data base search of trypsin-digested peptides are as described under “Experimental Procedures”d Identical peptides for parent protein calnexin are found in both D1 and D2 receptor IPse DAR indicates dopamine receptor Open table in a new tab Verification of D1 and D2 Receptor Interactions with Calnexin—To verify the interaction of the receptors with calnexin, we performed co-immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses. Fig. 2A (left panel) shows that the D1 receptor (apparent as a broad diffuse band ∼50 kDa in size) is immunoprecipitated only from cells in which it is expressed. Stripping this blot and reprobing it with an antibody to calnexin (Fig. 2A, right panel) reveals that calnexin (apparent as an ∼70-kDa band) only immunoprecipitates in the presence of the D1 receptor, and no band was seen in the control FLAG tag lane. To further verify that the D1 receptor and calnexin directly interact, reverse IP experiments were performed using an anti-calnexin antibody. In this case, endogenous calnexin was immunoprecipitated from cells expressing either the D1 receptor or FLAG tag and probed for the presence of the D1 receptor. Fig. 2B (left panel) shows that the D1 receptor (apparent as multiple bands of ∼50 kDa) was co-immunoprecipitated with calnexin, but only in cells in which the D1 receptor is expressed. Fig. 2B (right panel) shows the blot stripped of antibodies and re-probed with the anti-calnexin antibody. Dense bands of ∼70 kDa are seen in both the D1 receptor-transfected lane and the FLAG tag lane, indicating that calnexin was immunoprecipitated from both cell preparations and was loaded equally on the gel. These data further support a direct protein-protein interaction between the D1 receptor and calnexin. To ensure that the aforementioned interaction is not unique to HEK293T cells, we performed similar IP experiments using CAD cells, a central nervous system-derived catecholaminergic cell line that can be morphologically differentiated into neuronal phenotypes by the removal of serum (22Qi Y.

https://openalex.org/W2003724178,"SUMO-1 (small ubiquitin-related modifier-1) is a ubiquitin-like family member that is conjugated to its substrates through three discrete enzymatic steps, activation (involving the E1 enzyme (SAE1/SAE2)), conjugation (involving the E2 enzyme), and substrate modification (through the cooperation of the E2 and E3 protein ligases). The adenoviral protein Gam1 inactivates E1, both in vitro and in vivo, followed by SAE1/SAE2 degradation. We have shown here that Gam1 possesses a C-terminal SOCS domain that allows its interaction with two cellular cullin RING (really interesting new gene) ubiquitin ligases. We demonstrate that Gam1 is necessary for the recruitment of SAE1/SAE2 into Cul2/5-EloB/C-Roc1 ubiquitin ligase complexes and for subsequent SAE1 ubiquitylation and degradation. The degradation of SAE2 is not tightly related to Gam1 but is a consequent effect of SAE1 disappearance. These results reveal the mechanism by which a viral protein inactivates and subsequently degrades an essential cellular enzyme, arresting a key regulatory pathway.

Post-translational modifications of proteins are resourceful tools that cells use to control the function of proteins by regulating their activity, subcellular localization, and stability, as well as their interaction with other proteins. They are also important for promptly adjusting protein functions in response to changes in the state of a cell or its environment. The dynamic post-translational process that covalently transfers ubiquitin to itself or to other proteins is called ubiquitylation. Ubiquitin transfer requires distinct chemical steps catalyzed by the sequential activities of different enzymes (1Pickart C.M. Eddins M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). The ubiquitin E3 ligases perform the rate-limiting selectivity step of direct substrate recognition and are the most numerous and diverse in the ubiquitylation pathway. They can be subdivided into different general protein families, based on their structural features and their characteristic motifs. These include the cullin RING ligases (CRLs). 3The abbreviations used are: CRL, cullin RING ligase; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; EloB, elongin B; EloC, elongin C; WT, wild type; IP, immunoprecipitation; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; GST, glutathione S-transferase; SOCS, suppressors of cytokine signalling. Through the assembly of their modular enzymatic core with different substrate recognition components, CRLs can promote the specific ubiquitylation of a wide array of targets (2Petroski M.D. Deshaies R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1692) Google Scholar). Belonging to CRLs, the Cul2- and Cul5-based complexes share a common heterodimeric adaptor subunit, elongin B/elongin C (EloB/C) (3Garrett K.P. Tan S. Bradsher J.N. Lane W.S. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5237-5241Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), which allows specific recruitment of the substrate-receptors that contain a SOCS motif (4Kile B.T. Schulman B.A. Alexander W.S. Nicola N.A. Martin H.M. Hilton D.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 235-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The physiological importance of the CRL pathways is emphasized, considering that many receptors and adaptors of these ligases are exploited by viral and bacterial pathogens to subvert normal cellular processes (5Barry M. Fruh K. Science's STKE. 2006; 2006: pe21Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). For example, the human immunodeficiency virus-encoded protein Vif interacts with EloB/C, Cul5, and Roc1 to form an E3 that eliminates the host anti-viral factor APOBEC3G (6Yu X. Yu Y. Liu B. Luo K. Kong W. Mao P. Yu X.F. Science. 2003; 302: 1056-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar, 7Yu Y. Xiao Z. Ehrlich E.S. Yu X. Yu X.F. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2867-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Another example is the complex formed from the adenoviral proteins E4orf6 and E1B55K and the host Cul5 complex that catalyzes the elimination of the tumor suppressor p53 to allow efficient viral replication (8Blanchette P. Cheng C.Y. Yan Q. Ketner G. Ornelles D.A. Dobner T. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Branton P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9619-9629Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 9Querido E. Blanchette P.

Gam1 is an essential viral protein encoded by the avian adenovirus CELO (chicken embryo lethal orphan) (10Glotzer J.B. Saltik M. Chiocca S. Michou A.I. Moseley P. Cotten M. Nature. 2000; 407: 207-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) able to interfere with cellular sumoylation, a post-translational ubiquitin-like pathway (11Boggio R. Colombo R. Hay R.T. Draetta G.F. Chiocca S. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 549-561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Sumoylation, the covalent addition of SUMO proteins to its substrates, in a similar manner to ubiquitylation, exploits different enzymatic reactions involving the E1-activating enzyme, the SAE1/SAE2 heterodimer, the E2-conjugating enzyme, and E3 SUMO ligases (12Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar). In this report, we have shown that Gam1, recruiting Cul2/5-EloB/C-Roc1 through its C terminus-degenerate SOCS motif, targets the SUMO E1 heterodimer to these CRLs and promotes specifically SAE1 ubiquitylation. Subsequent proteasomal degradation of SAE2 depends on SAE1 disappearance, demonstrating that the two SUMO E1 subunits are mutually stabilized in vivo. Plasmid Constructs—pSG9m Gam1 WT (Gam1 WT-Myc), pSG9m Gam1 L258/265A (Gam1 LL/AA-Myc), glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Gam1 WT, and GST-Gam1 L258/265A were previously described (13Chiocca S. Baker A.

Transfection, Western Blot Analysis, and Immunoprecipitation—HeLa or Phoenix cells were transfected with the calcium-phosphate method using the indicated plasmids. After 24 or 48 h, cellular extracts were obtained, lysing cells in E1A buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 1 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mg/ml aprotinin). In the experiments depicted in Fig. 4, E and F, the cellular extracts were obtained using a SDS buffer (11Boggio R. Colombo R. Hay R.T. Draetta G.F. Chiocca S. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 549-561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations (IPs) were done using protein extracts incubated with the indicated antibodies in E1A buffer. The following antibodies were used in these assays: anti-Myc epitope 9E10, anti-hemagglutinin epitope (12CA5), anti-hemagglutinin probe (Y-11), anti-vinculin, anti-EloB (FL-118), anti-EloC (R-20), and anti-Cul5 (H-300) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, anti-SV5 epitope (SV5-Pk1 clone, Serotec), anti-SAE1 and anti-SAE2 (kindly provided by Dr. Ron Hay), anti-Roc1 (BIOSOURCE), anti-Cul1, anti-Cul2, and anti-Cul3 from Zymed Laboratories Inc., anti-Cul4A (Biodesign), and anti-histone deacetylase 2 (Abcam). Small Interfering RNA and Short Hairpin RNA (shRNA)—The small interfering RNA experiment (see Fig. 4F) was performed using the following SMARTpool reagents (Dharmacon) according to the experimental procedures manual: human Cul2 RNA interference (M-007277), human Cul5 RNA interference (M-019553), Control (CTRL) (D-001206-13). The transfections were performed using the Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). The DNA for the shRNA experiment (see Fig. 4E) encoded a 21-nucleotide hairpin-specific sequence, with a loop sequence (-ttcaagaga-) separating two complementary domains. The specific 21-nucleotide sequences were cloned in pSUPER vectors shSAE1 (GTTCTTTACAGGAGATGTT), shSAE2 (AGTGGAACAGCTGGGTATC), and shControl (CGTACGCGGAATACTTCGA). In Vitro Binding—Proteins were in vitro translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system kit (Promega) and [35S]methionine-labeled (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The in vitro translations were incubated in E1A buffer with 5 μg of GST or GST-fused proteins for 1 h at room temperature on rotation. After three washes in E1A buffer, the samples were loaded in SDS-polyacrylamide gels, stained with Coomassie staining, dried, and exposed for autoradiography (see Figs. 3B and 4A) or loaded on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies (see Fig. 3, C and B). In Vitro Ubiquitylation Assay—Phoenix cells were transfected using the indicated plasmids. 48 h after transfection, the cells were lysed in E1A buffer and immunoprecipitated using an anti-Myc antibody. An aliquot of each IP was checked by Western blot analysis to verify the equal amount of immunoprecipitated proteins. The immunoprecipitated samples were incubated thereafter with the indicated combinations of 200 mm ubiquitin-E1, 500 mm UbcH5a, ubiquitin (Biomol) and SAE1, or [35S]methionine-labeled SAE2 in vitro translation. The reactions were incubated 2 h at 30 °CinATP buffer at 10× (500 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm MgCl2, 20 mm ATP). The samples loaded on SDS-polyacrylamide gels were then stained with Coomassie staining, dried, and exposed for autoradiography. Gel Filtration—24 h after transfection, 4 mg of each of the total cellular lysates were loaded into a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences). The running conditions were designed as described in the manufacturer's procedures manual. The column was equilibrated with E1A buffer without Nonidet P-40. 40 fractions were collected. 1/5 V/V of the indicated fractions were loaded on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and immunoblotted. Gam1 Recruits Cullin-based Ligase Complexes (CRLs)—We have demonstrated that the reduction of SAE1 and SAE2 proteins induced by Gam1 expression is not due to transcription regulation and is prevented by the addition of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (11Boggio R. Colombo R. Hay R.T. Draetta G.F. Chiocca S. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 549-561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the disappearance of SUMO E1 subunits was due to a substantial decrease in their half-lives induced by the viral protein, thus implicating the ubiquitin degradation pathway in Gam1 function (11Boggio R. Colombo R. Hay R.T. Draetta G.F. Chiocca S. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 549-561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). We therefore started a bioinformatics analysis to identify any conserved domain in the Gam1 amino acid sequence that might be traced back to known ubiquitin E3 complexes. Using SMART (simple modular architecture research tool) software, we found a putative SOCS motif (4Kile B.T. Schulman B.A. Alexander W.S. Nicola N.A. Martin H.M. Hilton D.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 235-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) in the C terminus of the Gam1 amino acid sequence. This domain, with its N-terminal shorter motif, called a BC-box (16Duan D.R. Pause A. Burgess W.H. Aso T. Chen D.Y. Garrett K.P. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Linehan W.M. Klausner R.D. Science. 1995; 269: 1402-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 17Kibel A. Iliopoulos O. DeCaprio J.A. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Science. 1995; 269: 1444-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar), is necessary for the interaction with the specific linker proteins elongin B (EloB) and elongin C (EloC) (3Garrett K.P. Tan S. Bradsher J.N. Lane W.S. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5237-5241Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Examining the multiple alignment between the amino acid sequence of Gam1 and the established SOCS motifs of known proteins, we observed that Gam1 has a conserved pattern of amino acids mainly in the BC-box (Fig. 1). To determine whether Gam1 could interact with the elongins, we performed an in vitro binding assay using a bacteria-purified GST fusion version of the Gam1 protein incubated with [35S]methionine-labeled in vitro translated EloB and/or EloC (Fig. 2A). We demonstrated that Gam1 was able to interact directly with EloC but not with EloB, that is recruited to Gam1 only in the presence of EloC (Fig. 2A). To establish whether Gam1 could physically interact in vivo with the endogenous CRLs, and in particular with the elongins, cells were transfected with a Myc-tagged Gam1 expression vector followed by immunoprecipitation. In agreement with the architecture of these complexes, Western blot analysis showed that, in vivo, Gam1 was able to immunoprecipitate strongly EloB, EloC, and the RING protein Roc1, generating nonphysiological aggregates (Fig. 2B). As expected, Gam1 does not interact with Cul1, Cul3, or Cul4A but is able to bind both Cul2 and Cul5 (Fig. 2B). This result is quite peculiar, because the cellular and viral proteins that interact with EloB and EloC, usually form a complex in an exclusive manner with either Cul2 or Cul5. This specificity of cullin seems to be due to the C-terminal P/L-rich region of the SOCS motif (18Kamura T. Maenaka K. Kotoshiba S. Matsumoto M. Kohda D. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Nakayama K.I. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 3055-3065Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), which is absent from the Gam1 amino acid sequence. To investigate whether Gam1 recruits Cul2 and Cul5 in a common protein complex, cells were transfected with combinations of Gam1 and differentially tagged Cul2 and Cul5 expression vectors. As shown in Fig. 2C, the immunoprecipitated Cul2 or Cul5 does not aggregate with the other overexpressed cullin, even if bound with Gam1. These data confirm the individual interactions between Gam1 and Cul2 or Cul5 and show that the two cullins generate distinct and new complexes with the viral protein. Subsequently, to validate the in vivo interaction between Gam1 and the Cul2/Cul5-based CRLs, we followed the distribution of Gam1 protein using a gel filtration technique and observed complexes with a representative range of molecular weights. As shown in Fig. 2D, normally EloB and EloC co-elute in the same fractions and are mainly present in aggregates between 44 and 158 kDa (Fig. 2D, upper panel). Significantly, the expression of Gam1 both induces a clear increase in the molecular weight of the elongin complexes and co-elutes with them. The presence of Cul2, Cul5, and Roc1 in the same elution fractions suggests that Gam1 recruiting EloB/C into new complexes (Fig. 2D, lower panel) could reconvert the functionality of these endogenous CRLs. Gam1 Binds Elongins through Its SOCS-Box Motif—To prove the functionality of the Gam1 SOCS-box and its implication in EloC recruitment, few amino acid residues involved in this putative domain were mutated. The resulting Gam1 mutants were expressed and tested for elongin and cullin binding by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3A). The alignment between Gam1 and the consensus SOCS motif (Fig. 1) reveals that replacement of the highly conserved cysteine with alanine (Ala-256) in Gam1 generates a domain most similar to SOCS domains of other viral proteins (7Yu Y. Xiao Z. Ehrlich E.S. Yu X. Yu X.F. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2867-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 19Mehle A. Goncalves J. Santa-Marta M. McPike M. Gabuzda D. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2861-2866Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 20Rose K.M. Marin M. Kozak S.L. Kabat D. Trends Mol. Med. 2004; 10: 291-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the mutation of this residue does not cause any effect on its binding property (Fig. 3A). Instead, the Gam1 point mutants L252A, W255A, L258A, and L265A exhibited a drastically lower binding with EloB and EloC, consolidating the basic role of the hydrophobic surfaces of the SOCS motif in the functional recruitment of E3 adaptor subunits (Fig. 3A). To exclude the possibility that these mutants have any other structural deficiencies, we tested binding with a different and uncorrelated Gam1 interactor, histone deacetylase 2 (14Chiocca S. Kurtev V. Colombo R. Boggio R. Sciurpi M.T. Brosch G. Seiser C. Draetta G.F. Cotten M. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 594-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). All Gam1 mutants bind histone deacetylase 2 in vivo in the same manner (Fig. 3A), demonstrating that these point mutations impair only the hydrophobic pocket necessary for EloC interaction. The Gam1 L252A, W255A, L258A, and L265A mutants show a virtually abolished binding with elongins but a residual interaction with Cul2 and Cul5, whereas the Gam1 double mutant L258A/L265A (14Chiocca S. Kurtev V. Colombo R. Boggio R. Sciurpi M.T. Brosch G. Seiser C. Draetta G.F. Cotten M. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 594-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) was totally unable to immunoprecipitate all of the subunits of the E3 complexes (Fig. 3A). Supposing that Gam1 could interact also directly with Cul2 and Cul5, we evaluated the binding properties of the Gam1 mutant L258A/L265A (Gam1 LL/AA) in vitro. As shown in Fig. 3B, incubating the in vitro translated EloB and EloC with bacteria-purified GST-Gam1 WT or GST-Gam1 LL/AA, we demonstrated that the Gam1 mutant does not bind the EloB/C heterodimer. Subsequently, we investigated the interaction between bacteria-purified GST-Gam1 WT and its mutant incubated with either in vitro translated Cul2 (Fig. 3C) or Cul5 (Fig. 3D). We demonstrated that Gam1 binds either Cul2 or Cul5, and these direct interactions were not affected by the presence of a functional Gam1 SOCS motif in vitro. Gam1 Recruits SUMO E1 in the CRL Complexes—We have shown that the Gam1 LL/AA can no longer bind Cul2/5-EloB/C proteins and cannot induce SUMO E1 disappearance in vivo (11Boggio R. Colombo R. Hay R.T. Draetta G.F. Chiocca S. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 549-561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). We therefore reasoned that, by recruiting the CRL complexes through its SOCS-box, Gam1 could work as a substrate receptor, allowing SAE1 and SAE2 ubiquitylation and their subsequent proteasomal degradation. Because Gam1 binds directly SAE1 and SAE2 (Fig. 4A) (11Boggio R. Colombo R. Hay R.T. Draetta G.F. Chiocca S. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 549-561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), we decided to establish whether they could be included into the Gam1-EloB/ C-Cul2/5 protein aggregates following their distribution in a gel filtration assay. As shown in Fig. 4B, upper panel, normally EloC does not co-elute with the heterodimer SAE1/SAE2. Instead the presence of Gam1 causes the co-elution of SUMO E1 components and EloC in the same fractions (Fig. 4B, lower panel, dotted box). These in vivo results suggest that Gam1 may recruit SAE1/SAE2 to the Cul2/5-EloB/C complexes, thus promoting their ubiquitylation. To verify whether the SUMO E1 subunits are actually present in the same protein aggregates together with Gam1, EloB/C, and Cul2/Cul5, we immunoprecipitated the overexpressed tagged version of SAE1 and SAE2 with or without Gam1 WT or Gam1 LL/AA (Fig. 4, C and D). We demonstrated that SAE1 and SAE2 do not bind EloB/C and Cul2/5 normally but are recruited in the CRL complexes only through binding to the Gam1 WT protein (Fig. 4, C and D). As expected, Gam1 LL/AA, defective for SUMO E1 protein degradation, cannot operate as a substrate receptor and fails to join SAE1/SAE2 into Cu2/5-based complexes (Fig. 4D). Gam1 Permits SAE1 in Vitro Ubiquitylation—To tightly correlate the degradation of SUMO E1 and the assembly of the functional ubiquitin E3s induced by Gam1, we followed the enzymatic activity of these nonphysiological protein aggregates. We transfected cells with empty vector, Gam1 WT, or Gam1 LL/AA Myc-tagged expression vectors and subsequently immunoprecipitated the Myc-tagged proteins. Equal amounts of the immunoprecipitated materials were used as a source of E3 activities in the in vitro ubiquitylation reactions of [35S]methionine-labeled in vitro translated SAE1 or SAE2 (Fig. 4E). Surprisingly, we showed that immunoprecipitated Gam1 could in vitro conjugate ubiquitin only on the SAE1 protein (Fig. 4E). SAE1 and SAE2 Are Mutually Stabilized in Vivo—To explain the paradox in which the degradation of SAE1 and SAE2 in vivo mediated by Gam1 contrasts with its inability to post-translationally modify SAE2 in vitro, we investigated whether SUMO E1 subunits are mutually stabilized in vivo. To deplete the protein level of SUMO E1 subunits, we set an RNA interference approach (shRNAs) able to reduce successfully SAE1 or SAE2. As shown in Fig. 4F, the disappearance of any SUMO E1 subunit caused a strong reduction of the other protein constituent of the enzyme. Therefore, in the presence of Gam1, the disappearance of SAE2 seems to be directly related to the reduction in SAE1 protein level and is not tightly dependent on the effect of Gam1 on endogenous CRLs. Furthermore, we could conclude that the stability of the SUMO E1 heterodimer is tightly related to the presence of its two subunits, SAE1 and SAE2. Gam1 Exploits Both Cul2 and Cul5 to Degrade SAE1—The original ability of Gam1 to interact with both Cul2 and Cul5 and the absence of any identifiable cullin selection motif in its amino acid sequence prompted us to elucidate the contribution of each cullin in SAE1 degradation. To understand whether they are both necessary for the function of Gam1, we employed an RNA interference approach to delete specifically Cul2 and/or Cul5. As shown in Fig. 4G, the expression of Gam1 in cells in which Cul2 and Cul5 are simultaneously depleted does not induce SAE1 degradation. The single cullin depletion does not restore the disappearance of SAE1 caused by Gam1, suggesting that Cul2 and Cul5 are redundant for Gam1 function (Fig. 4G). A plethora of data has now implicated SUMO in fundamental biological activities, making SUMO as important in regulating cell activity as ubiquitin. We have described a novel mechanism of action adopted by the CELO adenoviral protein Gam1 that induces a total reduction of cellularly, sumoylated proteins by blocking the formation of an E1-SUMO thioester complex (11Boggio R. Colombo R. Hay R.T. Draetta G.F. Chiocca S. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 549-561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). We now reveal the mechanism underlying Gam1 function by showing that it exploits the endogenous ubiquitin pathway to convert the specificity of cullin2/5-based E3 complexes, triggering a nonphysiological ubiquitylation and degradation of SAE1. Gam1 Is the Substrate Receptor of Ubiquitin-E3 Complexes—Having previously demonstrated that the function of Gam1 on sumoylation is related to the proteasome activity (11Boggio R. Colombo R. Hay R.T. Draetta G.F. Chiocca S. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 549-561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), we then investigated the potential role of the ubiquitin system in the Gam1 phenotype. In a similar manner to sumoylation, protein ubiquitylation catalyzes the formation of polyubiquitin chains onto substrate proteins via isopeptide bonds through a cascade of enzymes involving activating (E1), conjugating (E2), and ligating (E3) activities (1Pickart C.M. Eddins M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). Polyubiquitylated substrates are then rapidly delivered to and degraded by the 26 S proteasome. The substrate specificity of ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis is tightly mediated by hundreds of E3 ubiquitin ligases. Many viral and bacterial pathogens have evolved different proteins that convert the specificity of host multisubunit ubiquitin ligase complexes (E3), inducing a nonphysiological degradation of specific cellular targets (5Barry M. Fruh K. Science's STKE. 2006; 2006: pe21Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 21Willems A.R. Schwab M. Tyers M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 133-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). These considerations led us to identify a putative SOCS domain in the C-terminal region of the Gam1 protein (Fig. 1), implicating an involvement in Cul2/5-based E3 ligase complexes. Although the amino acid sequences are not fully conserved among the SOCS proteins, they maintain the same helix structure, steric surface, and pack similar to the hydrophobic pocket of EloC. Interestingly, the Gam1 amino acids included between 251–265 are predicted to form an α-helix, and the Leu-252, Trp-255, Leu-258, and Leu-265 residues could be located on the same face of this generated helix. This probable hydrophobic cluster could support a successful interaction with the hydrophobic pocket of EloC. In agreement with these structural considerations, we demonstrated that Gam1 interacts directly with EloC (Fig. 2, A and B), and this binding is stabilized by the hydrophobic residues Leu-252, Trp-255, Leu-258, and Leu-265 of Gam1 (Fig. 3A). In fact, the double substitutions L258A and L265A (LL/AA) impair totally the Gam1 binding capability both in vitro and in vivo (Fig. 3, A and B). Generally, within the SOCS motif, the presence of a C-terminal proline/leucine-rich region (P/L-rich) (18Kamura T. Maenaka K. Kotoshiba S. Matsumoto M. Kohda D. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Nakayama K.I. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 3055-3065Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), allows us to distinguish Cul2 or Cul5-associated proteins (Fig. 1). Even if Gam1 could not be clustered into any of these groups, we demonstrated that this viral protein binds independently both Cul2 and Cul5 (Fig. 2, B and C). We could assume that other less well conserved residues in the Gam1 amino acid sequence are important for the cullin selection or that Gam1, through its SOCS-box, binds specifically elongins but nonspecifically either Cul2 or Cul5. Moreover, despite the direct binding between Gam1 and Cul2 or Cul5 (Fig. 3, C and D), we could assume that, in vivo, the correct recruitment of the EloB/C heterodimer is necessary to stabilize the entire Gam1 complex and that its dual interaction with Cul2 and Cul5 could theoretically provide a larger and stronger platform of substrates for Gam1 to ubiquitylate. We showed that the presence of Gam1 induces, as expected, a strong increase in the molecular weight of elongin complexes (Fig. 2D), supporting the hypothesis that Gam1 is able to reconvert the functionality of these endogenous protein aggregates. Gam1 Targets SAE1 into Cul2/5-EloBC-Roc1 Complexes—We have shown that the Gam1 LL/AA mutant can no longer bind Cul2/5-EloB/C proteins (Fig. 3, A and B). Interestingly, this double point mutant was initially identified as the inactive version of Gam1 protein (13Chiocca S. Baker A. Cotten M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3168-3177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and fails to interfere with sumoylation and some SUMO-related phenotypes (namely transcription and PML nuclear body assembly) (11Boggio R. Colombo R. Hay R.T. Draetta G.F. Chiocca S. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 549-561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 22Colombo R. Boggio R. Seiser C. Draetta G.F. Chiocca S. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 1062-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Consequently, we speculated that Gam1, by recruiting the cullin E3 ligase complexes through its SOCS motif, allowed SAE1 and SAE2 ubiquitylation and their proteasomal degradation. Following this hypothesis, we demonstrated that SAE1 and SAE2 were stably associated, through the direct link of Gam1 WT, into the Cul2/5-EloB/C-Roc1 complexes (Fig. 3, B and C). In agreement with the initial assumption, Gam1 LL/AA fails to connect the SUMO E1 subunits to the endogenous CRL complexes (Fig. 3B). Therefore, we could assume that the inability of Gam1 LL/AA to degrade SUMO E1 in vivo is a direct effect of its failure to join, in a stable manner, the CRLs and SAE1/ SAE2. Consequently, we followed the ubiquitin-conjugating activity of the Gam1-based CRLs in vitro and showed that Gam1 could ubiquitin-modify only the SAE1 protein, suggesting that the in vivo phenotype could be due to overlapping but distinct events (Fig. 4E). Using a RNA interference approach, we demonstrated that the stability of the SUMO E1 heterodimer is tightly related to the presence of its two subunits, SAE1 and SAE2, and that the effect of Gam1 on SAE2 seems to be a consequence of the induced ubiquitylation and degradation of SAE1 (Fig. 4F). We have shown that the viral protein Gam1, through a novel dual binding with Cul2- and Cul5-based aggregates (Fig. 2) could theoretically provide two nonphysiologically larger ubiquitin platforms with overlapping functions. In fact, Cul2 and Cul5 seem to have a redundant role during the degradation of SAE1 induced by Gam1 (Fig. 4G). The atypical role of Gam1 could also be a viral evolutionarily conserved mechanism to assure specific substrate modification and degradation of essential cellular proteins. The flexibility of action of Gam1 supports its pivotal role in viral replication and reveals its potential for the study of cellular pathways.

Our aim was to estimate the effects on manuscript quality of either adding a statistical peer reviewer or suggesting the use of checklists such as CONSORT or STARD to clinical reviewers or both.Interventions were defined as 1) the addition of a statistical reviewer to the clinical peer review process, and 2) suggesting reporting guidelines to reviewers; with ""no statistical expert"" and ""no checklist"" as controls. The two interventions were crossed in a 2x2 balanced factorial design including original research articles consecutively selected, between May 2004 and March 2005, by the Medicina Clinica (Barc) editorial committee. We randomized manuscripts to minimize differences in terms of baseline quality and type of study (intervention, longitudinal, cross-sectional, others). Sample-size calculations indicated that 100 papers provide an 80% power to test a 55% standardized difference. We specified the main outcome as the increment in quality of papers as measured on the Goodman Scale. Two blinded evaluators rated the quality of manuscripts at initial submission and final post peer review version. Of the 327 manuscripts submitted to the journal, 131 were accepted for further review, and 129 were randomized. Of those, 14 that were lost to follow-up showed no differences in initial quality to the followed-up papers. Hence, 115 were included in the main analysis, with 16 rejected for publication after peer review. 21 (18.3%) of the 115 included papers were interventions, 46 (40.0%) were longitudinal designs, 28 (24.3%) cross-sectional and 20 (17.4%) others. The 16 (13.9%) rejected papers had a significantly lower initial score on the overall Goodman scale than accepted papers (difference 15.0, 95% CI: 4.6-24.4). The effect of suggesting a guideline to the reviewers had no effect on change in overall quality as measured by the Goodman scale (0.9, 95% CI: -0.3-+2.1). The estimated effect of adding a statistical reviewer was 5.5 (95% CI: 4.3-6.7), showing a significant improvement in quality.This prospective randomized study shows the positive effect of adding a statistical reviewer to the field-expert peers in improving manuscript quality. We did not find a statistically significant positive effect by suggesting reviewers use reporting guidelines."
https://openalex.org/W2045434303,"Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a proinflammatory cytokine up-regulated by rhinovirus infection during acute exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The role of IL-6 during exacerbations is unclear; however, it is believed IL-6 could contribute to airway and systemic inflammation. In this study we investigate the effects of common asthma treatments fluticasone propionate and beta(2) agonists salmeterol and salbutamol on IL-6 production in BEAS-2B and primary bronchial epithelial cells. Salmeterol and salbutamol enhanced rhinovirus- and IL-1beta-induced IL-6 production; however, fluticasone treatment caused a reduction of IL-6 protein and mRNA. Combined activity of salmeterol and fluticasone at equimolar concentrations had no effect on rhinovirus or IL-1beta induction of IL-6. The induction of IL-6 by salmeterol was dependent upon the beta(2) receptor and could also be induced by cAMP or cAMP-elevating agents forskolin and rolipram. Using transfection of IL-6 promoter reporter constructs, dominant negative mutants, and electromobility shift assays, it was found that NF-kappaB was the only transcription factor required for rhinovirus induction of IL-6 gene expression. Salmeterol caused an augmentation of rhinovirus-induced promoter activation via a mechanism dependent upon the c/EBP and/or CRE (cyclic AMP response element) cis-acting sites. The suppressive effect of FP was dependent upon distinct glucocorticoid response element sequences proximal to the transcriptional start site within the IL-6 promoter. The data demonstrate that beta(2) agonists can augment IL-6 expression by other stimuli in an additive manner via cyclic AMP and that the negative effect of steroids is mediated by glucocorticoid response elements within the IL-6 promoter."
https://openalex.org/W2044134902,"Very long-chain (C24 to C34) polyunsaturated fatty acids (VLCPUFA) are important constituents of sphingomyelin (SM) and ceramide (Cer) in testicular germ cells. In the present paper we focused on the SM and Cer and their fatty acids in spermatozoa and their main regions, heads and tails. In bull and ram spermatozoa, SM was the third most abundant phospholipid and VLCPUFA were the major acyl groups (∼70%) of SM and Cer. In rat epididymal spermatozoa the SM/Cer ratio was low in the absence of and could be maintained high in the presence of the cation chelator EDTA, added to the medium used for sperm isolation. This fact points to the occurrence of an active divalent cation-dependent sphingomyelinase. Bull and rat sperm had an uneven head-tail distribution of phospholipid, with virtually all the VLCPUFA-rich SM located at the head, the lower SM content in the rat being determined by the lower sperm head/tail size ratio. Most of the SM from bull sperm heads was readily solubilized with 1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C. The detergent-soluble SM fraction was richer in VLCPUFA than the nonsoluble fraction and richer in saturated fatty acids. Cer was produced at the expense of SM, thus decreasing severalfold the SM/Cer ratio in rat spermatozoa incubated for 2 h in presence of the sperm-capacitating agents, calcium, bicarbonate, and albumin. The generation of Cer from SM in the sperm head surface may be an early step among the biochemical and biophysical changes known to take place in the spermatozoon in the physiological events preceding fertilization.

In a number of mammals including humans a series of very long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (VLCPUFA), 2The abbreviations used are: VLCPUFA, very long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids; Cer, ceramide; SM, sphingomyelin; SMase, sphingomyelinase; PL, phospholipid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; KR, Krebs-Ringer; GC-MS, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; CGP, choline glycerophospholipid; EGP, ethanolamineglycerophospholipids; DPG, diphosphatidylglycerol; ros, rod outer segment(s); PC, phosphatidylcholine. 2The abbreviations used are: VLCPUFA, very long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids; Cer, ceramide; SM, sphingomyelin; SMase, sphingomyelinase; PL, phospholipid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; KR, Krebs-Ringer; GC-MS, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; CGP, choline glycerophospholipid; EGP, ethanolamineglycerophospholipids; DPG, diphosphatidylglycerol; ros, rod outer segment(s); PC, phosphatidylcholine. i.e. n-6 and n-3 tetraenoic, pentaenoic and hexaenoic fatty acids with up to 32 or 34 carbon atoms, depending on the species, was characterized in the sphingomyelin (SM) from testis and spermatozoa (1Poulos A. Johnson D.E. Beckman K. White I.G. Easton C. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 961-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 2Robinson B.S. Johnson D.W. Poulos A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 268: 1746-1751Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). In the testis of various mammals, we focused on the fatty acids of the ceramide (Cer), a lipid molecule with which SM bears a close precursor-product relationship, showing that SM and Cer species containing VLCPUFA are a specific feature of cells of the spermatogenic lineage (3Furland N.E. Zanetti S.R. Oresti M.G. Maldonado E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18141-18150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Because these testicular cells are predecessors of spermatozoa, the question arose as to the quantitative importance of these molecules in spermatozoa, where they could play a role in sperm functions related to fertilization.Transit through the epididymis is a crucial phase in sperm maturation. Spermatozoa exiting the testis are immotile, unable to bind to eggs and to undergo the acrosomal reaction in vitro in response to commonly used stimuli. By the time they reach the region of cauda epididymis, sperm cells have acquired their progressive motility and their ability to bind, penetrate, and fertilize eggs (4Williams R.M. Graham J.K. Hammerstedt R.H. Biol. Reprod. 1991; 44: 1080-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). One of the questions we addressed was whether epididymal maturation gives rise to spermatozoa with a larger or a smaller proportion of SM and Cer containing these VLCPUFA as opposed to other fatty acids.Spermatozoa are functionally regionalized cells. Sperm-oocyte interactions are head-related functions, energy production for motion is a main role of mitochondria located in the midpiece, and motility is a function associated with the contractile proteins located to the tail. We next addressed the distribution of VLCPUFA-containing species of SM and Cer in sperm tails and heads and employed a nonionic detergent, Triton X-100, to gain information on the behavior of the lipids present in the plasma membrane of sperm heads, focusing on SM and its fatty acids.As a prerequisite to fertilization, mammalian spermatozoa must undergo the time-dependent priming process known as capacitation, as a result of which sperm change their motility patterns and migrate to the site of fertilization, in the process becoming competent to undergo the acrosomal reaction. This reaction entails a specific fusion event in the spermatozoal head whereby the plasma membrane of the apical region and the outer membrane of the underlying acrosome fuse at many points, creating vesiculations and fenestrations that enable exocytosis of the acrosomal constituents. The release of hydrolytic enzymes is one of the factors facilitating penetration of the egg coat, thus allowing the post-acrosomal membrane of a spermatozoon to merge with the oolemma. The molecular mechanisms underlying these processes have been studied in great molecular detail over the years (see Refs. 5Yaganimachi R. Knobil E. Neill J.D. The Physiology of Reproduction. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 189-317Google Scholar, 6Baldi E. Luconi M. Bonaccorsi M. Forti G. Front. Biosci. 2001; 5: 110-123Crossref Google Scholar, 7Flesh F.M. Gadella B.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1469: 197-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 8Martinez P. Morros A. Front. Biosci. 1996; 1: 103-117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar for reviews).Capacitation increases sperm plasma membrane lipid disorder, reducing the stability of such membrane in preparation for the hyperactivated motility and membrane fusion events that follow (8Martinez P. Morros A. Front. Biosci. 1996; 1: 103-117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One of the first lipid changes shown to occur in the spermatozoal membrane in this context is a significant loss of cholesterol (9Davis B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7560-7564Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). More recently, the normal transbilayer asymmetry of four phospholipids (PL) including SM in the sperm plasma membrane was shown to change as a result of capacitation (10Gadella B.M. Harrison R.A.P. Development. 2000; 127: 2407-2420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The basic facts that SM has a high affinity for cholesterol, that both lipids are abundant in the sperm plasma membrane, and that this membrane has an active neutral sphingomyelinase (SMase) activity (11Hinkovska V.T. Petkova D.H. Koumanov K.S. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1987; 65: 525-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) capable of producing Cer in situ suggest that the SM-Cer pair may well be involved in sperm membrane functions. Given the increasing importance being accorded to SM and its hydrolysis in the generation of biologically active, and membrane disturbing, membrane-bound metabolites, especially Cer, investigation of SM in regard to sperm functions is of obvious interest.Exposure of human spermatozoa to an exogenous SMase abbreviates by several hours the loss of sterols and sperm capacitation, measured as the ability of sperm to acrosome (react in response to progesterone), incubation of sperm with C6-Cer mimicking in part the SMase effects (12Cross N.L. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 63: 1129-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The acrosomal exocytosis triggered by Ca2+ in the presence of a calcium ionophore is enhanced after incubation of boar spermatozoa with the analogue C2-Cer and with a ceramidase inhibitor, the results suggesting that Cer may be involved in the mechanisms underlying the acrosomal reaction (13Murase T. Imaeda N. Kondoh N. Tsubota T. J. Reprod. Dev. 2004; 50: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The nature of the endogenous SM and Cer of spermatozoa and how the SM/Cer ratio is affected during normal sperm functioning remain to be investigated.In this work we studied SM and Cer, focusing on their fatty acids, in bull and ram spermatozoa isolated from fresh semen and in rat spermatozoa isolated from cauda epididymis. Beyond the exceptionality of their fatty acids, study of these lipids showed that conspicuous modifications in the SM/Cer ratio occur not only when spermatozoa are incubated in capacitating conditions, but even spontaneously when spermatozoa are isolated after a few simple steps. This biochemical information is of interest to both biophysicists and gamete physiologists, because the in situ conversion SM → Cer is likely to result in consequential changes in sperm membrane physicochemical properties and functions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSpermatozoa—Freshly ejaculated semen was collected from fertile Shorthorn bulls in a local breeding station, transported to the laboratory in a Dewar glass at 25 °C, and rapidly centrifuged at room temperature at 600 × g to separate the seminal plasma. The cells were then gently suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (95 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4) and centrifuged; this procedure was repeated twice to remove traces of seminal plasma (and its lipids) from sperm samples. Semen from Australian Merino rams was collected during the reproductive season and treated similarly. Rat spermatozoa were obtained from 4–5-month-old Wistar rats.For rat spermatozoa isolation, caudal epididymi were excised, freed of their fat pad and blood vessels, and transferred to small dishes containing PBS. A few incisions were made with a scalpel blade in the sperm-rich area of each epididymis. The organs thus treated were gently incubated for 15 min at 34 °C to allow release and diffusion of spermatozoa and then removed. The spermatozoa were obtained from the supernatants by centrifugation at 600 × g. They were then resuspended in 65% (w/v) sucrose at 4 °C and purified in a discontinuous density gradient, made up of 70 and 75% (w/v) sucrose in PBS. These steps decreased the yield but increased the purity of the epididymal spermatozoa samples, in comparison with the procedures used in an earlier report (14Aveldaño M.I. Rotstein N.P. Vermouth N.T. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). When present, the metal-ion chelator EDTA was incorporated at a concentration of 2.5 mm in the medium used for sperm isolation, including the initial PBS and the sucrose solutions. It was necessary to pool spermatozoa isolated from the epididymi of several rats to obtain sufficient material for analysis of SM, Cer, and their fatty acids.Sperm Heads and Tails—To separate sperm heads from tails, spermatozoa from freshly ejaculated bull semen or from the epididymi of several rats were gently suspended in PBS containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the samples were sonicated at 30-s intervals using a model 250 Branson sonifier (15Gitlits V.M. Toh B.H. Loveland K.L. Sentry J.W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The resulting mixture of heads and tails was pelleted at 600 × g at 4 °C, resuspended in 65% sucrose, and loaded onto a step gradient made up of 70 and 75% (w/v) sucrose in PBS-phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The tubes were centrifuged at 104,000 × g at 4 °C for 60 min. The head fraction was collected as a pellet. The fraction at the 65–70% sucrose interface containing the tail-rich fraction was collected, resuspended, and purified by a further centrifugation (104,000 × g, 4 °C, 60 min) on a 65–75% sucrose gradient. The purity of the fractions was verified by light microscopy.Detergent Solubilization of Head Phospholipids—A bull sperm head fraction prepared as just described was solubilized with a nonionic detergent to study the fatty acids of the SM present in the detergent-soluble and nonsoluble fractions. The following procedure was chosen in view of its successful application to the study of the localization of enzymes in human spermatozoal parts (16Horowitz J.A. Toeg H. Orr G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 832-838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and because it has been reported to completely remove the plasma membrane from whole, intact spermatozoa (17Fisch J.D. Behr B. Conti M. Human Reprod. 1998; 13: 1248-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Briefly, the pellet of sperm heads was suspended and homogenized in a hypotonic solution (58.5 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 58.5 mm KH2PO4, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4), containing 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The resulting homogenate was centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 15 min to separate the sperm cytosolic fraction. The pellet was resuspended in 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) prepared in the same saline buffer. The suspension was agitated gently for 10 min and then centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 15 min. This produced a detergent-soluble supernatant and a detergent-insoluble pellet. A temperature of 4 °C was maintained throughout.Incubations of Rat Spermatozoa—Spermatozoa were isolated from the epididymi of a dozen rats in PBS containing or lacking EDTA, pelleted at 600 × g, and washed once in the same medium to reduce in the latter group possible divalent cations from the epididymal tissue. After discarding the supernatants, the cells were gently resuspended in a Krebs-Ringer (KR)-based medium (95 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, and 5.5 mm glucose, pH 7.4) in three different conditions. The cells that had been isolated in media containing EDTA were resuspended in KR containing 2.5 mm EDTA. The cells that had not been in contact with this chelator were divided into equal groups, pelleted, and resuspended in KR containing 2 mm CaCl2, 25 mm NaHCO3, and 0.4% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma), a medium classically used to stimulate sperm capacitation (18Toyoda Y. Chang M.C. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1974; 36: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) or KR not containing these three factors. The three groups of cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C under a 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere. After incubations, aliquots were fixed and stained with Coomassie Blue for assessment of acrosomal status as described by Larson and Miller (19Larson J.L. Miller D.J. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1999; 52: 445-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Sperm counting was carried out using a Neubauer hemocytometric chamber.Lipid Separation—Most of the solvents used in this work were high pressure liquid chromatography grade (JT Baker; UVE, Dorwill, Argentina). After preparation of lipid extracts, centrifugation, and partition (20Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42174) Google Scholar), the organic phases containing the lipids were recovered, and the solvents were evaporated under N2. The aliquots were taken for measuring total lipid phosphorus content in samples (21Rouser G. Fleischer S. Yamamoto A. Lipids. 1970; 5: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2859) Google Scholar). For analysis of phospholipid class composition, aliquots of the extracts were spotted on high performance TLC plates (Merck) and resolved using chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (50:37.5:3.5:2, by volume), after presaturating the plates with the solvent vapors for 15 min (22Holub B.J. Skeaff C.M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 141: 234-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). After separation, the phospholipid spots were located with the aid of iodine vapors, scraped from the plates, and quantified by phosphorus analysis (21Rouser G. Fleischer S. Yamamoto A. Lipids. 1970; 5: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2859) Google Scholar).To isolate Cer for fatty acid analysis, lipid extracts from spermatozoa or their parts were spotted (as bands) on TLC plates (500 μm, silica gel G) under N2, along with commercial standards (Sigma). Ceramides were resolved using chloroform/methanol/ammonia/water (90:10:05:0.5, by volume) (3Furland N.E. Zanetti S.R. Oresti M.G. Maldonado E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18141-18150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) as solvent. This solvent was run up to the middle of the plates, dried under N2, and followed by a run up to the top of the plates with hexane/ether (80:20, by volume), to separate other neutral lipids (not described here). The silica support containing the total polar lipids remaining at the origin of these plates was collected for preparative isolation of SM. The PL were eluted by three successive washings of this lipid-laden silica with chloroform/methanol/water (1:1:0.2, by volume). The eluates were collected, and the solvents then were partitioned by the addition of 0.8 volumes of water. The organic phases were dried under N2 and subjected to TLC to isolate SM, using chloroform: methanol:acetic acid:0.15 m NaCl (50:25:8:2.5, by volume) (23Brown E. Subbaiah P.

The zones containing SM and Cer were scraped into tubes for further elution, performed as detailed above. The eluted SM and Cer were taken to dryness and treated (under N2) with 0.5 n NaOH in anhydrous methanol at 50 °C for 10 min to remove any potential lipid contaminant with ester-bound fatty acids. After alkaline treatment, chloroform and 0.5 n HCl were added to the methanol, the organic phase was rapidly recovered and dried, and the lipids were separated again by TLC.Fatty Acid Analysis—The fatty acid composition of SM and Cer was determined by gas-liquid chromatography of their fatty acid methyl ester derivatives. These were prepared by warming the dry lipid samples and placing them overnight at 45 °C in Teflon®-lined screw capped tubes in the presence of 0.5 n H2SO4 in anhydrous methanol (24Christie W.W. Lipid Analysis.2nd Ed. Pergamon Press, Oxford, UK1982: 51-61Google Scholar) (under N2). Methyl heneicosanoate was added as an internal standard for quantitative analysis (2 μg/sample to measure Cer fatty acids). Before GC, the fatty acid methyl ester samples with the internal standard were routinely purified by TLC (using hexane/ether, 95:5, by volume) on silica gel G plates that had been previously washed (with methanol/ethyl ether, 75:25, by volume). The methyl esters were located after spraying the plates with 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein, scraped into tubes, and recovered after thoroughly mixing the silica support with methanol: water:hexane (1:1:1, by volume), carrying out three successive hexane extractions.The VLCPUFA of SM and Cer were identified by procedures and criteria detailed in previous work, including GC-MS. The VLCPUFA of ram spermatozoa have been characterized in detail by GC-MS by Poulos et al. (1Poulos A. Johnson D.E. Beckman K. White I.G. Easton C. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 961-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The major VLCPUFA of bull SM and Cer were the same as those characterized in ram and were also identical to the VLCPUFA previously characterized by GC-MS in bovine retina rod outer segment phosphatidylcholine (25Aveldaño M.I. Sprecher H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1180-1186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Those of rat spermatozoa were the same as those previously identified by GC-MS in the SM of rat testis (2Robinson B.S. Johnson D.W. Poulos A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 268: 1746-1751Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and in SM and Cer of rat seminiferous tubules (3Furland N.E. Zanetti S.R. Oresti M.G. Maldonado E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18141-18150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).For fatty acid composition analysis, a Varian 3700 gas chromatograph and a Varian Star Chromatography Work station (version 4.51) were used. The instrument was equipped with two (2 mm × 2 m) glass columns packed with 15% SP 2330 on Chromosorb WAW 100/120 (Supelco, Inc. CA) and two flame ionization detectors, operated in the dual-differential mode. The column oven temperature was programmed from 150 to 230 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min. This final temperature was then held constant for 30 min (rat) to 50 min (bull and ram) per run to allow VLCPUFA enough time to emerge from the column. Injector and detector temperatures were 220 and 230 °C, respectively, and N2 (30 ml/min) was the carrier gas.The fatty acid compositions of SM and Cer are expressed on a weight percentage basis in accordance with the described procedures. SM and Cer amounts are expressed as the sum of their respective fatty acid amounts, with no corrections for the presence of the sphingoid base in the two lipids or of phosphorylcholine in SM. SM/Cer ratios were calculated by dividing the sums of their respective total fatty acids (proportional to mole ratios). To simplify the presentation of the fatty acid data in the figures, the acyl groups of SM and Cer are grouped into saturated, monoenoic, dienoic, and very long-chain polyenoic fatty acids and appear as their sums.RESULTSSM and Cer of Whole Spermatozoa—After inspection of all major polar and neutral lipid classes separated by TLC, SM, and Cer were found to be the only lipids to contain VLCPUFA in spermatozoa. We unexpectedly found that VLCPUFA were major fatty acid components of both sphingolipids in fresh spermatozoa from adult, fertile bulls (≥70%) (Table 1). Ram spermatozoa, analyzed for comparison with bulls, had even higher percentages of VLCPUFA in the two lipids. In rams, there was a net predominance of n-3 hexaenoic VLCPUFA, the three major fatty acids of SM and Cer being 32:6n-3, 30:6n-3, and 34:6n-3 in agreement with the GC-MS tracings shown in Ref. 1Poulos A. Johnson D.E. Beckman K. White I.G. Easton C. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 961-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar. In bulls, the same VLCPUFA occurred, although a higher percentage of VLCPUFA of the n-6 series than in rams were observed.TABLE 1Fatty acid composition of sphingomyelin and ceramide from testis and spermatozoaFatty acidBull testisBull spermatozoaRam spermatozoaSMCerSMCerSMCer14:00.65 ± 0.090.37 ± 0.090.21 ± 0.050.27 ± 0.240.40 ± 0.010.44 ± 0.0514:10.12 ± 0.030.07 ± 0.070.06 ± 0.010.08 ± 0.030.150.08 ± 0.0415:00.35 ± 0.070.52 ± 0.200.09 ± 0.030.07 ± 0.020.20 ± 0.010.29 ± 0.1515:10.10 ± 0.030.08 ± 0.110.03 ± 0.020.01 ± 0.010.09 ± 0.010.16 ± 0.0616:040.55 ± 2.3222.42 ± 2.8610.23 ± 1.615.55 ± 0.8014.36 ± 0.284.28 ± 1.0316:10.55 ± 0.391.45 ± 0.180.26 ± 0.130.34 ± 0.080.76 ± 0.061.35 ± 0.3017:01.56 ± 0.160.97 ± 0.080.18 ± 0.030.14 ± 0.070.31 ± 0.040.26 ± 0.0617:10.10 ± 0.060.55 ± 0.370.04 ± 0.020.11 ± 0.090.15 ± 0.030.17 ± 0.0618:07.96 ± 0.639.45 ± 1.321.51 ± 0.316.28 ± 1.985.11 ± 0.033.76 ± 1.6118:10.71 ± 0.414.67 ± 0.920.21 ± 0.100.49 ± 0.081.15 ± 0.031.64 ± 0.1419:00.34 ± 0.080.55 ± 0.700.05 ± 0.030.09 ± 0.040.16 ± 0.010.16 ± 0.0118:20.17 ± 0.131.78 ± 2.360.03 ± 0.020.08 ± 0.060.44 ± 0.020.40 ± 0.1220:01.02 ± 0.130.98 ± 0.960.61 ± 0.201.80 ± 0.113.39 ± 0.042.57 ± 1.0720:10.04 ± 0.030.34 ± 0.150.02 ± 0.010.04 ± 0.030.040.05 ± 0.0221:00.26 ± 0.030.090.05 ± 0.020.05 ± 0.010.08 ± 0.010.0922:06.06 ± 0.434.71 ± 0.322.63 ± 0.764.18 ± 0.422.02 ± 0.011.19 ± 0.2522:10.44 ± 0.040.46 ± 0.270.16 ± 0.040.40 ± 0.150.18 ± 0.0323:02.91 ± 0.232.46 ± 0.280.45 ± 0.100.46 ± 0.140.090.1123:10.94 ± 0.131.57 ± 0.500.24 ± 0.050.070.0624:09.20 ± 0.4911.63 ± 1.732.02 ± 0.691.76 ± 0.450.48 ± 0.020.62 ± 0.0124:116.11 ± 2.0816.62 ± 3.141.88 ± 0.392.71 ± 0.751.08 ± 0.050.64 ± 0.0224:20.30 ± 0.040.34 ± 0.341.10 ± 0.172.03 ± 0.480.10 ± 0.030.06 ± 0.0126:01.31 ± 0.311.04 ± 0.430.88 ± 0.060.57 ± 0.070.14 ± 0.050.05 ± 0.0424:4n-60.35 ± 0.060.41 ± 0.360.20 ± 0.050.0124:5n-60.69 ± 0.120.81 ± 0.390.22 ± 0.060.22 ± 0.080.020.04 ± 0.0224:5n-30.15 ± 0.050.20 ± 0.270.24 ± 0.080.11 ± 0.110.0126:3 + 24:60.25 ± 0.130.52 ± 0.443.59 ± 0.360.09 ± 0.040.200.2426:4n-60.14 ± 0.140.28 ± 0.055.16 ± 0.220.07 ± 0.0126:5n-60.24 ± 0.090.140.36 ± 0.080.33 ± 0.090.27 ± 0.090.20 ± 0.1026:5n-30.00 ± 0.000.48 ± 0.030.03 ± 0.0328:3 + 26:60.03 ± 0.010.01 ± 0.040.91 ± 0.050.51 ± 0.070.020.0128:4n-60.87 ± 0.211.95 ± 0.2718.79 ± 0.3724.67 ± 0.602.05 ± 0.042.91 ± 0.2328:5n-60.08 ± 0.050.12 ± 0.130.10 ± 0.010.15 ± 0.0828:5n-30.30 ± 0.140.47 ± 0.131.17 ± 0.181.71 ± 0.231.71 ± 0.061.92 ± 0.5028:6n-30.01 ± 0.000.04 ± 0.060.09 ± 0.0530:4n-60.24 ± 0.090.44 ± 0.2313.84 ± 1.928.86 ± 0.720.78 ± 0.010.83 ± 0.0530:5n-60.02 ± 0.010.19 ± 0.093.42 ± 0.743.53 ± 0.810.07 ± 0.010.14 ± 0.1630:5n-30.09 ± 0.050.19 ± 0.100.95 ± 0.180.60 ± 0.220.72 ± 0.010.71 ± 0.0830:6n-31.30 ± 0.142.90 ± 0.524.28 ± 0.994.73 ± 0.9913.56 ± 0.0615.40 ± 1.5232:4n-60.70 ± 0.180.17 ± 0.0632:5n-60.02 ± 0.010.03 ± 0.026.64 ± 2.034.54 ± 1.680.08 ± 0.020.08 ± 0.0432:6n-32.75 ± 0.436.92 ± 0.6116.09 ± 2.6513.72 ± 2.8440.62 ± 0.1051.11 ± 2.2634:5n-60.23 ± 0.321.88 ± 0.820.89 ± 0.1534:6n-30.46 ± 0.161.05 ± 0.143.59 ± 0.482.44 ± 0.299.03 ± 0.077.56 ± 0.12VLCPUFA8.23 ± 1.3416.49 ± 2.0077.29 ± 2.8572.27 ± 2.9069.23 ± 0.1081.39 ± 4.90 Open table in a new tab SM amounted to 13–15% of the total PL present in bull (Fig. 1) and ram spermatozoa, thus the 70–80% VLCPUFA in this lipid class represents values ranging from 9 to 12% of the total fatty acids of bull sperm cells. Because Cer had a similarly high percentage of VLCPUFA, and the SM/Cer ratio was in the order of 2.5 for the spermatozoa whose fatty acids are shown in Table 1, the sum of SM + Cer contributed a total of ∼12–15% of VLCPUFA to the total fatty acid weight of whole bull and ram spermatozoa, a far from negligible amount.The percentage of SM with respect to the total PL was almost twice as large in sperm as in testis (15 and 8% of the total PL, respectively). The percentage of VLCPUFA with respect to total SM fatty acids was 8-fold larger in sperm as in testis (70 and 8%, respectively; Table 1), this concentration obviously being an important feature of epididymal maturation. Spermatozoa isolated from caput and cauda epididymi (not shown) displayed intermediate values between these extremes, indicating that the VLCPUFA-rich SM of sperm originate in the testis and that part of these lipid species are conserved in the cells as they mature in the epididymis. The fact that SM gained importance with respect to other reflects the fact that more of the latter than of the SM was lost in the process of epididymal sperm remodeling, which entails a condensation of the cell (4Williams R.M. Graham J.K. Hammerstedt R.H. Biol. Reprod. 1991; 44: 1080-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Similarly, the fact that VLCPUFA concentrated in SM at sperm maturation indicates this lipid lost most of its original saturated and monoenoic fatty acids in the process. Epididymal remodeling of sperm lipid also qualitatively affected the fatty acids of SM, as suggested by the fact that 28:4n-6, from being just one of the VLCPUFA of bull testicular SM, became the major N-acyl group of mature bull spermatozoal SM.The described difference between the fatty acid composition of testicular and spermatozoal SM was also observed in rat. Whereas the SM of rat testis had a series of tetraenoic and pentaenoic VLCPUFA up to 32:5n-6 (3Furland N.E. Zanetti S.R. Oresti M.G. Maldonado E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18141-18150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), the SM of rat spermatozoa had much less pentaenes, with 28:4n-6 becoming the most prominent component of this group of fatty acids.The spermatozoa of the three mammals examined had in common a significant amount of Cer with a fatty acid pattern similar to that of SM.

Their common feature is the presence of one or more thrombospondin type-1 repeats (TSRs) within a characteristic modular organization. ADAMTS like-1/punctin-1 has four TSRs. Previously, O-fucosylation on Ser or Thr mediated by the endoplasmic reticulum-localized enzyme protein-O-fucosyltransferase 2 (POFUT2) was described for TSRs of thrombospondin-1, properdin, and F-spondin within the sequence Cys-Xaa1-Xaa2-(Ser/Thr)-Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Gly (where the fucosylated residue is underlined). On mass spectrometric analysis of tryptic peptides from recombinant secreted human punctin-1, the appropriate peptides from TSR2, TSR3, and TSR4 were found to bear either a fucose monosaccharide (TSR3, TSR4) or a fucose-glucose disaccharide (TSR2, TSR3, TSR4). Although mass spectral analysis did not unambiguously identify the relevant peptide from TSR1, metabolic labeling of cells expressing TSR1 and the cysteine-rich module led to incorporation of [3H]fucose into this construct. Mutation of the putative modified Ser/Thr residues in TSR2, TSR3, and TSR4 led to significantly decreased levels of secreted punctin-1. Similarly, expression of punctin-1 in Lec-13 cells that are deficient in conversion of GDP-mannose to GDP-fucose substantially decreased the levels of secreted protein, which were restored upon culture in the presence of exogenous l-fucose. In addition, mutation of the single N-linked oligosaccharide in punctin-1 led to decreased levels of secreted punctin-1. Taken together, the data define a critical role for N-glycosylation and O-fucosylation in the biosynthesis of punctin-1. From a broad perspective, these data suggest that O-fucosylation may be a widespread post-translational modification in members of the ADAMTS superfamily with possible regulatory consequences.

Although its function is unknown, we have been interested in it as a structural and biochemical model for the ancillary domain of the ADAMTS proteases. Here, we specifically investigated the post-translational modification of punctin-1 by O-fucosylation of its TSRs. Punctin-1 is particularly well suited for such analysis since it contains four TSRs (Fig. 1A), yet it is relatively small (60 kDa) when compared with ADAMTS proteases bearing the same number of TSRs, which facilitates its purification as a recombinant protein (4Hirohata S.

The addition of O-fucose to TSRs is mediated by a distinct enzyme: protein-O-fucosyltransferase 2 (POFUT2) (17Luo Y. Koles K. Vorndam W. Haltiwanger R.S. Panin V.M. J. Biol.

Interestingly, both POFUT1 and POFUT2 are endoplasmic reticulum-localized enzymes that only modify properly folded EGF repeats or TSRs, respectively. Both enzymes have been proposed to function in protein folding and quality control (17Luo Y. Koles K. Vorndam W. Haltiwanger R.S. Panin V.M. J. Biol.

Analysis of fucosylated peptides from thrombospondin-1, F-spondin, and properdin suggested a consensus sequence within each substrate, i.e. Cys1-Xaa(2/3)-(Ser/Thr)-Cys2-Xaa2-Gly (where Cys1 and Cys2 are the 1st and 2nd conserved Cys residue in the TSR) and identified a Ser or Thr residue within this consensus sequence (underlined) as the recipient amino acid for O-fucosylation (16Gonzalez de Peredo A.

The high prevalence of this specific modification in the TSRs of these proteins (16Gonzalez de Peredo A. Klein D. Macek B. Hess D. Peter-Katalinic J. Hofsteenge J. Mol. Cell.

The ADAMTS superfamily contains over 150 TSRs in humans, more than any other class of molecules, suggesting that it could collectively be the major class of substrates for POFUT2. Several members of the ADAMTS superfamily have been implicated in inherited or acquired human disorders: ADAMTS2 in dermatosparaxis, an inherited skin fragility (25Colige A. Sieron A.L. Li S.W.

Because of this high biomedical significance, the general molecular features, including post-translational modification, as well as the regulatory and operational mechanisms of this superfamily are of considerable interest. Whether or not O-fucosylation of TSRs occurs in the ADAMTS superfamily, and its functional significance is hitherto unknown, although every ADAMTS member carries at least one TSR containing the appropriate consensus sequence. Here we have investigated the occurrence and functional relevance of TSR O-fucosylation in the ADAMTS superfamily using punctin-1 as the principal model. The results demonstrate a significant role for O-fucosylation of TSRs as well as N-glycosylation in mediating the efficient secretion of punctin-1 and are thus of broad potential significance for the ADAMTS superfamily. Plasmid Constructs And Site-directed Mutagenesis—The cDNA plasmid for expression of human punctin-1 with a C-terminal tandem Myc and His6 tag was previously described (4Hirohata S. Wang L.W. Miyagi M. Yan L. Seldin M.F. Keene D.R. Crabb J.W. Apte S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12182-12189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Mutations of specific amino acids (N251Q, T312A, S391A, and T451A) were introduced in punctin-1 using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Primers used for mutagenesis are available upon request. A truncated protein construct (TSR1-CRD) containing only TSR1 and the cysteine-rich domain (CRD) was generated by PCR using the full-length punctin-1 construct as template, and the sequence was verified and cloned into pFLAG-CMV-5c (Sigma-Aldrich) for expression with a C-terminal FLAG tag. Wild-type, truncated, and mutant plasmids were expressed in the various cell lines described below. Cell Culture and Transfections—HEK293F, COS-1, CHO, and Lec1 cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and were routinely maintained as described previously (4Hirohata S. Wang L.W. Miyagi M.

Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 249: 533-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Lec1 cells are CHO derivatives that are deficient in the activity of the Golgi enzyme N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (GlcNAc-TI), which is required for the synthesis of hybrid and complex-type N-linked oligosaccharides (35Kumar R. Stanley P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5713-5717Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 36Stanley P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 923-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Since the catalytic step mediated by this enzyme is a prerequisite for the addition of fucose to N-linked oligosaccharides, Lec1 cells incorporate fucose at sites of O-fucosylation but not N-glycosylation (37Moloney D.J. Lin A.I. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19046-19050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Lec1 cells can, however, modify proteins with a simple oligomannose-type N-linked oligosaccharide (37Moloney D.J. Lin A.I. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19046-19050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Lec13 cells (kindly provided by Dr. Pamela Stanley, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, NY) are CHO derivatives that are deficient in the conversion of GDP-mannose to GDP-fucose because of a mutation in GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase (34Ripka J. Adamany A. Stanley P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 249: 533-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, they are entirely reliant on l-fucose in conditioned medium (the scavenger pathway) for incorporation of fucose in target oligosaccharides. Subconfluent cells were transiently transfected with the respective plasmids using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) as per the manufacturer's recommendation. As an internal control to normalize transfection and secretion efficiency, cells were co-transfected with a plasmid (HIgG-pRK5) encoding the Fc portion of human IgG (kindly provided by Dr. Jen-Chih Hsieh) (38Hsieh J.C. Kodjabachian L. Rebbert M.L. Rattner A. Smallwood P.M. Samos C.H. Nusse R. Dawid I.B. Nathans J. Nature. 1999; 398: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar), which lacks any consensus sites for O-fucosylation. To study the effect of O-fucosylation on punctin-1, transfected Lec13 cells were depleted of their fucose stores by culture in medium lacking l-fucose for 5 days prior to transfection. In parallel experiments to permit O-fucosylation, culture was done in medium supplemented with 1 mm l-fucose (Sigma-Aldrich). For production of recombinant punctin-1, HEK293F cells were transfected as above, and stably selected clones were identified and propagated essentially as described previously (39Somerville R.P. Longpre J.M. Jungers K.A. Engle J.M. Ross M. Evanko S. Wight T.N. Leduc R. Apte S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9503-9513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Deglycosylation, SDS-PAGE, and Western Blotting—Removal of N-linked oligosaccharide of punctin-1 using peptide-N-glycanase F (Sigma-Aldrich) was done following denaturation as described previously (4Hirohata S. Wang L.W. Miyagi M. Yan L. Seldin M.F. Keene D.R. Crabb J.W. Apte S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12182-12189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Punctin-1 was detected by Western blotting after reducing SDS-PAGE using anti-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 (Invitrogen) or anti-FLAG polyclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). IgG was detected on Western blots using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). For normalization of cellular levels of punctin-1, Western blotting of cell lysate was done using both anti-Myc monoclonal antibody and anti-glyceraldehyde-3 phosphate dehydrogenase (anti-GAPDH, Chemicon, Temecula, CA). To detect binding of these antibodies, we used the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Signal intensity of the relevant bands from ECL films was quantitated using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Ratios of signal intensity of the punctin band to the signal intensity of human IgG (conditioned medium) or GAPDH (cell lysates) on the same gel were obtained for comparison of the levels of secreted and intracellular protein, respectively. Statistical analysis was done using the Student's t test. Metabolic Labeling, Affinity Purification, and Fluorography—Metabolic labeling with [3H]fucose was done essentially as described by Nita-Lazar and Haltiwanger (40Nita-Lazar A. Haltiwanger R.S. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 347: 57-68PubMed Google Scholar). HEK293F cells were cultured in 6-well plates containing 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum/well. They were transfected with full-length punctin-1 or TSR1-CRD plasmids when 60% confluent. 16 h following transfection, the medium was changed to 1 ml of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 μCi/ml l-[6-3H]fucose (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO), and cells were incubated for a further 48 h and then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. 100 μl of cell culture lysis reagent (Promega Corp, Madison, WI) with Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics) was added to the wells. FLAG-tagged proteins were affinity-purified from the cell lysates using EZ-View Red anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel as per the manufacturer's protocol (30 μl gel/100 μl lysate, Sigma-Aldrich). Untransfected metabolically labeled cells were processed similarly as a negative control. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling, electrophoresed by reducing SDS-PAGE, and detected either by Western blotting using an anti-FLAG polyclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) or by fluorography. For fluorography, eluted proteins were electrophoresed by reducing SDS-PAGE. The gel was soaked in Enlightening™ rapid autoradiography enhancer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and exposed to film for 10 days. Purification of Recombinant ADAMTSL1/Punctin-1—Of several stably transfected HEK-293F clones that were isolated, the clone with the highest production level was selected for protein purification. Cells were grown in serum-free medium (SFM II, Invitrogen) supplemented with l-glutamine in tripletier flasks (Nunc, Rochester, NY), and the medium was pooled for subsequent purification. Punctin-1 was purified from serum-free conditioned medium by affinity chromatography on nickel-Sepharose (ProBond resin, Invitrogen), utilizing the C-terminal His6 tag, essentially as described previously (4Hirohata S. Wang L.W. Miyagi M. Yan L. Seldin M.F. Keene D.R. Crabb J.W. Apte S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12182-12189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Protein purity was assessed by silver staining under reducing and non-reducing conditions. Analysis of Tryptic Peptides by Ion Trap Mass Spectrometry—Tryptic peptides were generated from 1 μg of reduced and alkylated punctin-1, and the resulting tryptic peptides were analyzed by LC-MS/MS using an Agilent XCT ion trap mass spectrometer as described (41Nita-Lazar A. Haltiwanger R.S. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 417: 93-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, the peptides were separated on a Zorbax 300SB-C8 column (3.5-μm beads, 150 × 0.3 mm, Agilent) with the following gradient: 0–5 min, 5% buffer B; 5–85 min, 5–35% buffer B; 85–105 min, 35–95% buffer B; 105–115 min, 95% buffer B (where buffer A = 0.1% formic acid, and buffer B = 95% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid). The effluent from the column was sprayed directly into the ion trap mass spectrometer under the conditions described in Ref. 41Nita-Lazar A. Haltiwanger R.S. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 417: 93-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar. The scanning range was 400–2200 m/z, and collision-induced dissociation (CID) fragmentation (MS/MS) was performed on the two most intense ions in each MS spectrum, with exclusion after two spectra. Peptides modified with O-fucose glycans were identified by searching the data set for CID spectra that exhibit the characteristic neutral loss of the fucose-glucose disaccharide (dHex-Hex). The loss of this species is recognized as a 308-Da loss from the peptide molecular ion, taking into account the charge state of the respective ions in the CID spectrum. For instance, with doubly charged peptide ions, this loss produces a doubly charged fragment ion with an m/z difference of 154. Similarly, with triply charged peptide ions, this loss produces a triply charged fragment ion with an m/z difference of 102.7. Sequential loss of the glucose (Hex) followed by the fucose (dHex) gives a characteristic fragmentation pattern, permitting facile identification of modified peptides, where the most abundant fragment ion in the CID spectrum is the unglycosylated peptide (see Fig. 2) (41Nita-Lazar A. Haltiwanger R.S. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 417: 93-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This feature allows one to deduce the molecular weight of the unmodified peptide from the CID spectrum and determine which peptide is modified based on the known amino acid sequence of the protein and the specificity of the trypsin protease. The masses of the unmodified peptides, determined in the CID spectra shown in Fig. 2 and in the supplemental Data (and summarized in Table 1), were matched to the masses of the predicted tryptic peptides from human punctin-1 that contain a predicted O-fucose modification site (Cys1-Xaa-Xaa-(Ser/Thr)-Cys2-Xaa-Xaa-Gly). Since each of these peptides has a unique mass (see Table 1), there were no ambiguities in assigning the spectra. The presence of b- and/or y-ions"

While it is known that Duffy-negative individuals are highly resistant to Pv erythrocyte infection, little is known regarding Pv susceptibility among heterozygous carriers of a Duffy-negative allele (+/−). Our limited knowledge of the selective advantages or disadvantages associated with this genotype constrains our understanding of the effect that interventions against Pv may have on the health of people living in malaria-endemic regions. Methods and Findings We conducted cross-sectional malaria prevalence surveys in Papua New Guinea (PNG), where we have previously identified a new Duffy-negative allele among individuals living in a region endemic for all four human malaria parasite species. We evaluated infection status by conventional blood smear light microscopy and semi-quantitative PCR-based strategies. Analysis of a longitudinal cohort constructed from our surveys showed that Duffy heterozygous (+/−) individuals were protected from Pv erythrocyte infection compared to those homozygous for wild-type alleles (+/+) (log-rank tests: LM, p = 0.049; PCR, p = 0.065). Evaluation of Pv parasitemia, determined by semi-quantitative PCR-based methods, was significantly lower in Duffy +/− vs. +/+ individuals (Mann-Whitney U: p = 0.023). Overall, we observed no association between susceptibility to P. falciparum erythrocyte infection and Duffy genotype. Conclusions Our findings provide the first evidence that Duffy-negative heterozygosity reduces erythrocyte susceptibility to Pv infection. As this reduction was not associated with greater susceptibility to Pf malaria, our in vivo observations provide evidence that Pv-targeted control measures can be developed safely."
https://openalex.org/W1991067834,"We have determined the crystal structure of the ligand binding segment of the Enterococcus faecalis collagen binding MSCRAMM ACE (microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules adhesin of collagen from enterococci). This segment is composed of two subdomains, N1 and N2, each adopting an IgG-like fold and forming a putative collagen binding surface at the interface between the two subdomains. This structure is very similar to that recently reported for CNA, the collagen binding MSCRAMM of Staphylococcus aureus, for which a unique ligand binding mechanism called the Collagen Hug was proposed. We suggest that ACE binds collagen by a similar mechanism and present the first biochemical evidence for this binding model. Replacing residues in the putative collagen binding trench of ACE N2 with Ala residues affected collagen binding. A closed conformation of ACE stabilized by an engineered disulfide bond is unable to bind collagen. Finally, the importance of the residues in the N2 extension in stabilizing the MSCRAMM-ligand complex is demonstrated by selected point and truncation mutations."

Defects in E3 ubiquitin ligases are associated with severe immunological disorders, such as the loss of immunological tolerance and development of autoimmunity (3Liu Y.C. Penninger J. Karin M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 941-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Emerging evidence suggests that protein ubiquitination is a tightly controlled and reversible process that is counter-regulated by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), a family of cysteine proteases digesting ubiquitin chains (4Nijman S.M. Luna-Vargas M.P. Velds A. Brummelkamp T.R. Dirac A.M. Sixma T.K. Bernards R. Cell. 2005; 123: 773-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar). Like the E3s, the DUBs exist in large numbers, thus suggesting a high level of functional diversity and substrate specificity in their functions (4Nijman S.M. Luna-Vargas M.P. Velds A. Brummelkamp T.R. Dirac A.M. Sixma T.K. Bernards R. Cell. 2005; 123: 773-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar). However, despite the extensive studies on E3s, the physiological functions of DUBs are poorly defined. We have recently described the function of a DUB, CYLD, in regulating thymocyte development (5Reiley W.W. Zhang M. Jin W. Losiewicz M. Donohue K.B. Norbury C.C. Sun S.C. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). CYLD positively regulates thymic TCR signaling and is required for the generation of CD4 and CD8 mature thymocytes (5Reiley W.W. Zhang M. Jin W. Losiewicz M. Donohue K.B. Norbury C.C. Sun S.C. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). These findings provide the first example for how a DUB can function in the adaptive immune system. However, it is unclear whether CYLD also regulates other aspects of immune function, particularly the activation and homeostasis of lymphocytes.CYLD was originally identified as a tumor suppressor mutated in familial cylindromatosis (6Bignell G.R. Warren W. Seal S. Takahashi M. Rapley E. Barfoot R. Green H. Brown C. Biggs P.J. Lakhani S.R. Jones C. Hansen J. Blair E. Hofmann B. Siebert R. Turner G. Evans D.G. Schrander-Stumpel C.

Dermatol. 2005; 21: 217-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). More recent in vitro work suggests that CYLD functions as a DUB of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors and the regulatory subunit of IκB kinase (IKKγ) (8Brummelkamp T.R. Nijman S.M. Dirac A.M. Bernards R. Nature. 2003; 424: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar, 9Kovalenko A. Chable-Bessia C. Cantarella G. Israel A. Wallach D. Courtois G.

Ubiquitination of these signaling molecules appears to serve as a mechanism that activates their signal transduction functions (12Chen Z.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 758-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). Consistently, in vitro work demonstrates that CYLD inhibits the activation of NF-κB and MAP kinases (MAPKs) by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and tumor necrosis factor receptors (8Brummelkamp T.R. Nijman S.M. Dirac A.M. Bernards R. Nature. 2003; 424: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar, 9Kovalenko A. Chable-Bessia C. Cantarella G. Israel A. Wallach D. Courtois G.

Chem. 2004; 279: 55161-55167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). However, how CYLD regulates signal transduction under physiological conditions is still poorly understood. Recent studies using CYLD knock-out (CYLD-/-) mice suggest that the signaling function of CYLD is complex, which may involve distinct target proteins in different cell types and signaling pathways (5Reiley W.W. Zhang M. Jin W. Losiewicz M. Donohue K.B. Norbury C.C. Sun S.C. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 15Massoumi R. Chmielarska K. Hennecke K. Pfeifer A. Fassler R. Cell. 2006; 125: 665-677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). For example, the loss of CYLD in primary macrophages has no significant effect on the activation of NF-κB induced by tumor necrosis factor-α and TLR ligands (5Reiley W.W. Zhang M. Jin W. Losiewicz M. Donohue K.B. Norbury C.C. Sun S.C. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). On the other hand, CYLD modulates the signaling function of a protein tyrosine kinase, Lck, in thymocytes (5Reiley W.W. Zhang M. Jin W. Losiewicz M. Donohue K.B. Norbury C.C. Sun S.C. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and the nuclear translocation of an NF-κB coactivator protein, Bcl-3, in kerotinocytes (15Massoumi R. Chmielarska K. Hennecke K. Pfeifer A. Fassler R. Cell. 2006; 125: 665-677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Clearly, the precise signaling role of CYLD, especially that in the regulation of NF-κB, warrants further studies.NF-κB represents a family of transcription factors that regulates diverse genes involved in the activation and survival of lymphocytes (16Li Q. Verma I.M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (3253) Google Scholar). In mammals, the NF-κB family includes RelA, RelB, c-Rel, NF-κB1 (or p50), and NF-κB2 (or p52), which form different homo- and heterodimers. The NF-κB members are normally sequestered in the cytoplasm as inactive complexes by physical interaction with specific inhibitors, including IκBα and related proteins (17Bonizzi G. Karin M. Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 280-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2052) Google Scholar). Activation of NF-κB involves phosphorylation-triggered degradation of IκBα and nuclear translocation of NF-κB complexes, particularly the p50/RelA and p50/c-Rel dimers. A multisubunit IKK complex responds to diverse cellular stimuli and mediates the phosphorylation of IκBα (18Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4041) Google Scholar). In addition to this canonical pathway of NF-κB activation, a noncanonical pathway exists to mediate activation of two specific NF-κB members, RelB and NF-κB2 (17Bonizzi G. Karin M. Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 280-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2052) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence suggests that the deregulated activation of NF-κBs can cause severe immunological disorders, such as lymphoid malignancies and autoimmunity (19Xiao G. Cvijic M.E. Fong A. Harhaj E.W. Uhlik M.T. Waterfield M. Sun S.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6805-6815Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 20Sun S.C. Yamaoka S. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 5952-5964Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 21Kalled S.L. Immunol. Rev. 2005; 204: 43-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). As such, both the basal and the inducible activity of NF-κB are likely subject to negative mechanism of regulation, although the physiological negative regulators of NF-κB remain poorly defined.In the present study, we show that CYLD plays a critical role in preventing uncontrolled NF-κB activation in B cells. Consistently, CYLD-deficient B cells are hyperproliferative when stimulated in vitro and display elevated levels of antigen responses in vivo. The CYLD-/- mice develop B cell hyperplasia and lymphoid organ abnormalities, which can be further exacerbated when these animals are challenged with antigens. We further show that CYLD also regulates peripheral B cell development since the loss of CYLD results in abnormal production of marginal zone B cells. These findings establish CYLD as a key regulator of B cell activation and development and reveal a physiological function of CYLD in NF-κB regulation.MATERIALS AND METHODSMice—Cyld knock-out mice were generated as described (5Reiley W.W. Zhang M. Jin W. Losiewicz M. Donohue K.B. Norbury C.C. Sun S.C. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Cyld+/- mice were intercrossed to generate Cyld-/- and Cyld+/+ littermates. Genotyping was performed by PCR using tail DNA and the following primers: Cyld forward primer 1, 5′-CCA GGC ACT TTG AAT TGC TGT C-3′; Cyld reverse primer 1, 5′-CGT TCT TCC CAG TAG GGT GAA G-3′; Cyld reverse primer 2, 5′-GCA TGC TCC AGA CTG CCT TGG-3′.When the three primers were used together, the PCR yielded a 209-bp product for Cyld+/+ mice, a 209- and a 255-bp product for Cyld+/- mice, and a 255-bp product for Cyld-/- mice. Unless specified, mice were housed in specific pathogen-free cages and monitored periodically for the lack of common pathogens. For studies that involved housing of mice under conventional conditions, age- and sex-matched CYLD-/- and wild-type mice were transferred from ventilated cages to conventional cages and housed for 6 weeks. Animal experiments were in accordance with protocols approved by the Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.Antibodies and Reagents—The anti-CYLD antibody was generated by injecting rabbits with a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing an N-terminal region of human CYLD (amino acid 136-301). Phospho-IκBα (Ser-32) antibody was from Cell Signaling. Antibodies for actin (C-2), IKKβ (H470), tubulin (Tu-02), p50 (C-19), c-Rel (sc-70), and RelB (C-19) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Fluorescence-labeled anti-mouse antibodies used in flow cytometry included activated protein C-anti-C19Rp (AA4.1), APC-anti-CD3 (145-2C11), PE.CY7-anti-CD19 (1D3), FITC-anti-CD21 (7G6), PE-anti-CD23 (B3B4), FITC-anti-CD80 (16-10A1), PE-anti-CD86 (GL1), FITC-anti-IgD (11-26c.2a), and PerCP-Cy5.5-anti-IgM (R6-60.2). Anti-C19Rp, anti-CD80, and anti-CD86 were purchased from eBioscience, and the rest of the conjugated antibodies were from BD Biosciences. Unconjugated anti-IgM and anti-CD40, used for B cell stimulation, were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch and BD Biosciences, respectively. Sheep red blood cells (SRBC) and human recombinant BAFF were purchased from Cocalico Biologicals, Inc. and BIOSOURCE, respectively. GST-IKKβ was cloned by inserting a cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 166-197 of human IKKβ into pGEX-4T vector (Amersham Biosciences). Recombinant protein was produced in Escherichia coli and purified using GST-Sepharose. Cycloheximide was obtained from Sigma, and all other antibodies and reagents have been described previously (5Reiley W.W. Zhang M. Jin W. Losiewicz M. Donohue K.B. Norbury C.C. Sun S.C. Nat.

Chem. 2005; 280: 10018-10024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).Flow Cytometry—Bone marrow cells were prepared as described previously (24Waterfield M. Zhang M. Norman L.P. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 685-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Spleen and mesenteric lymph node (MLN) cell suspensions were prepared by gentle homogenization using a tissue homogenizer. Mononuclear cells were isolated by centrifugation over lymphocyte separation medium (Cellgro). Peritoneal cells were isolated by flushing the peritoneal cavity using 10 ml of PBS. Flow cytometry was performed as described previously (5Reiley W.W. Zhang M. Jin W. Losiewicz M. Donohue K.B. Norbury C.C. Sun S.C. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The data shown in Fig. 3D were collected using FACSCalibur, and all the other data were generated using FACSCanto. For analyses of in vitro cultured B cells, the cells were incubated for 48 h in Iscove's media either in the presence or in the absence of BAFF (100 ng/ml) and then subjected to flow cytometry.Cell Proliferation Assays—B cells were purified from splenocytes using anti-B220-conjugated magnetic beads (Miltenyl Biotec) and were stimulated in 4 replicate wells of 96-well plates (1 × 105 cells/well) with anti-IgM (10 μg/ml), anti-CD40 (2 μg/ml), or LPS (3 μg/ml). After the indicated times of stimulation, the cells were labeled for 5 h with [3H]thymidine for proliferation assays based on thymidine incorporation.For the carboxyl fluorescent succinimidyl ester (CFSE) cell proliferation assay, purified splenic B cells were washed once with PBS (prewarmed to 37 °C) and incubated with CFSE (1.25 μg/ml in PBS) for 10 min at 37 °C. After two washes with Iscove's medium, the cells were stimulated as described above followed by flow cytometry to measure the CFSE intensity.Mouse Immunization, Immunohistochemistry, and Antibody Analyses—Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 0.2 ml of SRBC (1 × 109/ml in PBS) and sacrificed 6 days later. Spleens were frozen in Tissue-Tec OCT compound (VWR International) using liquid nitrogen prechilled 2-methlbutane. The frozen tissues were stored at -70 °C until processed to produce 6-8-μm cryostat sections. The sections were stained with rat anti-mouse B220 (eBioScience) followed by biotinylated anti-rat immunoglobulin (Vector Laboratories) or with biotin-conjugated hamster anti-mouse CD3 (eBioScience), biotin-conjugated peanut agglutinin (Vector Laboratories). The immunostaining were then detected with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin using diaminobenzidine as chromagen (VECTASTAIN Elite ABC kit, Vector Laboratories).For analyses of antibody responses, mice were injected intra-peritoneally with 0.2 ml of nitro-phenol-conjugated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (NP-KLH) or nitro-phenol-conjugated LPS (NP-LPS) (0.1 mg/ml in PBS). Sera were collected at the indicated times after immunization and subjected to ELISA to detect NP-specific antibodies using the SBA Clonotyping system (Southern Biotechnology, Inc.).IB and EMSA—Purified B cells were stimulated with anti-IgM (2.5 μg/ml) or LPS (2.5 μg/ml) for the indicated times. Total and subcellular extracts were prepared from the cells and subjected to immunoblotting (IB) and EMSA as described previously (25Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 176419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3907) Google Scholar, 26Ganchi P.A. Sun S-C. Greene W.C. Ballard D.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1339-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In the case of protein phosphorylation analyses, cells were lysed in a kinase cell lysis buffer supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors (27Uhlik M. Good L. Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Zandi E. Karin M. Sun S-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21132-21136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). For antibody supershift assays, the nuclear extracts were premixed with 0.5 μl of the indicated antibodies for 8 min at room temperature and then mixed with the 32P-radiolabeled κB oligonucleotide in EMSA buffer.In Vitro Kinase Assays—IKKβ was isolated by immunoprecipitation from untreated MLN B cells followed by analyzing its catalytic activity by in vitro kinase assays (27Uhlik M. Good L. Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Zandi E. Karin M. Sun S-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21132-21136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) using GST-IKKβ as substrate.RT-PCR—Total cellular RNA was isolated from purified MLN B cells using the TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc.). Semiquantitative RT-PCR was performed using the following primers to amplify murine CD23, Iκbα and Gapdh, CD23 forward, 5′-GTG AGG ACT GTG TGA TGA TGC-3′; CD23 reverse, 5′-GAG GAG AAA TCC AGA AGA GTG-3′; Iκbα forward, 5′-CTG TTT GTG AAA CTG AAG AGC TG-3′; Iκbα reverse, 5′-CTT CAC AAA AGC AAC ATA GTG GC-3′; Gapdh forward, 5′-CTC ATG ACC ACA GTC CAT GCC ATC-3′; Gapdh reverse, 5′-CTG CTT CAC CAC CTT CTT GAT GTC-3′.RESULTSCYLD-/- Mice Display Lymphoid Organ Abnormalities and B Cell Hyperplasia—To investigate the role of CYLD in regulating immune system function, we began by analyzing the peripheral lymphoid organs of the CYLD-/- and wild-type mice. As early as 8 weeks of age, the CYLD-/- mice displayed striking enlargement of the MLNs, and this abnormality became even more profound at older ages (Fig. 1A). On the other hand, the CYLD-/- and wild-type mice did not show obvious size differences in other lymph nodes or the Peyer's patches, and only a small percentage of the CYLD-/- mice had slightly enlarged spleens (data not shown). Thus, a prominent lymphoid abnormality of the CYLD-/- mice is the enlargement of MLNs.FIGURE 1Lymphoid organ abnormalities and B cell hyperplasia in CYLD-/- mice. A, individual lymph nodes were dissected from the mesentery of wild-type (+/+) and CYLD-/- mice. This phenotype was observed in over 80% of the mice analyzed between 8 and 12 weeks of age (30 mice were analyzed). B and C, MLN cells were stained for B (CD19) and T (CD3) cell markers. The percentages of T and B cells are shown in a representative flow cytometry profile (B), and both the percentages and the absolute numbers of B cells are quantitated based on multiple animals with 8-12 weeks of age (C). D, splenocytes from +/+ and -/- mice (8-12 weeks of age) were analyzed by flow cytometry to determine the percentage of B cells (CD19+). The absolute numbers of B cells were calculated based on their percentage and the total numbers of splenocytes. Data are presented as mean ± S.D. of five animals in one experiment and are representative of five independent experiments. E, peritoneal cells were analyzed by flow cytometry based on expression of CD19 and B220 to detect the number of CD19hiB220lo B1 cells in wild-type and CYLD-/- animals (12 weeks of age).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To examine the effect of CYLD on lymphocyte homeostasis, we performed flow cytometry analyses to measure the frequency of B and T cells in MLNs. The CYLD-/- MLNs exhibited a profound increase in the percentage of B cells and a reduction in the percentage of T cells (Fig. 1B). The absolute number of MLN B cells was even more drastically increased in the CYLD-/- animals (Fig. 1C) due to the severe lymphadenopathy (Fig. 1A). We previously reported that the spleen of CYLD-/- mice contained more B cells and reduced numbers of T cells (5Reiley W.W. Zhang M. Jin W. Losiewicz M. Donohue K.B. Norbury C.C. Sun S.C. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Consistently, flow cytometry analyses of multiple animals revealed significantly higher frequency and numbers of B cells and reduced frequency and numbers of T cells in the spleens of CYLD-/- mice (Fig. 1D and data not shown).In addition to the mainstream B cells (B2 cells), we also analyzed the frequency of B1 cells, which are predominantly located in the peritoneal cavity. The CYLD-/- mice only showed a slight increase in this population of B cells in the peritoneal cavity (Fig. 1E) and no difference in spleen and MLNs (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that the loss of CYLD causes hyperplasia of mainstream B cells and abnormalities of peripheral lymphoid organs, especially MLNs.CYLD Plays a Minor Role in Regulating B Cell Development in the Bone Marrow—Peripheral B cells are derived from immature B cells generated in the bone marrow. Because of the peripheral B cell hyperplasia in CYLD-/- mice, we examined whether the loss of CYLD resulted in elevated generation of immature B cells in the bone marrow. Flow cytometry analyses of bone marrow CD19+ cells (B cells) detected three major populations: the early stages of developing B cells (ProPre B cells, IgM-IgD-), the immature B cells (IgM+IgD-), and the recirculating mature B cells (IgM+IgD+). The CYLD-/- mice did not produce more immature B cells but rather had a moderate reduction in this population of B cells (Fig. 2, A and B). This result suggests that CYLD plays a minor and positive role in B cell development at the immature B stage. Thus, the peripheral B cell hyperplasia of CYLD-/- mice was not due to the overproduction of immature B cells within the bone marrow.FIGURE 2Role of CYLD in B cell development and maturation. A and B, bone marrow cells from CYLD knock-out (-/-) and wild-type (+/+) mice were stained with fluorescence-conjugated anti-IgD and anti-IgM and subjected to flow cytometry to analyze the percentage of recirculating (RC), immature (IM), and early developing states of (ProPre) B cells (A). The data presented in B are mean ± S.D. of four animals in one experiment and are representative of four independent experiments. C and D, splenocytes from young wild-type and CYLD knock-out mice (8 weeks old) were stained with the indicated antibodies and analyzed by flow cytometry to determine the percentage of different subpopulations of B cells as defined previously (47Su T.T. Guo B. Wei B. Braun J. Rawlings D.J. Immunol. Rev. 2004; 197: 161-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). FM, follicular mature (IgMintIgDhi); T1, transitional 1 (IgMhi/IgDlo, CD21l0CD23lo); T2, transitional 2 (IgMhi/IgDhi); MZ, marginal zone (IgMhiIgDlo, CD21hiCD23lo); FO, follicular (CD21intCD23hi). Data are representative of 16 animals in four independent experiments. E and F, splenocytes from older wild-type and CYLD knock-out mice (14 weeks) were stained with the indicated antibodies and analyzed by flow cytometry as in C and D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)CYLD Regulates Marginal Zone B Cell Development—In the spleen, immature B cells go through transitional stages and eventually become follicular mature B cells or marginal zone B cells (28Cancro M.P. Immunol. Rev. 2004; 197: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To examine how the loss of CYLD affects peripheral B cell maturation, we analyzed the splenic B cell populations based on their defined surface markers (28Cancro M.P. Immunol. Rev. 2004; 197: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Young CYLD-/- mice (8 week) did not display profound alterations in B cell maturation (Fig. 2, C and D), although they had a slight reduction in the CD21loCD23lo T1 cells (Fig. 2D). Additionally, we detected a small increase in the CD21hiCD23lo marginal zone B cell population in these mutant animals (Fig. 2D). Interestingly, the increase in marginal zone B cells became much more prominent in older CYLD-/- mice (14 weeks), as assessed based on the staining of both CD21/CD23 (Fig. 2E) and another marginal zone B cell marker, CD1d (Fig. 2F). These results suggest a role for CYLD in regulating the peripheral development of B cells to marginal zone population.Spontaneous Activation of B Cells in CYLD-/- Mice—We next examined whether the B cell hyperplasia in CYLD-/- mice was associated with abnormal B cell activation. This possibility was first indicated in our analyses of B cell maturation markers. Although the CYLD deficiency in young mice did not profoundly alter the frequency of transitional and mature B cell subpopulations in the spleen (Fig. 2D), the CYLD-/- splenic B cells displayed considerably higher intensity of CD23 and CD21 (Fig. 3A, Total, dotted lines). This abnormality occurred primarily in follicular B cells (Fig. 3A, FO) but not marginal zone B cells (Fig. 3A, MZ). Since follicular B cells contain both mat"
https://openalex.org/W2004897610,"Very long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (VLCPUFA) have previously been shown to be components of sphingomyelin (SM) of mammalian testis and spermatozoa. Here we examined the fatty acids of testicular ceramide (Cer) in comparison with those of SM in some mammals with a special focus on the rat testis. In bull, cat, dog, rabbit, mouse, and rat, VLCPUFA were found in both testicular lipids, Cer having a higher percentage of VLCPUFA than SM. Rat testis had the highest percentage of VLCPUFA in both lipids, the major ones being 28:4n-6 and 30:5n-6. VLCPUFA-containing SM and Cer occurred in cells located in the seminiferous tubules, where germ cells had a higher percentage of these species than Sertoli cells. Seminiferous tubule fractionation showed that SM and Cer of mitochondria and lysosomes had mostly saturates and negligible VLCPUFA, the latter being important in the SM and Cer of microsomes and other membrane fractions. VLCPUFA were absent from the SM and Cer of rat prepuberal testis, increased with the onset of spermatogenesis to account for nearly 15 and 40% of the total fatty acids of testicular SM and Cer, respectively, remained at those levels throughout the adult life of fertile rats and tended to decrease at advanced ages. Four conditions that lead to selective death of germ cells in vivo, namely experimental cryptorchidism, post-ischemic reperfusion, focalized x-ray irradiation and treatments with the antineoplasic drug doxorubicin, caused the VLCPUFA to disappear from the testicular SM and Cer of adult fertile rats, showing that these lipids are specific traits of spermatogenic cells.

The main sphingolipids of eukaryotic cells, sphingoglycolipids and the sphingophospholipid sphingomyelin (SM), 2The abbreviations used are: SM, sphingomyelin; Cer, ceramide; CerS, ceramide synthase; PUFA, polyunsaturated fatty acids; VLC, very long chains; GC, gas chromatography. The fatty acids are named by the convention, number of carbon atoms:number of double bonds. play influential roles in membrane structure and function. They have been a focus of great interest in the past decade because some of their metabolites, ceramides, sphingoid bases, and phosphorylated sphingoid bases, have emerged as important messengers in cell signaling (1Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25847-25850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar, 2Futerman A.H. Hannun Y.A. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 777-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Ceramide (Cer), or N-acylsphingosine, constitutes the basic structure of sphingolipids. It has been the subject of thousands of studies, involved as it is, among other processes, in cell differentiation, stress, growth suppression, senescence, and apoptosis (3Pettus B.J. Chalfant C.E. Hannun Y.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1585: 114-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar, 4Cremesti A.E. Gonñi F.M. Kolesnick R.N. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Sphingomyelin and Cer serve many different functions at distinct locations in the cell, since changes in their molar ratio alter the membrane physical properties, thereby governing microdomain formation, membrane vesiculation and fusion, vesicle efflux, vesicular trafficking, and other aspects of membrane dynamics (5Kolesnick R.N. Gonñi F.M. Alonso A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 184: 285-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 6van Blitterswijk W.J. van der Luit A.H. Veldman R.J. Verheij M. Borst J. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 199-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Sphingomyelin and Cer are thus multifunctional lipids, the Cer involved in these functions mostly being generated from specific SM by specific sphingomyelinases or by de novo synthesis. Normal sphingolipid de novo biosynthesis, as well as catabolism, produce several intermediates that parallel the “mediators” produced from complex sphingolipid turnover, including Cer (7Linn S.C. Kim E.M. Keane E.M. Andras L.M. Wang E. Merrill Jr., A.H. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 831-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Thus, the steady-state levels of Cer in cells may be modified by a set of enzymes in different locations that form, remove, or modify the lipid. This complexity, and the fact that, with only a few exceptions like the skin (8Vietzke J. Brandt O. Abeck D. Rapp C. Strassner M. Schreiner V. Hintze U. Lipids. 2001; 36: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), Cer is naturally a minor lipid class in most animal tissues and cells, may explain why general information concerning the fatty acids of this lipid is in general scarce. Our interest in the fatty acids of the ceramides of testis and spermatozoa began with the expectation that they should differ from those of other tissues. We searched for very long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (VLCPUFA) in this lipid on the basis that Poulos and co-workers (9Poulos A. Johnson D.E. Beckman K. White I.G. Easton C. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 961-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 10Robinson B.S. Johnson D.W. Poulos A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1746-1751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) had identified this type of fatty acid, i.e. tetraenoic, pentaenoic, and hexaenoic fatty acids with up to 34 carbon atoms, as normal fatty acids of the testis and spermatozoa in a number of mammals including man, showing they were specific constituents of SM. In the testis from adult fertile mammals, continuous rounds of spermatogenesis occur in the seminiferous tubules. Germ cells differentiate from diploid spermatogonia to haploid spermatocytes and finally to spermatozoa with the structural and metabolic support of Sertoli cells. During normal spermatogenesis, the number of successfully maturing germ cells is determined by the supportive capacity of somatic Sertoli cells, supernumerary germ cells normally undergoing apoptosis, an important process in the regulation of the germ cell population (11Sinha Hikim A.P. Swerdloff R.S. Rev. Reprod. 1999; 4: 38-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Given the relationship between Cer and apoptosis, this physiological “background” of apoptosis was a second reason for our interest in investigating testicular Cer and its fatty acids in relation to those of SM. Tilly and Kolesnick (12Tilly J.L. Kolesnick R.N. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 102: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) predicted that SM-derived Cer and sphingosine 1-phosphate could have a potential impact on gonadal physiology by mediating apoptosis and its control in normal and pathological conditions, a concept that received confirmation in experiments measuring these metabolites in sections of human seminiferous tubules (13Suomalainen L. Halaka J.K. Pentika Inen V.P. Otala M. Erkkila K. Pentika Inen M.O. Dunkel L. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 88: 5572-5579Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The balance between cell growth stimulation and arrest in the mature testis involves a delicate equilibrium between biosynthesis, remodeling, catabolism and recycling of lipids, including sphingolipids and their fatty acids. The biochemical characteristics of the native SM and Cer present in germ cells from fertile adult animals have not yet been studied in detail. In this work we have examined, using standard chromatographic procedures, the fatty acids of the SM and Cer isolated from the testes of some mammals, with a special focus on the rat testis. Taking advantage of the knowledge that the population of germ cells in the testis is specifically sensitive to certain cell stressors, we studied their effects on the testicular SM and Cer fatty acids. We provide qualitative and quantitative data showing that both testicular lipids have far from negligible proportions of VLCPUFA and present evidence that these lipids are associated to healthy cells of the spermatogenic lineage in fertile adult animals. Testis—Four-month-old Wistar rats were used in all studies involving adult animals. The testes were obtained from anesthetized animals (5 mg/kg acepromazine and 50 mg/kg ketamine, intraperitoneal) which were sacrificed immediately thereafter. Protocols for animal experimentation were performed in accordance with the legal requirements of a local institutional animal research committee. The testes from animals other than rats and mice were obtained from local slaughterhouses immediately after the animal death (bulls, rabbits) or from a local veterinary office (dogs, cats) after standard surgical procedures. Testes were decapsulated and after removing visible blood vessels were rinsed in saline. Lipid extracts were prepared using mixtures of chloroform-methanol (14Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42878) Google Scholar). One testis from an adult rat (600–800 μg of total lipid phosphorus) was used to study Cer and its fatty acids, and 8–10 testes per sample were pooled to analyze the Cer of 14-day-old rats or mice. Seminiferous tubules from 20 adult rat testes per sample were used to analyze small subcellular fractions like mitochondria. Rat Seminiferous Tubules, Cellular and Subcellular Fractions—Seminiferous tubules were isolated from adult rat testes after successive dissociation and washings with Dulbbeco's modified Eagle's medium containing collagenase type I, glucose, and bicarbonate to separate tubules from interstitial cells (15Dufau M. Catt J.K. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 39: 252-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Two major cellular fractions were separated in bulk from the tubules, one enriched in germ cells and the other mostly containing Sertoli cells, after digestion with collagenase, trypsin, and hyaluronidase, followed by osmotic shock and filtration (16Anway M.D. Folmer J. Wright W.W. Zirkin B.R. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 68: 996-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The purity of the fractions obtained was satisfactory as evaluated by light microscopy, although the yield of Sertoli cells was low. Subcellular fractions were also prepared from seminiferous tubules, after removing interstitial cells. Crude nuclear and mitochondrial fractions were obtained by centrifuging sucrose homogenates from 20 testes at 1000 × g and 10,000 × g respectively. A clear supernatant and a buoyant membrane fraction floating on top of the tubes resulted from the latter centrifugation. The clear supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h to obtain a crude microsomal fraction. The buoyant membrane fraction was analyzed for comparison, with no further fractionation. Protocols that had been developed specifically to isolate pure nuclei (17Bläuer M. Husgafvelb S. Syväläc H. Tuohimaaa P. Ylikomia T. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 60: 588-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and mitochondria (18Singh H. Beckman K. Poulos A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21388-21395Google Scholar), employing gradients of Nycodenz® and Percoll®, respectively, were applied to the crude nuclear and mitochondrial fractions. A small lysosomal fraction was obtained as a pellet during the purification of the mitochondrial fraction. In Vivo Studies—Four different conditions that have been documented to result in the specific death of cells of the germinal lineage in Wistar rats were chosen to study their consequences on testicular SM and Cer: unilateral cryptorchidism, post-ischemic reperfusion, x-ray irradiation, and treatment with the antineoplasic drug doxorubicin. All procedures were performed in anesthetized animals. Unilateral cryptorchidism (19Farooqui S.M. Al-Bagdadi F. O'Donnell J.M. Rhett S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 407-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 20Barqawi A. Trummer H. Meacham R. Asian J. Androl. 2004; 6: 47-51PubMed Google Scholar) was induced in mature rats by displacing one of the testes, together with its ipsilateral epididymis, to the abdominal cavity through the inguinal channel, and practicing a small suture in the latter to prevent the testis from descending. The contralateral scrotal testes were used as controls. Ischemia was induced by a clockwise 720° torsion applied to the spermatic cord by open surgery (21Turner T.T. Brown K.J. Biol. Reprod. 1993; 49: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) for 1 h, followed by a return to the natural position to allow for reperfusion of the tissue. Exposure of testes to ionizing radiation was performed according to published procedures and doses (22Shetty G. Weng C. Bolden-Tiller O.U. Huhtaniemi I. Handelsman D.J. Meistrich M.L. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 4461-4469Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 23Kangasniemi M. Huhtaniemi I. Meistrich M.L. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 54: 1200-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Briefly, anesthetized animals were irradiated locally at a distance of 100 cm with a single total dose of 6.5 gray of X-rays produced by a linear accelerator. For the study of doxorubicin effects, a series of four doses (3 mg/kg, once a week during 4 weeks) (24Kato M. Makino S. Kimura H. Ota T. Furuhashi T. Nagamura Y. J. Toxicol. Sci. 2001; 26: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) were administered. The animals were sacrificed at different intervals after these interventions. The testes were evaluated histologically using standard hematoxilin-eosin staining procedures. The intervals chosen to study the long-term consequences of the described treatments on testicular SM and Cer were those showing a significant reduction in the population of germ cells in seminiferous tubules (e.g. as in Fig. 6). In all procedures described, the weight of the experimental testes had decreased significantly compared with that of controls (e.g. as in Fig. 7). The animals subjected to X-rays and doxorubicin proved to be infertile.FIGURE 7Effects of unilateral cryptorchidism. On the left panels, the effects of this condition on rat testicular weight and total lipid phosphorus (P), as well as on the amounts per testis of SM and Cer fatty acids are shown. On the right panels, the changes in the proportions of the main groups of fatty acids of SM and Cer, calculated from the fatty acid composition, are given. The letters S, M, D, and V refer to the sums of saturates, monoenes, dienes, and very long-chain polyenes, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Lipid Separation and Analysis—Most of the solvents used were HPLC-grade (JT Baker, Phillipsburg, NJ or UVE, Dorwill, Argentina). After preparation of lipid extracts, centrifugation. and partition (14Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42878) Google Scholar), the organic phases containing the lipids were recovered and the solvents were evaporated under N2. Aliquots were taken for total lipid phosphorus measurement (25Rouser G. Fleisher S. Yammamoto A. Lipids. 1970; 5: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2879) Google Scholar). The extracts were spotted (as bands) on TLC plates (500 μm, silica gel G) kept under N2 along with commercial standards (Sigma). Ceramides were resolved using chloroform/methanol/acetic acid, 95:4.5:0.5, by vol.) (8Vietzke J. Brandt O. Abeck D. Rapp C. Strassner M. Schreiner V. Hintze U. Lipids. 2001; 36: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) or chloroform/methanol/ammonia/water (90:10:05:0.5, by vol.) as solvents. The latter solvent was used to advantage to resolve the Cer into three groups of species (e.g. see Fig. 2). The silica support containing the total polar lipids, remaining at the origin of these plates, was collected. The phospholipids were eluted with chloroform/methanol/water (1:1:0.2, by vol.), and the eluates were partitioned by the addition of 0.8 volume of water. The organic phase was dried under N2 and subjected to preparative TLC to isolate SM using chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/0.15 M NaCl (50:25:8:2.5, by volume) (26Brown E. Subbaiah P. Lipids. 1994; 29: 825-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) as solvent, without presaturating the tank atmosphere with the solvent vapors. Lipid bands were located under ultraviolet light after spraying the TLC plates with 2′, 7′-dichlorofluorescein in methanol, exposing them to NH3 vapors in a closed tank and then spraying with water. The fluids were sprayed with the aid of N2 gas. The zones containing SM or Cer were scraped into tubes for further elution and analysis. The silica gel containing these lipids (under N2) was thoroughly blended with the above-mentioned mixtures of chloroform:methanol:water, using a vortex mixer, followed by centrifugation (three times). The combined eluates were partitioned with 1 m ammonia, and the lipids were recovered in the chloroform phase. The eluted SM and Cer were routinely taken to dryness and treated (under N2) with 0.5 n NaOH in anhydrous methanol at 50 °C for 10 min to remove any potential lipid contaminant with ester-bound fatty acids. After alkaline treatment, chloroform and 0.5 n HCl were added to the methanol, the organic phase was rapidly recovered and dried, and the lipids were separated again by TLC. The recovery of SM and Cer after all these steps was in the order of 60%, as ascertained by phosphorus and fatty acid analysis of the same lipids from a commercial source (bovine brain; Sigma). We preferred not to touch our data by multiplying the values by a constant factor, expressing them just as they were obtained. Fatty Acid Analysis—The fatty acid composition of SM and Cer was determined by gas chromatography (GC) of their fatty acid methyl ester derivatives. These were prepared by dissolving the lipid samples in anhydrous methanol containing 0.5 n H2SO4 (27Christie W.W. Lipid Analysis.2nd Ed. Pergamon Press, Oxford, UK1982Google Scholar) in Teflon®-lined screw-capped tubes, closing (under N2), and warming the tubes at 45 °C overnight. Methyl heneicosanoate was added as an internal standard for quantitative analysis (2 μg per sample to measure Cer fatty acids). Before GC, the fatty acid methyl esters containing the internal standard were routinely purified by TLC (using hexane/ether, 95:5, by volume) on silica gel G plates that had been previously washed free of contaminants with methanol/ethyl ether (75:25, by volume). The methyl esters were located after spraying the plates with dichlorofluorescein (using N2), scraped into tubes, and recovered by thoroughly mixing the silica support with methanol/water/hexane (1:1:1, by volume), doing three successive hexane extractions. To facilitate and simplify comparisons, the amounts of SM and Cer are expressed on the basis of the weight of their fatty acids alone, with no correction for the sphingoid base in both or the phosphorylcholine weight in SM. The basis of 500 μg of total lipid P was chosen because it is an approximate average value for the amount of phosphorus per gram of tissue for the 4-month-old adult rats used in this study. The VLCPUFA of SM and Cer were identified by procedures and criteria described in detail in previous work for the VLCPUFA of bovine retina rod outer segments (28Aveldanño M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1172-1179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Aveldanño M.I. Sprecher H. J. Chem. Biol. 1987; 262: 1180-1186Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and rat seminiferous tubule total lipids (30Aveldanño M.I. Robinson B.S. Johnson D.W. Poulos A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11663-11669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), including GC mass spectrometry. The spectra of the main VLCPUFA of rat testicular SM and Cer (included in Fig. 2) were obtained using a Hewlett-Packard 6890 GC connected to a 5972 mass spectrometer (hyperbolic quadrupole), equipped with a capillary column (HP5-Ms, 30m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm). Helium (1 ml/min) was the carrier gas, and the fragments were analyzed using an NBS 75 K Hewlett-Packard Mass Spectrometer Chem Station library. For fatty acid composition analysis, a Varian 3700 gas chromatograph and a Varian Star Chromatography Workstation (version 4.51) were used. The instrument was equipped with two (2 mm × 2 m) glass columns packed with 15% SP 2330 on Chromosorb WAW 100/120 (Supelco, Inc., Bellefonte, PA) and two flame ionization detectors, operated in the dual-differential mode. The column oven temperature was programmed from 150 to 230 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min. This final temperature was then held constant for 30–50 min to allow VLCPUFA to emerge from the column (a total of 45–70 min/run). Injector and detector temperatures were 220 and 230 °C, respectively, and N2 (30 ml/min) was the carrier gas. Alternatively, a Varian Star 3400 CX GC, equipped with a flame ionization detector, a split/splitless injector, and a capillary fused silica column from J&W Scientific (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) was used. The column contained a stationary phase similar in polarity to the previous one (DB-23, 0.23 μm thick), and helium (2 ml/min) was the carrier gas. The injector was used in the split mode, with a split ratio 1:100. For the present studies, the capillary column performed well for resolution but the set of packed columns performed better for quantification. No corrections were made for response factors of the flame ionization detector to different fatty acid methyl esters. The fatty acid compositions of SM and Cer were calculated on a weight percent basis. SM and Cer Fatty Acids—In the total lipid from mammalian testis, the most abundant fatty acids have long been known to be saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) with 18 to 22 carbon atoms belonging to the n-6 (18:2n-6, 20:4n-6 and 22:5n-6) or the n-3 (18:3n-6, 20:5n-3, 22:6n-3) series, depending on species. The sum of PUFA with 24–34 carbon atoms, referred to as “VLCPUFA” in this work, amounted to an average of 5% of the fatty acids of the total lipid of testis in the mammals analyzed. Various polar and non-polar lipid classes, including glycerophospholipids, neutral glycerides, and cholesterol esters (31Furland N.E. Maldonado E.N. Aveldanño M.I. Lipids. 2003; 38: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), as well as the sphingolipids of this study, contributed to this total. In all mammals studied, as shown for the rat in Table 1, the amide-bound fatty acids of testicular SM and Cer were the usual saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids with long to very long chains (C16–C24) commonly found in other tissues (saturates, monoenes), small amounts of 18:2n-6 and 24:2n-6 (dienes), and the very long-chain tetraenoic, pentaenoic, and hexaenoic fatty acids having up to 32 or 34 carbon atoms, depending on the species, whose sums are compared in Fig. 1. These data show that the occurrence of these fatty acids was a common characteristic of both sphingolipids, that the amount of VLCPUFA was consistently higher in Cer than in SM, and that the rat was the species with the highest amount of these fatty acids in both lipids.TABLE 1Fatty acid composition of sphingomyelin and ceramide from rat testis and spermatozoaFatty acidSMCer14:00.25 ± 0.070.29 ± 0.1014:10.06 ± 0.030.11 ± 0.0415:00.09 ± 0.030.17 ± 0.1115:10.03 ± 0.010.12 ± 0.0416:036.54 ± 2.6813.94 ± 1.7216:10.37 ± 0.281.33 ± 0.7417:00.80 ± 0.200.46 ± 0.1517:10.09 ± 0.060.33 ± 0.1118:026.02 ± 0.7514.06 ± 1.7618:11.17 ± 0.322.23 ± 0.8419:00.14 ± 0.050.14 ± 0.1118:20.28 ± 0.110.61 ± 0.5120:01.60 ± 0.190.92 ± 0.0820:10.05 ± 0.030.04 ± 0.0421:00.080.0722:03.76 ± 0.414.08 ± 0.4922:10.30 ± 0.040.30 ± 0.0823:00.79 ± 0.160.96 ± 0.1523:10.25 ± 0.050.35 ± 0.1224:04.55 ± 0.5210.58 ± 0.7024:15.22 ± 0.557.26 ± 0.3424:2n-61.48 ± 0.120.71 ± 0.0726:00.000.0824:4n-60.16 ± 0.030.12 ± 0.0324:5n-60.14 ± 0.040.09 ± 0.2625:4n-60.01 ± 0.040.20 ± 0.2025:5n-60.020.08 ± 0.0326:4n-60.18 ± 0.040.29 ± 0.1526:5n-60.08 ± 0.030.09 ± 0.2127:4n-60.20 ± 0.040.17 ± 0.1827:5n-60.080.0528:4n-68.24 ± 0.9019.00 ± 1.7628:5n-60.56 ± 0.102.26 ± 0.6329:4n-60.20 ± 0.020.40 ± 0.0929:5n-60.02 ± 0.020.15 ± 0.0330:4n-60.24 ± 0.030.43 ± 0.0930:5n-64.66 ± 0.4713.39 ± 1.3031:5n-60.36 ± 0.050.21 ± 0.0632:5n-60.93 ± 0.103.90 ± 0.32VLCPUFA16.06 ± 1.6340.84 ± 3.09 Open table in a new tab All animals studied contained different amounts of individual VLCPUFA, although a component common to all was 28:4n-6. Mice contained small amounts of n-3 VLCPUFA, which were virtually absent from rat, whereas cat, dog, and rabbit SM and Cer had relatively higher amounts of n-6 trienes such as 28:3n-6 and were richer in 30:4n-6 than the corresponding lipids from the rat testis shown in Table 1. The bull testicular SM and Cer had VLCPUFA of the n-6 and the n-3 series, 30:6n-3, 32:6n-3, and 34:6n-3 being the major ones. It is interesting to point out that the VLCPUFA of bull testicular SM and Cer were the same as those previously identified as important acyl groups of the phosphatidylcholine present in bovine retina rod outer segments (28Aveldanño M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1172-1179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Aveldanño M.I. Sprecher H. J. Chem. Biol. 1987; 262: 1180-1186Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). In rat, most of the VLCPUFA present in SM and Cer belonged to the n-6 series and had an even number of carbon atoms in their chains, although odd-chain VLCPUFA also occurred (Table 1), as was also observed in other testicular lipids (31Furland N.E. Maldonado E.N. Aveldanño M.I. Lipids. 2003; 38: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The longest VLCPUFA of rat testicular SM and Cer was 32:5n-6, and the most abundant in both lipids were 28:4n-6 and 30:5n-6 (Table 1 and Fig. 2). The mass spectra of these two fatty acids, as methyl esters, are included in Fig. 2. Most of the fragments produced from 28:4 and 30:5 were similar to those formed from 20:4n-6 and 22:5n-6, respectively (not shown), the spectra showing coincidence of over 98% between the two major VLCPUFA of SM and Cer and these two well known, abundant, and ubiquitous fatty acids from rat tissues. In addition, peaks with an m/z ratio of 430 and 456 were observed in the spectra, which coincide with the expected weight of the molecular ion for the methyl esters of 28:4n-6 and 30:5n-6, respectively. One of the solvent systems used for the separation of rat ceramides on TLC plates resolved them into three bands, each showing a different, almost clear-cut, fatty acid composition. The band with the lower Rf contained the major long (C16–C18) chain saturated fatty acids; the middle band had very long (C24) saturated and monounsaturated acyl groups; and the band migrating in front contained most of the VLCPUFA present in testicular Cer (Fig. 2). Analysis of the sphingoid base contained in each band showed that all three had sphingosine as the predominant long-chain base, followed by minor amounts (5%) of sphinganine, indicating that the fatty acids and not the base determined their tendency to separate, suggesting that the fatty acids overrule or hinder the interaction between the relatively polar base and the silanol groups of the support. This TLC behavior is shared by other lipids containing VLCPUFA, including phospholipids, like retina phosphatidylcholine (32Antollini S.S. Aveldanño M.I. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1440-1449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and testicular SM. In all cases the band containing VLCPUFA migrates more than the bands containing other fatty acids. Cellular and Subcellular Distribution of Testicular VLCPUFA-containing SM and Cer—In rat, SM and Cer with VLCPUFA were found to be absent from tissues or cells other than testis and spermatozoa. In the testis, most of the SM and Cer rich in VLCPUFA were contributed by cells located within the seminiferous tubules (Fig. 3), the extratubular cells having SM and Cer with much lower amounts of these fatty acids. A separation of rat seminiferous tubule cells into two fractions containing Sertoli and germ cells showed that the latter were significantly richer in VLCPUFA-containing species of SM and Cer than the former (Fig. 3). This was a good direct indication that cells of the germinal lineage were the main c"

These proteins are all soluble ATP-binding cassette proteins with two N-terminal iron-sulfur clusters. Here we demonstrate that Pixie can be isolated from cells in complex with eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 and ribosomal proteins of the small subunit. In addition, our analysis of polysome profiles reveals that double-stranded RNA interference-mediated depletion of Pixie results in an increase in empty 80 S ribosomes and a corresponding decrease in polysomes. Thus Pixie is required for normal levels of translation initiation. We also find that Pixie associates with the 40 S subunit on sucrose density gradients in an ATP-dependent manner. Our observations are consistent with Pixie playing a catalytic role in the assembly of complexes required for translation initiation. Thus, the function of this soluble ATP-binding cassette domain protein family in translation initiation has been conserved from yeast through to higher eukaryotes.

We recently carried out a genetic interaction screen to identify novel regulators of growth in Drosophila imaginal discs (1Coelho C.M. Kolevski B. Walker C.D. Lavagi I. Shaw T. Ebert A. Leevers S.J. Marygold S.J. Genetics. 2005; 171: 579-614Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Mutations in one of the isolated genes, pixie, have an unusual effect on fly growth that is similar to the effect of mutations in genes encoding ribosomal proteins. For example, weak pixie mutant combinations and some heterozygous ribosomal protein mutants have slender bristles and show developmental delay, yet their final adult body size can be near normal (2Coelho C.M. Kolevski B. Bunn C. Walker C. Dahanukar A. Leevers S.J. Development. 2005; 132: 5411-5424Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 3Lambertsson A. Adv. Genet. 1998; 38: 69-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In addition, pixie and ribosomal protein mutant wing imaginal discs show complex defects in growth and cell survival that vary spatially and temporally (2Coelho C.M. Kolevski B. Bunn C. Walker C. Dahanukar A. Leevers S.J. Development. 2005; 132: 5411-5424Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These and other observations suggested that the impact that mutating pixie has on growth might arise via an effect on translation. Indeed, dsRNAi 2The abbreviations used are: dsRNAi, double-stranded RNA interference; ABC, ATP-binding cassette; eIF, eukaryotic translation initiation factor; EAHX, aminohexanoic acid; CB, cleavage buffer; CaM, calmodulin; CaMBB, calmodulin binding buffer; GST, glutathione S-transferase; TEV, tobacco etch virus; CBP, calmodulin-binding peptide; GTC, GST-TEV-CBP; PDVF, polyvinylidene difluoride; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RpLP, ribosome P antigen; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl) amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; ADP-N-P, non-hydrolyzable version of ATP. -mediated depletion of Pixie reduces global translation (2Coelho C.M. Kolevski B. Bunn C. Walker C. Dahanukar A. Leevers S.J. Development. 2005; 132: 5411-5424Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To understand more about Pixie function and the way in which it affects translation, we have performed a biochemical analysis of its function. Pixie is an exceptionally conserved protein found in all eukaryota and archaea sequenced so far (4Gabaldon T. Huynen M.A. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 930-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). For example, Pixie and yeast Rli1p share 66% amino acid identity, and yeast Rli1p and human RLI have 67% amino acid identity. Pixie belongs to the ABCE subfamily of ABC proteins, which contain two nucleotide-binding domains and two N-terminal iron-sulfur clusters. In contrast to most ABC domain proteins, members of this subfamily do not contain the membrane-spanning domains that would enable them to function as transporters (5Kerr I.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 315: 166-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The human Pixie ortholog RLI, also known as ABCE1, was first characterized via its ability to inhibit the antiviral activity of RNase L (6Bisbal C. Martinand C. Silhol M. Lebleu B. Salehzada T. J.

However, RNase L is only found in mammals, so this function of RLI does not account for its conservation in non-mammalian species (4Gabaldon T. Huynen M.A. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 930-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). More recently, three independent studies have provided evidence that the yeast ortholog of Pixie, Rli1p, associates with translation initiation factors and the 40 S ribosomal subunit and plays a role in both translation initiation and ribosome biogenesis (9Dong J. Lai R. Nielsen K. Fekete C.A. Qiu H. Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42157-42168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 10Yarunin A. Panse V.G. Petfalski E.

Aguilar Netz Balk J. Rotte C. Lill R. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Additional data suggest that the vertebrate and Caenorhabditis elegans RLI orthologs also play roles in translation (12Chen Z.Q. Dong J. Ishimura A. Daar I. Hinnebusch A.G. Dean M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7452-7457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 13Zhao Z. Fang L.L. Johnsen R. Baillie D.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biol. 2005; 12: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These fundamental functions are likely to explain the high conservation of the RLI/Pixie protein family and are consistent with the pixie mutant phenotypes that we have observed in Drosophila (2Coelho C.M. Kolevski B. Bunn C. Walker C. Dahanukar A. Leevers S.J. Development. 2005; 132: 5411-5424Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Translation initiation is a multistep process involving the sequential assembly of various large pre-initiation complexes. First, eIF1, eIF1A, eIF3, eIF5 and the ternary complex, which consists of eIF2 bound to GTP and the initiator tRNAMeti, are recruited to the small 40 S ribosomal subunit to form the 43 S pre-initiation complex. Then, the 40 S subunit binds to the capped 5′-end of mRNAs in a reaction requiring eIF4F, eIF4A, and eIF4B. This complex scans the mRNA and positions itself on the correct initiation AUG codon, thereby forming the 48 S pre-initiation complex. Finally, the eIFs are displaced and the large 60 S ribosomal subunit is recruited in an eIF5B-dependent reaction to generate functional 80 S ribosomes (15Hershey J.W.B. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Herskey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. 2000: 33-88Google Scholar, 16Hinnebusch A.G. Sonenberg N. Herskey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. 2000; (pp. , Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY): 185-243Google Scholar). eIF3 is thought to have multiple functions in translation initiation (17Hinnebusch A.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 553-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). eIF3 can bind the 40 S subunit independently of other eIFs, and several studies in vitro and in yeast have implicated eIF3 in promoting the recruitment of the ternary complex to the 40 S subunit to form the 43 S pre-initiation complex (15Hershey J.W.B. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Herskey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. 2000: 33-88Google Scholar, 16Hinnebusch A.G. Sonenberg N. Herskey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. 2000; (pp. , Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY): 185-243Google Scholar). In addition, a multifactor complex consisting of eIF1, eIF3, eIF5, and the ternary complex has been isolated, which is likely to provide an alternative route for the assembly of the 43 S pre-initiation complex (18Asano K. Clayton J. Shalev A. Hinnebusch A.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2534-2546Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Finally, upon termination of translation, eIF3 is thought to inhibit the assembly of the released 40 S and 60 S subunits into empty 80 S ribosomes lacking mRNA. The association of eIF3 with the 40 S subunit alone does not prevent premature 40 S-60 S subunit assembly, but simultaneous binding of eIF3 and the ternary complex to the small ribosomal subunit does prevent the recruitment of the 60 S ribosomal subunit in the absence of mRNA (16Hinnebusch A.G. Sonenberg N. Herskey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. 2000; (pp. , Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY): 185-243Google Scholar, 19Chaudhuri J.

RNA (N. Y.). 2005; 11: 470-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). eIF3 has a complex multisubunit structure. All eukaryotes possess five core eIF3 components: Tif32p/eIF3-S10/eIF3a, Nip1p/eIF3-S8/eIF3b, Prt1p/eIF3-S9/eIF3c, Tif35p/eIF3S-4/eIF3g, and Tif34p/eIF3-S2/eIF3i, and one loosely associated component, Hcr1p/Adam/eIF3j (yeast/flies/humans) (17Hinnebusch A.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 553-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Mammalian eIF3 has been shown to contain at least seven additional subunits. Although not previously studied, Drosophila has orthologs of all 13 mammalian eIF3 components, indicating that the architecture of fly eIF3 resembles that of mammalian rather than yeast eIF3 (21Mayeur G.L. Fraser C.S. Peiretti F. Block K.L. Hershey J.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 4133-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 22Lasko P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150 (–F56): F51Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). As was mentioned above, the yeast ortholog of Pixie, Rli1p, was recently shown to co-purify with various yeast translation initiation factors, including eIF3 (9Dong J. Lai R. Nielsen K. Fekete C.A. Qiu H. Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42157-42168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 10Yarunin A. Panse V.G. Petfalski E. Dez C. Tollervey D. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 580-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). However, a proportion of the core components of yeast eIF3 is consistently found associated with the 40 S ribosomal subunit, whereas Rli1p was only detected associated with the 40 S subunit under low salt conditions or after cross-linking (9Dong J. Lai R. Nielsen K. Fekete C.A. Qiu H. Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42157-42168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 10Yarunin A. Panse V.G. Petfalski E.

Aguilar Netz Balk J. Rotte C. Lill R. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In addition, Rli1p is less abundant than other eIF3 components (9Dong J. Lai R. Nielsen K. Fekete C.A. Qiu H. Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42157-42168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Together these observations suggest that Rli1p is not a core component of eIF3 and that the binding of Rli1p to the 40 S subunit may be dynamic or regulated (11Kispal G. Sipos K. Lange H. Fekete Z. Bedekovics T. Janaky T. Bassler J. D.J. Aguilar Netz Balk J. Rotte C. Lill R. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In addition to its role in translation initiation, Rli1p has also been shown to play a role in processing of the small and large ribosomal subunits (9Dong J. Lai R. Nielsen K. Fekete C.A. Qiu H. Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42157-42168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 10Yarunin A. Panse V.G. Petfalski E. Dez C. Tollervey D. Hurt E.C.

EMBO J. 2005; 24: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). To characterize the biochemical function of Pixie, we first carried out a tandem affinity purification of recombinant Pixie from cultured Drosophila cells. Like Rli1p, Pixie associates with core components of eIF3 and with ribosomal proteins. Furthermore, depletion of Pixie results in increased numbers of monosomes and fewer polysomes, indicating that Pixie is required for normal levels of translation initiation. These observations led us to characterize more closely Drosophila eIF3 and the role of Pixie and Drosophila eIF3 in translation initiation. We found that, in addition to associating with the 40 S ribosome, the core components of Drosophila eIF3 are found in a high molecular weight complex that may represent eIF3 itself or the Drosophila equivalent of yeast multifactor complex. Whereas a proportion of eIF3 is consistently found associated with the 40 S subunit, the association of Pixie with the 40 S ribosome is dynamic and regulated via its ability to bind ATP. Furthermore, Pixie can associate with the 40 S subunit independently of its interaction with eIF3. Together, our data demonstrate that Pixie interacts with eIF3 and the 40 S ribosome and is required for translation initiation in Drosophila. Cell Culture—Drosophila S2 cells were grown in Schneider medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (complete medium, Invitrogen) at 25 °C. S2 cells were transfected with pDA9-1, pDA9-2, and pDA10-1 (see plasmids below) using a calcium phosphate transfection kit (Invitrogen) or with pDA9-3 using an Effectene transfection kit (Qiagen). Cells stably expressing GTC-Pixie, GTC-PixieΔABC, GTC-PixieE501Q, or the GTC tag alone were selected in medium containing 300 μg/ml hygromycin. For insulin treatment cells were treated with 1 μm bovine insulin in complete medium. Antibodies—Polyclonal rabbit antisera were raised against the Adam (2T) N-terminal peptide: MADDWESAADSEVVIRP-Cys, the eIF3-S10 (5T) N-terminal peptide: MARYTQRPENALKRANEFI-EAHX-Cys (where EAHX corresponds to the aminohexanoic acid spacer), the eIF3-S2 (CT1) C-terminal peptide: Cys-EAHX-RVQTFDSTYFENIFE, the eIF3-S8 (CT2) C-terminal peptide: C-EAHX-KNNQDRQQQQQQQVQTIDEE, the eIF3-S9 (CT1) C-terminal peptide: C-EAHX-DEVDEEIVEFLVKEE, and the RpS25 (NT2 or NT1) N-terminal peptide: MPPKKDAKSSAKQPQKTQKK-EAHX-Cys. All peptides were coupled via their N- or C-terminal cysteines to maleimide-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce) as directed. Polyclonal rabbit antisera were raised against the eIF-2α (2396) N- and C-terminal peptides: SRFYNERYPEIEDVC and CQFDPEKEFNHKGSGA, and the RpS13 (I2) internal peptide: YYKTKSVLPPNWKYE (Eurogentec). Plasmids—The plasmids to express recombinant Pixie or PixieΔABC tagged at the N terminus with glutathione S-transferase (GST) followed by a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site and a calmodulin-binding peptide (CBP) (collectively referred to as “GTC”) was generated in three steps. First, the entire Pixie open reading frame or Pixie lacking the second ABC domain (PixieΔABC), with EcoRV, HindIII, and EcoRI sites inserted before the start codon and with a KpnI site inserted after the start codon was PCR-amplified using the primers 5′-CGATATCGGAAGCTTGAGAATTCGCCACCATGGGTACCTCGC-3′ and 5′-CGCGGCCGCCTAGATTAGCATGCGAATGAACGT-3′ (Pixie) or 5′-CGCGGCCGCCTAGATTAGCATGCGAATGAACGT-3′ (PixieΔABC). The PCR fragments were inserted into pGEM-T (Promega, Madison, WI) giving rise to the pDA3-1 and pDA3-3 plasmids, and the insert DNA sequences were verified. Second, a cassette encoding the GTC tag (23Zachariou A. Tenev T. Goyal L. Agapite J. Steller H. Meier P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6642-6652Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) was subcloned from pCN-GTC tag (gift from Pascal Meier) into pDA3-1 and pDA3-3 using the HindIII and EcoRI restriction sites, thereby generating pDA8-1 and pDA8-2, respectively. Third, N-terminally GTC-tagged Pixie and PixieΔABC were inserted in front of the inducible metallothionein promoter of the pMK33 vector using the unique EcoRV and SpeI restriction sites to generate pDA9-1 and pDA9-2, respectively. GTC-PixieE501Q (pDA9-3) was generated by introducing a point mutation in the second ABC domain of Pixie (G1483C) by three consecutive PCRs. The final PCR fragment was amplified using the primers 5′-CCGGTAACCTCCAACCCGATGG-3′ and 5′-ACTAGTGCGGCCGCTTAGTTGCAGGCTTCGTCCTCCA-3′, which covers a unique BstEII restriction site 5′ of the point mutation, and inserts a SpeI site 3′ of the stop codon, respectively. This PCR fragment was inserted into pCR®2.1-TOPO® (Invitrogen) generating pDA3-5, and the DNA sequence was verified. Finally, the Pixie fragment containing the point mutation was subcloned into pDA9-1 using the unique BstEII and SpeI restriction sites to generate pDA9-3. A control plasmid expressing the GTC tag alone was generated by PCR amplification from the pCN-GTC tag using primers that added a EcoRV and SpeI site in front of the ATG and after the stop codon, respectively. This fragment was subcloned into pMK33 to generate pDA10-1. Tandem Affinity Purification from S2 Cells Expressing Recombinant Pixie—Two-step purifications were performed from 1 × 1010 S2 cells expressing recombinant GTC-Pixie or the GTC tag alone. Cells were lysed in 50 ml of Buffer A (50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 8, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 10 mm NaF, 0.25 mm NaVO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin), and cell extracts were cleared of nuclear and membranous material by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 15 min. In the first purification step, the cleared cell extracts were incubated with glutathione beads (Sepharose-4B, Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4°C. Post incubation, beads were washed three times in 12 ml of Buffer A and three times in Cleavage Buffer (CB; 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Beads were resuspended in 300 μl of CB containing 50 units of TEV protease (Invitrogen) and incubated at 16 °C for 2 h. After the first round of cleavage, the supernatant was recovered and a second round of cleavage was performed at 4 °C overnight. In the second purification step, the supernatants from the two cleavage reactions were pooled and mixed with three volumes of calmodulin (CaM) binding buffer (CaMBB; 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm Mg(CH-3COO), 1 mm imidazole, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol), before incubation with CaM beads (Sepharose-4B, Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 4 h. Subsequently, the beads were washed 6 times in 10 ml of CaMBB and Pixie, and Pixie-associated proteins were eluted in CaM elution buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm Mg(CH-3COO), 1 mm imidazole, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) at 4 °C. Finally, the eluates from the CaM beads were concentrated by centrifugation in Microcon YM-10 concentrators (Millipore) and resolved by SDS-PAGE on 4–12% gradient gels (Invitrogen). Individual protein bands were visualized by Brilliant Blue G-colloidal concentrate (Sigma) staining, cut out, and identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Western Blots—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using 12% gels or 4–12% gradient gels (Invitrogen) and transferred electrophoretically to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore or Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were blocked for 1 h in blocking buffer (LI-COR Biosciences) supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated overnight at 4 °C in the same buffer containing primary antibodies at the following dilutions: anti-eIF3-S2, anti-eIF3-S8, anti-eIF3S-9, anti-eIF3-S10, anti-Adam, anti-eIF-2α, anti-RpS25, anti-RpS13 (1/1000), anti-Pixie (1/5000) (2Coelho C.M. Kolevski B. Bunn C. Walker C. Dahanukar A. Leevers S.J. Development. 2005; 132: 5411-5424Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), anti-eIF4A (a gift from Chris Proud, 1/1000), anti-ribosomal-P antigen (ImmunoVision), and anti-β-tubulin (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, 1/500). Membranes were washed three times in TBS-T (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) or PBS-T (137 mm NaCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, 2.7 mm KCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.4) then probed with secondary antibodies labeled with Alexa Fluor 680 (Molecular Probes) or IRDye™ 800 (Rockland Immunochemicals) diluted 1/6000 in a buffer containing one-third volume of TBS-T or PBS-T, two-thirds volume blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. After washing in TBS-T or PBS-T, bands were detected using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences). Sucrose Gradient Fractionation of S2 Cell Extracts—To generate the data shown in Figs. 4, 5, 6, 7, 5 × 108 S2 cells were treated with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma) for 10 min and lysed in 0.6 ml of 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mg/ml heparin, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml cycloheximide, and RNAguard™ (Amersham Biosciences). Cell debris was removed via centrifugation for 10 min at 13,000 rpm, and extracts were resolved on 7.5–30% sucrose density gradients by centrifugation for 4.5 h at 39,000 rpm at 4 °C using an SW41Ti rotor (Beckman). 600-μl fractions were collected while recording the A254 profile using a single path UV monitor (Amersham Biosciences).FIGURE 6PixieE501Q is constitutively associated with the 40 S ribosomal subunit. A–C, cytoplasmic extracts were prepared as in Fig. 4 from cells expressing GTC-Pixie, GTC-PixieΔABC, or GTC-PixieE501Q, and where indicated 5 mm ADP-N-P was added prior to their resolution on 7.5–30% sucrose gradients for 4.5 h at 39,000 rpm. The second ABC domain of Pixie is required for its association with the 40 S ribosome subunit (A). B, GTC-PixieE501Q expression was induced by addition of 175 μg/ml (Induced + ADP-N-P, panel 3) or 700 μg/ml (Induced, panel 2) CuSO4 for 16 h. A proportion of GTC-PixieE501Q, much like eIF3S-10, is constitutively associated with the 40 S ribosome (B). High levels of GTC-PixieE501Q overexpression (induced by 700 μg/ml CuSO4) do not effect the levels of endogenous Pixie and eIF3-S10 expression or the association of eIF3-S10 with the 40 S subunit (B and C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 7The association of Pixie with the 40 S ribosome subunit is insensitive to eIF3 depletion. A, cytoplasmic extracts were prepared as in Fig. 4, from control and eIF3-S10 dsRNA-depleted S2 cells, then resolved on 7.5–30% sucrose gradients for 4.5 h at 39,000 rpm in the presence or absence of ADP-N-P. A reduction in 40 S ribosomal subunit-bound eIF3 does not affect the ADP-N-P-dependent association of Pixie with the 40 S ribosome subunit. B, immunoblotting confirmed the depletion of eIF-S10 and showed that eIF3-S9 levels are also reduced.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To generate the data shown in Fig. 3, S2 cells were seeded in 35-mm wells at a density of 7 × 105 cells/ml in a total of 3 ml of complete medium/well and treated with dsRNA (25 μg/well) targeting GFP (control), Pixie, or eIF3-S10, for 7–8 (Pixie) or 5 (eIF3-S10) days, and the effectiveness of the dsRNAi-mediated depletion was assessed by immunoblotting. To stimulate growth, cells were starved for 1 h in PBS containing 2 mg/ml glucose (Sigma) and subsequently stimulated in complete media containing 1 μm insulin (Sigma) for 3 h. Cells were then treated with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma) for 10 min, and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from 3 × 107 cells as described above. The cleared extracts were resolved on 7.5–60% sucrose density gradients by centrifugation at 39,000 rpm for 2 h at 4°C using a SW41Ti rotor (Beckman). The A254 profiles were recorded as described above. dsRNA—dsRNA was prepared as described (2Coelho C.M. Kolevski B. Bunn C. Walker C. Dahanukar A. Leevers S.J. Development. 2005; 132: 5411-5424Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Primers contained 5′T7 RNA polymerase-binding sites preceded by a GAA overhang and followed by sense or antisense sequences.

Pixie Associates with eIF3 and Ribosomal Proteins—We used a tandem affinity purification method to identify Pixie-associated proteins from Drosophila cells. Schneider S2 cells were generated that inducibly express recombinant GTC-Pixie (Fig. 1A), under the control of the metallothionein promoter. Treatment of these cells with increasing concentrations of CuSO4 induced increasing levels of GTC-Pixie expression (Fig. 1B), whereas growing the cells in the absence of CuSO4 resulted in low GTC-Pixie expression levels that were comparable with those of endogenous Pixie (Fig. 1B). Thus, all purifications were performed from cells grown in the absence of CuSO4. GTC-Pixie was affinity purified from ∼1 × 1010 S2 cells on glutathione-Sepharose beads, cleaved with TEV protease, then CBP-Pixie and any associated proteins were bound to calmodulin beads, washed, and eluted (see “Materials and Methods”). Control purifications were carried out from cells expressing the GTC tag alone. The final eluates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and individual protein bands were stained with Brilliant Blue G-colloidal concentrate, cut out, and identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Fig. 1C). Two of the identified proteins, eIF3-S10 and Adam, are part of the Drosophila eIF3 complex. Other co-purified proteins could not be identified by mass spectrometry but had sizes that correspond approximately to other eIF3 components (eIF3-S9 and eIF3-S8, marked with an asterisk in Fig. 1C). To allow further characterization of the Drosophila eIF3 complex and the interaction between Pixie and eIF3, anti-peptide antibodies were raised against various Drosophila eIF3 components (see “Materials and Methods”). Subsequent immunoblotting of the GTC-affinity-purified protein complexes confirmed the presence of eIF3-S10, Adam, eIF3-S9, and eIF3-S8 and revealed the presence of another eIF3 core component, eIF3-S2 (Fig. 1D). In contrast, no eIF4A protein was detected. Thus, all eIF3 components tested, but not eIF4A, co-purified with Pixie. Our mass spectrometry analysis also identified two proteins from the small ribosomal subunit, RpS17 and RpS25, which repeatedly co-purified with GTC-affinity-purified Pixie (Fig. 1C). The final Pixie-associated protein identified by mass spectrometry, CG4975, has no identifiable domains and is found only in flies, so it was not studied further. To summarize, by taking a tandem affinity purification approach, we have shown that a metazoan Rli1p ortholog, Drosophila Pixie, associates with eIF3 and ribosomal proteins, consistent with the idea that the"

Uridylylated VPg (VPg-pUpU) is thought to serve as the protein primer for RNA synthesis. VPg-pUpU can be produced in vitro by the viral polymerase, 3Dpol, in a reaction in which a single adenylate residue of a stem-loop structure, termed oriI, templates processive incorporation of UMP into VPg by using a “slide-back” mechanism. This reaction is greatly stimulated by viral precursor protein 3CD or its processed derivative, 3C; both contain RNA-binding and protease activities. We show that the 3C domain encodes specificity for oriI, and the 3D domain enhances the overall affinity for oriI. Thus, 3C(D) stimulation exhibits an RNA length dependence. By using a minimal system to evaluate the mechanism of VPg uridylylation, we show that the active complex contains polymerase, oriI, and 3C(D) at stoichiometry of 1:1:2. Dimerization of 3C(D) is supported by physical and structural data. Polymerase recruitment to and retention in this complex require a protein-protein interaction between the polymerase and 3C(D). Physical and functional data for this interaction are provided for three picornaviruses. VPg association with this complex is weak, suggesting that formation of a complex containing all necessary components of the reaction is rate-limiting for the reaction. We suggest that assembly of this complex in vivo would be facilitated by use of precursor proteins instead of processed proteins.

Picornaviruses are the etiologic agent of numerous diseases of medical and veterinary importance. Poliomyelitis, the common cold, summer flu, hepatitis, and foot-and-mouth disease can all be caused by picornaviruses (1.Racaniello V.R. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Griffin D.E. Lamb R.A.

A protein, VPg (virion protein genome-linked), is covalently linked to the 5′-end of the viral genome, the so-called plus-strand, and a poly(rA) tail is present at the 3′-end (1.Racaniello V.R. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Griffin D.E. Lamb R.A. Martin M.A. Roizman B. Straus S.E. Fields Virology. 4th Ed. Vol. 1. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia, PA2001: 685-722Google Scholar). Genome replication occurs in a process that uses the plus-strand as a template for minus-strand synthesis, which, in turn, is used as a template for production of an excess of plus-strands (2.Paul A.V. Semler B.L. Wimmer E. Molecular Biology of Picornaviruses. 1st Ed. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.2002: 227-246Google Scholar). Initiation of both plus- and minus-strand RNA synthesis is thought to be primed by a uridylylated form of VPg, VPg-pUpU (2.Paul A.V. Semler B.L. Wimmer E. Molecular Biology of Picornaviruses. 1st Ed. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.2002: 227-246Google Scholar). Several years ago, Paul and Wimmer made the paradigm-shifting observation that an RNA stem-loop structure in the 2C-coding region of the poliovirus (PV) genome was capable of templating production of VPg-pUpU (3.Paul A.V.

All picornaviruses have a cis-acting RNA element capable of templating the production of VPg-pUpU, although the position of this element in the genome varies.

The VPg uridylylation reaction can be mimicked in vitro by using purified components: the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (3Dpol); the VPg peptide; (bio)synthetic oriI RNA; UTP; and Mg2+ or Mn2+ (3.Paul A.V.

Wimmer E. Andino R. Melchers W.J. J. Gen. Virol. 2006; 87: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The reaction is also stimulated by a viral precursor protein, 3CD. Protein 3CD has both RNA-binding and protease activities, but only the RNA-binding activity is required for stimulation of the VPg uridylylation reaction (3.Paul A.V. Rieder E. Kim D.W. van Boom J.H. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 10359-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 4.Rieder E. Paul A.V. Kim D.W. van Boom J.H. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 10371-10380Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We have shown that the fully processed viral protein 3C also stimulates VPg uridylylation (19.Pathak H.B. Ghosh S.K. Roberts A.W. Sharma S.D. Yoder J.D. Arnold J.J. Gohara D.W. Barton D.J. Paul A.V. Cameron C.E. J. Biol.

Our previous studies of PV support a model in which 3C(D) binds to oriI and recruits polymerase to oriI (19.Pathak H.B. Ghosh S.K. Roberts A.W. Sharma S.D. Yoder J.D. Arnold J.J. Gohara D.W.

Moreover, we suggested that this recruitment was mediated by an interaction between the thumb subdomain of 3Dpol and some undefined subdomain of 3C (19.Pathak H.B. Ghosh S.K. Roberts A.W. Sharma S.D.

This model was based on the identification of 3Dpol derivatives that contained wild-type polymerase activity on primed RNA templates and retained basal VPg uridylylation activity that could not be stimulated by 3C(D) (19.Pathak H.B. Ghosh S.K. Roberts A.W. Sharma S.D. Yoder J.D. Arnold J.J. Gohara D.W. Barton D.J. Paul A.V. Cameron C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31551-31562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Recently, the suggestion was made that our interpretation of a 3Dpol-3C(D) interaction could also be explained as an allosteric effect unique to the 3Dpol derivatives studied (20.Boerner J.E. Lyle J.M. Daijogo S. Semler B.L. Schultz S.C. Kirkegaard K. Richards O.C. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 7803-7811Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the establishment of a minimal VPg uridylylation system for PV that we use to evaluate the composition, stoichiometry, and functional and structural organization of the active VPg uridylylation complex. Consistent with previous studies (19.Pathak H.B. Ghosh S.K. Roberts A.W. Sharma S.D. Yoder J.D. Arnold J.J. Gohara D.W. Barton D.J. Paul A.V. Cameron C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31551-31562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), PV polymerase is recruited to and retained in the VPg uridylylation complex by a direct, physical interaction with 3C(D) bound to oriI. This conclusion is the same for two other picornaviruses: coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) and human rhinovirus type 14 (HRV14). Targeting of 3C(D) to oriI is mediated solely by the 3C subdomain, the 3D subdomain serves only to increase affinity on oriI and, in doing so, increases the observed specificity of 3CD relative to 3C when oriI is placed in the context of longer RNA sequence. Protein 3C(D) binds to oriI at a 2:1 stoichiometry; 3C dimerizes in solution in the presence and absence of oriI. One of the 3C subdomains of 3C(D) binds to oriI contacting the stem in a position near the loop that would facilitate appropriate positioning of the polymerase. 3C binds to both single- and double-stranded RNA. In the context of oriI, affinity for the two single strands of the stem individually is higher than that for the annealed stem, suggesting an isomerization step after 3C(D)-oriI complex formation. Finally, association of VPg with this complex is weak and is probably rate-limiting for uridylylation. This study provides the most complete view to date of assembly and organization of the picornavirus VPg uridylylation complex.

Cells were chilled to 25 °C and induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 500 μm. Cells were grown for 4 h at 25 °C and harvested. Cell pellets were weighed and stored at –80 °C. Frozen cell pellets were thawed on ice and suspended in lysis buffer (100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, 20% glycerol, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (β-ME), 5.6 μg/ml pepstatin A, 4 μg/ml leupeptin) at a concentration of 4 ml of lysis buffer/g of cell pellet. Cells were homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer; cells were lysed by passing through a French pressure cell at a pressure per square inch of 20,000. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and Nonidet P-40 were added after lysis to final concentrations of 2 mm and 0.1% (v/v), respectively. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation in a Beckman JA-30.50 Ti rotor for 30 min at 24,000 rpm at 4 °C. The clarified lysate was passed over Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid spin columns (Qiagen). The columns were equilibrated prior to loading and washed after loading with buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 10 mm β-ME, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) containing 500 mm NaCl according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Protein was eluted in two 100-μl fractions using buffer A containing 500 mm NaCl and 500 mm imidazole. Protein concentration was determined by using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Conductivities of the fractions were measured, and the fractions were then aliquoted and stored at –80 °C. Purification of PV 3D and PV 3CD-His was described previously (19.Pathak H.B. Ghosh S.K.

Cameron, unpublished results. using oligonucleotides 9 and 10. The purified 51-nt oriI PCR product was linearized using NcoI, and a transcription reaction (40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 32 mm magnesium acetate, 40 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm spermidine, 28 mm NTPs, 25 μg/ml linearized template, and 25 μg/ml T7 RNA polymerase) was performed at 37 °C for 2 h. Magnesium pyrophosphate was removed by centrifugation for 2 min. The supernatant was treated with RQ1DNase (1 unit/μg of template; Promega) for 30 min to remove the template. The RNA was spun through a Micropure-EZ centrifugal filter (Amicon Bioseparations; Millipore) to remove any protein from the RNA according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Two G25 Sephadex (Sigma) spin columns were then used to remove any free nucleotides. The RNA was precipitated with ammonium acetate and suspended in TE (10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA), and RNA concentration was calculated by measuring absorbance at 260 nm. The extinction coefficient was calculated for the 51-nt oriI plus three guanosine residues that are transcribed at the 5′-end of oriI to be 0.627000 μm–1·cm–1 (24.Carroll S.S. Benseler F. Olsen D.B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 275: 365-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These extra nucleotides do not alter the fold of the 51-nt oriI as predicted by the mfold RNA folding server (available on the World Wide Web at www.bioinfo.rpi.edu/applications/mfold/rna/form1.cgi) (25.Zuker M.

The region corresponding to the CVB3 oriI was amplified using oligonucleotides 11 and 12 and the Knowlton CVB3/H3 cDNA as template. The purified oriI PCR product was linearized using XhoI and RNA transcribed as described above. The concentration was measured as described above using the calculated extinction coefficient (0.665700 μm–1·cm–1) that includes two guanosine residues at the 5′-end and a guanosine and adenosine at the 3′-end, a consequence of the XhoI digestion. These extra nucleotides do not alter the fold of the CVB3/H3 oriI as predicted by mfold. The cloning of the HRV14 97-nt oriI is described elsewhere4; cloning of the PV 61-nt oriI was described previously (19.Pathak H.B. Ghosh S.K. Roberts A.W. Sharma S.D. Yoder J.D. Arnold J.J.

Transcription and determination of the concentration for the HRV14 97-nt oriI and the PV 61-nt oriI were done as described above. RNA transcripts from the PV subgenomic replicon, pRLucRA (27.Andino R. Rieckhof G.E. Achacoso P.L. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3587-3598Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 28.Herold J. Andino R. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6394-6400Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), were generated after linearization with ApaI. Transcription reactions, typically 20 μl, consisted of 350 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 32 mm magnesium acetate, 40 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm spermidine, 28 mm NTPs, 0.5 μg of template, and 0.5 μg of T7 RNA polymerase. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h followed by removal of magnesium pyrophosphate. DNase treatment with RQ1DNase (Promega) was used to remove the template; lithium chloride precipitation of the RNA was used to remove unincorporated nucleotides. RNA concentration was calculated by measuring absorbance at 260 nm, assuming that an A260 of 1 was equivalent to 40 μg/ml. RNA transcripts of the PV 2C gene were generated after linearization of pET26Ub-2C plasmid with HindIII. Transcription reactions and RNA quantification were performed as described above. The 29-, 22-, and 14-nt oriIs presented in Fig. 3 were chemically synthesized by Dharmacon, Inc. (Lafayette, CO). Each RNA was deprotected prior to use in the VPg uridylylation assays. Deprotection was done by suspension of the RNA in 500 mm acetic acid and incubation at 65 °C for 15 min, followed by the addition of an equal volume of 660 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and incubation at 65 °C for 15 min. Concentrations were measured as described above. The extinction coefficients used for each are 0.378500 μm–1·cm–1 (29 nt), 0.261100 μm–1·cm–1 (22 nt), and 0.166400 μm–1·cm–1 (14 nt). Footprint Analysis Using an Iodine Cleavage Assay−oriI containing phosphorothioated ATP (ATPαS) and a 5′-OH to be used for footprinting by the iodine cleavage assay was obtained by performing a 1-ml transcription reaction (40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 32 mm magnesium acetate, 40 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm spermidine, 12 mm NTPs, 0.3 mm ATPαS (10% of the total ATP concentration), 8 mm guanosine, 25 μg/ml linearized template, and 25 μg/ml T7 RNA polymerase) at 37 °C for 2 h. Magnesium pyrophosphate was removed by centrifugation for 2 min. The supernatant was treated with RQ1DNase (1 unit/μg of template; Promega) for 30 min to remove the template; two phenol/chloroform extractions followed by a chloroform extraction were performed to deproteinate the RNA. Next, the RNA was precipitated with ammonium acetate and washed with 70% ethanol, and the pellet was suspended in 50% formamide. This provided the starting material for gel purification. The entire volume was loaded onto a 10% acrylamide, 50% formamide gel (18 cm × 24 cm × 2 mm). The gel was run at 25 mA for ∼4 h (the band corresponding to the full-length oriI had migrated to the middle of the gel by this time, as determined by the migration of bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol indicator dyes). The oriI band was excised from the gel by using UV-shadowing using a TLC plate with a fluorescent indicator (PEI Cellulose F; EM Science). The gel piece was cut into tiny squares and placed in an Elutrap electrophoresis chamber (Schleicher & Schuell). The eluted RNA was precipitated with ammonium acetate, washed with 70% ethanol, and suspended in TE. This was then passed over two Sephadex G-25 (Sigma) spin columns. The gel-purified RNA was radiolabeled using [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Inc.). The labeled RNA was gel-purified again following the same procedure described above. RNA quality was assessed by 15% denaturing PAGE. RNA concentration was calculated by measuring absorbance at 260 nm. The extinction coefficient was calculated for the 61-nt oriI plus three guanidine residues that are transcribed at the 5′-end of oriI (0.749400 μm–1·cm–1) as described previously (19.Pathak H.B. Ghosh S.K. Roberts A.W. Sharma S.D. Yoder J.D. Arnold J.J. Gohara D.W. Barton D.J. Paul A.V. Cameron C.E. J. Biol.

The 5′-end-labeled phosphorothioate oriI (3.3 μm) was incubated at 80 °C for 5 min in folding buffer (166 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 66.6 mm NaCl) and then gradually cooled to room temperature for 1 h. At 55 °C, MgCl2 (16.6 mm) was added. The cleavage reaction proceeded as follows. The folded RNA was incubated with varying concentrations of PV 3C-His and incubated at 30 °C for 5 min. To initiate cleavage, 2 μl of 500 μm iodine dissolved in ethanol was added. After incubation at 30 °C for 2 min, the cleavage was quenched with 2 μl of 20 mm dithiothreitol. The final reaction mixture contained 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm NaCl, 1 μm RNA, 0–10 μm protein, 100 μm iodine, and 20% ethanol. An alkaline hydrolysis ladder was generated by incubating the RNA in 50 mm sodium bicarbonate and 3 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, at 90 °C for 5 min. The samples were placed on ice to quench the cleavage reaction. Prior to analysis, an equal volume of 100% formamide was added to each sample. The RNA was denatured at 90 °C for 5 min and placed on ice. The cleavage products were separated on a 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel run at constant power of 90 W. The gel was visualized by using a Typhoon 8600 scanner in the storage phosphor mode and quantified by using ImageQuant software. Fluorescence P"

Here we describe a biological link between WNKs and transforming growth factor (TGF) β-Smad signaling. Both WNK1 and WNK4 directly bind to and phosphorylate Smad2. Knockdown of WNK1 in HeLa cells using small interfering RNA reduces Smad2 protein expression; this decrease is at least partially due to down-regulation of Smad2 transcription. In contrast, phosphorylated Smad2 significantly accumulated in the nucleus as a consequence of depletion of WNK1, resulting in Smad-mediated transcriptional responses.

WNK (with no lysine (K)) family protein kinases gained initial attention because of their unique active site organization; the invariant catalytic lysine in WNK isoforms is contributed from strand β2 (kinase subdomain I) rather than from the conventional location, strand β3 (kinase subdomain II) (1Xu B.

This placement of the catalytic lysine is conserved among WNK orthologs across species, underscoring the functional relevance of this novel position and suggesting a modified catalytic geometry. Importantly, at least two of the four human WNK family members are associated with a hereditary form of hyperkalemic hypertension known as pseudohypoaldosteronism type II (3Wilson F.H.

Consistent with disease association, a rodent model heterozygous for the Wnk1 gene displayed hypotension, implying the haploinsufficiency and dosage sensitivity of WNK1 in blood pressure control (4Zambrowicz B.P.

Evidence is accumulating to suggest that WNKs may regulate membrane kinetics and trafficking of channels and transporters on the cell surface in renal as well as extrarenal tissues (reviewed in Refs. 5Kahle K.T.

Although WNKs appear to serve as molecular switches in salt homeostasis and cell volume control, the underlying mechanisms are still in question. Although WNK1 is an attractive potential target for antihypertensive therapy, its distribution is ubiquitous, ranging from nonpolarized endodermally to polarized epithelially derived cell lines and tissues. In addition, WNK1 transcripts can be detected as early as the preimplantation stage (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/UniGene) and mice in which the WNK1 gene had been disrupted did not survive past embryonic day 13 of gestation (4Zambrowicz B.P.

These observations strongly suggest that WNK1 acts throughout the body and also plays an essential role during animal development. Biochemical studies clearly indicate that WNK1 undergoes diverse interactions in signaling pathways. For example, WNK1 acts upstream in the ERK5 3The abbreviations used are: ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEKK, MEK kinase; TGF, transforming growth factor; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GST, glutathione S-transferase; R-Smad, receptor-activated Smad; MH, Mad homology; Q-PCR, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR; RNAi, RNA interference; PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1. mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and can phosphorylate the MAPK kinase kinases MEKK2 and MEKK3 (7Xu B.

This supports the idea that WNK1 is distantly related to Ste20p and may act as a MAPK kinase kinase kinase. Several studies showed that WNK1 can be phosphorylated by Akt (8Vitari A.C. Deak M.

WNK1 lies downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to activate the serum- and glucocorticoid-induced kinase (SGK1) (10Xu B. Stippec S. Lazrak A. Huang C.-L. Cobb M.H. J. Biol.

WNK1 also phosphorylates and activates oxidative stress-responsive 1/Ste20-related, proline- and alanine-rich kinase (OSR1/SPAK) to regulate ion balance in response to osmotic stress (12Vitari A.C.

The existence of multiple spliced forms of WNK1 adds complexity to its functional regulation, notably in kidney where a kinase-defective form lacking N-terminal residues is enriched (14Xu Q.

Interestingly, partial cDNA clones of WNK1 and WNK2 were isolated from malignant prostate tissues and pancreatic cancer cells, respectively (16Moore T.M. Garg R. Johnson C. Coptcoat M.J. Ridley A.J.

Gene (Amst.). 2005; 344: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, the roles of WNKs in tumorigenesis, if any, are unknown. Signal transduction pathways regulated by transforming growth factor (TGF) β control a diverse array of cellular processes including embryogenesis, proliferation, differentiation, migration, and programmed cell death. Dysregulation of and genetic alterations in ligands and signal transducers within this signaling pathway often cause disease or developmental defects (19Massague J. Blain S.W. Lo R.S. Cell. 2000; 103: 295-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2078) Google Scholar). TGFβ superfamily ligands transduce signals by stimulating the formation of heteromeric complexes of type I and type II serine/threonine kinase receptors. The type II receptor activates the type I receptor by phosphorylating a specific region known as the glycine-serine or GS domain. Activated type I receptors initiate intracellular signaling through activation of specific receptor-activated Smads (R-Smads) and their subsequent binding to the co-mediator Smad to relay signals into the nucleus, where they regulate numerous target genes (20Feng X.H. Derynck R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 659-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar, 21Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Science. 2002; 296: 1646-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar). Signaling from the TGFβ-Smad pathway often plays an antiproliferative role in many cell types, and in that context the receptors and signal transducers act as tumor suppressors (19Massague J. Blain S.W. Lo R.S. Cell. 2000; 103: 295-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2078) Google Scholar). For example, malfunctions in TGFβ receptors have been observed in different types of carcinomas, and a number of mutations in Smad genes have been linked to tumors as well (22de Caestecker M.P. Piek E. Roberts A.B. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 1388-1402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Signaling specificity and versatility are present in the TGFβ signaling pathway through diverse regulatory mechanisms and cross-connections among Smad-dependent and Smad-independent as well as TGFβ-dependent and TGFβ-independent pathways. Phosphorylation of the C-terminal serine residues (e.g. Ser465 and Ser467 in mouse Smad2) in R-Smads by the type I receptor is the most critical event in TGFβ signaling. However, the efficiency, intensity, and duration of TGFβ and Smad signaling are tightly regulated by various mechanisms, including inhibitory Smads, ubiquitin-mediated degradation, phosphorylation by other protein kinase signaling pathways, subcellular compartmentalization, and internalization (20Feng X.H. Derynck R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 659-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar, 23Derynck R. Zhang Y.E.

Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 112-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that dynamic convergence of inputs via individual signaling nodes and concomitant modifications may fine-tune TGFβ-Smad signaling pathways to elicit diverse cellular outcomes. In this study, we investigated the roles of WNK protein kinases in TGFβ-Smad signaling and found that both WNK1 and WNK4 directly bind to one or more R-Smads. Significantly, depletion of WNK1 using siRNA modulated the amounts and effects of Smad2 in both negative and positive manners. These results reveal that the WNK protein kinase pathway is a novel biological link to the regulation of TGFβ-Smad signaling. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—Yeast two-hybrid screens were performed with a neonatal mouse brain cDNA library (gift from M.

From 106 yeast transformants screened with an inactive form of the WNK1 kinase domain (residues 217–494 K233M) as a bait, eight colonies were recovered whose interactions were further confirmed by redelivering isolated prey plasmids into bait-containing L40 host strains. Smad2 cDNAs were encoded in-frame in two of the isolated positive candidates (designated as KD-11-1 and KD-11-2 (26Lee B.H. Min X. Heise C.J. Xu B. Chen S. Shu H. Luby-Phelps K. Goldsmith E.J.

For pairwise interaction tests in yeast, the L40 strain was co-transformed with bait and prey plasmids using Frozen EZ-Yeast Transformation II (Zymo Research) and plated on complete synthetic medium lacking Leu and Trp. Interactions were subsequently tested by growing the co-transformants on complete synthetic medium lacking Leu, Trp, and His and also by performing β-galactosidase assays.

Constructs expressing full-length mouse Smad2, Mad homology (MH) domain 1, MH2, ΔMH1, ΔMH2, and linker (residues 1–467, 1–190, 241–467, 206–467, 1–240, and 180–250, respectively) were generated by PCR-based subcloning using pCS-Madr2 full length as a template. Other Smad clones were created similarly. Site-directed mutagenesis was done with the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All of the constructs and mutants were confirmed by sequencing. Other Reagents—Bacterial expression of glutathione S-transferase (GST) fused to Smad2 was performed as described (27Funaba M. Mathews L.S. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 20: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). WNK1 and WNK4 proteins were expressed as previously described (2Min X. Lee B.H. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Structure. 2004; 12: 1303-1311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Sources of antibodies are as follows: anti-Myc antibody (9E10; the National Cell Culture Center); anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma); monoclonal anti-Smad2/3 antibody (BD Biosciences); polyclonal anti-Smad2, anti-Smad3, and anti-lamin B1 antibodies (Zymed Laboratories); anti-phospho-Smad2 antibody (Ser(P)465/Ser(P)467; Cell Signaling); anti-lactate dehydrogenase A and anti-Smad4 antibodies (Santa Cruz); and anti-retinoblastoma antibody (Abcam). Human TGFβ1 was purchased from R & D Systems. MG132 was from Boston Biochemicals. Cell Culture, Transfection, and siRNA—COS7L, HEK293, and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mml-glutamine, and 100 units/ml of penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. HepG2 cells were grown in minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml of penicillin/streptomycin, and 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids. COS7L, HEK293, and HepG2 cells at 50–80% confluence were trypsinized and immediately transfected with DNAs using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). For siRNA, HeLa cells were transfected with synthetic double-stranded RNA duplexes of 21 nucleotides (Ambion) at ∼50% confluence using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) and incubated for 72 h in the presence of serum before harvest. The cells were treated with 200 pm TGFβ as indicated. The sequences of siRNA duplexes are as follows: human WNK1 oligonucleotides, sense, cagacagugcaguauucacTT, antisense, gugaauacugcacugucugTT, or sense, ggaugauaucgaagagcugTT, antisense, cagcucuucgauaucauccTT; and control (rat OSR1), sense, cuccucuacgagcaguauuTT, antisense, aauacugcucguagaggagTT. Immunoblotting, Immunoprecipitation, and Kinase Assays—The cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaF, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 mm benzamidine, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10.5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysate protein (5–20 μg) was used for immunoblotting. For co-immunoprecipitation, the cells were disrupted in lysis buffer without Nonidet P-40, and 0.5–1 mg of lysate protein was incubated with 1:500 (volume) of anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) and 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 3 h at 4°C. The immunoprecipitates were washed four times with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 7.5 mm MgCl2, and associated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting. For immunoprecipitation and kinase assays, lysates (0.5–1 mg) were incubated with the indicated antibody and protein A-Sepharose beads for 3–4 h. The beads were washed three times with 0.25 m Tris, pH 7.4, 1 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% sodium deoxycholate and once with 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6. Kinase assays with beads, purified recombinant kinases, and indicated substrates were performed in 30 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 10 μm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm benzamidine) containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Transcriptional Assays and Real Time Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR (Q-PCR)—To measure the transcriptional response downstream of endogenous Smad2 in WNK1-depleted cells, HeLa cells were transfected with reporter constructs (ARE-Lux and FAST-1, 3TP-Lux, or the tumor necrosis factor-α promoter-Lux), β-galactosidase, and siRNA oligonucleotides using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After incubating the cells in the presence of serum for 72 h, the luciferase activities were measured using an MLX microtiter plate luminometer (Dynex Technologies), and the values were normalized to β-galactosidase activity (Opsys MR; Fisher). For detecting the effects of overexpression of the WNK1 kinase domain on the transcriptional response of FLAG-Smad2, HEK293 or HepG2 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding ARE-Lux/FAST-1 or 3TP-Lux, Myc-WNK1 (216–491), FLAG-Smad2 full length, and β-galactosidase using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). The total amount of DNA for transfection was adjusted with empty vectors. After 24 h of incubation in serum-containing medium, the cells were treated with 400 pm TGFβ for 8–12 h before harvest and luciferase measurements. Total RNA was extracted from cells using RNA STAT-60 (Tel-Test), and cDNA was prepared with the Superscript™ II RT kit (Invitrogen). Real time Q-PCR measurements of cDNAs from at least three plates/condition were performed using SYBR green dye to measure duplex DNA formation, and all of the reactions were performed in triplicate on an Applied Biosystems Prism 7900HT sequence detection system. The relative amount of mRNA was calculated by the comparative threshold cycle method using cyclophilin as the internal control. Statistical analyses were performed using a Student's t test. The primer sequences for Q-PCR are as follows: human Smad2, 5′-GTGCAGAGCCCCAATTGTAAT-3′ and 5′-CAGCCTGGTGGAATTTTACACA-3′, or 5′-AGAGAGTTGAGA CACCAGTTTTGC-3′ and 5′-ATAGTCATCCAGAGGCGGAAGTT-3′; human TGFβ1, 5′-TGCTGAGGCTCAAGTTAAAAGTG-3′ and 5′-TGAGGTATCGCCAGGAATTG-3′; human PAI-1, 5′-CACAAATCAGACGGCAGCACT-3′ and 5′-CATCGGGCGTGGTGAACTC-3′. Statistical analyses were performed using Student's t test. Subcellular Fractionation—HeLa or COS7L cells transfected with siRNA oligonucleotides or plasmids were treated with sorbitol or TGFβ, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and harvested in hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm KCl) with protease inhibitors as above. After swelling for 10 min, the cells were passed through a 22-gauge needle ∼30 times followed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was further clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 30 min, yielding a cytosolic fraction. The pellet was resuspended in hypertonic extraction buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.42 m NaCl, and 2.5% glycerol) with protease inhibitors and incubated on ice for 1 h. The nuclear extract was obtained by sedimenting the insoluble material at 100,000 × g for 30 min. 3–8 μg of each fraction was used for immunoblotting. Immunofluorescence—To localize proteins, siRNA-transfected HeLa cells were grown on coverslips at 1 × 105 cells/35-mm well and treated with 200 pm TGFβ for 10 min. Coverslips were rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin. Primary antibodies were co-incubated for 2 h at 1:250 (polyclonal anti-WNK1 Q256) and for 8 h at 1:200 (monoclonal anti-Smad2/3 antibody). The images were obtained with a 60× objective on a Zeiss Axiovert 200M inverted microscope equipped with the 860002 version 2 JP4 filter set (Chroma Technology) and a Cooke SensicamQE 12 bit charge-coupled device camera. Data collection and analyses were done with SLIDEBOOK 4.0 software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations). The exposure times for all of the images were kept constant, and the images were normalized to a fixed gray scale. Additional Methods—Phosphorylation sites were identified by the UT Southwestern core facility as described with some modifications (26Lee B.H. Min X. Heise C.J. Xu B. Chen S. Shu H. Luby-Phelps K. Goldsmith E.J. Cobb M.H. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 741-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). For phosphate labeling, WNK1-depleted HeLa cells were incubated with phosphate-free medium containing 0.22 mCi/ml [32P]phosphate (MP Biomedicals) for 3 h and treated with sorbitol for 30 min. The lysates were then subjected to immunoprecipitation with the polyclonal anti-Smad2 antibody. The proteins were resolved by electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. For quantifying protein amounts, immunoblotting was performed using ECL plus Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences), and the intensities of fluorescent intermediates were measured by scanning membranes with the FLA-5100 Image Scanner (FUJIFILM). WNK1 and WNK4 Directly Interact with R-Smads—Yeast-based screening of a neonatal mouse brain cDNA library with an inactive form of the WNK1 kinase domain as the bait identified two cDNA clones encoding Smad2 (designated as KD-11-1 and KD-11-2 (26Lee B.H. Min X. Heise C.J. Xu B. Chen S. Shu H. Luby-Phelps K. Goldsmith E.J. Cobb M.H. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 741-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar)), a signal transducer in the TGFβ signaling pathway. The Smad2 cDNA inserts contained the intact MH2 domain, a linker region, and approximately one-third of the MH1 domain (Fig. 1A). Smad2 is not known as a common false positive in yeast two-hybrid screening. Smad2 showed reproducible binding to the WNK1 bait after being reintroduced into yeast. The interaction between WNK1 and Smad2 was weaker than that previously described between WNK1 and synaptotagmin 2 (26Lee B.H. Min X. Heise C.J. Xu B. Chen S. Shu H. Luby-Phelps K. Goldsmith E.J. Cobb M.H. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 741-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Smad proteins fall into three subfamilies: R-Smads, co-mediator Smads, and inhibitory Smads. R-Smads, Smads 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8, specifically interact with and are phosphorylated by type I TGFβ receptors. Subsequently, activated R-Smads recruit the co-mediator Smad Smad4 to form heteromeric complexes that enter the nucleus to regulate target genes. In contrast, the inhibitory Smads, Smad6 and 7, are negative regulators (28Massague J. Seoane J. Wotton D. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2783-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1927) Google Scholar). To verify the interactions among WNKs and Smads, we generated full-length or nearly full-length clones of Smads1, 2, 3, and 4 as well as truncated forms of Smad2 in a yeast two-hybrid vector. Pairwise interaction tests demonstrated that the WNK1 kinase domain bound to TGFβ/activin receptor-activated Smads, Smad2 and 3, but not to the bone morphogenetic protein receptor-regulated Smad Smad1 or to Smad4, indicating binding specificity. Our mapping results further showed that the MH2 domain is required for WNK1 binding to Smad2 (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, the kinase domain of WNK4 also bound to Smad2 in a similar manner, and this observation contrasts with previous analysis of synaptotagmin 2, another WNK1 interactor, which does not bind to WNK4 (26Lee B.H. Min X. Heise C.J. Xu B. Chen S. Shu H. Luby-Phelps K. Goldsmith E.J. Cobb M.H. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 741-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The ability of Smad2 to bind both WNK1 and WNK4 suggests that it is a common target for both WNK1- and WNK4-mediated signaling pathways. To exclude the possibility that Smad2 may promiscuously bind to Ste20p-related protein kinases, we also tested the interaction of Smad2 with the Ste20p family members, TAO2 and OSR1. Neither of these kinases directly associated with Smad2 (data not shown). We further established the interaction between WNK1 and Smad2 by co-transfection and co-immunoprecipitation. Myc-WNK1 fragments (residues 216–491 and 180–555) were co-expressed with full-length FLAG-Smad2 in COS7L cells. These proteins co-immunoprecipitated using antibody to the FLAG tag for pull down (Fig. 1B). TGFβ treatment had little influence on their binding, suggesting that the interaction is ligand-independent (Fig. 1C). However, we were unable to detect the endogenous association of WNK1 and Smad2. WNK1 and WNK4 Phosphorylate Smad2 in Vitro—Phosphorylation of the C-terminal SXS motif in Smad2 by the type I receptor is a crucial event in the canonical TGFβ-Smad2 signaling pathway. However, other protein kinases clearly cross-talk with TGFβ-Smad signaling by phosphorylating Smads or being phosphorylated by the TGFβ receptor (24Moustakas A. Heldin C.H. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 3573-3584Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). Other protein kinases that phosphorylate Smads include receptor tyrosine kinases, ERK1/2, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, protein kinase C, MEKK1, and stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (29Kretzschmar M.

To determine whether Smad2 is a substrate for WNK1 and WNK4, we performed in vitro kinase assays with full-length and truncated forms of GST-Smad2. All of the Smad2 proteins tested were phosphorylated by recombinant WNK1 and WNK4 kinase domains (Fig. 2A). Consistent with this observation, endogenous WNK1 immunoprecipitated from COS7L cells was able to phosphorylate recombinant Smad2 proteins, whereas there was no phosphorylation by protein extracted with preimmune serum (Fig. 2B and data not shown). More than one site was phosphorylated in Smad2 by WNKs. Following phosphorylation by WNK1, Smad2 became immunoreactive with the anti-phosphorylated Smad2 (Ser(P)465/Ser(P)467) antibody (Fig. 2C). From the mass spectrometric analyses, three phosphorylation sites (Ser110 from MH1 domain and Ser260 and Ser465 from MH2 domain) were identified (Fig. 2D, top panel, and data not shown). Phosphorylation on Ser465 is presumed to account for the cross-reactivity of WNK1-phosphorylated Smad2 by the anti-phospho-Smad2 (Ser(P)465/Ser(P)467) antibody. Serine residues are conserved in positions that align with Ser110 and Ser465 in Smad1 and 3 but not at the position comparable with Ser260, which is only found in Smad2. The contribution from individual phosphorylation sites was examined by mutagenesis and subsequent in vitro kinase assays. Phosphorylation of Smad2 S465A was drastically reduced (∼40% of wild type), although there is little or no change in S110A and S260A mutants (Fig. 2D, bottom panel). These findings suggest tha"

The receptor for IL-7 is heterodimeric, consisting of a common γ chain (γc, encoded by Il2rg) and an α subunit (IL-7Rα, encoded by Il7r). The Il7r gene is expressed specifically in the immune system in a developmental stage-specific manner. It is not known how the Il7r gene is transcriptionally regulated during B cell development. The goal of this study is to elucidate the function of the Il7r promoter region in developing B cells. Using a combination of 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends analysis, transient transfection assays, and DNase I hypersensitivity mapping, we identified the location of the Il7r promoter. Using a combination of electrophoretic mobility shift analysis, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, and RNA interference experiments, we found that the Ets transcription factors PU.1 and GA-binding protein (GABP) activate the Il7r promoter by interacting with a highly conserved Ets binding site. In committed B lineage cells, GABP can promote Il7r transcription in the absence of PU.1. However, the results of retroviral gene transfer experiments suggest that PU.1 is uniquely required to initiate transcription of the Il7r locus at the earliest stages of progenitor B cell generation.

The receptor for IL-7 (IL-7R, encoded by Il7r) is heterodimeric, consisting of an IL-7-specific α chain (IL-7Rα) and a common γ chain (γc, encoded by Il2rg), which is shared with other subunits comprising the receptors for IL-2, IL-4, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21. The Il2rg gene is expressed by all hematopoietic cells (5Kondo M. Ohashi Y. Tada K. Nakamura M. Sugamura K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 2026-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Transcription of the Il7r gene is initiated in common lymphoid progenitor cells (6Kondo M. Weissman I.L. Akashi K. Cell. 1997; 91: 661-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1673) Google Scholar). IL-7Rα is expressed in developing B cells but is down-regulated upon B cell maturation (7Sudo T.

In human patients, mutations in the IL7RA gene cause a type of severe combined immunodeficiency in which the major deficiencies are in T cell development, whereas B and NK cells are relatively normal in number (15Giliani S. Mori L. de Saint Basile G. Le Deist F. Rodriguez-Perez C. Forino C. Mazzolari E. Dupuis S. Elhasid R. Kessel A. Galambrun C. Gil J. Fischer A. Etzioni A. Notarangelo L.D. Immunol.

Dynamic regulation of IL-7Rα may be important for the generation of appropriate immune responses. Therefore it is important to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which Il7r transcription is regulated. Little is known about how the Il7r gene is regulated during B cell development. The Ets transcription factor PU.1 (encoded by the gene Sfpi1) is required to activate Il7r transcription during murine fetal liver hematopoiesis (16DeKoter R.P. Lee H-J. Singh H. Immunity. 2002; 16: 297-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). However, PU.1 is also required to generate B cell progenitors (17Medina K.L. Pongubala J.M. Reddy K.L. Lancki D.W. Dekoter R. Kieslinger M. Grosschedl R. Singh H. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 607-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Therefore it is unclear whether PU.1 is required to maintain Il7r transcription after cell commitment to the B cell lineage. Several recent studies demonstrate that conditional deletion of the Sfpi1 gene in committed B lineage cells does not result in loss of IL-7Rα expression (18Polli M. Dakic A. Light A. Wu L.

Furthermore, ectopic expression of the COE family (Collier/Olf/EBF) transcription factor EBF (Early B cell factor) can activate Il7r transcription and differentiation into pro-B cells in progenitor cells lacking PU.1 (17Medina K.L.

The mechanism by which Il7r transcription is maintained in developing B cells in the absence of PU.1 is unknown. The goal of this study was to elucidate the function of the Il7r promoter region in developing B cells. To accomplish this goal, we determined the location of the Il7r promoter using 5′ RACE, transient transfection analysis, and DNase I hypersensitivity analysis. Using a combination of EMSA, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and RNA interference experiments we found that a conserved Ets transcription factor binding site in the Il7r promoter region can be alternatively utilized by PU.1 or another Ets factor, GA-binding protein (GABP), in developing B cells. Activity of the Il7r promoter is dependent on the Ets site as well as on downstream initiator consensus sequences. In addition, we found that PU.1 is uniquely required to initiate transcription of the Il7r locus at the earliest stages of B cell progenitor cell generation. However, once the Il7r gene is activated, GABP can promote Il7r transcription in the absence of PU.1. These results suggest that Il7r transcription is regulated by both PU.1 and GABP in developing B cells. 5′ RACE Analysis—RNA was prepared from 38B9 pro-B cell lines, IL-7-dependent fetal liver-derived pro-B cells, and sorted peripheral T cell subsets including CD4+ naiöve T cells, CD8+ naiöve T cells, CD4+ memory T cells, and CD8+ memory T cells. 5′ RACE analysis was performed using a GENERACER kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The Il7r exon 1-specific reverse primer used was 5′-GCGAAAGCTCTACCCAGAGCCAT-3′. PCR products were gel-purified and cloned using the pCR-TOPO2.1 cloning kit (Invitrogen). At least 5 clones were sequenced from each cell type analyzed. Reporter Vector Construction—All DNA constructs generated in the course of this study were constructed using standard molecular genetic approaches. Details of the construction of each vector are available upon request. Unless indicated otherwise, all reporter vectors utilized the pGL3-basic luciferase vector (Promega). In all approaches using PCR to clone DNA segments, LA-TAQ (TaKaRa, Otsu, Shiga, Japan) DNA polymerase was used to amplify regions of interest. Site-directed mutagenesis of the Il7r promoter was performed using the QuikChange XL kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To mutate the Ets site core sequence from GGAA to CGAC, complementary oligonucleotides were synthesized and high pressure liquid chromatography purified (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville IA) as follows: forward 5′-CAATCCTTTTGCTCAGACGTCGTGTTTCTGGCACTTGC-3′, reverse 5′-GCAAGTGCCAGAAACACGACGTCTGAGCAAAAGGATTG-3′. The oligonucleotides used to mutate putative initiator sequences were: –120 (forward 5′-CTGTGGTTTAGCAGGGGCGGAGCTGGTTTGGGTC-3′, reverse 5′-GACCCAAACCAGCTCCGCCCCTGCTAAACCACAG-3′), and –90 (forward 5′-GGGTCTCCCTCTCTCTGGTGCACTTGCACATACAACCG-3′, reverse 5′-CGGTTGTATGTGCAAGTGCACCAGAGAGAGGGAGACCC-3′). All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Transient Transfection Analysis—220-8, 38B9 (21Alt F. Rosenberg N. Lewis S. Thomas E. Baltimore D. Cell. 1981; 27: 381-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), EL4, and RAW264.7 cell lines were maintained in complete medium containing RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen), 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan UT), 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine, 5 × 10-5 m β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5 mm HEPES buffer. For 38B9 and EL4 cells, 4 × 106 cells were electroporated with 10 μg of plasmid DNA and 200 ng of pRL-TK vector (encoding Renilla luciferase) using 220 V and 950 microfarad settings in a 4-mm gap electroporation cuvette (ISC Bioexpress). RAW264.7 cells (105/condition) were transfected using 200 ng of plasmid DNA and 4 ng of pRL-TK vector using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Luciferase activity was determined after 24 h of culture using a Dual Luciferase assay kit (Promega). All transient transfection data reported in this study are the mean ± S.D. or S.E. of at least three separate experiments performed in duplicate. EMSA—Nuclear lysates were obtained from cultured cells using standard methods. In vitro translations were performed using a coupled transcription/translation kit (Promega). DNA binding reactions and acrylamide gel electrophoresis were performed as previously described (22Schweitzer B.L. Huang K.J. Kamath M.B. Emelyanov A.V. Birshtein B.K. DeKoter R.P. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 2195-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Antibody supershift analyses were performed by adding 1 μl of anti-PU.1 (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz CA), anti-GABPα, or anti-GABPβ1 (gifts from Warren Leonard). 1 μl of normal rabbit serum was used as a control in antibody supershift experiments. Probes used were annealed fully complementary double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the wild type Il7r Ets site (5′-AAACAGGAAGTCTG-3′), a mutant Il7r Ets site (5′-AAACACGACGTCTG-3′), or an E2A binding site (5′-TACATCTGTGCAGTTCGCTG-3′). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—38B9 or WEHI-231 cells in log phase growth were fixed for 10 min at room temperature by adding formaldehyde (1% final) with gentle rocking. Crosslinking was stopped by the addition of glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 m. Chromatin solutions with a mean DNA fragment size of 0.5–1.0 kb were prepared as previously described (16DeKoter R.P. Lee H-J. Singh H. Immunity. 2002; 16: 297-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Chromatin from 1 × 107 cells was incubated at 4 °C with 15 μl of anti-GABPα (Santa Cruz) or anti-actin (Sigma) antibodies for 16 h, followed by addition of Salmon Sperm DNA/Protein A-agarose gel slurry (Upstate, Charlottesville VA) for 1 h. Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation, washed three times in RIPA buffer, and eluted with Elution Buffer (50 mm NaHCO3, 1% SDS). Cross-linking was reversed by adding NaCl (0.3 m final) for 4 h at 65 °C. The resulting solution was treated with RNase A for 20 min at 37 °C and Proteinase K for 16 h at 37 °C. DNA was purified using the Wizard SV Gel and PCR Purification System (Promega) and analyzed by semiquantitative PCR (30–35 cycles) with primer pairs identifying the Il7r and Hprt1 gene promoters (16DeKoter R.P. Lee H-J. Singh H. Immunity. 2002; 16: 297-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). RNA Interference Experiments—220-8 pro-B cells were electroporated as described above with 20 μg of pBS/U6 expression vector as a control, or 20 μg of pBS/U6 expression vectors encoding short hairpin RNAs directed against GABPα (23Xue H.H. Bollenbacher J. Rovella V. Tripuraneni R. Du Y.B. Liu C.Y. Williams A. McCoy J.P. Leonard W.J. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 1036-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), as well as 1 μg of pEYFP-N1 to enable selection by cell sorting. EYFP-positive cells were isolated by cell sorting 60 h after transfection, and gene expression in these cells were assessed by real-time PCR as previously described (23Xue H.H. Bollenbacher J. Rovella V. Tripuraneni R. Du Y.B. Liu C.Y. Williams A. McCoy J.P. Leonard W.J. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 1036-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). For inducible RNA interference experiments, an oligonucleotide containing a previously described small interfering RNA (5′-AGAAGACAGAAGTTCACCG-3′) (23Xue H.H. Bollenbacher J. Rovella V. Tripuraneni R. Du Y.B. Liu C.Y. Williams A. McCoy J.P. Leonard W.J. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 1036-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) directed against the coding region of GABPα was adapted as a microRNA by ligation into the tetracycline-regulated retroviral vector SIN-TREmi30-PIG (TMP) (Open Biosystems, Huntsville, AL) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Retrovirus was prepared as described below and used to infect 38B9 pro-B cells. Infected cells were enriched by cell sorting for GFP expression. To express the reverse tetracycline transactivator protein, 38B9 cells or sorted 38B9-TMP-GABPα cells were infected with pRevTet-ON retrovirus (Clontech) and selected by culture in 0.8 mg/ml G418 (Mediatech, Herndon, VA). To induce expression of the microRNA directed against GABPα, 38B9 + pRevTet-ON, or 38B9 + pRevTet-ON + TMP-GABPα cells were cultured with 2 μg/ml doxycycline (Sigma) for 72 h. At 72 h total RNA was prepared to measure GABPα expression, or flow cytometric analysis was performed to measure IL-7Rα expression. DNase I Hypersensitive Site Mapping—DNase I treatment was performed as described in Ref. 24Lefevre P. Lacroix C. Tagoh H. Hoogenkamp M. Melnik S. Ingram R. Bonifer C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27552-27560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar. Following DNA extraction, 10 μg of DNA for each sample was digested with EcoRI or ScaI to completion and separated by electrophoresis on an 0.8% agarose gel in TAE followed by Southern blot analysis. Probe 1 (+4569 bp to +4688 bp) and probe 2 (-6556 bp to 5992 bp) were used for Southern blot analysis. Antibodies and Flow Cytometry—Single cell suspensions were stained with phycoerythrin or biotin-conjugated antibodies and streptavidin-phycoerythrin or streptavidin-allophycocyanin secondary reagents. Propidium iodide (Invitrogen) was used to exclude dead cells from analysis. Anti-mouse monoclonal antibodies utilized in this study were M1/70-biotin (CD11b, BD Pharmingen), 1D3-phycoerythrin (CD19, BD Pharmingen), and A7R34-biotin (IL-7Rα). Flow cytometric analysis was performed on a BD Immunocytometry systems FACScalibur dual-laser instrument. Cell sorting and green or yellow fluorescent protein (GFP or YFP) analysis was performed on a FACSVantage instrument with FACSDiva upgrade (BD Immunocytometry Systems). Construction and Generation of Retroviruses—We have previously described the construction of the MSCV-IRES-GFP (MIG)-PU.1 retrovirus (16DeKoter R.P. Lee H-J. Singh H. Immunity. 2002; 16: 297-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). MIG-GABPα was constructed by ligation of a FLAG-tagged GABPα cDNA (provided by Dr. Alan Rosmarin) into the MIGR1 retroviral vector EcoRI restriction site (25Pear W.S. Miller J.P. Xu L. Pui J.C. Soffer B. Quackenbush R.C. Pendergast A.M. Bronson R. Aster J.C. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Blood. 1998; 92: 3780-3792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and was confirmed by sequence analysis. GABPβ1 cDNA was amplified from EL-4 mRNA using RT-PCR with gene-specific primers, and cloned into the pCR-TOPO 2.1 vector (Invitrogen). After confirmation by DNA sequencing, GABPβ1 cDNA was ligated into the EcoRI restriction site of a retroviral vector (MIYR1) in which enhanced GFP (EGFP) had been replaced with EYFP (Clontech). Plat-E retroviral packaging cells (26Morita S. Kojima T. Kitamura T. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1063-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar) were maintained in complete Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen). Plat-E cells were transiently transfected with retroviral vectors using Lipofectamine reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen). Retrovirus-containing supernatants were collected 48 h after transfection by centrifugation. To confirm protein expression, lysates of transfected Plat-E cells were prepared on the day of virus collection using Laemmli buffer according to standard protocols. Lysates were electophoresed on 10% polyacrylamide denaturing gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a Trans-Blot SD apparatus (Bio-Rad). Membranes were probed using anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma), or anti-GABPβ1 (gift of Dr. Warren Leonard) antibodies. Protein bands were visualized using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse antibodies (Pierce) and the SuperSignal West Pico kit (Pierce) before exposure to x-ray film. Retroviral Transduction and Culture of Fetal Liver Progenitors—Lineage-depleted wild type or Sfpi1-/- fetal liver progenitor cells were generated by negative selection of day 14.5 fetal liver cells with immunomagnetic beads as previously described (27DeKoter R.P. Singh H. Science. 2000; 288: 1439-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). For infections, 105 Lin- progenitors were mixed with 1 ml of retrovirus-containing supernatant, 1 ml of complete Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium, and 16 μg of Polybrene, and then centrifuged in flat-bottom 24-well plates (Greiner Bio-One, Monroe, NC) for 2 h at 3100 × g. At the end of the centrifugation, infected progenitors were cultured in 20 ng/ml IL-3, 100 ng/ml SCF, and 10 ng/ml IL-6 in complete Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium (Hyclone). After 48 h of culture, the infection frequency was measured by flow cytometric analysis of an aliquot of cells for GFP or YFP fluorescence. Infected progenitors were placed into culture with irradiated S17 stromal cells and IL-7-conditioned medium as previously described (16DeKoter R.P. Lee H-J. Singh H. Immunity. 2002; 16: 297-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Cultures were incubated for 9–11 days before counting and flow cytometric analysis for cells expressing CD11b, CD19, and IL-7Rα. Functional Identification of the IL-7Rα Promoter—To investigate transcriptional regulation of the Il7r gene, it was necessary to clarify the promoter region that is functional in developing B cells. We previously reported that Il7r promoter constructs incorporating a published transcription start site (at position –946 relative to the translation start codon (28Pleiman C.M. Gimpel S.D. Park L.S. Harada H. Taniguchi T. Ziegler S.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3052-3059Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) had undetectable activity in transient transfection experiments (16DeKoter R.P. Lee H-J. Singh H. Immunity. 2002; 16: 297-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). We therefore performed 5′ RACE with RNA from B cell lines that express high levels of IL-7Rα including 38B9 pro-B cells and IL-7-dependent fetal liver derived pro-B cell lines. In addition, we prepared 5′ RACE products from sorted naiöve (TCRβ+ CD44-) or memory (TCRβ+ CD44hi, day 40 post-LCMV infection) peripheral T cells, from both CD4+ and CD8+ peripheral compartments (29Hildeman D. Yanez D. Pederson K. Havighurst T. Muller D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9672-9678Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PCR was performed on RACE products using a forward RACE-specific primer and a reverse Il7r primer located in exon 1 of the cDNA (Fig. 1A). Two major groups of PCR products were detected in each tissue examined (Fig. 1B) that were gel purified, cloned, and sequenced to determine the transcription start site(s). Each cell type examined displayed an identical pattern of transcription start sites. Three sites were identified more frequently than others: a site at –120 (relative to the translation start site) was found in 39% (13/33) of clones, a site at –90 was found in 21% (7/33) of clones, and a site at –86 was found in 15% (5/33) clones (Fig. 1C). No PCR products were obtained using a gene-specific primer proximal to a previously described –946 bp transcription start site (28Pleiman C.M. Gimpel S.D. Park L.S. Harada H. Taniguchi T. Ziegler S.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3052-3059Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the major transcription start sites in the Il7r gene are within 120 bp upstream of the open reading frame. To determine which promoter region is functional in B cells we cloned various DNA segments into the pGL3 luciferase vector to perform transient transfection analysis. The 38B9 pro-B cell line (21Alt F. Rosenberg N. Lewis S. Thomas E. Baltimore D. Cell. 1981; 27: 381-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) was chosen for transient transfection analysis because it expresses high levels of both PU.1 and IL-7Rα mRNA transcripts and protein (data not shown). Of the various constructs transfected into 38B9 cells, the –925 promoter had the highest activity (Fig. 1D). The activity of the promoter was significantly reduced by deletion of the conserved region (-160). Activity of the promoter was reduced but not eliminated by removing two of the major transcription start sites located at –86 and –90 (–2058 to –99); this was consistent with the evidence for multiple transcription start sites. Finally, a construct resembling one used in the original description of the Il7r promoter (–2058 to –940), which ends at a HincII restriction site (28Pleiman C.M. Gimpel S.D. Park L.S. Harada H. Taniguchi T. Ziegler S.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3052-3059Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), had activity below background levels, consistent with our lack of detection of transcription initiating in this area. In summary, transient transfection analysis suggests that the Il7r promoter is located in a region between –925 and the transcription start sites. The –925 promoter was therefore used in subsequent experiments. An Intact Ets Site Is Essential for Activity of the Il7r Promoter in B and T Cells—To identify regulatory sites crucial for regulation of the Il7r promoter, we first performed sequence comparisons using the ClustalW algorithim. The Il7r gene has been annotated in genomes sequenced from human (Homo sapiens), chimp (Pan troglodytes), dog (Canis familiaris), rat (Rattus norvegicus), mouse (Mus musculus), pufferfish (Fugu rubripes), and green spotted puffer (Tetraodon nigroviridis). Alignment of the promoter region revealed that a ∼108-bp block of sequence was highly conserved in every one of these species (Fig. 2A). This conserved block of sequence contains a previously identified Ets binding site (the sequence ACAGGAAGTC, which was 100% conserved in each species examined. This conserved sequence block appears at a similar position (∼150 bp upstream of the open reading frame) in the Il7r gene from each species examined. There was no measurable sequence identity upstream or downstream of this region, including at the transcription start sites (data not shown). The high degree of sequence identity between species in this region suggests that it is likely to be functionally important across multiple species. We then aimed to test whether the Ets site is required for activity of the –925 Il7r promoter. The Ets site core sequence was mutated from GGAA to CGAC using site-directed mutagenesis. The activity of the mutant –925 construct was then tested by transient transfection analysis in 38B9 pro-B cells and in EL4 T cells (Fig. 2C). In 38B9 pro-B cells, mutation of the Ets site reduced activity of the –925 promoter by over 90% (Fig. 2C, top two bars). The Il7r –925 promoter construct also had significant activity when transiently transfected into the EL4 T cell line, which does not express PU.1 (data not shown). Mutation of the Ets site reduced activity of the –925 promoter by over 80% in EL4 T cells (Fig. 2C, bottom two bars). This result confirms previous findings that the Ets site is essential for activity of the Il7r promoter in T cells (23Xue H.H. Bollenbacher J. Rovella V. Tripuraneni R. Du Y.B. Liu C.Y. Williams A. McCoy J.P. Leonard W.J. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 1036-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 30Lee H.C. Shibata H. Ogawa S. Maki K. Ikuta K. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 7800-7806Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In summary, these results show that the Ets binding site is required for activity of the Il7r promoter in both B and T cells. These results suggest that an Ets family transcription factor other than PU.1 interacts with this site in T cells. The three most frequent transcription start sites in the Il7r promoter initiate at CA dinucleotide sequences, which is a common feature of initiator sequences. In fact, the start site at –90 (Fig. 1C) has the initiator consensus sequence TCATTC (31Smale S.T. Kadonaga J.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 449-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that function of the Il7r promoter utilizes interactions between the Ets binding site and initiator sequences, a combination that has been previously described (32Garraway I.P. Semple K. Smale S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4336-4341Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 33Yu M. Yang X.Y. Schmidt T. Chinenov Y. Wang R. Martin M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997"
https://openalex.org/W1982278586,"Heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF), a member of the EGF family, is synthesized as a type I transmembrane precursor (pro-HB-EGF). Ectodomain shedding of pro-HB-EGF yields an amino-terminal soluble ligand of EGF receptor (HB-EGF) and a carboxyl-terminal fragment (HB-EGF-CTF) consisting of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. We previously showed that the HB-EGF-CTF translocates from the plasma membrane to the nucleus and plays a role as a signaling molecule. Immunoprecipitation showed that HB-EGF-CTF can associate with Bcl6, a transcriptional repressor in mammalian cells. A glutathione S-transferase pulldown assay revealed that HB-EGF-CTF interacted efficiently with zinc fingers 4–6 of Bcl6. A luciferase reporter assay showed that the nuclear translocation of HB-EGF-CTF following shedding reversed transcriptional repression of cyclin D2 by Bcl6. Additionally, the level of cyclin D2 protein increased and Bcl6 interaction with the cyclin D2 promoter decreased in parallel with the shedding of pro-HB-EGF at all endogenous levels. These findings suggest that HB-EGF-CTF is a potent regulator of gene expression via its interaction with the transcriptional repressor Bcl6.

The Bcl6 protein is a 92- to 98-kDa nuclear phosphoprotein that is produced at low levels in multiple tissues and is expressed at high levels exclusively in germinal center B cells (25Cattoretti G.

Bcl6 is highly conserved among vertebrate species, and the mouse and human Bcl6 proteins are 94% conserved (27Allman D. Jain A. Dent A. Maile R.R. Selvaggi T. Kehry M.R. Staudt L.M. Blood. 1996; 87: 5257-5268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bcl6 contains a BTB/POZ domain in the amino terminus and six Kruöppel-type (C2H2) zinc finger (ZnF) motifs in the carboxyl terminus. The BTB domain of Bcl6 autonomously represses transcription by recruiting various co-repressors, including SMRT, NCoR, BCoR, and class I or II histone deacetylases (28Huynh K.D. Bardwell V.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2473-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 29Huynh K.D. Fischle W. Verdin E. Bardwell V.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1810-1823PubMed Google Scholar). The ZnF motifs of Bcl6 bind to the consensus core sequence TTCCT(A/C)GAA found in several Bcl6 target genes (30Dent A.L. Vasanwala F.H. Toney L.M. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 2002; 41: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These target genes are cyclin D2, CD69, and MIP-1α (31Shaffer A.L. Yu X. He Y. Boldrick J. Chan E.P. Staudt L.M. Immunity. 2000; 13: 199-212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). PLZF contains two functional domains: (i) an amino-terminal self-interacting BTB/POZ domain and (ii) a carboxyl-terminal domain containing multiple Kruöppel-like C2H2 ZnFs, which mediate binding DNA and HB-EGF-CTF binding. Bcl6 and PLZF have similar domain structures and amino acid sequences, suggesting that Bcl6 may functionally interact with HB-EGF-CTF. Our study was, therefore, directed at whether HB-EGF-CTF interacts with and regulates Bcl6. To accomplish this, we characterized the properties of HB-EGF-CTF as a transcriptional regulator. Our results indicate that HB-EGF-CTF interacts with Bcl6 and reverses the transcriptional repression of the cyclin D2 gene expression by Bcl6. Our results also suggest that HB-EGF-CTF acts as a regulator of cell growth.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies—The mouse anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M2), the anti-cyclin D2 monoclonal antibody (DCS-3), and the anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody (AC-15) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The mouse anti-Bcl6 monoclonal antibodies (D-8 and C-19) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against synthetic peptides corresponding to the cytoplasmic region of pro-HB-EGF (#H1) and the extracellular region of pro-HB-EGF (#H6) have been described previously (32Miyagawa J.

Rabbit and mouse normal IgGs were obtained from IBL.Expression Vectors—The expression vector for the cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)-tagged Bcl6 (CFP-Bcl6) was constructed by inserting human Bcl6 cDNA into the BglII and SalI sites of the pECFP-C1 vector (Clontech). The full-length Bcl6 and a series of their truncated regions were cloned into the BglII and XhoI sites of modified pME18S vector (pME18S-FLAG) (17Nanba D. Mammoto A. Hashimoto K. Higashiyama S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 489-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Glu-627, Glu-655, and both in the linker region of Bcl6 ZnF 4–6 were mutated to Ala to construct three mutants, E627A (m1), E655A (m2), and E627A/E655A (m3).

Wild-type and stably transfected HT1080 cells were grown in Eagle’s minimum essential medium (Nikken Biomedical Laboratory) supplemented with 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen), 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Lot AGN19241), penicillin, and streptomycin sulfate. Human colorectal adenocarcinoma LoVo cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Nikken Biomedical Laboratory) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin sulfate. Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The cells were treated with 100 nm TPA in each culture medium for each individual time.Preparation of Cell Extracts—Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS(–)) and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (PBS(–) containing 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2 mm p-amidinophenyl methanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin). Cell lysates were mixed by end-over-end rotation for 30 min at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 9100 × g for 10 min. The resulting supernatants were used as cell extracts.Immunoprecipitation—Cell extracts of LoVo cells and HT1080/AP-HB-EGF cells transfected with FLAG-tagged full-length Bcl6 (amino acid residues 1–706) were incubated with an antibody to cyclin D2 (DCS-3), the cytoplasmic region of pro-HB-EGF (#H1), or Bcl6 (D-8) for 2 h at 4°C with end-over-end rotation. Protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads (Amersham Biosciences) were then added to the mixture. After a 2-h incubation at 4 °C with mixing, the suspension was centrifuged, and the collected protein G-Sepharose beads were washed three times with lysis buffer. The bound proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using an anti-cyclin D2 antibody (DCS-3), an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M2), or an anti-Bcl6 antibody (D-8), followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using an AEC substrate kit (Vector Laboratories, Inc.) or the ECL Plus Western blotting Detection system (Amersham Biosciences).Imaging of CFP Fusion Proteins—Transiently transfected cells expressing CFP-Bcl6 cDNA were cultured for at least 12 h in serum-free medium to decrease endogenous HB-EGF and its shedding. The cells were then used to examine the subcellular localization of CFP-Bcl6 proteins by fluorescence microscopy (IX70, Olympus).Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—GST and GST-HB-EGF-CTF were produced in and purified from Escherichia coli strain BL21. Protein expression was induced by treatment with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 30 °C. The cells were then transferred to a centrifuge tube, collected by centrifugation, washed once with ice-cold PBS(–), frozen at –80 °C for at least 1 h, resuspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm MgCl2, and 100 μg/ml lysozyme) by repeated pipetting, and incubated on ice for 10 min. The mixture was then adjusted to 5 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors (Pefablock SC (Roche Applied Science) and aprotinin) were added. The solution was adjusted to 1% N-laurylsarcosine and then vortexed and sonicated on ice using a UR-20P sonicator (Tomy Seiko Co., Ltd.). After sonication, the lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were transferred to new tubes, and the solution was adjusted to 2% Triton X-100. The lysates were vortexed, and glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added. After mixing by end-over-end rotation for 30 min at 4 °C, the beads were washed five times with PBS(–) and resuspended in storage buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% v/v glycerol).GST Pulldown Assay—Extracts from HT1080 cells expressing various FLAG-tagged Bcl6 mutants were mixed with 2 μg of recombinant GST or GST-HB-EGF-CTF immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4°C by end-over-end rotation. After washing the beads, the bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting using an anti-FLAG antibody (M2), followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using the ECL Plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences). The binding abilities of the Bcl6 ZnF 4–6 E/A mutants (m1–3) were estimated by the efficiency of pulldown, which was calculated by using the ratio of each band intensity (lane 2) in a pulldown assay panel to the corresponding band intensity in a cell lysate panel.Luciferase Reporter Assay—Plasmids encoding the human cyclin D2 promoter-driven luciferase reporter gene and its mutant (pGL3-wt cyclin D2 promoter and pGL3-mut cyclin D2 promoter) were constructed by inserting the PCR-amplified promoter fragment of cyclin D2 (nucleotides –1560 to –4) or its mutated fragment (three base mutations; see Fig. 4A and Ref. 31Shaffer A.L.

Vector pRL-TK (Promega) was used as an internal control. Wild-type and stably transfected HT1080 cells (5 × 104) were transiently transfected with luciferase reporter plasmids using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen). After a 24-h culture, cells were treated with 100 nm TPA, and promoter activities were analyzed using the DualGlo™ luciferase assay system (Promega). These assays were repeated at least three times, and firefly luciferase (cyclin D2 promoter) activities were normalized by the Renilla luciferase (internal control) activities.siRNA—The siRNAs for the knockdown of Bcl6 (siBcl6-1 and siBcl6-2, CUGCGUCAUGCUUGUGUUAUA and AACCUUAGUGUGAUCAAUCUA) were designed by and obtained from Qiagen. The siRNAs for the knockdown of HB-EGF (siHB-EGF, AGCUCUUUCUGGCUGCAGU) and a scrambled siRNA (GCGCGCUUUGUAGGAUUCG), used as a negative control, were obtained from Dharmacon Research, Inc. The scrambled sequence did not correspond to any mammalian sequence in the NCBI date base. HT1080 and LoVo cells were transfected with 100 nm siRNA, after which the mRNA and protein levels were examined by RT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively.RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from the cells using TRIzol® (Invitrogen), and first-strand cDNA was synthesized using Superscript II (Invitrogen). PCRs for Bcl6 were performed using the following primer pair: 5′-GATGAGATTGCCCTGCATTT-3′ (sense) and 5′-TTCTTCCAGTTGCAGGCTTT-3′ (antisense).Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—LoVo cells cultured at 5 × 106 cells per 100-mm culture dish containing 10 ml of growth media were either treated with 100 nm TPA for 1 h or not treated. After adjusting to a final formaldehyde concentration of 1% (w/v), the cells were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C, followed by the addition of glycine to 0.136 m and incubated for 10 min. After washing with cold PBS(–), the cells were sonicated in lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). The supernatant was cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g and diluted nine times with dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 167 mm NaCl). DNA shearing was controlled by running part of the sonicated chromatin on an agarose gel to ensure that the fragmented DNA is 200–100 bp. To preclear the chromatin solution, 50 μl of a 50% (v/v) slurry of Protein G-agarose/salmon sperm DNA (Upstate) was added to the rest of the sample. After incubation with agitation for 30 min at room temperature, the beads were removed by centrifugation at 5,000 × g, and the supernatant, of which 1/100th was retained as an input control, was collected. The retrieved supernatant was incubated with either an anti-Bcl6 antibody, C-19 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or an isotype control antibody (IBL) for 2 h at room temperature with rotation in the presence of 50 μl ofa 50% (v/v) slurry of Protein G-agarose/salmon sperm DNA (Upstate). The beads were then sequentially washed with low salt buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl), high salt buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 500 mm NaCl), LiCl buffer (0.25 m LiCl, 1% IGEPAL-CA630, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), and then twice with TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA). The immunoprecipitated DNA (or the input control) was extracted with 200 μl of elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3), and then 8 μl of 5 m NaCl was added, followed by incubation at 65 °C overnight to reverse the cross-links. The DNA was purified with a Qiagen Nucleotide Removal kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol and then used in a PCR reaction. PCRs were then performed on the purified DNA with BIOTAQ (BIOLINE) in the presence of 2.5 mm MgCl2 at 60 °C for 30 cycles. The sequences of the primers used for the PCR were as follows: 5′-ATGCCTCCGGGGAAAGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-AAAAACCCGCTTCCTCG-3′ (antisense). Analysis of the PCR products was performed on a standard 2% agarose gel by electrophoresis in Tris acetate-EDTA buffer.RESULTSHB-EGF-CTF Binds the ZnF Region of Bcl6—To analyze the interaction between HB-EGF-CTF and Bcl6 in mammalian cells, FLAG-tagged Bcl6 (FLAG-Bcl6 as shown in Fig. 1B) were transfected into HT1080 cells stably expressing AP-tagged pro-HB-EGF (HT1080/AP-HB-EGF). Antibodies against the cytoplasmic region of pro-HB-EGF (#H1) immunoprecipitated AP-tagged pro-HB-EGF (Fig. 1A, lower) and an ∼90-kDa band from the cell lysates. This corresponds to FLAG-Bcl6, indicating that HB-EGF-CTF physically interacts with Bcl6 (Fig. 1A, upper).FIGURE 1HB-EGF-CTF interacts with Bcl6. A, FLAG-tagged full-length Bcl6 (FLAG-Bcl6) was transiently expressed in HT1080/AP-HB-EGF cells and then immunoprecipitated using an antibody against the cytoplasmic region of HB-EGF (#H1) or normal rabbit IgG. Western blotting was carried out using an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (upper) and #H1 (lower). B, schematic representation of Bcl6 and its deletion mutants, Bcl6 (amino acids 1–706), BTB+Center (amino acids 1–518), and ZnF (amino acids 519–706). All of the recombinant proteins were expressed as FLAG-tagged (black box) fusion proteins. C, recombinant GST-tagged HB-EGF-CTF pulled down Bcl6 and its mutants from crude extracts. Recombinant GST (lane 1) or GST-HB-EGF-CTF (lane 2) was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated with crude extracts of HT1080 cells expressing FLAG-tagged Bcl6 or its mutants. Western blotting was carried out using an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody. Left, analysis of crude extracts. Right, analysis of the precipitated proteins. D, shedding of pro-HB-EGF does not effect the localization of Bcl6. HT1080 cells (a and b) and HT1080/AP-HB-EGF cells (c and d) were transiently transfected with Bcl6 tagged with CFP (CFP-Bcl6). The subcellular localization of the CFP-Bcl6 protein was visualized by fluorescence microscopy before (a and c) or after treatment with TPA for 60 min (b and d). CFP-Bcl6 showed a discrete pattern of punctate staining in the nucleus. Treatment with TPA for 60 min did not affect the subcellular localization of CFP-Bcl6 in either HT1080 or HT1080/AP-HB-EGF cells. Bar, 5 μm. E, effect of TPA on the shedding of pro-HB-EGF in HT080/AP-HB-EGF cells. Shedding was examined by Western blotting with the #H1 antibody and by measurement of AP activity in the conditioned medium according to previously described methods (8Tokumaru S. Higashiyama S.

Western blotting with an anti-FLAG antibody showed that GST-HB-EGF-CTF, but not GST alone, bound to Bcl6 (Fig. 1C). Bcl6 has two characteristic domains: an amino-terminal BTB domain and a carboxyl-terminal C2H2 ZnF domain. We determined which domain is responsible for the interaction with HB-EGF-CTF using two deletion mutants of Bcl6 (BTB+Center and ZnF, Fig. 1B). Extracts from cells expressing these deletion mutants were incubated with GST-HB-EGF-CTF-immobilized glutathione-Sepharose beads. A large fraction of ZnF and a detectable level of BTB+Center were pulled down by GST-HB-EGF-CTF but not by GST alone (Fig. 1C). These data indicate the ZnF domain mediates the interaction with HB-EGF-CTF.We have previously shown that some of the PLZF is translocated to the cytoplasm subsequent to the shedding of pro-HB-EGF (17Nanba D. Mammoto A. Hashimoto K. Higashiyama S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 489-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Here, we investigated whether the localization of Bcl6 is affected by the production of HB-EGF-CTF in HT1080 and HT1080/AP-HB-EGF cells. HT1080 cells, which express a very low level of endogenous pro-HB-EGF (26Onizuka T. Moriyama M. Yamochi T. Kuroda T. Kazama A. Kanazawa N. Sato K. Kato T. Ota H. Mori S.

Lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycan are essential for bacterial cell wall biosynthesis, and chitin is necessary for fungal cell wall biosynthesis (1Holtje J.V. Schwartz U. Nanninga N.

UDP-GlcNAc is also used as the N-acetylglucosamine moiety of N-linked glycosylation and the glycosylphosphoinositol anchor of eukaryotic proteins (5Herscovics A. Orlean P. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 540-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, UDP-GlcNAc is synthesized from fructose-6-phosphate via glucosamine-6-phosphate, glucosamine-1-phosphate, and N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate (GlcNAc-1-P) 2The abbreviations used are: GlcNAc-1-P, N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate; UAP, UDP-GlcNAc pyrophosphorylase; CaUAP1, UAP from C. albicans;PPi, pyrophosphate; GlmU, N-acetylglucosamine-phosphate uridyltransferase; EcGlmU, GlmU from E. coli; SpGlmU, GlmU from S. pneumoniae; DTT, dithiothreitol; PDB, Protein Data Bank. in prokaryotes, whereas it is synthesized via glucosamine-6-phosphate, N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate, and GlcNAc-1-P in eukaryotes (6Mio T.

UDP-GlcNAc pyrophosphorylase (UAP) is a key enzyme of the UDP-GlcNAc biosynthesis that synthesizes UDP-GlcNAc from uridine-5′-triphosphate (UTP) and GlcNAc-1-P in the cell cytoplasm. UAP catalyzes the following reversible reaction, GlcNAc-1-P + UTP ↔ UDP-GlcNAc + PPi. The reaction proceeds as an SN2 reaction (Fig. 1B) (10Sheu K.F. Frey P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3378-3380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Kostrewa D. D'Arcy A. Takacs B. Kamber M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The non-esterified oxygen of the phosphate group of GlcNAc-1-P attacks the α-phosphate of UTP, and the β- and γ-phosphate groups are released as a pyrophosphate. The enzyme generally requires divalent cations such as magnesium ions (12Bulik D.A. Lindmark D.G. Jarroll E.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 95: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). UAP is essential for UDP-GlcNAc biosynthesis in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Prokaryotic and eukaryotic UAPs are not similar in the amino acid sequence, however, except for a “nucleotide binding motif” (L/M)X2GXGTX6PK (6Mio T. Yabe T. Arisawa M. Yamada-Okabe H. J. Biol.

The enzyme acetylates glucosamine-1-phosphate, in addition to converting GlcNAc-1-P to UDP-GlcNAc (Fig. 1A). The crystal structures of GlmU have been determined from Escherichia coli (EcGlmU) (14Brown K. Pompeo F. Dixon S. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Cambillau C. Bourne Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4096-4107Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 15Olsen L.R. Roderick S.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1913-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (SpGlmU) (11Kostrewa D. D'Arcy A. Takacs B. Kamber M. J. Mol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 11844-11851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The crystal structure consists of two domains, i.e. the pyrophosphorylation and acetylation domains. In contrast to GlmU, the prokaryotic UAP enzyme, eukaryotic UAP enzymes do not catalyze the acetylation of glucosamine-1-phosphate. Eukaryotic UAPs are divided into two groups, mammalian UAPs and non-mammalian UAPs. The crystal structures of mammalian UAPs have been determined in humans (17Peneff C. Ferrari P. Charrier V. Taburet Y. Monnier C. Zamboni V. Winter J. Harnois M. Fassy F. Bourne Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6191-6202Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and Mus musculus (Protein Data Bank (PDB) 1VM8). These UAPs consist of three domains, a pyrophosphorylation domain and two other domains whose functions are unknown. Foldings of the pyrophosphorylation domain are similar in enzymes of prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and they are also homologous to that of the structures of the SpsA GnT I core (SGC) superfamily (17Peneff C. Ferrari P. Charrier V. Taburet Y. Monnier C. Zamboni V. Winter J. Harnois M. Fassy F. Bourne Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6191-6202Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 18Charnock S.J. Davies G.J.

Members of the superfamily are nucleotide-binding proteins, some of which possess the nucleotide binding motif. Non-mammalian UAPs have similar amino acid sequences to those of mammalian UAPs, although they lack a loop region, namely the “insertion loop,” of more than 10 amino acid residues (Fig. 2). Because all known crystal structures of mammalian UAPs are dimers, the insertion loop region intrudes into the active site of another molecule and contacts the ligand inside (17Peneff C. Ferrari P. Charrier V. Taburet Y. Monnier C. Zamboni V. Winter J. Harnois M. Fassy F. Bourne Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6191-6202Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). These contacts may not be observed in solution, because it is known that this enzyme functions as a monomer (17Peneff C. Ferrari P. Charrier V. Taburet Y. Monnier C. Zamboni V. Winter J. Harnois M. Fassy F. Bourne Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6191-6202Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In contrast to mammalian UAPs, non-mammalian UAPs are expected to exist as a monomer in their crystal structures where the active site takes an insertion loop-free conformation because they possess no extra loop. Non-mammalian UAP structures are useful for characterizing the catalytic reaction mechanisms of eukaryotic UAPs, but to date the crystal structures of non-mammalian UAPs have not been determined. Candida albicans is a fungus responsible for candidiasis (21Rogers T.J. Balish E. Microbiol. Rev. 1980; 44: 660-682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). UAP from C. albicans, CaUAP1, is a 54.7-kDa protein identified as a homolog of UAP from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (6Mio T. Yabe T. Arisawa M. Yamada-Okabe H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14392-14397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The sequence identity between CaUAP1 and human UAP, AGX1, is 40%, and the active site residues that accommodate UDP-GlcNAc are almost identical (Fig. 2). We have determined the crystal structures of CaUAP1 in its ligand-free form and in complex with its substrate or with its product. Here, we discuss each step of the reaction on the basis of the crystal structures of CaUAP1. In the present study, we elucidated the roles played in these structures by metal ions. The present findings were suggestive of a novel catalytic mechanism for eukaryotic UAPs. Expression, Purification, and Crystallization of CaUAP1—The CaUAP1 gene was cloned into a pGEX-2T plasmid (Amersham Biosciences) and was expressed in JM109 cells as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein (6Mio T. Yabe T. Arisawa M. Yamada-Okabe H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14392-14397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Methods of expression, purification, and crystallization were described previously (22Maruyama D. Nishitani Y. Nonaka T. Kita A. Fukami T.A. Mio T. Yamada-Okabe H. Yamada-Okabe T. Miki K. Acta Crystallograph Sect. F Struct. Biol. Crystallogr. Commun. 2006; 62: 1206-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). CaUAP1 crystallized in an apo-like form (Complex-1, see Table 1) was purified in a manner that differed slightly from our previously described method. Namely, Superdex 75 16/60 column (Amersham Biosciences) chromatography was applied instead of use of a GSTrap column (Amersham Biosciences) for the final chromatography step; the protein was prepared in gel filtration buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and 5% (v/v) glycerol and was then applied onto the column. All purified protein was analyzed with SDS-PAGE, and the purity achieved exceeded 90%.TABLE 1Preparation conditions for co-crystallization and the obtained crystal state of the complexes for UAP and the substrate or productComplex-1 (apo-like)Complex-2 (substrate binding)Complex-3 (reaction-completed)Complex-4 (product binding)Concentration of the co-crystallized molecule (mm)GlcNAc-1-P1101UTP10UDP-GlcNAc10No. of co-crystallized molecules/CaUAP1 molecule observed in the crystalGlcNAc-1-P1UTPUDP-GlcNAc11SO42−-111SO42−-211 Open table in a new tab 10 mg/ml CaUAP1 with its ligands was prepared in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm DTT and co-crystallized under the condition of 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.5-6.0, 20-30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 6000, 80-120 mm ammonium sulfate, and 5-15% (v/v) glycerol. The co-crystallized ligands are summarized in Table 1. Their crystals grew to ∼0.05 × 0.05 × 0.3-5 mm (rod shape) or 0.05 × 0.2 × 0.3 mm (plate shape) at 20 °C within a week. Data Collection, Structure Solution, and Refinement—Diffraction data were collected at beamlines at the Photon Factory, Tsukuba, Japan and at SPring-8, Hyogo, Japan (Table 2). All datasets were collected at 95 K from flash-frozen crystals. The crystallization precipitant was used as a cryoprotectant. All images were indexed and integrated using the program HKL2000 (23Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab Enzyme Assay—For removing metal ions, CaUAP1 were dialyzed against chelating buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT). The buffer was replaced with the stock buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT). For using enzyme assay, the buffer was exchanged to 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, in order to reduce the EDTA concentration, and the protein was concentrated to 10 μm. The substrates (2 mm GlcNAc-1-P and 2 mm UTP) and the protein (0.25 μm) were mixed with the assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), and 20 μl of mixture were incubated for 16 h on ice. The amount of the magnesium ion was adjusted by the addition of MgCl2 (0.025, 0.13, 0.25, 0.50, 1.0, and 2.5 μm) or EDTA (1 mm). Some samples were incubated with 0.25 μm CaCl2 or 0.25 μm ZnCl2 to research the effect of the other divalent cation. To detect the product (UDP-GlcNAc), the reaction mixtures were separated by thin layer chromatography. They were loaded on a silica gel 60 F254 plate (Fluka), which was developed with mixtures of 80 ml of 1-propanol, 9 ml of acetic acid, 11 ml of 5 m lithium chloride solution, and 80 ml of H2O. The separated compounds on the plate, UDP-GlcNAc and UTP, were detected with UV light. The enzymatic activity was measured by the amount of produced UDP-GlcNAc and remaining UTP, which was estimated with the spot size. Overall Structure of CaUAP1—We have determined CaUAP1 structures in four different forms, which we designated as apo-like (Complex-1), substrate binding (Complex-2), reaction-completed (Complex-3), and product binding (Complex-4) forms (Table 1). They were refined at 1.9, 2.3, 2.3, and 2.3 Å resolution, respectively. Other crystallographic statistics are summarized in Table 2. Overall structure of CaUAP1 is shown in Fig. 3A. All crystal structures of CaUAP1 do not form dimers like AGX1 and AGX2, and thus the crystal structures appear to reflect the active monomeric structure of this enzyme in solution. CaUAP1 consists of three domains, N-terminal, central, and C-terminal domains (Fig. 3A). The N-terminal domain is unique to the eukaryotic UAP. This domain consists of three α-helices in the N terminus and two anti-parallel β-sheets inserted to the central domain. The central domain is the catalytic domain of UAP and is referred to as the pyrophosphorylation domain, adopting an α/β-fold resembling the Rossmann fold (32Rossmann M.G. Lijas A. Branden C.-I. Bansazak L.J. Boyer P.D. The Enxymes. Vol. 11. Academic Press, New York1975: 61-102Google Scholar), which consists of eight strands sandwiched by eight helices. The C-terminal domain consists of short β-strands and a long α-helix connected to the central domain. Ser-216 was mutated to leucine due to the difference of codon usage in the host cell and C. albicans. This mutation does not appear to affect the enzymatic activity, as this residue is far from the active site (Fig. 3A). In the case of Complex-2, the nucleotide binding motif in one of the two crystallographically independent molecules was not built because these residues were highly disordered. Ligand Binding of CaUAP1—The ligand molecules are located in the active site, at the bottom of the large cleft between the N-terminal and central domains (Fig. 3A). In the apo-like form structure, no ligand molecules can be located in the active site, because the electron density for the ligand is very weak and unclear (Fig. 3B). GlcNAc-1-P is found at the active site in the substrate binding form (Fig. 3C). UDP-GlcNAc is found at the active site in the reaction-completed and product binding forms (Fig. 3, D and E). Complex-3 was co-crystallized with both GlcNAc-1-P and UTP, and therefore they were converted into the product while preparing or crystallizing the sample (reaction-completed form), whereas Complex-4 (co-crystallized with the product) is a product binding form. The co-crystallized molecules and the ligands in the crystal structures are summarized in Table 1. The binding networks of CaUAP1 with its ligands are shown in Fig. 4. Residues of Asn-227, Gly-294, Glu-309, Tyr-310, Asn-335, and Lys-421 interact with GlcNAc-1-P in the substrate binding form and also GlcNAc-1-P moiety in the reaction-completed and product binding forms (Fig. 4A). The uridine group is bound to residues of Met-109, Gly-111, Gly-112, Gln-199, and Gly-226 in the reaction-completed and product binding forms (Fig. 4B). Residues of Arg-116, Tyr-310, and Lys-421 coordinate to the phosphate groups (Fig. 4, C and D). Lys-421 interacts with both the α- and β-phosphate groups of UDP-GlcNAc in the reaction-completed form (Fig. 4C), whereas it does not interact with the α-phosphate group in the product binding form (Fig. 4D). The position of the α-phosphate group in the product binding form differs from that in the reaction-completed form. Because the reaction-completed form is considered to reflect the reaction state and the α-phosphate group of UDP-GlcNAc is a part of UTP, Lys-421 of CaUAP1 is expected to bind to the α-phosphate group of UTP. One or two sulfate ions were also identified in the substrate binding, reaction-completed, and product binding forms (Table 1). One sulfate (SO42--1) exists at the active site in the reaction-completed and product binding forms. It binds to residues of Thr-115 and Arg-116 (Fig. 4E), and this site is positively charged. The other sulfate (SO42--2) binds to residues of Arg-285, Lys-321, and Arg-332 in the substrate binding and reaction-completed forms (Fig. 4F). These three residues are located at a different site from the active site and form the basic pocket. Induced Fit Movement—Binding of GlcNAc-1-P triggers transformation from the apo-like form into the substrate binding form (Fig. 5A). By comparing the two structures, Loops-B and -C and the N-terminal domain move to close the entrance to the active site (Fig. 5A). The two loops, which have no atomic contacts with other molecules in the crystals, make contact with GlcNAc-1-P at Gly-294, Glu-309, and Tyr-310 (Fig. 5E). On the other hand, the change of the space groups in the present crystal structures seems to cause the movement of the N-terminal domain because the N-terminal domain does not have atomic contacts directly with GlcNAc-1-P but with the other CaUAP1 molecules in the crystals. However, because a linker between the N-terminal and central domains (Asn-227) comes into direct contact with GlcNAc-1-P (Fig. 4A), it is possible that binding the GlcNAc-1-P drives the N-terminal domain movement. The substrate binding form is transformed into the reaction-completed form by binding of UTP and condensing GlcNAc-1-P with UTP (Fig. 5B). Loop-A, which consists of the nucleotide binding motif, makes contact with the uridine group of UDP-GlcNAc at Gly-111 and Gly-112, making the entrance to the active site more tightly closed (Fig. 5, B and F). Arg-116 is bound to the main chain of Lys-421 and the side chain of Asp-422 in the substrate binding form, but it is bound to the β-phosphate group of UDP-GlcNAc in the reaction-completed form. Because this arginine residue is conserved in UAP and the mutation of the residue decreases the enzymatic activity (6Mio T. Yabe T. Arisawa M. Yamada-Okabe H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14392-14397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 14Brown K. Pompeo F. Dixon S. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Cambillau C. Bourne Y.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6191-6202Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), we consider that this movement is important for the catalytic mechanism. The three loops (Loops-A, -B, and -C) open the active site and release UDP-GlcNAc when the reaction-completed form returns to the apo-like form (Fig. 5C). The pocket to which SO42--2 is bound is located on one side of Loops-B and -C. When the active site is opened, the sulfate ion is released and Loops-B and -C close this pocket (Fig. 5G). Thus, if a molecule fills the pocket and keeps it open, it may prevent the induced fit movement of Loops-B and -C. These features could suggest a novel design for a specific inhibitor of CaUAP1, because these three residues are not conserved in human UAP. The reaction-completed and the product binding forms are similar to each other (Fig. 5D) except for the position of the α-phosphate group of UDP-GlcNAc (Fig. 4, C and D). Because UDP-GlcNAc is the substrate for the reverse reaction, the three loops close the active site by binding of UDP-GlcNAc. Effects of Magnesium Ion on CaUAP1 Activity—Fig. 6 shows the result of the enzyme assay obtained by the thin layer chromatography measurements. The increase of the MgCl2 concentration enhanced the amount of produced UDP-GlcNAc (Fig. 6A, lanes 2-8). Other metal ions such as calcium and zinc show similar enhancement (Fig. 6B). These results suggest that the activity of CaUAP1 depends on the concentration of the magnesium ion and that some metal ions including magnesium enhance the enzyme activity. Comparison with Other UAPs—The structures of CaUAP1 and human AGX1 are essentially similar. Except for the insertion loop, the two structures can be reasonably well superimposed upon each other (Fig. 7A). GlmU, prokaryotic UAP, exhibits a different tertiary structure from that of eukaryotic UAP (Fig. 7B). The N-terminal domain of CaUAP1 does not exist in GlmU, and the acetylation domain of GlmU does not exist in CaUAP1. However, the central domain of CaUAP1, to which the ligand binds, is similar to that of GlmU. Although all eukaryotic UAPs are known to function as a monomer in solution, all known crystal structures of mammalian UAPs form a dimer and their insertion loops approach to the active site of the other molecule in the crystal (Fig. 7C) (17Peneff C. Ferrari P. Charrier V. Taburet Y. Monnier C. Zamboni V. Winter J. Harnois M. Fassy F. Bourne Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6191-6202Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The insertion loop makes contact with the phosphate group of UDP-GlcNAc bound to the other molecule in the crystal (Fig. 7C). In contrast to mammalian UAPs, Arg-116 of CaUAP1 on the nucleotide binding motif binds to the β-phosphate group of UDP-GlcNAc as mentioned above (Figs. 4, C and D, and 7C). The insertion loop of the other molecule in the crystal prevents the corresponding residue of AGX1, Arg-115, from binding to the phosphate group of UDP-GlcNAc (Fig. 7C). Because both mammalian and non-mammalian UAPs are known to work as a monomer in solution, we propose that they recognize the phosphate group of UDP-GlcNAc in the same geometry; in other words, both Arg-116 of CaUAP1 and Arg-115 of AGX1 recognize the phosphate group. UTP and Metal Ion Binding Site—The sulfate ion at the active site (SO42--1) may mimic the γ-phosphate group of UTP. The distance between the sulfate ion and the α-phosphate group of UDP-GlcNAc is ∼5 Å, corresponding to the distance between the α- and γ-phosphate groups of UTP. The crystal structure of glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase has been determined as a complex with deoxythymidine-5′-triphosphate (dTTP) (33Blankenfeldt W. Asuncion M. Lam J.S. Naismith J.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6652-6663Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase belongs to the SpsA GnT I core superfamily and has the nucleotide binding motif. The sulfate ion found in CaUAP1 is located at the corresponding position of the γ-phosphate group of dTTP, and the α-phosphate group of UDP-GlcNAc in the reaction-completed form is also well superimposed on the α-phosphate group of dTTP (Fig. 8A). Thus, the sulfate ion is suggested to mimic the γ-phosphate group of UTP. Lys-25 of glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase binds to the β-phosphate of dTTP, and it is conserved in CaUAP1 as Lys-123, which may recognize the β-phosphate group of UTP in CaUAP1. GlmU possesses a metal ion that is known to act as a cofactor (11Kostrewa D. D'Arcy A. Takacs B. Kamber M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 15Olsen L.R.

Chem. 2001; 276: 11844-11851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The ion is surrounded by the α- and β-phosphate groups of UDP-GlcNAc and also by an aspartic acid, an asparagine (Asp-102 and Asn-227 in SpGlmU), and two water molecules (Fig. 8B). The asparagine residue is replaced by Lys-421 in CaUAP1 that is conserved in eukaryotic UAPs. The terminal amine of the lysine residue is located at the corresponding position of the metal ion in SpGlmU, which suggests the metal ion in prokaryotic UAPs is substituted by the lysine residue in eukaryotic UAPs. No metal ions were found in the present CaUAP1 active site, and the conserved lysine occupies the metal ion binding site in prokaryotic UAPs as previously mentioned. However, we confirmed that the CaUAP1 activity was enhanced in the presence of magnesium ion (Fig. 6). The magnesium ion is proposed to bind to the α- and γ-phosphate groups of CaUAP1. SpGlmU possesses another metal ion, which is coordinated by the α-phosphate group of UDP-GlcNAc and an arginine residue (Fig. 8C). Because the α-phosphate group of UDP-Glc-NAc mimics the γ-phosphate group of UTP and the guanidino moiety of arginine residue is located in SpGlmU at the position corresponding to the sulfate ion mimicking the γ-phosphate of UTP in CaUAP1, it is suggested that a magnesium ion may bind to the α- and γ-phosphate groups of UTP when UTP binds to the enzyme. If the magnesium ion is coordinated by UTP and changes its conformation, the residues of Arg-116, Lys-123, and Lys-421 are able to bind to the triphosphate group of UTP (Fig. 8D). Thus, we propose that the magnesium ion may induce a triphosphate conformation suitable for the reaction.

Critical mechanisms for physiological regulation of the main G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) mediating the leukotriene responses in asthma, cysteinyl leukotriene type 1 receptor (CysLT1R), have not been delineated. Although desensitization of GPCRs is a well-established phenomenon, studies demonstrating its physiological relevance are lacking. Here, we demonstrate that relief of PKC-mediated desensitization of endogenous CysLT1Rs augments multiple LTD4-stimulated cellular functions, with associated increases in intracellular signaling events. In analyses of airway smooth muscle contraction ex vivo, PKC inhibition augmented LTD4-stimulated contraction, and increased phosphoinositide hydrolysis and calcium flux in both murine and human airway smooth muscle cells. Similarly, for human monocytes, PKC inhibition augmented LTD4-stimulated calcium flux and cell migration assessed in transwell chamber experiments and also augmented LTD4-induced production of monocyte chemotactic protein assessed by ELISA. In contrast, PKC inhibition had no effect or slightly attenuated these cell functions and signaling events promoted by other receptor agonists, suggesting that despite antithetical effects on downstream events, desensitization of the CysLT1R is the principal mechanism by which PKC regulates the functional consequences of CysLT1R activation."
https://openalex.org/W1998762189,"Focused complement activation on foreign targets depends on regulatory proteins that decay the bimolecular C3 convertases. Although this process is central to complement control, how the convertases engage and disassemble is not established. The second and third complement control protein (CCP) modules of the cell surface regulator, decay-accelerating factor (DAF, CD55), comprise the simplest structure mediating this activity. Positioning the functional effects of 31 substitution mutants of DAF CCP2 to -4 on partial structures was previously reported. In light of the high resolution crystal structure of the DAF four-CCP functional region, we now reexamine the effects of these and 40 additional mutations. Moreover, we map six monoclonal antibody epitopes and overlap their effects with those of the amino acid substitutions. The data indicate that the interaction of DAF with the convertases is mediated predominantly by two patches approximately 13 A apart, one centered around Arg69 and Arg96 on CCP2 and the other around Phe148 and Leu171 on CCP3. These patches on the same face of the adjacent modules bracket an intermodular linker of critical length (16 A.) Although the key DAF residues in these patches are present or there are conservative substitutions in all other C3 convertase regulators that mediate decay acceleration and/or provide factor I-cofactor activity, the linker region is highly conserved only in the former. Intra-CCP regions also differ. Linker region comparisons suggest that the active CCPs of the decay accelerators are extended, whereas those of the cofactors are tilted. Intra-CCP comparisons suggest that the two classes of regulators bind different regions on their respective ligands."

https://openalex.org/W2022245605,"Recent advances have provided a first experimental protein interaction map of the human malaria parasite P. falciparum, which appears to be remotely related to interactomes of other eukaryotes. Here, we present a comparative topological analysis of this experimentally determined web with a network of conserved interactions between proteins in S. cerevisiae, C. elegans and D. melanogaster that have an ortholog in Plasmodium. Focusing on experimental interactions, we find a significant presence of a “rich-club,” a topological characteristic that features an “oligarchy” of highly connected proteins being intertwined with one another. In complete contrast, the network of interologs and particularly the web of evolutionary-conserved interactions in P. falciparum lack this feature. This observation prompts the question of whether this result points to a topological signature of the parasite's biology, since experimentally obtained interactions widely cover parasite-specific functions. Significantly, hub proteins that appear in such an oligarchy revolve around invasion functions, shaping an island of parasite-specific activities in a sea of evolutionary inherited interactions. This presence of a biologically unprecedented network feature in the human malaria parasite might be an artifact of the quality and the methods to obtain interaction data in this organism. Yet, the observation that rich-club proteins have distinctive and statistically significant functions that revolve around parasite-specific activities point to a topological signature of a parasitic life style."

We demonstrate here that although the total cellular PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels remain unchanged in sac1 inp54 double mutants, the spatial distribution of PtdIns(4,5)P2 is profoundly altered, accumulating on vacuole membranes. In these double mutants, vacuolar membrane PtdIns(4,5)P2 is derived from the plasma membrane, and its accumulation on a subset of vacuole membranes is associated with defects in vacuolar fusion. These studies reveal tight regulation of PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels at the plasma membrane is required to regulate vacuolar fusion.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials−All restriction and DNA-modifying enzymes were obtained from Fermentas (Burlington, Canada), New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), or Promega (Madison, WI).

Ooms L.M. Whisstock J.C. McColl B. Helfenbaum L. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. Mitchell C.A. J. Biol.

Double null sac1 inp54 and fig4 inp54 mutants and sac1ts Δinp54 mutants were created by replacing INP54 in the Δsac1, Δfig4 (ResGen/Invitrogen) or MFY72 strains, respectively, with a LEU2 cassette as described previously (9.Wiradjaja F. Ooms L.M. Whisstock J.C. McColl B. Helfenbaum L. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. Mitchell C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7643-7653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This resulted in the deletion of a segment of chr XV from coordinates 206,284–204,565, which spans the whole open reading frame of INP54 from nucleotides 1 to 1155, 400 bp upstream of the start codon and 166 bp downstream of the stop codon. The triple mutant mss4ts Δsac1 Δinp54 was generated by replacing SAC1 with a TRP1 cassette and INP54 with a URA3 cassette in the mss4ts (AAY202) strain. The TRP1 sequence was amplified from pRS424 with the primers 5′-atgacaggtccaatagtgtacgttcaaaatgcggacggtatcttcttcaagcttgctatgtctgttattaatttcag-3′ and 5′-ttaatctctttttaaaggatccggcttggaaaatttaggactgtgcggtatttcacaccg-3′. The PCR product was transformed into mss4ts strains resulting in the deletion of SAC1 from nucleotides 58 to 1830 or chr XI coordinates 34,601–36,373, creating a mss4ts Δsac1 strain. INP54, including 1602 bp upstream of the start codon and 714 bp downstream of the stop codon, was amplified from SEY6210 genomic DNA using the primers 5′-ggctcgagttaaaacgtaagggatatgct-3′ and 5′-gcggccgctgtcgatgtactttatgt-3′ and ligated into an XhoI-NotI-digested pBIIKS(+) to generate pBINP54. URA3, including its promoter, was amplified from pRS426 using the primers 5′-gactagtcgcgcgtttcggtgatgac-3′ and 5′-catgcatttacttataatacag-3′ and cloned into PstI-SpeI-digested pBINP54 to generate pBINP54URA. The URA3 cassette flanked by the sequence upstream and downstream of INP54 was recovered from pBINP54URA by XhoI-NotI digestion, and subsequently transformed into mss4ts Δsac1 strain resulting in the deletion of INP54, including 400 bp upstream and 166 bp downstream of the open reading frame, creating a mss4ts Δsac1 Δinp54 strain. Disruption of each gene was confirmed by PCR with the use of two unique sets of primers.Yeast Immunofluorescence−For the detection of Vph1p, Pep12p, and Clc1p, yeast cells were fixed, spheroplasted, and stained as described previously (9.Wiradjaja F. Ooms L.M. Whisstock J.C. McColl B. Helfenbaum L. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. Mitchell C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7643-7653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Anti-Vph1p and anti-Pep12p (Molecular Probes) were detected with anti-mouse Alexa-594 (Molecular Probes) and anti-Clc1p with anti-rabbit Alexa-594 (Molecular Probes). All other observations of GFP-tagged proteins were performed in live yeast cells. Fixed or live cells were placed on poly-l-lysine (2 mg/ml)-coated glass slides, and coverslips were mounted with SlowFade (Molecular Probes).Confocal Microscopy−Yeast cells were visualized and analyzed using either an Olympus Fluoview confocal microscope or a Leica TCS NT confocal microscope, with green fluorescence collected in channel 1 (488 nm excitation, 530 ± 30 nm emission) and red fluorescence in channel 2 (568 nm excitation, LPS90 nm). Images presented in the figures show either cells in a single field or from several different fields.Vacuole Labeling−Yeast cells were grown to mid-log phase and metabolically labeled with 20 μm FM4-64 (Sigma) for 15 min at 28 °C in YPD (34.Vida T.A. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 779-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar), chased in fresh YPD without FM4-64 for 30–120 min as indicated, and viewed by confocal microscopy. For analysis of endocytosis (Fig. 5), cells were labeled with 2 μm FM4-64 and viewed by confocal microscopy at the indicated time points. For CMAC-Arg labeling, sac1ts Δinp54 cells were incubated with 10 μm CMAC-Arg dye (Molecular Probes) for 4 h at 28 °C, shifted to 38 °C, further incubated for 2 h, and analyzed by confocal microscopy. To assay vacuolar fragmentation or fusion, yeast cells were grown in standard YPD medium, labeled with FM4-64 for 1 h, and then shifted to YPD + 0.4 m NaCl or H2O, respectively, for 30 min. All incubation steps were performed at 28 °C, except for sac1ts Δinp54 cells that were incubated at 38 °C. Approximately 400 cells from three separate experiments were scored for vacuolar fragmentation, expressed as a percentage of the total cell population, and the mean ± S.E. was determined.Analysis of Vacuole Function−YPD agar, pH 8.0, was prepared as described (35.Hongay C. Jia N. Bard M. Winston F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4114-4124Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Exponentially growing yeast cells were spotted onto agar plates in 10-fold serial dilutions, starting from a cell density of 107 cells/ml. To visualize acidified compartments, yeast cells were incubated with 0.2 mm quinacrine (Sigma) in YPD, pH 8.0, for 5 min at room temperature, as described previously (36.Roberts C.J. Raymond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar).Inhibition of Endocytosis−To block endocytosis, sac1ts Δinp54 cells expressing 2xPH-PLC-GFP were incubated with 33 μg/ml latrunculin A (Molecular Probes) at 28 °C for 1 h, shifted to 38 °C for 1–2 h, and labeled with 20 μm FM4-64 or 10 μm CMAC-Arg (Molecular Probes).Subcellular Localization of PtdIns(4)P and PtdIns(4,5)P2− PH-OSBP was amplified from pEGFP-C1/PH-OSBP using the primers 5′-ggatccaaacaatgggctcggctcgagagggc-3′ and 5′-ggatccctgccagcatcttcacagc-3′, and the resulting PCR product was cloned into the BglII site of pPGK1303. 2xPH-PLCδ1 was amplified from pEGFP-N1/PH-PLCδ1 using two different sets of primers. The first set incorporated a BamHI site at the 5′ end (5′-ggatccaaacaatggactcgggccgggac-3′) and an EcoRI site at the 3′ end (5′-gaattccttcaggaagttctg-cag-3′), and the second set incorporated an EcoRI site at the 5′ end (5′-gaattcatggactcgggccgggac-3′) and an XhoI site at the 3′ end (5′-ctcgagacttcaggaagttctgcag-3′). The two resulting PCR products were ligated together into BglII-XhoI-digested pPGK1303, and the two PH-PLCδ1 fragments simultaneously ligated via their EcoRI ends, generating two PH-PLC domains in tandem (Table 2). For expression in sac1ts Δinp54 and mss4ts Δsac1 Δinp54 strains, 2xPH-PLC-GFPδ1 was cloned in pPGK-Lys2 vector (Table 2). These constructs were subsequently transformed into yeast cells, and expression of GFP-tagged PH-OSBP, PH-PLCδ1, or PH-Num1p was analyzed live from mid-log phase cultures by confocal microscopy. Δsac1 Δinp54 and sac1ts Δinp54 cells showing 2xPH-PLC-GFP on the vacuole were scored as a percentage of the total cell population, and mean ± S.E. was determined. The proportion of vacuoles expressing 2xPH-PLC-GFP on their membranes relative to the total vacuole number per cell was determined the same way. Data were collected from four independent experiments with at least 400 cells counted.Expression of Sec14p-GFP and Pik1p-GFP−The full 912-bp SEC14 coding sequence without the stop codon (chr XIII coordinates 424,988–426,055) was amplified by PCR from the genomic DNA of SEY6210 strain using the primers 5′-agatctatggttacacaacaagaaaaggaattttta-3′ and 5′-agatctctttcatcgaaaaggcttccgg-3′, incorporating a BglII site at each end. The resulting product was cloned into the BglII site of pPGK1303 (Table 2). The full 3198-bp PIK1 sequence without the stop codon and 1000 bp of upstream sequence (chr XIV coordinates 140,877–144,074) was amplified by PCR using the primers 5′-ggatcctgttccatatctcggtgttgtttg-3′ and 5′-ggatcccgctatatataccctgtgtaataag-3′, incorporating a BamHI site at each end. The product was cloned in the BamHI site of pRS416-GFP (Table 2).Analysis of CPY and General Secretion−Metabolic labeling of CPY was performed by labeling cells with 25 μCi of Easy Tag Trans35S (Amersham Biosciences) per A600 unit at 25 °C for 5 min, followed by chasing in the presence of excess methionine and cysteine for the indicated time periods as described previously (37.Munn A.L. Heese-Peck A. Stevenson B.J. Pichler H. Riezman H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3943-3957Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). CPY was immunoprecipitated using a polyclonal CPY antibody and separated on 8% SDS-PAGE, followed by fluororadiography. CPY secretion was detected using a colony immunoblot assay as described by Roberts et al. (36.Roberts C.J. Raymond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The general secretion assay was performed as described previously (38.Gaynor E.C. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 789-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Following a 5-min Easy Tag Trans35S labeling and a 30-min chase, NaF and NaN3 were added to the cells to a final concentration of 20 mm each. The cell suspension was centrifuged to collect the medium fraction. Cold trichloroacetic acid was added to a final concentration of 10% to the medium fraction and incubated on ice for 30 min. Following centrifugation, the protein pellet was washed twice with acetone and sonicated in the presence of 2× Laemmli buffer and boiled, and 1 A600 unit was analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE. General protein secretion was detected by fluororadiography.Analysis of Steady-state Levels of ALP−Extraction of ALP from yeast cells was performed as described previously (39.Belgareh-Touze N. Avaro S. Rouille Y. Hoflack B. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1694-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). ALP was detected using a monoclonal ALP antibody (Molecular Probes).Analysis of Total Cellular Phosphoinositides by HPLC−[14C]Inositol labeling of yeast, extraction and deacylation of lipids, and HPLC techniques were performed as described previously (15.Schorr M. Then A. Tahirovic S. Hug N. Mayinger P. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1421-1426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Data were collected from three independent experiments, and the mean ± S.E. was determined.RESULTSTotal Cellular Levels of PtdIns(4,5)P2 Are Unaltered in Δsac1 Δinp54 Mutants−Inp54p and Sac1p may act sequentially to regulate PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(4)P levels, re"
https://openalex.org/W2082830860,"Ro ribonucleoproteins are a class of antigenic ribonucleoproteins associated with rheumatic autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjoögrens syndrome in humans. Ro ribonucleoproteins are mostly composed of the 60-kDa Ro protein and small cytoplasmic RNAs, called Y RNAs, of unknown function. In eukaryotes, where Ro has been found to associate with damaged or mutant RNAs, it has been suggested that Ro may play a role in RNA quality control. In the radiation-resistant bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans and some eukaryotes, Ro has also been implicated in cell survival following UV damage. Here we present the first high resolution structure of a prokaryotic Ro ortholog, Rsr from D. radiodurans. The structure has been solved to 1.9 Aå resolution and shows distinct differences when compared with the eukaryotic apo- and RNA-bound Ro structures. Rsr is composed of two domains: a helical RNA binding domain and a mixed “von Willebrand factor A-like” domain containing a divalent metal binding site. Although the individual domains of Rsr are similar to the eukaryotic Ro, significantly large differences are seen at the interface of the two domains. Since this interface communicates with the conserved central cavity of Ro, which is implicated in RNA binding, changes at this interface could potentially influence RNA binding by Ro. Although the apo-Rsr protein is monomeric, Rsr binds Y RNA to form multimers of ∼12 molecules of a 1:1 Rsr-Y RNA complex. Rsr binds D. radiodurans Y RNA with low nanomolar affinity, comparable with previously characterized eukaryotic Ro orthologs.

Ro ribonucleoproteins, a class of RNA protein complexes, were first identified as being major targets of the immune system in patients suffering from rheumatic disorders like systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjoögrens syndrome. The sera from these patients have an unusually high titer of autoantibodies that recognize Ro ribonucleoproteins (1von Muhlen C.A. Tan E.M. Semin. Arthritis Rheum. 1995; 24: 323-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). These ribonucleoproteins are composed of a 60-kDa protein called Ro and small noncoding RNAs called Y RNAs. Y RNAs are RNA polymerase III transcripts with an average size around 100 nucleotides and a yet unknown function. It has been shown that a subset of Ro ribonucleoproteins also contain other protein components like the La protein, which binds a number of nascent small RNAs, including Y RNAs (2Wolin S.L. Cedervall T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 375-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) and possibly other proteins. In mice, the absence of Ro leads to the development of a lupus-like syndrome, characterized by autoantibodies against chromatin and ribosomes and glomerulonephritis and photosensitivity (3Xue D. Shi H. Smith J.D. Chen X. Noe D.A. Cedervall T. Yang D.D. Eynon E. Brash D.E. Kashgarian M. Flavell R.A. Wolin S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7503-7508Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), leading to the proposal that the normal function of Ro may be important for the prevention of autoimmune reactions. In Xenopus oocytes, Ro has been identified in complex with mutant pre-5 S rRNAs in addition to Y RNAs. These mutant pre-5 S rRNAs are characterized by additional nucleotides at the 3′ end and one or more point mutations compared with the major oocyte 5 S rRNA sequence, which enable the mutants to adopt an alternate helical conformation (4Shi H. O'Brien C.A. Van Horn D.J. Wolin S.L. RNA. 1996; 2: 769-784PubMed Google Scholar). The mutant rRNAs, unfit to follow the pathway to maturation, eventually get degraded (5O'Brien C.A. Wolin S.L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2891-2903Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). This has led to the proposal that Ro may function as part of a novel quality control or discard pathway for 5 S rRNA production (3Xue D. Shi H. Smith J.D. Chen X. Noe D.A. Cedervall T. Yang D.D. Eynon E. Brash D.E. Kashgarian M. Flavell R.A. Wolin S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7503-7508Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Recent studies on the eukaryotic ortholog of Ro from Xenopus laevis have shown that Ro is composed of two domains. One is an elliptical domain formed by many repeats of a pair of antiparallel α-helices called HEAT repeats (6Andrade M.A. Bork P. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 115-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). The second domain resembles the collagen-binding A domain of von Willebrand factor (vWFA domain) 2The abbreviations used are: vWFA, collagen-binding A domain of von Willebrand factor; MIDAS, metal ion-dependent adhesion site; DrY RNA, D. radiodurans Y RNA; ssRNA, single-stranded RNA. consisting of a β-sheet sandwiched by multiple α-helices (7Stein A.J. Fuchs G. Fu C. Wolin S.L. Reinisch K.M. Cell. 2005; 121: 529-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The vWFA domain also includes a divalent cation-binding metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) motif. The structure of X. laevis Ro in complex with a fragment of Y RNA containing the Ro binding site shows that Ro binds Y RNAs at the outer surface of the helical domain. The positively charged central cavity surrounded largely by the elliptical domain, with the vWFA domain on one end, is large enough only to fit a single-stranded RNA. It has been proposed that this central cavity is the binding site for the single-stranded tails of mutant pre-5 S rRNAs (7Stein A.J. Fuchs G. Fu C. Wolin S.L. Reinisch K.M. Cell. 2005; 121: 529-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Mutational and structural analysis have also shown that at least part of the mutant pre-5 S rRNA binding site on X. laevis Ro overlaps the Y RNA binding site, thereby leading to a proposed role for Y RNAs in regulating the binding of Ro to other RNAs like the mutant pre-5 S rRNAs or other damaged RNAs (7Stein A.J. Fuchs G. Fu C. Wolin S.L. Reinisch K.M. Cell. 2005; 121: 529-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 8Fuchs G. Stein A.J. Fu C. Reinisch K.M. Wolin S.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 1002-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Although orthologs of Ro have now been identified in a variety of species, including all vertebrates, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the unicellular eukaryote Clamydomonas reinhardtii, the cyanobacteria Nostoc punctiforme and Synechococcus, the eubacteria Deinococcus radiodurans and Mycobacterium smegmatis, and the mycobacteriophage Bxz1 (9Chen X. Wolin S.L. J. Mol. Med. 2004; 82: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), it is unclear why such a vastly different set of species have evolved to maintain the ortholog of the 60-kDa Ro and whether there is a common function for Ro in all of these organisms. Among the orthologs of Ro in prokaryotes, the best characterized is the Rsr (Ro-sixty-related) protein from D. radiodurans. D. radiodurans is a eubacterium with the ability to tolerate unusually high doses of ionizing radiation (10Cox M.M. Battista J.R. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 882-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Studies have shown that the Rsr protein contributes to the survival of D. radiodurans following unusually high doses of UV irradiation (11Chen X. Quinn A.M. Wolin S.L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 777-782PubMed Google Scholar). D. radiodurans cells lacking Rsr are more sensitive to UV radiation than wild-type cells, and this phenotype can be partly complemented by Rsr expressed under the control of a heterologous promoter. Rsr, along with several small RNAs encoded upstream of rsr, accumulates following UV irradiation. These RNAs, of which at least one is predicted to assume a secondary structure that resembles a Y RNA, can be immunoprecipitated along with Rsr using anti-Rsr antibodies (11Chen X. Quinn A.M. Wolin S.L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 777-782PubMed Google Scholar). These experiments along with studies on mammalian cells provide clear evidence that Ro plays a role in cell survival after UV irradiation (12Chen X. Smith J.D. Shi H. Yang D.D. Flavell R.A. Wolin S.L. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 2206-2211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In humans, patients suffering from systemic autoimmune diseases often develop subcutaneous photosensitive lesions similar to that following UV damage (13Tebbe B. Orfanos C.E. Lupus. 1997; 6: 96-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In this study, we report a high resolution structure of a prokaryotic ortholog of Ro, namely Rsr from D. radiodurans. Although the overall structure of Rsr resembles the architecture of X. laevis Ro, there are major structural differences between the two proteins. The most notable difference is at the interface of the two domains, where large movements are evident in the α-helices close to the interface. Movement of these helices results in an enlarged central cavity, suggesting that the structural flexibility of Ro proteins probably aids in switching between “open” and “closed” states, which may be required for entry, stabilization, and release of the RNA substrates at the conserved central cavity. We have also characterized the binding of Rsr to Deinococcus Y RNA in vitro, using a fluorescence-based assay. Our results reveal that Rsr binds Y RNA with at least low nanomolar affinity and forms a complex with 1:1 stoichiometry. Although the apo-Rsr protein is monomeric even at very high concentrations, electron microscopy and size exclusion chromatography show that upon binding Y RNA, Rsr forms multimers of ∼12 molecules of the 1:1 Rsr-Y RNA complex. Construction of an Escherichia coli Overexpression Plasmid for Rsr and Purification of Rsr—As described in the supplemental information, the Rsr coding region was amplified from D. radiodurans genomic DNA and cloned into pET28b to construct pET28b-Rsr. The resultant construct was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3). The overexpressed Rsr was purified using Ni2+ affinity chromatography. Following cleavage of the His6 tag using thrombin, the His6-tagged and untagged Rsr were separated on a second Ni2+ column. Finally, Rsr was dialyzed against 25 mm phosphate, pH 7.0, 150 mm sodium chloride, and 2 mm dithiothreitol and used for subsequent experiments. Crystallization and X-ray Data Collection—Rod-shaped crystals for native Rsr were grown by the sitting drop method in Intelli plates, in a crystallization solution consisting of 0.1 m imidazole, pH 8.0, 12% polyethylene glycol 8000, and 0.2 m calcium acetate. Diffraction quality crystals were obtained by mixing 4 μl of crystallization solution with 2 μl of protein at a concentration of 400 μm and equilibrating against 100 μl of crystallization solution. The crystals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen using 25% glycerol in mother liquor as a cryoprotectant. The best crystal diffracted to 1.9 Aå at beamline 23-ID at the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne National Laboratories), with cell dimensions of a = 103.56 Aå, b = 87.61 Aå, c = 70.62 Aå, α = 90.0°, β = 96.57°, and γ = 90.0°. Molecular replacement using full-length or individual domains of X. laevis Ro (Protein Data Bank code 1YVP or 1YVR) as a search model was not successful; hence, to obtain phase information for structure determination, selenomethionine-substituted Rsr was produced in E. coli B834 (DE3) cells as described in the supplemental information. The same purification protocol was followed as outlined for the native Rsr. Crystals for selenomethionine-substituted Rsr were obtained in the same condition as that of native Rsr. The selenomethionine Rsr crystals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen using paratone as the cryoprotectant. The best crystal diffracted to 2.6 Aå at beamline 23-ID, and the data were isomorphous to the native Rsr diffraction data, with cell dimensions of a = 105.41 Aå, b = 89.39 Aå, c = 70.55 Aå, α = 90.0°, β = 96.8°, and γ = 90.0°. Data statistics are compiled in supplemental Table 1. Structure Determination—X-ray diffraction data sets were integrated, scaled, and merged using HKL2000 (14Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38570) Google Scholar). From the three-wavelength MAD data from selenomethionine Rsr crystals, 13 of 14 selenium sites were located using phenix.hyss (15Adams P.D. Gopal K. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Hung L.W. Ioerger T.R. McCoy A.J. Moriarty N.W. Pai R.K. Read R.J. Romo T.D. Sacchettini J.C. Sauter N.K. Storoni L.C. Terwilliger T.C. J. Synchrotron Radiat. 2004; 11: 53-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Initial phase calculation using data from 50 to 2.6 Aå resolution, followed by density modification, was done using AutoSHARP (16Cowtan K.D. Main P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). With these density-modified phases, the electron density map was calculated and initial model was built using TEXTAL (17Ioerger T.R. Sacchettini J.C. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 244-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Despite the low resolution of the MAD data and poor quality of the phases, TEXTAL built a nearly complete initial model. Improvements in the model were done manually on XtalView (18McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2021) Google Scholar) using the structure of X. laevis Ro as reference (Protein Data Bank code 1YVR). This improved model was refined against the native Rsr data first by rigid body refinement and subsequently by simulated annealing refinement using phenix.refine (15Adams P.D. Gopal K. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Hung L.W. Ioerger T.R. McCoy A.J. Moriarty N.W. Pai R.K. Read R.J. Romo T.D. Sacchettini J.C. Sauter N.K. Storoni L.C. Terwilliger T.C. J. Synchrotron Radiat. 2004; 11: 53-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). AutoBUILD on the phenix suite was used to improve the model. Bias-minimized maps were created using the TB Bias Removal Server (19Reddy V. Swanson S.M. Segelke B. Kantardjieff K.A. Sacchettini J.C. Rupp B. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 2200-2210Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Strong positive electron density was seen surrounded by the cation binding MIDAS motif (DXSXS... T... D), and Ca2+ was refined into this density, since the crystallization condition contains 200 mm calcium acetate. The final model was refined with crystallographic Rwork and Rfree of 22.3 and 26.2%, respectively. Refinement statistics are shown in Table 1. 99% of residues are in the allowed region of the Ramachandran plot with 1% in the generously allowed region. Electrostatic surface potential was calculated using APBS (20Baker N.A. Sept D. Joseph S. Holst M.J. McCammon J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3406-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10307) Google Scholar) of the full-length DrY RNA and the 35-mer fragment DrY RNA35 are shown in supplemental Fig. 2. The RNA was resuspended in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 150 mm NaCl and annealed by heating at 85 °C for 5 min followed by cooling at room temperature for 45 min. Folded RNA was subjected to nondenaturing gel electrophoresis on a 15% TBE Ready Gel (Bio-Rad) to check for formation of alternate dimer conformations. Fluorescence Assays to Study Binding between Rsr and DrY RNA35—Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence measurements were carried out on an ISS PC1 photon-counting spectrofluorometer with Ro at a concentration of 50 nm. The reaction buffer consisted of 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2. RNA was titrated in to achieve final concentrations from 5.8 to 665 nm. Following each titration, the sample was allowed to equilibrate for 10 min, and fluorescence emission spectra (315–450 nm) were acquired upon excitation at 295 nm. Simultaneous titration of RNA to buffer alone was done, and the tryptophan emission data were corrected for fluorescence from RNA or buffer components. Control experiments and equations used to analyze the binding data are described in the supplemental information. Size Exclusion Chromatography of Rsr-DrY RNA35—Rsr was purified as described above, on a Ni2+ affinity column. Rsr at 3 μm was mixed with a 5-fold molar excess of DrY RNA35 and dialyzed against buffer containing 25 mm phosphate, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. Following dialysis, the sample was concentrated 10-fold and injected on a Superdex 200 analytical column equilibrated with the same buffer. All runs on the Superdex 200 column were performed at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Identical elution profiles were obtained with the complex at concentrations as low as 1 μm. Different concentrations of protein alone (1–500 μm) and DrY RNA35 alone (2–590 μm) were injected in separate runs on the column. The column was calibrated with a mix of standard protein markers (catalog number 151-1901; Bio-Rad). A standard curve of elution volumes versus log10 of molecular weights was plotted and used to calculate the molecular weights of the Rsr, DrY RNA35, and Rsr-DrY RNA complex peaks. The ratio of absorbance at 260 nm to absorbance at 280 nm was measured for each fraction. Ratios greater than 1 were taken to be indicative of RNA. To detect protein in the fractions, the fractions were spotted on a nitrocellulose membrane, incubated successively with anti-His6 antibodies and anti-mouse IgG alkaline phosphatase, and stained with SigmaFAST™ 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium. Electron Microscopy on Rsr-DrY RNA35 Complex—Rsr-DrY RNA35 (∼3 μm in 25 mm phosphate, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol) samples were prepared for electron microscopy according to Valentine et al. (24Valentine R.C. Shapiro B.M. Stadtman E.R. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 2143-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar) and stained with 2% (w/v) aqueous uranyl acetate, pH 4.3. Duplicate grids were prepared similarly but stained with 2% (w/v) ammonium molybdate, pH 7.0. Samples were examined using a JEOL 1200EX transmission electron microscope operating at 100 kV. Micrographs were recorded at a calibrated magnification of ×38,030. Selected micrographs were digitized using a Leafscan 45 microdensitometer at a 20-μm scan step corresponding to 5.26 Aå/pixel at the specimen level. Particles were manually selected using the BOXER program from the EMAN (25Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2102) Google Scholar) single particle analysis software package. Approximately 1,600 particles were chosen and further processed with IMAGIC-5 (26van Heel M. Harauz G. Orlova E.V. Schmidt R. Schatz M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). Particle images were normalized, band pass-filtered, and subjected to reference-free classification. Nonredundant class averages were then chosen as references for multireference alignment (27Van Heel M. Optik. 1989; 82: 114-126Google Scholar). The process was iterated until stable classes were obtained based on visual inspection and intraclass variance. All class averages are displayed without imposing symmetry. The Crystal Structure of D. radiodurans Rsr—The structure of Rsr was solved in a Ca2+-bound state, at a resolution of 1.89 Aå. The final model was refined to an Rwork of 22.3% and an Rfree of 26.2% with excellent stereochemistry. X-ray data collection and structure refinement statistics are shown in Table 1 and supplemental Table 1. The refined model comprises residues 36–531 of the total 531 residues, one Ca2+ atom, and 400 molecules of water. Clear electron density was not visible for residues 1–35, which are presumably disordered in the crystals. Multiple sequence alignment of Ro from various organisms (supplemental Fig. 1) shows that this N-terminal stretch of 35 residues is highly variant in all Ro orthologs except for six conserved residues. In the crystal structure of Ro from X. laevis, this region is placed on the outer surface of the protein, away from the RNA binding sites, and forms two short β-strands, which pack against a β-strand of the C-terminal domain (7Stein A.J. Fuchs G. Fu C. Wolin S.L. Reinisch K.M. Cell. 2005; 121: 529-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The crystallographic asymmetric unit consists of one monomer of Rsr, and applying crystallographic symmetry does not generate any higher oligomer of Rsr with significant buried surface area. This, along with size exclusion studies performed on purified Rsr (see Fig. 4A), suggests that Rsr is a monomer. The overall structure of Rsr resembles a ring spanning ∼76 Aå in diameter and ∼32 Aå in thickness (Fig. 1A). Rsr possesses two distinct domains: an N-terminal domain, including residues 36–351, and a C-terminal domain, including residues 352–531. The N-terminal domain comprises HEAT repeats made up of numerous short helices (H1–H18), which form a ringlike arrangement, and one β-strand (β1). The ringlike arrangement of helices encloses a central cavity with dimensions of 18–20 Aå and is lined by charged residues from the loops connecting successive helices from H2 to H18. The majority of residues pointing into this cavity (e.g. Arg128, Lys172, Tyr173, Arg176, Glu247, Arg273, and Arg309) are strictly conserved among the Ro orthologs. In Ro from X. laevis, this site has been implicated in binding single-stranded RNAs with these conserved residues directly interacting with an extended conformation of a single strand of RNA (7Stein A.J. Fuchs G. Fu C. Wolin S.L. Reinisch K.M. Cell. 2005; 121: 529-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Notably, on the outer surface of the helical ring domain, there is another cluster of positively charged residues (Arg116, Lys117, Arg151, Arg152, Lys187, His189, and Lys191), some of which are highly conserved in Ro orthologs. In X. laevis Ro, this site has been implicated in Y RNA binding (7Stein A.J. Fuchs G. Fu C. Wolin S.L. Reinisch K.M. Cell. 2005; 121: 529-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The N-terminal HEAT repeat domain of Rsr bears structural similarity to the HEAT repeat domains present in nuclear transport proteins like the importin-β family. The C-terminal domain of Rsr resembles a vWFA domain similar to that found in integrins and extracellular matrix proteins (28Whittaker C.A. Hynes R.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3369-3387Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). The vWFA domain is characterized by a β-sheet sandwiched between α-helices. In Rsr, the β-sheet is formed by six parallel β-strands (β2–β7) and is sandwiched by parallel helices H19, H20, and H23 on one side and helices H21 and H22 on the other. Interestingly, in Rsr, this C-terminal β-sheet interacts with the β-strand (β1) from the N-terminal domain to form a seven-stranded sheet. The C-terminal domain in Rsr also includes a divalent cation binding MIDAS motif. This motif consists of residues D367XSXS...T...D462, all of which are strictly conserved in all Ro orthologs. In Rsr, a peak of strong positive electron density corresponding to the 6σ contour level in a difference density map was proximal to a site surrounded by the MIDAS residues. A Ca2+ ion was fit into this site based on the fact that the crystallization condition contains 200 mm calcium acetate (Fig. 1B). The Ca2+ ion is coordinated by Oγ of Ser369, Oγ of Ser371, two structured water molecules (HOH 3 and HOH 6), Oɛ2 of Glu464, and Oɛ1 and Oɛ2 of Glu464 from a crystallographically symmetry-related molecule. The distances between the Ca2+ ion and the ligands range from 2.3 to 2.6 Aå. Two residues of the MIDAS motif, Asp367 and Asp462, form the second coordination sphere around the calcium ion and bind the metal-coordinating waters. This feature of a metal-coordinating ligand belonging to a symmetry-related molecule has been observed in other crystal forms of the MIDAS motifs in vWFA domains and integrin I domains (29Lacy D.B. Wigelsworth D.J. Scobie H.M. Young J.A. Collier R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6367-6372Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 30Lee J.O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar), where it has been proposed that in physiological conditions, the coordinating ligand may belong to a binding partner of the protein. Although a disulfide bond between Cys374 of symmetry-related molecules of Rsr was observed, this is probably an artifact of crystallization where a high concentration of protein was used. In the RNA-bound structure of X. laevis Ro, the metal site is occupied by a Mg2+ ion, and the metal coordination is completed by an acetate molecule from the crystallization solution. It has been suggested that the acetate may mimic an aspartate or glutamate residue from a yet unidentified binding partner of Ro (7Stein A.J. Fuchs G. Fu C. Wolin S.L. Reinisch K.M. Cell. 2005; 121: 529-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In both integrins and the cell adhesion proteins, the vWFA domain is the site for protein-protein interactions with a conserved cation-binding MIDAS site acting as a structural “glue,” bringing protein ligands closer to the vWFA domain. In many cases, metal binding at the MIDAS site is also associated with large conformational changes at a distant site across the domain (31Shimaoka M. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 485-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Based on the similarity in the fold of the C-terminal domain of Rsr to other vWFA domains, it is possible that this conserved domain of Rsr along with the metal site helps to mediate interactions between Rsr and other proteins. Also, since Rsr has been shown to bind small RNAs that are damaged or targeted for degradation (11Chen X. Quinn A.M. Wolin S.L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 777-782PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that binding partners of Rsr include nucleases, helicases, and other RNA processing enzymes. Rsr Binds Y RNA with Low Nanomolar Affinity—To characterize the binding of Rsr to D. radiodurans Y RNA, a fluorescence-based assay was used. Rsr has eight tryptophans, five of which are strictly conserved in all Ro homologs. Also, the structure of X. laevis Ro bound to RNA (7Stein A.J. Fuchs G. Fu C. Wolin S.L. Reinisch K.M. Cell. 2005; 121: 529-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) suggests that one or more tryptophans are involved in stacking interactions with RNA. The RNA used in this experiment is a 35-mer fragment of Y RNA (called DrY RNA35), representing the Ro binding region (supplemental Fig. 2C). By monitoring the quenching of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence upon titrating RNA, binding isotherms were obtained (Fig. 2). The minimum detectable amount of Rsr was found to be 25 nm; hence, the assay was done at a 50 nm concentration of Rsr. Relevant corrections for RNA fluorescence, photobleaching, and inner filter effect of RNA have been described under “Experimental Procedures.” Using this assay, it was found that Rsr binds DrY RNA35 with a Kd of at least 16 ± 3 nm affinity and a stoichiometry of 1:"
https://openalex.org/W2093250957,"The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a cAMP-regulated chloride channel in the plasma membrane of several epithelial cells. Maturation of CFTR is inefficient in most cells, with only a fraction of nascent chains being properly folded and transported to the cell surface. The most common mutation in CFTR, CFTR-deltaF508, leads to the genetic disease cystic fibrosis. CFTR-deltaF508 has a temperature-sensitive folding defect and is almost quantitatively degraded in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Here we tested whether a strong ER export signal appended to CFTR improves its transport and surface expression. We show that a single valine ER export signal at the C terminus of the cytoplasmic tail of CFTR improves maturation of wild-type CFTR by 2-fold. This conservative mutation interfered with neither plasma membrane localization nor stability of mature CFTR. In contrast, the valine signal was unable to rescue CFTR-deltaF508 from ER-associated degradation. Our finding of improved maturation of CFTR mediated by a valine signal may be of potential use in gene therapy of cystic fibrosis. Moreover, failure of the valine signal to rescue CFTR-deltaF508 from ER degradation indicates that the inability of CFTR-deltaF508 to leave the ER is unlikely to be due to a malfunctioning ER export signal."
