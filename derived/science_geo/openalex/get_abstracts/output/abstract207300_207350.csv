https://openalex.org/W1568502048,"One way in which an organism controls its biosynthetic path- ways is by feedback inhibition. This control adjusts the rate of production of the end products of pathways, such as amino acids and nucleotides, to the rate of synthesis of macromolecules, such as proteins and nucleic acids. Control is imposed by the end product itself in a simple and rapid manner: the end product stops production of more of itself by inhibiting the activity of the first enzyme unique to its pathway. Consequently, if an end product is not continually removed into macromolecules, additional end product is not made. The organism benefits from feedback inhibition, because it avoids wasting resources of carbon, nitrogen, and energy on end products which are not used. Certainly it is a widespread and effective metabolic con- trol. Many biosynthetic pathways in bacteria have feedback inhibition, and a few instances are also known for higher or- ganisms (1). In this article, a feedback inhibition is investigated to learn more about its enzymological mechanism. Until now, feedback inhibition has been studied at a metabolic level where one us- ually asks which end product inhibits which enzyme. The question now asked is, how does the end product of a pathway inhibit the first enzyme? This question is justified because many known feedback inhibitions appear competitive, as if in- hibition results from a competition of the inhibitor and substrate for the same groups of the active site on the first enzyme. To the enzymologist, competition is wholly unexpected because the end product and substrate often differ greatly in size, shape, and charge, in contrast with classical competitors (2). How can there be competition when a site specific for the substrate seems unsuited for also binding the end product? The problem of the mechanism of inhibition was approached by using the first enzyme unique to pyrimidine biosynthesis in Escherichiu coli. This enzyme is aspartate transcarbamylase, which catalyzes the reaction shown in Fig. 1. It is known that in the bacterium the activity of aspartate transcarbamylase is closely controlled by an end product, probably a cytosine de- rivative, and that inhibition of this enzyme is important for controlling the whole pathway (3). Aspartate transcarbamylase is especially suited for enzymological study because it can be obtained easily in a highly purified state (4). It is inhibited by a nucleotide end product which competes with a structurally lunrelated substrate, an amino acid.

https://openalex.org/W1561352124,"It has become evident that several enzymatic reactions exist which lead to the incorporation of the mononucleotide moiety of the ribonucleoside triphosphates into ribonucleic acid (1). The first of these enzymes to be characterized catalyzes the addition of cytosine 5’-phosphate and adenosine 5’-phosphate to the nucleoside terminal end of soluble ribonucleic acid (2,3). The product of this reaction is a ribonucleic acid, terminated by pCpCpA, and active as an acceptor of amino acid (l-7). It is the purpose of this communication to report the method of purification and the characterization of a second enzyme. This enzyme, obtained from Escherichia coli, catalyzes the synthesis of RNA from the four ribonucleoside triphosphates, and is completely dependent on deoxyribonucleic acid. The other product of the reaction is inorganic pyrophosphate. A number of reports from different laboratories have demonstrated the wide distribution of this enzyme and have discussed various aspects of the reaction it catalyzes (S-22)."

https://openalex.org/W2017366729,"AGENESIS (congenital absence) of the third molar tooth is a familiar polymorphism in man, with a population frequency of at least 9 per cent in Europeans1. Hitherto, congenital absence of this tooth has been considered as an independent trait, or at most associated with reduction in size when agenesis is incomplete. However, there is evidence connecting the presence or absence of the third molar tooth with the timing of formation of the premolar and molar teeth as well."

Cell-free extracts of aerobically grown R. rubrum catalyzed phosphorylation of adenosine diphosphate associated with the oxidation of a variety of substrates in the dark. The P:O ratios varied from below 1 with a variety of citric acid cycle intermediates to a maximum of less than 2 with glucose and related sugar phosphates. 2. The oxidative phosphorylation system consisted of a mix- ture of soluble dehydrogenases and a particulate system. The particles contained reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide oxi- dase, succinoxidase, and transhydrogenase activities. Soluble components were not required for the phosphorylation carried out by the particles oxidizing DPNH or succinate. 3. The oxidative phosphorylation differed markedly from the anaerobic photophosphorylation catalyzed by extracts of light- grown R. rubrum. The former was not affected by antimycin A, Compound SN5949, and 2-n-nonyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide, whereas the latter was strongly inhibited. Further- more, Amytal, which inhibited DPNH oxidation and associated phosphorylation, did not appreciably affect photophosphoryla- tion. Finally, phenazine methosulfate, which stimulated photo- phosphorylation, inhibited oxidative phosphorylation. 4. Oxidative phosphorylation was carried out by extracts of light-grown R. rubrum and appeared to be associated with the “chromatophore” system which catalyzed photophosphoryla- tion. The oxidative phosphorylation of anaerobically light- grown and aerobically dark-grown R. rubrum were affected in the same manner by inhibitors. 5. An analysis of extracts indicated that preparations from dark-grown and light-grown R. rubrum contained approximately the same amounts of cytochromes b and ~2; on the other hand, the latter extracts contained more than 10 times as much co- enzyme Q and Rhodospirillum heme protein as the former.

Empirical and theoretical electrode equations have been presented to describe electrode behavior in a variety of aqueous solutions. Most electrodes show response interpretable as showing nearly ideal solid-solution behavior of the cations in the glass surface.

https://openalex.org/W25834180,"The classical investigations of Borsook and Dubnoff showed that creatine is synthesized in the liver (l-3). From these studies carried out in vitro on homogenates and liver slices, no definitive conclusions may be drawn concerning the rate at which creatine is synthesized in viwo. Furthermore, recent studies have indicated that creatine may also be synthesized in organs other than the liver (4,5). In the past few years, interest in creatine metabolism has been renewed, particularly since it appears that creatine synthesis may be regulated by the creatine content in the diet (6-9). Although the experimental results suggest that creatine synthesis may be controlled indirectly by the level of transamidinase in the kidney (7, 8, lo), the effect of creatine intake on the hepatic synthesis of creatine from glycocyamine has not been measured directly. In the present investigation, the rate at which creatine is synthesized from glycocyamine in the isolated perfused liver has been determined under two experimental conditions: (u) in the presence of precursors at levels normally present in blood and (b) in the presence of high concentrations of precursors added to the perfusion. The rate at which creatine is synthesized in the isolated perfused liver taken from rats fed a diet containing 2% creatine for 5 days was also determined. Finally, extrahepatic creatine synthesis was studied in the surviving eviscerated rat after surgical removal of all abdominal viscera."

In Vicia faba the lack of fit to a Poisson distribution has been attributed to the occurrence of only two sites per cell where the chromosomes are close enough to form exchanges if broken. When chromatid aberrations are induced, after chromosomal duplication, the number of sites more than doubles."

Smit2 has shown that the slow-contracting muscle fibres contain more lipids and possess a stronger reducing capacity for methylene blue than the fast-contracting ones. Histochemical investigation of these two types of fibres3 has shown that there is more lipase activity in the slow-contracting muscles. Here we report the results of a quantitative investigation of lipase activity in the slow- and fast-contracting leg muscles of the cockroach."

https://openalex.org/W2399572448,"Several spectral changes have been reported to be related to changes in bonding or other factors in the environment of the side chains of aromatic amino acid residues (l-lo). It would then be expected that on addition of a competitive inhibitor to an enzyme solution, a change in the spectrum of the enzyme could be observed, if aromatic amino acid residues were present at the inhibitor-binding site, and interaction took place between these residues and the inhibitor. During investigation of the relations between the enzymatic activity and the structure of bovine pancreatic carboxypeptidase A, we have found spectral changes due to the interaction between the enzyme and the inhibitor. Since carboxypeptidase A is scarcely susceptible to the attack of proteolytic enzymes,’ probably because of the unusually high content of helix,* and since chemical modifications of the enzyme3 do not provide any positive information about the nature of amino acid residues involved in the enzymatic activity, the binding of the inhibitors observed spectrophotometrically was expected to indicate a way to approach the study of the active center of the enzyme. The present paper describes some of our findings."
