The simplest explanation is that the Universe is just too young to have built up many luminous galaxies at z≈7–8 by hierarchical merging of small galaxies. A search for galaxies at z≈7–8, roughly 700 million years from the Big Bang finds only one candidate galaxy at z≈7–8, where ten would be expected if there were no evolution in the galaxy population between z≈7 and z≈6. The simplest explanation is that the Universe is just too young to have built up many luminous galaxies at z≈7–8 by hierarchical merging of small galaxies. Quantum mechanics demands that the act of measurement must affect the measured object. When a linear amplifier is used to continuously monitor the position of an object, the Heisenberg uncertainty relationship requires that the object be driven by force impulses, called back-action1,2,3. Here we measure the back-action of a superconducting single-electron transistor (SSET) on a radio-frequency nanomechanical resonator. The conductance of the SSET, which is capacitively coupled to the resonator, provides a sensitive probe of the latter's position; back-action effects manifest themselves as an effective thermal bath, the properties of which depend sensitively on SSET bias conditions. Surprisingly, when the SSET is biased near a transport resonance, we observe cooling of the nanomechanical mode from 550 mK to 300 mK—an effect that is analogous to laser cooling in atomic physics. Our measurements have implications for nanomechanical readout of quantum information devices and the limits of ultrasensitive force microscopy (such as single-nuclear-spin magnetic resonance force microscopy). Furthermore, we anticipate the use of these back-action effects to prepare ultracold and quantum states of mechanical structures, which would not be accessible with existing technology."

Assembly of this community begins at birth through processes that remain largely undefined. In this report, we examine the adaptations of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a prominent member of the adult distal intestinal microbiota, during the suckling and weaning periods. Germ-free NMRI mice were colonized at birth from their gnotobiotic mothers, who harbored this anaerobic Gram-negative saccharolytic bacterium. B. thetaiotaomicron was then harvested from the ceca of these hosts during the suckling period (postnatal day 17) and after weaning (postnatal day 30). Whole genome transcriptional profiles were obtained at these two time points using custom B. thetaiotaomicron GeneChips. Transcriptome-based in silico reconstructions of bacterial metabolism and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and biochemical assays of carbohydrate utilization in vivo indicated that in the suckling gut B. thetaiotaomicron prefers host-derived polysaccharides, as well as mono- and oligosaccharides present in mother's milk. After weaning, B. thetaiotaomicron expands its metabolism to exploit abundant, plant-derived dietary polysaccharides. The bacterium's responses to postnatal alterations in its nutrient landscape involve expression of gene clusters encoding environmental sensors, outer membrane proteins involved in binding and import of glycans, and glycoside hydrolases. These expression changes are interpreted in light of a phylogenetic analysis that revealed unique expansions of related polysaccharide utilization loci in three human alimentary tract-associated Bacteroidetes, expansions that likely reflect the evolutionary adaptations of these species to different nutrient niches.

Our adult gut is colonized with a community of 10-100 trillion microbes. This microbiota, and its collective genome (microbiome), provide us with important physiological attributes that are not encoded in our own human genome, including the ability to break down otherwise indigestible nutrients that are delivered to the distal gut, such as dietary plant polysaccharides (1Sonnenburg J.L.

A recent comprehensive 16 S rRNA-based enumeration study of the distal intestinal microbiota of a small number of healthy adult humans demonstrated that >99% of detected phylogenetic types (phylotypes) belong to two of the 70 bacterial divisions (superkingdoms) currently known in nature: the Bacteroidetes and the Firmicutes (3Eckburg P.B.

Gordon J.I. Cell. 2006; 124: 837-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2190) Google Scholar). Within each division there is great diversity at the species and subspecies levels. Moreover, these shallow lineages show considerable variation between individual humans (3Eckburg P.B. Bik E.M. Bernstein C.N. Purdom E. Dethlefsen L. Sargent M. Gill S.R. Nelson K.E. Relman D.A. Science. 2005; 308: 1635-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (5278) Google Scholar, 4Ley R.E. Peterson D.A. Gordon J.I. Cell. 2006; 124: 837-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2190) Google Scholar). The mechanisms controlling assembly of our microbiotas remain ill defined. This issue can be framed as follows. What is the effect of the microbial community that is available to colonize a host at the time of birth (the legacy effect)? What is the effect of the gut environment itself on shaping the available community, and is the gut selecting for properties that are common or unique to members of bacterial divisions (the host effect)? Recent reciprocal transplantation experiments have emphasized the importance of host habitat: when the gut microbiota of a conventionally raised mouse is introduced into a germ-free zebrafish recipient, and vice versa, the recipient gut acts as a biological filter to amplify members of the donor community that most closely resemble its normal (native) species. (5Rawls J.F. Mahowald M. Ley R.E. Gordon J.I. Cell. 2006; 127: 423-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Our gut-associated Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes have not been identified outside of the intestinal habitat. Thus, they are likely acquired by transmission from our mothers or other family members soon after birth. This notion is supported by several observations. Studies using C57Bl/6J mice revealed that offspring inherit microbiotas similar to those of their mothers (6Ley R.E. Backhed F. Turnbaugh P. Lozupone C.A. Knight R.D. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 11070-11075Crossref PubMed Scopus (4137) Google Scholar). The effect of kinship was evident across generations: C57Bl/6J mothers who are sisters have gut microbiotas that are similar to one another and to those of their offspring (6Ley R.E. Backhed F. Turnbaugh P. Lozupone C.A. Knight R.D. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 11070-11075Crossref PubMed Scopus (4137) Google Scholar). Culture-based studies of humans indicate that infants, who are germ-free in utero, also acquire their initial microbiota from the vaginal and fecal microbiota of their mothers (7Gronlund M.M. Lehtonen O.P. Eerola E. Kero P. J. Pediatr. Gastroenterol. Nutr. 1999; 28: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar, 8Mandar R. Mikelsaar M. Biol. Neonate. 1996; 69: 30-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The extent to which host genotype influences the composition of the postnatally acquired microbiota is unclear. 16 S rRNA fingerprinting studies of a small number of adult monozygotic twin pairs indicated their fecal microbiotas were more similar to one another than to their marital partners. However, the same trend was true for dizygotic twins, underscoring the importance of a shared mother (9Zoetendal E.G. Akkermans A.D.L. Vliet W.M.A.-V. Visser J.A.G.M.D. Vos W.M.D. Microbial Ecology Health Disease. 2001; 13: 129-134Crossref Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Although many studies have been carried out to decipher the composition of the fecal microbiota during the postnatal period, the majority have used culture-based methods and hence are subject to sampling bias and to limited sensitivity (10Pace N.R. Science. 1997; 276: 734-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (1976) Google Scholar, 11Hugenholtz P. Goebel B.M. Pace N.R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4765-4774Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To date, there are no reports describing the results of a comprehensive 16 S rRNA sequence-based enumeration of gut microbial communities during the postnatal period, in related or unrelated infants. Therefore, we do not know whether there is an orderly succession of colonizers leading to a climax community, or whether there is a period of open occupation followed by selection of what will become persistent (autochothonous) members of the microbiota. Culture-based enumeration studies have yielded disparate results that may reflect host and/or legacy effects. Facultative anaerobes are commonly identified among the early colonizers and are succeeded by obligate anaerobes (12Balmer S.E. Scott P.H. Wharton B.A. Arch. Dis. Child. 1989; 64: 1678-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 13Roberts A.K. Chierici R. Sawatzki G. Hill M.J. Volpato S. Vigi V. Acta Paediatr. 1992; 81: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 14Sakata H. Yoshioka H. Fujita K. Eur. J. Pediatr. 1985; 144: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 15Yoshioka H. Iseki K. Fujita K. Pediatrics. 1983; 72: 317-321PubMed Google Scholar). However, prominent obligate anaerobes that are members of the adult microbiota have been identified as early as postnatal day 3 in vaginally delivered infants (14Sakata H. Yoshioka H. Fujita K. Eur. J. Pediatr. 1985; 144: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 16George M. Nord K.E. Ronquist G. Hedenstierna G. Wiklund L. Ups. J. Med. Sci. 1996; 101: 233-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), suggesting that adult-associated species establish an early presence in this environment. In the present study, we address the question of how dominant members of the adult microbiota are able to persist during the suckling period so that they can expand to levels of prominence after the transition from a diet of mother's milk to one rich in plant-derived complex polysaccharides. For this analysis, we selected Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a Gram-negative anaerobe that comprised 6% of all bacteria and 12% of all Bacteroidetes in the most comprehensive 16 S rRNA sequence-based enumeration of the adult human colonic microbiota published to date (3Eckburg P.B. Bik E.M. Bernstein C.N. Purdom E. Dethlefsen L. Sargent M. Gill S.R. Nelson K.E. Relman D.A. Science. 2005; 308: 1635-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (5278) Google Scholar). One indication of B. thetaiotaomicron's adaptation to life in the adult gut is its large collection of genes dedicated to the acquisition and metabolism of plant and other dietary polysaccharides encountered in our postweaning diets (17Xu J. Bjursell M.K. Himrod J. Deng S. Carmichael L.K. Chiang H.C. Hooper L.V. Gordon J.I. Science. 2003; 299: 2074-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). The B. thetaiotaomicron genome is predicted to encode 226 glycoside hydrolases and 15 polysaccharide lyases, allowing it to break down polysaccharides that we cannot process on our own because our proteome lacks the requisite enzymes (e.g. B. thetaiotaomicron contains 64 arabinosidases, xylanases, and pectate lyases, whereas we have none; see Carbohydrate Active Enzymes data base (CAZy) 3The abbreviations used are: CAZy, Carbohydrate Active Enzymes; ECF, extracytoplasmic function; Pn, postnatal day n; COG, clusters of orthologous groups; GH, glycoside hydrolase; PL, polysaccharide lyase; CPS, capsular polysaccharide synthesis.3The abbreviations used are: CAZy, Carbohydrate Active Enzymes; ECF, extracytoplasmic function; Pn, postnatal day n; COG, clusters of orthologous groups; GH, glycoside hydrolase; PL, polysaccharide lyase; CPS, capsular polysaccharide synthesis. at afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/CAZY/for a comprehensive annotation). The B. thetaiotaomicron genome also contains 209 paralogs of two cell surface proteins that bind starch (107 paralogs of SusC; 102 paralogs of SusD). SusC paralogs are predicted TonB-dependent, β-barrel-type outer membrane proteins; thus, in addition to binding polysaccharides, they likely participate in energy-dependent transport of these carbohydrates into the periplasmic space (18Reeves A.R. D'Elia J.N. Frias J. Salyers A.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 823-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). SusD paralogs are predicted to be secreted proteins with an N-terminal lipid tail that allows them to associate with the outer membrane (19Shipman J.A. Berleman J.E. Salyers A.A. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5365-5372Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). B. thetaiotaomicron also contains an expanded set of environmental sensors and regulators that includes 50 extracytoplasmic function (ECF) σ factors and 26 anti-σ factors, 79 members of classic two-component systems, plus 32 novel “hybrid” two-component systems that incorporate all of the domains encountered in a two-component system into a single polypeptide (17Xu J. Bjursell M.K. Himrod J. Deng S. Carmichael L.K. Chiang H.C. Hooper L.V. Gordon J.I. Science. 2003; 299: 2074-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). At least some of the latter proteins are used by B. thetaiotaomicron to sense polysaccharides and coordinately regulate genes involved their metabolism (20Sonnenburg E.D. Sonnenburg J.L. Manchester J.K. Hansen E.E. Chiang H.C. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8834-8839Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Genes encoding SusC and SusD paralogs are typically positioned adjacent to one another in the B. thetaiotaomicron genome (102 of 107 loci containing susC paralogs) and are often part of larger gene clusters encoding enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism (62 of 107 loci) (17Xu J. Bjursell M.K. Himrod J. Deng S. Carmichael L.K. Chiang H.C. Hooper L.V. Gordon J.I. Science. 2003; 299: 2074-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). At least 18 of the 62 clusters that include glycoside hydrolases also contain ECF-type σ factors and adjacent anti-σ factors. This arrangement suggests that the polysaccharide binding, import, and catabolism functions represented in these clusters are co-regulated to allow for efficient, prioritized, and adaptive foraging of glycans based on their availability. Our analysis, described below, of the adaptations of B. thetaiotaomicron to the suckling period in a simplified gnotobiotic mouse model supports this view: it emphasizes the importance of host mucosal polysaccharides in supporting B. thetaiotaomicron during the suckling period (habitat effect) and links the evolution of these polysaccharide utilization clusters to their coordinate regulation. Mother-to-Pup Transmission of B. thetaiotaomicron—All of the experimental manipulations involving mice used protocols approved by the Washington University Animal Studies Committee. Mice belonging to the NMRI-KI inbred line were reared in gnotobiotic isolators (21Hooper L.V. Midtvedt T. Gordon J.I. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2002; 22: 283-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar) under a strict 12-h light cycle (lights on at 6:00 a.m.) and given unlimited access to autoclaved water and an autoclaved standard polysaccharide-rich chow diet (B&K Universal, Grimston, UK). In a given experiment, one male and two pregnant female NMRI mice were gavaged with 100 μl of an overnight culture of B. thetaiotaomicron strain VPI-5482 (ATCC 29148) containing 108 colony-forming units in TYG medium (20Sonnenburg E.D. Sonnenburg J.L. Manchester J.K. Hansen E.E. Chiang H.C. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8834-8839Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Littermates were sacrificed at postnatal day 17 (P17) and P30. The stomachs of all P17 animals were surveyed to verify that there were no chow particles present. The density of bacterial colonization of the cecum and colon was determined based on colony-forming units and quantitative real time PCR assays (20Sonnenburg E.D. Sonnenburg J.L. Manchester J.K. Hansen E.E. Chiang H.C. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8834-8839Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 22Samuel B.S. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 10011-10016Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Whole Genome Transcriptional Profiling of B. thetaiotaomicron in Vivo—Ceca from P17 mice were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. After thawing in RNAprotect solution (1 ml/sample; Qiagen), each cecum was cut open and vortexed for 10 s at 25 °C to separate luminal contents from the mucosa, and the mixture was centrifuged (1,200 × g for 10 s) to remove tissue fragments. The resulting supernatants were subjected to a bacterial cell lysis protocol described below. The contents were removed from P30 ceca by manual extrusion from their distal ends and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. The samples were later thawed in 1 ml of RNAprotect prior to lysis. Cecal samples from P17 mice were lysed in TE buffer (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) containing 1 mg/ml of lysozyme (specific activity 50,000 units/mg; Sigma; 10 min of incubation at room temperature). Cecal samples from P30 mice were combined with 500 μl of 200 mm NaCl/20 mm EDTA, and the cells were lysed by bead beating (6Ley R.E. Backhed F. Turnbaugh P. Lozupone C.A. Knight R.D. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 11070-11075Crossref PubMed Scopus (4137) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated and prepared for hybridization to custom B. thetaiotaomicron GeneChips according to Sonnenburg et al. (1Sonnenburg J.L. Xu J. Leip D.D. Chen C.H. Westover B.P. Weatherford J. Buhler J.D. Gordon J.I. Science. 2005; 307: 1955-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). 4All of the GeneChip data used in this study are available from the Gene Expression Omnibus data base (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/) under accession number GSE279. Microarray Suite 5 software (Affymetrix) was used for initial data analysis. Selection criteria for identifying genes that were differentially expressed between P17 and P30 ceca were 100% present calls for the condition where the average signal for a given probe set was higher, and a false discovery rate cut-off of 1% based on significance analysis of microarrays (v2.20) analysis of the data set (23Tusher V.G. Tibshirani R. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (9648) Google Scholar). Genes satisfying these criteria were categorized using COGs (clusters of orthologous groups) (23Tusher V.G. Tibshirani R. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (9648) Google Scholar, 24Tatusov R.L. Koonin E.V. Lipman D.J. Science. 1997; 278: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (2715) Google Scholar). Hypergeometric distribution was used to identify significantly overrepresented COGs. Bacterial genes whose expression changed at P17 compared with P30 or vice versa were also searched against (i) the CAZy data base to identify enzymatic activities related to polysaccharide metabolism and (ii) MetaCyc (25Caspi R. Foerster H. Fulcher C.A. Hopkinson R. Ingraham J. Kaipa P. Krummenacker M. Paley S. Pick J. Rhee S.Y. Tissier C. Zhang P. Karp P.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) to place genes onto known metabolic and signaling pathways. GeneChip Profiling of B. thetaiotaomicron during Growth in Vitro—An overnight 10-ml culture of B. thetaiotaomicron, grown in an aqueous solution of 10% tryptone (Becton Dickinson Co.) and 1.9 μm hematin (Sigma), was introduced into the 1.2-liter reaction vessel of a Bioflo 110 batch culture fermentor (New Brunswick Scientific) containing 800 ml of the same 10% tryptone medium. The bacteria were then incubated at 37 °C with agitation at 100 rpm under an atmosphere of 20% CO2, 80% N2 (sparged at 0.1 liter/min). During mid-log phase (A600 = 0.3), lactose, glucose, or galactose was added to a final concentration of 0.2%. Aliquots of the culture (10 ml) were removed immediately before and 60 min after carbohydrate addition and placed in RNAprotect. Bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation (3,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C), and the samples were prepared for hybridization to B. thetaiotaomicron GeneChips as above (1Sonnenburg J.L. Xu J. Leip D.D. Chen C.H. Westover B.P. Weatherford J. Buhler J.D. Gordon J.I. Science. 2005; 307: 1955-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). Biochemical Assays of Cecal Contents—Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of cecal contents was carried out as detailed in Ref. 1Sonnenburg J.L. Xu J. Leip D.D. Chen C.H. Westover B.P. Weatherford J. Buhler J.D. Gordon J.I. Science. 2005; 307: 1955-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar. Other biochemical assays were conducted on cecal contents that had been freeze-dried and resuspended in 400 μl of ice-cold buffer containing 0.2 m NaOH and 1mm EDTA. Aliquots (80 μl) of this mixture were removed, and an alkaline extract was prepared by incubation at 80 °C for 20 min, followed by placement on ice and neutralization (80 μl of a solution containing 0.25 m HCl and 100 mm Tris base). An acid extract was prepared by taking another 60-μl aliquot, adding 20 μl of 0.7 m HCl, incubating the material for 20 min at 80 °C, placing the solution back on ice, and adding 40 μl of Tris Base. All of the extracts were stored at -80 °C. The levels of ATP and NADH were measured in the alkaline extracts, whereas glucose, galactose, lactose, and NAD+ were assayed in acid extracts using well established pyridine nucleotide-based enzyme cycling methods (26Passoneau J.V. Lowry O.H. Enzymatic Analysis: A Practical Guide. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1993: 85-228Crossref Google Scholar). The data are expressed relative to the protein content of the cecal sample (Bradford assay; Bio-Rad). ClustalW Analysis of SusC/SusD Paralogs—Pairs of genes encoding SusC and SusD paralogs were identified in the genome sequences of B. thetaiotaomicron VPI-5482 (17Xu J. Bjursell M.K. Himrod J. Deng S.

Immun. 2005; 73: 4253-4262Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) by performing individual BLAST searches against each genome using amino acid sequences of previously annotated SusC and SusD paralogs as queries (30Reeves A.R. Wang G.R. Salyers A.A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The low scoring hits from each search (E values between 10-4 and 10-10) were themselves used as BLAST queries to reveal more divergent putative paralogs in each genome; this process was repeated until no new paralogs were identified. Lists of putative SusC and SusD paralogs were compared for each species. Paralogs were included in a subsequent clustalW analysis based on the requirement that each had a separately predicted, adjacent partner (this process was instrumental in excluding related TonB-dependent hemin, vitamin B12, and iron-siderophore receptors from the list of putative SusC paralogs). The resulting data set included 240 paralog pairs: 102 pairs in B. thetaiotaomicron, 69 pairs in B. fragilis NCTC 9343, 65 pairs in B. fragilis YCH46, and four pairs in P. gingivalis. Multiple sequence alignments were generated for SusC and for SusD paralogs using clustalW (31Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (54908) Google Scholar). Tree determination (neighbor-joining method) and bootstrapping were performed using Paup 4.0b10 (32Swofford D.L. PAUP: Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony (and Other Methods). Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA2002Google Scholar), based on the clustalW alignment. Cladogram trees were drawn from the consensus of 100 trees that were generated for each alignment, with P. gingivalis RagA/RagB (homologs of SusC/SusD) proteins selected as arbitrary roots. Branches with bootstrap values ≥70% were retained. Comparison of the SusC and the SusD cladograms suggested that these two protein families resolve into nearly identical branches (supplemental Table S1), supporting the notion that they diverged in parallel with one another during their expansion in these genomes: 141/240 SusC paralogs (58.8%) were resolved into 24 different clades exhibiting 100% bootstrap values; 139 of these (98.6%) had SusD partners that were resolved into similar (2 of 24) or identical (22 of 24) clades in a SusD cladogram (data not shown). Because of this observation and to increase the resolving power of our cladogram analysis, the predicted amino acid sequences of each protein encoded by a given susC/susD pair were joined in silico to generate a single amino acid sequence for each pair and then entered into clustalW for neighbor-joining alignment as described above. B. thetaiotaomicron Transfer from Gnotobiotic Mothers to Their Offspring—Pregnant 10-14-week-old germ-free mice belonging to the NMRI inbred strain were inoculated with B. thetaiotaomicron on the 10th day of gestation. After they gave birth, a subset of suckling pups in each litter was sacrificed at P17. Another subset was killed at P30, after weaning to a standard autoclaved polysaccharide-rich chow diet (initiated at P20). Levels of colonization were quantified in the cecum, an anatomically distinct structure interposed between the distal small intestine and colon that allows for ready and reliable harvest of luminal contents, and in the colon. B. thetaiotaomicron colonized all of the pups surveyed. P17 pups contained 7.03 ± 1.49 × 1011 and 1.39 ± 0.38 × 1012 colony-forming units/ml of cecal and colonic contents, respectively. The corresponding values for P30 mice were 1.42 ± 0.17 × 1012 and 1.78 ± 0.43 × 1012 colony-forming units/ml (means ± S.E., n = 11 litters, 2-10 mice/litter; p < 0.01 for P17 versus P30 cecum; no significant difference (p > 0.05) for colon)). Thus, in the absence of competitors, B. thetaiotaomicron can reliably colonize the suckling mouse intestine at densities that are only slightly lower in the cecum compared with the colon. The levels of colonization in these regions of the distal gut are similar to what we have observed in adult mice who were gavaged once with the same size inoculum at 6-10 weeks of age and then sacrificed 2 or 4 weeks later (1Sonnenburg J.L.

In Vivo Transcriptional Profiling of B. thetaiotaomicron at P17 and P30—To gain insight into how B. thetaiotaomicron adapts to the cecal habitats of suckling and weaned mice, we performed whole genome transcriptional profiling of the bacterium using GeneChips containing probe sets representing 98.6% of its 4,779 predicted protein-coding genes (1Sonnenburg J.L.

RNA was isolated from cecal contents and then pooled from three to four P17 pups from each litter (pooling was necessary to obtain sufficient material) or from cecal contents harvested from individual littermates that had been allowed to live until P30. Individual RNA samples from six P30 animals, representing three different litters, and six pools of RNA from twenty-three P17 animals, representing five litters, were used as templates for synthesis of cDNA targets; each of the 12 targets was hybridized to a separate B. thetaiotaomicron GeneChip. Analysis of the resulting GeneChip data sets using significance analysis of microarrays software (23Tusher V.G. Tibshirani R. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (9648) Google Scholar) and the selection criteria described under “Experimental Procedures” identified 1,266 genes whose expression was defined as significantly different between the two ages; 583 were higher in B. thetaiotaomicron colonizing the ceca of P17 compared with P30 mice, whereas 683 were expressed at higher levels at P30 (for a list, see supplemental Table S2). Differentially expressed genes were then grouped according to their COG assignments (supplemental Fig. S1). By comparing the percentage representation of the groups of regulated genes in a given COG, with the percentage representation all B. thetaiotaomicron genes in that COG, we determined that four COGs were significantly “overrepresented” among genes that were differentially expressed in either condition (p < 0.05). “Translation” (COG J) was the most ov"
https://openalex.org/W2166715647,"Mast cells (MCs) have recently been reported to play a pivotal role in the elicitation of inflammatory reactions that are beneficial to the host, e.g., during innate immune responses to bacteria. To explore whether MCs also contribute to wound repair, we studied experimentally induced skin wounds in MC-deficient Kit(W)/Kit(W-v) mice, normal Kit+/+ mice, and MC-reconstituted Kit(W)/Kit(W-v) mice. Wound closure was significantly impaired in the absence of MCs during the first 6 days of wound healing and histomorphometric analyses of MC degranulation at the wound edges revealed distance-dependent MC activation, i.e., MC degranulation was most prominent directly adjacent to the wound. In addition, Kit(W)/Kit(W-v) mice showed impaired extravasation and recruitment of neutrophils to the wounded areas. Notably, wound closure, extravasation, and neutrophil recruitment were found to be normal in MC-reconstituted Kit(W)/Kit(W-v) mice. Therefore, we examined whether MCs promote wound healing by releasing histamine or TNF-alpha. Interestingly, wound closure was reduced in mice treated with an H1-receptor antagonist but not after treatment with an H2-receptor antagonist or in the absence of TNF-alpha. Taken together, our findings indicate that MC activation and histamine release are required for normal cutaneous wound healing."

To understand the role of mitochondria in this metabolism, metabolic fluxes were determined in developing embryos of Brassica napus. After labeling with [1,2-13C2]glucose + [U-13C6]glucose, [U-13C3]alanine, [U-13C5]glutamine, [15N]alanine, (amino)-[15N]glutamine, or (amide)-[15N]glutamine, the resulting labeling patterns in protein amino acids and in fatty acids were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.

Labeling information from experiments using different labeled substrates was essential for model validation and reliable flux estimation. The resulting flux map shows that mitochondrial metabolism in these developing seeds is very different from that in either heterotrophic or autotrophic plant tissues or in most other organisms: (i) flux around the tricarboxylic acid cycle is absent and the small fluxes through oxidative reactions in the mitochondrion can generate (via oxidative phosphorylation) at most 22% of the ATP needed for biosynthesis; (ii) isocitrate dehydrogenase is reversible in vivo; (iii) about 40% of mitochondrial pyruvate is produced by malic enzyme rather than being imported from the cytosol; (iv) mitochondrial flux is largely devoted to providing precursors for cytosolic fatty acid elongation; and (v) the uptake of amino acids rather than anaplerosis via PEP carboxylase determines carbon flow into storage proteins.

Directly or indirectly plant seeds provide most of the food consumed by humans. Although the metabolism of developing seeds has been extensively studied, quantitative understanding of fluxes through central metabolism is still quite limited. Brassica napus (canola, oilseed rape) is a major oil crop and is amenable to detailed quantitative flux analysis under conditions that closely mimic in planta seed development (1Schwender J. Ohlrogge J.B. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 347-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The main storage compounds in seeds of B. napus are oil (triacylglycerols) and proteins, which are synthesized by the developing embryo from sugars and amino acids taken up from the surrounding endosperm liquid. Developing seeds of B. napus have also been the subject of numerous biochemical studies and are a model for oil accumulating seeds (2Singal H.R. Sheoran I.S. Singh R.

Goffman F. Ohlrogge J.B. Shachar-Hill Y. Nature. 2004; 432: 779-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). However, a detailed description of fluxes through mitochondrial metabolism in B. napus or other developing seeds is lacking. Several functions of mitochondrial metabolism known in plants could be quantitatively relevant for seed development in B. napus. In root tips and cell suspension cultures substantial flux around the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle results in more than 20% of all the glucose carbon entering catabolism being oxidized to CO2 (calculated from data in Refs. 18Dieuaide-Noubhani M.

This suggests that most of the cellular ATP is generated by oxidative phosphorylation driven by the oxidation of acetyl-CoA in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. In developing seeds this metabolism could likewise provide much of the ATP that is needed in substantial quantities for the synthesis of storage proteins and oil. In addition, the cytosolic elongation of oleic acid (C18:1) to C20:1 and C22:1 fatty acids in developing seeds requires mitochondrial citrate as a precursor (1Schwender J. Ohlrogge J.B. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 347-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 20Fatland B.L. Ke J. Anderson M.D. Mentzen W.I. Cui L.W. Allred C.C. Johnston J.L. Nikolau B.J. Wurtele E.S.

This demand could be large since in many Brassica species erucic acid (C22:1) is the most abundant fatty acid stored in the seed. Furthermore, in leaves and roots mitochondrial conversion of OAA and Pyr to KG is essential to primary nitrogen assimilation. Because developing embryos receive glutamine and other amino acids from the mother plant, it is unclear how their mitochondria are involved in amino acid metabolism. Finally, in leaves mitochondria carry large fluxes through the photorespiratory pathway (22Krömer, S.Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 46: 45-70Crossref Scopus (352) Google Scholar). However, photorespiration does not occur in B. napus embryos (1Schwender J. Ohlrogge J.B. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 347-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) probably because of high CO2 and low oxygen concentrations (17Goffman F.D. Alonso A.P. Schwender J. Ohlrogge J.B.

Plant Physiol. 2003; 133: 2048-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Building on our earlier studies on central carbon metabolism in B. napus embryos (1Schwender J. Ohlrogge J.B. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 347-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 14Schwender J. Ohlrogge J.B. Shachar-Hill Y. J. Biol.

Nature. 2004; 432: 779-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), this study focuses on the quantification of fluxes through mitochondrial metabolism and their integration with the major fluxes of de novo fatty acid synthesis in plastids and fatty acid elongation in the cytosol. The resulting map of mitochondrial fluxes shows that mitochondrial metabolism in developing B. napus embryos differs fundamentally from that described for other eukaryotic cells. Chemicals—d-[1,2-13C2]Glucose, d-[U-13C6]glucose, l-[U-13C5]Gln, l-(amide)-[15N]Gln and l-(amino)-[15N]Gln (all 99% 13C or 15N abundance) were purchased from Isotec (Miamisburg, OH). l-[U-13C3]Ala and l-15N-Ala were from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA). Embryo Culture—Oilseed rape plants (B. napus L., cv. Reston) were grown as described previously (1Schwender J. Ohlrogge J.B. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 347-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 14Schwender J. Ohlrogge J.B. Shachar-Hill Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29442-29453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Siliques were harvested 20 days after flowering, and embryos at the early stage of oil accumulation (0.5–1 mg of FW) were immediately dissected under aseptic conditions and transferred into a liquid culture medium with inorganic nutrients (1Schwender J. Ohlrogge J.B. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 347-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), 20% polyethylene glycol 4000, and carbon and nitrogen sources sucrose (80 mm), Glc (40 mm), Gln (35 mm), and Ala (10 mm). Embryos were grown for 14 days in 5 ml of growth medium in 250-ml Erlenmeyer flasks closed with cotton plugs under low light conditions (21 °C, continuous light of 50 μmol m–2 s–1). Embryos of 5 mg of FW doubled in weight in 50 ± 11 h (n = 5). For 13C labeling, isotopes were selected to increase the sensitivity of flux determinations as described by Schwender et al. (15Schwender J. Ohlrogge J.B. Shachar-Hill Y. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2004; 7: 309-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) following principles outlined by Mollney et al. (24Mollney M. Wiechert W. Kownatzki D. de Graaf A.A. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1999; 66: 86-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Glucose, Ala, or Gln were replaced with [1,2-13C2]glucose/[U-13C6]glucose (1:1 mol/mol ratio), [U-13C3]Ala, or [U-13C5]Gln (1:1 (mol/mol) mixture with unlabeled Gln), respectively. In addition to 13C labeling, experiments using (amide)-[15N]Gln, (amine)-[15N]Gln, or [15N]Ala were performed to assess the contribution of Gln and Ala to protein synthesis independently from the 13C experimental results as well to assess the exchange of 15N label between proteinogenic amino acids by transaminase activity (see supplemental text (section 4.2)). Extraction of Lipids and Proteins—Embryos were collected, frozen immediately, and kept at –20 °C until extraction. Embryos were ground in a glass tissue grinder at 4 °C and proteins were extracted in a buffer containing sodium phosphate, pH 7.5 (10 mm), and NaCl (500 mm, 1). Storage lipids were extracted by adding hexane/diethylether (1:1, v/v) during protein extraction. Extracted proteins were precipitated by the addition of 0.10 volume of 50% trichloroacetic acid. Derivatization of Lipids and Proteinogenic Amino Acids—After extraction, lipids were reduced under hydrogen (platinum-IV-oxide), and the saturated fatty acids were transesterified to form methyl esters as described previously (14Schwender J. Ohlrogge J.B. Shachar-Hill Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29442-29453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Proteins were hydrolyzed in 6 n HCl, and the amino acids were derivatized to N,O-tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBS) derivatives as described previously (14Schwender J. Ohlrogge J.B. Shachar-Hill Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29442-29453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Measurement of Labeling in Lipids and Amino Acids by GC-MS—Fatty acid methyl esters and TBS amino acids were analyzed with a HP 5890 II (Hewlett-Packard) gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (HP 5972 quadrupole MS). The carrier gas was helium at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. DB23 and DB1 columns (30 m × 0.25 mm; J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA) were used for analyzing fatty acid methyl esters and TBS amino acids, respectively. The relative abundance of mass isotopomers in selected fragments of each analyzed derivative was measured using selected ion monitoring (14Schwender J. Ohlrogge J.B. Shachar-Hill Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29442-29453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Correction for the occurrence of 13C in derivative parts of the molecules and for heavy isotopes in heteroatoms (carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, silicon) at their natural abundances was performed as described earlier (14Schwender J. Ohlrogge J.B. Shachar-Hill Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29442-29453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). MS measurements from three injections and analyses from each sample were averaged. For saturated fatty acid methyl esters the McLafferty fragment (m/z 74) was analyzed to determine the fractional labeling in the fragment comprising carbons one and two of each fatty acid (14Schwender J. Ohlrogge J.B. Shachar-Hill Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29442-29453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Glycerol remaining from the transesterification of lipids was analyzed as the trifluoroacetic acid ester (14Schwender J. Ohlrogge J.B. Shachar-Hill Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29442-29453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Glucose was released from starch by hydrolysis and analyzed as Glc methoxime penta-acetate (14Schwender J. Ohlrogge J.B. Shachar-Hill Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29442-29453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). For each GC-MS chromatogram of amino acid derivatives 136 mass isotopomer fractions were recorded, whereas for fatty acid methyl esters, glycerol, and glucose derivatives 29 mass isotopomer fractions were monitored. Computer-assisted Flux Estimation Using Labeling and Biomass Constraints—Flux analysis of central metabolism was based on the labeling signatures measured in metabolic end products, considering that the carbon atoms incorporated into amino acids and fatty acids can be traced back to the structures of a number of central intermediates (see supplemental text (section 1.2)). A biochemical reaction network of central carbon metabolism was derived from the literature that describes enzymes of central metabolism in B. napus embryos (see supplemental text (section 1.3)) as well as from the biochemical pathway data base for Arabidopsis (AraCyc). Implementation of the isotopomer model, isotopomer balancing, flux parameter fitting, and statistical analysis were performed using the software package 13CFLUX obtained from Dr. W. Wiechert (Department of Simulation, University of Siegen, Germany; see Ref. 25Wiechert W. Mollney M. Petersen S. de Graf A.A. Metab. Eng. 2001; 3: 265-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar and referencess cited therein). In applying the modeling software the flux values in central metabolism were constrained by: 1) the topology of the metabolic network and its stoichiometric relations at metabolic steady state; 2) assuming irreversibility of particular reactions according to the thermodynamics of the reaction; 3) the biomass composition of the embryos, which defines the net fluxes of metabolites into amino acid and fatty acid synthesis (mass balancing); 4) the results of 15N labeling experiments, which quantified the reversibilities of Ala and Glu aminotranferases; and 5) the measured 13C labeling patterns in metabolites from independent labeling experiments using [1,2-13C2]glucose/[U-13C6]glucose, [U-13C5]Gln and [U-13C3]Ala, respectively. By varying the values for the 17 freely variable fluxes in the system a best fit between predicted and measured mass isotopomer abundances was obtained by minimizing the sum of squared differences. The reliability of the flux estimates was tested by starting the flux parameter fitting process 100 times independently with starting values for the free flux parameters randomly chosen within the feasible flux space. Further details of the flux estimations are described under “Results” and in the supplemental text (section 4). Statistical Analysis—Using the 13CFlux statistical software tool, the S.D. values for the flux values (see Table 1) were derived from the S.D. values of the biomass and MS measurements. As the MS data from three independent 13C labeling experiments ([1,2-13C2]glucose/[U-13C6]glucose, [U-13C5]Gln, and [U-13C3]Ala) were combined in the model, the biological and analytical variability resulting from triplication of the labeling experiment are present in the data set. However, since the three different labeling patterns cannot be directly averaged, values for the S.D. in the MS measurements were estimated as detailed in the supplemental text (section 5.2), and S.D. in the fluxes calculated on this basis (Table 1).TABLE 1Values of net and exchange fluxes (±S.D.) for B. napus embryos as derived by flux parameter fitting using the fractional enrichment in amino acids, carbohydrate, and fatty acids of 13C and 15N labeling experimentsFluxesFlux nameReactionEnzyme name(s)/commentNet fluxExchange fluxnmol h-1 mg FW-1vuptGlcGlc uptakeUptake of glucose and sucrose from medium58.3 ± 4.2vuptAlaAla uptakeUptake of Ala from medium7.4 ± 0.7vuptGlnGln uptakeUptake of Gln from medium4.3 ± 0.3vPGM3-PGA → PEPPhosphoglyceromutase, enolase (plastidic plus cytosolic fluxes combined)83 ± 8.3vPKcPEP → PyrcytCytosolic pyruvate kinase17.9 ± 2.0vPKplPEP → PyrplPlastidic pyruvate kinase60.0 ± 6.5vPyr1Pyrcyt → PyrplTransport of pyruvate into plastids21.0 ± 2.6vPyr2Pyrcyt → PyrmitTransport of pyruvate into mitochondria3.5 ± 0.3vPDHplPyrpl → AcCoAplPlastidic pyruvate dehydrogenase complex77.0 ± 8.9vAATAlacyt → PyrcytAla:KG aminotransferase6.6 ± 0.7190aValues were determined by [15N]Ala labeling experiments (see supplemental text (section 4.2)).

Open table in a new tab Based on the range of values for the S.D. observed in the MS measurement data in comparable labeling experiments the χ2 value is >35 (see supplemental text (section 5.2)). The χ2 test for goodness of fit is expected to pass since 131 is the maximal allowed value for χ2 on a 90% significance level. In addition, the robustness of the system was tested by removal of 13 of the 164 MS measurements from the data set, causing 50% of the χ2 error. With the reduced data set flux parameter fitting still consistently converged to the same solution (see supplemental text (section 4.2)). This demonstrates the robustness of the model achieved by overdetermination. Therefore we judge the model predictions (flux values, Table 1) to reasonably explain the experimental data. Design and Validation of the Flux Model—The following reactions were tested in the model to determine whether they improved the agreement between measured and model-predicted labeling levels or if they led to uncertainties in the routes of metabolic flux: 1) isocitrate lyase together with malate synthase, defining a glyoxylate bypass; 2) malic enzyme as a reversible reaction; 3) export of plastidic AcCoA into the cytosol. In each case flux parameter fitting consistently assigned very small fluxes to the added reactions and the quality of the fit was not increased by their inclusion (data not shown). Similarly, flux through reactions of gluconeogenesis (conversion of OAA to PEP) could be excluded based on labeling in metabolites made from OAA and PEP. The transformation of glycolate to serine, which carries a very high flux in leaf mitochondria during light respiration (22Krömer, S.Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 46: 45-70Crossref Scopus (352) Google Scholar), is not a significant flux in developing B. napus embryos (1Schwender J. Ohlrogge J.B. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 347-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). As outlined in the results section, the reversibility of isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH) was included based on fitting and further experiments. Consideration of Alternative Compartmentation—In some cases there are alternative pathways that would produce identical labeling signatures in end metabolites. In the flux model ICDH was assumed to be mitochondrial, although cytosolic and plastidic isoenzymes exist in plants (26Galvez S. Galdal P. Plant Sci. 1995; 105: 1-14Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Similarly, the conversion of KGmit to Succmit is assumed to be performed by mitochondrial KG-DH. However this conversion could also take place via the GABA shunt, as assumed by Sriram et al. (27Sriram G. Fulton D.B. Iyer V.V. Peterson J.M. Zhou R. Westgate M.E. Spalding M.H. Shanks J.V. Plant Physiol. 2004; 136: 3043-3057Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) for soybean embryos. The labeling of the product succinate via the two alternative routes would be identical and they cannot be distinguished based on the labeling data of this study or of Sriram et al. (27Sriram G. Fulton D.B. Iyer V.V. Peterson J.M. Zhou R. Westgate M.E. Spalding M.H. Shanks J.V. Plant Physiol. 2004; 136: 3043-3057Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Experimental Strategy—Previous studies of in vivo flux in plant central carbon metabolism using steady-state stable isotope labeling have been based almost exclusively on [13C]glucose or [13C]sucrose feeding, generally using a single labeled substrate. Our previous studies showed that because of the complexities introduced by the subcellular compartmentation of metabolism, experiments using only [13C]glucose or [13C]sucrose have limited ability to determine several key mitochondrial fluxes. Therefore, to obtain reliable flux measurements, embryos were labeled in separate experiments with [U-13C3]alanine, [U-13C5]glutamine, [15N]alanine, (amino)-[15N]glutamine, or (amide)-[15N]glutamine in addition to [1,2-13C2]glucose + [U-13C6]glucose. After each labeling experiment, protein and oil were extracted, hydrolyzed, and analyzed by GC-MS to determine fractional 13Cor 15N enrichments for selected fragment ions. With labeling patterns obtained from the different 13C label experiments, best-fit values for the metabolic fluxes were derived using computer-assisted modeling (see “Experimental Procedures” and supplemental text (section 2)). The strategy of combining data from experiments with different labeled precursors increased the reliability and accuracy of the flux determinations. Unbiased flux parameter fitting consistently converged to one best fit only if the labeling data derived from the three 13C labeling experiments (using [1,2-13C213]glucose + [U-C6]glucose, [U-13C3]alanine, or [U-13C5]glutamine) and 15N labeling experiments were combined. For the reactions of mitochondrial metabolism statistical accuracy was increased by the combined data. For example, if only the data from [13C]glucose labeling is considered, the standard deviations for the net fluxes vME, vICDH, vGAT, vPyr2, and vPEPC (Table 1) were determined to be 57, 454, 29, 27, and 38% of the flux value, respectively (see supplemental text (section 4.3)). However, with the combined labeling data these S.D. values were reduced to 14%, 216, 12, 9, and 10%, respectively. Overall 30 out of 31 net fluxes were determined with a confidence of better than ± 20% of their value. The reversibility of the isocitrate dehydrogenase reaction (see below) was unambiguously identified only after labeling with [U-13C5]Gln. In addition, and importantly for model validation, the interconversion of amino acids and their corresponding α-keto acids (e.g. Pyr/Ala, KG/Glu) was assessed by 15N labeling experiments. Flux parameter fitting consistently converged to unique solutions for most free net fluxes. However, for the import of pyruvate into the plastid (vPyr1) more detailed inspection of independent sets of optimized flux values revealed that the isotopomer model explains the MS data equally well with different combinations of the reversible interconversion of Alac and pyruvatec (vAATXCH) and vPyr1 (see Fig. 1) and that these fluxes cannot be resolved by 13C data alone. Therefore, since vAATXCH exchanges amino groups by transamination, it was assessed based on the results of labeling with 15N-Ala and 15N-Gln. The steady state equations for the α-nitrogen of cytosolic Ala (in protein) were derived by applying isotopic steady state and the stoichiometry shown in Fig. 1. vAATXCHvuptAla=(%[15N]Alamedium)−(%[15N]Alaprotein)(%[15N]Alaprotein)−(%[15N]Proprotein)(Eq. 1) Using Equation 1 and the 15N measurements shown in supplemental Table S7a, the value for vAATXCH was determined as 25.8 ± 11.4 times the input flux of alanine (vuptAla), which corresponds to essentially complete isotopic equilibration between cy"
https://openalex.org/W2070425044,"Phosphorylation of the conserved lipin Pah1p/Smp2p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was previously shown to control transcription of phospholipid biosynthetic genes and nuclear structure by regulating the amount of membrane present at the nuclear envelope (Santos-Rosa, H., Leung, J., Grimsey, N., Peak-Chew, S., and Siniossoglou, S. (2005) EMBO J. 24, 1931-1941). A recent report identified Pah1p as a Mg2+-dependent phosphatidate (PA) phosphatase that regulates de novo lipid synthesis (Han G.-S., Wu, W. I., and Carman, G. M. (2006) J. Biol. Chem. 281, 9210-9218). In this work we use a combination of mass spectrometry and systematic mutagenesis to identify seven Ser/Thr-Pro motifs within Pah1p that are phosphorylated in vivo. We show that phosphorylation on these sites is required for the efficient transcriptional derepression of key enzymes involved in phospholipid biosynthesis. The phosphorylation-deficient Pah1p exhibits higher PA phosphatase-specific activity than the wild-type Pah1p, indicating that phosphorylation of Pah1p controls PA production. Opi1p is a transcriptional repressor of phospholipid biosynthetic genes, responding to PA levels. Genetic analysis suggests that Pah1p regulates transcription of these genes through both Opi1p-dependent and -independent mechanisms. We also provide evidence that derepression of phospholipid biosynthetic genes is not sufficient to induce the nuclear membrane expansion shown in the pah1Δ cells. Phosphorylation of the conserved lipin Pah1p/Smp2p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was previously shown to control transcription of phospholipid biosynthetic genes and nuclear structure by regulating the amount of membrane present at the nuclear envelope (Santos-Rosa, H., Leung, J., Grimsey, N., Peak-Chew, S., and Siniossoglou, S. (2005) EMBO J. 24, 1931-1941). A recent report identified Pah1p as a Mg2+-dependent phosphatidate (PA) phosphatase that regulates de novo lipid synthesis (Han G.-S., Wu, W. I., and Carman, G. M.

Genetic analysis suggests that Pah1p regulates transcription of these genes through both Opi1p-dependent and -independent mechanisms. We also provide evidence that derepression of phospholipid biosynthetic genes is not sufficient to induce the nuclear membrane expansion shown in the pah1Δ cells. Over the years there has been significant progress in understanding the mechanisms by which proteins are targeted and assembled into the various intracellular compartments. Despite this, little is still known about how eukaryotic cells regulate the growth of membrane-bound organelles. Homeostatic mechanisms must be in place to ensure that organelles grow in size or in number before cell division. Similar mechanisms must operate during development when certain organelles undergo dramatic morphological changes to perform their specialized function in differentiated tissues (1Nunnari J. Walter P. Cell. 1996; 84: 389-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 2Warren G. Wickner W. Cell. 1996; 84: 395-400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). A defining organelle of eukaryotic cells is the nucleus. The intranuclear compartment is delimited by the nuclear envelope and consists of a double lipid bilayer, the outer and the inner nuclear membrane (3Hetzer M.W. Walther T.C. Mattaj I.W. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 347-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The outer nuclear membrane is physically and functionally linked to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), 2The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PA, phosphatidic acid; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; DAG, diacylglycerol; Cdk, cyclin dependent kinase; PtA, protein A; RT, reverse transcriptase; HAD, haloacid dehalogenase; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; MS, mass spectroscopy; GFP, green fluorescent protein; ESI, electrospray ionization; IMAC, immobilized metal affinity chromatography. whereas the inner nuclear membrane faces the nucleoplasm and in metazoans is covered by the nuclear lamina. Dynamic changes in the structure of the nuclear envelope are essential for the proper execution of nuclear division in all eukaryotes. In metazoan cells the nuclear envelope breaks down during mitosis, whereas yeast undergo “closed mitosis,” where the spindle separates the chromosomes within the confines of an intact nucleus that partitions between mother and daughter cell (4Prunuske A.J. Ullman K.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 108-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). How the membrane is targeted and incorporated into the nuclear envelope and how the nucleus expands to accommodate changes in chromatin condensation and content during the cell cycle are fascinating but still unanswered questions. Cell-free assays suggest that nuclear membrane expansion and nuclear growth takes place via homotypic fusion of vesicles with the outer nuclear membrane (3Hetzer M.W. Walther T.C. Mattaj I.W. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 347-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 5Newport J.W. Wilson K.L. Dunphy W.G. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2247-2259Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 6Zhang C. Clarke P.R. Science. 2000; 288: 1429-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 7Hetzer M. Meyer H.H. Walther T.C. Bilbao-Cortes D. Warren G. Mattaj I.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1086-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). It is not clear however whether nuclear growth in vivo depends on vesicle fusion. Because the outer nuclear membrane is continuous with the ER, the major site of phospholipid biosynthesis in eukaryotic cells, an alternative possibility is that nuclear growth results from lateral flow of ER membranes into the nuclear envelope. Phospholipid homeostasis in yeast is regulated primarily by the concentration of the essential phospholipid precursor inositol (8Henry S.A. Patton-Vogt J.L. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 133-179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Carman G.M. Henry S.A. Prog. Lipid Res. 1999; 38: 361-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The presence of inositol in the medium promotes biosynthesis of PI at the expense of PA. As PA levels fall, the PA-binding protein Opi1p translocates from the ER into the nucleus (10Loewen C.J. Gaspar M.L. Jesch S.A. Delon C. Ktistakis N.T. Henry S.A. Levine T.P. Science. 2004; 304: 1644-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) where it represses transcription of many genes encoding phospholipid, fatty acid, and sterol biosynthetic enzymes (8Henry S.A. Patton-Vogt J.L. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 133-179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Carman G.M. Henry S.A. Prog. Lipid Res. 1999; 38: 361-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Conversely, low levels of inositol result in derepression of transcription by allowing a complex consisting of the basic helix-loop-helix proteins Ino2p and Ino4p to induce transcription of the phospholipid biosynthetic genes that contain a UASINO element (called also ICRE) (11Hoshizaki D.K. Hill J.E. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4736-4745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Nikoloff D.M. McGraw P. Henry S.A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 230-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Because phospholipids are key structural components of intracellular membrane compartments, their biosynthesis must be also coordinated with the cellular needs for organellar biogenesis. Phospholipid biosynthesis in yeast is transcriptionally induced in response to the need for more ER membrane during the unfolded protein response (14Cox J.S. Chapman R.E. Walter P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1805-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), indicating that lipid metabolism is coordinated with ER growth. In mammals, enforced expression of the transcription factor activated during the unfolded protein response increases the activity of enzymes involved in PC biosynthesis and causes expansion of the ER (15Sriburi R. Jackowski S. Mori K. Brewer J.W. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Using genetic approaches in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we have previously identified a network of three genes that regulate nuclear membrane growth: SPO7, NEM1, and PAH1 (SMP2) 3SMP2 has been renamed PAH1 (18Han G.-S. Wu W.I. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9210-9218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). We, therefore, now use the new names PAH1, Pah1p, and pah1Δ instead of SMP2, Smp2p, and smp2Δ. (16Siniossoglou S. Santos-Rosa H. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6449-6464Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 17Santos-Rosa H. Leung J. Grimsey N. Peak-Chew S. Siniossoglou S. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1931-1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Nem1p and Spo7p form a transmembrane phosphatase complex that localizes to the nuclear membrane and ER and dephosphorylates Pah1p (Smp2p)3 (17Santos-Rosa H. Leung J. Grimsey N. Peak-Chew S. Siniossoglou S. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1931-1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Deletion of PAH1 or loss of its dephosphorylated form by deletion of NEM1-SPO7 causes transcriptional up-regulation of ER enzymes involved in phospholipid biosynthesis, proliferation of the nuclear membrane, and a massive expansion of the nucleus (17Santos-Rosa H. Leung J. Grimsey N. Peak-Chew S. Siniossoglou S. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1931-1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Deletion of INO2 or overexpression of OPI1 restores normal nuclear morphology in nem1Δ, spo7Δ, and pah1Δ (smp2Δ)3 mutants, suggesting that de novo phospholipid biosynthesis is necessary for nuclear growth (17Santos-Rosa H. Leung J. Grimsey N. Peak-Chew S. Siniossoglou S. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1931-1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which Pah1p controls nuclear membrane biogenesis and the role of phosphorylation in this process is not understood. However, a recent study reported that Pah1p is a Mg2+-dependent PA phosphatase enzyme and that the pah1Δ mutants display a 2-fold increase of intracellular PA levels and reduced amounts of DAG and its derivative, triacylglycerol (18Han G.-S. Wu W.I. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9210-9218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The pah1Δ mutant also shows a decrease in PC and increases in PE and PI, indicating that Pah1p plays a role in phospholipid synthesis (18Han G.-S. Wu W.I. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9210-9218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Pah1p contains a conserved N-lipin domain of unknown function (19Peterfy M. Phan J. Xu P. Reue K. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) and a HAD-like domain with a DXDXT motif found in a superfamily of Mg2+-dependent phosphatases (18Han G.-S. Wu W.I. Carman G.M. J.

In this paper we address the role of phosphorylation in the regulation of Pah1p function. We find that Pah1p is phosphorylated on seven residues matching the minimal Cdk consensus. A mutant containing a phosphorylation-deficient Pah1p exhibits reduced induction of phospholipid biosynthetic genes in response to inositol depletion and shows a strong inositol auxotrophy when overexpressed. The same mutant exhibits increased Mg2+-dependent PA phosphatase activity, suggesting that the phosphorylation could lead to accumulation of PA in vivo and, therefore, impact on the transcriptional program through Opi1p. Genetic analysis shows that removal of PAH1 and OPI1 has an additive effect on the transcriptional derepression, suggesting that Pah1p may have an additional OPI1-independent role in the regulation of phospholipid biosynthetic genes. Yeast Strains, Media, and Growth Conditions—Yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. Knock-out of OPI1 in the RS453 strain and PAH1 and OPI1 in the W303 strain were done by homologous recombination using the appropriate pah1:: TRP1 or opi1::HIS3 constructs. Yeast cells were grown in YEPD or in synthetic medium containing 2% glucose lacking the appropriate amino acids for plasmid selection. GAL1/10-dependent overexpression was performed by changing the carbon source of early log phase cells from 2% raffinose to 2% galactose. MET25-dependent overexpression was performed by transferring cells from synthetic medium supplemented with 1 mm methionine (repressive conditions) to medium lacking methionine (inducing conditions). To assay growth of yeast cells in media lacking inositol, synthetic medium was prepared using yeast nitrogen base lacking inositol (Bio101).TABLE 1Yeast strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeReference/sourceRS453MATa ade2-1 his3-11,15 ura3-52 leu2-3,112 trp1-147Wimmer C.

Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) time-of-flight MS was performed using a Voyager-DE STR (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) mass spectrometer. The protein bands of interest were excised from a Coomassie Blue-stained gel, washed, alkylated, and in-gel digested with trypsin (22Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7822) Google Scholar). Phosphopeptides in the tryptic digestion mixtures were enriched with a custom made miniaturized Fe(III) immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) columns. The digest mixture was applied to an IMAC column made from GELoader tip (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) packed with Fe(III)-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (23Stensballe A. Andersen S. Jensen O.N. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 207-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The column was then washed with 5% formic acid and 10% acetonitrile, 0.1 m acetic acid. Bound peptides were eluted with 5 μl of ammonia solution (NH3, pH 10.5) followed by 5 μl of 20% acetonitrile, NH3 (pH 10.5), directly onto a MALDI target, about 1 μl/spot, and each was mixed with 0.5 μl of matrix (1 mg/ml solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 60% acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA). Phosphopeptides were also enriched with equilibrated IMAC beads (Phos-Select, Sigma). A portion of digest mixtures was incubated with Phos-Select beads in 150 μl of 30% acetonitrile/0.25 M acetic acid (wash solution) for 45 min at room temperature. The IMAC beads were then packed into a constricted GELoader tip to form a column and washed 3 times with 30 μl of wash solution. Bound peptides were eluted with 0.4 m NH3 and 20% aceonitrile/0.4 M NH3 solution, directly onto MALDI target and mixed with matrix as above. After initial MALDI-MS analysis alkaline phosphatase (AP) treatment was performed directly on the same sample spots on MALDI target. 2 μl of AP solution (0.2 units/μl in 40 mm NH4HCO3) was deposited onto each sample spot and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The buffer on the sample spots was allowed to dry at room temperature and then acidified with 0.6 μl of 2% trifluoroacetic acid before MS analysis. MALDI-MS spectra were recorded in both reflectron and linear modes for all samples before and after treatment of alkaline phosphatase. Liquid Chromatography-MS/MS—The peptides of the in-gel digest peptide mixtures were separated first by micro-column pack with anion exchange resin into three fractions, then by nanoscale liquid chromatography (LC Packings, Amsterdam, Netherlands) on a reverse phase C18 column (150 × 0.075 mm inner diameter, flow rate 0.15 μl/min). The eluate was introduced directly into a Q-STAR hybrid tandem mass spectrometer. The spectra were searched against a NCBI non-redundant data base with MASCOT MS/MS Ions search. The identity and phosphorylation sites were confirmed by manual inspection of the fragmentation series. Nanospray-MS/MS—A portion of the extracted tryptic peptides mixture was desalted and concentrated using a GELoader tip filled with Poros oligo R3 sorbent (Perseptive Biosystems). The bound peptides were eluted with 1 μl of 20% acetonitrile, 2.5% formic acid directly into a nanospray capillary and then introduced into a Q-STAR mass spectrometer. Product ion scans were carried out in positive ion mode, and a MS survey scan for peptides from m/z 400 to 1500 were measured. Selected ions were fragmented by collision-induced dissociation with nitrogen in the collision cell, and the spectra of fragment ions produced were recorded in the time-of-flight mass analyzer. Affinity Purifications of Protein A Fusions—Cells were grown to A600 = 1, washed once with water, resuspended in a 1:1 ratio with water, and injected directly into liquid nitrogen. Frozen cell pastes were ground in a mortar and pestle prechilled with liquid nitrogen. The ground cell powder was then thawed on ice. Affinity purifications of protein A fusions was performed as described by Siniossoglou et al. (16Siniossoglou S. Santos-Rosa H. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6449-6464Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Native elution of the untagged Pah1p proteins from yeast was done by tobacco etch virus protease digestion of the protein A fusions as described before (24Siniossoglou S. Lutzmann M. Santos-Rosa H. Leonard K. Mueller S. Aebi U. Hurt E.C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 41-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In vitro dephosphorylation of purified Pah1p by Nem1pPtA-Spo7p was done as described by Santos-Rosa et al. (17Santos-Rosa H. Leung J. Grimsey N. Peak-Chew S. Siniossoglou S. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1931-1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). PA Phosphatase Assays—Mg2+-dependent PA phosphatase activity was measured by following the release of water-soluble 32Pi from chloroform-soluble [32P]PA (10,000 cpm/nmol) as described by Carman and Lin (25Carman G.M. Lin Y.-P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Enzyme reactions and kinetic analysis with purified Pah1p proteins from yeast were performed as described by Han et al. (18Han G.-S. Wu W.I. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9210-9218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Kinetic data and statistical analyses were performed as described by Han et al. (18Han G.-S. Wu W.I. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9210-9218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). RNA Extractions and Quantitative RT-PCR—At least 10 absorbance units (1 A = 2.5 × 107 cells/ml) of an exponentially dividing culture (A600 between 0.4 and 0.6) grown in the appropriate medium were spun down, washed, and then snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted using a hot phenol protocol (26Kohrer K. Domdey H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 398-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). 400 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm sodium acetate, 10 mm EDTA, acetic acid buffered to pH 5), 600 μl of citrate-buffered phenol (pH 4.3), and 50 μl of 10% SDS were heated to 65 °C then added to the frozen pellet, which was then vigorously vortexed for 3 min. The sample was then cooled briefly on ice, and the organic and aqueous phases were separated by centrifugation at 16,100 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The aqueous phase was removed and re-extracted with 600 μl of citrate-buffered phenol (pH 4.3) before extraction with 1 volume of chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (24:1). The aqueous phase was then precipitated overnight with 0.1 volumes 3 m sodium acetate (pH 5.3) and 1 volume of isopropanol. The pellet was washed with 70% ethanol then re-suspended in nuclease-free water. mRNA was subsequently isolated from the sample using the Oligotex mRNA mini kit (Qiagen). For quantitative RT-PCR analysis, cDNA was synthesized using Superscript III RNase H-reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and 18-mer oligo(dT) primers (Ambion). The resulting cDNA was analyzed by real-time PCR on an ABI prism 7700 (ABI) using a SYBR green mastermix (Applied Biosystems) and primers appropriately designed for the gene of interest (sequences available upon request). A standard curve of wild-type yeast genomic DNA of known concentration, serially diluted from 1:10 to 1:100,000 was used for relative quantification of each measurement. Each sample was run in duplicate. Each measurement was normalized by dividing it by the value of an invariantly expressed gene appropriate for the level of expression (RTG2 or ACT1), then a mean was taken of the two standardized measurements. An intergenic region in chromosome V was used as a control for DNA contamination. Microscopy—To visualize the SEC63-GFP and RFP-PUS1 fusions, cells were grown in the appropriate selective medium at 30 °C to early logarithmic phase and examined with a 63× Plan Apochromat objective on a Zeiss Axiovert 200M inverted microscope with an LSM 510 confocal laser scanning attachment. Antibodies—The antibody used to detect protein A fusions was from DAKO (catalog no. Z0113). The MPM2 monoclonal antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology (catalog no. 05-368). Identification of Phosphorylation Sites on Pah1p—To identify the amino acid residues phosphorylated in Pah1p, a Pah1p-PtA fusion expressed under the control of the endogenous PAH1 promoter from a centromeric plasmid was purified from extracts of pah1Δ nem1Δ spo7Δ cells by IgG-Sepharose chromatography. The purified protein was digested with trypsin and subjected to electrospray ionization liquid chromatography-MS/MS as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Using this approach, we identified four phosphorylation sites matching the minimal Ser/Thr-Pro motif phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdk): Ser-168, Ser-602, Ser-744, Ser-748 (Fig. 1A and Table 3). The same sites were identified in parallel experiment where Pah1p-PtA was isolated from wild-type cells (data not shown). Thr-723, which fits the optimal Cdk consensus ((S/T)PX(K/R)), was identified by MALDI as a possible phosphorylation site (Tables 4 and 5). We have previously shown that deletion of the NEM1-SPO7 phosphatase causes the appearance of a second Pah1p-PtA band of reduced electrophoretic mobility (Ref. 17Santos-Rosa H. Leung J. Grimsey N. Peak-Chew S. Siniossoglou S. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1931-1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar; Fig. 1D). Substitution of Thr-723 or Ser-744 and Ser-748 with alanines abolished this mobility shift, suggesting that these phosphorylated residues are targeted by the Nem1p-Spo7p phosphatase complex in vivo.TABLE 3Phosphorylated residues of Pah1p identified by MS/MSm/z valuea2+ and 3+ indicate double- and triple-charged ions, respectivelyMassbMolecular mass of the phospho-form of peptideSequencePhosphorylated residueMethod902.4 (3+)2704.13NSETTGSLpSPTESSTTTPP (OH) DSVEERSer-168Nano-ESI719.3 (2+)1436.6TNTSMVPGpSPPNRSer-602ESI-LC-MS/MS838.4 (2+)1674.8QIYLELGpSPLApSPKSer-744, Ser-748Nano-ESI597.3 (3+)1788.9RApSSAAATSIDKEFKKSer-773ESI-LC-MS/MSa 2+ and 3+ indicate double- and triple-charged ions, respectivelyb Molecular mass of the phospho-form of peptide Open table in a new tab TABLE 4Phosphopeptides identified by linear mode MALDI-MS from Fe(III)-nitrilotriacetic acid IMAC enrichmentMH+ IMACaProtonated molecular mass of the phospho-form of peptideMH+ APbProtonated molecular mass of the dephosphorylated peptideSequenceNumber of phosphorylated residues1674.451514.33QIYLELGSPLASPK21740.261580.30RASSAAATSIDKEFK21868.961708.50RASSAAATSIDKEFKK22103.941943.92IDVSNDVHSLGNSDTESR22259.972099.87IDVSNDVHSLGNSDTESRR22784.222623.95NSETTGSLSPTESSTTTPP(OH)DSVEER23340.013100.05IDVSNDVHSLGNSDTESRREQSVNETGR33791.263630.95NVSGSTNNNEVLAASSDVENASDLVGSHSSSGSTPNK23871.823630.95NVSGSTNNNEVLAASSDVENASDLVGSHSSSGSTPNK3a Protonated molecular mass of the phospho-form of peptideb Protonated molecular mass of the dephosphorylated peptide Open table in a new tab TABLE 5Phosphopeptides identified by reflectron mode MALDI-MS from Phos Select beads enrichmentMH+ IMACaProtonated molecular mass of the phospho-form of peptideMH+ APbProtonated molecular mass of the dephosphorylated peptideSequenceNo. of phosphorylated residues1437.61421357.6771TNTSMVPGSPPNR11453.61331373.6526TNTSM(O)VPGSPPNR11661.71171581.8531RASSAAATSIDKEFK11789.89201709.9478RASSAAATSIDKEFKK12024.83561944.9265IDVSNDVHSLGNS"
https://openalex.org/W2069402380,"We have previously reported that estrogens up-regulate longevity-associated genes. As recent evidence has shown that estrogen replacement therapy is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, we have studied the effects of genistein, a soy isoflavone with a similar structure to estradiol, on the expression of antioxidant, longevity-related genes. MCF-7 cells (human mammary gland tumor cell line) were incubated for 48 h with 0.5 microM genistein, a concentration found in the plasma of populations consuming diets rich in soy protein. Peroxide levels were determined by fluorimetry, activation of extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK1/2), and nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB)-signaling pathways by Western blot analysis and ELISA, respectively, and mRNA expression of antioxidant genes by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Inhibition of basal peroxide levels in MCF-7 cells by genistein was prevented by pretreatment of cells with the estrogen receptor antagonist tamoxifen. Phosphorylation of extracellular regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 led to an activation of NFkappaB, as indicated by increased p50 subunit expression in nuclear extracts, and increased mRNA levels of the antioxidant enzyme manganese-superoxide dismutase (MnSOD). Inhibition of ERK1/2 abrogated genistein-mediated NFkappaB activation and elevated expression of MnSOD. Our molecular studies may provide a basis to determine the effects of genistein and other soy protein-derived products on longevity in both animals and the human population."

Most bacteriophytochromes work as photoactivated protein kinases. The Rhodobacter sphaeroides bacteriophytochrome BphG1 is unconventional in that it has GGDEF and EAL output domains, which are involved, respectively, in synthesis (diguanylate cyclase) and degradation (phosphodiesterase) of the bacterial second messenger c-di-GMP. The GGDEF-EAL proteins studied to date displayed either diguanylate cyclase or phosphodiesterase activity but not both. To elucidate the function of BphG1, the holoprotein was purified from an Escherichia coli overexpression system designed to produce biliverdin. The holoprotein contained covalently bound biliverdin and interconverted between the red (dark) and far red (light-activated) forms. BphG1 had c-di-GMP-specific phosphodiesterase activity. Unexpectedly for a photochromic protein, this activity was essentially light-independent. BphG1 expressed in E. coli was found to undergo partial cleavage into two species. The smaller species was identified as the EAL domain of BphG1. It possessed c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase activity. Surprisingly, the larger species lacking EAL possessed diguanylate cyclase activity, which was dependent on biliverdin and strongly activated by light. BphG1 therefore is the first phytochrome with a non-kinase photoactivated enzymatic activity. This shows that the photosensory modules of phytochromes can transmit light signals to various outputs. BphG1 is potentially the first “bifunctional” enzyme capable of both c-di-GMP synthesis and hydrolysis. A model for the regulation of the “opposite” activities of BphG1 is presented.

The genome of the anoxygenic phototrophic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1 contains two highly similar (97% identity) proteins, RSP4191 (located in plasmid 2.4.1d) and RSP4111 (located in plasmid 2.4.1c), with an unusual domain architecture (Fig. 1A). Each is composed of the PAS-GAF-PHY photosensory module, typically present in phytochromes, linked to the unconventional GGDEF-EAL output module (Fig. 1B). Phytochromes represent one of the six principal classes of photoreceptors identified thus far (1van der Horst M.A. Hellingwerf K.J. Acc. Chem. Res. 2004; 37: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). In plants, phytochromes mediate light-dependent growth and development (reviewed in Ref. 2Franklin K.A. Larner V.S. Whitelam G.C. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2005; 49: 653-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In bacteria, phytochromes regulate biosynthesis of photosynthetic and nonphotosynthetic pigments (3Giraud E.

Most phytochromes covalently bind a linear tetrapyrrole, bilin, and function as receptors of red/far red light (for a recent review, see Ref. 8Rockwell N.C. Su Y.S. Lagarias J.C. Annu. Rev.

Gärtner W. Schaffner K. Plant Cell Environ. 1997; 20: 700-706Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Phytochromes from bacteria, except for some phytochromes from cyanobacteria, bind biliverdin (BV) and are known as bacteriophytochromes (Bphs) (6Davis S.J. Vener A.V. Vierstra R.D. Science. 1999; 286: 2517-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The N-terminal photoreception modules of Bphs incorporate all features required for chromophore binding and for photoconversion. A photoreception module of a Bph is typically composed of three protein domains, PAS, GAF, and PHY. PAS and GAF are ubiquitous sensory transduction domains involved in the binding of small molecular ligands and/or in protein-protein interactions (10Zhulin I.B. Taylor B.L. Dixon R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 331-333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 11Aravind L. Ponting C.P. Trends Biochem.

Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 357-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The GAF domains of phytochromes possess bilin lyase activity required for covalent chromophore attachment (13Wu S.H. Lagarias J.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13487-13495Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Both PAS and PHY domains contribute to proper conformation of the chromophore (13Wu S.H. Lagarias J.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13487-13495Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The PAS domains of Bphs usually contain specific Cys residues, to which BV is covalently attached. In most cyanobacterial phytochromes and in plant phytochromes, the Cys residues are located in the PHY domains (14Lamparter T. Carrascal M. Michael N. Martinez E. Rottwinkel G. Abian J.

In contrast, RSP4191 and RSP4111 contain a GGDEF-EAL module. The GGDEF and EAL domains control the turnover of cyclic dimeric GMP (c-di-GMP), which functions as a ubiquitous second messenger in bacteria. c-di-GMP affects the formation and structure of bacterial biofilms, flagella- and pili-based motility, gene expression, and host-pathogen interactions (reviewed in Ref. 22Römling U. Gomelsky M. Galperin M.Y. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 529-539Crossref Scopus (554) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that R. sphaeroides can synthesize c-di-GMP (23Ryjenkov D.A. Tarutina M. Moskvin O.V. Gomelsky M. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 1792-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar); however, the functions of c-di-GMP in this organism are yet to be identified. The GGDEF domains possess diguanylate cyclase (DGC) activity; i.e. they synthesize c-di-GMP from two GTP molecules (23Ryjenkov D.A. Tarutina M. Moskvin O.V. Gomelsky M. J.

We designated RSP4191 and RSP4111, respectively, BphG1 and BphG2, where “G” stands for c-di-GMP (Fig. 1A). The BphG proteins contain GGDEF and EAL domains arranged in tandem (GGDEF-EAL). Theoretically, these proteins could possess either DGC or PDE activity or both. However, prior to this study, no proteins containing both activities have been identified. Therefore, it was unclear whether the “opposite” activities, i.e. c-di-GMP synthesis and c-di-GMP hydrolysis, could coexist in a single protein, and if they could, how they would be regulated. To gain insights into these questions, we undertook biochemical and photochemical analyses of the R. sphaeroides BphG proteins. We found that (i) similar to conventional Bphs, these proteins undergo reversible photoconversion between the Pr and Pfr forms, i.e. they are photochromic; (ii) they possess two enzymatic activities; however, only one activity is light-dependent; and (iii) they may employ an apparently unique switch between the opposite enzymatic activities. Expression Constructs—The bphG1 gene was PCR-amplified from the R. sphaeroides 2.4.1 genomic DNA using primers FbphG1-XbaI (5′-GCTCTAGAGGGTGCCTCATGACGATCTCTGGG-3′ and RbphG1-HindIII (5′-CCCAAGCTTATGATGGTGATGTTCCTTTCGTGATGCCGCGATC-3′ (restriction sites are underlined). The XbaI/HindIII-digested 2.8-kb PCR product was ligated into the NheI/HindIII-digested pET23a vector (Novagen) to yield plasmid pBphG8–10 expressing the pBphG1::His10 fusion (Fig. 1B). The 3.15-kb bphG2 fragment was PCR-amplified from the genomic DNA of the R. sphaeroides bphG1 null mutant (to be described elsewhere) using primers FbphG-XbaI and RbphH-KpnI (5′-CGGCGGGTTTCCTTGGATGATCCTTGGTACCGC-3′, where RbphH-KpnI is specific to the region downstream of bphG2. The 2.8-kb XbaI/HindIII-digested fragment containing bphG2 was cloned into pET23a to yield pBphH15 expressing pBphG2::His10. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. For BphG holoprotein expression, plasmid pPL-PCB (KmR) expressing Synechocystis sp. heme oxygenase and biliverdin reductase genes ho1 and pcyA (33Gambetta G.A. Lagarias J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10566-10571Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) was modified as follows. The pcyA gene was deleted, and the Plac/ara-1 promoter was replaced with the PT7 promoter. The transformants of Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) (pLysS) (Novagen) carrying ho1 under the PT7 promoter proved to be heterogeneous in regard to the Ho1 levels. One transformant accumulated Ho1 protein to higher levels compared with others, as judged by the light green color of the cells following induction with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and SDS-PAGE. Restriction analysis of the plasmid isolated from this strain suggested that the ho1-containing plasmid was integrated into pLysS. The resulting hybrid plasmid (KmR) expressing high levels of Ho1 was designated pT7-ho1–1. The DNA sequence of the coding region of the ho1 gene from pT7-ho1–1 remained intact, which allowed us to use this plasmid as a source of BV IXα, the product of Ho1 reaction (33Gambetta G.A. Lagarias J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10566-10571Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). pBphG8–10 and pBphH15 were transformed into BL21(DE3) (pLysS) and BL21(DE3) (pLysS; pT7-ho1–1) to produce the apo- and holoproteins, respectively. The PAS-GAF-PHY-GG-DEF fragment was PCR-amplified using primers FbphG1-XbaI and RphyGGDEF-HindIII (5′-CCCAAGCTTATGATGGTGATGTGCTC-3′) and cloned into pET23a to generate plasmid pPhyGGDEF (Fig. 1B). Protein Purification—The overnight cultures of BL21(DE3) (pLysS; pT7-ho1–1) containing the BphG1 and BphG2 constructs were grown at 25 °C in 50 ml of LB supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 25 μg/ml kanamycin, 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and 0.5% glucose. These cultures were transferred into larger flasks containing 1 liter of medium of the same composition and grown to an A600 of 0.5. Isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm to induce expression of bphG1 (or bphG2) and ho1, and growth was continued at 25 °C for an additional 7 h. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 15 min and resuspended in 20 ml of Ni2+ binding buffer (50 mm Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (Sigma), 20 mm imidazole, and 0.2 mm protease inhibitors (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, Sigma), pH 8.3. The cells were disrupted using a French pressure cell, and the resulting crude extract was sonicated. The pH of the extract was increased to 8.5 followed by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 45 min to remove cell debris. The volume of soluble extract was increased to 20 ml with Ni2+ binding buffer. Two milliliters (bed volume) of Ni2+ resin (Novagen) pre-equilibrated with Ni2+ binding buffer were added to the soluble cell extract and gently agitated for 1 h at 4°C. The mix was loaded onto a column, and the resin was washed with 140 ml of washing buffer (same as Ni2+ binding buffer plus 60 mm imidazole and minus the phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Fractions were eluted with 8 ml of elution buffer (same as Ni2+ binding buffer but 200 mm NaCl instead of 300 mm plus 250 mm imidazole and minus the phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The BphG1-containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed twice (4 h each) at room temperature against 2 liters of PDE assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 8.6). The protein solution was aliquoted and stored at –70 °C. The typical yield of the purified BphG1 holoprotein was ∼0.5 mg L–1, although the typical yield of the apoprotein was 0.1–0.15 mg L–1. The PAS-GAF-PHY-GGDEF apo- and holoproteins were purified essentially as described for the full-length BphG1 with two deviations: (i) all buffers contained 5 mm dithiothreitol, which prevented protein precipitation; (ii) the concentration of imidazole in the wash buffer was 40 mm. Spectral Analysis—Absorbance spectra were recorded with a UV-1601 PC UV-visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu) at room temperature. Protein solution (100 μl) in a 10-mm light path quartz cuvette was irradiated directly in the spectrophotometer from the top of the cuvette. The light originated from a halogen lamp (EKE 21 V 150 W, General Electric) with a flexible light guide to which optical filters were attached. The 12.5-mm diameter interference band filters (Andover Corporation) with center wavelengths of 694.3 and 767.6 nm and a 50% bandwidth of 9.8 ± 0.5 nm were used to generate red and far red light, respectively (approximate fluency 3.5 μmol m–2 s–1). Enzymatic Assays—All enzymatic assays were performed at 30 °C in a water bath. A standard reaction mixture (1 ml) contained 0.5–4.0 μm enzyme in the PDE or DGC assay buffer (23Ryjenkov D.A. Tarutina M. Moskvin O.V. Gomelsky M. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 1792-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). The protein kept in the dark was irradiated through a flexible light guide for 5 min prior to reaction with red or far red light, and the light was kept “on” for the duration of the assay. The reaction was started by the addition of 1:100 (v/v) of c-di-GMP for PDE assays or GTP for DGC assays. Aliquots (100 μl) were withdrawn at different time points, mixed with 10 μl of 0.2 m CaCl2 (PDE reactions only), and boiled for 5 min. The precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.22-μm pore size filter (Millipore) and analyzed by reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) as described earlier (23Ryjenkov D.A. Tarutina M. Moskvin O.V. Gomelsky M. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 1792-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Protein assays were performed using the BCA method (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as the protein standard. Proteins were analyzed using SDS-PAGE or the Protein 200 Plus LabChip kit on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). Chromatography—Nucleotides were separated and quantified by reversed-phase HPLC (Summit HPLC System, Dionex, CA) as described earlier (23Ryjenkov D.A. Tarutina M. Moskvin O.V. Gomelsky M. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 1792-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar) using the 15 × 4.6-cm Supelcosil LC-18-T column (Supelco). Proteins were purified and their oligomeric state was determined using a Superdex 200, 10/300 GL gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with the PDE assay buffer as described earlier (23Ryjenkov D.A. Tarutina M. Moskvin O.V. Gomelsky M. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 1792-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Mass Spectroscopy—The 31-kDa band corresponding to the protein copurified with BphG1 was purified by size exclusion chromatography and run on SDS-PAGE. The protein band was excised from the gel and sent to Proteomic Research Services, Inc. (Ann Arbor, MI) for peptide fingerprinting and protein identification. There, the protein was subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion and MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy analysis on a Voyager DE-STR instrument (Applied Biosystems). The m/z values of the trypsinolysis products were analyzed by ProFound software. R. sphaeroides BphG1 Is a Photochromic Bph—We anticipated that BphG1 and BphG2, whose sequences are almost identical, would have very similar characteristics (Fig. 1A). Therefore, we chose to characterize BphG1 and subsequently to test the key findings on BphG2. We constructed a C-terminal BphG1::His10 fusion and overexpressed it under the PT7 promoter in E. coli BL21(DE3) (pLysS). We purified the apoprotein using Ni2+ affinity chromatography followed by size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 2A, lanes 2–5). To overexpress the BphG1 holoprotein, we used BL21(DE3) (pLysS) containing a constructed plasmid, pT7-ho1–1, which expressed the Synechocystis sp. heme oxygenase gene ho1 (33Gambetta G.A. Lagarias J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10566-10571Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) and therefore produced BV (Fig. 2A, lanes 6–9). When purified, the BphG1 apoprotein was colorless, whereas the holoprotein had a blue-green color indicative of bound BV. By size exclusion chromatography, we determined that BphG1 was present in several forms, i.e. oligomers of the apparent molecular masses >443 kDa, and a presumed tetramer of the apparent mass of 390 kDa. A very small amount of BphG1 was present as an apparent monomer (92 kDa) (Fig. 2B). The UV-visible spectrum of the BphG1 holoprotein in the dark was dominated by the absorption maximum of 709 nm, characteristic of the Pr form (Fig. 3A). This suggests that Pr is the ground state of BphG1. Upon irradiation with red light (694 nm) or with white light, we observed decreased absorption at 709 nm and a new absorption maximum at 755 nm (Fig. 3A). The peak at 755 nm corresponds to the Pfr form. When the red light-irradiated BphG1 was exposed to the far red light (768 nm), the Pfr form quickly reverted to the Pr form. The difference spectrum (Pr–Pfr) was similar to the difference spectra of the Bphs that function as protein histidine kinases (3Giraud E. Fardoux J. Fourrier N. Hannibal L. Genty B. Bouyer P.

A. 2002; 99: 11628-11633Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). It is known that the photoexcited forms of many phytochromes can convert to the ground state in the dark, and so could BphG1. It converted from the Pfr to the Pr form in the dark slowly, taking ∼40 min for a 95% conversion (Fig. 3B). The PAS domain of BphG1 contains a cysteine residue, Cys-18, which is positionally conserved among Bphs and is predicted to serve as the site of BV attachment (14Lamparter T. Carrascal M. Michael N. Martinez E. Rottwinkel G. Abian J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3659-3669Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 15Tasler R. Moises T. Frankenberg-Dinkel N. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 1927-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To test whether or not BV in the BphG1 holoprotein was bound covalently, we separated the holo- and apoproteins by SDS-PAGE, stained the gel with a Zn2+ solution, and exposed it to UV light. We observed the zinc-dependent fluorescence of the holoprotein (but not the apoprotein), which indicated that BV was bound covalently (Fig. 3C). Therefore, in all respects, BphG1 behaved as a typical photochromic Bph. BphG1 Has an Essentially Light-independent c-di-GMP-specific PDE Activity—To test for enzymatic activity of BphG1, we incubated the holoprotein with GTP and c-di-GMP, which are the substrates of the DGC and PDE activities, respectively. Incubation with GTP did not result in the formation of c-di-GMP, whether the reaction was performed in the dark or light (Fig. 2C). Longer term incubation with GTP yielded some GDP and Pi (not shown), which is characteristic of the enzymatically inactive GGDEF domains (23Ryjenkov D.A. Tarutina M. Moskvin O.V. Gomelsky M. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 1792-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). The incubation of BphG1 with c-di-GMP resulted in formation of linear dimeric GMP, the expected product of the PDE reaction (Fig. 2D). No hydrolysis of cyclic mononucleotides (cAMP or cGMP) was detected (not shown). Therefore, BphG1 functions as a c-di-GMP-specific PDE. We tested the effect of irradiation on the PDE activity of the holoprotein but found no such effect. We were puzzled as to why the activity of the photochromic protein would be light-independent. Therefore, we undertook a significant effort to identify conditions where the PDE activity would show light dependence. We modified the composition and pH of the reaction buffer, varied the protein-to-substrate ratios, tested the effects of additional nucleotides on enzymatic activity, examined the light dependence of individual oligomeric forms of BphG1, purified and assayed the activity of the BphG2 holoprotein using plasmid pBphH15, replaced the Synechocystis sp. heme oxygenase with the R. sphaeroides heme oxygenase BphO1, and tested the light dependence of the BphG1-BphO1 complex. 3M. Tarutina and M. Gomelsky, unpublished data. The maximum difference in the rate of PDE reaction between the Pfr and Pr forms that we have observed was with the tetramer fraction of BphG1. However, even there the difference was marginal, i.e. ∼25%, which is unlikely to be physiologically significant (Fig. 2E). It appears that photoreception is decoupled from the output activity of BphG1. Therefore, BphG1 functions as an essentially light-independent c-di-GMP-specific PDE. The lack of light dependence prompted us to investigate the possibility that the PDE activity responds to the presence or absence of BV, which would make BphG1 a sensor of BV, not light (12Montgomery B.L. Lagarias J.C. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 357-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). To test this possibility, we compared the PDE activities of the apo- and holoforms of BphG1. These activities turned out to be very similar (Fig. 2E). The lack of BV dependence confirmed our conclusion that the PDE activity is decoupled from photoreception. This remained at odds with photochromicity of the BphG1 holoprotein until a serendipitous discovery described below revealed the light-dependent properties of BphG1, which were completely unexpected. The Protein Copurified with BphG1 Is Its EAL Domain—We noticed that an ∼31-kDa protein was copurified with BphG1 through the Ni2+ affinity chromatography, whether it was expressed as an apo- or holoprotein (Fig. 2A, lanes 4 and 8). We decided to explore the nature of the copurified protein. We separated the 31-kDa protein from BphG1 by size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 4A) and subjected it to trypsin digestion followed by peptide fingerprinting by MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy. To our surprise, the copurified protein was found to perfectly match (16 peptides matched; expectation 5 × 10–10) the sequence of BphG1. The utmost N-terminal peptide was identified as 664GELFRPSLYEETTQLVELDNDMR. It corresponds to the linker between the GGDEF and EAL domains as determined by the Pfam protein domain data base. If we assume that Gly664 is the utmost N-terminal residue in the copurified protein, then the expected size of the copurified protein would be 273 amino acids. This correlates with 31 kDa, the observed molecular mass of the copurified protein. The copurified protein is therefore composed of the linker between the GGDEF and EAL domains and the entire EAL domain. Apparently, the 97-kDa BphG1 protein undergoes partial cleavage in E. coli. The two cleavage species, 31 and 66 kDa, are visible on the overloaded SDS-PAGE gels (not shown). Knowing that EAL domains are sufficient for PDE activity (27Schmidt A.J. Ryjenkov D.A. Gomelsky M. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4774-4781Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), we tested the activity of the 31-kDa fragment. We found that it indeed retained a c-di-GMP-specific PDE activity. It is noteworthy that, on the size exclusion column, the EAL domain fragment ran with an apparent mass of 58 kDa, corresponding to that of a dimer (Fig. 4B). The apparent dimerization is"

We found that hepatic mRNA levels of key lipogenic enzymes, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty-acid synthase, and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 were increased in apoB/BATless mice compared with levels in apoB mice, suggesting increased lipogenesis in apoB/BATless mice. This was confirmed by determining incorporation of tritiated water into fatty acids.

Treatment of apoB/BATless mice for 4 weeks with intraperitoneal injections of a PPARγ antisense oligonucleotide resulted in dramatic reductions of both PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 mRNA, PPARγ2 protein, and mRNA levels of fatty-acid synthase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase. These changes were associated with decreased hepatic de novo lipogenesis and hepatic triglyceride concentrations. We conclude that hepatic steatosis in apoB/BATless mice is associated with elevated rates of hepatic lipogenesis that are linked directly to increased hepatic expression of PPARγ2.

Associated with a rising prevalence of obesity and insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis is increasing in the United States (7Browning J.D. Szczepaniak L.S. Dobbins R. Nuremberg P. Horton J.D. Cohen J.C. Grundy S.M. Hobbs H.H. Hepatology. 2004; 40: 1387-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (2955) Google Scholar). In addition to having hyperlipidemia, apoB/BATless mice are obese, insulin-resistant, and have fatty livers, providing a model for studying the molecular basis for the association between insulin resistance, VLDL secretion, and hepatic steatosis. Increased hepatic TG could result from increased TG synthesis driven by increased delivery of albumin-bound fatty acids (FA) derived from lipolysis in peripheral adipose tissue, increased hepatic uptake of triglyceride fatty acid in remnant lipoproteins, or increased de novo lipogenesis. Decreased FA oxidation in the liver could lead to accumulation of TG, even when TG synthesis and VLDL secretion are normal. In the present studies, we examined in detail the basis for the hepatic steatosis in the apoB/BATless mouse. Of note, we found increased de novo lipogenesis that was independent of both SREBP-1c (sterol-response element-binding protein 1c) (8Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (3838) Google Scholar) and carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP) (9Uyeda K. Yamashita H. Kawaguchi T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 63: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) regulation. By contrast, we confirmed prior studies demonstrating increased hepatic peroxisomal proliferator-activating receptor γ (PPARγ) gene expression and activity in mouse models of insulin resistance (10Matsusue K. Haluzik M. Lambert G. Yim S.H. Gavrilova O. Ward J.M. Brewer Jr., B. Reitman M.L. Gonzalez F.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 12Herzig S. Hedrick S. Morantte I. Koo S.H. Galimi F. Montminy M. Nature. 2003; 426: 190-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), and we also demonstrated a significant, independent role for hepatic PPARγ in the regulation of de novo hepatic lipogenesis. Animals—Congenic human apoB transgenic mice on a C57BL/6J background were generated as described (1Voyiaziakis E. Ko C. O'Rourke S.M. Huang L.S. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 2004-2012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). BATless mice (2Lowell B.B. Susulic V.S. Hamann A. Lawitts J.A. Himms-Hagen J. Boyer B.B. Kozak L.P. Flier J.S. Nature. 1993; 366: 740-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). These mice were created in the FVB/N strain by using the promoter from a BAT-specific protein, uncoupling protein-1, to drive the expression of the A-chain of diphtheria toxin only in brown adipose tissue. The breeding of heterozygous apoB mice with heterozygous BATless mice resulted in the generation of F1 mice with four possible genotypes as follows: those that expressed neither transgene (wild type controls), those that expressed the transgene for either apoB or diphtheria toxin A-chain (BATless), and those that had both transgenes (apoB/BATless). The phenotype of BATless mice is similar to that of apoB/BATless mice except that plasma TG levels are not elevated, although TG secretion rates are similar in the two groups (3Siri P. Candela N. Ko C. Zhang Y. Eusufzai S. Ginsberg H.N. Huang L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46064-46072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Furthermore, gene profiles and liver TG content are similar in male and female apoB/BATless mice despite the fact that the females are not as insulin-resistant. All mice were maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle (light cycle, 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.). Mice were weaned onto the Western type diet (number 88137; Teklad Premier Laboratory Diets, Madison, WI) containing, by calories, 42% fat (polyunsaturated/saturated = 0.07), 29% sucrose, and 0.15% (w/w) cholesterol. Plasma Biochemistries—Blood samples were obtained from the retro-orbital plexus. Total plasma TG and cholesterol concentrations were measured by colorimetric methods using commercial kits (Wako Chemicals, Richmond, VA). FA levels were measured colorimetrically using a commercial kit (number 994-75409) from Wako Chemicals (Richmond, VA). Glucose levels were measured using an enzymatic kit (number 315-100; Sigma). Determination of FA Turnover—To determine the rate of FA flux, [3H]palmitic acid (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was injected intravenously and its disappearance from plasma measured over time. The turnover of FA in plasma is known to be rapid; in fact, by 2 min after the injection of the tracer, plasma counts had decreased to 3-11% of the total injected volume. We bled the mice at 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10 min after [3H]palmitic acid injection to determine radioactivity remaining in plasma. The fractional clearance rate for palmitate was determined using a two-pool model to account for recycling of FA from the extravascular space. Determination of Liver TG Levels—Livers from the mice were collected for the measurement of hepatic TG content. Total liver lipids were extracted by a modification of the Folch method (13Folch J. Lees M. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 224: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), and TG concentration was determined by a commercial colorimetric method (Wako Chemicals, Richmond, VA). [14C]Triolein was added to each sample before lipid extraction to allow correction for recovery during the lipid extraction; final TG concentrations were adjusted accordingly. Total liver protein was extracted using T-PER™ tissue protein extraction reagent (number 78510; Pierce). A protease inhibitor mixture (number 1873580;, Roche Diagnostics) was added into the liver protein extraction reagent. Liver TG levels were expressed as milligrams of TG/g of liver protein. Measurement of Hepatic de Novo Lipogenesis—The rate of hepatic de novo lipogenesis was determined by measuring the amount of newly synthesized FA present in the liver 1 h after intraperitoneal injection of 2 mCi of 3H2O (14Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 98: 1575-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). 3H-Labeled fatty acids were isolated by saponification of liver samples in KOH. After extraction of nonsaponifiable lipids, and acidification with H2SO4, the 3H-labeled fatty acids were extracted and separated by thin layer chromatography. The plate was stained with iodine; the FA “spot” was scraped off the plate, and the isolated FA was added to scintillation fluid (Ecoscint H number LS-275; National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA) and counted in a liquid scintillation counter (LS6500 Beckman Coulter, Fullerton. CA). The specific activity of body water was determined and used to calculate de novo lipogenesis as micromoles of 3H2O incorporated into FA/h/g liver protein. Northern Blot Hybridization with cDNA Probes—Total cellular RNA (TRNA) was isolated from livers using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) following the protocol provided by the company, and Northern blot hybridization was carried out with 20 μg of RNA as described (1Voyiaziakis E. Ko C. O'Rourke S.M. Huang L.S. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 2004-2012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA probes were prepared by reverse transcription-PCR from liver TRNA of male C57BL/6J mice. PCR primers used for each probe are shown in Table 1. A mouse β-actin riboprobe (Ambion Co., Austin, TX) was used in each experiment to normalize for loading of RNA samples. For quantification, autoradiograms were scanned with a densitometer.TABLE 1Primer sequences for RPA, Northern blot probes, and real time PCRGenePrimersPrimer sequencePCR sizeGenBank™ no.Primer sequences for RNA probes of RPAFas5′5′–TCA CCA CTG TGG GCT CTG CAG AGA AGC GAG–3′330AF1270333′5′–TGT CAT TGG CCT CCT CAA AAA GGG CGT CCA–3′Pparα5′5′–GTG GCT GCT ATA ATT TGC TGT G–3′131X576383′5′–GAA GGT GTC ATC TGG ATG GTT–3′Cpt15′5′–CCA GGC TAC AGT GGG ACA TT–3′209AF017753′5′–GAA CTT GCC CAT GTC CTT GT–3′Aox5′5′–TCA ACA GCC CAA CTG TGA CTT CCA TTA–3′227AF0088883′5′–TCA GGT AGC CAT TAT CCA TCT CTT CA–3′Srebp-1c5′5′–ATC GGC GCG GAA GCT GTC GGG GTA GCG TC–3′116B16560943′5′–ACT GTC TTG GTT GTT GAT GAG CTG GAG CAT–3′Primer sequences for cDNA probes of Northern blotsAcc5′5′–GGG ACT TCA TGA ATT TGC TGA TTC TCA GTT–3′729AF1270333′5′–GTC ATT ACC ATC TTC ATT ACC TCA ATC TC–3′aP25′5′–GAC GAC AGG AAG GTG AAG AGC–3′138NM_0244063′5′–GCC TTT CAT AAC ACA TTC CAC C–3′Primer sequences for real time PCRSRBR Green Pparγ15′5′–GAG TGT GAC GAC AAG ATT TG–3′119U016643′5′–GGT GGG CCA GAA TGG CAT CT–3′ Pparγ25′5′–TCT GGG AGA TTC TCC TGT TGA–3′112NM_0111463′5′–GGT GGG CCA GAA TGG CAT CT–3′ β-Actin5′5′–GTATCCATGAAATAAGTGGTTACAGG–3′147NM_0073933′5′–GCAGTACATAATTTACACAGAAGCAAT–3′ Scd15′5′–CTGCAGGTTGTGCTAGATGGGATGG–3′198NM_0091273′5′–GCCTGGGGTCTTTGGTAAGTAGGC–3′ ChREBP5′5′–GTCCGATATCTCCGACACACTCTT–3′89NM_0214553′5′–CATTGCCAACATAAGCATCTTCTG–3′ LPK5′5′–CTTGCTCTACCGTGAGCCTC–3′122AH0022293′5′–ACCACAATCACCAGATCACC–3′TaqMan CD36ProbeFAMTCACCCCTCCAGAATCCAGACAACCABHQ63BC0102625′5′–TCCAGCCAATGCCTTTGC–3′3′5′–TGGAGAATTACTTTTTCAGTGCAGAA–3 LXRαProbeFAMTCTGCAGACCGGCCCAACGTGBHQ79AF0857455′5′–GCTCTGCTCATTGCCATCAG–3′3′5′–TGTTGCAGCCTCTCTACTTGGA–3′ Abca1ProbeFAMCGAATAGCAGGCTCCAACCCTGACCBHQ94NM_0134545′5′–GGTTTGGAGATGGTTATACAATAGTTGT–3′3′5′–CCCGGAAACGCAAGTCC–3′ β-ActinProbeJOECACTGCCGCATCCTCTTCCTCCCBHQ138NM_0073935′5′–AGAGGGAAATCGTGCGTGAC–3′3′5′–CAATAGTGATGACCTGGCCGT–3′ Open table in a new tab RNA Probe Preparation and RNase Protection Assays— TRNA was isolated from livers as described above, and ribonuclease protection assays (RPA) were performed as described previously (1Voyiaziakis E. Ko C. O'Rourke S.M. Huang L.S. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 2004-2012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The RNA probes were generated by amplification of target genes from TRNA of male C57BL/6J mouse by reverse transcription-PCR (15Ko C. O'Rourke S.M. Huang L.S. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1946-1955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). PCR primers used are shown in Table 1. Each PCR product was cloned into a PCRII vector using a TA cloning kit obtained from Invitrogen. DNA sequences of these clones were verified by DNA sequencing using an ABI 377 automatic DNA sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Quantitative Real Time PCR—Liver TRNA samples were used for cDNA synthesis with oligo(dT) primers using a commercial kit (number 11904-018) from Invitrogen. The resulting cDNA samples were then quantified for each test gene using target gene-specific primers. Quantitative real time PCR (QPCR) was done using either TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or a SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to the protocols provided by the manufacturers. Detection of specific products was performed in triplicate using the Mx4000 Multiplex Quantitative PCR system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Using the standard curve method, the relative quantitation of specific PCR products for each primer set was generated. For normalization, β-actin was amplified from each sample. The primers used for real time PCR are shown in Table 1. Mouse cyclophilin and GAPDH probes were synthesized by using antisense internal control templates (catalog numbers 7675 and 7431; Ambion). Immunoblots—Equal amounts of liver protein extracts were subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotted using standard methods. A rabbit polyclonal antibody against mouse SREBP-1, which recognizes both mature and precursor forms, was a generous gift from Dr. Jay D. Horton (University of Texas Southwestern Medical School, Dallas). To measure the level of hepatic nuclear mature form of SREBP-1, hepatic nuclear protein was prepared immediately after exsanguinations as described previously for hamster liver (16Sheng Z. Otani H. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 935-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Hepatic FAS content was estimated using anti-FAS monoclonal antibody that reacts against the mouse protein (Pharmingen). Hepatic stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) was estimated with a rabbit anti-mouse SCD polyclonal antibody that recognizes both mouse and human SCD (a generous gift from Dr. Alan Tall, Columbia University). Hepatic PPARγ protein level was measured with a mouse monoclonal antibody against the carboxyl terminus of human PPARγ, which is identical to the corresponding mouse sequence (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). For normalization, β-actin was measured with a monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody (Sigma). Lamin B antibody was a gift from Dr. Howard Worman. Gel Mobility Shift Assay—Gel mobility shift assays were performed by using consensus double-stranded oligonucleotides with the following sense strand sequences: CYP7A1 oligonucleotides that contain the mouse LXR-response element (LXRE) (5′-AGCTTGCTCTGGTCACCCAAGTTCAAGTTAC-3′) (17Tzung K.W. Ishimura-Oka K. Kihara S. Oka K. Chan L. Genomics. 1994; 21: 244-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and the mouse sterol regulatory element (SRE) in the Fas promoter (5′-CGCGCGCGGGCATCACCCCACCGACGG-3′) (18Latasa M.J. Moon Y.S. Kim K.H. Sul H.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10619-10624Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The probes were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polykinase. Gel mobility shift assays were performed using gel shift core system (Promega, Madison, WI). Hepatic nuclear proteins were prepared with a nuclear extraction kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA). Mouse SREBP2 protein, used as a positive control, was a generous gift from Dr. Timothy Osborne (University of California, Irvine). The mouse LXRα and retinoid X receptor-α proteins, used as positive controls, were generous gifts from Dr. Joyce Repa (University of Texas Southwestern Medical School, Dallas). PPARγ Antisense Oligonucleotide Experiment—An antisense nucleotide (ASO) complementary to murine PPARγ (GenBank™ accession number U09138.1), ISIS 141941, 5′-AGTGGTCTTCCATCACGGAG-3′, was injected intraperitoneally twice a week into apoB/BATless mice at the dosage of 100 mg/kg/week for 4 weeks. To demonstrate the specificity of inhibition, an in-house universal control, ISIS 141923:,5′-CCTTCCCTGAAGGTTCCTCC-3′, was injected simultaneously into a parallel group of apoB/BATless mice. The body weight and plasma lipid profile were measured before and after ASO treatment. At the end of the experiment, de novo lipogenesis, liver TG content, and mRNA levels of PPARγ1, PPARγ2, CD36, aP2, FAS, ACC, SREBP-1c, ChREBP, and LPK were determined as described above. Kupffer Cell Depletion by Liposome-encapsulated Clodronate— Liposome-encapsulated clodronate, which is known to deplete Kupffer cells, was administered intravenously on 2 consecutive days (300 μl), and livers were harvested 48 h later (19Van Rooijen N. Sanders A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 174: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (1503) Google Scholar). PBS encapsulated in multilamellar liposomes was used as the control. Sixteen mg of cholesterol (C3045; Sigma) and 172 mg of phosphatidylcholine (P3556; Sigma) were dissolved in chloroform in a round bottom flask. The chloroform was evaporated at 37 °C in a rotary evaporator under vacuum until a thin lipid film formed. Dicholoromethylene diphosphonate, 2 g (clodronate, D4434; Sigma), dissolved in 10 ml of PBS or 10 ml of PBS (to prepare empty liposomes) were added to the lipid film and shaken at 250 rpm for 30 min. The solution was sonicated for 3 min at room temperature in a water bath sonicator (50 watts). The liposomes were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h and resuspended in 8 ml of PBS. Kupffer cell depletion was assessed by liver F4/80 staining and by using QPCR to quantify F4/80 and Nramp1 mRNA. The primers were as follows: mouse F4/80, forward 5′-CTTTGGCTATGGGCTTCCAGTC-3′ and reverse 5′-GCAAGGAGGACAGAGTTTATCGTG-3′ (20Weisberg S.P. McCann D. Desai M. Rosenbaum M. Leibel R.L. A Ferrante Jr., W. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 1796-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (7562) Google Scholar); mouse Nramp 1, forward 5′-ATCCTGCCCACTGTGTTGGT-3′ and reverse 5′-GCGAAGGGCAGCAGTAGACT-3′ (21Lou D.Q. Lesbordes J.C. Nicolas G. Viatte L. Bennoun M. Van Rooijen N. Kahn A. Renia L. Vaulont S. Hepatology. 2005; 41: 1056-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Results were normalized by mRNA levels of β-actin. Statistics—All data are presented as means ± S.D. Differences in the mean values between two groups were assessed by two-tailed Student's t test. Differences in mean values among more than two groups were determined by analysis of variance. p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Male and female mice were used for all experiments except the direct measurement of lipogenesis with 3H2O, where only male mice were studied. Although female apoB/BATless mice are less insulin-resistant than male apoB/Batless mice and have lower plasma TG levels despite similar TG secretion rates (3Siri P. Candela N. Ko C. Zhang Y. Eusufzai S. Ginsberg H.N. Huang L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46064-46072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 22Siri P.W. Ginsberg H.N. Metabolism. 2003; 52: 659-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), they were otherwise identical in terms of hepatic gene expression and hepatic lipid metabolism. We have therefore presented only male data. Studies presented used mice between the ages of 12 and 30 weeks; the lipid and glucose profiles of apoB and apoB/BATless mice weaned onto a Western-type diet are stable over that period of time. In our prior study (3Siri P. Candela N. Ko C. Zhang Y. Eusufzai S. Ginsberg H.N. Huang L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46064-46072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), male apoB/BATless mice were more obese than apoB mice and were hyperinsulinemic, hypertriglyceridemic, and hypercholesterolemic; those results were recapitulated in the present studies. Thus, by about 20 weeks of age, after weaning onto a Western-type diet (see “Materials and Methods”), male apoB/BATless mice were ∼15 g heavier than male apoB mice (57.0 ± 8.7 versus 41.4 ± 4.0 g). Also consistent with our previously published results (3Siri P. Candela N. Ko C. Zhang Y. Eusufzai S. Ginsberg H.N. Huang L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46064-46072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), fasting blood analyses of 15 male apoB/BATless and 13 male apoB mice revealed hyperinsulinemia (6.7 ± 2.9 versus 1.6 ± 0.3 ng/ml), hypertriglyceridemia (206.6 ± 60.9 versus 127.0 ± 23.5 mg/dl), and hypercholesterolemia (389.6 ± 97.4 versus 332.2 ± 68.4 mg/dl) in the apoB/BATless mice. As observed previously, plasma glucose concentrations were not different in male apoB/BATless compared with male apoB mice (data not shown). A key finding in our first paper was that the hypertriglyceridemia was because of significantly elevated rates of hepatic secretion of VLDL triglyceride, apoB100, and apoB48 into plasma in male apoB/BATless mice compared with apoB mice; those results were confirmed in the present studies (data not shown). Of relevance to the present studies, apoB/BATless mice had greater hepatic TG compared with age-matched apoB mice (Fig. 1A), despite greater rates of secretion of both TG and apoB at the age of 22-26 weeks. Hepatic TG stores are derived from three sources as follows: 1) uptake of plasma albumin-bound FA; 2) uptake of VLDL or chylomicron remnant triglyceride fatty acid; or 3) de novo lipogenesis. Our previous published results demonstrated that fasting plasma FA levels were not increased in apoB/BATless mice (3Siri P. Candela N. Ko C. Zhang Y. Eusufzai S. Ginsberg H.N. Huang L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46064-46072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Because steady state levels might not provide a true estimate of FA flux, we determined the fractional clearance rate of plasma FA with [3H]palmitate. There was no difference in the fractional clearance rate of plasma FA in apoB/BATless compared with apoB mice (1.70 ± 0.4 versus 1.97 ± 0.8 pools per min, respectively; p = 0.2). When the fractional clearance rates were multiplied by the FA pool sizes, which were larger in the more obese apoB/BATless mice, there was a nonsignificant trend toward a higher total FA flux in the apoB/BATless compared with the apoB mice (2.32 ± 0.6 versus 1.63 ± 0.9 mEq/min; p = 0.10). Next, we examined de novo hepatic lipogenesis in apoB/BATless and apoB mice. Fig. 1B depicts results of studies to measure hepatic lipogenesis using 3H2O. Incorporation of 3H2O into FA was increased ∼2-fold in apoB/BATless mice. Therefore, the doubling of hepatic TG mass (Fig. 1A) was associated with marked increases in de novo hepatic lipogenesis. Several key molecules participating in this pathway were then examined. ACC catalyzes the ATP-dependent carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA, whereas FAS catalyzes all of the steps in the conversion of malonyl-CoA to palmitate. Hepatic levels of both ACC mRNA (apoB/BATless, 240 ± 44%, n = 4, versus apoB, 100 ± 12%, n = 4; p < 0.01) (Fig. 2A, left) and FAS mRNA (apoB/BATless, 276 ± 74%, n = 4, versus apoB, 100 ± 34%, n = 4; p < 0.01) (Fig. 2A, right) were increased significantly in apoB/BATless versus apoB mice. SCD synthesizes oleic acid from stearate, a conversion that facilitates the biosynthesis of triglycerides and other neutral lipids. Four SCD genes have been cloned in mice, and SCD1 expression has been found to be highly correlated with liver steatosis (23Miyazaki M. Kim Y.C. Ntambi J.M. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1018-1024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The hepatic mRNA levels of SCD1 were significantly higher in apoB/BATless versus apoB mice (apoB/BATless, 214.1 ± 57.4%, n = 4, versus apoB, 100 ± 53.4%, n = 4; p = 0.03) (Fig. 2B). Each of the above-mentioned genes is regulated in part by SREBP-1c, the predominant isoform of SREBP involved in the transcriptional regulation of FA synthesis in the liver (8Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (3838) Google Scholar). Increased levels of SREBP-1c mRNA have been demonstrated in livers of several mouse models characterized by insulin resistance and increased rates of hepatic lipogenesis (24Shimomura I. Bashmakov Y. Horton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30028-30032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, there were no changes in either hepatic mRNA levels of SREBP-1c in apoB/BATless compared with apoB mice (apoB/BATless, 82 ± 31%, n = 4, versus apoB, 100 ± 13%, n = 4) (Fig. 2C, left) or the LXRα, an important transcriptional activator of the Srebp-1c gene (25Repa J.J.

Emerging evidence indicates that lipid droplets are specialized organelles that participate in lipid metabolism and intracellular trafficking. These properties are thought to derive from the lipid droplet-associated PAT protein family (perilipin, ADFP, and Tip47). The functions of the ubiquitously distributed adipose differentiation-related protein (ADFP) and Tip47 remain unknown. To evaluate the roles of ADFP and Tip47 in lipid biogenesis and metabolism, ADFP null and wild type (wt) clonal cell lines were established from ADFP null and wt mice, respectively. In ADFP null cells, Tip47 was identified as the sole lipid droplet-associated protein from the PAT family by mass spectroscopy, which was further confirmed by immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry. Following incubation with oleic acid, ADFP null cells were able to form lipid droplets to the same extent as wt cells. No statistical differences between the two cell types were observed in NEFA uptake or lipolysis. Small interference RNAs (siRNAs) against Tip47 were found to down-regulate protein levels for Tip47 by 85%. ADFP null cells treated with Tip47 siRNA retained the ability to form lipid droplets but to a lesser extent and shunted the utilization of exogenously added NEFA from triglycerides to phospholipids. These data support the hypothesis that Tip47 plays an important role in lipid metabolism.

The molecular mechanisms regulating the formation and metabolism of lipid droplets in non-adipose tissues and their dysfunction in pathophysiological states are not well understood. Recent proteomic studies indicate that lipid droplets are surrounded by a protein coat that provides an interface for lipid metabolic processes, including transport, lipogenesis, and lipolysis (4Brasaemle D.L.

Even more importantly, these studies identify a proteome “signature” for lipid droplets that consistently includes at least one member of the PAT protein family (originally named for perilipin, ADFP and Tip47). A PAT protein is always present and generally represents the most abundant lipid droplet protein, suggesting at least an important structural role for this class of proteins in lipid droplet machinery. The mammalian PAT family includes five members: perilipin, ADFP, 3The abbreviations used are: ADFP, adipose differentiation-related protein; TAG, triacylglycerol; NEFA, non-esterified free fatty acids; Tip47, Tip47 cargo protein; siRNA, small interference RNA; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; wt, wild type; GFP, green fluorescent protein; Bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. tail interacting protein of 47 kDa (Tip47), S3-12, and PAT-1 (9Lu X.

To date, a functional role regulating lipolysis has been shown for perilipin, the principal lipid droplet protein in adipose cells, mainly from studies of the perilipin null mouse that exhibits a lean phenotype (15Martinez-Botas J.

ADFP has long been identified for association with the lipid droplet surface (13Brasaemle D.L. Barber T. Wolins N.E. Serrero G. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Londos C. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 11: 2249-2263Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 17Heid H.W. Schnolzer M. Keenan T.W. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar).

A. 1992; 89: 7856-7860Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) as an early gene of adipocyte differentiation, the ADFP protein occurs only transiently in adipocytes. ADFP is present at the surface of nascent lipid droplets in early stages of adipocyte differentiation but reduced dramatically after the onset of perilipin expression, whereas ADFP mRNA remains elevated. In mature adipocytes ADFP is replaced by perilipin as the major lipid droplet protein. Thus it is not surprising that adipocyte lipid droplets in perilipin null mice are coated with ADFP. However, while adipocyte differentiation in perilipin null mice is not compromised (15Martinez-Botas J. Anderson J.B. Tessier D. Lapillonne A. Chang B.H. Quast M.J. Gorenstein D. Chen K.H. Chan L.

Despite its strong primary sequence homology to perilipin, ADFP is not phosphorylated by protein protein kinase A and ADFP does not supplant the protein kinase A-regulated function of perilipin (16Tansey J.T. Sztalryd C. Gruia-Gray J. Roush D.L. Zee J.V. Gavrilova O. Reitman M.L. Deng C.X. Li C. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Despite numerous attempts, we have failed to detect any effect of overexpression of ADFP mRNA on lipid metabolism in various types of cells. 4G. Xu and C. Londos, unpublished data. On the other hand, we have reported that protection of ADFP from proteosomal degradation with the inhibitor, MG-132, is accompanied by a substantial increase (170%) in lipid content compared with control cells untreated with MG-132, suggesting that ADFP, like perilipin, protects neutral lipids from degradation by lipases (20Xu G.

Londos C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A recent addition to the pool of known lipid droplet surface proteins is Tip47. This member of the PAT family was first identified as a possible cargo protein involved in the trafficking of the mannose-6-phosphate receptor and mainly studied as such (22Diaz E. Pfeffer S.R. Cell. 1998; 93: 433-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Tip47 is also known as placental protein pp17b (23Than N.G. Sumegi B. Bellyei S. Berki T. Szekeres G. Janaky T. Szigeti A. Bohn H. Than G.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1176-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and closely related in primary sequence to ADFP (40%), prompting studies looking for its subcellular localization on lipid droplets (10Miura S. Gan J.W. Brzostowski J. Parisi M.J. Schultz C.J. Londos C. Oliver B. Kimmel A.R. J. Biol.

Indeed, Tip47 was found to have increased association with the fat cake fraction when HeLa cells were incubated with oleic acid. Subsequently, its localization at the lipid droplet surface was confirmed in various types of cells (23Than N.G. Sumegi B. Bellyei S. Berki T. Szekeres G. Janaky T. Szigeti A. Bohn H. Than G.N. Eur.

Chem. 2005; 280: 19146-19155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Tip47, like ADFP, is widely distributed among non-adipogenic tissues but unlike both perilipin and ADFP; it is present in both lipid droplet and cytosolic compartments. This unique property of solubility among the PAT proteins permitted the solution crystal structure of the COOH-terminal portion of Tip47 (25Hickenbottom S.J. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. Hurley J.H. Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 1199-1207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). ADFP null mice exhibit few phenotypic alterations, except for mild resistance to high fat diet-induced fatty liver (26Chang B.H. Li L. Paul A. Taniguchi S. Nannegari V. Heird W.C. Chan L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 1063-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). We report herein that lipid droplets in fibroblastic cells derived from ADFP null mice are coated with Tip47. Using these ADFP null MEF cells, we show that knockdown of Tip47 in these cells with siRNA decreased lipid storage, demonstrating the critical role of PAT proteins in the packaging and storage of neutral lipids in non-adipose cells. Establishment of Fibroblastic Cell Lines from knock-out and wt Mice—Embryonic cells from ADFP null and wt mice were obtained from 16-day-old embryos, and primary cultures were obtained as described previously (19Sztalryd C. Xu G. Dorward H. Tansey J.T. Contreras J.A. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1093-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). To generate immortalized fibroblastic cell lines from these embryos, we followed the method used originally to produce the 3T3-L1 cell line (27Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1975; 5: 19-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). Trypsin digests of seven ADFP null and seven wt embryos were plated in individual T-175-cm2 flasks with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 g/liter glucose supplemented with 10% calf serum (Invitrogen), 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin (Biofluids, Inc.). Cells were trypsinized every 3rd day for 3 months consecutively for a total of 30 repetitions. Cells divided actively during the first month in culture and then entered a latent phase. Some cells became spontaneously immortalized and began to actively grow again. Several such clonal populations of immortalized cells obtained from ADFP null and wt cultures were frozen in liquid nitrogen and constituted the established ADFP null and wt cell lines used in the present study. Cell Lines and Cell Culture Conditions—wt and ADFP null fibroblastic cells were studied in parallel. For siRNA experiments, cells were plated in 6- or 24-multiwell dishes (Costar) and later used for metabolic studies, immunoblot and protein assays. For immunocytochemical studies, cells were plated on Petri dishes containing glass bottoms (MatTek Corp.) or 4-8-well chamber slides (Labtech). For isolation of lipid droplets by subcellular fractionation, cells were grown in 100 × 20-mm dishes (Costar). CHO-K1 cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine (Biofluids, Inc.). Clones of CHO-K1 cells overexpressing Tip47-GFP fusion protein or ADFP-GFP fusion protein were selected in the presence of 600 μg/ml G418. For cellular lipolysis or lipogenesis studies, cells were plated in 24-multiwell dishes (Startdest) at a concentration of 1 × 104 cells/well. All cells were cultured in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Oligonucleotides—siRNAs were designed and purchased from Qiagen (HP guaranteed siRNA), and transfection methods for fibroblastic cell lines were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. The ability to down-regulate Tip47 was tested in both ADFP null and wt cells. Positive siRNAs for mitogen-activated protein kinase-1 and a rhodamine fluorescent oligonucleotide (Qiagen) were used to help establish efficient conditions for transfection. siRNA Construction and Transfection—The siRNAs directed against mouse Tip47 cargo protein were designed by Qiagen. Cells were plated in antibiotic-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum at a concentration of 1 × 104 cells per well in a 24-multiwell dish. During the next 2 days, cells were transfected with siRNAs (20 nm) using RNAiFect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Among six siRNAs for our target gene, the sequences specific for Tip47 cargo protein sens (5′-AACAGCACAGAGAAUGAGGAG-3′) and sens (5′GAAUGAGACAUGUGUUUAA-3′) and were selected based upon their potency to inhibit target gene expression. Equal amounts of two positive siRNAs were used. An ineffective siRNA was used as a negative control, sens (5′-GCGUGUCCAAUCAGUCAU-3′). For the lipogenesis experiments, wt and ADFP cells were transfected using Hyperfect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, cells were plated at a concentration of 1 × 104 cells per well with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in a 24-multiwell dish, and transfection with siRNA was performed the next day. In all experiments, cells were used for Western blotting and imunocytochemistry on day 5 after plating unless otherwise stated, since preliminary experiments have shown that day 5 was optimal for Tip47 protein down-regulation (effect of Tip47 siRNA measured by Western blotting was decreased after day 7 post-plating). Full-length Tip47 and ADFP cDNA constructs were fused in-frame with the 3′ end of eGFP in pEGFP-C2 (Clontech) as described previously (10Miura S. Gan J.W. Brzostowski J. Parisi M.J. Schultz C.J. Londos C. Oliver B. Kimmel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32253-32257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). CHO cells were transfected with Lipofectamine, using either ADFP-GFP or Tip47-GFP fusion protein constructs. Clonal cell lines were established as described previously (19Sztalryd C. Xu G. Dorward H. Tansey J.T. Contreras J.A. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1093-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Briefly, immediately following infection, CHO cells were placed under selection in 600 μg/ml G418, and cells after 8 days in selection medium were re-plated in 96-multiwells at a concentration of 2 cells/ml. Positive “green” clonal cells were identified by microscopy and further expanded. Fat Cake Preparation—Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (PBS), scraped into PBS, and pelleted by low speed centrifugation. Lipid droplet isolation was performed as described (14Wolins N.E. Rubin B.O. Brasaemle D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5101-5108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Antibodies and Fluorescent Dyes—Antibodies used include the following: anti-Tip47, which was raised in rabbits against the COOH-terminal ∼200 amino acids of murine Tip47, and anti-ADFP, which was raised in rabbits against a peptide comprising the 26 amino-terminal amino acids of murine ADFP. Antibody specificity was confirmed with the use of two clonal CHO-K1 cell lines, stably transfected with the pEGFP-C2 vector containing coding murine ADFP and Tip47 sequences. The presence of ADFP and Tip47 in fat cake or total cell extract was analyzed by immunoblotting by loading 20 μg of total protein per lane onto 4-12% BisTris gradient mini gels (NuPAGE, Invitrogen). Immunostaining revealed that the ADFP and Tip47 antibodies do not cross-react (supplemental Fig. 1). Bodipy 558/568 and Bodipy 493/503 (Invitrogen) were used to visualize intracellular neutral lipid droplets. Alexa Fluor 488 and Alexa Fluor 598 species-specific secondary antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes (Invitrogen). For loading control, anti-β-actin antibody was used (Abcam). Immunocytochemistry and Immunoblotting—For ADFP and Tip47 staining, cells were fixed in 3% (v/v) paraformaldhyde for 15 min at room temperature. After a brief rinse in PBS, pH 7.4, cells were blocked before staining with donkey chromopure IgG or goat chromopure IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) in the presence of 0.1% w/v of saponin for 2 h at room temperature. Double-labeled immunostaining was performed overnight at 4 °C with the appropriate antibodies. Primary antibodies were used in different combinations and dilutions as follows: 1:500 dilution for rabbit anti-murine or goat anti-murine ADFP and 1:500 dilution for rabbit anti-murine Tip47. After four washes with PBS with 0.1% w/v saponin, cells were incubated for 1 h with appropriate secondary antibodies (Invitrogen): Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (1:1000 dilution) and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated donkey anti-goat (1:500 dilution). Cells were viewed with a confocal laser microscope (LSM510; Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.) using a 63× oil objective lens. Cellular extracts for immunoblotting were obtained by scraping cells in Laemmli sample buffer containing 5% SDS and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Each lane of an SDS-PAGE gel was loaded with protein derived from a single well of a 24-multiwell dish. Cellular Lipolysis and Lipogenesis—Lipolysis was performed according to Tansey et al. (16Tansey J.T. Sztalryd C. Gruia-Gray J. Roush D.L. Zee J.V. Gavrilova O. Reitman M.L. Deng C.X. Li C. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Given our earlier published methods, and published work from another laboratory using this level of triacsin C to block fatty acid esterification into triglycerides (TAGs) (16Tansey J.T. Sztalryd C.

Triplicate wells were tested for each condition. Lipid Extraction and Thin Layer Chromatography—The cell monolayer was washed with ice-cold PBS and scraped into 1 ml of PBS. The lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (28Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar) in the presence of an internal neutral lipid standard mix containing 10 μg each of monoolein, diolein, triolein, free cholesterol, oleic acid, and cholesteryl oleate (Supelco) for band identification. Thin layer chromatography extractions were performed as described previously (29Sztalryd C. Levacher C. Picon L. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1989; 35: 81-88PubMed Google Scholar, 30Tansey J.T. Huml A.M. Vogt R.

In some experiments, the phospholipid spot remaining at the origin in our solvent system was scraped and re-extracted twice with chloroform methanol (1/2) and dried down under nitrogen before being kept at -80 °C. Polar lipid species were separated on silica gel G (Analtech) plates using a one-dimensional double-development procedure from Igal et al. (38Igal R.A. Coleman R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16644-16651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Briefly, phospholipids were separated in a double one-directional solvent system. First, the plate was developed with chloroform-methanol-30% ammonium hydroxide-H2O (70:25:3.5:1.5, v/v) to 3 cm from the top. The residual solvents on the plate were evaporated, and the plate was rerun in the same direction in chloroform:methanol:glacial acetic acid:H2O (80:10:2:0.75, v/v). Pure lipid standards: phosphatidylcholine, phophoinositol, and phosphoethanolamine were run in parallel (Avanti lipids) and were added to the samples 10 μg each for identification purpose. Spots were scraped and radioactivity determined. Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance was tested using a one-way analysis of variance analysis (GraphPad Sofware Inc.) or a two-tailed Student's t test. Tip47 Is the Predominant PAT Protein on Lipid Droplets of Fibroblasts of ADFP Null Cells—The minimal phenotype in ADFP null mice suggested the presence of a compensatory PAT protein at the surface of the lipid droplet. To test for such a possibility, we isolated fat cakes from primary cultures of MEF cells grown in the presence of NEFA and submitted the resulting fat cake to an alkali carbonate wash, pH 10, to eliminate a number of proteins loosely associated with the surface of the lipid droplet (14Wolins N.E. Rubin B.O. Brasaemle D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5101-5108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). After SDS-PAGE, the most abundant band was analyzed by mass spectroscopy, which identified 14 peptides comprising 51% of the 437 amino acids of murine Tip47 (Fig. 1). Mass spectrometry also revealed that the second most abundant band, which migrated near the 45-kDa marker, was vimentin. Up-regulation of Tip47 in ADFP Null MEFs—To explore the possibility of compensatory mechanisms regulating lipid drop-let formation in non-adipogenic cells and their functional consequences, we established MEF cell lines from 16-day embryos of ADFP null and wt mice, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Immunofluorescent staining and immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2) confirmed the absence of ADFP in established ADFP null cell lines. More importantly, Bodipy staining of neutral lipids clearly indicated that ADFP null cells could accumulate lipid droplets in response to fatty acid loading. With the use of our recently developed Tip47 antibody (see “Experimental Procedures” and supplemental Fig. 1), further analyses showed higher expression of Tip47 mRNA and protein in the ADFP null than wt cells (Fig. 3). Furthermore, immunofluorescence staining showed that Tip47 coated the lipid droplets of ADFP null cells (Fig. 4). In addition, we confirmed the higher expression of Tip47 protein in liver fat extracts from ADFP null mice compared with wt mice (Fig. 5).FIGURE 3Overexpression of Tip47 in ADFP null cell lines.

https://openalex.org/W2005918089,"Whether α6β4 integrin regulates migration remains controversial. β4 integrin-deficient (JEB) keratinocytes display aberrant migration in that they move in circles, a behavior that mirrors the circular arrays of laminin (LM)-332 in their matrix. In contrast, wild-type keratinocytes and JEB keratinocytes, induced to express β4 integrin, assemble laminin-332 in linear tracks over which they migrate. Moreover, laminin-332-dependent migration of JEB keratinocytes along linear tracks is restored when cells are plated on wild-type keratinocyte matrix, whereas wild-type keratinocytes show rotation over circular arrays of laminn-332 in JEB keratinocyte matrix. The activities of Rac1 and the actin cytoskeleton-severing protein cofilin are low in JEB keratinocytes compared with wild-type cells but are rescued following expression of wild-type β4 integrin in JEB cells. Additionally, in wild-type keratinocytes Rac1 is complexed with α6β4 integrin. Moreover, Rac1 or cofilin inactivation induces wild-type keratinocytes to move in circles over rings of laminin-332 in their matrix. Together these data indicate that laminin-332 matrix organization is determined by the α6β4 integrin/actin cytoskeleton via Rac1/cofilin signaling. Furthermore, our results imply that the organizational state of laminin-332 is a key determinant of the motility behavior of keratinocytes, an essential element of skin wound healing and the successful invasion of epidermal-derived tumor cells.

Migration of cells is an essential element of morphogenesis, remodeling following tissue damage and metastasis. For example, following wounding of the skin, epidermal cells migrate over a wound, a complex process involving changes in cytoskeleton organization, alterations in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, and modulation in gene and protein expression (1Martin P.

Two integrin receptors (α3β1 and α6β4) bind LM-332. α3β1 integrin is involved in cell adhesion to LM-332 ligand, LM-332 matrix assembly, and cell motility (3Goldfinger L.E. Hopkinson S.B. deHart G.W.

Indeed, several groups have hypothesized that migration of keratinocytes on LM-332 is mediated by α3β1 rather than α6β4 integrin, with the latter having a “transdominating” inhibitory effect on α3β1 integrin (35Santoro M.M. Gaudino G. Marchisio P.C. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 257-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 36Russell A.J. Fincher E.F. Millman L. Smith R. Vela V. Waterman E.A.

If this hypothesis is correct, then one might assume that, when β4 integrin is absent, cells should migrate constitutively in a α3β1 integrin-dependent manner. However, here, contrary to this hypothesis, we present evidence showing that cells deficient in β4 integrin have a motility defect. This defect is corrected following re-expression of a wild-type β4 integrin subunit. Our data also indicate that α6β4 integrin, through interaction with the Rac1 signaling pathway, regulates LM-332 matrix organization which, in turn, specifies patterns of cell motility. Cell Culture, Drug Treatments, Matrix Preparation, SDSPAGE, Immunoblotting, and Immunoprecipitation—Human epidermal (WT) keratinocytes were a gift from Dr. Lou Laimins of Northwestern University. The β4-deficient keratinocytes, derived from a JEB patient, were described previously (Russell et al. (36Russell A.J. Fincher E.F. Millman L. Smith R. Vela V. Waterman E.A. Dey C.N. Guide S.

Both lines were immortalized in identical fashion using human papilloma virus E6 and E7 genes (39Kaur P. McDougall J.K. Cone R. J. Gen. Virol. 1989; 70: 1261-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). They were maintained at 37 °C in defined keratinocyte serum-free medium (Invitrogen). The Rac1 inhibitor NSC23766 was obtained from the Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch, Developmental Therapeutics Program, Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis, NCI, National Institutes of Health. It was added to keratinocyte growth medium at 50 μm 24 h prior to cell analysis. Brefeldin A (Sigma-Aldrich Co.) was added to growth medium at a concentration of 50 μm. Keratinocyte matrix was prepared as described previously (40Langhofer M. Hopkinson S.B. Jones J.C.R. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 753-764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitations, keratinocytes were extracted in 1% Brij 97, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2 supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich Co.). The extract was clarified by centrifugation, and either primary antibody or control IgG was added. After shaking for 4 h at 4°C, rProtein G-agarose beads (Invitrogen) were added to the mix, which was incubated for 90 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed, collected by centrifugation, and then incubated in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Protein preparations were processed for SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as detailed elsewhere (30Dowling J. Yu Q.-C. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 559-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Immunoblots were scanned and quantified using a MetaMorph Imaging System (Universal Imaging Corp., Molecular Devices, Downingtown, PA). Retroviral and Adenoviral Constructs and Infection of Keratinocytes—The wild-type β4 integrin cDNA or a mutant, laminin-332 binding-deficient β4 integrin bearing a mutation in the specificity determining loop (K150A) were described previously (41Tsuruta D.

Both were fused with sequences encoding GFP at their 3′ ends, cloned into the LNCX2 vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), and sequenced using ABI Big Dye chemistry (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The subsequent constructs were introduced into PT67 packaging cells using calcium phosphate-mediated transfection. Briefly, 10 μg of DNA was diluted in 440 μl of sterile water, mixed with 500 μl of 2× HBS (280 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm Na2HPO4, 12 mm dextrose, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.05) and 60 μl2 m CaCl2, and added dropwise to cells in medium containing 25 μm chloroquine. Following overnight incubation, the medium was removed, cells were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, and fresh medium was added. The following day, cells were trypsinized and replated into medium (without penicillin/streptomycin) supplemented with G418 (Invitrogen). Surviving cells were subsequently cloned to produce stable cell lines. Four days prior to infecting keratinocytes, PT67 cell lines expressing the β4 integrin construct were transfected with a plasmid encoding the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein using the protocol described above. The following day, the medium was replaced, and the cells were switched to 32 °C for 2 days. The supernatant was harvested and filtered, and 8 μg/ml Polybrene was added. Keratinocytes were incubated in the viral supernatant in plates which were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 2 h at room temperature (42Hirotani H. Tuohy N.A. Woo J.T. Stern P.H. Clipstone N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13984-13992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). After removal of viral supernatant, cells were subcultured for subsequent analyses. Keratinocytes were infected with adenoviruses containing the cytomegalovirus promoter (courtesy of Dr. Kathy Rundell, Northwestern University), the N19 DN mutant of RhoA, the N17 DN mutant of Rac1, the N17 dominant-negative mutant of Cdc42, the V12 CA Rac1 mutant (all c-Myc epitope-tagged, courtesy of Dr. Anne Ridley of University College, London, UK), XAC1 GFP S3E (inactive, phospho-mimetic) cofilin, XAC1 GFP S3A (active, non-phosphorylatable) cofilin (generously provided by Dr. James Bamburg of the University of Colorado at Boulder, CO), and the YFP-tagged β3 laminin subunit at a multiplicity of infection of 1:50 in keratinocyte medium (43Agnew B.J. Minamide L.S. Bamburg J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17582-17587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). To generate virus encoding YFP-tagged full-length β3 laminin, β3 laminin cDNA was cloned into the pEYFP-N vector (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) at the BamHI/XhoI sites in the polylinker 5′ to the start of sequences encoding the YFP tag. This produces a fusion protein consisting of the β3 laminin subunit, a spacer of 21 amino acid residues (RAQASNSAVDGTAGPGSPVAT), and YFP. This entire cassette was subcloned into the pENTR-4 vector (Invitrogen). This entry vector was used in a site-directed recombination reaction to place the cassette into the pAD/CMV.V-5-DEST vector following the manufacturer's directions (Invitrogen). The adenoviral vector was linearized with PacI and transfected into 293A cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Approximately 12 days post transfection, the adenovirus-containing 293A cells were harvested and lysed to prepare a crude viral stock. The resultant viral stock was amplified and titered. Keratinocytes were incubated in virus at 37 °C overnight, and the virus-containing medium was removed. The cells were then fed with fresh medium, followed by incubation at 37 °C. After 18 h, cells were trypsinized and processed for motility assays. To confirm expression of the above constructs, immunoblotting of cell extracts was performed using GFP antibodies or antibody 9E10 against the c-Myc epitope, and/or cultures were viewed by fluorescence microscopy to identify cells expressing GFP- or YFP-tagged protein (not shown). Greater than 80% infection rates were obtained in each of our studies.

GoH3, a rat monoclonal against α6 integrin, was obtained from Beckman Coulter (Miami, FL).

A rabbit polyclonal antibody (AA6A) against α6 integrin was generously provided by Dr. Anne Cress (University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ). A rabbit polyclonal antibody against β1 integrin was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Secondary antibodies conjugated with various fluorochromes or horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc. (West Grove, PA). For flow cytometry, freshly trypsinized cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing a 50% dilution of normal goat serum, incubated with monoclonal antibodies against α3, β4, or α6 integrin for 45 min at room temperature, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, incubated with Cy5-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG for 45 min, washed, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, and analyzed using a Beckman Coulter Elite PCS sorter (Beckman Coulter). For negative controls, primary antibody was omitted from the above procedure. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells on glass coverslips were processed as detailed elsewhere (30Dowling J. Yu Q.-C. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 559-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). All preparations were viewed with a confocal laserscanning microscope (LSM 510, Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY). Images were exported as TIFF files, and figures were generated using Adobe Photoshop software. Observations of Live Cells, Motility Assays, and TIRF—Scratch assays of confluent cell monolayers were performed in triplicate as described elsewhere (3Goldfinger L.E. Hopkinson S.B. deHart G.W. Collawn S. Couchman J.R. Jones J.C.R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2615-2629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For studies on the motility of individual and groups of cells, cells were plated onto uncoated or matrixcoated 35 mm glass-bottom culture dishes (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA). For function-blocking assays, fresh medium containing 20 μg/ml antibody or immunoglobulin was added 15 min prior to visualization. Cells were viewed on a Nikon TE2000 inverted microscope (Nikon Inc., Melville, NY) or the Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. Images were taken at 2- to 5-min intervals over a 2-h period, and cell motility was analyzed by MetaMorph (Molecular Devices Corp.). Motility assays were performed a minimum of three times with at least 50 cells being counted in each trial. Wide-field and TIRF observations of live cells were performed on a TIRFM microscope (Olympus America Corp., Melville, NY). Expression of β4 Integrin in JEB and WT Keratinocytes—We have used keratinocytes derived from a patient with junctional epidermolysis bullosa-pyloric atresia (JEB), a blistering skin disease whose pathogenesis results from an absence of β4 integrin expression (45Vidal F. Aberdam D. Miquel C. Christiano A.M. Pulkkinen L. Uitto J. Ortonne J.-P. Meneguzzi G. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analyses confirmed that these JEB cells are deficient in β4 integrin (Fig. 1A), but express α3 and α6 integrin at levels comparable to those of wild-type (WT) cells (Fig. 1A). The JEB keratinocytes were infected with retrovirus encoding either GFP-tagged wildtype β4 integrin or β4 integrin bearing a mutation (K150A) that inhibits α6β4 integrin interaction with LM-332 ligand (41Tsuruta D. Hopkinson S.B. Lane K. Werner M.E. Cryns V.L. Jones J.C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38707-38714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analyses reveal that surface expression of β4 integrin protein in these cells (JEBβ4 and JEBβ4Mut) is at levels slightly higher than their WT counterparts; surface expression of α3 and α6 integrin in the cells was comparable to JEB and WT cells (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, when viewed either by confocal or total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, tagged β4 integrin protein localized along the substratum-attached surface of JEBβ4 and JEBβ4Mut cells in patterns identical to the distribution of endogenous β4 integrin in WT cells (Fig. 1B). JEB cells showed no staining when processed for confocal immunofluorescence microscopy using a β4 integrin antibody probe (Fig. 1B). JEB Cells Exhibit Aberrant Motility Behavior—We next assayed the migration of WT, JEB, JEBβ4, and JEBβ4Mut keratinocytes in scratch wound motility assays (Fig. 2). Consistent with others (36Russell A.J. Fincher E.F. Millman L. Smith R. Vela V. Waterman E.A. Dey C.N. Guide S. Weaver V.M. Marinkovich M.P. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3543-3556Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), both JEB and JEBβ4Mut cell populations displayed delayed wound closure compared with WT and JEBβ4 keratinocytes (Fig. 2). We have also monitored migration of individual and groups of cells following plating onto an uncoated substrate. These assays were performed at 6-8 h after plating to allow the cells to adhere and spread. JEB and JEBβ4Mut cells showed significantly lower overall migration and displacement over a 2-h period than their WT counterparts (Fig. 3A). These deficiencies were not observed in JEBβ4 cells, which exhibit migration similar to WT cells (Fig. 3A). We also calculated the directed migration index (net displacement divided by total distance traveled) for the four cell types. None of the indices approached one indicating that the four keratinocytes failed to exhibit directed/processive migration under these conditions (Fig. 3A). Nevertheless, upon careful examination of the images we derived, we noticed that our cells show two distinct motile behaviors. WT cells move along linear tracks (Fig. 3, B (panel i) and C, and supplemental video 1). In addition, a number of WT cells change trajectory and move back over the same regions of the substrate that they have already traversed (backtracking is exhibited by 34 (±3) % of WT cells that we have examined; n = 163, in three trials), which is the clear reason why they do not exhibit directed migration. In contrast, JEB cells move primarily in circles and exhibit little or no migration along linear tracks; this is true of individual cells as well as groups of adherent cells (Fig. 3, B (panels ii and iii) and C, and supplemental video 2). The migratory patterns displayed by the JEB cells explain why these cells failed to close a wound in a scratch assay (Fig. 2)"

PAI-1 exhibits circadian rhythmicity in its expression, peaking in the early morning, which is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular events. However, the mechanisms that determine PAI-1 circadian rhythmicity remain poorly understood. We discovered that the orphan nuclear receptor Reverbα, a core component of the circadian loop, represses human PAI-1 gene expression through two Rev-erbα binding sites in the PAI-1 promoter. Mutations of these sites, as well as RNA interference targeting endogenous Rev-erbα and its corepressors, led to increased expression of the PAI-1 gene. Furthermore, glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) contributes to pai-1 repression by phosphorylating and stabilizing Rev-erbα protein, which can be blocked by lithium. Interestingly, serum shock generated circadian oscillations in PAI-1 mRNA in NIH3T3 cells, suggesting that PAI-1 is a direct output gene of the circadian loop. Ectopic expression of a stabilized form of Rev-erbα that mimics GSK3β phosphorylation dramatically dampened PAI-1 circadian oscillations. Thus, our results suggest that Rev-erbα is a major determinant of the circadian PAI-1 expression and a potential modulator of the morning susceptibility to myocardial infarction.

Circadian clocks are present in cells throughout the body and drive many physiologic and disease processes. The cardiovascular system displays circadian rhythms in many of its normal functions, including platelet activation, fibrinolytic activity, and blood pressure (1Young M.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: H1-H16Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), as well as in the timing of acute cardiac events such as myocardial infarction and stroke, both of which peak in the early morning (2Marler J.R. Price T.R. Clark G.L. Muller J.E. Robertson T. Mohr J.P. Hier D.B. Wolf P.A. Caplan L.R. Foulkes M.A. Stroke. 1989; 20: 473-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 3Muller J.E. Stone P.H.

Chandler W.L. Schmer G. Circulation. 1989; 79: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The morning peak of plasma PAI-1 corresponds to a nadir in net fibrinolysis, suggesting a role in the onset of acute thrombotic events (6Andreotti F. Davies G.J. Hackett D.R. Khan M.I. De Bart A.C.

Circulation. 1997; 96: 19-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that elevated PAI-1 levels may indeed promote the development of atherothrombosis (8Vaughan D.E. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2005; 3: 1879-1883Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Reduced fibrinolysis as result of increased plasma PAI-1 may lead directly to thrombosis and ischemia, as transgenic mice expressing a stable form of human PAI-1 develop spontaneous coronary thrombosis and myocardial infarction (9Eren M.

Cell Cardiol. 2003; 35: 473-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). PAI-1 may also play a role in vascular remodeling and the propagation of inflammatory signals. PAI-1 interacts with the extracellular matrix protein vitronectin to inhibit endothelial cell migration, potentially compromising wound healing and neointima formation after vascular injury (13Carmeliet P. Moons L. Lijnen R. Janssens S. Lupu F. Collen D. Gerard R.D. Circulation. 1997; 96: 3180-3191Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 14Kohler H.P. Grant P.J. N. Engl. J.

Excess PAI-1 has been found in atherosclerotic plaques in humans and is further elevated in subjects with diabetes (16Sobel B.E. Woodcock-Mitchell J. Schneider D.J. Holt R.E. Marutsuka K. Gold H. Circulation. 1998; 97: 2213-2221Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). PAI-1 is induced in both acute and chronic inflammatory states such as sepsis (17Paramo J.A. Perez J.L. Serrano M. Rocha E. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1990; 64: 3-6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and obesity (18De Taeye B. Smith L.H. Vaughan D.E. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2005; 5: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and may contribute to thrombotic tendencies in these diseases. PAI-1 deficiency, on the other hand, appears to be cardioprotective, as the lack of the Pai-1 gene in ApoE–/– mice delays thrombus formation following atherosclerotic plaque rupture (19Eitzman D.T. Westrick R.J. Xu Z. Tyson J. Ginsburg D. Blood. 2000; 96: 4212-4215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Disruption of the Pai-1 gene also reduces adiposity and improves metabolic profile in diabetic or high fat diet-fed mice (20Ma L.J. Mao S.L. Taylor K.L. Kanjanabuch T. Guan Y. Zhang Y. Brown N.J.

FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1840-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), which may provide secondary protection against cardiovascular disease. Basal expression of the PAI-1 gene is known to be regulated by an array of factors, but mechanisms determining PAI-1 circadian rhythm are less understood. Endogenous sources of PAI-1, including the liver, adipose tissue, and the vascular endothelium, all contain robust circadian clocks that govern gene expression. Therefore it is possible that PAI-1 is a direct output gene of the circadian clock. Indeed, the PAI-1 promoter contains E-box enhancers that mediate transcription activation by CLOCK·BMAL heterodimers, which are the positive limb of the circadian feedback loop (12Schoenhard J.A.

However, little is known about negative regulation of the PAI-1 promoter by core circadian clock proteins. The orphan nuclear receptor Rev-erbα is a key negative feedback regulator of the circadian clock (23Preitner N. Damiola F. Lopez-Molina L. Zakany J. Duboule D. Albrecht U. Schibler U. Cell. 2002; 110: 251-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1650) Google Scholar). Rev-erbα is expressed in liver and adipose tissues (24Chawla A. Lazar M.A. J. Biol.

Haemostasis. 1994; 72: 44-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 28Samad F. Loskutoff D.J. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 568-582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and is itself expressed in a circadian manner that is finely controlled both transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally (23Preitner N.

Lazar M.A. Science. 2006; 311: 1002-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Rev-erbα constitutively represses transcription of its target genes, which include Rev-erbα itself (30Adelmant G. Begue A. Stehelin D. Laudet V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3553-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), by binding to target promoters and recruiting repression complexes containing the nuclear receptor corepressor (N-CoR) (31Harding H.P.

Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 1452-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In addition, Rev-erbα competitively inhibits gene activation by RORα, a constitutively active orphan nuclear receptor that recognizes the same DNA response element (35Giguere V. McBroom L.D.B.

We show that Rev-erbα potently represses the PAI-1 promoter both by recruiting corepressors and by blocking RORα-mediated activation. Furthermore, repression by Rev-erbα is an important determinant of PAI-1 circadian rhythm, as stabilization of Rev-erbα protein abolishes serum-induced oscillations in PAI-1 expression. Regulation of PAI-1 by Rev-erbα therefore represents a novel link between the circadian clock and cardiovascular function. Plasmids and Reagents—The PAI-1-luciferase reporter construct was generated by PCR-amplifying the proximal 840-bp human PAI-1 promoter and subcloning it into a short half-life pGL4.15 luc2P/Hygro vector (Promega, Madison, WI). RORE mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the Quik-Change kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and confirmed by sequencing analysis. The expression vectors encoding human Rev-erbα and human RORα1 have been described previously (34Yin L. Lazar M.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 1452-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 36Harding H.P. Atkins G.B. Jaffe A.G. Seo W.J. Lazar M.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1737-1746PubMed Google Scholar). Lithium chloride was purchased from Sigma. Protein A-Sepharose was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Mammalian Cell Culture and Transfection—HepG2, HEK-293, and NIH3T3 cells were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were grown at 37 C in 5% CO2. Stable NIH3T3 cell lines expressing ectopic WT or S55D/S59D Rev-erbα have been described previously (29Yin L. Wang J. Klein P.S. Lazar M.A. Science. 2006; 311: 1002-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). All transient transfection assays were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. For repression assay, cells were grown in 12-well plates and transfected with 0.2 μgof PAI-1-luciferase reporter, 0.1∼2 μg Rev-erbα expression vector, and 0.1 μgof β-galactosidase expression vector. The total amount of expression plasmid transfected per well was kept constant by adding varying amounts of empty vector. At 48-h post-transfection, cells were lysed and their luciferase activity assayed using a reporter assay kit (Promega). Luciferase units were normalized to β-galactosidase expression. Each experiment was performed three times in triplicate. Serum Shock—The protocol used for serum shock was as described (41Balsalobre A. Damiola F. Schibler U. Cell. 1998; 93: 929-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1551) Google Scholar, 42Nagoshi E. Brown S.A. Dibner C. Kornmann B. Schibler U. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 393: 543-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In brief, NIH3T3 fibroblasts were grown to confluence in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Cells were then starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum for 24 h. On the day of serum shock, 50% horse serum was added for 2 h, and then the medium was changed back to starvation medium. Cells were harvested for protein and RNA extraction at indicated time points. RNA Interference—Vectors expressing hairpin small interfering RNAs (siRNA) under the human U6 or H1 promoter were described previously (29Yin L. Wang J. Klein P.S. Lazar M.A. Science. 2006; 311: 1002-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 43Ishizuka T. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5122-5131Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Control was pEntry βgalactosidase plus pSilence Scramble siRNA. The target sequences were as follows: pEntry-GSK3β, 5′-ggcaccagagttgatctttg-3′; Rev-erbα, 5′-ggcatgggtgttactgtgtaaa-3′; HDAC3, 5′-cagcgcattgatgaccagagttaca-3′; β-galactosidase, 5′-gtgcacctggtaaatcttat-3′; pSilence-N-CoR, 5′-aagaaggatccagcattcgga-3′. Cells in 12-well plates were transfected twice over a 96-h period with 1.6 μg of siRNA vector per well. After the second transfection, cells were harvested for RNA analysis or protein analysis. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—Cells were grown in 10-cm plates and either transfected or treated with 1 mm lithium for the indicated experiments. After cross-linking in formaldehyde, cells were lysed in hypotonic buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 85 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1× protease inhibitor). The nuclear fraction was resuspended in 500 μl of sonication buffer (0.01% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1× protease inhibitor) and sonicated four times for 12 s each followed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min. Supernatants were collected and diluted in dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 167 mm Tris-HCl, 167 mm NaCl) followed by preclearing with 2 μg of salmon sperm DNA and protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation with the following antibodies was performed at 4 °C overnight: anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma), anti-acetyl histone H4 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), anti-N-CoR/SMRT (Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO), normal rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-Rev-erbα. Immunoprecipitated complexes were collected with protein A-Sepharose beads followed by sequential washes in low salt, high salt, lithium, and Tris-EDTA buffers (34Yin L. Lazar M.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 1452-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Precipitates were eluted, and 5 m NaCl was added to reverse cross-links at 65 °C for 6 h. DNA fragments were column-purified (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and 3 μl of purified DNA was used in 28–32 cycles of PCR using primers encompassing both RORE regions of the human endogenous PAI-1 promoter (forward 5′-tccacgttttgatggaggtt-3′ and reverse 5′-ctctgggagtccgtctgaac-3′) and the PAI-1-luciferase primers (forward 5′-tccacgttttgatggaggtt-3′ and reverse 5′-tcttccatggtggctttacc-3′). Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR—Total mRNA was prepared using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Reverse transcription was performed with 3 μg of total RNA using the ImpromII RT kit (Promega) according to manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA was subject to quantitative reverse transcription PCR using an ABI Prism 7900 HT detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). All primers and probes were purchased from Applied Biosystems. Target gene expression was normalized to housekeeping gene GAPDH or 36B4. The average Ct value from each triplicate was used to calculate fold induction of the gene, with the control group normalized to 1. Immunoblotting—Cells were lysed in whole-cell lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris pH 7.6, 0.1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA) with 1× protease inhibitor. 20 μg of lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Blots were probed with the following primary antibodies: anti-N-CoR/SMRT (Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO), anti-HDAC3 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), anti-GSK3β and GAPDH (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), anti-RORα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma), and anti-Rev-erbα (34Yin L. Lazar M.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 1452-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Orphan Nuclear Receptor Rev-erbα Represses Activity of Human PAI-1 Promoter—Examination of the human PAI-1 promoter identified two potential Rev-erbα monomer binding sites (ROREs) at distances of 418 and 265 bp from the transcription start (Fig. 1A). The proximal RORE had been previously shown to act as a binding site for Nur77, another nuclear receptor implicated in PAI-1 transcription regulation (44Gruber F. Hufnagl P. Hofer-Warbinek R. Schmid J.A. Breuss J.M. Huber-Beckmann R. Lucerna M. Papac N. Harant H. Lindley I. de Martin R. Binder B.R. Blood. 2003; 101: 3042-3048Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To determine whether the PAI-1 promoter is sensitive to Rev-erbα regulation, we cloned the proximal PAI-1 promoter that includes the two putative ROREs into a luciferase reporter vector and transfected it into human 293T cells. The PAI-1 promoter had strong basal activity in these cells, which was dramatically repressed by ectopic expression of human Rev-erbα (Fig. 1B). The repression was dose-dependent, as increasing amounts of the co-transfected Rev-erbα expression plasmid further reduced luciferase activity (Fig. 1C). Similar results were obtained using human HepG2 liver cells and mouse fibroblast NIH3T3 cells (data not shown), indicating that Rev-erbα-mediated repression of the PAI-1 promoter is a cell-autonomous phenomenon. We next investigated whether the two putative PAI-1 ROREs were necessary for Rev-erbα-mediated repression by mutating either or both of them and testing their ability to recruit and be repressed by Rev-erbα. Consistent with the requirement for two Rev-erbα monomers to allow corepressor recruitment (31Harding H.P. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4791-4802Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 33Zamir I. Zhang J. Lazar M.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 835-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), a GG/CA mutation in either RORE led to dramatic reductions in the ability of Rev-erbα to repress the promoters, and mutation of both sites abolished repression altogether (Fig. 1D). ChIP analysis showed that the wild-type PAI-1 promoter is bound by Rev-erbα and corepressor N-CoR/SMRT, and mutation of both ROREs effectively reduced Rev-erbα binding and abolished N-CoR recruitment, explaining the loss of repression of the mutant promoters (Fig. 1E). Single mutation of the ROREs reduced Rev-erbα recruitment to the PAI-1 promoter by ∼50%, consistent with the ability of Rev-erbα to bind the RORE as a monomer. However, N-CoR association with the PAI-1 promoter was more drastically reduced when either RORE was mutated (Fig. 1E), consistent with the requirement that two Rev-erbα molecules be bound for productive N-CoR recruitment, as well as with the functional data in Fig. 1D. The PAI-1 Gene Is Induced by the Constitutively Active Nuclear Receptor RORα, and the Induction Is Blocked by Rev-erbα—Rev-erbα is known to cross-talk with RORα, an orphan nuclear receptor that has similar DNA binding specificity to Rev-erbα and acts as a constitutive transcriptional activator (36Harding H.P. Atkins G.B. Jaffe A.G. Seo W.J. Lazar M.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1737-1746PubMed Google Scholar, 46Guillaumond F. Dardente H. Giguere V. Cermakian N. J. Biol. Rhythms. 2005; 20: 391-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 47Ueda H.R. Chen W. Adachi A. Wakamatsu H. Hayashi S. Takasugi T. Nagano M. Nakahama K. Suzuki Y. Sugano S. Iino M. Shigeyoshi Y. Hashimoto S. Nature. 2002; 418: 534-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, RORα has been implicated in modulating cardiovascular risks, as the RORα-mutant Staggerer mice are prone to lipid abnormalities and atherosclerosis (45Mamontova A. Seguret-Mace S. Esposito B. Chaniale C. Bouly M. Delhaye-Bouchaud N. Luc G. Staels B. Duverger N. Mariani J. Tedgui A. Circulation. 1998; 98: 2738-2743Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). More recently, RORα has been shown to induce the proatherothrombotic fibrinogen-β gene, and Staggerer mice have reduced levels of fibrinogen, which could be atheroprotective (37Chauvet C. Bois-Joyeux B. Fontaine C. Gervois P. Bernard M.A. Staels B. Danan J.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 2517-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Because ROR activates target genes via ROREs in their promoters, we reasoned that RORα might be a positive regulator of the PAI-1 gene. Indeed, RORα markedly induced PAI-1 promoter activity in a RORE-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). Moreover, the induction of PAI-1 transcription by RORα was opposed by increasing amounts of Rev-erbα, which competes for RORE binding with RORα (Fig. 2B). Rev-erbα actually reduced the PAI-1 promoter activity to levels well below the base line (Fig. 2B), indicating that its effects are due to active repression in addition to competition with RORα for binding to the promoter. Endogenous Rev-erbα Represses Native PAI-1 Gene Expression in Human Liver Cells—Having established that Rev-erbα regulates PAI-1 promoter activity in vitro, we next explored the role of endogenous Rev-erbα and the N-CoR·HDAC3 corepressor complex in the basal expression of PAI-1 in liver cells. We used small interfering RNA to reduce expression of Reverbα, N-CoR, or HDAC3 in HepG2 cells (Fig. 3A). Knockdown of Rev-erbα significantly increased the expression of PAI-1 mRNA, as did knockdown of either N-CoR or HDAC3 (Fig. 3B). These data indicate that the PAI-1 gene is basally repressed in liver cells by Rev-erbα and its effector, N-CoR·HDAC3 corepressor complex. Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3β (GSK3β) Activity Is Required For Rev-erbα-Repression of the PAI-1 Gene—We have previously reported that GSK3β-dependent phosphorylation of Rev-erbα on serines 55 and 59 stabilizes Rev-erbα protein by protecting it from proteasomal degradation (29Yin L. Wang J. Klein P.S. Lazar M.A. Science. 2006; 311: 1002-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether GSK3β plays a role in PAI-1 gene repression via this mechanism, using siRNA to reduce its expression (Fig. 4A). Indeed, knockdown of endogenous GSK3β led to Rev-erbα protein destabilization (Fig. 4A) and significantly increased endogenous PAI-1 expression (Fig. 4B). Next, we tested the ability of lithium, an inhibitor of GSK3β kinase activity, to block PAI-1 repression. Treatment of HepG2 cells with therapeutic doses of lithium chloride (1∼2 mm) for 72 h resulted in significant induction of PAI-1 mRNA, similar to the effects of GSK3β-knockdown (Fig. 4C). To confirm that PAI-1 induction by lithium is due to derepression of the Rev-erbα pathway, we performed ChIP analysis to examine Rev-erbα and corepressor occupancy of the PAI-1 promoter before and after lithium treatment. Treatment with 1 mm lithium chloride abolished Rev-erbα and N-CoR binding to the endogenous PAI-1 promoter, accompanied by an increase in acetylated histone H4 in the same region (Fig. 4D). These results suggest that lithium antagonizes Rev-erbα-mediated repression, leading to increased PAI-1 gene expression. Derepression of the PAI-1 gene also led to an increase in PAI-1 protein levels and secretion (shown in Fig. 4E). Circadian Rhythm of PAI-1 Gene Expression Is Regulated Transcriptionally by Rev-erbα—Given that PAI-1 expression is circadian in vivo, as is Rev-erbα expression, we sought to determine whether Rev-erbα regulates the oscillatory expression of the PAI-1 gene. To address this question, we first sought to establish a cell culture system for studying PAI-1 circadian rhythm. NIH3T3 fibroblasts are a cell type known to sustain circadian rhythms in culture (41Balsalobre A. Damiola F. Schibler U. Cell. 1998; 93: 929-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1551) Google Scholar). Indeed, serum shock in wild-type NIH3T3 cells led to an immediate early induction in PAI-1 mRNA followed by robust cycling over 72 h (Fig. 5A). Next, we studied PAI-1 expression in NIH3T3 stable cell lines ectopically expressing either control green fluorescent protein (GFP), wild-type Rev-erbα, or a Rev-erbα mutant with both serines 55 and 59 mutated to aspartate (S55D/S59D), which mimics the phosphorylated state that stabilizes the protein (29Yin L. Wang J. Klein P.S. Lazar M.A. Science. 2006; 311: 1002-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). The expression of the transgenes was comparable at the mRNA level between WT and the S55D/S59D cell lines (Fig. 5B, inset). However, the WT and S55D/S59D Rev-erbα isoforms differ in their protein stability (29Yin L. Wang J. Klein P.S. Lazar M.A. Science. 2006; 311: 1002-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), resulting in differential ability to repress target genes. Lithium treatment induced expression of PAI-1 in control GFP cells and in cells ectopically expressing wild-type Reverbα, which is degraded when GSK3β is inhibited in this manner (29Yin L. Wang J. Klein P.S. Lazar M.A. Science. 2006; 311: 1002-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). By contrast, ectopic expression of the more stable S55D/S59D mutant Rev-erbα repressed endogenous PAI-1 expression in a lithium-insensitive manner (Fig. 5B), consistent with the increased stability of the protein in the presence of lithium. We next compared the ability of these cell lines to induce rhythmic PAI-1 gene expression in response to serum shock. Both GFP and WT Rev-erbα-expressing cells responded to serum shock by potently up-regulating the PAI-1 gene (Fig. 5C), similar to what was observed in normal NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 5A). In contrast, cells expressing S55D/S59D mutant Rev-erbα not only had lower basal PAI-1 gene expression but were also insensitive to serum (Fig. 5C). In the 72 h following serum shock, we detected rhythmic expression of PAI-1 mRNA in both GFP and WT Rev-erbα-expressing cells (Fig. 5D). However, the S55D/S59D Rev-erbα continued to suppress PAI-1 expression and completely abolished its circadian oscillation (Fig. 5D). These results indicate that Rev-erbα is a direct regulator of the endogenous rhythm of the PAI-1 gene. The protease inhibitor PAI-1 has gained recognition as an important modulator of cardiovascular disease. Clinical studies have correlated elevated PAI-1 levels to increased risk for coronary thrombosis and stroke, as well as decreased efficacy of thrombolytic therapy in the morning when PAI-1 production is at its circadian peak. Our work identifies the nuclear receptor Rev-erbα as a major regulator of PAI-1 transcription. Rev-erbα recruits the N-CoR·HDAC3 corepressor complex to the PAI-1 promoter as well as antagonizing its activation by the nuclear receptor RORα, making Rev-erbα a potent repressor of PAI-1 basal expression. As a negative component of the circadian core loop, Rev-erbα also regulates PAI-1 circadian rhythm, which is abolished by a stabilized form of Rev-erbα. The PAI-1 promoter is activated by the positive clock components CLOCK·BMAL (12Schoenhard J.A. Smith L.H. Painter C.A. Eren M. Johnson C.H. Vaughan D.E. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2003; 35: 473-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and to our knowledge the present work demonstrates the first negative transcriptional regulation of the PAI-1 gene by a core clock protein. Rev-erbα typically binds as a monomer to the hexameric sequence AGGTCA preceded by an A/T-rich flank (the RORE). We took note of two ROREs in the proximal PAI-1 promoter, located at –418 and –265 bp from the transcriptional start site. Although Rev-erbα binds cooperatively as a homodimer to ROREs in a DR2 configuration, it has also been demonstrated to function as a potent repressor from two monomer binding sites (31Harding H.P. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4791-4802Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 33Zamir I. Zhang J. Lazar M.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 835-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 34Yin L. Lazar M.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 1452-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Indeed, in the case of the PAI-1 promoter, mutation of either RORE dramatically abrogated repression. In addition to active repression through corepressor recruitment and histone deacetylation, Rev-erbα also antagonizes PAI-1 transcriptional activation by RORα, a constitutively active nuclear receptor that also recognizes the RORE. Cross-talk between the two nuclear receptors has been observed for a number of target genes, including Bmal1 and fibrinogen-β (37Chauvet C. Bois-Joyeux B. Fontaine C. Gervois P. Bernard M.A. Staels B. Danan J.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 2517-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 46Guillaumond F. Dardente H. Giguere V. Cermakian N. J. Biol. Rhythms. 2005; 20: 391-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Here we have found that this dual regulation also pertains to the PAI-1 gene; RORα potently induces PAI-1 expression, and this is antagonized by Rev-erbα. Interestingly, although RORα and Rev-erbα are both implicated in circadian gene regulation, RORα does not exhibit the robust cyclical mRNA expression that Rev-erbα does (47Ueda H.R. Chen W. Adachi A. Wakamatsu H. Hayashi S. Takasugi T. Nagano M. Nakahama K. Suzuki Y. Sugano S. Iino M. Shigeyoshi Y. Hashimoto S. Nature. 2002; 418: 534-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Indeed, ectopic expression of degradation-resistant Rev-erbα was sufficient to abolish oscillatory PAI-1 mRNA expression in NIH3T3 fibroblasts, whereas overexpression of the wild-type Rev-erbα did not. These results indicate that PAI-1 is a direct circadian output gene and that Rev-erbα affects PAI-1 rhythm through ROREs in its promoter. Consistent with the constitutive repression of PAI-1 expression by degradation-resistant Rev-erbα, destabilization of Reverbα as a result of GSK3β knockdown markedly derepressed the PAI-1 gene. Moreover, treatment of HepG2 human liver cells with lithium, which inhibits GSK3β activity, abolished Rev-erbα and corepressor N-CoR recruitment to the PAI-1 promoter, paralleled by an increase in histone acetylation, and thereby increased PAI-1 mRNA and protein production. Lithium is commonly prescribed for patients with bipolar disorder, and our finding that therapeutic concentrations induce PAI-1 via inhibition of the GSK3β-Rev-erbα stabilization pathway raises the question of whether such induction occurs in vivo. There is a surprising paucity of controlled studies of lithium cardiotoxicity in adult human subjects, but a case-controlled study (48Pratt L.A. Ford D.E. Crum R.M. Armenian H.K. Gallo J.J. Eaton W.W. Circulation. 1996; 94: 3123-3129Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar) suggests that lithium use is associated with a significantly increased risk of myocardial infarction, and it is possible that the effect of lithium on PAI-1 could contribute to this risk. Future studies should determine whether lithium treatment in humans results in physiologically significant elevations of PAI-1 and whether this poses a cardiovascular risk for patients receiving long-term lithium therapy. In summary, our data strongly suggest a role for Rev-erbα in determining PAI-1 gene expression and circadian rhythm. Pharmacological regulators of Rev-erbα and its associated corepressor complex, as well as its competitor, RORα, may represent new strategies for reducing PAI-1 expression in vivo and thereby preventing cardiovascular events.

https://openalex.org/W2065220409,"Oncogenes, rather than DNA damage, may provide the key signal to p53 to trigger tumour suppression. The protein p53 is an important mediator of the DNA damage response and tumour suppression in vertebrates. In general, these two attributes are thought to be causally linked: p53 suppresses tumours by responding to DNA damage or genome abnormalities in tumour cells and triggering growth arrest or apoptosis. Now using a reversibly switchable endogenous p53 mouse model, Christophorou et al. show that the pathological p53-induced response to irradiation is irrelevant to p53-mediated suppression of tumours induced by that irradiation. Conversely, restoring p53 at later times avoids the pathological effects of irradiation but provides much of the tumour suppression. These data suggest that the DNA damage response and tumour suppression are unlinked activities of p53, each induced by distinct signals. A similar conclusion is drawn from a separate experiment, the absence of the tumour suppressor protein ARF was found to abolish the extra cancer-protective activity of an additional copy of p53 in mice. Again, this suggests that oncogenic signalling is critical for triggering protection by p53, whereas activation of p53 as a result of DNA damage has a lesser impact on the final development of tumours. In News and Views, Anton Berns looks at the implications of these findings for models of p53 activity. The tumour-suppressor protein p53 provides the most important genetic defence against cancer1 and is activated in response to DNA damage and to oncogenic signalling, both of which occur almost universally in malignant tumours. But the relative contribution of these two pathways in inducing p53-dependent protection against cancer is unclear. Here we show that p53-dependent protection against cancer is lost in mice that have been genetically manipulated so that their p53 is activated in response to DNA damage but not to oncogenic signalling. We conclude that oncogenic signalling is the critical event that elicits p53-dependent protection and that the DNA-damage stimulus is less important."
https://openalex.org/W2158897596,"Retinal degeneration is a major cause of severe visual impairment or blindness. Understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms is a prerequisite to develop therapeutic approaches for human patients. We show in three mouse models that induced and inherited retinal degeneration induces LIF and CLC as members of the interleukin (IL)-6 family of proteins, activates proteins of the Jak-STAT signaling pathway, and up-regulates suppressors of cytokine signaling as a negative feedback loop. Inhibition of Jak2 leads to protection of photoreceptors in a model of induced but not in a model of inherited retinal degeneration. Differential activation of Akt suggests alternative pathways for cell death and/or survival in different models. Proteins induced during photoreceptor degeneration are not mainly expressed in photoreceptors but in cells of other retinal layers. This suggests a model in which photoreceptor injury is signaled to cells of the inner retina, which in turn initiate a response either to support viability or accelerate death of injured cells."

Unfortunately, the oxidant stress generated by prolonged hyperoxia can lead to respiratory failure, multiorgan failure, and death. Although the endothelial cell is known to be a target for hyperoxia-induced injury, its precise role is unclear. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and ""signal transducer and activator of transcription 3"" (STAT3) have been found to confer protection against endothelial cell injury. We sought to elucidate the specific roles of HO-1 and STAT3 in hyperoxic lung and endothelial cell injury. Mice or murine lung endothelial cells (MLEC) administered HO-1 siRNA exhibited marked injury and death compared with nonspecific siRNA. Overexpression of either HO-1 or STAT3 confers protection. However, HO-1 and its reaction product carbon monoxide (CO) lose their protective effects in the presence of STAT3 siRNA in MLEC or in endothelial-specific, STAT3-deficient mice. STAT3 overexpression is able to partially rescue HO-1-deficient MLEC from hyperoxia-induced cell death. Our results demonstrate 1) the importance of the endothelium in lethal hyperoxic injury, 2) HO-1 and CO require endothelial STAT3 for their protective effects, and 3) STAT3 confers endothelial cell protection via both HO-1-dependent and independent mechanisms."

In Manduca sexta cadherin (Bt-R1) and aminopeptidase-N (APN) proteins are recognized as Cry1A receptors. Previous work showed that Cry1Ab binds to Bt-R1 promoting the formation of a pre-pore oligomer that binds to APN leading to membrane insertion. In this work we characterized the binding epitopes involved in the sequential interaction of Cry1Ab with Bt-R1 and APN.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and toxin overlay binding competition assays in the presence of scFvL3-3, scFvM22, or synthetic peptides showed that domain II loop 3 is an important epitope for interaction with Bt-R1 receptor, whereas domain III β16 is involved in the interaction with APN. Both scFvL3-3 and scFvM22 lowered the toxicity of Cry1Ab to M. sexta larvae indicating that interaction with both receptors is important for in vivo toxicity. scFvL3-3 and anti-loop2 scFv (scFv73) promoted the formation of the pre-pore oligomer in contrast to scFvM22. In addition, scFvL3-3 and scFv73 preferentially recognized the monomeric toxin rather than the pre-pore suggesting a conformational change in domain II loops upon oligomerization.

Cry proteins are produced as protoxins of 70–130 kDa that are toxic to larval forms of several insects of different orders as well as to other invertebrates (1Bravo A. Soberón M. Gill S.S. Gilbert L.I. Iatrou K. Gill S.S. Comprehensive Molecular Insect Science. Vol. 6. Elsevier, Amsterdam2005: 175-206Google Scholar). Proteolytic activation of protoxin by midgut proteases produces Cry toxin fragments of 60–65 kDa. Cry toxins then bind to the cell surface where they undergo largescale irreversible conformational changes to convert them into an oligomeric form capable of inserting into the membrane, causing osmotic lysis of midgut cells and ultimately insect death (1Bravo A.

Griko N.B. Rose-Young L. Bulla Jr., L.A. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 1407-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 10Zhang X. Candas M. Griko N.B. Taussig R. Bulla Jr., L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 9897-9902Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) was recently proposed. It was proposed that the toxicity of Cry1Ab is mainly due to the interaction of monomeric Cy1Ab toxin with Bt-R1 by activating a Mg+2-dependent adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A signaling pathway that leads to apoptosis and not to pore formation induced by insertion of oligomeric Cry1Ab into the membrane (9Zhang X.

Therefore, additional experimental evidence is needed to discriminate between the two models of mode of action of Cry toxins, in particular evidence that determines the role of the APN receptor in toxicity of Cry1A toxins will be valuable. To date, the tertiary structures of six different Cry proteins, Cry1Aa, Cry2Aa, Cry3Aa, Cry3Bb, Cry4Aa, and Cry4Ba, have been determined by x-ray crystallography (11Grochulski P. Masson L.

All these structures display a high degree of similarity with a three-domain organization, suggesting a similar mode of action of the Cry three-domain protein family. The N-terminal domain (domain I) is a bundle of seven α-helices in which the central helix-α5 is hydrophobic and is encircled by six other amphipathic helices, this helical domain is responsible for membrane insertion and pore formation (11Grochulski P.

Domain II consists of three anti-parallel β-sheets with exposed loop regions, and domain III is a β-sandwich (11Grochulski P. Masson L. Borisova S. Pusztai-Carey M. Schwartz J.L. Brousseau R.

Iatrou K. Gill S.S. Comprehensive Molecular Insect Science. Vol. 6. Elsevier, Amsterdam2005: 175-206Google Scholar). The Cry1Aa, Cry1Ab, and Cry1Ac proteins share more than 95% amino acid sequence identity as protoxins and are selectively toxic to some lepidopteran insect pests. These Cry1A toxins bind to the same receptor molecules in M. sexta (Bt-R1 and APN) (17Keeton T.P. Francis B.R. Maaty W.S. Bulla L.A. Appl. Envionm. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 2158-2165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Masson L. Lu Y.-J. Mazza A. Brosseau R. Adang M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20309-20315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Domain I in the three toxins share more than 98% amino acid sequence identity. However, there are important differences in domains II and III of these toxins. Cry1Ab and Cry1Ac toxins share the same domain II in contrast to Cry1Aa that has a different domain II sharing only 69% identity. In particular, the loop regions involved in receptor interaction are different in Cry1Aa. In contrast, Cry1Aa and Cry1Ab share a very similar domain III, whereas domain III of Cry1Ac shares only 38% identity with both toxins. Because different lepidopteran insects show different sensitivity to these Cry1A toxins, it is likely that the differences in domains II and III influence the receptor binding affinities and the activity of these toxins. The characterization of the epitopes involved in interaction of Cry toxins with their receptors could give clues on the molecular basis of insect specificity and resistance. In previous work, using a synthetic phage-antibody library, we isolated an scFv antibody (scFv73) that binds to domain II loop 2 (β6–β7 loop) of Cry1A toxins and inhibited binding of Cry1A toxins to Bt-R1 but did not affect binding to APN (19Gómez I.

Sequence analysis of the CDR3H region of scFv73 led to the identification of an 8-amino acid epitope in Bt-R1 cadherin repeat 7 (CADR7, 869HITDTNNK876) involved in the binding to domain II loop 2 of Cry1A toxins (19Gómez I.

A second binding epitope in Bt-R1 CADR11 (1331IPLPASILTVTV1342) that interacts with domain II loop α8(α8a–α8b loop) and loop 2 of Cry1Ab toxin (21Gómez I. Dean D.H. Bravo A. Soberón M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10482-10489Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) was recently described. Finally, a third region in CADR12 of Bt-R1 (amino acids 1363–1464) involved in Cry1Ab interaction and toxicity was identified (22Hua G. Jurat-Fuentes J.L. Adang M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28051-28056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In the case of the Heliothis virescens cadherin, this binding region was narrowed to residues 1422–1440 by mutagenesis and shown to bind Cry1Ac domain II loop 3(β10–β11 loop) (23Xie R. Zhuang M.

Regarding interaction of Cry1A toxins with APN, Cry1Ac toxin binds to APN receptor by means of domain III that specifically recognizes N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) moieties in contrast to Cry1Aa and Cry1Ab toxins that show no GalNAc binding capacities (18Masson L. Lu Y.-J. Mazza A. Brosseau R. Adang M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20309-20315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Based on the use of monoclonal antibodies that competed binding of Cry1Aa with Bombix mori APN, the Cry1Aa-APN interacting epitopes were recently mapped in domain III β16 (508STLRVN513) and β22 (582VFTLSAHV589) residues, which are exposed and in close proximity in the three-dimensional structure (24Nakanishi K.

Tabunoki H. Watanabe A. Sato R. Appl. Environm. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 3966-3977Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Binding of Cry1Ab toxin to anti-loop 2 scFv73 antibody or to Bt-R1 CADR7 or CADR11 peptides facilitates the formation of the pre-pore oligomeric structure in vitro, showing that domain II interaction with Bt-R1 is an important step in the formation of the pre-pore oligomer before toxin inserts into the membrane (6Gómez I. Sánchez J. Miranda R. Bravo A. Soberón M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 21Gómez I. Dean D.H. Bravo A. Soberón M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10482-10489Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Although some binding epitopes in the toxin have been characterized, little is known about the mechanism by which the Cry1A toxins undergo a sequential interaction with the two receptors molecules. The characterization of the binding epitopes in the pre-pore oligomer and the role of these binding sites in the interaction with both Bt-R1 and APN is still missing. Furthermore, the characterization of possible structural changes in the toxin epitopes involved in receptor interaction could give clues on the mechanism of differential interaction of monomeric and pre-pore oligomeric structures with Bt-R1 and APN. Also, the study of the role of the interaction of the pre-pore with APN in Cry1Ab toxicity will be important to determine the role of pre-pore formation in toxicity. In this study, we constructed immune libraries for Cry1Ab toxin and selected specific monoclonal scFv fragments that recognize Cry1Ab domain II loop 3 or domain III β16–β22 epitopes and demonstrated that both scFv molecules can inhibit the toxicity to M. sexta larvae. An anti-loop 3 antibody inhibited binding of Cry1Ab to Bt-R1, whereas an anti-β16–β22 antibody inhibited interaction with APN. In vitro oligomer formation assays with the selected scFv antibodies showed that only binding of Cry1Ab domain II with Bt-R1 is involved in oligomer formation in contrast to binding of domain III with APN that did not facilitate the formation of the pre-pore. Overall, these results suggest that interaction of Cry1Ab with both receptor molecules is important for toxicity. Also these data contribute to our understanding of the mechanism involved in the sequential interaction of Cry1Ab toxin with both receptor molecules. Purification of Monomeric Cry Toxins—The acrystalliferous Bt strain 407cry– (26Lereclus D. Arantès O. Chaufax J. Lecadet M.-M. FEMS Microbiol.

Cry1Ac was produced from wild-type Bt strain HD73. Bt strains were grown for 3 days at 29 °C in nutrient broth sporulation medium (28Lereclus D. Agaisse H. Gominet M. Chaufaux J. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) supplemented with 10 μg/ml erythromycin for Cry1Aa and Cry1Ab. After sporulation, crystals were purified by sucrose gradients as reported (19Gómez I. Oltean D.I. Sanchez J. Bravo A. Gill S. Soberón M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28906-28912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The Cry1A protoxins were solubilized and proteolytically activated as reported (19Gómez I.

Oligomer Formation Assay—For activation, 1–2 μg of Cry1Ab protoxin was incubated with scFv molecules in the presence of M. sexta midgut juice as previously reported (6Gómez I. Sánchez J. Miranda R. Bravo A. Soberón M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Purification of the activated toxins was done by size exclusion chromatography with Superdex 200 HR 10/30 (Amersham Biosciences) FPLC size exclusion as described (29Rausell C. Muñoz-Garay C. Miranda-CassoLuengo R. Gómez I. Rudiño-Piñera E. Soberón M. Bravo A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 166-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The oligomeric structure was detected by Western blot assays using Cry1Ab-polyclonal antibodies as reported (6Gómez I. Sánchez J. Miranda R. Bravo A. Soberón M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Solubilization of GPI-anchored Proteins—M. sexta brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV) were treated with phospholipase C from Bacillus cereus (Sigma) as previously reported in Ref. 30Lorence A. Darszon A. Bravo A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar. Membranes were recovered by ultracentrifugation (90,000 x g for 20 min), and the supernatant was analyzed for aminopeptidase activity. APN enzymatic activity was measured using 1 mg/ml leucine-p-nitroanilide (Sigma) as substrate. BBMV proteins (5 μg) were mixed with APN buffer (0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.25 m NaCl) containing 1 mm leucine-p-nitroanilide. APN enzymatic activity was monitored as change in the absorbance at 405 nm for 10 min at room temperature. Rabbit Immunization—A New Zealand White rabbit was immunized subcutaneously with a mixture of oligomeric and monomeric Cry1Ab toxin structures obtained after proteolytical activation of Cry1Ab in the presence of scFv73. The rabbit was boosted three times with 1 mg of Cry1Ab toxin structure mixture, mixed with incomplete adjuvant, at 15-day intervals. The bone marrow and spleen were dissected 40 days after the primary immunization. Phage Display Library Construction—Total RNA was prepared from spleen tissue and bone marrow as described (31Hawlisch H. Meyer zu Vilsendorf A. Bautsch W. Klos A. Kohl J. J. Immunol. Methods. 2000; 236: 117-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Total RNA and random primer were used for first strand cDNA synthesis using a kit (Roche Applied Sciences), according to the manufacturer's instructions. From cDNA, heavy and light chain DNA fragments were amplified separately and recombined by three subsequent PCR, essentially as described (31Hawlisch H. Meyer zu Vilsendorf A. Bautsch W. Klos A. Kohl J. J. Immunol. Methods. 2000; 236: 117-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), except that PCR1 and PCR2 were done with Vent DNA polymerase (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA). Primer sequences for amplification of VL and VH antibody regions have been described before (31Hawlisch H. Meyer zu Vilsendorf A. Bautsch W. Klos A. Kohl J. J. Immunol. Methods. 2000; 236: 117-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, primers HH13, HH14, and HH15 sequences were corrected; HH13, 5′-GGCGGATCAGGAGGCGGAGGTTCTGGAGGTGGGAGTGMCCTCGATMTGACCCAGACTCCAGC-3′; HH14, 5′-GGCGGATCAGGAGGCGGAGGTTCTGGAGGTGGGAGTGMCCTCGTGMTGACCCAGACTCCAGC-3′; HH15, 5′-GGCGGATCAGGAGGCGGAGGTTCTGGAGGAGGTGGGAGTGMCCTCGTGMTGACCCAGACTCCATC-3′, where M = A/C. To construct the scFv libraries, scFv PCR products and phagemid vectors pCANTAB 5E and pSyn2 were digested with restriction enzymes SfiI and NotI (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA), gel purified, and ligated. The ligation products were purified by extraction with phenol/chloroform and ethanol precipitation. The purified DNA was electroporated into TG1 Escherichia coli cells. Each library was grown on TYE agar plates, supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and glucose (1% w/w). After overnight incubation at 37 °C, grown colonies were scraped off the agar plates, mixed with glycerol (20%), and stored at –70 °C. Libraries of 2.0 × 106 members were obtained. Selection and Characterization of Phage Displayed Antibodies—Preparation of phage particles for panning was done as described (19Gómez I. Oltean D.I. Sanchez J. Bravo A. Gill S. Soberón M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28906-28912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, Maxisorp immunotubes (Nunc, Denmark) were coated with Cry1Ab and blocked (19Gómez I.

The tubes were incubated with phage antibodies (1011 phage particles in MPBS skim milk 2% in PBS) and washed 10 times to remove unbound phage Abs (19Gómez I. Oltean D.I. Sanchez J. Bravo A. Gill S. Soberón M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28906-28912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The binders were eluted with triethylamine, and the eluant neutralized and mixed with 8.5 ml of exponentially growing TG1 cells to allow infection as described (19Gómez I. Oltean D.I. Sanchez J. Bravo A. Gill S. Soberón M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28906-28912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Cells were resuspended in 1 ml of medium, and plated on three TYE agar plates (145-mm diameter) as described (19Gómez I. Oltean D.I. Sanchez J. Bravo A. Gill S. Soberón M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28906-28912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). After overnight growth at 37 °C, bacteria were harvested and phage were rescued to produce phagemids for the next selection cycle. This panning cycle was done three times, after which polyclonal phage Abs from each round of selection were tested for binding activity in a phage ELISA. In the case of the panning of anti-domain III Cry1Ab antibodies, the last panning round was performed in the presence of 25 μg/ml soluble Cry1Ac toxin. Panning Selection Using Biotinylated Antigens—Streptavidin microtiter plates (Pierce) were coated with biotinylated Cry1Ab (10 nm) or biotin-loop 3 synthetic peptide (1 μm). Cry1Ab was biotinylated using biotinyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Panning was carried out essentially as described above, except that volumes were adapted for microtiter plates. Synthetic peptides (Table 1) were purchased from Invitrogen.TABLE 1Synthetic peptide sequencesNameSequenceDescriptionBiotin-loop 3Biotin-SGSSG-FRSGFSNSSVSCry1Ab residues 436-379 fused to biotin-SGSSG peptideLoop2LYRRPFNIGINNQQCry1Ab residues 366-379Loop3FRSGFSNSSVSIIRCry1Ab residues 436-449DIII-1GQISTLRVNITACry1Ab residues 506-517DIII-2VFTLSAHVFNCry1Ab residues 583-592 Open table in a new tab Phage or scFv ELISA—For phage ELISA, the microtiter plates were coated with 2.5 μg of Cry1Ab toxin in 100 μl of carbonate buffer (50 mm, pH 9.6) per well overnight at 4 °C. For scFv ELISA the microtiter plates were coated with 100 ng of Cry1Ab monomer or 100 ng of oligomer in 100 μl of carbonate buffer per well overnight at 4 °C. The plates were washed 3 times with PBS and blocked with 200 μl/well of MPBS skim milk 2% in PBS for 2 h at 37 °C. For phage ELISA, 100 μl of phage Abs (1 × 108 plaque-forming units) were added and incubated for 90 min at 25 °C. After washing, 100 μl of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-M13 antibody (1:1000 in MPBS skim milk 2% in PBS) was added and incubated as before. For scFv ELISA, 200 nm pure scFv molecules were added to the Cry1Ab monomeric- or oligomeric-coated wells and incubated for 90 min at 25 °C. scFv antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-His antibody (Qiagen) (1:5000 dilution). After washing 3 times with TPBS and 3 times with PBS, ortho-phenylenediamine (Sigma) (0.5 mg/ml, 30% H2O2) was used as substrate for detection. Reaction was stopped with 100 μl of 1 m H2SO4 and measured at 490 nm using a microplate reader. For competition assays, 1 μg of synthetic peptides were added during the incubation with the selected scFv phages. Nucleotide Sequence Determination and Fingerprint Analysis—To determine the diversity of the original libraries and clones after panning selection, we randomly picked infected TG1 colonies and amplified their scFv inserts with the PCR 5′ primer PSYN1 (ATACCTATTGCCTACGGC) and 3′ primer PSYN2 (TTACAACAGTCTATGCGG), or primers JK2 and AW1 (31Hawlisch H. Meyer zu Vilsendorf A. Bautsch W. Klos A. Kohl J. J. Immunol. Methods. 2000; 236: 117-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To obtain DNA fingerprint of the insert sequences, the PCR products were digested with AluI (New England Biosciences) and resolved on 8% acrylamide gels. Expression and Purification of Soluble scFv Antibodies—The positive phage clones were subcloned into expression vector pET22b (Novagen). Recombinants were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) and induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After"
https://openalex.org/W2085692902,"The processing and metabolism of amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a major interest in Alzheimer disease (AD) research, because not only amyloid β (Aβ) peptide, but also cellular or mitochondrial APP are intimately involved in cellular dysfunction and AD pathogenesis. Here we demonstrate that APP is directly and efficiently cleaved by the HtrA2 serine protease in vitro and in vivo. Using several APP mutants and N-terminal amino acid sequencing, we identified that the HtrA2-mediated APP cleavage product is the C161 fragment encompassing amino acids 535-695 of APP695. The immunofluorescence and subcellular fractionation studies indicate that APP is partly colocalized with HtrA2 in the mitochondria where HtrA2 can cleave APP under normal conditions. The HtrA2-cleaved C161 fragment was detected in the cytosolic fraction; therefore, we postulate that the C161 fragment is released into the cytosol after cleavage of APP by HtrA2. Interestingly, the level of C161 was remarkably decreased in motor neuron degeneration (mnd2) mice in which the serine protease activity of HtrA2 was greatly reduced. These results show that the protease activity of HtrA2 is essential for the production of C161 and that processing of APP into C161 is a natural event occurring under normal physiological conditions. Our study suggests that the direct cleavage of mitochondrial APP by HtrA2 may prevent mitochondrial dysfunction caused by accumulation of APP and that the regulation of HtrA2 protease activity may be a therapeutic target in AD.

Yankner B.A. Nature. 2000; 407: 802-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar). Neuronal loss in AD is accompanied by the progressive accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) peptide and the presence of neurofibrillary tangles made up of abnormally phosphorylated Tau protein (1Yuan J. Yankner B.A. Nature. 2000; 407: 802-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar, 2Selkoe D.J. Neuron. 1991; 6: 487-498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2160) Google Scholar). The Aβ peptide is generated by endoproteolytic processing of a large type 1 transmembrane protein, the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Numerous recent studies have demonstrated that in the amyloidogenic pathway, aspartic proteases called β- and γ-secretase sequentially cleave APP at the N and C termini of the Aβ peptide, respectively, leading to the formation of amyloidogenic or neurotoxic Aβ in the brains of AD patients (3Vassar R. Citron M. Neuron. 2000; 27: 419-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). In addition, APP can also undergo non-amyloidogenic processing by α-secretase to generate the 83-residue C-terminal APP fragment (C83) and an α- and γ-secretase cleaved APP fragment, p3 (Fig. 1A) (4Citron M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 920: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Recently, APP-like proteins (APLP1 and APLP2), which share similar domain structures with APP, were also shown to be processed by secretases (5Eggert S. Paliga K. Soba P. Evin G. Masters C.L. Weidemann A. Beyreuther K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18146-18156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar).Several lines of evidence indicate that other proteases are also involved in the proteolytic processing and degradation of APP. The cysteine protease calpain and caspases such as caspase-3, -6, -7, and -8 that play an important role for executing cell death in apoptosis can cleave APP, resulting in elevated toxic Aβ or C31 fragments that are associated with AD pathology (6Siman R.

Moreover, the APP cleavage by a trypsin-like serine protease has been reported in chicken sympathetic neurons (10Caswell M.D. Mok S.S. Henry A. Cappai R. Klug G. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Small D.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Also, HtrA1, a member of the HtrA serine proteases family, appears to be involved in proteolytic cleavage of Aβ and C99 (11Grau S. Baldi A. Bussani R. Tian X. Stefanescu R. Przybylski M. Richards P.

Although, research on the secretases and other APP processing proteases has made rapid progress, the exact mechanism and biological meaning of the APP processing and degradation remain elusive.Besides the primary role of APP processing into Aβ42 in AD, a number of in vivo and in vitro studies suggest that APP is intimately involved in AD pathogenesis (12Nishimura I.

Neuroreport. 1999; 10: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been reported that APP can accumulate in the mitochondria as a transmembrane-arrested form, causing mitochondrial dysfunction with impaired energy metabolism in cell culture systems as well as in the APP-transgenic mice, an animal model for AD (16Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Robin M.A. Avadhani N.G. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 41-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of mitochondrial dysfunction caused by APP accumulation remains unclear, and the molecules that physiologically regulate the functional metabolic balance of mitochondrial APP have not yet been identified.HtrA2 (also known as Omi) is a serine protease that localizes to the mitochondrial intermembrane space (17Uren R.T. Dewson G. Bonzon C. Lithgow T. Newmeyer D.D. Kluck R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2266-2274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 18Suzuki Y. Imai Y. Nakayama H.

Upon apoptosis induction by cellular stresses such as UV exposure, TRAIL, staurosporine, or etoposide, the processed, mature HtrA2 is released from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm and promotes cell death via two different mechanisms: a caspase-independent manner through its protease activity as well as in a caspase-dependent manner by antagonizing XIAP-mediated caspase-3 (18Suzuki Y.

Moreover, recent studies using motor neuron degeneration 2 (mnd2) and HtrA2 knock-out mice suggest that HtrA2 may play a crucial role in regulating mitochondria biogenesis through its serine protease activity in the mitochondria (23Jones J.M. Datta P. Srinivasula S.M. Ji W. Gupta S. Zhang Z. Davies E. Hajnoczky G. Saunders T.L. Van Keuren M.L. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Meisler M.H. Alnemri E.S.

Furthermore, we have previously shown that HtrA2 interacts with APP through the Aβ region (25Park H.J. Seong Y.M. Choi J.Y. Kang S. Rhim H. Neurosci. Lett. 2004; 357: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Therefore, the mitochondrial localization and binding capability of both HtrA2 and APP increases the possibility that HtrA2 serine protease may regulate the physiological or pathological role of APP. Here we demonstrate that the mitochondrial serine protease HtrA2 cleaves APP in vitro and in vivo. The functional relation between HtrA2 and APP was confirmed by the marked reduction of C161 in mnd2 mice. Taken together, our data suggests a possible role for HtrA2 in the cleavage or clearance of APP in the mitochondria.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals and Antibodies (Ab)—All chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Rabbit polyclonal anti-HtrA2 Ab was described previously (26Seong Y.M. Choi J.Y. Park H.J. Kim K.J. Ahn S.G. Seong G.H. Kim I.K. Kang S. Rhim H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37588-37596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Other antibodies used for immunoblot (IB) analyses were anti-APP (Sigma), anti-Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-FLAG (Sigma), anti-HSP60 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-caspase-3 (Upstate).Plasmid Construction—Plasmids encoding the various forms of HtrA2 and APP were previously described (25Park H.J. Seong Y.M. Choi J.Y. Kang S. Rhim H. Neurosci. Lett. 2004; 357: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 26Seong Y.M. Choi J.Y. Park H.J. Kim K.J. Ahn S.G. Seong G.H. Kim I.K. Kang S. Rhim H.

Protein Expression Purif. 2004; 33: 200-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To express the GST-APP (aa 1-695) fusion protein with the C-terminal Myc epitope tag in Escherichia coli, the pGST-APP695M plasmid was generated by digesting pCMV-APP695M with appropriate restriction enzymes, followed by inserting into the pGEX4T-3 plasmid (Amersham Biosciences). The pGST-C390M plasmid encoding the GST-APP (aa 306-695) fusion protein with the C-terminal Myc tag was generated by self-ligation after digesting the pGST-APP695M construct with SalI (5′) and XhoI (3′) restriction enzymes. The pGST-C109F plasmid encoding the GST-APP (aa 587-695) fusion protein with the C-terminal FLAG tag was generated by PCR from the pcDNA-LexA-APP751 plasmid and subcloned into the pGEX4T-1 plasmid. The pGST-C100 plasmid encoding APP (aa 596-695) was generated by digesting the pBS-C100 plasmid with BamHI (5′) and SalI (3′) (25Park H.J. Seong Y.M. Choi J.Y. Kang S. Rhim H. Neurosci. Lett. 2004; 357: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To construct the pGST-Asub-syn plasmid, the putative substrate portion (aa 449-598 of APP695) was generated by PCR from pCMV-APP695M plasmid as a template, and the amplified fragment was inserted into the pGST-β-synuclein (aa 88-134) plasmid in-frame between the GST epitope and the region of β-synuclein.To express APP (aa 535-695) as the C-terminal Myc-tagged or untagged proteins in mammalian cells, pCMV-C161M and pCMV-C161 plasmids were generated by PCR from pCMV-APP695M and pCMV-APP751 plasmids, respectively. The resulting amplified fragments were digested with BamHI (5′) and XhoI (3′) and inserted into the pcDNA3.0 plasmid (Invitrogen). The APLP plasmids (pcDNA-APLP1-650 and APLP2-751) were kindly provided by D. J. Selkoe.For all plasmid constructs, sequence integrity was verified by DNA sequencing with ABI Prism BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (Applied Biosystems), and expression was determined by IB analysis with the specific Abs. Details of all plasmid constructs and all primer sequences are available upon request.Purification of GST Fusion Proteins—GST fusion proteins expressed in E. coli were purified by selective binding to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (26Seong Y.M. Choi J.Y. Park H.J. Kim K.J. Ahn S.G. Seong G.H. Kim I.K. Kang S. Rhim H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37588-37596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The bead-bound GST fusion proteins were resuspended in 1× SDS loading buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 25% glycerol, 2% SDS, 14.4 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue) and resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE. For purification of GST-Δ133, the protein-bound beads were resuspended in 100 μl of elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 5 mm reduced glutathione. The GST-Δ133 protein was eluted from glutathione beads by incubation for 5 min at 37 °C. The purified GST-Δ133 protein was stored for endoproteolytic cleavage assays at -70 °C in a final concentration of 20% glycerol and 7 mm dithiothreitol.In Vitro Transcription and Translation—[35S]Met-labeled APP and APLP proteins were generated by using the in vitro TnT T7 Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The pCMV-APP and pcDNA-APLP plasmids were linearized with an appropriate restriction enzyme and incubated with 40 μl of TnT Quick master mixture containing 2 μl of [35S]methionine (10 mCi/ml) in a total volume of 50 μl for 90 min at 30 °C.In Vitro Proteolytic Cleavage Assays—For in vitro cleavage, [35S]Met-labeled APP or recombinant GST-APP proteins were incubated in the presence of 1-3 μg of recombinant GST-Δ133 in cleavage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mm dithiothreitol) at 37 °C for 3 h. The reactions were stopped by adding 1× SDS loading buffer. Cleavage products were resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE and detected either by IB assay or autoradiography.N-terminal Amino Acid Sequencing—Amino acids at the cleavage site were identified by N-terminal amino acid sequencing. The processed APP proteins were transferred electrophoretically onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and the transferred proteins were stained with Ponceau S solution. The cleaved fragment was excised from the membrane, and its N-terminal amino acid residues were identified by using the Procise 491 protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems) (Korea Basic Science Institute).Site-directed Mutagenesis—The QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions to generate a cleavage site mutant (APP695(R/R)M) of APP. The sequence integrity of the mutant plasmid construct was verified by DNA sequencing.Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 and HeLa cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). For all transfections into HEK293 and HeLa cells, the Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions.IB Assay—Transfected cells and mouse brain tissues were lysed in digitonin lysis buffer (0.2% digitonin, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 50 mm MgCl2) or RIPA buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate) containing protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated for 1 h on ice. The samples were analyzed by 12 or 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Protran). Blots were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in 5% nonfat dried milk in TBST (TBS buffer + 0.1% Tween 20). Membranes were incubated with primary Abs for 1 or 3 h, followed by processing with secondary Abs for 1 h at room temperature. The antigen-antibody complex was detected with the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit (Amersham Biosciences).Immunofluorescence Assay—Transfected cells were briefly washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min at room temperature, and followed by brief rinse with PBS. Cells were quenched for 10 min in PBS containing 50 mm NH4Cl and washed three times with PBS. For permeabilization, cells were incubated for 5 min in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and washed with PBS. Cells were blocked for 1 h with PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin at room temperature. After blocking, cells were incubated with anti-Myc Ab (1:1,000) or anti-HtrA2 Ab (1:1,000) in blocking solution for 2 h at room temperature, followed by incubating with Cy3-coupled anti-mouse IgG (1:500) or Alexa 488 anti-rabbit IgG (1:500) at room temperature, respectively. Between incubations, cells were washed three times with blocking solution at room temperature. After final washes with blocking solution, cells were washed with PBS for 5 min and incubated with 2 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole solution for 5 min. Subcellular localization of APP and HtrA2 was analyzed by inverted fluorescence microscopy (Carl Zeiss).Subcellular Fractionation—Cells were broken by passing 10 times through a G26 needle in buffer D (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)) containing protease inhibitors and 0.02% digitonin. Cell extracts were centrifuged at 900 × g for 2 min at 4 °C to recover pellets (Mito, the mitochondria-containing fraction) and supernatants (Cyto, the cytoplasmic fraction). The subcellular fractions were processed for IB analysis with anti-HtrA2, APP, HSP-60, or caspase-3 Abs.RNA Interference—HeLa cells were plated at 7 × 104 cells/well on 6-well plates. Cells were transfected with double-stranded small interfering RNA by using Lipofectamine reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Small interfering RNA oligonucleotides were made by Ambion and had the following sequences: siHtrA2 sense, 5′-r(GGGGAGUUUGUUGUUGCCA)d(TT)-3′; and siHtrA2 antisense, 5′-r(UGGCAACAACAAACUCCCC)d(TT)-3′ corresponding to residues 254-260 (24Martins L.M.

Cell.

To establish an in vitro assay for HtrA2 cleavage of the APP/APLP family members, we purified wild-type or mutant, mature HtrA2 as GST fusions by selective binding to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (GST-Δ133 or GST-Δ133 (S306A)) (Fig. 1, B and C). During expression of GST-Δ133 protein in E. coli and purification, protein fragments with lower molecular masses ranging from 30 to 50 kDa were detected in an SDS-PAGE system (Fig. 1C, left panel) (26Seong Y.M. Choi J.Y. Park H.J. Kim K.J. Ahn S.G. Seong G.H. Kim I.K. Kang S. Rhim H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37588-37596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). N-terminal amino acid sequencing of these fragments showed that GST-Δ133 proteolytically cleaved amino acid residues in the C-terminal region of GST fused to the N terminus of Δ133 (data not shown), whereas the GST itself was not affected by the proteolytic activity of HtrA2 (Fig. 1C, middle panel). We reconfirmed the serine protease activity of GST-Δ133 against β-casein as an exogenous substrate (Fig. 1C, right panel).To investigate the notion of whether APPs are directly cleaved by HtrA2, [35S]Met-labeled APP695M or APP751 was incubated with proteolytically active GST-Δ133 or inactive GST-Δ133 (S306A) (Fig. 1D). After a 3-h incubation, APP751 containing the kunitz-serine protease inhibitor domain, as well as APP695M were almost completely cleaved by GST-Δ133 (Fig. 1D, left panel). Subsequently, to clearly detect the HtrA2-cleaved APP fragments, we used a 3-fold amount of APP695M relative to that of the reaction shown in the left panel (Fig. 1D, right panel). The fragments of APP695M generated by HtrA2 proteolytic activity were further characterized by analogy with the previous study on APP cleavage by caspase-3. The 110-kDa APP was processed to three smaller polypeptides of ∼85-90 kDa by active caspase-3, whereas two major fragments of ∼32 and 50 kDa were generated by active HtrA2.It is well known that the APP family consists of three members: APP, APLP1, and APLP2. Alignment of amino acid sequences of the APP family shows that both APLPs are significantly homologous to APP: APP is 39.3 and 52.2% identical to APLP1 and APLP2, respectively (PIR: Protein Information Resource). Moreover, a recent study has shown that secretases cleave APP and APLPs in a similar manner (5Eggert S. Paliga K. Soba P. Evin G. Masters C.L. Weidemann A. Beyreuther K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18146-18156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). To determine whether APLP1 and APLP2 can also be cleaved by HtrA2, we incubated [35S]Met-labeled APLP1 and APLP2 with proteolytically active or inactive recombinant HtrA2 (Fig. 1E). After incubation, the 80-kDa APLP1 was processed into two major fragments of 65 and 67 kDa, and the 115-kDa APLP2 was processed into cleaved fragments of 103 and 109 kDa by active HtrA2 (Fig. 1E). These results indicate that the APP family members may serve as substrates for the human serine protease HtrA2.Identification of the HtrA2 Cleavage Site in APP—Although two major HtrA2-cleaved fragments of APP were detected by an in vitro cleavage assay using [35S]Met-labeled APP as a substrate, more feasible assays need to be developed for identifying the exact HtrA2-cleavage site in APP. To accomplish our purpose, we generated a series of GST-APP fusion constructs, and the GST-APP fusion proteins expressed in E. coli were purified and utilized to characterize the precise cleavage site through IB assay and N-terminal amino acid sequencing (Figs. 2 and 3).FIGURE 2Identification of the HtrA2 cleavage site in APP.

Arrow and asterisk indicate endogenous mature HtrA2 and a nonspecific band, respectively. D, APP is partly co-localized with HtrA2 in the mitochondria. HEK293 cells were transfected with APP, full-length HtrA2, and RFP-Mit as a mitochondrial marker. Subcellular localization of APP (red) and HtrA2 (green) was detected by immunofluorescence microscopy.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res"
https://openalex.org/W1999592577,"The Tom70 import receptor on the mitochondrial outer membrane specifically recognizes Hsp90 and Hsc70, a critical step for the import of mitochondrial preproteins, the targeting of which depends on these cytosolic chaperones. To analyze the role of Hsp90 in mitochondrial import, the effects of the Hsp90 inhibitors geldanamycin and novobiocin were compared. Geldanamycin occludes the N-terminal ATP-binding site of Hsp90, whereas novobiocin targets the C-terminal region of the chaperone. Here, novobiocin was found to inhibit preprotein import and, in particular, targeting to the purified cytosolic fragment of Tom70. Hsp90 cross-linking to preprotein and coprecipitation of Hsp90 with Tom70 were both impaired by novobiocin. Overall, novobiocin treatment increased preprotein aggregation, contributing to reduced import competence. In contrast, geldanamycin had no apparent effect on preprotein interactions with Hsp90, formation of preprotein-chaperone complexes, Hsp90 docking onto Tom70, or preprotein association with the outer membrane. Instead, geldanamycin impaired formation of preprotein import intermediates at the outer membrane. This suggests a novel active role for Hsp90 in import steps subsequent to Tom70 targeting. Our results outline the mechanisms of Hsp90 function in preprotein targeting and transport."
https://openalex.org/W2062745383,"Translational pausing can lead to cleavage of the A-site codon and facilitate recruitment of the transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA) (SsrA) quality control system to distressed ribosomes. We asked whether aminoacyl-tRNA binding site (A-site) mRNA cleavage occurs during regulatory translational pausing using the Escherichia coli SecM-mediated ribosome arrest as a model. We find that SecM ribosome arrest does not elicit efficient A-site cleavage, but instead allows degradation of downstream mRNA to the 3′-edge of the arrested ribosome. Characterization of SecM-arrested ribosomes shows the nascent peptide is covalently linked via glycine 165 to tRNA3Gly in the peptidyl-tRNA binding site, and prolyl−tRNA2Pro is bound to the A-site. Although A-site-cleaved mRNAs were not detected, tmRNA-mediated ssrA tagging after SecM glycine 165 was observed. This tmRNA activity results from sequestration of prolyl−tRNA2Pro on overexpressed SecM-arrested ribosomes, which produces a second population of stalled ribosomes with unoccupied A-sites. Indeed, compensatory overexpression of tRNA2Pro readily inhibits ssrA tagging after glycine 165, but has no effect on the duration of SecM ribosome arrest. We conclude that, under physiological conditions, the architecture of SecM-arrested ribosomes allows regulated translational pausing without interference from A-site cleavage or tmRNA activities. Moreover, it seems likely that A-site mRNA cleavage is generally avoided or inhibited during regulated ribosome pauses.

Ehrenberg, Gerdes and their colleagues (1Pedersen K. Zavialov A.V. Pavlov M.Y. Elf J. Gerdes K. Ehrenberg M. Cell. 2003; 112: 131-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar) first demonstrated that Escherichia coli RelE protein causes cleavage of A-site mRNA in vitro. Subsequently, A-site cleavage was also shown to occur at stop codons during inefficient translation termination in cells that lack RelE and related proteins (2Hayes C.S. Sauer R.T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 903-911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 3Sunohara T. Jojima K. Yamamoto Y. Inada T. Aiba H. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 2004; 10: 378-386Google Scholar). The latter finding indicates that another unknown A-site nuclease also exists in E. coli. Indeed, it is possible the ribosome itself catalyzes A-site cleavage. The molecular requirements for A-site cleavage are incompletely understood, but an unoccupied ribosome A site appears to be important for both RelE-dependent and RelE-independent nuclease activity (1Pedersen K. Zavialov A.V. Pavlov M.Y. Elf J. Gerdes K. Ehrenberg M. Cell. 2003; 112: 131-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 2Hayes C.S. Sauer R.T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 903-911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). A-site nuclease activity truncates mRNAs and produces stalled ribosomes that are unable to continue standard translation. In bacteria, ribosomes stalled at the 3′ termini of such truncated messages are “rescued” by the tmRNA quality control system. tmRNA is a specialized RNA that acts first as a tRNA to bind the A-site of stalled ribosomes, and then as an mRNA to direct the addition of the ssrA peptide degradation tag to the C terminus of the nascent polypeptide (4Karzai A.W. Roche E.D. Sauer R.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 5Keiler K.C. Waller P.R. Sauer R.T. Science. 1996; 271: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). As a result of tmRNA activity, incompletely synthesized proteins are targeted for proteolysis and stalled ribosomes undergo normal translation termination and recycling (5Keiler K.C. Waller P.R. Sauer R.T. Science. 1996; 271: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). In this manner, A-site mRNA cleavage and tmRNA work together as a translational quality control system that responds to paused and stalled ribosomes. Although a paused ribosome can be a manifestation of translational difficulty, translational pausing is also used to control and regulate protein synthesis. In many instances, the newly synthesized nascent peptide inhibits either translation elongation or termination (6Lovett P.S. Rogers E.J. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 366-385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Tenson T. Ehrenberg M. Cell. 2002; 108: 591-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). A recently described example is the SecM-mediated ribosome arrest, which controls expression of SecA protein from the secM-secA mRNA in E. coli (8Nakatogawa H. Murakami A. Ito K. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2004; 7: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The SecM nascent peptide interacts with the ribosome exit channel to elicit a site-specific ribosome arrest (9Nakatogawa H. Ito K. Cell. 2002; 108: 629-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). The SecM-stalled ribosome is postulated to disrupt a downstream mRNA secondary structure that sequesters the secA ribosome binding site (9Nakatogawa H. Ito K. Cell. 2002; 108: 629-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 10McNicholas P. Salavati R. Oliver D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 128-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thus, efficient initiation of secA translation depends upon ribosome pausing at the upstream secM open reading frame (11Murakami A. Nakatogawa H. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12330-12335Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). SecM-mediated ribosome pausing is regulated in turn by the activity of SecA protein. SecM is secreted co-translationally by the general Sec machinery, which is powered in part by the SecA ATPase (12Mori H. Ito K. Trends Microbiol. 2001; 9: 494-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). It is thought that the mechanical pulling force exerted by SecA on the SecM nascent chain during secretion alleviates the ribosome arrest and allows translation to continue (13Butkus M.E. Prundeanu L.B. Oliver D. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 6719-6722Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 14Nakatogawa H. Ito K. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 185-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). This intriguing regulatory circuit allows the cell to monitor protein secretion activity via ribosome pausing and adjust SecA synthesis accordingly. One outstanding question is how A-site cleavage and tmRNA activities affect regulatory translational pauses such as the SecM-mediated ribosome arrest. If all paused ribosomes are subject to A-site cleavage, then this nuclease activity would be expected to interfere with SecA regulation. The experiments presented in this paper demonstrate that A-site mRNA cleavage and the tmRNA quality control system do not significantly affect SecM-mediated ribosome arrest. Two recent reports have demonstrated that the A-site of SecM-arrested ribosomes is filled with tRNA (15Mitra K. Schaffitzel C. Fabiola F. Chapman M.S. Ban N. Frank J. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 16Muto H. Nakatogawa H. Ito K. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 545-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The cryo-EM structure from Frank and colleagues (15Mitra K. Schaffitzel C. Fabiola F. Chapman M.S. Ban N. Frank J. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) shows that ∼40% of SecM-arrested ribosomes contain a fully accommodated A-site tRNA. Ito and colleagues (16Muto H. Nakatogawa H. Ito K. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 545-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) have recently analyzed SecM-arrested ribosomes prepared by in vitro translation and concluded that the A-site tRNA is a prolyl-tRNAPro. In our analysis of SecM-arrested ribosomes in vivo, we also find that the P- and A-sites of the SecM-arrested ribosome are occupied with peptidyl- and aminoacyl-tRNAs, respectively. Additionally, we show that the occupied A-site prevents tmRNA recruitment during ribosome arrest and may also inhibit A-site mRNA cleavage. Thus, regulation by SecM ribosome arrest is able to operate efficiently in the presence of quality control systems that alleviate ribosome stalling. Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—Table 1 lists the bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study. All bacterial strains were derivatives of E. coli strain X90 (17Hayes C.S. Bose B. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33825-33832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Strain CH12 (X90(DE3)) was generated using the Novagen (DE3) λ lysogen kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Strain CH2198 (X90 ssrA(his6)(DE3)) was obtained by introducing the ssrA(His6) allele (18Hayes C.S. Bose B. Sauer R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3440-3445Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) of tmRNA into the ssrA chromosomal locus using the phage λ Red recombination method with minor modifications (17Hayes C.S. Bose B.

The rnr::kan disruption and the strain expressing truncated RNase E have been described previously (2Hayes C.S. Sauer R.T. Mol.

All gene disruptions and deletions were introduced into strain CH113 by phage P1-mediated transduction. The kanamycin resistance cassette was removed from strain CH113 Δrnb::kan using FLP recombinase as described (19Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11046) Google Scholar), allowing construction of the Δrnb rnr::kan double mutant. Lac- strains of X90 and X90 ssrA::cat were obtained by curing the strain of the F′ episome as described (17Hayes C.S. Bose B. Sauer R.T. J. Biol.

Open table in a new tab Plasmid pFG21b is a modified version of plasmid pET21d (Novagen), which encodes a FLAG peptide epitope between NcoI and NdeI restriction sites. Plasmid pFG21b allows the production of N-terminal FLAG-tagged proteins, provided the initiation Met codon is engineered into an NdeI restriction site. All expression plasmids were derived from plasmid pFG21b, with the exception of the LacZ translational fusions, which were constructed using a derivative of pTrc99a (GE Healthcare). Fragments containing secMA′ were obtained by PCR using oligonucleotide primers containing restriction endonuclease sites (underlined residues). The secMA′ fragment was amplified from E. coli genomic DNA with oligonucleotides secM-Nde (5′-GGATGGCAATCATATGAGTGGAATACTGACGCGCTGG), and secA-Bam (5′-CCGGGATCCGATTTTCCAGCACTTCGCC). The (Δss)secMA′ fragment was generated with the secA-Bam primer and secM-A38 (5′-CCTGCGCTCAGCCATATGGCCGAACCAAACGCGCCCGC). The PCR products were digested with NdeI and BamHI and ligated to plasmid pFG21b. The mutation changing SecM residue proline 166 to alanine was made using primer secM-P166A (5′-CCGTGCTGGCGCTCAACGCCTCACC) in combination with primers secA-Bam and secM-A38 by the PCR megaprimer method (21Aiyar A. Leis J. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 366-369PubMed Google Scholar). LacZ translational fusions were made in two steps: (i) ligation of the various secMA′ NdeI/BamHI fragments into plasmid pTrc3 followed by, (ii) ligation of a BamHI/HindIII fragment containing the E. coli lacZ gene. The lacZ fragment was produced by PCR using primers, lacZ-Bam (5′-AGGGATCCAAATGATTACGGATTCACTGGCCGTCG) and lacZ-Hind (5′-GGATAAGCTTACGCGAAATACGGGCAGACATGGC). Plasmid pTrxA-SecM′-TrxA was constructed from pFG21b in three steps. Two distinct trxA-containing PCR products were generated: the first from primers trxA-Nde (5′-GTGGAGTTACATATGAGCGATAAAATTATTCACC) and trxA-Bam (5′-AAATGGATCCCCGCCAGGTTAGCGTCGAGGAACTC); and the second from primers trxA-Eco (5′-ATAGAATTCCGATAAAATTCACCTGACTGACGAC) and trxA-Xho (5′-GAACTCGAGATTCCCTTACGCCAGGTTAGCGTCG). The two trxA PCR fragments were sequentially ligated into pFG21b using NdeI/BamHI and EcoRI/XhoI digestions to generate plasmid pTrx-Trx. The oligonucleotides ts′t-top (5′-GATCCAATTCAGCACGCCCGTCTGGATAAGCCAGGCGCAAGGCATCCGTGCTGGCCCTCAG) and ts′t-bottom (5′-AATTCTGAGGGCCAGCACGGATGCCTTGCGCCTGGCTTATCCAGACGGGCGTGCTGAATTG) were annealed to one another and ligated to BamHI/EcoRI-digested plasmid pTrx-Trx to generate pTrx-SecM′-Trx. Similarly, pSecM′ was generated by annealing secM′-top (5′-TATGCAATTCAGCACGCCGGTCTGGATAAGCCAGGCGCAAGGAATCCGTGCTGGCCCTCAAAAG) and secM′-bottom (5′-AATTCTTTTGAGGGCCAGCACGGATTCCTTGCGCCTGGCTTATCCAGACCGGCGTGCTGAATTGCA) followed by ligation to NdeI/EcoRI-digested pFG21b. The ptRNA2Pro overexpression plasmid was constructed by amplifying the proL gene and its promoter with primers proL-Sac (5′-CTGGAGCTCAACAATAACGGTAAATACC), and proL-Kpn (5′-AGCGGTACCTTGTCAGTCAGCTATGG) followed by ligation of the resulting PCR product into SacI/KpnI-digested plasmid pCH405Δ (2Hayes C.S. Sauer R.T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 903-911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 17Hayes C.S. Bose B. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33825-33832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). mRNA Expression and RNA Analysis—E. coli strains were grown overnight at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics (150 μg/ml of ampicillin, 25 μg/ml of tetracycline, or 50 μg/ml of kanamycin). The next day, cells were resuspended at an optical density at 600 nm (A600) of 0.05 in 15 ml of fresh medium and grown at 37 °C with aeration. Once cultures reached an A600 of ∼0.3, mRNA expression was induced with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1.5 mm). After further incubation for 30 min, 15 ml of ice-cold methanol was added to the cultures, the cells collected by centrifugation, and the cell pellets frozen at -80 °C. Total RNA was extracted from cell pellets using 1.0 ml of a solution containing 0.6 m ammonium isothiocyanate, 2 m guanidinium isothiocyanate, 0.1 m sodium acetate (pH 4.0), 5% glycerol, 40% phenol. The disrupted cell suspension was extracted with 0.2 ml of chloroform, the aqueous phase removed and added to an equal volume of isopropyl alcohol to precipitate total RNA. RNA pellets were washed once with ice-cold 75% ethanol and dissolved in either 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA or 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.2), 1 mm EDTA. Northern blot and S1 nuclease protection analyses of all mRNAs were performed as described (2Hayes C.S. Sauer R.T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 903-911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis to identify the nascent peptidyl-tRNA species was performed using acid urea gels as described (22Varshney U. Lee C.P. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24712-24718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications. Total RNA (10 μg) was separated on 50% urea, 100 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.2), 1 mm EDTA, 6% polyacrylamide gels run at 4 °C. Gels were briefly soaked in 0.5 × Tris borate-EDTA (TBE) buffer before electroblotting (250 mA) to positively charged nylon membrane in 0.5 × TBE for 1 h at 4 °C. All subsequent Northern hybridization conditions were as described (2Hayes C.S. Sauer R.T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 903-911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The following radiolabeled DNA oligonucleotide probes were used in hybridizations: proL for tRNA2Pro (5′-CACCCCATGACGGTGCG); proK for tRNA1Pro (5′-CTTCGTCCCGAACGAAGTG); glyV for tRNA3Gly (5′-CTTGGCAAGGTCGTGCT); argQ for RNA2Arg (5′-CCTCCGACCGCTCGGTTCG); and RBS for pET-derived ribosome binding site (5′-GTATATCTCCTTCTTAAAGTTAAAC). The following radiolabeled DNA oligonucleotides were used as probes for S1 nuclease protection experiments: secM S1 probe (5′-TTAATAAAATGAAGTAAAGGTTTATTGTTGTTAGGTGAGGCGTTGAGGGCCAGCACGGATGCCTTGCGCCTGGCTTATCC) and secM′-trxA S1 probe (5′-CTGTCGTCAGTCAGGTGAATTTTATCGGAATTCTGAGGGCCAGCACGGATGCCTTGCGCCTGGCTTATCCAG). SecM Expression and Protein Analysis—Strains were cultured as described above for RNA analysis. Protein extraction and Western blot analyses were conducted as described (17Hayes C.S. Bose B. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33825-33832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Anti-His6 polyclonal antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biochemical. Monoclonal antibodies specific for E. coli β-galactosidase and the FLAG M2 epitope were obtained from Sigma. SsrA(His6)-tagged SecM proteins were purified by Ni2+-NTA agarose (Qiagen) affinity chromatography as described (17Hayes C.S. Bose B. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33825-33832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 18Hayes C.S. Bose B. Sauer R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3440-3445Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Ni2+-NTA purified protein was further purified by reverse phase HPLC. N-terminal gas-phase sequencing was performed on a Porton 2020 protein sequencer (Beckman-Coulter) with a dedicated in-line HPLC (model 2090) for separation of phenylthiohydantoin derivatives. Molecular masses were determined by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Samples were applied to a Zorbax 300SB-C18 reverse phase column in aqueous 0.1% formic acid and proteins eluted using a linear gradient of acetonitrile using an Agilent 1100 LC nano-system. Eluted proteins were infused into a Waters Q-Tof II™ mass spectrometer for ionization. β-Galactosidase assays were conducted essentially as described (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Strains expressing secA′::lacZ translational fusions were inoculated at A600 of 0.05 in LB medium and grown at 37 °C with aeration to A600 of 0.3-0.6. β-Galactosidase activity for each construct was measured from 5 to 8 independent cultures and reported as mean ± S.D. Cell Extract Fractionation—Strains CH12 Δrna::kan and CH113 Δrna::kan containing plasmid pSecM′ or pSecM′-(P166A) were grown in 1 liter of LB media at 37 °C with aeration in Fernbach flasks. At A600 ∼ 0.6, SecM′ expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to 1.5 mm and cultures incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with aeration. Cultures were harvested over ice, the cells were collected by centrifugation and washed once with cold, high-Mg2+ S30 buffer (60 mm potassium acetate, 30 mm magnesium acetate, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.0)). Washed bacterial pellets were resuspended in 10 ml of cold high-Mg2+ S30 buffer and the cells were broken by one passage through a French press at 12,000 p.s.i. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants layered onto cushions of cold high-Mg2+ S30 buffer containing 1.1 m sucrose in ultracentrifuge tubes (Beckman number 344057). Samples were centrifuged in a Beckman-Coulter Optima™ ultracentrifuge at 45,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C using an MLS-50 rotor. Total RNA was extracted from the high-speed supernatants and pellets for analysis as described above. SecM Ribosome Arrest Leads to mRNA Cleavage—To determine whether SecM-mediated ribosome arrest leads to A-site cleavage, we generated plasmids to express mRNA encoding SecM and the first 62 residues of SecA (Fig. 1A). Three SecM variants were used throughout this work: (i) FLAG-SecM, which is the wild-type protein fused to an N-terminal FLAG epitope tag; (ii) FLAG-(Δss)SecM, which lacks the secretion signal sequence (Δss = deleted signal sequence; residues 1-37); and (iii) FLAG-(Δss-P166A)SecM, which lacks the signal sequence and has alanine in place of proline 166. Deletion of the SecM signal sequence prevents its secretion and leads to a pro-found ribosome arrest, whereas the P166A variant completely abrogates arrest (9Nakatogawa H. Ito K. Cell. 2002; 108: 629-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 14Nakatogawa H. Ito K. Mol.

However, secretion of FLAG-SecM protein resulted in the removal of the FLAG epitope along with the signal sequence (see below). Each SecM protein was expressed in wild-type cells (tmRNA+) and cells that lack tmRNA (ΔtmRNA), and the corresponding messages examined by Northern blot analysis using a probe specific for the ribosome binding site upstream of secM. In addition to the full-length mRNAs, truncated flag-secMA′ and flag-(Δss)secMA′ messages were also detected (Fig. 1B). The truncated mRNAs did not hybridize to a probe specific for the downstream secA sequence (data not shown). No truncated flag-(Δss-P166A)secMA′ mRNA was apparent, suggesting that ribosome arrest was required for mRNA cleavage. Interestingly, steady state levels of truncated flag-secMA′ and flag-(Δss)secMA′ mRNAs were similar in wild-type and ΔtmRNA cells (Fig. 1B). This finding was noteworthy because tmRNA activity usually promotes rapid degradation of truncated mRNAs, including those produced by A-site mRNA cleavage (2Hayes C.S. Sauer R.T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 903-911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 3Sunohara T. Jojima K. Yamamoto Y. Inada T. Aiba H.

Moreover, the truncated mRNAs appeared to be somewhat larger than in vitro transcripts that terminate in the codon for glutamine 167, a position that is adjacent to the A-site of the arrested ribosome (Fig. 1, A and B) (16Muto H. Nakatogawa H. Ito K. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 545-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The 3′ ends of the truncated messages were mapped more precisely using S1 nuclease protection analysis. The termini were somewhat heterogeneous but strong cleavage was detected inside and adjacent to the secM stop codon (Fig. 1C). No cleavages were detected in the codon for glutamine 167, which would have produced an S1 protection pattern similar to that observed with the truncated control in vitro transcript (Fig. 1C, truncated lane). As suggested by the Northern analysis described above, mRNA cleavage occurred ∼13 to 19 nucleotides downstream of the predicted A-site codon during SecM ribosome arrest. 3′ → 5′ Exonucleases Generate Truncated secM mRNA during Ribosome Arrest—Two models account for ribosome arrest-dependent cleavage at the secM stop codon: (i) A-site cleavage due to inefficient translation termination as originally described in Refs. 2Hayes C.S.

RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 2004; 10: 378-386Google Scholar, or (ii) exonucleolytic trimming of downstream mRNA to the 3′ margin of the arrested ribosome. To differentiate between these possibilities, we fused secM codons 150-166 in-frame between two thioredoxin genes (trxA). The encoded FLAG-TrxA-SecM′-TrxA fusion protein contained the minimal SecM peptide motif (150FST-PVWISQAQGIRAGP166) sufficient for ribosome arrest (9Nakatogawa H. Ito K. Cell. 2002; 108: 629-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the wild-type secM gene, the flag-trxA-secM′-trxA stop codon is positioned several hundred nucleotides downstream of the predicted ribosome arrest site (21Aiyar A. Leis J. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 366-369PubMed Google Scholar). Northern analysis of flag-trxA-secM′-trxA mRNA also showed ribosome arrest-dependent truncated messages (data not shown), and S1 nuclease protection analysis detected two prominent cleavage sites at 13 and 19 nucleotides downstream of the proline 166 codon (wild-type SecM numbering) (Fig. 2B, wild-type lane). The cleavages were the same distance from the proline 166 codon as was observed with flag-secMA′ and flag-(Δss)secMA′ mRNAs (Figs. 1C and 2A). Although the cleavage patterns were not strictly identical between truncated messages, the secM stop codon was clearly not required for mRNA cleavage. We reasoned that if ribosome arrest-dependent mRNA cleavage was due to exonuclease activity, then cleavage could be modulated by deletion of known 3′ → 5′ exoribonucleases. Fig. 2B shows the effects of specific exoribonuclease deletions on mRNA cleavage using the flag-trxA-secM′-trxA message. Deletion of RNase R leads to an increase in the +19 cleavage product and a decrease in the +13 cleavage product compared with wild-type (Fig. 2B). Similarly, removing polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) activity also lead to increased levels of the +19 product (Fig. 2B). In contrast, there was a slight decrease in the +19 product in ΔRNase II cells (Fig. 2B). The RNase R/RNase II double deletion strain exhibited less cleavage at both sites, whereas deletion of the C-terminal domain of RNase E had little effect on cleavage (Fig. 2B). Although RNase E is an endoribonuclease, the C-terminal domain is required for the organization of the degradosome, a multienzyme complex that contains PNPase and is important for the degradation of many mRNAs in E. coli (25Carpousis A.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 150-155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Vanzo N.F. Li Y.S. Py B. Blum E. Higgins C.F. Raynal L.C. Krisch H.M. Carpousis A.J.

Triad3A is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that interacts with the Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain of TLRs and promotes their proteolytic degradation. In the present study, we further investigated its activity on signaling molecules downstream of TLRs and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor 1. Triad3A promoted down-regulation of two TIR domain-containing adapter proteins, TIRAP and TRIF, as well as a RIP1 but had no effect on other adapter molecules in either the TLRs or TNF-α signaling pathways. Multiple sequence alignment analysis suggested that RIP1 contains a TIR homologous domain, and mutation of amino acid residues in this domain identified three residues critical for its interaction with Triad3A. Moreover, Triad3A acted as a negative regulator in TNF-α signaling. Reduction of Triad3A expression by small interference RNAs rendered cells hyperresponsive to TNF-α stimulation. Conversely, overexpression of Triad3A in cells blocked TNF-α-induced cell activation. This negative regulation was effected independently of changes in the cellular protein level of RIP1. Further studies indicated that RIP1 formed a complex with Triad3A and heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), which is a chaperone protein capable of maintaining the stability of its client proteins. Treatment of cells with geldanamycin to disrupt the Hsp90 complex led to proteasomal degradation of RIP1. Depletion of Triad3A by small interference RNA treatment inhibited geldanamycin-activated ubiquitination and proteolytic degradation of RIP1. These results suggest that Triad3A is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase to RIP1 and that Hsp90 and Triad3A cooperatively maintain the homeostasis of RIP1.

Ubiquitination is one of the most common pathways to target proteins for 26S proteasomal degradation. Proteins are covalently modified by the ubiquitin conjugation system, which is composed of three classes of enzymes: ubiquitin-activating enzymes (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2, or Ubc), and ubiquitin-protein ligases (E3). The E3 ligases play an important role in target protein recognition and promote the formation of an isopeptide bond between ubiquitin and target proteins. Based on their structure, most of the E3 ligases are classified into three groups, HECT (homologous to E6-AP C terminus), RING finger, and U box types (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Varshavsky A. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1073-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 2Pickart C.M. Eddins M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar, 3Ardley H.C.

Several chemical agents, including geldanamycin (GA), 17-allyl-amino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin, radicocol, and ansamycin have been used to disrupt the complex of Hsp90 to probe its functions. These drugs bind tightly to the ATP/ADP pocket of the Hsp90 and inhibit its interaction with client proteins (8Chiosis G. Lucas B. Huezo H. Solit D. Basso A. Rosen N. Curr.

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are key pathogen-recognition receptors in innate immune cells for detection of diverse pathogen-associated molecular patterns from microbes (10Aderem A. Ulevitch R.J.

Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1518: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). These TLRs share some common structural features, including an ectodomain consisting of multiple leucine-rich repeats and a cysteine-rich domain, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain. The putative ligand binding occurs within the ectodomain, whereas the TIR domain provides a key site for homotypic interaction with TIR domain-containing adapter proteins in the MyD88 family (15Imler J.L. Hoffmann J.A. Rev. Immunogenet. 2000; 2: 294-304PubMed Google Scholar, 16Daun J.M. Fenton M.J. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2000; 20: 843-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Currently five proteins in this family have been identified. These are MyD88, TIRAP/Mal, TRIF/TI-CAM-1, TIRP/TRAM, and SRAM (17O'Neill L.A. Fitzgerald K.A. Bowie A.G. Trends Immunol. 2003; 24: 286-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). With the exception of TLR3, all TLRs signal through a MyD88-dependent pathway. In this pathway, the MyD88 is recruited to the TLRs and then associates with proteins in the interleukin-1R-associated kinase family (IRAK1-4), which in turn activate the downstream TRAF6 and TAK1 proteins leading to the activation of NF-κB and stress kinases. In addition to this pathway, TLR4 and TLR3 utilize a MyD88-independent pathway, recruiting TRIF to activate interferon regulator factor 3 and NF-κB. Interferon regulatory factor 3 activation involves a TBK1 and IκB kinase ϵ/IκB kinase i complex. Activation of NF-κB may involve TRAF6 and RIP1 because the N-terminal region of TRIF contains three TRAF6 binding sites and the C-terminal region contains a RIP1 homotypic interaction motif (RHIM). As to the other TIR domain-containing adapter proteins, TIRAP has been shown to be essential for MyD88-dependent TLR2 and TLR4 signaling and TIRP is essential for the TLR4-mediated MyD88-independent/TRIF-dependent pathway, whereas the role of SRAM in TLR signaling has not yet been studied (18Akira S.

Triad3A is a RING finger E3 ligase identified in a yeast two-hybrid screening using the TIR domain of TLR9 as bait (22Chuang T.H. Ulevitch R.J. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). This E3 ligase promotes ubiquitination and proteolytic degradation of TLR4 and TLR9 and negatively regulates their activation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and CpG-DNA, respectively (22Chuang T.H. Ulevitch R.J. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Triad3A is the most abundant alternatively spliced form of the Triad3 family. The other two members are Triad3 and Triad3B (22Chuang T.H. Ulevitch R.J. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Triad3, also called ZIN (zinc finger protein inhibiting NF-κB), was shown to interact with RIP1 in a yeast two-hybrid screening (23Chen D. Li X. Zhai Z. Shu H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15985-15991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). RIP1 contains an N-terminal kinase domain, a RHIM motif, and a C-terminal death domain and is essential for TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation (21Meylan E. Burns K. Hofmann K. Blancheteau V. Martinon F. Kelliher M. Tschopp J. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 24Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V.

Immunity. 1998; 8: 297-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). Given that Triad3A is capable of binding to the TIR domains of TLR4 and TLR9, we reasoned that Triad3A may also be able to regulate proteolytic degradation of the TIR domain-containing adapter molecules involved in TLR signaling and that RIP1 may contain a TIR-homologous (TIRH) domain with some conserved motifs that allow for interaction with Triad3 family members. In this study, we investigated the activity of Triad3A toward different adapter molecules in the TLR and TNF-α signaling pathways and further investigated its cellular functions, in cooperation with Hsp90, to control the ubiquitination and proteolytic degradation of RIP1. Reagents and Antibodies—LPS (Re595) from Salmonella minnesota R595, anti-FLAG monoclonal antibodies, and geldanamycin were purchased from Sigma. TNF-α was purchased from PeproTech Inc. (Rocky Hill, NJ). Anti-Myc, anti-TNF-R1, and anti-actin monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-ubiquitin and anti-RIP1 monoclonal antibodies were purchased from BD Biosciences. Anti-Hsp90 polyclonal antibody was purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Anti-TRIF and anti-Triad3A polyclonal antibodies were generated by using recombinant proteins purified from an Escherichia coli expression system (Novogen/EMD Bioscience, Madison, WI). Lactacystin and MG132 were purchased from EMD Biosciences (San Diego, CA). Pefabloc and E64 were purchased from Roche Applied Science. Plasmid Constructs—Mammalian expression vectors for Triad3A and various adapter proteins were generated by PCR amplifications from first strand cDNA libraries prepared from poly(A+)-mRNA isolated from human placenta and spleen (purchased from Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) as previously described (26Chuang T.H. Ulevitch R.J. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 2000; 11: 372-378PubMed Google Scholar) and subcloned into PRK5 expression vectors containing a FLAG or Myc epitope tag. Full-length TNF-R1 cDNA was subcloned into PEF6 vector. Expression vectors for truncated and point-mutated RIP1 were constructed by subcloning cDNAs encoding the truncated or mutated proteins into the PRK5 mammalian expression vector with an N-terminal Myc tag. The numbers of each construct indicate the N-terminal and C-terminal amino acid residues or indicate the residue that was substituted. Computational Analysis—Domain architecture of RIP1 and TIR domain-containing adapter proteins were analyzed by a SMART architecture research computer program (smart.EMBL-heidelberg.de/). Protein sequence alignments were performed with AlignX of the Vector NTI computer program (Informax, Inc., Bethesda, MD). RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNAs were isolated from plasmidtransfected 293 cells using an RNA isolation kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). First strand cDNA was prepared from total RNA samples using a SuperScript™ preamplification kit (Invitrogen). PCR amplifications were performed using an Expand HI Fid PCR kit (Roche Applied Science). The sequences of the gene-specific primers used are as follows: TIRAP (5′-TACCTCACAGGACAACCCACTACC-3′, 5′-AGATCAGATACTGTAGCTGAATCCCG-3′), TRIF (5′-AGATACCACCTCTCCAAATACCAAGC-3′, 5′-CATCTGTGCCTGGTAGGACAAGTAG-3′), RIP1 (5′-GTCAAATTCAGCCACAGAACAGCC-3′, 5′-CCCTTTATGCCTTCCCTCATCACC-3′), G3PDH (5′-TGAAGGTCGGAGTCAACGGATTTGGT-3′, 5′-CATGTGGGCCATGAGGTCCACCAC-3′). PCR products were visualized by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel after staining with ethidium bromide. Cell Culture, Transfection, and NF-κB Reporter Assays—Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were plated in 6-well plates and transfected on the following day using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with differing amounts of expression vectors as indicated. For NF-κB reporter assay, ELAM-1 luciferase reporter plasmid (100 ng) and β-galactosidase plasmid (100 ng), supplemented with empty pBluescript vector to 1 μg, were co-transfected into the cells. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were treated with 10 ng/ml TNF-α for 8 h. The cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was determined using reagents from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). Relative luciferase activities were calculated as -fold of induction compared with an unstimulated vector control. The data are presented as means ± S.E. (n = 3). RNA Interference—Three siRNAs targeting different positions on the cDNA sequence as indicated by the numbers were designed to deplete endogenous Triad3A expression. Their target sequences are: siRNA(1067): AACCCAGATTATCCAAAGAGA, siRNA(1242): AAGTGCTCAGTAGTCAGGACA, and siRNA(1553): AAAGAGATGGCAGAGCATGAA. These siRNA oligonucleotides were synthesized by Qiagen. A control non-silencing siRNA with target sequence AATTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT was purchased from Qiagen. 293 cells seeded in six-well plates were transfected with these siRNAs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 24 h, these cells were split 1 to 2.5 into another six-well plate. This procedure of transfection and splitting was repeated twice more. The cells were then treated with 10 ng/ml TNF-α or 1 μm geldanamycin. In some experiments, 100 ng of ELAM-1 luciferase reporter plasmid and 100 ng of β-galactosidase plasmid were co-transfected with the last siRNA transfection for the NF-κB reporter assay. Immunoblotting—Cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P; Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min and then incubated with the indicated antibody in phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.5% nonfat milk for 2 h. After washes, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) for 50 min. After subsequent washes, the immunoreactive bands were visualized with ECL+Plus Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Co-immunoprecipitation—Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 0.5% NonidetP-40, plus complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). For analysis of ubiquitinated proteins, the lysis buffer was supplemented with 0.1 mm ALLnL and 5 mm indoacetamide. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation and incubated with indicated antibody plus protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C overnight to form immunocomplexes. After extensive washing with lysis buffer, the immunocomplexes were analyzed by immunoblotting as described. Triad3A Promotes Down-regulation of TIRAP, TRIF, and RIP1—We have shown previously that Triad3A regulates ubiquitination and proteolytic degradation of several TLRs (22Chuang T.H. Ulevitch R.J. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). In addition, ZIN/Triad3 was reported to interact with RIP1 (23Chen D. Li X. Zhai Z. Shu H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15985-15991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To investigate whether Triad3A also promotes down-regulation of any of the TIR domain-containing adapter proteins and RIP1, we co-transfected 293 cells with expression vectors for Triad3A and various adapter proteins in the TLR and TNF-α signaling pathways. These adapter proteins included members of the MyD88 family (MyD88, TIRAP, TRIF, and TIRP), IRAK family members (IRAK, kinase inactive IRAK(K239A), IRAK-M, and IRAK4), TRAF2, TRAF6, RIP1, and RIP2. Eighteen hours after transfection, the cells were lysed and cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting for the expression levels of the adapter proteins. Triad3A promoted down-regulation of TIRAP, RIP1 (Fig. 1A, left panel), and TRIF (right panel) but had no effect on the other proteins tested. Compared with the others, full-length TRIF was more difficult to express in these cells. A series of degraded products rather than the intact protein were detected in the immunoblots of the overexpressed TRIF, suggesting that the expressed TRIF may have a rapid turnover rate in these cells. Nevertheless, down-regulation of full-length TRIF by Triad3A was detectable with longer exposures of the immunoblots (Fig. 1A, right panel). We further analyzed the mRNA levels of these three Triad3A-regulated proteins by reverse transcription PCR with gene-specific primers. The results indicated that their mRNA levels were unaffected by the expression of Triad3A (Fig. 1B). Thus, similar to the regulation of TLRs, down-regulation of these adapter proteins by Triad3A was controlled at the protein level. Triad3A Interacts with TIRAP, TRIF, and RIP1—In general, an E3 ligase directly associates with its target proteins to promote their ubiquitination and proteolytic degradation (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Varshavsky A. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1073-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 2Pickart C.M. Eddins M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar, 3Ardley H.C. Robinson P.A. Essays Biochem. 2005; 41: 15-30Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the interaction between Triad3A and its substrates, we co-transfected 293 cells with an expression vector for Triad3A and excess amount of vectors for its target proteins. The transfected cells were lysed 18 h later and cell lysates were subjected to co-immunoprecipitation analyses. The results showed that the two substrates, TIRAP and RIP1, co-immunoprecipitated with Triad3A, whereas MyD88 and TIRP did not (Fig. 2A). Because TRIF was more difficult to express, we investigated the interaction between endogenous Triad3A and TRIF using THP-1 cells stably transfected with CD14 (THP-1/CD14) (27Lee J.D. Kravchenko V. Kirkland T.N. Han J. Mackman N. Moriarty A. Leturcq D. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9930-9934Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). These cells were stimulated with LPS for 10 and 30 min and then lysed. The cell lysates were subjected to co-immunoprecipitation with an antibody against TRIF and subsequently immunoblotted with anti-Triad3A antibody. The result indicated that Triad3A interacted with TRIF in both resting cells and LPS-stimulated cells (Fig. 2B). These results demonstrated a direct physical contact between Triad3A and its substrates. RIP1 Contains a TIRH Domain for Interaction with Triad3A— This observation of direct interaction between Triad3A and TIRAP, as well as TRIF, is consistent with our previous finding that Triad3A interacts with TLRs because these proteins all contain a TIR domain and some conserved motif within this domain could be responsible for the interaction. However, RIP1 does not contain a TIR domain. RIP1 contains 671 amino acid residues with an N-terminal kinase domain, a RHIM motif, and a C-terminal death domain (Fig. 3A and Refs. 21Meylan E. Burns K. Hofmann K. Blancheteau V. Martinon F. Kelliher M. Tschopp J. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 24Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1996; 4: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). The interaction between Triad3A and RIP1 suggested to us that RIP1 may have a domain with some conserved motif homologous to a TIR domain that allows for interaction with Triad3A. We performed protein sequence alignment analyses using amino acid sequences from the TIR domain of each of the MyD88 family members and RIP1. The results indicated that a C-terminal region in RIP1 comprising the RHIM motif and extending into the death domain can be aligned with the sequences of the TIR domains, suggesting that this region has significant homology with the TIR domains and thus could be the TIRH domain (Fig. 3, A and B). To investigate further the interaction between RIP1 and Triad3A, we co-transfected 293 cells with expression vector for RIP1 and increasing amounts of expression vector encoding Triad3A. After 18 h, the cells were lysed and analyzed by immunoblotting for the expression levels of RIP1. The results indicated that Triad3A promoted down-regulation of RIP1 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4). To determine whether the TIRH domain was involved in the protein interaction with Triad3A, a series of expression vectors with truncation mutants of RIP1 deleted progressively from either the N- or C-terminal were generated. Excess amount of Triad3A was co-expressed in 293 cells with these truncation mutants to determine its activity toward these mutants. Triad3A promoted down-regulation of N-terminal-deleted RIP1s, whereas the C-terminal-deleted proteins remained intact. Removal of the C-terminal region from amino acid residue 595 rendered RIP1 unresponsive to Triad3A, suggesting the importance of this C-terminal region for its interaction with Triad3A (Fig. 5A). Requirement of the C-terminal for RIP1 to bind Triad3A was further determined by co-immunoprecipitation of the truncated proteins with Triad3A from cell lysates generated from 293 cells co-transfected with excess amount of these truncated proteins and Triad3A. The results showed that the N-terminal deletion mutants were capable of binding to Triad3A, whereas the C-terminal TIRH domain-truncated mutants were not (Fig. 5B).FIGURE 5Key amino acid residues in the TIRH domain for interaction between RIP1 and Triad3A. To determine the activity of Triad3A to various RIP1 truncation and point mutants Myc-tagged truncation mutants of RIP1 (A) and Myc-tagged point mutants of RIP1 (C) were co-expressed with excess amount of FLAG-tagged Triad3A in 293 cells. The cells were subsequently lysed, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies against Myc, FLAG, or actin. To determine the interaction between Triad3A and various RIP1 truncation and point mutants excess amount of Myc-tagged truncated RIP1 (B) and excess amount of Myc-tagged point-mutated RIP1 (D) were co-expressed with FLAG-tagged Triad3A in 293 cells. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-FLAG antibody and then analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Myc antibody for the co-immunoprecipitated proteins. The expression levels of these proteins were analyzed by resolving cell lysates by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-Myc or anti-FLAG antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further investigate the amino acid residues in the TIRH domain that are essential for binding to Triad3A, residues conserved in both TIRAP and TRIF and in the C-terminal of RIP1 were identified (Fig. 3B). Point mutants of RIP1 were generated by mutagenesis of these residues into the corresponding residues in MyD88 or into alanine. These point mutants were co-expressed with Triad3A in 293 cells and analyzed by immunoblotting and co-immunoprecipitation for their interaction with Triad3A. The results showed that mutagenesis of the conserved residues Ile615, Gly623, and Leu632 rendered RIP1 unresponsive to Triad3A (Figs. 3B and 5C), and abolished its ability to bind to Triad3A (Fig. 5D), whereas mutagenesis of several other non-conserved residues in this region did not show these responses (Fig. 5, C and D). Overall, in this study we have identified a TIRH domain in the C-terminal of RIP1 downstream of the RHIM motif that is essential for the interaction of RIP1 with Triad3A. Triad3A Regulates TNF-α-induced NF-κB Activation through a RIP1 Degradation-independent Mechanism—RIP1 is required for TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation, and ZIN/Tri-ad3, an alternatively spliced form of Triad3A, has been shown to interact with RIP1 and inhibit TNF-α activation (23Chen D. Li X. Zhai Z. Shu H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15985-15991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Here we have shown that Triad3A interacts and promotes down-regulation of RIP1. Taken together, these data suggest that Triad3A may play a role in regulation of TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation. To investigate this function of Triad3A, we first developed siRNAs, targeting different positions of the TriadA gene, to reduce the expression of endogenous Triad3A in 293 cells. The efficiency of these siRNAs was determined by immunoblotting with specific antibody for the expression of Triad3A (Fig. 6A, lower panel). These siRNA-treated cells were subsequently transfected with an NF-κB-driven luciferase reporter gene and stimulated with TNF-α. Luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that reduction of Triad3A expression rendered cells hyperresponsive to TNF-α (Fig. 6A, upper panel). To further confirm that Triad3A acted as a negative regulator, 293 cells were co-transfected with an NF-κB luciferase reporter gene and increasing amounts of expression vector for Triad3A and subsequently stimulated with TNF-α. These experiments showed that Triad3A blocked TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, at lower concentrations, expression of Triad3A itself somewhat activated NF-κB (Fig. 6B). The molecular mechanism for this activation is unclear but may be due to the interactions between Triad3A and its substrates, which, in turn, lead to NF-κB activation. We further investigated the molecular mechanisms by which Triad3A controls TNF-α activation. To determine whether down-regulation of RIP1 expression was responsible for the negative regulation by Triad3A on TNF-α activation, 293 cells were treated with TNF-α for different periods of time and analyzed for the protein levels of RIP1 by immunoblotting with specific antibody (Fig. 6C). The results showed that the level of endogenous RIP1 was unaffected following TNF-α stimulation, suggesting that the negative regulatory function of Triad3A on TNF-α activation could be independent of its proteolytic degradation activity toward RIP1. Because the death domain in RIP1 is required for homotypic interactions with upstream signaling molecules for its recruitment to the TNF-R1 complex (24Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.B. Baichwal V.

Complex formation between ERK3 and MK5 results in phosphorylation and activation of MK5, concomitant stabilization of ERK3, and the nuclear exclusion of both proteins. However, ablation of ERK3 in HeLa cells using small interfering RNA or in fibroblasts derived from ERK3 null mice reduces the activity of endogenous MK5 by only 50%, suggesting additional mechanisms of MK5 regulation. Here we identify the ERK3-related kinase ERK4 as a bona fide interaction partner of MK5. Binding of ERK4 to MK5 is accompanied by phosphorylation and activation of MK5. Furthermore, complex formation also results in the relocalization of MK5 from nucleus to cytoplasm. However unlike ERK3, ERK4 is a stable protein, and its half-life is not modified by the presence or absence of MK5. Finally, although knock-down of ERK4 protein in HeLa cells reduces endogenous MK5 activity by ∼50%, a combination of small interfering RNAs targeting both ERK4 and ERK3 causes a further reduction in the MK5 activity by more than 80%. We conclude that MK5 activation is dependent on both ERK3 and ERK4 in these cells and that these atypical MAPKs are both physiological regulators of MK5 activity.

The subfamily of mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinases (MKs) 3The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MK, MAPK-activated protein kinase; PRAK, p38-regulated and -activated protein kinase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; wt, wild type; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; MKK, MAPK kinase.3The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MK, MAPK-activated protein kinase; PRAK, p38-regulated and -activated protein kinase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; wt, wild type; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; MKK, MAPK kinase. comprises three serine/threonine kinases: MK2, MK3, and MK5. These enzymes lie downstream of the MAPK signaling cascades and couple these pathways to key effectors, which mediate cell type-specific responses. These include cytokine biosynthesis, reorganization of the cytoskeleton, cell motility, cell cycle control, and chromatin remodeling (1Winzen R. Kracht M. Ritter B. Wilhelm A. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B.

Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5178-5187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Biochemical and genetic studies have revealed that MK2 is the major target of the stress activated MAPKs p38α and p38β. MK2-deficient mice have an impaired inflammatory response, which manifests as an increased resistance to endotoxic shock (6Kotlyarov A. Neininger A. Schubert C. Eckert R. Birchmeier C. Volk H.D. Gaestel M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). Underlying this resistance is a failure to regulate the stability and translation of a variety of cytokine mRNAs including those encoding tumor necrosis factor and interleukins 6 and 8. Another major target of MK2 is the small heat shock protein Hsp27 (7Stokoe D. Engel K. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Gaestel M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Hsp27 by MK2 modifies its ability to act as a chaperone, and this latter activity may be involved in stabilizing actin filaments and the regulation of cytoskeletal architecture (2Ehrnsperger M. Graber S. Gaestel M. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Although MK3 is most closely related to MK2 and also lies downstream of the p38 MAPK pathway, its biological functions are still unclear. MK3 may mediate the residual p38-dependent cytokine synthesis and Hsp27 phosphorylation observed in MK2-deficient animals (8Kotlyarov A. Yannoni Y. Fritz S. Laass K. Telliez J.B. Pitman D. Lin L.L. Gaestel M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4827-4835Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). MK3 has also been reported to interact with human polyhomeotic protein 2 and can phosphorylate this protein in vitro (5Voncken J.W. Niessen H. Neufeld B. Rennefahrt U. Dahlmans V. Kubben N. Holzer B. Ludwig S. Rapp U.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5178-5187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Human polyhomeotic protein 2 is a component of polycomb repressive complex 1 and is involved in the maintenance of chromatin structure associated with the stable silencing of certain genes (9Levine S.S. King I.F. Kingston R.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 478-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). MK5, the final member of this family, was originally identified as a p38-regulated and -activated protein kinase (PRAK) (10New L. Jiang Y. Zhao M. Liu K. Zhu W. Flood L.J. Kato Y. Parry G.C. Han J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3372-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 11Ni H. Wang X.S. Diener K. Yao Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 492-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Furthermore, like MK2, both the activity and subcellular distribution of MK5 could be regulated by ectopic expression of p38 MAPK (12New L. Jiang Y. Han J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2603-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 13Seternes O.M. Johansen B. Hegge B. Johannessen M. Keyse S.M. Moens U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6931-6945Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, endogenous MK5 activity is not regulated by stimuli that activate the p38 MAPK pathway, nor can any interaction between endogenous MK5 and p38 be detected (14Shi Y. Kotlyarov A. Laabeta K. Gruber A.D. Butt E. Marcus K. Meyer H.E. Friedrich A. Volk H.D. Gaestel M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7732-7741Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Furthermore, p38 protein levels are unchanged in mice deficient in MK5, indicating that unlike MK2, which acts to stabilize endogenous p38 protein, MK5 does not perform a role as a p38 chaperone in vivo (8Kotlyarov A. Yannoni Y. Fritz S. Laass K. Telliez J.B. Pitman D. Lin L.L. Gaestel M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4827-4835Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 14Shi Y. Kotlyarov A. Laabeta K. Gruber A.D. Butt E. Marcus K. Meyer H.E. Friedrich A. Volk H.D. Gaestel M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7732-7741Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). A major breakthrough in understanding how MK5 activity might be regulated came with the finding that the atypical MAPK ERK3 is a physiological binding partner for MK5 (15Schumacher S. Laass K. Kant S. Shi Y. Visel A. Gruber A.D. Kotlyarov A. Gaestel M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4770-4779Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 16Seternes O.M. Mikalsen T. Johansen B. Michaelsen E. Armstrong C.G. Morrice N.A. Turgeon B. Meloche S. Moens U. Keyse S.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4780-4791Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Complex formation between ERK3 and MK5 is accompanied by both phosphorylation and activation of MK5 and experiments using siRNA to deplete endogenous ERK3 and in mouse embryo fibroblasts derived from ERK3 null mice demonstrated that MK5 activity is regulated by ERK3 in vivo (16Seternes O.M. Mikalsen T. Johansen B. Michaelsen E. Armstrong C.G. Morrice N.A. Turgeon B. Meloche S. Moens U. Keyse S.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4780-4791Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Finally, experiments performed in mouse embryo fibroblasts derived from MK5-deficient mice and in cells following siRNA-mediated knock-down of MK5 clearly demonstrated that this protein acts as a chaperone to stabilize the endogenous ERK3 kinase (15Schumacher S. Laass K. Kant S. Shi Y. Visel A. Gruber A.D. Kotlyarov A. Gaestel M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4770-4779Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 16Seternes O.M. Mikalsen T. Johansen B. Michaelsen E. Armstrong C.G. Morrice N.A. Turgeon B. Meloche S. Moens U. Keyse S.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4780-4791Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Despite the proven role for ERK3 in regulating MK5, the loss of ERK3 does not completely ablate MK5 activity, reducing it only by ∼50% (16Seternes O.M. Mikalsen T. Johansen B. Michaelsen E. Armstrong C.G. Morrice N.A. Turgeon B. Meloche S. Moens U. Keyse S.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4780-4791Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This suggests the existence of additional regulators of MK5. Possible candidates include p38 MAPK and also the ERK3-related kinase ERK4/p63 MAPK, which is encoded by the gene designated MAPK4 (17Gonzalez F.A. Raden D.L. Rigby M.R. Davis R.J. FEBS Lett. 1992; 304: 170-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, preliminary experiments indicated that although a truncated form of ERK4 might act as a binding partner for MK5, unlike ERK3 it was unable to mediate MK5 activation (15Schumacher S. Laass K. Kant S. Shi Y. Visel A. Gruber A.D. Kotlyarov A. Gaestel M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4770-4779Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Here we have studied ERK4 in greater detail and report that full-length ERK4 is indeed a physiological binding partner for MK5 and that binding results in the relocalization of MK5 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Furthermore, complex formation also results in both the phosphorylation and activation of MK5. Finally, we demonstrate that although siRNA-mediated knock-down of ERK4 protein in HeLa cells reduces endogenous MK5 activity by ∼50%, a combination of siRNAs targeting both ERK4 and ERK3 causes a further loss of MK5 activity by more than 80%. We conclude that MK5 activation is dependent on both ERK3 and ERK4 in these cells and that these atypical MAPKs are both physiological regulators of MK5 activity.

Detection and quantification were performed using IRDye 800CW conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H&L) or IRDye 800CW conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H&L) (1:5000; Rockland Inc.), Alexa Fluor 680 conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L), Alexa Fluor 680 conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L), or Alexa Fluor 680 conjugated donkey anti-sheep IgG (H+L) (1:5000; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) and the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor Biosciences) or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-sheep antibody (1:2000) (Upstate) and the chemiluminiscent substrate Luminol (Santa Cruz) by exposure to Kodak film (Eastman Kodak Company, Rochester, NY). The molecular weights were estimated using the MagicMark western protein standard (Invitrogen). Cellular Fractionation—To determine the subcellular distribution of endogenous ERK4 in HeLa cells nuclear/cytoplasmic fractionation was carried out as described by McMahon et al. (22McMahon M. Itoh K. Yamamoto M. Hayes J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21592-21600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). The fractions were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using antibodies against MEK1 (1:1000; BD Bioscience) and Upstream Binding Factor (1:5000). The presence of ERK4 in these fractions was detected by immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting using a polyclonal anti-ERK4 antibody (1:1000). Expression of GST Fusion Proteins in Escherichia coli—GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli (BL21) and purified as previously described (16Seternes O.M. Mikalsen T. Johansen B. Michaelsen E. Armstrong C.G. Morrice N.A. Turgeon B. Meloche S. Moens U. Keyse S.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4780-4791Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining were used to analyze both the expression and yield of the fusion proteins. GST Pull-down Assays—Lysates were made from HeLa cells transfected with Myc-tagged ERK4 wt, ERK4 1-330, or ERK4 1-340. Recombinant ERK4 was precleared prior to the pulldown using 30 μl of glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences AB) (50% slurry equilibrated in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 0.27 m sucrose) for 1 h at 4°C. Direct interaction between MK5 and ERK4 was detected by mixing the above HeLa cell lysates or 1 μg of recombinant ERK4 with 3 μg of purified GST-MK5, GST-MK5 1-423, or GST in 300 μl of the above buffer for 2 h at 4°C. After the addition of 30 μl of glutathione-Sepharose (50% slurry equilibrated in the above buffer), the samples were incubated for an additional hour. The beads were washed five times with the above buffer and 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and then resuspended in 40 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer. GST-MK5 and co-precipitated ERK4 was detected by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using a polyclonal GST antibody (1:500; Z-5; Santa-Cruz Biotechnology) and a polyclonal sheep anti-ERK4 antibody (1:1000) or a monoclonal mouse anti-Myc antibody (1:200; 9E10; Cancer Research UK). Coimmunoprecipitation of Endogenous ERK3 and ERK4 with Endogenous MK5—HeLa cells were transfected with 20 nm of siRNA for either ERK3, ERK4, or MK5 and a scrambled siRNA (Ambion catalog number 4611) was used as a negative control. After 48 h the cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.27m sucrose, and Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (one tablet/50 ml; Roche Applied Science). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min at 15,000 × g. A polyclonal sheep anti-PRAK antibody, and nonspecific sheep IgG was immobilized by cross-linking to aldehyde-activated gel beads (AminoLink Plus Coupling Gel) using the Seize primary immunoprecipitation kit (45335; Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 3.5 mg of clarified lysate were incubated with 20 μl of either cross-coupled anti-MK5 antibody or sheep IgG for 3 h at 4°C. The beads were washed extensively using CytoSignal spin filters (CytoSignal, Irvine, CA) and a buffer containing 25 mm Tris and 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.2. The proteins were eluted from the beads by the addition of 45 μl of 1× SDS sample buffer. The samples were subjected to electrophoresis and then immunoblotted for ERK3, ERK4, and MK5 using a monoclonal anti-ERK3 antibody (1:1000; Zymed Laboratories Inc.), a sheep polyclonal anti-ERK4 antibody (1:1000), and a polyclonal sheep anti-PRAK antibody (1:1000), respectively. Detection of Endogenous ERK4—A polyclonal sheep antiERK4 antibody was immobilized by cross-linking to aldehyde-activated gel beads (AminoLink Plus coupling gel) using the Seize primary immunoprecipitation kit (45335; Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 3 mg of clarified lysate were incubated with 10 μl of cross-coupled anti-ERK4 antibody for 3 h at 4°C. The beads were washed extensively using CytoSignal spin filters (CytoSignal, Irvine, CA) and a buffer containing 25 mm Tris and 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.2. The proteins were eluted from the beads by the addition of 40 μl of 1× SDS sample buffer. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, and ERK4 was detected by immunoblotting using the sheep polyclonal ERK4 antibody (1:1000). Kinase Assays—GFP-tagged MK5 was immunoprecipitated from HeLa cells using 1 μl of the polyclonal anti-GFP antibody ab290 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), and the kinase activity of MK5 was measured as previously described (13Seternes O.M. Johansen B. Hegge B. Johannessen M. Keyse S.M. Moens U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6931-6945Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To measure the endogenous MK5 kinase activity, MK5 was immunoprecipitated using a cross-linked polyclonal rabbit PRAK antiserum (H-180) from HeLa cells transfected with 20 nm of either ERK3 siRNA, ERK4 siRNA, or control siRNA as described above. The kinase activity was assayed as described previously (13Seternes O.M. Johansen B. Hegge B. Johannessen M. Keyse S.M. Moens U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6931-6945Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Activity is expressed as the number of cpm incorporated. The experiments were performed three times, and the results are presented as the mean values with associated errors. Where appropriate, the statistical significance of differences in activities under particular experimental conditions was evaluated using Student's t test. Endogenous MK5 and ERK3 from whole cell extracts and immunoprecipitated ERK4 were verified by Western blotting using a monoclonal mouse anti-PRAK antibody (1:500; A 7; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), a rabbit anti-ERK3 antibody (1:1000; 4067; Cell Signaling Technology), and a polyclonal sheep anti-ERK4 (1:1000) respectively. Cell Staining and Microscopy—Determination of the subcellular localization of GFP fusion proteins, Myc-tagged ERK3, and ERK4 and the visualization of cell nuclei was performed as described previously (16Seternes O.M. Mikalsen T. Johansen B. Michaelsen E. Armstrong C.G. Morrice N.A. Turgeon B. Meloche S. Moens U. Keyse S.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4780-4791Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Images were collected using a Zeiss LSM510 confocal laser-scanning microscope and processed using Adobe Photoshop. For cell counting experiments several fields of cells from each transfection or co-transfection were examined using a Leica Leitz DMIRB inverted microscope (Leica Microsystems), and at least 100 cells were scored for the subcellular localization of the protein(s) of interest. The MAPK4/ERK4 Gene Encodes a Protein of 587 Amino Acids—ERK4 was first isolated as one of four related human sequences with homology to MAPK and designated p63 MAPK (17Gonzalez F.A. Raden D.L. Rigby M.R. Davis R.J. FEBS Lett. 1992; 304: 170-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The published p63 MAPK cDNA encodes a protein of 557 amino acid residues (GI:4506089; Fig. 1). However, we obtained an IMAGE clone (accession number AI245528, similar to human p63 MAPK), and DNA sequencing revealed that this cDNA contains five single base insertions when compared with the original p63 MAPK sequence. These changes result in the substitution of four amino acids (residues 384-388; Fig. 1A) and also in a frameshift within the C terminus of the ERK4 protein. This alters the amino acid sequence from residue 502 and extends the open reading frame from 557 to 587 amino acids (Fig. 1A). The latter sequence is in complete agreement with that predicted by the human genome and is also homologous to a full-length murine MAPK4 cDNA (accession number BC062911), indicating that this represents the correct ERK4/MAPK4 protein sequence. ERK4 is most closely related to the atypical MAPK ERK3 with 73% amino acid sequence identity within the kinase domain (17Gonzalez F.A. Raden D.L. Rigby M.R. Davis R.J. FEBS Lett. 1992; 304: 170-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In addition, both proteins contain a single phosphoacceptor site (SEG) within the activation loop and the amino acid sequence SPR instead of APE within kinase subdomain VIII (Fig. 1B) (23Turgeon B. Lang B.F. Meloche S. Genomics. 2002; 80: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). ERK4 Is a Stable Protein That Is Localized Exclusively in the Cytosol—ERK3 was recently characterized as an unstable protein, which is localized in both the nucleus and cytoplasm when expressed in mammalian cells (24Coulombe P. Rodier G. Pelletier S. Pellerin J. Meloche S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4542-4558Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 25Julien C. Coulombe P. Meloche S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42615-42624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To study the localization of full-length ERK4, this was expressed as a Myc epitope-tagged protein in HeLa cells, and its localization was compared with that of ERK3 (Fig. 2). In agreement with previous studies, we observe that ERK3 protein is found in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. In contrast, ERK4 is localized only in the cytoplasm. We next expressed ERK4 and ERK3 in the presence of cycloheximide and followed the rate of degradation of the Myc epitope-tagged proteins by Western blotting (Fig. 2B). In agreement with previous studies (24Coulombe P. Rodier G. Pelletier S. Pellerin J. Meloche S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4542-4558Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), ERK3 was a relatively unstable protein showing significant turnover within the first 3 h after cycloheximide addition. In contrast, levels of ERK4 were completely unchanged over the time course of the"
https://openalex.org/W2047676513,"Gonadotropin-regulated testicular RNA helicase (GRTH/Ddx25), a member of the DEAD-box protein family, is essential for completion of spermatogenesis. GRTH is present in the cytoplasm and nucleus of meiotic spermatocytes and round spermatids and functions as a component of mRNP particles, implicating its post-transcriptional regulatory roles in germ cells. In this study, GRTH antibodies specific to N- or C-terminal sequences showed differential subcellular expression of GRTH 56- and 61-kDa species in nucleus and cytoplasm, respectively, of rodent testis and transfected COS1 cells. The 56-kDa nuclear species interacted with CRM1 and participated in mRNA transport. The phosphorylated cytoplasmic 61-kDa species was associated with polyribosomes. Confocal studies on COS-1 cells showed that GRTH-GFP was retained in the nucleus by treatment with a RNA polymerase inhibitor or the nuclear protein export inhibitor. This indicated that GRTH is a shuttling protein associated with RNA export. The N-terminal leucine-rich region (61-74 amino acids) was identified as the nuclear export signal that participated in CRM1-dependent nuclear export pathway. Deletion analysis identified a 14-amino acid GRTH sequence (100-114 amino acids) as a nuclear localization signal. GRTH selectively regulated the translation of specific genes including histone 4 and HMG2 in germ cells. In addition, GRTH participated in the nuclear export of RNA messages (PGK2, tACE, and TP2) in a gene-specific manner. These studies strongly indicate that the mammalian GRTH/Ddx25 gene is a multifunctional RNA helicase that is an essential regulator of sperm maturation.

Modulation of RNA structure by members of the DEAD-box family of RNA helicases is a crucial step in many fundamental biological processes (1Schmid S.R. Linder P. Mol.

This class of proteins participates in several aspects of RNA metabolism and translational events, including pre-mRNA splicing, ribosome biogenesis, nucleo-cytoplasmic transport, translation, and RNA decay that ultimately regulate organelle gene expression for specific biological functions. RNA helicases contain at least eight conserved motifs, some of which have recognized functions such as ATP hydrolysis, RNA binding, and RNA unwinding that modulate RNA activity, while their N- or C-terminal extensions may confer substrate specificity.Gene expression in germ cells requires temporal uncoupling of transcription and translation (8Steger K.

Two-thirds of the mRNAs in the adult mammalian testis are associated with specific proteins to form messenger ribonuclear protein (mRNP) 3The abbreviations used are: mRNP, messenger ribonuclear protein; GRTH, GRTH/Ddx25, gonadotropin-regulated testicular RNA helicase; tACE, testicular angiotensin-converting enzyme; H4, histone 4; PGK1/2, phosphoglycerate kinase 2; TP2, transition protein 2; HMG2, high mobility group protein-2; Ab, antibody; NLS, nuclear localization signal; NES, nuclear export signal; PL10, Ddx10; CRM1, chromosome region maintenance-1 protein; PKA, cAMP-dependent kinase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; aa, amino acid; Acr, proacrosine; RS, round spermatids; LMB, Leptomycin B; CIP, calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase; PKI, protein kinase inhibitor. 3The abbreviations used are: mRNP, messenger ribonuclear protein; GRTH, GRTH/Ddx25, gonadotropin-regulated testicular RNA helicase; tACE, testicular angiotensin-converting enzyme; H4, histone 4; PGK1/2, phosphoglycerate kinase 2; TP2, transition protein 2; HMG2, high mobility group protein-2; Ab, antibody; NLS, nuclear localization signal; NES, nuclear export signal; PL10, Ddx10; CRM1, chromosome region maintenance-1 protein; PKA, cAMP-dependent kinase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; aa, amino acid; Acr, proacrosine; RS, round spermatids; LMB, Leptomycin B; CIP, calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase; PKI, protein kinase inhibitor. particles, and are stored in the cytoplasm of spermatids for translation at specific times required for progression and completion of spermatogenesis. We have recently discovered and characterized a hormone-dependent testis-specific RNA helicase in Leydig and germinal cells (meiotic spermatocytes and spermatids) of rat, mouse, and human, termed gonadotropin-regulated testicular helicase (GRTH/Ddx25) (10Tang P.Z. Tsai-Morris C.H. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37932-37940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This enzyme is present in the nucleus and cytoplasm of germ cells, and selectively binds mRNA species as an integral component of messenger RNP particles with storage in chromatoid bodies located in the cytoplasm of spermatids (11Tsai-Morris C.H. Sheng Y. Lee E. Lei K.J. Dufau M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6373-6378Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). GRTH-targeted null male mice were sterile because of spermatid arrest at step 8 of spermatogenesis, with marked size diminution of chromatoid bodies and failure to elongate. Because transcription of messages in spermatids steps 1-8 of these mice was not altered, we proposed that the function of GRTH is post-transcriptional.GRTH protein is cell-specific and is hormonally regulated in the testis (12Sheng Y. Tsai-Morris C.H. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27796-27803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Three species of GRTH protein, resulting from alternative utilization of translation initiation codons, were observed in the rat testis. Germ cells (round spermatid and spermatocyte) primarily utilized the 1st ATG codon (+1) and contained major proteins of 61/56 kDa, whereas interstitial Leydig cells preferentially utilized the 2nd ATG codon (+343) with expression of 48/43 kDa species. In round spermatids, hCG caused a significant decrease of 61 kDa species and an induction of 48/43 kDa. This is prevented by the androgen receptor antagonist, Flutamide, suggesting a role of androgen in utilization of the second ATG. The germ cell-specific 61/56 kDa species is essential for spermatogenesis.To further define the molecular trajectory of GRTH as an RNA-binding protein, and its translational function during sperm development, we examined the shuttling properties and structural requirements for GRTH protein/mRNA transport between nucleus and cytoplasm of transfected cells and testicular germ cells. Our findings indicate that GRTH has multiple regulatory roles at the RNA export and translational levels during germ cell development.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimals—Adult male rats (SD, Charles River Laboratories Inc, Wilmington. MA) and GRTH wild type and GRTH-/- male mice were housed in temperature and light-controlled conditions. All animal studies were approved by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Animal and Care and Use Committee. Animals were killed by asphyxiation with CO2 and decapitated. Testes were removed and decapsulated for protein and RNA extraction. Germinal cells from seminiferous tubules were prepared and further purified for protein extraction.Testicular Cells Preparation—Testicular germ cells were prepared by collagenase/trypsin dispersion and purified by centrifugal elutriation (13Bucci L.R. Brock W.A. Johnson T.S. Meistrich M.L. Biol. Reprod. 1986; 34: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).DNA Constructs—Full-length of GRTH-pBK-CMV and GRTH-EGFP fusion constructs were prepared as previously described (12Sheng Y. Tsai-Morris C.H. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27796-27803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Fusion constructs of EGFP with N-terminal fragments of GRTH (residues 1-59 aa, 1-80 aa, 1-100 aa, and 1-114 aa) were generated by PCR using GRTH cDNA as template. These were subsequently subcloned at EcoRI/SmaI sites of pEGFP-C1 vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis using EGFP-GRTH (1-114 aa) as template was performed using QuikChange XL Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All the constructs were verified by DNA sequencing.Cell Transfection and Confocal Analysis—In a 6-well plate, constructs (2 μg) were transfected into COS-1 cells (80% confluent) by Lipofectamine (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Cells were harvested for either fractionation of individual cellular compartment or directly used for Western blot analyses (see below). In confocal microscopy studies, COS-1 cells were transfected with the full-length of GRTH-EGFP fusion construct for 24 h and further treated for 3 h with 90 μm DRB (5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosyl-benzimi-dazole, RNA polymerase inhibitor) (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) or 100 nm Leptomycin B (LMB) (Calbiochem), nuclear protein export inhibitor. Cells were fixed, counterstained by Hoechst 33342, and observed under a Bio-Rad laser confocal microscope system (MRC-1024).Cellular Compartment Fractionation—Nuclei and cytoplasm extracts of COS-1 cells, germinal cells, and testis tissue were prepared using nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents kit (Pierce Biotechnology) in the presence of a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Sciences) and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Pierce Biotechnology). Cytoplasmic fractionation was performed using sucrose gradient sedimentation. Briefly, rat or mouse testes were homogenized in hypotonic buffer A (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCL, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing protease inhibitors and cycloheximide (100 μg/ml) using a Dounce homogenizer. Lysates were centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min to separate nuclear from cytoplasmic fraction. Sucrose gradients (7-47%) in buffer A or buffer A-modified were prepared using a gradient mixer (Biocomp, Fredericton, N.B. Canada). For the EDTA condition employed, MgCl2 in buffer A was replaced by 30 mm EDTA (buffer A-modified) and used for the preparation of the cytoplasmic fraction and sucrose gradients. The cytoplasmic fraction (20 A260) was applied onto the linear sucrose gradient (7-47%) and subsequently centrifuged at 260,000 × g (Beckman SW41 rotor) for 150 min. Fifteen 800-μl fractions were collected using an Isco density gradient fractionator (Teledyne Isco, Inc, Lincoln, NE) equipped with a 5-mm pathlength density gradient flow cell and a UA-6 UV/vis detector with built-in chart recorder. Protein was precipitated by addition of 1 ml of dry ice-cold ethyl alcohol to each fraction, and these were kept frozen overnight at -20 °C. Pellets obtained after centrifugation in a microcentrifuge (Eppendorf 5417R) at 20,817 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, were washed with 1 ml of ethyl alcohol and centrifuged for 5 min at 4 °C. Pellets dried in a speed vac concentrator were resuspended in 40 μl of 2× SDS protein gel solution and used for Western analysis.Analysis of Phosphomodification—Testicular homogenates were applied to a phosphoprotein affinity column (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA) for enrichment of the phosphoprotein pool. The presence of GRTH in the phosphoprotein extract (5 μg) was revealed by Western blot analysis utilizing a GRTH-specific antibody (see next section) and compared with original testicular homogenates. Calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIP, 20 and 40 units, Promega, Madison, WI) was added to testicular homogenates (120 μg/100 μl) in the buffer containing 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitor, and incubated for 8 h at 37°C.30 μg of protein (one-fourth of total reaction volume) was subsequently evaluated by Western analysis. COS-1 cells transfected with full-length GRTH cDNA were treated with protein kinase inhibitors (Calbiochem) including H-7, 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methyl-piperazine (5, 15 μm); H-8, N-[2-(methyl-amino)-ethyl]-5-isoquinoline sulfonamide (5, 20 μm); H-89, N-[2-(p-bromocinnamylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinoline-sulfonamide, 2HCl (10 μm) for 24 h, and cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis. cAMP (8-bromo-cAMP) (Sigma Aldrich) was added to COS-1 cells transfected with GRTH and incubated for 24 h. To evaluate the specificity of the effect of protein kinase A (PKA) on GRTH phosphorylation, COS-1 cells were cotransfected with plasmids expressing GRTH alone or with the PKA catalytic subunit α (14Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6870-6873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and/or the rabbit muscle protein kinase inhibitor (PKI) (15Day R.N. Walder J.A. Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 431-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (2 μg each) (kindly provided by Dr. R. Maurer, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, OR). Cell extracts were assessed by Western blots utilizing GRTH antibody. To determine the phosphorylation status of the GRTH protein in whole testis and specific cellular compartments, total testicular lysate, purified nuclei, and cytoplasm from rat and mouse testis were first immunoprecipitated by GRTH antibody and subsequently subjected to Western blot analysis for evaluation of phosphor-amino acids with specific phosphoantibodies (see below).Western Blot Analysis—Protein extracts separated on a 4-20% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane were assessed using the specific GRTH antibodies indicated in each study. Two rabbit anti-GRTH polyclonal antibodies were raised against either N-terminal (aa 12-23) or C-terminal (aa 466-479) peptides. Both antibodies were purified by peptide affinity chromatography utilizing GRTH peptides coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). Anti-phosphoserine (Sigma), and anti-phosphotyrosine and -threonine monoclonal antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology Inc.) were used to evaluate the phosphorylation of the GRTH protein. Anti-ribosomal protein S6, anti-Smac, and anti-HDAC1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) were used for verification of purified polyribosomal, cytoplasmic, and nuclear preparations, respectively. Anti-histone 4 (H4, Cell Signaling Technology Inc.), anti-phosphoglycerate kinase 2 (PGK1/2), high mobility group protein-2 (HMG2), testicular specific angiotensin-converting enzyme (tACE), p68 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), Proacrosin (Acr, Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO), β-tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), and β-actin (Sigma) were used in the designated experiments. Immunosignals were detected by a super-signal chemiluminescence system (Pierce Biotechnology). Specific PL10 rabbit peptide polyclonal antibody raised to amino acids 28-38 of mouse PL10 (16Leroy P. Alzari P. Sassoon D. Wolgemuth D. Fellous M. Cell. 1989; 57: 549-559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) was purified by protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies were used at dilution 1:500 to 1:1000, and the appropriate 2nd antibody was employed (goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase at 1:10,000; donkey anti-goat IgG horseradish peroxidase 1:5000). Immunosignals were detected by the super-signal chemiluminescence system (Pierce).Northern Analysis—Total RNA from either whole cell or cytoplasmic fractions of adult mouse testis (GRTH+/+ and GRTH-/-) (11Tsai-Morris C.H.

A. 2004; 101: 6373-6378Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) was isolated using TRIzol LS reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). 5-μg RNA samples were resolved on 1% agarose gel and transferred to nylon membranes. Mouse full-length cDNAs including H4 (GenBank™ accession no. NM_175652), HMG2 (GenBank™ X67668), PGK2 (GenBank™ NM_031190), Acr (GenBank™ NM_013455), tACE (GenBank™ NM_009598), transition protein 2 (TP2, GenBank™ NM_013694), and PL10 (J04847) were subcloned by reverse transcription (RT) using oligo(dT) and PCR by gene-specific primer pairs and sequenced. Full-length cDNAs of individual genes were used as probes for hybridization, except for tACE, where a specific exon 1 sequence was used. Signals were quantified by PhosphorImager analysis and normalized using β-actin as the probe. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. of at least three experiments.Immunoprecipitation Analysis—Immunoprecipitation of the GRTH-associated protein complexes was performed using the ProFound Co-Immuno-precipitation kit (Pierce) by either affinity-purified anti-GRTH antiserum (C terminus) or CRM1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). In this study, 100 μg of primary antibodies or rabbit IgG were first immobilized to the antibody-coupling gel followed by incubation with either 300 μg of rat testicular nuclear or cytoplasmic extracts. The precipitated protein complex was recovered by brief centrifugation, followed by three sequential washes. The complex was eluted for Western blot analysis.RESULTSSubcellular Localization and Phosphomodification of GRTH in Rodent Testis—The subcellular distribution of endogenous GRTH protein species from mouse testis and overexpressed full-length GRTH cDNA in COS-1 cells was assessed by Western analysis using C- and N-terminal GRTH peptide antibodies (Fig. 1A, left, top and bottom panels). Both antibodies revealed two major GRTH protein species (61 and 56 kDa) that were differentially distributed in the cellular compartments of mouse testis. The 61-kDa protein species was primarily present in the cytoplasm whereas the 56-kDa species was found predominantly in the nucleus. Both of these protein species were absent in GRTH-null mice. Overexpressed GRTH protein in COS-1 cells revealed a similar pattern of subcellular distribution as the endogenous testicular GRTH protein. (Fig. 1A, right) and similar results were observed in the rat (not shown). Because both GRTH antibodies showed comparable results, the antibody to the C-terminal peptide was used in the subsequent studies. Only the testicular 61-kDa but not 56-kDa protein species or β-actin was enriched by phosphoprotein affinity column fractionation, suggesting that the 61-kDa protein was a phosphoprotein (Fig. 1B, left panel). The phosphoform nature of this 61-kDa species was also indicated by its conversion to the lower molecular mass species (56 kDa) after treatment with CIP (Fig. 1B, middle panel). This was supported by the finding of a reduction of the 61-kDa species to 56-kDa in COS1 cells transfected with full-length GRTH cDNA after the treatment with protein kinase inhibitors including H7, H8, and H89 (Fig. 1B, right panel). In contrast, the 61-kDa species was enhanced by cAMP treatment of cells expressing GRTH (Fig. 1D, left panel). This protein species was significantly increased by overexpressing the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKAα), and the stimulation was prevented by coexpression of the PKI cDNA. In addition PKI inhibited the basal levels of the 61-kDa species, which presumably is generated by basal endogenous levels of cAMP present in the cells (Fig. 1D, right panel).The endogenous phosphorylation status of the GRTH protein in the rat and mouse testis was further determined by immunoprecipitation analysis. Two protein species (56 and 61 kDa) were clearly observed in the rat total testicular lysate (T) prior to immunoprecipitation analysis (Fig. 1C, right panel, lane 1). Following immunoprecipitation of the testis lysates by the GRTH antibody, only the 61-kDa species was detected in Western blots by the phosphothreonine antibody (p-Thr) (Fig. 1C, right panel, lane 3). No signal was observed when IgG was used as negative control (Fig. 1C, right panel, lane 2) or when antibodies to phosphotyrosine or -serine were used (not shown). Similar results were found in mice total testicular lysates where the GRTH protein was phosphorylated at the threonine not at the Tyr or Ser residues (Fig. 1C, left panel, lanes 2 and 4 versus lanes 6 and 8). In the mouse, in contrast to the rat because of its low abundance, the 56-kDa species (non-phosphorylated) was difficult to detect in testis homogenates but was observed in nuclei fractions. Consistent with our early results (Fig. 1, A and B), the 61-kDa Thr-phosphorylated GRTH species was present in the cytoplasm, but not in the nuclear compartment in the mouse (Fig. 1C, lane 4 versus 6, middle panel) and rat (not shown).Nuclear Localization of Overexpressed GRTH-GFP in COS-1 Cells after Treatment with LMB and RNA Polymerase Inhibitor (DRB)—To gain insights into the functional association of GRTH protein with individual cellular compartments, we initially investigated by confocal microscopy whether GRTH participates in a shuttling mechanism between nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments in COS-1 cells overexpressing GRTH-GFP fusion protein. As we previously reported in control cells, the GRTH-GFP fusion protein was present in both cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 2, left panel, top) (11Tsai-Morris C.H. Sheng Y. Lee E. Lei K.J. Dufau M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6373-6378Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In this study, we showed that GRTH-GFP in nuclei after the treatment of transfected cells with nuclear protein export inhibitor (LMB) (Fig. 2, middle panel) and RNA polymerase inhibitor (DRB) (Fig. 2, lower panel).FIGURE 2Cellular redistribution of GRTH in COS-1 cells after treatment with nuclear protein export inhibitor (LMB) and RNA polymerase II inhibitor (DRB).

Guttinger S. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 121-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). CRM1 was abundantly expressed in the rodent testis as revealed by Western analysis (Fig. 3A, top, left). Immunoprecipitation of mouse testis extracts using GRTH antibody demonstrated its association with CRM1 as shown by Western blot (Fig. 3A, top panel, right). Similarly the GRTH protein was present in the complex when the immunoprecipitation procedure was performed using CRM1 antibody followed by Western analysis with GRTH antibody of both rodent species (Fig. 3A, middle panel, lanes 1 and 2 versus 3) and CRM1 was shown to be associated with the 56-kDa nuclear species (non-phosphorylated GRTH) when compared with GRTH protein species present in the rat testicular homogenate (Fig. 3A, middle panel, lane 4) or purified fraction of nuclear (N) and cytoplasmic (C) compartment (Fig. 3A, middle panel, lanes 5 and 6). Furthermore, the CRM1 immunoprecipitation analysis of the purified cellular compartment revealed that the 56-kDa nuclear protein of both rodent species was associated with CRM1 (Fig. 3, lower right panel, rat, lane 3; left panel, mouse, lane 3) but not the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 3, lower right panel, rat, lane 2; left panel, mouse, lane 2). These results suggested that GRTH utilizes the CRM1-dependent nuclear export pathway for mRNA transport.FIGURE 3Leucine-rich sequence (aa 61-74) of GRTH functions as the putative nuclear export signal and participates in CRM1-dependent nuclear export pathway.

The 1-114-aa N-terminal sequence contains two leucine-rich stretches, one noted between 61 and 74 aa with mismatches when compared with the classical leucine-rich NES consensus (θX2-3θX2-3θXθ; θ: hydrophobic residue; X: polar aa), and the other was located between 100 and 114 aa. (Fig. 3B, below). Mutation of leucine residues at 66, 67, and 70 aa enhanced the expression of 114 aa fusion protein in the nucleus (66/67/70Δ). In contrast, mutation of leucine residues within 100-114 aa at 104, 108, and 109 aa, significantly decreased the nuclear expression of the mutant EGFP-GRTH fusion protein (104/108/109Δ) (Fig. 3B, see also Fig. 4).FIGURE 4Characterization of a nuclear localization signal of GRTH.

The GRTH-GFP fusion construct 1-114 aa and deletion constructs 1-59, 1-80, 1-100, and 1-114 aa were overepressed in COS-1 cells (Fig. 4A). The GRTH protein containing the first 114 aa (EGFP-GRTH-[1-114]) was expressed in both cytoplasm and nucleus of COS-1 cells. Fusion constructs with deletions (EGFP-GRTH-[1-59], EGFP-GRTH-[1-80], and EGFP-GRTH-[1-100]) revealed expression of their respective protein only in the cytoplasm. Mutation analysis of the 114-aa construct in the region between 101 and 114 aa showed that single or double mutation of two basic residues (Arg103 → Ala, Lys105→ Ala) in EGFP-GRTH (1-114 aa) fusion construct abolished the respective protein expression in the nucleus (Fig. 4B).Cytoplasmic GRTH Protein Is Associated with Polyribosome and Participates in Translational Regulation of Gene Expression—We also investigated the functional role of cytoplasmic GRTH as translational regulator, by examining its potential association with polyribosomes, which are required for translation of RNA messages.

https://openalex.org/W2032760765,"Type 2C protein phosphatases are encoded in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by several related genes (PTC1-5 and PTC7). To gain insight into the functions attributable to specific members of this gene family, we have investigated the transcriptional profiles of ptc1-5 mutants. Two main patterns were obtained as follows: the one generated by the ptc1 mutation and the one resulting from the lack of Ptc2-5. ptc4 and ptc5 profiles were quite similar, whereas that of ptc2 was less related to this group. Mutation of PTC1 resulted in increased expression of numerous genes that are also induced by cell wall damage, such as YKL161c, SED1, or CRH1, as well as in higher amounts of active Slt2 mitogen-activated protein kinase, indicating that lack of the phosphatase activates the cell wall integrity pathway. ptc1 cells were even more sensitive than slt2 mutants to a number of cell wall-damaging agents, and both mutations had additive effects. The sensitivity of ptc1 cells was not dependent on Hog1. Besides these phenotypes, we observed that calcineurin was hyperactivated in ptc1 cells, which were also highly sensitive to calcium ions, heavy metals, and alkaline pH, and exhibited a random haploid budding pattern. Remarkably, many of these traits are found in certain mutants with impaired vacuolar function. As ptc1 cells also display fragmented vacuoles, we hypothesized that lack of Ptc1 would primarily cause vacuolar malfunction, from which other phenotypes would derive. In agreement with this scenario, overexpression of VPS73, a gene of unknown function involved in vacuolar protein sorting, largely rescues not only vacuolar fragmentation but also sensitivity to cell wall damage, high calcium, alkaline pH, as well as other ptc1-specific phenotypes.

Ser/Thr protein phosphatases have been classically classified in four groups as follows: PP1, PP2A, PP2B, and PP2C. PP1, PP2A, and PP2B catalytic subunits are closely related in their primary sequence and define the PPP family. Type 2C phosphatases, which constitute the PPM family, are not related in sequence with PPP members, although their three-dimensional structures and catalytic mechanism appear to be very similar (1Cohen P.T. Arino J. Alexander D.R. Protein Phosphatases. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg2004: 1-20Google Scholar). Protein phosphatase 2C represents an evolutionary conserved group of proteins that, in contrast with most members of the PPP family, are monomeric enzymes that apparently lack regulatory subunits. Five type 2C phosphatase genes (PTC1-5) have been classically defined in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (2Stark M.J. Yeast. 1996; 12: 1647-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), although a sixth member (YHR076w/PTC7) was recently added to the list (3Jiang L. Whiteway M. Ramos C. Rodriguez-Medina J.R. Shen S.H. FEBS Lett. 2002; 527: 323-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A putative seventh member (YCR079w) was reported some time ago, although its phosphatase activity in vitro has not been demonstrated (4Cheng A. Ross K.E. Kaldis P. Solomon M.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2946-2957Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Although the first reports on the characterization and biological role of type 2C phosphatases in yeast appeared more than 15 years ago, our knowledge on the specific functions of each isoform and how they are regulated is still very limited. It is commonly accepted that a major role for type 2C phosphatases in yeast is to negatively regulate the osmotically activated HOG pathway by dephosphorylating and inactivating the Hog1 MAP 7The abbreviations used are: MAP, mitogen-activated protein; CFW, Calcofluor white; CWI, cell wall integrity; MAPK, MAP kinase. 7The abbreviations used are: MAP, mitogen-activated protein; CFW, Calcofluor white; CWI, cell wall integrity; MAPK, MAP kinase. kinase (5Warmka J.

Nombela C. Molina M. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Most PP2C isoforms have been associated with this function, although with slightly different roles. Thus, it has been proposed that although Ptc1 would play a role in maintaining low levels of Hog1 activity under basal conditions and adaptation to osmotic stress (5Warmka J. Hanneman J. Lee J. Amin D. Ota I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), Ptc2 and Ptc3 would be necessary to limit an excessive activation of the kinase during stress (7Young C. Mapes J. Hanneman J. Al Zarban S. Ota I. Eukaryot. Cell. 2002; 1: 1032-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Ptc1 would be recruited to the scaffold upstream Hog1 kinase, Pbs2, through its interaction with Nbp2 (10Mapes J. Ota I.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 302-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In addition to Ptc1-3, a role for Ptc4 in dephosphorylating Hog1 has been proposed recently (11Shitamukai A. Hirata D. Sonobe S. Miyakawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3651-3661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Besides its regulatory role in the HOG pathway, diverse type 2C phosphatase isoforms have been related to a variety of specific functions. Thus, Ptc1 has been involved in the regulation of tRNA splicing (12Robinson M.K. van Zyl W.H. Phizicky E.M. Broach J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3634-3645Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and in mitochondrial inheritance (13Roeder A.D. Hermann G.J. Keegan B.R. Thatcher S.A. Shaw J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 917-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Ptc2 and Ptc3 have been postulated as responsible for the dephosphorylation of cyclin-dependent kinases (4Cheng A. Ross K.E. Kaldis P. Solomon M.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2946-2957Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and to be required for checkpoint inactivation after a DNA double strand break, which would confer to these specific isoforms an important role in regulating DNA checkpoint pathways (14Leroy C. Lee S.E. Vaze M.B. Ochsenbien F. Guerois R. Haber J.E. Marsolier-Kergoat M.C. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 827-835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 15Marsolier M.C. Roussel P. Leroy C. Mann C. Genetics. 2000; 154: 1523-1532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ptc2 has been proposed to negatively regulate the unfolded protein response through dephosphorylation of the Ire1 protein kinase (16Welihinda A.A. Tirasophon W. Green S.R. Kaufman R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1967-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Overexpression of PTC2 and PTC3 (but not PTC1) is able to rescue the synthetically lethal phenotype of sit4 hal3 mutants, whereas overexpression of all three genes rescues the growth defect of an slt2/mpk1 MAP kinase mutant strain at 37 °C (17Munoz I. Simon E. Casals N. Clotet J. Arino J. Yeast. 2003; 20: 157-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the ptc1 mutation was found to be synthetically lethal with that of slt2 (18Huang K.N. Symington L.S. Genetics. 1995; 141: 1275-1285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas overexpression of PTC1-4 suppressed the lethality of a cnb1 slt2 strain (11Shitamukai A. Hirata D. Sonobe S. Miyakawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3651-3661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Recent work in our laboratory has demonstrated that mutation of PTC1 (but not that of PTC2-5) confers sensitivity to lithium cations to yeast cells (19Ruiz A. Gonzalez A. García-Salcedo R. Ramos J. Arino J. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 62: 263-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Therefore, the current evidence defines a scenario in which type 2C phosphatases control a large number of processes in yeast cells, probably through a complex interplay of functions that in some cases could be rather specific but in many other cases appear largely overlapping. The available information, however, is rather fragmentary and does not provide a comprehensive understanding of the biological role of these important enzymes. We considered that a broader and more systematic overview could be obtained by comparative analysis of the transcriptomic profiles from cells deficient in each of these phosphatases. We have observed that cells lacking Ptc1 present a distinct and very specific expression pattern, reminiscent to that of cells suffering some kind of cell wall damage. Further characterization of ptc1 mutants revealed multiple, apparently unrelated phenotypic defects, suggesting a large variety of cellular functions. However, our results allow proposing a simple model that would explain most of the functions attributed to Ptc1.

Cell cultures (5 ml) were harvested by filtration, washed once with pre-chilled water, snap-frozen, and kept at -80 °C. Total cell proteins were purified basically as described previously (20Martin H. Rodriguez-Pachon J.M. Ruiz C. Nombela C. Molina M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1511-1519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell pellets were resuspended in 150 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% SDS) containing phosphatase and kinase inhibitors (50 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablets; Roche Applied Science). One volume of acid-washed glass beads was added, and cells were broken at 4 °C by vigorous shaking in a Fast Prep cell breaker (Bio 101, Inc., Vista, CA; setting 5.5 for 25 s). After sedimentation at 16,000 × g, the cleared lysate was recovered and the protein concentration quantified by Bradford assay. Forty μg of total protein were fractionated by SDS-PAGE (using 10% polyacrylamide gels) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond C-Extra; Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were incubated for 2 h with either anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204) antibody (New England Biolabs), at 1:2000 dilution, or anti-GST-Slt2 antibody (21Martin H. Arroyo J. Sanchez M.

A 1:25,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody was used to detect the primary antibodies. ECL Advance Western blotting detection kit (Amersham Biosciences) was used to visualize the immunocomplexes.

Cells were grown to saturation on synthetic medium lacking uracil and then inoculated into YPD medium to give an A660 of 0.15. Growth was resumed until A660 of 0.8 was reached, and cells were then recovered by centrifugation, and β-galactosidase was measured as described previously (23Ruiz A. Yenush L. Arino J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 937-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). RNA Purification—For RNA purification, 30 ml of yeast cultures were grown at 28 °C in YPD medium until A660 0.6-0.8. Yeast cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed with cold water. Dried cell pellets were kept at -80 °C until RNA purification. Total RNA was extracted using the RiboPure-Yeast kit (Ambion) following the manufacturer's instructions. RNA quality was assessed by electrophoresis in denaturing 0.8% agarose gel and quantified by measuring A260 in a BioPhotometer (Eppendorf). cDNA Synthesis and DNA Microarray Experiments—Transcriptional analyses were performed using DNA microarrays containing PCR-amplified fragments from 6014 S. cerevisiae open reading frames (24Viladevall L. Serrano R. Ruiz A. Domenech G. Giraldo J. Barcelo A. Arino J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43614-43624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 25Alberola T.M. Garcia-Martinez J. Antunez O. Viladevall L. Barcelo A. Arino J. Perez-Ortin J.E. Int. Microbiol. 2004; 7: 199-206PubMed Google Scholar). Amplified DNA was resuspended in 50% dimethyl sulfoxide and arrayed onto aminosilane-coated glass slides (UltraGAPS™; Corning Glass) using a MicroGrid II spotter (BioRobotics). Fluorescent Cy3- and Cy5-labeled cDNA was prepared from 8 μg of purified total RNA by the indirect dUTP-labeling method, using the CyScribe post-labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences). DNA fragments from 6014 open reading frames were PCR-amplified from yeast genomic DNA (25Alberola T.M. Garcia-Martinez J. Antunez O. Viladevall L. Barcelo A. Arino J. Perez-Ortin J.E. Int. Microbiol. 2004; 7: 199-206PubMed Google Scholar). Pre-hybridization, hybridization, and washes were carried out as recommended by The Institute for Genomic Research with minor modifications. Briefly, prehybridizations of the DNA microarrays were carried out at 42 °C for 1 h in a solution containing 5× SSC, 0.1% SDS, 1% bovine serum albumin. For hybridization, dried Cy3- and Cy5-labeled probes were resuspended in 35 μl of hybridization solution (50% formamide, 5× SSC, 0.1% SDS) each and mixed. Five μg of salmon sperm DNA was added to the mix before denaturation for 3 min at 95 °C. DNA microarrays were hybridized in an ArrayBooster hybridization station (Sunergia Group) for 14 h at 42 °C. For each experimental condition (mutant versus wild type strain) a dye swapping was performed. The scanner ScanArray 4000 (Packard Instrument Co.) was used to obtain the Cy3 and Cy5 images with a resolution of 10 μm. The fluorescent intensity of the spots was measured and processed using the GenePix Pro 6.0 software (Molecular Devices). Spots with either a diameter smaller than 120 μm or a fluorescence intensity for Cy3 and Cy5 lower than 150 units were not considered for further analysis. A given gene was considered to be induced or repressed when the ratio ptc mutant versus wt was higher than 1.80 or lower than 0.50, respectively. Genes whose expression was considered changed in any of the tested mutants were selected for further analyses. The GEPAS server was used to preprocess the data and to establish correlations between expression patterns (26Herrero J. Al Shahrour F. Diaz-Uriarte R. Mateos A. Vaquerizas J.M. Santoyo J. Dopazo J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3461-3467Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Expression profile analysis of the selected genes was determined with EPCluster (27Brazma A. Vilo J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 480: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Other Techniques—Sensitivity of the different yeast strains to alkaline pH, high temperature, or to different compounds or cations was assayed by drop test on YPD plates as described previously (28Serrano R. Bernal D. Simon E. Arino J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19698-19704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). When needed, 1 m sorbitol was added to the medium prior to sterilization by autoclaving. Growth in liquid medium was performed in 96-well plates. Two hundred fifty-μl cultures at initial A660 of 0.01 were grown at 28 °C in YPD in the presence of the specified conditions for 12-14 h. Growth was monitored in an iEMS Reader MF (Labsystems) at 620 nm. Vacuole morphology was assessed as described previously (29Vida T.A. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 779-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). Ten ml of yeast cultures at A660 of 1.0 were harvested, washed, and resuspended in 0.5 ml of fresh YPD. The fluorescent dye FM4-64 (Molecular Probes) was added at a final concentration of 20 μm, and cells were incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. The cells were then washed, resuspended in 3 ml of YPD, and incubated for 30-60 min to allow the internalization by endocytosis and accumulation of the dye within the vacuole. Identification of the carboxypeptidase Y processed forms was achieved by immunodetection as follows. Extracts were prepared from 10 ml of yeast cultures (A660 of 1.0) in TEPI buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, plus protease inhibitors). Two hundred μl of extracts were incubated for 5 min at 95 °C. Then 800 μl of TNET buffer (30 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) were added, mixed, and then centrifuged for 10 min at 16000 × g. Supernatants were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE before detection of carboxypeptidase Y by immunoblot. Staining of bud scars for determination of budding pattern was performed in exponential cultures that were grown at either 30 or 37 °C, for 6-8 h. Cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 1 h, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and stained with 0.02 mg/ml CFW (Fluorescent Brightener F-6259; Sigma). Expression Profile Analysis of PP2C Mutant Yeast Strains—In this work we have focused on the study of Ptc1-5 phosphatases. YCR079w has not been included because the encoded protein failed to show any phosphatase activity (4Cheng A. Ross K.E. Kaldis P. Solomon M.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2946-2957Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and Ptc7 (YHR076w) was not considered because of its relatively remote similarity with other members of this family. Ptc1-5, as shown in Fig. 1A, share a common catalytic domain that has specific amino-terminal or carboxyl-terminal extensions (in Ptc5 and Ptc2/Ptc3, respectively). Amino acid sequence alignment of these proteins shows that Ptc2 and Ptc3 have the highest degree of identity, whereas Ptc5 is only distantly related (Fig. 1B). To identify novel and possibly specific functions of the members of this family, we decided to analyze the alterations provoked in the expression pattern by the absence of every single PP2C gene. To this end, we compared the expression profile of the mutant strains with that obtained from wild type cells, and we considered a given gene to be induced when its expression was at least 1.8-fold higher in a mutant strain than in the wild type strain. A gene was catalogued as repressed when its expression level decreased by at least 0.5-fold for a given mutant. A functional classification of the PTC family was obtained by clustering the different expression profiles obtained for each mutant strain. Fig. 1B shows the dendrogram generated from the DNA microarray experiments. It is remarkable that the classifications obtained by sequence analysis and by expression profiling were substantially different. For instance, the structural similarity between Ptc2 and Ptc3 did not translate in a similar transcriptional response, as the expression profile obtained from the ptc3 mutant was more related to the profile from the ptc4 and ptc5 strains than to the one from ptc2. Similarly, according to their amino acid sequence, it could be predicted that the ptc5 profile should be relatively unrelated from the rest of the ptc mutants. Lack of PTC5, however, induces a series of transcriptional modifications very similar to the ones provoked by the ptc4 deletion. Surprisingly, the expression profile of cells lacking Ptc1, a protein structurally related to Ptc2 and Ptc3, was largely different from any of the mutants studied here. In fact, when the correlation coefficient (r) was calculated for each pairwise comparison of the transcriptional profiles, the correlation between ptc1 and the rest of mutants was near zero in all cases (Table 2).TABLE 2Correlation coefficients (r) obtained after pairwise comparison of the changes in the expression patterns induced by the lack of the indicated PTC genes, using the PlotCorr Server at GEPAS (26Herrero J.

https://openalex.org/W2103600815,"The classical view postulates that neuropeptide precursors in neurons are processed into mature neuropeptides in the somatic trans-Golgi network (TGN) and in secretory vesicles during axonal transport. Here we show that prodynorphin (PDYN), precursor to dynorphin opioid peptides, is predominantly located in axon terminals and dendrites in hippocampal and striatal neurons. The molar content of unprocessed PDYN was much greater than that of dynorphin peptides in axon terminals of PDYN-containing neurons projecting to the CA3 region of the hippocampus and in the striatal projections to the ventral tegmental area. Electron microscopy showed coexistence of PDYN and dynorphins in the same axon terminals with occasional codistribution in individual dense core vesicles. Thus, the precursor protein is apparently stored at presynaptic sites. In comparison with the hippocampus and striatum, PDYN and dynorphins were more equally distributed between neuronal somata and processes in the amygdala and cerebral cortex, suggesting regional differences in the regulation of trafficking and processing of the precursor protein. Potassium-induced depolarization activated PDYN processing and secretion of opioid peptides in neuronal cultures and in a model cell line. Regulation of PDYN storage and processing at synapses by neuronal activity or extracellular stimuli may provide a local mechanism for regulation of synaptic transmission."

Light-induced structural changes throughout the SRII-HtrII interface, which spans the periplasmic region, membrane-embedded domains, and cytoplasmic domains near the membrane, have been identified by several studies. Here we demonstrate by site-specific mutagenesis and analysis of phototaxis behavior that two residues in SRII near the membrane-embedded interface (Tyr174 on helix F and Thr204 on helix G) are essential for signaling by the SRII-HtrII complex. These residues, which are the first in SRII shown to be required for phototaxis function, provide biological significance to the previous observation that the hydrogen bond between them is strengthened upon the formation of the earliest SRII photointermediate (SRIIK) only when SRII is complexed with HtrII. Here we report frequency changes of the S-H stretch of a cysteine substituted for SRII Thr204 in the signaling state intermediates of the SRII photocycle, as well as an influence of HtrII on the hydrogen bond strength, supporting a direct role of the hydrogen bond in SRII-HtrII signal relay chemistry. Our results suggest that the light signal is transmitted to HtrII from the energized interhelical hydrogen bond between Thr204 and Tyr174, which is located at both the retinal chromophore pocket and in helices F and G that form the membrane-embedded interaction surface to the signal-bearing second transmembrane helix of HtrII.

The signal relay mechanism from SRII to HtrII in the complex has become a focus of interest in part because of its importance to the general understanding of interaction between integral membrane proteins. The results from several different methods show that light-induced structural changes occur all along the SRII-HtrII interface, which includes the region on the periplasmic side of the membrane, the membrane-embedded domain, and the cytoplasmic membrane-proximal domain: (i) FTIR light-dark difference spectra of the complex in proteoliposomes show both the periplasmic and membrane-embedded hydrogen-bonded regions undergo major structural changes (14Bergo V.B.

Rothschild, and J. L.

Klare J.P. Engelhard M. Steinhoff H.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5312-5319Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar); a small (0.9 Å) displacement and rotation of this region of TM2 has also been reported in illuminated crystals of the complex (16Moukhametzianov R.

Nature. 2006; 440: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar); (iii) fluorescent probes in detergent-solubilized complex show that light-induced structural changes also occur in the cytoplasmic membrane proximal domain of the complex (11Yang C.S. Sineshchekov O. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42970-42976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Determination of which SRII-HtrII interface changes are crucial for signal relay requires functional studies to complement the structural data. Site-specific mutagenesis provides a possible method to identify residues in both proteins crucial for this process, but there are no residue mutations in SRII that have been reported to eliminate phototaxis signaling by the receptor. Here we report that Thr204 in helix G and Tyr174 in helix F are crucial for receptor signal relay to the transducer subunit and present FTIR evidence for alteration of their hydrogen bond in the signaling states of the SRII photocycle. This first clue for the importance of these two residues was the uniquely large HtrII-dependent light-induced strengthening of the hydrogen bond between them evident from its spectral downshift (110 cm-1) upon formation of the earliest photocycle intermediate (SRIIK) (17Sudo Y. Furutani Y. Shimono K. Kamo N. Kandori H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14166-14172Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The results reported here and the location of the Thr204-Tyr174 interhelical hydrogen bond between the retinal chromophore pocket and the interaction surface of SRII with HtrII (Fig. 1) argue for a critical process for signal relay occurring within their membrane-embedded contact surfaces.

Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6365-6371Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The NcoI and NsiI fragment from the pJS010 plasmid was ligated to NcoI and NsiI sites of pGEM-T vector. The 3′-end of sopII was mutated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to get a SpeI restriction site, after which the NcoI and NsiI fragments were ligated into NcoI and NsiI sites of pJS010. This plasmid encodes six histidines in the C terminus, and it was named pYS001. Plasmids of T204A, T204S, T204C, and Y174F without HtrII were constructed as previously described (17Sudo Y. Furutani Y. Shimono K. Kamo N. Kandori H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14166-14172Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 21Iwamoto M. Sudo Y. Shimono K. Araiso T. Kamo N. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 1215-1223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For the preparation of T204C-HtrII, T204A-HtrII, T204S-HtrII, and Y174F-HtrII expression plasmid, the 5′- and 3′-ends of the mutant genes were mutated by PCR to get NcoI and SpeI restriction sites, respectively. The resulting NcoI-SpeI fragment was ligated with the large fragment of NcoI/SpeI-treated pYS001 vector. The stop codon was deleted during amplification, generating a linker region between SRII and HtrII containing eleven residues (Thr-Ser-Ala-Ser-Ala-Ser-Asn-Gly-Ala-Ser-Ala; 5′-ACTAGTGCGTCGGCGTCGAACGGCGCGTCGGCG-3′). Underlining indicates the added restriction sites for SpeI. T79C and D193C mutant genes were constructed by PCR using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis method. All constructed plasmids were analyzed using an automated sequencer. Membrane Preparation—Proteins were expressed in H. salinarum Pho81Wr- cells. The preparation of membrane vesicles was performed using essentially the same method as previously described (22Olson K.D. Spudich J.L. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 2578-2585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 23Sasaki J. Spudich J.L. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 2145-2152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, membrane vesicles were prepared by sonication, and the membranes were finally pelleted by centrifugation at 45,000 rpm (Beckman, rotor type 70 Ti), for 30 min at 4 °C, resuspended in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.0, containing 4 m NaCl, and stored at 4 °C. Flash Photolysis Measurements and Phototaxis Analysis—Flash-induced absorption changes in the millisecond to seconds time domain were acquired on a digital oscilloscope (ClampX 8.2) following an Nd-YAG laser (Continuum, Surelight I; 532 nm, 6 ns, 40 mJ) in a laboratory-constructed flash photolysis system as described (24Chen X. Spudich J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42964-42969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar); 64-256 transients were collected for each measurement. The membranes were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.0, containing 4 m NaCl. All experiments were performed at 20 °C. Phototaxis responses were measured as swimming reversal frequency changes to a 100-ms 500-nm photostimulus as described (25Jung K.H. Spudich J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6557-6561Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), except a new motion analysis system with software package Celltrak 1.2 Beta (Motion Analysis Corp., Santa Clara CA) was used to analyze motility behavior. Binding Analysis and FTIR Measurements—SRII and HtrII-(1-159) proteins were prepared as described previously (26Kandori H. Shimono K. Sudo Y. Iwamoto M. Shichida Y. Kamo N. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9238-9246Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 27Sudo Y. Iwamoto M. Shimono K. Kamo N. Photochem. Photobiol. 2001; 74: 489-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A truncated HtrII protein expressed from position 1 to position 159, which has been shown to exhibit the same interaction with SRII as the full-length protein (28Hippler-Mreyen S. Klare J.P. Wegener A.A. Seidel R. Herrmann C. Schmies G. Nagel G. Bamberg E. Engelhard M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 1203-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 29Sudo Y. Yamabi M. Kato S. Hasegawa C. Iwamoto M. Shimono K. Kamo N. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 357: 1274-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), was used for measurements other than phototaxis behavior and flash photolysis. Briefly, the proteins with a hexahistidine tag at the C terminus were expressed in Escherichia coli cells, solubilized with 1.0% N-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, and purified with a nickelnitrilotriacetic acid column as described previously (26Kandori H. Shimono K. Sudo Y. Iwamoto M. Shichida Y. Kamo N. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9238-9246Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 27Sudo Y. Iwamoto M. Shimono K. Kamo N. Photochem. Photobiol. 2001; 74: 489-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Confirmation of HtrII binding to SRII was based on the inhibition of heat denaturation of SRII by HtrII (30Sudo Y. Yamabi M. Iwamoto M. Shimono K. Kamo N. Photochem. Photobiol. 2003; 78: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Purified wild-type or mutant SRII were incubated without and with HtrII protein in a 1SRII:2HtrII molar ratio in a UV-visible spectrophotometer. The temperature was maintained at 81 °C for wild-type SRII, T204C, T204A, and T204S and 70 °C for Y174F by circulating thermostated water. The residual SRII activities after incubation at high temperature were measured from the absorbance at 500 nm, near the maximum of the SRII visible band (30Sudo Y. Yamabi M. Iwamoto M. Shimono K. Kamo N. Photochem. Photobiol. 2003; 78: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). During incubation, the suspensions became turbid, presumably because of denatured protein aggregation. Therefore, before spectrum measurements the samples were centrifuged at 15,000 × g briefly for 1 min to remove the aggregate. For FTIR measurements, purified SRII and HtrII proteins were mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio and incubated for 1 h at 4°C. Two samples, SRII and the SRII-HtrII mixture, were then reconstituted into l-α-phosphatidylcholine (PC) liposomes by removal with Bio-Beads (SM22; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), where the molar ratio of added PC was 50 times that of the SRII protein (26Kandori H. Shimono K. Sudo Y. Iwamoto M. Shichida Y. Kamo N. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9238-9246Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 31Furutani Y. Sudo Y. Kamo N. Kandori H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4837-4842Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Low temperature FTIR spectroscopy was performed as described previously (32Furutani Y. Iwamoto M. Shimono K. Kamo N. Kandori H. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 3482-3489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 33Furutani Y. Iwamoto M. Shimono K. Wada A. Ito M. Kamo N. Kandori H. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5204-5212Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The samples were washed three times with a buffer at pH 7.0 (2 mm phosphate) for measurement of M intermediate spectra, or pH 5.0 (2 mm citrate, 5 mm NaCl) for measurement of O intermediate spectra. 90 μl of the sample was dried on a BaF2 window with a diameter of 18 mm. After hydration by H2O, the sample was placed in a cell that was mounted in an Oxford DN-1704 cryostat placed in the Bio-Rad FTS-60 spectrometer. All samples were hydrated with H2O. The SRIIM minus SRII difference spectra were measured at 230 K and pH 7.0 as follows. To convert SRII to SRIIM, the sample was irradiated for 2 min with >480 nm of light (VY-50; Toshiba, Shizuoka, Japan); subsequent illumination with UV light (UG-5; Melles Griot, Irvine, CA) for 90 s reconverted SRIIM into SRII (32Furutani Y. Iwamoto M. Shimono K. Kamo N. Kandori H. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 3482-3489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The difference spectrum was calculated from the spectra constructed with 128 interferograms collected before and after the illumination. Twenty-four spectra obtained in this way were averaged for the SRIIM minus SRII spectrum. For the measurement of the O intermediate of SRII, we used an acidic film (pH 5.0). To accumulate SRIIO, the sample was irradiated for 2 min with light at 260 K through a band pass filter whose transmittance spectrum (<510 nm) is shown in a previous article (33Furutani Y. Iwamoto M. Shimono K. Wada A. Ito M. Kamo N. Kandori H. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5204-5212Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). After the illumination, the film was kept in the dark for 2 min, where SRIIO returns to the original state of SRII almost completely. The difference spectrum was calculated from the spectra constructed with 128 interferograms collected after and before the illumination (SRIIO minus SRII) and before and after relaxing in the dark (SRII minus SRIIO). Twenty-four difference spectra obtained in this way were averaged. Phototaxis Behavior of the Mutants—We assessed motility behavior of cells containing wild-type SRII-HtrII, T204C-HtrII, T204A-HtrII, T204S-HtrII, and Y174F-HtrII fusion complexes exposed to a 100-ms 500-nm light stimulus (Fig. 2). The SRII-HtrII complex mediated a phototaxis response evident as a transient increase in swimming reversal frequency indistinguishable from that of non-fused SRII-HtrII complex, confirming, as reported previously (34Yang C.S. Spudich J.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14207-14214Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), that the linker between SRII and HtrII does not influence signaling. The T204C-HtrII complexes mediated a phototaxis response similar to that of the wild type, whereas T204A-HtrII, T204S-HtrII, and Y174F-HtrII complexes did not mediate detectable responses (Fig. 2). Although the Ser residue of T204S like Thr has an hydroxyl group, it did not mediate phototaxis responses. The previous FTIR study of this mutant showed that the O-H stretching vibration of the hydroxyl group of Thr204 exhibits a frequency downshift of 110 cm-1 upon retinal photoisomerization in the SRII-HtrII complex, whereas that of Ser204 exhibits a much smaller frequency downshift of 24 cm-1 (17Sudo Y. Furutani Y. Shimono K. Kamo N. Kandori H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14166-14172Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, this result suggests that the downshift of Ser204 is insufficient to activate HtrII and supports that the hydrogen bond between the Thr204 hydroxyl and Tyr174 is important for the signaling. Confirmation of the Complex Formation—To confirm complex formation between HtrII and SRII mutants, we used the substantial protection against heat denaturation of SRII by HtrII as a semi-quantitative assessment of binding (30Sudo Y. Yamabi M. Iwamoto M. Shimono K. Kamo N. Photochem. Photobiol. 2003; 78: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). HtrII significantly inhibits denaturation of wild type, T204C, T204A, T204S, and Y174F of SRII (Fig. 3). The Y199A mutant does not bind efficiently to HtrII (28Hippler-Mreyen S. Klare J.P. Wegener A.A. Seidel R. Herrmann C. Schmies G. Nagel G. Bamberg E. Engelhard M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 1203-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and accordingly HtrII does not induce the increase in the thermal stability of Y199A (30Sudo Y. Yamabi M. Iwamoto M. Shimono K. Kamo N. Photochem. Photobiol. 2003; 78: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We include Y199A as a negative control in these measurements. We conclude complex formation occurs between HtrII and SRII mutants T204C, T204A, T204S, and Y174F. Photochemical Reaction Cycle Kinetics of the Mutants—Flash photolysis measurements previously established the photochemical cycle transitions of SRII in the ms-s time window as follows: SRII (500 nm) → SRIIM (390 nm) → SRIIO (560 nm) → SRII (35Chizhov I. Schmies G. Seidel R. Sydor J.R. Luttenberg B. Engelhard M. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 999-1009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). We hereafter will denote SRIIM and SRIIO as the M and O intermediates, respectively. The photocycle kinetics of T204C-HtrII, T204A-HtrII, and T204S-HtrII complexes were similar to that of wild-type SRII-HtrII complex (Fig. 4). Therefore, they are all expressed and form photoactive pigments in the H. salinarum membranes. In the T204C mutant, the absorbance change at 560 nm (O intermediate) is small because of a fast O-decay, consistent with previous reports that the O-decay of a quadruple mutant of SRII including T204C is much faster than that of wild-type SRII (21Iwamoto M. Sudo Y. Shimono K. Araiso T. Kamo N. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 1215-1223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 36Klare J.P. Schmies G. Chizhov I. Shimono K. Kamo N. Engelhard M. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 2156-2164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). On the other hand, mutation of Tyr174 to Phe greatly altered the photocycle kinetics. The Y174F mutant exhibits a fast M-decay and slow O-decay (Fig. 4). Also in the case of BR, mutation of Tyr185 (corresponding to Tyr174 in SRII) strongly stabilizes the O-state (37He Y. Krebs M.P. Fischer W.B. Khorana H.G. Rothschild K.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2282-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Therefore, Tyr residues at this position, which are within van der Waals contact distance of the retinal chromophore, appear to be important for the normal photocycle kinetics of these retinal proteins. Infrared Spectral Changes of SRII upon the Formation of the M and O Intermediates in T204C in the S-H Stretching Frequency Region—S-H stretching vibrations of cysteine residues are well isolated from other vibrations (38Kandori H. Kinoshita N. Shichida Y. Maeda A. Needleman R. Lanyi J.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 5828-5829Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and useful for monitoring their hydrogen bonding strength. Because wild-type SRII and HtrII-(1-159) both lack cysteine residues, no signal in the S-H stretching region (2580-2525 cm-1) was observed in the wild-type SRII-HtrII complex. The T204C mutation in SRII does not inhibit its photosensory function as established above. Therefore, we introduced a cysteine residue at the position of Thr204 in SRII to monitor hydrogen bond changes at the 204 position in signaling states of the receptor. The S-H stretch of Cys204 strengthens upon formation of the K-intermediate like the O-H stretch of Thr204, and the T204C mutant is functional. Therefore, the behavior of the Cys204 is likely to mimic that of Thr204 in the wild-type SRII. It should be noted that fingerprint vibrations (1250-1100 cm-1) show that the M and O intermediates are normally produced in T204C (data not shown). The difference infrared spectra of SRIIM minus SRII and SRIIO minus SRII measured with the T204C-HtrII complex and T204C in the absence of HtrII are shown in Fig. 5. In the SRIIM minus SRII spectrum, the S-H vibration bands appeared at 2560 (-)/2570 (+)cm-1 in T204C-HtrII complex and 2555 (-)/2564 (+)cm-1 in the SRII T204C mutant in the absence of HtrII, respectively. These results suggest that the hydrogen bond assigned to Thr204 and Tyr174 in the dark state is replaced by weaker hydrogen bonding in the M state. The negative and positive bands, corresponding to SRII and SRIIM, respectively, were upshifted (5 cm-1) by the complex formation of SRII with HtrII, implying that the binding of HtrII influences the environment around Thr204 not only in the unphotolysed state but also in the M state. On the other hand, in the SRIIO minus SRII spectrum (Fig. 5), dotted (in the presence of HtrII) and solid lines (in the absence of HtrII) were clearly different. A positive band at 2568 cm-1 appeared in T204C, while a positive band at 2550 cm-1 appeared in the T204C-HtrII complex, suggesting that the hydrogen-bonding strength of Thr204 becomes weaker in the absence of HtrII and stronger in the complex upon the formation of O intermediate. Infrared Spectral Changes of SRII Mutants T79C and D193C upon Formation of the M and O Intermediate in the S-H Stretching Frequency Region—The retinal chromophore is sandwiched between hydrogen bonds of Thr204-Tyr174 and Thr79-Asp75. Arg72 in SRII is an unusual residue because the direction of the side chain of Arg72 differs from that of other haloarchaeal rhodopsins (8Luecke H. Schobert B. Lanyi J.K. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Science. 2001; 293: 1499-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 9Royant A. Nollert P. Edman K. Neutze R. Landau E.M. Pebay-Peyroula E. Navarro J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10131-10136Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Are the HtrII-dependent structural changes, as seen for T204C, characteristic for the 204 position? We tested whether the hydrogen bonds between Thr79-Asp75 and Asp193-Arg72 are altered by association with HtrII. Fingerprint vibrations (1250-1100 cm-1) showed that the M and O intermediates were normally produced in T79C and D193C (data not shown). Fig. 6 shows SRIIM minus SRII and SRIIO minus SRII IR difference spectra of T79C with and without HtrII and D193C with and without HtrII in the 2600-2500 cm-1 region. The spectra in the presence of HtrII well coincide with those in the absence of HtrII, suggesting that neither of the hydrogen bonds between the Thr79-Asp75 and Asp193-Arg72 pairs are altered by association with HtrII. In addition, no difference is observed in the spectra of the D193C mutant. In contrast, a negative peak at 2537 cm-1 in SRII(T79C)M and SRII(T79C)O is upshifted to 2586 cm-1 (M) and 2568 cm-1 (O), respectively, suggesting that the hydrogen bond between Thr79 and Asp75 is weakened by the formation of M and O intermediates as well. These results indicate that HtrII-dependent hydrogen bonding alteration is specific to the Thr204 and Tyr174 bond upon formation of active intermediates. The results above demonstrate that Thr204 and Tyr174 in SRII are each critical residues for phototaxis signaling. Further, the FTIR data argue that the hydrogen bond between them, which is altered during the photocycle, is crucial to development of an active signaling state in the SRII-HtrII complex. Binding of HtrII influences the Thr204-Tyr174 hydrogen bond in SRII and also alters hydrogen bonding attributed to these residues in SRIIM and SRIIO. Although Thr204 has been known as an important residue for color tuning and photocycle kinetics of SRII (21Iwamoto M. Sudo Y. Shimono K. Araiso T. Kamo N. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 1215-1223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 36Klare J.P. Schmies G. Chizhov I. Shimono K. Kamo N. Engelhard M. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 2156-2164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 39Shimono K. Hayashi T. Ikeura Y. Sudo Y. Iwamoto M. Kamo N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23882-23889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), the results here demonstrate a more critical importance of Thr204, namely for production of a phototaxis signal. Our results presented here demonstrate that the Thr204-Tyr174 hydrogen bond in SRII is essential for either SRII activation or signal relay or both. Recently we observed that substitution of a Thr for Ala215 in the proton pump BR, which is expected to introduce the hydrogen bond corresponding to Thr204-Tyr174 into the pump, is sufficient to enable a small but detectable response of HtrII to BR photoactivation (40Sudo Y. Spudich J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Two additional mutations that align BR and HtrII in a similar manner as SRII and HtrII enhance this small response to a robust response comparable with that of the SRII-HtrII complex (40Sudo Y. Spudich J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Our interpretation of these results is that the hydrogen bond is essential for signal relay, because it confers signal relay activity to BR. The bond may also be essential for receptor activation. What chemical role does the Thr204-Tyr174 hydrogen bond play in signaling? Thr204 and Tyr174 are very close to the retinylidene Schiff base (4.3 and 5.1 Å, respectively) (Fig. 1), whose hydrogen bond with the water hydrating its counter ion is disrupted upon trans-cis photoisomerization of the retinal chromophore. Previously, the hydrogen bonding interaction between Thr204 and Tyr174 was found to be greatly strengthened (according to the frequency change of 110 cm-1) after the retinal isomerization in an HtrII-dependent manner (17Sudo Y. Furutani Y. Shimono K. Kamo N. Kandori H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14166-14172Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It is important to note that frequency changes are not large in the K intermediate in general, because protein structural changes are very limited at this early stage of the photocycle. For example, frequency shifts are 18 cm-1 for Thr17, 13 cm-1 for Thr121, and 60 cm-1 for Thr89 in bacteriorhodopsin (41Kandori H. Kinoshita N. Yamazaki Y. Maeda A. Shichida Y. Needleman R. Lanyi J.K. Bizounok M. Herzfeld J. Raap J. Lugtenburg J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4643-4648Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 42Kandori H. Kinoshita N. Yamazaki Y. Maeda A. Shichida Y. Needleman R. Lanyi J.K. Bizounok M. Herzfeld J. Raap J. Lugtenburg J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9676-9683Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Thus, the large spectral shift of 110 cm-1 stands out as an unusual storage of energy in this bond. The O-H frequency differences at the 204 position are 110 cm-1 (wild type, i.e. Thr204, Tyr174), 24 cm-1 (T204S), and 28 cm-1 (Y174F) as reported previously (17Sudo Y. Furutani Y. Shimono K. Kamo N. Kandori H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14166-14172Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The lower values for T204S and Y174F correlate with the lack of signaling function by these mutants. In the case of the Y174F mutant, Thr204 may form a hydrogen bond with the peptide carbonyl C = O of Leu200. In addition, an enhanced strong peak appeared at 2244 cm-1 for the K intermediate of SRII possessing a C14-D-labeled retinal (43Sudo Y. Furutani Y. Wada A. Ito M. Kamo N. Kandori H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 16036-16037Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It is likely that Thr204 is the counterpart of the C14-D group, and enhanced absorption probably originates from the local steric constraint at the C14-D position after the C13=C14 double bond rotation. In this interpretation, steric hindrance between Thr204 and C14-H is caused by photoisomerization, and relaxation of the hindrance that we reported as the restored O-H stretch of Thr204 in the M state (44Furutani Y. Kamada K. Sudo Y. Shimono K. Kamo N. Kandori H. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 2909-2915Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) may induce the structural changes of the F and G helices in SRII and thereby in the HtrII TM2 helix that is tightly wedged between them. Thus, the steric hindrance between Thr204 and the retinal C14-H and the interhelical hydrogen bonding alteration between them may be crucial for conformational changes observed involving helices F and G in SRII and TM2 in HtrII. Wegener et al. (45Wegener A.A. Chizhov I. Engelhard M. Steinhoff H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 881-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) reported that the F-helix SRII moves toward HtrII following light activation of SRII and TM2 of HtrII rotates (15Wegener A.A. Klare J.P. Engelhard M. Steinhoff H.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5312-5319Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The x-ray structure of SRIIM does not show a movement of the F helix and rather indicates G helix motion (16Moukhametzianov R. Klare J.P. Efremov R. Baeken C. Goppner A. Labahn J. Engelhard M. Buldt G. Gordeliy V.I. Nature. 2006; 440: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar); however, the crystal lattice forces clearly greatly inhibit and may distort the resulting motion. Yang et al. (11Yang C.S. Sineshchekov O. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42970-42976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) reported that the distance between the E-F loop of SRII and the HAMP domain extension of TM2 of HtrII is altered by light activation. Finally, Bergo et al. (14Bergo V.B. Spudich E.N. Rothschild K.J. Spudich J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28365-28369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) 3V. B. Bergo, E. N. Spudich, K. J. Rothschild, and J. L. Spudich, manuscript in preparation. observe substantial structural changes in hydrogen bonding between helices F and G and TM2. A causative link between chromophore photoisomerization and these later events may be the early structural change that resolves the steric hindrance between Thr204 and the retinal C14-H.

Here we describe the identification of an ∼220-kDa protein that formed a stable complex with activated forms of Cdc42 and thereby showed characteristics of a downstream target/effector for this GTPase. However, molecular cloning of the cDNA encoding this protein (p220) revealed that it was highly related to Zizimin-1 and identical in sequence to a gene product in the data base designated DOCK11, which are members of the DOCK180 family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for Cdc42 and Rac. Biochemical characterization shows that p220 is a specific GEF for Cdc42, with the GEF activity originating from its DHR2 (for DOCK homology region 2) domain. Nucleotide-depleted Cdc42 forms a stable complex with the DHR2 domain, whereas the binding of activated Cdc42 requires both the DHR2 domain and residues 66-126 within the amino-terminal portion of p220. Moreover, the full-length protein shows markedly higher GEF activity than the isolated DHR2 domain, whereas removal of the amino-terminal 126 amino acids necessary for binding-activated Cdc42 dramatically diminishes the activity. These and other results point to activated Cdc42 providing a positive feedback regulation of the GEF activity of p220. Thus, we refer to p220/DOCK11 as activated Cdc42-associated GEF, befitting its functional activity.

Cdc42 has been shown to regulate multiple cellular processes including actin cytoskeletal organization, membrane trafficking, cytokinesis, and cell polarity, as well as cell growth and differentiation (1Johnson D.I.

More than a dozen downstream target/effectors for Cdc42 have been identified, including scaffold proteins like WASP and IQGAP, theγCOP subunit of the COPI complex that coats trafficking vesicles, as well as different serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases including p21-activated kinase, mixed lineage kinase, and activated Cdc42-associated kinase (11Bagrodia S.

Thus, Cdc42 serves as a critical signaling switch converting an array of stimulatory inputs into a diversity of cellular responses and biological activities. The activation of Cdc42 is directly catalyzed by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). 2The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; ACG, activated Cdc42-associated GEF; DH, Dbl homology; PH, Pleckstrin homology; DHR, DOCK homology region; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-iminotriphosphate); GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); ACB, activated Cdc42 binding. Dbl, which has potent transforming activity when truncated from its amino-terminal end, is the founding member of a family of GEFs for Cdc42 and related Rho GTPases (21Hart M.J. Eva A. Evans T. Aaronson S.A. Cerione R.A. Nature. 1991; 354: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). All of the members of this family are characterized by a tandem array of Dbl homology (DH) and Pleckstrin homology (PH) domains with the DH domains being primarily responsible for mediating GEF activity (22Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar, 23Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 24Erickson J.W. Cerione R.A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 837-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In addition to these conserved sequences, most members of the Dbl family of GEFs contain other functional or protein-protein interaction domains that help to connect the activation of Cdc42 or other related Rho GTPases to a number of downstream signaling partners and cellular activities. For example, Intersectin-1L, a Cdc42-specific GEF, uses five SH3 and two EH domains, together with the tandem DH/PH domain, to couple the activation of Cdc42 to the endocytosis of cell surface receptors, presumably by organizing the F-actin structure along the surfaces of endocytic vesicles (25McGavin M.K. Badour K. Hardy L.A. Kubiseski T.J. Zhang J. Siminovitch K.A. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 1777-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). More recently, a new class of GEFs for Cdc42 and Rac that lack tandem DH and PH domains has been identified. Two examples are Zizimin-1 and DOCK180 (director of cytokinesis 180) (26Meller N. Irani-Tehrani M. Kiosses W.B. Del Pozo M.A. Schwartz M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 27Cote J.F. Vuori K. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4901-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Members of this family of GEFs have relatively high molecular mass (∼200 kDa) and contain two conserved domains, designated CZH1 (for conserved Zizimin homology domain 1)/DHR1 (for DOCK homology region 1) and CZH2/DHR2. The CZH2/DHR2 domain represents the primary functional unit, because it catalyzes the nucleotide exchange activity of the GTPase substrates (26Meller N. Irani-Tehrani M. Kiosses W.B. Del Pozo M.A. Schwartz M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 27Cote J.F. Vuori K. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4901-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Although Dbl family GEFs are not found in plants, members of the Zizimin-1/DOCK180 family are conserved throughout yeast, plants, and animals (26Meller N. Irani-Tehrani M. Kiosses W.B. Del Pozo M.A. Schwartz M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 27Cote J.F. Vuori K. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4901-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Many members of the DOCK180 family, including DOCK180 itself, as well as DOCK2 and DOCK3, activate Rac to regulate cell adhesion, cell spreading, migration, and phagocytosis (28Wu Y.C. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1998; 392: 501-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 29Fukui Y. Hashimoto O. Sanui T. Oono T. Koga H. Abe M. Inayoshi A. Noda M. Oike M. Shirai T. Sasazuki T. Nature. 2001; 412: 826-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 30Namekata K. Enokido Y. Iwasawa K. Kimura H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14331-14337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, the function of Zizimin-1, a specific GEF for Cdc42, is still not known. In the classical model for the activation of small GTPases, the GEF interacts with the GDP-bound form of its substrate GTPase and catalyzes the dissociation of GDP. The relatively high cellular concentrations of GTP (relative to GDP) allow an exchange of the dissociated GDP for GTP, which then induces structural changes within the GTPase that enable it to interact with downstream signaling target/effector proteins. In many cases, the binding of GTP to the GTPase also prompts its dissociation from the GEF, thereby enabling the GEF to act catalytically in promoting GDP-GTP exchange on multiple GTPases. However, there have been some recent reports showing that GEFs can engage in stable complexes with the GTP-bound form of their substrate GTPase. One example is the Cool-2/α-Pix (cloned out of library 2/α p21-activated kinase-interactive exchange factor) protein, which contains the tandem arrangement of DH and PH domains characteristic of Dbl family GEFs but was originally identified through its ability to bind to the Cdc42/Rac-target p21-activated kinase (31Bagrodia S. Taylor S.J. Jordon K.A. Van Aelst L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23633-23636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 32Manser E. Looh T.H. Koh C.G. Zhao Z.S. Chen X.Q. Tan L. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Cool-2/α-Pix forms a stable complex with activated (GTP-bound) Cdc42, which in turn strongly stimulates the GEF activity of Cool-2/α-Pix toward Rac. This has led to the suggestion that Cool-2/α-Pix is able to mediate a Cdc42-Rac signaling cascade (33Baird D. Feng Q. Cerione R.A. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In this report, we have identified a Cdc42-GEF that exhibits an interesting variation on the theme described above. This new GEF is a member of the Zizimin-1/DOCK180 family, and because it was originally isolated through its ability to bind activated forms of Cdc42, we refer to it here as activated Cdc42-associated GEF (ACG). ACG appears to represent a novel example of a GEF that responds to activated Cdc42 in a manner that may allow for positive feedback stimulation of GDP-GTP exchange on additional Cdc42 molecules. Chemicals, Plasmids, and Antibodies—The site-directed mutagenesis kits and Pfu DNA polymerase were purchased from Stratagene. Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse IgG was obtained from Molecular Probes (Invitrogen). Monoclonal anti-HA antibody (HA.11) was from Covance, and the IMAGE cDNA clones were purchased from ATCC and Open Biosystems. Preparation of GST Fusion Proteins and Their Use in Pull-down Assays—Escherichia coli containing plasmids encoding GST fusion proteins were cultured to a density of A600 = 1.0. Expression of the fusion proteins was induced by adding isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (final concentration, 0.5 mm) to the culture medium for 3-5 h. The bacteria were precipitated by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 10 min, and the pellet was resuspended in a bacterial lysis buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). The suspension was sonicated and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was collected and incubated with glutathione-agarose beads (1:1 slurry in the bacterial lysis buffer) for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation. The beads were then washed (three times) with lysis buffer, and the immobilized GST fusion protein beads were resuspended in the same buffer. For large scale pull-down assays, the GST fusion protein beads containing 40-80 μg of protein were incubated with 10 ml of mammalian cell lysates (10-20 mg of protein) at 4 °C for 2-3 h with rotation. The beads were washed (three times) with mammalian cell lysis buffer (40 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) (8-10 ml each time) and resuspended with 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Following SDS-PAGE, the proteins that co-precipitated with the GST fusion proteins were visualized by staining with 0.5-1% Coomassie Blue. The bands of interest were excised and subjected to microsequencing by microcapillary reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography nano-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry on a Finnigan LCQ DECA quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer at the Harvard Microchemistry Facility. For small scale pull-down assays, the GST fusion protein beads containing 10-20 μg of protein were incubated with 0.5-1.0 ml of cell lysates (0.5-1.0 mg of protein) at 4 °C for 2-3 h with rotation. The beads were washed (three times) with lysis buffer and resuspended in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The co-precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and identified by immunoblotting. Cell Culture, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblots—Mouse embryonic teratoma (P19) cells and COS7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The transfection of plasmid DNA into COS7 cells was performed using the Lipofectamine transfection kit (Invitrogen). The cells were lysed after 48 h of transfection. For the preparation of cell lysates, the cells were rinsed with PBS once and lysed with mammalian cell lysis buffer (0.5 ml/60-mm dish or 1 ml/100-mm dish) with rocking at 4 °C for 20 min. The lysates were collected and cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 4 min and then immediately used. For immunoprecipitation, the precleared cell lysates were incubated with primary antibody on ice for 30 min. Protein A beads were then added, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with rotation. The beads were washed (three times) with mammalian cell lysis buffer, and the immunoprecipitated complexes were used either for GEF assays or directly dissolved in sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. Immunoblots were performed as suggested in the instructions accompanying the ECL immunoblot kits (Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescence Staining—The cells were cultured on coverslips to 50-80% confluence. After the culture medium was removed, the cells were rinsed (two times) with PBS, fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde at 25 °C for 10 min, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS at 25 °C for 10 min. Following washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with primary antibody at 37 °C for 30 min. The cells were then washed with PBS (three times) and incubated with secondary antibody that was conjugated with a fluorescent dye at 37 °C for 30 min. Finally, the cells were washed with PBS (three times for 10 min each time). The coverslips were mounted on glass slides, and immunofluorescence staining was monitored with a Leica confocal fluorescent microscope. Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Assays—Nucleotide exchange activity was assayed as previously described (21Hart M.J. Eva A. Evans T. Aaronson S.A. Cerione R.A. Nature. 1991; 354: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). GST-Cdc42 or GST-Rac (typically 4 μg) was incubated with 10 μm [3H]GDP(12.6 Ci/mmol) in 25 μl of loading buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm AMP-PNP), for 25 min at 25 °C. Immunoprecipitated ACG was added to the exchange assay mixture containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 80 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm AMP-PNP, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm GTPγSto a final volume of 40 μl and incubated at 25 °C for 15 min. Aliquots (10 μl) from the GST-Cdc42 loading incubation were added to 40 μl of the exchange assay mixture to start the reaction. After incubation at 25 °C for the indicated times, aliquots (10 μl) of the reaction mixture were removed and diluted into 0.5 ml of washing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 80 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) to stop the reaction. The samples were placed on BA85 filters and washed (three times) with washing buffer. The radioactivity on the filter, representing the amount of [3H]GDP bound to Cdc42 that was not exchanged with GTPγS, was quantified by scintillation counting. Identification of an ∼220-kDa Binding Partner for Activated Cdc42— We have been using the mouse embryonic teratoma cell line P19 as a model system for examining the role of Cdc42 in cellular differentiation. In particular, we have used P19 cell lysates to perform pull-down experiments with GST-Cdc42 fusion proteins as a way of potentially identifying new Cdc42-regulatory proteins and target/effectors. Fig. 1A shows the results of an experiment where lysates were incubated with glutathione-conjugated agarose beads bound to the GTPase-defective GST-Cdc42(Q61L) mutant. The co-precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue (lane 2). A number of additional incubations were performed to control for nonspecific binding of bacterial proteins to GST-Cdc42 or for proteins from P19 cell lysates that might either associate directly with the GST moiety or with beads alone. These included incubations of GST-Cdc42(Q61L) with the lysis buffer (Fig. 1A, lane 1), GST with P19 cell lysates (Fig. 1A, lane 3), and glutathione-conjugated agarose beads with the cell lysates (Fig. 1A, lane 4). We found that a number of proteins appeared to selectively co-precipitate with GST-Cdc42(Q61L). The predominant protein was ∼180 kDa (denoted by the white arrow in lane 2 of Fig. 1A) and was determined to be IQGAP1 (34Hart M.J. Callow M.G. Souza B. Polakis P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2997-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 35McCallum S.J. Erickson J.W. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22537-22544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Among the other most consistently observed bands that specifically bound to GST-Cdc42(Q61L) was one that corresponded to an ∼220 kDa protein (see the black arrow in lane 2 of Fig. 1A). The p220 band was excised and subjected to microsequence analysis. Six peptide sequences were obtained and aligned against the NBCI GenBank™ data base using a Blast search (36Altschul S.F. Madden T.M. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59923) Google Scholar). Four of the six peptides were identical to Zizimin-1, with the remaining two peptides showing ∼90% identity. This indicated that p220 was a member of the Zizimin-1/DOCK180 family of GEFs. We further found that the peptide sequences XP_060056 and NP_653259, derived from computational analysis of the human genomic DNA sequence, completely matched the six peptide sequences of p220. Subsequently, Cote and Vuori (27Cote J.F. Vuori K. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4901-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) classified XP_060056 as a member of the DOCK180 superfamily and named it DOCK11. However, for the sake of simplicity, we refer to this protein as ACG, because this more accurately depicts its functional properties (see below). To obtain the full-length cDNA encoding ACG, we used the derived genomic DNA sequences NM_144658 and XP_060056 to design primers to perform PCR, with a human brain cDNA library serving as a template. We also used Image clones 2329541, 2021991, 4671357, 5582516, and 5583671 to help assemble the cDNA encoding ACG. The full-length cDNA contains 6650 base pairs (GenBank™ accession number AY692226), corresponding to 2073 amino acid residues (Fig. 1B). The sequence for ACG was analyzed by a NCBI Blast search against GenBank™ and was found to contain three distinct domains. These are an amino-terminal PH domain (Fig. 1B, in bold), a DHR1/CZH1 domain located approximately in the middle of the ACG molecule (boxed), and a DHR2/CZH2 domain found near the carboxyl-terminal end of the protein (boxed) (also see the schematic depiction of full-length ACG at the top of Fig. 3A). Given the presence of the DHR1 and DHR2 domains, ACG shows the typical earmarks of a member of the Zizimin-1/DOCK180 family of proteins. To further confirm and characterize the interaction of ACG with activated forms of Cdc42, we overexpressed HA-tagged ACG in COS7 cells and examined its ability to be pulled down by GST-Cdc42 (wild type); GST-Cdc42(Q61L); GST-Cdc42(Q61L,K183S,K184S), which represents a GTPase-defective and γCOP binding-defective double mutant; and GST-Cdc42(Q61L,Y40C), which is GTPase-defective as well as defective for binding target/effectors like p21-activated kinase, mixed lineage kinase, and activated Cdc42-associated kinase. As shown in Fig. 1C, HA-tagged ACG was co-precipitated with Cdc42(Q61L), as well as with Cdc42(Q-61L,K183S,K184S) (lanes 2 and 3), but not with wild-type Cdc42 nor with Cdc42(Q61L,Y40C) (lanes 1 and 4). Interestingly, the binding of Cdc42(Q61L,K183S,K184S) to ACG was much stronger than that of Cdc42(Q61L) (compare lanes 3 and 2), suggesting that ACG may compete with γCOP for Cdc42. Overall, these results confirmed that ACG forms stable complexes with activated forms of Cdc42. ACG Is a GEF for Cdc42—DOCK180 has been shown to exhibit GEF activity toward Rac (37Kiyokawa E. Hashimoto Y. Kobayashi S. Sugimura H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3331-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), whereas Zizimin-1 (also known as DOCK9) acts as a specific GEF for Cdc42 (26Meller N. Irani-Tehrani M. Kiosses W.B. Del Pozo M.A. Schwartz M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In each of these cases, the GEF activity is mediated through a highly conserved region designated as the DHR2 or the CZH2 domain (26Meller N. Irani-Tehrani M. Kiosses W.B. Del Pozo M.A. Schwartz M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 27Cote J.F. Vuori K. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4901-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Thus, we were interested in seeing whether ACG exhibited GEF activity. We were unable to express either full-length ACG or its DHR2 domain in a soluble form in E. coli or to obtain sufficient levels in insect cells to allow biochemical characterization. However, we were able to express the DHR2 domain as an HA-tagged protein in COS7 cells and then assay its interactions with different GST-linked GTPases through pull-down assays. We found that unlike the case for full-length ACG, which binds preferentially to activated forms of Cdc42 (e.g. Cdc42(Q61L)), the recombinant HA-tagged DHR2 domain bound selectively to the nucleotide binding-defective Cdc42(T17N) mutant (Fig. 2A), as is typically the case for GEFs. The DHR2 domain of ACG did not bind to the nucleotide binding-defective mutant of Rac (Rac(T17N)) and only bound very weakly to the corresponding mutant for the related GTPase TC10 (TC10(T31N)). Thus, these data suggested that the DHR2 domain of ACG may exhibit specific GEF activity toward Cdc42. To further examine this possibility, we transfected HA-tagged full-length ACG or the HA-tagged DHR2 domain in COS7 cells, immunoprecipitated these proteins with anti-HA antibody, and then assayed their GEF activity. We used anti-HA antibody that was immunoprecipitated from vector-transfected cell lysates as a negative control, and EDTA, which chelates Mg2+ and strongly stimulates GDP-GTP exchange on small Ras-related GTPases, as a positive control. As shown in Fig. 2B, full-length ACG was an effective GEF for Cdc42, such that its activity was comparable with that obtained upon treatment with excess EDTA, whereas the recombinant DHR2 domain caused only a minor increase in the rate of [3H]GDP dissociation from Cdc42, compared with the control condition (i.e. Cdc42 alone). These results were somewhat surprising, because often the isolated limit-functional domains of GEFs show much stronger activity than their full-length parental proteins, because of the need for regulatory events to activate the GEF activity of the latter. This suggested that full-length ACG can be effectively activated in cells. Fig. 2C further demonstrates that the GEF activity for ACG is specific for Cdc42. As previously reported, insect cell recombinant Cool-2/α-Pix shows Rac-GEF activity and stimulates the rate of [3H]GDP dissociation from Rac (38Feng Q. Baird D. Cerione R.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3492-3504Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), whereas ACG is absolutely ineffective. Characterization of the Interaction of ACG with Activated Forms of Cdc42—The preference shown by ACG in binding to activated forms of Cdc42 (Fig. 1) differs from what has been reported for full-length Zizimin-1, which selectively interacts with nucleotide-depleted forms of Cdc42 (26Meller N. Irani-Tehrani M. Kiosses W.B. Del Pozo M.A. Schwartz M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), as is the usual case for Cdc42-GEFs. This distinctive feature of ACG raised the possibility that activated forms of Cdc42 might exert regulatory effects on its Cdc42-GEF activity. To examine this possibility, we first needed to better define how activated Cdc42 binds to full-length ACG. A series of HA-tagged truncation mutants of ACG were prepared (Fig. 3A) and expressed in COS7 cells, and then their abilities to bind to either GST-Cdc42(Q61L), Cdc42(T17N), or wild-type GST-Cdc42 were determined through pull-down assays. Full-length ACG served as a positive control for binding to activated Cdc42(Q61L), whereas the isolated DHR2 domain was used as a positive control for binding to Cdc42(T17N). Interestingly, when the amino-terminal 272 amino acid residues of ACG were removed, its binding preference switched from activated forms of Cdc42 (e.g. Cdc42(Q61L)) to the nucleotide-depleted Cdc42(T17N) (Fig. 3B, fourth panel from top). This suggested that the amino-terminal portion of ACG was not only necessary for binding to activated forms of Cdc42 but also interfered with and/or weakened the binding of nucleotide-depleted Cdc42 and thereby repressed GEF activity. Surprisingly, when the carboxyl-terminal DHR2 domain was deleted, binding to Cdc42(Q61L) was reduced (Fig. 3B, second panel from the top). Furthermore, a more substantial truncation that deleted residues 671-2073 resulted in the complete loss of binding to both activated and nucleotide-depleted forms of Cdc42 (Fig. 3B, third panel from the top). Taken together, these data suggest that the DHR2 domain is required for binding to activated as well as nucleotide-depleted forms of Cdc42. Apparently, the DHR2 domain represents the sole binding site for the latter, whereas the amino-terminal region of ACG together with DHR2 are necessary for optimal binding to activated Cdc42. Because the truncation of the first 272 amino acid residues resulted in the loss of binding to Cdc42(Q61L) and an accompanying increase in the binding to Cdc42(T17N) (Fig. 3B), and because the PH domain of ACG is located within this region (Fig. 3A), we wondered whether the PH domain might play a role in regulating the binding of different forms of Cdc42. Thus, we generated two more amino-terminal truncation mutants of ACG, designated as ΔN65 and ΔN126 (Fig. 4A). Both of these truncation mutants still contained the PH domain. The HA-tagged ΔN65 and ΔN126 were transfected into COS7 cells, and their abilities to bin"

The matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrum of positive ELISA fractions revealed a molecular mass of 1919.0 Da, in agreement with the sequence qIRYRQCYFNPISCF, with bridged cysteines. This sequence was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization tandem TOF/TOF mass spectrometry analysis. The corresponding Ae-AS-C cDNA was amplified by PCR, and the sequence of the peptide was confirmed. An in vitro radiochemical assay was used to study the inhibitory effect of synthetic Ae-AS-C on juvenile hormone biosynthesis by the isolated corpora allata (CA) of adult female A. aegypti. The inhibitory action of synthetic Ae-AS-C was dose-dependent; with a maximum at 10–9 m. Ae-AS-C showed no inhibitory activity in the presence of farnesoic acid, an immediate precursor of juvenile hormone, indicating that the Ae-AS-C target is located before the formation of farnesoic acid in the pathway. The sensitivity of the CA to inhibition by Ae-AS-C in the in vitro assay varied during the adult life; the CA was most sensitive during periods of low synthetic activity. In addition, the levels of Ae-AS-C in the brain were studied using ELISA and reached a maximum at 3 days after eclosion. These studies suggest that Ae-AS-C is an important regulator of CA activity in A. aegypti.

Comprehensive Molecular Insect Science. Vol. 6. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York2005: 55-115Google Scholar). In adult female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, JH levels are low at adult eclosion, elevated in sugar-fed females, and low again after a blood meal (3Shapiro A.B. Wheelock G.D. Hagedorn H.H. Baker F.C. Tsai L.W. Schooley D.A. J. Insect Physiol. 1986; 32: 867-877Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar). JH titer is fundamentally controlled by the rate of biosynthesis in the corpora allata gland (CA) (4Li Y.P. Hernandez-Martinez S. Unnithan G.C. Feyereisen R. Noriega F.G. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 33: 1307-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The rate of CA activity is, in turn, regulated, in part, by allato-regulatory peptides that exert either allatostatic (inhibitory) or allatotropic (stimulatory) activity (5Li Y.P. Hernandez-Martinez S. Noriega F.G. Reg. Peptides. 2004; 118: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 6Li Y. Unnithan G.C. Veenstra J.A. Feyereisen R. Noriega F.G. J. Exp. Biol. 2003; 206: 1825-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We previously reported that the biosynthetic activity of the A. aegypti CA in vitro was inhibited by mosquito brain extracts (5Li Y.P. Hernandez-Martinez S. Noriega F.G. Reg. Peptides. 2004; 118: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and then we used confocal, laser-scanning microscopy studies to show specific patterns of immunostaining for AS-C in the cells of the brain of A. aegypti (7Hernandez-Martinez S. Li Y. Rodriguez M.H. Lanz-Mendoza H. Noriega F.G. Cell Tissue Res. 2005; 321: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Here we describe the purification, biochemical, molecular, and functional characterization of A. aegypti PISCF-allatostatin (or Ae-AS-C). It is the first comprehensive report since the original description of a member of this peptide family as an inhibitor of JH synthesis in the lepidopteran Manduca sexta (8Kramer S.J. Toschi A. Miller C.A. Kataoka H. Quistad G.B. Li J.P. Carney R.L. Schooley D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9458-9462Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In addition, we describe the developmental stage-dependent Ae-AS-C inhibition of JH synthesis, as well as the changes in peptide levels in head samples. These studies suggest that Ae-AS-C is an important regulator of CA activity in A. aegypti. Chemicals—(E,E)-Farnesoic acid (FA) was purchased from Echelon (Salt Lake City, UT), and mevalonolactone, a precursor of mevalonic acid (MVA) was from Sigma. Insects—A. aegypti of the Rockefeller strain were reared at 28 °C and 80% relative humidity with a photoperiod cycle of 16 h of light/8 h of dark as previously described (4Li Y.P. Hernandez-Martinez S. Unnithan G.C. Feyereisen R. Noriega F.G. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 33: 1307-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Adult virgin females were offered a cotton wool pad soaked in a 3% sucrose solution until 12–16 h before blood feeding. We will refer to the cotton wool pad sucrose-fed females as “sugar-fed.” Three-day-old female mosquitoes were fed pig blood equilibrated to 37 °C, and ATP was added to the blood meal to a final concentration of 1 mm immediately before use as previously described (9Noriega F.G. Colonna A.E. Wells M.A. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 29: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Extraction and Purification of A. aegypti Allatostatin-C—The mosquitoes were homogenized in Bennett's solution (1% NaCl, 5% formic acid, and 1% trifluoroacetic acid in 1 m HCl) (10Bennet H.P.J. Brown C.A. Solomon S. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4530-4538Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). After centrifugation (14,000 × g, 10 min), the supernatant was loaded onto a Sep-Pak SPE C18 cartridge (Waters, Milford, MA), which had been equilibrated with aqueous 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and then eluted with 80% acetronitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The eluate was then lyophilized. The residue was dissolved in water and subsequently stirred overnight with 200 ml of SP-Sephadex C-25 resin (Amersham Biosciences) that was previously equilibrated with 1 m acetic acid. The resin was poured into a column and washed with 1 m acetic acid. The fractions were sequentially eluted from the column with increasing concentrations of ammonium acetate (pH 7.0). The fractions were checked for immunoreactivity using the Ang-AS-C ELISA described below. Immuno-positive fractions (eluted with 0.1 and 0.2 m ammonium acetate) were combined, loaded onto a Sep-Pak SPE C18 cartridge and eluted with 80% acetronitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The eluate was assayed to confirm immune reactivity with the Ang-AS-C ELISA, dried and analyzed by HPLC. The HPLC protocol was as follows. A Dionex Summit system (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA) equipped with a UVD 170U detector, 680 HPLC pump, TCC 100 column oven, and Chromeleon software was employed. The first column was an Ultrasphere C18 (4.6 × 250 mm) (Beckman, Fullerton, CA) eluted with a gradient of 5–60% acetronitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The collected fractions were assayed for immune reactivity by ELISA as described. Positive fractions were combined and loaded onto a second Ultrasphere C18 column (4.6 × 150 mm) (Beckman) and eluted with the same solvent system and assayed for immune reactivity. Positive fractions were again combined, loaded onto a third column, a Wide-Pore C8 (4.6 × 250 mm) (J. T. Baker, Phillipsburg, NJ), and eluted with the same gradient of solvents. Sample Preparation for Mass Spectrometry—The HPLC fraction that tested positive against A. gambiae allatostatin antisera was reconstituted in ultrapure water (18 mΩ cm; Barnstead, Dubuque, IA) containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Ae-AS-C was then desalted and concentrated using C18 Zip Tips (Millipore, Billerica, MA) following the manufacturer's protocols. Two μl of the desalted peptide solution were premixed with an equal volume of a 10 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid solution (Sigma-Aldrich). One micro liter of the mixture was deposited on a 192-well stainless steel MALDI plate and allowed to dry before analysis. MALDI-TOF and TOF/TOF Analysis—Mass spectra were acquired in the 1–6-kDa range via tandem matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF MS) using a 4700 Proteomics Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Framlingham, MA) equipped with a diode-pumped Nd:YAG laser (200 Hz, 355 nm). Analyses were performed in delayed extraction positive ion reflectron mode at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV, with the data system operating under automatic control. Tandem mass spectra (MS/MS) were obtained with a 1-Da precursor ion selection window, and ion activation was achieved using high energy collision-induced dissociation. Smoothed and denoised mass spectra were exported in ASCII format from the Data Explorer MS software and input into Excel. Experimental fragment ion peak lists were compared with theoretical peak lists for the peptide sequence deduced from the cDNA. A match was considered positive if the difference in mass values was less than 0.1 Da. Theoretical fragment ion peak lists were obtained using the MS product on-line application. A user-defined amino acid with the elemental formula C3H4ONS was included in the query to represent the two oxidized cysteine residues. Bioinformatic Analysis—The known motif QIRYRQCYFNPISCF was used to query a custom nucleotide data base created from the public available contigs of A. aegypti via WU-tblastn software. To compensate for the small size of the query sequence the following parameters were used: W = 3 (word size), T = 14 (neighborhood word threshold), and E = 10 (default value; the E from the Karlin-Altschul equation). All of the consecutive BLAST analyses were done using the NCBI BLAST suite of programs with the default parameters. Multiple alignments and phylogenetic trees were calculated with the clustalx software (11Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 24: 4876-4882Crossref Scopus (35075) Google Scholar). RNA Extraction and cDNA Cloning—Total RNA was isolated from adult female mosquitoes using RNA-binding glass powder as previously described (12Noriega F.G. Wells M.A. Insect Mol. Biol. 1993; 2: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Contaminating genomic DNA was removed with Optizyme™ RNase-free DNase I (Fisher). First Strand cDNA synthesis was carried out using SuperScript® II first strand synthesis system for reverse transcription-PCR (Invitrogen). PCR was performed in a Mastercycler gradient (Eppendorf, Westbury, NY) using Taq DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI). PCR products were cleaned with the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and sequenced by the DNA Core Sequencing Facility of Florida International University (Miami, FL). Synthetic A. aegypti Allatostatin-C—Ae-AS-C was provided by Alpha Diagnostic International (San Antonio, TX), purified by reversed phase liquid chromatography, and assessed to be ≥99% pure by analytical reversed phase liquid chromatography, MALDI-TOF MS, and amino acid analysis. Stock aqueous solutions of synthetic allatostatin (10–3 m) were stored in aliquots at –80 °C. For each assay, a new aliquot was removed from the stock and dried under nitrogen, and dilutions were made by adding the required amount of incubation medium. In Vitro Radiochemical Assay for CA Activity—The CA complexes were isolated as previously described (4Li Y.P. Hernandez-Martinez S. Unnithan G.C. Feyereisen R. Noriega F.G. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 33: 1307-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Rates of JH biosynthesis were estimated by the in vitro radiochemical assay (13Feyereisen R. Tobe S.S. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 111: 372-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 14Feyereisen R. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 111: 530-539Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar), as previously modified (4Li Y.P.

Feyereisen R. Noriega F.G. J. Exp. Biol. 2003; 206: 1825-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, CA complexes were incubated for 4 h in fresh medium containing 3H-labeled methionine. Under our assay conditions, the incorporation of 3H-labeled methionine into JH III was linear for at least 6 h. After extraction and separation by thin layer chromatography, the JH III band was removed, placed into scintillation mixture, and assayed for 3H. The quantity of JH produced was calculated from the specific activity of the 3H-labeled methionine in the medium. The effect of Ae-AS-C, FA, and MVA were tested by adding them directly into the CA incubation medium. Primary Antibodies against Anopheles gambiae Allatostatin-C—Polyclonal antisera were custom prepared by Genemed Synthesis Inc. (San Francisco, CA) using rabbits injected with Ang-AS-C conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin as previously described (7Hernandez-Martinez S. Li Y. Rodriguez M.H. Lanz-Mendoza H. Noriega F.G. Cell Tissue Res. 2005; 321: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Competitive ELISA for PISCF-Allatostatin—Mosquito heads were collected by decapitation. The samples were homogenized in 80% acetronitrile and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were recovered and stored at –80 °C. Standard curves were produced using synthetic Ang-AS-C made by Biopeptide Company (San Diego, CA). Two 96-well plates were used for each assay. For Plate 1, 2000 fmol of conjugated keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated Ang-AS-C (dissolved in 20 μl of 80% acetronitrile) were coated onto wells by drying at 37 °C for 90 min and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with 100 μl of a 0.1 m sodium carbonate/sodium bicarbonate buffer (coating buffer, pH 9.6). After washing three times with 100 μl of 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T), 150 μl of blocking solution were added to each well (1% bovine serum albumin in PBS), and the plate was incubated for another 90 min at 37 °C. For Plate 2, head samples or standards (10–160 fmol of Ang-AS-C) in 20 μl of 80% acetronitrile were dried in the wells at 37 °C for 90 min, and then 100 μl of primary antiserum (1:8000 dilution in blocking solution) were added to each well. The plate was mixed for 1 min, and samples (mixture of first antibody + samples or standards) were transferred to the precoated and blocked plate 1. Plate 1 was incubated for 90 min at 37 °C. After washing three times with 100 μl of PBS-T, 100 μl of secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit monoclonal antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, 1:3000 in blocking solution) were added to each well. The plates were then incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. After three final PBS-T washes, 100 μl of substrate mixture of tetramethyl benzidine and H2O2 (Pierce) were added to each well and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 2 m H2SO4 to each well, and optical density was read at 450 nm on an Elx 808 Ultra Microplate Reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, VT). Statistical Analysis—Statistical analyses of the data were performed by t test using GraphPad Prism version 3.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). The results were expressed as the means ± S.E. and considered significantly different at p ≤ 0.05. Isolation and Biochemical Characterization of Ae-AS-C—A single positive immunoreactive HLPC fraction was isolated and lyophilized, and its primary structure and molecular mass were obtained by MALDI-TOF (Fig. 1) and MALDI-TOF/TOF MS (Fig. 2). The MALDI-TOF spectrum reveals a protonated molecular ion ([M+H]+) at m/z 1919.0, in agreement with the expected value of m/z 1918.9 for qIRYRQCYFNPISCF with the two cysteines bridged, and where “q” stands for a pyroglutamic acid residue. High energy collision-induced dissociation on the 1919.0 precursor ion produced diagnostic fragments that confirmed the proposed amino acid sequence (Fig. 2). Because of the cyclic nature of the C-terminal portion of this peptide, a complete series of ladder y and b ions was not obtained. However, internal and immonium fragment ions originated within the cyclic peptide domain confirmed the proposed sequence.FIGURE 2MALDI TOF/TOF MS/MS spectrum of the Ae-AS-C precursor ion with m/z = 1919.0. The inset describes the sequence of the peptide obtained from this spectrum and the fragment ions identified. The square boxes surrounding one and two amino acid residues represent immonium and internal dipeptide fragment ions, respectively. The precursor ion at m/z = 1919.0 was buried in a complex part of the mass spectrum marked with an arrow.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Molecular Cloning of Ae-AS-C—The A. aegypti genome available at NCBI was searched for sequences that were an exact match to the QIRYRQCYFNPISCF peptide, resulting in the alignment with contig 1047197605538 (accession number AAGE01111521). We consequently designed primers against specific regions of this gene and carried out PCR using A. aegypti cDNA as template. This resulted in the amplification of the complete cDNA coding for the allatostatin-C preprohormone (cited as A. aegypti experimental in Fig. 3A). The Ae-As-C sequence was used to query again the nonredundant data base at NCBI via position iterated BLAST (PSI BLAST) to reveal similar sequences. After 10 iterations, sequences from Drosophila pseudoobscura, (GA13352-PA), Drosophila melanogaster (AF346433_1), Samia cynthia ricini (AAY68369.1), Pseudaletia unipuncta (AAA93257.1), and Spodoptera frugiperda (Q868F8) were obtained with alignments above threshold (Fig. 3A). ENSEMBL pipeline revealed a possible candidate for a full-length Aedes allatostatin (transcript 25005.m03793 in TIGR/VB geneset version 0.5, AAEL005747-RA in VectorBase geneset version 1.0) as well as two predicted allatostatin genes for A. gambiae (ENSANGP00000031980 and ENSANGP00000012635; noted as A. gambiae_1 and A. gambiae_2 in the figures, respectively). Furthermore, a manually submitted sequence to VectorBase by Mark Brown (15Riehle M.A. Garczynski S.F. Crim J.W. Hill C.A. Brown M.R. Science. 2002; 298: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) has been included to the analysis as A. gambiae_3. All of these sequences plus the one from A. aegypti that we verified experimentally are shown in a multiple alignment that leads to a phylogenetic tree (Fig. 3B). Two sequences from M. sexta (P42559 and AAB20830) were excluded because they gave a high scoring pair only 15 amino acids long. Genomic Organization of Ae-AS-C—Alignment of the Ae-AS-C cDNA with the genomic clone 1047197605538 (contig 9205, supercont1.072 bases 1001–23571) from the A. aegypti genome project revealed the presence of two introns in the Ae-AS-C gene. The same is true for the gene predicted by the ENSEMBL transcript AAEL005747-RA, the length and sequence of which are identical to the gene that has been verified experimentally and is being reported here (supplemental Fig. SI). Based on contig 9205, the Ae-AS-C cDNA has the following structure: Exon 1 complement (23464..23571), Exon 2 complement (1828..1961), and Exon 3 complement (1001..1112) (supplemental Fig. SIIA). Intron 1 is 21 Kb in length and is littered with repeats including tandem repeats, transposable elements, etc. (all coordinates mentioned in reference to contig 9205). A complete annotation of the repeats in contig 9205 is available through VectorBase. In A. gambiae two different ortholog peptides have been predicted by the ENSEMBL pipeline. Both consist of two exons that show high similarity with exons 2 and 3 of the Ae-AS-C (75 and 83.8% identity, respectively). The manually submitted sequence from M. Brown (15Riehle M.A. Garczynski S.F. Crim J.W. Hill C.A. Brown M.R. Science. 2002; 298: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) is longer and supports the existence of a third exon, similar to exon 1 of A. aegypti (75.9% identity). Furthermore, the existence of this third exon is supported by expressed sequence tags that cover the region and by SNAP predictions (supplemental Fig. SIIB). In D. melanogaster the ortholog AS-C is being mapped into a region filled with five genes. Fewer genes are observed in A. gambiae and A. aegypti that might simply be reflecting the intensity of studying of D. melanogaster. The coding sequence consisted of three exons, although the 5′-untranslated region contains an additional exon/intron donor site (outline boxes in supplemental Fig. SIIC). It is very interesting that in the same strand, in a distance of less than 100 Kb from AS-C, is located the gene Samuel (CG31868). The potential orthologs of Samuel (unique best reciprocal hits) in A. aegypti (AAEL005643) and A. gambiae (ENSANGT00000012793) are located at the same relative distance from AS-C but in the opposite strand (supplemental Fig. SII). Effect of Ae-AS-C on JH Biosynthesis—The effect on JH synthesis of increasing concentrations of Ae-AS-C (10–10–10–6m) was tested on glands with high activity (3-day-old sugar-fed females) and low activity (females 24 h after a blood meal). Maximal inhibition of JH biosynthesis in both sugar-fed and blood-fed females occurred at a concentration of 10–9m (results not shown); this concentration was used in all subsequent experiments. In sugar-fed females, acquisition of sensitivity to a low concentration of AS-C occurs in the CA connected to the brain 3 days after emergence (Fig. 4A). Similar results were obtained in sugar-fed females when CA were disconnected from the brain (results not shown). In blood-fed females, CA disconnected from the brain are very sensitive to AS-C during the first 24 h (Fig. 4B). Similar results were obtained in blood-fed females when CA were connected to the brain (results not shown). The addition of exogenous FA stimulates JH synthesis in a dose-response fashion (6Li Y. Unnithan G.C. Veenstra J.A. Feyereisen R. Noriega F.G. J. Exp. Biol. 2003; 206: 1825-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We analyzed the effect of Ae-AS-C on the rate of JH biosynthesis by FA-stimulated CA connected to the brain. Ae-AS-C showed no inhibitory activity on FA-stimulated CA connected to the brain from either 3-day-old sugar-fed females or females 24 h after blood feeding (Fig. 5). Similar results were obtained in blood-fed females when CA were disconnected from the brain (results not shown). The addition of exogenous MVA, an early precursor of JH (16Bellés X. Martin D. Piulachs M.-D. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 2005; 50: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 17Noriega F.G. Ribeiro J.M.C. Koener J.F. Valenzuela J.G. Hernandez-Martinez S. Pham V.M. Feyereisen R. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2006; 36: 366-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), stimulated the synthesis of JH by CA (Fig. 6A). Maximal stimulation of JH biosynthesis occurred at a concentration of 160 μm; therefore, this concentration was used in all subsequent experiments. Ae-AS-C reduced JH biosynthesis by MVA-stimulated CA in both sugar-fed females and blood-fed females (Fig. 6, B and C). Ae-AS-C Contents in Heads—The competitive ELISA demonstrated a linear relationship and allowed detection of Ae-AS-C at the fmol level. The quantity of AS-C in heads was determined in sugar-fed A. aegypti females; levels of Ae-AS-C were below 2 fmol in newly eclosed females, increased to a maximum of 40 fmol by 3 days after emergence, and decreased after that to a level of 6 fmol a week after emergence (Fig. 7). Classical endocrinological studies have shown that the insect CA is subject to regulation from the brain (18Engelman F. The Physiology of Insect Reproduction. Pergamon, Oxford, UK1970Google Scholar). Factors from the brain also modulate CA activity in mosquitoes; a significant reduction of JH synthesis is observed when CA are incubated with isolated brains, in medium in which brains have been maintained (preconditioned medium), or in medium with brain extract, suggesting that allatostatin-like factors are present in the mosquito brain (5Li Y.P. Hernandez-Martinez S. Noriega F.G. Reg. Peptides. 2004; 118: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Insect allatostatins can be grouped into three families: YXFGL-amide-allatostatins (cockroach or type A) (AS-A), W2W9-allatostatins (cricket or type B), and PISCF-allatostatins (type C) (AS-C) (19Bendena W.G. Donly B.C. Tobe S.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 897: 311-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 20Stay B. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 30: 653-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In recent work, we have shown that none of the five A. aegypti allatostatin-A had an effect on JH synthesis in female mosquito; on the other hand AS-C from A. gambiae showed a significant inhibitory response (5Li Y.P. Hernandez-Martinez S. Noriega F.G. Reg. Peptides. 2004; 118: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In addition, confocal laser-scanning microscopy studies using antisera against A. gambiae AS-C revealed intense immunostaining for four cells in each protocerebral lobe in the brain of adult female A. aegypti and A. albimanus (7Hernandez-Martinez S. Li Y. Rodriguez M.H. Lanz-Mendoza H. Noriega F.G. Cell Tissue Res. 2005; 321: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These findings prompted us to hypothesize that an AS-C homolog could be the brain factor involved in regulation of JH biosynthesis in A. aegypti females. Therefore, using a combination of HPLC and competitive-ELISA, we isolated and characterized an AS-C homolog from A. aegypti females. The sequence of this peptide proved to be identical to the A. gambiae PISCF-allatostatin (15Riehle M.A. Garczynski S.F. Crim J.W. Hill C.A. Brown M.R. Science. 2002; 298: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The allatotropin from A. aegypti and A. gambiae are also identical (15Riehle M.A. Garczynski S.F. Crim J.W. Hill C.A. Brown M.R. Science. 2002; 298: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 21Veenstra J.A. Costes L. Peptides. 1999; 20: 1145-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and the five AS-A are very similar in these two species (15Riehle M.A. Garczynski S.F. Crim J.W. Hill C.A. Brown M.R. Science. 2002; 298: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 22Veenstra J.A. Noriega F.G. Graf R. Feyereisen R. Peptides. 1997; 18: 937-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), confirming the high degree of conservation between regulatory peptides in members of two mosquito subfamilies that diverged more than 100 million years ago (23Knudson D.L. Brown S.E. Severson D.W. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 32: 1193-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Allatostatin-C was originally described as a JH synthesis inhibitor in the lepidopteran M. sexta (8Kramer S.J. Toschi A. Miller C.A. Kataoka H. Quistad G.B. Li J.P. Carney R.L. Schooley D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9458-9462Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The Aedes allatostatin-C first described here shares the common characteristics of all PISCF-allatostatins identified up to date in insects, which are 15 amino acids long, with a disulfide bridge between C7 and C14. M. sexta and Drosophila AS-Cs differ from each other by a single amino acid substitution: Phe for Tyr at position 4. The two mosquito peptides have an additional amino acid substitution: Ile for Val at position 2. The tree constructed based on the allatostatin peptides revealed by PSI-BLAST (Fig. 3B) clearly separates not only Lepidoptera from Diptera but also within those taxa Noctuoidea from Bombycoidea in the case of Lepidoptera and Brachycera from Nematocera in the case of Diptera. However, only the sequence of the mature peptide is significantly conserved among all the AS-C genes described in this study (Fig. 3A). The gene structure of allatostatin C is similar in D. melanogaster, A. gambiae, and A. aegypti. Single genes containing three different exons are responsible for the final preprohormone. Despite the prediction of a two exon gene in A. gambiae, the expressed sequence tags available, the manual annotation, the SNAP predictions, and the BLAST comparison with A. aegypti clearly support a three-exon gene model (supplemental Fig. SII). The fact that the two A. gambiae AST2 genes predicted by ENSEMBL are identical (supplemental Fig. SI) leads to the hypothesis that the failure of the automatic pipeline to predict correctly the gene structure is either due to an assembly-related error or due to the fact that a very recent duplication occurred in A. gambiae covering only part of the AST2 gene. The genome organization in the region, and most notably the presence of another D. melanogaster gene (CG31868) and its potential orthologs in similar distances, might be indicative of a microsynteny between these three species (supplemental Fig. SII). Very little information is available on the structural requirements of AS-C for biological activity. Reduced disulfide bridge, alanine substitution, and N-terminal deletion have been used to analyze the structure-activity relationship of M. sexta AS-C on JH biosynthesis and contractions of the foregut of larval lepidoptera Lacanobia oleracea (24Mattheu H.J. Audsley N. Weaver R.J. J. Insect Physiol. 2006; 52: 128-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 25Audley N. Weaver R.J. Edwards J.P. Peptides. 2002; 23: 717-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar); breaking the disulfide bond between C7 and C14 drastically reduced the biological activity. The presence of the C7 and C14 disulfide bond is also essential for high affinity binding of D. melanogaster AS-C to the Drosophila AS-C receptor (26Kreienkamp H.J. Larusson H.J. Witte I. Roeder T. Birgul N. Honck H.H. Harde S. Ellinghausen G. Buck F. Richter D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 42: 39937-39943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (105) Google Scholar). On the other hand M. sexta AS-C loses potency but remains fully active if the first five N-terminal amino acids are deleted, confirming that the “active cores” of many insect neuropeptides, necessary to activate the relevant receptor, reside in the C terminus of the molecule. The two amino acid substitutions described in mosquitoes are located within the first 5 N-terminal residues, corroborating that changes in this part of the molecule do not extensively affect the biological activity. Ae-AS-C modulates CA activity in A. aegypti females. There were significant reductions of JH biosynthesis rates when CA complexes from females, both before and after blood feeding, were incubated with 10–9m Ae-AS-C. There are physiological conditions when the CA is partially or completely refractory to regulation by allatostatins (27Pratt G.E. Farnsworth D.E. Feyereisen R. Mol. Cell. Endocr. 1990; 70: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We observed that the sensitivity of the isolated CA to Ae-AS-C changed during development. The CA was more sensitive at times when the levels of JH were decreasing, such as 3 days after emergence in sugar-fed females or during the first 24 h after blood feeding. These decreases in CA sensitivity to allatoregulatory peptides could be the result of lower titers of allatal receptors or to reductions in the efficiency of signal transduction mechanisms connected to key enzymes in the pathway. Similar changes in sensitivity were observed for the effect of allatotropin on the CA of A. aegypti females (6Li Y. Unnithan G.C. Veenstra J.A. Feyereisen R. Noriega F.G. J. Exp. Biol. 2003; 206: 1825-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The biochemical targets in the CA subject to AS regulation are yet unidentified, although for AS-A, they usually appear to be located early in the sesquiterpenoid pathway (29Sutherland T.D. Feyereisen R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 120: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Sutherland et al. (29Sutherland T.D. Feyereisen R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 120: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) found that cockroach AS is more effective as an inhibitor of JH synthesis in glucose- or amino acid-driven glands than in acetate-driven glands; they proposed that inhibition of JH biosynthesis by the cockroach AS-A occurs at the first committed step(s) of JH synthesis, i.e. the transfer of 2C units from mitochondria to the cytoplasm by the tricarboxylate carrier and/or the ATP-citrate lyase. Inhibition of JH biosynthesis in cockroach by AS is relieved by farnesol and by mevalonate, and neither HMG-CoA reductase nor HMG-CoA synthesis (HMG-CoA synthase and acetoacetyl-CoA lyase) are inhibited by AS-A (29Sutherland T.D. Feyereisen R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 120: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), indicating that the target for allatostatin is located before the entrance of these molecules into the synthetic pathway. However, in this study, we found that inhibition of JH biosynthesis in A. aegypti by AS-C is relieved by the addition of FA and not by MVA. A possible explanation is that AS-C partially inhibited target enzyme(s) between MVA and FA formation, although the use of exogenous mevalonate as a probe of the physiology of the CA is made difficult by the limited penetration of MVA into the gland cells (28Feyereisen R. Farnsworth D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2676-2681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We detected significant changes in the amount of Ae-AS-C in the heads of sugar-fed female mosquitoes, showing a maximum at 3 days after eclosion. These changes may be related to physiological requirements of the CA, and although the concentration of peptide in the brain itself does not reveal the amount that is released in the axon terminals of the CA, the highest value correlates with an increase in the sensitivity of the CA to inhibition by Ae-AS-C, as well as with a decrease in the CA synthetic activity. In summary, these studies demonstrate that A. aegypti PISCF-allatostatin is a true allatostatin, which shows a dose-response relationship and age-specific effects on JH synthesis. This is the first isolation and identification of an AS-C mature peptide in Diptera, as well as the first comprehensive description of an allatostatic effect of PISCF-allatostatins outside the Lepidoptera, suggesting that members of the PISCF-allatostatin family might play an important role in the regulation of JH synthesis in holometabolous insects.

https://openalex.org/W1994429028,"Vibrio vulnificus causes diseases through actions of various virulence factors, including the elastase encoded by the vvpE gene. Through transposon mutagenesis of V. vulnificus, vvpE expression was shown to be increased by luxO mutation. Since the vvpE gene is known to be positively regulated by SmcR via direct binding to the vvpE promoter, the role of LuxO in smcR expression was investigated. The luxAB-transcriptional fusions containing different lengths of the smcR promoter region indicated that the smcR transcription was negatively regulated by LuxO and that a specific upstream region of the smcR gene was required for this repression. Since LuxO is a known member of positive regulators, the negative regulation of smcR transcription by LuxO prompted us to identify the factor(s) linking LuxO and smcR transcription. LuxT was isolated in a ligand fishing experiment using the smcR upstream region as bait, and smcR expression was increased by luxT mutation. Recombinant LuxT bound to a specific upstream region of the smcR gene, -154 to -129 relative to the smcR transcription start site. The expression of luxT was positively regulated by LuxO, and the luxT promoter region contained a putative LuxO-binding site. Mutagenesis of the LuxO-binding site in the luxT promoter region resulted in a loss of transcriptional control by LuxO. Therefore, this study demonstrates a transcriptional regulatory cascade for elastase production, where LuxO activates luxT transcription and LuxT represses smcR transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1979872560,"WASP family proteins are key players for connecting multiple signaling pathways to F-actin polymerization. To dissect the highly integrated signaling pathways controlling WASP activity, we identified a Rac protein that binds to the GTPase binding domain of WASP. Using two-hybrid and FRET-based functional assays, we identified RacC as a major regulator of WASP. RacC stimulates F-actin assembly in cell-free systems in a WASP-dependent manner. A FRET-based microscopy approach showed local activation of RacC at the leading edge of chemotaxing cells. Cells overexpressing RacC exhibit a significant increase in the level of F-actin polymerization upon cAMP stimulation, which can be blocked by a phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase inhibitor. Membrane translocation of PI 3-kinase and PI 3,4,5-trisphosphate reporter is absent in racC null cells. Cells overexpressing dominant negative RacC mutants and racC null cells move at a significantly slower speed and show a poor directionality during chemotaxis. Our results suggest that RacC plays an important role in PI 3-kinase activation and WASP activation for dynamic regulation of F-actin assembly during Dictyostelium chemotaxis.

Our results suggest that RacC plays an important role in PI 3-kinase activation and WASP activation for dynamic regulation of F-actin assembly during Dictyostelium chemotaxis. Reorganization of cortical F-actin is regulated by a highly integrated signaling cascade that transduces extracellular stimuli to the actin filaments. Rho family small GTPases are known to play important roles in this signaling cascade (1Raftopoulou M. Hall A. Dev. Biol. 2004; 265: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). Although Rac and Cdc42 are known to be essential for cell movement including chemotaxis, the downstream molecules of Rho GTPases involved directly in actin filament reorganization were not clear until the WASP protein family was identified (2Derry J.M. Ochs H.D. Francke U. Cell. 1994; 78: 635-644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar, 3Symons M. Derry J.M. Karlak B. Jiang S. Lemahieu V. Mccormick F. Francke U. Abo A. Cell. 1996; 84: 723-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). These proteins have been the subject of a great deal of attention as the link between the small GTPases and the actin cytoskeleton. Recently, a broad spectrum of interactions of WASP with other proteins has been discovered, suggesting that WASP plays an important role in integrating signaling and cytoskeletal structure in cells (4Millard T.H.

In mammalian cells, the N-terminal WASP homology 1 domain of WASP binds to WASP-interacting protein (6Martinez-Quiles N. Rohatgi R. Anton I.M. Medina M. Saville S.P. Miki H. Yamaguchi H. Takenawa T.

Ho H.Y. Kirschner M.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1299-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). The proline-rich segment of WASP interacts with a number of proteins containing SH3 domains including the adaptor proteins Grb2, Nck, PST-PIP, Fyn, c-Src, Fgr, and profilin (10Takenawa T. Miki H. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1801-1809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Verprolin (V) and acidic (A) domain of WASP bind to G-actin and the Arp2/3 complex, resulting in the stimulation of nucleation of F-actin (11Rohatgi R. Ma L. Miki H. Lopez M. Kirchhausen T. Takenawa T. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). WASP has been shown to connect signaling pathways through Rac/Cdc42 to F-actin polymerization for cell movement (12Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar). In resting conditions, the VCA domain is masked by an intramolecular interaction between the VCA region and the GBD/CRIB domain. When cells are stimulated, activated Cdc42 and phosphoinositides bind to the GBD/CRIB motif and the B domain, thus exposing the VCA region (13Buck M. Xu W. Rosen M.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 271-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Through these exposed VCA regions, WASP is thought to regulate many signaling molecules including proteins involved in actin cytoskeleton organization (5Stradal T.E. Rottner K. Disanza A. Confalonieri S. Innocenti M. Scita G. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 303-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). A Dictyostelium gene encoding a protein homologous to human WASP was identified (14Myers S.A. Han J.W. Lee Y. Firtel R.A. Chung C.Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2191-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and it has been assumed that a small GTPase of Dictyostelium is involved in the activation of WASP, as in mammalian cells. However, little is known about the activating mechanisms of WASP by small GTPases during Dictyostelium chemotaxis. Thus far, at least 15 homologues of mammalian Rac have been identified in Dictyostelium (15Rivero F. Somesh B.P. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2002; 23: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It is unclear whether each of these genes has a unique function or to what extent they play redundant roles in controlling actin cytoskeletal organization including WASP-dependent pathways. Also, there is no evidence indicating which Rac protein(s) activates Dictyostelium WASP for the regulation of F-actin organization during chemotaxis. Recently, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) methods were developed to monitor the intramolecular interaction between the VCA region and GBD of N-WASP and the intermolecular interaction between N-WASP and Cdc42 (16Ward M.E. Wu J.Y. Rao Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 970-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 17Lorenz M. Yamaguchi H. Wang Y. Singer R.H. Condeelis J. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 697-703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). To identify a small GTPase responsible for the regulation of WASP activity in Dictyostelium, we developed a FRET-based functional assay with the VCA and the GBD of WASP. We have found Dictyostelium RacC as an activator of WASP, equivalent to Cdc42 in mammalian cells, and demonstrated temporal and spatial regulation of RacC activity in chemotaxing cells. We provide direct evidence that RacC can stimulate F-actin polymerization in WASP-dependent manner both in vitro and in vivo. Our results suggest that RacC is a key regulator for the activation of WASP and translocation of PI 3-kinase in the regulation of F-actin polymerization and directional motility of Dictyostelium. Cell Culture and Molecular Biology—Dictyostelium cells were cultured axenically in HL5 medium supplemented with 60 units of penicillin and 60 μg of streptomycin/ml. Dictyostelium RacC expression constructs were transformed with G418 as a selectable marker. For examining developmental phenotypes, cells were washed twice with 12 mm Na+/K+ phosphate buffer and plated on non-nutrient agar plates. The C and A domains of WASP were fused with cyan fluorescence protein (CFP), and the B-GBD domains were fused with yellow fluorescence protein (YFP) by standard approaches, and these constructs were cloned into pGEX6P-1, resulting in the form of GST fusion protein or into pEXP4(+) for the expression in cells. DNA fragments carrying the G12V or equivalent (constitutively active) of human and Dictyostelium Rho GTPases and T20N mutation of RacC were generated from wild type cDNA by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis. All products were verified by sequencing. The CFP-RacC and YFP-B-GBD were expressed under control of the actin-15 promoter using the pEXP4(+) vector. Yeast Two-hybrid Assays—Yeast two-hybrid assays were performed as described previously (18de la Roche M. Mahasneh A. Lee S.F. Rivero F. Cote G.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 238-247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protocols of the Matchmaker Two-hybrid system from Clontech were followed for all experiments dealing with two-hybrid assays. Constructs in pGAD-T7 were introduced into yeast strain Y187. Constructs in pAS2-1 or pGBK-T7 were introduced into yeast strain Y190. After mating, interactions were estimated by colony-lift β-galactosidase filter assay. FRET Assay—The GST-CFP-CA and GST-YFP-B-GBD were mixed in 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm MgCl2, and 1× Tris-buffered saline. The fluorescence intensity of emission was measured from 460 to 540 nm at 1-nm steps with the excitation wavelength at 433 nm. After Rac proteins loaded with GTPγS were added, this CFP/YFP FRET mixture, the change in YFP emission peak at 527 nm was monitored. The FRET efficiency was represented by the ratio of emission at 527 nm to that at 472 nm. For in vivo FRET, cells were imaged by using an inverted Nikon microscope with an ultrafast filter wheel (Lambda DG-4, Sutter Instruments, San Rafael, CA) and a Coolsnap HQ digital camera (Roper Scientific, Tucson, AZ). Simultaneous CFP-YFP imaging was conducted with a Dual-View Micro-Imager with CFP and YFP emission filters (Optical Insights, Santa Fe, NM). After time-lapse imaging, background-subtracted images were used to generate CFP-CFP/CFP-YFP images by using the ratio feature of Metamorph (Universal Imaging, Media, PA). GST Pulldown Assay—Aggregation-competent cells were treated with 2 mm caffeine for 20 min, collected, and resuspended at 5 × 107 cells/ml in sodium/potassium phosphate buffer containing 2 mm caffeine. Cells were stimulated with 1 μm cAMP, and 100 μl of cells were collected in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) at the indicated times. Lysates were centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 5 min in a microcentrifuge. Glutathione-agarose beads bound GST-B-GBD proteins were added to supernatant of lysates and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed 3 times in lysis buffer, suspended in sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (Roche Applied Science). The amount of RacC bound to beads was quantified by NIH image software (National Institutes of Health). Actin Polymerization Assay and F-actin Staining—For in vivo F-actin polymerization assay, F-actin was quantified from TRITC-phalloidin staining of Dictyostelium cells as described in the previous study (14Myers S.A. Han J.W. Lee Y. Firtel R.A. Chung C.Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2191-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). For in vitro F-actin polymerization with high speed supernatant (HSS), cells were pulsed with 30 nm cAMP at 6-min intervals for 5 h. Cells were diluted to 3 × 108 cells/ml and lysed by passage through a 5 μm pore size filter in 12 mm Na+/K+ buffer, pH 6.1, 1 mm MgSO4, 10 mm KCl, and 0.5 mm EGTA containing protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The low speed supernatant was made by centrifuging at 14,000 rpm for 5 min in a tabletop microcentrifuge. HSS was made from the low speed supernatant by centrifuge at 50,000 rpm for 20 min in a 50 Ti rotor (Beckman), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C until use. Purified RacC or RacB proteins charged with GTPγS or GDPβS were added to the aliquot of HSS to stimulate actin polymerization. Reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by dilution of 50-μl aliquots into 850 μlof20mm KH2PO4, 10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 3.7% formaldehyde, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.4 μm TRITC-phalloidin at indicated times. Polymerized actin was fixed and stained for 1 h and spun down at 14,000 rpm for 5 min in a microcentrifuge. Pelleted cells were extracted with 1 ml of 100% methanol, and fluorescence was measured (540ex/575em). For visual assay of F-actin polymerization in HSS, 100 μl of reaction mixtures containing HSS- and GTPγS-charged RacB or RacC were incubated on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips at room temperature for 10 min. The reaction was stopped and fixed by the addition 100 μl of 20 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 3.7% formaldehyde, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.4 μm TRITC-phalloidin. The coverslips were then mounted and viewed under a fluorescence microscope. Chemotaxis Assay—Cells competent to chemotaxis toward cAMP (aggregation-competent cells) were obtained by pulsing cells in suspension for 5 h with 30 nm cAMP. Cells were pulsed with 30 nm cAMP at 6-min intervals for 5 h and plated on glass-bottomed microwell dishes (MarTek, Inc., Ashland, MA). A micropipette filled with 100μm cAMP was positioned to stimulate cells by using a micromanipulator (Eppendorf), and the response and movement of cells were recorded by using Metamorph software (1 image per every 6 s). Cell movement was examined by tracing the movement of a single cell in a stack of images. RacC Binds to the GBD Domain of Dictyostelium WASP— To understand the signaling pathway(s) controlling WASP activity, it was imperative to identify a Rac molecule interacting with the GBD of WASP. Dictyostelium possesses at least 15 Racs in the genome. To identify a Rac protein interacting with WASP, we performed a yeast two-hybrid assay using the GBD of WASP as bait. As shown in Fig. 1A, constitutively active Dictyostelium Rac1B, RacA, RacB, and RacC showed strong interactions with the GBD of WASP, as do constitutively active human Rac1 and Cdc42. Other Rac family proteins of Dictyostelium and human RhoA exhibit significantly weaker interactions. The interactions between these four Rac proteins and the GBD of WASP were confirmed by employing an in vitro FRET assay in which Rac protein interferes with the interaction between fluorescently labeled CA and B-GBD domains of WASP. Purified GST-CFP-CA and GST-YFP-B-GBD were mixed, and the emission fluorescence intensity at 527 nm was measured with an excitation wavelength at 433 nm. YFP emission at 527 nm was observed presumably due to FRET between CFP and YFP (Fig. 1B). Upon the addition of a Rac protein that was charged with GTPγS, a change of FRET would be observed if the added Rac protein interacts with YFP-B-GBD, thus preventing interaction between CFP-CA and YFP-B-GBD. The addition of GTPγS-loaded Rac1A, Rac1B, RacA, RacE, and RacB did not cause any reduction of FRET, but RacC and human Cdc42, as a positive control, caused a significant reduction of FRET, indicating that RacC interacts with the GBD of WASP (Fig. 1C). In contrast, GDPβS-loaded RacC did not show any reduction of FRET. These results indicate that Dictyostelium RacC relieves the autoinhibitory conformation of WASP by interfering with the interaction between B-GBD and VCA domains. RacC Stimulates WASP-dependent F-actin Assembly—To show more direct evidence for the role of RacC in F-actin polymerization, we used an in vitro F-actin assembly assay with HSS of Dictyostelium cell lysates. Cell extracts that retain functional responses to signaling molecules have been used for dissecting signaling pathways for the assembly of F-actin in many systems. In the HSS of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, Dictyostelium (19Zigmond S.H. Joyce M. Borleis J. Bokoch G.M. Devreotes P.N. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and Xenopus eggs extract (20Ma L. Rohatgi R. Kirschner M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15362-15367Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), the addition of purified GTPγS-charged Cdc42 induced F-actin polymerization but not GTPγS alone. If Dictyostelium RacC is a functional counterpart to mammalian Cdc42 capable of stimulating F-actin polymerization via WASP activation, GTPγS-charged RacC is likely to stimulate F-actin assembly in HSS. When GTPγS-charged RacC was added to the HSS of wild type cells, the level of F-actin fixed and stained by TRITC-phalloidin, increased to ∼3-fold over a 6-8-min time period, whereas RacE, RacB, GDPβS-charged RacC, and GTPγS alone did not show significant stimulation (Fig. 2A). Rac1A and Rac1B showed moderate stimulatory activity presumably due to activation of dDia2 as recently reported (21Schirenbeck A. Bretschneider T. Arasada R. Schleicher M. Faix J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). These results were consistent with the formation of F-actin foci and filaments in a visual assay in which TRITC-phalloidin was added to HSS on the coverslip to allow visualization of the formation of foci by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2B). Formation of many actin foci in the HSS was stimulated by GTPγS-charged RacC. In contrast, RacB appeared to have far lower stimulatory activity on F-actin assembly than RacC. Furthermore, the addition of GTPγS-charged RacB to HSS in the presence of GTPγS-charged RacC decreased the levels of polymerized F-actin, indicating that RacB could interfere with the function of RacC in F-actin polymerization. In addition, GTPγS-charged RacC in the HSS of WASPTK cells, expressing very low level of WASP (14Myers S.A. Han J.W. Lee Y. Firtel R.A. Chung C.Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2191-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), showed no activity for the assembly of F-actin and the formation of foci (Fig. 2B), indicating that F-actin assembly in this cell-free system depends upon the activity of RacC and the presence of WASP. These results indicate that RacC stimulates F-actin polymerization via the activation of WASP. Role of RacC in F-actin Organization—In many systems, WASP regulates F-actin polymerization by activating the Arp2/3 complex, which has a capability of nucleating F-actin (4Millard T.H. Sharp S.J. Machesky L.M. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 5Stradal T.E. Rottner K. Disanza A. Confalonieri S. Innocenti M. Scita G. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 303-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, Cdc42 can bind to the GBD domain of WASP or N-WASP and stimulates WASP activity for polymerizing F-actin (11Rohatgi R. Ma L. Miki H. Lopez M. Kirchhausen T. Takenawa T. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). It has been shown that overexpression of RacC induces unusual actin-based structures in growing cells (22Seastone D.J. Lee E. Bush J. Knecht D. Cardelli J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2891-2904Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that RacC also plays an important role for F-actin organization in chemotaxing Dictyostelium cells via controlling WASP activity. To examine the role of RacC, racC null cells were created by homologous recombination, which was confirmed by Southern blot (Fig. 3A) and reverse transcription-PCR. In addition, cells expressing wild type RacC, a constitutively active RacC (RacCG15V), and a dominant negative RacC (RacCT20N) were also created. These RacC mutants were tagged with CFP protein at their N termini for FRET analysis, detection in the cell, or immunoblot analysis. We examined the organization of F-actin in aggregation-competent racC null cells and cells expressing RacCG15V or RacCT20N mutants by staining cells with TRITC-labeled phalloidin after pulsing for 5 h (Fig. 3). Wild type cells are elongated and well polarized and show localized F-actin assembly at the leading edge and sometimes to a lesser degree at the posterior cortical region of the retracting cell body. However, cells expressing RacC mutants or racC null cells were not well polarized, presumably due to unregulated F-actin assembly. Constitutively active RacCG15V cells exhibited F-actin-enriched membrane ruffles, but RacCT20N cells showed few ruffles and very low level of F-actin (Fig. 3B). racC null cells also lack polarized F-actin organization and a prominent leading edge. Although racC null cells still showed unpolarized F-actin structures in the cell, overall levels of F-actin polymerization were higher than that of RacCT20N cells. One might expect that disruption of the racC gene would decrease the number of actin nucleation sites if RacC is involved in activation of the Arp2/3 complex and nucleation of actin filaments through WASP activation. To visualize barbed-ends of F-actin, we stained RacC mutant cells with TRITC-labeled G-actin under polymerizing condition. In racC null cells, the levels of total barbed ends were lower than those of wild type, and barbed-ends in the cells were not localized, consistent with the unpolarized F-actin organization (Fig. 3C). Low numbers of barbed ends and unpolarized F-actin organization in racC null cells were rescued by expression of CFP-RacC. The barbed ends of racC null cells expressing CFP-RacC were found at the leading edge of polarized cells. Subcellular localization of RacC was examined in racC null cells expressing CFP-RacC. The majority of CFP-RacC was localized in the area of F-actin accumulation at the leading edge or newly forming pseudopodia, and minor fractions appeared to be localized on vesicles or patch-like structures in the cell (Fig. 3D). Interestingly, CFP-RacCT20N is predominantly associated with vesicles in cytoplasm. Spatial and Temporal Regulation of RacC Activity in Cells— The interaction between RacC and the GBD of WASP prompted us to examine direct interaction between RacC and the GBD by FRET in cells (Fig. 4). After careful analysis of structural information (23Abdul-Manan N. Aghazadeh B. Liu G.A. Majumdar A. Ouerfelli O. Siminovitch K.A. Rosen M.K. Nature. 1999; 399: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), we fused CFP to the N terminus of RacC and performed a FRET assay with YFP-B-GBD protein, and a mixture of the two proteins exhibited a FRET-specific peak at 527 nm (Fig. 4A). This result shows that RacC directly interacts with the GBD domain of WASP. Cells were co-transformed with constructs expressing YFP-B-GBD and CFP-RacC or -RacC mutants. We first tested FRET between YFP-B-GBD and CFP-RacC in the lysate of coexpressing cells. Fluorescence intensities of cell lysates containing YFP-B-GBD plus RacC, RacCG15V, or RacCT20N were measured with an excitation wavelength at 433 nm. As shown in Fig. 3C, cells expressing constitutively active RacCG15V exhibited a significantly higher FRET ratio, and as expected, we observed a lower FRET ratio in the lysate of cells expressing dominant-negative RacCT20N. This result indicates that the observed FRET is indeed due to the interaction between active RacC and YFP-B-GBD proteins. Upon successful observation of FRET between RacC and the GBD of WASP in vitro, we examined the activation of RacC in vivo by performing FRET analysis in living cells. To confirm that YFP-B-GBD and CFP-RacC showed an energy transfer in vivo, we determined FRET efficiency by a photobleaching experiment. Bleaching of YFP-B-GBD in cells resulted in an increase in CFP-RacC fluorescence intensity due to the lack of FRET. However, bleaching of YFP-B-GBD did not change fluorescence intensity of CFP alone. This indicates FRET between YFP-B-GBD and CFP-RacC by an interaction of GBD with RacC (Fig. 4D). By using cells coexpressing YFP-B-GBD protein and CFP-RacC, we performed an in vivo FRET assay in which the sites of binding between active RacC and B-GBD domain in living cells were visualized. Cells expressing YFP-B-GBD and CFP-RacC (Fig. 4E) were imaged for YFP and CFP simultaneously at an excitation wavelength of 433 nm with a beam splitter with two emission filters for CFP and YFP at 480 and 527 nm, respectively. These two images were used to create an YFP/CFP ratio image by which FRET efficiency was represented. We observed strong FRET signals at the leading edge in cells expressing wild type RacC (Fig. 4E), indicating that RacC is activated at the leading edge of chemotaxing cells. These cells often change directions of movement by making a new pseudopod, and strong FRET signals was observed at the newly forming leading edge, whereas the signal was very weak at the retracting pseudopod. These results suggested that RacC activity is spatially controlled and high at the leading edge, which is important for F-actin regulation at the leading edge of chemotaxing cells. To examine temporal activation of RacC upon cAMP stimulation, we performed a pulldown assay with GST-B-GBD protein and the lysate of cells expressing CFP-RacC. Only the GTP-bound form of RacC can be pulled down by GST-B-GBD. RacC-expressing cells were stimulated with cAMP and lysed at a specific time after stimulation. Lysate was incubated with GST-B-GBD beads, and bound CFP-RacC was detected by immunoblot using a GFP antibody. Activity of RacC decreased to 70-80% of unstimulated cells at 5-10 s after cAMP stimulation and increased to 150-160% at 30-45 s after stimulation (Fig. 5A).FIGURE 5A, GST pulldown assay showing the activation kinetics of RacC upon cAMP stimulation. GST-B-GBD-bound agarose beads were mixed with the lysate of CFP-RacC-expressing cells that were lysed at an indicated time after stimulation with cAMP. Bound CFP-RacC was detected by immunoblot with the anti-GFP antibody. B, in vivo F-actin polymerization responses of racC null cells upon cAMP stimulation. The F-actin content was determined by the intensity of actin band in cytoskeletal fraction on SDS-PAGE gel after Coomassie staining at the indicated times after stimulation with cAMP. The amount of F-actin was normalized relative to the F-actin level of unstimulated wild type cells (t = 0). **, statistically significant differences between means (unpaired t test, p < 0.05; n = 5). C, in vivo F-actin polymerization responses upon cAMP stimulation of wild type and RacC-expressing cells. LY294002 (20 μm) was added to RacC-expressing cells before cAMP stimulation. Each data point represents the average of three independent measurements.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Aberrant Regulation of F-actin Polymerization in RacC Mutants— To examine the regulation of F-actin in response to cAMP stimulation, racC null cells were tested for in vivo actin polymerization upon cAMP stimulation. As shown in Fig. 5B, wild type cells show a rapid and transient increase of F-actin assembly (70-90% increase) at 5-10 s after cAMP stimulation and the second peak of F-actin polymerization at 45∼60 s after cAMP stimulation as previously described (19Zigmond S.H. Joyce M. Borleis J. Bokoch G.M. Devreotes P.N. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 24Chen L. Janetopoulos C. Huang Y.E. Iijima M. Borleis J. Devreotes P.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 5028-5037Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The second peak of F-actin polymerization has been reported to be PI 3-kinase-dependent and important for Dictyostelium chemotaxis (19Zigmond S.H. Joyce M. Borleis J. Bokoch G.M. Devreotes P.N. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 24Chen L. Janetopoulos C. Huang Y.E. Iijima M. Borleis J. Devreotes P.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 5028-5037Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). racC null cells appeared to retain the first peak of F-actin polymerization, but the second peak of F-actin at 45∼60 s was absent (Fig. 5B). This suggests that RacC activity might be important for the second peak of F-actin polymerization and consistent with the peak of RacC activity at 30-45 s after cAMP stimulation. Cells overexpressing RacC appeared to have a higher level of F-actin polymerization at 5 s and have an earlier and much higher second peak at 45 s (Fig. 5C). Sometimes, we observed the increase of the"

Loss-of-function mutations in two genes, EPM2A and EPM2B are identified as genetic causes of the diseases. EPM2A encodes a dual specificity protein phosphatase (DSP) known as Laforin (2Minassian B.A. Lee J.R. Herbrick J.A. Huizenga J. Soder S. Mungall A.J. Dunham I. Gardner R. Fong C.Y. Carpenter S.

The Lafora bodies consist of 80–93% polyglucosan that is confirmed to be a long-stranded, less-branched and starch-like glycogen (6Gambetti P. Di Mauro S. Hirt L. Blume R.P.

Rev. 1999; 29: 265-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and appears to arise from undefined defect or misregulaion in the glycogen synthesis and degradation in which the Laforin could be involved. Because Laforin is expressed ubiquitously, it is likely to play a general role in cellular physiology. We have recently demonstrated that insertion-mediated mutagenesis of Epm2a leads to rapid onset of lymphoma in immune compromised mice (8Wang Y. Liu Y. Wu C. Zhang H. Zheng X. Zheng Z. Geiger T.L. Nuovo G.J. Liu Y. Zheng P. Cancer Cell. 2006; 10: 179-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Importantly, we found that Laforin is an important regulator of Wnt signaling in cancer development (8Wang Y. Liu Y. Wu C. Zhang H. Zheng X. Zheng Z. Geiger T.L. Nuovo G.J. Liu Y. Zheng P. Cancer Cell. 2006; 10: 179-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Moreover, we and others have reported that Laforin is a phosphatase that regulates the critical Ser9 phosphorylation under a variety of physiological context (9Lohi H. Ianzano L. Zhao X.C. Chan E.M.

Given the important function of GSK3β in signal transduction, understanding the biochemical mechanism of Laforin function may provide important mechanistic insights on a number of important signal transduction pathways, cellular physiology, and carcinogenesis.

Chem. 2002; 277: 2377-2380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Further studies revealed that many single substitution mutants not only in CBD but also in the DSPD are unable to bind to glycogen, and that these mutants incapable of binding to glycogen also lose or attenuate their phosphatase activity (13Fernandez-Sanchez M.E. Criado-Garcia O. Heath K.E. Garcia-Fojeda B. Medrano-Fernandez I. Gomez-Garre P. Sanz P. Serratosa J.M. Rodriguez de Cordoba S. Hum. Mol.

When expressed in yeast, Laforin interacted with itself and the Laforin mutations that inactivated its phosphatase activity prevented this interaction (13Fernandez-Sanchez M.E. Criado-Garcia O.

These data raised an intriguing possibility that Laforin function may depend on its dimerization. This requirement would offer plausible explanation for why mutations outside the phosphatase domain can have significant effect on its phosphatase activity (10Wang J. Stuckey J.A. Wishart M.J.

Here we present evidence that dimerization is critical for phosphatase activity, regulation of GSK3β phosphorylation, and Wnt signaling. Our data suggest a new dimension in explaining the pathogenesis of LD. Plasmids—Full-length cDNA of Epm2a were amplified by reverse transcription PCR using high fidelity Taq enzyme (Invitogen) from normal human tonsil and mouse spleen and cloned into vectors of pcDNA3.1-Myc/His and pcDNA4-V5/His (Invitrogen) at restriction enzyme sites of HindIII/BamHI to get fusion proteins with Myc or V5 tag fused in the C terminus of Laforin. Cloning Epm2a cDNA into pCTAP vector (Stratagene) generated a fusion protein with streptavidin-binding peptide and calmodulin-binding peptide named CBP tag fused in the C terminus of Laforin. All mutants were made by site-directed mutagenesis using the template of wild-type Epm2a. Deleted mutants of Epm2a were amplified by PCR using variant splicing transcripts (found by us) as templates and cloned sites into pcDNA vectors. Prokaryote fusion protein expression vector pGEX-6.1-P (Promega) and pET-21b (Novagen) were used to make expression plasmids of GST-Laforin and GST-C265S and Laforin-His and C265S-His, respectively. All expression plasmids were confirmed by sequencing. Transfection—Human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells were transiently transfected or cotransfected with different expression plasmids premixed with lipofectmin-2000 and cultured for 24 h in Opti-MEM medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. To achieve a similar level of protein expression between wild-type to mutant Laforin, we used 3-fold less wild type and C265 mutant plasmids than all other mutants studied. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot—Transfected HEK293 cells were lysed by a lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and cocktails of protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitor (Sigma) at 1:100 dilutions. The lysates were pre-cleared with protein G beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h and were incubated with monoclonal antibodies specific for either Myc or V5 tags under constant rotation overnight at 4 °C. The protein G beads were then added and incubated for an additional 2-h rotation at 4 °C. The beads were washed with lysis buffer three times, and phosphatase assay buffer once if the IP complex is used for phosphatase assay. The IP complex was dissociated from protein G beads by SDS-PAGE loading buffer and separated in a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. Thereafter, the proteins were transferred into nitrocellulose membrane and probed with monoclonal antibodies. The primary antibodies used in Western blot were: anti-Myc or anti-V5 (Invitrogen); anti-GSK3β, anti-p-GSK3β (Ser9), β-catenin (Cell Signaling); SP1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-mouse monoclonal His (Novagen), anti-goat polyclonal GST (Amersham Biosciences), and anti-rabbit polyclonal Laforin made by Genemed Synthesis, Inc (San Francisco, CA). The second antibodies used were: anti-mouse and-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (Cell Signaling), anti-goat-horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences). Protein Purification—Prokaryote GST-and His-fused proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 and BL21(DE3)Plys and purified by GST resin (Sigma) or nickel beads (Novagen) as described previously (10Wang J. Stuckey J.A. Wishart M.J. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2377-2380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Phosphatase Activity Assay—Phosphatase activity of Laforin was measured using para-nitrophenylphosphate (p-NPP) as described before (13Fernandez-Sanchez M.E. Criado-Garcia O. Heath K.E. Garcia-Fojeda B. Medrano-Fernandez I. Gomez-Garre P. Sanz P. Serratosa J.M. Rodriguez de Cordoba S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 3161-3171Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified recombinant protein (10 ng to 1 μg or 30 μl of 1:500 diluted slurry of fusion Laforin immobilized on beads) was incubated with 10 mm p-NPP at 37 °C for 30 min in a total volume of 100 μl of buffer (50 mm Hepes pH 6.0, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The reaction supernatant was terminated by 10 μl of 1 m NaOH. The converted products were measured by absorbance at 410 nm, and a molar extinction coefficient of 1.78 × 104 was used to calculate the phosphatase activity. When bead-bound enzymes were used, the amounts of enzymes in each reaction was determined by SDS-PAGE after the proteins were released by boiling with reducing SDS buffer, using BSA as standard. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and the intensity of scanned bands of targets, and bovine serum albumin was determined using SigmaPlot. Sucrose Gradient Ultracentrifugation—Cell lysates were fractionated by sucrose gradient ultracentrifuge as described (14Roche P.A. Marks M.S. Cresswell P. Nature. 1991; 354: 392-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Wild type and W32D mutant V5 were transiently transfected into HEK293. 24-h later, the cells were lysed, and the lysates were laid on the top of a 5–20% sucrose gradient and separated by ultracentrifugation using SW50.1 and at a speed of 35,000 rpm for 20 h. The 200-μl fractions were collected, and the amounts and molecular weight of the Laforin-V5 is measured by Western blot using anti-V5 mAb. Gel Filtration—Lysates from 2 liters of BL21 culture were applied to a nickel column. The Laforin-His proteins were eluted with imidazole (250 mm). The eluted proteins were separated by a Sephacryl S-300 High Resolution gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with running buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl and 150 mm NaCl) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min and collected in 1.5-ml fractions. Protein contents were monitored by the absorbance of 280 nm. Molecular weight (MW) markers from Amersham Biosciences were used to determine MW distribution in the eluate. The fractions from each peak were collected and the proteins were re-isolated using the His beads and suspended in the phosphatase buffer to measure the phosphatase activity. Laforin Forms SDS-resistant Dimers in Mammalian Cells—Our previous studies indicated that Laforin is expressed at very low levels in hematopoietic malignant cells (8Wang Y. Liu Y. Wu C. Zhang H. Zheng X. Zheng Z. Geiger T.L. Nuovo G.J. Liu Y. Zheng P. Cancer Cell. 2006; 10: 179-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), although some non-hematopoietic tumor cells, such as breast cancer cell line 4T1, express significant levels. Interestingly, under the non-reducing SDS-PAGE that involved no DTT and no boiling of samples, the major band that reacted with anti-Laforin antibody is ∼80 kDa, although a smaller amount of the 57-kDa species is also found. With reduction and boiling prior to SDS-PAGE, a major portion of the 80-kDa band was converted into a new 40-kDa band (Fig. 1A). Whereas the abundance of the 57-kDa band was also increased with reduction, this band was not found in most of cell lines tested by the anti-Laforin antibody (data not shown), we therefore consider that the 57-kDa band to be either post-translationally modified form of the Laforin or nonspecific. The conversion from 80 to 40 kDa by reduction has been observed in another mouse mammary tumor cell line TSA (data not shown). This result raised the intriguing possibility that the 80-kDa band may be a dimeric form of the 40-kDa band. To confirm this possibility, we expressed recombinant Laforin with V5 tag at its C terminus in 293 cells. The expressed proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-V5 antibody. The immunoprecipitates were treated with DTT and SDS and boiled prior to Western blot. As shown in Fig. 1B, even after these treatments, a significant amount of Laforin-V5 dimer was detected. An aliquot of immunoprecipitates was used to measure the phosphatase activity using the generic phosphatase substrate, p-NPP. The Laforin-V5 precipitates had very high phosphatase activity. As expected, mutation at the phosphatase active site C265S completely abrogated the phosphatase activity. Because this mutant still formed dimer under the same condition, it is likely that Laforin dimerization does not require its phosphatase activity. To further substantiate the notion that Laforin form dimers in mammalian cells, we fused mouse (mL) or human (hL) Laforin with different tags in the C terminus. Two cDNAs were cotransfected into the 293 cells. The cell lysates from the transfectants were precipitated with anti-V5 antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were further analyzed by a reducing SDS-PAGE after treatment with DTT and boiling. Western blot with antibodies specific for different tags provided two lines of evidence to support dimerization of Laforin. First, in addition to the monomeric form, dimeric forms of hL and mL could be observed at high quantity regardless of the combination used. The slight shifts in molecular weight were consistent with the notion that mouse and human Laforin can form both homodimers and/or heterodimers. Second, the anti-V5 antibody pulled-down substantial amounts of CBP-tagged (Fig. 2, middle panel) and Myc-tagged (right panel) Laforin of both mouse and human origins. Taken together, data presented in this section indicate that Laforin can form dimers that are substantially resistant to boiling under reducing condition in the presence of SDS. Structural Functional Analysis Revealed a Critical Role of Dimerization in Phosphatase Activity—We took two approaches to determine whether dimerization of Laforin is essential. First, we deleted different portions of Laforin and determined the regions required for homodimerization. All deletion mutants were fused with either Myc or V5 tag at their C terminus. The same mutants with different tags were cotransfected into the 293 cells. The cell lysates were precipitated with anti-V5 and blotted with anti-Myc to reveal homodimerization. As shown in Fig. 3A, 5 deletion mutants were produced, each losing part of the amino acids encoded by exons 1–3. While full-length Laforin homodimerized readily, deletion of amino acids encoded by the entire exon 1 or part of it (deletion from amino acid residues 13–65) completely abrogated homodimerization (Fig. 3B). Thus, exon 1-encoded amino acids are critical for homodimerization. Although deletion of exons 2 and 3 or a large fragment spanning residues encoded by part of exon 2, the entire exon 3 and a small portion of exon 4 (named as dL2p3) did not completely abrogate homodimerization, a substantial reduction was also observed (Fig. 3B). It is therefore likely that multiple regions in Laforin are involved in homodimerization. Consistent to the lost dimerization, none of the deleted forms had significant phosphatase activities (Fig. 3C). A number of natural mutations have been described in the EPM2a gene (3Ganesh S. Agarwala K.L. Ueda K. Akagi T. Shoda K. Usui T. Hashikawa T. Osada H. Delgado-Escueta A.V. Yamakawa K. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2251-2261Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 12Ianzano L. Young E.J. Zhao X.C. Chan E.M. Rodriguez M.T. Torrado M.V. Scherer S.W. Minassian B.A. Hum. Mutat. 2004; 23: 170-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Because these mutations abrogated the physiological function of Laforin, we tested whether these mutations inactivated dimerization and/or phosphatase activity by introducing the individual mutation into the Epm2a cDNA (Fig. 4A). The wild-type and mutant Laforins were fused with Myc or V5 tag at their C terminus, and the Myc and V5 plasmids of each were co-transfected into the 293 cells, and the association between Myc and V5 of each were detected by IP-Western blot. As shown in Fig. 4B, despite comparable expression, substantial reductions of dimerization were observed in all three exon 1 mutants, and the mutants in exons 3 and 4. Two mutants of F83L in exon 1 and Q292L in exon 4 showed the lowest ability to dimerize. Quantitative analysis demonstrated that mutants F83L and Q292L reduced dimerization by more than 90% (data not shown), while other mutants tested reduced dimerization by 80%. The phosphatase dead mutant (C265S) retained its ability to dimerize, which supports our contention that dimerization does not require phosphatase activity. Importantly, for all other mutants, the impact of the mutations on Laforin dimerization was matched with that on phosphatase activity (Fig. 4C). These data are consistent with the notion that dimerization may contribute to its phosphatase activity. Differential Sedimentation of Wild-type and Mutant Laforin—To determine whether a mutation in the CBD domain affects molecular association of Laforin, we lysed 293 cells that were transfected with either the wild-type or the W32D mutant of Epm2a with 1% Triton X-100. The lysates were then overlaid into a sucrose gradient of 5–20%, and separated by a 24-hour ultracentrifugation. The fractions collected were analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot to determine sedimentation profiles of Laforin. As shown in Fig. 5, the majority of the wild-type Laforin sedimented toward maximal sucrose density, while the W32D mutant had a broad distribution from low to high sucrose density regions. These results demonstrate that the W32D mutation of Laforin affect the molecular association of Laforin. In addition to an overall sedimentation profile, we also observed a substantial difference in the WT and W32D mutant of Laforin in terms of their homodimerization, after they were treated with SDS under nonreducing condition. In fractions from WT transfectants, higher % of Laforin homodimers were found toward the higher density end. These data indicated that stable homodimers were possibly associated with additional molecules in vivo. Although the overall trends held for the W32D mutant, there was a substantial reduction in the amount of SDS-resistant homodimers. For instance, at the middle layer (1.2–1.4 ml), 85% of wild-type Laforin migrated as dimers. In contrast, less than 25% of the mutant migrated as dimers. The residual dimers found in the W32D mutant may explain the reduced but detectable phosphatase activity of the mutant (Fig. 4C). Essentially All Enzymatic Activity of the Recombinant Laforin Produced in Bacteria Is Attributable to Dimers—Consistent with the published data (10Wang J. Stuckey J.A. Wishart M.J. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2377-2380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), we found that the recombinant soluble Laforin produced in bacteria had detectable but low phosphatase activity. This was due to difficulties in eluting dimers from the nickel columns (supplemental Fig. S1) and that high concentration of imidazole used for elution irreversibly inhibited Laforin activity (data not shown). Moreover, we observed that tagging Laforin at the N terminus eliminated the dimer formation and drastically reduced phosphatase activity (Fig. S1). The position of the Tag in different studies may explain the difference in both activity and specificity of Laforin reported by different groups (8Wang Y. Liu Y. Wu C. Zhang H. Zheng X. Zheng Z. Geiger T.L. Nuovo G.J. Liu Y. Zheng P. Cancer Cell. 2006; 10: 179-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 9Lohi H. Ianzano L. Zhao X.C. Chan E.M. Turnbull J. Scherer S.W. Ackerley C.A. Minassian B.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 2727-2736Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 15Worby C.A. Gentry M.S. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30412-30418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). To determine whether the phosphatase activity of Laforin-His in the solution is contributed by the dimers, the recombinant proteins were separated by gel filtration. As shown in Fig. 6A, two species of His-tagged Laforin proteins were detected, with their sizes consistent with monomeric (major) and dimeric (minor) Laforin. The fractions within each peak were then pooled and re-precipitated with nickel beads and assayed for phosphatase activity. As shown in Fig. 6B, only dimeric forms were active. These data demonstrated that dimerization is essential for the phosphatase activity of recombinant Laforin expressed in bacteria. Requirement for Dimerization for Laforin-mediated Regulation of GSK3β Phosphorylation and Wnt Signaling—We have recently demonstrated that Laforin is an important regulator of GSK3β activity as it specifically dephosphorylates GSK3β at the critical Ser9 residue. To determine whether dimerization is required for this important cellular function, we compared wild-type and mutant Laforin for their ability to regulate GSK3β phosphorylation at the Ser9 residue induced by insulin. As shown in Fig. 7A, treatment of insulin induced a robust phosphorylation of GSK3β at the Ser9 position. This induction was completely abrogated by wild-type Laforin. Interestingly, all of the mutants tested lost this function regardless of whether they reside within the phosphatase domain. Since all of the naturally occurred mutations that impaired dimerization also lost the ability to regulate GSK3β phosphorylation at Ser9, we conclude that dimerization is critical for regulation of GSK3β by Laforin. We have also established that Laforin regulates Wnt signaling during cancer development. We therefore evaluated whether the function of Laforin in Wnt signaling also requires dimerization by comparing the activity of the wild type and the mutants. As shown in Fig. 7B, transfection of wild-type Laforin prevented Wnt-induced β-catenin translocation in the nuclei. In contrast, the mutants that failed to form dimers did not suppress Wnt signaling. Thus, dimerization is likely important for Laforin-mediated regulation of Wnt signaling. Laforin is a dual-specific phosphatase, which is mutated in patients with epilepsy of progressive myoclonus. The mutation not only occurred in the DSPD, but also in the CBD. Recent work by Wang et al. (10Wang J. Stuckey J.A. Wishart M.J. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2377-2380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) established that the domain is involved in glycogen binding, although interaction with other types of carbohydrate has also been suggested. Interesting, although reports from different groups vary in the extent of impact (10Wang J. Stuckey J.A. Wishart M.J. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2377-2380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 13Fernandez-Sanchez M.E. Criado-Garcia O. Heath K.E. Garcia-Fojeda B. Medrano-Fernandez I. Gomez-Garre P. Sanz P. Serratosa J.M. Rodriguez de Cordoba S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 3161-3171Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), all studies demonstrate a significant effect of the CBD mutations in the phosphatase activity using generic phosphatase substrates. Here we showed that Laforin naturally form stable dimers that are at least partially resist SDS treatment under boiling and reducing conditions. Moreover, structural functional analyses of Laforin support a critical role of dimerization in its phosphatase activity, regulation of GSK3β activity and Wnt signaling, although dimerization does not require phosphatase activity. Our conclusion is based on several lines of evidence. First, Laforin found in cultured cell lines were SDS-resistant dimers. While reduction and boiling converted some of the dimers into monomers, this conversion is never complete in our experience. Thus, the force responsible for dimerization was at least in part independent of the disulfate bond. Using Laforin tagged at its C terminus, we observed SDS-resistant dimers of Laforin formed in both bacterial and mammalian cells. The existence of the Laforin dimer in untransfected cells reveals that dimerization is not an artifact of overexpression. Second, deletional analysis revealed that a large area of the Laforin protein is involved in dimerization. Deletion of the CBD domain completely abrogated dimerization. An interesting issue is whether the binding to glycogen is involved in dimerization. We believe this is less likely as recombinant protein produced in bacteria, which lack glycogen, also dimerize. In addition, deletion of exon 2 and/or 3 encoded region, which has not been implicated in glycogen binding, also caused a substantial reduction in dimerization. The involvement of a large area is further substantiated by the fact that naturally occurring mutations in exons 1 and 4 can cause substantial reduction of Laforin dimerization. The involvement of large area may explain the stability of the dimers. Third, dimerization is critical for the enzymatic activity of Laforin. We have demonstrated that deletions or naturally occurring mutations that abrogate dimerization of Laforin inactivate the phosphatase. Likewise, GST-tagged Laforin at N terminus also prevented dimerization and abrogated the phosphatase activity (supplemental Fig. S1). Furthermore, gel filtration confirmed that the dimer, but not the monomer, of recombinant protein produced from bacteria has phosphatase activity. Sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation defined that the impaired dimerization of the W32D mutant at exon 1 corresponds to the reduction of its phosphatase activity. However, it should be noted that enzymatic activity is not required for dimerization, as C265S mutated at the critical residue for enzymatic activity completely inactivated the phosphatase but did not affect dimerization. Fourth, dimerization of Laforin is not only required for its generic phosphatase activity, but also essential for its regulation of GSK3β and Wnt signaling, two important functions recently attributed to Laforin (8Wang Y. Liu Y. Wu C. Zhang H. Zheng X. Zheng Z. Geiger T.L. Nuovo G.J. Liu Y. Zheng P. Cancer Cell. 2006; 10: 179-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 9Lohi H. Ianzano L.

Thus, while WT Laforin suppressed insulin-induced GSK3β phosphorylation the Ser9 at position, all mutants that lost the ability to form dimers were unable to dephosphorylate GSK3β. Likewise, three dimerization-defective mutants tested also failed to suppress Wnt-induced accumulation of β-catenin in the nuclei. These data further strengthen the importance of dimerization in Laforin function in vivo. While the structural requirements for GSK3β dephosphorylation at Ser9 and suppression of Wnt signaling are similar, it is premature to conclude that Laforin regulate Wnt signaling by modulating GSK3β phosphorylation at the Ser9 position. Recent studies indicated that mice with mutant GSK3β Ser9 → Ala GSK3α Ser21 → Ala mutations have normal development (16McManus E.J. Sakamoto K. Armit L.J. Ronaldson L. Shpiro N. Marquez R. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1571-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), which suggests that Wnt signaling is not regulated by phosphorylation at these residues. Moreover, MEF prepared from the mutant mice had normal response to Wnt in vitro. This apparent inconsistency can be reconciled either by postulating other potential phosphorylation sites on GSK that regulate Wnt signaling or alternatively by suggesting that Laforin regulates Wnt signaling by GSK-independent mechanisms. Regardless of what the ultimate mechanisms are, the fact that naturally occurring mutation of Laforin abrogates their ability to regulate GSK and Wnt signaling suggested a new dimension in explaining the pathogenesis of Lafora's diseases. Taken together, our data provide a clear-cut example on the significance of dimerization in function of an important protein phosphatase. Our data extend the growing body of evidence on the role for dimerization in phosphatase activity and regulation (17Berger P. Schaffitzel C. Berger I. Ban N. Suter U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Because essentially all of the naturally occurred mutations abrogate dimerization of Laforin, dimerization defect may be an essential pathway for the molecular defects in the Lafora diseases.

The histidine biosynthetic pathway serves as a model system for better understanding of the fundamental metabolic, physiological, and genetic processes in bacteria (1Winkler M.E. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. ASM Press, 1996: 485-505Google Scholar). This pathway is identical in both Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium and has been thoroughly characterized (1Winkler M.E. Neidhardt F.C.

Biol. 1988; 203: 585-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), whereas in archaea, eukarya, and most bacteria they are encoded by two separate genes (3Brilli M. Fani R. J. Mol. Evol. 2004; 58: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The bifunctional HisB enzyme has been proposed to be the result of a fusion of two independent cistrons that occurred recently in evolution (3Brilli M. Fani R. J. Mol. Evol. 2004; 58: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Biochemical and genetic studies of the HisB enzyme together suggest that both of its enzymatic activities are independent of one another and reside in separate domains (6Loper J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1961; 47: 1440-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 8Chumley F.G. Roth J.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 145: 697-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The HPase activity is found within the N-terminal domain (residues 1-167, HisB-N), whereas the C-terminal domain (residues 168-356) exhibits the IGPD activity. The phosphatase activity requires the presence of metal ions such as Mg2+, Mn2+, Co2+, or Zn2+ but is inhibited by calcium (9Houston L.L. Graham M.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1974; 162: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Based on the presence of four invariant aspartic acid residues, HisB has been classified as a member of the haloacid dehalogenase-like hydrolase (HAD) family within the “DDDD” superfamily of aspartyl-phosphate utilizing phosphohydrolases/phosphotransferases (10Thaller M.C. Schippa S. Rossolini G.M. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1647-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 11Aravind L. Galperin M.Y. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 127-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The phosphoryl transfer catalyzed by phosphotransferases and phosphatases from the HAD family occurs via a phosphoaspartate intermediate and involves one metal ion (12Allen K.N. Dunaway-Mariano D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 495-503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In the first half-reaction the catalytic aspartate (first in the conserved DXDX(T/V) motif I) aided by the metal ion attacks the phosphorus leading to cleavage of the substrate phosphoester bond, formation of a phosphoaspartate intermediate, and the release of product. The second aspartate plays the role of general acid to protonate the leaving group (13Collet J.F. Stroobant V. Pirard M. Delpierre G. Van S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14107-14112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). A conserved Ser/Thr present in motif II is involved in binding the phosphoryl group. The consensus sequence (G/S)DXX(N/T)D comprises motif III in which the first aspartate is involved in metal coordination while the second aspartate in involved in orienting a lysine residue that in turn interacts with the phosphoryl group. In the second half-reaction, a water molecule activated by a general base (second aspartate of motif I) attacks the phosphoaspartate intermediate regenerating the active site aspartate and releasing inorganic phosphate. The other members of the DDDD superfamily include nonspecific phosphatases, phosphoglycolate phosphatases, phosphoserine phosphatases, and trehalose-6-phosphatases (3Brilli M. Fani R. J. Mol. Evol. 2004; 58: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Several enzymes belonging to the HAD family have been structurally and enzymatically characterized, including phosphoserine phosphatase from Methanococcus jannaschii (14Wang W. Kim R. Jancarik J. Yokota H. Kim S.H. Structure. 2001; 9: 65-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), class B acid phosphatase from E. coli (15Calderone V. Forleo C. Benvenuti M.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8579-8589Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Interestingly, some bacteria utilize an unrelated enzyme to catalyze the same histidinol phosphate phosphatase reaction. Unlike E. coli HisB, this enzyme is monofunctional and belongs to the polymerase and histidinol phosphatase superfamily characterized by the presence of four conserved motifs, each containing a histidine residue (20Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 469-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Members of the polymerase and histidinol phosphatase superfamily (e.g. HisB from Thermus thermophilus HB8 (21Omi R. Goto M. Nakagawa N. Miyahara I. Hirotsu K. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 574-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar)) are structurally unrelated to the HAD family enzymes and employ a different catalytic mechanism. The enzymes involved in the histidine biosynthesis pathway have recently been the subjects of intense structural investigation with crystal structures of all the E. coli enzymes (or their close orthologs) having been determined, with the exception of HPase (HisB-N). Here we report the crystal structures of E. coli HisB-N and several enzyme-ligand complexes. Based on these structures and the accompanying biochemical data we propose a novel mechanism for the dephosphorylation of histidinol phosphate mediated by two Mg2+ ions. This proposed mechanism is distinct from that previously reported for other HAD family enzymes, where only one Mg2+ ion is required for catalysis. We also show that in the presence of Ca2+ the reaction is arrested following the formation of the phosphoaspartate intermediate. Cloning, Mutagenesis, and Purification—The N-terminal domain of HisB (residues 3-166, gi: 12516203) from E. coli O157:H7 (22Perna N.T. Plunkett G.I. Blattner F.R. Mau B. Blattner F.R. Nature. 2001; 409: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar) was cloned into a modified pET15b vector (EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA), yielding a fusion protein with an N-terminal extension MGSS(H)6GS- and expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3). Site-directed mutagenesis of HisB-N (Asp12 → Ala, Asp12 → Ser, Glu18 → Ala, and Glu18 → Ser) was performed using the QuikChange™ kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Mutants were verified by DNA sequence analysis and ESI-MS of purified mutant proteins. A 1-liter culture was grown in LB medium containing 100 μg ml-1 ampicillin for 2 h at room temperature, protein expression was induced with 100 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and the culture was incubated for an additional 6 h. Cell pellets were resuspended in 40 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm imidazole, 400 mm NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics, Laval, Canada) and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100) and sonicated on ice for a total of 2 min with cycles of 15 s on and 15 s off. The lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was incubated with DEAE-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with the lysis buffer. The flow-through was loaded on a 1-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), washed with buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 400 mm NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 40 mm imidazole) and eluted with buffer containing 200 mm imidazole. The protein buffer was exchanged to 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 5 mm dithiothreitol and concentrated by ultrafiltration to 20 mg ml-1. The molecular mass measured by ESI-MS showed that the N-terminal methionine had been removed. Dynamic light scattering measurements were performed using a DynaPro plate reader (Protein Solutions, Charlottesville, VA) at room temperature. Molecular weight was also estimated by size-exclusion chromatography on a Sephadex G-75 HR10/30 column. One-dimensional 1H NMR spectra for mutant and wild-type enzymes were recorded on a Bruker DXR 500-MHz spectrometer and compared with wild-type enzyme to ensure proper folding of the mutant protein. Crystallization—HisB-N was screened using Hampton solutions (Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, CA). Optimization of initial hits led to two conditions producing well diffracting crystals: (a) 25% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.2 m MgCl2 and 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) by the sitting drop vapor diffusion, and (b) 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether, 0.05 m CaCl2, and 0.1 m Bis-Tris (pH 6.5) by the micro-batch method. Both conditions led to isomorphous crystals, space group C2221 with cell dimensions a = 53.5, b = 132.6, and c = 107.3 Å (Z = 16) and a Vm of 2.3 Å3 Da-1 with 47% solvent content (23Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7922) Google Scholar). For structure determination a native crystal grown in the presence of MgCl2 was soaked for 1 min in 1 m NaBr and flashcooled in the N2 cold stream (Oxford Cryosystem, Oxford, UK). We refer to these crystals as HisB-N·Mg. The crystals obtained from condition b are referred to as HisB-N·Ca. We next soaked crystals obtained from condition a in 50 mm histidinol phosphate for 4 h or 50 mm histidinol (product) for 16 h. In both cases only histidinol was observed in the electron density map (HisB-N·Mg/histidinol). Soaking a crystal grown in condition b in 50 mm histidinol phosphate for 20 min resulted in the phosphoaspartate complex (HisB-N·Ca/pAsp), and the crystals from a were soaked in 0.2 m MgSO4 for 16 h (HisB-N·Mg/sulfate). Data Collection and Refinement—Data collection for the Br- SAD experiment was carried out at a wavelength of 0.9202 Å, and the remaining data were collected at a wavelength of 1.1 Å using a Quantum-4 charge-coupled device detector (Area Detector Systems Corp., San Diego, CA), at the X8C beamline, National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory. Data processing and scaling were performed with HKL2000 (24Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). The seven-site Br- substructure was determined with SHELXD (25Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar), and phases were derived with SHELXE (26Sheldrick G.M. Z. Kristallogr. 2002; 217: 644-650Crossref Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Solvent flattening with RESOLVE (27Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar) led to phases with a figure-of-merit of 0.81. ARP/wARP (28Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2564) Google Scholar) automatically built 95% of the expected residues. The model was completed manually using XtalView (29McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar) and refined at 1.7-Å resolution with REFMAC5 (30Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar) using all reflections. Difference electron density maps showed the presence of ions in various datasets, and they were modeled as Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Br-, or Zn2+ according to the observed geometry, coordinating atoms, composition of the mother liquor, and refined B-factors. There are two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The final model of HisB-N·Mg contains residues 3-19, 22-116, and 120-164 for subunit A, 4-116 and 120-166 for subunit B, and 440 water molecules. The final Rwork was 0.187, and Rfree was 0.215 (Table 1). The model has good stereochemistry as analyzed with PROCHECK (31Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl.

Open table in a new tab Other structures were isomorphous to the native crystals and were refined, starting from the HisB-N·Mg model, at resolutions ranging from 1.75 to 2.2 Å. The metal ions were modeled based on the content of the mother liquor. The Rwork was ∼0.18 and Rfree was ∼0.22 (Table 1). Residues 19-22 and 117-120 were less well defined in the electron density maps and were modeled only in some molecules. The N-terminal His tag was disordered in all crystals. HPase Assay and Steady-state Kinetics—The HPase assay was carried out as described (32Ames B.N. Garry B. Herzenberg L.A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1960; 22: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) with release of inorganic phosphate detected as a malachite green·phosphomolybdate complex (33Van Veldhoven P.P. Mannaerts G.P. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Each 100-μl reaction mixture contained 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 70 nm enzyme, 25 μm Mg2+, and 200 μm histidinol phosphate. After 15-min incubation at room temperature the reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 μl of molybdate reagent (1.75% (w/v) ammonium heptamolybdate in 6.3 n sulfuric acid). A volume of 20 μl of 0.035% (w/v) malachite green in 0.35% (w/v) polyvinyl alcohol (Mr 14000) in water was added after a 10-min incubation for color development. The absorbance of the malachite green·phosphate complex was recorded at 610 nm after 30 min. A molar absorption coefficient of 110,620 m-1 was used to determine the concentration of phosphate released. Values for Km and kcat were derived through non-linear regression analysis of the Michaelis-Menten equation using duplicate measurements. Eleven different substrate concentrations (10-110 μm) were used for each set of experiments. A reaction time course was also monitored by incubating 10 μm enzyme (native and mutants) with 2-4 mm histidinol phosphate and 5 mm MgCl2/CaCl2.3-μl aliquots were withdrawn at various time points for phosphate estimation. Mass Spectrometric Analysis—Formation of the phosphoaspartate intermediate of HisB-N was followed by ESI-MS using an Agilent 1100 Series LC/MSD (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). A 50-μl reaction mixture containing 1 mm histidinol phosphate, 5 mm MgCl2 or CaCl2, and 50 μm HisB-N was incubated at 21 °C for 30 min. A 2-μl aliquot of the reaction mixture was injected directly at 5-min intervals, and the appearance of the phosphoaspartate enzyme adduct was monitored in the positive mode using isocratic conditions of 30% (v/v) acetonitrile containing 0.1% (v/v) formic acid. Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure Measurements—The extended x-ray absorption fine structure spectra for HisB-N were collected at beamline X9B at the National Synchrotron Light Source using a double crystal silicon (111) monochromator. High order harmonics were suppressed (<0.1%) by a nickelcoated reflecting mirror. Data were collected in fluorescent mode using a 13-element Ge array detector (Canberra). All measurements were made with the HisB-N samples in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.2 m NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 5 mm dithiothreitol at a protein concentration of 20 mg ml-1 in an He-displex cryostat operating at 20 K. Several scans of 40-60 min each were collected and summed together. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—ITC measurements were carried out on a MicroCal VP-ITC titration calorimeter (MicroCal, Inc., Northampton, MA) using the VPViewer software for data acquisition and instrument control. Chelex-treated buffer solution (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0) was used for the metal binding studies, and stocks of metal solutions were prepared using the same buffer. Protein samples treated with 5 mm EDTA for 30 min were chromatographed on a Superose-12 16/60 column with Chelex-treated buffer to remove any bound metal ions. All solutions were degassed prior to the experiment. In a typical experiment HisB-N at a concentration of 260 μm was added to the reaction cell, maintained at 20 °C, and stirred at a constant rate of 260 rpm to ensure rapid mixing. A solution of 5 mm MgCl2 or CaCl2 was loaded into a 300-μl syringe, and 45 injections of 6 μl each were added to the protein sample in 5-min intervals. Data were analyzed using the MicroCal ORIGIN (version 7.0) software provided by the manufacturer. The thermodynamic values Kd, ΔSo, and ΔHo for a two-site model were obtained by non-linear curve fitting. Molecular Structure—The two HisB-N monomers in the asymmetric unit can be superposed with a root mean square deviation of ∼0.35 Å for 155 Cα atoms, indicating that no significant conformational differences exist between them. Each monomer has approximate dimensions of 47 × 34 × 26 Å3 and constitutes a single domain containing a Rossmann fold (Fig. 1a). The central part of the monomer is formed by a five-stranded parallel β-sheet (β5-β4-β1-β2-β3) flanked on one side by three α-helices nearly parallel to the β-strands and on the other side by one α-helix and a random coil region resembling a distorted helix (between β3 and β4) (Fig. 1a). A long Ω loop (Asp12-Glu34) spans strand β1 and helix α1 and narrows at the ends due to hydrogen bonds between two short β-strands (β1a: Leu15-Ser17 and β1b: Ala32-Glu34). The crystal structure together with dynamic light scattering and size-exclusion chromatography indicate a dimeric organization of HisB-N (Fig. 1b). The monomers pack back-to-back via helix α1 (residues Phe28-Leu42) and helix α2 (Leu76-Gln84) to form the dimer with dimensions of ∼47 × 68 × 26 Å3. Dimerization mainly involves hydrophobic interactions, with only eight direct hydrogen bonds. Water-mediated hydrogen bonds are observed at the periphery of the dimer interface. The total surface area buried upon dimer formation is ∼1250 Å2 corresponding to ∼8% of the monomer surface. The substrate-binding site is located on the protein side opposite to the dimerization interface. Metal Binding Sites—Difference electron density maps calculated from datasets collected for various HisB-N crystals showed the presence of two or three strong peaks (>8σ) near each molecule. Based on the presence of Ca2+, Mg2+, or both Mg2+ and Na+ as well as the observed ligand coordination, these sites were modeled as metal ions (Fig. 1). Zinc Binding Site—The Zn2+ ion is present in all HisB-N molecules. Its presence was confirmed by extended x-ray absorption fine structure analysis, which showed strong absorption at the K edge of zinc (9668 eV, data not shown). This site is situated within the loop following strand β5. The side chains of Cys94, His96, Cys102, and Cys104 tetrahedrally coordinate the Zn2+. The average Zn2+ distance to the cysteine thiol groups is 2.3 Å and to ND1His-96 is 2.1 Å (Fig. 1a). The temperature factor for this Zn2+,(∼16 Å2), is similar to the average B-factor of the surrounding protein atoms. Since Zn2+ was not part of the crystallization conditions, its presence in the crystal structure indicates that HisB-N acquired Zn2+ during expression in E. coli and that this metal is required for maintaining the structural integrity of the protein. The Zn2+ site is ∼14 Å away from the catalytic Asp10. Metal Site 1—HisB-N·Mg crystals show a metal-binding site near the active site Asp10 coordinated by six O atoms with octahedral geometry (Fig. 2a). The average metal-O distance of 2.1 Å confirms the presence of Mg2+. This site is common to both monomers and is situated above strands β1 and β4. The Mg2+ is coordinated by the side-chain oxygens Oδ2Asp-10 and Oδ1Asp-131, the main-chain oxygen OAsp-12, and three water molecules. In crystals of HisB-N·Ca grown in the presence of 50 mm CaCl2, this site is occupied by a Ca2+ and is coordinated by the same residues as described for the Mg2+ site, except that the average Ca2+-O distance is 2.35 Å.FIGURE 2a, the omit Fo - Fc electron density map for HisB-N·Mg contoured at 3σ. The residues depicted were excluded from the phase calculation. Mg2+ occupies site 1 and Na+ occupies site 2; b, the omit Fo - Fc electron density map for HisB-N·Mg/sulfate contoured at 3σ. The depicted residues were excluded from phase calculation. Mg2+ occupies site 1, water W2 occupies site 2, a hexa-hydrated Mg2+ ion is near the protein surface; c, hydrogen bonding interactions within the active site of HisB-N. The HisB-N forms a complex with histidinol. Site 1 is occupied by Mg2+, and site 2 by the amino group of histidinol with its hydroxyl group occupying the position of water W1; d, the HisB-N·phosphoaspartate intermediate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Metal Site 2—In the HisB-N·Ca/pAsp complex there is a second metal ion with octahedral coordination (in molecule B only) ∼6 Å away from site 1. This site is located between strands β2 and β4. The metal ion is coordinated by Oδ2Asp-12, OPhe-23, and four water molecules. The average ion-O distance is 2.35 Å, indicative of Ca2+. This site is also occupied in the crystal of HisB-N·Mg soaked briefly in 1 m NaBr. In this case, the OE2Glu-18 atom replaces one of the water molecules in the coordination sphere (Fig. 2a) with an average ion-oxygen distance of 2.45 Å, substantially longer than that expected for Mg2+-O but in accordance with the distance expected for Na+-O coordination. In crystals grown from CaCl2 (HisB-N·Ca) or soaked with MgSO4 (HisB-N·Mg/sulfate) a tetrahedrally coordinated water molecule occupies this site (Fig. 2b). In the latter structure we observe a fully hydrated Mg2+ ion (octahedral coordination by six water molecules, average distance 2.1 Å) ∼5 Å from site 2 and near the protein surface. This cluster is hydrogen-bonded to the side chains of Arg132, Arg105, and Asp58 and to the sulfate ion. ITC Measurements of Metal Binding Affinities—We measured binding of Mg2+ and Ca2+ to HisB-N by ITC. Titration of HisB-N in the absence of substrate with either Mg2+ or Ca2+ confirmed the presence of two metal-binding sites with binding constants differing ∼50-fold (Table 2). Based on the crystal structures, site 1 is likely the primary site with ∼100 nm affinity for the first Mg2+ and site 2 is the secondary site with an affinity of ∼3 μm. The affinity for the first Ca2+ ion is 77 nm and ∼6 μm for the second. The relatively low affinity of site 2 concurs with our finding that in apo-HisB-N at low Ca2+ concentration a water molecule occupies this site. Furthermore, the presence of Ca2+ in site 2 in HisB-N·Ca/pAsp but not in HisB-N·Ca at an identical Ca2+ concentration indicates that the affinity of site 2 is enhanced upon formation of the phosphoaspartate intermediate.TABLE 2Binding constants of metals by ITC for the wild-type HisB-NMetalKdΔH0ΔS0μMkcal·mol−1cal·mol−1·K−1Mg2+Site 10.10 ± 0.04−3.20 ± 0.0521.1Site 23.10 ± 0.48−0.64 ± 0.0423.0Ca2+Site 10.08 ± 0.01−4.20 ± 0.0918.1Site 25.68 ± 1.07−0.89 ± 0.0321.0 Open table in a new tab HisB-N·Histidinol Complex—The difference Fourier map for crystals of HisB-N soaked with either histidinol phosphate or histidinol in the presence of Mg2+ showed identical electron density in the substrate-binding site of molecule B consistent with the histidinol moiety, thus indicating retention of enzymatic activity in the crystal.

Probing of the activity of the holo-SplG with oligonucleotides containing one spore photoproduct lesion at a defined site proved that the enzyme is able to turn over substrate. In addition to repair, we observed cleavage of AdoMet to generate 5′-deoxyadenosine. In the presence of aza-AdoMet the SplG is completely inhibited, which provides direct support for the repair mechanism.

Spores of various Bacillus and Clostridium species are extremely resistant to harsh physical, chemical, and biological conditions allowing them to survive even under extreme conditions (1Setlow P.

The resistance of spores from Geobacillus stearothermophilus toward heat is even so high that the survival of the organism during heat sterilization is used as a bioindicator for insufficient heat treatment (4Penna T. Ishii M. Machoshvili I. Marques M. Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 2002; 98: 525-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Particularly noteworthy is the unusually high stability of spores in the presence of UV light. For example under typical UV sterilization conditions, only about 70% of thermophilic G. stearothermophilus spores are inactivated. Under the same conditions, typical pathogens such as herpes simplex or polio viruses are fully destroyed (5Gerhardt P. Marquis R.E. Smith I. Slepecky R.A. Setlow P.

Mutagen. 2001; 38: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Although in normal cells mostly cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and (6Devine D.A. Keech A.P. Wood D.J. Killington R.A. Boyes H.

Photobiol. 2005; 4: 591-597Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). During germination, the SP lesion is repaired either by the general nucleotide excision repair pathway (14Setlow P. Comments Mol. Cell Biophys. 1988; 5: 253-264Google Scholar, 15Munakata N. Rupert C.S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1974; 130: 239-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) or by a single enzyme, called spore photoproduct lyase, which is able to split the SP lesions directly back into two thymidines. Recent studies by Nicholsen et al. (16Nicholson W.L. Fajardocavazos P. Pedrazareyes M. Sun Y.B. Zazuetasandoval R. J. Cell Biochem. 1995; 19: 275Google Scholar) and Broderick and co-workers (17Cheek J. Broderick J.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 2860-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) performed with the SP-lyase from Bacillus subtilis showed that the enzyme requires S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) as a cofactor for repair. A detailed sequence comparison, spectroscopic studies (18Rebeil R. Nicholson W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9038-9043Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 19Rebeil R. Sun Y.B. Chooback L. Pedraza-Reyes M. Kinsland C. Begley T.P. Nicholson W.L. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4879-4885Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a recent labeling experiment (17Cheek J. Broderick J.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 2860-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) all provide evidence that the SplG is a member of the radical AdoMet enzyme superfamily, which also includes anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase (aRNR), pyruvate formate-lyase, lysine-2,3-aminomutase, benzylsuccinate synthase-activating enzyme, and biotin synthase (BioB) (20Cheek J. Broderick J.B. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2001; 6: 209-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The DNA repair mechanism postulated by Begley and Mehl (21Mehl R.A. Begley T.P. Org. Lett. 1999; 1: 1065-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) is depicted in Scheme 1. It is assumed that the 5′-dAdo radical (17Cheek J. Broderick J.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 2860-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 18Rebeil R. Nicholson W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9038-9043Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), formed after electron transfer from the [4Fe-4S] cluster to the AdoMet, initiates the repair by abstracting the C-6 hydrogen of the SP lesion. The C-C bond linking the two pyrimidines undergoes β-fragmentation to give an allyl-type radical. The thermodynamically problematic last step is the transfer of the hydrogen atom back from the 5′-dAdoH to the thymine monomer radical, which completes the repair process (21Mehl R.A. Begley T.P. Org. Lett. 1999; 1: 1065-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). HPLC and electrospray ionization-MS analyses showed that the SplG cleaves AdoMet under anaerobic and reductive conditions to generate ∼2 molecules of 5′-deoxyadenosine per homodimer SplG in the absence of the SP lesion substrate (18Rebeil R. Nicholson W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9038-9043Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In the presence of the SP lesion substrate the 5′-deoxyadenosine production was found to be strongly increased (18Rebeil R. Nicholson W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9038-9043Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The organization of the [4Fe-4S] cluster and of the AdoMet-binding site requires three specific cysteine residues (Cys-91, Cys-95, and Cys-98), which form the typical motif, CXXXCXXC-, of proteins belonging to this radical enzyme superfamily (18Rebeil R. Nicholson W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9038-9043Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The SplB from B. subtilis contains a fourth cysteine (Cys-141), which was found to be essential for in vivo activity of the protein similar to that observed for biotin synthase. Here we describe the isolation and characterization of the first thermophilic spore photoproduct lyase (G. stearothermophilus). The stability of the enzyme allowed us to purify the apoprotein under aerobic conditions. Full reconstitution of the protein was possible under strict anaerobic conditions. Using a novel assay with a synthetic dinucleotide SP lesion substrate and with small DNA single strands, which contain one SP lesion at a defined site, we show that the fully reconstituted protein is active in the presence of AdoMet. We observed a specific activity of 2.6 μmol of SP repaired per min/mg of SplG. In the presence of aza-AdoMet, the SplG is completely inhibited, which provides direct support for the mentioned mechanism. An interesting feature of the enzyme is that it forms an extremely stable, catalytically active homodimer. Chemicals—S-Adenosylmethionine was purchased from Sigma and further purified by HPLC to remove additional S-adenosylhomocysteine. All bacteria media were purchased from Roth, and all other chemicals were obtained from commercial suppliers and used without further purification. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—G. stearothermophilus strain 10 (DSM number 13240) was grown in nutrient broth medium (meat peptone 5.00 g/liter and meat extract 3.00 g/liter, pH 7.0) under aerobic conditions in a shaker (300 rpm) at 60 °C. Escherichia coli strain Tuner™ pLysS (DE3) (Novagen) was used for overexpression of SplG. Construction of Plasmid—Genomic DNA of G. stearothermophilus was isolated using the DNeasy® tissue kit (Qiagen). The splG gene was obtained by PCR amplification from the genomic G. stearothermophilus DNA using AccuPrime™ Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) with the two primers, 5′-CACCATGCATCACCATCACCATCACATGAAACCGTTTGTGCCAAAACT-3′ and 5′-TTACGTAAAATACTGCACTTGGG-3′. The resulting 1.0-kb splG gene PCR product was cloned into the vector pET101-D (Invitrogen) by the Topo reaction. Overproduction and Purification of Recombinant Protein—E. coli strain Tuner™ pLysS (DE3), which is a lacYZ deletion mutant of BL21, enables the adjustment of the levels of protein expression throughout all cells in a culture, because the lac permease (lacY) mutation allows uniform entry of IPTG into all cells in the population. Recombinant SplG was expressed with an N-terminal His6 tag. Cells were cultivated with shaking at 150 rpm in 1 liter of LB medium (22Sambrock J. Russel D. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual,3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 1-125Google Scholar) containing 100 μm Fe(III)-citrate at 37 °C to an A600 = 0.6. IPTG was added to 1 mm, and incubation was continued at 22 °C for 12 h. Cells were harvested (10000 × g, 8 min, 4 °C) and stored at -20 °C. Subsequently the cell pellet was resuspended in 30 ml of 60 mm Na2HPO4 (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 5 mm l-cysteine, 20 mm ammonium ferrous sulfate, 10 mm ATP, and 1 tablet of protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The crude cell extract was solubilized in a French press at 1000 psi. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation (38,000 × g, 35 min, 4 °C), and the supernatant was applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole. SplG was eluted from the column using the same buffer containing 500 mm imidazole. In a second purification step, apo-SplG dimer was separated by a gel permeation chromatography with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl. The purified SplG, up to 2 mg/liter expression, was concentrated and transferred into a glovebox (MBraun, Unilab) containing a 5% H2, 95% N2 atmosphere, and less than 2 ppm O2. Inside the anaerobic chamber the aerobic buffer containing SplG apoprotein was exchanged by gel filtration to the reconstitution buffer. [4Fe-4S] Cluster Reconstitution—The apo-SplG was dissolved in 800 μl of reconstitution buffer, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), with 5 mm DTT for 0.5 h, followed by the addition of FeCl2 and Na2S to a final concentration of 100 μm. The SplG was then incubated anaerobically for 16 h at 4 °C. The holo-protein solution was finally concentrated in an Ultrafree®-0.5 centrifugal filter device (Millipore) up to a volume of 200 μl, and the buffer was exchanged. Synthesis of 5S- and 5R-configured Spore Lesion—Both diastereomers of the spore photoproduct were synthesized as described previously (23Friedel M.G. Berteau O. Pieck J.C. Atta M. Olliagnier-de-Choudens S. Fontecave M. Carell T. Chem. Commun. 2006; 4: 445-447Crossref Google Scholar). Synthesis of the aza-AdoMet—The synthesis and purification was similar to previously described procedures (24Jackson R.F.W. Fraser J.L. Wishart N. Porter B. Wythes M.J. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 1998; 12: 1903-1912Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 25Thompson M.J. Mekhalfia A. Hornby D.P. Blackburn G.M. J. Org. Chem. 1999; 64: 7467-7473Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 26Yang M. Ye W. Schneller S.W. J. Org. Chem. 2004; 69: 3993Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Synthesis of ssDNA Containing One SP Lesion—500 nmol of a 6-mer ssDNA (5′-GGTTGG-3′) was resuspended in 4 ml of buffer containing 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid, and 5 mm CaCl2 (pH 7.0). The solution was lyophilized in a 6-well cell culture plate. The obtained dry film was subsequently irradiated at 254 nm under anaerobic conditions. The SP containing DNA was separated by rp-HPLC from residual undamaged DNA. Oligonucleotides were concentrated in vacuo using a Savant SpeedVac and were desalted with Sep-Pak® cartridges (Waters) before use. Analyses of the SP in ssDNA—To prove that the SP was formed in the oligonucleotide, the oligonucleotide with the sequence 5′-GGTspTGG-3′ was enzymatically digested and analyzed by rp-HPLC-MS/MS. The results were compared with an analysis of previous studies (27Douki T. Cadet J. Photochem. Photobiol. Sci. 2003; 2: 433-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To 100 μl of a 20 μm solution of the oligonucleotide to be digested, 10 μl of a buffer containing 300 mm ammonium acetate, 100 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm ZnSO4 (pH 5.7) was added, followed by addition of 22 units of nuclease P1 (Penicillium citrinum) and 0.05 units of calf spleen phosphodiesterase. The solution was incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. To the resulting solution 12 μl of a buffer containing 500 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 10 units of alkaline phosphatase (calf intestinal phosphatase), and 9.1 units of snake venom phosphodiesterase were added sequentially followed by incubation at 37 °C for another 3 h. The solution thus obtained was added to 6 μl of 0.1 m HCl heat-denatured for 5 min. The solution was then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min. 30 μl of the solution was transferred into an HPLC vial, and the sample was injected into an HPLC-MS/MS system. Assay for ssDNA Repair, Cleavage of AdoMet, Inhibition with aza-AdoMet and the 5S- and 5R-configured Spore Lesion—To prove enzyme activity, the amount of 5′-deoxyadenosine and repaired SP was determined and analyzed by rp-HPLC. Each reaction mixture contains 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 200 mm KCl, 3 mm sodium dithionite, 5 mm DTT, and 0.45 mm AdoMet. All solutions were degassed, and the chemicals were transferred into the glovebox as solids. One sample contained only the components described above. To the second sample 50 μm holo-SplG was added. The third sample contained 50 μm SplG and the 5S-configured spore lesion (1 mm). The fourth sample was identical to the third sample but instead of the 5S-configured spore lesion it contained the 5R-configured spore lesion (1 mm). The reaction conditions for the ssDNA assay are identical to those described above. The reaction vial contained additionally 15 μm of the purified SP DNA strand and a 10-fold decreased SplG concentration. A sample was taken every 20 min for the kinetic measurement. All other reaction mixtures were incubated for 12 h at 4 °C. For the inhibition assay aza-AdoMet was used instead of AdoMet at the same concentration. After incubation, the reaction mixture was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. All samples were thawed and centrifuged to remove precipitated protein before HPLC purification. rp-HPLC Analyses—For rp-HPLC analysis, the samples were injected directly after centrifugation into the rp-HPLC system to decrease the amount of AdoMet cleaved to S-adenosylhomocysteine. Up to 50 μl of the enzyme reaction mixture were injected onto the rp-HPLC column (Nucleosil C18, 250 mm, 5 μm, 300 Å, Macherey & Nagel) equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O. The products were separated using a 20-ml linear gradient 30% solvent B (50% CH3CN with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) (flow rate 0.7 ml/min at 22 °C). The HPLC gradient was chosen to allow rapid separation and hence easy detection of thymidine in the assay solution, which is the only expected product of the repair reaction. The peaks were assigned by co-injection of thymidine and 5′-deoxyadenosine, and also by further analysis of the newly formed peak by rp-HPLC coupled to a FTICR spectrometer to get a high resolution mass of the newly formed product. LC-FTICR Spectrometer Analysis—Fractions of the rp-HPLC analyses were lyophilized and resuspended with double distilled water. All measurements were run on a Thermo Finnigan LTQ FT (Thermo Finnigan, Bremen, Germany). The resolution was attuned to 100,000 at m/z = 400. The mass range was adjusted up to 1000. The measurements were conducted using an IonMax ion source with an electrospray ionization head (Thermo Finnigan, Bremen, Germany). The spray capillary voltage was 3 kV, the heating capillary temperature 300 °C, and the flow rate 200 μl/min. UV-visible Spectroscopy—UV-visible spectroscopy was performed in 150 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The holo-SplG (0.8 mg/ml) was transferred from the glovebox with a UV cuvette (precision cell made of quartz Suprasil®; Helma) airtight with a plug. The cluster reduction was performed previously in the glovebox with 3.6 mm sodium dithionite. All measurements were performed with a UV-visible spectrometer (Varian 100 Bio, Cary). EPR Spectroscopy—Purified holo-SplG was concentrated, placed anaerobically in EPR tubes, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. EPR spectra at X-band (9.45 GHz) were obtained with a Bruker ESP spectrometer. Cooling was performed with an Oxford Instruments ESR-900 helium flow cryostat with an ITC-4 temperature controller. Iron and Sulfur Content Determination—Iron and sulfur content was analyzed either by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), using a Varian Vista RL CCD simultaneous ICP-AES spectrometer, or by a colorimetric assay. ICP-AES protein samples were dialyzed against two changes of buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 300 mm NaCl) containing 300 nmol/ml holo-SplG. The emission of iron and sulfur was monitored. In the colorimetric iron assay, 600 μl of holo-SplG was incubated for 10 min with 100 μl of HCl (8 m) and for further 10 min with 100 μl of trichloroacetic acid (80% w/v). Subsequently, 200 μl of ammonium acetate was added (75% w/v) to adjust the pH to 4.5. 80 μl of hydroxylamine hydrochloride (10% w/v) and 2,4,6-tripyridyl-S-triazine (4 mm) were added. The absorbance was measured at 593 nm with a UV-visible spectrometer (Varian 100 Bio, Cary) (28Fischer D.S. Price D.C. Clin. Chem. 1964; 10: 21-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In the colorimetric S2- assay, 700 μl of holo-SplG was incubated and vortexed with 100 μl of NaOH (6% w/v) and 500 μl of Zn(CH3COO)2. Then 250 μl of N,N-dimethyl-p-phenyldiamine (0.1% w/v in 5 m HCl) and 100 μl of FeCl3 (11.5 mm in 0.6 m HCl) were added and incubated for 0.5 h. The absorbance was measured at 670 nm with a UV-visible spectrometer (Varian 100 Bio, Cary) (29King T.E. Morris R.O. Methods Enzymol. 1964; 10: 634-641Crossref Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The average value of the iron and sulfur concentration, determined from a standard curve, was divided by the protein concentration in the assay to determine the moles of iron and sulfur bound per mol of protein monomer. Dimer and Monomer Structure Analysis—The aerobically purified SplG monomer and dimer were separated by gel permeation chromatography as described above. To probe the contribution of an intrasubunit and intersubunits disulfide bond formation between Cys-141 and Cys-326, the apo-SplG monomer and dimer were incubated with increasing concentrations of reductant tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) (30Doucette P.A. Whitson L.J. Cao X. Schirf V. Demeler B. Valentine J.S. Hansen J.C. Hart P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54558-54566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) from 1 to 250 mm. The structure modifications were analyzed by SDS-PAGE or gel permeation chromatography. Based on the sequence from G. stearothermophilus, oligonucleotides were designed to amplify the splG gene by PCR with chromosomal DNA from G. stearothermophilus. The obtained 1054-bp fragment was cloned into the pET101-D vector, and the expression of the gene was successfully performed in E. coli. We first wanted to clarify whether the enzyme exists in a monomeric or dimeric form (18Rebeil R. Nicholson W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9038-9043Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To this end, the SP lyase from G. stearothermophilus was isolated and purified under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. In both cases the protein had a dark brown color indicative of the presence of an intact Fe/S cluster. This result provided the first evidence that the cluster survives aerobic handling of the protein. Fig. 1 shows the SDS-PAGE results. In Fig. 1, lane 2, a new band (marked with an arrow) was detected, which corresponded to the SplG monomer after induction with IPTG and also stained in Western blot experiments. Subsequent affinity chromatography to purify apo-SplG was performed. However, only a protein mixture as shown in Fig. 1, lane 3, was obtained. The molecular mass marker indicated for the major band a mass of ∼64 kDa, already indicating that the SplG protein dimerizes under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. In order to clarify the molecular sizes in more detail, MALDI-MS analysis (data not shown) of this band was performed. This MS analysis revealed molecular mass values of 74 and 81 kDa for the isolated proteins. The 81-kDa protein possesses the correct molecular mass for the dimerized form of apo-SplG, whereas the molecular mass at 74 kDa is a proteolytically cleaved apo-SplG dimer. The second set of bands (Fig. 1, lane 3) between 36 and 50 kDa on the gel was also further analyzed by MALDI-MS mass spectrometry (data not shown). The two analyzed protein fractions featured molecular masses of 37 and 40.5 kDa, which are the correct molecular masses for the apo-SplG monomer (40.5 kDa) and again of a proteolytically shortened version of the protein (37 kDa). The last band on the SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 1, lane 3) corresponded to a small, N-terminally His6-tagged 27-kDa fragment of the SplG. All the proteolytically shortened fragments with molecular weights smaller than those calculated from the DNA sequence are clearly C-terminal deletion fragments because all fragments are positively recognized by the anti-His6 tag monoclonal antibody in Western blotting experiments. In order to convert the functionally inactive apo-SplG into the catalytically competent form, the [4Fe4S] cluster needed to be reconstituted. To this end, the apo-SplG was treated with FeCl2, Na2S, and DTT in the glovebox. The fully reconstituted form was highly oxygen-sensitive as expected. Handling of the reconstituted enzyme required strict anaerobic conditions. Fig. 1, lane 5, shows the fully reconstituted holo-SplG dimer after purification by affinity chromatography of the apoprotein. Interestingly, holo-SplG showed the same behavior as in the gel electrophoresis experiments (Fig. 1, lane 4). The protein exists as a full-length and a C-terminally truncated dimer and monomer. A more detailed SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 2) of the protein monomers and dimers showed that the bands are in all cases rather broad. In order to investigate whether this effect is caused by potential residual secondary structure elements, perhaps induced by the Fe/S cluster, we added increasing amounts of TCEP to the protein solution (up to 250 mm). Indeed, this procedure significantly sharpened the bands indicating that residual secondary structural elements were resolved. Most surprisingly, however, is the observation that the ratio between the protein in the monomeric and dimeric state did not change. This shows that the SplG protein dimer is extremely stable. We next started to investigate the presence of the [4Fe-4S]+/2+ cluster in more detail using UV-visible spectroscopy. The absorption spectra of the reconstituted SplG dimer exhibited a broad absorption peak at around 420 nm (Fig. 3A), characteristic for a [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster. Based on the UV-visible spectrum we can fully rule out that the protein contains an [2Fe-2S]2+ cluster, as such a cluster would possess absorption peaks/shoulders around 330, 420, 460, and 560 nm (31Orme-Johnson W.H. Orme-Johnson N.R. Spiro T.G. Iron Sulfur Proteins. Wiley Interscience, New York1982: 67-96Google Scholar, 32Imai T. Taguchi K. Ogawara Y. Ohmori D. Yamakura F. Ikezawa H. Urushiyama A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 130: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In addition, the molar extinction coefficient (ϵ410 ≈ 15,000 m -1 cm-1) for the [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster fits nicely to the calculated value of ϵ410 ≈ 13,500 m-1 cm-1 per enzyme monomer. Based on the extinction coefficient, we concluded that the holo-SplG dimer contains one [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster per monomer. A value of 3.8 ± 0.3 mol of iron per mol of holo-SplG monomer was found by the method of Fischer and Price (28Fischer D.S. Price D.C. Clin. Chem. 1964; 10: 21-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). ICP-AES revealed a value of 4.5 ± 0.4 mol of iron per mol of holo-SplG. In addition, we determined 3.7 ± 0.3 mol of acid-labile sulfur per mol of enzyme using the method of King and Morris (29King T.E. Morris R.O. Methods Enzymol. 1964; 10: 634-641Crossref Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The iron sulfur cluster is likely bound to the protein via the well established motif 91CXXXCXXC98. In order to reduce the [4Fe-4S]2+ to the catalytically active [4Fe-4S]+ form, 3.6 mm sodium dithionite was added to the protein solution in the UV cuvette. This resulted immediately in a strong reduction of the absorbance in the entire visible region (Fig. 4B), demonstrating that the reconstituted iron sulfur cluster is indeed redox-active. Addition of the dithionite solution caused an almost full loss of all absorption bands λ > 350 nm within 30 min (Fig. 4B) indicating full conversion of the cluster into the active [4Fe-4S]+ redox state. We next performed EPR spectroscopy to obtain a deeper insight into the [4Fe-4S] cluster. The obtained data are in full agreement with the presence of two [4Fe-4S]+ clusters per SplG homodimer.

S.

Casal J.J. Whitelam G.C. Plant Cell Environ. 1995; 18: 788-794Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar). These two photoresponses mediated by phyA are of the types called very low fluence responses (VLFR) and high irradiance responses (HIR), respectively (9Schäfer E. Nagy F. Photomorphogenesis in Plants and Bacteria: Function and Signal Transduction Mechanisms. Springer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2006Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Some physiological processes (e.g. inhibition of hypocotyl growth, unfolding of the cotyledons) exhibit both VLFR and HIR as two discrete phases of response, where VLFR saturates with infrequent FR pulses and HIR requires very frequent or continuous FR (10Casal J.J. Yanovsky M.J. Luppi J.P. Photochem. Photobiol. 2000; 71: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). HIR requires cis-acting elements at target gene promoters (11Cerdán P.D. Staneloni R.J.

The N-terminal domain of phytochromes bears the chromophore attachment site (13Lagarias J.C. Rapoport H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 4821-4828Crossref Scopus (259) Google Scholar) and provides differential spectral selectivity to phyA (more active under FR than red light) compared with phyB (more active under red light than FR) (14Wagner D.

The C-terminal domain contains a histidine kinase-related sequence motif that is able to mediate phosphorylation (15Yeh K.-C. Lagarias J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Two recent findings have focused attention on the N-terminal domain of phytochromes. First, the N-terminal domain of phyB fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP), β-glucuronidase (GUS), and a nuclear localization signal (NLS) is physiologically active (21Matsushita T. Mochizuki N. Nagatani A. Nature. 2003; 424: 571-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 22Oka Y. Matsushita T. Mochizuki N. Suzuki T. Tokutomi S. Nagatani A. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2104-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This result contradicts the previous extended consensus that the C-terminal domain of phytochromes was responsible for downstream signaling. Second, Wagner et al. (23Wagner J.R. Brunzelle J.S. Forest K.T. Vierstra R.D. Nature. 2005; 438: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) have determined the crystal structure of the conserved N terminus photosensory core of a bacteriophytochrome from Deinococcus radiodurans (DrBphP). The results presented here provide insight into the physiological function and biochemical activity of the N-terminal domain of phyA. By using a forward genetics approach we have identified a mutation of the PHYA gene that impairs chromophore binding despite its relative distant position to the attachment site within the GAF domain. We also report on the biological activity of an N-terminal domain fragment of phyA and the impact of the aforementioned mutation on this activity. Mutant Screening—Ethylmethane sulfonate mutagenized seeds of A. thaliana (accession Landsberg erecta; Lehle Seeds, Round Rock, TX) were sown in clear plastic boxes (175 × 225 mm2 × 45 mm in height) containing 0.8% agar, incubated 3 days in darkness at 7 °C, and then transferred to continuous FR for 4 days (12Yanovsky M.J. Luppi J.P. Kirchbauer D. Ogorodnikova O.B. Sineshchekov V.A. Adam E. Kircher S. Staneloni R.J. Schäfer E. Nagy F. Casal J.J. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1591-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Cloning and Sequencing of the phyA-303 Allele—Total mRNA was obtained with RNA Easy Plant kit (Qiagen) and used as a template for reverse transcription PCR to produce PHYA cDNA (primers are described in supplemental Table S1). The fragment was cloned into pUC19 vector and sequenced at Automatic DNA Isolation and Sequencing (Max-Planck-Institut für Züchtungsforschung). Physiological Characterization—The wild-type (WT) strain and the phyA-201 (24Nagatani A. Reed J.W. Chory J.

Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 425-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) are all in the Landsberg erecta background. Fifteen seeds of each genotype were sown in clear plastic boxes and exposed to the different light treatments as described (12Yanovsky M.J. Luppi J.P. Kirchbauer D. Ogorodnikova O.B. Sineshchekov V.A. Adam E. Kircher S. Staneloni R.J. Schäfer E. Nagy F. Casal J.J. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1591-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Interference filters were used to provide light at 700, 710, 720 nm (CVI Laser Corp.), or 743 nm (Mainz Schott). Hypocotyl length was measured with a ruler, and the angle between the cotyledons was measured with a protractor. Data corresponding to the 10 tallest seedlings from each box were averaged (one replicate) (12Yanovsky M.J. Luppi J.P. Kirchbauer D. Ogorodnikova O.B. Sineshchekov V.A. Adam E. Kircher S. Staneloni R.J. Schäfer E. Nagy F. Casal J.J. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1591-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In the experiments involving chromophore feeding, 3 μl of biliverdin IXα solution of the indicated concentrations were added to each seed under green light immediately after the red light exposure used to induce germination. The boxes were kept in darkness at 23 °C for 20 h and then placed in darkness or under the various light treatments for 3 days before measurements. Low Temperature in Vivo Phytochrome Fluorescence—Fluorescence emission spectra at low temperature (85 K) were recorded in the hypocotyl plus root of 4-day-old seedlings grown in darkness with a laboratory-designed spectrofluorometer based on two double grating monochromators as described (12Yanovsky M.J. Luppi J.P. Kirchbauer D. Ogorodnikova O.B. Sineshchekov V.A. Adam E. Kircher S. Staneloni R.J. Schäfer E. Nagy F. Casal J.J. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1591-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). PHYA Protein Blots—Aliquots of plant extracts (29Martínez-García J.F. Monte E. Quail P.H. Plant J. 1999; 20: 251-257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing ∼20 μg of crude protein were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) for 1 h at ∼200 mA. Immunodetection of Arabidopsis PHYA was performed using monoclonal antibody 073D (kindly provided by Richard Vierstra, University of Wisconsin). Detection of recombinant proteins and oat PHYA-65-GFP-GUS-NLS fusion proteins from transgenic plants was performed using monoclonal antibody Oat25 (kindly provided by Lee Pratt, University of Georgia). In all cases the blot was incubated overnight at 4 °C with the corresponding primary antibody. After washing, the membrane was incubated with 1:1000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody to mouse IgG (Sigma) for 1-2 h at room temperature. Bands were visualized by the chemoluminescent method. Band intensity was quantified with the Scion Image Software. Heterologous Expression of PHYA Gene, Mutagenesis, and Protein Purification—For yeast expression the N-terminal domain of oat PHYA (nucleotides 1-1795, which corresponds to residues 1-595) was cloned into a derivative from the pHILD2 vector (Invitrogen), placing a His6 tail at the C-terminal end of the sequence. The R384K mutation was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis with the QuikChange Stratagene kit. The presence of the mutation was confirmed by sequencing. Plasmids were introduced into Pichia pastoris GS115, and expression was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pichia expression kit; Invitrogen). For expression in bacterial host, the N-terminal cDNA from oat PHYA was cloned into pMEX8 vector. The mutation was produced as in the yeast system. Generation of the reverted gene was achieved by site-directed mutagenesis. Expression was accomplished in Escherichia coli Top10F′ strain (1-liter culture). For yeast and bacteria, cells were disrupted at liquid N2 temperature using an Ultra-Turrax, and the protein solution was clarified by ultracentrifugation at 14,000 rpm, 4 °C. The supernatant was used directly for chromophore assembly experiments. Detection of apoprotein was also checked in protein blots. His-tagged proteins were purified over the BD TALON™ metal affinity resin (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA). Elution was carried out using imidazol, and buffer changes were performed by either dialysis with 10 K dialysis frames (Slide-A-Lyzer; Pierce) or by gel filtration using the PD-10 columns (Amersham Biosciences). All the primers are described in supplemental Table S1. Measurements of Δ Absorbance—Δ absorbance spectra after red/far-red irradiations were obtained as described earlier (30Ruddat A. Schmidt P. Gatz C. Braslavsky S.E. Gärtner W. Schaffner K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). ΔΔ absorbance was calculated as the difference between Δ absorbance at 654 and 715 nm (assembly experiments) or 660 and 730 nm (seedling extracts). Seedling extracts were obtained as described (31Hisada A. Hanzawa H. Weller J. Nagatani A. Reid J. Furuya M. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 1063-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Chromophore Preparation—Phycocyanobilin (PCB) was extracted from Spirulina platensis as described (32Kufer W. Sheer H. Hoppe Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1979; 360: 935-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Biliverdin IXα was derived from bilirubin by oxidation (33Mc Donagh A.F. Palma L.A. Biochem. J. 1980; 189: 193-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and was purified by high pressure liquid chromatography with the column Inertsil-3-C18 7,6 × 250 mm and solvent EtOH:MeOH:Acetone:H2O (20:20:20:40). Fractions were lyophilized and stored at -70 °C in darkness. Plasmid Construction and Plant Transformation—Construction of the PHYA-65-WT-GFP-GUS-NLS chimeric gene was performed in several steps fusing all the four genes. The nuclear localization signal from SV40 was obtained by annealing of oligonucleotides (supplemental Table S1). The fragment encoding the N-terminal domain of PHYA from oat was amplified by PCR and fused to the sequences encoding the GFP-GUS-NLS fragment. The chimeric gene was generated in pBSKSII and subcloned into pCHF3 vector under the 35S promoter. To generate the PHYA-65-R384K-GFP-GUS-NLS fusion, the fragment of the WT PHYA cDNA was replaced by the oat-mutated version. A. thaliana phyA-201 was transformed as described (34Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformed plants were selected against 50 μg/ml kanamycin, and T2 seeds were tested for a 3:1 segregation of kanamycin resistance. T3 seeds of positive T2 lines were tested for homozygous genetic segregation and used for further experiments. Confocal Microscopy—Transgenic seedlings were grown on agar (0.8% w/v) plates for 3 days in the dark. Etiolated seedlings were kept in the dark or exposed to either white light or FR. All subsequent manipulations were performed under green safe-light. To visualize nuclei and cell walls, seedlings were stained with 0.1 μm aqueous solution of propidium iodide for 5-10 min (21Matsushita T. Mochizuki N. Nagatani A. Nature. 2003; 424: 571-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Fluorescence of GFP and propidium iodide was visualized by a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Zeiss LSM5, Pascal) with standard fluorescein isothiocyanate (GFP) and tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate filters (propidium iodide). Images corresponding to dark were taken within the first minute of microscope observation. Similar results were obtained with hypocotyl and root samples. At least 10 seedlings were analyzed for each genotype, and representative images were processed using Adobe Photoshop 8.0 software. Novel phyA Mutant Allele—To obtain mutants impaired in the HIR but retaining a significant VLFR we used mutagenized seeds of A. thaliana and selected seedlings with long hypocotyl and poorly opened cotyledons under continuous FR (typical of poor HIR) produced by seeds that germinated under FR (typical of normal VLFR) (12Yanovsky M.J. Luppi J.P. Kirchbauer D. Ogorodnikova O.B. Sineshchekov V.A. Adam E. Kircher S. Staneloni R.J. Schäfer E. Nagy F. Casal J.J. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1591-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The mutant that we describe here was confirmed in the next generation by its ability to germinate under FR and its impaired hypocotyl growth and cotyledon angle responses under FR (Fig. 1A). No differences between the WT and the mutant were observed in darkness or under red light (Fig. 1B). The latter excluded mutations at loci involved in the synthesis of the chromophore, which are predicted to affect all phytochromes and therefore not only the response to FR but also to red light (see chromophore synthesis mutants hy1 and hy2 in Fig. 1B) (27Davis S.J. Kurepa J. Vierstra R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6541-6546Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 28Kohchi T. Mukougawa K. Frankenberg N. Masuda M. Yokota A. Lagarias J.C. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 425-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 35Parks B.M. Quail P.H. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 1177-1186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The null phyA-201 mutant failed to complement the mutant selected here (e.g. cotyledon angle under FR was <10° for the F1 generation of their cross), suggesting that the PHYA gene itself was affected. The PHYA gene was cloned and sequenced completely from two independent plants. A single base pair change (G-1337 to A) was observed, which resulted in the R384K substitution (Fig. 1C). The mutation falls in the GAF domain of PHYA, 61 amino acid residues away from the chromophore-bearing cysteine residue. The allele obtained here had not been reported earlier and was named phyA-303. Physiological Characterization—For inhibition of hypocotyl growth and promotion of cotyledon unfolding, the VLFR saturates with infrequent FR pulses (e.g. one pulse every hour), whereas HIR requires very frequent or continuous excitation with FR (10Casal J.J. Yanovsky M.J. Luppi J.P. Photochem. Photobiol. 2000; 71: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In the phyA-303 mutant, the VLFR (difference between hourly FR and darkness) of hypocotyl growth and cotyledon unfolding was close to the WT levels, but the HIR (difference between the effects of continuous and hourly FR) was severely impaired (Fig. 2, A and C). Another distinctive feature of the HIR is its strong fluence rate dependence (9Schäfer E. Nagy F. Photomorphogenesis in Plants and Bacteria: Function and Signal Transduction Mechanisms. Springer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2006Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The phyA-303 mutant showed very weak fluence rate dependence (Fig. 2, B and D) but normal wavelength dependence of the phyA-mediated response (Fig. 2E). Spectral Activity and Protein Abundance of phyA in phyA-303—Low temperature phytochrome fluorescence was severely reduced in dark-grown seedlings of phyA-303. Subtraction of the residual fluorescence signal observed in a null allele of phyA (i.e. the signal accounted for mainly by phyB) indicates that the phyA signal in the mutant is less than 0.2 of the WT signal (Fig. 3A). This result is consistent with the ΔΔ absorbance signal observed in seedling extracts (WT, 0.0048; phyA-303, 0.0019; null mutant phyA-201, 0.0010; i.e. the phyA-303 mutant retains 0.2 of the WT signal). The residual phytochrome photochemical activity in the mutant was qualitatively similar to that observed in the WT in terms of Pr-lumi-R photoequilibrium (Fig. 3B) and fluorescence spectrum (Fig. 3C). Immunochemically detected levels of PHYA were also reduced in the phyA-303, but this effect appears not as intense as the reduction in spectral activity (Fig. 3D). Because the phenotype of the phyA-303 mutant is observed under FR and not in darkness, we investigated whether the differences in PHYA protein levels were larger under FR due to increased instability of the mutated protein. Seedlings were grown for 3 days in darkness and then exposed to continuous FR for 7 h. Exposure of WT seedlings to FR caused a small but detectable decrease in protein levels (10Casal J.J. Yanovsky M.J. Luppi J.P. Photochem. Photobiol. 2000; 71: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The response of the phyA-303 mutant was not proportionally larger than that observed in the WT (Fig. 3E). Mutation R384K Impairs Chromophore Incorporation—The phyA-303 mutant showed a stronger reduction in low temperature fluorescence signal than in protein levels (Fig. 3). Because Pr-lumi-R photoequilibrium of the residual phytochrome was normal (Fig. 3B), one might propose that the mutation could reduce the efficiency of chromophore incorporation. To test this hypothesis in vitro we expressed WT and R384K mutated PHYA gene of Avena sativa, which for practical reasons is normally used for in vitro studies (16Fankhauser C. Yeh K.C. Lagarias J.C.

Nam H. Cell. 2005; 120: 395-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), in two heterologous systems (E. coli or P. pastoris). We expressed the first 595 amino acids of oat PHYA (PHYA-65) because the spectroscopical features of this domain are almost identical to those of full-length phytochrome and the truncated protein is expressed in higher yields and shows an improved stability (39Schmidt P. Gensch T. Remberg A. Gärtner W. Braslavsky S.E. Schaffner K. Photochem. Photobiol. 1998; 65: 754-761Google Scholar). When incubated with PCB, PHYA-65-WT yielded typical spectrophotometric features with maximum absorbance differences at 654 and 713 nm between samples irradiated with red or FR (Fig. 4, A and C). After incubation of an equal amount of the mutated PHYA-65-R384K with PCB, the Δ absorbance signal was weak (Fig. 4, A and C) and did not increase even after overnight incubation (data not shown), thus precluding kinetics analyses (40Li L. Lagarias J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19204-19210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence and integrity of the WT and mutant PHYA were confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry of the purified recombinant proteins (Fig. 4B). Although weak, the residual signal showed normal parameters (Fig. 4C). As a control experiment, WT PHYA was reconstituted from PHYA-65-R384K by site-directed mutagenesis to regenerate arginine. The regenerated WT PHYA was identical to the originally recombinant WT PHYA in terms of spectral behavior (Fig. 4C) and kinetics of chromophore incorporation (data not shown). The primary defect of PHYA-65-R384K is in chromophore incorporation rather than in phototransformation. The absorption spectrum of PHYA-65-R384K plus chromophore was similar to that of the chromophore alone (Fig. 4D), indicating that PHYA-65-R384K fails to normally incorporate the chromophore and change its environment and spectral properties. PHYA-65-WT incorporated the chromophore and showed a maximum shift to 654 nm compared with free chromophore. Feeding with Biliverdin IXα Partially Rescues the phyA-303 Mutant—To investigate whether chromophore incorporation in vivo was limiting for the physiological output, we cultivated WT and phyA-303 seedlings on agar supplemented with different doses of the chromophore precursor biliverdin IXα. The rationale behind this experiment was that if the inefficient incorporation of chromophore caused reduced responses to FR, increasing the amount of available chromophore might probably alleviate this defect. This expectation was met by the data (Fig. 5). In seedlings grown under continuous FR, addition of biliverdin IXα had no effects on the WT or the phyA-201 (null allele) mutant but fully rescued the chromophore mutant hy1 (35Parks B.M. Quail P.H. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 1177-1186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and partially rescued the phyA-303 mutant. The reduced protein levels observed in phyA-303 (Fig. 3D) could account for the failure of biliverdin IXα to fully restore a WT response to continuous FR. Addition of biliverdin IXα had no effect in phyA-303 seedlings grown under hourly pulses of FR (data not shown). Physiological Output of Oat PHYA Amino-terminal Domain— The amino-terminal domain of PHYB is sufficient for signaling when fused to GFP, GUS, and NLS and expressed in a phyB null background (21Matsushita T. Mochizuki N. Nagatani A. Nature. 2003; 424: 571-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 22Oka Y. Matsushita T. Mochizuki N. Suzuki T. Tokutomi S. Nagatani A. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2104-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Because our in vitro data had been obtained with the amino-terminal domain of oat WT and mutated PHYA (amino acids 1-595), we decided to evaluate the in vivo performance of the oat PHYA N-terminal domain fused to GFP, GUS, and NLS in a phyA-null mutant background in A. thaliana. Previous studies demonstrating activity of the N terminus had been done with phyB (21Matsushita T. Mochizuki N. Nagatani A. Nature. 2003; 424: 571-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 22Oka Y. Matsushita T. Mochizuki N. Suzuki T. Tokutomi S. Nagatani A. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2104-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar); thus, an additional interest of this experiment was to test whether the N terminus of phyA is also sufficient for downstream signaling. We obtained five independent transgenic lines homozygous for the PHYA transgene fusion (PHYA-65-WT lines) and four lines for the phyA-303 transgene fusion (PHYA-65-R384K lines). Taking advantage of the presence of GFP we investigated the cellular localization of the fusion proteins by confocal microscopy. Both PHYA-65-WT and PHYA-65-R384K showed nuclear expression in darkness and under illumination (Fig. 6A). The abundance of these fusion proteins measured by their GUS activity remained unaffected by the exposure of dark-grown seedlings to red light (Fig. 6B). The physiological output of the different lines was plotted against their GUS activity driven by the fusion proteins. To our surprise, the length of the hypocotyl observed in independent transgenic lines grown in full darkness was inversely related to the GUS activity. This effect was somewhat larger for PHYA-65-WT than for PHYA-65-R384K (Fig. 6C). The two lines expressing the highest levels of GUS also showed unfolding of the cotyledons in darkness (Fig. 6D). The seedlings grown under continuous FR showed only a weak inhibition of hypocotyl growth by the light treatment, whic"

This reaction is (and has to be) specific, as broad substrate specificity would result in unproductive shortcircuiting with the general oxidizing thioredoxin(s) present in the same compartment. Using mutational analysis and subsequent biochemical and structural characterization of active site variants, we show that reduced ResA displays unusually low reactivity at neutral pH, consistent with the observed high pKa values>8 for both active site cysteines. Residue Glu80 is shown to play a key role in controlling the acid-base properties of the active site. A model in which substrate binding dramatically enhances the reactivity of the active site cysteines is proposed to account for the specificity of the protein. Such a substratemediated activation mechanism is likely to have wide relevance for extracytoplasmic thioredoxins."

Previous mutational and structural analyses of Encephalitozoon cuniculi Ecm1, a prototypal cellular cap methyltransferase, identified amino acids required for cap methylation in vivo, but also underscored the nonessentiality of many side chains that contact the cap and AdoMet substrates. Here we tested new mutations in residues that comprise the guanine-binding pocket, alone and in combination. The outcomes indicate that the shape of the guanine binding pocket is more crucial than particular base edge interactions, and they highlight the contributions of the aliphatic carbons of Phe-141 and Tyr-145 that engage in multiple van der Waals contacts with guanosine and S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), respectively. We purified 45 Ecm1 mutant proteins and assayed them for methylation of GpppA in vitro. Of the 21 mutations that resulted in unconditional lethality in vivo,14 reduced activity in vitro to < 2% of the wild-type level and 5 reduced methyltransferase activity to between 4 and 9% of wild-type Ecm1. The natural product antibiotic sinefungin is an AdoMet analog that inhibits Ecm1 with modest potency. The crystal structure of an Ecm1-sinefungin binary complex reveals sinefungin-specific polar contacts with main-chain and side-chain atoms that can explain the 3-fold higher affinity of Ecm1 for sinefungin versus AdoMet or S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy). In contrast, sinefungin is an extremely potent inhibitor of the yeast cap methyltransferase Abd1, to which sinefungin binds 900-fold more avidly than AdoHcy or AdoMet. We find that the sensitivity of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to growth inhibition by sinefungin is diminished when Abd1 is overexpressed.

RNA triphosphatase hydrolyzes the 5′-triphosphate end of the pre-mRNA to a diphosphate, which is capped with GMP by RNA guanylyltransferase.

This pathway is conserved in all eukaryotic organisms and many eukaryotic viruses (1Shuman S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).

Inhibition of cap methylation, in particular, has been touted as an anti-infective strategy based on two lines of evidence: (i) raising the cellular levels of AdoHcy by genetic or pharmacological inhibition of AdoHcy hydrolase blocks replication of many viruses (3Liu S.

The cap methyltransferase Ecm1 from the microsporidian parasite Encephalitozoon cuniculi (23Hausmann S. Vivares C.P. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 96-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) is presently the best model for mechanistic studies of cap methylation. Ecm1 is the smallest cap methyltransferase known (298 amino acids), and it suffices for cap methylation in vivo, as gauged by complementation in yeast (23Hausmann S. Vivares C.P. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 96-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of Ecm1 bound to its substrates have been determined (24Fabrega C. Hausmann S. Shen V.

Ecm1 contains two ligand-binding pockets, one for the methyl donor AdoMet, and one for the cap guanosine methyl acceptor and the 5′-triphosphate of the cap. Superposition of the structures of Ecm1-ligand complexes suggested a direct in-line mechanism of methyl transfer. It was remarkable that no Ecm1 residues were observed in contact with the guanine-N7 nucleophile, the AdoMet methyl carbon, or the AdoHcy sulfur leaving group, implying that Ecm1 facilitates methyl transfer to cap guanine-N7 by optimizing proximity and geometry of the donor and acceptor. A similar catalytic strategy is used by glycine N-methyltransferase (26Takata Y. Huhang Y. Komoto J. Yamada T. Konishi K. Ogawa H. Gomi T. Fujioka M. Takusagawa F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8394-8402Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).The availability of a crystal structure has spurred biochemical and structure-function analyses of Ecm1 (24Fabrega C. Hausmann S. Shen V. Shuman S. Lima C.D. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 77-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 25Hausmann S. Zheng S. Fabrega C. Schneller S.W. Lima C.D.

Purified recombinant Ecm1 is a monomeric protein that catalyzes methyl transfer from AdoMet (Km 25 μm) to GpppA (Km 0.1 mm), GTP (Km 1 mm), or GDP (Km 2.4 mm), but not ATP, CTP, UTP, ITP, or m7GTP. A large collection of alanine and conservative mutants has been generated and tested for activity in yeast by complementation of an abd1Δ strain. This effort has pinpointed critical constituents of the active site that bind to AdoMet (Lys-54, Asp-70, Asp-78, and Asp-94), the cap triphosphate (Arg-106), or the cap guanosine (Phe-141). Tyr-145 is an essential residue that contacts both AdoMet and the cap guanine (Fig. 1). Purification and characterization of recombinant versions of a few Ecm1-Ala mutants verified that Lys-54, Asp-70, Asp-78, Asp-94, and Phe-141 were essential for methylation of GTP in vitro (25Hausmann S. Zheng S. Fabrega C. Schneller S.W. Lima C.D. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20404-20412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).It was surprising that many of the side chains that contact the substrates in the Ecm1 crystal structures were nonessential for activity in yeast, as surmised from the lack of a growth phenotype when the residue was replaced by alanine. Mutating other residues that contact the substrates resulted in temperature-sensitive growth. It was particularly noteworthy how few of the individual side-chain contacts to the edge of the guanine base were essential for Ecm1 function in vivo, given the stringent specificity for a guanine nucleotide as the methyl acceptor (25Hausmann S. Zheng S. Fabrega C. Schneller S.W. Lima C.D. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20404-20412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This suggested that there might be functional redundancy among the substrate-binding residues. Here we sought to address this issue by analyzing the effects of new mutations in residues that comprise the guanine-binding pocket, alone and in combination. The outcomes indicate that neither of the polar contacts (from His-144 and Tyr-145) to the O6 atom of guanine are essential in vivo and suggest that the shape of the guanine binding pocket is more crucial than base edge interactions. The results also illuminate the contributions of the aliphatic carbons of Phe-141 and Tyr-145 that engage in multiple van der Waals contacts with guanosine and AdoMet, respectively.To compare the growth phenotypes in yeast with mutational effects on enzyme activity, we purified 45 Ecm1 mutant proteins produced in bacteria and assayed them for methylation of GpppA in vitro. Whereas lethality in vivo generally correlated with ablation of methyltransferase activity, we noted many instances of mutations that were viable or conditional in yeast despite much reduced cap methyltransferase activity in vitro. We surmise that there is a threshold level of methyltransferase required for growth that is exceeded when wild-type Ecm1 is expressed in yeast. The mutational effects on activity in vitro provide a clearer view of the contributions of the active site functional groups.To better understand the mechanism of sinefungin inhibition of cap methylation, we determined the crystal structure of an Ecm1-sinefungin binary complex, which revealed that sinefungin occupied a position similar to that observed for the AdoMet substrate and AdoHcy product in previous structures, although sinefungin makes additional contacts with Ecm1 main-chain and side-chain atoms. We report that S. cerevisiae Abd1 is inhibited potently by sinefungin and that the sensitivity of budding yeast to growth inhibition by the drug is diminished when Abd1 is overexpressed. These results suggest that the cap methylation is a principal target of sinefungin action in vivo.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—[3H-CH3]AdoMet was purchased from Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences.

The inserts were sequenced completely to exclude the acquisition of unwanted mutations during amplification and cloning. The in vivo activity of the mutated ABD1 alleles was tested by plasmid shuffle (24Fabrega C. Hausmann S. Shen V. Shuman S. Lima C.D. Mol.

Yeast strain YBS40 (abd1::hisG p360-ABD1[CEN URA3 ABD1]) was transformed with CEN TRP1 plasmids containing the wild-type and mutant alleles of ECM1. Trp+ isolates were selected and then streaked on agar plates containing 0.75 mg/ml 5-fluoroorotic acid. Growth was scored after 7 days of incubation at 25°, 30°, and 37 °C. Lethal mutants were those that failed to form colonies on 5-fluoroorotic acid at any temperature. Individual colonies of the viable ECM1 mutants were picked from the 5-fluoroorotic acid plate and transferred to YPD (yeast extract, peptone, dextrose) agar medium. Two isolates of each mutant were tested for growth on YPD agar at 25°, 30°, and 37 °C. Growth was assessed as follows: +++ indicates colony size indistinguishable from strains bearing wild-type ECM1; ++ denotes slightly reduced colony size; + indicates that only pinpoint colonies were formed; - indicates no growth.Mutational Effects on Ecm1 Function in Vitro—NdeI/BamHI fragments encoding Ecm1 mutants were excised from the respective p358-ECM1 plasmids and inserted into pET16b.

Molecular Cell. 2000; 5: 865-876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar) in E. coli BL21(DE3) CodonPlus RIL (Novagen) using a pET-based pSmt3-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). Cultures (10 liters) were grown at 37 °C in a Bioflo 3000 fermentor (New Brunswick Scientific) to an A600 of 3.0, then adjusted to 30 °C, supplemented with 0.75 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and incubated at 30 °C for 4 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 0.1% IGEPAL, 20% sucrose, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Cells were lysed by sonication, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. His6-Smt3-Abd1 was purified from the soluble extract by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid fast flow column chromatography (Qiagen). The His6-Smt3 tag was removed by treatment with the Smt3-specific protease Ulp1 (43Mossessova E. Lima C.D. Molecular Cell. 2000; 5: 865-876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Abd1 was purified free of the tag by gel filtration through a column of Superdex 200. Abd1 appeared homogeneous by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. The protein was concentrated to 10.5 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm DTT, and stored at -80 °C.Inhibition of Yeast Growth by Sinefungin—The CEN URA3 ABD1 plasmid in the S. cerevisiae YBS40 strain was replaced by p358-ABD1 (CEN TRP1 ABD1) or p132-ABD1 (CEN TRP1 ABD1) by plasmid shuffle. In p358-ABD1, methyltransferase expression is directed by the ABD1 promoter, whereas in p132-ABD1, methyltransferase expression is driven by the strong constitutive TPI1 promoter. Wild-type Abd1-expressing and “High-ABD1” yeast cells were grown in YPD medium to mid-log phase (A600 of 0.7 to 0.9) and ∼106 cells were spread on YPD agar plates (15-cm diameter). After incubation of the plates for 1 h at 30°C to allow the cell suspension to dry, 2-μl aliquots of aqueous solutions of sinefungin (125, 250, 500, or 1000 μm) were spotted on the agar plates. Water alone was spotted as a control and resulted in no zone of growth inhibition. The plates were incubated for 2 days at 30 °C, and then photographed.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONNew Mutations in the Active Site of Ecm1—Amino acids that comprise the GTP binding pocket include Phe-141, His-144, Tyr-145, Pro-175, Phe-214, Glu-225, and Tyr-284 (Fig. 1A). We showed previously that Phe-141, which makes multiple van der Waals contacts with the cap guanine and ribose, is essential for Ecm1 function in yeast, i.e. the F141A mutation was unconditionally lethal (24Fabrega C. Hausmann S. Shen V. Shuman S. Lima C.D. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 77-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Here we tested the effects of replacing Phe-141 conservatively with leucine, isoleucine, valine, and histidine. The mutant ECM1 alleles were placed under control of the ABD1 promoter on a centromeric plasmid and assayed by plasmid shuffle for abd1Δ complementation (Table 1). The F141L strain grew as well as the wild-type ECM1 strain at all temperatures tested, signifying that an aromatic functional group was not essential for activity in vivo and that the van der Waals contacts of Phe-141 Cz (with the ribose C2′ and C3′ of guanosine), Cϵ1 (with the ribose C3′), and Cϵ2 (with the ribose C2′) observed in the crystal structure are not the critical interactions of this side chain. The isoleucine change resulted in a temperature-sensitive growth defect, whereby the F141I strain grew well at 25 and 30 °C but formed pinpoint colonies at 37 °C. The F141V and F141H strains also formed pinpoint colonies at 37 °C and displayed a slow growth phenotype at 30 °C as well. Thus, we surmise that an aliphatic branched amino acid at position 141 is the minimal requirement for Ecm1 activity and that the van der Waals contacts of Phe-141 Cδ2 (with the N3 atom of the guanine base), Cγ (with guanine C4), and Cβ (with guanine N7, C5, and C6) are functionally most relevant. This inference was reinforced by the finding that replacing Phe-141 with asparagine, which is nearly isosteric with leucine, resulted in unconditional lethality (Table 1). We infer from this result that the Oδ atom of asparagine was the deleterious factor, insofar as a histidine (to which Asn is partially isosteric, and which, like Asn, contains an Nδ atom) was able to support cell growth.Pro-175 makes a van der Waals contact from Cγ to the exocyclic N2 atom of the guanine base (Fig. 1A) and might thereby contribute to methyl acceptor specificity. However, we found presently that changing Pro-175 to Ala had no apparent effect on Ecm1 activity in yeast (Table 1). Given that guanine N2 makes multiple additional contacts to the enzyme (via Tyr-284 Cϵ2 and OH, Glu-225 Oϵ1, and Phe-214 Cδ2 and Cϵ2), it is likely that loss of any one contact will not abolish activity. Indeed, we found previously that the F214A, E225A, and Y284A yeast mutants are viable, albeit unable to grow at 37 °C (Table 1) (24Fabrega C. Hausmann S. Shen V. Shuman S. Lima C.D. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 77-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar).His-144 donates a hydrogen bond from Nϵ to guanine O6 (Fig. 1A) and was initially thought to be a methyl acceptor specificity determinant. The findings that the H144A mutation had no effect on yeast growth at 25 or 30 °C, although it did slow growth at 37 °C (Table 1), cast doubt on this idea. It was suggested that the guanine O6 contact to His-144 and the water-mediated contact to the Tyr-145 hydroxyl might be functionally redundant. To address this issue presently, we constructed and tested a H144A/Y145F double mutant, which we found to be fully functional in yeast (Table 1). Thus, it seems that neither of the hydrogen-bonding interactions with the guanine O6 seen in the crystal structure are essential for cap methyltransferase activity in vivo. This is not to say that there is no structural basis for the guanine O6 specificity; rather, we suppose that it is the shape of the guanine-binding pocket into which the O6 atom fits that is the defining determinant. Indeed, the O6 atom is sandwiched between the Phe-141 main-chain carbonyl oxygen and the Glu-225 Oϵ2, which are located 3.1 Å from guanine O6 at positions roughly orthogonal to, and on opposite faces of, the plane of the purine base (Fig. 1A). Also, guanine O6 makes a van der Waals contact (4.1 Å) to the Tyr-145 Cϵ1 atom, which is located apical to the guanine 6-carbonyl. The Tyr-145 Cϵ1 contact was not essential per se, insofar as introducing leucine in place of Tyr-145 had no effect on yeast growth (Table 1). However, we found presently that an H144A/Y145L double mutant was defective in vivo, failing to grow at 37 °C, forming microcolonies at 30 °C, and growing slowly at 25 °C (Table 1). The pairwise comparison of the benign H144A/Y145F and severe H144A/Y145L alleles implicates the"

Paradoxically, acute expression of activated Ras in normal rat thyroid cells induced deregulated cell cycle progression and apoptosis. We investigated whether cell cycle progression was required for Ras-stimulated apoptosis. Ras increased CDK-2 activity following its introduction into quiescent cells. Apoptotic cells exhibited a sustained increase in CDK-2 activity, accompanied by the loss of CDK-2-associated p27. Blockade of Ras-induced CDK-2 activity and S phase entry via overexpression of p27 inhibited apoptosis.

Rather, Ras-expressing thyroid cells progressed into S and G2 phases and evoked a checkpoint response characterized by the activation of ATR. Ras-stimulated ATR activity, as evidenced by Chk1 and p53 phosphorylation, was blocked by p27, suggesting that cell cycle progression triggers checkpoint activation, likely as a consequence of replication stress. These data reveal that Ras is capable of inducing a DNA damage response with characteristics similar to those reported in precancerous lesions.

Ras is perhaps best known for its ability to induce malignant transformation through the stimulation of cell proliferation, invasion, metastasis, angiogenesis, genomic instability, and cell survival (1Campbell P.M.

Interestingly, in contrast to the induction of G1 phase growth arrest observed in primary human diploid or murine embryonic fibroblasts (18Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W. Cell. 1997; 88: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3994) Google Scholar), retroviral-mediated expression of activated Ras stimulates sustained proliferation in primary human thyrocytes, cells that normally fail to proliferate in vitro (19Bond J.A.

The molecular mechanism through which Ras stimulates proliferation rather than growth arrest remains to be established but may be related to the inability of Ras to increase the expression of p16INK4a in human thyroid cells (20Jones C.J. Kipling D. Morris M. Hepburn P. Skinner J. Bounacer A. Wyllie F.S. Ivan M. Bartek J. Wynford-Thomas D. Bond J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5690-5699Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Normal rat thyroid cells share many features with human thyrocytes, including thyroid-stimulating hormone-dependent cell proliferation and differentiation. Continuous lines of rat thyroid cells have been used extensively to model Ras transformation in thyroid cells (21Meinkoth J.L. Cancer Treat. Res. 2004; 122: 131-148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inducible expression of activated Ras in rat thyroid PC-CL3 cells (22Shirokawa J.M. Elisei R. Knauf J.A. Hara T. Wang J. Saavedra H.I. Fagin J.A. Mol.

Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 450-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) stimulated cell cycle progression as expected but also induced apoptosis, a result difficult to reconcile with the high frequency of Ras mutations in human thyroid tumors. The ability of Ras to acutely stimulate cell proliferation and cell death in the same cell is reminiscent of the effects of the Myc oncoprotein (24Pelengaris S. Khan M. Evan G. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 764-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). Although unrestrained proliferation is a potent inducer of apoptotic and DNA damage cascades (25Harbour J.W. Dean D.C.

Zwicker J. Henglein B. Muller R. Ansorge W. Eilers M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3065-3076Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In this report, we investigated whether Ras independently regulates cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Strikingly, unlike the situation for Myc, Ras engages the apoptotic pathway through effects on the cell cycle. Cell Culture and Adenoviruses—Wistar rat thyroid cells were cultured in Coon's modified Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with bovine thyroid-stimulating hormone (1 milliunit/ml), insulin (10 μg/ml), calf serum (5%), and transferrin (5 μg/ml) as previously described (29Kupperman E. Wofford D. Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 96-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The cells were grown to 70% confluence and rendered quiescent by starvation in hormone, growth factor, and serum-free basal medium for 48 h. The quiescent cells were mock infected (given basal medium) or infected with adenoviruses for 16 h, the virus was removed, and the cells were maintained in basal medium for varying times. The morning after infection (16 h after the addition of virus) is referred to as day 1 post-infection, and the cells were collected in 24-h intervals thereafter (days 1–4).

Replication-defective adenoviruses expressing HA-tagged human H-Ras (cellular Ras or RasG12, activated Ras or RasV12, activated Ras impaired in membrane association or RasV12A186, and a Ras effector domain mutant, RasV12G37) were constructed using the AdEasy Vector System (Q-Biogene, Carlsbad, CA). HA-RasV12A186 was created by mutating cysteine 186 to alanine in the CAAX box of RasV12 using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The pShuttle vector containing an HA tag was kindly provided by Dr. M. Kazanietz (Department of Pharmacology, University of Pennsylvania). Ras cDNAs were amplified from pDCR-Ras vectors kindly provided by Dr. M. White (Department of Cell Biology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center) and cloned into EcoRV and XhoI sites of HA-pShuttle. Following recombination with adenoviral DNA in BJ5183 cells, recombinants were transfected into QBI-293A cells, plaque-purified, and propagated as per the manufacturer. Titrations were performed in Wistar rat thyroid cells to derive conditions sufficient to infect >90% of the cells. RasV12 (or RasL61) was infected at 5000 particles/cell (unless otherwise noted), and the other Ras mutants were infected at doses that resulted in equal levels of Ras expression. The RasL61 adenovirus was a kind gift from Dr. J. Nevins (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Duke University) and used as previously described (23Cheng G. Lewis A.E. Meinkoth J.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 450-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The p27 adenovirus was a generous gift from Dr. P. Seth (Department of Medicine, Northwestern University) and used at 10,000–20,000 particles/cell. The HPV-E7 adenovirus was a kind gift from Dr. M. Herlyn (Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA) and used at 5000 particles/cell. Immunostaining—Cells plated on coverslips were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min, permeabilized in 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and incubated with primary and secondary antibodies for 1 h at 37 °C. The nuclei were stained with DAPI (Sigma). The images were captured using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope fitted with a Hamamatsu ORCA-ER digital camera and analyzed using Zeiss-Axio Vision 4.2 software. Equal exposure times and magnifications were used for images within an experiment. At least 200 cells/condition/experiment were counted from random fields. Immunostaining of HA-Ras was assessed using HA ascites generously provided by Dr. J. Field (Department of Pharmacology, University of Pennsylvania). Cleaved caspase-3 was examined using the Asp-175 antibody that reacts only with the active, cleaved form of caspase-3 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA; number 9661). The percentage of active caspase-3-positive cells was determined by counting the number of DAPI-positive nuclei that reacted with the active caspase-3 antibody. The cells were scored in a blinded fashion by two observers. DNA Laddering—Cells harvested in 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Triton X-100 were incubated on ice for 10 min. A sample of total DNA was recovered, and the remaining cell homogenate was pelleted at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and low molecular weight DNA was isolated as described in (30Santiago-Walker A.E. Fikaris A.J. Kao G.D. Brown E.J. Kazanietz M.G. Meinkoth J.L. J. Biol.

Low molecular weight DNA was analyzed by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels and imaged using GelDoc XR and Quantity One 4.5.2 software (Bio-Rad).

The membranes were probed with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C and with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) for 1 h at room temperature. The proteins were detected via chemiluminescence using the FUJI LAS-3000 system.

CDK-2 (M2, sc-163), cyclin A (C-19, sc-596), HPV16-E7 (ED17, sc-6981), actin (C-11, sc-1615), and ERK2 (C-14, sc-154) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. The p27 antibody (number 610241) was from BD Pharmingen (San Jose, CA). The pan-Ras antibody (Ab-4) (number OP41) was from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). CDK-2 Activity—CDK-2 activity was measured in vitro using histone H1 as substrate as described in Ref. 31Lewis A.E. Fikaris A.J. Prendergast G.V. Meinkoth J.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 2321-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar. When analyzed in detached cells, pooled cells from four 100-mm plates were used to precipitate CDK-2 (sc-163G; Santa Cruz) from equal amounts of cell protein as in total and adherent cells. DNA Synthesis—DNA synthesis was examined by BrdUrd incorporation as described in Ref. 31Lewis A.E. Fikaris A.J. Prendergast G.V. Meinkoth J.L. Mol.

FACS Analysis for DNA Content—Detached and adherent cells were collected, fixed, treated with 200 units/ml RNase, stained with 0.1 mg/ml propidium iodide, and subjected to FACS analysis as described in Ref. 30Santiago-Walker A.E.

Ras-induced Apoptosis Is Caspase-mediated—We previously reported that acute expression of H-RasL61 induced cell cycle progression and apoptosis in Wistar rat thyroid cells, a continuous line of rat thyroid cells (23Cheng G. Lewis A.E. Meinkoth J.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 450-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The goal of the present studies was to assess the potential of Ras to engage cell death pathways through effects on the cell cycle. Adenoviruses expressing HA-tagged cellular (Ras G12), activated (RasV12), and activated mutant Ras impaired in membrane localization (RasV12A186) were generated (see “Experimental Procedures”). Conditions were derived where more than 90% of the cells expressed Ras on day 4 post-infection (RasV12 shown in Fig. 1A). DAPI staining of nuclei revealed marked alterations in nuclear size and structure as well as a substantial decrease in cell number over time in RasV12-infected cells (Fig. 1A, DAPI). To confirm that cell loss reflected apoptosis, RasV12-infected cells were analyzed for DNA fragmentation and caspase activation, hallmarks of apoptotic cell death. As expected, RasV12-infected cells exhibited DNA laddering (Fig. 1, B and C). Cell surface Annexin V staining, a marker expressed on early apoptotic cells, was observed beginning at day 3 post-infection (data not shown). Importantly, expression of similar levels of RasG12 or RasV12A186 failed to stimulate DNA laddering (Fig. 1B). Western blotting using an antibody that recognizes both intact procaspase-3 (33 kDa) and cleaved, active caspase-3 (17 kDa) revealed procaspase-3 cleavage in cells infected with RasV12, but not RasG12 or RasV12A186 (Fig. 1D). These data were corroborated using an antibody that specifically recognizes cleaved caspase-3 in immunostaining experiments (Fig. 1F). Inclusion of the pan caspase inhibitor QVD blocked procaspase-3 cleavage as expected (Fig. 1, E and F) and prevented DNA laddering (Fig. 1C). QVD also blocked procaspase-3 cleavage and DNA laddering stimulated by RasL61 (data not shown). These results extend our previous studies by showing that caspase-mediated apoptosis is a specific response to the expression of active, membrane-localized Ras. Ras Stimulates Unrestrained CDK-2 Activity in Detached Cells—To determine whether cells destined to die entered the cell cycle, effects on CDK-2 activity, a marker of G1-S phase cell cycle progression, were assessed. CDK-2 was immunoprecipitated from total cell lysates prepared from RasL61- or RasV12-infected cells, and kinase activity was measured in vitro. Both RasL61 and RasV12 (Fig. 2, A and C), but not RasG12 (Fig. 2C) or RasV12A186 (not shown), stimulated CDK-2 activity. CDK-2 activity was increased on day 2 post-infection (data not shown), a time that preceded apoptosis as assessed by the presence of floating cells or the induction of cell surface Annexin V, suggesting that Ras-induced CDK-2 activity culminates in apoptosis. To directly determine whether CDK-2 activity was increased in dying cells, CDK-2 activity was assessed in extracts prepared from separated populations of adherent versus detached cells. Both adherent (attached) and detached cells displayed high CDK-2 activity (Fig. 2A, top panel). Detached but not adherent cells exhibited procaspase-3 cleavage (Fig. 2B), indicating that the detached population contained apoptotic cells. ERK activity was increased in adherent and detached cells, documenting that CDK-2 activity in both populations was due to RasV12 (Fig. 2B). In further support of this, deprivation of attachment by trypsin-EDTA release failed to induce CDK-2 activity, 4A. J. Fikaris, unpublished data. and plating cells on agarose-coated dishes failed to induce apoptosis (32Cheng G. Meinkoth J.L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7334-7341Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Most importantly, CDK-2 activity was not impaired by QVD (Fig. 2C). Taken together, these data indicate that RasV12 stimulates CDK-2 activity in adherent cells that subsequently detach and that CDK-2 activity does not arise as a consequence of cell detachment or caspase-mediated cleavage events. To investigate the molecular basis for the high CDK-2 activity in detached cells, CDK-2 precipitates were analyzed for the presence of associated proteins. A modest but reproducible decrease in CDK-2-associated cyclin A was observed in detached cells (Fig. 2A, third panel). Furthermore, although p27 was associated with CDK-2 in adherent cells, it was not present in CDK-2 precipitates prepared from detached cells (Fig. 2A, bottom panel). Further examination of p27 levels revealed the presence of p27 cleavage products selectively in lysates prepared from detached cells (Fig. 2D, lower panels). Similar effects were observed for cyclin A (Fig. 2D). Cleavage of cyclin A to a nondegradable fragment (33Stack J.H. Newport J.W. Development. 1997; 124: 3185-3195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has been reported to play a role in apoptosis (34Finkielstein C.V. Chen L.G. Maller J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38476-38485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Cleavage of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p27 and p21 in apoptotic cells has also been reported (35Levkau B. Koyama H. Raines E.W. Clurman B.E. Herren B. Orth K. Roberts J.M. Ross R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 553-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). These data provide two potential mechanisms through which RasV12 could enforce CDK-2 activity in dying cells, through removal of p27 from cyclin-CDK complexes and/or via cleavage of cyclin A. Ras Activates the Replication Stress Checkpoint—To ensure proper passage through the cell cycle and avoid the generation of genetically aberrant progeny, cells have in place strict surveillance mechanisms. In response to DNA damage and/or replication stress, checkpoint proteins delay cell cycle progression to facilitate repair, induce growth arrest, or stimulate apoptosis (36Kastan M.B. Bartek J. Nature. 2004; 432: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (2228) Google Scholar). Ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) and ATM and Rad-3-related (ATR) kinases are the pivotal responders to DNA damage and replication stress, respectively. Once activated, these phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like kinases phosphorylate and activate downstream effectors including the Chk1/2 kinases and p53 (36Kastan M.B. Bartek J. Nature. 2004; 432: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (2228) Google Scholar, 37Bartek J. Lukas C. Lukas J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 792-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 38Sancar A. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Unsal-Kacmaz K. Linn S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 39-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2557) Google Scholar). Because CDK-2 activity was sustained over days in RasV12-infected cells, we analyzed whether this response was sensed as replication stress. Using an antibody that specifically recognizes Chk1 phosphorylated at serine 345 by ATR (Chk1p-Ser345) (39Zhao H. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4129-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar), the effects of RasV12 on ATR activity were investigated. Chk1 phosphorylation was first apparent at day 2 and increased through day 4 post-infection, effects that were selective for membranelocalized, activated Ras (Fig. 3A). To corroborate these data, a second marker of ATR (and ATM) activity, phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15 (p53p-Ser15) (40Tibbetts R.S. Brumbaugh K.M. Williams J.M. Sarkaria J.N. Cliby W.A. Shieh S.Y. Taya Y. Prives C. Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar), was examined. RasV12 also stimulated serine 15 phosphorylation on p53 (Fig. 3A). The time course for Chk1 and p53 phosphorylation was similar to that for CDK-2 activity and preceded the induction of apoptosis. Importantly, QVD failed to impair Chk1 or p53 phosphorylation, eliminating the possibility that checkpoint activation was secondary to caspase-mediated DNA cleavage (Fig. 3B). These data suggest that sustained CDK-2 activity induced by Ras is sensed as replication stress and leads to apoptosis. To document that apoptosis was not an artifact of high levels of Ras expression (5Joneson T. Bar-Sagi D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5892-5901Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), the dose response for Ras-stimulated cell cycle progression, checkpoint activation, and apoptosis was compared. Importantly, the effects of RasV12 on cyclins A and B1 expression, procaspase-3 cleavage, and Chk1/p53 phosphorylation exhibited a similar response at each dose (Fig. 3C). Remarkably, even when expressed at levels similar to endogenous Ras in these cells, RasV12 induced cell cycle progression, checkpoint activation, and apoptosis. These data strongly suggest that the effects of Ras on cell cycle progression and apoptosis are intricately linked. Cell Cycle Progression Is Required for Checkpoint Activation and Apoptosis—To determine whether apoptosis was a consequence of sustained CDK-2 activity, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 was overexpressed. Conditions were derived where p27 was expressed at levels sufficient to block RasV12-stimulated CDK-2 activity (Fig. 4A). Under these conditions, p27 blocked RasV12-stimulated DNA synthesis (Fig. 4, B and C) and entry into the S phase (Fig. 4D). Furthermore, p27 blocked Rb phosphorylation at serines 807/811, sites of G1 cyclin/CDK activity, and prevented the induction of cyclins A and B1, effects that were induced selectively by active, membrane-localized Ras (Fig. 4E and not shown). Interestingly, overexpression of p27 reduced the number of RasV12-infected cells that exhibited procaspase-3 cleavage, as demonstrated by immunostaining for active caspase-3 (Fig. 5A). Western blotting confirmed that co-infection with p27 abolished procaspase-3 cleavage induced by RasV12 (Fig. 5B). Co-infection of p27 with RasV12 decreased the proportion of cells with hypodiploid DNA content (Fig. 5C) and abolished DNA laddering (Fig. 5D). To further examine the relationship between cell cycle progression and apoptosis, an activated Ras mutant containing a point mutation within the effector loop, RasV12G37 (41White M.A. Nicolette C. Minden A. Polverino A. Van Aelst L. Karin M. Wigler M.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 533-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar), was utilized. When expressed acutely, RasV12G37 failed to induce the expression of cyclins A and B1 (Fig. 5E). Interestingly, RasV12G37 also failed to induce apoptosis, as assessed by procaspase-3 cleavage (Fig. 5E). Taken together, these data suggest that cell cycle entry is an obligate prerequisite to apoptosis. To determine whether checkpoint activation induced by Ras resulted from replication stress, we examined whether the blockade of cell cycle progression impaired checkpoint activation. Co-infection of p27 with RasV12 inhibited Chk1 and p53 phosphorylation (Fig. 5F). These data indicate that checkpoint activation requires cell cycle entry, supporting the notion that checkpoint activation and apoptosis arise as consequences of replication stress. In further support of this idea, RasV12 stimulated cell cycle progression, checkpoint activation, and apoptosis in a second line of rat thyroid cells (PC-Cl3 cells), and these effects were blocked by overexpression of p27 (data not shown). Rb Deregulation Is Sufficient to Stimulate Replication Stress and Apoptosis in Thyroid Cells—Given that RasV12-induced apoptosis appeared to arise as a consequence of sustained mitogenic signaling, we explored whether forced cell cycle progression induced by human papillomavirus type 16-E7 (HPV-E7) protein was sufficient to stimulate apoptosis. HPV-E7 deregulates the cell cycle through its ability to bind and inactivate Rb family proteins and the Cip/Kip family of CDK inhibitors (42Jones D.L. Munger K. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1996; 7: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Expression of HPV-E7 in quiescent thyroid cells (Fig. 6A, lower panel) stimulated Rb phosphorylation, the expression of cyclins A and B1 (Fig. 6A, upper panels), and cell cycle progression into S phase (Fig. 6B) as early as day 2 post-infection. HPV-E7 also increased the proportion of cells with hypodiploid DNA content and stimulated caspase-mediated DNA fragmentation and procaspase-3 cleavage (Fig. 6, C–E) with a t"
https://openalex.org/W1971695918,"The tobacco gene NtWIN4 (Nicotiana tabacum wound-induced clone 4) is transiently up-regulated in response not only to wounding but also to pathogen attack. NtWIN4 encodes a putative basic helix-loop-helix protein with an apparent molecular mass of 28 kDa that exhibited clear nuclear transcription repression activity in Dual-Luciferase assays. However, immunoblotting indicated the existence of a 17-kDa form of NtWIN4 localized exclusively in tobacco leaf chloroplasts. Subsequent peptide dissection analyses with green fluorescent protein fusions revealed that a polypeptide of 81 amino acids starting at position 13 from the N terminus is maximally necessary for this localization. Further fine dissection analysis strongly suggested that the protein actually begins at the second Met located at position 27, yielding a signal peptide of 67 amino acids. However, the last C-terminal 15 amino acids overlap with the conserved basic region critical for DNA binding, so NtWIN4 presumably does not function as a transcription factor in planta. Transgenic tobacco plants constitutively overexpressing NtWIN4 demonstrated mortality with abnormal features, including albinism, and transient expression upon agroinfiltration resulted in distinct necrosis with a sharp decrease in chlorophyll content, consistent with the phenomenon known as chlorosis. Transgenic RNA interference tobacco plants exhibited reduced hypersensitive cell death, showing delayed tissue necrosis upon pathogen infection. These results suggest that NtWIN4 arose by divergence, becoming a chloroplast-resident factor from a nuclear transcriptional repressor by obtaining a transit peptide sequence, and that, upon translocation, it interacts with chloroplast components to induce hypersensitive cell death through chloroplast disruption, thereby contributing to plant stress responses.

Higher plants are constantly exposed to diverse environmental stresses, including physical wounding. Under natural conditions, the major cause is grazing by herbivores, which continuously damages tissues, occasionally resulting in whole plant death after secondary infection by pathogens. To cope with this problem, plants have evolved a variety of self-defense mechanisms, including production of proteins such as proteinase inhibitors and of signaling components such as jasmonate and systemin (1Green T.R. Ryan C.A. Science. 1972; 175: 776-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar, 2Farmer E.E. Ryan C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Wound signals are quickly transmitted from damaged cells to the whole plant, allowing elaboration of a defense reaction by transcriptionally up- and/or down-regulating a number of genes (4Schilmiller A.L. Howe G.A. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2005; 8: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Examples are proteinase inhibitors against insect feeding, extensions for reinforcement of cell walls, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (EC 4.3.1.5) and chalcone synthase (EC 2.3.1.74) for phenylpropanoid synthesis, and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase and aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase for ethylene synthesis (1Green T.R.

However, their functions have not been completely clarified.One of the phenotypic hallmarks of wounding is tissue necrosis. Cells at damaged areas rapidly die, thereby forming a physical barrier to secondary injury such as pathogen attack. Biochemically, chlorophyll degradation is one characteristic symptom of wounding, this being called chlorosis (7Buchanan B.B. Gruissem W. Jones R.L. Biochemistry & Molecular Biology of Plants. American Society of Plant Physiologists, Rockville, MD2000Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that this occurs not only by wounding but also during pathogen responses, suggesting that chlorophyll degradation is a common response in stressed plants. For example, the photosystem II complex was reported to be disrupted during the hypersensitive response upon inoculation of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) 2The abbreviations used are: TMV, tobacco mosaic virus; bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; RT, reverse transcription; Gal4BD, Gal4 DNA-binding domain; CaMV, cauliflower mosaic virus; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid.2The abbreviations used are: TMV, tobacco mosaic virus; bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; RT, reverse transcription; Gal4BD, Gal4 DNA-binding domain; CaMV, cauliflower mosaic virus; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. (8Culver J.N. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 2002; 40: 287-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Accumulation of TMV coat proteins in chloroplasts has been suggested to correlate with severe chlorosis (8Culver J.N. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 2002; 40: 287-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Another example of a chloroplast protein involved in the hypersensitive response is chloroplast-resident FtsH, a member of the AAA group of proteins, the reduction of which results in acceleration of the hypersensitive response in tobacco plants (9Seo S. Okamoto M. Iwai T. Iwano M. Fukui K. Isogai A. Nakajima N. Ohashi Y. Plant Cell. 2002; 12: 917-932Google Scholar). These observations indicate a close correlation between disruption of chloroplast function, including chlorosis, and the hypersensitive response, although the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be determined.The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins form a superfamily of nuclear transcription factors characterized by the presence of a bHLH domain, a motif of ∼60 amino acids with two functional regions involved in DNA binding and dimerization (10Murre C. McCaw P.S. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 56: 777-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1837) Google Scholar, 11Ferre-D'Amare A.R. Pognonec P. Roeder R.G. Burley S.K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 180-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The basic region located at the N-terminal end of the domain binds to a consensus hexanucleotide E box (CANNTG), and the helix-loop-helix region at the C-terminal end of the domain functions to form homo- and/or heterodimers (10Murre C. McCaw P.S. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 56: 777-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1837) Google Scholar, 11Ferre-D'Amare A.R. Pognonec P. Roeder R.G. Burley S.K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 180-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In plants, the maize LC protein is the first reported bHLH family member and is involved in regulation of anthocyanin synthesis (12Ludwig S.R. Habera L.F. Dellaporta S.L. Wessler S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7092-7096Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Subsequent analyses of the Arabidopsis genome identified 147 genes encoding bHLH proteins, so this constitutes the largest transcription factor family (13Heim M.A. Jacoby M. Werber M. Martin C. Weisshaar B. Bailey P.C. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2003; 20: 735-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 14Toledo-Ortiz G. Huq E. Quail P.H. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 1749-1770Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). The members are considered to be important regulatory factors in nuclear transcriptional networks, like their mammalian counterparts. However, the exact biological functions of the majority of plant bHLH proteins remain to be determined.During the past decade, we have screened genes for which transcripts accumulate immediately after wound stress by fluorescence differential display and have so far isolated >50 clones (15Hara K. Yagi M. Koizumi N. Kusano T. Sano H. Plant Cell Physiol. 2000; 41: 684-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). 3K. Hara, C. Ueda, H. Ohya, and H. Sano, unpublished data.3K. Hara, C. Ueda, H. Ohya, and H. Sano, unpublished data. Although their identities are diverse, the majority of transcripts were found to accumulate within1hof mechanical injury, suggesting critical roles in defense responses. In this study, one particular clone was subjected to further characterization because of its specific feature of encoding a novel bHLH protein localized in chloroplasts and contributing to the hypersensitive response through chlorosis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlant Materials and Treatment—Tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacum cv. Xanthi NC) were grown in soil in a growth cabinet at 23 °C under a 14-h light/10-h dark photo cycle. Protoplasts of the above-described plants and tobacco BY2 (Bright Yellow 2) and Arabidopsis MM2d cells were maintained continuously in the dark at 23 °C in suspension culture using modified Linsmaier and Skoog medium (16Nagata T. Okada K. Takabe I. Matsui C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1981; 184: 161-165Crossref Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Wound stress was applied by cutting mature leaves of N. tabacum with a pair of scissors or a leaf punch. Wounded (local) and adjacent upper unwounded (systemic) leaves were harvested at appropriate time points. For TMV infection, leaves of 2-month-old wild-type plants were inoculated with TMV (10 μg/ml) and incubated at 30 °C under continuous light for 48 h and then at 20 °C (temperature shift) as described previously (17Yoda H. Ogawa M. Yamaguchi Y. Koizumi N. Sano H. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2002; 267: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Samples were harvested at appropriate time points. For treatment with stress-signaling molecules, leaf disc samples were transferred into a solution containing 500 μm salicylic acid, 50 μm methyljasmonic acid, 100 μm ethephone (for ethylene production), or 10 mm hydrogen peroxide and harvested after 12 h. For time course analyses, healthy leaves were treated with 50 μm methyljasmonic acid or 100 μm paraquat and harvested at appropriate time points. Bacterial infection was performed as reported previously (18Sugimoto M. Yamaguchi Y. Nakamura K. Tatsumi Y. Sano H. Plant Mol. Biol. 2004; 56: 973-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) with inoculation of Pseudomonas syringae by infiltration, followed by observation after 48 h.Isolation of NtWIN4 cDNA—A DNA fragment encoding NtWIN4 was initially obtained from a cDNA population derived from wounded tobacco leaves by fluorescence differential display (15Hara K. Yagi M. Koizumi N. Kusano T. Sano H. Plant Cell Physiol. 2000; 41: 684-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The full-length cDNA sequence was successively isolated by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) using primer 5′-AGAAGAGACGAAGGTGCTTTTTCCAG-3′ and a Marathon cDNA amplification kit (Clontech) and by the thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR method (19Liu Y.G. Whittier R.F. Genomics. 1995; 253: 674-681Crossref Scopus (1001) Google Scholar) using three thermal asymmetric interlaced primers (5′-NGTCGASWGANAWGA-3′, 5′-GTNCGASWCANAWGTT-3′, and 5′-WGTGNAGWANCANAGA-3′) and three NtWIN4 primers (5′-CCATTGGGAGCAATTTATGCAAATCCAAAT-3′, 5′-CTCCATCATCCTCTTGTTCATGTTC-CGATG-3′, and 5′-TCGCCGATACATTTCCATAGCCAGAAACTC-3′). The nucleotide sequence of the isolated DNA was determined for both strands with a BigDye terminator sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems). The 5′ terminus was determined by 5′-RACE with primer 5′-ATGATTCGCCGATACATTTCCA-3′ (nucleotides 161-182 from the 5′-end).DNA and RNA Analyses—Genomic DNA was isolated from green leaves by the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide method (20Murray M.G. Thompson W.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 4321-4325Crossref PubMed Scopus (9200) Google Scholar) with modifications, and a 20-μg aliquot was digested with one of a series of restriction enzymes: BamHI, EcoRV, or HindIII. Total RNA was isolated by the aurintricarboxylic acid method (21Gonzalez R.G. Haxo R.S. Schleich T. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 4299-4303Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and DNA and RNA gel blot hybridization was performed as described previously (22Tamura T. Hara K. Yamaguchi Y. Koizumi N. Sano H. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 454-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) using an NtWIN4 cDNA fragment as the probe. For PCR and reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analyses, NtWIN4 genomic and cDNA fragments were amplified by PCR with Ex Taq DNA polymerase (Takara, Ohtsu, Japan) using primers 5′-GCTCTCGAGATGAATCAAAGTGCTTTTGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCACCCATGGGTTCGTTCTGTGGCTGAAG-3′ (reverse).Protein Analyses—Tobacco leaves were ground in liquid nitrogen in a mortar; mixed with isolation buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 0.05% (w/v) Tween 20, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin; and homogenized. After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min to remove insoluble debris, crude extracts were directly used for Western blot hybridization. After fractionation by SDS-PAGE, proteins were electronically transferred onto cellulose membranes (Immobilon-N, Millipore, Bedford, MA), and NtWIN4 was detected with rabbit antibodies raised against a synthetic peptide (MIKERIRREKQKQSY) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies (Bio-Rad). Fractionation of cytoplasmic, mitochondrial, and chloroplast fractions was performed as described (23Nakamura T. Yamaguchi Y. Sano H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5621-5630Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 24Yasuno R. Wada H. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 935-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 25Fan L. Zheng S. Cui D.

Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).Nuclear Transcription Assays—The Gal4BD-NtWIN4 and Gal4BD-At5g43650 effector plasmids were constructed by fusing a cDNA encoding NtWIN4 or At5g43650, respectively, with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (Gal4BD) in a yy64 vector, a derivative of pMA560 (27Yamamoto Y.Y. Deng X.Y. Plant Biotechnol. 1998; 15: 217-220Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). NtWIN4 and At5g43650 were thus subcloned into the BglII and SalI sites of yy64, respectively. As an effector control, the yy64 vector alone was used. The reporter plasmid (yy96) contains a luciferase gene placed under the control of the Gal4-binding site (27Yamamoto Y.Y. Deng X.Y. Plant Biotechnol. 1998; 15: 217-220Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). An internal control plasmid containing a Renilla luciferase gene placed under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter was used to normalize for differences in bombardment efficiency. Five-day-old BY2 and MM2d cells were plated on 1/2× Murashige-Skoog agar and bombarded with plasmids (effector/reporter/reference = 2:2:1) coated on a 1.0-μm microcarrier under a vacuum of 28 inches of mercury using a helium pressure of 1100 p.s.i. (PDS-1000, Bio-Rad). Cells were placed 6 cm from the stopping screen. After bombardment, they were incubated in the dark at 28 °C for 24 h. Luciferase and Renilla luciferase activities were assayed using a Dual-Luciferase assay kit (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Chemiluminescence was measured using a Lumat LB9507 luminometer (Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Germany).Epifluorescence Analyses—Full-length or partial cDNA regions of NtWIN4 were subcloned into the SalI/NcoI sites of a CaMV 35S-sGFP(S65T)-NOS vector, harboring a synthetic gene for improved green fluorescent protein (GFP) S65T driven by the CaMV 35S promoter and the NOS terminator (28Chiu W.-l.

Onion epidermal cell layers were bombarded with gold particles (Bio-Rad) coated with appropriate vector constructs; and after incubation at 28 °C for 6-12 h in the dark, samples were viewed under a microscope (Olympus Provis AX70 and Leica MZ FLIII) equipped with a fluorescence module.Transgenic and Agroinfiltration Analyses—A cDNA fragment encoding NtWIN4-(27-247) was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the BamHI/SacI sites of pBI121 (Clontech). The resulting plasmid, pBI-NtWIN4-(27-247), was transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain LBA4404 (29Hiei Y. Ohta S. Komari T. Kumashiro T. Plant J. 1994; 6: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (2809) Google Scholar) and used for stable transformation of tobacco as described previously (30Uefuji H. Tatsumi Y. Morimoto M. Kaothien-Nakayama P. Ogita S. Sano H. Plant Mol. Biol. 2005; 59: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For agroinfiltration, A. tumefaciens LBA4404 transformed with pBI-NtWIN4-(27-247) was grown on an LB agar plate for 2 days in the dark and suspended in a solution containing 10 mm MES-NaOH (pH 5.5) and 200 μm acetosyringone to give an absorbance of 0.5 at 600 nm. The bacterial solution was directly infiltrated into a leaf segment as described (31Ueda H. Yamaguchi Y. Sano H. Plant Mol. Biol. 2006; 61: 31-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The chlorophyll contents in infiltrated regions were measured using a SPAD-502 chlorophyll meter (Minolta, Tokyo, Japan). Chlorophyll fluorescence was measured with a MINI-PAM pulse amplitude-modulated fluorometer (Heinz Walz GmbH, Effeltrich, Germany). The minimal chlorophyll fluorescence at the open photosystem II center (Fo) was determined by measuring light at a light intensity of 0.05-0.1 μmol photons m-2 s-1. A saturating pulse of white light (800 ms, 8000 μmol photons m-2 s-1) was applied to determine the maximal chlorophyll fluorescence at the closed photosystem II center in the dark (Fm). The maximal quantum yield of photosystem II was calculated by the following equation: (Fm - Fo)/Fm.RESULTSIsolation of NtWIN4—One clone of >50 genes identified by fluorescence differential display activated immediately after mechanical wounding in tobacco leaves (15Hara K. Yagi M. Koizumi N. Kusano T. Sano H. Plant Cell Physiol. 2000; 41: 684-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), tentatively named NtWIN4 (Nicotiana tabacum wound-induced clone 4), was further characterized in this study. Determination of its full-length sequence by 5′-RACE yielded a 949-bp cDNA. NtWIN4 transcripts transiently accumulated only in local leaves within 30 min after wounding, reaching maximal levels at 1 h and declining thereafter (Fig. 1A). RT-PCR indicated NtWIN4 to be constitutively expressed at a low level even in unwounded leaves (Fig. 1B), suggesting a basic function. The copy number of NtWIN4 in the genome of N. tabacum was estimated by Southern blot analysis by digesting genomic DNA with BamHI or HindIII, for which sites are not present in the NtWIN4 cDNA probe sequence. Single fragments of 10 and 7 kb, respectively, were yielded (Fig. 1C). Genomic DNA was also digested with EcoRV, for which two sites exist 132 bp apart in the center of the second intron of the NtWIN4 genome; and two fragments of 9 and 3.2 kb were clearly identified (Fig. 1C). These results all point to a single copy of the NtWIN4 gene in the N. tabacum genome.Transcription Repression Activity—Full-length NtWIN4 was found to encode a protein of 247 amino acids with an apparent molecular mass of 28.7 kDa (Fig. 2A). A data base search demonstrated possession of a bHLH motif, characteristic of a transcription factor. A PHIBLAST homology search indicated close similarity in the bHLH motif and C-terminal region to proteins from Arabidopsis (At5g43650) and rice (OJ1365_D05) (Fig. 2A). To test whether or not the NtWIN4 and At5g43650 proteins exhibit transcriptional activity, nuclear transcription assays were carried out in vivo by the Dual-Luciferase assay method. Effector constructs of Gal4BD-NtWIN4 and Gal4BD-At5g43650 were co-bombarded with a reporter plasmid and a reference plasmid into tobacco BY2 and Arabidopsis MM2d cells, respectively. The results showed that the Gal4BD-NtWIN4 and Gal4BD-At5g43650 effector constructs suppressed luciferase activity to a level one-third that of the Gal4BD control (Fig. 2C). The results indicate that the NtWIN4 and At5g43650 proteins possess transcription repression activity in the nucleus, suggesting that their structures confer common functions.FIGURE 2Properties of NtWIN4. A, comparison of amino acid sequences. Alignment of NtWIN4, At5g43650 (A. thaliana), and OJ1365_D05.18 (Oryza sativa) was performed with the ClustalW program.

C, transcription activity assay results. Effector constructs encoding Gal4BD-NtWIN4 or Gal4BD-At5g43650 were co-bombarded with the reporter and reference plasmids into 7-day-old BY2 or MM2d cells, respectively. Gal4BD was applied as the effector control. The luciferase (Luc) activity of each type of transformant was normalized to the respective Renilla luciferase (R-Luc) activity. The relative luciferase activity was calculated by dividing the luciferase activity of each clone by that of the clone containing the Gal4BD effector construct (triplicate experiments).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Cellular Localization—To confirm nuclear localization, GFP was fused to the C terminus of NtWIN4 or At5g43650 and assayed in onion epidermal cell layers after particle bombardment. GFP fluorescence from both NtWIN4-GFP and At5g43650-GFP resembled that from the GFP-only control, suggesting both to be localized in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus (Fig. 3A). To verify this result, the exact localization of NtWIN4 was biochemically examined using antibodies raised against synthetic peptides. First, total proteins were extracted from tobacco leaf tissues, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to immunoblot staining. A clear single signal was found at the 17 kDa, suggesting the native form of NtWIN4 to be 17 kDa (Fig. 3B). This was confirmed by an increase in the 17-kDa fraction upon wounding of leaf tissues, showing maximal levels after 1 h (Fig. 3C), the pattern being consistent with that of transcript accumulation (Fig. 1A). Second, cellular components were fractionated and subjected to immunoassay. When the cytoplasm, mitochondria, and chloroplasts were mechanically separated and analyzed with antibodies, 17-kDa NtWIN4 was detected in fractions containing total proteins and chloroplasts, but not in cytoplasmic and mitochondrial fractions (Fig. 3D). The chloroplast fraction was further examined for purity with control antibodies against compartment-specific proteins: the chloroplast-resident large subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase and nucleus-specific DRM (domains-rearranged methyltransferase) (32Wada Y. Ohya H. Yamaguchi Y. Koizumi N. Sano H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42386-42393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and cytoplasm-specific phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase. It was evident that the chloroplast fraction did not contain any contaminating nuclear fractions (Fig. 3E). These results showed native NtWIN4 to be 17 kDa and exclusively localized in chloroplasts. No molecular species of 28-kDa NtWIN4 was detectable in any fraction of tobacco plants; and therefore, GFP analyses with an artificially constructed full-length 28-kDa protein (Fig. 3A) could not show the exact localization of native NtWIN4. However, because the computer-predicted molecular mass of NtWIN4 is 28.7 kDa, processing must occur in planta, facilitating movement into chloroplasts. Subsequently, the N terminus of NtWIN4 was successively truncated to identify the signal peptide for chloroplast import by GFP assay. When beginning at the second Met at position 27, the protein was distinctly incorporated into plastids, but not into mitochondria or peroxisomes (Fig. 3F). Thus, the chloroplast transit signal is located in peptides lacking the first 26 amino acids; and therefore, additional analyses were performed with the protein beginning at the second Met, NtWIN4-(27-247) (Table 1). To determine whether the Arabidopsis counterpart contains such a transit signal, a mutant protein lacking the first 30 amino acids (At5g43650-(31-114)) was constructed for GFP fusion, although the native At5g43650 protein does not possess the second Met at the position corresponding to NtWIN4. The results clearly showed At5g43650-(31-114) to be localized in plastids (Fig. 3F), suggesting that amino acid sequences that are potentially able to serve as signals for plastid localization are conserved among NtWIN4 ortholog proteins.FIGURE 3Cellular localization. A, localization of full-length NtWIN4. NtWIN4-(1-247)-GFP and At5g43650-(1-247)-GFP fusion proteins were transiently expressed in onion epidermal cells (left and middle panels, respectively). GFP alone was used as a control (right panel). B, identification of NtWIN4 protein. Crude extracts of wounded tobacco leaves (lanes 2 and 3) were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) (left panel) and then subjected to immunoblot hybridization using an antibody raised against an NtWIN4 peptide (right panel). Protein size markers were fractionated in parallel (lane 1). The positions of the large (RBCL) and small (RBCS) subunits of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase are indicated by arrows. The arrowhead indicates NtWIN4. C, time course analysis of NtWIN4 protein accumulation. Healthy leaves were wounded and harvested at the indicated time points to extract crude proteins, which were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot hybridization. The positions of the large and small subunits of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase are indicated by arrows, and NtWIN4 is indicated by the arrowhead. Equal loading of proteins was monitored with the large subunit stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. D, fractionation of cellular components. Crude extracts were subjected to gradient centrifugation, and isolated cytoplasmic, mitochondrial, and chloroplast fractions were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot hybridization with anti-NtWIN4 antibodies. The arrowhead indicates the position of NtWIN4. E, purity verification. Total cell and chloroplast fractions were analyzed by immunoblot hybridization using antibodies against compartment-specific proteins: the large subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (chloroplast), DRM (nucleus), and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC; cytoplasm). F, plastid localization of NtWIN4-(27-247) and At5g43650-(31-114). Upper panel, 47 amino acids at the N termini of NtWIN4 and At5g43650 are shown. The second Met at position 27 in NtWIN4 (closed arrowhead) and Val at position 30 in At5g43650 (open arrowhead) are indicated. Lower panels, onion epidermal cell layers were bombarded with NtWIN4-(27-247)-GFP or At5g43650-(31-114)-GFP, and fluorescence was observed. The controls used were AtCYSC1-GFP (mitochondria) (63Yamaguchi Y. Nakamura T. Kusano T. Sano H.

SHB (Src homology 2 protein in β-cells) is an adapter protein previously found to be involved in ES cell differentiation to mesoderm. To further study the role of SHB in this context, we have established ES cell lines deficient for one (SHB+/-) or both SHB alleles (SHB-/-). Differentiating embryoid bodies (EBs) derived from these ES cell lines were used for gene expression analysis. Alternatively, EBs were stained for the blood vessel marker CD31. For hematopoietic differentiation, EBs were differentiated in methylcellulose. SHB-/- EBs exhibited delayed down-regulation of the early mesodermal marker Brachyury. Later mesodermal markers relatively specific for the hematopoietic, vascular, and cardiac lineages were expressed at lower levels on day 6 or 8 of differentiation in EBs lacking SHB. The expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 and fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 was also reduced in SHB-/- EBs. SHB-/- EBs demonstrated impaired blood vessel formation after vascular endothelial growth factor stimulation. In addition, the SHB-/- ES cells formed fewer blood cell colonies than SHB+/+ ES cells. It is concluded that SHB is required for appropriate hematopoietic and vascular differentiation and that delayed down-regulation of Brachyury expression may play a role in this context.

Definitive mesoderm and endoderm both arise from the primitive streak during gastrulation. An entity named mesendoderm representing a transitory state in mesodermal and endodermal development has been identified (1Kimelman D. Griffin K.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 350-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Several factors have been shown to be involved in the commitment of mesodermal and endodermal lineages during this stage of development (2Vallier L. Reynolds D. Pedersen R.A. Dev. Biol. 2004; 275: 403-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 3Tada S. Era T. Furusawa C. Sakurai H. Nishikawa S. Kinoshita M. Nakao K. Chiba T.

Blood. 1996; 88: 3720-3730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the precise mechanism by which they exert their action remains elusive. Differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) 3The abbreviations used are: ES, embryonic stem; EB, embryoid body; VEGFR, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor; FGFR, fibroblast growth factor receptor; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; SH2, Src homology 2; HNF, hepatocyte nuclear factor; RT, reverse transcription. cells to embryoid bodies (EBs) has been a useful tool in understanding early events during development due to the experimental complications of in vivo studies whenever a gene exerts multiple effects. Studies on in vitro differentiation of ES cells have corroborated the existence of mesendoderm (3Tada S. Era T. Furusawa C. Sakurai H. Nishikawa S. Kinoshita M. Nakao K. Chiba T. Development (Camb.). 2005; 132: 4363-4374Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Another example of the usefulness of the in vitro EB system relates to studies of endothelial and hematopoietic ontogenesis. Differentiation of these lineages is initiated in specific structures composed of mesodermal cells (called blood islands) present in the yolk sac endoderm (6Palis J. McGrath K.E. Kingsley P.D. Blood. 1995; 86: 156-163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Blood islands consist of primitive hematopoietic blood cells surrounded by a layer of endothelial cells and support primitive hematopoiesis between embryonic days 7 and 14.5. Endothelial cells in the yolk sac form the primitive vascular plexus in a process named vasculogenesis, and subsequently a more mature vascular system evolves by angiogenesis. The presence of several factors universal for both endothelial and blood cells, such as VEGFR-2, Tal-1, and CD34 (7Shalaby F. Rossant J. Yamaguchi T.P. Gertsenstein M. Wu X.F. Breitman M.L.

Kennedy M. Kazarov A. Papadimitriou J.C. Keller G. Development (Camb.). 1998; 125: 725-732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite numerous investigations, the mechanisms responsible for differentiation of endothelial and blood cells are still not completely understood. In addition to studies on differentiation of mesodermal lineages, EBs have been employed for studies of endodermal and ectodermal differentiation (10Soria B. Skoudy A. Martin F.

The other SHB domains bind to different cytosolic proteins and thus transduce signals downstream of the receptors. SHB is implicated in many cellular processes such as differentiation of endothelial cells (22Lu L. Holmqvist K. Cross M. Welsh M. Cell Growth & Differ. 2002; 13: 141-148PubMed Google Scholar) and T cell signaling after CD3 stimulation (21Lindholm C.K. Gylfe E. Zhang W. Samelson L.E. Welsh M. J. Biol.

Moreover, SHB is involved in apoptotic signaling in fibroblasts, islets of Langerhans, and endothelial cells (23Welsh M. Christmansson L. Karlsson T. Sandler S. Welsh N. Mol.

EBs expressing the R522K SHB mutant displayed a lower mRNA content of several liver and pancreatic markers (26Kriz V. Anneren C. Lai C. Karlsson J. Mares J. Welsh M. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 286: 40-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In addition, SHB was found to be essential for EB blood vessel formation (27Rolny C. Lu L. Agren N. Nilsson I. Roe C. Webb G.C. Welsh M. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 308: 381-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), as EBs expressing R522K SHB failed to form normal blood vessels. To address the role of the SHB adapter protein in development, we have established knock-out ES cell lines deficient for one or both SHB alleles. These ES cell lines were differentiated in vitro and aimed at understanding the impact of SHB on hemangiogenesis. The data suggest an important involvement of SHB in the development of mesoderm. Gene Targeting—The murine embryonic stem cell line GSI-1 derived from 129SvJ mice was inactivated at both (SHB-/-) or one (SHB+/-) of the SHB alleles. These were inactivated in two subsequent steps. The first targeting vector contained three loxP sites. The first and the second loxP sites flanked the neomycin resistance gene, and the second and third loxP sites bordered the first exon (Fig. 1A). One of the clones in which homologous recombination had not occurred was used as an SHB+/+ control. The clone in which homologous recombination had taken place and all three loxP sites were present (loxPSHB) was treated with Cre recombinase by in vitro transfection. One of the clones, which had lost both the neomycin resistance gene and the first SHB exon, was used as a maternal clone for the second transfection. The second targeting vector contained an insertion of the neomycin gene into the first exon without loxP sites (Fig. 1A). Two sister clones to SHB-/-, in which homologous recombination had not occurred were used as SHB+/-. Clones were screened by PCR with one primer outside the sequence of the construct (supplemental Fig. 1). ES Cell Culture—ES cells were cultured in the presence of murine embryonic fibroblasts in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/glutamax (Invitrogen), penicillin/streptomycin, 15% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 1× nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen), sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen), monothioglycerol (Sigma), and recombinant leukemia inhibitory factor (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) as described previously (26Kriz V. Anneren C. Lai C. Karlsson J. Mares J. Welsh M. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 286: 40-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2. For ES cell differentiation, fibroblasts and leukemia inhibitory factor were omitted. ES cells were trypsinized (5 min at 37 °C) and aggregated by the hanging drop technique (1200 cells/20 μl of medium for 2 days (28Wobus A.M. Kaomei G. Shan J. Wellner M.C. Rohwedel J. Ji G.

These were grown in suspension for one more day and then plated on adherent tissue culture dishes. EBs were harvested 4, 6, 8, 12, and 21 days after the initiation of differentiation. Alternatively, EBs (after formation by the hanging drop technique for 2 days followed by 2 days of suspension culture) were grown as attachment cultures in glass chambers for an additional 7 days (yielding a total differentiation time of 11 days) and then stained for CD31 or CD41 to identify vascular structures or CD41-positive cells. Real-time Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated using the RNAeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Gene expression was quantified by real-time RT-PCR using a one-step reaction using the SYBR® Green RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). PCR conditions were 50 °C for 20 min and 95 °C for 15 min followed by 45 cycles at 94 °C for 15 s and annealing for 25 s at the various temperatures indicated followed by extension at 72 °C for 15 s. Alternatively, gene expression was quantified by a two-step reaction. M-MuLV reverse transcriptase (Finnzymes, Helsinki, Finland) was used to convert 1 μg of total RNA into cDNA. For PCR reactions, the SYBR® Green Taq Ready Mix™ (Sigma) was used. PCR conditions were initial denaturation (94 °C for 30 s) followed by 45 cycles at 94 °C for 10 s, and annealing for 25 s at the various temperatures indicated followed by extension at 72 °C for 15 s. Primer sequences are shown in supplemental Table 1. The PCR reactions were run on a Light Cycler instrument (Roche Diagnostics). Transcription levels were normalized against β-actin. Immunohistochemical Staining of EBs with CD31—Blood vessels were stained according to a protocol described previously (29Magnusson P. Rolny C. Jakobsson L. Wikner C. Wu Y. Hicklin D.J. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1513-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, EBs grown on glass chambers were washed with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) and fixed with 200 mm Tris, pH 6.6, 150 mm NaCl, 37 mm ZnCl2, 23 mm zinc-acetate, 3.2 mm calcium-acetate, and 0.2% Triton X-100 (4 °C overnight). On the next day, EBs were washed with TBS and treated with 3% H2O2 in methanol to block endogenous peroxidases. EBs were washed with TBS, and unspecific interactions were blocked in 0.1 m Tris-HCl/0.15 m NaCl/blocking buffer. The tissue was incubated with primary antibody, rat anti-mouse CD31 (BD Biosciences) at 1/1000, washed with TBS-Tween, and incubated with biotinylated secondary antibody (1/1000), goat anti-rat (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA), and again washed with TBS-Tween. EBs were incubated with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), washed with TBS-Tween and H2O, and the chromogen substance was added (AEC substrate kit, rat; Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA). Alternatively, EBs were stained for CD41 (BD Biosciences), except that immunofluorescence (Alexa goat anti-rat 568; Molecular Probes) was adopted to visualize CD41-positive cells. In Vitro Hematopoietic Differentiation—ES cells were differentiated according to a published procedure (30Carlsson L. Wandzioch E. Pinto do O.P. Kolterud A. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 365: 202-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) using components from Stem Cell Technologies, Inc. (Vancouver, Canada). The procedure is depicted in supplemental Fig. 2. Two days prior to differentiation, ES cells were trypsinized and cultured in IMDM ES medium (Iscove's modified Eagle's medium with l-glutamine/HEPES (Invitrogen)), penicillin/streptomycin, 15% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 1× nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen), sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen), monothioglycerol (Sigma), and recombinant leukemia inhibitory factor (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA). After 2 days in IMDM ES medium, the ES cells had reached 25-50% confluence and were then trypsinized and washed twice with IMDM 5% fetal calf serum. ES cells were then transferred to Petri dishes at a density of 1500 cells/ml in IMDM differentiation medium (Iscove's modified Eagle's medium/l-glutamine/HEPES (Invitrogen)), penicillin/streptomycin, 15% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), monothioglycerol (Sigma), ascorbic acid (Sigma), monothioglycerol (Sigma), l-glutamine (Sigma), and protein-free hybridoma medium (Invitrogen) to form EBs. These were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 7 days. Next, the media containing EBs were collected in Falcon tubes and the EBs allowed to sediment. Supernatants were removed, and EBs were trypsinized (3 min at 37 °C), after which the trypsin was inactivated by serum and EBs dispersed several times by an 18-gauge needle and 2-3 times through a 23-gauge needle. ES cells were counted and mixed by vortexing with methylcellulose medium (MethoCult®, StemCell Technologies Inc., Vancouver, Canada) and plated with a syringe at a concentration of 104 cells/ml. The MethoCult® M3434 medium contains Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium with methylcellulose for solid support, fetal bovine serum, bovine serum albumin, recombinant human insulin, human transferrin, 2-mercaptoethanol, l-glutamine, recombinant mouse stem cell factor, recombinant mouse interleukin-3, recombinant mouse interleukin-6, and recombinant human erythropoietin to support hematopoietic colony growth. Cell colonies were scored after an additional 7-10 days of culture, thus giving a total differentiation time of 14-17 days. Statistical Analysis—For real-time RT-PCR, β-actin-normalized cycle threshold values (as calculated by the Roche LightCycler version 3.5 software) were compared using a paired Student's t test based on absolute or relative differences. All real-time RT-PCR results are shown using logarithmic scales due to the exponential nature of the assay. In all other cases, a two-tailed Student's t test was performed using PractiStat software. Targeted Inactivation of the SHB Gene—To analyze the function of SHB, we performed targeted inactivation of ES cells using the loxP-SHB construct (Fig. 1A). The first transfection produced only one clone of 408 in which homologous recombination had occurred with all three loxP sites present. Homologous recombination occurred in another 9 clones, but in these, only the two loxP sites bordering the neomycin gene were present and were thus useless for deletion of the first exon. The second transfection generated only one clone of 480 containing the correct insertion of the neomycin gene, i.e. in the second allele of the first exon. Another two clones contained insertion in the first allele, whereas the second allele was untouched. For SHB+/- cells, two sister clones with random insertion of the targeting construct were chosen. The mutations resulted in loss of SHB protein expression (Fig. 1C). Expression of Mesodermal Markers in SHB-/- EBs—Previous studies have suggested an involvement of SHB in vascular formation (27Rolny C. Lu L. Agren N. Nilsson I. Roe C. Webb G.C. Welsh M. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 308: 381-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We have presently analyzed the expression of two markers for early mesoderm at appropriate stages of spontaneous EB differentiation. The markers studied were Brachyury and Mix1. Brachyury and Mix1 are expressed in mesoderm, mesendoderm, and to a lesser extent in endoderm (31Yasunaga M. Tada S. Torikai-Nishikawa S. Nakano Y. Okada M. Jakt L.M. Nishikawa S. Chiba T. Era T. Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 1542-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Brachyury gene expression was rapidly down-regulated in the control EBs, whereas the SHB-/- clone exhibited a significant delay in this response (Fig. 2). A similar pattern of delayed down-regulation of Mix1 gene expression was observed in the SHB-deficient clone, although the effect failed to reach statistical significance. The expression of later mesodermal markers relatively specific for the hematopoietic, vascular, and cardiac lineages was also studied. These were the hematopoietic markers Tal1 (32Kallianpur A.R. Jordan J.E. Brandt S.J. Blood. 1994; 83: 1200-1208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), CD41 (33Ferkowicz M.J. Starr M. Xie X. Li W. Johnson S.A. Shelley W.C. Morrison P.R. Yoder M.C.

Nature. 1995; 376: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (3358) Google Scholar, 38Shalaby F. Ho J. Stanford W.L. Fischer K.D. Schuh A.C. Schwartz L. Bernstein A. Rossant J. Cell. 1997; 89: 981-990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar), and the cardiac marker cardiac-actin (39Schuldiner M. Yanuka O. Itskovitz-Eldor J. Melton D.A. Benvenisty N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11307-11312Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). In the control EBs, all of these, except CD31, showed increased expression with time, which in the cases of Tal1, CD41, and cardiac-actin, peaked on day 8 (Fig. 2). The SHB-/- clone showed reduced expression of most of these markers on day 6 or 8 of differentiation. On day 12 of differentiation, expression of Tal1 and CD41 peaked in the SHB-/- clone and was higher than that of the control (Fig. 2). When comparing the SHB+/- clone with the control and the SHB-/- clones on day 12 of differentiation, it was observed that the loss of one SHB allele resulted in a response that was very similar to that of the complete SHB knock-out (Fig. 3). Particularly was expression of VEGFR-2, which has been shown to be essential for hematopoietic and vascular development (7Shalaby F. Rossant J. Yamaguchi T.P. Gertsenstein M. Wu X.F. Breitman M.L. Schuh A.C. Nature. 1995; 376: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (3358) Google Scholar), reduced in both the homozygous and heterozygous SHB knock-out ES cells (Fig. 3) at this time point. In addition, FGFR-1 expression was determined. SHB interacts with FGFR-1, which is a receptor that also plays a role for vascular and hematopoietic development (40Magnusson P.U. Ronca R. Dell'Era P. Carlstedt P. Jakobsson L. Partanen J. Dimberg A. Claesson-Welsh L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 944-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The expression of FGFR-1 was down-regulated at day 12 in the SHB-/- clone (Fig. 3). The combined data suggest decreased differentiation to mesodermal lineages in SHB-/- EBs as a consequence of delayed down-regulation of markers associated with early mesodermal development.FIGURE 3Expression of hematopoietic and vascular markers in SHB-deficient EBs after 12 days of spontaneous differentiation. Graphs show the relative abundance of mRNA for each clone. Relative abundance of mRNA was calculated by formula: 100 × 2-CT SHB+/+/2-CT SHB+/-, or 100 × 2-CT SHB+/+/2-CT SHB-/-.

C, CD41 (means ± S.E.; n = 6; * indicates p < 0.05). D, Tal-1 (means ± S.E.; n = 6-8).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) CD41 Protein Expression in SHB-/- EBs—The marker CD41 is commonly expressed in cells destined to undergo hematopoiesis (33Ferkowicz M.J. Starr M. Xie X. Li W. Johnson S.A. Shelley W.C. Morrison P.R. Yoder M.C. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 4393-4403Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), and despite the delayed up-regulation of expression, it showed an increased RNA content after 12 days of differentiation in the SHB-/- clone in comparison to the SHB+/+ clone (Fig. 3). To corroborate this finding, the expression of the CD41 protein was studied also on the protein level by immunofluorescence microscopy of EBs differentiated for 11 (4 + 7) days. CD41-positive cells derived from the SHB-/- and SHB+/- clones were stained more intensely than those derived from the SHB+/+ clone (Fig. 4). This indeed supports the view that CD41 mRNA is increased on day 12 in differentiating SHB-/- EBs and that this also results in increased protein expression. Impaired Blood Vessel Formation in SHB-/- EBs after VEGF Stimulation—EBs differentiating in glass chambers constitute an excellent model for the study of vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. During vasculogenesis, attached EBs form a primitive vascular plexus. Primary vessels promote the formation of a mature blood vessel network with capillaries in a subsequent process called angiogenesis. Treatment of EBs with VEGF-A increases the migration of endothelial cells from the EB core into the marginal zone around the EB where the blood vessels form a peripheral vascular plexus (29Magnusson P. Rolny C. Jakobsson L. Wikner C. Wu Y. Hicklin D.J. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1513-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5B). Our current intention was to study the potential of SHB-/- ES cells to form blood vessels, because SHB previously has been shown to influence EB blood vessel formation. SHB-/- or SHB+/- EBs did not exhibit any significant morphological changes in their vasculatures compared with those of the SHB+/+ EBs when cultured under basal conditions (Fig. 5A). These EBs formed a vasculature that was primarily concentrated to the central core of the EB with sparse vascular structures extending toward the periphery. However, after culture in the presence of VEGF, the SHB-/- and SHB+/- EBs showed less developed peripheral plexa than the SHB+/+ EBs with fewer capillary structures (Fig. 5B). Similar results were obtained with the other SHB+/- clone (data not shown). This finding is in the line with the previous study suggesting a role of SHB in regulating the development of vasculature in differentiating EBs (27Rolny C. Lu L. Agren N. Nilsson I. Roe C. Webb G.C. Welsh M. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 308: 381-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). SHB-/- ES Cells Are Defective in Colony Formation Assay—Our RT-PCR data for the hematopoietic precursor markers CD41 and Tal-1 suggest a delayed up-regulation of gene expression but also an increased potential of SHB-/- ES cells to differentiate into blood cells as their expression was elevated on day 12 of differentiation. To test whether SHB is important for in vitro erythropoiesis, EBs from the SHB-/-, SHB+/-, and SHB+/+ clones were analyzed for their capacity to form definitive blood cell colonies. Cell colonies were scored after days 7-11 of differentiation in methylcellulose preceded by a 7-day EB differentiation period allowing a total of 14-17 days of differentiation. SHB-/- EBs generated fewer blood cell colonies than wild-type EBs. In three of four experiments, the SHB+/- EBs also formed fewer blood cell colonies than the SHB+/+ clone (Fig. 6). This suggests that the main effect of SHB knock-out is delayed expression and decreased differentiation to the hematopoietic lineage. In the present study, we have investigated the potential of SHB-/- ES cells to differentiate in vitro. ES cells commonly differentiate in vitro in three-dimensional structures known as EBs, which similar to the embryo, contain cells from all three embryonal layers, i.e. ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm, but lack the complexity typical for the normal development of the organism. Murine ES cells can complement but not replace developmental studies on murine embryos. Inactivation of the first exon in the SHB gene causes loss of SHB protein expression. The homologous recombination was not very efficient in the SHB locus. The low yield in obtaining a SHB-/- clone after the second transfection could be due to the possibility that one allele is more permissive to the genetic replacement than the other one. Another explanation is that total SHB deficiency can cause less cell proliferation, and thus some SHB-/- clones will not expand sufficiently to be identified. There is a close relationship between endoderm and mesoderm during development. Both of these germ layers originate in the primitive streak in a tissue referred to as mesendoderm (1Kimelman D. Griffin K.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 350-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Also later during development, mesoderm and endoderm demonstrate interactions necessary for organ differentiation (4Hallonet M. Kaestner K.H. Martin-Parras L. Sasaki H. Betz U.A. Ang S.L. Dev. Biol. 2002; 243: 20-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 41Kumar M. Jordan N. Melton D. Grapin-Botton A. Dev. Biol. 2003; 259: 109-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Recently, the existence of mesendoderm was described also in vitro (3Tada S. Era T. Furusawa C. Sakurai H. Nishikawa S. Kinoshita M. Nakao K. Chiba T. Development (Camb.). 2005; 132: 4363-4374Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Our combined data support the role of SHB in mesodermal differentiation. Down-regulation of the early mesodermal marker Brachyury was paralleled by a delayed increase in the expression of several later mesodermal markers, such as VEGFR-2, Tal1, CD41, and cardiac-actin. Furthermore, expression of CD45, which is a hematopoietic marker expressed subsequently to CD41, was not increased in the SHB knock-out cells. The markers represent three different mesodermal lineages, and thus the data would suggest a generalized defect in mesodermal differentiation beyond early Brachyury expression. Expression of VEGFR-2 was significantly decreased in both SHB+/- and SHB-/- EBs. VEGFR-2 is known as a factor involved in hematopoiesis and vasculogenesis in vivo and in vitro (29Magnusson P. Rolny C. Jakobsson L. Wikner C. Wu Y. Hicklin D.J. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1513-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 38Shalaby F. Ho J. Stanford W.L. Fischer K.D. Schuh A.C. Schwartz L. Bernstein A. Rossant J. Cell. 1997; 89: 981-990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar, 42Kabrun N. Buhring H.J. Choi K. Ullrich A. Risau W. Keller G. Development (Camb.). 1997; 124: 2039-2048Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When examining the SHB+/- and SHB-/- EBs for their ability to form blood vessels, it was noted that both clones were able to form blood vessels under basal conditions. These results are in contradiction with our previous study using the SH2 domain inactive mutant of SHB, R522K-SHB (27Rolny C. Lu L. Agren N. Nilsson I. Roe C. Webb G.C. Welsh M. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 308: 381-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). R522K-SHB ES cells failed to form blood vessels regardless of what growth factor was added. The more prominent phenotype of the R522K-SHB ES cells may have several explanations. First, R522-SHB competes not only with the SHB protein but also with other members of this protein family, such as SHD, SHE, SHF, and SHG. Second, in the SHB-/- cells, these other members may compensate for certain SHB functions. Third, R522K-SHB may interfere with another pathway in which the wild-type SHB protein is not involved. Both SHB+/- and SHB-/- EBs form less developed vascular plexa after VEGF stimulation. SHB is involved in the differentiation of endothelial Immortomouse brain endothelial cells (22Lu L. Holmqvist K. Cross M. Welsh M. Cell Growth & Differ. 2002; 13: 141-148PubMed Google Scholar) and in VEGF-induced migration of porcine aortic endothelial cells by binding to phosphorylated tyrosine 1175 (1173 in mouse) in the VEGFR-2 (19Holmqvist K. Cross M.J. Rolny C. Hagerkvist R. Rahimi N. Matsumoto T. Claesson-Welsh L. Welsh M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22267-22275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The data thus suggest impaired signaling downstream of VEGFR-2 in SHB-deficient cells during blood vessel formation. CD41 is known as a marker for hematopoietic progenitors (34Mitjavila-Garcia M.T. Cailleret M. Godin I. Nogueira M.M. Cohen-Solal K. Schiavon V. Lecluse Y. Le Pesteur F. Lagrue A.H. Vainchenker W. Development (Camb.). 2002; 129: 2003-2013Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Emambokus N.R. Frampton J. Immunity. 2003; 19: 33-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The present finding that SHB-deficient EBs showed a delayed increase in expression that nevertheless reached higher levels of expression compared with control at day 12 could suggest an enhanced potential to differentiate to blood cells. This notion was not confirmed when performing a colony formation assay. Thus, the dominating feature is the delayed increase in CD41 expression that prevents further differentiation. Increased CD41 expression without concomitant differentiation has previously been observed and was explained by the observed existence of two populations of CD41-positive cells, i.e. CD41+“bright” and CD41+“dim” (44Otani T. Inoue T. Tsuji-Takayama K. Ijiri Y. Nakamura S. Motoda R. Orita K. Exp. Hematol. 2005; 33: 632-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Thus, CD41+ dim cells were shown to have the capacity to differentiate into hematopoietic progenitors contrary to CD41+ bright cells, which showed a low capacity to differentiate. It is possible that the CD41-positive cells in the SHB-/- EBs resemble primarily the CD41+ bright population of cells that fails to produce significant amounts of hematopoietic progenitors. Interestingly, the erythrocyte marker β-globin major, was decreased in R522K-SHB EBs. 4V. Kriz, N. Ågren, C. K. Lindholm, S. Lenell, J. Saldeen, J. Mares, and M. Welsh, unpublished data. FGF-2 promotes the formation of slender blood vessels extending from the center to periphery in cultured EBs (29Magnusson P. Rolny C. Jakobsson L. Wikner C. Wu Y. Hicklin D.J. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1513-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, FGFR-1 knock-out EBs also produce vascular structures (40Magnusson P.U. Ronca R. Dell'Era P. Carlstedt P. Jakobsson L. Partanen J. Dimberg A. Claesson-Welsh L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 944-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We have not observed any morphological changes in SHB-/- EBs after the addition of FGF-2 (data not shown). The fact that both FGF-2 addition and FGFR-1 knock-out increase vessel formation in EBs could explain the lack of effect of SHB-/- in this context, especially because SHB may mediate certain aspects of FGFR-1 signaling (20Cross M.J. Lu L. Magnusson P. Nyqvist D. Holmqvist K. Welsh M. Claesson-Welsh L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2881-2893Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the present data suggest that the SHB adapter protein is important for the formation of vascular structures and hematopoietic differentiation. This regulatory function operates at a stage later than initial mesodermal specification. Modulating SHB activity could serve a role in altering the developmental potential of differentiating ES cells.
