https://openalex.org/W2036921369,A submicroscopic deletion containing SOX2 was identified at the 3q breakpoint in a child with t(3;11)(q26.3;p11.2) associated with bilateral anophthalmia. Subsequent SOX2 mutation analysis identified de novo truncating mutations of SOX2 in 4 of 35 (11%) individuals with anophthalmia. Both eyes were affected in all cases with an identified mutation.
https://openalex.org/W2167851191,"Remodeling of the cytoskeleton is central to the modulation of cell shape and migration. Filamin A, encoded by the gene FLNA, is a widely expressed protein that regulates re-organization of the actin cytoskeleton by interacting with integrins, transmembrane receptor complexes and second messengers. We identified localized mutations in FLNA that conserve the reading frame and lead to a broad range of congenital malformations, affecting craniofacial structures, skeleton, brain, viscera and urogenital tract, in four X-linked human disorders: otopalatodigital syndrome types 1 (OPD1; OMIM 311300) and 2 (OPD2; OMIM 304120), frontometaphyseal dysplasia (FMD; OMIM 305620) and Melnick-Needles syndrome (MNS; OMIM 309350). Several mutations are recurrent, and all are clustered into four regions of the gene: the actin-binding domain and rod domain repeats 3, 10 and 14/15. Our findings contrast with previous observations that loss of function of FLNA is embryonic lethal in males but manifests in females as a localized neuronal migration disorder, called periventricular nodular heterotopia (PVNH; refs. 3-6). The patterns of mutation, X-chromosome inactivation and phenotypic manifestations in the newly described mutations indicate that they have gain-of-function effects, implicating filamin A in signaling pathways that mediate organogenesis in multiple systems during embryonic development."
https://openalex.org/W2108665729,"The orphan nuclear constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) is proposed to play a central role in the response to xenochemical stress. Identification of CAR target genes in humans has been limited by the lack of a selective CAR agonist. We report the identification of 6-(4-chlorophenyl)imidazo[2,1-b][1,3]thiazole-5-carbaldehyde O-(3,4-dichlorobenzyl)oxime (CITCO) as a novel human CAR agonist with the following characteristics: (a) potent activity in an in vitro fluorescence-based CAR activation assay; (b) selectivity for CAR over other nuclear receptors, including the xenobiotic pregnane X receptor (PXR); (c) the ability to induce human CAR nuclear translocation; and (d) the ability to induce the prototypical CAR target gene CYP2B6 in primary human hepatocytes. Using primary cultures of human hepatocytes, the effects of CITCO on gene expression were compared with those of the PXR ligand rifampicin. The relative expression of a number of genes encoding proteins involved in various aspects of steroid and xenobiotic metabolism was analyzed. Notably, CAR and PXR activators differentially regulated the expression of several genes, demonstrating that these two nuclear receptors subserve overlapping but distinct biological functions in human hepatocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2087627409,"Although mutation is commonly thought of as a random process, evolutionary studies show that different types of nucleotide substitution occur with widely varying rates that presumably reflect biases intrinsic to mutation and repair mechanisms. A strand asymmetry, the occurrence of particular substitution types at higher rates than their complementary types, that is associated with DNA replication has been found in bacteria and mitochondria. A strand asymmetry that is associated with transcription and attributable to higher rates of cytosine deamination on the coding strand has been observed in enterobacteria. Here, we describe a qualitatively different transcription-associated strand asymmetry in mammals, which may be a byproduct of transcription-coupled repair in germline cells. This mutational asymmetry has acted over long periods of time to produce a compositional asymmetry, an excess of G+T over A+C on the coding strand, in most genes. The mutational and compositional asymmetries can be used to detect the orientations and approximate extents of transcribed regions."

https://openalex.org/W2120162345,"A major source of free radical production in the brain derives from copper. To prevent metal-mediated oxidative stress, cells have evolved complex metal transport systems. The Alzheimer's disease amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a major regulator of neuronal copper homeostasis. APP knockout mice have elevated copper levels in the cerebral cortex, whereas APP-overexpressing transgenic mice have reduced brain copper levels. Importantly, copper binding to APP can greatly reduce amyloid औ production <i>in vitro</i>. To understand this interaction at the molecular level we solved the structure of the APP copper binding domain (CuBD) and found that it contains a novel copper binding site that favors Cu(I) coordination. The surface location of this site, structural homology of CuBD to copper chaperones, and the role of APP in neuronal copper homeostasis are consistent with the CuBD acting as a neuronal metallotransporter."
https://openalex.org/W2064750103,"Fish is a scaffolding protein and Src substrate. It contains an amino-terminal Phox homology (PX) domain and five Src homology 3 (SH3) domains, as well as multiple motifs for binding both SH2 and SH3 domain-containing proteins. We have determined that the PX domain of Fish binds 3-phosphorylated phosphatidylinositols (including phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate). Consistent with this, a fusion protein of green fluorescent protein and the Fish PX domain localized to punctate structures similar to endosomes in normal fibroblasts. However, the full-length Fish protein was largely cytoplasmic, suggesting that its PX domain may not be able to make intermolecular interactions in unstimulated cells. In Src-transformed cells, we observed a dramatic re-localization of some Fish molecules to actin-rich structures called podosomes; the PX domain was both necessary and sufficient to effect this translocation. We used a phage display screen with the fifth SH3 domain of Fish and isolated ADAM19 as a binding partner. Subsequent analyses in mammalian cells demonstrated that Fish interacts with several members of the ADAMs family, including ADAMs 12, 15, and 19. In Src-transformed cells, ADAM12 co-localized with Fish in podosomes. Because members of the ADAMs family have been implicated in growth factor processing, as well as cell adhesion and motility, Fish could be acting as an adaptor molecule that allows Src to impinge on these processes.

Abram C.L. Gibson T. Courtneidge S.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4346-4357Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). It has a PX1domain at its amino terminus and five SH3 domains, as well as multiple polyproline-rich motifs that could mediate association with SH3 domains, several possible phosphorylation sites for both serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases, and potentially four alternatively spliced forms. The presence of these domains and motifs in Fish suggests that it might act as a scaffold or docking molecule for both proteins and lipids.PX domains are independently folding modules of ∼120 amino acids, with an overall hydrophobic character but few totally conserved amino acids. They are frequently found in combination with protein interaction domains such as SH3 domains and exist in a diverse array of proteins with wide ranging functions (2Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2353-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). For example, the p40phox and p47phox subunits of the NADPH oxidase system of phagocytes contain PX domains. The enzymes CISK (cytokine-independent survivalkinase) and phospholipase D have PX domains, as do several proteins that function in vesicular sorting (for example the sorting nexins), and proteins involved in cytoskeletal organization (including the yeast bud emergence proteins). The binding capabilities of several PX domains have been reported recently. All PX domains tested bind to phosphorylated phosphatidylinositol lipids. The most common binding partner is PtdIns3P, but some PX domains will bind PtdIns(3,4)P2 and other substituted phosphatidylinositol molecules (3Sato T.K. Overduin M. Emr S.D. Science. 2001; 294: 1881-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). When PX domains were first identified, it was also noted that many of them contained a PXXP motif, suggesting that they might be able to bind SH3 domains (2Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2353-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Indeed, structural analysis of the PX domain of p47phox by NMR showed that its PXXP motif is on the surface of the domain and is able to bind to the second SH3 domain of p47phox (4Hiroaki H. Ago T. Ito T. Sumimoto H. Kohda D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 526-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). These data suggested that SH3 binding might impact the ability of a PX domain simultaneously to bind PtdIns3P. In the related protein p40phox, which also has a PXXP motif in its PX domain, lipid and SH3 binding to the PX domain appears to be neither cooperative nor antagonistic (5Bravo J. Karathanassis D. Pacold C.M. Pacold M.E. Ellson C.D. Anderson K.E. Butler P.J. Lavenir I. Perisic O. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L. Williams R.L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). However, it remains possible that in other proteins, lipid and SH3 domain binding might influence each other. The PX domain of Fish has both a PXXP motif and the conserved residues required for phospholipid binding.We recently reported that Fish is a Src substrate both in vitro and in vivo in Src-transformed cells (1Lock P. Abram C.L. Gibson T. Courtneidge S.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4346-4357Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Fish is also tyrosine-phosphorylated in a Src-dependent manner in normal cells treated with concentrations of cytochalasin D that result in rearrangement of the cortical actin cytoskeleton. Furthermore, tyrosine phosphorylation of Fish, albeit with slow kinetics, was detected in Rat1 cells in response to treatment with growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor, lysophosphatidic acid, and bradykinin that are known to promote changes in the actin cytoskeleton (1Lock P. Abram C.L. Gibson T. Courtneidge S.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4346-4357Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). These data suggest that Fish may impact, or be impacted by, cytoskeletal regulation.The cytoskeleton in Src-transformed cells is grossly abnormal. Very few actin filaments are detected. Instead, much of the F-actin has a ring-like appearance in the cortex of the cells and is found in structures that have been called podosomes (6David-Pfeuty T. Singer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 6687-6691Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 7Tarone G. Cirillo D. Giancotti F.G. Comoglio P.M. Marchisio P.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1985; 159: 141-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Each podosome is a fine, cylindrical, actin-rich structure on the ventral surface of the cell. In Src-transformed fibroblasts, these podosomes cluster to form rings or semi-circles that are called rosettes. Although it was thought that these structures might simply represent remnants of focal adhesions, more recent research has suggested that podosomes are involved in driving locomotion and invasion of Src-transformed cells (8Chen W.T. J. Exp. Zool. 1989; 251: 167-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Podosomes contain a number of cytoskeleton-associated proteins, including N-WASP, cortactin, paxillin, and p190RhoGAP(9Mizutani K. Miki H. He H. Maruta H. Takenawa T. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 669-674PubMed Google Scholar, 10Bowden E.T. Barth M. Thomas D. Glazer R.I. Mueller S.C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4440-4449Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 11Nakahara H. Mueller S.C. Nomizu M. Yamada Y. Yeh Y. Chen W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Src-transformed cells are not the only cells that contain podosomes; they have also been reported in invasive human breast cancer and melanoma cells (10Bowden E.T. Barth M. Thomas D. Glazer R.I. Mueller S.C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4440-4449Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 12Monsky W.L. Lin C.Y. Aoyama A. Kelly T. Akiyama S.K. Mueller S.C. Chen W.T. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5702-5710PubMed Google Scholar), raising the possibility that these structures might also be involved in metastatic properties of human tumor cells. Osteoclasts and macrophages also contain structures called podosomes (13Teti A. Marchisio P.C. Zallone A.Z. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: C1-C7Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this case, one large actin ring is formed, from which protrusions emerge that are involved in bone remodeling. It is not yet clear whether the podosomes of osteoclasts and of transformed cells contain the same components.The metzincin family of metalloproteases contains not just the matrix metalloproteases (some of which co-localize with podosomes) but also ADAMs family proteases (14Seals D.F. Courtneidge S.A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 7-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar, 15Primakoff P. Myles D.G. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 83-87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 16Black R.A. White J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 654-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 17Schlondorff J. Blobel C.P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3603-3617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to a metalloprotease domain, ADAMs proteins have disintegrin, cysteine-rich, and EGF-like domains that are involved in cell adhesion, a membrane spanning sequence, and a cytoplasmic tail. In many members of the ADAMs family, this cytoplasmic tail contains multiple PXXP motifs that can mediate the interaction with SH3 domain-containing proteins. Members of the ADAMs family function as sheddases (by cleaving active growth factors and cytokines from their inactive precursors), as well as mediating cell and matrix interactions.To isolate proteins that bound to the SH3 domains of Fish, we chose to use a phage display screen. Phage display has been used extensively for the generation of monoclonal antibodies and for screening peptide libraries. Recent advances in technology have allowed larger insert sequences to be expressed on the phage surface, thus facilitating the rapid screening of cDNA libraries against target proteins or peptides (18Zozulya S. Lioubin M. Hill R.J. Abram C. Gishizky M.L. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1193-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 19Crameri R. Suter M. Gene. 1993; 137: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 20Crameri R. Jaussi R. Menz G. Blaser K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Phage display does have limitations, such as issues with the production of the target protein in bacterial cells. However, one advantage over other methods is that once reagents are generated, the process is very rapid, with screening taking just a few days. Furthermore, although the two-hybrid system often results in the detection of large numbers of low affinity interactors, phage display screening allows the identification of only the highest affinity interacting molecules.To determine the role of Fish in signaling pathways downstream of Src, we have begun to look for binding partners of Fish. Given Fish's array of lipid and protein binding domains, we used both lipid binding assays and phage display screens in our analyses. Here we describe the identification of molecules that interact with the PX domain and the fifth SH3 domain of Fish.DISCUSSIONWe have demonstrated that the PX domain of Fish binds predominantly to PtdIns3P and also to PtdIns(3,4)P2, on filters spotted with the lipids. Many PX domains appear to bind PtdIns3P (3Sato T.K. Overduin M. Emr S.D. Science. 2001; 294: 1881-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 30Yu J.W. Lemmon M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44179-44184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 31Ellson C.D. Andrews S. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1099-1105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but binding to PtdIns(3,4)P2 is more unusual. Only the PX domain of p47phox, which is most closely related to the Fish PX domain, has also been shown to bind PtdIns(3,4)P2 (23Kanai F. Liu H. Field S.J. Akbary H. Matsuo T. Brown G.E. Cantley L.C. Yaffe M.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Although the filter binding assays of the type we used here may not reveal the full specificity or complexity of binding of a given PX domain, the data we have obtained are consistent with our subcellular localization analyses. For example, the isolated PX domain of Fish, when expressed as a GFP fusion protein, was distributed in the cytoplasm in a punctate fashion (that may reflect an endosomal localization) in normal fibroblasts. In contrast to the isolated PX domain, the full-length Fish protein did not show a punctate staining pattern. Rather, it appeared to be more diffusely cytoplasmic. These data suggest that, in the context of the full-length protein, the PX domain of Fish might not be able to make intermolecular contacts. A similar situation has been observed with the related protein, p47phox. In unstimulated neutrophils, p47phox is cytoplasmic, and its PX domain makes an intramolecular contact with its second SH3 domain. Stimulation of the neutrophil results in p47phox adopting an open conformation and associating with membranes containing PtdIns(3,4)P2 (4Hiroaki H. Ago T. Ito T. Sumimoto H. Kohda D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 526-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 32Ago T. Nunoi H. Ito T. Sumimoto H. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5057-5068Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). A similar mechanism may exist for Fish. Indeed, we have preliminary evidence that the PX domain of Fish makes contact with the third SH3 domain and that this intramolecular interaction is released by Src phosphorylation. 2D. Salinsky, C. L. Abram, and S. A. Courtneidge, unpublished observations. We observed a striking re-distribution of Fish in Src-transformed cells, with much of the protein found co-localized with actin in structures called podosomes. The PX domain of Fish was both necessary and sufficient to localize to podosomes. Interestingly, in the same cell type, a GFP-FYVE domain fusion protein was localized to the endosomal compartment via interaction with PtdIns3P. These data suggest that, in these Src-transformed cells, the Fish PX domain binds lipids other than PtdIns3P and that this may account for the Fish localization observed. The most likely candidate lipid is PtdIns(3,4)P2, which was able to bind to the PX domain in vitro and which can be produced from phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate by the action of a 5-phosphatase (34Erneux C. Govaerts C. Communi D. Pesesse X. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), or by the action of PtdIns3P 4-kinases on PtdIns3P (35Banfic H. Tang X. Batty I.H. Downes C.P. Chen C. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it is also possible that the PX domain of Fish is targeted to podosomes via interaction with a protein. We are currently determining whether podosomes contain PtdIns(3,4)P2 and whether the PX domain must bind either lipid and/or protein to associate with podosomes.Podosomes are interesting structures, found normally in invasive cells such as osteoclasts and macrophages (13Teti A. Marchisio P.C. Zallone A.Z. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: C1-C7Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but also present in Src-transformed cells and invasive breast carcinoma and melanoma cell lines (6David-Pfeuty T. Singer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 6687-6691Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 7Tarone G. Cirillo D. Giancotti F.G. Comoglio P.M. Marchisio P.C. Exp.

They are actin-rich protrusions of ∼0.4 ॖm in diameter that extend from underneath the cell body into the extracellular matrix. Podosomes are very dynamic structures, with a half-life in the order of minutes compared with focal adhesions, which are stable for several hours (8Chen W.T. J. Exp. Zool. 1989; 251: 167-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Podosomes contain several actin-binding proteins (see the Introduction), many of which are also Src substrates. In addition, and of interest in regard to the ability of podosomes to degrade the extracellular matrix, the podosomes of Src-transformed cells also contain the matrix metalloprotease MT1-MMP (also known as MMP14), which processes the gelatinases MMP2 and MMP9 to their active forms (37Nakahara H. Howard L. Thompson E.W. Sato H. Seiki M. Yeh Y. Chen W.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7959-7964Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Other podosome-associated proteins include औ1 integrins (38Mueller S.C. Chen W.T. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 99: 213-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the tyrosine kinase Pyk2 (in osteoclasts) (39Pfaff M.

We now show that, in Src-transformed cells, podosomes contain both Fish and ADAM12.We have demonstrated that the fifth SH3 domain of the Src substrate, Fish, binds to the cytoplasmic tail of several ADAMs family metalloproteases, particularly ADAMs 12, 15, and 19. Members of the ADAMs family are characterized by the presence of protease and disintegrin domains in the extracellular region, in addition to a pro-domain, a cysteine-rich region, and an EGF-like domain, followed by a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic tail of variable length. ADAMs have functions in many different cell processes, including myoblast fusion, fertilization, cell fate determination, and growth factor and cytokine processing (14Seals D.F. Courtneidge S.A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 7-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar, 15Primakoff P. Myles D.G. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 83-87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 16Black R.A. White J.M. Curr. Opin.

On a biochemical level, the ADAMs have three distinctive properties. First, the disintegrin domain (probably in conjunction with the cysteine-rich and EGF-like domains) has the ability to associate with integrin receptors, particularly those containing औ1 subunits, and therefore can modulate cell/cell interactions (14Seals D.F. Courtneidge S.A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 7-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar, 42Evans J.P. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 628-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Second, many of the ADAMs are active proteases that act as sheddases, that is they act to release active growth factors and cytokines from cell surfaces. Third, many of the ADAMs have extended cytoplasmic tails that mediate interactions with several proteins, both with and without SH3 domains.In this study we identified ADAMs 12, 15, and 19, but not ADAM9, as binding partners for Fish. Each of these ADAMs contains multiple PXXP motifs in their cytoplasmic tails (14Seals D.F. Courtneidge S.A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 7-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar), and indeed, some binding partners for these ADAMs have already been reported. These include the association of the SH3 domain-containing proteins Grb2, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and Src with ADAM12 (43Kang Q. Cao Y. Zolkiewska A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24466-24472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 44Suzuki A. Kadota N. Hara T. Nakagami Y. Izumi T. Takenawa T. Sabe H. Endo T. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5842-5850Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and endophilin 1, Grb2, SH3PX1, and Src family kinases with ADAM15 (45Howard L. Nelson K.K. Maciewicz R.A. Blobel C.P. J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 4999-5007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domains of ADAMs 12, 15, and 19 contain polyproline-rich motifs that likely represent the binding site for the Fish SH3 domain. Whether the association of Fish with various ADAMs family members is regulated by Src or Fish acts as an adaptor to allow Src to regulate the ADAMs family remains to be determined.It has been suggested that the cytoplasmic tails of the ADAMs may connect intracellular signals to the extracellular activity of these proteins. For example, overexpression of the cytoplasmic tail of ADAM12 inhibits myoblast fusion (47Galliano M.F. Huet C. Frygelius J. Polgren A. Wewer U.M. Engvall E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13933-13939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and similar overexpression of the ADAM9 tail inhibits 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced heparin-binding EGF shedding (48Izumi Y. Hirata M. Hasuwa H. Iwamoto R. Umata T. Miyado K. Tamai Y. Kurisaki T. Sehara-Fujisawa A. Ohno S. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7260-7272Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Presumably this inhibition occurs because the isolated cytoplasmic tails sequester proteins that normally bind to the full-length protein and are required for ADAMs function. Our future analyses will therefore involve testing the effect of Fish binding on ADAMs function in both normal and Src-transformed cells. Fish was originally isolated in a screen to identify Src substrates (1Lock P. Abram C.L. Gibson T. Courtneidge S.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4346-4357Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). It has a PX1domain at its amino terminus and five SH3 domains, as well as multiple polyproline-rich motifs that could mediate association with SH3 domains, several possible phosphorylation sites for both serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases, and potentially four alternatively spliced forms. The presence of these domains and motifs in Fish suggests that it might act as a scaffold or docking molecule for both proteins and lipids. PX domains are independently folding modules of ∼120 amino acids, with an overall hydrophobic character but few totally conserved amino acids. They are frequently found in combination with protein interaction domains such as SH3 domains and exist in a diverse array of proteins with wide ranging functions (2Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2353-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). For example, the p40phox and p47phox subunits of the NADPH oxidase system of phagocytes contain PX domains. The enzymes CISK (cytokine-independent survivalkinase) and phospholipase D have PX domains, as do several proteins that function in vesicular sorting (for example the sorting nexins), and proteins involved in cytoskeletal organization (including the yeast bud emergence proteins). The binding capabilities of several PX domains have been reported recently. All PX domains tested bind to phosphorylated phosphatidylinositol lipids. The most common binding partner is PtdIns3P, but some PX domains will bind PtdIns(3,4)P2 and other substituted phosphatidylinositol molecules (3Sato T.K. Overduin M. Emr S.D. Science. 2001; 294: 1881-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). When PX domains were first identified, it was also noted that many of them contained a PXXP motif, suggesting that they might be able to bind SH3 domains (2Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2353-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Indeed, structural analysis of the PX domain of p47phox by NMR showed that its PXXP motif is on the surface of the domain and is able to bind to the second SH3 domain of p47phox (4Hiroaki H. Ago T. Ito T. Sumimoto H. Kohda D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 526-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). These data suggested that SH3 binding might impact the ability of a PX domain simultaneously to bind PtdIns3P. In the related protein p40phox, which also has a PXXP motif in its PX domain, lipid and SH3 binding to the PX domain appears to be neither cooperative nor antagonistic (5Bravo J. Karathanassis D. Pacold C.M. Pacold M.E. Ellson C.D. Anderson K.E. Butler P.J. Lavenir I. Perisic O. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L. Williams R.L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). However, it remains possible that in other proteins, lipid and SH3 domain binding might influence each other. The PX domain of Fish has both a PXXP motif and the conserved residues required for phospholipid binding. We recently reported that Fish is a Src substrate both in vitro and in vivo in Src-transformed cells (1Lock P. Abram C.L. Gibson T. Courtneidge S.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4346-4357Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Fish is also tyrosine-phosphorylated in a Src-dependent manner in normal cells treated with concentrations of cytochalasin D that result in rearrangement of the cortical actin cytoskeleton. Furthermore, tyrosine phosphorylation of Fish, albeit with slow kinetics, was detected in Rat1 cells in response to treatment with growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor, lysophosphatidic acid, and bradykinin that are known to promote changes in the actin cytoskeleton (1Lock P. Abram C.L. Gibson T. Courtneidge S.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4346-4357Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). These data suggest that Fish may impact, or be impacted by, cytoskeletal regulation. The cytoskeleton in Src-transformed cells is grossly abnormal. Very few actin filaments are detected. Instead, much of the F-actin has a ring-like appearance in the cortex of the cells and is found in structures that have been called podosomes (6David-Pfeuty T. Singer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 6687-6691Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 7Tarone G. Cirillo D. Giancotti F.G. Comoglio P.M. Marchisio P.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1985; 159: 141-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Each podosome is a fine, cylindrical, actin-rich structure on the ventral surface of the cell. In Src-transformed fibroblasts, these podosomes cluster to form rings or semi-circles that are called rosettes. Although it was thought that these structures might simply represent remnants of focal adhesions, more recent research has suggested that podosomes are involved in driving locomotion and invasion of Src-transformed cells (8Chen W.T. J. Exp. Zool. 1989; 251: 167-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Podosomes contain a number of cytoskeleton-associated proteins, including N-WASP, cortactin, paxillin, and p190RhoGAP(9Mizutani K. Miki H. He H. Maruta H. Takenawa T. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 669-674PubMed Google Scholar, 10Bowden E.T. Barth M. Thomas D. Glazer R.I. Mueller S.C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4440-4449Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 11Nakahara H. Mueller S.C. Nomizu M. Yamada Y. Yeh Y. Chen W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Src-transformed cells are not the only cells that contain podosomes; they have also been reported in invasive human breast cancer and melanoma cells (10Bowden E.T. Barth M. Thomas D. Glazer R.I. Mueller S.C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4440-4449Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 12Monsky W.L. Lin C.Y. Aoyama A. Kelly T. Akiyama S.K. Mueller S.C. Chen W.T. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5702-5710PubMed Google Scholar), raising the possibility that these structures might also be involved in metastatic properties of human tumor cells. Osteoclasts and macrophages also contain structures called podosomes (13Teti A. Mar"
https://openalex.org/W2025592015,"Dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1) is a bone- and teeth-specific protein initially identified from mineralized dentin. Here we report that DMP1 is primarily localized in the nuclear compartment of undifferentiated osteoblasts. In the nucleus, DMP1 acts as a transcriptional component for activation of osteoblast-specific genes like osteocalcin. During the early phase of osteoblast maturation, Ca2+ surges into the nucleus from the cytoplasm, triggering the phosphorylation of DMP1 by a nuclear isoform of casein kinase II. This phosphorylated DMP1 is then exported out into the extracellular matrix, where it regulates nucleation of hydroxyapatite. Thus, DMP1 is a unique molecule that initiates osteoblast differentiation by transcription in the nucleus and orchestrates mineralized matrix formation extracellularly, at later stages of osteoblast maturation. The data presented here represent a paradigm shift in the understanding of DMP1 function. This information is crucial in understanding normal bone formation, remodeling, fracture healing, and skeletal tissue repair.

Proliferation and differentiation of mesenchymal cells to osteoblastic lineage is regulated by an intrinsic genetically defined program, which is well-controlled by various transcription factors, cytokines, morphogens, and secreted growth factors. There are two known transcription factors, namely Cbfa1 and osterix, that regulate osteoblast differentiation and skeletal formation during embryonic development (1Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3630) Google Scholar). Cbfa1-deficient mice have an osteopenic skeleton (2Otto F. Thornell A.P. Crompton T. Denzel A. Gilmour K.C. Rosewell I.R. Stamp G.W. Beddington R.S. Mundlos S. Olsen B.R. Selby P.B. Owen M.J.

Starbuck M. Priemel M. Shen J. Pinero G. Geoffroy V. Amling M. Karsenty G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1025-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Recently osterix has been shown to act downstream of Cbfa1 and functions to regulate the differentiation of preosteoblasts into mature osteoblasts (4Nakashima K. Zhou X. Kunkel G. Zhang Z. Deng J.M. Behringer R.R. de Crombrugghe B. Cell. 2002; 108: 17-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2784) Google Scholar). Differentiated osteoblasts synthesize a number of calcium-binding proteins like bone sialoprotein, osteopontin, and osteocalcin and secrete a complex extracellular matrix that has the capacity to nucleate hydroxyapatite crystal formation when adequate amounts of calcium and phosphate are supplied (reviewed in Ref. 5Karsenty G. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 2731-2733Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Understanding the regulatory mechanisms that control differentiation of osteoblast phenotype during proliferation, maturation, and mineralization is necessary for understanding various skeletal disorders. MC3T3-E1 cells are a well-established preosteoblast cell line derived from mouse calvaria and maintain much of the tightly linked controls between proliferation and differentiation. These cells, when treated with औ-glycerophosphate and ascorbic acid, differentiate into mature osteoblast phenotype and produce a calcifiable matrix that recapitulates in vivo conditions. Mineralized nodule formation takes place at least 18–21 days after induction of mineralization. During the early stage (3–5 days) of induction the preosteoblastic cells undergo proliferation, and at later stage (8–12 days) the cells differentiate to mature osteoblast capable of synthesis and assembly of mineralized matrix with increased alkaline phosphatase activity and production of type I collagen. Dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1)1 is a non-collagenous extracellular matrix protein identified from mineralized matrix of dentin and bone. DMP1 is highly anionic and rich in aspartic acid, glutamic acid, and serine residues. 527 of these serines can be potentially phosphorylated by casein kinase II. Based on its high negative charge, it has been postulated to play an important role in mineralized tissue formation, more specifically, by initiation of nucleation and modulation of mineral phase morphology (6George A. Sabsay B. Simonian P.A.L. Veis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12624-12630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7George A. Gui J. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Veis A. J. Histochem.

Recent experiments demonstrated that overexpression of DMP1 in embryonic mesenchymal cells resulted in characteristic morphological changes accompanied by transcriptional up-regulation of OCN and AP. Blocking the translation of DMP1 by antisense expression inhibited the expression of OCN and AP genes. Furthermore, stable cell lines overexpressing antisense DMP1 failed to initiate mineralized nodule formation in cell culture systems (10Narayanan K. Srinivas R. Ramachandran A. Hao J. Quinn B. George A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4516-4521Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). These experiments laid the foundation for speculation of a dual functional role for DMP1 during osteoblast differentiation. In this report we demonstrate that DMP1 resides in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and extracellular matrix of osteoblasts depending on their differentiation state and exhibits pleiotropic effects. Combined with experimental evidence, we suggest a bifunctional role for DMP1 during osteoblast differentiation and maturation. The mouse pre-osteoblastic cells, MC3T3-E1, were cultured with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 107 heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Celgro). Transient transfections with reporter plasmids were performed with Superfect (Qiagen) as per the manufacturer's protocol. Reporter transfections were carried out in triplicates and repeated at least three times to obtain a mean value. All the transfections contained an internal control vector pRLSV40, which contains a Renilla luciferase gene driven by SV40 promoter. Promoter activity at the control point was taken as 1007 activity. 100 ॖg of recombinant DMP1 was adjusted to pH 9.5 with phosphate buffer (400 ॖl). 100 ॖl of FITC solution (0.1 mg/ml) was added and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. The reaction mixture was passed through a G-25 column to remove excessive FITC. Furthermore, the labeled protein was dialyzed against PBS buffer at 4 °C for 18 h. Bovine serum albumin was labeled in a similar manner and was used as a control. For the uptake studies labeled proteins were added exogenously to the cells at a concentration of 30 ॖg/ml. Polyclonal DMP1 antibody was affinity-purified as described earlier (11Srinivasan R. Chen B. Gorski J.P. George A. Connect. Tissue Res. 1999; 40: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) using rDMP1 coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose column. For immunostaining, cells grown on coverslips were fixed with paraformaldehyde. Fixed cells were incubated with DMP1 antibody in the presence of 57 BSA for 4 h. Upon washing with PBS containing 17 Triton X-100, the cells were incubated with appropriate secondary antibody (fluorescent labeled) for 2 h. The coverslips were then mounted and observed under laser confocal microscope (Zeiss, LSM 510). Monoclonal tubulin antibody was purchased from Sigma; nucleus staining dye, propidium iodide, and Hoechst dye were purchased from Molecular Probes. Immunoprecipitation was carried out as described earlier (12Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998: 421-470Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out with the following primers to mutate the respective potential NLS sites. The lowercase letters represent the modified bases. NLS1: 724 bp, 5′-TCAAGCaGGAcATCCTTCAGAAGGTCCgGGGTCTCT-3′, 760 bp; NLS2: 1294 bp, 5′-TCTCAGGACAGTAGCgGATCCAcAGAAGAGAGC-3′, 1327 bp; NLS3: 1384 bp, 5′-GCTGACAATgGGAcACTAATAGcTGATGCT-3′, 1414 bp. Anin vitro site-directed mutagenesis system (GeneEditor,Promega Inc.) was used to achieve mutations. Mutated sites were verified by sequencing. Double-stranded oligonucleotides synthesized for the NLS1 (724–760 bp), NLS2 (1294–1327 bp), NLS3 (1384–1414 bp), and NES (13–48 bp) were ligated to the carboxyl-terminal end of the GFP protein at SmaI site with ORF to GFP. pEGFP (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was used in this study. An osteocalcin promoter driving the luciferase gene was a gift from Dr. Gerard Karsenty at Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX. DMP1 sense and antisense plasmids were constructed as described earlier (10Narayanan K. Srinivas R. Ramachandran A. Hao J. Quinn B. George A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4516-4521Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). GST-importin constructs were obtained as a kind gift from Dr. Stephen Adams, Northwestern University, Chicago. Recombinant GST-importin α bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads was used in GST pull-down assays. 100 ॖg of the extracted protein was added to the column and washed with 0.1 m NaCl in PBS buffer. GST beads were boiled in SDS-sample buffer, and the bound proteins were detected by Western blotting using DMP1 antibody. Recombinant DMP1 wasin vitro phosphorylated by casein kinases I and II mixture as described by the manufacturer (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY). Phosphorylation was confirmed by monoclonal phosphoserine antibody. An CKII assay was carried out using the casein kinase II assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology). Briefly, 20 ng of recombinant DMP1 was incubated with the nuclear extracts of MC3T3-E1 cells in the presence and absence of CKII-specific peptide (RRRDDDSDDD) or CKII-specific inhibitor (5,6-dichloro-1-औ-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole, DRB). The reaction was allowed for 30 min at 30 °C. The proteins were resolved on a 107 SDS-PAGE and dried for autoradiography. The intensity of phosphorylation was measured using Kodak Digital Science software. In other cases, after phosphorylation the proteins were precipitated with 57 trichloroacetic acid followed by filter binding assay using PE81 filters. Mineralization was induced as described earlier (10Narayanan K. Srinivas R. Ramachandran A. Hao J. Quinn B. George A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4516-4521Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The microenvironment for maturation of osteoblasts and mineral nodule formation was created by treating the cells (80–907 confluent) with medium supplemented with 57 fetal bovine serum, 10 mm औ-glycerophosphate, and 100 ॖg/ml ascorbic acid. To mimic in vivo biomineralization microenvironment, the cells were treated with cyclopiazonic acid, at a concentration of 1 ॖm for 2 h and then imaged for DMP1 localization. Cells were seeded onto glass coverslips at least 24 h prior to use. Attached cells were washed four times with Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) without calcium chloride. The cells were then loaded with Fluo3 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, 10 ॖm final concentration) for 45 min in the dark. They were then washed four times with HBSS, mounted onto a slide with elevated edges allowing to be flushed by the buffer (HBSS containing 10 mm औ-glycerophosphate and 100 ॖg/ml ascorbic acid) every 3 min. Images were taken using a cooled CCD camera (CoolSnapFX, Roper Scientific) mounted on a Nikon microscope. Metamorph software (Universal Imaging, PA) was used to obtain and analyze data. The intensity of Fluo3 and TRITC-DMP1 were calculated with appropriate background subtraction. For monitoring both the DMP1 and Ca2+, the cells were fed with TRITC-DMP1 for 3 h before loading with Fluo3. Inhibition of phosphorylation was carried out by 75 ॖm DRB, whereas calcium was inhibited by 30 ॖm BAPTA. BAPTA or DRB were added to cells for 30 min prior to imaging by confocal microscopy. The Fluo3 intensity was used to monitor the modulation in calcium level. Based on immunohistochemical data from mature bone tissue we had expected to localize the protein in the mineralized matrix (7George A. Gui J. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Veis A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 42: 1527-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Contrary to expectations, immunostaining of MC3T3-E1 cells with an affinity-purified monospecific DMP1 antibody indicated DMP1 to be predominantly nuclear-localized. However, we also observed a small amount of fluorescence outside the nucleus (Fig.1a). In a second set of experiments, FITC-labeled recombinant DMP1, when added to the culture medium of MC3T3-E1 cells, migrated into the nucleus in a time-dependent manner. Labeled DMP1 was found evenly distributed in the cytoplasm within 10 min. After 15 min, DMP1 was found to be concentrated around the outer nuclear membrane, and optimum localization in the nucleus occurred within 30 min as demonstrated by confocal microscopy (Fig. 1B). Therefore, in proliferating preosteoblasts, DMP1 was predominantly nuclear. However, the mechanism by which DMP1 is taken up by osteoblasts is currently unknown. To address the role of DMP1 in the nucleus, we have previously shown that overexpression of DMP1 in MC3T3-E1 cells and C3H10T1/2 (embryonic mesenchymal) cells resulted in characteristic morphological changes accompanied by transcriptional up-regulation of osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase (10Narayanan K. Srinivas R. Ramachandran A. Hao J. Quinn B. George A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4516-4521Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). However, the antisense-mediated repression of DMP1 protein led to an inhibition of osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase expression level (Fig.2A). Based on this experimental evidence we investigated if DMP1 could be operating directly as a transcriptional regulator for matrix genes involved in mineralization. To this end, we specifically investigated the effect of DMP1 on OCN (osteocalcin) promoter activity. Results in Fig.2B demonstrate that there is no significant increase in OCN promoter activity with increasing concentration of DMP1 plasmid. This result is not surprising because it is well established that OCN expression increases severalfold when preosteoblasts undergo differentiation. Overexpression of DMP1 during osteoblast differentiation did not have any significant effect on OCN promoter activity (Fig. 2C), however, MC3T3 cells overexpressing antisense DMP1 failed to show an increase in OCN promoter activity during differentiation (Fig. 2C). These data clearly demonstrates that DMP1 in conjunction with other osteoblast-specific transcription factors regulate the expression of osteocalcin gene. We speculate that DMP1 in the nucleus of preosteoblasts may initiate osteoblastic differentiation. The regulated transport of proteins across the nuclear envelope has been recognized as a critical step in vast number of cellular processes (13Jans D.A. Hubner S. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 651-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 14Misteli T. Science. 2001; 291: 843-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). For large proteins such as DMP1 (66 kDa), import into the nucleus would likely require the presence of nuclear localization signals (NLS) and its associated transport machinery. Inspection of the primary sequence of DMP1 led to the identification of three potential NLS sequences: NLS1 residues 242–252 (amino acid sequence SSRKSFRRSRVS), NLS2 residues 432- 442 (amino acid sequence SQDSSRSKEES), and NLS3 residues 472–481 (amino acid sequence ADNRKLIVDA). Mutations were introduced into the NLS1, 2, and 3 sequences as described under “Materials and Methods” to identify the functional NLS domain. Mutations in NLS1 and NLS2 did not hinder the transport of DMP1 into the nucleus (Fig.3). However, mutations in NLS3 resulted in intense cytoplasmic accumulation of the labeled protein (Fig. 3). Results from this mutation study clearly indicate that the NLS3 domain is functional and is required for nuclear import of DMP1. To further characterize the transport pathway, we investigated the interaction of DMP1 with α-importin by GST-α-importin pull-down assay. Binding assays clearly demonstrated that mutations at the NLS3 (N3) site affected the interaction of DMP1 with α-importin. However, mutations on NLS2 (N2) and NLS1 (N1) did not have any effect on importin binding (see Fig. 8B, panel IV). Thus, these results indicate the specific interaction of NLS3 domain with α-importin leading to the import of DMP1 into the nucleus.Figure 8A, characterization of the NLS and NES sequences in DMP1. The oligonucleotides corresponding to the putative NLS and NES domains were cloned into the 5′-end of the GFP plasmid with an ORF. MC3T3-E1 cells were transiently transfected with the GFP hybrids, and localization was monitored using confocal microscopy. Note the localization of NLS-pEGFP hybrid in the nucleus and the localization of the NES-pEGFP hybrid at the periphery of the cellular membrane and in the extracellular matrix. Bars = 20 (NLS-pEGFP), 10 (pEGFP and NES-pEGFP), and 3 ॖm (NES-pEGFP, enlarged view). InB: panel I, Western blot analysis of DMP1 expressed in different cellular compartments of MC3T3-E1 cells probed with DMP1 antibody; panel II, DMP1 proteins from different compartments were immunoprecipitated using DMP1 antibody and probed for phosphorylation with a monoclonal phosphoserine antibody (note the absence of phosphorylated DMP1 in the nucleus); panel III, protein extracts from different cellular compartments of MC3T3-E1 cells were loaded onto GST-α importin column to identify its interaction with DMP1. The binding of DMP1 was revealed by cross-blotting the proteins that bound to the beads using DMP1 antibody. For panels I, II, and III: T, C,N, and E represent total, cytosol, nuclear, and extracellular proteins. Panel IV, recombinant proteins were loaded onto a GST-α-importin column, washed, and eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Eluted proteins were analyzed for the presence of DMP1 using DMP1 antibody. For panel IV: C = control, N1 = NLS1-mutated DMP1, N2 = NLS2-mutated DMP1, and N3 = NLS3-mutated DMP1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Immunohistochemical studies have demonstrated the presence of DMP1 in the mineralized extracellular matrix of bone and dentin. This suggests that DMP1 must migrate from the nucleus rather than be maintained in a nuclear pool. To examine the export mechanism, MC3T3-E1 cells were treated for 2 days (early maturation stage) with ascorbic acid and औ-glycerophosphate, an organic phosphate, to stimulate differentiation, because Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium does not have sufficient phosphate ion product to support normal mineral formation. Immunostaining of these mineralizing cultures with a DMP1 antibody demonstrated a striking relocation of DMP1: instead of being in the nucleus, DMP1 was now located in the cytoplasm and the plasma membrane (Fig.4a). These data corroborated well with published reports regarding the localization of DMP1 extracellularly, in the bone matrix. Also, in vivo DMP1 can be localized in the nucleus of preosteoblasts and in the mineralized matrix of a mature osteoblast (data not shown). One of the main events during osteoblast differentiation and maturation is the release of calcium from intracellular stores. We hypothesized that Ca2+ might serve as a signal for DMP1 export. Therefore, we investigated if the export of DMP1 from the nucleus during mineralized matrix formation might be in response to a stimulus from the calcium microenvironment. To directly analyze this question, we treated MC3T3-E1 cells with cyclopiazonic acid, a stimulant for the release of intracellular Ca2+ stores without altering the IP3 levels (15Demaurex N. Lew D.P. Krause K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2318-2324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Confocal imaging in the presence of cyclopiazonic acid (1 ॖm, “+”) showed that the release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum, in fact, triggered the export of DMP1 from the nucleus to the extracellular matrix (Fig. 4b). This result is in good agreement with the in vivo localization of DMP1 in the extracellular matrix of bone and dentin. To investigate the functional role of Ca2+ in the export process of DMP1, MC3T3-E1 cells in mineralizing cultures were loaded first with TRITC-labeled DMP1 followed by the fluorescent calcium-sensitive dye Fluo3. Exposing the cells to a simulated mineralization medium containing औ-glycerophosphate (the concentration of inorganic phosphate used promoted biomineralization and not ectopic mineral deposition) initiated osteoblast differentiation. Strikingly, this process evoked a biphasic Ca2+ response. Live cell microscopic analysis revealed an initial rapid release of calcium from intracellular stores followed by a massive influx of this pool of Ca2+ into the nucleus. However, after 3 h, the elevated nuclear calcium levels declined and returned to the basal level. Interestingly, this influx of calcium into the nucleus triggered the export of DMP1 from the nucleus to the extracellular matrix (Fig. 5). This translocation of Ca2+ into the nucleus, under mineralization conditions, is probably specific for cells involved in synthesizing a mineralized matrix, because control fibroblastic NIH3T3 cells failed to respond in a similar manner (Fig.6). During bone formation, extracellular phosphate levels are raised significantly and induce changes in gene expression (16Beck Jr., G.R. Zerler B. Moran E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8352-8357Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). We speculate that this elevated extracellular phosphate levels triggers the release of calcium from intracellular stores of osteoblasts resulting in the export of DMP1 from the nucleus of differentiating osteoblasts.Figure 6Mineralization condition effect on NIH3T3 cells. NIH3T3 cells were seeded onto the coverslips at least 18 h before use. Cells were washed with HBSS (calcium-free) and loaded with Fluo3 for 45 min. Cells were mounted onto a slide with elevated edges giving access for the buffer to flow through. Cells were replenished with buffer (HBSS containing औ-glycerophosphate and ascorbic acid) every 3 min. Cells were monitored at regular intervals of 10 min. Imaging was done using a CCD camera mounted on a Nikon microscope. Metamorph software was used to obtain and analyze the data.Bar = 30 ॖm. Three different time frames were shown (A, B, and C correspond to 0, 90, and 120 min, respectively).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) An important question is whether this Ca2+ influx into the nucleus plays a specific role in the export of DMP1 from the nucleus. Mineralization stimulus was found to evoke a steady increase in the nuclear calcium levels for over 90 min, after which it subsequently declined to the initial level. This influx and efflux of calcium from the nucleus coincided with the export of DMP1 from the nucleus. However, addition of BAPTA-AM, a well-known chelator for calcium, led to the accumulation of the TRITC-DMP1 in the nucleus. Furthermore, the influx of calcium observed under normal mineralizing conditions did not take place in the presence of BAPTA-AM (Fig. 7). These results suggest that, in differentiating osteoblasts, DMP1 export into the extracellular matrix is directly or indirectly related to the local release of Ca2+. To investigate the signal sequence responsible for controlling the export of DMP1 into the extracellular matrix in coordination with calcium release, the sequence of DMP1 was examined for a nuclear export signal (NES). Sequence analysis indicated the presence of a classic leucine-rich hydrophobic export signal present at the amino-terminal end (5–16 amino acids) of the polypeptide and is conserved in all species identified thus far. The functionality of both the NES and NLS domains in DMP1 was further confirmed by ligating the NES domain (LLTFLWGLSCAL) and the NLS3 sequence, individually to the carboxyl terminus of the GFP construct with an ORF. Transient transfections and confocal images demonstrated that NLS3-GFP hybrid protein accumulated in the nuclear compartment. On the other hand, the NES-GFP hybrid was found to accumulate at the cellular boundary and in the ECM (Fig.8A). These results confirmed that both NLS3 and NES peptide sequences are functional and are necessary for the rapid import and export of DMP1. DMP1 is a phosphoprotein with a high negative charge. Phosphate groups confer a very high capacity to DMP1 for binding calcium ions, which is important for its potential function in mineralization. If fully phosphorylated, DMP1 would bear a net charge of −175 per molecule of 473 residues. To examine whether DMP1 is differentially phosphorylated in vivo, we immunoprecipitated DMP1 from the nucleus, cytosol, and extracellular matrix of MC3T3-E1 cells and cross-blotted it with an anti-phosphoserine antibody. It was observed, that DMP1 from the cytosol and extracellular matrix were phosphorylated, however, the nuclear DMP1 was unphosphorylated (Fig. 8B, panel II). To investigate the role of phosphorylation in the nucleocytoplasmic transport of DMP1, we investigated the binding of DMP1 to importin, a soluble transport factor. GST pull-down assay performed using the GST·α-importin complex showed that the DMP1 from the nuclear compartment was able to bind to importin, while no detectable binding was observed for DMP1 isolated from the cytosol and extracellular compartments (Fig. 8B, panel III). Results from these two studies, namely phosphorylation and importin binding assay, indicate that, upon phosphorylation, DMP1 might undergo a conformational change enabling it to expose the NES domain leading to its export into the ECM. In a different approach, recombinant DMP1 wasin vitro phosphorylated by CKII enzyme and added exogenously to the cells. Confocal microscopy demonstrated that there was no uptake of phosphorylated DMP1 by MC3T3-E1 cells. On the contrary, unphosphorylated recombinant DMP1 localized in the nucleus within 15 min (Fig. 4c). Thus phosphorylation of DMP1 is necessary for nucleocytoplasmic transport. DMP1 has several consensus sites for phosphorylation by CKII. To identify the casein kinase responsible for in vivophosphorylation of DMP1, proteins were extracted from the nucleus and cytosol and analyzed for their phosphorylating activity in the presence of [α-32P]ATP as the phosphoryl donor. Initial results demonstrate that the kinase in the nuclear extract had a greater phosphorylating potential when compared with the components from the cytosol fraction (data not shown). The specificity of this phosphorylating activity was confirmed by DRB (5,6-dichloro-1-औ-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole, 75 ॖm), a well-characterized specific inhibitor for CKII and by competition with excess CKII-specific peptide. Interestingly, addition of exogenous calcium in the form of calcium chloride (1–5 mm) to the reaction mixture combined with the nuclear extracts increased the phosphorylating activity of CKII. Furthermore, this increase can be suppressed by the addition of BAPTA-AM (30 ॖm) (Fig.9A). Moreover, CKII activity during the mineralization process was shown to increase at least 2- to 3-fold within the 24 h after mineralization induction (Fig.9B). Tog"

In this study, recombinant extracellular domains of DDR1 and DDR2 were produced to explore DDR-collagen binding in detail. In solid phase assays, both DDRs bound collagen I with high affinity. DDR1 recognized collagen I only as a dimeric and not as a monomeric construct, indicating a requirement for receptor dimerization in the DDR1-collagen interaction. The DDRs contain a discoidin homology domain in their extracellular domains, and the isolated discoidin domain of DDR2 bound collagen I with high affinity. Furthermore, the discoidin domain of DDR2, but not of DDR1, was sufficient for transmembrane receptor signaling. To map the collagen binding site within the discoidin domain of DDR2, mutant constructs were created, in which potential surface-exposed loops in DDR2 were exchanged for the corresponding loops of functionally unrelated discoidin domains. Three spatially adjacent surface loops within the DDR2 discoidin domain were found to be critically involved in collagen binding of the isolated DDR2 extracellular domain.

An important class of signaling receptors are receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs),1 which play crucial roles in many fundamental cellular processes, including the cell cycle, differentiation, migration, and metabolism (1Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3557) Google Scholar). RTKs are not only regulators of normal cellular processes but are also critically involved in the development and progression of human cancers, making them important targets for cancer intervention strategies (2Shawver L.K. Slamon D. Ullrich A. Cancer Cell. 2002; 1: 117-123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Most RTKs are activated by soluble proteins present in the blood or other body fluids. The two closely related receptors of the discoidin domain receptor (DDR) RTK subfamily, DDR1 and DDR2, are unusual in that they are activated by an extracellular matrix protein, triple-helical collagen (3Vogel W. Gish G.D. Alves F. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 4Shrivastava A. Radziejewski C. Campbell E. Kovac L. McGlynn M. Ryan T.E.

This activation is independent of the major cellular collagen receptors, औ1 integrins, as shown for DDR1 (5Vogel W. Brakebusch C. Fassler R. Alves F. Ruggiero F. Pawson T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5779-5784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The two DDRs differ in their ligand specificities; whereas both are activated by fibrillar collagens (types I–III and V), only DDR1 can be activated by nonfibrillar collagens, such as type IV collagen. Another intriguing feature of DDRs is their unusually slow autophosphorylation upon stimulation by the ligand compared with typical RTKs (hours rather than seconds) (3Vogel W. Gish G.D. Alves F. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 4Shrivastava A. Radziejewski C. Campbell E. Kovac L. McGlynn M. Ryan T.E. Davis S.

Both DDRs are widely expressed in human and mouse tissues, with distinct distributions. DDR1 is mainly expressed in epithelial cells, whereas DDR2 is found in mesenchymal cells (6Alves F. Vogel W. Mossie K. Millauer B. Hofler H. Ullrich A. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 609-618PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological functions of the DDRs have only begun to emerge, but it is clear that both receptors are involved in cell interactions with the extracellular matrix and control adhesion and cell motility. DDR1 signaling is essential for cerebellar granule differentiation (7Bhatt R.S. Tomoda T. Fang Y. Hatten M.E.

Hofler H. Ullrich A. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 609-618PubMed Google Scholar). The elevated expression of DDRs in a number of fast growing invasive tumors suggests an important role of these matrix-activated RTKs in the proliferation and stromal invasion of tumors. DDR1 and DDR2 are composed of an N-terminal ∼150- amino acid discoidin homology (DS) domain (18Baumgartner S. Hofmann K. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Bucher P. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1626-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), followed by a sequence of ∼220 amino acids unique to DDRs, a transmembrane (TM) domain, a large cytosolic juxtamembrane domain, and a C-terminal catalytic tyrosine kinase domain. The DDR DS domains are homologous to Dictyostelium discoideum discoidin I and to functionally important DS domains of known structure in a number of secreted (e.g. blood coagulation factors V and VIII) (19Macedo-Ribeiro S.

Structure. 2003; 11: 99-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). No convincing data are available to define the location and nature of the collagen binding site(s) of DDRs. A recent study attempted to map DDR1 residues critical for collagen binding (22Curat C.A. Eck M. Dervillez X. Vogel W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45952-45958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), but the results are inconclusive, since only highly conserved core residues in the DS domain were targeted by mutagenesis. To gain insight into the molecular basis of DDR-collagen signaling, I have studied an array of recombinant DDR proteins, obtained by eukaryotic expression, in collagen binding and cell-based receptor activation assays. I demonstrate for the first time that the isolated extracellular domains (ECDs) of DDR1 and DDR2 bind directly to collagen with high affinity and that binding requires these domains to be dimerized. Using deletion mutants, I show that the DS domain of DDR2 fully contains the collagen binding site. Finally, homology scanning of the DDR2 DS domain identified three spatially adjacent loop regions as essential for collagen binding and receptor activation. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA), 293-EBNA cells (Invitrogen), and 293-T cells (ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 nutrient mixture (Invitrogen) containing 107 fetal bovine serum. BSA, κ-casein, collagen I (acid soluble from rat tail; C-7661), collagen IV (acid-soluble from human placenta; C-5533), and fibronectin (0.17 solution from human plasma) were obtained from Sigma. EHS mouse tumor laminin was purchased from BD Biosciences (Oxford, UK). Bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3) was from Pierce. Puromycin was obtained from Sigma, and zeocin was from Invitrogen. The antibodies (Abs) and their sources were as follows: anti-DDR1, rabbit anti-DDR1 Ig (sc-532 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); anti-DDR2, goat anti-DDR2 Ig (sc-7554 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology); mouse anti-Myc tag, clone 9E10 from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY); peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human Fc from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA); anti-phosphotyrosine, clone 4G10, from Upstate Biotechnology. Secondary Abs were as follows: sheep anti-mouse Ig-horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences); goat anti-rabbit Ig-horseradish peroxidase (Dako, Ely, UK); rabbit anti-goat IgG-horseradish peroxidase (Sigma). Restriction and modification enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Hitchin, UK) or Promega (Southampton, UK). All PCR amplification reactions were performed with Pfu DNA polymerase according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). All PCR-derived sequences in the final constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. cDNA encoding full-length DDR1b (TrkE) in pBluescript vector was received from Dr. Michele de Luca (Istituto Dermopatico Dell'Immacolata, Rome, Italy). cDNA encoding full-length DDR2 in pBluescript vector was received from Dr. Michel Faure (SUGEN Inc., San Francisco, CA) as pBS-Tyro10. For expression in eukaryotic cells, these cDNAs were cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA 3.1/Zeo (Invitrogen). His-tagged constructs were made by PCR amplification from cDNA clones using primers that introduced a novel EcoRI restriction site followed by a NheI restriction site on the 5′ end and a stop codon followed by aXhoI and a BamHI site on the 3′ end of the amplified cDNA fragment. The PCR products were cut withEcoRI and BamHI and subcloned into pSP72 vector (Promega). For episomal expression in eukaryotic cells, theNheI/XhoI fragment was cloned into a modified pCEP-Pu vector (23Kohfeldt E. Sasaki T. Gohring W. Timpl R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), which codes for a fusion protein containing at the N terminus the BM-40 signal sequence, a His6 tag, a Myc antigen, and an enterokinase cleavage site. In the DDR constructs, the enterokinase site is followed by the ECD fragments of DDR1, DDR2, or the various deletion constructs (Fig. 1A). For all DDR1 constructs, the first amino acid of the ECD fragments was Asp19, which is the first amino acid after the predicted signal peptide cleavage site. The C-terminal amino acid of the constructs was Thr416, which is the last residue before the predicted TM domain. Similarly, DDR2 constructs encompassed sequences between Lys22 and Thr398. Fc fusion proteins were constructed with the ECDs of DDR1, DDR2, and the various deletion constructs fused to the hinge, CH2, and CH3 domains of human IgG1 (24Fawcett J. Holness C.L. Needham L.A. Turley H. Gatter K.C. Mason D.Y. Simmons D.L. Nature. 1992; 360: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The cDNAs encompassed coding sequences for the natural signal sequence up to Thr416 (DDR1) or up to Thr398 (DDR2) (Fig.1A).

Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) from full-length cDNA clones. Two cDNA fragments (A and B) were amplified using specific primers such that the 3′ end of fragment A was complementary to the 5′ end of fragment B. Fragment A encompassed sequences 5′ of the deletion, including a natural unique restriction site, and fragment B encompassed sequences 3′ of the deletion, including another unique restriction site. The overlap was designed to result in the joining of the desired amino acid sequences, as detailed in Fig. 1B. Both fragments were purified by gel electrophoresis and fused via their overlapping sequences by a secondary PCR reaction. The amplified fused product was restriction digested and subcloned into vectors encoding the full-length DDRs after the corresponding wild-type fragment was removed. For expression in eukaryotic cells, deletion constructs encoding the TM receptors with intact cytoplasmic domains were cloned into pcDNA 3.1/Zeo, as above. DDR2 loop chimera cDNAs were constructed by overlap extension PCR, amplifying two cDNA fragments, A and B, in which the 3′ end of fragment A was complementary to the 5′ end of fragment B. For all fragments A the 5′ primer was 5′-CGGAATTCACAGAGAATGCTCTGCACCCGTT, which introduced a novel EcoRI restriction site 5′ relative to the start codon; for all fragments B, the 3′ primer was 5′-TGGTATTGACACTTGATGGCACTGG, which primes just 3′ of a uniqueAatII restriction site. The overlap was designed to result in the desired loop exchange. Table Idepicts the 3′ primers for fragments A and the 5′ primers for fragments B.

Resistant cells were allowed to grow to confluence and used for the collection of serum-free conditioned medium. Serum-free medium was collected from T150 tissue culture flasks after incubation for 2 days at 37 °C and again after another 2–3 days of culture at 37 °C. The harvested media (typically 0.5–1 liter) were pooled and cleared of detached cells by centrifugation, followed by filtration through a 5-ॖm pore filter. For the purification of His-tagged proteins, sodium phosphate buffer (500 mm, pH 7.4) was added to a final concentration of 50 mm. TALON metal affinity beads (Clontech), equilibrated in 50 mmsodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl (binding buffer), were added to the medium. After incubation for 16 h at 4 °C on a magnetic stirrer, the beads were washed with binding buffer and transferred to a disposable column. After extensive washing, the His-tagged proteins were eluted with 150 mm imidazole, 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. For the purification of Fc-tagged proteins, sodium phosphate buffer (500 mm, pH 7.0) was added to the clarified media to a final concentration of 20 mm. Protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated in PBS, were added and incubated for 16 h as above. The beads were washed with PBS and transferred to a disposable column. The Fc-tagged proteins were eluted with 100 mm citrate, pH 3.0, and immediately neutralized with 1m Tris, pH 9.0. All recombinant proteins were concentrated by ultrafiltration and dialyzed against PBS. Electrophoresis demonstrated a purity of >957. The yields were in the range of 3–7 mg/liter of conditioned medium. Collagen or other ligand proteins were diluted in PBS and coated in 50-ॖl aliquots onto 96-well microtiter plates (Maxisorp, Nalge NUNC International, Rochester, NY), overnight at room temperature. To denature collagen, samples were heated to 50 °C for 30 min prior to coating the wells. Wells were then blocked with 150 ॖl of 1 mg/ml BSA in PBS plus 0.057 Tween 20 (PBS-T) (DDR2 binding assays) or 0.04 mg/ml κ-casein in PBS-T (DDR1 binding assays) for 1 h at room temperature. After one wash with incubation buffer (0.5 mg/ml BSA in PBS-T for DDR2 binding assays; identical to blocking buffer for DDR1 binding assays), 50-ॖl aliquots of the recombinant DDR proteins diluted in incubation buffer were added for 3 h at room temperature. Wells were washed six times with incubation buffer, and 50-ॖl aliquots of mouse anti-Myc monoclonal Ab (mAb) (1:500 dilution; for His-tagged proteins) or goat anti-human Fc Ab coupled to horseradish peroxidase (1:5000 dilution; for Fc-tagged proteins) were added for 1 h at room temperature. After six washes as above, 50-ॖl aliquots of sheep anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase Ab (1:1000 dilution) were added for 1 h at room temperature (His-tagged proteins only), followed by six washes as above. Bound DDR proteins were detected with 75 ॖl/well of 0.5 mg/mlo-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma) in 50 mm citrate-phosphate, pH 5.0, added for 3–5 min. The reaction was stopped with 50 ॖl/well of 3 mH2SO4. Plates were read in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader at a wavelength of 490 nm. All binding assays were carried out in duplicate and showed less than 157 difference on the same plate. The assays were highly reproducible with less than 157 variation between different experiments. 293 cells in 12-well tissue culture plates were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation with the relevant DDR expression vectors. 24 h later, the cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 16 h. Cells were then stimulated with either 10 ॖg/ml collagen or 1 mm sodium orthovanadate for 90 min at 37 °C. After washing with PBS, cells were lysed in 17 Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 ॖg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm NaF. The detergent-soluble fraction was recovered by centrifugation, and aliquots were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 7.57 polyacrylamide gels, followed by blotting onto nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were probed with mouse anti-phosphotyrosine mAbs, followed by sheep anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase. Detection was by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). To reprobe the blots, the membranes were stripped in 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 27 SDS, 100 mm औ-mercaptoethanol at 55 °C for 30 min and probed with rabbit anti-DDR1 or goat anti-DDR2 Abs followed by goat anti-rabbit Ig-horseradish peroxidase or rabbit anti-goat IgG-horseradish peroxidase, respectively. Gel filtration chromatography was carried out at 4 °C using an Amersham Biosciences ÄKTA system and a Superdex S200 HR10/30 column. All experiments were done using PBS at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Elution was monitored by UV absorbance at 280 nm. The S200 column was calibrated with the following molecular mass standards (Sigma): carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), bovine albumin (66 kDa), and alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa). Up to 150 ॖl of DDR samples (1–2 mg/ml) were injected per run. Cross-linking was performed for 1 h at room temperature with the homobifunctional reagent BS3. 4 ॖg of DDR proteins were incubated in PBS with different concentrations of BS3 in a final volume of 15 ॖl. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 5× SDS sample buffer containing 107 औ-mercaptoethanol, followed by heating to 100 °C for 5 min and analysis by SDS-PAGE on 77 polyacrylamide gels. Human DDR1 and DDR2 are classified as collagen receptors (3Vogel W. Gish G.D. Alves F. Pawson T. Mol.

I have developed a simple and robust enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-type assay to measure the binding of soluble DDR fragments to immobilized collagens. Recombinant proteins corresponding to the ECDs of the DDRs, N-terminally tagged with a His tag and a Myc epitope (his-DDR1 and his-DDR2; Fig. 1A) were produced in stably transfected human 293-EBNA cells and purified from serum-free medium. his-DDR2 exhibited dose-dependent, saturable binding to rat tail collagen I, whereas his-DDR1 did not display any binding above background levels (Fig.2A). his-DDR2 binding to collagen I was of high affinity, with half-maximal binding at ∼10–20 nm his-DDR2. Collagen binding by his-DDR2 was specific, since only little binding occurred to denatured collagen I (Fig.2B). Furthermore, the ligand specificity of his-DDR2 mirrored that of the full-length receptor, as determined indirectly by autophosphorylation (3Vogel W. Gish G.D. Alves F. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Thus, no binding was detectable to fibronectin, collagen IV or laminin (Fig. 2B). To create recombinant DDR proteins with a different tag, the C termini of the ECDs were fused to a human IgG1 Fc sequence, which mediates covalent dimerization via disulfide bridges (DDR1-Fc and DDR2-Fc; Fig.1A). This approach was only successful for DDR1. Upon transient transfection of 293-T cells, only DDR1-Fc and no DDR2-Fc was secreted by the cells (data not shown). DDR1-Fc was produced and purified from the serum-free medium of stably transfected cells. In contrast to his-DDR1, which did not bind to collagen I, DDR1-Fc showed dose-dependent, saturable binding to collagen I, similar to his-DDR2 (Fig. 2C). In contrast to his-DDR2, DDR1-Fc showed binding to collagen IV, consistent with previous observations that full-length DDR1 can be activated by collagen IV (3Vogel W. Gish G.D. Alves F. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 4Shrivastava A. Radziejewski C. Campbell E. Kovac L. McGlynn M. Ryan T.E. Davis S. Goldfarb M.P. Glass D.J. Lemke G. Yancopoulos G.D. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 25-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Collagen binding by DDR1-Fc was also specific for triple-helical collagen as the binding to denatured collagens I or IV was greatly reduced. No binding was detected to laminin or fibronectin (data not shown). The ECD of DDR1 bound to collagen only when fused to a dimerizing Fc tag, suggesting that receptor dimerization is required for ligand binding. Since his-DDR2, whose oligomerization state is not determined by the tag, avidly bound to collagen, I suspected that his-DDR2 might already exist as a (noncovalent) dimer, whereas his-DDR1 might lack features responsible for dimerization. Indeed, his-DDR1 and his-DDR2 eluted at different positions from a gel filtration column (12.4- and 10.8-ml elution volume, respectively) (Fig.3A), suggesting that his-DDR2 forms higher oligomers in solution than his-DDR1. A small shoulder in the elution profile of his-DDR2 coincided with the elution volume of his-DDR1. Because of the presumed nonglobular shape of DDR ECDs, the elution volumes cannot be used to determine molecular masses. The most likely explanation of the gel filtration data, however, is that his-DDR1 is a monomer, whereas his-DDR2 is a noncovalent dimer, with a small monomer fraction. To further examine the oligomeric states of his-DDR1 and his-DDR2 I used chemical cross-linking (Fig. 3B). Dimers of his-DDR2 were readily detected at higher concentrations of cross-linker, whereas only the monomeric form was present for his-DDR1 across the entire range of cross-linker concentrations. No oligomers higher than dimers were seen for his-DDR2. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the ECD of DDR2, but not of DDR1, exists as a noncovalent dimer in solution, and that DDR dimerization is required for collagen binding. The ECDs of the DDRs are composed of an N-terminal DS domain followed by a ∼220-amino acid region of no homology to other proteins (Fig. 1). To establish which domains within the ECDs of the DDRs are involved in the binding to collagen, a set of deletion constructs were made (Fig.4A). For all constructs, cDNAs coding for His-tagged proteins and Fc fusion proteins were created. Unfortunately, not all constructs were secreted by the cells following transfection with the respective expression vectors (Fig.4A). Only full-length DDR1 and ΔDS1 Fc fusion proteins, but not DS1–1 and DS1–2, were obtained, whereas all His-tagged DDR1 constructs were produced, albeit with poor yields for his-DS1–1 and his-DS1–2 (data not shown). Conversely, only DS2 Fc fusion protein and not full-length DDR2 (see above) or ΔDS2 were secreted. All His-tagged DDR2 proteins except ΔDS2 were produced. The contribution of the DS domain to collagen binding by DDR1 could not be studied, because no DDR1 deletion construct containing the DS domain could be obtained as a Fc fusion protein. To study the contribution of the DS domain to collagen binding by DDR2, DS2-Fc and his-DS2 were purified from the serum-free medium of stably transfected cells. DS2-Fc showed strong and saturable binding to collagen I with the same specificity as full-length his-DDR2 (Fig. 4B; compare with Fig. 2), demonstrating that the DS domain of DDR2 is sufficient for high affinity binding to collagen I. His-DS2, in contrast, showed only limited binding to collagen I (data not shown). When analyzed by chemical cross-linking, his-DS2 was found to be mainly monomeric (data not shown). These results are in accord with the binding and oligomerization data described above and further emphasize that DDRs have to be dimerized in order to bind collagen.

Janus kinase signal transducers and activators of transcription suppressors of cytokine signaling protein inhibitor of activated STAT interferon tumor necrosis factor interleukin extracellular signal-regulated kinase Crohn's disease epidermal growth factor Cytokines play an important role in activation, effector function, and homeostasis of the immune system. Dysregulation, imbalanced production, or aberrant expression of cytokines is believed to be involved in the immunopathogenesis of infectious, allergic, and autoimmune diseases. To transmit their messages, cytokines bind to specific cell surface receptors and activate cytoplasmic signal transduction pathways, often involving the Janus kinase (Jak)1/signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway (1Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1995; 277: 1630-1635Crossref Scopus (3401) Google Scholar, 2Leonard W.J. O'Shea J.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 293-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar). The Jak kinase family consists of non-receptor protein kinases that are constitutively associated with the cytoplasmic membrane-proximal regions of various receptors. Upon ligand binding, Jak kinases become catalytically activated by phosphorylation. STAT proteins are subsequently recruited via highly specific recognition of phosphotyrosine docking sites on the receptor complex by the STAT SH2 domains (3Quelle F.W. Shimoda K. Thierfelder W. Fisher C. Kim A. Ruben S.M. Cleveland J.L. Pierce J.H. Keegan A.D. Nelms K. Paul W.E. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3336-3343Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Upon tyrosine phosphorylation by Jaks, STAT proteins homo- or heterodimerize and translocate to the nucleus, where the interaction with specific DNA sequences triggers transcription of target genes (4Schindler C. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In healthy individuals, Jak/STAT activation is rapid, transient, and strictly regulated at multiple levels. Down-regulation of STAT activation involves inhibitors such as suppressorsof cytokine signaling (SOCS),protein inhibitor of activatedStat (PIAS), protein tyrosine phosphatases (5Starr R. Hilton D.J.

The importance of controlling STAT activation has been underscored by the findings that the constitutively activated form of STAT3 induces an uncontrolled cellular growthin vitro and functions as an oncogene in vivo(10Horvath C.M.

Crohn's disease and other human chronic inflammatory bowel diseases are characterized by disturbances in the immune homeostasis involving CD4+ T cells, regulatory T cells, and a number of cytokines and cytokine receptors (17Fiocchi C. Gastroenterology. 1998; 115: 182-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1870) Google Scholar). Experimental and clinical data point toward a dysregulation of the cytokine network with a dominance of T helper cell type 1 (Th1) cytokines (IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-12) and a deficiency in Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) (18Fuss I.J.

Because most of these cytokines/cytokine receptors transduce signals through the Jak/STAT signaling pathways, we hypothesized that disturbances in STAT signaling might be involved in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. Accordingly, the present study was undertaken to investigate STAT signaling in intestinal T cells from Crohn's patients and healthy volunteers. Antibodies against human SOCS3 (M20), STAT3 (C20), STAT6 (S20), and ERK-1/2 (K23) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies against human STAT5 phospho-tyrosine 694 and human STAT6 phospho-tyrosine 641 were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). The antibody against human STAT3 phospho-tyrosine 704 was purchased from Nanotools (Denzlingen, Germany). The antibody against human STAT4 phospho-tyrosine 693 was from Zymed Laboratories Inc. Antibodies against human STAT4 and human STAT5 were from BIOSOURCE. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies against mouse-IgG, rabbit-IgG, and goat-IgG were from DAKO (Glostrup, Denmark). RhIL-2 Proleukin was purchased from Chiron (Emeryville, CA). RhIL-4, rhIL-10, rhIL-12, and rhIFN-α were purchased from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ). Tyrphostin AG 1478 was from Alexis, Laufelfingen, Switzerland), and Jak3-Inhibitor I was purchased from Calbiochem. The intestinal CD4+T cells were obtained from colon mucosa biopsies from seven healthy volunteers (median age 38, range 20–50 years) and from seven patients (median age 40, range 22–50 years) with an established diagnosis of Crohn's disease. All patients had active disease treated with 5-ASA (2–4 g/day). Two patients received additional treatment with azathioprine (150–200 mg/day) and/or prednisone (5–20 mg/day). None of the patients received anti-TNF treatment. Intestinal T cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Sigma) supplemented with 107 pooled human serum (Blood Bank, State University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark), 2 mml-glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 ॖg/ml streptomycin (all from Sigma), and 103 units/ml rhIL-2 and 25 ng/ml rhIL-4. Neither antigen nor feeder cells were added to the intestinal T cells cultures, which consisted of more than 977 CD3+ and CD4+ T cells. Alloantigen-specific peripheral human CD4+ T cell lines were obtained from healthy donors as described previously (20Nielsen M. Odum N. Bendtzen K. Ryder L.P. Jakobsen K.B. Svejgaard A. Exp. Clin. Immunogenet. 1994; 11: 23-32PubMed Google Scholar). Peripheral T cell cultures were IL-2-dependent and grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 107 pooled human serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 ॖg/ml streptomycin and 100 units/ml rhIL-2. Cutaneous T cells from the affected skin of patients with atopic dermatitis and psoriasis were IL-2- and IL-4-dependent and grown under the same conditions described above for cultures of intestinal T cells. The cutaneous T cell lymphoma cell line was established from skin biopsies from a patient with mycosis fungoides (MF) as described (21Kaltoft K. Bisballe S. Dyrberg T. Boel E. Rasmussen P.B. Thestrup-Pedersen K. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1992; 28A: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In this study we used a long-term culture of an MF tumor cell line (MyLa 2000), which grows independently of cytokines. MyLa 2000 was cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 107 fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 2 mml-glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 ॖg/ml streptomycin. Prior to all experiments, both intestinal and peripheral T cells were washed twice and “rested” in the absence of exogenous cytokines by culturing the cells overnight (>10 h) in normal culture media depleted of cytokines. Subsequently, cells were stimulated with 500 units/ml rhIL-2 or 25 ng/ml rhIL-4 for 15 min at 37 °C. Longer IL-2-stimulations of 45 min or 90 min were also performed in peripheral T cells. Stimulations by 1–50 ng/ml rhIL-10 or rhIL-12 and stimulations by 104units/ml of rhIFN-α were carried out for 15 min at 37 °C. In all experiments, controls of cytokine-unstimulated cells were always run in parallel. After stimulation with or without cytokines, cells were lysed in ice-cold 17 Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer with the following protease/phosphatase inhibitors: 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (in Me2SO), 5 mm EDTA, 1 mmNa3VO4, 10 ॖg/ml aprotinin, 10 ॖl/ml indoleacetic acid, and 10 mm NaF. The cytoplasmic extracts were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Blots were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C, washed, and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The bands were detected using enhanced chemiluminiscence (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's manual. For repeated immunoblotting, membranes were stripped and reprobed using the procedure described above. MEDSTAT was used for statistical analyses. Data were analyzed using a two-tailed Fisher's exact test with assumption of no variance. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. First, we studied STAT activation in intestinal CD4+ T cells obtained from a patient with Crohn's disease (CD) and peripheral, allospecific CD4+ T cell lines from healthy donors. As expected, STAT proteins were not tyrosine phosphorylated in rested peripheral T cells from healthy donors (Fig.1, A and B,lanes 1), whereas cytokine stimulation induced profound tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3/STAT5 (IL-2), STAT6 (IL-4), or STAT3 (IL-10) (Fig. 1, A, lanes 2 and 3, andB, lane 3). Surprisingly, high levels of tyrosine phosphorylated STAT3 was observed in rested intestinal T cell lines obtained from CD patients (Fig. 1, A and B,lanes 4). The constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 was highly specific, because STAT1/5/6 were not constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated in intestinal T cells from Crohn's patients (Fig.1A, lane 4). Moreover, IL-2 and IL-4 did not trigger tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 and STAT6 in intestinal T cells from Crohn's patients (Fig. 1A, lanes 5and 6), whereas high concentrations of IL-10 induced an enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 (Fig. 1B,lane 6). Because Th1 cytokines are believed to play a crucial role in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (18Fuss I.J. Neurath M. Boirivant M. Klein J.S. de la Motte C. Strong S.A. Fiocchi C. Strober W. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1261-1270PubMed Google Scholar) and STAT4 is a key regulator of Th1 responses, we studied IL-12-induced STAT4 activation in CD patients and healthy individuals. As expected, in rested peripheral T cells from healthy donors, IL-12 induced a profound tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT4 (Fig. 2, lane 3), whereas STAT4 was not tyrosine phosphorylated in the absence of IL-12 (Fig. 2, lane 1). In contrast, STAT4 was constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated in rested intestinal T cells from CD patients (Fig. 2, lane 4), and the phosphorylation was further up-regulated following IL-12 stimulation (Fig. 2, lane 6). Next, we compared STAT signaling in intestinal T cells from the mucosa of healthy volunteers and Crohn's disease patients. As shown in Fig.3, STAT3 and STAT4 were constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated in rested T cells from five of seven different CD patients (Fig. 3, A and B, lanes 4and 7, and data not shown). In contrast, STAT3 and STAT4 were not constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated in rested intestinal T cells from any of seven healthy volunteers (Fig. 3, A andB, lanes 1, and C, p = 0.02). In T cells from healthy donors, IL-2 and IL-4 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 (Fig. 3A, lanes 2 and3), whereas high concentrations of IL-12 induced STAT4 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 3B, lane 3). In intestinal T cells from CD patients, the constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT4 was enhanced following stimulation with IL-4 (Fig. 3A, lanes 5 and 8) and IL-12 (Fig. 3B, lanes 6 and 9), respectively, whereas IL-2 had little effect on STAT3 phosphorylation and did not induce tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 (Fig.3A, lanes 6 and 9, and data not shown). Moreover, IL-4 did not induce tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT6 (data not shown), confirming the results shown previously in Fig.1A. The difference in STAT activation between Crohn's disease patients and healthy donors was observed throughout a 3-month period, indicating that the phenotype was stable over time and not caused by the culture conditions (data not shown). Although the intestinal tract is the primary target organ, Crohn's disease is often a systemic disease with extra intestinal manifestations such as arthritis, conjunctivitis, and erythema nodosum. Therefore, we examined whether an aberrant STAT activation was observed only in intestinal T cells or also in peripheral T cells. As shown Fig.4A, STAT3 was constitutively activated in peripheral T cells from all of the five patients tested. In contrast, we were unable to detect significant levels of tyrosine phosphorylated STAT3 in peripheral T cells from healthy controls (Fig.4B), indicating that an aberrant STAT activation was a systemic feature in Crohn's disease. In an attempt to address whether the constitutive STAT activation was caused by an autocrine production of cytokines, co-culture experiments were performed using a culture system where cells are separated by diffusible microporous membranes. Different combinations of T cells from Crohn's patients and healthy volunteers had no influence on the constitutive STAT3 activation, indicating that cytokines (and other soluble factors) might not be involved in the constitutive activation of STAT proteins (data not shown). Likewise, repeated washing and starvation for up to 72 h did not inhibit the constitutive activation of STAT3 (data not shown), indicating that exogenous factors are not involved in constitutive STAT activation. To address whether STAT3 and STAT4 were specifically activated in Crohn's disease or were a secondary event to chronic inflammation, we tested the activation of the STAT protein in T cells from the affected skin of patients with atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. As shown in Fig.5, STAT proteins were not constitutively activated in rested cutaneous T cells from patients with atopic dermatitis and psoriasis (Fig. 5, A, lane 4, andB, lane 1). However cytokine stimulation induced profound tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 (IL-2 and IL-4) in T cells from atopic dermatitis (Fig. 5A, lanes 5 and6). Likewise, in T cells from psoriasis, IL-2 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 (Fig. 5B, lane 2), and IFN-α induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1/3/4 (Fig. 5B, lane 4). Several tyrosine kinases and oncogenes have been implicated in the constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 in cancer cells (11Migone T.S. Lin J.X. Cereseto A. Mulloy J.C. O'Shea J.J. Franchini G. Leonard W.J. Science. 1995; 269: 79-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Because the Janus kinase 3 is involved in the constitutive activation of STAT3 in T cell lymphomas, we addressed whether Jak3 might also be involved in the constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 in T cells from CD patients. As shown in Fig.6, STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation is almost completely blocked by a selective inhibitor of Jak3 (Fig. 6,lane 3). In contrast, an inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor tyrosine kinase (which is involved in STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation in several cancer cells) did not affect the constitutive STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation in intestinal T cells from CD patients (Fig. 6, lane 4) even at concentrations that block epidermal growth factor-induced STAT3 activation in the IEC cell line (Ref. 22Zushi S. Shinomura Y. Kiyohara T. Miyazaki Y. Kondo S. Sugimachi M. Higashimoto Y. Kanayama S. Matsuzawa Y. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 78: 326-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, and data not shown). To address whether the constitutive STAT activation was caused by a deficient negative regulation by tyrosine phosphatases, we performed pulse-chase experiments comparing the kinetics of STAT3 dephosphorylation following treatment with the Jak3 inhibitor. The decrease in phosphotyrosine STAT3 followed the same kinetics in intestinal T cells from Crohn's patients and IL-2 treated intestinal T cells from healthy donors, indicating that the constitutive STAT activation was not caused by a deficiency in the expression or function of tyrosine phosphatases (data not shown). In keeping with these observations, Crohn's T cells did not have a deficient expression of tyrosine phosphatases such as Src homology domain 2 containing inositol 5-phosphatase 1 (SHIP1) (data not shown) Because STAT3 is a transcription factor regulating the expression of SOCS3 (9Brender C. Nielsen M. Kaltoft K. Mikkelsen G. Zhang Q. Wasik M. Billestrup N. Odum N. Blood. 2001; 97: 1056-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), we addressed whether SOCS3 was expressed in Crohn's disease. Indeed, SOCS3 was constitutively expressed in intestinal T cells from CD patients (Fig. 7,A and B) and in T cell lymphomas (MyLa 2000) with a constitutively activated STAT3 (Fig. 7A, right panel). Moreover, the constitutive expression of SOCS3 found in intestinal CD4+ T cells of CD patients was up-regulated by IL-2-stimulation for 45 min (Fig. 7B, right panel). In contrast, SOCS3 was not constitutively expressed in both rested intestinal T cells from healthy individuals (Fig.7B, left panel) and rested peripheral T cells from healthy blood donors (Fig. 7A, left panel). In rested T cells from healthy individuals, SOCS3 was expressed only upon IL-2-stimulation (Fig. 7, A andB, left panel), supporting the hypothesis that STAT3 might trigger a constitutive SOCS3 expression in intestinal T cells from CD patients. The present data provide the first evidence of a constitutive activation of STAT3 and STAT4 and expression of SOCS3 in T cells from colon mucosa of patients with Crohn's disease. Thus, a selective tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT4 was seen in intestinal T cells from CD patients. In contrast, STAT3 and STAT4 were not constitutively (but inducibly) tyrosine phosphorylated in intestinal T cells from healthy volunteers, suggesting that a constitutive activation of STAT3 and STAT4 might be a specific feature of intestinal T cells from Crohn's disease. In support of this hypothesis, Suzukiet al. have recently shown that STAT3 is tyrosine phosphorylated and SOCS3 expressed in a murine colitis model and in whole colon tissue extracts from ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease patients (23Suzuki A.

Med. 2001; 19: 471-481Crossref Scopus (424) Google Scholar). In accordance with the present study, Suzukiet al. also reported that STAT1, STAT5, and STAT6 were not constitutively activated in human whole colon tissue extracts, whereas the possible activation of STAT4 was not commented (23Suzuki A. Hanada T. Mitsuyama K. Yoshida T. Kamizono S. Hoshino T. Kubo M. Yamashita A. Okabe M. Takeda K. Akira S. Matsumoto S. Toyonaga A. Sata M. Yoshimura A. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 19: 471-481Crossref Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Using experimental animal models, it has been proposed that the STAT4 pathway plays a key a role in chronic intestinal inflammation (24Wirtz S. Finotto S. Kanzler S. Lohse A.W. Blessing M. Lehr H.A. Galle P.R. Neurath M.F. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1884-1888PubMed Google Scholar, 25Simpson S.J. Shah S. Comiskey M. de Jong Y.P. Wang B. Mizoguchi E. Bhan A.K. Terhorst C. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1225-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). This notion is supported by the present findings of an aberrant activation of STAT4. We also investigated whether the aberrant STAT activation was restricted to T cells from the gastrointestinal area. We found a clear constitutive STAT3-activation in peripheral mononuclear cells from patients with Crohn's disease compared with healthy controls, suggesting that disturbances in STAT-activation are a generalized feature of T cells from Crohn's disease patients. Studies are in progress to elucidate whether aberrant STAT activation can be utilized as an early diagnostic or prognostic marker. To our knowledge, the present study comprises the first example of a constitutive activation of STAT3 and STAT4 in non-transformed human T cells. Indeed, we looked for but were unable to find constitutive STAT activation in rested T cells from the affected skin of patients with atopic dermatitis, chronic eczema (data not shown), and psoriasis. The regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation is orchestrated by the coordinated action of phosphatase and protein-tyrosine kinases. Modulation of the function of either phosphatases or protein-tyrosine kinases results in imbalanced activity, leading to altered signal transduction and response. We did not observe any modification of the phosphatase activity in the intestinal T cells from Crohn's disease patients, indicating that the constitutive STAT activation is not caused by a deficiency in negative regulation by tyrosine phosphatases. As mentioned earlier, several human cancers, including T cell lymphomas, have a constitutive activation of STAT3 mediated by known and as yet unidentified tyrosine kinases and oncogenes. Our observation that a selective inhibitor of Jak3 almost completely blocked the constitutive STAT activation suggests that Jak3 is involved in the aberrant STAT activation in CD patients. Interestingly, the Jak3 inhibitor also blocks the constitutive activation of STAT3 in T cell lymphomas (14Nielsen M. Kaltoft K. Nordahl M. Ropke C. Geisler C. Mustelin T. Dobson P. Svejgaard A. Odum N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6764-6769Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Studies are in progress to identify whether Jak3 is mutated or associated with cytokine receptors, tyrosine kinases, and/or oncogenes known to activate STAT3 in tumor cells. It was a consistent finding that intestinal T cells from CD patients responded weakly to stimulation with exogenous cytokines such as IL-2 and IL-4. Recently, it has become clear that intracellular inhibitors such as SOCS and PIAS proteins negatively regulate cytokine signaling. STAT3 is a transcription factor regulating SOCS3 expression (9Brender C. Nielsen M. Kaltoft K. Mikkelsen G. Zhang Q. Wasik M. Billestrup N. Odum N. Blood. 2001; 97: 1056-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and SOCS3 was constitutively expressed in intestinal T cells from CD patients but not in T cells from healthy volunteers. It is therefore possible that the partial resistance to exogenous cytokines is caused by the constitutive expression of SOCS3 in intestinal T cells from CD patients. The constitutive expression of SOCS3 in cells that have a constitutive activation of STAT3 indicates that SOCS3 is not able to sufficiently block the tyrosine kinase responsible for tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3. One possible explanation might be that the expression level is not sufficient to block the kinase. Alternatively, mutations in the kinase, docking proteins/receptors, and/or SOCS3 could explain this apparent paradox. Because deficient expression of another inhibitor of STAT3, PIAS3, has also been linked to the constitutive expression of STAT3 in T lymphomas (26Zhang Q. Raghunath P.N. Liquan X. Majewski M. Carpentieri D.F. Odum N. Morris S. Skorski T. Wasik M.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 466-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), we also looked for but were unable to find a deficient expression of PIAS3 in CD patients (data not shown). Studies are in progress to address whether PIAS3 and/or SOCS3 are mutated in CD patients. In conclusion, we provide the first evidence of an aberrant activation of STAT3, STAT4, and SOCS3 in intestinal T cells from patients with Crohn's disease. These findings suggest a possible pathogenetic link between cancer and autoimmunity. Moreover, they open a new battlefield in the fight of chronic inflammatory bowel disease and possibly other autoimmune diseases."

MDC1 regulates ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM)-dependent phosphorylation events at the site of DNA damage. Importantly down-regulation of MDC1 abolishes the relocalization and hyperphosphorylation of BRCA1 following DNA damage, which coincides with defective G2/M checkpoint control in response to DNA damage.

Therefore, Kiaa0170 has been renamed as mediator of DNA damagecheckpoint protein 1 (MDC1) to better reflect its role in DNA damage checkpoint controls. 4S. J. Elledge and S. P. Jackson, personal communication. In this study, we further explored the role of MDC1 in ATM-dependent DNA damage response pathways. MDC1 cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. T. Nagase from Kazusa DNA Research Institute (Chiba, Japan). MDC1 siRNAs were synthesized by Xerogon Inc. (Huntsville, AL). The siRNA duplexes were 21 base pairs including a two-deoxynucleotide overhang. The coding strand of MDC1 siRNA1 was UCCAGUGAAUCCUUGAGGUdTdT, and the coding strand of MDC1 siRNA2 was ACAACAUGCAGAGAUUGAAdTdT. The coding strand of BRCA1 siRNA was GGAACCUGUCTCCACAAAGdTdT, and the control siRNA was UUCAAUAAAUUCUUGAGGUdTdT. MDC1 antibodies were raised against glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins containing N-terminal residues 1–150 or 151–484 of MDC1. Anti-phospho-H2AX (γH2AX) and anti-BRCA1 antibodies were generated as described previously (8Rappold I. Iwabuchi K. Date T. Chen J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Anti-p1524BRCA1 antibodies were kindly provided by Dr. KumKum Khanna. Anti-pS317Chk1 antibodies and anti-pATM/ATR were purchased from Cell Signaling. Anti-Chk1 mAb was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-phospho-histone 3 antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. All cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cell lysate preparation, immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, and immunostaining were performed as described before (8Rappold I. Iwabuchi K. Date T. Chen J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). siRNA transfection was performed as described previously (9Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8186) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown in six-well plate to 30% confluence and immediately before transfection washed with serum-free medium, and 800 μl of serum-free medium were added per well. For each well, 200 nm siRNA was mixed with 5 μl of Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) in 200 μl of serum-free medium. The mixtures were incubated for 20 min at room temperature and then added to cells. Serum was added 4 h later to a final concentration of 10%. 24 h after the initial transfection, a second transfection was performed in the same way as the previous one. 72 h after initial transfection, cells were treated and harvested as indicated. siRNA-transfected cells were γ irradiated (2 Gy) or left untreated. Cells were then stained with anti-phospho-H3 antibodies, and phospho-H3-positive cells were evaluated by counting or fluorescence-activated cell sorter. To test the role of MDC1 in ATM-dependent phosphorylation events, we used siRNA technology (9Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8186) Google Scholar) to down-regulate MDC1 (Fig. 1A) and monitored ATM-dependent phosphorylation events by immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 1B). An antibody raised against phosphoepitope substrates of ATM or ATR has been shown to specifically recognize ATM/ATR-dependent phosphorylation events (10DiTullio Jr., R.A. Mochan T.A. Venere M. Bartkova J. Sehested M. Bartek J. Halazonetis T.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 998-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, in cells transfected with control siRNA, ionizing radiation (IR)-induced nuclear foci were present in most irradiated cells, suggesting the accumulation of phosphorylated ATM substrates at the sites of DNA breaks. However, down-regulation of MDC1 abolished these IR-induced foci. These results suggest that MDC1 regulates ATM/ATR-dependent phosphorylation events upon DNA damage. Furthermore down-regulation of MDC1 resulted in increased sensitivity to IR and camptothecin (Fig. 1C), implying that MDC1 is required for cell survival following DNA double-stranded breaks. Together these data suggest that MDC1 is involved in ATM-dependent DNA damage response pathways. In agreement with the role of MDC1 in ATM/ATR-dependent pathways, down-regulation of MDC1 also partially decreased γH2AX foci staining after IR. 5Z. Lou, C. C. S. Chini, K. Minter-Dykhouse, and J. Chen, unpublished observation. This is different from a previous report (11Peng A. Chen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8873-8876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) that showed intact γH2AX foci formation in cells transfected with MDC1 siRNA. This discrepancy could be due to the extent of MDC1 down-regulation by different siRNAs used. On the other hand, consistent with the previous report (11Peng A. Chen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8873-8876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), we also observed that down-regulation of H2AX abolished MDC1 foci formation in response to DNA damage.5 These findings suggest that H2AX phosphorylation and MDC1 foci formation depend on each other, possibly by forming a positive feedback loop: γH2AX recruits MDC1 to the sites of DNA damage, which in turn enhances the phosphorylation of H2AX by ATM. These findings also raise the possibility that γH2AX and MDC1 cooperate as early signaling molecules to amplify ATM-dependent DNA damage signals. In response to DNA damage, BRCA1 (12Scully R. Chen J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 47755-47758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), form nuclear foci. These nuclear foci colocalize with γH2AX foci, which reside at the sites of DNA damage (17Rogakou E.P. Boon C. Redon C. Bonner W.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 905-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1985) Google Scholar, 18Paull T.T. Rogakou E.P. Yamazaki V. Kirchgessner C.U. Gellert M. Bonner W.M. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 886-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar). MDC1 also redistributes to nuclear foci in response to DNA damage (5Shang Y. Bodero A. Chen P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6323-6329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 6Xu X. Stern D.F. J. Biol.

Similarly MDC1 foci colocalized with BRCA1 foci (Fig.2A). Furthermore we found that MDC1 co-immunoprecipitated with BRCA1. This interaction is constitutive, occurring independently of DNA damage (Fig.2B). Given that BRCA1 forms a stable heterodimeric complex with BARD1 in vivo (19Wu L.C. Wang Z.W. Tsan J.T. Spillman M.A. Phung A. Xu X.L. Yang M.C. Hwang L.Y. Bowcock A.M. Baer R. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar), we further determined whether MDC1 could also associate with BARD1. As shown in Fig. 2B, similar to BRCA1, BARD1 also associates with MDC1. These results suggest that MDC1 interacts with the BRCA1·BARD1 complex and may be involved in a BRCA1-mediated genome maintenance function. The interaction between MDC1 and BRCA1 led us to investigate the relationship between MDC1 and BRCA1. We used siRNA technology to down-regulate either BRCA1 or MDC1. Transfection of HeLa cells with BRCA1 siRNA or MDC1 siRNA resulted in the depletion of BRCA1 and MDC1, respectively (Figs. 3, A andB, and 4A). As shown in Fig. 3A, depletion of MDC1 by siRNA transfection led to a complete loss of BRCA1 foci in response to DNA damage (from 80% of cells containing BRCA1 foci in control samples to 4% in the MDC1 siRNA-transfected sample) (Fig. 3A). Only cells that retained MDC1 expression still formed BRCA1 foci (data not shown). Conversely, although transfection of HeLa cells with BRCA1 siRNA resulted in a loss of BRCA1 in 90% of the transfected cells (Fig. 3B and data not shown), the relocalization of MDC1 to nuclear foci following DNA damage was not affected by the depletion of BRCA1 (Fig. 3B). Furthermore the disappearance of BRCA1 foci in MDC1 siRNA-transfected cells is not due to a change in kinetics of BRCA1 foci formation since we could not detect BRCA1 foci either 6 h (data not shown) or 16 h after DNA damage (Fig. 3A). In unirradiated control cells, there are a subset of cells that contain BRCA1 foci (30%), which are the previously reported S-phase BRCA1 foci (12Scully R. Chen J. Ochs R.L. Keegan K. Hoekstra M. Feunteun J. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 425-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). Interestingly transfection of MDC1 siRNA in these cells led to a dramatic decrease of cells containing these BRCA1 S-phase foci (2% of cells containing BRCA1 foci) (Fig. 3A), suggesting that BRCA1 S-phase foci formation may also require MDC1. Transfection with a control siRNA, which was generated by introducing point mutations into MDC1 siRNA, had no effect on BRCA1 foci formation (Fig. 3A). Furthermore transfection with a second, different MDC1 siRNA (siRNA2) also abolished the localization of BRCA1 to nuclear foci (data not shown). Taken together these data strongly suggest that MDC1 is required for the recruitment of BRCA1 to the sites of DNA damage.Figure 4MDC1 regulates Chk1 activation and G2/M checkpoint in response to DNA damage.

This is in agreement with early studies using H2AX-deficient mouse cells (20Celeste A. Petersen S. Romanienko P.J. Fernandez-Capetillo O. Chen H.T. Sedelnikova O.A. Reina-San-Martin B. Coppola V. Meffre E. Difilippantonio M.J. Redon C. Pilch D.R. Olaru A. Eckhaus M. Camerini-Otero R.D. Tessarollo L. Livak F. Manova K. Bonner W.M. Nussenzweig M.C. Nussenzweig A.

However, it is unlikely that MDC1 regulates BRCA1 foci formation solely through influencing γH2AX since MDC1 siRNA only partially reduced γH2AX foci (data not shown) but completely abolished BRCA1 foci in response to IR (Fig. 3A). In addition, while MDC1 regulated BRCA1 S-phase foci formation (Fig. 3A), H2AX does not seem to be required for the formation of BRCA1 S-phase foci (data not shown and see Ref. 20Celeste A. Petersen S. Romanienko P.J. Fernandez-Capetillo O. Chen H.T. Sedelnikova O.A. Reina-San-Martin B. Coppola V. Meffre E. Difilippantonio M.J. Redon C. Pilch D.R. Olaru A. Eckhaus M. Camerini-Otero R.D. Tessarollo L. Livak F. Manova K. Bonner W.M. Nussenzweig M.C. Nussenzweig A. Science. 2002; 296: 922-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). Finally, while H2AX is dispensable for DNA damage-induced hyperphosphorylation of BRCA1 (data not shown), MDC1 is required for BRCA1 phosphorylation following DNA damage (see below). BRCA1 is phosphorylated by ATM at multiple residues including Ser-1387, Ser-1423, Ser-1457, and Ser-1524 after irradiation (22Cortez D. Wang Y. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Science. 1999; 286: 1162-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar, 23Gatei M. Scott S.P. Filippovitch I. Soronika N. Lavin M.F. Weber B. Khanna K.K. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3299-3304PubMed Google Scholar). To further investigate the role of MDC1 in the regulation of BRCA1, we examined the phosphorylation of BRCA1 following DNA damage in MDC1-deficient cells. As shown in Fig. 3C, transfection with MDC1 siRNA resulted in defective hyperphosphorylation of BRCA1 following DNA damage as judged by its mobility shift by SDS-PAGE or by blotting with antibodies against phosphoserine 1524 of BRCA1. However, BRCA1 phosphorylation is normal in cells transfected with H2AX siRNA (data not shown). It is worth mentioning that the defective BRCA1 phosphorylation in MDC1 siRNA-transfected cells is only observed with low doses of irradiation (10 Gy or lower). When higher doses of irradiation are used (30 Gy), phosphorylation of BRCA1 observed in MDC1 siRNA-transfected cells is similar to that in control cells (data not shown), suggesting the possibility that an alternative pathway for BRCA1 phosphorylation is activated at higher doses. Recently 53BP1 has also been reported to regulate BRCA1 foci formation and phosphorylation (24Wang B. Matsuoka S. Carpenter P.B. Elledge S.J. Science. 2002; 298: 1435-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). It is possible that MDC1 and 53BP1 might work together in regulating BRCA1 following DNA damage. The defective BRCA1 localization and phosphorylation in MDC1 siRNA-transfected cells suggests that MDC1 might regulate BRCA1-mediated functions. It is well established that BRCA1 is involved in the maintenance of genome stability. BRCA1 participates in a number of activities following DNA damage including DNA repair (25Gowen L.C. Avrutskaya A.V. Latour A.M. Koller B.H. Leadon S.A. Science. 1998; 281: 1009-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), Chk1 activation (26Yarden R.I. Pardo-Reoyo S. Sgagias M. Cowan K.H. Brody L.C. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), S-phase and G2/M checkpoint control (27Xu X. Weaver Z. Linke S.P. Li C. Gotay J. Wang X.W. Harris C.C. Ried T.

Biol. 2001; 21: 3445-3450Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), and cell survival (22Cortez D. Wang Y. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Science. 1999; 286: 1162-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). This prompted us to investigate how MDC1 affects BRCA1-mediated downstream events. Using MDC1 siRNA or BRCA1 siRNA, which specifically down-regulated MDC1 and BRCA1, respectively (Fig. 4A), we first examined the Chk1 activation following DNA damage. In response to DNA damage, Chk1 is phosphorylated at Ser-317 and Ser-345, and the phosphorylation of these sites is required for Chk1 activation (29Zhao H. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4129-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of either BRCA1 or MDC1 resulted in decreased Chk1 phosphorylation following DNA damage (Fig. 4B). BRCA1 has recently been shown to regulate the G2/M checkpoint, probably through its regulation of Chk1 activation (26Yarden R.I. Pardo-Reoyo S. Sgagias M. Cowan K.H. Brody L.C. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Thus, we next examined the G2/M checkpoint control in cells depleted of MDC1. As shown in Fig. 4C, HeLa cells transfected with control siRNA showed a marked decrease in mitotic fraction in response to γ irradiation. However, similar to cells transfected with BRCA1 siRNA, cells transfected with MDC1 siRNA showed significantly greater mitotic fraction after γ irradiation, suggesting a G2/M checkpoint defect in cells lacking MDC1 or BRCA1. Taken together these results suggest that MDC1 is involved in the G2/M checkpoint, probably through regulating the BRCA1-Chk1 pathway. Emerging evidence suggests that MDC1 is an important mediator of DNA damage responses. In addition to its role in BRCA1 foci formation and phosphorylation, MDC1 also interacts with activated Chk2 and regulates S-phase checkpoint, p53 stabilization, and radiation-induced apoptosis (7Lou Z. Minter-Dykhouse K. Wu X. Chen J. Nature. 2003; 421: 957-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). A recent report also links MDC1 to the Chk2 pathway (11Peng A. Chen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8873-8876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Furthermore we and others have shown that MDC1 regulates NBS1 foci formation.3,5 These findings suggest that MDC1 regulates multiple DNA damage signaling pathways. MDC1 contains several protein-protein interaction domains including the FHA domain, BRCT domain, and internal repeated sequences. It is plausible that MDC1 acts as an adaptor protein to recruit downstream signaling molecules to the sites of DNA damage in a role similar to that of Grb2 or Shc in receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated signaling pathways. In summary, we have shown that MDC1 regulates BRCA1 foci formation, phosphorylation, and G2/M checkpoint control in response to DNA damage. These results establish a critical role of MDC1 in the regulation of DNA damage checkpoint. Given that dysregulation of DNA damage checkpoints (e.g. mutations of p53 and BRCA1) frequently leads to tumorigenesis, one may wonder whether MDC1 functions as a tumor suppressor. Future genetic studies of MDC1 will be conducted to test this possibility. We thank Dr. T. Nagase from Kazusa DNA Research Institute for providing MDC1 (Kiaa0170) cDNA and Dr. KumKum Khanna for providing anti-phospho-BRCA1 antibodies.

Although much is known about the activation process, the mechanism by which the tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat5A proteins are inactivated is largely unknown. In this report, we demonstrate that down-regulation of the tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat5A was via dephosphorylation. Using tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides derived from Stat5A, we were able to purify protein-tyrosine phosphatase Shp-2 from cell lysates. Shp-2, but not Shp-1, specifically interacted with Stat5A in vivo, and the interaction was tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent. Moreover, Shp-2 was able to accelerate Stat5A dephosphorylation, and dephosphorylation of Stat5A was dramatically delayed in Shp-2-deficient cells. Therefore, we conclude that Shp-2 is a Stat5A phosphatase, which down-regulates the active Stat5A in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2136384184,"The ligand-binding head region of integrin औ subunits contains a von Willebrand factor type A domain (औA). Ligand binding activity is regulated through conformational changes in औA, and ligand recognition also causes conformational changes that are transduced from this domain. The molecular basis of signal transduction to and from औA is uncertain. The epitopes of mAbs 15/7 and HUTS-4 lie in the औ1 subunit hybrid domain, which is connected to the lower face of औA. Changes in the expression of these epitopes are induced by conformational changes in औA caused by divalent cations, function perturbing mAbs, or ligand recognition. Recombinant truncated α5औ1with a mutation L358A in the α7 helix of औA has constitutively high expression of the 15/7 and HUTS-4 epitopes, mimics the conformation of the ligand-occupied receptor, and has high constitutive ligand binding activity. The epitopes of 15/7 and HUTS-4 map to a region of the hybrid domain that lies close to an interface with the α subunit. Taken together, these data suggest that the transduction of conformational changes through औA involves shape shifting in the α7 helix region, which is linked to a swing of the hybrid domain away from the α subunit.

Integrins are heterodimers containing non-covalently associated α and औ subunits; each subunit has a large extracellular domain linked to a transmembrane segment and a short cytoplasmic tail. Integrins participate in bi-directional signaling; ligand recognition is dynamically regulated by “inside-out” signaling, and ligand occupancy leads to “outside-in” signals that affect cell migration, growth, differentiation, and survival (3Hughes P.E.

Modulation of integrin activity is essential in such processes as leukocyte migration to sites of tissue injury and the aggregation of platelets to form a hemostatic plug. Integrin activation can be mimicked in vitro by divalent cations such as Mn2+ or Mg2+ (6Dransfield I. Cabanas C. Craig A. Hogg N. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Three major conformational states of integrins can be distinguished using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)1: an inactive (resting or low affinity) state, an active (or high affinity) state, and a ligand-occupied state (7Mould A.P. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2613-2618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The conformations of the inactive and active states are discriminated by low and high expression, respectively, of activation epitopes (such as those recognized by 12G10, 15/7, and 9EG7 for the औ1 subunit, see Refs. 8Mould A.P.

The ligand-occupied conformer expresses high levels of ligand-induced binding site (LIBS) epitopes (which are generally also activation epitopes) and shows decreased expression of ligand-attenuated binding site (LABS) epitopes (such as mAb 13 for the औ1 subunit, see Ref. 11Mould A.P.

The conformational states are in equilibrium; therefore, antibodies that recognize activation epitopes or LIBS tend to cause activation and stabilize the ligand-occupied state. Conversely, antibodies that recognize LABS appear to block ligand binding by preventing conformational changes involved in ligand recognition (7Mould A.P. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2613-2618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Mould A.P. Akiyama S.K. Humphries M.J. J. Biol.

The molecular basis of integrin function has been powerfully elucidated by the recent x-ray crystal structures of the extracellular domains of αVऔ3 in both an unliganded state (13Xiong J.-P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R. Scott D.L. Joachimiak A. Goodman S. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2001; 294: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar) and in complex with a small peptide ligand (14Xiong J.-P. Stehle T. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Frech M. Goodman S. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2002; 296: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar). Overall, the integrin structure resembles that of a “head” on two “legs.” The ligand-binding head region of the integrin contains a seven-bladed औ-propeller in the α subunit, the top face of which is in close juxtaposition with a von Willebrand factor type A domain in the औ subunit (औA). औA consists of seven α helices encircling a central औ-sheet and is connected at its N and C termini to an immunoglobulin-like “hybrid” domain and forms an extensive interface with it. The key regions involved in ligand recognition are loops on the upper surface of the औ-propeller and the upper face of the औA, which contains a metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) and an adjacent MIDAS cation-binding site (13Xiong J.-P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R. Scott D.L. Joachimiak A. Goodman S. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2001; 294: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar, 14Xiong J.-P. Stehle T. Zhang R.

Trans. 2000; 28: 311-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A small number of subtle conformational changes between the unliganded and liganded states were observed. The most important of these appeared to be a shift of the α1 helix in औA, and a slight closing up of the interface between the upper surface of the औ-propeller and the upper face of the औA. A surprising feature of the crystal structures was that the two legs are severely bent at the “knees,” such that the head is in close contact with lower legs. Because the peptide ligand was soaked into the crystals of unliganded αVऔ3, it is unclear whether the small conformational changes observed between the unliganded and liganded structures (13Xiong J.-P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R. Scott D.L. Joachimiak A. Goodman S. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2001; 294: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar, 14Xiong J.-P. Stehle T. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Frech M. Goodman S. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2002; 296: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar) are representative of those that take place upon ligand occupancy of the native integrin. Importantly, no pathway for the transduction of conformational changes from the head to the legs (or from legs to head) was evident. Hence, the molecular basis of both outside-in and inside-out signaling remains to be clarified. Recently, evidence (16Belgova N. Blacklow S.C. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 282-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 17Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar) has been presented that the bent form of the integrin is in the inactive state and that this may undergo a switchblade-like straightening to attain the active conformation. Nevertheless, precisely how this straightening is linked to activation of ligand binding in the head domain is uncertain. A key regulator of integrin activity is known to be the conformation of the औA domain (15Humphries M.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 311-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Lu C. Shimoka M. Zang Q. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2393-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), and we have shown that a movement of the α1 helix activates this domain (8Mould A.P. Askari J.A. Barton S. Kline A.D. McEwan P.A. Craig S.E. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19800-19806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the α1 helix could occupy two different positions: position 1 characterized by high binding of the mAb 12G10 (the active conformation), and position 2 characterized by low binding of 12G10 (the inactive conformation). The inward movement of α1 helix observed in the liganded αVऔ3structure (14Xiong J.-P. Stehle T. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Frech M. Goodman S. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2002; 296: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar) supports this proposal. Hence, position 1 appears to correspond to the “in” state and position 2 to the “out” state of the α1 helix. About half of the integrin α subunits contain a similar domain (αA or I), and in these domains an inward movement of the α1 helix is linked to rearrangement of cation-coordinating residues at the MIDAS and a dramatic downward shift of the C-terminal α7 helix and its preceding loop (19Lee O.-J. Bankston L.A. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Structure. 1995; 3: 1333-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). However, no change in the position of the α7 helix of औA was observed between the two x-ray structures, and it was suggested that activation of औA does not involve α7 movement (13Xiong J.-P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R. Scott D.L. Joachimiak A. Goodman S. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2001; 294: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar, 14Xiong J.-P. Stehle T. Zhang R.

Rev. 2002; 186: 125-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Here we provide evidence that changes in the expression of activation epitopes in the hybrid domain are linked to shape-shifting in the α7 helix region of औA. This movement appears to participate in the conformational changes involved in both activation and ligand binding. Our data suggest that an outward swing of the hybrid domain is coupled to α7 helix motion, and hence lend support to a recent model of integrin activation (21Takagi J. Springer T.A. Immunol. Rev. 2002; 186: 141-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). There are both strong similarities and some differences between औA and αA domain activation.

Bound ligand was quantitated by addition of 1:500 dilution of ExtrAvidin® peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) in buffer B for 20 min at room temperature (50 ॖl/well). Wells were then washed four times with buffer B, and color was developed using 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) substrate (50 ॖl/well). Background binding to BSA-coated wells was subtracted from all measurements. Measurements obtained were the mean ± S.D. of four replicate wells. Substitution of human residues with the corresponding residues in murine औ1 within the hybrid domain sequence 361–425 was performed using a PCR-based mutagenesis kit (Gene Tailor, Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. CHOL761h cells were transfected with wild-type or mutant constructs and supernatants harvested as described above. Binding of 15/7, HUTS-4, and TS2/16 to mutant heterodimers was performed as described above, relative to the wild-type control. Background binding to mAbs to wells incubated with supernatant from mock-transfected cells was subtracted from all measurements. Measurements obtained were the mean ± S.D. of three replicate wells. Results shown are mean ± S.D. of three separate experiments. In each assay involving a comparison between different heterodimers, the binding of mAb 8E3 (5 ॖg/ml) was used to normalize any differences between the amounts of the different heterodimers bound to the wells. For example, normalized A405 for 15/7 binding = (AM15/7 −Am15/7) × ((AWT8E3− Am8E3)/(AM8E3 −Am8E3)), whereAM15/7 = mean absorbance of wells coated with mutant integrin; Am15/7 = mean absorbance of wells coated with mock supernatant;AWT8E3 = mean absorbance of 8E3 binding to wells coated with wild-type integrin; Am8E3 = mean absorbance of 8E3 binding to wells coated with mock supernatant, andAM8E3 = mean absorbance of 8E3 binding to wells coated with mutant integrin. 8E3 recognizes a non-functional epitope in the N-terminal region of the औ1 subunit (24Coe A.P.F.

Essentially identical results were obtained from normalization using mAb N29 against the PSI domain (Ref. 27Ni H. Li A. Simonsen N. Wilkins J.A. J. Biol.

In experiments using heterodimers captured from cell culture supernatants, similar results were obtained using protein A-purified heterodimers (data not shown).

This system is particularly useful (a) because it permits the rapid analysis of the effects of mutations, and (b) because conformational changes in the head region can be studied in isolation,i.e. in the absence of any complicating effects due to the presence of the lower leg domains (e.g. unbending, see Refs.16Belgova N.

Expression of the 15/7 and HUTS-4 epitopes by trα5औ1-Fc was found to be cation-modulated (Fig. 1, A and B). Binding of each mAb was promoted by Mn2+ and to a smaller extent by Mg2+, whereas Ca2+ did not stimulate binding. Importantly, these effects parallel the effects of each divalent ion on the ligand-binding competence of the integrin (32Mould A.P. Akiyama S.K. Humphries M.J"

We have previously shown that E. coli invasion of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC)1 is a prerequisite for penetration into the central nervous system in vivo, and identified several E. coli determinants contributing to invasion of HBMEC, including Ibe proteins, AslA, TraJ, and CNF1 (1Huang S.H.

CNF1, a bacterial toxin known to induce host cell cytoskeleton rearrangements, activates Rho GTPases such as RhoA, Cdc42, and Rac1 (9Flatau G. Lemichez E. Gauthier M. Chardin P. Paris S.

CNF1 is a 113-kDa single chain toxin molecule that consists of a N-terminal cell surface receptor binding domain, a C-terminal catalytic domain, and a transmembrane domain in the middle (14Rittinger K.

However, it is unclear how CNF1 enters the eukaryotic cells and activates Rho GTPases. CNF1 has been suggested to be internalized via receptor-mediated endocytosis upon binding to a cell surface receptor (15Lemichez E. Flatau G. Bruzzone M. Boquet P. Gauthier M. Mol.

In this study, for the purpose of identifying CNF1 receptor, the cDNA library of HBMEC was constructed and screened by the yeast two-hybrid system using the N terminus of CNF1 (nCNF1) as bait. We identified for the first time that 37-kDa laminin receptor precursor (LRP) functions as the receptor for CNF1. Exogenous LRP or LRP antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) inhibited CNF1-mediated RhoA activation and bacterial uptake, whereas overexpression of LRP increased binding and effects of CNF1. E. coli K1 strain E44 is a spontaneous rifampin-resistant mutant derived from the cerebrospinal fluid isolate of a neonate with meningitis, strain RS218 (serotype O18:K1:H7). The isogeniccnf1 deletion mutant of strain E44 was previously reported (8Khan N.A. Wang Y. Kim K.J. Chung J.W. Wass C.A. Kim K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15607-15612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). E. coli BL21 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) or XL1-Blue (Stratagene, Ceda Creek, TX) was used for expression of the recombinant proteins. E. coli DH10B (Invitrogen) was used for the construction of the cDNA library. Plasmids pGBKT7 and pGADT7 were purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA), and used for construction of the bait CNF1 and prey cDNA libraries, respectively. Anti-LRP polyclonal antibody was purchased from Abcam (Cambridgeshire, UK). Anti-CNF1 monoclonal antibody NG8 (17Meysick K.C. Mills M. O'Brien A.D. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 2066-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) was a generous gift from Dr. Allison O'Brien (Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD). Plasmid pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences) was used for construction of GST fusion proteins. For bait construction, the N-terminal segment of cnf1 (nCNF1) was amplified by PCR from E44 chromosomal DNA using primers, 5′-aagaattcatgggtaaccatggc-3′ and 5′-acggatccattgctaagtgtcttattgg-3′. The amplified fragments (amino acids 1–299) were cloned into pGBKT7 vector viaEcoRI and BamHI sites (underlined) to create the bait plasmid pGBKT7:nCNF1. Full-length CNF1 (fCNF1, amino acids 1–1007) and the C-terminal fragment of CNF1 (cCNF1, amino acids 720–1007) were amplified using forward primers 5′-aagaattcatgggtaaccatggc-3′ (fCNF1) and 5′-aagaattcagtatcgaaagcacc-3′ (cCNF1) and reverse primer 5′-acggatcccaataccgatatttcgg-3′ and cloned into pGBKT7 vector to construct pGBKT7:fCNF1 and pGBKT7:cCNF1, respectively, following the same strategies as described above. The cDNA library from mRNA of HBMEC was constructed with the SuperScriptTM Choice system (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol, and ligated into prey vector, pGADT7 (Clontech). pGBKT7 contains the DNA binding domain and c-myc epitope, and pGADT7 contains the activation domain and hemagglutinin epitope at the N terminus of the multicloning sites. The whole screening procedure was performed according to the MATCHMAKER protocol from Clontech using yeast strain AH109 as host. The N-terminal domain of CNF1 (nCNF1), C-terminal domain of CNF1 (cCNF1), and full-length CNF1 (fCNF1) were in vitrotranslated from pGBKT7:nCNF1, pGBKT7:cCNF1, and pGBKT7:fCNF1, respectively, using tnt quick coupled transcription/translation systems (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's protocol. pGADT7:LRP-(89–295) was used forin vitro translation of LRP-(89–295) following the same protocol. For ligand overlay assay, HBMEC membrane proteins or the bacterial lysates from E. coli BL21 containing pGADT7:LRP-(89–295) were separated in a SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a PVDF membrane. After washing, the membrane was blocked overnight with 57 skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C, and incubated with in vitro translated [35S]CNF1 for 1 h at room temperature. After extensive washing, radiolabeled CNF1 was detected with a Cyclone PhosphorImager (Packard, Boston, MA). 30 ॖg of total protein of bacterial lysates from E. coli K1 strain E44 or its isogenic cnf1 deletion mutant (E44ΔCNF1) was combined with 10 ॖl of in vitro translated [35S]LRP-(89–295), and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. After incubation, the mixture was precipitated with anti-CNF1 monoclonal antibody NG8 in the presence of protein A-Sepharose (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) in 0.5 ml of co-immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 ॖg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.17 Tween 20 (v/v), and 17 Nonidet P-40) at 4 °C for overnight. After washing, immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE in duplicate. One set was dried and subjected to scan by PhosphorImager and the other was transferred to PVDF membrane, blocked, and incubated with anti-CNF1 monoclonal antibody NG8. The membrane was washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Protein detection was performed with the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Amersham Biosciences). For construction of GST-LRP, full-length LRP was amplified from the HBMEC cDNA library by PCR using primers, 5′-acggatccatgtccggagcccttgat-3′ and 5′-aagaattcttaagaccagtcagtggtt-3′. For GST-CNF1, full-length CNF1 was PCR-amplified from E44 genomic DNA using primers 5′-acggatccatgggtaaccatggc-3′ and 5′-aagaattccaataccgatatttcgg-3′. Amplified fragments were cloned into pGEX-2T (Amersham biosciences) via BamHI andEcoRI sites, and introduced into E. coliXL1-Blue. Expression and purification of the recombinant proteins were performed with a GST purification kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. HBMECs were isolated and cultured as described previously (18Stins M.F. Gilles F. Kim K.S. J. Neuroimmunol. 1997; 76: 81-90Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Briefly, HBMECs were grown in RPMI 1640 containing 107 heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 107 Nu-Serum, 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm pyruvate, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 ॖg/ml), essential amino acids, and vitamins. HEp-2 cells were purchased from ATCC (ATCC CCL 23), maintained and cultured according to the provider's protocol. To examine the effects of LRP in CNF1-mediated RhoA activation, RhoA-GTP assays were performed as described previously (8Khan N.A. Wang Y. Kim K.J. Chung J.W. Wass C.A. Kim K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15607-15612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Briefly, HBMEC or HEp-2 cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.17 SDS, 0.57 sodium deoxycholate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 25 mmऔ-glycerophosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 17 Triton X-100, 1 mmNa3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 ॖg/ml aprotinin, 1 ॖg/ml leupeptin, and 1 ॖg/ml pepstatin). GlutathioneS-transferase-rhotekin beads (Upstate Biotechnologies, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) were incubated with cytosolic fractions of the cells for 1 h at 4 °C by head over head rotation to collect active forms of RhoA, i.e. RhoA-GTP. After washing three times with lysis buffer, the protein complex was resolved by 127 SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane. The blots were blocked with 25 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.17 Tween 20 containing 47 skim milk for 30 min at room temperature. After blocking, the membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with mouse monoclonal antibody against RhoA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and subsequently incubated for 60 min at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody against mouse. Antibody-bound RhoA was visualized using an ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). A single band of RhoA in the 21-kDa range was detected. The density of RhoA-GTP bands were quantitated using an imaging densitometer. Invasion assays were performed as described previously (8Khan N.A. Wang Y. Kim K.J. Chung J.W. Wass C.A. Kim K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15607-15612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Briefly, confluent HBMEC in 24-well plates were incubated with 107E. coli (multiplicity of infection of 100) in experimental medium (M199-Ham's F-12 (1:1) containing 57 heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 1 mm pyruvate). Plates were incubated at 37 °C in 57 CO2 incubator for 90 min. Monolayers were washed with RPMI 1640 and extracellular bacteria were killed by 1 h incubation in experimental media containing gentamicin (100 ॖg/ml). The monolayers were washed again and lysed in 0.57 Triton X-100. The released intracellular bacteria were enumerated by plating on sheep blood agar plates. To determine the role of LRP on CNF1-induced E. coliK1 invasion, monolayers were incubated with a mixture of 3 ॖg/ml CNF1 and 30 ॖg/ml GST-LRP or GST in experimental medium for 2 h before addition of bacteria and HBMEC invasion assays were carried out as described above. Full-length LRP was amplified from the HBMEC cDNA library by PCR using primers, 5′-acggatccatgtccggagcccttgat-3′ and 5′-aagaattcttaagaccagtcagtggtt-3′, and cloned into the vector pcDNA3.1/His A (Invitrogen) via BamHI andEcoRI sites (underlined) to create pcDNA3.1:LRP. HBMEC stably transfected with pcDNA3.1 or pcDNA3.1:LRP was seeded in 96-well plates. Upon confluence, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.057 Tween 20 and different concentrations of GST-CNF1 or no ligand in binding buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.057 Tween 20 and 27 bovine serum albumin) were added to each well. After 1 h incubation at room temperature, the ligand was aspirated and the cells were washed five times with binding buffer. After washing, anti-GST polyclonal antibody (Amersham Biosciences) was added, and the cells were further incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, the cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti-goat IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase. To detect binding of GST-CNF1,p-nitrophenyl phosphate was added to each well and the color change was quantitated at 405 nm on a microplate spectrophotometer. Based on the human LAMR1 cDNA sequences, antisense and sense phosphorothiate oligodeoxynucleotides, respectively, were designed against nucleotides 1–20. They were antisense, ACATCAAGGGCTCCGGACAT, and sense, ATGTCCGGAGCCCTTGATGT. HBMEC were transfected with antisense and sense phosphorothiate ODNs with OligofectAMINE (Invitrogen) followed by manufacturer's protocol and 48 h was allowed for HBMEC cells to uptake the ODNs. In an attempt to identify the CNF1 receptor, we screened a cDNA library of HBMEC by the yeast two-hybrid system using the N terminus of CNF1 (nCNF1) as bait. We screened more than 2 × 106 individual clones from a HBMEC cDNA library and identified nine positive clones at the highest stringency selection conditions (Trp-, Leu-, His-, Ade-). Sequence analysis revealed that one of the nine colonies contained a putative transmembrane domain, which showed a 1007 match to the partial sequence (amino acids 89–295) of LAMR1 encoding laminin receptor precursor (LRP). LRP is comprised of a cytoplasmic N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–85), and an extracellular C-terminal domain (amino acids 102–295) that are separated by a transmembrane domain (amino acids 86–101) (19Sorokin A.V.

This clone was further characterized for its interaction with CNF1 by retransformation. A yeast colony co-transformed with pGADT7:LRP-(89–295) and pGBKT7:nCNF1 was positive in both growth on the selection medium (Leu-, Trp-, His-, Ade-) and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-औ-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) assays (Fig. 1a). Similarly, interaction between fCNF1 and LRP-(89–295) in yeast was observed (Fig.1a). In contrast, co-transformation with pGADT7:LRP-(89–295) and pGBKT7:cCNF1 or pGBKT7 vector alone did not restore growth ability or enzyme activity (Fig. 1a), suggesting that the LRP-(89–295) binds to full-length CNF1 and nCNF1, but not to cCNF1 in vivo. To validate the results obtained with the yeast two-hybrid systemin vitro, coimmunoprecipitation was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” When the bacterial lysates containing CNF1 were mixed with in vitro translated radiolabeled LRP-(89–295) ([35S]LRP-(89–295)), LRP-(89–295) was detected in immunoprecipitates with anti-CNF1 monoclonal antibody whereas no LRP-(89–295) was detected in the absence of CNF1 (Fig. 1b). In parallel with the yeast two-hybrid screening, a [35S]CNF1 ligand overlay assay was performed to identify and confirm the cell surface receptor for CNF1. Membrane proteins of HBMEC were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the overlay assay was performed. In this experiment, a protein of 37 kDa was identified as an interacting protein with either [35S]nCNF1 or [35S]fCNF1, but no membrane protein was detected with [35S]cCNF1 (Fig.2a). To verify the specific interactions between CNF1 and the putative receptor, we performed the overlay assay after preincubation of the membrane with non-radiolabeled nCNF1, which totally blocked binding of radiolabeled nCNF1 to the membrane (Fig. 2a). Because LRP was identified as a CNF1 receptor with yeast two-hybrid screening, we speculated that this 37-kDa protein might be LRP. We next recovered the prey vector containing tagged hemagglutinin (pGADT7:LRP-(89–295)) from the yeast and introduced it into E. coli. Bacterial lysates containing HA-tagged LRP-(89–295) were subjected to [35S]nCNF1 ligand overlay assay to verify that CNF1 indeed binds to LRP-(89–295)in vitro. [35S]nCNF1 bound LRP-(89–295) when the protein was expressed (Fig. 2b, left panel,lane 2), whereas bound [35S]nCNF1 was not detected in the absence of LRP-(89–295) (Fig. 2b,left panel, lane 1). Western blot using anti-hemagglutinin monoclonal antibody indicates that the protein detected with the [35S]CNF1 overlay assay migrates at the same molecular weight as HA-tagged LRP-(89–295) (Fig. 2b,right panel). These results taken together indicate that the extracellular domain of LRP binds to CNF1 and thus is likely to be the receptor that mediates the CNF1 biologic activity, such as RhoA activation and enhancement of bacterial uptake. We and others have previously shown that CNF1 activates RhoA in HBMEC and other eukaryotic cells such as HEp-2 cells (8Khan N.A. Wang Y. Kim K.J. Chung J.W. Wass C.A. Kim K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15607-15612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 9Flatau G. Lemichez E. Gauthier M. Chardin P. Paris S. Fiorentini C. Boquet P.

Nature. 1997; 387: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of LRP on CNF1-induced RhoA activation, HBMEC or HEp-2 cells were treated with CNF1 with or without GST-LRP, and total lysates were compared for the activated GTP-bound form of RhoA as described previously (8Khan N.A. Wang Y. Kim K.J. Chung J.W. Wass C.A. Kim K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15607-15612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The amount of RhoA-GTP was quantitated from the blot using an imaging densitometer, and normalized to the values of controls where the cells were treated with only GST. CNF1, as expected, increased RhoA activation in HBMEC and HEp-2 cells by 60 and 917, respectively (Fig.3). However, when CNF1 was added in the presence of GST-LRP, the levels of RhoA activation decreased by 44 and 507, respectively, in HBMEC and HEp-2 cells when compared with CNF1-treated HBMEC or HEp-2 cells in the presence of GST. GST alone did not have any inhibitory effect on CNF1-induced RhoA activation (Fig.3). These results suggest that exogenous LRP competes with endogenous LRP for CNF1 binding, and acts as an inhibitor of RhoA activation by CNF1 in both HBMEC and HEp-2 cells. We have previously shown that CNF1 increases E. coli K1 invasion of HBMEC (8Khan N.A. Wang Y. Kim K.J. Chung J.W. Wass C.A. Kim K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15607-15612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). We next examined whether exogenous LRP inhibited CNF1-induced enhancement of bacterial uptake. CNF1-treated cells showed an approximately 4007 increase in E. coli E44 invasion compared with non-treated cells (Fig. 4). Consistent with the results obtained from RhoA-GTP assays where GST-LRP decreased CNF1-mediated RhoA activation in response to CNF1, the enhancement of E. coli uptake into HBMEC was significantly (p < 0.05) decreased when CNF1 was co-incubated with GST-LRP compared with CNF1 alone or with GST incubation (Fig. 4). These results suggest that GST-LRP effectively inhibits E. coliinvasion by sequestering CNF1. To confirm the binding of CNF1 to LRP in HBMEC, HBMECs were stably transfected with pcDNA3.1:LRP and the binding of GST-CNF1 to HBMEC was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The binding of CNF1 to HBMEC was dose-dependent, but was markedly greater when LRP was overexpressed, compared with control vector-transfected cells (Fig. 5a). These results suggest a specific interaction between CNF1 and HBMEC via LRP, thus supporting the concept that LRP is the receptor for CNF1. In addition, CNF1-mediated bacterial uptake was significantly (p < 0.05) greater in LRP overexpressing cells (Fig. 5b). Also, CNF1-mediated RhoA activation was markedly greater in LRP-overexpressing HBMEC (Fig. 5c). Quantification of the RhoA-GTP amount with densitometry showed 427 higher activation of RhoA by CNF1 in LRP overexpressing cells than in the control cells (Fig.5c). These results support our finding that LRP acts as the CNF1 receptor, thus mediating CNF1-mediated bacterial uptake and RhoA activation in HBMEC. To confirm correlation between CNF1 effects and level of LRP expression, HBMEC were treated with LRP antisense ODNs before RhoA-GTP or invasion assays. Treatment of HBMEC with LRP antisense ODNs decreased LRP expression by 627 compared with the sense ODN-treated HBMEC (Fig.6a). CNF1 effects on RhoA activation were decreased when the expression of LRP was reduced by antisense ODN treatment, whereas sense ODN treatment did not show noticeable changes in CNF1 effects, when compared with wild type HBMEC (Fig. 6b). For example, RhoA activation by CNF1 in HBMEC was 747 decreased with LRP antisense ODNs compared with non-treated cells, whereas the effect of LRP sense ODNs was negligible (Fig.6b). CNF1-mediated bacterial uptake was also significantly (p < 0.01) decreased in LRP antisense ODN-treated HBMEC compared with sense ODN-treated HBMEC (Fig. 6b). These results taken together indicate that LRP acts as the CNF1 receptor, thus mediating CNF1-mediated bacterial uptake and RhoA activation. We have previously shown that CNF1 contributes to E. coli K1 invasion of HBMEC in vitro and traversal of the blood-brain barrier in the experimental hematogenous meningitis animal model (8Khan N.A.

CNF1 is a protein belonging to the group of dermonecrotizing toxins, produced by pathogenic E. coli (20Caprioli A. Falbo V. Roda L.G. Ruggeri F.M. Zona C. Infect. Immun. 1983; 39: 1300-1306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Blanco J. Blanco M. Alonso M.P. Blanco J.E. Garabal J.I. Gonzalez E.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 75: 155-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is described as AB toxins, such as diphtheria, cholera, and tetanus toxins, which are comprised of catalytic domain, cell binding domain, and membrane translocation domain (22Falnes P.O. Sandvig K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Entry of CNF1 into eukaryotic cells includes binding to a host receptor and internalization via an endocytic mechanism (16Contamin S. Galmiche A. Doye A. Flatau G. Benmerah A. Boquet P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1775-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Endocytosed CNF1 is routed to the degradative pathway, i.e. fusion with the late endosome compartment and, its catalytic activity is translocated into the cytosol in an acid-dependent manner (16Contamin S. Galmiche A. Doye A. Flatau G. Benmerah A. Boquet P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1775-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Previous competition experiments suggested the presence of the receptor for CNF1 and the specific interaction between CNF1 and the cellular receptor. For example, the activity of CNF1 was inhibited when the full-length CNF1 was co-incubated with the N-terminal domain of CNF1 while coincubation with the C-terminal domain of CNF1 had no effect on the CNF1 activity (14Rittinger K. Walker P.A. Eccleston J.F. Smerdon S.J. Gamblin S.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 758-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). However, the identity and characteristics of the receptor have not been determined. In the present study, we identified 37-kDa LRP as the CNF1 receptor by the yeast two-hybrid system, co-immunoprecipitation, ligand overlay, and correlating the activity of CNF1 with the expression levels of LRP. LRP has been known to be cell surface non-integrin laminin-binding protein receptors in several cell types, and involved in a variety of cellular mechanisms such as cell migration, adhesion, angiogenesis, and metastasis (23McKenna D.J. Simpson D.A. Feeney S. Gardiner T.A. Boyle C. Nelson J. Stitt A.W. Exp. Eye Res. 2001; 73: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 24Vande Broek I. Vanderkerken K. De Greef C. Asosingh K. Straetmans N. Van Camp B. Van Riet I. Br. J. Cancer. 2001; 85: 1387-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 25Donaldson E.A. McKenna D.J. McMullen C.B. Scott W.N. Stitt A.W. Nelson J. Mol. Cell. Biol. Res. Commun. 2000; 3: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). According to the previous study, the N-terminal domain of LRP (amino acids 1–85) is a cytoplasmic domain, and the C-terminal domain of LRP (amino acids 102–295) is an extracellular domain, which are separated by a transmembrane domain (amino acids 86–101) (19Sorokin A.V. Mikhailov A.M. Kachko A.V. Protopopova E.V. Konovalova S.N. Andrianova M.E. Netesov S.V. Kornev A.N. Loktev V.B. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 2000; 65: 546-553PubMed Google Scholar). Because the cDNA clone identified in this study matches the extracellular domain of LRP containing the transmembrane domain (amino acids 89–295), it is likely that LRP is a receptor for CNF1. In vivo interaction between the N-terminal binding domain of CNF1 and extracellular domain of LRP was verified by cotransformation experiments where yeasts expressing LRP-(89–295) could grow on selection medium only when they are co-expressing fCNF1 or nCNF1, but not cCNF1. This finding is consistent with the previous demonstration that the receptor binding domain is located at the N terminus of CNF1 (14Rittinger K. Walker P.A. Eccleston J.F. Smerdon S.J. Gamblin S.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 758-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed specific interaction between LRP-(89–295) and CNF1 in vitro, and the ligand overlay assay indicated that the CNF1 binding to LRP (or host cell) is mediated by direct interaction between CNF1 containing N-terminal domain and the extracellular domain of LRP. For example, LRP-(89–295) bound to fCNF1 and nCNF1, but not to cCNF1. The interaction between LRP-(89–295) and [35S]nCNF1 was abolished by preincubation with non-labeled nCNF1, proving the specific interaction between nCNF1 and LRP-(89–295). Indeed, exogenous recombinant LRP could inhibit CNF1 activities such as RhoA activation and enhancement of bacterial uptake in HBMEC, by competing with cellular LRP in binding to CNF1. The inhibitory effect of LRP on CNF1 activation of RhoA also occurs in HEp-2 cells, where CNF1 has been shown to induce cytoskeletal rearrangements and bacterial uptake (12Fiorentini C. Arancia G. Caprioli A. Falbo V. Ruggeri F.M. Donelli G. Toxicon. 1988; 26: 1047-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 13Falzano L. Fiorentini C. Donelli G. Michel E. Kocks C. Cossart P. Cabanie L. Oswald E. Boquet P. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 1247-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), suggesting that LRP is a receptor for CNF1 in a variety of eukaryotic cells. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay experiments showed higher binding of CNF1 to HBMEC transfected with pcDNA3.1:LRP than control vector-transfected HBMEC, illustrating the specific interaction between CNF1 and HBMEC via LRP. The effects of CNF1 on bacterial uptake and RhoA activation were, as expected, much higher in LRP-overexpressing HBMEC, possibly because of higher binding of CNF1 to LRP. In contrast, the CNF1 effects were inhibited when the expression of LRP was decreased by antisense ODNs, showing correlation between effects of CNF1 and levels of LRP expression in host cells. LRP has also been identified as the receptor for the cellular prion protein (26Hundt C. Peyrin J.M. Haik S. Gauczynski S. Leucht C. Rieger R. Riley M.L. Deslys J.P. Dormont D. Lasmezas C.I. Weiss S.

However, this is the first demonstration that LRP acts as a cellular receptor for bacterial toxin in activation of RhoA and enhancement of bacterial uptake. Identification of receptors for bacterial toxins has been a challenge, and only a limited number of these receptors have been identified to date (31Backstrom M. Shahabi V. Johansson S. Teneberg S.

Cell. 1992; 69: 1051-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). The identification of a toxin receptor is essential for elucidating structure-functional analysis of a toxin as well as understanding the pathogenesis of toxin-induced diseases. In addition, LRP has been shown to be associated with the progression of a wide variety of carcinomas. For example, the interactions between tumor cells and LRP have been shown to play an important role in tumor invasion and metastasis (33Pellegrini R. Martignone S. Menard S. Colnaghi M.I. Int. J.

Our demonstration of LRP as the receptor for CNF1 suggests that CNF1 protein or CNF1-expressing bacteria may interact with mammalian cells exhibiting higher expression of LRP, and contribute to their transformation to cancer cells. In summary, LRP was identified as the specific receptor for CNF1 by the yeast two-hybrid system and in vitro ligand binding assays. Exogenous LRP competes with endogenous LRP in binding with CNF1, thus decreasing effects of CNF1, such as RhoA activation and bacterial uptake. CNF1-mediated RhoA activation and bacterial uptake were markedly increased when LRP is overexpressed and the effects of CNF1 were decreased when the expression of LRP is reduced by antisense ODN, indicating that LRP functions as the receptor for CNF1. The demonstration that the excess amount of recombinant LRP or LRP antisense ODN could not totally inhibit the effects of CNF1 on RhoA activation or bacterial uptake, however, suggests that there may be an alternative pathway for CNF1 entry into eukaryotic cells, and this issue is currently being investigated in our laboratory.

Increasingly studies are highlighting the major extent to which defects of complex I, the NADH-ubiquinol reductase of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, contribute to human disease pathology. Genetic mutations of subunits in this complex are the leading cause of inherited mitochondrial diseases, which include Leigh's syndrome, Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, and mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (reviewed in Ref. 1Triepels R.H.

Complex I is a large multimeric enzyme complex with an approximate molecular weight of 1 million. The bovine form isolated from beef heart has been analyzed extensively. In total, 45 different putative subunits have been identified, with 7 encoded by the mitochondrial DNA and the remainder of nuclear DNA origin (11Carrol J. Shannon R.J. Fearnley I.M. Walker J.E. Hirst J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50311-50317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Purification protocols described thus far to obtain the enzyme for detailed characterization require large amounts of mitochondria as starting material, often in gram quantities that are not easily obtained from human tissue sources. Given the importance of the enzyme in human diseases, protocols that permit isolation of complex I from small amounts of biopsy tissue and even cell culture material would have great diagnostic utility. Moreover, a rapid procedure is important if multiple samples are being analyzed, for example in screening for protein markers of the above diseases. We have recently described a procedure to obtain complex I at high purity from human heart tissue by the simple method of solubilizing mitochondria in detergent and separating component complexes based on macromolecular size by sucrose gradient fractionation (12Hanson B.J. Schulenberg B. Patton W.F. Capaldi R.A. Electrophoresis. 2001; 22: 950-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The large size of complex I causes this enzyme to sediment in the densest fractions of a sucrose gradient and thus can be isolated in a convenient manner. However, 2.5 mg of mitochondrial protein are typically required, which in turn requires collection of 0.1–1 g of tissue depending on tissue type. More recently, we have described an expedient isolation protocol for both the ATP synthase and PDH complexes from small amounts of human tissue by immunocapture using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 1The abbreviations used are: mAbmonoclonal antibodyF1 α and βATP synthase α and β chainCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flightLCliquid chromatographyMSmass spectrometry made against these respective antigens (13Aggeler R.

The mitochondria were resuspended in the same buffer, supplemented with protease inhibitors (leupeptin at 0.5 mg/ml, pepstatin at 0.5 mg/ml, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at a concentration of 10 mg/ml. An equal volume of 2%n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (Calbiochem) was added to a final crucial concentration of 1% detergent at 5 mg/ml protein and incubated for 30 min on ice.

Antibody cross-linked beads were collected by gentle centrifugation at 3000 rpm in a microfuge and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline. This conjugate was incubated overnight at 4 °C with the supernatant from 10 mg of solubilized mitochondria. Beads were washed six times with phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.05%n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside. Immunocaptured NADH dehydrogenase was eluted twice with 60 μl of 0.1 mglycine, pH 2.5, supplemented with 0.05%n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside. The sample was then dialyzed in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.05%n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside to neutralize the pH of the solution. For one-dimensional electrophoresis samples separated on a 10–22% acrylamide gels containing 0.05% SDS, 0.375 m Tris-HCl pH 8.6. For two-dimensional electrophoresis, 100-μl samples were denatured in 350 μl of rehydration buffer (7 m urea, 2m thiourea, 65 mm dithiothreitol, 0.8% pH 3–10 carrier ampholyte (Fluka), 2% CHAPS (Sigma), 1% Zwittergen 310 (Sigma), 0.1% SDS) for 15 min at room temperature. Each sample was used to hydrate 18-cm immobiline pH gradient strips pH 3–10 (Amersham Biosciences) for 12 h. Then isoelectric focusing was performed in three stages of applied potential difference: 500 V for 1 h, 1000 V for 1 h, and 8000 V for up to 10 h, until 60,000 Vh were achieved. Focused strips were then soaked in SDS-PAGE buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 6 murea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 100 mm dithiothreitol) for 15 min at room temperature. Strips were applied to 15% acrylamide gels for SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Sigma) or Sypro Ruby (Molecular Probes) gel stains. Silver staining was performed according to Shevchenko et al. (16Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar). Sypro Ruby and silver-stained two-dimensional gel spots were excised using a ProteomeWorksTM Robotic Imager and Spot Cutter (Bio-Rad) and processed for mass spectrometric analysis as described previously (17Taylor S.W. Warnock D.E. Glenn G.M. Zhang B. Fahy E. Gaucher S.P. Capaldi R.A. Gibson B.W. Ghosh S.S. J. Proteome Res. 2002; 1: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Silver-stained two-dimensional samples were manually destained in 5 mm potassium ferricyanide and 1 mm sodium thiosulfate, while Sypro Ruby-stained gel spots were destained in a ProGestTM digestion robot (Genomic Solutions Inc.). Reduction, alkylation, and digestion of both Sypro Ruby- and silver-stained two-dimensional gel spots were performed using the ProGest. Silver-stained one-dimensional gel bands (destained as described above) and Coomassie-stained one-dimensional gel bands were manually processed as described previously (13Aggeler R. Coons J.

Half of the final volume of digests from silver- and Sypro Ruby-stained gels (5–8 μl) was further subjected to strong cation exchange ZipTip (Millipore) clean up and concentration. Peptides were eluted directly onto the MALDI targets, and spectra were automatically acquired on a Voyager DE-STRTM as reported previously (17Taylor S.W. Warnock D.E. Glenn G.M. Zhang B. Fahy E. Gaucher S.P. Capaldi R.A. Gibson B.W. Ghosh S.S. J. Proteome Res. 2002; 1: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Peptide mass fingerprints from base-line-corrected, noise-filtered, and de-isotoped peaks were obtained and then analyzed using the program Protein Prospector, MS-Fit (18Clauser K.R. Baker P. Burlingame A.L. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 2871-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar) with and without the Intellical algorithm from Applied Biosystems as described previously (17Taylor S.W. Warnock D.E. Glenn G.M. Zhang B. Fahy E. Gaucher S.P. Capaldi R.A. Gibson B.W. Ghosh S.S. J. Proteome Res. 2002; 1: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Since many of the NADH dehydrogenase subunits are small, predicted peptide mass fingerprints often contained only a limited number of peptides to match to peaks in the MALDI spectra. In these instances we resorted to manual inspection of the MALDI data as outlined in our earlier study (13Aggeler R. Coons J. Taylor S.W. Ghosh S.S. Garcia J.J. Capaldi R.A. Marusich M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33906-33912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The remaining portion of selected digests was subject to automated LC-MS/MS analysis using a MicroTech Ultimate LC system coupled to a Finnigan LCQ™ DECA ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with a Finnigan dynamic nanospray source as described previously (13Aggeler R. Coons J. Taylor S.W. Ghosh S.S. Garcia J.J. Capaldi R.A. Marusich M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33906-33912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Each chromatogram was subsequently analyzed with the program SEQUEST (19Ducret A. Van Oostveen I. Eng J.K. Yates III, J.R. Aebersold R. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 706-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) as described previously (13Aggeler R. Coons J. Taylor S.W. Ghosh S.S. Garcia J.J. Capaldi R.A. Marusich M.F. J. Biol.

The requirement for a protein assignment was at least one peptide for a particular protein having anXcorr of >1.7 for a +1 ion,Xcorr of >2.0 for a +2 ion, andXcorr of >3.0 for a +3 ion. In all cases Δcorr must be greater than 0.1. cDNAs were amplified from a human heart Quickclone library (Clontech) using standard PCR protocols. The following pairs of primers were used (i) GRIM-19: 5′-ATG GCG GCG TCA AAG GTG AAG CAG GAC AT, 3′-CTA CGT GTA CCA CAT GAA GCC GTG GC; (ii) NP17.3, 5′-ATG GCG GCT GGG CTG TTT GG, 3′-TCA CTC ATC CTC TGG CAG CTG G; (iii) NDUFA11, 5′-ATG GCG CCG AAG GTT TTT CG, 3′-TCA CAC CTT GGG TTT TGC AAA CAC CT. We have obtained several monoclonal antibodies that can immunocapture complex I from human tissue. For the experiments described here, we used the antibody 17G3D9E12 a mouse IgG1 monoclonal antibody specific for the NDUFA6 subunit and now available from Molecular Probes Inc. This mAb immunoprecipitated 1 μg of enzyme/250 μg of heart mitochondria, a yield of purified organelle membranes that could be obtained routinely from as little as 10 mg of heart tissue. Fig. 1 shows human complex I subunits separated by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE and visualized with silver stain. Under the gel electrophoresis conditions chosen, 29 protein bands were resolved. Individual subunits were identified by slicing out the protein bands, in gel trypsinization, followed by MALDI-TOF MS peptide mass fingerprinting and LC-MS/MS analysis. As shown in TableI, MALDI-TOF spectrometry identified 23 different complex I polypeptides while LC-MS/MS identified 40 subunits. The subunits A1 and B2 were identified by MALDI-TOF but went undetected by LC-MS/MS, and therefore combining the data from these methods results in identification 42 of the 45 putative complex I subunits. Several impurities of the preparation were detected. Two of the bands resolved in Fig. 1 contained IgG and the F1 α and β subunits, respectively. Other contaminants include ANT1 (ADP ATP carrier protein, human heart/skeletal muscle isoform T1), the complex II 70-kDa protein, the complex III core protein 2, and complex IV subunit 5a (see Fig.2). There is recent evidence for supermolecular complexes of the oxidative phosphorylation machineryin situ (20Schägger H. Pfeiffer K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar), and it appears that at the levels of detergent used (1% lauryl maltoside), which was chosen to minimally disrupt complex I, a small level of association of complexes remains. Nevertheless complex I subunits are greatly concentrated in the immunocapture, and the other oxidative phosphorylation complexes are overwhelmingly present in the supernatant based on Western blotting with specific mAbs to each of these complexes.Table IMALDI-TOF and LC-MS/MS detection of tryptic peptides from complex I subunitsBandMALDI-TOF identificationLC-MS/MS identificationLC-MS/MS peptidesPredicted mature subunit masskDa1(IgG)(IgG)2S1S13077.03(F1α/β)(F1α/β)(55.2/51.8)4V1V11048.65ND5567.06S2S21349.17A10437.18ND4151.69A9A91638.910(ANT1)(ANT1)/ND21(33.0)/39.011S3S3/ND110/326.4/35.712V2V2723.713B9/B10B9/B108/521.7/20.714S7/S8S7/S84/719.8/20.315NP17.31-aNeuronal protein (AAH07362).317.316B8/A8B8/A85/618.8/20.017B7B7816.318B6B6/S45/415.4/15.419B5B5417.02017.2 kDa1-b17.2-kDa protein related to the 13-kDa differentiation association protein (Q9UI09).17.2 kDa1-b17.2-kDa protein related to the 13-kDa differentiation association protein (Q9UI09).1817.121GRIM-191-cGRIM-19 (Q9P0J0).GRIM-191-cGRIM-19 (Q9P0J0).1016.622B4B4515.123A6/C2A6/C25/515.0/14.223A7/ND35/112.4/13.224A11/A5/S55/7/614.9/13.3/12.425S6/B34/410.7/11.326A2/B210.8/8.626A2/V34/110.8/8.427A3/A42/19.3/9.428A11-dThe A4 subunit was detected by MALDI-TOF MS after two-dimensional separation (see Fig. 2).8.029B1B1/AB11/37.0/10.21-a Neuronal protein (AAH07362).1-b 17.2-kDa protein related to the 13-kDa differentiation association protein (Q9UI09).1-c GRIM-19 (Q9P0J0).1-d The A4 subunit was detected by MALDI-TOF MS after two-dimensional separation (see Fig. 2).

Two representative samples are shown for constancy of separation, followed by staining with Sypro Ruby (A) or silver nitrate (B). MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry identified spots are labeled by their SWISS-PROT gene name and predicted isoelectric point. The MS data for spots A9, A3, and S4 did not contain a sufficient number of tryptic peptide detections for automatic polypeptide assignment. Their positions were predicted by a preliminary two-dimensional analysis of bovine complex I (data not shown) and confirmed for A3 and S4 by manual inspection of the MALDI-TOF data as described by Aggeler et al. (13Aggeler R. Coons J. Taylor S.W. Ghosh S.S. Garcia J.J. Capaldi R.A. Marusich M.F. J. Biol.

Two different gels are presented that illustrate the reproducibility of the two-dimensional analysis, one stained with Sypro Ruby, the most sensitive protein detection method available, and the second with silver nitrate for comparison. In total, 21 complex I subunits could be resolved reproducibly when loading 10 μg of protein. While these include mostly the large hydrophilic subunits, good coverage of basic polypeptides is also obtained by this single pH 3–10 isoelectric focusing gel method. Hirst and colleagues (11Carrol J. Shannon R.J. Fearnley I.M. Walker J.E. Hirst J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50311-50317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) have been able to resolve more subunits of the biochemically purified bovine complex I by two-dimensional electrophoresis than the current study by isolating more complex I allowing analysis after subfractionation and also after heavy loading of pH 3–10 and 6–11 isoelectric focusing gel strips. In all, 27 subunits were fully resolved from each other or from impurities either as single bands in one-dimensional or as one or more unique spots on two-dimensional gels. These include all of the nuclear-encoded subunits in which mutations causing human complex I deficiencies have been identified to date. Also uniquely resolved are the two complex I polypeptides, NDUFA9 and NDUFS4, that are known to undergo post-translational modification (11Carrol J. Shannon R.J. Fearnley I.M. Walker J.E. Hirst J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50311-50317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The pattern of spots seen in Fig. 2 has been reproduced more than 10 times with several different preparations of human heart. Interestingly the NDUFA9 protein and the NDUFB4 protein have isoelectric points significantly different from that calculated from published gene sequences (see Fig.2B). While the DNA sequences of almost all of the putative subunits of complex I have been described, this is the first analysis of the protein composition of the human enzyme. Three proteins were found in our complex I preparations that, until this point, have not been studied in the context of human complex I. These subunits are the GRIM-19 protein, the human neuronal protein NP17.3, and a hitherto unnamed hypothetical protein (GenBankTM accession number NP_783313). The homologous proteins B16.6, ESSS, and B14.7, respectively, have all been found in bovine complex I (11Carrol J. Shannon R.J. Fearnley I.M. Walker J.E. Hirst J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50311-50317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 21Fearnley I.M. Carroll J. Shannon R.J. Runswick M.J. Walker J.E. Hirst J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38345-38348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). We have cloned and confirmed the sequence of the cDNAs encoding these proteins from a human heart library (data not shown). Based on the nomenclature developed by Robinson and colleagues (22Duncan A.M. Chow W. Robinson B.H. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1992; 60: 212-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 23Ali S.T. Duncan A.M. Schappert K. Heng H.H. Tsui L.C. Chow W. Robinson B.H. Genomics. 1993; 18: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), the unnamed subunit has been termed NDUFA11, since its bovine counterpart was shown to be a part of the 1α subcomplex. Furthermore, it has been postulated that this protein may be involved in protein import into the mitochondrion (11Carrol J. Shannon R.J. Fearnley I.M. Walker J.E. Hirst J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50311-50317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 24Sasanov L.A. Peak-Chew S.Y. Fearnely I.M. Walker J.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7229-7235Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). This subunit nomenclature has been adopted by the Human Genome Nomenclature Committee. There is a critical need for efficient isolation procedures of intact complex I from human tissue and cell culture material for the molecular diagnosis of genetically derived and late onset neurodegenerative diseases that are associated with deficiencies of this component of the electron transport chain. Because of constraints on the amount of tissue that can be harvested from patients, a rapid protocol, which works for small amounts of biopsy material, blood cells, or cell cultured material, is most desirable. In this report, we describe such a method that uses specific monoclonal antibodies to immunocapture complex I in amounts suitable for one-dimensional and two-dimensional electrophoresis followed by mass spectrometry for compositional analysis. We show that the human complex I purified by this immunocapture method contains the same polypeptides described in the studies of the bovine heart enzyme. A total of 42 different component polypeptides were identified by mass spectrometry after electrophoresis (see Table I). The ND6 protein was not identified in the current study but has been located in band 16 of the gel by a mAb specific for this polypeptide (see Fig. 1). This subunit has also has been detected in sucrose gradient purified complex I, when a larger amount of protein than used here was applied to the gel (25Taylor S.W. Fahy E. Zhang B. Glenn G.M. Warnock D.E. Wiley S. Murphy A.N. Gaucher S.P. Capaldi R.A. Gibson B.W. Ghosh S.S. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). The smallest putative subunit, the NDUFC1 protein, was also detected at a position just below band 29 in this other investigation (25Taylor S.W. Fahy E. Zhang B. Glenn G.M. Warnock D.E. Wiley S. Murphy A.N. Gaucher S.P. Capaldi R.A. Gibson B.W. Ghosh S.S. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). In contrast, ND3 was identified by a single cysteine-containing peptide in the current study but not in the other investigation where reduction and alkylation steps were omitted from gel processing procedures (25Taylor S.W. Fahy E. Zhang B. Glenn G.M. Warnock D.E. Wiley S. Murphy A.N. Gaucher S.P. Capaldi R.A. Gibson B.W. Ghosh S.S. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). The only subunit undetected by either study was ND4L, a hydrophobic mitochondrially encoded polypeptide with only a single large 23 residue trypsin fragment. Present in all preparations was the protein GRIM-19, which has been linked to apoptosis, a 17.2-kDa protein homologous to a cell differentiation associated protein, a so-called neuronal protein NP17.3, and a previously uncharacterized complex I subunit NDUFA11. The bovine homologues of these proteins were recently reported in beef heart complex I as our work was in progress and were termed B16.6, B17.2, ESSS, and B14.7, respectively (11Carrol J. Shannon R.J. Fearnley I.M. Walker J.E. Hirst J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50311-50317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 21Fearnley I.M. Carroll J. Shannon R.J.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It is difficult to establish whether any subunit is abona fide subunit or an adventitiously associated impurity of a complex until the stoichiometry of that polypeptide has been determined and/or a key functional role has been identified. In the case of three of the polypeptides listed above, there are functions ascribed to each that are not related to complex I activity, and at least one, GRIM-19, has been found in both the nucleus and the cytosol (27Angell J.E. Lindner D.J. Shapiro P.S. Hofmann E.R. Kalvakolanu D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33416-33426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Thus our finding that they are all present in the human complex I isolated by a different procedure than that used for the bovine enzyme is significant and supports the notion that they are constituents of complex I. Nevertheless, additional work is necessary to ascertain the function of these ancillary proteins. In summary, we provide rapid purification of complex I from small amounts of human tissue, which will be useful in studying mitochondrial diseases involving complex I and invaluable in screening for post-translational modifications of the complex in neurodegenerative diseases. Importantly, 21 of the 45 subunits can be resolved to unique spots by two-dimensional gels using as little as 10 μg of the enzyme complex. These include all of the nuclear subunits currently found to contain mutations causing diseases and the two subunits with known post-translational modifications. We show that the normal human heart enzyme has the same composition as the bovine counterpart and must contain at least 45 different subunits together having a molecular weight close to 1 million."

Included in the TPR cochaperones are the Hsp70-Hsp90-organizing protein Hop, the FK506-binding immunophilins FKBP52 and FKBP51, the cyclosporin A-binding immunophilin CyP40, and protein phosphatase PP5. The TPR domains from these proteins have similar x-ray crystallographic structures and target cochaperone binding to the MEEVD sequence that terminates Hsp90. However, despite these similarities, the TPR cochaperones have distinctive properties for binding Hsp90 and assembling with Hsp90·steroid receptor complexes. To identify structural features that differentiate binding of FKBP51 and FKBP52 to Hsp90, we generated an assortment of truncation mutants and chimeras that were compared for coimmunoprecipitation with Hsp90. Although the core TPR domain (approximately amino acids 260–400) of FKBP51 and FKBP52 is required for Hsp90 binding, the C-terminal 60 amino acids (∼400-end) also influence Hsp90 binding. More specifically, we find that amino acids 400–420 play a critical role for Hsp90 binding by either FKBP. Within this 20-amino acid region, we have identified a consensus sequence motif that is also present in some other TPR cochaperones. Additionally, the final 30 amino acids of FKBP51 enhance binding to Hsp90, whereas the corresponding region of FKBP52 moderates binding to Hsp90. Taking into account the x-ray crystal structure for FKBP51, we conclude that the C-terminal regions of FKBP51 and FKBP52 outside the core TPR domains are likely to assume alternative conformations that significantly impact Hsp90 binding.

Mutation of the MEEVD sequence typically inhibits binding by a TPR cochaperone, although mutations in other C-terminal sequences impact binding by TPR cochaperones differentially (13Chen S.

In particular, FKBP52 and FKBP51, which share ∼707 amino acid sequence similarity, affect hormone binding by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in opposing manners. A study in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which lacks endogenous counterparts to FKBP52 or FKBP51, has shown that FKBP52, specifically, can elevate GR responsiveness to hormone (18Riggs D.L. Roberts P.J. Chirillo S.C. Cheung-Flynn J. Prapapanich V. Ratajczak T. Gaber R. Picard D. Smith D.F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1158-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Although FKBP51 alone does not reduce GR activity in yeast, it can effectively block the potentiation mediated by FKBP52 when coexpressed (18Riggs D.L. Roberts P.J. Chirillo S.C. Cheung-Flynn J. Prapapanich V. Ratajczak T. Gaber R. Picard D. Smith D.F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1158-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Scammell and his colleagues (19Reynolds P.D. Ruan Y. Smith D.F.

Bourgeois and colleagues (22Baughman G. Wiederrecht G.J. Campbell N.F. Martin M.M. Bourgeois S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4395-4402Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) first noted that the gene for FKBP51 is up-regulated by glucocorticoids, and this observation has been confirmed repeatedly by recent gene expression profiles of steroid-responsive genes. The inducibility of FKBP51 by glucocorticoids could provide a mechanism for partial desensitization of cells subsequent to an initial exposure to hormone (23Cheung J. Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar).It is not clear which structural features are responsible for the differential effects of FKBP52 and FKBP51. Three-dimensional crystallographic structures for FKBP51 have recently been solved (24Sinars C.R. Cheung-Flynn J. Rimerman R.A. Scammell J.G. Smith D.F. Clardy J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 868-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), but there is no corresponding structure for FKBP52. Based on the 707 amino acid sequence similarity of FKBP51 and FKBP52 and the conservation of apparent domain sequences, there is no reason to suspect a dramatic structural difference. Nonetheless, previous studies from us showed that mutations in the C-terminal half of Hsp90 have different effects on binding by FKBP52 versus FKBP51 (13Chen S. Sullivan W.P. Toft D.O. Smith D.F. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1998; 3: 118-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Also, we observed that an exchange of sequences between the FKBP TPR domains had no effect on Hsp90 binding by FKBP52 but blocked binding by FKBP51 (25Barent R.L. Nair S.C. Carr D.C. Ruan Y. Rimerman R.A. Fulton J. Zhang Y. Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 342-354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggested that each FKBP has a distinctive interaction with Hsp90. In the current study, we have taken advantage of the x-ray crystallographic structure of FKBP51 to map functionally sequences of FKBP51 and FKBP52 that are important for Hsp90 binding. We find that sequences in the C-terminal region, both inside and outside the TPR domain, greatly influence FKBP binding to Hsp90.RESULTSThe three-dimensional crystallographic structure for FKBP51 (Protein Data Bank code 1KT1) depicted in Fig.1A reveals three major structural domains. Of the two FKBP12-like domains, peptidylprolyl isomerase and FK506 binding activities reside in FK1 (24Sinars C.R. Cheung-Flynn J. Rimerman R.A. Scammell J.G. Smith D.F. Clardy J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 868-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The Hsp90 binding TPR domain has a structure similar to that of other described TPR domains, in particular the Hsp90 binding domains from PP5 (26Das A.K. Cohen P.W. Barford D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1192-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar), Hop (16Scheufler C. Brinker A. Bourenkov G. Pegoraro S. Moroder L. Bartunik H. Hartl F.U. Moarefi I. Cell. 2000; 101: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar), and CyP40 (27Taylor P. Dornan J. Carrello A. Minchin R.F. Ratajczak T. Walkinshaw M.D. Structure. 2001; 9: 431-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The consensus TPR motifs terminate with helix 6 (H6, Fig. 1B); however, similar to structures for PP5 and CyP40, there is a seventh helix that extends beyond the core TPR domain for a minimum of 23 amino acids. How much further H7 may extend is unclear because the final 36 amino acids could not be resolved from crystal data. Although a crystal structure for FKBP52 has not been reported, it seems likely that it will share the same overall domain organization as FKBP51.FKBP Regions Required for Hsp90 and Receptor InteractionsAs presented in Fig. 2, an initial set of FKBP51 and FKBP52 mutants (Fig. 2A) was surveyed to compare interactions with Hsp90 and steroid receptor complexes. Coimmunoprecipitations of radiolabeled FKBP51 mutants (Fig.2B) and FKBP52 mutants (Fig. 2C) were used to monitor Hsp90 binding (left panels) and assembly into PR complexes (right panels). We consistently found that incorporation of FKBP51 exceeded that of FKBP52 by 2–3-fold in Hsp90 complexes (compare lanes 1 and 2 in each data set). In line with previous observations (25Barent R.L. Nair S.C. Carr D.C. Ruan Y. Rimerman R.A. Fulton J. Zhang Y. Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 342-354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), FKBP51 recovery in PR complexes exceeded the recovery of FKBP52 by 5-fold or greater (comparelanes 8 and 9 in each set). The TPR truncation mutants, which included the TPR domain plus C-terminal sequences, were sufficient for binding Hsp90 (lane 3) and assembling with PR complexes (lane 10). The TPR region was necessary for binding Hsp90 and assembling with PR because the FK domains showed no interactions (lanes 4 and 11 in each set). The importance of the TPR domain is demonstrated further by point mutation at one of the carboxylate clamp residues (K352A for FKBP51 and K354A for FKBP52) that abrogates Hsp90 binding and PR association (lanes 5 and 12). To test whether C-terminal sequences influence protein interactions, truncation mutants (N404 and N406) were generated which lacked sequences within H7 extension (see Fig. 1B) and beyond. Despite retention of the core TPR domain in these constructs, Hsp90 binding (lane 6 in both sets) and PR association (lane 13 in both sets) were largely abrogated. The final samples in this mutant series were a pair of chimeric constructs (395 for FKBP51 and 397 for FKBP52) in which the region from the H7 extension through the C terminus was exchanged between FKBPs. This exchange had little effect on FKBP52 (Fig.2C, lanes 7 and 14) but greatly diminished interactions of FKBP51 with Hsp90 and PR (Fig. 2B,lanes 7 and 14). In an earlier study (25Barent R.L. Nair S.C. Carr D.C. Ruan Y. Rimerman R.A. Fulton J. Zhang Y. Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 342-354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in which the C-terminal region was retained but TPR motifs were exchanged, we observed a similar phenomenon; the FKBP52-based construct functioned normally, but the FKBP51-based construct lost the ability to bind Hsp90 or assemble with PR complexes.Figure 2Mutant FKBP interactions with Hsp90 and steroid receptor.A, the diagrams depict a series of mutant forms generated for either FKBP51 or FKBP52, respectively. In descending order, these are the full-length wild type protein (wt), a truncation mutant containing the TPR domain through the C terminus (TPR), a truncation mutant containing the N terminus through the FK domains (FK), a point mutant in the TPR domain (K352A or K354A), a truncation mutant that terminates just beyond the TPR domain (N404 or N406), and a chimera in which the C-terminal sequences were exchanged (chimera 395 or 397). B, the ability of mutant forms of FKBP51 to bind Hsp90 (leftpanels) and assemble in vitro with PR complexes (right panels) is shown in comparison with human FKBP52. Radiolabeled proteins were generated by in vitroexpression, and equivalent amounts of each form were added separately to RL before immunoprecipitation of Hsp90 complexes or assembly of PR complexes. The top panel in each set is a Coomassie-stained gel image of total proteins recovered in each sample. Major protein bands, including antibody heavy chains (HC), are identified. The middle panel (35S bound) is an autoradiograph of the stained gel which reveals bound FKBP forms. The bottom panel(35S input) is an autoradiograph of a separate gel that demonstrates the relative level of radiolabeled protein added to each sample. C, same as B except the corresponding FKBP52 mutants replaced the FKBP51 mutants.D, the ability of FKBP52 mutant proteins to enhance GR signaling was measured in a yeast strain that constitutively expresses rat GR and expresses औ-galactosidase in a hormone-inducible manner. The reporter strain was transformed with an empty vector (Vector) or vector constitutively expressing FKBP51 or the indicated FKBP52 form. For each strain the linear rate of increase in औ-galactosidase activity was measured over a 40-min period beginning 70 min after the addition of deoxycorticosterone (25 nmfinal concentration). Reporter activities were normalized to that seen with yeast expressing FKBP51, and the results shown are typical for each of four independent isolates of each strain. Western immunostains confirmed that each FKBP form was present at approximately equivalent levels in total cell extracts (not shown). The results shown are typical measurements from four independent isolates for each strain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Taking advantage of the yeast model for FKBP52-dependent potentiation of GR signaling (18Riggs D.L. Roberts P.J. Chirillo S.C. Cheung-Flynn J. Prapapanich V. Ratajczak T. Gaber R. Picard D. Smith D.F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1158-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), we further tested FKBP52 constructs for function in vivo (Fig. 2D). First, note that FKBP52 significantly enhances hormone-induced औ-galactosidase activity compared with yeast expressing FKBP51 or lacking either FKBP (Vector). None of the FKBP52 mutants displayed potentiation of GR signaling except the C-terminal chimera 397. This is consistent with the dual requirement for Hsp90 binding and FK1 peptidylprolyl isomerase activity for FKBP52 to elevate GR hormone binding affinity (18Riggs D.L. Roberts P.J. Chirillo S.C. Cheung-Flynn J. Prapapanich V. Ratajczak T. Gaber R. Picard D. Smith D.F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1158-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Because 397 retains wild type activity in this assay, it appears that specific sequences in the tail region of FKBP52 are not critical for its function in GR potentiation.Hsp90 Binding by C-terminal Truncation MutantsThe defect in Hsp90 interactions apparent with FKBP51-N404 and FKBP52-N406 was unexpected and raised the question of which sequences downstream from the core TPR domain are minimally required for Hsp90 binding. To begin addressing this question, a series of FKBP truncation mutants was generated which focused on this region, and these were tested for coimmunoprecipitation with Hsp90. Densitometric measurements were taken from gel autoradiographs similar to those in Fig. 2, and these data were plotted as shown in Fig. 3. Significant recovery of FKBP51 mutants in Hsp90 complexes (solid circles) began with constructs that included residues 415–420, near the downstream end of H7. Full Hsp90 binding was only observed with constructs containing sequences beyond 430.Figure 3Binding of FKBP truncation mutants to Hsp90. Truncation mutants of FKBP51 (solid circles) and FKBP52 (open circles) terminating at the indicated amino acid were compared for interactions with Hsp90. Radiolabeled protein products were added to RL before immunoprecipitation of Hsp90 complexes. Binding levels were quantitated by autoradiography of gel-separated samples and plotted relative to full-length FKBP51 (defined as 1007 binding). The diagram above theplot illustrates the corresponding positions for H7 and the C-terminal sequences of FKBP51.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Truncations of FKBP52 (open circles) differed from FKBP51 mutants in two ways. First, note that there is a leftward shift in the Hsp90 binding curve for the FKBP52 series compared with the FKBP51 series. Thus minimally sized FKBP52 truncations that retain measurable levels of Hsp90 binding are 5–8 amino acids shorter than the smallest FKBP51 constructs that retain Hsp90 binding. The second difference pertains to the influence of sequences beyond position 430. Whereas the C-terminal region heightened Hsp90 binding by FKBP51, there appears to be a modest inhibition of Hsp90 binding by the corresponding region of FKBP52. Mutants terminating at approximately position 430 bind Hsp90 equally. However, the inclusion of sequences beyond this point moderated binding of FKBP52 to Hsp90 but enhanced binding by FKBP51.Hsp90 Binding by FKBP51 Chimeras Containing C-terminal Portions of FKBP52In marked contrast to the corresponding FKBP52 chimeras, swapping either the TPR domain (25Barent R.L. Nair S.C. Carr D.C. Ruan Y. Rimerman R.A. Fulton J. Zhang Y. Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 342-354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or the adjacent C-terminal tail (chimera 395 in Fig. 2B) abrogated FKBP51 binding to Hsp90. Swapping both regions together had no effect on Hsp90 binding. These observations suggest important intramolecular interactions between the C-terminal tail region and the TPR domain which are distinctive in FKBP51 and FKBP52. As shown in Fig. 4, additional FKBP51 chimeras focusing on the TPR domain boundary from H5 through H7 were constructed to probe more thoroughly for potential interactions. Comparing hydrophobicity patterns in this region from FKBP51 and FKBP52, the two proteins are similar (Fig. 4A), although there is only 507 amino acid sequence identity. Another series of FKBP51 chimeras was generated in which an exchange occurred at one of eight positions along H6, H7, or just beyond H7 (seven of these sites are indicated in Fig. 4A). Radiolabeled products were synthesized and compared for coimmunoprecipitation with Hsp90 (Fig. 4B). As observed consistently, recovery of wild type FKBP51 in Hsp90 complexes exceeded that of wild type FKBP52 (comparefirst two lanes). Chimeras containing the H6 region and beyond from FKBP52 (365, 374, and 378) retained Hsp90 binding. When the exchange occurred within H7 (395, 404, and 413), there was a complete loss of Hsp90 binding. Hsp90 binding was again observed when the exchange was restricted to sequences beyond 422. To reiterate, we observed no defect in Hsp90 binding by FKBP52 chimeras that contained similar tail regions from FKBP51 (for example, for results with FKBP52 chimera 397, see Fig. 2C). Collectively, these observations suggest that there is an interaction within the region from H6 through H7 extended which is uniquely required by FKBP51 for Hsp90 binding.Figure 4Binding of FKBP chimeric proteins to Hsp90.A, the H5–H7 regions (amino acids 348–421, which is the final resolved residue in the crystal structure) of FKBP51 and FKBP52 are illustrated with coloring to denote hydrophobicity (blue indicates hydrophobic side chains; red, hydrophilic). The FKBP52 structure is modeled on the solved structure for FKBP51. The numbers on FKBP51 indicate six of the eight positions at which C-terminal sequences from FKBP52 were placed to generate chimeric proteins. Downstream chimeras started at 422 and 438.B, FKBP51 chimeras containing the tail sequences from FKBP52 were compared with wild type FKBPs for coimmunoprecipitation with Hsp90. Radiolabeled products were added to RL before immunoprecipitation of Hsp90 complexes. The top panel is an image from a Coomassie-stained gel separation of each immunoprecipitate. The numbers above the lanesindicate the final FKBP51 residues prior to the switch to FKBP52 sequences. The middle panel (bound) is an autoradiograph of the stained gel used to detect bound FKBP forms. Thebottom panel (input) is a separate autoradiograph that demonstrates the relative levels of radiolabeled protein added to each sample. C, the Hsp90 binding data were plotted for FKBP51 chimeras terminating with FKBP52 sequences (solid circles) and for FKBP52 and the FKBP52-397 chimera (open circles). Also plotted are binding data for truncation mutants of the FKBP51-395 chimera (solid triangles). The level of Hsp90 binding to full-length FKBP51 was defined as 1007. Thediagram above the plot illustrates the corresponding positions of H5, H6, and H7 in the FKBP51 crystal structure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)An additional analysis was undertaken in which a series of C-terminal truncation mutants was generated from the defective chimera FKBP51-395. Similar to previous binding assays, truncations of 395 were examined for coimmunoprecipitation with Hsp90 on gel autoradiographs. The quantitated data were plotted in Fig. 4C (solid triangles). Also plotted in this figure are the quantitated data for FKBP51 chimeras (solid circles) that were examined in Fig. 4B and for FKBP52 and the FKBP52-397 chimera (open circles). Consistent with the behavior of FKBP52 truncation mutants (Fig. 3), the FKBP52-397 chimera displayed greater binding than wild type FKBP52 (compare open circles) presumably because of the loss of inhibitory sequences beyond position 430 of FKBP52. As seen from the gel data in Fig. 4B, the FKBP51 chimeras (solid circles) had a pattern of loss then recovery of Hsp90 binding as the fusion point in chimeras progressed from H6 through H7. Interestingly, truncations of FKBP51–395 (triangles) showed that Hsp90 binding could be partially restored in constructs that terminate between 410 and 430. The sharp boundary at ∼410 corresponds well with the Hsp90 binding boundary observed with FKBP52 truncation. Likewise, the trailing boundary near 430 corresponds to the inhibition boundary deduced from FKBP52 truncation mutants.Functional Analysis of FKBP52 Sequences in the 400–420 Region of H7Experimental results with FKBP52 and FKBP51 mutants point to the extended portion of H7 (amino acids 400–420) as being important for Hsp90 binding and FKBP function. This region of FKBP52 was analyzed further, as shown in Fig. 5. Alignment of FKBP sequences in this region highlights the conservation of amino acids 406–415 (Fig. 5A, FKBP52 numbering), a 10-amino acid stretch consisting of a highly charged segment followed by YANMF. A series of FKBP52 truncation mutants that target this region was generated and tested for Hsp90 binding and assembly with PR complexes (Fig. 5B). As seen previously (Fig. 2), binding to Hsp90 and assembly into receptor complexes were greatly reduced with N406, but both interactions were restored when the C terminus was extended to 414 and beyond. Yeast GR reporter strains were generated to correlate protein-protein interactions in vitro with FKBP52 functionin vivo (Fig. 5C). Corresponding with weak Hsp90 and PR interactions, N406 and N410 lacked the ability to potentiate GR signaling; however, potentiation was significantly boosted with N414 and larger mutants in parallel with Hsp90 and PR interaction patterns.Figure 5Minimal FKBP52 sequences required for protein interactions and function.A, FKBP sequences that correspond to the extended portion of H7 are aligned. Arrowsdenote the positions for a series of FKBP52 truncation mutants that terminate in this region. B, FKBP52 wild type (wt) and H7 truncation mutants were compared for coimmunoprecipitation with Hsp90 and assembly with PR complexes. Shown are images from Coomassie Blue-stained gels (top panels), the corresponding autoradiographs (middle panels), and separate autoradiographs of synthesis products (bottom panels). C, the yeast GR reporter strain was separately transformed with empty vector (Vector) or plasmids expressing each form of FKBP52, as indicated. Hormone-induced reporter gene activity was measured in each strain, and results were normalized to the activity observed in the vector strain. The results are typical for multiple independent strain isolates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Sequence data bases were accessed to determine whether other TPR-dependent Hsp90 cochaperones share a motif similar to the 406–415 segment.

Synthetic methodology for carbapenem production has been developed (6Nicolaou K.C. Sorensen E.J. Classics in Total Synthesis: Targets, Strategies, Methods.

Five of the genes, carA–E, are believed to be directly involved in the production of the (5R)-carbapenem nucleus, and it has been shown that it can be produced in Escherichia coli, albeit at lower levels, using only CarA–C (11McGowan S.J.

It has been proposed that glutamate semi-aldehyde, formed by the action of CarD and CarE, condenses with acetyl-CoA in a CarB-catalyzed reaction to give a monocyclic pyrolidine intermediate (5S-carboxymethyl)-S-proline (trans-CMP) (Scheme 1) (2McGowan S.J.

This can then be cyclized in an ATP-driven process catalyzed by CarA, to give a (3S,5S)-carbapenam (14Bycroft B.W. Chhabra S.R. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1989; : 423-425Crossref Google Scholar). This reaction is closely related to β-lactam formation during biosynthesis of the β-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid (15McNaughton H.J. Thirkettle J.E. Zhang Z. Schofield C.J. Jensen S.E.

Hensgens C.M. Pickford M. Adlington R.M. Roach P.L. Baldwin J.E. Nature. 1999; 401: 721-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In this proposed pathway and consistent with the reports of both Bycroft et al. (14Bycroft B.W. Chhabra S.R. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1989; : 423-425Crossref Google Scholar) and Li et al. (12Li R. Stapon A. Blanchfield J.T. Townsend C.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 9296-9297Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar), the role of CarC is to catalyze both epimerization at C-5 and desaturation across the C-2/C-3 bond of the carbapenam. There has been some uncertainty over the absolute stereo-chemistry of the carbapenams involved in carbapenem biosynthesis. Originally, two β-lactams assigned as (3R,5R)- and (3S,5R)-carbapenams were isolated (19Bycroft B.W. Maslen C. Box S.J. Brown A.G. Tyler J.W. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1987; : 1623-1625Crossref Google Scholar). The former was subsequently reassigned as a (3S,5S)-carbapenam following synthesis of a derivative of the enantiomeric (3R,5R)-carbapenam (14Bycroft B.W. Chhabra S.R. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1989; : 423-425Crossref Google Scholar). Tanaka et al. (20Tanaka H. Sakagami H. Ogasawara K. Tetrahedron Lett. 2002; 43: 93-96Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar) have queried this reassignment, but recent synthetic work has substantiated the assignment of the natural carbapenam as (3S,5S) (21Bycroft B.

Although the desaturation process catalyzed by CarC follows the precedent set by the CAS desaturation reaction, its assigned epimerization reaction is unique. To understand the mechanism of the highly unusual CarC reactions, structural information is required. Here we report the in vitro enzyme-mediated production of an active carbapenem antibiotic and describe crystal structures of CarC that define its active site structure thus enabling mechanistic and engineering studies aimed at altering its selectivity. CarC Cloning, Expression, and Purification—A PCR-amplified DNA product corresponding to the E. carotovora carC gene (8McGowan S.J. Sebaihia M. Porter L.E. Stewart G.S.A.B. Williams P. Bycroft B.W.

Cells were grown in shake flasks at 37 °C using 2TY medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin. At A600 0.8, cells were induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and growth allowed to continue for 4 h, CarC expression was ∼20% of the total soluble protein. Cultured cells were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 0.16 mg/ml lysozyme, with 8 μl phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride per gram of cell pellet (50 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride stock made up in 100% isopropanol) and 0.05% polyethyleneimine. Suspended cells were sonicated (HeatSystems), and the lysate was centrifuged (35,000 × g) for 30 min. The resultant supernatant was filtered (0.22-μm, Millipore), then loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose FF column (30 ml) (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C. Elution employed a linear gradient of 150–500 mm NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA. Fractions containing CarC were pooled, concentrated, and applied to an S75-Superdex column equilibrated in 150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA. Fractions containing CarC, judged to be ∼90% pure (by SDS-PAGE), were pooled and concentrated. CarC was exchanged into 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, using a PD-10 gel-filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) and concentrated to 40 mg/ml prior to crystallization (molecular masses measured by negative ion electrospray MS: 31,480 ± 5 Da; calculated mass of CarC without N-terminal Met: 31,479.8 Da). Bioassay—Assay mixtures were transferred into holed (11-mm diameter) bioassay plates (E. coli X580) and incubated at 37 °C overnight. A typical assay mixture consisted of Tris-HCl, pH 9 (10 mm), 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) (10 mm), MgCl2 (2 mm), ATP (3 mm), CMP (3 mm), CarA (2.5 mg/ml), CarC (1.6 mg/ml), and FeSO4 (1 mm). The assay was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. When trans-CMP was used as a substrate an antibiosis zone equivalent to ∼24 nmol/ml cephamycin C was observed. LC/MS—LC/MS was performed using a Waters high-performance liquid chromatography system connected to a Micro-Mass ZMD mass spectrometer in the negative ion mode. Assay mixtures as for the bioassays were mixed with MeOH (equal volume), chilled on ice for 10 min, and then centrifuged (17,800 × g) for 5 min before analysis. Controls were carried out under identical conditions but with deactivated enzymes. The assay mixture (20 μl) was injected onto a Synergi Polar-RP (250 mm × 4.6 mm) column (Phenomenex) equilibrated in water at 1 ml/min. After 15 min a gradient to 90% MeOH was run over 5 min. These conditions were maintained for 5 min before returning to 100% water over 5 min and re-equilibration for 10 min. Quantitative Gel Filtration and Native PAGE Analysis—Molecular weight analysis by gel filtration used an Amersham Biosciences calibration kit and a 24-ml Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column equilibrated with 150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Native-PAGE employed 15% Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gels lacking SDS and run at 50 V for 10 h. The following standards were used (10 mg/ml): ovalbumin (43 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67-kDa monomer, 134-kDa dimer, and 268-kDa tetramer), and catalase (232 kDa). Crystallization—CarC was crystallized using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method. Droplets (2 μl) containing CarC (24 mg/ml), 10 mm 2OG, and 5 mm FeSO4 were mixed with 2 μl of well buffer and equilibrated against 500 μl of the same well buffer. Anaerobic crystallization (<0.5 ppm of O2) under argon was carried out in a Belle Technology glove box. After ∼1 week a mixture of thin needles and microcrystals was obtained from two solutions: (i) 30% i-PrOH, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 0.2 m NH4Ac and (ii) 8% (w/v) PEG 8000, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. Crystals suitable for x-ray diffraction were obtained from 4% (w/v) PEG 8000, 400 mm NH4Ac, 10% (w/v) i-PrOH, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 5 mm FeSO4, and 10 mm dipotassium 2OG. Selenomethionine (SeMet) substituted CarC was produced using a metabolic inhibition protocol and LeMaster media supplemented with 50 μg/ml L-SeMet. Electrospray ionization-MS analysis determined a mean incorporation of 5 selenium atoms per CarC monomer. SeMet CarC was crystallized from 4% (w/v) PEG 8000, 400 mm NH4Ac, 10% (w/v) i-PrOH, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 5 mm FeSO4, and 10 mm dipotassium 2OG. l-N-Acetylproline (l-NAP) was cocrystallized with CarC using a protein solution containing CarC (12 mg/ml), l-NAP (10 mm), FeSO4 (2.5 mm), 2OG (5 mm), i-PrOH (5%), PEG 8000 (2%), NH4Ac (200 mm), and Tris-HCl, pH 8.5 (50 mm). For low temperature data collection, crystals were soaked in well buffer supplemented with 20% (w/v) ethylene glycol and flash-frozen in liquid N2. Data Collection and Phase Determination—Diffraction data for SeMet and l-NAP cocrystallized CarC were collected at 100 K on beamline 14.2 of the Synchrotron Radiation Source, Daresbury, UK with an ADSC Quantum 4 detector. The data were processed using MOSFLM and SCALA of the CCP4 suite (23Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). Density modification and non-crystallographic symmetry averaging were carried out using DM of the CCP4 suite (23Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Structure refinement was performed using REFMAC5 (27Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Lebedev A. Wilson K.S. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar), with inclusion of the iron atoms, 2OG molecules, and 232 water molecules. There were no outliers in the Ramachandran plot (92.5%, 7.3%, 0.2% in the core, allowed, and generously allowed regions, respectively). Molecular replacement using AMoRe (28Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar) was used to phase the data set collected with l-NAP cocrystals, and REFMAC5 was employed for the structure refinement. There was one Ramachandran outlier whose conformation appeared to be supported by the electron density (Leu-108 in subunit B) (92.8%, 7.0%, 0.0%, and 0.2% in the core, allowed, generously allowed, and disallowed regions, respectively). The electron density maps indicated that l-NAP was present in subunits B and C but at a much lower level, if at all, in A. Note that, although the submitted PDB file (1NX8) indicates one orientation (orientation I, see “Results and Discussion”), the orientation of l-NAP within the active site could not be unequivocally inferred from the electron density maps and a second orientation (II) is possible. Molecular Modeling—Hydrogens were added to the complex using the HBUILD routine of CHARMM (version 27) (29Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comput. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (14019) Google Scholar). The final model included the protein atoms, the l-NAP ligand, 2OG, Fe(II), and 39 crystallographic waters, 4119 atoms in total. Models of the structure complexed with (3S,5S)- and (3S,5R)-carbapenams were prepared using QUANTA (30Inc Accelrys QUANTA. Burlington, MA1997Google Scholar). Modeling studies were carried out with both carbapenams, using orientations I and II of l-NAP as initial “templates.” In each case, a full occupancy oxygen atom was added (at a distance of 2.2 Å from Fe(II)) in the ligation position opposite to His-251 (the proposed catalytic cycle involves an Fe(IV)=O intermediate). Without this oxygen, the minimization resulted in the substrate carboxylate ligating to Fe(II). The involvement of such an iron-substrate carboxylate complex in catalysis seems unlikely both with respect to precedent (31Zhang Z. Ren J. Harlos K. McKinnon C.H. Clifton I.J. Schofield C.J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 517: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and on mechanistic grounds but cannot be ruled out. Each of these models contained 4119 atoms. A combined quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (32Warshel A. Levitt M. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 103: 227-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (3695) Google Scholar, 33Field M.J. Bash P.A. Karplus M. J. Comput.

In each case the ligand was described by a QM potential and the rest of the system by a coupled MM potential. The CHARMM standard all-atom parameters (34MacKerell Jr., A.D. Bashford D. Bellott M.

The QM/MM minimizations included the steepest descent method followed by the Adopted Basis Newton-Raphson method implemented in CHARMM, until the average r.m.s. gradient was less than 0.01 kcal mol–1 Å–1. Energies and geometric parameters were obtained from the minimizations to compare the stability of the different models. The procedure was repeated for the (5R)- and (5S)-carbapenems (without the oxygen atom in the empty ligation position opposite to His-251) and for the two carbapenems except with 2OG replaced with succinate. In the latter case the results were almost identical to those obtained with 2OG.Table IIInteratomic distances and relative energy data for QM/MM calculations of the stability of carbapenems modeled into the active site of CarC CHARMM/AM1ModelRelative energyDistanceaAll distances are between hydrogens and heavy atoms.

Open table in a new tab The CarC Reaction—The proposed carbapenam-3-carboxylic acid intermediate was prepared from the appropriate β-amino acid precursor using CarA. 2M. C. Sleeman, unpublished results. The carC and carA genes were cloned from the E. carotovora genomic DNA and expressed in E. coli, and the corresponding proteins were purified by standard techniques. The (5S-carboxymethyl)-S-proline (trans-CMP) putative substrate for CarA was prepared via minor modification of reported methodology (39Kanno O. Shimoji Y. Ohya S. Kawamoto I. J. Antibiot. 2000; 53: 404-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Assays with CarA alone, and combined CarA/CarC assays, containing the appropriate cofactors and potential CarA substrates, were conducted. With the trans-CMP substrate, no antibiotic activity was observed in assays with CarA alone. With trans-CMP in the presence of both CarA and CarC, a clear zone of activity was observed. Liquid chromatography-MS of CarA assay mixtures using trans-CMP led to the observation of a new peak with a mass corresponding to a carbapenam (negative ion electrospray: 154 Da [M-H]–) absent in controls. With trans-CMP in the combined CarA/CarC reactions, peaks were observed for masses corresponding to both a carbapenam and a carbapenem (negative ion electrospray: 152 Da [M-H]–), again absent in controls. Assuming that CarA does not catalyze epimerization, the results imply that CarA can mediate β-lactam ring formation from trans-CMP to give (3S,5S)-carbapenam (Scheme 1, path a). They also suggest that the (3S,5S)-carbapenam can be converted by CarC to the (5R)-carbapenem. Because it cannot be entirely ruled out that the (3S,5S)-CMP used in this study was contaminated with a low level of its (3R,5R) enantiomer, on the basis of our data alone the possibility that the natural substrate for CarC is a (3R,5R) carbapenam cannot be discounted (Scheme 1, path b); however, this would be in conflict with the results and conclusions of both Li et al. (12Li R. Stapon A. Blanchfield J.T. Townsend C.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 9296-9297Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and Bycroft et al. (14Bycroft B.W. Chhabra S.R. J. Chem. Soc. Chem.

The level of substrate conversion effected by CarA with the trans-CMP was low compared with that of β-lactam synthetase (from the clavulanic acid biosynthesis pathway) with its natural substrate, possibly indicating an alternative in vivo substrate (see Scheme 1) or that a multiprotein complex is required to effect full activity (11McGowan S.J.

The organization of β-lactam biosynthesis proteins into a metabolon has also been suggested for clavulanic acid (40Kershaw N.J. McNaughton H.J. Hewitson K.S. Hernández H. Griffin J. Hughes C.

Crystallization and Oligomerization—Crystals of CarC complexed with Fe(II) and 2OG were obtained under anaerobic conditions. Crystals were also obtained anaerobically for CarC together with Fe(II), 2OG, and a substrate analogue (N-acetyl-L-proline) (see below). The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the model of SeMet-substituted CarC complexed with Fe(II). Analysis of crystallographic symmetry revealed that CarC crystallizes as a hexamer comprised of two trimers (ABC and DEF in which A = D, B = E, and C = F) (C2221) (Fig. 1). Each asymmetric unit contains three monomers in a trimeric arrangement, with a hexamer being generated by a 2-fold crystallographic symmetry axis. Gel filtration and native gel electrophoresis studies also indicated that the predominant form of CarC in solution is also hexameric with low levels of monomeric and trimeric forms also being observed (molecular mass by analytical gel filtration: ∼200 kDa). Within each trimer the monomers are arranged such that the active sites are well separated and directed toward the exterior of the hexamer, which possesses a large central channel. Hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions form links between the monomers and link the ABC and DEF trimers to form the hexamer; residues from α5to α6 on th"

KZM1 showed highest similarity to the Arabidopsis K+ channels KAT1 and KAT2, which are localized in guard cells and phloem. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, KZM1 exhibited the characteristic features of an inward-rectifying, potassium-selective channel. In contrast to KAT1- and KAT2-type K+ channels, however, KZM1 currents were insensitive to external pH changes. Northern blot analyses identified the leaf, nodes, and silks as sites ofKZM1 expression. Following the separation of maize leaves into epidermal, mesophyll, and vascular fractions, quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR allowed us to localizeKZM1 transcripts predominantly in vascular strands and the epidermis. Cell tissue separation and KZM1 localization were followed with marker genes such as the bundle sheath-specific ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase, the phloem K+channel ZMK2, and the putative sucrose transporterZmSUT1. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, ZmSUT1 mediated proton-coupled sucrose symport. Coexpression of ZmSUT1 with the phloem K+ channels KZM1 and ZMK2 revealed that ZMK2 is able to stabilize the membrane potential during phloem loading/unloading processes and KZM1 to mediate K+ uptake. During leaf development, sink-source transitions, and diurnal changes,KZM1 is constitutively expressed, pointing to a housekeeping function of this channel in K+ homeostasis of the maize leaf. Therefore, the voltage-dependent K+-uptake channel KZM1 seems to mediate K+retrieval and K+ loading into the phloem as well as K+-dependent stomatal opening.

Therefore, new insights into the physiological role of the different K+channel genes have been gained. The Arabidopsis thalianagenome contains at least 15 K+ channel genes (1Mäser P. Thomine S.

According to their localization, structure, and function, these genes can be assigned to different subfamilies. In 1992, the first plant K+ channel genes isolated were AKT1 andKAT1 (3Anderson J.A.

Recently, the inward rectifier KAT2 could be characterized as the closest relative to KAT1 (13Pilot G. Lacombe B. Gaymard F. Cherel I. Boucherez J. Thibaud J.B. Sentenac H. J. Biol.

KAT2 is expressed in guard cells, too, but in contrast to KAT1,KAT2 transcripts were identified in the phloem parenchyma of the leaf. A coding sequence of the channel gene AKT5 (AKT1 subfamily) could be isolated from hypocotyl tissue, 1S. Scheuermann, unpublished results. but its function still remains unknown. The AtKC1 gene splits into another subfamily and together with AKT1 subunits seems to generate the functional properties of the root hair K+-influx channel (14Ivashikina N. Becker D. Ache P.

In contrast to the mentioned inward rectifiers within the AKT1 and KAT1 family, members of the AKT2/3 subfamily are characterized by weak voltage dependence, a Ca2+ and H+block, and seem to control phloem function (16Deeken R.

Because the Arabidopsis genome reveals the complete set ofShaker-like K+ channel genes in plants, we can assign the orthologs from different plant species to the respective subfamilies. So far K+ channel genes have been isolated from 12 different plants (compare with Ref. 22Pratelli R. Lacombe B. Torregrosa L. Gaymard F. Romieu C. Thibaud J.B. Sentenac H. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 564-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) including the C4 plant Zea mays. In maize, the two K+ channel genes ZMK1 and ZMK2, isolated from the coleoptile, belong to the AKT1- and AKT2/3-type subfamilies, respectively (23Philippar K. Fuchs I. Lüthen H. Hoth S. Bauer C. Haga K. Thiel G. Ljung K. Sandberg G. Böttger M. Becker D. Hedrich R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12186-12191Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). ZMK1 is involved in auxin-induced K+ uptake, coleoptile growth, and tropisms. ZMK2 displays the voltage-independent features of the AKT2/3-type K+ channels and thus seems to serve phloem-associated functions (24Bauer C.S. Hoth S. Haga K. Philippar K. Aoki N. Hedrich R. Plant J. 2000; 24: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Besides rice, the maize plant is not only a model system for monocotyledonous crops but C4 photosynthesis as well. This involves a special anatomic feature called Kranz anatomy: mesophyll cells, involved in the pre-fixation of CO2, transport C4 compounds to the bundle sheath cells, which surround the vascular strands and finally fix CO2 in the Calvin cycle (reviewed in Ref. 25Nelson T. Langdale J.A. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant. Mol. Biol. 1992; 43: 25-47Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Due to this cell and chloroplast dimorphism, C4 plants are characterized by a better water-use efficiency than C3 plants. The carbohydrate transport between mesophyll, bundle sheath, and vascular parenchyma cells of the maize leaf is accomplished by numerous plasmodesmata (26Botha C.E.J. Cross R.H.M. Van Bel A.J.E. Peter C.I. Protoplasma. 2000; 214: 65-72Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 27Russin W.A. Evert R.F. Vanderveer P.J. Sharkey T.D. Briggs S.P. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 645-658Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Stitt M. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 565-571Crossref Google Scholar). The loading of sucrose from the vascular parenchyma to the thin-walled sieve tubes, representing the site of assimilate export, however, is thought to involve an apoplastic step (reviewed in Refs. 29Prioul J.L. Zamski E. Schaffer A.A. Photoassimilate Distribution in Plants and Crops, Source-Sink Relationships. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1996: 549-594Google Scholarand 30Van Bel A.J.E. Annu. Rev.

Ohsugi R. Plant Cell Physiol. 1999; 40: 1072-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) isolated ZmSUT1, a putative sucrose transporter from source leaves of maize. By heterologous expression inXenopus oocytes, we showed that ZmSUT1 indeed represents a sucrose/H+ symporter under the voltage control of the AKT2/3 ortholog ZMK2. Because the AKT2/3-type channels such as AKT2/3 fromArabidopsis, VFK1 from Vicia faba, and ZMK2 fromZ. mays seem to play an important role in the control of phloem sucrose loading and unloading (16Deeken R. Sanders C. Ache P. Hedrich R. Plant J. 2000; 23: 285-290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Deeken R. Geiger D. Fromm J. Koroleva O. Ache P. Langenfeld-Heyser R. Sauer N. Bennett M. Hedrich R.

Plant J. 2001; 27: 571-580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we here studied K+ channels expressed in the dimorphic structure of the maize leaf. In addition to ZMK2 (23Philippar K. Fuchs I. Lüthen H. Hoth S. Bauer C. Haga K. Thiel G. Ljung K. Sandberg G. Böttger M. Becker D. Hedrich R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12186-12191Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), we isolated the cDNA ofKZM1. KZM1 represents the maize ortholog toKAT2 from Arabidopsis. LikeKAT2 we found this new maize K+ channel gene expressed in vascular/bundle sheath strands as well as guard cell- and subsidiary cell-enriched epidermal fractions of the maize leaf. However, KZM1 is characterized by unique functional properties that enabled us to discriminate between the function of KAT2 in the dicotyledonous plant Arabidopsis and KZM1 in the monocotyledonous C4 plant maize. The K+-uptake channel KZM1 is able to mediate phloem K+ loading and retrieval as well as K+-dependent stomatal movement. The function of the inward-rectifier KZM1 in combination with ZMK2 and the sucrose/H+ symporter ZmSUT1 as well as its expression pattern point to a housekeeping function of KZM1 for K+homeostasis in the phloem of the maize leaf. Cloning, Northern blot procedures, and quantitative real-time RT2-PCR analysis were performed on tissues isolated from maize plants (Z. mays L., hybrid corn cv. “Oural FA0230,” Deutsche Saatveredelung, Lippstadt, Germany). Seeds were sown in soil and grown in a greenhouse with a 16-h light (25 °C) and 8-h dark (18 °C) cycle. The white light used had a photon-flux density of 210 ॖmol·m−2·s−1 (LiCOR Quantum Sensor LI-250, Walz GmbH, Effeltrich, Germany). After harvesting, all maize tissues were stored in liquid nitrogen prior to RNA extraction. The age of plants or organs is denoted in days after sowing. Degenerated oligonucleotide primers, directed toward homologous regions of known plant inward-rectifying K+ channels, were used to amplify a corresponding region of potassium channels from reverse-transcribed maize leaf RNA (RT-PCR). By using the SMART RACE cDNA Amplification kit (Clontech, Heidelberg, Germany) in combination with gene-specific primers, we amplified overlapping N- and C-terminal K+ channel fragments according to the RACE technique. The corresponding full-length cDNA was generated in a single PCR step using primers flanking the 5′- and 3′-ends of the coding sequence of KZM1 and ligated into pCRII-TOPO TA vector (Invitrogen). Besides the N- and C-terminal clones ofKZM1, three identical full-length clones of the channel cDNA were sequenced using the LiCOR 4200 sequencer (LiCOR, Bad Homburg, Germany). Total RNA was isolated from the respective maize organs using the Plant RNeasy Extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Poly(A)+ RNA was purified from total RNA using Dynabeads (Dynal, Hamburg, Germany) and subjected to Northern blot analysis as described (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The blotted poly(A)+ RNA was hybridized against 32P-radiolabeled full-length cDNA probes of the K+ channel genes KZM1 andZMK2 as described in Philippar et al. (23Philippar K. Fuchs I. Lüthen H. Hoth S. Bauer C. Haga K. Thiel G. Ljung K. Sandberg G. Böttger M. Becker D. Hedrich R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12186-12191Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). For the sucrose transporter ZmSUT1, a 339-bp-long 3′-terminal cDNA fragment, amplified between the primers ZmSUT LCfw (5′-cccacaaaggcaaac-3′) and ZmSUT LCrev (5′-tggtgtgggtgacg-3′), served as a probe. Each probe exhibited specific signals at 2.5 kb forKZM1, 2.8 kb for ZMK2, and 2.0 kb forZmSUT1. To standardize transcript abundance, 15 ng of dotted poly(A)+ was hybridized against a [γ-32P]dATP end-labeled oligo(dT) probe as described (23Philippar K. Fuchs I. Lüthen H. Hoth S. Bauer C.

Tissue from the last fully developed leaf of 5-week-old maize plants was separated into epidermis, mesophyll cells, and vascular strands by a procedure modified according to Keunecke and Hansen (34Keunecke M. Hansen U.P. Planta. 2000; 210: 792-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The central vascular strand was excised, and the lower epidermis was collected in 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm Mes/KOH, pH 6.5, adjusted with mannitol to 530 mosmol kg−1, and frozen in liquid nitrogen for mRNA extraction. To test the vitality of epidermal cells before freezing, an aliquot of the epidermal fraction was stained with neutral red (see Fig. 4). To isolate mesophyll protoplasts, the remaining leaf sections were incubated for 90 min at 30 °C in enzyme solution containing 1.57 cellulase (Cellulase R-10, Yakult Honsha Co., Tokyo, Japan), 27 pektinase (Sigma), 10 mm KCl, 10 mm Mes/KOH, pH 6.2, adjusted withd-sorbitol to 480 mosmol kg−1. The digestion was stopped before the bundle sheath cells were released from the vascular strands. Isolated vascular/bundle sheath strands were pooled and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Mesophyll protoplasts were sedimented at 60 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and frozen in liquid nitrogen. For real-time RT-PCR experiments, total RNA from the fractionated maize leaves was isolated using the Plant RNeasy Extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). To minimize DNA contaminations, mRNA was purified twice with the Dynabeads mRNA Direct kit (Dynal, Hamburg, Germany), or total RNA was subjected to digestion with RNase-free DNase and purified by phenol/chloroform extraction (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Mesophyll protoplast mRNA was directly purified with the Dynabeads mRNA Direct kit (Dynal). First-strand cDNA synthesis and quantitative real-time RT-PCR were performed as described before (12Szyroki A. Ivashikina N. Dietrich P. Roelfsema M.R.G. Ache P. Reintanz B. Deeken R. Godde M.

The following K+ channel-specific primers were used: KZM1 LCfw (5′-aagaagcatggttgttac-3′), KZM1 LCrev (5′-tgaaaccaaagaagtctc-3′), ZMK2 LCfw (5′-gacggctcaggttcag-3′), and ZMK2 LCrev (5′-gagaaggcgttgatcg-3′). For detection of the coding sequence of the small subunit of the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (ZmRuBPCsu, GenBankTM accession number X06535) and the 3′-untranslated region of the C4 form phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (ZmC4-PEPC, GenBankTM accession number X15238), we used the primer pairs RuBPCssu LCfw (5′-caacaagaagttcgagacg-3′), RuBPCssu LCrev (5′-cgggtaggatttgatggc-3′), and C4-PEPC LCfw (5′-ggcttctcttcactcacc-3′), C4-PEPC LCrev (5′-tccaatgggctgggata-3′), respectively. All quantifications were normalized to the signal of actin cDNA fragments generated by the primers ZmAct 81/83fw (5′-acacagtgccaatct-3′) and ZmAct 81/83rev (5′-actgagcacaatgttac-3′), which amplified cDNA from the maize actins ZmAct 81 (GenBankTM accession number AAB40106) and ZmAct 83 (GenBankTM accession number AAB40105). The relative amount of channel cDNA was calculated from the correlation 2(nactin −nchannel) with n = threshold cycle of the respective PCR product. To identify contaminating genomic DNA, the primers for ZMK2 were selected to flank an intron. For heterologous expression in Xenopus laevisoocytes, the cDNAs of KZM1 in pCRII andZmSUT1 in pBS SK(−) were subcloned asXhoI/SpeI and BamHI/XhoI fragments, respectively, into the pGEMHE vector (35Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). Expression ofZMK2 in oocytes was performed as described (23Philippar K. Fuchs I. Lüthen H.

The respective cRNA was generated by in vitro transcription (T7-Megascript kit, Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) and injected intoXenopus oocytes (CRBM, CNRS, Montpellier, France) using a PicospritzerII microinjector (General Valve, Fairfield, NJ). Two to 6 days following injection, double-electrode voltage clamp recordings were performed with a Turbotec-01C amplifier (NPI Instruments, Tamm, Germany). The electrodes were filled with 3 m KCl and had typical input resistance of about 2–4 megaohm. Solutions were composed of 30 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 10 mmTris/Mes, pH 7.5, 10 mm Mes/Tris, pH 5.6, and 10 mm citrate/Tris, pH 4.5, respectively. Acidification of the cytosolic pH was accomplished by perfusion with 30 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2and 10 mm Mes/Tris, pH 5.6, as well as 10 mmNaAc. The control solution contained 10 mm NaCl instead of NaAc. When recording KZM1-mediated currents at 100, 30, 10, and 3 mm external K+ concentrations, the ionic strength was adjusted with Na+. In K+-free solutions, K+ was substituted with Na+ or Li+ as indicated. All media were adjusted to a final osmolality of 215–235 mosmol kg−1 withd-sorbitol. Analyses of voltage and pH dependence were performed as described previously (19Marten I. Hoth S. Deeken R. Ache P. Ketchum K.A. Hoshi T. Hedrich R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Membrane potential measurements with ZmSUT1-expressing oocytes and coexpression of ZmSUT1 with KZM1 and ZMK2 were performed as described for AtSUC2, KAT2, and AKT2/3 in Deeken et al. (17Deeken R.

For patch clamp experiments, devitellinized oocytes were placed in a bath solution containing 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm Tris/Mes, pH 7.5. Pipettes were filled with solution containing 100 mmKCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mmCaCl2, and 10 mm Tris/Mes, pH 7.5. Currents were recorded in the cell-attached configuration using an EPC-9 amplifier (HEKA, Lambrecht, Germany) as described previously (37Hedrich R. Moran O. Conti F. Busch H. Becker D. Gambale F.

To study the role of K+ channels in C4 leaves, characterized by Kranz anatomy, we isolatedKZM1 from maize leaf cDNA via RT-PCR and RACE techniques. The cloning strategy took advantage of highly conserved regions in the Shaker gene family of plant K+channels (for review see Ref. 2Very A.A. Sentenac H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 7: 168-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of the open reading frame of the KZM1 cDNA (2274 bp) revealed the basic features of the KAT1 subfamily (Fig.1A) as follows: six putative transmembrane domains (S1–S6) with a proposed voltage sensor in segment 4 and a K+-selective pore (P), formed by the amphiphilic linker between S5 and S6 (for structure-function analysis of plant K+ channels see Refs. 38Hoth S.

The proposed cytoplasmic C terminus of KZM1 contains a region, which shares structural homologies to cyclic nucleotide binding domains (Fig. 1A). In contrast to ZMK2 (five ankyrin repeats), the sequence of KZM1 did not contain an ankyrin binding domain (Fig. 1A), a feature that is conserved among K+ channels of the KAT1 subfamily (1Mäser P.

In the 5′-region of the open reading frame of KZM1, we could identify two possible translational start positions (“ATG”), a structural element also found with the Arabidopsis orthologKAT2 (Fig. 1A). In addition, plant-specific hydrophobic and acidic C-terminal domains, involved in plant K+ channel clustering (40Ehrhardt T. Zimmermann S. Müller-Röber B.

Based on Southern blot analysis with maize DNA, we characterizedKZM1 as a single copy gene within the maize genome (not shown). Besides KZM1 we could also identifyKZM2, 3K. Büchsenschütz, unpublished results. the second maize member of the KAT1 subfamily (Fig. 1B), most likely representing the ortholog to KAT1 fromArabidopsis. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, the gene product of KZM1 showed the characteristic properties of a voltage-dependent, inward-rectifying plant K+channel (Fig. 2). In two-electrode voltage clamp experiments, KZM1 activated upon hyperpolarization to membrane potentials negative to −60 mV (Fig. 2A). The steady-state current-voltage curve of the data shown in Fig.2A underlines the strong inward rectification of KZM1 (Fig.2B). From activation curve analyses, a half-maximal activation voltage U12 of −105.4 ± 6.9 mV (n = 5) was calculated. Recordings in the cell-attached patch clamp configuration allowed us to resolve single KZM1 channel-fluctuations (Fig. 2C). The channel amplitude and time-dependent activity increased with increasing negative voltages. From the current-voltage relationship of the single channels (Fig. 2D), a unitary conductance of 20 ± 0.7 pS (n = 3, mean ± S.E. with 100 mmK+ in the pipette) was deduced. Thus, KZM1 exhibits a 2–4-fold higher conductance than the previously characterized K+ channels of the KAT1 subfamily (6.7 pS for KAT2 (13Pilot G. Lacombe B. Gaymard F. Cherel I. Boucherez J.

In agreement with a K+-selective channel, K+currents through KZM1 increased as a function of the external K+ concentration (not shown) with the current reversal potential following the Nernst potential for potassium (60.8 ± 4.7 mV per 10-fold change in external K+ concentration, Fig. 3A). Replacing K+ by Rb+ (100 mm) caused a drop in the inward current (at −150 mV, IRb+/IK+ = 0.190 ± 0.041,n = 4). Comparison of the reversal potential in either K+ or Rb+ solutions allowed us to determine the permeability ratioPRb/PK = 0.437 ± 0.085, n = 4. In contrast to other KAT1-like channels, the permeability ratios for Na+ and Li+ ions could not be determined, because KZM1 did not even conduct outward currents in N"
https://openalex.org/W2084750055,"RING finger proteins have been implicated in many fundamental cellular processes, including the control of gene expression. A key regulator of light-dependent development in Arabidopsis thaliana is the constitutive photomorphogenesis protein 1 (atCOP1), a RING finger protein that plays an essential role in translating light/dark signals into specific changes in gene transcription. atCOP1 binds the basic leucine zipper factor HY5 and suppresses its transcriptional activity through a yet undefined mechanism that results in HY5 degradation in response to darkness. Furthermore, the pleiotropic phenotype of atCOP1 mutants indicates that atCOP1 may be a central regulator of several transcriptional pathways. Here we report the cloning and characterization of the human orthologue of atCOP1. Human COP1 (huCOP1) distributes both to the cytoplasm and the nucleus of cells and shows a striking degree of sequence conservation with atCOP1, suggesting the possibility of a functional conservation as well. In co-immunoprecipitation assays huCOP1 specifically binds basic leucine zipper factors of the Jun family. As a functional consequence of this interaction, expression of huCOP1 in mammalian cells down-regulates c-Jun-dependent transcription and the expression of the AP-1 target genes, urokinase and matrix metalloproteinase 1. The RING domain of huCOP1 displays ubiquitin ligase activity in an autoubiquitination assay in vitro; however, suppression of AP-1-dependent transcription by huCOP1 occurs in the absence of changes in c-Jun protein levels, suggesting that this inhibitory effect is independent of c-Jun degradation. Our findings indicate that huCOP1 is a novel regulator of AP-1-dependent transcription sharing the important properties of Arabidopsis COP1 in the control of gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1980095186,"Regulation of osteoclastogenesis by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is mediated via its interactions with toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) on both osteoclast- and osteoblast-lineage cells. We have recently demonstrated that CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODNs), known to mimic bacterial DNA, modulate osteoclastogenesis via interactions with osteoclast precursors. In the present study we characterize the interactions of CpG ODNs with osteoblasts, in comparison with LPS. We find that, similar to LPS, CpG ODNs modulate osteoclastogenesis in bone marrow cell/osteoblast co-cultures, although in a somewhat different pattern. Osteoblasts express receptors for both LPS and CpG ODN (TLR4 and TLR9, respectively). The osteoblastic TLR9 transmits signals into the cell as demonstrated by NFκB activation as well as by extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 phosphorylation. Similar to LPS, CpG ODN increases in osteoblasts the expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF). The two TLR ligands do not affect osteoprotegerin expression in osteoblasts. CpG ODN does not significantly affect receptor activator of NFκB ligand (RANKL) expression, in contrast to LPS, which induces the expression of this molecule. In the co-cultures CpG ODN induces RANKL expression in osteoblasts as a result of the more efficient TNF-α induction. CpG ODN activity (modulation of osteoclastogenesis, gene expression, ERK and p38 phosphorylation, and nuclear translocation of NFκB) is specific, because the control oligodeoxynucleotide, not containing CpG, is inactive. Furthermore, these effects (unlike the LPS effects) are inhibited by chloroquine, suggesting a requirement for endosomal maturation/acidification, the classic CpG ODN mode of action. We conclude that CpG ODN, upon TLR9 ligation, induces osteoblasts osteoclastogenic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1999585883,"Active caspase-9 and caspase-3 have been observed in the mitochondria, but their origins are unclear. Theoretically, procaspase-9 might be activated in the mitochondria in a cytochromec/Apaf-1-dependent manner, or activated caspase-9 and -3 may translocate to the mitochondria, or the mitochondrially localized procaspases may be activated by the translocated active caspases. Here we present evidence that the mitochondrially localized active caspase-9 and -3 result mostly from translocation from the cytosol (into the intermembrane space) and partly from caspase-mediated activation in the organelle rather than from the Apaf-1-mediated activation. Apaf-1 localizes exclusively in the cytosol and, upon apoptotic stimulation, translocates to the perinuclear area but not to the mitochondria. In most cases, the mitochondrially localized procaspase-9 and -3 are released early during apoptosis and translocate to the cytosol and/or perinuclear area. Cytochrome c and the mitochondrial matrix protein Hsp60 are also rapidly released to the cytosol early during apoptosis. Both the early release of proteins like cytochrome c and Hsp60 from the mitochondria as well as the later translocation of the active caspase-9/-3 are partially inhibited by cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of mitochondrial membrane permeabilization. The mitochondrial active caspases may function as a positive feedback mechanism to further activate other or residual mitochondrial procaspases, degrade mitochondrial constituents, and disintegrate mitochondrial functions.

Cancer Res. 1999; 59: S1701-S1706PubMed Google Scholar). The family of caspases (cysteine aspartic acid-specificprotease) is the key effector in the execution of apoptotic cell death (2Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar). Caspases are synthesized as inactive proenzymes, which become proteolytically cleaved during apoptosis to generate active enzymes. The active caspases cleave cellular proteins such as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)1 to dismantle the apoptotic cells (3Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6133) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism(s) whereby various caspases become activated are still unclear. Two pathways leading to caspase activation are relatively better understood. In the first pathway, apoptotic stimuli cause the release of cytochrome c (cyt. c) from the intermembrane space (IMS) of the mitochondria to the cytosol. The released cyt. c binds to and activates the adaptor protein Apaf-1, which in turn activates the initiator procaspase-9 in the presence of ATP, leading to the formation of apoptosome and subsequent activation of “executioner” caspases such as caspase-3, -6, or -7 (4Wang X. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2922-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In the second pathway, the FADD/TRADD adaptor proteins recruit the initiator procaspase-8 (or -10) to cell surface death receptors, leading to death receptor-induced signaling complex formation, caspase-8 activation, and, subsequently, activation of executioner caspases (5Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5112) Google Scholar).

Active caspases have also been found in different subcellular compartments. For example, in response to tumor necrosis factor-α, procaspase-1 translocates to the nucleus where it is proteolytically activated (22Nakagawara A. Nakamura Y. Ikeda H. Hiwasa T. Kuida K. Su M.S.

In some experimental systems, the mitochondrially localized procaspase-2 and -3, upon activation, translocate to the nucleus (14Zhivotovsky B. Samali A. Gahm A. Orrenius S.

In all these apoptotic systems, it is generally thought that procaspases “stored” in various subcellular compartments are released, upon apoptosis induction, and become activated in the cytosol or that the cytosolically activated caspases translocate to various organelles to participate in apoptosis. It is still unclear whether the procaspases localized in the organelles (e.g. mitochondria) canever be activated in situ. A pertinent philosophical question is why these procaspases have to be “imported” into these organelles if they can only be activated in the cytosol?Recently, we have found that apoptosis induced by many stimuli involves an early mitochondrial activation, which is characterized by up-regulation of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) proteins and many other mitochondrially localized non-MRC proteins (30Chandra D. Liu J.-W. Tang D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50842-50854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). A cardinal feature of this mitochondrial activation-dependent apoptotic pathway (or MADAP) is the early up-regulation and enrichment of cyt. c in the mitochondria, which precede its release. Because procaspase-9 is present in the IMS of the mitochondria (14Zhivotovsky B. Samali A. Gahm A. Orrenius S. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 644-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 17Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Brenner C. Larochette N. Prevost M.C. Alzari P.M. Kroemer G. J. Exp.

Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5752-5757Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the increased mitochondrial cyt. c might lead to the activation of procaspase-9 and, subsequently, of procaspase-3 inside the organelle. In this study, we utilized our MADAP model to test this hypothesis. Our results show no evidence of cyt. c/Apaf-1-mediated procaspase-9 activation inside the mitochondria. Instead, the results suggest that the mitochondrial active caspase-9 and -3 result mostly from the translocation from the cytosol and partly from caspase-mediated activation in the mitochondria.DISCUSSIONThe current study focuses on the mitochondria-associated active caspase-9 and caspase-3. The multifaceted results allow us to present a model (Fig. 9) to explain their location, origin, relationship with the cytosolic counterparts, and potential biological functions. In response to apoptotic stimulation, several mitochondrial proteins such as the IMS protein cyt. c and the matrix protein Hsp60 are released, involving CsA-sensitive MMP. In certain apoptotic systems, the mitochondrial procaspases are similarly released into the cytosol, some of which translocate to the perinuclear area. In a similar fashion, Apaf-1, which is located exclusively in the cytosol, also translocates to the perinuclear region (Fig. 9). The released cyt. c triggers apoptosome formation in the cytosol leading to caspase-9 and, subsequently, caspase-3 activation. The activated caspase-9 and -3 rapidly translocate back to the mitochondria where they may further activate residual or other resident procaspases in the organelle, degrade mitochondrial proteins, disintegrate mitochondria, and help drive the apoptotic process to completion.Active Caspases in the Mitochondria: Unlikely Involvement of Apaf-1 in the Activation of Procaspase-9 in the OrganelleA multitude of studies have demonstrated the presence of pro- and activated caspases in the mitochondria (14Zhivotovsky B.

Schotte P. Beyaert R. Declercq W. Vandenabeele P. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 1207-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The reason for this discrepancy remains unclear, but the negative results may likely result from cell type-specific variations, different antibodies used, insufficient protein loading, and utilization of digitonin-permeabilized mitochondria (51van Loo G. Saelens X. Matthijssens F. Schotte P. Beyaert R. Declercq W. Vandenabeele P. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 1207-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Our well controlled experiments using mitochondria prepared by either Percoll gradient purification (Fig. 2) or differential centrifugation (the rest) demonstrate the presence of procaspases in unstimulated mitochondria and, more importantly, of activated caspases in apoptosis-stimulated mitochondria. Like their procaspase counterparts, the activated caspase-9 and -3 are localized in the IMS of the mitochondria (Fig.5).Our recent observation (30Chandra D. Liu J.-W. Tang D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50842-50854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) that a wide diversity of apoptotic inducers cause an early up-regulation and accumulation of cyt. c in the mitochondria raises the following intriguing question. Could this increased mitochondrial cyt. c lead to procaspase-9 activation right in the organelle analogous to apoptosome-mediated procaspase-9 activation in the cytosol? Several pieces of evidence make our initial hypothesis unlikely. First, in all our apoptotic models the initial appearance of the activated caspase-9 in the mitochondria occurs either following or concomitant with the caspase-9 activation in the cytosol without proteolytic degradation of the mitochondrial procaspase-9 (Fig.3). These observations suggest that caspase-9 activation is initiated in the cytosol. Second, Apaf-1, the key adaptor molecule in apoptosome-mediated caspase-9 activation, is exclusively expressed in the cytosol, consistent with the observations of other investigators (46Hausmann G. O'Reilly L.A. van Driel R. Beaumont J.G. Strasser A. Adams J.M. Huang D.C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 623-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and is never found in the mitochondria. Third, even after apoptotic stimulation, no association of Apaf-1 with the mitochondrial fractions is observed (Fig. 3, A–D). Finally, cell-free reconstitution experiments demonstrate that cyt. c does not directly activate the mitochondrial procaspase-9 although it completely activates the cytosolic procaspase-9 (Fig. 7A), thus confirming the lack of Apaf-1 in the mitochondria. These observations make it clear that procaspase-9 cannot be activated inside the mitochondria in an Apaf-1/apoptosome-dependent manner.Interestingly, in all the apoptotic models studied here, cytosolic Apaf-1 rapidly translocates to the perinuclear area, similar to recent findings (52Ruiz-Vela A. Gonzalez G. de Buitrago G. Martinez-A C. FEBS Lett. 2002; 517: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) in different mammalian cells. Remarkably, the Apaf-1 homologue in Caenorhabditis elegans, CED-4, also translocates to the nuclear membrane during apoptosis (53Chen F. Hersh B.M. Conradt B. Zhou Z. Riemer D. Gruenbaum Y. Horvitz H.R. Science. 2000; 287: 1485-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). What could be the functions of this translocation? One clue is that, in addition to Apaf-1, cyt. c (52Ruiz-Vela A. Gonzalez G. de Buitrago G. Martinez-A C. FEBS Lett. 2002; 517: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), procaspase-9 and -3 (this study), and many other caspases (22Nakagawara A. Nakamura Y. Ikeda H. Hiwasa T. Kuida K. Su M.S.

It is possible that these molecules move together to assemble functional apoptosomes to induce caspase activation in or around the nucleus in order to disassemble the nuclear cytoplasmic barrier (54Faleiro L. Lazebnik Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and catalyze the systematic degradation of the nucleus.Active Caspases in the Mitochondria Are Derived Mostly from the TranslocationIf the Apaf-1-containing apoptosome is not involved, then how is the mitochondrial active caspase-9 brought about? Although Apaf-1-independent mechanisms recently emerged (11Marsden V.S. O'Connor L. O'Reilly L. Silke J. Metcalf D. Ekert P.G. Huang D.C.S. Cecconi F. Kuida K. Tomaselli K.J. Roy S. Nicholson D.W.

Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34287-34294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar) could be involved, the most plausible explanation is that the active caspase-9 in the mitochondria comes from translocation from the cytosol. Supporting evidence comes from PC3 or GM701 cells treated with BMD188 in which increasing levels of the activated caspase-9 are seen in the mitochondria in the absence of corresponding decreases in the mitochondrial procaspase-9 levels (Fig. 3, A andB). Instead, the cytosolic procaspase-9 continuously decreases without a corresponding increase in the active caspase-9 (Fig. 3, A and B). More importantly, in PC3 cells the cytosolic caspase-9 activation occurs prior to the mitochondrial caspase-9 activation (Fig. 3A). Cell-free reconstitution experiments also provide clear-cut evidence that the cytosolically activated caspase-9 can translocate to the mitochondria. Translocation seems to be a temperature- and energy-dependent process; translocation is decreased at room temperature and stopped at 4 °C. 2D. Chandra and D. G. Tang, unpublished observations. The mitochondria-associated active caspase-3 generally appears at the same time when the cytosolic caspase-3 becomes activated (Fig. 3,A–D), but at least in some cases, an early translocation of the activated cytosolic caspase-3 to the mitochondria can be suggested. For example, in BMD188-treated PC3 cells, the mitochondrial caspase-3 activation is observed at 45 min post-treatment (Figs. 1, 2, and3A). However, the active mitochondrial caspase-9 is not observed by this time (Fig. 3A), suggesting that the active caspase-3 in the mitochondria probably comes from translocation from the cytosol. In addition, increasing amounts of both active caspase-3 (i.e. the p20 fragment) as well as the procaspase-3 are observed in the mitochondria (Fig. 3A). Finally, cell-free reconstitution experiments show that the cytosolically activated caspase-3 can indeed translocate to the mitochondria (Fig. 7).How may activated caspases translocate to the IMS of the mitochondria? It is still unclear how various procaspases, which generally lack an identifiable mitochondria-targeting sequence (51van Loo G. Saelens X. Matthijssens F. Schotte P. Beyaert R. Declercq W. Vandenabeele P. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 1207-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), get into the IMS. Evidence presented here suggests that a CsA-inhibitable mechanism(s) seems to be responsible, at least partially, for both the early release of the mitochondrial proteins such as cyt. c and Hsp60 as well as for the later translocation of the activated caspases back to the mitochondria. CsA, which has been shown to inhibit apoptosis in multiple model systems, is generally thought to block apoptosis by inhibiting MMP (48van Loo G. Saelens X. van Gurp M. MacFarlane M. Martin S.J. Vandennabeele P. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 1031-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 49Jemmerson R. LaPlante B. Treeful A. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 538-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). CsA has been shown recently (55Scorrano L. Ashiya M. Buttle K. Weiler S. Oakes S.A. Mannella C.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 55-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar) to also inhibit the remodeling of the mitochondrial cristae and consequently inhibit cyt. c release. How mitochondrial proteins are released from the mitochondria is still controversial, but it seems to involve different types of channels consisting of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins such as Bax and Bak and some resident mitochondrial proteins such as VDAC (reviewed in Refs. 48van Loo G. Saelens X. van Gurp M. MacFarlane M. Martin S.J. Vandennabeele P. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 1031-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar and 49Jemmerson R. LaPlante B. Treeful A. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 538-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Consistent with our earlier data (30Chandra D. Liu J.-W. Tang D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50842-50854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), CsA inhibits the early release of both cyt. c and Hsp60 (Fig. 6), thus suggesting the potential involvement of MMP in this process. Interestingly, CsA also appears to inhibit the later translocation of active caspases as it specifically reduces their levels in the mitochondria (Fig. 6). These results suggest that translocation of the activated caspases back to the mitochondria might use a CsA-sensitive mechanism(s) similar to those utilized for the initial mitochondrial protein release. It is unclear how the activated cytosolic caspase-9, most of which is thought to remain bound to the apoptosome (38Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandez-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol.

The supramolecular openings formed by Bid, Bax, and the mitochondrial membrane lipids can release molecules of 2,000 kDa (56Kuwana T. Mackey M.R. Perkins G. Ellisman M.H. Latterich M. Schneiter R. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Cell. 2002; 111: 331-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar), which should be sufficient to “entertain” the 700-kDa to 1.4-MDa apoptosome. However, Apaf-1 is never detected in the mitochondria. It is possible that some activated caspase-9, especially those activated by caspase-3, may not be apoptosome-bound and thus be free to translocate to the mitochondria.Recent evidence (6Guo Y.

Recent studies from our laboratory have revealed that ∼507 of the cysteine in the GSH pool in cultured human liver cells is derived from homocysteine (1Mosharov E. Cranford M.R. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13005-13011Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Thus, the transsulfuration pathway is a quantitatively significant contributor to GSH biosynthesis and provides a direct link between homocysteine and GSH-dependent redox homeostasis. Elevated levels of homocysteine are an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis in the cerebral, coronary, and peripheral vasculature (2Refsum H. Ueland P.M. Nygard O. Vollset S.E. Annu. Rev. Med. 1998; 49: 31-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1836) Google Scholar) and are correlated with neural tube defects and Alzheimer's disease (3Mills J.L. McPartlin J.M. Kirke P.N. Lee Y.J. Conle M.R.

However, despite the recent media and scientific attention to hyperhomocysteinemia-linked heart disease, our understanding of the regulation of homocysteine metabolism and its consequent effects on the downstream GSH biosynthetic pathway remains poor. Cystathionine औ-synthase (CBS) catalyzes the first step in the transsulfuration pathway, and its activity is redox-sensitive and decreases ∼2-fold under reductive conditions in vitro (5Taoka S.

Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10454-10461Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Our studies with the human hepatoma cell line, HepG2, have revealed that oxidative stress induced by exogenous peroxides increases the flux of homocysteine through transsulfuration and leads to enhanced GSH synthesis (1Mosharov E. Cranford M.R. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13005-13011Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been implicated in various biological processes, including gene expression, cell growth, differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis (7Sen C.K. Packer L. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 709-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar, 8Suzuki Y.J. Forman H.J. Sevanian A. Free Radic. Biol.

It has been shown that the oxidative signaling pathways for intracellular and extracellular peroxides are different, at least in some systems (10Pantopoulos K. Mueller S. Atzberger A. Ansorge W.

Thus, it is of significant interest to study the consequences of ROS generated via a signaling pathway on homocysteine-linked GSH homeostasis. TNFα is a polypeptide that induces a variety of cellular actions, depending on its concentration and the type of cells where it acts (11Beutler B. Cerami A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 505-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). As a ubiquitous pro-inflammatory cytokine, TNFα promotes cell injury through several mechanisms, including the overproduction of intracellular ROS that may damage critical cellular components such as proteins, lipids, and DNA (12Li Y.P. Schwartz R.J. Waddell I.D. Holloway B.R. Reid M.B. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 871-880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Morales A. Garcia-Ruiz C. Miranda M. Mari M. Colell A. Ardite E. Fernandez-Checa J.C. J.

However, the ability of TNFα to kill cells appears to be restricted to tumor and virally infected cells, because normal cells are generally insensitive to its toxic effect (11Beutler B. Cerami A.

The mechanism is probably associated with enhancement of the intracellular antioxidant capacity (13Morales A. Garcia-Ruiz C. Miranda M. Mari M. Colell A. Ardite E. Fernandez-Checa J.C. J. Biol.

The ability of TNFα to stimulate endogenous ROS formation and enhance GSH synthesis prompted us to examine the sensitivity of the flux through CBS in HepG2 cells treated with TNFα. Additionally, mice were employed as an animal model to study the effect of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ROS on the transsulfuration pathway. LPS is a component of the Gram-negative bacterial wall that triggers synthesis and release of TNFα and stimulates production of ROS in experimental animals (18Sprong R.C. Winkelhuyzen-Janssen A.M.

Our results reveal an unexpected post-translational mechanism of activation of CBS induced by TNFα, namely, targeted proteolysis, and implicates a role for O2⨪ in this process. HepG2 (from ATCC Repository) cells were grown in MEM (Sigma) with 107 fetal bovine serum (FBS) and maintained at 37 °C, 57 CO2. When cells were 60–807 confluent, the culture medium was changed to MEM lacking FBS and maintained under these conditions for 24 h. Experiments were initiated with fresh MEM lacking FBS and containing TNFα (Promega), and cells were harvested at the desired time. Unless specified otherwise, the concentration of TNFα employed was 25 ng/ml. For measurement of cystathionine, cells were preincubated for 1 h with 2.5 mm propargylglycine before treatment with TNFα. The procedures employed were approved by the Animal Care Committee at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Animals were housed and sacrificed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Male mice (BALB/c strain) weighing 30–50 g were divided into two groups. The LPS-treated group received LPS (2.5 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) and the control group received saline (1 ml, intraperitoneal). At the desired time following injection, animals were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of Beuthanasia®-D Special containing 9.5 mg of pentobarbital sodium and 1.25 mg of phenytoin sodium (Schering-Plough Animal Health Corp., Bloomfield, NJ). The mice were sacrificed by exsanguination, and the livers were rapidly removed, freeze-clamped in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C until further used. ROS generation in cells was assessed using 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA) (Molecular Probes) as a probe. One hour prior to harvesting of cells, H2DCFDA (10 ॖg/ml) was added to culture dishes, followed by washing twice with PBS to remove excess probe. Cells were harvested by trypsinization and resuspended in 1 ml of PBS. The cell suspension (10 ॖl) was mixed with 990 ॖl, and DCF fluorescence was measured by a fluorometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50) with excitation at 490 nm and emission at 520 nm and a slit width of 5 nm for both excitation and emission. The fluorescence value was normalized by protein concentration. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and collected by scraping and divided into two portions. The first (50 ॖl) was centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant (40 ॖl) was discarded, and 90 ॖl of lysis buffer (containing 20 mmHepes, 25 mm KCl, 0.57 Nonidet P-40, and 1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4) was added. The suspension was kept on ice for 10 min. Following centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 5 min, the supernatant was used to determine protein concentration by the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. The second aliquot of cells was deproteinized by mixing with an equal amount (50 ॖl) of fixing solution (16.8 g/liter metaphosphoric acid, 5 m NaCl, and 5 mmEDTA). After 10-min incubation at room temperature, the mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 3 min, and the supernatant was collected. For measurement of GSH levels in liver, the tissue was homogenized in liquid nitrogen. The homogenate was deproteinized as described above, and supernatant was collected. The supernatants from cell extract and liver homogenate were used to determine thiol compounds by high-performance liquid chromatography as described previously (21Reed D. Babson J. Beatty P. Brodie A. Ellis W. Potter D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 106: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar). The cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and collected by scraping. KCl (150 ॖl of 1.127 (w/v)) was added to tubes containing cells and mixed. The cells were frozen in liquid nitrogen for 5 min and then thawed at room temperature. After three such cycles, cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected. For measurement of CBS activity in liver, the liver homogenate was mixed with 1.127 (w/v) KCl, and the supernatant was collected. CBS activity in HepG2 and liver was measured according to the method reported by Kashiwamata and Greenberg (22Kashiwamata S. Greenberg D.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 212: 488-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Briefly, 72 ॖl of supernatant was mixed with 3 ॖl of 1.2 mm pyridoxal phosphate, 15 ॖl of 2.5 mm propargylglycine, and 10 ॖl of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.3. A blank was prepared with the same components except that 72 ॖl of 1.127 KCl replaced the supernatant. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Then, the mixture was combined with 15 ॖl of 1.0 m serine and 30 ॖl of 0.75m homocysteine and mixed. In some experiments, 0.38 mm AdoMet was added to the reaction mixture to test the effect of this allosteric regulator of the full-length form of CBS. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and terminated by adding 15 ॖl of 507 (v/v) trichloroacetic acid. The mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 2 min. 100 ॖl of supernatant was mixed with 800 ॖl of ninhydrin solution. The mixture was boiled for 5 min and then cooled on ice for 2 min. The absorbance of the solution was determined at 455 nm. The activity was calculated using an extinction coefficient for cystathionine of 1155m−1cm−1, and 1 unit of activity represents formation of 1 nmol of cystathione h−1mg−1 of total protein at 37 °C. Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (1Mosharov E. Cranford M.R. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13005-13011Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). The bands were quantified by densitometry using Image software (National Institutes of Health). The band intensities were normalized versus 28 S rRNA. Western blot analysis of CBS was performed as described previously (1Mosharov E. Cranford M.R. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13005-13011Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Purified polyclonal antibodies against CBS were used for detection of proteins. The membrane was exposed to ECL Hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences) for 1–5 min, and the film was developed. To ensure equal loading, the membrane was stripped by incubation with 0.1 m lysine, pH 2.9, for 30 min and re-probed using a commercial antibody against actin (Sigma). The bands were quantified densitometrically. Transfection was performed using the GeneJammer reagent (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Briefly, HepG2 cells were transfected with 7 ॖg of pCR3-catalase (a gift from Dr. S. G. Rhee, National Institutes of Health), pcDNA3-Mn-SOD (a gift from Dr. L. W. Oberley, University of Iowa), or an empty vector, pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, CA). 48 h following transfection, the medium was replaced with fresh MEM lacking FBS. 24 h later, the cells were treated with TNFα (25 ng/ml) and harvested after 24 h. Data from experiments were expressed as means ± S.D. Statistical comparisons were made using the Student's paired t test. HepG2 cells were incubated with H2DCFDA that readily diffuses into cells and is trapped after cleavage by intracellular esterases. Oxidation by intracellular ROS results in the formation of a highly fluorescent product, DCF, from H2DCF (23Zhu H. Bannenberg G.L. Moldeus P. Shertzer H.G. Arch. Toxicol. 1994; 68: 582-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Enhanced ROS production by cells stimulated by TNFα (25 ng/ml) has been reported previously (13Morales A. Garcia-Ruiz C. Miranda M. Mari M. Colell A. Ardite E. Fernandez-Checa J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30371-30379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and was confirmed by the observation of a 2-fold increase in DCF fluorescence within 2 h reaching a maximal level in 8 h (not shown). Under these conditions, morphological changes or evidence of cell death due to TNFα exposure were not observed. To monitor changes in the intracellular cystathionine concentration, which is very low, propargylglycine was used to inhibit the next enzyme in the pathway, γ-cystathionase. Addition of propargylglycine to the culture medium results in a time-dependent increase in the concentration of cystathionine. Addition of TNFα (25 ng/ml) to HepG2 cells increased cystathionine levels by ∼767 after 24 h (Fig.2A). Under these conditions, a corresponding increase in GSH content was observed (Fig.2B), which is in agreement with results reported previously (13Morales A. Garcia-Ruiz C. Miranda M. Mari M. Colell A. Ardite E. Fernandez-Checa J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30371-30379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Next, we determined whether increased formation of cystathionine elicited by TNFα was due to an increase in CBS activity. Addition of TNFα increased CBS activity by ∼507 of control values after 16 h of treatment (p < 0.01) and ∼607 of control values after 24 h (p < 0.01, Fig.3A). The effect of TNFα on CBS activity was found to be dose-dependent, and 10–25 ng/ml was sufficient to achieve a maximal effect (Fig.3B). The possible influence of TNFα on CBS mRNA levels was probed by Northern blot analysis. As shown in Fig.4A, TNFα did not alter the amount of the CBS transcript, ruling out a role for this cytokine in transcriptional regulation of CBS expression. We next performed Western blot analysis to determine if TNFα increases CBS activity by increasing enzyme levels. Under in vitro conditions, two forms of CBS have been characterized and correspond to the full-length (with 63-kDa subunits) and truncated forms (with 45-kDa subunits), respectively (24Taoka S. Widjaja L. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13155-13161Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 25Shan X. Kruger W.D. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 91-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 26Kery V. Poneleit L. Kraus J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 355: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The truncated form of the enzyme is derived by limited proteolytic cleavage of the full-length form, is dimeric rather than tetrameric, and displays a 4-fold higherkcat value than the full-length form assayed in the absence of the allosteric activator, AdoMet (24Taoka S. Widjaja L. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13155-13161Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Although the 45-kDa truncated form of CBS has been reported in aged rat and human liver extracts (27Skovby F. Kraus J.P. Rosenberg L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 588-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), only the 63-kDa full-length form is detected in fresh tissues and in HepG2 and other cell types. Surprisingly, administration of TNFα was found to elicit targeted CBS cleavage, which was clearly observed at 16 and 24 h following exposure to TNFα (Fig. 4, B and C). Decrease in the level of the full-length form was paralleled by an increase in the level of the truncated form of CBS after 16 and 24 h of treatment. These results suggest that the TNFα-induced increase in CBS activity is due to targeted proteolysis of the full-length tetrameric enzyme to the more active truncated dimeric form. To further confirm that the increase in CBS activity by TNFα is due to the production of the truncated form that has been characterized previously in vitro (24Taoka S. Widjaja L. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13155-13161Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 25Shan X. Kruger W.D. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 91-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 26Kery V. Poneleit L. Kraus J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 355: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), we determined the activity of the enzyme in the presence and absence of AdoMet, which is an allosteric activator of the full-length enzyme. Limited proteolysis of CBS to generate the truncated form is accompanied by loss of the C-terminal regulatory domain and a concomitant loss of sensitivity to the allosteric regulator, AdoMet (26Kery V. Poneleit L. Kraus J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 355: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In control cells that were not exposed to TNFα, addition of AdoMet resulted in a 3-fold increase in CBS activity (Fig. 5). In contrast, CBS activity was stimulated only 1.7-fold by AdoMet in TNFα-treated cells. These results are consistent with the formation of truncated CBS lacking the AdoMet-responsive regulatory domain in TNFα-treated cells. Residual activation that is observed under these conditions is due to the remaining full-length form and corresponds well with the conversion of ∼707 of the full-length form to the truncated one observed by Western analysis (Fig. 4C). To gain insight into the role of intracellular ROS in regulating the cleavage of CBS, cells were treated with specific inhibitors of ROS production and various antioxidants or ROS scavengers. Among the inhibitors of ROS production, apocynin has been shown to inhibit the function of NADPH oxidase, which produces ROS in the plasma membrane (28Beswick R.A. Dorrance A.M. Leite R. Webb R.C. Hypertension. 2001; 38: 1107-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). In contrast, rotenone and thenoyltrifluoroacetone are inhibitors of complexes I and II, respectively, in the mitochondrial electron transport chain (29Corda S. Laplace C. Vicaut E. Duranteau J. Am. J. Respir. 2001; 24: 762-768Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6A, apocynin (0.3 mm) was ineffective in suppressing TNFα-mediated proteolysis of CBS suggesting that this pathway for ROS formation is not involved in signaling CBS cleavage. In contrast, the combination of rotenone (5 ॖm) and thenoyltrifluoroacetone (5 ॖm) substantially inhibited cleavage of CBS induced by TNFα, suggesting a role for mitochondrial generation of ROS in TNFα-mediated regulation of CBS. O2⨪ is one of the primary ROS produced in cells treated with TNFα (30Meier B. Radeke H.H. Selle S. Younes M. Sies H. Resch K. Habermehl G.G. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 31Hennet T. Richter C. Peterhans E. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 587-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of HepG2 cells with Tiron (5 mm), a cell-permeable scavenger of O2⨪ (32Li C.Q. Trudel L.J. Wogan G.N. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2002; 15: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), effectively blocked the cleavage of CBS mediated by TNFα. In contrast, the effect of TNFα on CBS was unaffected by GSH ethyl ester, a cell-permeable scavenger of H2O2 (33Ishibashi M. Akazawa S. Sakamaki H. Matsumoto K. Yamasaki H. Yamaguchi Y. Goto S. Urata Y. Kondo T. Nagataki S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 447-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). It has been shown that TNFα induces the production of O2⨪ as well as NO, resulting in the formation of peroxynitrite (ONOO−) (34Phelps D.T. Ferro T.J. Higgins P.J. Shankar R. Parker D.M. Johnson A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: L551-L559PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the role of ONOO− on TNFα-induced CBS cleavage, HepG2 cells were pretreated with uric acid, a scavenger of peroxynitrite (32Li C.Q. Trudel L.J. Wogan G.N. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2002; 15: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.6A, uric acid (1 mm) did not attenuate the TNFα-dependent effect on CBS. In addition, treatment of HepG2 cells with 25 mm dimethyl sulfoxide, a hydroxyl radical scavenger (35Haddad J.J. Land S.C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), did not abolish TNFα-mediated cleavage of CBS. These results specifically implicate O2⨪ as the ROS that is involved in TNFα-induced cleavage of CBS and are consistent with the previous report that exogenous H2O2, which enhances flux of homocysteine through the transsulfuration pathway, does not induce targeted proteolysis of CBS (1Mosharov E. Cranford M.R. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13005-13011Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Superoxide dismutase (SOD) catalyzes dismutation of O2⨪ to H2O2 and O2. The involvement of O2⨪ in TNFα-induced CBS cleavage was further confirmed by transient transfection of HepG2 cells with an expression plasmid for Mn-SOD. After incubation with TNFα for 24 h, CBS was detected by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 6B, transfection with Mn-SOD inhibited TNFα-induced cleavage of CBS. In contrast, transfection with an empty vector or an expression plasmid for catalase (data not shown), did not affect CBS cleavage induced by TNFα. In general, TNFα induces degradation of cellular proteins by activating one of two principal pathways: cytosolic calcium-activated proteases (calpains) and the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (36Mallampalli R.K. Ryan A.J. Salome R.G. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9699-9708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Although ubiquitin-directed degradation in proteasomes generally leads to complete degradation in most cases, in a few cases, limited proteolysis is observed (37Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1915) Google Scholar). We found that ALLN, an inhibitor of calpains I and II as well as an inhibitor of the proteasome (38Wu H.-M. Chi K.-H. Lin W.-W. FEBS Lett. 2002; 526: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), did not block cleavage of CBS induced by TNFα (Fig.7). In contrast, lactacystin and MG132, which are widely used as inhibitors of the 20 S and 26 S proteasomes (36Mallampalli R.K. Ryan A.J. Salome R.G. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9699-9708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), respectively, effectively inhibited cleavage of CBS induced by TNFα, implicating a role for the proteasome in proteolytic activation of CBS. We were interested in determining whether our unexpected observation of targeted proteolysis of CBS in cultured cells could be extended to an animal model. Administration of the pro-inflammatory agent LPS has been shown to stimulate production of ROS, such as O2⨪, in the liver (19Bautista A.P. Spitzer J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: G907-G912PubMed Google Scholar) and kidney (20Zurovsky Y. Gispaan I. Am. J. Kid. Dis. 1995; 25: 51-57Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) of mice. LPS also induces production of TNFα, and host susceptibility to LPS appears to be correlated with the levels of circulating TNFα that develop in response to LPS (39Dinges M.M. Schlievert P.M. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 7169-7172Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Injection of mice with LPS resulted in increased CBS activity and GSH concentration in livers within 4h (Fig.8, A and B). Western blot analysis revealed that the increase in CBS activity was accompanied by increased conversion of full-length CBS to the truncated form (Fig. 8C). Two forms of CBS have been characterized under in vitroconditions, a full-length and a truncated form, which exist in the tetrameric and dimeric oligomerization states, respectively (24Taoka S. Widjaja L. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13155-13161Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The full-length enzyme is a modular protein in which the N-terminal heme domain is followed by a catalytic core and a C-terminal regulatory domain. Deletion of the latter incurs loss of sensitivity to the allosteric activator, AdoMet (24Taoka S. Widjaja L. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13155-13161Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 25Shan X. Kruger W.D. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 91-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 26Kery V. Poneleit L. Kraus J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 355: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The basal activity associated with the full-length enzyme is enhanced 2- to 3-fold in the presence of AdoMet. In contrast, the kcat for the truncated form is 4-fold higher than the basal activity exhibited by the full-length form but is not responsive to AdoMet. Thus, the effective change in kcat accompanying truncation of CBS is a 1.5- to 2-fold increase over the full-length form in the presence of physiological concentrations of AdoMet. Although the kinetic and spectroscopic properties of the two forms have been studied quite extensively with purified recombinant enzyme, the physiological relevance, if any, of the truncated form is unknown. In this study, we have made the unexpected observation that a TNFα-induced increase in the flux of homocysteine through the transsulfuration pathway is accompanied by an increase in CBS activity that is correlated with targeted proteolysis of the enzyme to generate a truncated form. The concomitant loss of sensitivity of CBS activity to AdoMet is consistent with the loss of the C-terminal regulatory domain and generation of the form that has been characterized quite extensively under in vitro conditions (24Taoka S. Widjaja L. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13155-13161Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 26Kery V. Poneleit L. Kraus J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 355: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Targeted proteolysis leading to loss of ∼18 kDa from the N terminus is incompatible with retention of enzyme activity, because it would destroy the active site as revealed by the structure of the protein (6Taoka S. Lepore B.W. Kabil Ö. Ojha S. Ringe D. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10454-10461Crossre"
https://openalex.org/W2156039738,"The change in enthalpy and rate constants for the reactions of yeast hexokinase isozymes, PI (Hxk1) and PII (Hxk2), was determined at pH 7.6 and 25 °C by isothermal titration calorimetry. The reactions were done in five buffer systems with enthalpy of protonation varying from –1.22 kcal/mol (phosphate) to –11.51 kcal/mol (Tris), allowing the determination of the number of protons released during glucose phosphorylation. The reaction is exothermic for both isozymes with a small, but significant (p < 0.0001), difference in the enthalpy of reaction (ΔHR), with an ΔHR of –5.1 ± 0.2 (mean ± S.D.) kcal/mol for Hxk1, and an ΔHR of –3.3 ± 0.3 (mean ± S.D.) kcal/mol for Hxk2. The Km for ATP determined by ITC was very similar to those reported in the literature for both isozymes. The effect of NaCl and KCl, from 0 to 200 mm, showed that although the rate of reaction decreases with increasing ionic strength, no change in the ΔHR was observed suggesting an entropic nature for the ionic strength. The differences in ΔHR obtained here for both isozymes strongly suggest that, besides glucose phosphorylation, another side reaction such as ATP hydrolysis and/or enzyme phosphorylation is taking place.

In baker's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, there are three enzymes that phosphorylate sugars: two hexokinases, PI (Hxk1) 1The abbreviations used are: Hxk1 and Hxk2, PI and PII isoforms of yeast hexokinase; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; G6PD, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; ΔHcal, observed calorimetric enthalpy; ΔHP, enthalpy of buffer protonation; ΔHR, enthalpy of reaction; Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; Glc-6-P, glucose 6-phosphate. and PII (Hxk2), which catalyze the phosphorylation of glucose, fructose, and mannose; and a glucokinase specific for glucose and mannose. These enzymes are involved in the control of metabolism in yeast, but their individual roles are still unclear. The wild-type strain of S. cerevisiae is able to adapt metabolism to growth conditions in response to the carbon source. Carbon catabolite repression is a transcriptional regulatory mechanism triggered by high concentrations of glucose and fructose, where the expression of a large number of genes necessary for the utilization of other carbon sources is repressed (1Moreno F. Herrero P. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2002; 26: 83-90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Gancedo J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 297-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 3de Winde J.H. Crauwels M.

Chem. 1982; 257: 870-874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the triggering mechanism of catabolite repression is associated with the activity of Hxk1 and Hxk2 (2Gancedo J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 297-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 3de Winde J.H. Crauwels M. Hohmann S. Thevelein J.M. Winderickx J. Eur. J.

Biotechnol. 1998; 50: 579-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) showed that glucose and fructose are equally capable of triggering catabolite repression. However, glucose repression requires Hxk2 (7Entian K.D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1980; 178: 633-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), whereas either Hxk1 or Hxk2 is important for triggering fructose repression (2Gancedo J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 297-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). There is evidence that it is the presence of the protein and not the sugar kinase activity that acts as a signal for glucose repression (8Hohmann S. Winderickx J. de Winde J.H. Valckx D. Cobbaert P.

Yeast. 2001; 18: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For instance, cell lines overexpressing glucokinase in a Hxk1/Hxk2 double-null mutant are insensitive to glucose repression whereas the phosphorylating activity increased 3-fold (10Rose M Albig W. Entian K.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Although mutant alleles with Hxk2 deletions at either the N terminus (Δ1–15) or the C terminus (Δ476–486) presented low catalytic activity they were still fully functional in glucose signaling (11Mayordomo I. Sanz P. Yeast. 2001; 18: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The Hxk2 is not only located in the cytosol but also in the nucleus in S. cerevisiae (1Moreno F. Herrero P.

The nuclear localization of this enzyme seems to be involved in the formation of regulatory DNA-protein complexes necessary for signaling the glucose repression of the SUC2 gene, which encodes the secreted enzyme invertase that hydrolyzes sucrose and raffinose (15Herrero P. Martinez-Campa C. Moreno F. FEBS Lett. 1999; 434: 71-76Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The nuclear Hxk2 is also involved in the formation of specific DNA-protein complexes during glucose-dependent repression of these genes (12Martínez-Campa C. Herrero P. Ramírez M. Moreno F. FEMS Lett. 1996; 137: 69-74Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 13Herrero P. Ramírez M. Martínez-Campa C. Moreno F.

Further evidence, using mutant cell lines expressing a truncated version of Hxk2 unable to enter the nucleus, showed that nuclear Hxk2 is necessary for glucose-induced repression signaling of HXK1 and GLK1 genes that encode for Hxk1 and glucokinase, respectively, and for glucose-induced expression of the HXK2 gene, which encodes the Hxk2 protein (15Herrero P. Martinez-Campa C. Moreno F. FEBS Lett. 1999; 434: 71-76Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Another protein, Med8p, was recently identified as a factor required for SUC2 gene expression in S. cerevisiae (18Chaves R.S. Herrero P. Moreno F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 19Moreno-Herrero F. Herrero P. Colchero J. Baro A.M. Moreno F.

Biol. 2002; 319: 703-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This protein binds to downstream repressing sequences of the HXK2 gene and to the upstream activating sequences of the SUC2 gene (18Chaves R.S. Herrero P. Moreno F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 19Moreno-Herrero F. Herrero P. Colchero J. Baro A.M. Moreno F. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Recently, de la Cera et al. (20de la Cera T. Herrero P. Moreno-Herrero F. Chaves R.S. Moreno F. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 703-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) showed that Hxk2 interacts specifically with Med8p both in vivo and in vitro, suggesting this interaction as a possible model of how Hxk2 is involved in glucose signaling Although the hexokinase isozymes play such different roles in yeast, 78% identity and around 90% homology in the amino acid sequence of Hxk1 (21Kopetzki E. Entian K.D. Mecke D. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 39: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and Hxk2 (22Frohlich K.U. Entian K.D. Mecke D. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 39: 105-111Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar) was found by using the Smith and Waterman algorithm (23Smith T.F. Waterman M.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 147: 195-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (7150) Google Scholar). These enzymes are well characterized as homodimers of 52 kDa per subunit (24Easterby J.S. Rosemeyer M.A. Eur. J.

Each subunit of the yeast hexokinase isozymes consists of two domains separated by a deep cleft where glucose binds (27Steitz T.A. Anderson W.F. Fletterick R.J. Anderson C.M. J. Biol.

Binding of glucose causes a 12o rotation of one domain related to the other, closing the cleft (30Bennett W.S. Steitz T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4848-4852Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) and increasing the affinity for ATP (31Kaji A. Colowik S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 4454-4462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Dela Fuente G. Lagunas R. Sols A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 16: 226-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). At neutral pH, Hxk1 and Hxk2 are dimers, which can dissociate into monomers by increasing the pH or the ionic strength (33Shill J.P. Peters B.A. Neet K.E. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3864-3871Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 34Womack F. Colowick S.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 191: 742-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Despite of the great structural similarity of the yeast hexokinase isozymes, binding of glucose is strongly cooperative in the dimeric Hxk1 (35Hoggett J.G. Kellett G.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 66: 65-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 36Hoggett J.G. Kellett G.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 68: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) in contrast to the dimeric Hxk2 in which both sites are equivalent and binding is non-cooperative (36Hoggett J.G. Kellett G.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 68: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 37Mayes E.L. Hoggett J.G. Kellett G.L. Eur. J. Biochemistry. 1983; 133: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The equilibrium of association-dissociation of the yeast hexokinases seems to play an important role in the regulatory properties of these enzymes. It has been shown that under conditions of derepression both hexokinase isozymes are predominantly phosphorylated (38Vojtek A.B. Fraenkel D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 190: 371-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), lacking the ability for dimerization (39Kriegel T.M. Rush J. Vojtek A.B. Clifton D. Fraenkel D.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation can be induced by addition of glucose (38Vojtek A.B. Fraenkel D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 190: 371-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In this work, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was used to determine the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of the yeast hexokinase isozymes. ITC is a very sensitive technique based on the direct determination of the heat, absorbed or released, in a chemical reaction. The ITC results revealed that although the reaction is exothermic for both Hxk1 and Hxk2, there is a difference of 1.8 kcal/mol in their enthalpy of the reaction. Nevertheless, these isozymes have very similar behavior: they are both inhibited by phosphate and by increasing ionic strength, without a significant change in the reaction enthalpy. Studies with buffers of different enthalpy of ionization allowed the determination of the net number of protons released in the reaction. Materials—The yeast hexokinase (ATP:d-hexose 6-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.1) isozymes, PI (type C-301) and PII (type C-302), were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. as crystalline suspensions in ammonium sulfate. Prior to use, the ammonium sulfate was removed by centrifugation of the samples. After resuspension of the enzyme in the buffer used in the reaction medium, it was dialyzed for 2 h against the same buffer in the microdialyzer system 100 from Pierce to eliminate traces of ammonium sulfate. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD, EC 1.1.1.49) from Leuconostoc mesenteroides, NAD+, glucose, ATP, and the buffers (Tris, Mops, Hepes, and imidazole) were also from Sigma. MgCl2 was from Merck Indústrias Químicas S.A., Brazil. All reagents were analytical grade. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—The observed calorimetric enthalpies (ΔHcal) and the rate constants for the reaction of the yeast hexokinase isozymes were determined from thermograms (heat flow as a function of time) obtained in a MCS isothermal titration calorimeter from MicroCal Llc (Northampton, MA) at 25 °C. The principles of implementation of ITC were described by Wiseman et al. (40Wiseman T. Willinston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2438) Google Scholar). The reactions started by the injection of a small volume (7–21 μl) of the enzyme solution into the sample cell (volume, 1.38 ml) loaded with the reaction medium containing an excess of glucose and MgCl2, but limited amounts of ATP. The final concentration of hexokinase in the calorimetric cell varied from 0.05 to 0.30 units/ml as indicated in the text. The Hxk1 and Hxk2 solutions were prepared in the same buffer of the reaction in order to minimize the heat effects due to enzyme dilution during the injection. A second injection of enzyme was always obtained after completion of the reaction to obtain the correct baseline and also to determine the heat of dilution of the enzyme solution, which was subtracted from the total heat of reaction. In the absence of salt (KCl or NaCl), the heat of dilution corresponded to 0.4–0.8% of the total heat of reaction. The heat of dilution increased to 2–3% when the concentration of salt was higher than 125 mm. Since there is a proton release in the reaction catalyzed by hexokinase, the experiments were carried out in buffer systems with different enthalpies of protonation (Tris, imidazole, Mops, Hepes, and phosphate). The reaction medium contained 50 mm buffer, pH 7.6, 0.1 mm ATP, 10 mm glucose, and 5 mm MgCl2. In the presence of KCl or NaCl (up to 200 mm) the concentration of the buffer in the reaction medium was lowered to 10 mm. The duration of the injection varied from 13.83 to 20.74 s, depending on the injected volume of enzyme. In all the experiments, the syringe was rotated at 400 rpm. Determination of Enzymatic Rate Constants and Calorimetric Enthalpies from Thermograms—The initial rate of reaction (v0) was determined according to Williams and Toone (41Williams B.A. Toone E.J. J. Org. Chem. 1993; 58: 3507-3510Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar) from the slope of the linear portion of the curves of the integrated heat (μcal) as a function of time, where straight lines of linear correlation coefficients of at least 0.999 were obtained. The data were also analyzed according to Morin and Freire (42Morin P.E. Freire E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8494-8500Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The heat flow (dQ/dt) is directly proportional to the rate of product formation and can be described according to Equation 1, dQ/dt=ΔH V(d[P]dt)Eq. 1 where ΔH is the enthalpy change for the reaction, V is the volume of the calorimetric cell, and [P] is the concentration of product. Under the experimental conditions used here, the reaction can be described in terms of first-order kinetics in relation to ATP, and the heat flow is given by Equation 2, dQ/dt=ΔH Vk[C0] exp(−kt)Eq. 2 where k is the rate constant, and [C0] is the initial concentration of substrate (ATP). The observed calorimetric enthalpy (ΔHcal) for the reaction of the yeast hexokinase isozymes was determined by dividing the total heat (QT) released in the reaction by the amount of product formed. QT was calculated by integrating the area under the peak of the calorimetric thermograms (dQ/dt as a function of time), and the amount of product formed (glucose 6-phosphate, Glc-6-P) in the assay was determined as described below. Data analysis was done with the Origin 5.0 software provided by MicroCal. Assay for Hexokinase Activity—The kinetics of glucose phosphorylation by the yeast hexokinase isozymes was followed by measuring NADH formation at 340 nm in the coupled reaction with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Data collection and analysis were done in a Hitachi U-2000 double-beam spectrophotometer equipped with a signal processing and control system that allows the calculation of rates of reaction using the time scan procedure. The assay media were the same used in the calorimetric experiments with the addition of G6PD (2.0 units/ml) and NAD+ (1.0 mm). The reactions were started by the addition of Hxk1 or Hxk2. The results were corrected for the dilution caused by the addition of G6PD and NAD+, absent in the calorimetric reactions. Enzymatic rates were determined by non-linear least square fits of the exponential growth of product formed with time, by monitoring the A340 as a function of time. Spectrophotometric Determination of Glucose 6-Phosphate—The amount of Glc-6-P formed in the reactions at the calorimeter was determined in parallel to the calorimetric measurements with an aliquot of the same volume of reaction medium used in the calorimetric cell (1.38 ml). The reaction was started after equilibrating the reaction medium in a water bath at 25.0 ± 0.3 °C at the same time as the reaction in the calorimeter cell was started by adding the same amount of hexokinase as that injected into the cell. After reaching the baseline and before the second injection in the calorimeter, the test tube was removed from the bath and placed in boiling water for 1 min in order to stop the reaction. It was then transferred to ice for at least 10 min before addition of G6PD and NAD+. After 20 min at 25.0 ± 0.2 °C, the amount of Glc-6-P was determined by measuring the A340, considering that for each Glc-6-P, one NADH is formed. The molar extinction coefficient for NADH at 340 nm is 6,220 m-1 · cm-1. Calorimetric Determination of the Enthalpy of Reaction— The enthalpy of the yeast hexokinase reaction was determined by measuring the heat flow (μcal/sec) as a function of time, following the injection of an enzyme solution into the calorimeter cell containing the reaction medium. The concentration of Hxk1 or Hxk2 varied from 0.05 to 0.2 units/ml, and all reactions were done with an excess of glucose and MgCl2, but limited amounts of ATP, the only substrate totally consumed during the reactions. Fig. 1 shows a typical calorimetric trace obtained for the Hxk2 reaction at 25 °C in imidazole buffer. The downward displacement of the baseline after injection of the enzyme indicates the exothermic nature of the reaction. As the concentration of ATP decreases, the heat flow returns to the baseline level. After complete consumption of the ATP in the reaction medium, a second injection was done to calculate the heat of enzyme dilution (Fig. 1). The area under the peak corresponds to the total heat (QT) released in the reaction (42Morin P.E. Freire E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8494-8500Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The heat of dilution (Qd) could be minimized to 0.4–0.8% of QT by preparing the enzyme solution in the same buffer as that used in the reaction medium. The observed calorimetric enthalpy (ΔHcal) was calculated by dividing QT by the amount of Glc-6-P formed. The calorimetric enthalpy is the sum of different heat effects taking place during the reaction. If the reaction involves the release (or uptake) of protons, for instance, ΔHcal will be a combination of the intrinsic enthalpy of reaction (ΔHR), and the enthalpy of protonation (or ionization) for each proton absorbed (or released) by the buffer used. In the reaction catalyzed by hexokinases the phosphorylation of glucose is accompanied by a release of H+ to the solution, which, in turn, is absorbed by the buffer. The relationship between ΔHcal and the enthalpy of buffer protonation (ΔHP) can be expressed by Equation 3, ΔHcal=ΔHR+n ΔHpEq. 3 where n represents the number of protons released in the reaction and absorbed by the buffer, and ΔHR is the intrinsic enthalpy of reaction. Different buffer systems with ΔHP ranging from -1.22 kcal/mol (phosphate) to -11.38 kcal/mol (Tris) at 25 °C (43Fukada H. Takahashi K. Proteins. 1998; 33: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) were chosen to study the reaction of the yeast hexokinases, and the correlation between ΔHcal and ΔHP for both isozymes is shown in Fig. 2. From these curves, it was found that although the reaction is exothermic for either Hxk1 or Hxk2, a small difference in ΔHR was found. The intercept gives a ΔHR of -5.13 ± 0.24 kcal/mol for Hxk1 and ΔHR of -3.34 ± 0.27 kcal/mol for Hxk2. Nevertheless, the number of protons released during the glucose phosphorylation reaction is essentially the same for Hxk1 (n = 0.94) and Hxk2 (n = 0.96). In those experiments, it was found that both isozymes were inhibited in phosphate buffer. On the contrary, the rate of reaction was unaffected with Hepes, imidazole, Mops, or Tris at a final concentration of 50 mm. In order to determine the ΔHcal in phosphate buffer, the concentration of enzyme was increased to 0.3 units/ml, and the thermograms were recorded for a longer period of time to assure the total consumption of the ATP in the medium. A decrease in the buffer concentration from 50 to 10 mm was also important to attenuate the inhibitory effects of phosphate. Calorimetric Determination of Kinetic Parameters—The integrated heat (Q) as a function of time (Fig. 3) shows that the rate of the reaction measured by calorimetery is perfectly comparable to the spectrophotometric assay done in a reaction medium with the same final concentration of reagents of that used in the calorimetric cell. The initial rate of reaction was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As expected from the similar kinetics observed by the two methods employed, the rate of reaction determined by calorimetry was proportional to the amount of enzymes added (Fig. 4A). The initial velocities found from the calorimetric experiments at constant enzyme concentration (0.05 units/ml) and ATP varying from 0.05 to 0.2 mm with saturating concentrations of glucose and Mg2+, allowed the determination of the Km for ATP (Fig. 4B). The Km values obtained from the calorimetric assays for Hxk1 (Km is 155 μm) and Hxk2 (Km is 210 μm) are very similar to those reported in the literature (31Kaji A. Colowik S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 4454-4462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Dela Fuente G. Lagunas R. Sols A. Eur. J.

Rate of reaction as a function of enzyme concentration (A) and the double reciprocal plot of initial velocity as a function of ATP concentration (B) for the reaction catalyzed by Hxk1 as determined by calorimetric assays at 25.04 ± 0.05 °C. The assays were done in 50 mm Mops buffer, pH 7.6, containing 10 mm glucose, 5 mm MgCl2, where the ATP concentration was 0.1 mm in A and varied from 0.05 to 1.0 mm in B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Effect of Ionic Strength in the Reaction Rate and Enthalpy— The effect of ionic strength in the rate of reaction of the yeast hexokinases was studied in 10 mm buffer (Hepes, Mops, imidazole, or Tris) with NaCl or KCl ranging from 0 to 200 mm. Phosphate buffer was not used in this study because of the inhibitory effects on the hexokinase isozymes discussed before. Very similar results were found, either with KCl or NaCl, with the other buffers used here. The rate of reaction decreases with the increase in ionic strength as observed in the calorimetric (Fig. 5A) and in the spectrophotometric (Fig. 5B) assays, where the maximum activity was observed in the absence of salt (10 mm buffer). However, ΔHcal, and consequently ΔHR, did not change over the salt concentration used here, showing that this parameter is independent of ionic strength (Fig. 5C). This result is very similar to those obtained by Morin and Freire (42Morin P.E. Freire E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8494-8500Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) for the reaction with cytochrome c oxidase, where the rate of reaction has a bell-shaped dependence with ionic strength with a maximum at 50 mm KCl, while the ΔHcal does not change with the addition of up to 200 mm KCl. For each case, yeast cytochrome c oxidase and hexokinase isozymes, the decrease on the reaction rate together with the lack of dependence of ΔHR with the ionic strength suggests an entropic nature for these effects. Takahashi et al. (44Takahashi K. Casey J.L. Sturtevant J.M. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4693-4697Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) showed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) that the conformation of the yeast Hxk2 is affected by the ionic strength. In the absence of glucose and at low ionic strength, the thermal unfolding of Hxk2 is characterized by a double-peaked endotherm, resulting from the independent unfolding of the two structural domains of the protein. However, with 200 mm NaCl there is a destabilization of the more stable of the two domains so that both domains unfold as a single unit (44Takahashi K. Casey J.L. Sturtevant J.M. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4693-4697Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the strong effect of NaCl on the interaction between the two domains of the protein is not accompanied by any significant change in the calorimetric enthalpy of unfolding. In this work, it was observed that the heat of enzyme dilution (Qd), obtained from the second injection of enzyme, increased in the reaction media containing KCl or NaCl. In order to study the effects of salt in the conformation of the hexokinases by using ITC, several injections of the enzymes in solutions containing different concentrations of KCl or NaCl were done. The enzyme was prepared in 10 mm buffer and injected in solutions prepared in the same buffer but containing 0, 50, 100, 150, or 200 mm salt. Control experiments were performed by injecting 10 mm buffer in solutions containing variable concentrations of salt. The heat of dilution of the enzyme in 10 mm buffer was exothermic (Qd is -1.36 ± 0.12 kcal/mol for Hxk1, and -1.19 ± 0.07 kcal/mol for Hxk2). In contrast, the transfer of the enzyme at low ionic strength to the cell containing a high ionic strength solution was always endothermic, without significant difference in the range of NaCl or KCl concentrations used here. Thus, Qd was +1.48 ± 0.25 kcal/mol for PI and +1.57 ± 0.4 kcal/mol for PII. Again, as observed with the heat of reaction, there is no enthalpic change induced by increasing ionic strength. This result is consistent with DSC studies (44Takahashi K. Casey J.L. Sturtevant J.M. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4693-4697Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), which showed that although NaCl causes a great effect on the interaction between domains in the yeast hexokinase, this is not accompanied by any significant change in the calorimetric enthalpy of the thermal transition. Enthalpic effects are usually associated with changes in the secondary structure of a protein. Thus, our results indicate that the increase in ionic strength does not induce a major rearrangement on the secondary structure of these isozymes. It is possible that the rate of reaction decreases because of the effect of increasing ionic strength on the equilibrium of association-dissociation of the subunits (34Womack F. Colowick S.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 191: 742-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, the influence of salt on the catalytic rate constant can be explained by the destabilization of one of the domains as observed by Takahashi et al. (44Takahashi K. Casey J.L. Sturtevant J.M. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4693-4697Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The determination of kinetic parameters is essential to characterize enzymes of biological interest. However, the direct measurement of either reagents or products is not always possible by optical or electrochemical assays. Substrate modification by introducing an optically active group can change the kinetic properties of the enzyme, while coupled reactions can also introduce undesirable errors. Isothermal titration calorimetry is a very sensitive technique for the direct determination of thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of enzymatic reactions, based on the measurement of the heat, absorbed or release, in a chemical reaction of binding, dilution, or transformation. ITC has been used for the determination of thermodynamic (41Williams B.A. Toone E.J. J. Org. Chem. 1993; 58: 3507-3510Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 42Morin P.E. Freire E.

The kinetic parameters found here are in agreement with those reported in the literature showing that ITC is suitable for this kind of study. The advantage of using ITC to study the catalytic behavior of hexokinases is that reaction rates can be determined directly without using the coupled reaction with G6PD. This is especially important when the purpose of a particular study involves the effect of activators, inhibitors, or stabilizers. It is important that these compounds will affect only the enzyme of interest and not the other used in the coupled reaction. The ionic strength dependence of the yeast hexokinase activity can be related to different causes. It has been shown that increasing ionic strength affects the monomer-dimer equilibrium, favoring the dissociation to monomers (34Womack F. Colowick S.P. Arch. Biochem.

Therefore, the results found here are indicative that the decrease in the activity of both yeast Hxk1 and Hxk2 is probably a result of the dissociation of the dimers. However, the decrease in activity can be due to the fact that NaCl causes a destabilization of the more stable domain as seen by DSC studies (44Takahashi K. Casey J.L. Sturtevant J.M. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4693-4697Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, our data indicate that the ionic strength effects are of entropic nature. However, the most intriguing result obtained here is related to the enthalpy of the reaction. A difference of 1.8 kcal/mol was found in the enthalpy for the reaction catalyzed by the two hexokinase isozymes from yeast, after taking into account the effects of buffer protonation. Statistical analysis by the Student's t test shows that the difference in heat for the reaction with each isozyme has a high significance level with p < 0.0001. The reaction is exothermic for both Hxk1 and Hxk2. If the heat effects determined as ΔHR were only due to glucose phosphorylation, very similar values for the reaction catalyzed by either isozyme should be expected. Therefore, the ΔHR obtained here may contain other contributions that are not being considered. It is important to remember that ΔHcal is, in fact, a sum of the changes in enthalpy from every single event, reflecting the changes in heat for the whole system. Our results strongly suggest that, besides glucose phosphorylation, another side reaction is taking place. Therefore, the difference in the calculated ΔHR could be either by (i) enzyme phosphorylation (38Vojtek A.B. Fraenkel D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 190: 371-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) or (ii) ATP hydrolysis (17Montero-Lomeli M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1120: 305-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 32Dela Fuente G. Lagunas R. Sols A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 16: 226-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The first usually occurs under conditions of derepression, in vivo. The latter is accounted by an ATPase activity of the yeast hexokinase. Although the ATP hydrolysis reaction is several times slower than glucose phsophorylation, it can be increased by lowering the water activity in the medium (17Montero-Lomeli M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1120: 305-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Therefore, the heat due to reaction (i) or (ii), or a combination of both, will sum up to the heat for the transfer of a phosphate group to glucose resulting in the observed differences in ΔHR. In short, this work suggests that in the overall catalyzed reaction each hexokinase isozyme has a different enthalpic compensation during glucose phosphorylation, which can be important under in vivo conditions. This can explain, in part, the need for two very similar isozymes with different behavior in the control of metabolism in yeast.

In vitro, Hsp70 and Hsp27 inhibit cytochrome c-mediated procaspase 9 processing either by blocking cytochrome c release from mitochondria or by binding the released cytochrome c in the cytosol, thus blocking the apoptotic pathway (13Mosser D.D.

The protection by HSPs against such varied stimuli suggests a common pathway of protection. A preferential target of HSPs protection may be mitochondria. Overexpression of the mitochondrial HSPs, Hsp60 and Hsp10, protects cardiac myocytes from ischemia/reperfusion injury through maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function (15Polla B.S.

Opening of mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) pores plays an important role in regulating apoptotic and necrotic cell death (17Lemasters J.J. Nieminen A.L. Qian T. Trost L.C. Elmore S.P.

Increased Ca2+, ROS, ADP, and atractyloside activate the MPT, whereas cyclosporin A (CsA), bongkrekic acid, Mg2+, Ca2+ chelation, low pH, and ubiquinone analogues such as ubiquinone 0 and decylubiquinone inhibit the MPT (18Bernardi P.

Recently, we presented data that there are two open conductance modes for MPT pores: a regulated mode that is activated by Ca2+ and inhibited by CsA, and an unregulated open mode that does not require Ca2+ and is not inhibited by CsA (20He L.

Lemasters J.J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Despite evidence that HSPs protect mitochondria against injury, no studies have investigated whether the MPT is involved in HSPs protection. Here we investigated the consequence of heat shock to rats on the MPT in isolated rat liver mitochondria. We show that heat shock treatment inhibits the induction of regulated MPT pore opening and increases the threshold of unregulated MPT pore opening, effects that correlate with increased expression of mitochondrial Hsp25. The results suggest that heat shock-inducible factors regulate against the onset of the MPT, which may explain the protection by HSPs against cell injury. Tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM), Fluo-5N, and 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA) were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR); antibodies to inducible Hsp70 (Hsp72), Hsp10, Hsp25, Hsp60, and mitochondrial Hsp70 (Grp75) were from StressGen Biotechnologies (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada); antibody to Hsp75 (tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1: TRAP-1) was from Lab Vision Corp. (Fremont, CA); antibody to voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) was from Calbiochem; and custom-made anti-cyclophilin D (CypD) antibody was from Bethyl Laboratory (Montgomery, TX). Other reagent grade chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (250–300 g) that were fasted overnight were used in all the experiments. For heat shock treatment, rats were anesthetized (50 mg of pentobarbital/kg body weight) and immersed in a 42 °C water bath in plastic bags. Rectal temperature was monitored using a digital thermometer. After rectal temperature reached 42 °C after about 30 min, the rats were maintained at 42 °C for 15 min before removing them from the water bath. Sham-treated rats were subjected to anesthesia only. An additional control group received no treatment. In preliminary experiments, Hsp72 expression in liver homogenates was assessed by Western blotting from 0 to 40 h after heat shock. These experiments showed that peak expression of Hsp72 occurred at 20 h (data not shown). Accordingly, subsequent experiments were performed 20 h after heat shock and sham treatment. Rat liver mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation and resuspended at 50 mg of protein/ml in 200 mm sucrose and 2 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 buffer, as described previously (25Lemasters J.J. Grunwald R. Emaus R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3058-3063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondria were either used immediately or aliquoted, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. In addition, supernatants of the first 10,000 × g spin were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The high speed supernatant representing the cytosolic fraction was frozen in liquid nitrogen and saved for total glutathione measurement and Western blot analysis. Protein concentrations in mitochondria and cytosol were determined by a Biuret procedure using bovine serum albumin as standard (26Gornall A.G. Bardawill D.J. David M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1949; 177: 751-766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondrial oxygen consumption using succinate as a substrate was assessed using a Clark-type oxygen electrode (27Blattner J.R. He L. Lemasters J.J. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 295: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial swelling was monitored at 25 °C by absorbance at 540 nm with a ThermoMax 96-well plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) in incubation buffer containing 200 mm sucrose, 20 ॖm EGTA, 5 mm succinate, 2 ॖmrotenone, 1 ॖg/ml oligomycin, 20 mm Tris, 20 mm HEPES, and 1 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.2, and the MPT was induced by CaCl2, HgCl2, and mastoparan, as described previously (20He L. Lemasters J.J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial membrane potential and Ca2+uptake/release were monitored using 1 ॖm TMRM and 1 ॖm Fluo-5N, respectively, as described previously (27Blattner J.R. He L. Lemasters J.J. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 295: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). ROS formation was monitored fluorometrically after ester loading mitochondria with 10 ॖm H2DCFDA from the rate of increase of the green fluorescence of DCF, the oxidized product of H2DCF. Total glutathione in frozen mitochondria and cytosolic fractions was quantified using the Bioxytech GSH-420 kit (Oxis Research, Portland, OR) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To measure the heat shock proteins Hsp10, Hsp25 (rodent homologue of human Hsp27), Hsp60, Hsp70, Hsp75, and the putative MPT pore complex proteins CypD and VDAC in cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions, proteins were resolved by 8–157 SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Western blotting was carried out and developed using the ECL Plus kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Signals were imaged using a Molecular Dynamics Storm Image System (Eugene, OR). To determine the possible role of heat-inducible factors in MPT regulation, liver mitochondria isolated from control, sham-control, and heat shock-treated rats were incubated with low and high doses of MPT inducers. MPT was monitored by swelling detected by absorbance at 540 nm. In control mitochondria, a low dose of HgCl2 (5 ॖm) induced rapid mitochondrial swelling in the presence of 50 ॖm CaCl2 (Fig.1A, trace a). Swelling was half-maximum after about 5 min of addition of HgCl2 plus CaCl2 and was maximum after about 8 min. MPT induction in mitochondria isolated from control and sham control rats was not different, so only the results from the control group are shown. By contrast, in mitochondria isolated from rats subjected to heat shock, the Ca2+-dependent MPT produced by low dose HgCl2 induction was substantially delayed. In the heat shock group, half-maximum swelling was reached more than 15 min later than in the control group (Fig.1A, trace b). We also induced the unregulated MPT by exposure of mitochondria to higher doses of HgCl2 in the absence of added Ca2+. In control mitochondria, large amplitude mitochondrial swelling began immediately after the addition of 20 ॖm HgCl2 and reached half-maximum within 5 min (Fig. 1B, trace a). Again, there was no difference between the control and sham control groups (data not shown). After heat shock, half-maximal swelling was delayed about 15 min (Fig. 1B, trace b). When the concentration of HgCl2 was increased to 25 and 30 ॖm, heat shock treatment still delayed onset of the MPT (data not shown). By contrast, after addition of 40 ॖm HgCl2, a still higher concentration of HgCl2, swelling was virtually the same in the control and heat shock groups (Fig. 1C,trace a and b, respectively). Therefore, the threshold to induce onset of the unregulated MPT by HgCl2was increased from 20 to 40 ॖm by heat shock treatment. We also examined the effect of heat shock on MPT induction by the amphipathic peptide mastoparan. As shown in Fig.2A, in control mitochondria, a low dose of mastoparan (1 ॖm) plus 50 ॖmCaCl2 induced mitochondrial swelling that reached half-maximum after about 15 min (trace a). This regulated MPT induction was completely blocked by heat shock pretreatment (trace b). When mitochondria were incubated with 3 ॖm mastoparan in the absence of CaCl2, rapid swelling occurred in mitochondria from control rats (Fig.2B, trace a) but not in mitochondria from heat shock-treated rats (trace b). By contrast, when mitochondria were exposed to 4 ॖm mastoparan, a still higher concentration of mastoparan, the onset and progression of the MPT were virtually same in the control and heat shock-treated groups (Fig.2C, trace a and b, respectively), indicating that the threshold of unregulated MPT induction by mastoparan was increased by heat shock pretreatment. Mitochondria were also treated with high (200 ॖm) CaCl2 alone. In mitochondria from control rats, 200 ॖm CaCl2 produced rapid large amplitude swelling, which reached half-maximum within 3 min (Fig.2D, trace a). Heat shock treatment delayed MPT induction by high CaCl2, and half-maximum swelling after 200 ॖm CaCl2 required more than 20 min in mitochondria isolated from heat shock-treated rats (Fig. 2D, trace b). To determine whether delay of onset of the MPT induced by heat shock was related to changes of mitochondrial respiration, we measured mitochondrial state 3 and state 4 respiration and the respiratory control ratio using succinate plus rotenone as substrate in control, sham control, and heat shock mitochondria. As shown in Fig.3A, state 3 and state 4 respiratory rates and respiratory control ratios were not significantly different between groups. These findings indicated that the protective effect of heat shock on MPT induction was not mediated by changes of mitochondrial respiration. To ascertain whether changes of mitochondrial membrane potential and Ca2+ uptake were related to resistance to the MPT after heat shock, we measured ΔΨm and Ca2+ uptake using the fluorescence dyes, TMRM and Fluo-5N, respectively. Mitochondria were preincubated with 1 ॖm TMRM, 1 ॖm Fluo-5N, and 1 ॖm CsA. CsA was added to prevent MPT onset and consequent Ca2+ release. Under these conditions, ΔΨm-dependent TMRM accumulation into mitochondria causes self-quenching of TMRM fluorescence. As shown in Fig. 3B, during the 2–3-min preincubation, TMRM fluorescence in both control (trace a) and heat shock (trace b) groups was relatively low. After the addition of 200 ॖm CaCl2, mitochondria transiently depolarized as Ca2+ uptake occurred, as shown by an increase of TMRM fluorescence. Fluo-5N fluorescence increased immediately after adding CaCl2 and then progressively declined as uptake of Ca2+ into mitochondria occurred. Once all the Ca2+ had accumulated, ΔΨm recovered as shown by the return of TMRM fluorescence to previous levels. Subsequent addition of 1 ॖm CCCP to uncouple mitochondria caused rapid mitochondrial depolarization and release of accumulated Ca2+, as indicated by a rapid increase of TMRM and Fluo-5N fluorescence. As shown by the representative experiments in Fig. 3,B and C, control and heat shock mitochondria were not different with respect to changes of ΔΨm and rates of Ca2+ uptake. Taken together, the results of Fig. 3 indicate that the inhibition of MPT induction after heat shock was not due to alterations of mitochondrial energetic status or Ca2+accumulation. ROS are important inducers of MPT (28Crompton M. Costi A. Hayat L. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 915-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 29Kowaltowski A.J. Castilho R.F. Vercesi A.E. FEBS Lett. 2001; 495: 12-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar), and HSP expression decreases cellular ROS formation after cytokine stimulation (7Mehlen P. Kretz-Remy C. Preville X. Arrigo A.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2695-2706Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 8Diez-Fernandez C. Andres D. Cascales M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 835Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Because mitochondria are a major source of ROS production, we measured ROS formation in isolated mitochondria loaded with 10 ॖm H2DCFDA. Compared with control mitochondria, heat shock treatment deceased DCF formation rate by 277 measured by the rate of formation of green fluorescent DCF (Fig.4A). In control mitochondria, 1 ॖm CsA suppressed DCF formation by 287 to levels nearly identical to heat shock mitochondria (Fig. 4A). By contrast, CsA had virtually no effect on ROS formation by heat shock mitochondria (Fig. 4A). Glutathione levels also modulate MPT induction, and heat shock proteins may protect against oxidative stress by increasing the intracellular glutathione levels (7Mehlen P. Kretz-Remy C. Preville X. Arrigo A.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2695-2706Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we measured mitochondrial and cytosolic glutathione with and without heat shock. In control rats, glutathione levels were 2.6 and 20.7 nmol/mg protein, respectively, in mitochondria and the 100,000 × g cytosolic supernatant. However, heat shock treatment did not alter either mitochondrial or cytosolic glutathione (Fig. 4B). To assess the expression of heat shock proteins, we evaluated a panel of proteins by Western blot analysis in mitochondrial fractions from control, sham control, and heat shock groups. As shown in Fig.5, Hsp25 was minimal in control and sham control mitochondria but increased substantially after heat shock. The expression of Hsp25 was also increased in cytosol (data not shown). In contrast, the levels of the constitutively expressed mitochondrial heat shock proteins Hsp60, Hsp70, Hsp75, and Hsp10 were not affected after heat shock. We also assessed protein levels of putative MPT pore proteins, CypD and VDAC, before and after heat shock. As shown in Fig.5, CypD and VDAC expression was not altered after heat shock. To confirm that the observed increase of Hsp25 in mitochondria was not due to cytosolic contamination, samples were subjected to Western blot using Hsp72 antibody. As shown in Fig. 5, Hsp72 expression was not changed in mitochondria after heat shock but was increased in the cytosol, indicating that the observed increase of Hsp25 expression in mitochondria was not due to cytosolic contamination. Numerous studies have shown that heat shock treatment prevents cell death in various cell types after different stimuli (1–12). The specific mechanisms underlying heat shock protection remain unclear (13Mosser D.D. Caron A.W. Bourget L. Meriin A.B. Sherman M.Y. Morimoto R.I. Massie B. Mol. Cell.

Because onset of the MPT plays an important role in regulating both necrotic and apoptotic cell death (for review see Ref.17Lemasters J.J. Nieminen A.L. Qian T. Trost L.C. Elmore S.P. Nishimura Y. Crowe R.A. Cascio W.E. Bradham C.A. Brenner D.A. Herman B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 177-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar), this study evaluated the effect of heat shock treatment on the MPT. We show that heat shock treatment inhibits onset of the regulated MPT induced by low doses of HgCl2 (Fig. 1A), mastoparan (Fig. 2A), and CaCl2 (Fig.2D). As a result, half-maximal mitochondrial swelling occurred more than 4 times later in the heat shock group than in the control and sham control groups. Heat shock also increased the threshold of the unregulated MPT induced by HgCl2 from 20 to 40 ॖm (Fig. 1, B and C) and by mastoparan from 3 to 4 ॖm (Fig. 2, B andC). Thus, heat shock pretreatment both delays onset of the regulated MPT and increases the threshold of the unregulated MPT. These findings suggest that the protection by heat shock against cellular injury may be mediated, at least in part, by preventing MPT induction. The precise mechanisms of heat shock-induced resistance against MPT induction remain unclear. The MPT pore is a voltage-dependent channel (31Petronilli V. Costantini P. Scorrano L. Colonna R. Passamonti S. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16638-16642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Petronilli V. Nicolli A. Costantini P. Colonna R. Bernardi P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1187: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial respiration creates and maintains the mitochondrial membrane potential. High mitochondrial membrane potential favors a closed conductance state, whereas low membrane potential promotes pore opening. Accordingly, we determined whether mitochondrial state 3 and state 4 respiratory rates and membrane potential were affected by heat shock treatment. Our results showed no difference of respiratory rates, respiratory control ratio, and membrane potential between control and heat shock mitochondria (Fig. 3), indicating that the protection against the MPT by heat shock was not through an alteration of mitochondrial bioenergetic status. Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria is also critical for induction of the regulated MPT (33Petronilli V. Cola C. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1011-1016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake was also unaffected by heat shock treatment (Fig. 3C). These results are consistent with previous studies (4Bornman L. Steinmann C.M. Gericke G.S. Polla B.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 836-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 15Polla B.S. Kantengwa S. Francois D. Salvioli S. Franceschi C. Marsac C. Cossarizza A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6458-6463Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) showing that heat shock treatment itself does not change mitochondrial respiration or membrane potential. In previous studies, heat shock protection against apoptotic stimuli was associated with decreased ROS production and increased intracellular glutathione (7Mehlen P. Kretz-Remy C. Preville X. Arrigo A.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2695-2706Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 34Preville X. Salvemini F. Giraud S. Chaufour S. Paul C. Stepien G. Ursini M.V. Arrigo A.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 247: 61-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). By using H2DCFDA as a probe of ROS formation, we found that ROS production by mitochondria was decreased by 277 in heat shock mitochondria (Fig. 4A), although both mitochondrial and cytosolic levels of glutathione were unaffected (Fig. 4B). The mechanism by which heat shock treatment causes this modest decrease of ROS production is unclear. One possibility is that heat shock treatment blocks transient MPT pore openings (35Petronilli V. Miotto G. Canton M. Brini M. Colonna R. Bernardi P. Di Lisa F. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 725-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 36Huser J. Rechenmacher C.E. Blatter L.A. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2129-2137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) or sustained pore openings in a small subpopulation of mitochondria. Transient pore openings or the occurrence of the MPT in a small mitochondrial subpopulation may contribute to ROS formation in control mitochondria. This hypothesis is consistent with the finding that incubation of control mitochondria with 1 ॖm CsA decreased ROS formation to the levels observed in heat shock mitochondria (Fig. 4A). Inhibition of the MPT may also be the basis by which heat shock prevents H2O2-induced decreases in mitochondrial state 3 respiration and membrane potential reported by others (4Bornman L. Steinmann C.M. Gericke G.S. Polla B.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 836-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). By using Western blot analysis, we found that among the mitochondrial HSPs and putative MPT complex proteins evaluated, only Hsp25 increased after heat shock treatment. Other mitochondrial HSPs (Hsp10, Hsp60, Hsp70, and Hsp75) and the putative MPT complex proteins CypD and VDAC were not affected (Fig. 5). Hsp25 belongs to a family of small heat shock proteins, including Hsp27 (human homologue of Hsp25) and αB-crystalline (37Caspers G.J. Leunissen J.A. de Jong W.W. J. Mol. Evol. 1995; 40: 238-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Hsp25 was reported previously (38van de Klundert F.A. Gijsen M.L. van den IJssel P.R. Snoeckx L.H. de Jong W.W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 75: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) to be in the cytosol and nucleus. Recently, Hsp25 was identified in the mitochondria of mouse PC12 cells (39Downs C.A. Jones L.R. Heckathorn S.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 365: 344-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and heat-shocked Jurkat T-lymphocytes (40Samali A. Robertson J.D. Peterson E. Manero F. van Zeijl L. Paul C. Cotgreave I.A. Arrigo A.P. Orrenius S. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2001; 6: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In our experiments, Hsp25 was barely detectable in liver mitochondria from control rats but increased greatly in both mitochondrial (Fig. 5) and cytosolic fractions (data not shown) after heat shock. Hsp25 may regulate MPT pore opening in two ways. First, Hsp25 expression may suppress ROS production and prevent adverse consequences such as mitochondrial depolarization, cytochrome c release, and apoptosis. Overexpression of human Hsp27 and mouse Hsp25 protects mouse L929 fibroblasts against oxidative stress induced by H2O2 and increases the activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, a regulator of antioxidant pathways (34Preville X. Salvemini F. Giraud S. Chaufour S. Paul C. Stepien G. Ursini M.V. Arrigo A.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 247: 61-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Inhibition of Hsp27 expression with hsp27 antisense also potentiates mitochondrial depolarization and cytochromec release after apoptotic stimuli in Jurkat cells (40Samali A. Robertson J.D. Peterson E. Manero F. van Zeijl L. Paul C. Cotgreave I.A. Arrigo A.P. Orrenius S. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2001; 6: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In mice lacking heat shock transcription factor 1, cardiac Hsp25 expression is decreased; superoxide production is increased; mitochondrial proteins including adenine nucleotide translocator 1 are more oxidized, and isolated mitochondria are more sensitive to MPT induction by CaCl2 (41Yan L.J. Christians E.S. Liu L. Xiao X. Sohal R.S. Benjamin I.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5164-5172Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In our experiments, however, ROS formation declined only 277 after heat shock, which was disproportionate with the suppression of MPT induction. In addition, this decrease of ROS formation appeared to be the consequence of MPT suppression rather than its cause, because CsA treatment of control mitochondria decreased ROS production to that observed in heat shock mitochondria (Fig. 4A). As a second mechanism, Hsp25 may exert direct chaperone-related regulation of pore conductance, as proposed by a recent model of pore formation and gating (20He L. Lemasters J.J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). In this model, stress induces misfolding of mitochondrial membrane proteins, which expose their hydrophilic residues to the bilayer phase and then cluster to form aqueous pores that are permeable to ions and molecules up to a molecular mass of about 1,500 Da. Chaperone proteins and CypD bind to the pore complex to shut off conductance. However, increased Ca2+ causes CypD to perturb the MPT pore complex to an open conductance state, an effect that is antagonized by CsA. As the number of misfolded protein clusters exceeds the number of chaperones available to block MPT pore conductance, unregulated pores accumulate. This model explains observations that low levels of various MPT inducers cause Ca2+-dependent and CsA-sensitive permeabilization of the inner membrane, whereas high levels cause Ca2+-independent and CsA-insensitive onset of the MPT (20He L. Lemasters J.J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 21Pfeiffer D.R. Gudz T.I. Novgorodov S.A. Erdahl W.L. J. Biol.

Biomembr. 1991; 23: 679-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The association of increased Hsp25 expression with inhibition of the regulated MPT and an increased threshold for the unregulated MPT implicates Hsp25 as a candidate chaperone involved in MPT regulation as predicted by the model. The new model is also consistent with the recent finding that overexpression of mitochondrially targeted CypD desensitizes cells against apoptotic stimuli (42Lin D.T. Lechleiter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31134-31141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Our findings in the present study that heat shock treatment inhibits onset of the regulated MPT and increases the threshold for onset of the unregulated MPT (Figs. 1 and 2) can be explained by the model of chaperone regulation of the MPT pore. First, increased concentration of heat-inducible chaperones (e.g. Hsp25) might be expected to retard onset of the MPT by a mass action effect, because the physiological role of the chaperones is to prevent mitochondrial permeabilization and uncoupling after formation of clusters of misfolded mitochondrial membrane proteins. Second, increased availability of heat-induced chaperones would be expected to block a greater number of the misfolded protein clusters, which explains the increased threshold for unregulated MPT induction by both HgCl2 and mastoparan. In this respect we found that the concentration of inductor needed for onset of the unregulated MPT increased from 20 ॖm HgCl2 and 3 ॖm mastoparan for control mitochondria to 40 ॖm HgCl2 and 4 ॖm mastoparan in heat shock mitochondria (Figs. 1C and 2C). The increased threshold of unregulated MPT induction is thus explained by the proposed model. In summary, this study shows for the first time that heat shock pretreatment delays onset of the regulated MPT and increases the threshold of unregulated MPT induction. Heat shock treatment does not alter mitochondrial respiration, membrane potential, Ca2+uptake, or mitochondrial and cytosolic glutathione levels but does cause a modest decrease of ROS production. Of the several HSPs examined, only Hsp25 expression increased after heat shock. Thus, the effect of heat shock on MPT inhibition may be partially through the up-regulation of mitochondrial Hsp25 expression. The effects of heat shock treatment on MPT induction may underlie the mechanism of heat shock protection against various different cell injuries."
https://openalex.org/W1980967830,"Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)) is a mitogen of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMC) and plays an important role in the development of pulmonary hypertension. Signal transduction initiated by 5-HT involves serotonin transporter-dependent generation of reactive oxygen species and activation of the MEK-ERK pathway. However, the downstream transcriptional regulatory components have not been identified. In systemic smooth muscle cells, GATA-6 has been shown to regulate mitogenesis by driving cells into a quiescent state, and the down-regulation of GATA-6 induces mitogenesis. Thus, the present study tested the hypothesis that 5-HT induces mitogenesis of PASMC by down-regulating GATA-6. Quiescent bovine PASMC were treated with 5-HT, and the binding activity of nuclear extracts toward GATA DNA sequence was monitored. Surprisingly, PASMC express GATA-4, and 5-HT up-regulates the GATA DNA binding activity. Pretreatment of cells with inhibitors of serotonin transporter, reactive oxygen species, and MEK blocks GATA-4 activation by 5-HT. GATA-4 is not activated when the ERK phosphorylation site is mutated, indicating that 5-HT phosphorylates GATA-4 via the MEK/ERK pathway. GATA up-regulation is also induced by other mitogens of PASMC such as endothelin-1 and platelet-derived growth factor. Dominant negative mutants of GATA-4 suppress cyclin D2 expression and cell growth, indicating that GATA-4 activation regulates PASMC proliferation. Thus, GATA-4 mediates 5-HT-induced growth of PASMC and may be an important therapeutic target for the prevention of pulmonary hypertension.

Proliferation of smooth muscle cells is an important component of pulmonary vascular remodeling that results in increased medial muscular wall thickness. Among a number of mediators of pulmonary hypertension, serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)1) appears to play an important role in the remodeling of the pulmonary circulation (1Lee S.L. Wang W.W. Fanburg B.L. Circ. Res. 1991; 68: 1362-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 2Eddahibi S. Raffestin B. Pham I. Launay J.M. Aegerter P. Sitbon M. Adnot S. Am. J.

Webb S. Tucker A. Rabinovitch M. Obrien R.F. McMurtry I.F. Stelzne T.J. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1992; 145: 793-797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A further study showed that a continuous intravenous infusion of 5-HT during a 2-week exposure of rats to hypoxia potentiated the development of pulmonary hypertension (2Eddahibi S. Raffestin B. Pham I. Launay J.M. Aegerter P. Sitbon M. Adnot S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H1173-H1181PubMed Google Scholar). The role of 5-HT in pulmonary hypertension appears to be through the serotonin transporter (SERT), as mice deficient for SERT developed less hypoxic pulmonary hypertension and vascular remodeling than did control animals exposed to the same conditions (3Eddahibi S. Hanoun N. Lanfumey L. Lesch K.P. Raffestin B. Hamon M. Adnot S. J. Clin.

(7Eddahibi S. Humbert M. Fadel E. Raffestin B. Darmon M. Capron F. Simonneau G. Dartevelle P. Hamon M. Adnot S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 198: 1141-1150Crossref Scopus (488) Google Scholar) report that pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMC) from patients with primary pulmonary hypertension grow faster than the cells from control subjects due to increased expression of SERT. The importance of 5-HT in human pulmonary hypertension is supported by clinical observations that pulmonary hypertension is associated with the use of amphetamine-like appetite suppressants, fenfluramine, dexfenfluramine, and aminorex (8Abenhaim L. Moride Y. Brenot F. Rich S. Benichou J. Kurz X. Higenbottam T. Oakley C. Wounters E. Aubier M. Simonneau G. Begaud B. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 335: 609-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar). The mechanism of these appetite suppressants on PASMC may involve both direct interactions with SERT and a stimulation of SERT expression (9Rothman R.B. Ayestas M.A. Dersch C.M. Baumann M.H. Circulation. 1999; 100: 869-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 10Lee S.L. Wang W.W. Fanburg B.L. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1324-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 11Eddahibi S. Adnot S. Respir. Res. 2002; 3: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).5-HT can mediate cell signaling by interacting with several subtypes of 5-HT receptors or through SERT, which transports 5-HT across the membrane using a Na+/Cl− gradient. In bovine PASMC, only one 5-HT receptor has been identified, which resembles the 5-HT1A or 5-HT4 receptor (12Lee S.L. Fanburg B.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 150: 396-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 13Becker B.N. Gettys T.W. Middleton J.P. Olsen C.L. Albers F.J. Lee S.L. Fanburg B.L. Raymond J.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 817-825PubMed Google Scholar). However, mitogenic and hypertrophic responses by 5-HT are believed to be due to the action of SERT (14Lee S.L. Wang W.W. Lanzillo J.J. Fanburg B.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: L46-L52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of 5-HT signaling for PASMC growth through SERT has been shown to involve tyrosine phosphorylation of GTPase-activating protein (15Lee S.L. Wang W.W. Fanburg B.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C223-C230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide (16Lee S.L. Wang W.W. Fanburg B.L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 855-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and H2O2 (17Lee S.L. Simon A.R. Wang W.W. Fanburg B.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: L646-L652PubMed Google Scholar), presumably via the activation of NAD(P)H oxidase. These signaling events appear to activate the MEK-ERK pathway as PD98059 blocked the 5-HT-induced PASMC growth (18Lee S.L. Wang W.W. Finlay G.A. Fanburg B.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: L282-L291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, downstream signaling components, which are activated by ERK for the 5-HT-mediated induction of cell growth, have not yet been identified.The GATA family of transcription factors includes six genes with a highly conserved zinc finger DNA binding domain that interacts with DNA regulatory elements containing consensus (A/T)GATA(A/G) sequence. The GATA-1/2/3 genes are essential for hematopoietic cell development (19Simon M.C. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 9-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), whereas the GATA-4/5/6 subfamily members are expressed in cells of the cardiovascular system and endoderm-derived tissues (20Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38949-38952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). In aortic smooth muscle cells, GATA-6 has been shown to play a role in maintaining cells in a quiescent state, and mitogens down-regulate GATA-6 to induce proliferation of cells (21Suzuki E. Evans T. Lowry J. Truong L. Bell D.W. Testa J.R. Walsh K. Genomics. 1996; 38: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The mechanism appears to involve p21Cip1, because the adenovirus-mediated overexpression of GATA-6 was found to inhibit cellular entry into S-phase by inducing this cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (22Perlman H. Suzuki E. Simonson M. Smith R.C. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13713-13718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Furthermore, reversal of GATA-6 down-regulation in rats inhibited intimal hyperplasia in the balloon-injured carotid artery (23Mano T. Luo Z. Malendowicz S.L. Evans T. Walsh K. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).The present study, therefore, tested the hypothesis that 5-HT may down-regulate GATA-6 in PASMC. Surprisingly, however, our results show that PASMC express GATA-4 that is activated by 5-HT and enhances PASMC growth.DISCUSSION5-HT plays an important role in the development of pulmonary hypertension, in part due to its ability to induce PASMC growth (1Lee S.L. Wang W.W. Fanburg B.L. Circ. Res. 1991; 68: 1362-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The 5-HT signaling has been identified to involve 5-HT transport through SERT, tyrosine phosphorylation of GTPase-activating protein, which may in turn activate Ras-NAD(P)H oxidase and result in production of ROS and the activation of MEK and ERK (14Lee S.L. Wang W.W. Lanzillo J.J. Fanburg B.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: L46-L52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Lee S.L. Wang W.W. Fanburg B.L. Am. J.

Physiol. 1999; 277: L282-L291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There is little known about transcription factor activation by 5-HT. In skeletal muscle myoblasts, 5-HT has been shown to activate 5-HT2A receptor to stimulate the Jak-STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) pathway (31Guillet-Deniau I. Burnol A.F. Girard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14825-14829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and 5-HT-dependent collagenase transcription in myometrial cells requires an AP-1 site (32Wilcox C.B. Weisberg E. Dumin J.A. Wilcox B.D. Jeffrey J.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2000; 170: 41-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Similarly, 5-HT-inducible interleukin-1 transcription in uterine smooth muscle utilizes an AP-1 site (33Huang T.T. Vinci J.M. Lan L. Jeffrey J.J. Wilcox B.D. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 152: 21-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In the present study, we considered the mechanism identified by Walsh and co-workers for aortic smooth muscle cell proliferation, which involves the down-regulation of GATA-6 (21Suzuki E. Evans T. Lowry J. Truong L. Bell D.W. Testa J.R. Walsh K. Genomics. 1996; 38: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar,22Perlman H. Suzuki E. Simonson M. Smith R.C. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13713-13718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Thus, we initially hypothesized that 5-HT down-regulates GATA-6 in PASMC. Surprisingly, we found that 5-HT increased the GATA DNA binding activity in PASMC and that these cells also express GATA-4 transcription factor that is regulated by 5-HT signal transduction. Thus, GATA factors may respond differently in systemic and pulmonary smooth muscle cell regulation.Important GATA-binding sites have been identified in multiple cardiac-specific transcriptional regulatory regions, and overexpression of GATA-4 has been shown to transactivate these elements. A number of proteins that have been shown to be up-regulated during cardiac hypertrophy such as angiotensin II type 1a receptor, α-myosin heavy chain, औ-myosin heavy chain, myosin light chains, atrial natriuretic factor, and brain natriuretic factor contain GATA regulatory sites in their promoters (20Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38949-38952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Thus, GATA-4 has been postulated to regulate cardiac muscle cell hypertrophy. GATA-4 can be activated by a signal transduction pathway involving calcineurin and NFAT3 (34Molkentin J.D. Lu J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2191) Google Scholar). More recently, GATA-4 has shown also to be phosphorylated via the MEK/ERK pathway in response to ET-1 (27Kitta K. Clément S.A. Remeika J. Blumberg J.B. Suzuki Y.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) or phenylephrine (28Morimoto T. Hasegawa K. Kaburagi S. Kakita T. Wada H. Yanazume T. Sasayama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13721-13726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) in cardiac myocytes. Serine 105, the preferential ERK phosphorylation site, was identified to be phosphorylated in response to phenylephrine (25Liang Q. Wiese R.J. Bueno O.F. Dai Y.S. Markham B.E. Molkentin J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7460-7469Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, 5-HT-mediated activation of GATA-4 in PASMC requires MEK/ERK-dependent phosphorylation of serine 105 because MEK inhibitors blocked 5-HT-induced GATA activation, and the substitution of the ERK phosphorylation site serine 105 with alanine abolished the activation. This novel regulation for GATA-4 in PASMC, however, does not necessarily preclude a role of GATA-6 in mitogenesis as described in other vascular beds (21Suzuki E. Evans T. Lowry J. Truong L. Bell D.W. Testa J.R. Walsh K. Genomics. 1996; 38: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar).Functional roles of GATA-4 activation by 5-HT may include the regulation of PASMC proliferation. GATA elements have been found in promoter regions of cell growth-regulating proteins such as cyclin D2 (30Jun D.Y. Kim M.K. Kim I.G. Kim Y.H. Mol. Cell. 1997; 7: 537-543Google Scholar) and cyclin D3 (35Wang Z. Sicinski P. Weinberg R.A. Zhang Y. Ravid K. Genomics. 1996; 35: 156-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Tanaka et al. (36Tanaka H. Matsumura I. Nakajima K. Daino H. Sonoyama J. Yoshida H. Oritani K. Machii T. Yamamoto M. Hirano T. Kanakura Y. Blood. 2000; 95: 1264-1273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) report that GATA-1 induced the sustained expression of cyclin D1 in a murine myeloid cell line M1. GATA-1 has also been shown to regulate the proliferation of definitive erythroid and megakaryocytic cells (37Takahashi S. Komeno T. Suwabe N. Yoh K. Nakajima O. Nishimura S. Kuroha T. Nagasawa T. Yamamoto M. Blood. 1998; 92: 434-442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tsai and Orkin (38Tsai F.Y. Orkin S.H. Blood. 1997; 89: 3636-3643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) report that GATA-2 is required for the proliferation of hematopoietic cells. Results from the present study showing that the specific suppression of GATA-4 activity by a dominant negative mutant decreased the cell number and down-regulated the expression of cyclin D2 indicate that GATA-4 regulates mitogenesis of PASMC. Furthermore, other mitogens of PASMC such as ET-1 and PDGF also activate GATA DNA binding activity, suggesting that GATA-4 may be a universal mediator of PASMC proliferation.Another possible role of GATA-4 activation is to regulate cell apoptosis and survival. In cardiac myocytes, GATA-4 was recently identified as a cell survival factor, and down-regulation of this transcription factor resulted in the induction of apoptosis (39Kim Y. Ma A.-G. Kitta K. Fitch S.N. Ikeda T. Ihara Y. Simon A.R. Evans T. Suzuki Y.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 368-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar,40Kitta K. Day R.M. Kim Y. Torregroza I. Evans T. Suzuki Y.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4705-4712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Consistently, we found that 5-HT inhibited apoptosis of PASMC (41Suzuki Y.J. Fanburg B.L. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2003; 167 (abstr.) in pressCrossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar).In summary, the present study demonstrates that PASMC express GATA-4 that is activated by 5-HT. From the data we have obtained, the 5-HT signal transduction for GATA-4 activation appears to involve the SERT, ROS, MEK/ERK pathway and the phosphorylation of serine 105, the preferential ERK phosphorylation site within the GATA-4 molecule (Fig.7). Furthermore, adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of dominant negative GATA-4 mutants indicates that GATA-4 regulates the expression of cyclin D2 and PASMC growth. These results suggest that GATA-4 may play a role in 5-HT-induced PASMC growth and that this cascade of events may participate in the development of pulmonary hypertension. Thus, therapeutic strategies targeting GATA-4 may be useful against pulmonary hypertension. Exposure to chronic hypoxia leads to the development of pulmonary hypertension through persistent vasoconstriction as well as structural remodeling of pulmonary vessels. Proliferation of smooth muscle cells is an important component of pulmonary vascular remodeling that results in increased medial muscular wall thickness. Among a number of mediators of pulmonary hypertension, serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)1) appears to play an important role in the remodeling of the pulmonary circulation (1Lee S.L. Wang W.W. Fanburg B.L. Circ. Res. 1991; 68: 1362-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 2Eddahibi S. Raffestin B. Pham I. Launay J.M. Aegerter P. Sitbon M. Adnot S. Am. J.

Invest. 2000; 105: 1555-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Evidence for the role of 5-HT in the development of pulmonary hypertension was first recognized in fawn-hooded rats, in which a genetic deficit in 5-HT platelet storage and high plasma levels of 5-HT are associated with a susceptibility to developing pulmonary hypertension in response to mild hypoxia (4Sato K. Webb S. Tucker A. Rabinovitch M. Obrien R.F. McMurtry I.F. Stelzne T.J. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1992; 145: 793-797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A further study showed that a continuous intravenous infusion of 5-HT during a 2-week exposure of rats to hypoxia potentiated the development of pulmonary hypertension (2Eddahibi S. Raffestin B. Pham I. Launay J.M. Aegerter P. Sitbon M. Adnot S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H1173-H1181PubMed Google Scholar). The role of 5-HT in pulmonary hypertension appears to be through the serotonin transporter (SERT), as mice deficient for SERT developed less hypoxic pulmonary hypertension and vascular remodeling than did control animals exposed to the same conditions (3Eddahibi S. Hanoun N. Lanfumey L. Lesch K.P. Raffestin B. Hamon M. Adnot S. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1555-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). High levels of plasma 5-HT have been observed in humans in association with primary pulmonary hypertension (5Herve P. Drouet L. Dosquet C. Launay J.M. Rain B. Simonneau L. Caen J. Duroux P. Am. J. Med. 1990; 89: 117-120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 6Herve P. Launay J.M. Scrobohaci M.L. Brenot F. Simonneau G. Petitpretz P. Poubeau P. Cerrina J. Duroux P. Drouet L.

Dartevelle P. Hamon M. Adnot S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 198: 1141-1150Crossref Scopus (488) Google Scholar) report that pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMC) from patients with primary pulmonary hypertension grow faster than the cells from control subjects due to increased expression of SERT. The importance of 5-HT in human pulmonary hypertension is supported by clinical observations that pulmonary hypertension is associated with the use of amphetamine-like appetite suppressants, fenfluramine, dexfenfluramine, and aminorex (8Abenhaim L. Moride Y. Brenot F. Rich S. Benichou J. Kurz X. Higenbottam T. Oakley C. Wounters E. Aubier M. Simonneau G. Begaud B. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 335: 609-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar). The mechanism of these appetite suppressants on PASMC may involve both direct interactions with SERT and a stimulation of SERT expression (9Rothman R.B. Ayestas M.A. Dersch C.M. Baumann M.H. Circulation. 1999; 100: 869-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 10Lee S.L. Wang W.W. Fanburg B.L. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1324-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 11Eddahibi S. Adnot S. Respir. Res. 2002; 3: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). 5-HT can mediate cell signaling by interacting with several subtypes of 5-HT receptors or through SERT, which transports 5-HT across the membrane using a Na+/Cl− gradient. In bovine PASMC, only one 5-HT receptor has been identified, which resembles the 5-HT1A or 5-HT4 receptor (12Lee S.L. Fanburg B.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 150: 396-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 13Becker B.N. Gettys T.W. Middleton J.P. Olsen C.L. Albers F.J. Lee S.L. Fanburg B.L. Raymond J.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 817-825PubMed Google Scholar). However, mitogenic and hypertrophic responses by 5-HT are believed to be due to the action of SERT (14Lee S.L. Wang W.W. Lanzillo J.J. Fanburg B.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: L46-L52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of 5-HT signaling for PASMC growth through SERT has been shown to involve tyrosine phosphorylation of GTPase-activating protein (15Lee S.L. Wang W.W. Fanburg B.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C223-C230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide (16Lee S.L. Wang W.W. Fanburg B.L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 855-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and H2O2 (17Lee S.L. Simon A.R. Wang W.W. Fanburg B.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: L646-L652PubMed Google Scholar), presumably via the activation of NAD(P)H oxidase. These signaling events appear to activate the MEK-ERK pathway as PD98059 blocked the 5-HT-induced PASMC growth (18Lee S.L. Wang W.W. Finlay G.A. Fanburg B.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: L282-L291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, downstream signaling components, which are activated by ERK for the 5-HT-mediated induction of cell growth, have not yet been identified. The GATA family of transcription factors includes six genes with a highly conserved zinc finger DNA binding domain that interacts with DNA regulatory elements containing consensus (A/T)GATA(A/G) sequence. The GATA-1/2/3 genes are essential for hematopoietic cell development (19Simon M.C. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 9-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), whereas the GATA-4/5/6 subfamily members are expressed in cells of the cardiovascular system and endoderm-derived tissues (20Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38949-38952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). In aortic smooth muscle cells, GATA-6 has been shown to play a role in maintaining cells in a quiescent state, and mitogens down-regulate GATA-6 to induce proliferation of cells (21Suzuki E. Evans T. Lowry J. Truong L. Bell D.W. Testa J.R. Walsh K. Genomics. 1996; 38: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The mechanism appears to involve p21Cip1, because the adenovirus-mediated overexpression of GATA-6 was found to inhibit cellular entry into S-phase by inducing this cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (22Perlman H. Suzuki E. Simonson M. Smith R.C. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13713-13718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Furthermore, reversal of GATA-6 down-regulation in rats inhibited intimal hyperplasia in the balloon-injured carotid artery (23Mano T. Luo Z. Malendowicz S.L. Evans T. Walsh K. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The present study, therefore, tested the hypothesis that 5-HT may down-regulate GATA-6 in PASMC. Surprisingly, however, our results show that PASMC express GATA-4 that is activated by 5-HT and enhances PASMC growth. DISCUSSION5-HT plays an important role in the development of pulmonary hypertension, in part due to its ability to induce PASMC growth (1Lee S.L. Wang W.W. Fanburg B.L. Circ. Res. 1991; 68: 1362-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The 5-HT signaling has been identified to involve 5-HT transport through SERT, tyrosine phosphorylation of GTPase-activating protein, which may in turn activate Ras-NAD(P)H oxidase and result in production of ROS and the activation of MEK and ERK (14Lee S.L. Wang W.W. Lanzillo J.J. Fanburg B.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: L46-L52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Lee S.L. Wang W.W. Fanburg B.L. Am. J.

Physiol. 1999; 277: L282-L291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There is little known about transcription factor activation by 5-HT. In skeletal muscle myoblasts, 5-HT has been shown to activate 5-HT2A receptor to stimulate the Jak-STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) pathway (31Guillet-Deniau I. Burnol A.F. Girard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14825-14829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and 5-HT-dependent collagenase transcription in myometrial cells requires an AP-1 site (32Wilcox C.B. Weisberg E. Dumin J.A. Wilcox B.D. Jeffrey J.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2000; 170: 41-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Similarly, 5-HT-inducible interleukin-1 transcription in uterine smooth muscle utilizes an AP-1 site (33Huang T.T. Vinci J.M. Lan L. Jeffrey J.J. Wilcox B.D. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 152: 21-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In the present study, we considered the mechanism identified by Walsh and co-workers for aortic smooth muscle cell proliferation, which involves the down-regulation of GATA-6 (21Suzuki E. Evans T. Lowry J. Truong L. Bell D.W. Testa J.R. Walsh K. Genomics. 1996; 38: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar,22Perlman H. Suzuki E. Simonson M. Smith R.C. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13713-13718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Thus, we initially hypothesized that 5-HT down-regulates GATA-6 in PASMC. Surprisingly, we found that 5-HT increased the GATA DNA binding activity in PASMC and that these cells also express GATA-4 transcription factor that is regulated by 5-HT signal transduction. Thus, GATA factors may respond differently in systemic and pulmonary smooth muscle cell regulation.Important GATA-binding sites have been identified in multiple cardiac-specific transcriptional regulatory regions, and overexpression of GATA-4 has been shown to transactivate these elements. A number of proteins that have been shown to be up-regulated during cardiac hypertrophy such as angiotensin II type 1a receptor, α-myosin heavy chain, औ-myosin heavy chain, myosin light chains, atrial natriuretic factor, and brain natriuretic factor contain GATA regulatory sites in their promoters (20Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38949-38952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Thus, GATA-4 has been postulated to regulate cardiac muscle cell hypertrophy. GATA-4 can be activated by a signal transduction pathway involving calcineurin and NFAT3 (34Molkentin J.D. Lu J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2191) Google Scholar). More recently, GATA-4 has shown also to be phosphorylated via the MEK/ERK pathway in response to ET-1 (27Kitta K. Clément S.A. Remeika J. Blumberg J.B. Suzuki Y.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) or phenylephrine (28Morimoto T. Hasegawa K. Kaburagi S. Kakita T. Wada H. Yanazume T. Sasayama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13721-13726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) in cardiac myocytes. Serine 105, the preferential ERK phosphorylation site, was identified to be phosphorylated in response to phenylephrine (25Liang Q. Wiese R.J. Bueno O.F. Dai Y.S. Markham B.E. Molkentin J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7460-7469Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar).

Results from the present study showing that the specific suppression of GATA-4 activity by a dominant negative mutant decreased the cell number and down-regulated the expression of cyclin D2 indicate that GATA-4 regulates mitogenesis of PASMC. Furthermore, other mitogens of PASMC such as ET-1 and PDGF also activate GATA DNA binding activity, suggesting that GATA-4 may be a universal mediator of PASMC proliferation. Another possible role of GATA-4 activation is to regulate cell apoptosis and survival. In cardiac myocytes, GATA-4 was recently identified as a cell survival factor, and down-regulation of this transcription factor resulted in the induction of apoptosis (39Kim Y. Ma A.-G. Kitta K.

J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2003; 167 (abstr.) in pressCrossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In summary, the present study demonstrates that PASMC express GATA-4 that is activated by 5-HT. From the data we have obtained, the 5-HT signal transduction for GATA-4 activation appears to involve the SERT, ROS, MEK/ERK pathway and the phosphorylation of serine 105, the preferential ERK phosphorylation site within the GATA-4 molecule (Fig.7). Furthermore, adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of dominant negative GATA-4 mutants indicates that GATA-4 regulates the expression of cyclin D2 and PASMC growth. These results suggest that GATA-4 may play a role in 5-HT-induced PASMC growth and that this cascade of events may participate in the development of pulmonary hypertension. Thus, therapeutic strategies targeting GATA-4 may be useful against pulmonary hypertension. We thank S. Fitch, Y. Kim, and J. Guo for excellent technical assistance."

HB-EGF is synthesized as a membrane-anchored form (pro-HB-EGF), and pro-HB-EGF is cleaved at the cell surface to yield soluble HB-EGF by a mechanism called “ectodomain shedding.” We show here that the ectodomain shedding of pro-HB-EGF in Vero cells is induced by various stress-inducing stimuli, including UV light, osmotic pressure, hyperoxidation, and translation inhibitors. The pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1औ also stimulated the ectodomain shedding of pro-HB-EGF. An inhibitor of p38 MAPK (SB203580) or the expression of a dominant-negative (dn) form of p38 MAPK inhibited the stress-induced ectodomain shedding of pro-HB-EGF, whereas an inhibitor of JNK (SP600125) or the expression of dnJNK1 did not. 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) are also potent inducers of pro-HB-EGF shedding in Vero cells. Stress-induced pro-HB-EGF shedding was not inhibited by the inhibitors of TPA- or LPA-induced pro-HB-EGF shedding or by dn forms of molecules involved in the TPA- or LPA-induced pro-HB-EGF shedding pathway.

HB-EGF, synthesized as a membrane-anchored precursor protein (pro-HB-EGF) of 208 amino acids, is composed of a signal peptide, a heparin-binding domain, an EGF-like region, a juxtamembrane domain, a transmembrane segment, and a cytoplasmic tail (3Higashiyama S. Lau K. Besner G.E. Abraham J.A. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6205-6212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pro-HB-EGF is cleaved at the cell surface within the juxtamembrane domain through a process called ectodomain shedding, which results in secretion of a soluble 75–86-amino acid growth factor (sHB-EGF) (15Goishi K. Higashiyama S. Klagsbrun M. Nakano N. Umata T. Ishikawa M. Mekada E. Taniguchi N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 967-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Although the regulated process of pro-HB-EGF ectodomain shedding yields substantial sHB-EGF, a considerable amount remains uncleaved at the cell surface. In addition to being a precursor of sHB-EGF, pro-HB-EGF is a biologically active molecule, forming a complex with both CD9 (16Mitamura T. Iwamoto R. Umata T. Yomo T. Urabe I. Tsuneoka M. Mekada E. J.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F179-F199PubMed Google Scholar), pro-HB-EGF negatively regulates cell proliferation (19Iwamoto R. Handa K. Mekada E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25906-25912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). These results suggest that strict control of pro-HB-EGF ectodomain shedding is critical for the proper regulation of the activity of this growth factor. Pro-HB-EGF ectodomain shedding is induced by both physiological and pharmacological agonists such as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). TPA, an activator of protein kinase C (PKC), potently induces the ectodomain shedding of pro-HB-EGF (15Goishi K. Higashiyama S. Klagsbrun M. Nakano N. Umata T. Ishikawa M. Mekada E. Taniguchi N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 967-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) and of other membrane proteins (20Arribas J. Coodly L. Vollmer P. Kishimoto T.K. Rose-John S. Massagué J. J. Biol.

In monkey kidney Vero cells, the presence of a constitutively active form of PKCδ results in the ectodomain shedding of pro-HB-EGF, and dominant-negative (dn) PKCδ suppresses TPA-induced shedding, suggesting that the PKCδ isoform contributes to the ectodomain shedding of pro-HB-EGF. PKCδ binds to the cytoplasmic domain of ADAM9/MDC9/meltrin-γ (21Izumi Y. Hirata M. Hasuwa H. Iwamoto R. Umata T. Miyado K. Tamai Y. Kurisaki T. Sehara-Fujisawa A. Ohno S. Mekada E.

Blobel C.P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Overexpression of ADAM9 induces pro-HB-EGF shedding, which can be inhibited by the expression of the dnADAM9 mutant H347A,H351A in Vero-H cells. Thus, ADAM9 is thought to act downstream of PKCδ in the pro-HB-EGF shedding pathway (21Izumi Y. Hirata M. Hasuwa H. Iwamoto R. Umata T. Miyado K. Tamai Y. Kurisaki T. Sehara-Fujisawa A. Ohno S. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7260-7272Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), although the role of this protease in the direct cleavage of pro-HB-EGF remains unclear. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and other ligands of the seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors also stimulate pro-HB-EGF shedding (23Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar, 24Hirata M. Umata T. Takahashi T. Ohnuma M. Miura Y. Iwamoto R. Mekada E. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The activation of shedding by such ligands is crucial for the transactivation of the EGF receptor by G protein-coupled receptor ligands (23Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R.

In Vero cells, the Ras-Raf-MEK and Rac signaling pathways are activated in LPA-induced shedding (27Umata T. Hirata M. Takahashi T. Ryu F. Shida S. Takahashi Y. Tsuneoka M. Miura Y. Masuda M. Horiguchi Y. Mekada E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30475-30482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). LPA-induced shedding is inhibited by dnHa-Ras, dnRac1, and the MEK inhibitor PD98059, but not by either dnPKCδ or dnADAM9. Conversely, although TPA-induced shedding is inhibited by dnPKCδ and dnADAM9, such shedding is not affected by dnHa-Ras, dnRac1, and the MEK inhibitor. These results indicate that two distinct signaling pathways function to regulate pro-HB-EGF ectodomain shedding, here designated the LPA- and TPA-induced pathways. Pro-HB-EGF expression is enhanced in various tissues upon injury and inflammation (28Blotnick S. Peoples G.E. Freeman M.R. Eberlein T.J. Klagsbrun M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The induction of this cellular response under these conditions suggests that HB-EGF is involved in both physiological tissue repair, including processes such as wound healing, and pathological processes, including atherosclerosis, that follow from inappropriate inflammation. Cellular stress and inflammation may function as triggers of ectodomain shedding. It remains unclear, however, if inflammatory cytokines and stimuli inducing cellular stress responses can trigger pro-HB-EGF ectodomain shedding. We demonstrate here that various stress-inducing stimuli and inflammatory cytokines strongly induce ectodomain shedding, acting through a p38 MAPK-mediated pathway, distinct from both the TPA- and LPA-induced signaling pathways. Our results suggest that HB-EGF activity is regulated at the transcriptional level and by ectodomain shedding, which responds to stress and inflammation.

Using Vero-H cells, we examined the effect of pro-inflammatory cytokines and stress-inducing stimuli on the induction of pro-HB-EGF ectodomain shedding. First, we examined the ectodomain shedding of pro-HB-EGF by immunofluorescence microscopy using an antibody specific for the pro-HB-EGF ectodomain. Vero-H cells were pretreated with the indicated stimuli and then cultured for 30 min. Cells were treated with anti-HB-EGF neutralizing antibody and then fixed and visualized using a secondary antibody. Pro-HB-EGF fluorescence at the cell surface disappeared following addition of either LPA (20 ॖg/ml) or TPA (64 nm) to the culture medium (Fig. 1A) (21Izumi Y. Hirata M. Hasuwa H. Iwamoto R. Umata T.

In addition, the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1औ (4 ॖg/ml) also led to the disappearance of pro-HB-EGF surface immunofluorescence. Moreover, stimuli well known to induce a cellular stress response (42Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (2877) Google Scholar), such as translation inhibitors (anisomycin, 10 ॖg/ml) (43Cano E. Hazzalin C.A. Mahadevan L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7352-7362Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), exposure to UV light (40 mJ/cm2), hypertonic osmotic pressure (sorbitol, 0.4 m), or oxidative stress (H2O2, 0.5 mm), also induced the disappearance of pro-HB-EGF immunofluorescence from the cell surface. Western blot analysis confirmed the ectodomain shedding of pro-HB-EGF in Vero-H cells (Fig. 1B). Immunoblot analysis of Vero-H cell lysates (upper panel) and the culture medium (lower panel) following incubation with the indicated stimuli detected the cytoplasmic domain of pro-HB-EGF and the shed soluble EGF-like domain, respectively. In cell lysates, bands ranging from 20 to 30 kDa correspond to pro-HB-EGF, whereas bands between 17.4 and 6.9 kDa are proteolytic fragments composed of the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of pro-HB-EGF (referred to as the “tail fragment”). Consistent with the appearance of the tail fragment, sHB-EGF appeared concurrently in the culture medium. These results indicate that IL-1औ, anisomycin, UV light, and sorbitol, in addition to LPA and TPA, induce pro-HB-EGF cleavage to generate both the tail fragment in cell lysates and sHB-EGF in the culture medium. Although H2O2 generated the tail fragment in cell lysates and sHB-EGF in the culture medium, this stimulus also reduced the total pro-HB-EGF protein present through an unknown mechanism. Centrifuging as a mimic of shearing stress also induced pro-HB-EGF ectodomain shedding (data not shown). In contrast, the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 did not affect shedding. Rather, these cytokines reduced the total pro-HB-EGF protein, although the reduced level varied depending on the experiments. We also examined the time course of pro-HB-EGF shedding induced by IL-1औ, anisomycin, UV light, and sorbitol. As the appearance of sHB-EGF in the culture medium correlated well with the appearance of the tail fragment in the cell lysate (Fig. 1B) (27Umata T. Hirata M. Takahashi T. Ryu F. Shida S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 30475-30482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), we utilized Western blot analysis only for the cell lysates to examine this event. As shown in Fig. 2, ectodomain shedding was observed following treatment with each of these stress stimuli at a time course similar to that observed for TPA-induced shedding (15Goishi K.

Signals from pro-inflammatory cytokines and cellular responses to stress are generally mediated by SAPKs (42Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (2877) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that stress-induced pro-HB-EGF shedding is mediated by a SAPK family kinase. We examined the activation of p38 MAPK and the various JNKs, major members of the SAPK family, following stress-inducing stimulation of Vero-H cells. After treatment with LPA, TPA, IL-1औ, anisomycin, UV irradiation, or sorbitol, Vero-H cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting with either anti-phospho-p38 MAPK or anti-phospho-JNK antibody to monitor kinase phosphorylation status. Phosphorylated p38 MAPK was strongly observed after treatment with anisomycin, UV light, or sorbitol, with moderate increases in phosphorylation following treatment with either TPA or IL-1औ. SB203580, an inhibitor of p38 MAPK (44Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Strickler J.E. McLaughlin M.M.

Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3133) Google Scholar), significantly reduced p38 MAPK activity at a concentration of 2 ॖm (Fig.3A). JNK1/2 and p38 MAPK were activated by treatment with LPA, TPA, IL-1औ, anisomycin, UV light, and sorbitol, although 2 ॖm SB203580 could not inhibit JNK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 3B). The results confirm that SB203580 specifically inhibits p38 MAPK activation. TNF-α and IL-6 could not activate either p38 MAPK (Fig. 3A) or JNK (Fig.3B) in Vero-H cells, concurring with a lack of pro-HB-EGF cleavage (Fig. 1B). We next inspected the SB203580 inhibition of pro-HB-EGF ectodomain shedding induction by IL-1औ, anisomycin, UV light, or sorbitol to verify the involvement of p38 MAPK. 2 ॖm SB203580 drastically inhibited the stress-induced shedding caused by IL-1औ, anisomycin, UV light, or sorbitol (Fig. 3C), whereas TPA- and LPA-induced shedding was not affected. Even concentrations of SB203580 in excess of 10 ॖm could not inhibit TPA- and LPA-induced shedding (data not shown). These results suggest that pro-HB-EGF ectodomain shedding induced by IL-1औ, anisomycin, UV light, or sorbitol requires p38 MAPK activation. We examined the requirement for p38 MAPK in stress-induced pro-HB-EGF shedding using dnp38 MAPK. Following the transfection of FLAG-tagged dnp38 MAPK, cells were treated with various stimuli and then double-stained for pro-HB-EGF and dnp38 MAPK. Although treatment with IL-1औ, anisomycin, UV light, or sorbitol enhanced pro-HB-EGF shedding in vector-transfected cells (Fig.4B), shedding was inhibited in FLAG-positive cells expressing dnp38 MAPK (Fig. 4, A andB). We confirmed that LPA- and TPA-induced pro-HB-EGF ectodomain shedding was not inhibited by dnp38 MAPK (Fig.4B). MKK6 is a specific activator of p38 MAPK (45Han J. Lee J.D. Jiang Y. Li Z. Feng L. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2886-2891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Consistent with the role of the p38 MAPK pathway in shedding, transfection of a constitutively active form of MKK6 resulted in pro-HB-EGF ectodomain shedding in the absence of stress-inducing stimuli in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.5). These results indicate that p38 MAPK activation is required for stress-induced pro-HB-EGF shedding in Vero-H cells.Figure 5Enhanced ectodomain shedding by a constitutively active form of MKK6.

Step 1 is the reaction of ligase with ATP to form a covalent ligase-(lysyl-N)-AMP intermediate and pyrophosphate. In step 2, the AMP is transferred from ligase-adenylate to the 5′-PO4 RNA end to form an RNA-adenylate intermediate (AppRNA). In step 3, attack by an RNA 3′-OH on the RNA-adenylate seals the two ends via a phosphodiester bond and releases AMP. Bacteriophage T4 RNA ligase 1 (Rnl1) is the founding member of the RNA ligase family (1Silber R. Malathi V.G. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 3009-3013Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The active site lysine of Rnl1 is located within a conserved sequence element, KX(D/N)G (motif I), that defines a superfamily of covalent nucleotidyl transferases, which includes DNA ligases and mRNA capping enzymes (6Thogerson H.C. Morris H.R. Rand K.N. Gait M.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 147: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 7Heaphy S. Singh M. Gait M.J.

DNA ligases and capping enzymes share a common tertiary structure composed of five conserved motifs (I, III, IIIa, IV, and V) that contain amino acid side chains responsible for nucleotide binding and catalysis (9Subramanya H.S. Doherty A.J. Ashford S.R. Wigley D.B. Cell. 1996; 85: 607-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 10Håkansson K. Doherty A.J. Shuman S. Wigley D.B.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1119-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) (Fig.1). It has been suggested that DNA ligases and capping enzymes evolved from a common ancestral nucleotidyl transferase, possibly from an ancient RNA strand-joining enzyme. Yet, the structural basis for catalysis by RNA ligases remains ill-defined because few RNA ligase enzymes have been studied, and there is scant mutational analysis available outside of the KX(D/N)G motif. We recently identified and characterized a second T4 RNA ligase (Rnl2) encoded by T4 gene 24.1. Purified Rnl2 catalyzes intramolecular circularization and intermolecular dimerization of single-stranded RNA through ligase-adenylate and RNA-adenylate intermediates (13Ho C.K. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12709-12714Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Rnl2 exemplifies a distinct subfamily of RNA ligases defined by variant nucleotidyl transferase motifs that includes the RNA-editing ligases ofTrypanosoma and Leishmania, putative RNA ligases encoded by eukaryotic viruses (baculoviruses and an entomopoxvirus), and putative RNA ligases encoded by many species of archaea (13Ho C.K.

Biol. 2001; 21: 979-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Thus, the Rnl2-like ligases are present in all three phylogenetic domains. T4 RNA ligase 1 exemplifies a separate subfamily of RNA ligases with a narrower phylogenetic distribution. Alignment of the primary structures of several of the Rnl2-like ligases highlights two notable features: (i) a defining variant of motif I, EKX(H/D)XN, and (ii) the presence of putative counterparts of nucleotidyl transferase motifs III, IIIa, IV, and V found in DNA ligases and capping enzymes (Fig. 1). To understand the structural requirements for catalysis by the Rnl2-like ligases, we initiated an alanine-scanning mutational analysis of selected residues in the nucleotidyl transferase motifs of Rnl2 (13Ho C.K. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12709-12714Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). We showed that Lys35 in motif I, Glu204 in motif IV, and Lys225 and Lys227 in motif V are required for overall strand joining and particularly for the enzyme adenylation reaction (step 1) of the ligation pathway. His37 in motif I is not required for ligase adenylation but plays a critical role downstream of step 1. These initial results suggested that the partial reactions of the RNA ligation pathway may be catalyzed by distinct constellations of active site residues. To further delineate which of the conserved side chains of the nucleotidyl transferase motifs are functionally relevant, we have extended the mutational analysis of T4 Rnl2, focusing on residues in motifs I, III, IIIa, IV, and V (indicated by ● in Fig. 1). We identified individual amino acids that are required for strand joining, determined structure-activity relationships via conservative substitutions, and then stratified the mutational effects on the isolated steps of ligase adenylylation (step 1) and phosphodiester formation (step 3). We find that all five motifs are essential for covalent nucleotidyl transfer by Rnl2, as they are for DNA ligases and capping enzymes, and we locate essential structural “signatures” that are unique to Rnl2-like ligases. Amino acid substitution mutations were introduced into the rnl2 gene by PCR using the two-stage overlap extension method as described previously (13Ho C.K. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12709-12714Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The PCR products were digested with NdeI and BamHI and inserted into pET16b (Novagen). The inserts of the mutant pET-RNL2 plasmids were sequenced completely to exclude the acquisition of unwanted changes during amplification and cloning. pET-RNL2 plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). Induction of Rnl2 production with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and purification of Rnl2 from soluble bacterial extracts by nickel-agarose chromatography were performed as described previously (13Ho C.K. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12709-12714Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The wild-type and mutant Rnl2 preparations were stored at −80 °C. Reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 50 mm Tris acetate (pH 6.5), 5 mmDTT,1 1 mmMgCl2, 20 μm [α-32P]ATP, and Rnl2 as specified were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. The reactions were quenched with SDS, and the products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The ligase-[32P]AMP adduct was visualized by autoradiography of the dried gel and quantitated by scanning the gel with a PhosphorImager. An 18-mer oligoribonucleotide was 5′32P-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP and then purified by electrophoresis through a nondenaturing 18% polyacrylamide gel. To form the two-piece stem-loop substrate (see Fig. 2), 100 pmol of the gel-purified32P-labeled 18-mer strand was mixed with 500 pmol of a partially complementary 15-mer RNA in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA. The mixture was heated at 60 °C for 10 min, shifted to 37 °C for 15 min, and then cooled slowly to 22 °C. RNA ligation reaction mixtures (10 μl) containing 50 mm Tris acetate (pH 6.5), 5 mm DTT, 1 or 2 mmMgCl2, 1 pmol of 5′ 32P-labeled RNA, and ATP and Rnl2 as specified were incubated for 15 min at 22 °C. The reactions were quenched by adding 5 μl of 90% formamide, 20 mm EDTA. The samples were analyzed by electrophoresis through an 18% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea in 45 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA. The ligation products were visualized by autoradiography. 2 nmol of32P-labeled 18-mer RNA was incubated with 50 μg of purified Rnl2 in the presence of 1 mm ATP and 7.5 mm MgCl2 for 30 min at 22 °C. The products were then treated with 2.5 units of calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (Roche Applied Science) for 60 min at 37 °C. The digestion products were resolved by electrophoresis through a native 18% polyacrylamide gel in 90 mm Tris borate, 2 mm EDTA. The32P-labeled AppRNA strand was located by autoradiography of the wet gel and then eluted from an excised gel slice in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA. The two-piece stem-loop AppRNA substrate (see Fig. 4B) was formed by annealing the gel-purified 32P-labeled AppRNA strand to an unlabeled 15-mer strand at a molar ratio of 1:5. Reaction mixtures (10 μl) containing 50 mm Tris acetate (pH 6.5), 5 mmDTT, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 pmol of32P-labeled AppRNA, and Rnl2 as specified were incubated for 15 min at 22 °C. The reactions were quenched by adding 5 μl of 90% formamide and 20 mm EDTA, and the samples were analyzed by electrophoresis through a 18% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea in 45 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA. The products were visualized by autoradiography of the gel. The strand joining activity of T4 Rnl2 was demonstrated initially with a 5′ 32P-labeled single-stranded 18-mer RNA substrate. Cyclization of the 18-mer RNA was the predominant outcome of the ligation reaction rather than formation of linear multimers (13Ho C.K. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12709-12714Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The same preference for cyclization is displayed by T4 Rnl1 with substrates of similar size (3Sugino A. Snopek T.J. Cozarelli N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 252: 1732-1738Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and is construed to reflect proximity of the intramolecular 3′-OH terminus to the active site. The function of Rnl1 in vivo is to repair a break in the anticodon loop of E. coli tRNALystriggered by phage activation of a host-encoded anticodon nuclease (17Amitsur M. Levitz R. Kaufman G. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2499-2503Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar,18Kaufmann G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 70-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Thus, the physiological substrate for Rnl1 is a folded two-piece RNA molecule with the reactive ends held in proximity by the secondary structure of the tRNA. It was of interest to determine whether Rnl2 was capable of joining such a substrate or whether its action was confined to single-stranded RNAs. We constructed a two-piece substrate designed to mimic the anticodon stem and broken anticodon loop of tRNALys (17Amitsur M. Levitz R. Kaufman G. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2499-2503Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) via hybridization of a 5′32P-labeled 18-mer RNA to a complementary 15-mer RNA with 5′-OH and 3′-OH termini (Fig. 2). The broken loop of the synthetic two-piece substrate consists of a two-nucleotide single-stranded tail on one strand of the stem duplex that provides the ligatable 3′-OH and a 5′-nucleotide single strand tail on the other strand that provides the ligatable 5′-PO4end (17Amitsur M. Levitz R. Kaufman G. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2499-2503Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Reaction of this substrate with Rnl2 resulted in joining of the 5′ 32P-labeled 18-mer to the unlabeled 15-mer to form a 33-mer ligation product (Fig. 2, RNA′pRNA). Thus, Rnl2 is capable of joining ends that are brought together by secondary structure. Enzyme titration experiments showed that ligation of the stem-loop substrate occurred with efficiency comparable with circularization of an 18-mer single strand (data not shown). The yield of the two-piece ligation product was optimal between pH 6.0 and 7.0. Reducing the pH to 5.5 or 5.0 suppressed strand joining while stimulating the formation of the RNA-adenylate intermediate (Fig. 2). Similar pH effects on AppRNA accumulation were noted previously for Rnl2-mediated circularization of a single-stranded RNA substrate (13Ho C.K. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12709-12714Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). We conclude that the step of phosphodiester bond formation becomes rate-limiting at mildly acidic pH, independent of the type of RNA substrate used. Raising the pH to ≥7.5 suppressed the two-piece ligation reaction without trapping the RNA-adenylate intermediate (Fig. 2). We reported previously that the inclusion of 1 mm ATP in the strand joining reaction with a single-stranded RNA substrate promoted accumulation of AppRNA and suppressed formation of ligated circles (13Ho C.K. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12709-12714Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The explanation offered for the ATP effect is that Rnl2, like Rnl1 (3Sugino A. Snopek T.J. Cozarelli N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 252: 1732-1738Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), is prone to dissociate from the newly formed RNA-adenylate product of step 2 and that an immediate reaction of Rnl2 with ATP to form ligase-adenylate precludes it from rebinding to the RNA-adenylate for subsequent catalysis of strand joining. The experiment in Fig. 3 shows a smooth transition from circular product to AppRNA product as the ATP concentration was increased, with a midpoint at ∼10 μmATP. The ATP concentration dependence of the trapping of RNA-adenylate roughly parallels the ATP concentration dependence of ligase-adenylate formation, which is saturated at 20 μm ATP (13Ho C.K. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12709-12714Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). We considered the possibility that Rnl2 might be less prone to dissociate from the two-piece stem-loop substrate in which the 3′-OH end is tethered in the vicinity of the 5′ end, but found that inclusion of ATP in the two-piece ligation reaction had the same effect of trapping RNA-adenylate as it did with the single-stranded RNA substrate (not shown). Thus, we surmise that Rnl2 is generally liable to dissociate from the step 2 product under the reaction conditions employed. The production of high levels of RNA-adenylate by Rnl2 in the presence of ATP allowed us to synthesize and gel purify a preadenylated RNA substrate (AppRNA) for analysis of step 3 of the ligation pathway in isolation. Formation of a phosphodiester at the activated 5′ end was manifest by the appearance of a sealed circular RNA product, the yield of which was proportional to the amount of input Rnl2 (Fig.4A). More than 90% of the substrate was converted to circular RNA at saturating Rnl2 concentrations. Circularization of RNA-adenylate required a divalent cation cofactor (data not shown). A small fraction of the input AppRNA was apparently deadenylated during the reaction to yield pRNA, which migrated between RNA-adenylate substrate and the ligated circle (Fig. 4A). Deadenylation is the reverse of step 2 of the ligation pathway. Circularization of AppRNA was optimal at pH 6.0 to 7.0 and fell off sharply at a more acidic pH; activity declined gradually at alkaline pH such that the yield of circular product at pH 8.5 was ∼25% of the value at pH 7.0 (data not shown). We also prepared a preadenylated version of the two-piece stem-loop substrate. Rnl2 catalyzed efficient joining of the activated 5′ end of the labeled 18-mer to the 3′-OH of the unlabeled 15-mer to yield a 33-mer product (Fig. 4B). Again, a small fraction of the substrate was deadenylated to produce pRNA. Also, a trace amount of circular product was formed, most likely reflecting the presence of a small fraction of unhybridized 18-mer AppRNA strand in the substrate preparation. Lys35 is the site of covalent attachment of AMP to Rnl2; its replacement by alanine abolishes ligase-AMP formation and, perforce, the formation of the RNA-adenylate intermediate (13Ho C.K. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12709-12714Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). An instructive finding was that the K35A mutant of Rnl2 was capable of sealing a preadenylated two-piece stem-loop RNA substrate, albeit less efficiently than did wild-type Rnl2 (Fig. 4B). As expected, the K35A mutant was unable to deadenylate the AppRNA substrate to form the pRNA species seen in the wild-type Rnl2 reaction. This result underscores that the lysine nucleophile is not strictly essential for the chemical step of phosphodiester bond formation. Similar results concerning the ability of motif I lysine mutants to catalyze phosphodiester bond formation have been reported for ATP-dependent DNA ligases (19Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9679-9684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Sriskanda V. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4618-4625Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 21Sriskanda V. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. Shuman S Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2221-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The five putative nucleotidyl transferase motifs of Rnl2 and related ligases are highlighted in Fig. 1. Motif I, which contains the active site lysine, adheres to the consensus sequence EKX(H/D)GXN, which differs from the XKXDGXR sequence characteristic of ATP-dependent DNA ligases and most mRNA capping enzymes (22Shuman S. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 2001; 66: 301-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To evaluate the functional relevance of the signature Glu34 and Asn40 side chains, we substituted each with alanine. Alanine changes were also introduced at five other conserved positions: Arg55, located between motifs I and III; Glu99 in motif III; Phe119 and Asp120 in motif IIIa; and Lys209 flanking motif IV. A single nonconserved residue, Lys189, was also changed to alanine. The E34A, N40A, R55A, E99A, F119A, D120A, K189A, and K209A mutants were produced in E. coli as His10-tagged fusions and purified from soluble bacterial extracts by nickel-agarose chromatography (Fig.5A). The 42-kDa Rnl2 polypeptide was the predominant species detected by SDS-PAGE, and the extents of purification were comparable for mutant and wild-type Rnl2 (Fig. 5A). The D120A mutation elicited a reproducible increase in the electrophoretic mobility of Rnl2, apparently caused by the loss of the acidic carboxylate moiety (see below). The adenylyltransferase activity of recombinant Rnl2 was assayed by label transfer from [α-32P]ATP to the Rnl2 polypeptide to form the covalent enzyme-adenylate intermediate. The extent of ligase-adenylate formation by wild-type Rnl2 was proportional to input protein (Fig. 5B). We estimated from the slope of the titration curve that 65% of the input enzyme molecules became labeled with [32P]AMP. The residual fraction of the protein preparation likely comprises preadenylated Rnl2 (see below). The E34A, E99A, F119A, D120A, and E204A mutants were effectively inert over the same range of input enzyme, i.e. their specific activities were ≤1% of the wild-type value. Other mutants displaying significant defects in step 1 adenylation were R55A (2.3%), K209A (2.7%), K227A (4.1%), and N40A (15%). Only the K198A mutant displayed near wild-type adenylyltransferase activity (Fig. 5B and TableI).Table IMutational effects on Rnl2 adenylyltransferase activityMotifMutationSpecific activityDNA ligase amino acids/contacts% of wild typeIE34A0.4E34D0.2E34Q2.1N40A15ArgN40D99Ribose ON40Q21N40R0.2R55A2.3ArgR55K30γ-PO4 and 5′-PO4R55Q1.3IIIE99A0.8GluE99D1.3Ribose OE99Q0.2IIIaF119A<0.1PheF119L3.9AdenineD120A<0.1AspD120E12salt bridgeD120N0.2K189A70IVE204A0.2GluE204D2.2MetalE204Q<0.1K209A2.7Arg/LysK209R25Salt bridgeK209Q7.3VK225A0.2LysK225R2.2α-PO4 and 5′-PO4K225Q<0.1K227A4.1LysK227R<0.1α-PO4K227Q3.9The recombinant Rnl2 preparations were titrated for adenylyltransferase activity as described in the legend to Fig. 5B.

This sulfate is proposed to mimic the 5′-PO4 of the DNA nick. Mutational effects on ligation of a 5′ 32P-labeled single-stranded RNA substrate in the presence and absence of ATP under conditions of enzyme excess are shown in Fig.6. Wild-type Rnl2 efficiently circularized the RNA in the absence of ATP (reflecting the catalysis of steps 2 and 3 by preformed Rnl2-AMP in the enzyme preparation) but generated predominantly AppRNA in the presence of ATP. The ligation activity of the K189A mutant was indistinguishable from that of wild-type Rnl2. Mutants E34A, E99A, and D120A failed to form any ligated RNA circles or RNA-adenylate intermediate. R55A and F119A formed only trace amounts of RNA-adenylate and no ligated circles (Fig.6). The profound defects of the E34A, R55A, E99A, F119A, and D120A mutants in overall ligation were in keeping with their inability to form the ligase-adenylate intermediate in vitro. The failure to ligate in the absence of ATP suggests that these five mutants were also not adenylated to any significant extent during their production in E. coli (unlike the wild-type Rnl2). The K209A mutant generated high levels of RNA-adenylate in the absence of ATP but did not carry the reaction through to form circular products. Thus, although K209A was defective in ligase adenylation in vitro, it clearly did react with ATP to form ligase-adenylate in vivo in E. coli. The accumulation of AppRNA suggested that K209A might be defective in step 3 of the ligation pathway (see below). The N40A mutant displayed weak activity in RNA adenylation in the absence of ATP and did not generate a circular product. The present results, together with previous mutational data (13Ho C.K. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12709-12714Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), highlight 11 individual amino acids in addition to the motif I lysine nucleophile (Lys35) that are essential for Rnl2 activity: Glu34, His37, Asn40, Arg55, Glu99, Phe119, Asp120, Glu204, Lys209, Lys225, and Lys227. To better evaluate the contributions of these residues to the RNA ligase reaction, we tested the effects of conservative substitutions at 10 positions (all except His37, which was mutated previously to Asp). Arginine was replaced by lysine and glutamine, glutamate by glutamine and aspartate, aspartate by asparagine and glutamate, lysine by arginine and glutamine, and phenylalanine by leucine. Also, Asn40 was replaced with arginine, which is present at the equivalent motif I position of ATP-dependent DNA ligases and most mRNA capping enzymes. Twenty new Rnl2 mutants were produced in E. coli and purified from soluble bacterial extracts by nickel-agarose chromatography. The Rnl2 polypeptide was the predominant species detected by SDS-PAGE, and the extents of purification were comparable for mutant and wild-type Rnl2 (Fig.7). The D120N mutation caused the same increase in the electrophoretic mobility seen with D120A, which was rectified when Asp120 was replaced by Glu (Fig. 7,middle panel). The K227R mutation also caused an increase in electrophoretic mobility, which was not seen with K227Q (Fig. 7,bottom panel) or K227A (13Ho C.K. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12709-12714Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The adenylyltransferase activities of the mutants were determined by enzyme titration and normalized to the wild-type value (Table I). Conservative replacement of Glu34, Glu99, or Glu204 with Asp or Gln elicited severe catalytic defects comparable with those seen with the respective Ala mutants. These data establish the requirement for a carboxylate residue at positions 34, 99, and 204 and a minimum distance from the main chain to the carboxylate that is met by glutamate but not aspartate. Note that glutamates are strictly conserved at these three positions in the trypanosome, baculovirus, and entomopoxvirus Rnl2 homologs (Fig. 1). Changing Asp120 to Asn reduced ligase-AMP formation to 0.2% of the wild-type level, similar to the D120A mutant, but activity was partially restored by the glutamate substitution (to 12% of wild type). Thus, the carboxylate functional group is critical at position 120, but there is some flexibility in accommodating the longer Glu side chain instead of Asp. This is notable in light of the fact that Glu is present at the corresponding motif IIIa position of the baculovirus and entomopoxvirus Rnl2 homologs (Fig. 1). Whereas replacement of Arg55 by Lys resulted in a significant gain of function (to 30% of wild type) compared with R55A (2.3%), the R55Q change had no salutary effect. Similarly, the introduction of Arg in lieu of Lys209 restored activity to 25% of wild type, compared with 2.7% for K209A, whereas the glutamine mutant was 7.3% as active as wild type. We surmise that the positive charges at positions 55 and 209 are important for ligase adenylation. (Note that the position corresponding to Rnl2 Lys209 is occupied by Arg in several of the Rnl2 homologs shown in Fig. 1.) In contrast, Lys225 and Lys227 in motif V are strictly essential and cannot be functionally replaced by either Arg or Gln (Table I), even though the second lysine is naturally an arginine in one of the trypanosome RNA-editing ligases. Replacing Phe119 in motif IIIa with leucine resulted in a slight gain of function (to 3.9% of wild type) compared with the F119A mutant (<0.1% activity), but F119L was still significantly compromised. This finding attests to the importance of the aromatic side chain. We eschewed changing Phe119 to Tyr because tyrosine is present at the equivalent positions of the entomopoxvirus and baculovirus Rnl2 homologs (Fig. 1). Instructive conservative mutational effects were seen at Asn40 of motif I, where adenylyltransferase was restored to wild-type level by aspartic acid but not by glutamine. These findings suggest that: (i) there is steric constraint precluding function of the longer glutamine side chain and (ii) Asn40 likely functions as a hydrogen bond acceptor during the adenylyltransferase reaction. This is in contrast to the hydrogen bond donor function of the conserved arginine at the equivalent motif I position of ATP-dependent DNA ligase and capping enzyme (10Håkansson K. Doherty A.J.

https://openalex.org/W2118234714,"The activity of apical K+channels in cortical collecting duct (CCD) is stimulated and inhibited by protein kinase A (PKA) and C (PKC), respectively. Direct interaction between phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and the cloned CCD K+ channel, ROMK1, is critical for channel opening. We have found previously that phosphorylation of ROMK1 by PKA increases affinity of the channel for PIP2 and mutation of PKA sites reduces the affinity of ROMK1 for PIP2. In this study we investigate the molecular mechanism for PKC regulation of ROMK and report that mutants of ROMK1 with reduced PIP2 affinity exhibit an increased sensitivity to inhibition by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). The effect of PMA can be prevented by pretreatment with calphostin-C. Activation of PKC by carbachol in Xenopusoocytes co-expressing M1 muscarinic receptors also causes inhibition of the channels. Calphostin-C prevents carbachol-induced inhibition, suggesting that activation of PKC is necessary for inhibition of the channels. PMA reduces open probability of the channel in cell-attached patch clamp recordings. After inhibition by PMA in cell-attached recordings, application of PIP2 to the cytoplasmic face of excised inside-out membranes restores channel activity. PMA reduces PIP2 content in oocyte membrane and calphostin-C prevents the reduction. These results suggest that reduction of membrane PIP2 content contributes to the inhibition of ROMK1 channels by PKC.

Giebisch G. Seldin D.W. Giebisch G. The Kidney: Physiology and Pathophysiology. Second Ed. Lippincott Williams ' Wilkins, Philadelphia1992: 2209-2246Google Scholar). In the thick ascending limb (TAL)1 of Henle's loop, the recycling of K+ ions across the low-conductance apical K+ channels is essential for NaCl reabsorption through the apical Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (1Wright F.S. Giebisch G. Seldin D.W. Giebisch G. The Kidney: Physiology and Pathophysiology. Second Ed. Lippincott Williams ' Wilkins, Philadelphia1992: 2209-2246Google Scholar). The importance of the apical K+ channels for NaCl reabsorption in TAL is underscored by the genetic disease, Bartter's syndrome, in which loss-of-function mutations of the channels result in impairment of NaCl transport in this nephron segment (2Simon D.B. Karet F.E. Rodriguez-Soriano J. Hamdan J.H. DiPietro A. Trachtman H. Sanjad S.A. Lifton R.P. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). In the cortical collecting ducts (CCDs), secretion of K+ into urinary space is mediated by active transport of K+ into the cell through basolateral Na+-K+-ATPase, followed by passive movement of K+ into the tubular fluid through apical K+channels (1Wright F.S. Giebisch G. Seldin D.W. Giebisch G. The Kidney: Physiology and Pathophysiology. Second Ed. Lippincott Williams ' Wilkins, Philadelphia1992: 2209-2246Google Scholar). cDNAs for ROMK1 and its isoforms ROMK2 and -3 have been isolated (3Ho K. Nichols C.G. Lederer W.J. Lytton J. Vassilev P.M.

Based on the distribution of mRNA and proteins, and biophysical characterization, it is known that ROMK1 and ROMK2 encode the low-conductance secretory K+ channels in CCDs and TALs, respectively (4Hebert S.C. Kidney Int. 1995; 48: 1010-1016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The apical K+ channels in CCDs and TALs are regulated by multiple signaling pathways, including protein kinase A (PKA), protein kinase C (PKC), cGMP, calcium-calmodulin activated kinase II, intracellular pH, arachidonic acid, etc. (5Giebisch G. Wang W. Acta Physiol. Scand. 2000; 170: 153-173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These signaling pathways play important roles in hormonal regulation of the K+channels. The PKA pathway is important for the regulation of the K+ channels in TALs and CCDs by vasopressin (6Cassola A.C. Giebisch G. Wang W. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: F502-F509PubMed Google Scholar, 7Wang W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: F599-F605PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of direct phosphorylation by PKA for channel function is further supported by the finding that one of the mutations in Bartter's syndrome is at a PKA phosphorylation site (2Simon D.B.

The PKC pathway is likely important for regulation of K+ transport in CCDs by many PLC-activating hormones and growth factors, including prostaglandin E2, bradykinin, and epidermal growth factor (8Sugimoto Y.

Recently, we and others reported a novel mechanism for regulation of ROMK and other inward rectifying K+ channels via direct interaction with membrane phospholipid, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) (13Hilgemann D.W.

This direct interaction occurs between PIP2 and several positively charged residues in the proximal C termini of the inward rectifying K+channels (15Huang C.L. Feng S. Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1998; 391: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar) and likely regulates channel opening by stabilizing the structure of the cytoplasmic entrance of the pore. The importance of PIP2 for inward rectifier K+ channels is further supported by many studies showing that PIP2influences the regulation of the channels by other signaling or gating molecules. PIP2 modulates the regulation of GIRK channels by Gऔγ and intracellular Na+ and Mg2+ ions (15Huang C.L. Feng S. Hilgemann D.W.

Chem. 2000; 275: 10182-10189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We found that phosphorylation of ROMK by PKA does not directly activate ROMK1 channels in membranes that are depleted of PIP2 (19Liou H.H. Zhou S.S. Huang C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5820-5825Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Rather, it lowers the concentration of PIP2 necessary for activation of the channels, suggesting that PKA activates ROMK1 by enhancing PIP2-channel interaction. The molecular mechanism by which PKC inhibits the activity of ROMK channels remains poorly understood. It was reported previously that PKA antagonizes PKC inhibition of K+ channels in CCD (12Wang W. Giebisch G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9722-9725Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examine the hypothesis that PKC inhibits ROMK1 channels via a PIP2-dependent mechanism. Wild type ROMK1 cDNA was in the pSPORT plasmid (3Ho K. Nichols C.G. Lederer W.J.

In the experiments applying PKC in inside-out membranes (Fig. 7), purified rat brain PKC (from Calbiochem; 1 unit/ml) was applied in a Mg2+-free bath solution containing 500 nm Ca2+ (4.86 mm CaCl2 and 5 mm EDTA) and 50 ॖm 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG). Single-channel currents were recorded with an Axopatch 200B patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), low-pass filtered at 1 kHz using an 8-pole Bessel filter, sampled every 0.1 ms (10 kHz) with Digidata-1200A interface and stored directly onto the computer hard disk (100 GB) using pCLAMP8 software. Data were transferred to CD for long-term storage. For analysis, event list files were generated using the Fetchan program and analyzed for open probability, amplitude, and dwell-time histograms using pCLAMP6 pSTAT (version 6.0.5, Axon Instruments). Open probability (NPo) was analyzed on segments of continuous recording (duration as indicated, respectively) as previously described (20Leung Y.M. Zeng W.Z. Liou H.H. Solaro C.R. Huang C.L. J. Biol.

Briefly, PIP2 in oocytes (∼10 each group) were labeled by incubating in ND96 (1 ml) containing [32P]PO4 (40–50 ॖCi) for 4 h. Oocytes were further incubated in the isotope-free ND96 for 2 h before treatments by Me2SO (vehicle), PMA and/or calphostin-C as indicated. Oocytes were homogenized in a buffer containing 1 ml of 57 trichloroacetic acid and 1 mm EDTA and spun in a microcentrifuge. Pellets were extracted in a buffer containing CHCl3, MeOH, 10 n HCl (20:20:0.2). The organic (lower) phase was collected, dried, and dissolved in 20 ॖl of CHCl3. Samples (5 ॖl) and lipid standards were resolved by TLC using 1-propanol, H2O, NH4OH (65:15:20). 32P-Labeled lipids were detected by autoradiography. Lipid standards were detected with iodine vapor. PIP2 mass was measured by separation of deacylated phospholipids using anion-exchange HPLC as previously described (24Nasuhoglu C. Feng S. Mao J. Yamamoto M. Yin H.L. Earnes S. Barylko B. Albanesi J.P. Hilgemann D.W. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 301: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 25Nasuhoglu C. Feng S. Mao Y. Shammat I. Yamamoto M. Earnest S. Lemmon M. Hilgemann D.W. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2002; 283: C223-C234Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Briefly, oocytes with or without PMA treatment were homogenized and phospholipids were extracted in 1 ml of cold CHCl3, MeOH, 10 n HCl (20:40:1). Phospholipids were deacylated with monomethylamine and the head groups were separated by anion-exchange HPLC (Ionpac AS-11-HC2 mm column and AG11-HC2 mm guard column) using a three-stage NaOH gradient from 10 to 80 mm. Elution of the deacylated phospholipids (in comparison with the standards) was monitored by detection of the glycerol head group by suppressed conductivity. To test the hypothesis that PIP2 plays an important role in modulating PKC inhibition of ROMK1 channels, we compare the effects of PKC activators, PMA and OAG, on wild type and mutant ROMK1 channels with reduced PIP2 affinity. We have previously shown that mutation of a PKA consensus site, serine 219, to alanine (S219A) reduces the affinity of ROMK1 for PIP2 (19Liou H.H. Zhou S.S. Huang C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5820-5825Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, the activity of S219A mutant was partially inhibited by addition of PMA (300 nm) to the extracellular bath solution. The decrease in channel activity was apparent within 10 min after administration of PMA and leveled at ∼607 inhibition by 30 min. Pretreatment with PKC inhibitor calphostin-C (0.5 ॖm) prevented the inhibition of channels by PMA (Fig. 1C). Another PKC activator OAG inhibited S219A channel activity similarly (Fig. 1D). As reported previously by others (26Henry P. Pearson W.L. Nichols C.G. J. Physiol. 1996; 495: 681-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), activation of PKC by PMA did not cause a significant inhibition of wild type ROMK channels expressed in oocytes (Fig. 1A). These results suggest that reduction of PIP2-ROMK1 interaction increases the sensitivity of channels to inhibition by PKC. Lack of inhibition by PKC on the wild type channel in oocytes is likely because of that ROMK1 has a higher baseline affinity for PIP2 (see “Discussion”). The role of PIP2-channel interaction in modulating PKC inhibition of ROMK1 is further supported by the following studies using additional mutants with reduced PIP2 affinity. Arginine 188 of ROMK1 is critical for electrostatic interaction with PIP2 (15Huang C.L. Feng S. Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1998; 391: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar, 19Liou H.H. Zhou S.S. Huang C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5820-5825Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). PIP2-channel interaction is reduced by neutralization of arginine 188 to glutamine (R188Q), but not by a conserved charge substitution by lysine (R188K) (15Huang C.L. Feng S. Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1998; 391: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar, 19Liou H.H. Zhou S.S. Huang C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5820-5825Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Mutation of another PKA phosphorylation site, serine 313, to alanine (S313A) also reduces PIP2 affinity (19Liou H.H. Zhou S.S. Huang C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5820-5825Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2, addition of PMA caused inhibition on S313A and R188Q mutants but not on R188K mutant. Pretreatment with calphostin-C prevented the inhibition (Fig. 2, A–C). OAG caused a similar inhibition on S313A and R188Q (not shown). We performed cell-attached patch clamp recording to examine whether PKC affects single channel conductance and/or open probability (NPo) of the channel. In oocytes expressing S219A mutants, PMA caused a reduction in NPo (Fig.3A). TheNPo of S219A was reduced to 25 ± 117 in 30 min (Fig. 4A). PMA did not alter the current-voltage relationship (not shown) or unitary conductance of single channels (36 ± 2.7 pS versus35 ± 1.9 pS; between −50 and −100 mV). In time control experiments, Me2SO (vehicle) had no effect on the channel (not shown). Pretreatment with calphostin-C prevented the reduction ofNPo caused by PMA (Fig. 3B). The effect of PMA to reduce NPo was further confirmed on S313A and R188Q mutants. As shown in Fig. 4, B and C, PMA reduced NPo of S313A and R188Q by 65 and 687, respectively.Figure 4Effect of PMA on the activity of S219A (panel A), S313A (panel B), and R188Q (panel C) mutant in cell-attached recording.n = 5–7 for each experimental condition. The activity of channel (measured as NPo) after 10 min addition of PMA was normalized to the pre-PMA level (1007).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The activity of S219A mutant channels was first recorded in on-cell patch clamp recording. As shown earlier, addition of PMA caused a reduction of NPo of channel in ∼10 min (Fig. 5A). After channel inhibition by PMA, inside-out membrane patches were then excised and PIP2 (50 ॖm) was applied to the cytoplasmic face. Application of PIP2 to the cytoplasmic face of the excised inside-out membrane increased NPo of the channel. These results suggest that PMA inhibits the activity of the S219A mutant ROMK by reducing PIP2-channel interaction. After recovery of channel activity by PIP2, further application of PMA to the excised patch did not cause inhibition of the channel (Fig. 5A). The lack of effect for the second application of PMA in the inside-out membrane is not because of the fact that PKC was not present in the excised membranes (see Fig. 7, below). Fig. 5B summaries the results of five similar experiments. As shown, PMA decreased NPo to 15 ± 47 of the control level (Fig. 5B, time point2). Application of PIP2 to the inside-out membranes increased NPo to 68 ± 187 of the control level (time point 3), which was not affected by re-application of PMA to the excised membranes (63 ± 117; time point 4). ROMK channels run down slowly in the excised membranes in Mg2+-free bath solutions (15Huang C.L. Feng S. Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1998; 391: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar, 19Liou H.H. Zhou S.S. Huang C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5820-5825Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 20Leung Y.M. Zeng W.Z. Liou H.H. Solaro C.R. Huang C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10182-10189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The incomplete recovery by PIP2 in the excised membranes is likely because of run-down of channels over time. The reduction of PIP2-ROMK interaction by PKC may be because of reduction of membrane PIP2 content. We examined the effect of PKC activation on PIP2 content in oocyte membrane. Phospholipids in oocyte membranes were labeled by incubating with [32P]PO4, extracted, and resolved by thin layer chromatography. As shown in Fig.6A, PMA caused a reduction of32P-labeled PIP2 and PIP. Pretreatment by calphostin-C prevented the reduction. The average reductions of32P-labeled PIP2 and PIP by PMA were 57 (p < 0.05; Fig. 6B) and 627 (not shown), respectively. To assure that the effect of PMA is not because of alteration of the kinetics of labeling by [32P]PO4, we also measured PIP2and PIP mass using anion exchange high pressure liquid chromatography (24Nasuhoglu C. Feng S. Mao J. Yamamoto M. Yin H.L. Earnes S. Barylko B. Albanesi J.P. Hilgemann D.W. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 301: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 25Nasuhoglu C. Feng S. Mao Y. Shammat I. Yamamoto M. Earnest S. Lemmon M. Hilgemann D.W. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2002; 283: C223-C234Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In agreement with the results from measurement of32P-labeled PIP2 and PIP, we found that PMA reduced PIP2 and PIP mass in oocyte membranes by 43 and 647, respectively. The effect of PKC on S219A channels was further studied using purified PKC in the excised inside-out patches. As shown in Fig. 7, application of purified PKC (1 units/ml) to the cytoplasmic face of the membrane did not cause inhibition of the channel over 10 min. The activity of channel in the membrane patches after application of purified PKC (Fig.7B, open square) was not different from that in the time-control experiments (closed circle). These results suggest that the pathway(s) involved in inhibition of channels by PKC is disrupted in the excised membranes. Finally, we examined the role of PKC in the regulation of ROMK channel by phospholipase C (PLC)-coupled receptors. Type 1 muscarinic receptor (M1R) activates PLC via Gq (27Kobrinsky E. Mirshahi T. Zhang H. Jin T. Logothetis D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In many cell types including Xenopus oocytes, elevation of intracellular Ca2+ following receptor activation of PLC increases outwardly rectifying Cl− currents by activating the endogenous Ca2+-dependent Cl−channels (27Kobrinsky E. Mirshahi T. Zhang H. Jin T. Logothetis D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Addition of carbachol (indicated by the upward arrow in the left panel of Fig.8A) caused an immediate increase in outwardly rectifying Cl− currents, confirming the expression of M1 receptors in oocytes. In oocytes co-expressing M1R and S219A, carbachol inhibited the activity of the channel over 7–10 min (Fig. 8B). Compared with the time course of hydrolysis of PIP2 by PLC (based on the rise in the intracellular Ca2+ and activation of outwardly rectifying Cl− currents in Fig. 8A), the time course of inhibition of S219A channel was much slower. This delayed inhibition of channel by carbachol correlated with the effect observed for activation of PKC by PMA. In support of the interpretation that carbachol inhibits the channel via activation of PKC, pretreatment with calphostin-C prevented the inhibition (not shown). As in the experiments using PMA, carbachol did not affect wild type ROMK1 channel co-expressed with M1 muscarinic receptor in oocytes (not shown). The effect of carbachol on PIP2 content was examined (Fig.8C). Expression of M1R by itself (without addition of carbachol) did not alter [32P]PIP2 content in oocytes (labeled M1R; 95 ± 77 of control). Application of carbachol reduced [32P]PIP2content to 65 ± 137 of the control level at 10 min (labeledM1R+CCh; p < 0.05 versus Control). The reduction of [32P]PIP2 content by carbachol at 10 min was prevented by pretreatment with calphostin-C (labeled M1R+Cal-C +CCh; 109 ± 157 of the control level). The complete reversal of PIP2 to the control level by calphostin-C is consistent with the notion that reduction of PIP2 by PLC-mediated hydrolysis is transient (lasting <5 min) (28Stephens L.R. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 27-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Together, these results suggest that hydrolysis of PIP2 by phospholipase C by itself is not sufficient to cause inhibition of the channel and that activation of PKC is necessary. PKC inhibits the activity of K+ channels in rat CCDs (12Wang W. Giebisch G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9722-9725Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), but the molecular mechanism for this regulation is not known. We have shown previously that PIP2 is critical for the activity of ROMK channel (15Huang C.L. Feng S. Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1998; 391: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar, 21Zeng W.-Z. Liou H.-H. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. Huang C.-L. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F826-F834Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and the regulation of ROMK by other pathways such as PKA (19Liou H.H. Zhou S.S. Huang C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5820-5825Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and intracellular pH (20Leung Y.M. Zeng W.Z. Liou H.H. Solaro C.R. Huang C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10182-10189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) interacts with PIP2 regulation of the channel. In the present study, we found that mutations of ROMK1 with reduction of affinity for PIP2 increase the sensitivity of the channel to inhibition by PKC. We also found that application of PIP2 to the cytoplasmic surface reverses PKC-mediated inhibition and that activation of PKC reduces membrane PIP2 content. Together, these results suggest that PKC inhibits ROMK channels by reducing membrane PIP2 content. Others have also reported that for other inward rectifier K+ channels mutation of the PIP2-binding site increases the sensitivity of channels to reduction in membrane PIP2 content. Kobrinsky et al. (27Kobrinsky E. Mirshahi T. Zhang H. Jin T. Logothetis D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) reported that receptor-regulated PIP2 hydrolysis (via M1 muscarinic receptor) causes desensitization of K+ currents through G protein-coupled inward rectifying K+ channels (GIRK). Another inward rectifying K+ channel, IRK1, has a higher PIP2 affinity relative to the GIRK channel (15Huang C.L. Feng S. Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1998; 391: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Kobrinskyet al. (27Kobrinsky E. Mirshahi T. Zhang H. Jin T. Logothetis D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) reported that hydrolysis of PIP2under the same experimental conditions does not affect the activity of IRK1. They also found that mutations of PIP2-binding residues of IRK1 render the channel sensitive to receptor-regulated reduction of PIP2 in the membrane (27Kobrinsky E. Mirshahi T. Zhang H. Jin T. Logothetis D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The affinity of ROMK1 for PIP2 is the same as that of IRK1 (15Huang C.L. Feng S. Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1998; 391: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Thus, it is perhaps no surprise that a partial reduction of PIP2 by PMA does not affect the activity of the wild type ROMK1 channel in oocytes. Then, why does activation of PKC cause inhibition on K+channels in CCD (12Wang W. Giebisch G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9722-9725Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) but not on the wild type ROMK1 channel expressed in Xenopus oocytes (see Ref. 26Henry P. Pearson W.L. Nichols C.G. J. Physiol. 1996; 495: 681-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar and Fig. 1Aalso)? Our study suggests that this difference may be explained by a lower baseline PIP2-K+ channel interaction in CCD than in Xenopus oocytes, which renders channels in CCDs more sensitive to PKC regulation. The lower baseline PIP2-K+ channel interaction in CCD may be because of lower PIP2 content in the apical membrane of CCD and/or that native K+ channels are partially phosphorylated by PKA and thus have a lower affinity for PIP2. It is difficult to directly compare PIP2 content in the apical membrane of CCD with that in oocyte membrane. Our finding that PKA site mutants S219A and S313A are sensitive to inhibition by PKC at least provides support for the latter possibility. Many hormones, including bradykinin, prostaglandin E2, and epidermal growth factor inhibit K+ transport in CCDs (8Sugimoto Y. Namba T. Shigemoto R. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. Narumiya S. Am. J.

Invest. 1998; 102: 194-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Bradykinin and prostaglandin E2 activate PLC-औ via G proteins and epidermal growth factor activates PLC-γ via the intrinsic receptor tyrosine kinase (29Breyer M.D. Breyer R.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F12-F23PubMed Google Scholar, 30Muto S. Furuya H. Tabei K. Asano Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: F163-F169PubMed Google Scholar, 31Guan Y Zhang Y. Breyer R.M. Fowler B. Davis L. Hebert R.L. Breyer M.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 194-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). These PLC-activating hormones may inhibit K+ transport through either hydrolyzing PIP2 and/or through activating PKC. However, some hormone receptors, such as epidermal growth factor receptors, are present only in the basolateral membrane (30Muto S. Furuya H. Tabei K. Asano Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: F163-F169PubMed Google Scholar) in contrast to the localization of the K+ channel in the apical membrane of CCD. Furthermore, the reduction of PIP2in the plasma membranes caused by hydrolysis via PLC alone is generally limited in magnitude and duration (28Stephens L.R. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 27-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) and is probably not sufficient to cause a decrease in the activity of the channels with a high affinity for PIP2, such as ROMK. In this study, we found that hydrolysis of PIP2 following M1 receptor activation is not sufficient to cause inhibition of the S219A ROMK mutant (which has a lower affinity for PIP2 probably equivalent to the native channels) and activation of PKC is necessary for inhibition of the channel via stimulation of M1 receptors (Fig. 8). Activation of PKC likely does so by amplifying the reduction of PIP2initiated by hydrolysis by PLC. Thus, activation of PKC is likely the mechanism by which PLC-activating hormones inhibit K+channels in the apical membrane of CCD. Regulation of K+channels by these hormones is important in certain physiological and pathophysiological states. For example, inhibition of K+channels may help to prevent excess kaliuresis during natriuresis (occurs as a result of inhibition of Na+ reabsorption at the proximal sites). A recent review suggests that loss of this direct inhibitory action in K+ secretion by prostaglandin E2 may be helpful in mitigating hyperkalemia associated with administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (29Breyer M.D. Breyer R.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F12-F23PubMed Google Scholar). One common mechanism for PKC to regulate protein function is by direct phosphorylation of target proteins. Indeed, direct phosphorylation is important for PKC regulation of some inward-rectifier K+channels (32Light P.E. Bladen C. Winkfein R.J. Walsh M.P. French R.J Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9058-9063Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 33Karle C.A. Zitron E. Zhang W. Wendt-Nordahl G. Kathofer S. Thomas D. Gut B. Scholz E. Vahl C.F. Katus H.A. Kiehn J. Circulation. 2002; 106: 1493-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Our present study does not contradict with the possibility that phosphorylation of ROMK by PKC may be important for channel inhibition. Rather, it suggests that reduction of PIP2 content by PKC is important for inhibition of ROMK1 in oocytes. Hill and Peralta (34Hill J. Peralta E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5505-5510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) recently reported that activation of PKC by PMA and M1 receptor inhibits GIRK channels expressed in oocytes. Interestingly, the authors found that mutation of potential PKC phosphorylation sites does not prevent the inhibition of GIRK channels by PKC. Our work opens new possibilities for regulation of PIP2-regulated ion channels and other proteins by PLC-activating hormones. Nasuhoglu et al. (25Nasuhoglu C. Feng S. Mao Y. Shammat I. Yamamoto M.

https://openalex.org/W2080373915,"The transcriptional activation of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) is an important step during cellular immortalization and tumorigenesis. To study how this activation occurs during immortalization, we have established a set of genetically related pre-crisis cells and their immortal progeny. As expected, hTERT mRNA was detected in our telomerase-positive immortal cells but not in pre-crisis cells or telomerase-negative immortal cells. However, transiently transfected luciferase reporters controlled by hTERT promoter sequences exhibited similar levels of luciferase activity in both telomerase-positive and -negative cells, suggesting that the endogenous chromatin context is likely required for hTERT regulation. Analysis of chromatin susceptibility to DNase I digestion consistently identified a DNase I hypersensitivity site (DHS) near the hTERT transcription initiation site in telomerase-positive cells. In addition, the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) induced hTERT transcription and also a general increase in chromatin sensitivity to DNase treatment in telomerase-negative cells. The TSA-induced hTERT transcription in pre-crisis cells was accompanied by the formation of a DHS at the hTERT promoter. Furthermore, the TSA-induced hTERT transcription and chromatin alterations were not blocked by cycloheximide, suggesting that this induction does not require de novo protein synthesis and that TSA induces hTERT expression through the inhibition of histone deacetylation at the hTERT promoter. Taken together, our results suggest that the endogenous chromatin environment plays a critical role in the regulation of hTERT expression during cellular immortalization. The transcriptional activation of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) is an important step during cellular immortalization and tumorigenesis. To study how this activation occurs during immortalization, we have established a set of genetically related pre-crisis cells and their immortal progeny. As expected, hTERT mRNA was detected in our telomerase-positive immortal cells but not in pre-crisis cells or telomerase-negative immortal cells. However, transiently transfected luciferase reporters controlled by hTERT promoter sequences exhibited similar levels of luciferase activity in both telomerase-positive and -negative cells, suggesting that the endogenous chromatin context is likely required for hTERT regulation. Analysis of chromatin susceptibility to DNase I digestion consistently identified a DNase I hypersensitivity site (DHS) near the hTERT transcription initiation site in telomerase-positive cells.

Telomeres are specialized nucleoprotein complexes that serve as protective caps of linear eukaryotic chromosomal ends and are essential for both chromosomal stability and long term cellular proliferation. Human telomeres consist of TTAGGG repeats that can be replenished by the action of telomerase (1Morin G.B. Cell. 1989; 59: 521-529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar), a ribonucleoprotein reverse transcriptase complex containing an RNA subunit (hTER) and a protein catalytic subunit (hTERT). 1The abbreviations used are: hTERT, human telomerase reverse transcriptase; ALT, alternative lengthening of telomere; CRR9, cisplatin-resistance related gene; DHS, DNase I hypersensitive site; HDAC, histone deacetylase; TRAP, telomeric repeat amplification protocol; TSA, trichostatin A; CMV, cytomegalovirus; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase PCR. hTER RNA is ubiquitously expressed in both telomerase-positive and -negative cells (2Feng J. Funk W.D. Wang S.S. Weinrich S.L. Avilion A.A. Chiu C.P. Adams R.R. Chang E. Allsopp R.C. Yu J. Le S. West M.D. Harley C.B. Andrews W.H. Greider C.W. Villeponteau B. Science. 1995; 269: 1236-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2087) Google Scholar). Conversely, expression of the hTERT message correlates with the presence of telomerase activity (3Meyerson M. Counter C.M. Eaton E.N. Ellisen L.W. Steiner P. Caddle S.D. Ziaugra L. Beijersbergen R.L. Davidoff M.J. Liu Q. Bacchetti S. Haber D.A. Weinberg R.A.

Science. 1997; 277: 955-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (2075) Google Scholar). In most normal somatic cells, the hTERT gene is repressed and telomeres progressively shorten upon successive cell divisions, because of the absence of telomere maintenance, leading to permanent cell cycle arrest (known as M1 senescence) at the end of their life span (Hayflick limit). However, when normal cells are transformed by viral oncogenes, such as SV40 large T antigen, they are able to bypass M1 senescence and continue to proliferate despite telomere shortening (5Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Exp. Gerontol. 1992; 27: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). This leads to the loss of telomere capping activity and culminates in M2 crisis, a process of severe chromosomal instability and massive cell death. The few cells that survive crisis exhibit one of the two telomere maintenance pathways. One pathway is dependent on telomerase activity and involves activation or de-repression of hTERT gene expression. The second pathway is independent of telomerase activity and is referred to as alternative lengthening of telomere (ALT) (6Bryan T.M. Englezou A. Gupta J. Bacchetti S. Reddel R.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4240-4248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar). As suggested by studies in yeast, the ALT pathway presumably involves a re-combination process (7Lundblad V. Blackburn E.H. Cell. 1993; 73: 347-360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). The regulation of telomerase activity likely involves multiple mechanisms. The major regulatory step of hTERT expression is associated with transcription initiation (8Ducrest A.L. Szutorisz H. Lingner J. Nabholz M. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 541-552Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In cancer cells and immortalized cell lines that express telomerase, the level of hTERT transcripts has been shown to correlate with telomerase activity (3Meyerson M. Counter C.M. Eaton E.N. Ellisen L.W. Steiner P. Caddle S.D. Ziaugra L. Beijersbergen R.L. Davidoff M.J. Liu Q. Bacchetti S. Haber D.A. Weinberg R.A.

Science. 1997; 277: 955-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (2075) Google Scholar). In addition, the hTERT transcripts appear to include multiple alternatively spliced forms, several of which have been predicted to encode inactive or dominant negative isoforms of the hTERT protein (9Aisner D.L. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 80-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may also contribute to the regulation of hTERT activity (10Kang S.S. Kwon T. Kwon D.Y. Do S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13085-13090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Although the means by which hTERT gene expression is controlled remain an area of intense investigation, available evidence indicates that hTERT transcription is regulated by both positive and negative mechanisms. Positive regulation of hTERT gene expression has been suggested by results from analyses of the hTERT promoter. It has been reported that hTERT transcription can be activated by overexpression or activation of several transcription activators, including c-Myc, E6, and the estrogen receptor (11Kyo S. Takakura M. Kanaya T. Zhuo W. Fujimoto K. Nishio Y. Orimo A. Inoue M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5917-5921PubMed Google Scholar, 12Misiti S. Nanni S. Fontemaggi G. Cong Y.-S. Wen J. Hirte H.W. Piaggio G.

Genet. 1999; 21: 220-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). Experiments utilizing transiently transfected reporter constructs have led to the identification of a proximal promoter region that is apparently sufficient for maximum hTERT promoter activity. This region, located from –1 kb to +60 bp relative to the transcription start site, contains putative binding elements for several transcription factors, including Sp1, c-Myc, E2F, NF-1, AP2, and the Wilms' tumor protein (16Wu K.J. Grandori C. Amacker M. Simon-Vermot N. Polack A. Lingner J. Dalla-Favera R. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 220-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar, 17Horikawa I. Cable P.L. Afshari C. Barrett J.C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 826-830PubMed Google Scholar). It is known that c-Myc, E2F, and Sp1 proteins are expressed in normal proliferating cells that lack telomerase activity. Therefore, in addition to direct activation of the hTERT promoter by transcription factors in many cancer cells, mechanisms of active repression must be present in normal somatic cells to prevent inappropriate expression of the hTERT gene. Several lines of evidence suggest that the hTERT gene is subject to negative control. First, hTERT expression is repressed in most somatic cells. Its expression is induced in normal cells by treatment with the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) (18Xu D. Popov N. Hou M. Wang Q. Bjorkholm M. Gruber A. Menkel A.R. Henriksson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3826-3831Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 19Cong Y.S. Bacchetti S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35665-35668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), although this could be an indirect effect. Second, somatic cell fusion studies have revealed that hTERT expression in immortalized cells can be silenced upon their fusion with normal cells (20Pereira-Smith O.M. Smith J.R. Science. 1983; 221: 964-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Additionally, the introduction of several different normal chromosomes or chromosomal segments into immortal cells leads to telomerase suppression, telomere shortening, and a restored senescence/crisis phenotype, implying that these chromosomal regions harbor genes involved in telomerase repression (21Oshimura M. Barrett J.C. Eur. J. Cancer. 1997; 33: 710-715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Although hTERT transcription has been studied extensively, mechanisms of its activation during cellular immortalization remain largely unknown. Using transiently transfected reporter constructs, a number of potential regulatory elements and their binding proteins have been identified (17Horikawa I. Cable P.L. Afshari C. Barrett J.C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 826-830PubMed Google Scholar, 18Xu D. Popov N. Hou M. Wang Q. Bjorkholm M. Gruber A. Menkel A.R. Henriksson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Overexpression of some of these transcription factors, such as c-Myc, was shown to activate endogenous hTERT transcription in different cellular contexts; however, their roles in telomerase activation during cellular immortalization are still unclear. Durest et al. (25Ducrest A.L. Amacker M. Mathieu Y.D. Cuthbert A.P. Trott D.A. Newbold R.F. Nabholz M. Lingner J. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7594-7602PubMed Google Scholar) recently reported that transiently transfected green fluorescence protein reporters controlled by hTERT promoter sequences were equally active in two unrelated lines of fibroblasts, the telomerase-negative GM847 ALT cell line and the telomerase-positive cell line GM639. This result indicates that transient transfection of plasmids containing the hTERT promoter may not be an appropriate model for studying activation of the endogenous hTERT transcription (25Ducrest A.L. Amacker M. Mathieu Y.D. Cuthbert A.P. Trott D.A. Newbold R.F. Nabholz M. Lingner J. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7594-7602PubMed Google Scholar). In most of the previous studies of the hTERT promoter, normal cells and cancer cell lines with unrelated lineage were used (16Wu K.J. Grandori C. Amacker M. Simon-Vermot N. Polack A. Lingner J. Dalla-Favera R. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 220-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar, 17Horikawa I. Cable P.L. Afshari C. Barrett J.C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 826-830PubMed Google Scholar, 26Oh S. Song Y.H. Kim U.J. Yim J. Kim T.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Whereas these different cell lines have provided important information about hTERT promoter function, it is conceivable that cells with divergent backgrounds may regulate hTERT transcription differently because of the distinct complement of transcription factors they express. To avoid this problem, recent studies have utilized somatic cell hybrids (25Ducrest A.L. Amacker M. Mathieu Y.D. Cuthbert A.P. Trott D.A. Newbold R.F. Nabholz M. Lingner J. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7594-7602PubMed Google Scholar, 27Horikawa I. Cable P.L. Mazur S.J. Appella E. Afshari C.A. Barrett J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2585-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Durest et al. (25Ducrest A.L. Amacker M. Mathieu Y.D. Cuthbert A.P. Trott D.A. Newbold R.F. Nabholz M. Lingner J. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7594-7602PubMed Google Scholar) showed that an extra chromosome 3 from normal cells was able to repress endogenous hTERT transcription but not transcription from transiently transfected hTERT reporters in the breast cancer cell line 21NT. In contrast, using the RCC23 renal cell carcinoma cell line, Horikawa et al. (27Horikawa I. Cable P.L. Mazur S.J. Appella E. Afshari C.A. Barrett J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2585-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) showed that introducing an extra chromosome 3 repressed not only the endogenous hTERT promoter but also transiently transfected hTERT promoter reporters. The repression of hTERT promoter reporters required an E-box site downstream of the transcription start site (+44 nucleotides), suggesting that Myc family proteins, or other E-box-binding proteins, may participate in the repression of the hTERT promoter. Thus, it remains to be resolved whether different genes on chromosome 3 are responsible for hTERT repression in different cell types (27Horikawa I. Cable P.L. Mazur S.J. Appella E. Afshari C.A. Barrett J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2585-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Whereas somatic cell hybrids have provided excellent models for understanding the regulation of hTERT expression because these cells are isogenic except for the transferred chromosome, the mechanisms by which the extra chromosome induces senescence are still obscure. It remains to be determined whether genetic mutations of genes on chromosome 3 are involved in the immortalization of human cells (28Bryce L.A. Morrison N. Hoare S.F. Muir S. Keith W.N. Neoplasia. 2000; 2: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It is also possible that overexpression of certain genes on this chromosome may lead to repression of the hTERT promoter by a mechanism that is not involved in cellular immortalization and tumorigenesis. Therefore, to understand the regulation of hTERT expression, it is necessary to examine the hTERT promoter activity in cells both before and after the immortalization event. To address how telomerase is activated during cellular immortalization, we have established a set of clonal pre-crisis human fibroblast cell lines and their immortal progeny. The immortal cell lines were independently derived from initially clonal populations of pre-crisis cells, designated 3A or 3C, and included cell lines that expressed telomerase activity and ALT cell lines that did not express telomerase. All these lines have similar genetic backgrounds, exhibit similar morphologies, and proliferate at similar rates. They are therefore excellent models for studying hTERT promoter regulation during cellular immortalization. Using this set of cells, we demonstrate here that the endogenous hTERT promoter was expressed in telomerase-positive cell lines but repressed in telomerase-negative pre-crisis cells and ALT lines. The expression of hTERT mRNA in telomerase-positive cells correlated with the appearance of a major DNase I hypersensitivity site (DHS) near the hTERT transcription start site. However, transiently transfected hTERT promoter reporters were equally active in both telomerase-positive and -negative cells. In addition, the histone deacetylase inhibitor TSA induced endogenous hTERT expression in telomerase-negative cells. This induction did not require de novo protein synthesis and was accompanied by a general increase in chromatin sensitivity to DNase I digestion. In pre-crisis cells, a DHS was also formed near the hTERT promoter upon TSA treatment. Our data suggest that the endogenous hTERT promoter is repressed by a native chromatin structure in telomerase-negative cells, and that activation of hTERT expression during cellular immortalization may involve relief of repression and chromatin remodeling at the hTERT promoter. Plasmids and Cell Culture—The hTERT reporter plasmids and the genomic clone pNSV4 were kindly provided by Drs. J. C. Barrett (NIEHS, National Institutes of Health) and Riccardo Dalla-Favera (Columbia University), respectively (16Wu K.J. Grandori C. Amacker M. Simon-Vermot N. Polack A. Lingner J. Dalla-Favera R. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 220-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar, 17Horikawa I. Cable P.L. Afshari C. Barrett J.C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 826-830PubMed Google Scholar). 3A and 3C pre-crisis cells were established by transforming human lung fibroblast IMR90 cells with a plasmid expressing SV40 large T and small t antigens (29Zhu J. Wang H. Bishop J.M. Blackburn E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3723-3738Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). pYF6 and pYF7 were derived from the genomic DNA clone pNSV4, a pUC19 derivative containing ∼14 kb of genomic sequence of the hTERT promoter (16Wu K.J. Grandori C. Amacker M. Simon-Vermot N. Polack A. Lingner J. Dalla-Favera R. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 220-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). The first and second codons of the hTERT open reading frame were converted to a PvuI site (CGATGCCG → CGATCGCG) by PCR-based mutagenesis. The mutagenized PCR product was subcloned into pCR-blunt II-TOPO (Invitrogen) and the mutation was confirmed by sequencing. The linker AAGCTTCTCGAGAGATCTAGAT was inserted into this new PvuI site. The HindIII-BamHI fragment of pGL3-Basic (Clontech), containing the firefly luciferase open reading frame and SV40 poly(A), was cloned into the HindIII and BglII sites of the linker. pNSV4 was digested with either XbaIor SphI and self-ligated to generate pNSV4-XbaI and pNSV4-SphI, respectively. The first exon and intron, located between two SacII sites, of these plasmids were replaced by their modified counterparts found in the pCR-blunt II-TOPO-derived construct, generating pYF6 and pYF7, respectively. Northern Analyses—Total RNA was isolated from exponentially proliferating cells using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Ten micrograms of total RNA from various cell types was run on a 1.2% agarose/formaldehyde gel and transferred to a MAGNAGraph membrane (Osmonics) in 10× SSC. Following UV cross-linking, the membrane was prehybridized and hybridized at 65 °C in Church buffer (0.5 m NaPO4, pH 7.0, 7% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 1% bovine serum albumin) in the presence of a 32P-labeled probe of interest. The blot was then washed with 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS twice for 15 min each at 65 °C and subjected to autoradiography. To hybridize the blot with a new probe, the membrane was stripped by incubating in boiling water containing 0.5% SDS for 1 h to remove the old probe. The probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by the random priming method using Ready-To-Go DNA Labeling Beads (–dCTP) (Amersham Biosciences). Free, unincorporated ATP was removed from all labeled probes using MicroSpin G-50 columns (Amersham Biosciences). Luciferase Assay—Cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) in 24-well plates with 0.2 μg of firefly luciferase reporter DNA and 0.001 μg of pRL-CMV (Promega). Cells were harvested 2 days post-transfection, and luciferase activities were measured using the Dual Luciferase Reporter (DLRTM) assay system (Promega). The firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla reniformis luciferase activity. Each data point represents an average of three independent transfections. Telomerase Assay and Telomere Southern Blots—A modified telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP assay) (30Krupp G. Kühne K. Tamm S. Klapper W. Heidorn K. Rott A. Parwaresch R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 919-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) was used to measure telomerase activity, as described previously (29Zhu J. Wang H. Bishop J.M. Blackburn E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3723-3738Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Telomere Southern analyses were performed as described previously (29Zhu J. Wang H. Bishop J.M. Blackburn E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3723-3738Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The oligo probe for telomere Southern blots was prepared by labeling the 5′ end with [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). RT-PCR Assay—One to 2 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed with an oligo(dT) primer using the SuperScript First Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). The first strand cDNAs were amplified by PCR with primers specific for hTERT and CRR9 (cisplatin-resistance related gene). The amplified products were analyzed on a 2% agarose, 0.5× TBE gel. The sequences for the hTERT primers are: 5′-TTTCTGGATTTGCAGGTGAA-3′ and 5′-CAGGAAAAATGTGGGGTTCT-3′; CRR9 primers are: 5′-GCCATTGAGCTGTGGAAAGT-3′ and 5′-TCCCCAAACTCGTTCACTCT-3′. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis (Taqman assay) was performed at the Genome Analysis Core, University of California, San Francisco, Comprehensive Cancer Center. Ten micrograms of total RNA was digested with RNase-free DNase I for 15 min at 25 °C. DNase I treatment was terminated by the addition of 25 mm EDTA and incubation at 65 °C for 10 min. cDNAs were synthesized with random hexamers using the SuperScript First Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). The hTERT primers for PCR reactions were 5′-CTGTGCCACCAAGCATTCCT-3′ and 5′-GGCTGTCCTGAGTGACCCC-3′ and the probe was 5′-FAM-ACTCGACACCGTGTCACCTACGTCCC-TAMRA-3′. A standard curve was created in each experiment using serial dilutions of positive template. The relative amount of hTERT mRNA was calculated by plotting the Ct (cycle number above the threshold) against the standard curve and normalizing to the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase message. DNase I Hypersensitivity Assay—Cultured cells (∼1 × 108) were harvested by scraping in phosphate-buffered saline and followed by two washes with phosphate-buffered saline. Nuclei were isolated by a method adapted from a protocol provided by Sergei Grigoryev (Penn State College of Medicine). Briefly, the pelleted cells were resuspended in 7 ml of RSB (3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6) plus 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and 0.5 mm Pefabloc. The cells were then homogenized in a 15-ml Dounce homogenizer (tight pestle) for 30 strokes over a 30-min period. After centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min, the pelleted nuclei were resuspended in 1.5 ml of RSB plus 0.5 mm Pefabloc and kept on ice until DNase I treatment. Aliquots of 180 μl of resuspended nuclei were placed into several microcentrifuge tubes. Serial dilutions of DNase I (RQ1-RNase I-free DNase, Promega) were prepared in DNase dilution buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 30 mm CaCl2, 30 mm MgCl2, 50% glycerol). Twenty microliters of the diluted DNase I was added to an aliquot of nuclei to obtain final concentrations of 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 units/ml. The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min, and reactions were terminated with 50 μl of 0.5 m EDTA. Following DNase I treatment, the nuclei aliquots were collected by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 4,500 rpm for 5 min. Genomic DNA was isolated from these DNase I-treated nuclei using the Wizard genomic DNA purification kit (Promega). Ten micrograms of DNA was digested with EcoRI and SphI and separated on 0.7% agarose, 0.5× TBE gels. Gels were sequentially treated in 1.5 m NaCl, 0.5 m NaOH and 1.5 m NaCl, 0.5 m Tris, pH 8.0, 20 min each, and transferred to MAGNAGraph membrane in 10× SSC. Hybridization and washing conditions were the same as described above for the Northern blot procedure. The blots were exposed to autoradiography for 1 to 3 weeks. The following primer pairs were used to amplify the genomic DNA probes: probe a, 5′-CGTGGAAACGAACATGACC-3′/5′-CCTGGGCAACAAGAGCAT-3′; probe b, 5′-GCTAGTGGACCCCGAAGG-3′/5′-CACACAGAAACCACGGTCAC-3′; CRR9, 5′-GTTTTTCCATGGGGCTGTAG-3′/5′-TTGCTTTATCCTTGGCCTGT-3′. The PCR fragments were subcloned into pCR-Blunt II-TOPO vector using the TOPO cloning kit (Invitrogen). The plasmids were digested with restriction enzymes, and probes were isolated from agarose gels. Probe a, 482-bp EcoRI-XbaI fragment; probe b, 709-bp MluI-SphI fragment; CRR9 probe, 789-bp XbaI-EcoRI fragment. Generation of Telomerase-positive and -Negative Immortal Cell Lines from Pre-crisis Cells—Pre-crisis cells were obtained by transforming human lung fibroblast IMR90 cells with a plasmid expressing the SV40 early genes, large T and small t antigens (29Zhu J. Wang H. Bishop J.M. Blackburn E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3723-3738Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The growth curves for the two independently established, initially clonal cell populations 3A and 3C are shown in Fig. 1A. Both 3A and 3C cells proliferated at a similar rate and reproducibly underwent crisis after ∼90 population doublings. In the representative experiment shown in Fig. 1A, all the pre-crisis 3C cells died during crisis, whereas spontaneous colonies arose from two of plates of pre-crisis 3A cells. Cells derived from these colonies have proliferated more than 100 population doublings beyond the crisis point and are thus considered immortal. The crisis could be averted by infecting the pre-crisis cells with a recombinant retrovirus expressing hTERT cDNA (3A/hTERT), as described previously, indicating that crisis was induced by telomere defects (29Zhu J.

In other experiments, we were able to generate spontaneous immortal lines from both 3A and 3C pre-crisis cells. Whereas the pre-crisis cells themselves expressed no detectable telomerase activity as measured by TRAP assays, some of their immortalized progeny lines, such as 3C104a and 3C167b, were telomerase-positive (Fig. 1B). These telomerase-expressing cell lines had relatively short telomeres, ranging from 3 to 6 kb (lanes 3 and 5, Fig. 1C). On the other hand, some immortal lines (3A#96, 3C87a, 3C166a, and 3C4C) displayed no detectable telomerase activity and contained longer telomeres than both the parental pre-crisis cells and their telomerase-positive siblings (Fig. 1C, lanes 1, 4, and 6). This suggests that these telomerase-negative immortal cells maintain their telomeres by the ALT pathway (6Bryan T.M. Englezou A. Gupta J. Bacchetti S. Reddel R.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4240-4248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar). These experiments also demonstrate that the pre-crisis cells can be immortalized either through activating telomerase expression or by the ALT pathway. The telomerase-expressing immortal lines and ALT lines had a similar morphology (data not shown) and proliferated at the same rate as their parental pre-crisis cells (Fig. 1A). Therefore, these cells are used as models for studying the molecular events that occur during immortalization. To determine the mechanisms of telomerase regulation in these cells, we first measured the l"

In contrast, all the urocortins bind with high affinities, and CRF binds with lower affinity to CRFR2. The first extracellular domain (ECD1) of CRFR1 is important for ligand recognition. Here, we characterize a bacterially expressed soluble protein, ECD1-CRFR2β, corresponding to the ECD1 of mouse CRFR2β. The K i values for binding to ECD1-CRFR2β are: astressin = 10.7 (5.4–21.1) nm, urocortin I = 6.4 (4.7–8.7) nm, urocortin II = 6.9 (5.8–8.3) nm, CRF = 97 (22–430) nm, urocortin III = sauvagine >200 nm. These affinities are similar to those for binding to a chimeric receptor in which the ECD1 of CRFR2β replaces the ECD of the type 1B activin receptor (ALK4). The ECD1-CRFR2β possesses a disulfide arrangement identical to that of the ECD1 of CRFR1, namely Cys45–Cys70, Cys60–Cys103, and Cys84–Cys118. As determined by circular dichroism, ECD1-CRFR2β undergoes conformational changes upon binding astressin. These data reinforce the importance of the ECD1 of CRF receptors for ligand recognition and raise the interesting possibility that different ligands having similar affinity for the full-length receptor may, nevertheless, have different affinities for microdomains of the receptor.

Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 192-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), fish (19Arai M. Assil I.Q. Abou-Samra A.B. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 446-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and Xenopus (20Dautzenberg F.M. Dietrich K. Palchaudhuri M.R. Spiess J. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1640-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). A third receptor, CRFR3, with a high level of sequence identity to CRFR1, has been cloned in catfish (19Arai M. Assil I.Q. Abou-Samra A.B. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 446-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). CRF receptors have been characterized in the central nervous system and various peripheral sites including pituitary, gastrointestinal tract, epididymis, heart, gonad, adrenal, skin, and skeletal muscle. The CRF receptors are 7-transmembrane domain proteins with relatively large first extracellular domains (ECD1s). Both CRFR1 and CRFR2 exist as multiple splice variants and belong to the type B receptor family that includes receptors for growth hormone-releasing factor, secretin, calcitonin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, glucagon, glucagon-like peptide (GLP), and parathyroid hormone (2Perrin M.H. Vale W.W. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 885: 312-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The ligand specificities in binding to CRFR1 and CRFR2 are markedly different. Although both CRF and urocortin I bind with equally high affinities to CRFR1, the affinity of CRF for CRFR2 is at least 10 times lower than that of urocortin I. There is no high affinity interaction of either urocortin II or urocortin III with CRFR1, whereas their affinities for CRFR2 are in the subnanomolar range. The agonist, sauvagine, and the peptide antagonist, astressin, have equally high affinities for both types of receptors (5Reyes T.M. Lewis K. Perrin M.H. Kunitake K.S. Vaughan J. Arias C.A.

The majority of differences between the sequences of the two receptors are found in their ECD1s. Mutagenesis studies have identified regions of the receptors that are important for differential recognition of agonists and small molecule antagonists, as well as for governing the ligand selectivity of the two types of receptors (22Dautzenberg F.M.

J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 388-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Binding data from chimeric receptors in which the ECD1 of CRFR1 is annealed to transmembrane domains of other receptors suggested the importance of the ECD1 in CRF/receptor interactions (28Perrin M.H. Sutton S. Bain D.B. Berggren T.W. Vale W.W. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 566-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 29Assil I.Q. Qi L.J. Arai M. Shomali M. Abou-Samra A.B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1187-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Further, a soluble protein corresponding to the ECD1 of CRFR1 expressed either in bacteria or mammalian cells binds astressin and urocortin with moderately high affinity (28Perrin M.H. Sutton S. Bain D.B. Berggren T.W. Vale W.W. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 566-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 30Hofmann B.A. Sydow S. Jahn O. Van Werven L. Liepold T. Eckart K. Spiess J. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2050-2062Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Recently, 5 amino acids have been identified in the ECD1 of the type 2 CRF receptor that appear to govern the differences in ligand recognition of the Xenopus and human receptors (31Dautzenberg F.M. Higelin J. Brauns O. Butscha B. Hauger R.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 1132-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Further understanding of the role of the ECD1 of CRFR2 in the binding of the CRF ligands may be gained from an investigation of their binding to the ECD1 isolated from the rest of the receptor. In this study, we present biochemical, biophysical, and functional characterization of a soluble protein corresponding to the ECD1 of mouse (m)CRFR2β. We find that the relative affinities of the CRF ligands for the soluble protein are similar to those for a chimeric receptor in which the ECD1 of CRFR2β is anchored in the plasma membrane by a single transmembrane domain of the type 1 activin receptor (32ten Dijke P. Ichijo H. Franzen P. Schulz P. Saras J. Toyoshima H. Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2879-2887PubMed Google Scholar). Further, we present the disulfide arrangement of the ECD1 and show that it is identical to that of the ECD1 for CRFR1. Finally, we show that ligand binding induces a conformational change in the protein. A cDNA encoding amino acids 27–134 of mCRFR2β was inserted into pET-32a(+) (Novagen) with KpnI and XhoI (pET-ECD1-CRFR2β), and the integrity of the construct was confirmed by automated sequencing. The E. coli strain, Origami trxB, gor(DE3)pLysS (Novagen) was chemically transformed according to manufacturer's directions using pET-ECD1-CRFR2β. Bacteria were grown to an A 600 nm = 0.6–1.0 and induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) for either 2.5 h at 37 °C or 16 h at 22 °C. The bacterial pellet was solubilized, sonicated in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, (10 ml/g of wet pellet), and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The soluble ECD1-CRFR2β, obtained as a thioredoxin fusion protein in the supernatant, was subjected to thrombin cleavage and enriched by affinity chromatography with S-protein-agarose (Novagen). After thrombin cleavage, ECD1-CRFR2β contains 24 additional amino acids at the N terminus derived, in part, from the S-(epitope) tag. The sequence of ECD1-CRFR2β is GSGMKETAAAKFERQHMDSPDLGT (mouse CRFR2β(27–134)) (the S-tag is underlined); the additional amino acids, GS and DLGT, are part of the thrombin cleavage site and theKpnI cloning site, respectively. The chimeric receptors in which amino acids 1–135 of mCRFR2β or amino acids 1–118 of rat CRFR1 replace the first 122 amino acids of the type 1B activin receptor, ECD1-CRFR2β/ALK4 or ECD1-CRFR1/ALK4, respectively, were generated by means of PCR as detailed previously (28Perrin M.H. Sutton S. Bain D.B. Berggren T.W. Vale W.W. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 566-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Astressin, cyclo(30–33)[d-Phe12,Nle21,38,Glu30, Lys33]rat/human CRF (12–41), was synthesized as described (33Gulyas J. Rivier C. Perrin M. Koerber S.C. Sutton S. Corrigan A. Lahrichi S.L. Craig A.G. Vale W. Rivier J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10575-10579Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Detailed synthetic procedures for the other peptides have been described (33Gulyas J. Rivier C. Perrin M. Koerber S.C. Sutton S. Corrigan A. Lahrichi S.L. Craig A.G. Vale W. Rivier J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10575-10579Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Radioiodination of [d-Tyr0]astressin has been reported previously (21Perrin M.H. Sutton S.W. Cervini L.A. Rivier J.E. Vale W.W. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 288: 729-734PubMed Google Scholar),and radioiodination of [Tyr0,Glu1,Nle17]sauvagine is similar to that of [d-Tyr0]astressin. Transfections and binding to membrane fractions were performed as described (28Perrin M.H. Sutton S. Bain D.B. Berggren T.W. Vale W.W. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 566-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The data for the chimeric receptors are from crude membrane fractions of COS-M6 cells transiently expressing the receptors; the data for the wild-type receptor are from crude membrane fractions of Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing mCRFR2β. For membrane binding, 5–10 μg of membrane protein/50 μl of assay buffer A (20 mm Na-HEPES, pH, 7.4, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 10% sucrose, 2 mm EGTA) were incubated with increasing concentrations of unlabeled peptides (50 μl of assay buffer) and [125I-d-Tyr0]astressin (∼200,000 cpm/50 μl of assay buffer A + 0.02% Triton) or [125I-Tyr0,Glu1,Nle17]sauvagine (∼100,000 cpm/50 μl of assay buffer A) in a final volume of 200 μl. For soluble protein binding, 0.2–0.5 μg of ECD1-CRFR2β/50 μl of assay buffer B (20 mm Na-HEPES, pH, 7.6, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) were incubated with increasing concentrations of unlabeled peptides (50 μl of assay buffer B) and [125I-d-Tyr0]astressin (∼200,000 cpm/50 μl of assay buffer B+ 0.02% Triton) in a final volume of 200 μl. Incubation proceeded for 90 min at room temperature in MAGV microtiter plates (Millipore) precoated with 0.1% polyethylenimine. The mixture was aspirated under vacuum, and the plates were washed twice with relevant assay buffer. The counts bound in the wells were quantified by γ-counting. To obtain theK i values, the competitive displacement data were analyzed by a non-linear regression analysis (GraphPad Prism program (GraphPad Softwares, Inc., San Diego CA)). All assays were performed in triplicate at least three times. The ECD1-CRFR2β (10 μg) was initially subjected to digestion by endoproteinase Asp-N (1 μg) in 50 mm MES at pH 6.2 for 16 h. A large fragment containing all 6 cysteine residues was isolated after HPLC purification. This fragment was analyzed by chemical sequence analysis and yielded three sequences beginning with residues Glu43, Asp65, and Glu105. The endoproteinase Asp-N fragment was further subjected to digestion by chymotrypsin, and fragments were again isolated after HPLC separation. The HPLC fractions were analyzed by MALDI-MS and by chemical sequence analysis. Two chymotryptic fragments were identified that contained cysteine residues. Fragment CT-1 exhibited an intense signal at m/z = 1655.71. Chemical sequence analysis yielded two major sequences corresponding to that of ECD1-CRFR2β: 101–109 (containing Cys103) and 60–64 (containing Cys60). The calculated monoisotopic mass (MH+) for this cystine-connected fragment is 1655.72 Da. The MALDI-MS spectrum of fragment CT-2 showed an intense signal atm/z = 2868.33. Chemical sequence analysis yielded two major sequences corresponding to residues 80–88 (containing Cys84) and 116–129 (containing Cys118). The calculated monoisotopic mass (MH+) for the cystine-connected fragment is 2868.35 Da. These fractions were reduced by treatment with tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) and reanalyzed by MALDI-MS. In both cases, the original signal diminished in intensity giving rise to signals corresponding to the individual cysteine-containing peptides. CD spectropolarimetry was conducted with an Aviv Model 62DS spectropolarimeter (Aviv Associates, Lakewood, NJ). Conditions were as follows: (a) low ionic strength case, 0.01 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 22.2 μm ECD1-CRFR2β neat or 20.0 μmECD1-CRFR2β + 20.0 μm astressin, temperature 20.5 ± 0.1 °C, wavelength range 185–260 nm, collection frequency of 1.0 nm/datum, integration time of 1.0 s, spectral bandwidth of 1.5 nm, averaging 5 repetitions/spectrum, quartz cell path length of 0.5 mm; (b) high ionic strength case, 0.15 m sodium chloride, 0.01 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 19.5 μm ECD1-CRFR2β, ± 19.5 μm astressin, all other conditions as in (a). No postcollection smoothing was applied to the CD data. Spectral deconvolution by the method of Bohmet al. (34Bohm G. Muhr R. Jaenicke R. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar) employed CDNN version 2.1 (bioinformatik.biochemtech.uni-halle.de/cdnn) and the supplied neural network based on the 33-member basis set. The ECD1-CRFR2β used for the CD measurements was purified and quantified by HPLC. In our previous work, we were able to express, in bacteria, milligram quantities of a functional soluble form of the ECD1 from CRFR1 (26Perrin M.H. Fischer W.H. Kunitake K.S. Craig A.G. Koerber S.C.

Further, we found that the amino acids corresponding to the putative signal peptide of the ECD1 were cleaved in the mature CRFR1, expressed in mammalian cells. We assume here that amino acids 1–26 of mCRFR2β encode its signal peptide and are absent in its mature protein. Accordingly, a cDNA encoding amino acids 27–134 of mCRFR2β was used to transform a strain of E. coli in which there is enhanced formation of disulfide bonds as a result of mutations in thioredoxin and glutathione reductase. The ECD1 was obtained as a soluble trx-fusion protein. Following thrombin cleavage, the soluble protein, ECD1-CRFR2β, was obtained. The protein contains 132 amino acids and comprises 108 amino acids of the ECD1, 15 amino acids encoding the S-(epitope) tag, and other amino acids from the thrombin cleavage site and the KpnI cloning site. Analyses, by SDS-PAGE, of the fusion protein and its thrombin cleavage products indicate that the apparent molecular size of the fusion protein is ∼29 kDa, the apparent molecular size of the trxtag is ∼14 kDa, and the apparent molecular size of the ECD1-CRFR2β is ∼15 kDa (data not shown). Mass-spectrometric analysis confirms the size of ECD1-CRFR2β: measured m/z = 14,944, calculated [MH]+ = 14,950 Da. An essential aspect of the biochemical characterization of ECD1-CRFR2β is an assessment of its affinity for the CRF family members. In Fig. 1 A, we show the competitive displacements by astressin, CRF, urocortins I, II, III, or sauvagine of [125I-d-Tyr0]astressin bound to ECD1-CRFR2β. For comparison, we also show the competitive displacements by the same ligands of [125I-d-Tyr0]astressin bound to the wild-type mCRFR2β stably expressed in CHO cells (Fig.1 B). The affinities of the agonists CRF, urocortin I, and urocortin II as well as of astressin for the soluble ECD1 are similar to their affinities for the complete receptor, whereas the affinities of urocortin III and sauvagine for ECD1-CRFR2β are much lower than their affinities for the wild-type mCRFR2β. To investigate the role of the ECD1 of mCRFR2β in the context of a membrane environment, we studied a chimeric receptor, ECD1-CRFR2β/ALK4, in which the ECD1 of mCRFR2β replaced the ECD of the type 1B activin receptor (ALK4), a single transmembrane receptor (32ten Dijke P.

The competitive displacements of125I-[d-Tyr0]astressin bound to this chimera by CRF family ligands are shown in Fig.2. Again, the relative potencies of CRF, urocortin I, urocortin II, and astressin are similar to their potencies for the full-length receptor, whereas both urocortin III and sauvagine have very low potencies; the affinities of the CRF family ligands for this chimeric receptor are nearly the same as those for ECD1-CRFR2β. Consistent with the lack of displacement of labeled astressin by nanomolar concentrations of unlabeled sauvagine is the absence of specific binding of [125I-Tyr0,Glu1,Nle17]sauvagine to either the ECD1-CRFR2β or the ECD1-CRFR2β/ALK4. These data are summarized in the first four rows of TableI. For comparison, binding to a chimeric receptor in which the ECD1 of CRFR1 replaces the ECD of ALK4 is also given. The low affinity binding of urocortin II and urocortin III for the chimera expressing the ECD1 of CRFR1 is in accord with the low affinity binding of these ligands for the full-length type 1 CRF receptor.Table IInhibitory binding constants, K i (nm), for CRF family ligands binding to various forms of CRF receptorsReceptorLigandAstressinrUcn ImUcn IImUcn IIIr/hCRFSauvagineECD1-CRFR2β1-aThe values are averages from at least three experiments determined by competitive displacement of [125I-dTyr0]astressin.10.7 (5.4 − 21.1)6.4 (4.7 − 8.7)6.9 (5.8 − 8.3)>20097 (22 − 430)>200ECD1-CRFR2β/ALK41-aThe values are averages from at least three experiments determined by competitive displacement of [125I-dTyr0]astressin.10.4 (8.8 − 12.3)5.4 (4.5 − 6.6)16.3 (9.7 − 27.4)>20079 (47 − 130)>200CRFR2β-CHO1-aThe values are averages from at least three experiments determined by competitive displacement of [125I-dTyr0]astressin.0.9 (0.4 − 1.9)1.3 (1.0 − 1.6)0.5 (0.4 − 0.6)23.4 (5.0 − 100)28 (13 − 62)11 (4 − 33)ECD1-CRFR1/ALK41-aThe values are averages from at least three experiments determined by competitive displacement of [125I-dTyr0]astressin.8.8 (6.7 − 11.7)14.1 (11.6 − 17.2)>200>20053.6 (25.7 − 112)>200CRFR2β-CHO1-bThe values are averages from at least three experiments determined by competitive displacement of [125I-Tyr0,Glu1,Nle17]sauvagine.0.62 (0.49 − 0.78)0.62 (0.14 − 2.8)0.66 (0.13 − 3.3)1.8 (0.8 − 4.1)6.2 (2.0 − 19)1.6 (0.7 − 3.8)1-a The values are averages from at least three experiments determined by competitive displacement of [125I-dTyr0]astressin.1-b The values are averages from at least three experiments determined by competitive displacement of [125I-Tyr0,Glu1,Nle17]sauvagine. Open table in a new tab Also, for comparison, we list in Table I (in the last row) the affinities derived from competitive displacement of labeled sauvagine bound to mCRFR2β. It can be seen that the calculated affinities of some, but not all, of the analogs are dependent on the analog used as the radiolabel. When determined by displacement of labeled astressin, the K i of sauvagine is ∼5 times greater, and that of urocortin III is ∼10 times greater than theirK i values determined from displacement of labeled sauvagine. To further characterize the soluble protein at a molecular level, we determined the Cys-Cys connectivity pattern. The disulfide arrangement of the ECD1-CRFR2β was determined by employing a strategy similar to the one used previously for the ECD1-CRFR1 protein (26Perrin M.H. Fischer W.H. Kunitake K.S. Craig A.G. Koerber S.C. Cervini L.A. Rivier J.E. Groppe J.C. Greenwald J. Moller Nielsen S. Vale W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31528-31534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The protein was digested by proteases that cleave between cysteine residues. The fragments were then isolated, analyzed by MALDI-MS, and subjected to chemical sequence analysis. Cystine-linked fragments exhibit a mass in MALDI-MS analysis corresponding to the sum of the cysteine-containing peptides. Chemical sequence analysis yields two sequences, again corresponding to the constituent peptides. Initial digestion with endoproteinase Asp-N was insufficient to cleave the cystine-containing core of the protein. Instead, three N termini were observed during sequence analysis. The analysis of chymotryptic fragments allowed the determination of two of the disulfide bridges. The fragment CT-1 was found to consist of the peptides 101–109 and 60–64 from mCRFR2β. This established a connection between Cys103 and Cys60. The other fragment, CT-2, consisted of peptides 80–88 and 116–129 and thereby established the connection between Cys84 and Cys118. The remaining connection between Cys45and Cys70 was established by sequence analysis of the original endoproteinase Asp-N digestion product. The presence of the three N termini at residues Glu43, Asp65, and Glu105 in a single species can only be explained by a connection between cysteine residues 45 and 70. A schematic representation of the disulfide pattern is shown in Fig.3. The overall pattern of cysteine connectivity is identical to that found in the ECD1 of CRFR1 (26Perrin M.H. Fischer W.H.

The behavior of ECD1-CRFR2β, attending ligand interaction, was studied by circular dichroism. Difference CD spectra were collected in the far UV (185–260 nm) of ECD1-CRFR2β in the absence and presence of astressin. The CD spectra of ECD1-CRFR2β in low ionic strength, physiological pH aqueous solution, or more physiological ionic strength (0.15 m sodium chloride, not shown) are equivalent and are dominated by the random coil with additional notable contributions from the antiparallel sheet and turn conformations (Fig.4). Deconvolution by the method of Bohm (34Bohm G. Muhr R. Jaenicke R. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar) resulted in contributions of 8.1, 16.3, 3.4, 24.8, and 46.8% for the helix, antiparallel, parallel, β-turn, and coil conformations, respectively. To determine the structural effects of ligand binding, ECD1-CRFR2β was incubated with equimolar astressin, and the spectrum of the resulting mixture was compared with the arithmetic sum of the spectra of the components Fig. 4. The resulting difference CD spectrum (Fig. 4, inset) clearly shows the formation of positive ellipticity with a peak near 192 nm and a slight increase in the magnitude of the negative ellipticity in the range 220–225 nm. Deconvolution of the spectrum of the mixture gives conformational contributions of 11.4, 28.7, 3.4, 26.0, and 31.4% for the helix, antiparallel, parallel, β-turn, and coil conformations, respectively. Thus, the deconvolution and graphical data suggest that when combined with astressin, ECD1-CRFR2β loses significant coil contribution (46.8–31.4%) with a concomitant increase in antiparallel sheet (16.3–28.7%) and to a much lesser extent helix (8.1–11.4%). Because the spectra shown in Fig. 4 were collected under equimolar conditions of protein and ligand, and because the residue ratio of ECD1-CRFR2β to astressin is 120:32, ∼80%"

Focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a tyrosine kinase, exhibits anti-apoptotic properties and is a potential target for degradation by caspase-3. This study tested the hypothesis that hsp72 interacts with FAK, preventing caspase-3-mediated degradation during ATP depletion. ATP depletion (5 mmNaCN and 5 mm 2-deoxy-d-glucose in the absence of medium glucose) caused FAK degradation within 15 min. FAK degradation was completely prevented by a caspase-3-specific inhibitor. HS induced the accumulation of hsp72, increased the interaction between hsp72 and FAK, and significantly inhibited FAK degradation during ATP depletion. Selective overexpression of wild-type hsp72 (but not hsp72ΔEEVD) reproduced the protective effects of HS on FAK cleavage. Purified hsp72 prevented the degradation of FAK by caspase-3 in vitro in a dose-dependent manner without affecting caspase-3 activity. Interaction between hsp72 and FAK is critical because both exogenous ATP and deletion of the substrate-binding site decreased protection of FAK by hsp72.

In this study, we hypothesized that hsp72, an inducible cytoprotective protein, prevents FAK cleavage by caspase-3 during ATP depletion. Our study shows that transient exposure to metabolic inhibitors results in the rapid proteolysis of FAK. Heat stress with recovery induced hsp72 and significantly inhibited FAK proteolysis during ATP depletion. Acute heat stress without recovery did not increase hsp72 content and failed to prevent FAK degradation in ATP-depleted cells. In intact cells, caspase-3 inhibition or the selective overexpression of hsp72 reproduced the protective effect of heat stress on FAK proteolysis. Wild-type hsp72 co-immunoprecipitated with FAK. Prior heat stress and ATP depletion markedly increased the interaction between hsp72 and FAK. In an in vitro assay, purified human caspase-3 produced virtually complete fragmentation of intact human FAK. Purified human hsp72 inhibited FAK cleavage by caspase-3 in a dose-dependent manner. Preservation of FAK was more striking in the absence of ATP and was not observed when the hsp72ΔEEVD deletion mutant was overexpressed, suggesting that interaction with hsp72 mediates protection of FAK. This study supports the hypothesis that hsp72 inhibits apoptosis, at least in part, by preventing caspase-3-mediated proteolysis of FAK.

To increase hsp72 content, cells were infected for 24 h at 37 °C with 3 × 107 plaque-forming units/35-mm2 Petri dish. hsp72ΔEEVD, a deletion mutant of hsp72 lacking the C-terminal EEVD sequence that is essential for peptide binding, was also overexpressed using adenovirus as previously described (18Mosser D.D. Caron A.W. Bourget L. Meriin A.B. Sherman M.Y. Morimoto R.I. Massie B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7146-7159Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). After removing the virus, cells were incubated for an additional 24 h. Infection efficiency was >95% as estimated by direct visualization of GFP. Preliminary experiments were performed to determine the amount of adenovirus and the incubation conditions required to approximate hsp72 content in heat-stressed cells as measured by immunoblot analysis (described below). Harvested cells were resuspended in cell lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, and 1% Triton-X-100) and a mixture of protease inhibitors (5 μm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride HCl, 10 nm leupeptin, 1.5 nm aprotinin, 10 nm E-64, and 5 μm EDTA, pH 7.40;Calbiochem-Novabiochem). The cells were sonicated and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. hsp72 (SPA-810,Stressgen Biotech Corp., Victoria, British Columbia, Canada), hsp70ΔEEVD (SPA-811, Stressgen Biotech Corp.), and FAK (BD Biosciences) were detected in the supernatant by immunoblotting using commercially available monoclonal antibodies. Specific protein bands were detected with an anti-IgG antibody coupled to a horseradish peroxidase-based enzyme-linked chemiluminescence system (Lumigolow, Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). After digitizing the image of each immunoblot (Desk Scan II, Hewlett-Packard Co.), band densities were quantified using NIH ImageQuant software. Immunoprecipitation of FAK using a specific monoclonal antibody (2 μg/mg of protein/ml of immunoprecipitation buffer; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was performed as recently described by us for cytochrome c (5Li F. Mao H.P. Ruchalski K.L. Wang Y.H. Choy W. Schwartz J.H. Borkan S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C917-C926Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Apyrase (10 units/ml), a compound that causes ATP hydrolysis, was used to prevent the ATP-mediated release of bound ligands from hsp72 (3Wang Y. Knowlton A.A. Christensen T.G. Shih T. Borkan S.C. Kidney Int. 1999; 55: 2224-2235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation was assessed by probing the membranes with an antibody directed against hsp72. Caspase-3 enzyme activity was measured as previously described by us (5Li F. Mao H.P. Ruchalski K.L. Wang Y.H. Choy W. Schwartz J.H. Borkan S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C917-C926Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) using a fluorometric assay (ApoAlert caspase-3 fluorescence assay, Clontech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. To assess caspase-3-specific activity, assays were also performed either without substrate or in the presence of a caspase-3-specific inhibitor (1 μl of DEVD-aldehyde; Clontech). In intact cells, FAK proteolysis was assessed by comparing the quantity of cleaved FAK by immunoblot analysis of homogenates obtained from control and ATP-depleted OK cells in the presence and absence of caspase-3 inhibition. Immunoblot analysis was performed with an antibody that detects both intact FAK (125 kDa) and FAK cleavage products between 70 and 80 kDa (BD Biosciences). To inhibit caspase-3, cells were treated with DEVD-aldehyde (100 μm) for 10 min prior to ATP depletion. Both attached and detached cells were collected and resuspended in cell lysis buffer as described above and then subjected to immunoblot analysis using an anti-FAK antibody. FAK was isolated from human kidney cells by immunoprecipitation (as described above for immunoprecipitation of proteins from OK cells) or obtained directly from whole cell lysates. FAK cleavage was assessed in this cell-free system by immunoblot analysis as described above. FAK was preincubated in the presence or absence of purified hsp72 (0.01–3 μg/60 μl; SPP-755, Stressgen Biotech Corp.) in reaction buffer (50 mmHepes, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% CHAPS, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 10 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.40) at 37 °C for 20 min. Purified human caspase-3 (100–200 ng; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) was then added, and the reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The final volume of the reaction mixture was 50–100 μl. Under these conditions, virtually complete (≥93%) FAK degradation was observed. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 4× SDS sample buffer. All samples were separated by 10–12% SDS-PAGE and transferred and immunoblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Protein concentrations were determined with a colorimetric dye binding assay (BCA assay, Pierce). Results are expressed in mg of protein/ml. Data are expressed as means ± S.E. Comparison of two groups was performed using one- or two-tailed Student's t test. Bonferroni's adjustment was applied to correct the p value when multiple tests were performed using a single control group. A result was considered significant ifp < 0.05. Exposure to metabolic inhibitors caused the de novoappearance of several FAK cleavage products with apparent molecular sizes of 70–90 kDa (Fig. 1A). Although virtually no FAK fragments were detected in control cells maintained at 37 °C (first lane), FAK proteolysis was evident after only 15 min of exposure to metabolic inhibitors (second lane). The magnitude of FAK degradation was greatest after 30 min. More prolonged ATP depletion (60–90 min) was associated with less immunoreactive FAK cleavage products (fourth andfifth lanes). Prior heat stress inhibited FAK degradation at all time points of ATP depletion (sixth throughtenth lanes). Prior heat stress significantly decreased FAK degradation after 15, 30, and 60 min of ATP depletion (p < 0.05 versus control) (Fig.1B). To confirm that in situ FAK proteolysis was mediated by caspase-3, a cell-permeable caspase-3-specific inhibitor was added prior to exposure to metabolic inhibitors. DEVD-CHO completely prevented the degradation of FAK after 30 min of ATP depletion (Fig. 1C). In contrast to FAK, ATP depletion minimally increased the proteolysis of paxillin, another regulatory focal adhesion protein that is susceptible to degradation by caspase-3 (39Hildebrand J.D. Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Unlike FAK, prior heat stress did not inhibit ATP depletion-mediated degradation of paxillin (Fig.2).Figure 2Effect of ATP depletion on paxillin fragmentation. Paxillin fragmentation was examined in control and previously heated OK cells immediately after 15–90 min of ATP depletion using an antibody that detects both intact paxillin (68 kDa) and its cleavage product (42 kDa). Each lane contains 20 μg of total protein. This immunoblot is representative of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine whether hsp72 per se inhibits FAK cleavage in heat-stressed cells subjected to ATP depletion, hsp72 content was selectively increased by transiently infecting renal epithelial cells with adenovirus encoding human hsp72. Exposure to an hsp72-expressing adenovirus increased hsp72 to a level similar to that observed after heat stress (Fig. 3A). Both heat stress and adenoviral infection resulted in a significant 5-fold increase in steady-state hsp72 content (Fig. 3B). Approximately 95–99% of the adenovirus-infected cells were positive for GFP (data not shown). Compared with control cells (infected with GFP- and tTA-encoding adenoviruses), increased expression of hsp72 inhibited FAK proteolysis after 15, 30, and 60 min of ATP depletion (Fig. 3C). The decrease in FAK degradation associated with selective hsp72 overexpression was significant at all three periods of ATP depletion (Fig. 3D). Of note, differences in the conditions of gel electrophoresis (10 versus 12%) accounted for the apparent alteration in the sizes of FAK fragments observed in Fig. 3C compared with Fig. 1A. The observation that hsp72 per se inhibited FAK proteolysis during ATP depletion suggests that hsp72 and FAK might interact with one another. Acute heat stress per se (42.5 °C for either 40 or 60 min) did not cause FAK degradation (Fig.4, first lanes versus seventh and tenth lanes). In contrast to heat stress with recovery, acute heat exposure without recovery did not prevent FAK degradation after 15 or 30 min of ATP depletion (Fig. 4A). In addition, acute heat stress without recovery did not increase steady-state hsp72 content (Fig. 4B). In control cells, interaction between hsp72 and FAK could not be detected by co-immunoprecipitation prior to ATP depletion (Fig.5A, upper panel), and only minimal interaction was observed after 15–60 min of ATP depletion (second through fourth lanes). In contrast, prior heat stress sufficient to increase hsp72 content increased the interaction between these two proteins at all time points (fifth through eighth lanes). Maximal interaction between hsp72 and FAK occurred after 30 min of ATP depletion (seventh lane). Increased interaction between hsp72 and FAK could not be attributed to differences in the amount of immunoprecipitable protein given that FAK content was virtually identical in each sample (Fig. 5A, lower panel). Because the content of intact FAK differed in control and heat-stressed cells subjected to ATP depletion, the amount of antibody used to immunoprecipitate FAK was calibrated to permit an equivalent yield of protein from both experimental groups. hsp72 content was similarly increased in all lysates obtained from cells subjected to heat stress (Fig. 5B). To examine the role of substrate binding in preventing FAK proteolysis, hsp72ΔEEVD, a mutant hsp72 protein that exhibits defective substrate binding (13Gabai V.L. Mabuchi K. Mosser D.D. Sherman M.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3415-3424Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 18Mosser D.D. Caron A.W. Bourget L. Meriin A.B. Sherman M.Y. Morimoto R.I. Massie B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7146-7159Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar), was selectively overexpressed in OK cells (Fig.6). In contrast to wild-type hsp72 (ninth through twelfth lanes), hsp72ΔEEVD (fifth through eighth lanes) failed to prevent FAK proteolysis in cells subjected to ATP depletion (Fig.6A) despite a marked increase in mutant hsp72 content (Fig.6B). Overexpression of hsp72ΔEEVD did not affect the steady-state content of wild-type hsp72 (Fig. 6C). If hsp72 prevented FAK proteolysis by caspase-3, then similar protection might be observed in vitro. To test this hypothesis, FAK was obtained from whole cell lysates (Fig.7A) or by immunoprecipitation using an anti-FAK antibody (Fig. 7B) from normal human kidney cells previously characterized as proximal tubule in origin (37Ryan M.J. Johnson G. Kirk J. Fuerstenberg S.M. Zager R.A. Torok-Storb B. Kidney Int. 1994; 45: 48-57Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). Both procedures yielded a single band at 125 kDa (Fig. 7,A and B, lanes 1). The addition of purified human hsp72 to FAK obtained from whole cell lysates did not alter the migration or content of FAK (Fig. 7A, lane 2). Exposure of FAK to purified human caspase-3 resulted in the formation of at least one major cleavage product (at ∼85 kDa) (lane 3). In contrast, co-incubation with human hsp72 reduced FAK degradation (lane 4). If hsp72 was preincubated with caspase-3 prior to the addition of FAK, FAK cleavage was not inhibited despite equivalent contact time between FAK and caspase-3 (lane 5). Similar results were obtained with FAK obtained by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 7B, lanes 2–4). Exogenous ATP (10 mm) resulted in a relative increase in FAK degradation by caspase-3 (lane 5). In contrast, ATP hydrolysis with apyrase (10 units/ml) (3Wang Y. Knowlton A.A. Christensen T.G. Shih T. Borkan S.C. Kidney Int. 1999; 55: 2224-2235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) increased the inhibitory effect of hsp72 on caspase-3-mediated FAK proteolysis (lane 6). Exposure of FAK to caspase-3 resulted in a 93% decrease in the content of intact FAK (Fig. 8,second lane). Wild-type hsp72 inhibited FAK degradation by caspase-3 in a dose-dependent manner at hsp72 concentrations between 2.3 and 700 nm (thirdthrough sixth lanes). The correlation coefficient for the relationship between the dose of hsp72 and the degree of protection of intact FAK was 0.979 as assessed by densitometry of the 125-kDa bands in Fig. 8. To examine the possibility that hsp72 interfered with caspase-3,in vitro enzyme activity was compared in the presence and absence of purified hsp72. The addition of either 1 or 3 μg of hsp72 (130 and 400 nm) did not alter the activity of purified caspase-3 (Fig. 9). These results are in agreement with a previous report showing that purified hsp70 has no effect on the activity of caspase-3 (40Mosser D.D. Caron A.W. Bourget L. Denis-Larose C. Massie B. Mol. Cell.

Key target genes in this process include master regulators of the cell cycle, such as cyclin E, which regulates G1progression, and cyclin A, which is required for the initiation of DNA synthesis. In the present work, we present novel evidence that a second G1 cyclin, cyclin D3, is also potently activated by E2F1. First, an estrogen receptor-E2F1 fusion protein (ER-E2F1) potently activates the endogenous cyclin D3 mRNA upon treatment with 4-hydroxytamoxifen, which induces nuclear accumulation of the otherwise cytosolic fusion protein. Furthermore, trans-activation of cyclin D3 by ER-E2F1 occurs even in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide and thus appears direct. Second, all of the growth-stimulatory members of the E2F family (E2F1, -2, and -3A) potently activate a cyclin D3 promoter reporter, whereas growth-restraining members of the family (E2F4, -5, and -6) have little effect. Third, recombinant E2F1 binds with high affinity to the cyclin D3 promoter in vitro. Fourth, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate that endogenous E2F1 is associated with the cyclin D3 promoter in vivo. Finally, mapping experiments localize the essential E2F regulatory element of the cyclin D3 promoter to a noncanonical E2F site in the promoter between nucleotides −143 and −135 relative to the initiating methionine codon. We conclude that in addition to cyclins E and A, E2F family members can also activate one member of the D-type cyclins, further contributing to the ability of the stimulatory E2F family members to drive cellular proliferation.

Quiescent cells express the G1 cyclins at minimal levels; however, upon mitogenic stimulation, the D-type cyclins are transcriptionally activated, and their levels rise as cells traverse G1 (4Sherr C.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3689-3695PubMed Google Scholar). In the prevailing model (3Ho A. Dowdy S.F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), it is thought that the D-type cyclins direct the limited phosphorylation of Rb via their interactions with cyclin-dependent kinases (5Ezhevsky S.A. Nagahara H. Vocero-Akbani A.M. Gius D.R. Wei M.C. Dowdy S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10699-10704Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 6Ezhevsky S.A. Ho A. Becker-Hapak M.

Cell. 1993; 73: 487-497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Rb by the D-type cyclin-cyclin-dependent kinases complexes permits the release of DNA-E2F-Rb-bound histone deacetylase proteins, which impart a dominant transcriptional repressing activity to promoter-bound Rb-E2F complexes (8Zhang H.S.

Loss of histone deacetylase-mediated inhibition allows a modest transcriptional activation of certain Rb-silenced genes, including cyclin E (9Ohtani K. DeGregori J. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The combined activities of E2F1, -2, and -3A then lead to the potent activation of a large number of genes that are required for nucleotide biosynthesis, the firing of origins of replication, and the completion of replicative DNA synthesis (22Muller H.

Biophys. 2002; 399: 212-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In this paradigm, E2F activates transcription of cyclin E, which then further activates E2F by stimulating the phosphorylation of Rb. This positive feedback loop leads to an irreversible commitment to entry into S phase at the restriction point (25Pardee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 1286-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). In previous work, we showed that ectopic expression of E2F1 alone is sufficient to stimulate quiescent cells to enter cell cycle (26Johnson D.G. Schwarz J.K. Cress W.D. Nevins J.R. Nature. 1993; 365: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar) and that stable expression of E2F1 can lead to oncogenic transformation (27Johnson D.G. Cress W.D. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12823-12827Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Subsequently, we utilized microarray technology to screen for genes that could account for the ability of E2F to induce cellular proliferation (24Ma Y. Croxton R.L. Moorer Jr., R.L. Cress W.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 399: 212-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and apoptosis (28Croxton R.L. Ma Y. Song L. Haura E.B. Cress W.D. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1359-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 29Croxton R.L. Ma Y. Cress W.D. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1563-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In addition to verifying several known E2F targets, our microarray screen suggested that E2F1 potently activates cyclin D3 transcription. Cyclins D1 and D2 were not activated by E2F1 expression in this screen. Here we verify that cyclin D3 is indeed a direct E2F-regulated transcript, and we localize the E2F regulatory element of the cyclin D3 promoter within a small and extremely GC-rich region in the vicinity of the major transcriptional start site. We conclude that in addition to cyclins E and A, E2F family members can also activate one member of the D-type cyclins, further contributing to the ability of E2F to drive the G1 to S phase transition. Human cyclin D3 promoter fragments were generated by PCR from genomic DNA, ligated into pGL3 basic vector, and sequenced. Initial PCR primers were designed to amplify 1023 bp (−1017/+6) of the published cyclin D3 promoter sequence (30Brooks A.R. Shiffman D. Chan C.S. Brooks E.E. Milner P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9090-9099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), which are numbered relative to the ATG codon at +1. The forward (−1017F) and reverse (+6R) PCR primers for the full-length promoter were 5′-GGGGACGCGTAGATCTCACAGAGTCTGTGCA-3′ and 5′-GGGGCTCGAGCTCCATACTCGGGGCAGCGAA-3′, respectively. The forward primer added a MluI site, and the reverse primer added aXhoI site to facilitate subcloning. Deletion mutants of the cyclin D3 promoter construct (−362/+6, −202/+6, −159/+6, and −115/+6) were generated using reverse primer +6R with the following forward primers: 5′-GGCCGGTACCACCTCCTAGAAAGTTCTCT-3′ (−362F), 5′-GGCCGGTACCGAGCATTCCACGGTTGCTA-3′ (−202F), 5′-GGGGGGTACCTGTCAGGGAAGCGGCGCG-3′ (−159F) and 5′-GGGGGGTACCGGATCCGCCGCGCAGTGCCAG-3′ (−115F), respectively. Each of these primers added a KpnI restriction site for subcloning. Promoter deletion mutants −202/−146, −202/−134, and −202/−112 were generated using primer −202F in combination with primers 5′-GGGGAAGCTTCCCTGACAGGCGCCCCG-3′ (−146R), 5′-CCCCAAGCTTCGCGCGCGCGCCGCTTCCCTG-3′ (−134R) and 5′-GGGGAAGCTTGGATCCCCAGCCCGCCCGCCG-3′ (−112R), respectively.

H1299 cells obtained from Dr. Jiandong Chen (Moffitt Cancer Center) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 57 fetal bovine serum. H1299 cells were transfected with pcDNA3-ER-E2F1 plasmid using the calcium phosphate method, and stable transfectants were selected with G418 (0.5 mg/ml). G418-resistant colonies were isolated after 2 weeks and expanded in the continued presence of 0.25 mg/ml G418. ER-E2F1-positive lines were identified by Western blot using anti-hemagglutinin and anti-E2F1 antibodies. H1299-pcDNA3 stable cell lines were established by the same method and served as negative controls. 4-Hydroxytamoxifen (HT1; 300 nm) was added to the medium to induce rapid ER-E2F1 nuclear accumulation of the ER-E2F1 protein. Cycloheximide (CHX) was used at a final concentration of 10 ॖg/ml to block new protein synthesis. Apoptosis and cell cycle parameters were measured by flow cytometry using an Apo-BrdU Kit (DB PharMingen) as previously described (32Ma Y. Cress W.D. Haura E.B. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2003; 2: 73-81PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from 5 × 106 H1299 cells using the RNAeasy mini kit (Qiagen). RNase protection assays were carried out with the Riboquant hCYC1 (cyclin family) multiprobe templates (BD PharMingen). Briefly, the multiprobe templates were synthesized by in vitro transcription with incorporation of [32P]dUTP and purified on Quick Spin RNA columns (Roche Applied Science). Labeled probe (1× 106cpm) was hybridized with 10 ॖg of total RNA through a temperature gradient of 90 to 56 °C over a 16-h period. Unprotected probe was removed by RNase digestion at 30 °C for 1 h followed by separation of protected RNA fragments on a 57 polyacrylamide-urea gel and detection using autoradiography. Transfections were performed using calcium phosphate with test DNAs totaling 20 ॖg of DNA per 100-cm dish. Transfections included 300 ng of expression plasmid (pcDNA3-based vectors), 10 ॖg of reporter firefly luciferase reporter plasmid (pGL3, Promega), 2 ॖg ofRenilla luciferase reporter plasmid (pRL-TK, Promega), and carrier DNA (sheared salmon sperm DNA) to equal 20 ॖg of total DNA in each transfection. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and luciferase assays were performed using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System following the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). Experiments were done in triplicate, and the relative activities and S.E. values were determined. To control for transfection efficiency, firefly luciferase values were normalized to the values forRenilla luciferase. Western blots were performed as previously described (28Croxton R.L. Ma Y. Song L. Haura E.B. Cress W.D. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1359-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) using monoclonal antibodies against cyclin D3 (14781A; BD PharMingen). Western blots were stripped and reprobed with an antibody to actin (A5441; Sigma) to ensure equivalent loading. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and antibody supershift assays were performed as previously described. Briefly, EMSA assays included 20 ॖg of total protein extract from E2F1-DP1 baculovirus-infected Sf9 or uninfected Sf9 cells. EMSA probes were generated by restriction digestion of the appropriate luciferase reporter plasmids (−202/+6,KpnI/XhoI; −202/−146,KpnI/HindIII; −202/−112,KpnI/BamHI; −159/+6,KpnI/XhoI; −115/+6,BamHI/XhoI; −159/−112,KpnI/BamHI). [α-32P]dATP was incorporated into band-purified DNA fragments using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. E2F consensus (sc-2507; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and E2F mutant consensus (sc-2508; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) competitor oligonucleotides were added at 20 ng/10-ॖl reaction (100-fold excess). An E2F1 monoclonal antibody (sc-251; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used to identify the putative E2F1-DP1 complex. The 15-bp competitor oligonucleotides used in Fig. 5C were desalted, annealed, and used in competition assays without further purification. The sequences of the upper strands of the competitor oligonucleotides were as follows: 1 (5′-GTACCGGCGCGCGCG-3′), 2 (5′-GGCGCGCGCGCGGGC-3′), 3 (5′-GCGCGCGGGCGGCGG-3′), 4 (5′-CGGGCGGCGGGCGGG-3′), 5 (5′-GGCGGGCGGGCTGGG-3′), 6 (5′-GCGGGCTGGGGATCC-3′), 7 (5′-CTGGGGATCCAAGCT-3′), and C15 (5′-AAGTTTCGCGCCCTT-3′). For reference, the boldface letters in each oligonucleotide represent the key E2F1 regulatory element as determined in Fig. 5 (although oligonucleotide 3 contains part of the sequence, it does not bind E2F; thus, the element is apparently too close to the 5′-end of the oligonucleotide to bind E2F. Underlined bases in the oligonucleotides listed above are not from the cyclin D3 promoter but represent cloning sites that were present in the relevant luciferase vectors. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed as previously described (16Wells J. Boyd K.E. Fry C.J. Bartley S.M. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5797-5807Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 28Croxton R.L. Ma Y. Song L. Haura E.B. Cress W.D. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1359-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Briefly, asynchronously growing H1299 cells were treated with formaldehyde to create protein-DNA cross-links, and the cross-linked chromatin was then extracted, diluted with ChIP buffer, and sheared by sonication. After preclearing with protein A beads, blocked with 17 salmon sperm DNA and 17 bovine serum albumin, the chromatin was divided into equal samples for immunoprecipitation with either anti-E2F1 polyclonal antibody (sc-193; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-RhoA polyclonal antibody (sc-179; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or no antibody. The immunoprecipitates were pelleted by centrifugation, and heating reversed the cross-linking. After proteins and any contaminating RNA were removed by treatment with proteinase K and RNase, PCR primers (−202F and +6R) that generate a 230-bp product were used to detect the presence of specific DNA sequences. PCR primers corresponding to the human actin promoter (negative control) were previously described (15Takahashi Y. Rayman J.B. Dynlacht B.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 804-816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous microarray analysis utilized an adenovirus to express E2F1; thus, it was possible that the activation of the cyclin D3 promoter was a secondary consequence of E2F1 expression. To verify that activation of cyclin D3 by E2F1 was direct, we created a cell line that constitutively expresses a hemagglutinin-tagged estrogen receptor-E2F1 fusion protein (ER-E2F1). In this construct, E2F1 is fused to a transcriptionally inactive mutant of the murine estrogen receptor that is unable to bind estrogen yet retains high affinity for HT. In the absence of HT, the ER-E2F1 fusion protein is excluded from the nucleus and thus cannot directly affect transcription. Upon the addition of HT, however, the fusion protein rapidly enters the nucleus and induces transcription of E2F1 target genes. The advantage of this system is that, since the fusion protein is preexisting when HT is added, induction can occur in the absence of new protein synthesis. Therefore, promoters that are activated upon HT addition in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor CHX are most likely regulated by a direct mechanism. ER-E2F1-expressing H1299 cell lines were derived by transfecting the pcDNA3-ER-E2F1 plasmid followed by selection in G418. After G418-resistant colonies were isolated and screened by Western blot with both hemagglutinin and E2F1 antibodies (data not shown), five colonies expressing detectable levels of the ER-E2F1 protein were chosen for further experiments. For negative controls, G418-resistant cell lines were also derived with the empty pcDNA3 plasmid. To identify the ER-E2F1 cell line with the tightest HT regulation, the five ER-E2F1-expressing lines were transfected with an E2F reporter plasmid in which the adenovirus E2 promoter was fused to firefly luciferase. Following transfection, HT (or solvent control) was added to induce nuclear accumulation of ER-E2F1. Fig.1A shows that all five ER-E2F1 positive cell lines induced the reporter gene upon the addition of HT. Cell line H1299-ER-E2F1–15, which produced the most dramatic response (a 9-fold induction), was selected for subsequent experiments. As expected, H1299-pcDNA3 control cells did not activate the Ad E2 promoter in response to HT. To determine whether the ER-E2F1 fusion protein in ER-E2F1–15 was expressed at sufficient levels to alter cell growth properties, cell cycle parameters were determined before and after the addition of HT. As demonstrated in Fig. 1B, a 48-h treatment with HT resulted in a 157 increase in the fraction of cells in S phase and a corresponding decrease in cells in G0/G1. In addition to its ability to induce S phase, E2F1 is also a potent inducer of apoptosis. Not surprisingly, Fig. 1B reveals that nearly 247 of H1299-ER-E2F1–15 cells underwent apoptosis after 48 h of HT treatment, whereas less than 17 of the cells were apoptotic in the absence of HT (Fig. 1B). Thus, the ER-E2F1 fusion protein expressed in H1299-ER-E2F1–15 cells functioned as expected in the presence of HT. To verify direct activation of the cyclin D3 promoter by E2F1, the cell line ER-E2F1–15 and a control line (pcDNA3) were treated with solvent only, CHX alone, HT alone, or a combination of both CHX and HT. Following 16 h of treatment, cyclin D3 message levels were measured by an RNase protection assay. Fig.2A reveals that the cyclin D3 mRNA increased dramatically in the presence of HT alone and even more dramatically in the presence of both HT and cycloheximide. Since immediate early mRNAs such as cyclin D3 are stabilized in the presence of cycloheximide, the observed effects of cycloheximide alone or in combination with HT are expected (33Lau L.F. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1182-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the induction of the cyclin D3 mRNA is a direct effect of the ER-E2F1 fusion protein and does not involve synthesis of another protein that is activated or repressed by E2F1. Cyclin D3 protein expression was also measured by Western blot. In Fig. 2B, 48 h after drug treatment, the cyclin D3 protein was also induced in the presence of HT, reflecting the increase in mRNA. Levels of cyclin D3 mRNA and protein did not change in response to HT in the control cell line, as expected. These results demonstrate that cyclin D3 is a direct target of E2F1. In contrast to cyclin D3, cyclin D1 and D2 were repressed following HT treatment (data not shown). To determine whether the activation of cyclin D3 expression by E2F1 was mediated via the promoter, we used luciferase reporter constructs to examine the effect of E2F1 expression on the level of transcription from the cyclin D3 promoter. Previous analysis (30Brooks A.R. Shiffman D. Chan C.S. Brooks E.E. Milner P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9090-9099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) has mapped the cyclin D3 promoter to a region from nucleotide position −1017 to +6 relative to the ATG start codon. To identify E2F1-responsive elements, we tested luciferase reporter activity of three cyclin D3 promoter constructs (−1017/+6, −362/+6, and −202/+6). As demonstrated in Fig.3A, transient co-transfection of E2F1 resulted in strong activation of all three of the cyclin D3 promoter constructs. The smallest of these constructs (−202/+6) was fully responsive to exogenous E2F, suggesting that this small region contains the E2F1-responsive element. Previous studies using various E2F1 mutants have demonstrated that both the DNA-binding domain and the transcriptional activation/Rb-binding domains of E2F1 are required for trans-activation to occur. To determine whether both of these functional domains are required for cyclin D3 promoter activation, two previously described E2F1 mutant proteins were tested for the ability to activate the cyclin D3 promoter. The first was E2F1E132, which lacks the ability to bind DNA (34Cress W.D. Johnson D.G. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6314-6325Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and the second was E2F11–284, which lacks the trans-activation domain (35Cress W.D. Nevins J.R. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4213-4219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Cress W.D. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2119-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). As expected, both E2F1 mutants had diminished ability to trans-activate the cyclin D3 promoter (Fig. 3B), demonstrating that activation of the cyclin D3 promoter is dependent on the ability of E2F1 to bind DNA and to activate transcription. Based upon structural and functional relatedness and on cell cycle expression pattern, the E2F family members are classified into two major subfamilies (37Trimarchi J.M. Lees J.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar): the growth-promoting E2Fs (including E2F1, -2, and -3A) and the growth-restraining E2Fs (including E2F3B, -4, -5, and -6). Growth-promoting E2Fs are primarily expressed at the G1/S boundary and are capable of driving quiescent fibroblasts into S phase upon overexpression. In contrast, the growth-restraining E2Fs are expressed constitutively during the cell cycle and induce S phase less efficiently or not at all when overexpressed. To determine which of the E2Fs most potently modulate the cyclin D3 promoter, several E2F family members were tested in luciferase reporter assays. Fig. 3C shows that the cyclin D3 promoter is most potently activated by the growth-promoting E2Fs (especially E2F1 and E2F2), whereas growth-restraining E2Fs have much smaller effects, if any. These results suggest that cyclin D3 is a target of multiple growth-promoting E2F1s and is not an E2F1-specific target. The experiments described above utilized ectopic E2F expression, which is subject to the concern that the observed regulation is not physiological. Thus, ChIP assays were performed on native H1299 cells to ascertain whether endogenous E2F1 binds to the cyclin D3 promoter in vivo. As shown in Fig.4A, PCR primers that span the region of −202 to +6 of the cyclin D3 promoter clearly detect cyclin D3 promoter DNA in ChIP samples generated using an E2F1 antibody. However, chromatin immunoprecipitations with either an irrelevant antibody (anti-RhoA) or no added antibody resulted in the absence of detectable cyclin D3 promoter DNA. PCR primers specific for the human actin promoter (negative control) did not detect actin promoter DNA in E2F1 ChIP samples, as expected from previous work demonstrating that E2F1 does not bind the actin promoter (15Takahashi Y. Rayman J.B. Dynlacht B.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 804-816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data demonstrate that E2F1 associates with the cyclin D3 promoter under physiological conditions. As a complementary approach to ChIP assays, an EMSA was performed to determine whether recombinant E2F1-DP1 would bind the cyclin D3 −202/+6 promoter region in vitro. Fig. 4Bdemonstrates that recombinant E2F1-DP1 present in extracts of Sf9 cells co-infected with E2F1- and DP1-expressing baculoviruses (38Tao Y. Kassatly R.F. Cress W.D. Horowitz J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6994-7007Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) binds to the cyclin D3 −202/+6 promoter fragment, whereas no such binding activity is detectable in uninfected Sf9 cell extracts. The addition of an excess of double-stranded oligonucleotides containing a consensus E2F1 binding site (WT) abolished formation of the E2F1-DP1 complex on the cyclin D3 promoter, whereas the addition of a mutated version (MT) of the consensus oligonucleotide had no effect. The addition of an E2F1 antibody (100 ng) resulted in the retarded mobility of the putative E2F1-DP1-cyclin D3 promoter complex. Together, these data support the conclusion that E2F1 activates cyclin D3 via direct binding to the promoter in a manner dependent upon its transcriptional activation domain. To further define the E2F1-responsive region of the cyclin D3 promoter, we generated several additional promoter constructs. Constructs −202/−146, −202/−134, and −202/−112 possessed deletions from the 3′-end of the promoter. Fig.5A reveals that deletion of sequences downstream of −134 did not abolish induction by E2F1; in fact, constructs −202/−134 and −202/−112 were both activated nearly 4-fold by E2F1. However further deletion to −146 (−202/−146) abolished the E2F1 response. Constructs −159/+6 and −115/+6 had additional nucleotides deleted from the 5′-end of the promoter. Fig.5A reveals that deletion of sequences upstream of −159 (−159/+6) had little effect on the E2F1 response. In contrast, further deletion of sequences upstream of −115 (−115/+6) abolished E2F1 responsiveness. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the critical E2F1-responsive elemen"

Four GlyR genes encoding ligand binding α subunits (α1-α4) and a single gene for the structural औ subunit are known in vertebrates (for review see Refs. 1Kuhse J. Betz H. Kirsch J. Curr. Opin.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4711-4721Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Like other proteins of the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily, GlyR subunits are multispanning (polytopic) type I membrane proteins with an N-terminal cleavable signal sequence, which targets the nascent polypeptide to the ER and drives its insertion into the lipid bilayer. Mature GlyR subunits as released by signal peptidase cleavage are modular polypeptides, composed of 1) a large glycosylated N-terminal ectodomain that forms the agonist binding site; 2) four transmembrane segments (M1-M4), which between M1 and M3 are connected by short hydrophilic loops and between M3 and M4 by a large cytoplasmic loop of ∼85 amino acids (designated M3-M4 loop in this paper); and 3) a short extracellular C-terminal tail. The classic model of how multispanning membrane proteins insert cotranslationally into the ER membrane assumes that the overall topology of the mature protein is determined by the orientation of the signal sequence, which is inserted first and initiates the translocation of the following peptide segments (9Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1496-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar, 10Rapoport T.A. Jungnickel B. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 271-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Accordingly, downstream hydrophobic sequences simply serve as alternate stop transfer and signal anchor sequences, which cause the nascent polypeptide to passively follow the lead of the preceding transmembrane segment and thereby direct the sequential insertion of polytopic proteins. In prokaryotes, the transmembrane orientation of the most N-terminal hydrophobic sequence, i.e. the cleavable signal sequence in case of type I proteins, has been found to depend on the flanking charged residues; the more positively charged end is retained on the cytoplasmic (Cis) side of the membrane, as described by the “inside- or Cis-positive rule” (11Von Heijne G. Gavel Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 174: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Electrostatic interaction of arginine and lysine residues with negatively charged head groups of phospholipids (12van Klompenburg W. Nilsson I. Von Heijne G. de Kruijff B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4261-4266Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), and, at least in prokaryotes, the negative-inside transmembrane potential (13Andersson H. Von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2267-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) determines the transmembrane orientation. Because of their low average degree of ionization at physiological pH, histidines have almost no effect on peptide topology (14Andersson H. Bakker E. Von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1491-1495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Negatively charged residues affect the topology of prokaryotic proteins only when present in high numbers (15Nilsson I. Von Heijne G. Cell. 1990; 62: 1135-1141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In contrast, the orientation of the first transmembrane segment of eukaryotic proteins correlates best with the charge difference hypothesis, which considers both positively and negatively charged amino acids by proposing that a net negative cytoplasmic charge dictates a luminal disposition (16Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5786-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Besides charges, the length and hydrophobicity of the signal sequence (17Sato T. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Omura T. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2391-2397Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 18Wahlberg J.M.

Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), have all been documented to affect transmembrane topology. Experimental support for the classical insertion model has been provided for a variety of membrane proteins (20Wessels H.P. Spiess M.

There is, however, increasing evidence that the initial translocation events may not necessarily dictate the topology of the entire mature protein (24Wilkinson B.M. Critchley A.J. Stirling C.J. J.

Rather, additional topogenic sequence information in subsequent transmembrane segments or internal loops appears to be required for the correct positioning of some transmembrane segments of multispanning proteins (for a recent review see Ref. 27Goder V. Spiess M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 504: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In this paper, we show that a cluster of basic residues located in the cytoplasmic loop of the GlyR α1 subunit approximately eight residues C-terminal to the transmembrane segment M3 constitutes an important determinant of proper membrane insertion. Based on the usage of three naturally occurring, though normally inaccessibleN-glycosylation sites of the M3-M4 loop, we demonstrate that the unbiased orientation of M3 and the ensuing hydrophilic loop depends on the presence of these positively charged residues. The other positively charged amino acids of the M3-M4 loop located outside of this basic cluster exert little or no effect, indicating that a high density of positive charges rather than a net charge difference determines topology. The cDNA construct encoding α1-His with a C-terminal hexahistidyl tag (His) has been described previously (8Griffon N. Büttner C. Nicke A. Kuhse J. Schmalzing G. Betz H.

All amino acids were numbered according to their position in the mature protein sequence. Defolliculated Xenopusoocytes were injected with ∼50-nl aliquots of capped cRNAs (0.5 ॖg/ॖl) and kept at 19 °C in sterile frog Ringer's solution (90 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) supplemented with 50 mg/liter gentamycin as described (28Schmalzing G. Gloor S. Omay H. Kröner S. Appelhans H. Schwarz W. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). One to three days after cRNA injection, glycine responses were measured by two-electrode voltage-clamp recording at a holding potential of −70 mV as described previously (4Kuhse J. Laube B. Magalei D. Betz H. Neuron. 1993; 11: 1049-1056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). cRNA-injected and non-injected control oocytes were metabolically labeled by overnight incubation with l-[35S]methionine (>40 TBq/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) at about 100 MBq/ml (0.1 MBq per oocyte) in frog Ringer's solution at 19 °C and chased with 1 mm unlabeled methionine as indicated. His-tagged proteins were then purified by Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) chromatography from digitonin (17) (w/v) extracts of oocytes as detailed previously (29Nicke A. Bäumert H.G. Rettinger J. Eichele A. Lambrecht G. Mutschler E. Schmalzing G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3016-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) with the following modification. Iodoacetamide was routinely included at 10 and 1 mm in the lysis and washing buffers, respectively, to prevent artificial cross-linking of polypeptides by disulfide bonds. Bound proteins were released from the Ni2+-NTA-agarose with non-denaturing elution buffer consisting of 0.57 (w/v) digitonin and 250 mmimidazole/HCl, pH 7.6, and kept at 0 °C until analyzed by PAGE. For SDS-PAGE or Tricine-PAGE (30Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10457) Google Scholar), proteins were supplemented with the appropriate SDS sample buffer containing 20 mmdithiothreitol and electrophoresed in parallel with [14C]labeled molecular mass markers (Rainbow; Amersham Biosciences) on linear SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Where indicated, samples were treated prior to SDS-PAGE with either endoglycosidase H (Endo H) or peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F; both enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs) in the presence of 17 (w/v) Nonidet P-40 to counteract SDS inactivation of PNGase F. BN-PAGE (31Schägger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar) was performed as described previously (29Nicke A. Bäumert H.G. Rettinger J. Eichele A. Lambrecht G. Mutschler E. Schmalzing G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3016-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) immediately after protein purification. Purified proteins were supplemented with blue native sample buffer to final concentrations of 107 (v/v) glycerol, 0.27 (w/v) Serva blue G, and 20 mmsodium 6-amino-n-caproate and applied onto polyacrylamide gradient slab gels. Where indicated, samples were treated prior to BN-PAGE with 8 m urea to induce partial dissociation of receptor complexes into lower order intermediates. Both SDS- and BN-polyacrylamide gels were fixed, dried, and exposed to BioMax MS film (Eastman Kodak Co.) at −80 °C. For quantification, the dried gels were exposed to a PhosphorImager screen and scanned using a Storm 820 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Individual bands were quantified with the ImageQuant software. Between the M3 and M4 segments, the GlyR α1 polypeptide contains a cytoplasmic loop of ∼85 amino acids that includes a total of 23 basic (ten Lys, ten Arg, three His) and nine acidic (three Asp, six Glu) residues (Fig.1A). Particularly remarkable is a cluster of basic amino acids, 316RFRRKRRHHK, a few residues downstream to M3. To examine a possible functional role of this sequence motif, we replaced four or seven of its basic residues by alanines, yielding 316AAAAARRHHK (316–320A-α1-His mutant) or 316AAAAAAAHHA (316–322,325A-α1-His mutant), respectively (Fig.1B). Two-electrode voltage-clamp analysis ofXenopus oocytes injected with the respective mutant cRNAs revealed no effect of these alanine replacements on the shape of the glycine-induced currents or on glycine potency (results not shown). However, a statistically significant reduction of the amplitude of the maximal current elicited by glycine from 4.7 ± 1.2 to 2.3 ± 0.8 ॖA was observed for the 316–320A-α1-His receptor as compared with the parent α1-His receptor, respectively, in three independent experiments, each with five to ten oocytes. Next we compared the synthesis and post-translational processing of the parent α1-His GlyR and the charge neutralization mutants. The parent α1-His polypeptide isolated as a control migrated as a single band at 48 kDa when analyzed by reducing Tricine-PAGE subsequent to isolation by Ni2+-NTA-agarose chromatography from [35S]methionine-labeled Xenopus oocytes (Fig.2, A and B,lane 1). Treatment with Endo H reduced the mass of the α1-His subunit isolated directly after the pulse by 3 kDa to the 45-kDa protein core (Fig. 2B, lane 2). This mass shift is consistent with the presence of a single N-glycan, resulting from usage of the sole N-glycosylation motif,38NVS, in the N-terminal extracellular domain of the α1 polypeptide (Fig. 1A) (8Griffon N. Büttner C. Nicke A. Kuhse J. Schmalzing G. Betz H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4711-4721Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). After replacement of the acceptor Asn38 by glutamine, the α1-His polypeptide migrated at 45 kDa, and no mass shift upon Endo H treatment was observed (results not shown). In contrast to the parent α1-His polypeptide, both the 316–320A-α1-His and the316–322,325A-α1-His mutants migrated as double bands of apparent masses of 48 and 54 kDa when analyzed under the same conditions (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 3). Strikingly, Endo H treatment of the 316–320A-α1-His (Fig. 2B, lane 5) and the316–322,325A-α1-His (not shown) mutants shifted both the 48- and the 54-kDa polypeptides to the 45-kDa α1-His protein core. The same result was obtained with PNGase F (Fig. 2B,lane 6). This indicates that the 48- and the 54-kDa polypeptides possess the same protein mass but differ in their number of N-glycans. To determine the number of N-glycans that give rise to the 54-kDa polypeptide, the 316–320A-α1-His mutant was incubated with increasing concentrations of Endo H (Fig. 2C,lanes 7–12). Because of partial deglycosylation at intermediate Endo H concentrations, a ladder-like pattern of four bands was generated (lanes 8 and 9). Neighboring bands differ in mass by 3 kDa, the mass of an N-linked oligosaccharide side chain. The 45-kDa band represents the core protein, whereas the 48-, 51-, and 54-kDa bands correspond to polypeptides with one, two, and three N-glycans, respectively. Because 38NVS is the only potential acceptor site for N-linked glycosylation on the extracellular part of the α1-His polypeptide, the two additional N-glycans must originate from usage of other endogenous sequons that are topologically inaccessible in the non-mutated GlyR α1 polypeptide. Indeed, the GlyR α1 subunit sequence carries a total of four consensusN-glycosylation sites, three of which reside on the cytoplasmic M3-M4 loop, 335NFS, 358NNS, and361NTT (cf. Fig. 1A). These sites should be glycosylated only when the M3-M4 loop translocates into the ER lumen, thus allowing for formation of the hyperglycosylated 54-kDa form. The glycosylation of only two of the three sequons of the M3-M4 loop could signify either that one of the closely adjacent sequons358NNS and 361NTT remains unused for steric or other reasons or that acceptor Asn335 is exposed to the cytoplasm. To discriminate between these possibilities, we substituted Asn335 of the 318,321A-α1-His mutant with glutamine. The 318,321A-α1-His mutant behaved virtually identical to the 316–320A-α1-His mutant (Fig.2D, lane 2) (see also below). Consistent with the occupancy of Asn335 of the 54-kDa form with anN-glycan, elimination of Asn335 resulted in a 3-kDa shift to 51 kDa (Fig. 2D, lane 3). After further 3-kDa shift was observed when 358NNS and361NTT were simultaneously eliminated in addition to Asn335 (Fig. 2D, lane 4). This indicates that the two N-glycans of the M3-M4 loop of the 54-kDa α1-His mutant polypeptides are located at Asn335and Asn358 (or Asn361), each contributing a 3-kDa oligosaccharide side chain to the total mass of 54 kDa. Because of the highly polar nature of the amino acid residues between the end of M3 (position 307) and Asn335, the simultaneous usage of both Asn335 and Asn358 (or Asn361) further implies that virtually the entire M3-M4 loop was translocated into the ER lumen upon charge neutralization in mutants. Accordingly, the preceding lipophilic segment, M3, fails to integrate properly into the membrane upon neutralization of positive charges of the M3-M4 loop. To analyze the effect of a mixed topology of the M3-M4 loop on subunit assembly, we resolved natively purified α1-His mutants by BN-PAGE, a method which displays the oligomeric nature of receptor proteins (8Griffon N. Büttner C. Nicke A. Kuhse J. Schmalzing G. Betz H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4711-4721Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 32Nicke A. Rettinger J. Mutschler E. Schmalzing G. J. Recept. Signal. Transduct. Res. 1999; 19: 493-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Regardless of the number of basic charges neutralized downstream to M3, all mutants analyzed migrated as perfectly assembled homopentamers when the [35S]methionine pulse was followed by an overnight chase interval (results not shown). If, however, the GlyRs were purified directly after a 4-h [35S]methionine pulse, a propensity of the mutants to aggregate became apparent, as indicated by the appearance of high molecular weight α1-His protein that migrated at a broad range of masses above that of the pentameric receptor (Fig. 3A). Quantitative scanning of the protein bands resolved by BN-PAGE showed also that the wild-type GlyR α1-His subunits existed partially in an aggregated form shortly after synthesis (Fig. 3B). However, the amount of aggregates was markedly higher when one charge of the basic cluster downstream of M3 was neutralized (R319A, K320A; see lanes 3 and 5) and increased further upon neutralization of four basic charges (RFRRK316–320AFAAA; see lane 7). Most likely, these aggregates are formed primarily of α1 subunits with luminally exposed M3-M4 loop. The aggregates of both the wild-type and the mutant GlyR α1 subunits disappeared during a subsequent chase interval despite the continued presence of the hyperglycosylated 54-kDa form (not shown) (cf. Fig. 3C). Evidently, the luminally exposed M3-M4 loop delays but does not prevent proper GlyR assembly. The lack of a marked effect of the wrongly folded M3-M4 loop on assembly can be reconciled with the known location of the assembly domains of ligand-gated ion channel subunits in the N-terminal ectodomain (1Kuhse J. Betz H. Kirsch J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 318-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). To examine whether α1-His GlyRs with aberrantly folded M3-M4 loop are able to leave the ER, we exploited that N-glycans in general become complex-glycosylated and hence resistant to Endo H during passage of the Golgi apparatus en route to the cell surface. Accordingly, the glycosylation status of the 48- and the 54-kDa polypeptides was determined after a chase interval (Fig.3C). Consistent with previous observations, the wild-type 48-kDa α1-His chain was entirely Endo H-resistant when isolated after a 24-h chase interval (Fig. 3C, lane 2). In contrast, the hyperglycosylated 54-kDa polypeptide generated from the316–320A-α1-His construct persisted entirely in the Endo H-sensitive form, indicating that α1-His chains with aberrantly folded M3-M4 loop are incapable of leaving the ER. This view is supported by a relative decrease in the amounts of the additional 35- and 13-kDa polypeptides, which represent proteolytic cleavage products generated in a lysosomal compartment from GlyRs that are endocytotically retrieved from the cell surface, and hence are indicative of the plasma membrane insertion of GlyRs (33Büttner C. Sadtler S. Leyendecker A. Laube B. Griffon N. Betz H. Schmalzing G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42978-42985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Quantification by PhosphorImager analysis revealed that 577 of the wild-type α1-His subunit, but only 167 of the316–320A-α1-His mutant, was proteolytically cleaved into the 35- and 13-kDa products. We conclude from these results that GlyRs with aberrantly folded M3-M4 loop are not exported to the cell surface. To determine how many basic residues can be removed without disturbing membrane topology, GlyR α1 mutants with only one or two alanine substitutions in the 316RFRRKRRHHK motif were generated. Surprisingly, substitution of only a single basic residue was already sufficient to create a mixed topology of the M3-M4 loop, as evidenced by the synthesis of the hyperglycosylated 54-kDa polypeptide (Fig.4A). The faint 54-kDa band isolated with the parent GlyR α1-His subunit indicates that even a minor portion of the wild-type α1 subunit adopts the incorrectly folded conformation (Fig. 4A, lane 1; see also Fig. 2D, lane 1). Quantification by PhosphorImager analysis revealed that 5–107 wild-type α1 subunits possessed a luminally oriented M3-M4 loop shortly after synthesis. Quantification by PhosphorImager analysis of the 48- and 54-kDa bands revealed a striking positional effect of single charge neutralizations of the M3-M4 loop. Neutralization of Lys320, located at a distance of ∼12 residues from the end of the M3 domain (cf. Fig. 1), produced the largest effect among all single mutants investigated, with a fraction of 487 aberrantly folded 54-kDa polypeptide (Fig. 4C). To examine the effect of charge neutralization over the entire M3-M4 loop, a set of double mutants was generated in which two consecutive positively charged amino acids were systematically replaced by alanine. The aberrantly folded 54-kDa polypeptide was most abundant relative to the normal 48-kDa polypeptide when Arg318 and Arg321 or Arg319 and Lys320 were neutralized by alanine substitution (Fig. 4, B (lane 8) and D). Thus, the positive charges in the center of the basic cluster are of particular importance for the topology of the M3-M4 loop. Neutralization of >two positive charges within the cluster (up to seven positive charges as in the316–322,325A-α1-His mutant; see Fig. 4B,lane 3) did not further increase the relative amount of the 54-kDa polypeptide. Notably, charge neutralizations close to the M3 segment (Fig. 4B, lane 6) or in the C-terminal half of the M3-M4 loop (lanes 11–14) had only little or no effect. Even when a total of five basic residues was replaced by alanines in the C-terminal half of the M3-M4 loop, no 54-kDa polypeptide was formed (lane 15). In a further attempt to assess the role of charges for the disposition of the M3-M4 loop, we used the 318,321A-α1-His-mutant to also neutralize three negative charges, EDE, at positions 326–329 immediately downstream of the basic cluster. The resulting318,321,326–328A-α1-His mutant displayed a mixed topology of the M3-M4 loop (Fig. 4B, lane 5). Quantification revealed a relative decrease of the misfolded 54-kDa polypeptide from 607 (parent 318,321A-α1-His mutant) to 487 (318,321,326–328A-α1-His mutant), indicating that increasing the net charge difference (positive charges minus negative charges) can only partially compensate for neutralization of residues within the basic cluster. The presence of several positive charges on both sides of a transmembrane segment can prevent its membrane insertion (34Gafvelin G. Von Heijne G. Cell. 1994; 77: 401-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We, therefore, considered that positively charged residues in the 14-amino acid-long hydrophilic loop connecting M2 and M3 may impede membrane insertion of M3 in our charge neutralization mutants. Indeed, alanine substitution of one of these charges, Lys276 or Lys281 (Fig. 1C), markedly reduced the fraction of newly synthesized318,321A-α1-His mutant with luminal M3-M4 loop orientation (Fig. 5, A(lanes 3 and 4) and B). Simultaneous neutralization of both Lys276 and Lys281 almost fully abolished formation of the 54-kDa polypeptide (lane 5), suggesting that the basic cytoplasmic cluster C-terminal to M3 is required to counteract the three basic charges in the M2-M3 ectodomain. Two-electrode voltage-clamp measurements in oocytes demonstrated that the K276A and K281A mutations result in 29-fold decrease in glycine potency (Fig. 5C). A related mutation, K276A, which is associated with startle disease, a rare neurological disorder, is known to produce a similar substantial decrease in glycine sensitivity (35Langosch D. Laube B. Rundstrom N. Schmieden V. Bormann J. Betz H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4223-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) by impairing the opening of the channel rather than the binding of glycine (36Lewis T.M. Sivilotti L.G. Colquhoun D. Gardiner R.M. Schoepfer R. Rees M. J. Physiol. 1998; 507: 25-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The present study shows that the correct topology of the M3-M4 loop of the GlyR α1 subunit depends on a cluster of positively charged residues, 316RXRRKRR, immediately downstream of the hydrophobic region M3. If one or more positive charges are neutralized within this motif, the GlyR α1 subunit adopts two topologies, the correct one with the hydrophobic region M3 spanning the membrane and the connecting loop being localized cytoplasmically, and an aberrant one with M3 being non-spanning and the M3-M4 loop being translocated into the ER lumen. This indicates that the cluster of basic residues contains topogenic information. Both the correctly and the incorrectly folded α1-His subunits assembled to homopentamers, but solely homopentamers consisting of correctly folded α1 subunits were exported to the plasma membrane, suggesting that the aberrant M3-M4 loop is recognized by the cellular quality control system. Also, when in our experiments the metabolic labeling period was followed by a 20-h chase, the intensity of the aberrant 54-kDa polypeptide decreased relative to that of the correctly folded α1 subunit. Together these data indicate that incorrectly folded receptor proteins are not only unable to reach the plasma membrane but are also subject to increased proteolytic degradation. The plasma membrane-bound mutant GlyRs, on the other hand, exhibited an electrophysiological phenotype identical to that of the parent α1 GlyR, indicating that the basic charges C-terminal to M3 are not directly involved in receptor functioning. According to the classic model of membrane integration of polytopic proteins, the hydrophobic M3 region should follow the lead of the preceding transmembrane segment, M2. Because M2 has a Ncyt-Cexo orientation, M3 should adopt passively the opposite Nexo-Ccyt orientation, thus acting as a stop-transfer sequence that halts further translocation of the polypeptide chain across the membrane. Here, failure of the M3 segment of 30–807 of the newly synthesized α1 chains to span the membrane was demonstrated by the aberrantN-glycosylation of the M3-M4 loop after neutralization of one or more basic residues 8–14 amino acids downstream to the C-terminal end of the M3 region. This indicates that proper membrane integration of the apolar M3 region depends critically on the presence of the highly charged basic motif. A similar role of positively charged residues in halting translocation of a hydrophobic segment has been described previously (37Kuroiwa T. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Omura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9251-9255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is increasing evidence for polytopic proteins that topogenic information is not restricted to the most N-terminal hydrophobic domain but spread throughout the protein (for a recent review see Ref. 27Goder V. Spiess M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 504: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). One of the determinants is apparently the transmembrane distribution of positive charges, which prevent not only the translocation of N- and C-terminal segments (38Zhang J.T. Lee C.H. Duthie M. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1742-1746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) but also of connecting loops of polytopic membrane proteins (39Sato M. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24721-24725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In addition, internal loops of polytopic membrane proteins have on average a higher content of positively charged residues as compared with external ones (23Gafvelin G. Sakaguchi M. Andersson H. Von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6119-6127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The failure of the hydrophobic M3 region to integrate into the membrane after neutralization of only a single positively charged residue was nevertheless unexpected, because seven positively charged residues are left within the 15 residues flanking the C-terminal end of the hydrophobic M3 region. When considering all charges within the flanking 15-residue windows on each side of the M3 segment, there remains a marked net positive charge difference Δ(C-N) of +4 (with net charges of +2 and +6, respectively) for the single charge neutralization mutants. According to the charge difference rule, this should be more than sufficient to dictate an Nexo-Ccytorientation of a signal anchor sequence. However, despite this excess of positive charges only a minor fraction of the M3 segment adopted the correct Nexo-Ccyt orientation, and most of the M3-M4 loop was translocated incorrectly. This is also surprising in view of an excess of 11 positive charges within the entire M3-M4 loop, which harbors a total of 20 positively and nine negatively charged residues. In conclusion, neither the charge difference rule nor the positive inside rule provide any indication for a biased topology of the apolar M3 domain subsequent to neutralization of one or several positive charges of the cluster. This suggests that the M3 segment by itself is unable to reliably halt translocation. Hydropathy analysis based on the Kyte-Doolittle algorithm with a window of five amino acids provided no indication that the M3 domain may not be sufficiently hydrophobic to partition by itself into the lipid bilayer. From our observation that unbiased folding can be restored by neutralization of positive charges on the M2-M3 ectodomain, we infer that the positive charges on the M2-M3 ectodomain prevent the M3 domain from positioning itself correctly. The three positive amino acids of the 14-amino acid-long M2-M3 loop may impose constraints to the M3 segment to adopt a Ncyt-Cexo orientation, which is obviously incompatible with the Ncyt-Cexoorientation of the preceding M2 domain. Therefore, the hydrophobic M3 domain may remain in an unstable state unless the downstream topogenic cluster of basic residues imposes the correct Nexo-Ccyt orientation. The extreme sensitivity of M3 transmembrane orientation to neutralization of single basic residues within the 316RXRRKRR sequence suggests that the particular high density of positive charges is essential for keeping the M3-M4 loop on the Cis-side of the membrane. Hence, the basic cluster seems to serve as an accessory cytoplasmic stop-transfer signal which, by blocking translocation of the M3-M4 loop, forces the apolar M3 segment to insert properly into the membrane. Once inserted, hydrophobic interactions with the lipid bilayer may suffice to stabilize the M3 domain in the correct Nexo-Ccyt orientation. Positive charges appear to be more easily translocated through the ER than through bacterial membranes, most likely because of the absence of a membrane potential in the ER (23Gafvelin G. Sakaguchi M. Andersson H. Von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6119-6127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Our findings imply that the more frequent translocation of positive charges in eukaryotic systems requires additional topogenic signals, such as the basic cluster described here. Interestingly, clusters of basic charges have been shown recently (40Juretic D. Zoranic L. Zucic D. J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci. 2002; 42: 620-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) by computer analysis to occur more frequently in cytoplasmic loops of proteins near the cytoplasmic membrane surface than predicted from the abundance of Arg and Lys residues. It is likely that topogenic basic clusters act through electrostatic interactions with negative charges of lipids or proteins (or both). Proteins of the translocation machinery appear not to harbor relevant charged residues (27Goder V. Spiess M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 504: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), but anionic phospholipids, at least in prokaryotes, are determinants of membrane protein topology because of the electrostatic interaction of their head groups with arginine and lysine residues (12van Klompenburg W. Nilsson I. Von Heijne G. de Kruijff B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4261-4266Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar,41Gallusser A. Kuhn A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2723-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 42Bogdanov M. Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2107-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Interestingly, successful solubilization of the GlyR but not nicotinic acetylcholine receptors has been found to depend stringently on the presence of exogenous phospholipids (43Pfeiffer F. Betz H. Brain Res. 1981; 226: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This is consistent with a role of lipids in the conformational stabilization of GlyR subunits. Whether the topogenic basic cluster identified here contributes to phospholipid stabilization of GlyR structure by ensuring its proper topology remains to be determined.

Chem. 1996; 271: 12082-12087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The cardiac-enriched factors GATA4 and serum response factor (SRF) are synergistic activators of CPT-1औ expression (3Moore M.L. Wang G.-L. Belaguli N.S. Schwartz R.J. McMillin J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1026-1033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Because metabolic substrate preference shifts with hypertrophy and failure, recent studies have focused on the identification of transcription factors capable of transmitting nutritional as well as pathological messages into changes in gene transcription.Fatty-acid induction of gene expression through peroxisome proliferator activator receptor-α (PPARα) binding to the muscle-specific form of CPT-1औ has been extensively studied (4Mascaro C.

However, the ratCPT-1औ gene is only modestly induced by physiological levels of fatty acids (6Wang G.L. Moore M.L. McMillin J.B. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 609-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and CPT-1औ message is increased 2-fold in rodent models of fasting and diabetes where circulating fatty acids are elevated (7Cook G.A.

The PPARα-mediated regulation of several genes is enhanced by the PPARγ coactivator-1 (PGC-1). PGC-1 is highly expressed in metabolically active tissues including brown fat, skeletal muscle, and heart (8Knutti D. Kralli A. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 360-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar).

PGC-1 is a coactivator for many factors in the nuclear hormone receptor family including PPARα, the glucocorticoid receptor, the thyroid hormone receptor, and several orphan receptors (9Puigserver P.

These combinatorial interactions upregulate the expression of fatty acid oxidation, oxidative phosphorylation, and tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes as well as uncoupling proteins in response to cold, fasting, or exercise (8Knutti D. Kralli A. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 360-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). PGC-1 also physically interacts with myocyte enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C) to upregulate GLUT4 expression and glucose uptake in L6 cells that were overexpressing PGC-1 (13Michael L.F. Wu Z. Cheatham R.B. Puigserver P. Adelmant G. Lehman J.J. Kelly D.P. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3820-3825Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Associations with negative binding partners have been proposed but no specific proteins have yet been identified (14Knutti D. Kressler D. Kralli A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Roeder R.G. Cell. 1985; 43: 165-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). In the heart, USF proteins regulate the expression of energy transfer and contractile-responsive sarcomeric genes (16Qin W. Khuchua Z. Klein S.C. Strauss A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25210-25216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We have shown that USF heterodimers bind to two E-box sites within the CPT-1औpromoter. However, the regulatory significance of USF in the context of this gene is unknown (3Moore M.L. Wang G.-L. Belaguli N.S. Schwartz R.J. McMillin J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1026-1033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Although USF is expressed ubiquitously, the relative amount of USF proteins varies with tissue type (17Sirito M. Lin Q. Maity T. Sawadogo M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Alterations in USF protein stoichiometry may be involved in regulating different sets of genes. While a high degree of amino acid conservation characterizes their dimerization and DNA binding sequences, their extreme divergence in N-terminal amino acid sequences could direct selective contacts for a variety of transcription factors (17Sirito M. Lin Q. Maity T. Sawadogo M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar).Here, we have examined the regulation of the CPT-1औgene by PGC-1 and USF proteins. We found that PGC-1 stimulates CPT-1औ expression through interactions with MEF2A. Furthermore, the induction by PGC-1 and MEF2A is inhibited by USF. We demonstrate that PCG-1 and USF proteins can physically interact. Our results demonstrate that PCG-1 is a powerful stimulator of a key regulatory protein in long chain fatty acid oxidation in the heart and suggest a novel role for USF in modulating PGC-1 action on the CPT-1औ gene.RESULTSOur first experiments examined the relative affinity of nuclear protein binding to the E-boxes in the CPT-1 promoter. We have previously shown that USF1 and 2 bind to the E-box sequences from the CPT-1औ promoter as heterodimers (3Moore M.L. Wang G.-L. Belaguli N.S. Schwartz R.J. McMillin J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1026-1033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The consensus E-box element −252 robustly binds USF proteins (Fig.1, lane 2). The E-box element −315 requires additional nuclear extract from cardiac myocytes to produce a similar band (Fig. 1, compare lane 2, 2-ॖl nuclear extract versus lane 8, 5-ॖl nuclear extract). To examine further the relative binding strengths of the two E-box regions, increasing concentrations of the unlabeled alternate DNA sequence were added to the gel shift binding reaction. Residual USF binding persists on element −252 even in the presence of 100-fold molar excess of the unlabeled −315 sequence (Fig. 1, lanes 3–5). However, a 25-fold excess of −252 competitor is sufficient to compete all protein binding to the E-box −315 (Fig. 1, lanes 9–11). Consistent with its consensus sequence, E-box −252 is the stronger USF binding site. However, E-box-315 also binds USF with lower affinity.To define a regulatory role for USF proteins with theCPT-1औ gene, both USF1 and USF2 were transfected into CV-1 fibroblasts with the CPT-1औ luciferase reporter construct. A model of binding sites in the CPT-1औ promoter is shown in Fig.2, top panel. Expression of the CPT-1औ promoter increased 15.8 ± 1.5-fold by USF overexpression (Fig. 2). Co-transfection of a vector with the N-terminal activation domain of USF2 deleted (Fig. 2,USFΔN) significantly reduced USF1/USF2 up-regulation of the CPT-1औ construct. Removal of the DNA binding/dimerization domain of USF2 (Fig. 2, USFΔB) diminished promoter activation by 6.5 ± 0.9-fold (p < 0.0001). A weaker functional inhibition by USFΔN compared with USFΔB may be, in part, due to reduced expression of the former construct in CV-1 cells (Fig. 2,inset). Therefore, USF proteins can activate CPT-1औ in CV-1 fibroblasts and requires intact protein structure to regulate gene expression.Figure 2Domain deletions within the USF2 protein abrogate function in CV-1 cells.Top, diagram of theCPT-1औ promoter is shown and the key regulatory elements identified. Early passage CV-1 fibroblasts were co-transfected with 1 ॖg each −391/+80 wild-type reporter, USF1, USF2, USF2ΔN, or USF2ΔB as indicated.

Biol. 1999; 19: 1508-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), we wished to determine whether similar effects of USF-1 on CPT-1औ would be observed in cardiac myocytes. We transfected out CPT-1औ-luciferase into cardiac myocytes with the USF expression vectors. In cardiac myocytes, mutation of E-box −315 increases promoter activity 2.2 ± 0.2-fold (p < 0.01), suggesting that USF proteins function to suppress CPT-1औgene expression in this cell type. Consistent with this idea, overexpression of USF1 and USF2 in cardiac myocytes reduces CPT-1औ luciferase expression to less than 407 of basal activity (Fig.3). Substitution of a DNA binding-deficient mutant USF2 for the wild-type factor does not affect USF2-mediated suppression. However, truncation of the N-terminal domain returns luciferase values to baseline, suggesting that the suppressor activity of USF2 may be localized in this region (Fig. 3). The finding of opposite effects of USF overexpression in CV-1 fibroblastsversus cardiac myocytes suggests that USF-mediated repression of CPT-1औ reporter gene expression requires USF interactions with myocyte-enriched factors.Figure 3Overexpression of USF proteins inhibits activity of the CPT-1औ promoter construct.Myocytes were co-transfected as described with 1 ॖg of −391/+80 reporter gene construct.

Physiol. 2002; 29: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In CPT-1औ, the PPRE is flanked by the two E-box motifs, and this region also contains the myocyte-specific (MEF2) site that binds MEF2A and MEF2C (3Moore M.L. Wang G.-L. Belaguli N.S. Schwartz R.J. McMillin J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1026-1033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To identify potential cell-specific interactions, we first investigated the effects of USF on the PGC-1 regulation of the CPT-1औpromoter in neonatal cardiac myocytes. Transfection of PGC-1-stimulated reporter activity in cardiac myocytes in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A). Overexpression of USF proteins in the myocyte culture completely blunted the PGC-1 induction of CPT-1औ and returned expression to basal levels (Fig. 4B). To determine the interactions by which USF interferes with PGC-1 function in cardiac myocytes, we investigated this regulatory motif for myocyte-specific proteins,e.g. MEF-2, that are known to recruit the latter cofactor (13Michael L.F. Wu Z. Cheatham R.B. Puigserver P. Adelmant G. Lehman J.J. Kelly D.P. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Therefore, to determine the magnitude of MEF2A and PGC-1 regulation of CPT-1औ, these expression vectors were co-transfected into a cardiac-null fibroblast cell line, CV-1. Here, MEF2A synergistically and significantly co-activates PGC-1 induction of CPT-1औ reporter gene expression by greater than 40-fold (Fig. 5). Because USF prevented PGC-1 activation of CPT-1औ luciferase expression in cardiac myocytes (Fig. 4), we asked whether the bHLH factor could also interfere with PGC-1/MEF2A synergy. Addition of USF1 and 2 expression vectors abolished synergy and decreased PGC-1/MEF2A activation by greater than 607 (Fig. 5). Substitution of either serum response factor (SRF), or the cardiac-enriched factor, Nkx2.5, for USF does not affect PGC-1/MEF2A synergy (Table I). To determine if USF proteins might be interfering with the ability of MEF2A to stimulate CPT-1औ, we cotransfected CPT-1औ-Luc with expression vectors for USF proteins and MEF2A. USF1/2 alone stimulated −391/+80 CPT-1औ-Luc 4.3 ± 0.6-fold, while MEF2A stimulated 1.7 ± 0.15-fold. When both USF and MEF2A were transfected, the CPT-1औ-Luc vector was stimulated 6.1 ± 0.65-fold. These data indicate that USF represses CPT-1औpromoter activity by blocking synergistic interactions between PGC-1 and the muscle-specific transcription factor, MEF2A.Figure 5PGC-1 and MEF2A synergistic activation ofCPT-1औ is sensitive to USF1/2 overexpression. Subconfluent CV-1 cells were transfected as described with 1 ॖg of reporter, 0.5 ॖg PGC-1, 0.5 ॖg MEF2A, and 0.25 ॖg each USF1 and USF2, as indicated.

Data are expressed as percent reduction in the magnitude of synergistic activation compared to empty vector controls. Open table in a new tab To confirm that E-box-binding proteins could alter PGC-1/MEF2A interactions, reporter constructs with mutations in either or both E-box elements were transfected with the synergistic combination into CV-1 cells. Individual E-box mutations in either E-box −315 or E-box −252 increased synergy to 69 ± 4- and 82 ± 7-fold, respectively (versus 43 ± 3-fold for wild type, Fig.6). The double E-box mutant showed an even greater response to PGC-1/MEF2A, i.e. 117 ± 8-fold induction (Fig. 6). PGC-1/MEF2A synergistic activation of the double E-box mutant construct remained sensitive to USF overexpression (Table I), suggesting that direct DNA binding was not essential for USF modulation of PGC-1/MEF2A interactions. Therefore, based on these data, USF appears to function by regulating MEF2 recruitment of cofactors like PGC-1.Figure 6PGC-1/MEF2A synergy is enhanced by E-box sequence mutation.

Co-immunoprecipitation experiments with anti-USF2 IP of neonatal rat cardiac myocyte extract revealed PGC-1 interactions following immunoblots with anti-PGC-1 antibodies (Fig.7A, IP). Anti-USF2 IP of neonatal rat cardiac myocyte extract revealed PGC-1 interactions following immunoblot with anti-PGC-1 antibodies (Fig. 7A,IB). PGC-1 protein was also detected in control anti-MEF2 immunoprecipitates but not anti-actin precipitates (data not shown). To confirm USF2/PGC-1 interaction, anti-GST immunoprecipitation with PGC-1-GST fusion protein and USF2 TnT products also revealed the presence of USF2 protein (Fig. 7A). IP reactions with unprogrammed TNT products did not pull-down USF2 protein (data not shown). We also conducted GST-PGC-1 pull-down experiments using bacterially expressed GST-PGC-1 and [35S]methionine-labeled USF-1 or USF-2. As is shown in Fig. 7B, the full-length PGC-1 or PGC-1 vectors containing either amino acids 1–400 or 1–170 were able to pull-down USF-1 and USF-2. GST alone did not interact with either isoform of USF. These data indicate that USF proteins can interact with peptides within the first 170 amino acids of PGC-1.Figure 7PGC-1 and USF2 physically interact.A, co-immunoprecipitation (IP) with MEF2 and USF antibodies was performed with protein extracts from cultured, neonatal rat cardiac myocyte as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Antibodies used for Western immunoblot analysis (IB) are listed on the left hand side of the gel. In the GST lane, PGC-1 fused to GST was incubated with GST antibodies and USF2 TNT reaction products. Proteins bound to Sepharose beads were released by boiling and analyzed by Western blot. Input lane contained 5–107 of the total protein used for the immunoprecipitation. Nonspecific bands detected by the PGC-1 antibody in the input lane were removed during the washing steps and are not present in the final IP lanes.B, GST-PGC-1 was prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” [35S]USF-1 or [35S]USF-2 were incubated with GST-PGC proteins of varying lengths in in vitro pull-downs.

Since CPT-1औ regulates fatty acid entry into औ-oxidation, this enzyme has a prominent role in modulating changes in fuel selection. Long term adaptive responses extend beyond localized adjustments in enzyme activity from changes in the malonyl-CoA pool. Metabolic up-regulation of CPT-1औgene expression by fatty acids occurs through the ligand-dependent activation of PPARα binding to a PPRE motif in the promoter region of human (5Brandt J.M. Djouadi F. Kelly D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23786-23792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) and rat CPT-1औ (6Wang G.L. Moore M.L. McMillin J.B. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 609-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The stimulation of genes encoding proteins involved in cardiac fatty acid transport and metabolism by long chain fatty acids is well documented (5Brandt J.M. Djouadi F. Kelly D.P. J. Biol.

Van Bilsen M. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 41-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, the ratCPT-1औ promoter is only moderately increased in neonatal cardiac myocytes exposed to physiological concentrations of oleate (6Wang G.L. Moore M.L. McMillin J.B. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 609-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Cotransfection of PPARα and PGC-1 into NIH3T3 cells stimulated luciferase genes driven by the promoters of the humanCPT-1औ or mouse MCAD genes (10Vega R.B. Huss J.M. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1868-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). Here we show that CPT-1औ gene expression is activated in cardiac myocytes in a concentration-dependent manner by overexpression of PGC-1.Our data indicate that PGC-1 will induce CPT-1औ through interactions with MEF2C. Since the MEF2A and PPARα binding sites are adjacent in the rat CPT-1औ promoter, we believe that both factors will recruit PCG-1 to the CPT-1औ promoter and induce high expression of CPT-1औ in the heart. In fact, PPARα and MEF2C interact with different regions of PGC-1 allowing for the possibility that PGC-1 could physically interact with both proteins simultaneously. MEF2C interacts with amino acids in the 400–570 region of PGC-1 (8Knutti D. Kralli A. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 360-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), while PPARα interacts with the LXXLL peptide motif at amino acids 142–146 of PGC-1 (10Vega R.B. Huss J.M. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1868-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). The MEF2C and PPARα binding sites in the CPT-1औ promoter are flanked by E-boxes that bind USF proteins. Our results indicate that the USF proteins can disrupt the synergistic stimulation between MEF2C and PGC-1. The ability of USF to interfere with the transcriptional cooperation of PGC-1 and MEF2C may stem from the specific architecture of the CPT-1औpromoter. Further studies are needed to determine if the inhibition of PGC-1 transactivation by USF proteins is a general phenomenon or is mediated in a gene-specific and tissue-specific manner.The up-regulation of metabolic genes critical to mitochondrial energy production in the heart is controlled by factors binding to conserved regulatory motifs found in heart and striated muscle, including the GATA and MEF2 elements and the CArG and E-boxes.

In this study, we sought to determine specifically the consequences of ATF4 expression on mammary gland development in transgenic mice. Overexpression of ATF4 severely impaired normal development of the mammary gland, which was associated with reduced proliferation and differentiation of mammary alveolar epithelium and up-regulation of p21WAF1 and p27Kip1. In addition, there was also impaired lactation accompanied by decreased expression of α-lactoalbumin, whey acidic protein, and औ-casein, possibly because of the down-regulation of STAT5a tyrosine phosphorylation. Mammary gland involution in ATF4-transgenic mice was accelerated, compared with wild type littermates by whole mount analysis. In addition, day 18 of lactation in transgenic mice was phenotypically equivalent to day 3 of involution in wild type mice, as determined by the TUNEL assay and expression of Bax. The concentration of the proapoptotic molecule caspase-3 was increased during lactation in ATF4-transgenic animal. Mammary glands from ATF4-transgenic mice also showed significant nuclear translocation of activated STAT3 and up-regulation of one of its target genes, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-5, which is thought to facilitate apoptosis by sequestering insulin-like growth factor. Together, these findings suggest that ATF4 may play a role during mammary gland development and that down-regulation of ATF4 may be important for the onset of involution in the mammary gland."

After endocytosis, the A-chain translocates through the membrane of intracellular compartments to reach the cytosol where its N-glycosidase activity inactivates ribosomes, thereby arresting protein synthesis. We here show that ricin possesses a functional lipase active site at the interface between the two subunits. It involves residues from both chains. Mutation to alanine of catalytic serine 221 on the A-chain abolished ricin lipase activity. Moreover, this mutation slowed down the A-chain translocation rate and inhibited toxicity by 357. Lipase activity is therefore required for efficient ricin A-chain translocation and cytotoxicity. This conclusion was further supported by structural examination of type II ribosome-inactivating proteins that showed that this lipase site is present in toxic (ricin and abrin) but is altered in nontoxic (ebulin 1 and mistletoe lectin I) members of this family.

This 66-kDa glycoprotein is composed of two chains (RTA and RTB) linkedvia a disulfide bond. RTA is responsible for cytotoxicity. This N-glycosidase catalyzes the depurination of a specific adenine on the 28 S ribosomal RNA, thereby inactivating protein synthesis and leading to cell death. RTB is a lectin that recognizes terminal galactose residues and is responsible for toxin binding to cells (1Lord J.M. Roberts L.M. Robertus J.D. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). X-ray structures of the heterodimer and the recombinant RTA subunit (rRTA) have been solved at 2.5 and 2.3 Å, respectively (2Montfort W. Villafranca J.E. Monzingo A.F. Ernst S.R. Katzin B.

These studies described both the RTA N-glycosidase active site and the RTB galactose binding pockets. rRTA lacks the glycans present on native RTA but shows complete biological activity (1Lord J.M.

Ricin has been used to study molecular mechanisms involved in intracellular trafficking (5Sandvig K. van Deurs B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5943-5950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After cell binding, ricin is endocytosed and can be visualized in endosomes and the trans-Golgi network (6van Deurs B. Tonnessen T.I. Petersen O.W. Sandvig K. Olsnes S. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Biochemical evidence indicates that it could be transported back to the endoplasmic reticulum (7Wesche J. Rapak A. Olsnes S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34443-34449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Ricin escape to the cytosol has been reported to occur from endosomes (8Beaumelle B. Alami M. Hopkins C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23661-23669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the Golgi apparatus (9Bilge A. Warner C.V. Press O.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 34443-34449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). It is not known whether the affinity of RTA for model membranes (10Utsumi T. Ide A. Funatsu G. FEBS Lett. 1989; 242: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 11Day P.J. Pinheiro T.J. Roberts L.M. Lord J.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2836-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) facilitates its trans-membrane transport. This translocation step is rate-limiting for cytotoxicity (12Hudson T.H. Neville D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16484-16494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ricin has been extensively studied for its potential use in cancer treatments. Toward this objective, immunotoxins (ITs) were prepared by attaching ricin to a monoclonal antibody (13Kreitman R.J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 570-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). For clinical use and to avoid nonspecific binding of the IT, B-chain lectin sites were chemically inactivated. ITs containing such blocked ricin are usually much more efficient in vivo than those prepared with RTA alone (13Kreitman R.J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 570-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Similar data were obtained in vitro when lactose was used to prevent RTB binding to cells, i.e., ricin-containing ITs were more toxic than ITs made from RTA (14Gregg E.O. Bridges S.H. Youle R.J. Longo D.L. Houston L.L. Glennie M.J. Stevenson F.K. Green I. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 4502-4508PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, RTB involvement in ricin toxicity is not restricted to cell binding mediated by its lectin sites (15Frankel A.E. Fu T. Burbage C. Chandler J. Willingham M.C. Tagge E.P. Leukemia. 1997; 11: 22-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The basis of this potentiation effect of RTB on RTA toxicity, even when RTB lectin activity is ineffective, is not known. Following our initial observation that ricin displays significant homology to a lipase from another Euphorbiaceae (16Moulin A. Teissere M. Bernard C. Pieroni G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11328-11332Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we recently demonstrated that ricin shows lipolytic activity (17Helmy M. Lombard S. Piéroni G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 252-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and further characterized its specificity toward neutral lipids (18Lombard S. Helmy M.E. Pieroni G. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 773-781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such lipase activity could facilitate RTA access to the cytosol by providing local destabilization of the membrane (18Lombard S. Helmy M.E. Pieroni G. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 773-781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and might therefore be implicated in the potentiation of RTA toxicity by RTB. The B-chain would thus directly assist the A-chain during its translocation step as is the case for another heterodimeric toxin, diphtheria toxin (19Falnes P.O. Sandvig K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In this study, we localized a single canonical lipase catalytic triad within ricin and localized at the junction between RTA and RTB. We demonstrated the functionality of the ricin lipase site, which is conserved in toxic but not in innocuous members of the type II RIP family. Ricin, CM- and Blue-Sepharose, and most chemicals were obtained from Sigma. [35S]methionine (Trans-label) was from ICN. Pure RTB (without any detectable RTA) was purchased from Inland Labs (Austin, TX). RTA was purified from a commercial preparation (Sigma) using chromatography on lactose-agarose (8Beaumelle B. Alami M. Hopkins C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23661-23669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to remove contaminating ricin. Transferrin was labeled with Cy5 using a labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences). Secondary antibodies for immunofluorescence were from Nordic. The full-length RTA coding sequence (20Chaddock J.A. Roberts L.M. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) in pKK 223.3 (Pharmacia) was used as a template for PCR-based mutagenesis (21Landt O. Grunert H.-P. Haln U. Gene. 1990; 96: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). A 5′-mutagenic primer GCAATTCAAGAGGCTAACCAAGGAGCC, in which the TCT coding for Ser-221 was changed to the underlined GCT (Ala), was used together with a 3′-primer overlapping the downstream plasmid-HindIII site to prepare a first PCR fragment. A 3′-mutagenic primer and a 5′-primer spanning the upstreamClaI site enabled obtaining a second PCR fragment. These overlapping fragments were then joined and amplified by a second PCR using the outer primers. The resultingClaI-HindIII fragment was inserted into pKK 223.3-RTA for expression. A similar strategy was adopted to change His-40 to Ala, using a 5′-mutagenic primer in which the CAT coding for His-40 was altered to GCT (Ala), together with a 3′-primer covering theClaI site. The upstream fragment was prepared using a 5′-primer covering the plasmid EcoRI site and a 3′-mutagenic primer prior to the second round of PCR run to join the fragments. PCR-amplified DNA was entirely sequenced. A 1.5-liter culture of transfected Escherichia coli TG2 was grown at 30 °C. Expression was induced at anA595 of ∼0.7, using 1 mmisopropylthiogalactoside. After 2.5 h at 30 °C, E. coli lysates were prepared by sonication, clarified by centrifugation for 30 min at 25,000 × g, and dialyzed against 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8 (buffer A), before loading onto a CM-Sepharose column. After washing with buffer A, rRTA was eluted with a NaCl gradient of 0–1 m in buffer A (20Chaddock J.A. Roberts L.M. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A-chains were further purified by affinity chromatography on Blue-Sepharose and assayed for N-glycosidase activity using rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Promega) as indicated (8Beaumelle B. Alami M. Hopkins C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23661-23669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Equimolecular amounts of rRTA and plant RTB (20 ॖm in phosphate-buffered saline) were mixed in the presence of 8 mm reduced glutathione. After 3 h at room temperature and overnight dialysis at 4 °C against phosphate-buffered saline (4Beaumelle B. Taupiac M.P. Lord J.M. Roberts L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22097-22102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), the reconstituted control or mutated ricins were filtered-sterilized and stored at 4 °C for up to 1 week. RTA, rRTA, RTB, native, control, or mutant ricins (0–150 nmol) were added to 1 ml of 100 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 2 mm5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) and 2 mm of 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanol tributyrate (BAL-TC4; Aldrich). After 30 min at 37 °C, 2 ml of acetone were added before measuring the A412 as described previously (18Lombard S. Helmy M.E. Pieroni G. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 773-781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Specific lipolytic activities were expressed as millikatal/mol. A katal is the amount of enzyme which transforms 1 mol of substrate per second. Bovine serum albumin, used as control, did not show any lipolytic activity. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were purified from human blood using Ficoll-Paque plus (Amersham Biosciences), and monocytes were allowed to adhere overnight to tissue culture plates before washing and adding ricins. After 24 h, the medium (RPMI complemented with 107 human AB+ serum) was replaced for 4 h with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without methionine, supplemented with [35S]methionine. This medium was then aspirated. Cell proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and collected by filtration before scintillation counting (4Beaumelle B. Taupiac M.P. Lord J.M. Roberts L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22097-22102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated three times. Errors are expressed as S.E. A431 cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 107 fetal calf serum were seeded into 96-well plates (24,000 cells/well), whereas monocytes were used at 40–60,000 cells/well. Ricins were added, and a 1-h (A431) or 2-h (monocytes) pulse incorporation of [35S]methionine in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without methionine was performed at various times after the start of intoxication (4Beaumelle B. Taupiac M.P. Lord J.M. Roberts L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22097-22102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Ricins were radiolabeled with125I to monitor their endocytosis efficiency at 37 °C by mouse BW 5147 lymphocytes, using 0.1 m lactose to displace plasma membrane-bound ricin molecules (4Beaumelle B. Taupiac M.P. Lord J.M. Roberts L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22097-22102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For fluorescence microscopy, A431 cells were labeled for 40 min at 37 °C with 30 nmricin and 200 nm transferrin-Cy5 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin before lactose scraping. Cells were further washed, fixed, permeabilized with 0.0157 saponin, and labeled with antibodies. The rabbit anti-ricin antibodies (Sigma) were revealed using TRITC-labeled swine anti-rabbit IgG; sheep anti-TGN46 (Serotec) and the H4A3 anti-Lamp-1 monoclonal antibody (Iowa Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) were detected using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-sheep and goat anti-mouse antibodies, respectively. After mounting, cells were examined under a Leica confocal microscope (22Alami M. Taupiac M.P. Reggio H. Bienvenue A. Beaumelle B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 387-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Structures of ricin (PDB code 2AAI), neutral Pseudomonas lipase (5TGL), abrin (1ABR) mistletoe lectin I (1CE7), and ebulin (1HWO) were analyzed using the graphic program O (23Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar) running on a Silicon Graphics workstation. We first tried to identify the ricin chain responsible for heterodimer lipase activity. Purified chains showed lipase activities below 187 as compared with native ricin (Fig.1A). We concluded that the lipase site is found in the heterodimer only. All lipolytic enzymes investigated so far vary widely in size and amino acid sequence. However, most of them belong to the α/औ hydrolase superfamily in which the catalytic machinery consists of a nucleophile, an acid, and a histidine residue (the catalytic triad). Nucleophilic serine is located at the center of an extremely sharp turn between a औ-strand and an α-helix. The sharpness of the turn results in phi and psy angles that lie in an unfavorable region of the Ramachandran plot (24Ollis D.L. Cheah E. Cygler M. Dijkstra B. Frolow F. Franken S.M. Harel M. Remington S.J. Silman I. Schrag J. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1848) Google Scholar). A specific feature of lipases, as compared with canonical α/औ hydrolases, is that the active site is inaccessible to substrate in solution. In the presence of lipids, unmasking the active site generates the hydrophobic substrate binding site. This conformational change generates the so-called oxyanion hole where the transition state of the reaction can be stabilized via hydrogen bonds with two main-chain nitrogens (25Jaeger K.E. Ransac S. Dijkstra B.W. Colson C. van Heuvel M. Misset O. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 15: 29-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ricin lipase activity is more active (∼5-fold) on neutral lipids, such as triglycerides (18Lombard S. Helmy M.E. Pieroni G. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 773-781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), than on glycerophospholipids (17Helmy M. Lombard S. Piéroni G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 252-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the crystal structure of ricin to find common structural features with α/औ hydrolases, using the typical neutral lipase of Pseudomonas as reference (26Schrag J.D. Li Y. Cygler M. Lang D. Burgdorf T. Hecht H.J. Schmid R. Schomburg D. Rydel T.J. Oliver J.D. Strickland L.C. Dunaway C.M. Larson S.B. Day J. McPherson A. Structure. 1997; 5: 187-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). This led us to find only one putative serine hydrolase catalytic triad (RTA-Ser-221, RTA-His-40, and RTB-Asp-94). Nucleophilic RTA-Ser-221 is located at the beginning of a small turn between an α-helix (from 202 to 220) and a औ-strand (from 227 to 234) (Fig. 2). Nevertheless, as opposed to α/औ hydrolases, the catalytic serine lies in a favorable region of the Ramachandran plot. RTA-Ser-221 is hydrogen-bonded to RTA-His-40, which in turn interacts with Asp-94 of the RTB subunit. The distances between RTA-Ser-221 oγ and RTA-His-40 Nε2 and between RTA-His-40 Nδ1 and RTB-Asp-94 oδ are 3.2 and 2.8 Å, respectively. These values are almost identical to those measured in our reference lipase active site (3.1 and 2.8 Å). Hence, the relative orientation of side chains involved in both catalytic triads are strikingly similar, whereas ricin and lipase folding is completely different (Fig. 3, A andB). RTA-Ser-221 is located at the bottom of a hydrophobic groove, which might correspond to the binding site of substrate acyl chains. No attempt was made here to model a putative conformational change similar to lipase activation. The putative substrate binding site is located at the interface between ricin subunits (Fig.3B). Such localization explains why the heterodimer only shows significant lipase activity (Fig. 1A).Figure 3Localization of the catalytic triad inPseudomonas neutral lipase and type II RIPS.A, Pseudomonas neutral lipase.B, ricin. C, abrin. D, mistletoe lectin I. E, ebulin 1. Toxin subunits, depicted in gray (B-chain) or brown (A-chain), are disulfide-linked via the highlighted cysteine residues. The catalytic triad (shown as sticks) is present in ricin and abrin but not conserved in the two latter RIPs, which are not (39Pascal J. Day P.J. Monzingo A.F. Ernst S.R. Robertus J.D. Iglesias R.

Voelter W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) toxic. Structures were represented using Molscript (40Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Among the three residues of the putative catalytic triad, two of them, RTA-His-40 and RTB-Asp-94, directly interact and are involved in A/B polar interactions (27Rutenber E. Robertus J.D. Proteins. 1991; 10: 260-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Accordingly, when rRTA-His-40 was changed to Ala and produced in E. coli, the resulting rRTA40A associated very poorly with RTB as compared with control rRTA (Fig.4). Not surprisingly, this rRTA40A-RTB preparation, containing a large proportion (∼807) of isolated chains, did not show significant lipase activity (data not shown). Because this mutation prevented heterodimer formation, and therefore building of the lipase site, it was not possible to deduce from this lack of lipase activity any information regarding the role of RTA-His-40 in lipase activity. RTA-His-40 and RTB-Asp-94 only interact with each other across the A/B interface (27Rutenber E. Robertus J.D. Proteins. 1991; 10: 260-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). An RTB-Asp-94 mutation would thus likely destabilize the heterodimer exactly as the rRTA-H40A change, and so we did not prepare such a mutant. The third residue of the ricin lipase site, RTA-Ser-221, is not implicated in A/B interaction and was potentially catalytic. It was therefore the most appropriate for a point mutation in order to study the functionality of this site. We replaced rRTA-Ser-221 by an alanine. The rRTA221A mutant was produced in E. coli. It could form the heterodimer as efficiently as control rRTA (Fig. 4). Again, this was not surprising because Ser-221 does not interact with any B-chain residue (27Rutenber E. Robertus J.D. Proteins. 1991; 10: 260-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). RTA-Ser-221 is located far away from theN-glycosidase active site cleft (around 25 Å). Nevertheless, several amino acids outside this cleft can, albeit indirectly, participate in N-glycosidase catalysis (28Kitaoka Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Hence, it was important to check whether the S221A mutation affected this activity. We therefore tested the abilities of RTA, rRTA, rRTA40A, and rRTA221A to inhibit cell-free protein synthesis in reticulocyte lysates. No significant difference in N-glycosidase activity was found (not shown). We therefore concluded that the rRTA221A mutation did not affect the ribosome-inactivating activity of the protein. We then compared the properties of these control (rRTA-RTB) and mutant (rRTA221A-RTB) ricins. Wild-type (RTA-RTB) and control (rRTA-RTB) ricins displayed indistinguishable lipase activities: ∼3.3 millikatal/mol (Fig. 1, A and B) on BAL-TC4. This demonstrates that the lipase active site of ricin is correctly assembled upon formation of control ricin. The S221A mutation on the A-chain decreased heterodimer lipase activity to non-significant levels, corresponding to a 94 ± 57 inhibition compared with control ricin (Fig. 1B). This demonstrates the catalytic role of RTA-Ser-221 in lipid hydrolysis and is consistent with the 897 inhibition obtained using a serine hydrolase inhibitor, i.e. E600 (18Lombard S. Helmy M.E. Pieroni G. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 773-781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The lipase site predicted by structural analysis is therefore functional in ricin and unique within the molecule. We then assessed the involvement of ricin lipolytic activity in its intracellular transport using rRTA221-RTB. Cell binding and global endocytosis efficiency were monitored via the uptake of 125I-ricin by mouse lymphocytes (4Beaumelle B. Taupiac M.P. Lord J.M. Roberts L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22097-22102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This assay did not reveal any difference between control and mutant ricin (not shown). Ricin intracellular routing was examined by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy using fluorescent transferrin, TGN46, and Lamp-1 as markers of early endosomes (22Alami M. Taupiac M.P. Reggio H. Bienvenue A. Beaumelle B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 387-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), the trans-Golgi network (29Rohrer J. Kornfeld R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1623-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), late endosomes and lysosomes (30Gruenberg J. Maxfield F.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 552-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar), respectively. Both control and mutant ricins were efficiently endocytosed by A431 cells (Fig.5). Consistent with numerous studies of ricin uptake by several cell types (8Beaumelle B. Alami M. Hopkins C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23661-23669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31van Deurs B. Sandvig K. Peterson O.W. Olsnes S. Simons K. Griffiths G. J.

Cell Biol. 1990; 51: 96-109PubMed Google Scholar), they localized essentially to elements of the endo/lysosomal pathway, together with transferrin and Lamp-1. In agreement with previous data demonstrating the transport of a small fraction of endocytosed ricin to thetrans-Golgi network (31van Deurs B. Sandvig K. Peterson O.W. Olsnes S. Simons K. Griffiths G. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 253-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), weak colocalization of ricins with TGN46 was observed. Control and mutant ricins (shown in Fig. 5 for control and S221A, not shown for H40A) displayed the same intracellular pathway when studied through this assay. We concluded that lipolytic activity is not involved in ricin intracellular trafficking. We then tested whether mutations within a ricin lipase site would affect toxicity, using monocytes from human peripheral blood as target cells. rRTA221A-RTB with an IC50of 3 pm was ∼357 less toxic than control ricin (rRTA-RTB), which showed an IC50 of 2 pm for these cells (Fig. 6). rRTA40A-RTB was the least toxic molecule (IC50 of l0 pm), probably because of the weak A/B interaction for this mutant. Ricin translocation was examined using kinetics of protein synthesis inactivation. This assay enables translocation assessment on intact cells (4Beaumelle B. Taupiac M.P. Lord J.M. Roberts L.M. J.

Chem. 1987; 262: 16484-16494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It therefore provides data that are not restricted to the observation of ricin translocation from a specific organelle. The slope of the plot log (protein synthesis) versus time, measured after the initial dose-dependent lag, is directly proportional to the RTA translocation rate (12Hudson T.H. Neville D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16484-16494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.7A for A431 cells and Fig.7B for monocytes, mutant ricin (rRTA221A-RTB) killed cells more slowly than the control toxin. Because the mutation did not affect rRTA N-glycosidase activity or intracellular routing, the difference in the cell-killing rate was because of a lower translocation efficiency of mutant rRTA. When translocation rates were calculated from the best slope of these plots, whatever the cell line, rRTA221A translocation efficiency was only 64 ± 57 (mean ± S.E.; n = 7; p < 0.001) compared with that of rRTA. This result demonstrates that ricin lipase activity is implicated in toxicity, presumably during the translocation step. Although the effect of the RTA221A mutation on cytotoxicity and translocation may appear moderate, it should be noted that conjugates made only from RTA are already toxic, showing that, once bound to cells, RTA is able to translocate quite efficiently on its own. Nevertheless, conjugates prepared using blocked ricin are usually more efficient (13Kreitman R.J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 570-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Second, ricin lipase activity is low (18Lombard S. Helmy M.E. Pieroni G. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 773-781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore propose that the lipase activity of the heterodimer is likely responsible for this potentiation effect of the B-chain even when lectin sites are inactivated (14Gregg E.O. Bridges S.H. Youle R.J. Longo D.L. Houston L.L. Glennie M.J. Stevenson F.K. Green I. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 4502-4508PubMed Google Scholar). The B-chain therefore assists and facilitates A-chain translocation within the animal cell. Interestingly, compartments where ricin translocation was reported to take place, such as late endosomes (4Beaumelle B. Taupiac M.P. Lord J.M. Roberts L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22097-22102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and the endoplasmic reticulum (7Wesche J. Rapak A. Olsnes S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34443-34449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), are specifically enriched in triglycerides compared with the plasma membrane (33Kobayashi T. Stang E. Fang K.S. de Moerloose P. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Nature. 1998; 392: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 34Hussain M.M. Atherosclerosis. 2000; 148: 1-15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Because these lipid species are the preferred substrate for ricin lipase activity (18Lombard S. Helmy M.E. Pieroni G. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 773-781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), potentiation of A-chain translocation likely results from local destabilization of the membrane of specific, triglycerides-rich intracellular compartments by moderate lipase activity of the heterodimer. Mutation of RTA-His-40 did not give rise to a mutant suitable for studying the role of this residue in lipase activity, because the mutation prevented the A/B association required to generate the site. Hence, suppression of a single point of A/B interaction among the 15 pairs of residues enabling stabilization of the heterodimer (in addition to the interchain disulfide) (27Rutenber E. Robertus J.D. Proteins. 1991; 10: 260-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) led to a dramatic heterodimer dissociation. Because the heterodimer does not show any RNAN-glycosidase activity, the A-chain has to be released at a late stage of the intoxication process, presumably following reduction of the interchain disulfide (35Olsnes S. Sandvig K. Refsnes K. Pihl A. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 3985-3992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The A/B interaction, which showed aKd in the micromolar range (36Lewis M.S. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11571-11577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is therefore easily reversible; it was not very surprising that removing one point of interaction via the RTA40A mutation induced massive dissociation. The ricin lipase site is, to our knowledge, the first ever reported to be constituted by residues from distinct subunits. This could be a feature of plant lipases, and ricin is the first one whose structure is available. Because ricin is the prototype of type II RIPs, it was interesting to examine whether the lipase site was also present in other members of this family whose structures are available. Abrin, a toxin structurally and functionally related to ricin (37Tahirov T.H. Lu T.H. Liaw Y.C. Chen Y.L. Lin J.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 354-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), also displays a potential lipase catalytic site made of Ser-208 (A-chain), His-34 (A-chain), and Asp-99 (B-chain) (Fig. 3C). Structural analysis clearly showed (Fig. 3) that the lipolytic site is not conserved in the two barely toxic type II RIPs, mistletoe lectin I (38Eschenburg S. Krauspenhaar R. Mikhailov A. Stoeva S. Betzel C. Voelter W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and ebulin 1 (39Pascal J. Day P.J. Monzingo A.F. Ernst S.R. Robertus J.D. Iglesias R. Perez Y. Ferreras J.M. Citores L. Girbes T. Proteins. 2001; 43: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Hence, there is a correlation between the presence of a canonical lipase site and toxicity in type II RIPs. This finding further indicates that lipolytic activity likely plays an important role in their cytotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W1990938739,"Vertebrate fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase exists as three isozymes (A, B, and C) that demonstrate kinetic properties that are consistent with their physiological role and tissue-specific expression. The isozymes demonstrate specific substrate cleavage efficiencies along with differences in the ability to interact with other proteins; however, it is unknown how these differences are conferred. An alignment of 21 known vertebrate aldolase sequences was used to identify all of the amino acids that are specific to each isozyme, or isozyme-specific residues (ISRs). The location of ISRs on the tertiary and quaternary structures of aldolase reveals that ISRs are found largely on the surface (24 out of 27) and are all outside of hydrogen bonding distance to any active site residue. Moreover, ISRs cluster into two patches on the surface of aldolase with one of these patches, the terminal surface patch, overlapping with the actin-binding site of aldolase A and overlapping an area of higher than average temperature factors derived from the x-ray crystal structures of the isozymes. The other patch, the distal surface patch, comprises an area with a different electrostatic surface potential when comparing isozymes. Despite their location distal to the active site, swapping ISRs between aldolase A and B by multiple site mutagenesis on recombinant expression plasmids is sufficient to convert the kinetic properties of aldolase A to those of aldolase B. This implies that ISRs influence catalysis via changes that alter the structure of the active site from a distance or via changes that alter the interaction of the mobile C-terminal portion with the active site. The methods used in the identification and analysis of ISRs discussed here can be applied to other protein families to reveal functionally relevant residue clusters not accessible by conventional primary sequence alignment methods.

Tsolas O.J. Lai C.Y. Boyer P.D. 3rd ed. The Enzymes. 7. Academic Press, New York1972: 213-258Google Scholar). The enzyme catalyzes the reversible aldol cleavage of Fru 1,6-P21 into two trioses, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate. It also cleaves the structurally related sugar Fru 1-P into glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (2Hers H. Kusaka T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1953; 11: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 3Penhoet E.E. Kochman M. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 4391-4395Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Vertebrate aldolases exist as three or more isozymes with different tissue distributions: aldolase A (expressed predominantly in muscle), aldolase B (expressed predominantly in liver), and aldolase C (expressed predominantly in brain) (1Horecker B.L. Tsolas O.J. Lai C.Y. Boyer P.D. 3rd ed. The Enzymes. 7. Academic Press, New York1972: 213-258Google Scholar). The sequences of the mammalian isozymes are highly conserved, exhibiting 817 sequence identity between aldolases A and C (4Rottmann W.H. Deselms K.R. Niclas J. Camerato T. Holman P.S. Green C.J. Tolan D.R. Biochimie (Paris). 1987; 69: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Aldolase B is slightly more divergent with ∼707 sequence identity to both aldolases A and C (5Rottmann W.H. Tolan D.R. Penhoet E.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2734-2742Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Consistent with this sequence similarity, isozymes A and C exhibit comparable kinetic properties. Aldolases A and C have evolved to perform the glycolytic reaction, Fru 1,6-P2 cleavage, more efficiently than aldolase B as demonstrated by a 20–30-fold higherkcat (6Penhoet E.E. Rutter W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 318-323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Kusakabe T. Motoki K. Hori K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 1172-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Conversely, aldolase B cleaves Fru 1-P three times more efficiently than aldolase A or C (6Penhoet E.E. Rutter W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 318-323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, aldolases B and C demonstrate a 10-fold lower Km for glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate, implying that they have evolved to perform the gluconeogenic reaction, Fru 1,6-P2 synthesis, more efficiently than aldolase A (8Penhoet E.E. The Structure, Function and Distribution of Mammalian Fructose Diphosphate Aldolases.Ph.D. thesis. University of Washington, Seattle, WA1968Google Scholar). Although these kinetic properties are consistent with their physiological roles and tissue-specific expression (9Lebherz H.G. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 109-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), the structural features that confer these isozyme-specific differences are unknown. The three-dimensional structures of aldolase A (10Sygusch J. Beaudry D. Allaire M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7846-7850Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and B (11Dalby A.R. Tolan D.R. Littlechild J.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1526-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) have been determined and reveal homotetramers of very similar α/औ-barrels with the active site of each monomer located at the center of the α/औ-barrel. The 18–20 residues at the C terminus of the protein are likely to be flexible as this portion is either missing from many structures (10Sygusch J. Beaudry D. Allaire M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7846-7850Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 12Choi K.H. Shi J. Hopkins C.E. Tolan D.R. Allen K.N. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13868-13875Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) or found in a variety of conformations (11Dalby A.R. Tolan D.R. Littlechild J.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1526-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 13Blom N. Sygusch J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 36-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region has been implicated in determining the isozyme-specific differences of aldolase (14Berthiaume L. Tolan D.R. Sygusch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10826-10835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Motoki K. Kitajima Y. Hori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1677-1683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations in this region diminish the kinetic distinctions among isozymes. For example, the swapping of two regions (amino acids 34–55 and the C-terminal region 306–363) of human aldolase A onto human aldolase B causes changes in the kinetic properties of aldolase B. Like aldolase A, the chimera had a 5-fold increase in thekcat and a 4-fold increase inKm for Fru 1,6-P2 cleavage, as well as a 3-fold decrease in cleavage of Fru 1-P (15Motoki K. Kitajima Y. Hori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1677-1683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the naturally occurring mutation, A337V, which is located in the C-terminal portion of human aldolase B, is found in patients with hereditary fructose intolerance and results in a 437 loss in the ability to cleave Fru 1-P while maintaining wild-type cleavage rates of Fru 1,6-P2(16Rellos P. Sygusch J. Cox T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1145-1151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In contrast, switching the C-terminal 6 residues between isozymes A and B produces no clear effects on steady-state kinetics (14Berthiaume L. Tolan D.R. Sygusch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10826-10835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Given that aldolase isozymes have evolved distinct kinetic properties, residues unique to each isozyme must be conserved. Such isozyme-specific residues (ISRs) for aldolases B and C have been identified previously (17Berardini T. Amsden A.B. Penhoet E.E. Tolan D.R. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1999; 122: 53-61Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 18Berardini T.Z. Drygas W.M. Callard G.V. Tolan D.R. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1997; 117: 471-476Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The ISRs were identified based on the criteria that the residue is conserved within orthologs and is distinct among paralogs. In this report, we combined this evolutionary information with the three-dimensional structures of aldolase A, B, and a model of C to identify structural features that may be involved in conferring isozyme-specific kinetic preferences. To this end, an alignment of all six vertebrate aldolase A sequences was performed to identify aldolase A ISRs, along with a more extensive alignment of aldolase B and C sequences. All three sets of ISRs were mapped onto the conserved three-dimensional structure of the enzyme, and two patches on the surface of aldolase, where ISRs from all three isozymes cluster, were identified. The terminal surface patch (TSP) was associated with an area of relatively high flexibility as demonstrated by high x-ray crystallographic temperature factors. In addition, the F-actin-binding domain overlapped with this patch; thus, isozyme-specific surface moieties were correlated with macromolecular interactions. ISR clusters on the surface of aldolase may confer kinetic specificity by influencing the active site directly via the C-terminal region or indirectly through conformational changes that alter the structure of the active site from a distance. To test this hypothesis, PCR-assisted multiple site-directed mutagenesis was used to incorporate all 12 aldolase B ISRs into the appropriate position of aldolase A while at the same time replacing the 11 aldolase A ISRs with the analogous residue of aldolase B. The resulting protein was expressed inEscherichia coli and purified. Kinetic constants were determined, and a direct correlation between kinetic constants and ISR type was found. This type of analysis of ISRs can easily be applied to other protein families to reveal functional residue clusters not apparent from primary sequence alignments. Restriction endonucleases, T4 DNA ligase, exonuclease III, and DNA polymerase I were from New England Biolabs. Calf intestine alkaline phosphatase and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase/triose phosphate isomerase were from Roche Applied Science. Deoxynucleoside triphosphates, CM-Sepharose®CL-6B, and Sephadex® G-150 were from Amersham Biosciences. Oligonucleotides used for site-directed mutagenesis and sequencing were either synthesized on DNA synthesizers using phosphoramidite chemistry and the manufacturer's protocols or purchased from The Midland Certified Reagent Company, Inc. Ultrapure sucrose was from Invitrogen. Fru 1,6-P2, triethanolamine, and other chemicals were from Sigma. The amino acid sequences of the following aldolase A enzymes were aligned: human (19Sakakibara M. Mukai T. Hori K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Acta. 1997; 1354: 189-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The alignment was generated using Clustal V (24Higgins D.G. Sharp P.M. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 73: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (2885) Google Scholar). Amino acids that are unique to each isozyme and distinct from the analogous amino acid in paralogs were identified and defined as ISRs. This comparison included the addition of mouse B (25Funari V.A. Novel Computational and Classical Molecular Biological Approaches to Discovering Alternative Sites of Fructose Metabolism in Mice and Man.Ph.D. thesis.

Tolan, unpublished results. to the previously identified ISRs (17Berardini T. Amsden A.B. Penhoet E.E. Tolan D.R. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1999; 122: 53-61Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 18Berardini T.Z. Drygas W.M. Callard G.V. Tolan D.R. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1997; 117: 471-476Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The presence of non-conservative (radical) and conservative differences between isozyme groups were evaluated using the three-dimensional structure of aldolase A (Protein Data Bank (PDB) accession code 1ADO) (13Blom N. Sygusch J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 36-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and the graphics program O (28Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar) to assess whether the ISR played a crucial role in stabilizing tertiary or quaternary structure. These determinations were based on the degree of structural alteration caused by each substitution, location of the residue in the three-dimensional structure of the aldolase tetramer, polarity, charge, size, and aromaticity (29Schultz G.E. Schirmer R.H. Principles of Protein Structure. Springer-Verlag, New York1979: 10-16Google Scholar). Conservative changes included residues that were located in a structural motif such as an α-helix or औ-sheet and those residues that had side chains accessible to the solvent. In these cases, replacement with a residue of similar charge and size was unlikely to alter the overall structure of the protein. The H156E enzyme was constructed via site-directed mutagenesis (30Taylor J.W. Schmidt W. Cosstick R. Okruszek A. Eckstein F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 8749-8764Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) on the M13-based cDNA clone, AM1 (31Morris A.J. Tolan D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1095-1100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The H156E substitution was generated using the oligodeoxyribonucleotide: 5′-GATTGGGGAAGAGACCCCCTCAG-3′. Underlined nucleotides refer to the codon that has been changed from that of the wild-type aldolase A. The mutant enzyme AB_All was generated via multiple site-directed mutagenesis using overlapping oligodeoxyribonucleotides (32Ho S. Hunt H. Horton R. Pullen J. Pease L. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar) that complement the high copy ATG vector expressing rabbit aldolase A, pPB14 (33Beernink P.T. Tolan D.R. Prot. Expr. Purif. 1992; 3: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This construction involved three steps. First, the mutant expression plasmids, termed pABN and pABC, were generated. The following oligodeoxyribonucleotides were used to construct pABN: geneU, 5′-ACGACCGAGCGCAGCGAGTCAGTGAG-3′ (forward); ABN1, 5′-GCAGCCTCTTCCCCATGGTCCCGGTCGACTCATC-3′ (reverse); ABN2, 5′-CGACCGGGACCATGGGGAAGAGGCTGCAACGCATCGGTACC-3′ (forward); ABN3, 5′-CACGCTGTCATCCGCGGTCAGCAGCAGCTCCCGGAAGAAACGCCGGTTCTC-3′ (reverse); ABN4, 5′-GCTGCTGACCGCGGATGACAGCGTGAACCAGTGCATCGGGGGC GTCATC-3′ (forward); ABN5, 5′-GCCCACAACAATGCCCTTGGACTTGAT-3′ (reverse); ABN6, 5′-CAAGTCCAAGGGCATTGTTGTGGGCATCAAG-3′ (forward); ABN7, 5′-CCAGACAGGAAGCAAACTCCAGTGACAG-3′ (reverse); ABN8, 5′-CACTGGAGTTTGCTTCCTGTCTGGAGGTCAG-3′ (forward); ABN9, 5′-AGGAGAAGGTCAGTTTCCACGGCTTCAGCAG-3′ (reverse); ABN10, 5′-GCTGAAGCCGTGGAAACTGACCTTCTCC-3′ (forward); ABN11, 5′-CACGAACTCCTCCTGGGCAGCCTTCTTGTTCTCCTTCTTCCCACCCCAGGCCGCCAGAGCCGAGGC-3′ (reverse); ABN12, 5′-GAAGGCTGCCCAGGAGGAGTTCGTGAAGCGGGCCATGGCCAACAGCCTCGCATGCCAAGGGAAGTAC-3′ (forward); geneL, 5′-GCTACTGCCGCCAGGCAAACTGTTTTATCAG-3′ (reverse). The following oligodeoxyribonucleotides were used to construct pABC: geneU (see above) (forward); ABC1, 5′-GGGTGGCCGCGGCCCCGGCCTGACCACTCGGGACGTACTTCCCTTGGCATGCGAGGCTGTTG-3′ (reverse); ABC2, 5′-GGTCAGGCCGGGGCCGCGGCCACCCAGTCCCTCTTCACCGCTAACTACGCCTACTAAG-3′ (forward); geneL (see above) (reverse). The boldface nucleotides in oligodeoxyribonucleotides ABN12 and ABC1 represent a silent mutation engineered to include a unique SphI restriction site. This SphI site, along with an upstreamEcoRI and a downstream HindIII site, was used to splice together pABN and pABC to generate pAB. All of the ISRs were not included in pAB, and some residues were included that were later determined not to be ISRs after the addition of recently published aldolase sequences (see “Results”). The construct pAB_All was generated from pAB using the oligodeoxyribonucleotides: geneU (see above) (forward); AB_All1, 5′-GCACTGGTTCACGCGTCATCCGCGGTCAG-3′ (reverse); AB_All2, 5′-GACCGCGGATGACCGCGTGAACCAGTG-3′ (forward); AB_All3, 5′-GCCCACAACAATGCCCTTGGACTTGATAACTTGCGGGAAGGGCTTCCCATCGTC-3′ (reverse); AB_All4, 5′-ATCAAGTCCAAGGGCATTGTTGTGGGCATCAAGGTAGACAAGGGCGTGGCACCTCTGG-3′ (forward); AB_All5, 5′-GGCGAGGGCTGAGGGGGTCTGTTCCCCAATCTTC-3′ (reverse); AB_All6, 5′-GGGGAACAGACCCCCTCAGCCCTCGCCATCATG-3′ (forward); AB_All7, 5′-CCACAATGGGCACAAGGCCATTCTGCTGGCAGATG-3′ (reverse); AB_All8, 5′-GCCAGCAGAATGGCCTTGTGCCCATTGTG-3′ (forward); AB_All9, 5′-CCAGACAGGAAGGTAACTCCAGTGACAGCGGCGGGCACTGTG-3′ (reverse); AB_All10, 5′-GCCCGCCGCTGTCACTGGAGTTACCTTCCTGTCTG-3′ (forward); AB_All11, 5′-ACTTCCCTTGGCATGCGAGGCTGTTGGCCAGGGCCCGCTTCAC-3′ (reverse); AB_All12, 5′-GGCCAACAGCCTCGCATGCCAAGGGAAGTACACCCCGAGTGGTCAG-3′ (forward); geneL (see above) (reverse). The codons in italics indicate sites where pAB was reverted back to wild type. The amplification of each fragment was performed by incubating at 94 °C for 1 min followed by 30 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. The overlapping fragments were generated with 35 cycles. The resulting missense mutations and their consequent amino acid substitutions are shown in TableI. Potential mutants were screened by DNA sequence determination using dideoxy termination (34Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5487Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). The expression plasmid pXPB (33Beernink P.T. Tolan D.R. Prot. Expr.

Sucrose density gradient sedimentation velocity was determined for the H156E mutant using a modified procedure of Martin and Ames (36Martin R. Ames B. J. Biol.

Briefly, 0.1 mg of sample was loaded on 5–207 sucrose gradients at 20 °C and sedimented for 14.5 h at 38,000 rpm in a SW60 rotor (ω2t = 8.31 × 1011). Circular dichroism spectra were collected between 185 and 260 nm on an Aviv 62DS spectrometer equipped with a temperature controller at 20 °C as described previously (37Beernink P.T. Tolan D.R.

The model of aldolase C was derived from the high resolution structure of aldolase A (PDB accession code 1ADO) (13Blom N. Sygusch J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 36-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) using the Swiss-Model protein modeling server (38Peitsch M.C. Biochem. Soc.

Comparisons of amino acid and nucleotide sequences have shown that aldolase C and aldolase A are more closely related to each other than either is to aldolase B (4Rottmann W.H. Deselms K.R. Niclas J.

The protein modeling server performs superposition of related tertiary structures, generation of a multiple sequence alignment with the sequence to be modeled, generation of a structural framework of the new sequence, rebuilding of missing loops, completion and correction of backbone and side-chain geometry, and refinement of the structure by energy minimization and molecular dynamics. The locations of ISRs were mapped to the tertiary and quaternary structure of aldolase A using the program O (28Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). The coordinates of aldolase A and B were taken from high resolution crystal structures (PDB accession codes 1ADOand 1QO5, respectively) (11Dalby A.R. Tolan D.R. Littlechild J.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1526-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 13Blom N. Sygusch J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 36-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and those of aldolase C were generated from the homology model (see above). The electrostatic potential surfaces of aldolase A, B, and C were calculated and displayed using the program GRASP (39Nicholls A. Sharp K. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5318) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of 21 vertebrate aldolase isozymes were analyzed to identify individual residues specific to each isozyme. Multiple sequence alignment revealed a total of 11 aldolase A ISRs (Fig. 1). The alignment of these aldolase A ISRs was compared in order to further categorize these isozyme-specific differences into either conservative or non-conservative (radical) amino acid substitutions in an effort to identify which substitutions are more likely to confer functional changes to the isozyme. From this analysis, it was determined that among the aldolase A ISRs, Ile-39, His-156, Tyr-327, and Ser-353 were conservative differences and that Ser-45, Pro-71, Arg-91, Gly-102, Lys-311, Glu-354, and Ser-359 were non-conservative differences with respect to the other isozymes (Fig. 1). Due to the lack of a definitive structure, the ISRs in the C-terminal region, Ser-353, Glu-354, and Ser-359, were categorized without consideration of the three-dimensional location. Aldolase A ISRs were compared with the aldolase B (17Berardini T. Amsden A.B. Penhoet E.E. Tolan D.R. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1999; 122: 53-61Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and aldolase C ISRs (18Berardini T.Z. Drygas W.M. Callard G.V. Tolan D.R. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1997; 117: 471-476Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The inclusion of mouse and salmon aldolase B sequences in the aldolase B alignment revealed that the previously identified residues Ser-68 and Cys-268 are no longer conserved (Pro-68 and Thr-268 in salmon) and were thus excluded from the aldolase B ISRs. Similarly, the inclusion of the pufferfish aldolase C sequence revealed that the previously identified aldolase C ISR, Leu-57, was not conserved (Arg-57 in pufferfish), and therefore this residue was not included among the aldolase C ISRs. As a result, a total of 27 ISRs were identified: 11 aldolase A ISRs, 12 aldolase B ISRs, and 4 aldolase C ISRs (Fig. 1). Notably, the aldolase C ISRs were found within the last 49 residues of the protein sequence, whereas aldolase A- and B-specific residues were found throughout the primary sequence. The conservation of ISRs among orthologs implies that they play a role in conferring the specific kinetic properties of each isozyme. Thus, the expectation was that they would map largely at or near the active site. More specifically, the expectation was that they might reside within hydrogen bonding distance (2.6–4.0 Å) of either Lys-229 or Asp-33, which are residues known to be involved in catalysis (12Choi K.H. Shi J. Hopkins C.E. Tolan D.R. Allen K.N. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13868-13875Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The locations of all 27 ISRs in three-dimensional space were examined by mapping the residues onto the high resolution crystal structure of rabbit aldolase A (PDB accession code 1ADO) (13Blom N. Sygusch J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 36-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), which includes several conformations for the C terminus (residues 345–363). After analyzing the C termini of the four different monomer structures, the structure with the C terminus closest to the α/औ-barrel portion of the protein was chosen. Surprisingly, none of the ISRs were within hydrogen bonding distance of the active site as defined by the ε-amino group of the Schiff base forming Lys-229 and the carboxyl group of Asp-33 (Fig. 2a). The closest residue to the active site was 8.2 Å from the catalytic Asp-33. To determine whether the ISRs were involved in the subunit-subunit interactions that might stabilize the tetramer, the locations of ISRs were examined with regard to the tetramer structure. Only one ISR, His-156 of aldolase A, was located at the subunit interfaces and was near the 2-fold symmetry axis of the dimers. Its location implies that His-156 may play a role in stabilization of the tetramer. The role of this residue was examined by site-directed mutagenesis. His-156 was mutated to a glutamic acid in an attempt to reverse the point charge of this residue. The purified aldolase A H156E mutant enzyme demonstrated similar kinetics (Table II) and stability to the wild-type enzyme. The kinetic constants for recombinant wild-type aldolase A and B were obtained in the same fashion as for the mutant enzymes, and the kinetic"

The dephosphorylation of adherens junctions proteins appears to be necessary for the formation of stable, confluent endothelial monolayers, since increased tyrosine phosphorylation of adherens junctions proteins leads to the disruption of adherens junctions (4Shibamoto S.

The mechanisms by which cell density decreases tyrosine phosphorylation of endothelial membrane proteins are unknown. One possible mechanism is that increased cell confluence modulates the local environment of signaling proteins in the plasma membrane, thereby altering their response to extracellular ligands. Recently (7Corvera S. DiBonaventura C. Shpetner H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31414-31421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), we identified membrane cholesterol as a potential determinant of tyrosine phosphorylation levels in growing endothelial monolayers. Membrane cholesterol increased markedly with cell density in cultures of growing endothelial cells, exhibiting levels 3–4-fold higher upon reaching confluence. Depletion of cholesterol from confluent monolayers of CPAE1 cells induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple membrane proteins, including the adherens junctions proteins γ-catenin and pp120, and disrupted adherens junctions. Cholesterol might regulate tyrosine phosphorylation levels through the localization of tyrosine kinases or phosphatases to specific plasma membrane loci. To begin to identify such kinases or phosphatases, we have used very low (0.01%) levels of the sterol-containing detergent digitonin to identify proteins bound to membranes in a cholesterol-dependent manner (8Harder T. Kellner R. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 533-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). At these concentrations, digitonin complexes specifically with unesterified 3-β-hydroxysterols (principally free cholesterol, in animal cells), forming in situ precipitates without disrupting other lipid interactions (9Elias P.M.

Here, we report that extracts prepared with digitonin from confluent, but not subconfluent endothelial cells, contained the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2. SHP-2 was found in a complex with Ax II, a phospholipid-binding protein (11Drust D.S. Creutz C.E. Nature. 1988; 331: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 12Johnstone S.A. Hubaishy I.

Chem. 2002; 277: 4925-4931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and both SHP-2 and Ax II were visualized at intercellular junctions in confluent endothelial monolayers. Our observations indicate that, as endothelial cells reach confluence, a complex containing SHP-2 and Ax II is recruited to intercellular junctions by a novel, cholesterol-dependent, mechanism. These studies suggest that cell density regulates the tyrosine phosphorylation levels of membrane proteins through the cholesterol-dependent redistribution of tyrosine kinases and/or phosphatases. Monoclonal antibodies to Ax II, SHP-2, and β-catenin were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). A monoclonal antibody to phosphotyrosine (clone 4G10) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). A polyclonal antibody to actin was purchased from Sigma. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Alexa fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Digitonin was purchased from Calbiochem. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Subconfluent or confluent cultures of CPAE cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were grown, harvested, and homogenized in cytosol buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 125 mm potassium acetate, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.2 msucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, 0.01 mg/ml tosylarginine methyl ester, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmbenzamidine, 1 mm 1,10-phenanthrene, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) as previously described (7Corvera S. DiBonaventura C. Shpetner H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31414-31421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) unless otherwise indicated. To prepare unfractionated membranes, cell homogenates were first centrifuged at 1000 × gfor 10 min to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. The supernatant was centrifuged at 50,000 rpm (124,000 × g) for 15 min in a Beckman TL-100 centrifuge, and the membrane pellet was washed three times by resuspension in cytosol buffer, homogenization with a tuberculin syringe, and recentrifugation as described above. Washed membranes were resuspended in cytosol buffer and syringe-homogenized. When multiple samples were prepared in parallel, they were made equal in protein concentration. Identical volumes of membranes were extracted with or without digitonin (0.01%) on ice for 10 min and centrifuged as before for 15 min. Supernatants and pellets were analyzed by gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting as previously described (7Corvera S. DiBonaventura C. Shpetner H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31414-31421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To separate membranes into low- and high-density fractions, 0.5 ml of unfractionated membranes in cytosol buffer were layered on to 0.4 ml of a 35% sucrose cushion in cytosol buffer and centrifuged at 97,000 × g for 20 min. Low-density or high-density membranes were collected from the 0/35% sucrose interface or the bottom of the 35% cushion, respectively. The membrane fractions were diluted 5-fold with cytosol buffer and harvested by centrifugation at 135,000 ×g for 1 h. The fractions were resuspended in cytosol buffer and made equal in protein concentration, and identical volumes were extracted with or without digitonin, as described above. PTPase activities of membranes or membrane extracts were determined using a kit (catalogue number V2471) from Promega. Briefly, samples in cytosol buffer were incubated with 5 nmol of each of two peptide substrates (ENDpYINASL and DADEpYLIPQQG) in a total volume of 50 μl for 30–60 min in a 96-well plate. The PTPase reaction was stopped with the addition of 50 μl of a proprietary acid/molybdate-based dye reagent, and free phosphate was determined from the absorbance at 600 nm using an inorganic phosphate standard. The PTPase reaction was linear with respect to both time and protein concentration in the ranges employed. Unfractionated membranes in cytosol buffer were mixed with 0.11 volumes of a 10× stock of Nonidet P-40 to a final concentration of 0.2%. Equal volumes of the supernatant (∼25 μl) were immediately diluted 20-fold with cytosol buffer and mixed with agarose beads conjugated to anti-mouse IgG (Sigma), which had previously been incubated either with or without a monoclonal antibody to SHP-2. The mixtures were incubated overnight at 4 °C with agitation, and the beads were washed six to seven times by sedimentation at 1 g and resuspension in cytosol buffer plus 0.01% Nonidet P-40. The washed beads were solubilized in SDS gel sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with antibodies to SHP-2 and Ax II. Cells were plated on glass coverslips at the indicated densities and grown for 2 days. Where indicated, confluent cells were treated with 4% methyl-β-cyclodextrin for 3 min at 37 °C immediately prior to fixation. Cells were then fixed in ice-cold methanol for 15 min at −20 °C, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), incubated in blocking solution (fetal bovine serum (1.0%) plus Triton X-100 (0.5%) in PBS) for 15 min at room temperature, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with a monoclonal antibody to either SHP-2 or Ax II and a polyclonal antibody to actin, both diluted 100-fold in blocking buffer. Coverslips were washed three times for 5 min each in blocking buffer, incubated for 1 h at room temperature in Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, both diluted 1:400 in blocking buffer, washed as before, and mounted using Anti-Fade Mounting Medium (Molecular Probes). Cells were imaged using a Leica TCS-SP laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica, Heidelberg, Germany), using the argon and krypton lasers to excite the anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies respectively. Bleed-through was routinely eliminated by adjusting laser intensities and signal gain so that the cross-channel signal in the scanned images was zero. Protein mixtures were analyzed on 7.5–17.5% polyacrylamide gradient SDS gels. Polypeptide bands were stained using undiluted Sypro Ruby protein reagent (Molecular Probes) overnight, rinsed in water, and imaged using a 300-nm UV transilluminator. Antibodies were diluted 1:2500–1:5000 for immunoblotting. horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were detected on immunoblots using a chemiluminescence reagent from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Protein concentrations were determined using a Coomassie Blue-based reagent (number 500–0006) from Bio-Rad. Polyacrylamide gels and immunoblots are representative of at least three separate experiments. Earlier studies (3Lampugnani M.G. Corada M. Andriopoulou P. Esser S. Risau W. Dejana E. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2065-2077Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) had indicated that tyrosine phosphorylation of adherens junctions proteins decreased as endothelial cells formed confluent monolayers in culture. Recently (7Corvera S. DiBonaventura C. Shpetner H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31414-31421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) we reported that depletion of cholesterol by methyl-β-cyclodextrin induced tyrosine phosphorylation of several membrane proteins, including pp120 and γ-catenin. To determine the extent to which methyl-β-cyclodextrin reversed tyrosine dephosphorylations, which occur as endothelial cells reach confluence in culture, we directly compared tyrosine phosphorylation levels of membrane proteins from subconfluent cells, confluent cells, and confluent cells treated with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (Fig. 1). Subconfluent cells contained prominent tyrosine phosphorylated proteins migrating as 60-, 70-, 75-, 80- (γ-catenin), 120- (pp120), 135- and 175-kDa species. Tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins was virtually undetectable in membranes from confluent cells. Incubation of confluent cells with methyl-β-cyclodextrin for 20 min restored tyrosine phosphorylation levels of most of these proteins, including pp120 and γ-catenin, to approximately the same levels as those seen in subconfluent cells, while the 135-kDa polypeptide generally exhibited somewhat higher levels of phosphorylation. Thus, partial depletion of cholesterol from confluent cells restored tyrosine phosphorylation levels of membrane proteins to the same or higher levels as those in subconfluent cells. We sought to identify mechanisms by which cholesterol could regulate or localize tyrosine kinase or phosphatase activity. As noted earlier, digitonin, at very low (<0.02%) concentrations, binds specifically to membrane cholesterol (9Elias P.M. Goerke J. Friend D.S. Brown B.E. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 78: 577-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) without disrupting other membrane lipids. Therefore, to determine whether any PTPases bound to membranes in a cholesterol-dependent manner, we measured the amount of PTPase activity that could be extracted by 0.01% digitonin from membranes prepared from confluent CPAE cells (Fig.2). Extraction with buffer alone solubilized 0.2 ± 0.1 units (1 unit = 1 nmol of phosphate hydrolyzed/min/mg of membrane protein) of activity, whereas buffer containing digitonin solubilized 1.5 ± 0.2 units of activity. Thus, digitonin specifically extracted 1.3 ± 0.2 units of activity, representing 15% of the total membrane-bound activity (1.3/8.8; see legend to Fig. 2). In contrast, only 0.5 ± 0.2 units of activity could be specifically extracted with digitonin from membranes from subconfluent cells, representing just 7% (0.5/7.3; see legend to Fig. 2) of the total membrane-associated activity. Thus, 2.6-fold more PTPase activity was specifically extractable with digitonin from membranes prepared from confluent rather than from subconfluent cells. Treatment of intact cells with methyl-β-cyclodextrin reduced the activity specifically extracted with digitonin from 1.4 ± 0.2 to 0.8 ± 0.2 units (Fig. 2B), which represented, respectively, 18 and 9% of the total membrane-associated activity (1.4/7.7 and 0.8/9.0; see legend to Fig. 2), indicating that this activity did, in fact, associate with membranes in a cholesterol-dependent manner. To determine the identity of the digitonin-extractable PTPase, we probed extracts from subconfluent or confluent cells for several known PTPases by immunoblotting. A small but reproducible amount of SHP-2 was specifically extracted by digitonin from membranes from confluent, but not subconfluent cells, although membranes from subconfluent and confluent cells contained almost equal amounts of the protein (Fig. 2). As reported previously (7Corvera S. DiBonaventura C. Shpetner H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31414-31421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), substantial amounts of Ax II could also be extracted from membranes from confluent cells with digitonin, and virtually no Ax II was detected in membranes from subconfluent cells, consistent with their low levels of cholesterol. Prior treatment of confluent cells with methyl-β-cyclodextrin substantially reduced the amounts of both SHP-2 and Ax II extracted by digitonin (Fig.3B), confirming that both proteins were at least partially bound to membranes in a cholesterol-dependent manner. SHP-2 contains two N-terminal Src homology (SH)2 domains, which bind to numerous tyrosine phosphorylated proteins (5Ukropec J.A. Hollinger M.K. Salva S.M. Woolkalis M.J. J. Biol.

In addition, SHP-2 contains two tyrosine phosphorylation sites, one of which binds to the SH2 domain of GRB2 (20Bennett A.M. Tang T.L. Sugimoto S. Walsh C.T. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7335-7339Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). To begin to evaluate the role of these sites in the cholesterol-dependent binding of SHP-2 to membranes, we extracted membranes from confluent cells with phenyl phosphate (40 mm), a competitive inhibitor of phosphotyrosine/SH2 interactions (Fig. 3C). In contrast to digitonin, phenyl phosphate extracted only trace levels of SHP-2 and Ax II, although SDS gels stained for total protein indicated that several other polypeptides were specifically extracted by phenyl phosphate. Thus, the cholesterol-dependent binding of SHP-2 to membranes appeared to occur by a mechanism involving other regions of SHP-2 besides its SH2 domains. We reasoned that the digitonin-extractable SHP-2 in confluent cells might represent a separate pool of the protein. Since cholesterol-rich plasma membrane domains often migrate as low-density vesicles when centrifuged through sucrose density gradients, we separated membranes from confluent CPAE cells into low-density (LDM) and high-density (HDM) fractions and extracted them either with or without digitonin (Fig.4A). SHP-2 was distributed approximately equally between the LDM and HDM fractions. However, while over half of the SHP-2 in the LDM could be extracted using digitonin, virtually none of the SHP-2 in the HDM fraction was solubilized by digitonin. Thus, the digitonin-extractable SHP-2 in confluent cells represented a distinct pool of the protein residing in a separate compartment. In contrast to SHP-2, β-catenin could not be extracted from either the LDM or HDM with digitonin, although SHP-2 has been reported to bind to β-catenin in in vitro assays (5Ukropec J.A. Hollinger M.K. Salva S.M. Woolkalis M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5983-5986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). As noted previously, virtually all the Ax II was found in the LDM, and a substantial amount of Ax II could be extracted with digitonin (7Corvera S. DiBonaventura C. Shpetner H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31414-31421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Since the digitonin-extractable SHP-2 in confluent cells was localized almost exclusively to the LDM, and subconfluent cells contained no digitonin-extractable SHP-2, it seemed plausible that SHP-2 was recruited to the LDM as cells reached confluence. In fact, in contrast to confluent cells, the LDM fraction from subconfluent cells contained virtually no SHP-2, while the HDM fraction contained substantial amounts of the protein. Thus, SHP-2 and Ax II were both recruited to membranes in the LDM fraction by a cholesterol-dependent mechanism as endothelial cells reached confluence. To identify the intracellular structures to which Ax II and SHP-2 were recruited, we visualized SHP-2 and Ax II in CPAE cells by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig.5, A and B). In confluent cells, both SHP-2 and Ax II were visualized at sites of cell-cell adhesion, although diffuse, granular staining was also observed. Brief (3 min) treatments with methyl-β-cyclodextrin almost entirely dissociated Ax II and SHP-2 from the cell periphery. Generally, actin fibers were more readily visualized after treatment with methyl-β-cyclodextrin, suggesting that stress fibers were released from the cell periphery to the interior, although in some cells peripheral actin bundles were still seen. In many cells, retraction of the plasma membrane was evident, as noted previously (7Corvera S. DiBonaventura C. Shpetner H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31414-31421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). No bleed-through was detected in the SHP-2 or Ax II channels when cells were illuminated at the excitation frequency of the actin-bound fluorophore only (see Supplementary Fig. 1 at http://www.jbc.org).Figure 5Localization of SHP-2 and Ax II to the actin cytoskeleton. CPAE cells were plated at the indicated cell densities on glass coverslips. After 2 days of growth, only cells plated at the highest density were confluent. One set of confluent cultures was treated with 6% methyl-β-cyclodextrin for 3 min immediately prior to fixation. Cells were fixed with methanol at −20 °C for 15 min and processed for immunofluorescence microscopy using a monoclonal antibody to either SHP-2 (A) or Ax II (B) and a polyclonal antibody to actin. Images shown are confocal sections in the plane of adherens junctions, i.e.approximately one-third the distance from the basolateral to the apical surface. Scale bars equal 40 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) At the lowest cell density, Ax II immunofluorescence was generally faint, consistent with the low levels of particulate Ax II in these cells (Fig. 3A), although some co-linear staining with actin could be detected, and SHP-2 exhibited clear co-localization with actin. At somewhat higher densities, both Ax II and SHP-2 were visualized along actin bundles at the cell periphery, as well as along stress fibers, although some diffuse granular staining was also observed. Generally, confluent cells showed a somewhat lower level of stress fiber staining, suggesting that actin filaments were redistributed from the cell interior to the periphery as intercellular junctions formed. Our studies indicated that, as endothelial cells reached confluence, SHP-2 and Ax II are coordinately recruited to a low-density membrane fraction, apparently derived from cell-cell adhesion sites. We reasoned, therefore, that SHP-2 and Ax II might be physically associated in confluent CPAE cells. To test this hypothesis, we prepared immunoprecipitates from membrane extracts using a monoclonal antibody to SHP-2 and probed them for Ax II (Fig.6). A crude membrane fraction from confluent CPAE cells was extracted with 0.2% Nonidet P-40 and centrifuged, and the supernatant diluted 20-fold with buffer and incubated overnight with anti-mouse IgG-agarose beads either with or without a monoclonal antibody to SHP-2. Under these conditions, virtually all of the SHP-2 bound to the beads containing the antibody to SHP-2, while almost no SHP-2 bound to the beads alone. Ax II was also present in the beads containing the antibody to SHP-2, but not in the beads without the antibody. Thus, membrane-bound SHP-2 in confluent CPAE cells can form a complex with Ax II. We have found that the tyrosine phosphorylation levels of membrane proteins in endothelial cells appear to be regulated by cholesterol levels: as endothelial cells reached confluence, tyrosine phosphorylation levels decreased as cholesterol levels increased (7Corvera S. DiBonaventura C. Shpetner H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31414-31421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and partial depletion of cholesterol with methyl-β-cyclodextrin restored tyrosine phosphorylation levels to those seen in subconfluent cells (Fig. 1). While other studies have also indicated inverse relationships between tyrosine phosphorylation and cholesterol (21Furuchi T. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21099-21104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 22Visconti P.E. Galantino-Homer H. Ning X. Moore G.D. Valenzuela J.P. Jorgez C.J. Alvarez J.G.

Our observations also provide a mechanism for the attenuation of signaling pathways at higher cell densities in the presence of high concentrations of activating ligands. Our observations indicate that SHP-2 is recruited to sites of cell-cell contact as endothelial cells reach confluence, apparently as a function of increasing cholesterol. While SHP-2 has been found to associate with numerous signaling proteins via its SH2-domains, this recruitment appears to be at least in part independent of phosphotyrosine/SH2 interactions, since almost none of the membrane-bound SHP-2 in our preparations was extractable with phenyl phosphate (Fig. 3C) and the extraction of SHP-2 with digitonin was only seen at high cell densities, where membrane proteins were tyrosine phosphorylated at very low levels (Fig. 1; cf.

Chem. 2000; 275: 31414-31421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In endothelial cells, the SH2 domains of SHP-2 have been reported to interact with phosphotyrosines in both platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (18Masuda M. Osawa M. Shigematsu H. Harada N. Fujiwara K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and β-catenin (5Ukropec J.A. Hollinger M.K. Salva S.M. Woolkalis M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5983-5986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), both of which have been localized to sites of cell-cell contact. However, these interactions were observed when intact cells were treated with orthovanadate, which induces tyrosine phosphorylation of membrane proteins, and destabilizes adherens junctions. Thus, it seems plausible that the binding of SHP-2 to platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 and β-catenin occurs in response to signals initiated by growth factors, e.g.vascular endothelial growth factor, which leads to the breakdown of intercellular junctions and the resumption of the cell cycle. In contrast, the cholesterol-dependent binding of SHP-2 to membranes that we report here was observed in the absence of orthovanadate and may represent a mechanism for maintaining junctional stability. The finding that Ax II co-immunoprecipitates with SHP-2 from membrane extracts from confluent endothelial cells suggests that the two proteins are recruited as a complex to the cell periphery with increasing cell density and membrane cholesterol. Ax II has also been localized to adhesions between confluent Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (25Harder T. Gerke V. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1119-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Ax II has been found to bind directly to anionic liposomes (11Drust D.S. Creutz C.E. Nature. 1988; 331: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 12Johnstone S.A. Hubaishy I. Waisman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25976-25981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and cholesterol has been reported to enhance this binding (26Ayala-Sanmartin J. Henry J.P. Pradel L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1510: 18-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), suggesting that an Ax II/SHP-2 complex could bind directly to membrane lipid domains enriched in cholesterol. Membrane anchoring could also occur through an intrinsic membrane protein such as CD44, which was recently found to anchor Ax II to detergent-resistant, cholesterol-rich membranes (rafts) in mammary epithelial EpH4 cells (27Oliferenko S.

Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 277-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) have been identified in rafts in cultured cells, and cholesterol-sequestering reagents have been found to dissociate Ax II from both chromaffin granules (26Ayala-Sanmartin J.

Cell Biol. 2001; 80: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it is conceivable that the localization of either Ax II or SHP-2 to sites of cell-cell attachment could occur through direct binding to actin, since both Ax II (33Jones P.G. Moore G.J.

The nature of the plasma membrane domains to which SHP-2 and Ax II are recruited with increasing cell confluence is not clear. Ax II has been found not to co-purify with caveolae isolated from rat lung blood vessels (36Stan R.V. Roberts W.G. Predescu D. Ihida K. Saucan L. Ghitescu L. Palade G.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), and caveolin did not localize to cell junctions in endothelial cells, 2H. S. Shpetner, unpublished observations. in contrast to Ax II (Fig. 6). Our findings that much of the membrane-bound Ax II in confluent cells is extractable with low levels of digitonin and that Ax II is predominantly localized to intercellular junctions argue that these domains are also found at intercellular junctions. Nevertheless, we have found that confluent 3T3L1 fibroblasts, which are contact-inhibited, but do not elaborate defined junctional structures, also contain both elevated levels of cholesterol and Ax II and SHP-2, which can be extracted with low levels of digitonin. 3A. Burkart, S. Corvera, and H. S. Shpetner, unpublished observations. In addition, we have found that, in growing endothelial monolayers, cholesterol and membrane-bound Ax II increased prior to the formation of cell junctions (7Corvera S. DiBonaventura C. Shpetner H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31414-31421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These observations strongly suggest that the domains to which Ax II and SHP-2 are recruited are not uniquely targeted to intercellular junctions but might arise more generally in contexts where the attenuation of tyrosine kinase-based signaling is required. Further studies will be needed to clarify the precise nature of these domains and the range of signaling processes which they regulate.

Three palindromic operator regions are recognized by BlaI: two in theblaP promoter (OP1 and OP2) and one (OP3) in the promoter of the blaI-blaR1 operon. In this study, the dissociation constant of the purified BlaI dimer was estimated at 25 ॖm by equilibrium ultracentrifugation. Quantitative Western blot analysis indicates that the intracellular concentrations of BlaI in B. licheniformis 749/I and Bacillus subtilis transformed by a multicopy plasmid harboring the औ-lactamase locus (blaP-blaI-blaR1) were lower than (1.9 ॖm) or in the same range as (75 ॖm) the dissociation constant, respectively. This suggests that BlaI is partially dimeric in the cytoplasm of these strains and interactsin vivo with its operators as a preformed dimer. This hypothesis is supported by band shift assays on an operator containing a randomized half-operator sequence. The global dissociation constants of the operator-BlaI dimer complexes were measured by band shift assays and estimated as KdOP1 = 1.7 ± 0.5 10−15m2,KdOP2 = 3.3 ± 0.9 10−15m2, andKdOP3 = 10.5 ± 2.5 10−15m2.

The role of the DNA binding properties of BlaI on the औ-lactamase regulation is discussed. The blaP gene encodes the class A औ-lactamase of Bacillus licheniformis 749/I. In the absence of औ-lactams antibiotics, the BlaI repressor prevents the transcription of the blaP gene (1Nicholls N.J. Lampen J.O.

Two additional genes,blaR1 and blaR2, are also involved in the induction of the औ-lactamase synthesis (4Kobayashi T. Zhu Y.F. Nicholls N.J. Lampen J.O. J.

The blaP,blaI, and blaR1 genes are clustered in a divergeon (bla divergeon) in which blaI andblaR1 form an operon (Fig. 1). The blaR1 gene encodes a transmembrane protein that acts as penicillin receptor (6Joris B. Ledent P. Kobayashi T. Lampen J.O. Ghuysen J.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1990; 58: 107-113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Zhu Y. Englebert S. Joris B. Ghuysen J.M. Kobayashi T. Lampen J.O. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6171-6178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Hardt K.

The BlaR2 protein is essential for the inactivation of BlaI. InStaphylococcus aureus, the blaZ andmecA genes, encoding respectively a औ-lactamase and the low affinity penicillin-binding protein 2′, are regulated by similar elements (9Dyke K.G.H. Hamilton-Miller J.M.T. Smith J.T. β-Lactamases. Academic Press, London1979: 291-310Google Scholar, 10Ryffel C. Tesch W. Birch-Machin I. Reynolds P.E. Barberis-Maino L. Kayser F.H. Berger-Bachi B. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 94: 137-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The blaI gene encodes a 128-residue protein characterized by two functional and separate domains (11Wittman V. Lin H.C. Wong H.C. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7383-7390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA-binding domain, a helix-turn-helix recognition motif, is located in the N-terminal region, and the dimerization domain is in the C-terminal region. After deletion of the C-terminal domain, the repressor becomes unable to dimerize and to form a stable complex with its operators. DNase footprinting experiments and filter binding reactions revealed the presence of three regulatory regions that are recognized specifically by BlaI (11Wittman V. Lin H.C. Wong H.C. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7383-7390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These operators present a 23-bp-long dyad symmetry and show the deduced 5′-AAAGTATTACATATGTAACNTTT-3′ consensus sequence (Fig.1). In the presence of औ-lactam antibiotics, the C-terminal domain of BlaR1 is acylated (6Joris B. Ledent P. Kobayashi T. Lampen J.O. Ghuysen J.M. FEMS Microbiol.

This event triggers the activation of the putative cytoplasmic metalloprotease motif of BlaR1 by self-proteolysis (8Hardt K. Joris B. Lepage S. Brasseur R. Lampen J.O. Frère J.M. Fink A.L.

Science. 2001; 291: 1962-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In S. aureus, the औ-lactamase induction correlates with BlaI proteolysis between residues Asn101and Phe102, and it is postulated that the activated form of BlaR1 proteolyses BlaI (12Zhang H.Z. Hackbarth C.J. Chansky K.M. Chambers H.F. Science. 2001; 291: 1962-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 13Gregory P.D. Lewis R.A. Curnock S.P. Dyke K.G. Mol.

Microbiology. 2001; 147: 803-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The blaR2 gene could be involved in this process or in the activation of BlaR1, but our recent studies in a recombinant Bacillus subtilis harboring a plasmid carrying the bla divergeon show contrasting results with those in S. aureus and suggest that the inactivation of BlaI in Bacillus is mediated by the binding of a coactivator (16Filée P. Benlafya K. Delmarcelle M. Moutzourelis G. Frère J.M. Joris B. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 685-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This coactivator could maintain the BlaI dimer in a conformation unable to bind to the DNA operators and sensitive tocytoplasmic B. licheniformis or S. aureusproteases. To determine the mechanism by which the coactivator interferes with the DNA binding properties of BlaI, a detailed analysis of the interaction pathway between BlaI and its operators was essential. In the present study, we used purified BlaI to analyze the multimerization of the protein by equilibrium ultracentrifugation and its binding to the three operator sequences mentioned above by band shift assay. The implications of the DNA binding properties of BlaI on the औ-lactamase regulation are also discussed. B. licheniformis749/I is a औ-lactamase-inducible strain (7Zhu Y. Englebert S. Joris B.

Different amounts of these cytoplasmic extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE (157) before analysis by Western blotting. Western blots were performed using polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, anti-BlaI-WT rabbit polyclonal serum (18Filée P. Delmarcelle M. Thamm I. Joris B. BioTechniques. 2001; 30 (1050–1051): 1044-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), goat alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies, and revelation with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl phosphate and nitroblue tetrazolium (Bio-Rad). To estimate the BlaI concentration in cytoplasmic extracts, known quantities of purified BlaI were loaded on the same gel. To take account of the potential loss of BlaI during the preparation of samples, the standards were prepared according to the following procedure: nontransformed B. subtilis cells were pelleted, washed, and suspended in AQ buffer containing purified BlaI. After sonication, the supernatant was collected by centrifugation, added with SDS loading buffer, and heated for 5 min in a boiling water bath. The blots were scanned and analyzed with the software Densito (Cybertech). Analytical ultracentrifugation experiments were carried out in a Beckman Optima XLA instrument at 20 °C using optical absorption detection at a wavelength of 280 nm. The protein samples were transferred in 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.6, containing 200 mm NaCl and 1 mm EDTA by dialysis, and the final BlaI concentrations were 0.447, 0.386, 0.33, 0.276, 0.218, 0.141, and 0.076 mg/ml. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were carried out using an AN-60 Ti Analytical rotor with standard double-sector centerpieces and quartz windows at 11500 rpm. Equilibrium was reached after 65 h as determined by comparing scans taken at 5-h intervals. Equilibrated scans were used for determining equilibrium association constants for the self-association of BlaI-WT. Equilibrium data were analyzed by nonlinear least squares fitting of primary absorbance data using the Mixedfit program for Windows from L. Holladay (19Kelly L. Holladay L.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5062-5069Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 20Holladay L.A. Sophianopoulos A.J. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 57: 506-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). To determine the best model for describing the BlaI multimerization, the data were fitted by using the following ideal equilibrium models: monomer-dimer, monomer-dimer-tetramer, or isodesmic models 1, 2, and 4. The best fit was determined by examining the distributions of residuals. To determine the mode of multimerization and the dissociation constant of the BlaI-WT dimer-monomer equilibrium, sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation experiments were conducted over a large concentration range, and experimental data were collected at 280 nm. Typical data sets are displayed in Fig.2. For the analysis of these data, the measured absorbance at 280 nm versus the radial position were fitted to mathematical functions describing various self-association systems (monomer-dimer equilibrium, monomer-dimer-tetramer equilibrium, and isodesmic models 1, 2, and 4). The best fit for BlaI-WT multimerization was obtained for isodesmic model 2 shown in Fig. 3. By using this model, the distributions of residuals (Fig. 2B) were in good agreement with the experimental data obtained at each protein concentration. Moreover, the calculated quantity of protein was equal to that introduced in the ultracentrifuge cell. Analysis of the experimental data revealed that there were monomeric, dimeric, tetrameric, and hexameric species in solution. Following isodesmic model 2, the monomeric, dimeric, tetrameric, and hexameric concentrations were calculated and are listed in TableII. Equilibrium sedimentation experiments showed that BlaI-WT can be present in solution as monomer, dimer, tetramer, and hexamer in the 10–30 ॖm range of protein concentration with a dissociation constant K1estimated to 25 ॖm, which is the same for each equilibrium.Figure 3Isodesmic model 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IIConcentration of monomer, dimer, tetramer, and hexamer calculated by isodesmic model 2 starting from equilibrium ultracentrifugation data (K1 = 25 ॖm)Initial BlaI-WT concentrationCalculated BlaI-WT concentration by using isodesmic model 2Calculated total BlaI-WT concentration[Monomer][Dimer][Tetramer][Hexamer]mg/mlmol/litermg/mlmol/litermg/mlmol/litermol/litermg/ml0.4471.56 × 10−50.2347.97 × 10−60.2393.22 × 10−117.96 × 10−160.4730.3861.41 × 10−50.2126.52 × 10−60.1963.28 × 10−114.75 × 10−160.4070.3301.31 × 10−50.1985.67 × 10−60.1702.38 × 10−112.46 × 10−160.3680.2761.22 × 10−50.1844.93 × 10−60.1481.87 × 10−118.11 × 10−170.3320.2188.63 × 10−60.132.45 × 10−60.0731.05 × 10−113.46 × 10−170.2030.1416.08 × 10−60.0911.22 × 10−60.0363.71 × 10−127.15 × 10−180.128 Open table in a new tab In prelude to this work, the cell titers of B. licheniformis749/I and B. subtilis/pDML995 were correlated to the OD600 nm values of bacterial culture. Cytoplasmic extracts from several midlog phase cultures of B. licheniformis 749/I and B. subtilis/pDML995 were analyzed by Western blotting. The concentration of BlaI in cytoplasmic extracts was estimated with a standard curve prepared with purified BlaI. To take account of possible BlaI proteolysis during sample preparation, the standard curve was obtained by the addition of purified BlaI to pDML995-free B. subtilis cells from a midlog phase culture and by identical preparations of cytoplasmic extracts. According to the B. subtilis cell volume (10−15 liters) determined by Abril et al. (21Abril A.M. Salas M. Andreu J.M. Hermoso J.M. Rivas G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11901-11908Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), the cytoplasmic concentrations of BlaI in B. licheniformis 749/I and B. subtilis/pDML995 were estimated at about 1.9 ॖm (1,100 BlaI monomers/cell) and 75 ॖm (45,000 BlaI monomers/cell), respectively (Fig.4). By comparison with the dissociation constants estimated by equilibrium centrifugation, these results indicate that BlaI is partially present as a dimer in B. licheniformis 749/I (217 dimer) and mainly in B. subtilis/pDML995 (757 dimer). Dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) cross-linking experiments with cytoplasmic extracts of B. subtilis/pDML995 yielded a similar conclusion (16Filée P. Benlafya K. Delmarcelle M. Moutzourelis G. Frère J.M. Joris B. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 685-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Firstly, we examined the binding curve of BlaI to its three operators. A fixed concentration of labeled operator (5 nm) was incubated with increasing concentrations of purified BlaI (3.3 nm to 0.33 ॖm) for 2 h before loading onto the gels. Analysis of the electropherograms revealed the presence of two peaks. The faster and the slower peaks correspond to the unbound operator and the BlaI dimer-operator complex, respectively (16Filée P. Benlafya K. Delmarcelle M. Moutzourelis G. Frère J.M. Joris B. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 685-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). No peak corresponding to BlaI monomer-operator was observed under these conditions. As presented in Fig.5, a sigmoidal binding curve was observed for each operator. For OP1, the Scatchard plot (Fig.6) indicated a 2/1 stoichiometry for the BlaI-operator complex, which confirms that the retarded DNA observed on the electropherograms corresponds to the BlaI dimer-operator complex. A Hill plot of the data obtained between 10 and 907 of OP1 saturation (Fig. 7) yielded a Hill coefficient of 2. This value corresponds to a pathway in which two BlaI monomers simultaneously bind the operator. This situation does not allow us to distinguish between the dimer pathway and a highly cooperative monomer pathway (18Filée P. Delmarcelle M. Thamm I. Joris B. BioTechniques. 2001; 30 (1050–1051): 1044-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) (Fig. 8) characterized by a sequential binding of monomers to each half-operator. The dimer is formed when the second monomer interacts with the free half-operator.Figure 6Scatchard plot of the data obtained with the OP1 operator.N is the ratio between the bound BlaI monomer concentration and the total operator concentration.L corresponds to the free BlaI monomer concentration.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 7Hill plot of the data obtained for 10–907 saturation of OP1. α corresponds to the fraction of Bound operator.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 8DNA-binding pathways of BlaI to its operators.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 9 shows band shift assays performed by incubating BlaI with the semi-conserved OP1 operator (half-OP1; Table I). The half-OP1 is a 30-bp-long oligonucleotide in which the right half-binding site of OP1 is completely degenerated. In the presence or absence of nonspecific DNA, no complex corresponding to BlaI monomer-half-OP1 was detected. In these conditions, only the BlaI dimer-half-OP1 complex could be visualized, but the affinity of the BlaI dimer for the half-OP1 was considerably reduced compared with OP1. In this study, all of the band shift assays were done with BlaI concentrations well below the dissociation constant of the BlaI dimer estimated by equilibrium ultracentrifugation. This implicates that BlaI dimer formation could be the rate-limiting step in the BlaI-DNA binding reaction and could be responsible for the sigmoidal binding curves. This hypothesis is reinforced by binding time courses of BlaI to OP1. In this assay, 16 nm BlaI and 5 nm OP1 were incubated at 30 °C. The samples were taken after different incubation times and submitted to the electrophoresis. Fig.10 shows that the fraction of bound OP1 stabilizes after 2 h. Because no BlaI monomer-DNA complex was observed in band shift assays, it can be concluded that a high degree of cooperativity prevails in the monomer pathway or that the dimer pathway is valid. Under these conditions, the fraction of bound DNA is [BlaI]2/([BlaI]2 +K1·K1′) according to the dimer pathway and [BlaI]2/([BlaI]2 +K2′·K3′) according to the highly cooperative monomer pathway. Only the global dissociation constant K (K =K1·K1′) can be estimated on the basis of the data of Fig. 5. The values are shown in Table III together with theK1′ values calculated on the basis of aK1 (dimer/monomer) dissociation constant of 25 ॖm (see above). These results reveal that the affinity of BlaI for the operator sequences increase in the order OP3 < OP2 < OP1.Table IIIEquilibrium parameters of the BlaI-operator interactionsKK1′10−15m2mOP11.7 ± 0.54 × 10−11OP23.3 ± 0.97.76 × 10−11OP310.5 ± 2.52.5 × 10−10K (=K1 × K1′) was derived from the data shown in Fig. 5 on the basis of the equation given in the text for the dimer pathway.

Previously, we reported that the औ-lactamase induction inB. licheniformis 749/I first requires both an acylation of BlaR1 by a औ-lactam and a औ-lactam stress of the cell (6Joris B. Ledent P. Kobayashi T. Lampen J.O. Ghuysen J.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1990; 58: 107-113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Filée P. Benlafya K. Delmarcelle M. Moutzourelis G. Frère J.M. Joris B. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 685-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Our studies also indicated that in B. licheniformis749/I, the hydrolysis of BlaI during औ-lactamase induction was a consequence of its inactivation. This hypothesis was supported by the fact that in an induced B. subtilis/pDML995 strain, BlaI lost its DNA binding capacity but retained its ability to dimerize. In our working model, the inactivation of BlaI occurs by interaction with a coactivator that induces an inactive conformation of the BlaI dimer. As a result of this conformational change, the susceptibility of the BlaI dimer to the cytoplasmic proteases would be increased in B. licheniformis 749/I. The mechanism by which this conformational change prevents the binding of BlaI to its operators is not clarified yet. The interaction between DNA-binding proteins and operators with a dyad symmetry can follow two distinct mechanisms (22Kohler J.J. Metallo S.J. Schneider T.L. Schepartz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11735-11739Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar): the monomer pathway and the dimer pathway (Fig. 8). The former is often cooperative and is observed for the LexA bacterial transcriptional repressor (23Mohana-Borges R. Pacheco A.B.F. Sousa F.J.R. Foguel D. Almeida D.F. Silva J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4708-4712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 24Kim B. Little J.W. Science. 1992; 255: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Many regulators bind DNA according to the dimer pathway (25Steinmetzer K. Behlke J. Brantl S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 595-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Because a helix-turn-helix recognition motif interacts only with five or six base pairs, the ability of this class of DNA-binding proteins to form dimers and higher order oligomers is fundamental to stabilize its binding to target DNA. In this study, equilibrium ultracentrifugation experiments showed that at concentrations in the micromolar range, BlaI monomers, dimers, and tetramers were present in solution and that the BlaI multimerization follows a pathway described by isodesmic model 2 (Fig. 3). By fitting the experimental data, a dissociation constant of 25 ॖmwas found for the dissociation of the BlaI dimer, tetramer, or hexamer. To determine the in vivo concentration of BlaI, quantitative analysis of cytoplasmic extracts were performed by Western blotting. According to these results, it appeared that the intracellular concentration of BlaI in B. licheniformis 749/I (1.9 ॖm) is significantly lower than the dissociation constant of the BlaI dimer so that BlaI should be only partially dimeric in the cell. In B. subtilis transformed by the pDML995, a high copy number plasmid, the intracellular concentration of BlaI (75 ॖm), is 3-fold higher that the dissociation constant so that multimeric forms of BlaI are predominant. This result confirms previous cross-linking experiments in which the addition of increasing concentrations of dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) to cytoplasmic extracts permitted the recovery of most of the BlaI signal as a dimer both in the absence and presence of औ-lactams antibiotics (16Filée P. Benlafya K. Delmarcelle M. Moutzourelis G. Frère J.M. Joris B. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 685-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In consequence, it appears that the preformed BlaI dimer is present in both B. licheniformis 749/I and B. subtilis/pDML995 although in very different proportions. The fluorescent band shift assays presented in this study revealed that the binding curves of BlaI to its operators are sigmoidal, suggesting that the binding parameters of BlaI include two equilibria. For each operator, the fluorograms were characterized by slower and faster bands corresponding to free operators and BlaI dimer-operator complexes, respectively (Fig. 9). In Scatchard plots, saturation of the operator by BlaI was reached at a molar ratio of 2 (Fig. 6). In these conditions, no BlaI monomer-operator complex was detected. In the monomer pathway, this would indicate a very strong cooperativity. Indeed, the Hill coefficient was 2, a value indicating a situation where the binding of the two monomers to the operator is simultaneous. Consequently, in this case, the monomer pathway and the dimer pathway cannot be distinguished on the basis of the Hill coefficient. By using the semi-conserved operator OP1 (half-OP1), additional arguments were found that favor the dimer pathway. In these experiments, we observed the formation of a complex between the BlaI dimer and half-OP1 both in the absence and the presence of nonspecific DNA. The absence of BlaI monomer-half-OP1 complex seems to exclude the possibility that the binding of BlaI occurs according to the monomer pathway. Previously, we obtained similar results by mass spectrometry that only the BlaI dimer could bind to the OP1 operator (26Gabelica V. Vreuls C. Filée P. Duval V. Joris B. De Pauw E. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2002; 16: 1723-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and the semi-conserved OP1 operator. 1C. Vreuls and V. Gabelica, unpublished data. To substantiate the dimer pathway model, a time course of the binding reaction was performed in conditions where BlaI was predominantly present as a monomer ([BlaI] = 0.016 ॖm). The determination of the fraction of bound DNA revealed that the equilibrium of the DNA binding reaction was only reached after 2 h. These results underline the presence of a rate-limiting step that could be the dimerization of BlaI. Finally, it was also shown that BlaI recognized the three specific operators with distinct global dissociation constants ranging from 10−15 to 10−14m2. Because the dissociation of the BlaI dimer was 25 ॖm, the dissociation constants of the BlaI dimer-operator complexes are between 10−11 and 10−10m. These values are typical of prokaryotic repressors with helix-turn-helix recognition motifs (25Steinmetzer K. Behlke J. Brantl S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 595-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 27Strausak D. Solioz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8932-8936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Comparison of the global dissociation constants indicates that BlaI presents increasing affinities for OP3 < OP2 < OP1. In regard to the nucleotide alignments of the operators presented in Fig. 1. It appears that the OP1 operator, which has the highest affinity for BlaI, is similar to the nucleotidic consensus sequence of the three operators of the bladivergeon. Consequently, these results suggest that in the absence of औ-lactam antibiotics, transcription from the blaPpromoter, containing the OP1 and OP2 operators, is more repressed than that from the blaI-blaR1 promoter, which includes the OP3 operator. It has not been verified yet whether cooperative binding occurs between the three operators of the bla divergeon. Nevertheless, this hypothesis is supported by equilibrium ultracentrifugation and chemical cross-linking experiments (16Filée P. Benlafya K. Delmarcelle M. Moutzourelis G. Frère J.M. Joris B. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 685-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) that reveal that BlaI is able to form higher order multimers. In addition, the analysis of the intergenic region of the bla divergeon reveals that the distance between OP1 and OP3 operators is 168 bp or 17 helical turns, indicating that these operators are on the same side of the DNA and could be involved in a looping of the DNA. In conclusion, it is highly probable that the repression of औ-lactamase synthesis in B. licheniformis 749/I requires preformed BlaI dimers (Fig. 11). In the presence of inducer, activation of the metalloprotease domain of the BlaR penicillin receptor and औ-lactam stress suffered by the cell generate a coactivator in the cytoplasm. This coactivator induces a conformational change of the BlaI dimer that yields an inactive form of the repressor by a mechanism similar to that described for the inactivation of the TetR repressor involved in the tetracycline resistance in Gram-negative bacteria (28Orth P. Schnappinger D. Hillen W. Saenger W. Hinrichs W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Indeed, the binding of tetracycline to the C-terminal domain of the TetR repressor homodimer induces a conformational change that increases the distance between the two N-terminal binding domains of the dimer by 3 Å, abolishing the affinity of TetR for its operator without destabilizing the dimer."

The predicted 270-amino acid sequence contains an N-terminal signal peptide, an immunoglobin domain in the extracellular region, a transmembrane domain and an ITAM in the cytoplasmic tail. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR showed that CNAIP was preferentially expressed in neutrophils, monocytes, mast cells, and other immune-related cells. Co-transfection of CNAIP expression constructs with luciferase reporter plasmids in HMC-1 cells resulted in activation of interleukin-13 and tumor necrosis factor-α promoters, which was mediated through the calcineurin/NFAT-signaling pathway. Mutation of either or both tyrosines in the ITAM abolished transcriptional activation induced by CNAIP, indicating that the ITAM is indispensable for CNAIP function in activating cytokine gene promoters. Thus, it is concluded that CNAIP is a novel ITAM-containing protein that activates the calcineurin/NFAT-signaling pathway and the downstream cytokine gene promoters.

Immunol. Res. 1997; 16: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The signals sensed by the receptors are relayed through their cytoplasmic signaling modules or adaptor molecules to regulate various cellular activities. The immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)1 is one of such signal modules present in cytoplasmic tails of many antigen and Fc receptors such as T cell receptor (TCR), B cell receptor (BCR), FcεRIऔ, and FcεRIγ. The consensus of ITAM (YXX(L/I)X6–8YXX(L/I)) has been deduced from sequence analysis of existing ITAM-containing receptors (2Cambier J.C. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3281-3285PubMed Google Scholar). In T cells, following the antigen binding to TCR α and औ chain, the two tyrosine residues in the ITAM are phosphorylated by Src-family protein tyrosine kinase, Lck or Fyn (1Isakov N. Immunol. Res. 1997; 16: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The phosphotyrosines, in turn, participate in and physically interact with the signal-amplifying kinase, Syk/ZAP-70, as well as other SH2 domain-containing proteins, which leads to the activation of downstream signaling pathways (1Isakov N.

Immunol. 2000; 165: 7215-7223Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). During a comprehensive search for novel activating receptors expressed on cell surface using the bioinformatics approach, we identified a human gene that encodes a novel ITAM-containing protein. Expression of this protein in HMC-1 cells activated transcription of IL-13 and TNF-α promoters, which was mediated through the calcineurin/NFAT-signaling pathway. Therefore, the newly identified protein was named calcineurin/NFATactivating and ITAM-containingprotein, or CNAIP. We report here its identification, gene structure and stimulatory role for NFAT. The protein data base compiled by International Protein Index (IPI) (www.ensembl.org/IPI/) containing ∼65,000 protein sequences (as of March 2002) was used as data source in this study. A hidden Markov model (HMM)-based method was employed for Ig-domain search against IPI data base. The HMM, which was built from an alignment of 113 confident Ig domains and calibrated using the program HMMER, was obtained from the Pfam (version 6.6) data base (25Eddy S.R. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (4104) Google Scholar). To identify ITAM-containing proteins, a PROSITE-formatted motif profile was first constructed based on the common features of ITAM motif, and the software “seedtop” (NCBI) was used to perform the search. Large-scale transmembrane region prediction for all of the IPI proteins was carried out by using software TMHMM version 2.0 (26Moller S. Croning M.D. Apweiler R. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 646-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar) (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/). The three sets of genes generated above were then overlapped to identify molecules with all of the common features by a relational data base system. In silico cloning was carried out as follows: the starting sequence was blasted against the human database of expressed sequence tag (NBCI) data base, the resulting hits were assembled as a contig, which was then reblasted against database of expressed sequence tag. This process was proceeded in a cyclic fashion until no more new expressed sequence tag hits could be found. Protein signal peptide prediction was performed by using both SignalP (27Nielsen H. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar) and SOSUIsignal (28Hirokawa T. Boon-Chieng S. Mitaku S. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 378-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (1577) Google Scholar). Potential glycosylation sites were identified by PROSITE (29Falquet L. Pagni M. Bucher P. Hulo N. Sigrist C.J. Hofmann K. Bairoch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). Protein fold recognition was performed by using 3D-PSSM (30Kelley L.A. MacCallum R.M. Sternberg M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 499-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar, 36Fischer D. Barret C. Bryson K. Elofsson A. Godzik A. Jones D. Karplus K.J. Kelley L.A. MacCallum R.M. Pawowski K. Rost B. Rychlewski L. Sternberg M. Proteins. 1999; Suppl. 3: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Human HMC-1 and 293T cells were routinely cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, respectively, supplemented with 107 fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 1 ॖg/ml penicillin and streptomycin. Cyclosporin A (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) was added to the culture medium at the indicated concentration. The cDNA encompassing CNAIP coding region was amplified by PCR and cloned into pcDNA3.1D/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen) by using two oligonucleotide primers derived from the predicted cDNA sequence. The cDNA sequence was verified by sequencing the entire insert, and the construct was termed CNAIP-V5C. An alternative CNAIP expression plasmid termed CNAIP-V5N was constructed by subcloning a PCR fragment into pSecTag/FRT/V5-His-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), which contains the truncated CNAIP coding region from the 43rd amino acid to the stop codon and a V5 tag fused at the N-terminal truncation site. Mutagenesis of tyrosine residues in the ITAM was generated on CNAIP-V5N backbone by PCR SOEing as described (31Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar), and verified by sequencing. A full-length construct for expression of wild type CNAIP was generated by cloning the entire coding region sequence into pcDNA3.1. The cDNA sequence was verified by sequencing the entire insert on both strands. For transient transfection, six to eight ॖg of protein expression plasmids were transfected into 293T or HMC-1 cells in a 50-mm dish with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. The transfected cells were cultured for 40–48 h and lysed in either 1× sample buffer directly or protein extraction buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 70 mm KCl, pH 7.6) through freeze-thaw cycles. The membrane protein was separated from the soluble proteins by high-speed centrifugation. The protein extracts produced by cell lysis were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, which was blocked with 57 dry milk in TBST (10 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, with 0.057 Tween), then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-V5 monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen), and the signal was developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) assay kit (Amersham Biosciences). Total RNA samples of various human tissues were obtained from Clontech, and total RNAs from cultured cells were purified by using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). First-strand cDNA was synthesized using the total RNA and SuperScript II reagent (Invitrogen). Briefly, the reaction was set in a volume of 19 ॖl with 1.5 ॖg of total RNA, 2 pmol of each primer, 4 ॖl of 5× first-strand buffer (10 mm dithiothreitol and 0.2 mm dNTP). The mixture was heated to 70 °C for 10 min and then cooled to 42 °C when 1 ॖl (200 units) SuperScript II was added. The mixture was then incubated for 1 h at 42 °C and then heated to 70 °C for 15 min. RT-PCR was performed as duplex RT-PCR using औ-actin as a standard. Oligonucleotide primers were designed using Primer Express 2.0 (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA) and were synthesized and used in RT-PCR reactions to monitor the real-time expression of CNAIP. RNA samples were isolated from the following tissues and cells: brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, spleen, monocytes, Daudi (a Burkitt's lymphoma cell line), HPB-ALL (a T cell leukemia cell line), THP-1 (acute monocytic leukemia; lymphocytes), Jurkat (a T cell leukemia cell line), HMC-1 (a mast cell line), human vascular endothelial cells (primary human vascular endothelial cells), neutrophils, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and four different batches of in vitro cultured cord-blood-derived mast cell samples. Real-time quantitative PCR was performed with the ABI Prism 7900 (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) sequence detection system, using Taqman reagents, according to the manufacture's instructions. Equal amounts of each of the RNAs from the tissues and cell lines indicated above were used as PCR templates in reactions to obtain the threshold cycle (Ct), and the Ct was normalized using the known Ct from 18 S RNAs to obtain ΔCt. To compare relative levels of gene expression of CNAIP in different tissues and cell lines, ΔΔCt values were calculated by using the lowest expression level as the base, which were then converted to real fold expression difference values. Luciferase reporter plasmids, NFAT-luc, NF-κB-luc, and AP-1-luc were purchased from Clontech. The luciferase reporter plasmids, IL-13-luc, TNF-α-luc, and FcεRIα-luc, were constructed by inserting 1.7 kb, 2.4 kb and 1.5 kb promoter sequences derived from IL-13, TNF-α, and FcεRIα genes into pTA-Luc vector (Clontech), respectively. All of the promoter sequences used were starting from a putative transcription start site extending to the 5′ upstream region. HMC-1 cells were seeded onto a 24-well culture plate at the density of 0.2 million cells per milliliter of medium. Three plasmids, a firefly luciferase reporter with a defined promoter, CNAIP expression plasmid, andRenilla luciferase control plasmid, pRL-SV40 (Promega, Inc., Madison, WI), were co-transfected into HMC-1 cells. Cells were harvested 40–46 h after transfection and lysed in lysis buffer. Both firefly and Renila luciferase activities were assayed with the dual luciferase assay kit (Promega). The fluorescent light emission was determined by TD-20 luminometer (Turner Design, Sunnylvale, CA). The transfected 293T cells were washed and pre-incubated at 4 °C for 20 min in the enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer containing 17 bovine serum albumin (Invitrogen). Cells were then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-V5 monoclonal antibody (10 ॖg/ml) (Invitrogen) in the same buffer for 30 min. After three washes, cells were fixed in 1 × phosphate-buffered saline with 17 paraformaldehyde. Alternatively, the cells were first fixed in methanol for 5 min at room temperature and rinsed three times before the immunostaining. The samples were analyzed by FACScan (BD Biosciences) or fluorescence microscopy. Non-redundant human protein data base IPI was searched for novel molecules containing 1) Ig domain, 2) ITAM, and 3) transmembrane region. Those are common features shared by many signal-activating receptors mediating immune system functions, including components of TCR, BCR, FcεRI, and several other recently identified activating receptors (2Cambier J.C. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3281-3285PubMed Google Scholar, 3Love P.E. Shores E.W. Immunity. 2000; 12: 591-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 32Chan A.C. Shaw A.S.

A hypothetical protein sequence labeled as “IPI00086590” was identified that satisfied all three criteria. In silicocDNA-cloning procedure was used to derive its full-length cDNA sequence. To verify this cDNA, we designed two oligo primers encompassing the putative starting methionine codon and stop codon, and amplified the cDNA from human monocytes by RT-PCR. Two cDNA clones were isolated, sequenced, and found to be identical to the in silico cloning-derived coding region sequence (Fig.1A). The analysis of immediate 5′ flanking sequence to the coding region revealed a perfect Kozak motif, and several in-frame stop codons preceding the predicted initiation methionine. Furthermore, this cDNA contains a putative signal peptide starting from the initiation methionine with a predicted cleavage site between amino acids 42 and 43. Based on the structural features and functionality that we elucidated, we designated this protein calcineurin/NFAT-activating and ITAM-containing protein, or CNAIP. CNAIP encodes a polypeptide with 270 amino acid residues and a calculated molecular mass of ∼30 kDa. It is predicted to be a type I transmembrane protein, which contains a putative signal peptide at the N-terminal (amino acids 1–42), an Ig-domain (amino acids 50–150) in the extracellular region, a transmembrane domain (amino acids 164–186), and an ITAM (amino acids 220–235) in the cytoplasmic region (Fig. 1B). One potential N-glycosylation site was found in the extracellular region (amino acids 107–110). The Ig-domain most likely adopts a V-type fold based on 3D-PSSM fold recognition algorithm (30Kelley L.A. MacCallum R.M. Sternberg M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 499-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar, 36Fischer D. Barret C. Bryson K. Elofsson A. Godzik A. Jones D. Karplus K.J. Kelley L.A. MacCallum R.M. Pawowski K. Rost B. Rychlewski L. Sternberg M. Proteins. 1999; Suppl. 3: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). CNAIP has been mapped to chromosome 22q13.2 by sequence similarity search. Alignment of cDNA with genomic sequence showed that the coding region of CNAIP comprises six exons (Fig. 1C). Sequence similarity search against various public data bases showed that CNAIP does not share statistically significant similarity with any known proteins. The CNAIP mRNA expression levels in a number of human cells and tissues were assessed using real time quantitative RT-PCR. The results showed that CNAIP was highly expressed in neutrophils, primary monocytes and monocytic cell lines (THP-1), lymphocytes, and in vitro cultured mast cells derived from cord blood (Fig. 2). The expression in spleen and lung was also evident. In contrast, the CNAIP expression in all other tissues and cells (brain, heart, kidney, liver, Daudi, HPB-ALL, Jurkat, HMC-1, and HUVAC) was low, suggesting that the primary role of CNAIP may be restricted to the immune system. Interestingly, the CNAIP expression level in more mature mast cells (cultured for 7 weeks and 867 tryptase-stained positive) is about 3-fold higher than that in the earlier stage of mast cells (cultured for 4 weeks and 177 tryptase-stained positive). To characterize the CNAIP gene product, we made two expression constructs, one with a V5 tag fused in frame to the C terminus of CNAIP coding region (CNAIP-V5C) and the other with the native signal peptide replaced by a heterologous signal peptide in the vector, which is immediately followed by a V5 tag fused to the N-terminal region of the truncated CNAIP (CNAIP-V5N). Transient transfection of CNAIP-V5C into 293T cells showed two protein bands of ∼33 and 36 kDa in Western blot, which are absent in cells transfected with the empty vector (data not shown). In protein fractions prepared by freeze-thaw cycle and high-speed centrifugation, the 33 and 36 kDa proteins were only detected in the insoluble membrane fraction, not in the soluble cytosol fraction (Fig. 3), indicating that CNAIP is a membrane-associated protein. Immunofluorescence staining was then performed to further determine the subcellular localization and the orientation of CNAIP in the membrane. FACS analysis of 293T cells transfected with CNAIP-V5N or CNAIP-V5C showed that N terminus-tagged CNAIP was detected only in the living cells transfected with CNAIP-V5N (Fig. 4) but not in the living cells transfected with CNAIP-V5C (data not shown). However, fixation of the cells transfected with the two expression constructs resulted in unambiguous detection of both the N terminus- and C terminus-tagged protein by FACS and fluorescent microscopy (data not shown). These results indicated that CNAIP is a transmembrane protein with the N terminus exposed to the outside of the cellular membrane. The co-existence of Ig domain and ITAM motif in CNAIP, along with the preferential expression in immune cells, strongly suggest that CNAIP may function as an activating receptor in immune system. To test if CNAIP can activate the transcription of cytokine genes, we co-transfected CNAIP-V5N with luciferase reporter constructs that were linked to IL-13, TNF-α, or FcεRIα promoter in HMC-1 cells. The luciferase reporter assays showed that CNAIP increased IL-13 and TNF-α promoter activities by ∼14- and ∼5-fold, respectively, as compared with the expression vector control. In contrast, the FcεRIα promoter-linked luciferase activity was not changed (Fig. 5A). It was well documented that NFAT is involved in transcriptional activation of cytokine genes, such as IL-13 (18Macian F. Garcia-Rodriguez C. Rao A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4783-4795Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) and TNF-α (20Luo C. Burgeon E. Carew J.A. McCaffrey P.G. Badalian T.M. Lane W.S. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3955-3966Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), and that ITAM-containing receptors, upon ligand binding, can lead to the activation of several transcription factors including NFAT (37Qian D. Mollenauer M.N. Weiss A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 611-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), NF-κB (38Khan W.N. Immunol. Res. 2001; 23: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and AP-1 (39Palanki M.S. Curr. Med. Chem. 2002; 9: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To test whether NFAT, NF-κB, and/or AP-1 are potential downstream targets of the CNAIP-signaling pathway, we assessed the NFAT, NF-κB, or AP-1 luciferase reporter activity by transient transfection with CNAIP-V5N in HMC-1 cells. Expression of CNAIP elevated NFAT luciferase reporter activity by ∼19-fold as compared with the transfection with the vector only, whereas the NF-κB or AP-1 luciferase reporter activities showed no significant changes (Fig. 5A). To confirm that full-length CNAIP with its native signal peptide can also activate NFAT, we co-expressed a full-length construct of CNAIP with an NFAT luciferase reporter. Expression of full-length CNAIP also elevated NFAT luciferase reporter by ∼9-fold as compared with the transfection with a control vector (Fig. 5C). These data were reproducible in three separate experiments. Because calcium flux and calcineurin activation are signaling events upstream of NFAT activation (12Feske S. Giltnane J. Dolmetsch R. Staudt L.M. Rao A. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), we tested whether the CNAIP/calcineurin/NFAT-signaling pathway could be blocked by cyclosporin A, a immune-suppressive agent which specifically inhibits calcineurin activation. Addition of 1 ॖm of cyclosporin A to the culture inhibited CNAIP-mediated NFAT activation by ∼907 (Fig. 6), indicating that CNAIP can activate calcineurin/NFAT-mediated signaling cascade and therefore activate transcription of NFAT-regulated cytokine genes. Sequence analysis of CNAIP revealed a good match of ITAM in the cytoplasmic tail (Fig. 1B). To determine whether the putative ITAM motif mediates the signal transduction, we generated three CNAIP mutants (Y220A, Y231A, and Y220A/Y231A) by replacing the two tyrosines (Tyr-220 and Tyr-231) in the ITAM to alanine individually or in combination. Transfection of either of these mutants into HMC-1 cells failed to activate IL-13, TNF-α, or NFAT luciferase reporter activity (Fig. 5). The relative luciferase reporter activity in these cells was comparable with that of cells transfected with vector control (Fig. 5A). Western blot analysis showed that mutant proteins were expressed at similar level as that of wild type CNAIP (Fig. 5B), indicating that mutations do not affect the expression and stability of CNAIP in these cells. These data indicated that activation of the calcineurin/NFAT-signaling pathway by CNAIP is mediated by ITAM, and both tyrosine residues are required for the ITAM-mediated function in CNAIP. In the present report, we describe the identification of a novel ITAM-containing protein, CNAIP, that activates NFAT, IL-13, and TNF-α promoter activity. Our data suggest the CNAIP may function as an activating receptor. ITAM-containing receptors are a divergent group of cell surface membrane proteins that are expressed in immune-related cells and regulate cell growth, maturation, apoptosis, and cell activation. Members of this family include Igα, Igऔ, TCR-ζ, TCR-η, CD3γ, CD3δ, CD3ε, FcεRIऔ, and FcεRIγ. Some of them contain Ig or Ig-like domains in the extracellular region, which are involved in protein-protein interaction. Similar to those receptors, CNAIP contains an Ig domain in the extracellular region. Some ITAM-containing receptors transduce signal within a multi-subunit of immune receptor complexes such as TCR and BCR. It is not clear at present whether CNAIP is a component of an immune receptor complex or functions as a single unit. Interestingly, overexpression of CNAIP can activate downstream effectors without ligand binding or antibody cross-linking. The mechanisms by which CNAIP activates the signaling pathway remain to be determined. However, it is possible that overexpression of CNAIP proteins in the cells results in the aggregation or clustering of the receptors on cell surface, which leads to the recruitment of downstream effector to the receptor molecules that subsequently lead to its activation. The ITAM consensus sequence (YxxL/Ix6–8YxxL/I) contains two appropriately spaced tyrosine residues (33Isakov N. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 61: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Following receptor engagement, phosphorylation of the two tyrosines by Src family kinases creates temporary anchors for SH2-containing signaling proteins that recruit to the receptor site (3Love P.E. Shores E.W. Immunity. 2000; 12: 591-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In our studies, mutation of either of the two tyrosine residues in the ITAM of CNAIP abolished the activating activity mediated by CNAIP. Thus, like other ITAM-containing activating receptors (40Johnson S.A. Pleiman C.M. Pao L. Schneringer J. Hippen K. Cambier J.C. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4596-4603PubMed Google Scholar), the phosphorylation of the two tyrosine residues is critical for its activity. It was well documented that in mast cells the tyrosines in the ITAM of FcεRI औ and γ subunits are rapidly phosphorylated upon IgE cross-linking. The phosphotyrosines are then engaged in recruiting and activating Src-related protein receptor kinases, Lyn and Fyn, and signal amplifying kinase, Syk (33Isakov N. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 61: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The reminiscent functionality of ITAMs found in other immunoreceptor complexes was established through extensive experimental research, such as those in TCR and BCR (1Isakov N. Immunol. Res. 1997; 16: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that CNAIP may transduce its activating signal through the ITAM in the manner similar to that of the other ITAM-containing proteins. However, the divergence and multiplicity of ITAM domains might determine which Src-related receptor kinase(s) and SH2-containing protein would be recruited (3Love P.E. Shores E.W. Immunity. 2000; 12: 591-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Because the ITAM sequence of CNAIP displays no close similarity to any existing ITAMs except for the four conserved positions (Fig. 1B), it is not known yet what kinase(s) or SH2-containing protein(s) are recruited to the ITAM of CNAIP. The gene structure and topology of CNAIP resemble other activating molecules such as NKp44 and TREMs (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells molecules). All those molecules are type I transmembrane protein with a single Ig domain in the extracellular region, and transduce signals via ITAM motif, which is contained in either the cytoplasmic region of the molecule or its associated adaptor molecule DAP12. Moreover, both TREMs and CNAIP are abundantly expressed in neutrophils and monocytes. However, sequence similarity between CNAIP and TREM and NKp44 is very low (<107) and statistically insignificant. TREM-1 was recently characterized and found to function as an activating receptor (41Bouchon A. Facchetti F. Weigand M.A. Colonna M. Nature. 2001; 410: 1103-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). It is expressed at high levels on neutrophils and monocytes that infiltrate human tissues infected with bacteria and plays a critical role in acute inflammatory responses to bacteria (41Bouchon A. Facchetti F. Weigand M.A. Colonna M. Nature. 2001; 410: 1103-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that CNAIP may play similar roles in acute inflammation, which are characterized by an exudate of neutrophils and monocytes (42Bouchon A. Dietrich J. Colonna M. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 4991-4995Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). Further studies are aimed to identify the functional role of CNAIP in the immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W1966590345,"The folding and assembly of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), a potent mitogen involved in wound-healing processes and member of the cystine knot growth factor family, was studied. The kinetics of the formation of disulfide-bonded dimers were investigated under redox reshuffling conditions starting either from unfolded and reduced PDGF-A- or B-chains or an equimolar mixture of both chains. It is shown that in all cases the formation of disulfide-bonded dimers is a very slow process occurring in the time scale of hours with a first-order rate-determining step. The formation of disulfide-bonded PDGF-AA or PDGF-BB homodimers displayed identical kinetics, indicating that both monomeric forms as well as the dimerized homodimer have similar folding and assembly pathways. In contrast, the formation of the heterodimer occurred three times more rapidly compared with the formation of the homodimers. As both monomeric forms revealed similar renaturation kinetics, it can be concluded that the first-order rate-determining folding step does not occur during monomer folding but must be attributed to conformational rearrangements of the dimerized, not yet disulfide-bonded protein. These structural rearrangements allow a more rapid formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds between the two different monomers of a heterodimer compared with the formation of the disulfide bonds between two identical monomers. The preferential formation of disulfide-bonded heterodimers from an equimolar mixture of unfolded A- and B-chains is thus a kinetically controlled process. Moreover, similar activation enthalpies for the formation of all different isoforms suggest that faster heterodimerization is controlled by entropic factors.

PDGF is a non-glycosylated protein that belongs to the family of dimeric cystine knot growth factors (5Isaacs N.W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The PDGF family consists of different gene products. The most prominent and long known members of this family are PDGF-A and -B. More recently, two new less abundant members, PDGF-C and -D, have been discovered (6Gilbertson D.G. Duff M.E. West J.W. Kelly J.D. Sheppard P.O. Hofstrand P.D. Gao Z. Shoemaker K. Bukowski T.R.

Lichenstein H.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The two different homologous monomers of PDGF, denoted as A- and B-chains, are known to exist in the three natural occurring dimeric isoforms PDGF-AA, -AB, and -BB (8Betsholtz C. Johnsson A. Heldin C.-H. Westermark B. Lind P. Urdea M.S. Eddy R. Shows T.B. Philpott K. Mellor A.L. Knott T.J. Scott J. Nature. 1986; 320: 695-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 9Hannink M. Donoghue D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 989: 1-10PubMed Google Scholar). These different isoforms have apparently distinct biological functions indicated, e.g. by their different binding affinities to the two different types of PDGF receptors (10Heldin C.H. Westermark B. Trends Genet. 1989; 5: 108-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). However, the majority of PDGF purified from human platelets is the disulfide-bonded heterodimeric growth factor (11Hammacher A. Hellman U. Johnsson A. Östman A. Gunnarsson K. Westermark B. Wasteson Å. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16493-16498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that heterodimerization is favored when both genes are coexpressed. Also, PDGF-AB disulfide-bonded heterodimers are almost exclusively formed from an equimolar mixture of unfolded and reduced A- and B-chains when renaturation is carried out under conditions that allow disulfide bond reshuffling (12Hoppe J. Weich H.A. Eichner W. Tatje D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 12Hoppe J. Weich H.A. Eichner W. Tatje D. Eur. J.

From all potential isoforms of the PDGF dimer, only the structure of the BB homodimer has been determined so far (Fig.1; Ref. 15Oefner C. D'Arcy A. Winkler F.K. Eggimann B. Hosang M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3921-3926Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). PDGF-BB is an all-β sheet protein of about 30 kDa and composed of two very flat subunits arranged head-to-tail and linked together by two intermolecular disulfide bonds (5Isaacs N.W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 15Oefner C. D'Arcy A. Winkler F.K. Eggimann B. Hosang M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3921-3926Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In addition to intermolecular disulfide bonds, each monomer contains an unusual knot-like arrangement of three intramolecular disulfide bridges where one disulfide bond threads through a loop formed by the two other disulfide bonds (5Isaacs N.W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 15Oefner C. D'Arcy A. Winkler F.K. Eggimann B. Hosang M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3921-3926Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). As all members of the cystine knot growth factor family share strong structural homology, it is most likely that the other PDGF isoforms are of almost identical structure as the BB isoform. The folding pathways of oligomeric proteins frequently exhibit very complex profiles, since unimolecular folding reactions and bimolecular association steps are involved (16Jaenicke R. Rudolph R. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 218-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 17Jaenicke R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3147-3161Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). In case of PDGF, the folding and association process becomes even more complex through the additional requirement for the formation of the unusual knot-like arrangement of the three intramolecular disulfide bridges and the formation of the two intermolecular disulfide bonds. Although many members of the cystine knot growth factor family are of enormous medical importance (e.g. PDGFs, transforming growth factors, bone morphogenetic proteins), almost no knowledge exists about the mechanisms governing their folding and assembly. Some more detailed studies have been carried out on the folding and association kinetics of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (18Philo J.S. Rosenfeld R. Arakawa T. Wen J. Narhi L.O. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10812-10818Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and nerve growth factor (19Rattenholl A. Ruoppolo M. Flagiello A. Monti M. Vinci F. Marino G. Lilie H. Schwarz E. Rudolph R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Both factors belong to a subgroup of the cystine knot growth factor family where the subunits are not connected by intermolecular disulfide bonds in the dimeric protein. Kinetic studies on the folding and assembly of those growth factors of the cystine knot family where the subunits are connected by disulfide bonds in the native protein are missing so far. It was commonly accepted that the presence of the cystine knot is a prerequisite for the dimerization of proteins belonging to the cystine knot growth factor family (5Isaacs N.W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). However, recent studies on the structure and stability of vascular endothelial growth factor, a member of PDGF superfamily of cystine knot growth factors, revealed that cystine deletion mutants lacking one of the two disulfide bonds forming the outer ring of the knot motif are still able to form disulfide-bonded dimers (20Muller Y.A. Heiring C. Misselwitz R. Welfle K. Welfle H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43410-43416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, these mutants even revealed an increased thermodynamic stability although their thermal stability was severely reduced (20Muller Y.A. Heiring C. Misselwitz R. Welfle K. Welfle H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43410-43416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, the formation of the cystine knot appears to be indispensable for the biological activity of PDGF (21Kenney W.C. Haniu M. Herman A.C. Arakawa T. Costigan V.J. Lary J. Yphantis D.A. Thomason A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12351-12359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while the intermolecular disulfide bridges have a stabilizing but non-essential effect on the biological activity (21Kenney W.C. Haniu M. Herman A.C. Arakawa T. Costigan V.J. Lary J. Yphantis D.A. Thomason A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12351-12359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Prestrelski S.J. Arakawa T. Duker K. Kenney W.C. Narhi L.O. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1994; 44: 357-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). PDGF is very prone to aggregation when renaturation is initiated by diluting unfolded and reduced monomers into a buffer, which allows refolding and disulfide bond reshuffling (14Müller C. Rinas U. J. Chromatogr. A. 1999; 855: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Once folded, however, PDGF is a very stable protein withstanding temperatures of up to 100 °C (23Raines E.W. Ross R. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 109: 749-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Previously, we have presented a renaturation method based on the utilization of size exclusion chromatography, which circumvents aggregation during refolding and allows renaturation of PDGF at high protein concentrations (14Müller C. Rinas U. J. Chromatogr. A. 1999; 855: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In this study, we present a kinetic analysis of the formation of disulfide-bonded dimers and propose a model for the folding pathway of the different isoforms of PDGF. The unfolded and reduced monomers of PDGF were subjected to size exclusion chromatography under renaturing conditions and the formation of disulfide-bonded dimers starting either from pure A- or B-chains or an equimolar mixture of both monomeric isoforms was followed in the eluate fraction. PDGF-BB structure data were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (www.rcsb.org/pdb/; accession number 1pdg) and visualized using the program RasMol, Version 2.7.2.1 (RasMol Molecular Renderer; R. Sayle, Glaxo Research and Development Greenford, Middlesex, UK). The different PDGF isoforms were produced as inclusion bodies using theEscherichia coli strain TG1 carrying temperature-inducible expression vectors encoding either the PDGF A- or B-chain or a bicistronic vector encoding both chains synthesized in a 1:1 ratio upon induction (13Schneppe B. Eichner W. McCarthy J.E.G. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 143: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Production of PDGF was carried out in a high cell density cultivation procedure that has been described previously (24Seeger A. Schneppe B. McCarthy J.E.G. Deckwer W.-D. Rinas U. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 1995; 17: 947-953Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Purification of unfolded and reduced PDGF monomers from solubilized PDGF containing inclusion bodies was done by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) under denaturing conditions (14Müller C. Rinas U. J. Chromatogr. A. 1999; 855: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Purified, unfolded, and reduced PDGF monomers (either pure A-, or B-chains, or an equimolar mixture of the two chains) were subjected to SEC under conditions that allow refolding and reshuffling of disulfide bridges as described previously (14Müller C. Rinas U. J. Chromatogr. A. 1999; 855: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Standard renaturation conditions by SEC were: 1 mol l−1 Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 0.5 mol l−1guanidinium hydrochloride (GdnHCl), 10 mmol l−1glutathione reduced (GSH), 0.25 mmol l−1 glutathione oxidized (GSSG). Under these conditions, the eluted PDGF monomers were able to dimerize in the eluate fraction to yield the dimeric, disulfide-bonded, and biologically active growth factor (14Müller C. Rinas U. J. Chromatogr. A. 1999; 855: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Aggregation of PDGF during the renaturation procedure was not observed unless otherwise indicated. The formation of disulfide-bonded dimers was followed in aliquots taken from the reaction mixture in the eluate fraction through disulfide trapping by irreversible blocking of free thiol groups and subsequent separation of monomeric and dimeric PDGF by gel electrophoresis under non-reducing conditions. Blocking of the free thiol groups by the addition of iodoacetate and gel electrophoresis was carried out as described previously (14Müller C. Rinas U. J. Chromatogr. A. 1999; 855: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and quantification of the monomeric and dimeric fraction of PDGF was carried out by densitometry (Hirschman elscript 400). The putative reaction order for the rate-limiting step during dimerization of PDGF was determined from the slopes of the linearized kinetic equations assuming either a first-order (Equation 1),ln[A]t=ln[A]0−‖Σva‖k1tEquation 1 or a second-order rate-determining reaction (Equation 2),1[A]t=1[A]0+‖Σva‖k2tEquation 2 where [A]t and [A]0 are the monomer concentrations at timest and zero, respectively, Σva is the sum of the stoichiometric factors, and k1 andk2 are the rate constants for a first- or second-order reaction, respectively. By rearranging the kinetic Equations 1 and 2, the monomer turnover U can be simulated assuming either a first-order (Equation 3) or a second-order rate-determining reaction (Equation 4).1−[A]t[A]0=U=1−e−‖Σva‖k1tEquation 3 1−[A]t[A]0=U=1−11+‖Σva‖k2[A]0tEquation 4 In case of a unimolecular rate-limiting reaction, the monomer turnover with time should be independent of the initial monomer concentration (Equation 3), while a second-order rate-limiting reaction should be reflected by an increased monomer turnover with increasing initial monomer concentration (Equation 4). Best-fit simulations of the data from kinetic experiments for the determination of the rate constants and modeling of the monomer turnover were carried out using standard software. The temperature dependence of the rate of dimerization was described by an Arrhenius relationship, i.e. a plot of lnk versus 1/T,k=AexpΔS#Rexp−ΔH#R−1TEquation 5 where k is the experimentally determined rate constant, A is a constant in the activated complex theory, ΔS# and ΔH# the entropy and enthalpy of activation of the reaction, respectively,T the temperature, and R the universal gas constant. If there is linearity for the temperature dependence of the rate constant, the enthalpy and entropy of activation can be determined from the slope and the y intercept of Equation 5, respectively. The kinetics of the formation of disulfide-bonded dimers of PDGF were investigated under redox reshuffling conditions starting from an equimolar mixture of completely unfolded and reduced A- and B-chains (Fig.2A). The kinetic data are well described either by assuming a first- or a second-order rate-determining reaction and the putative rate constants extracted from the slopes of the linearized kinetic equations (cf. experimental procedures) were determined to bek1 = 1.5 10−5 s−1 ork2 = 2.5 mol−1 l s−1, respectively (Fig. 2B). To discriminate between a first- and a second-order rate-limiting reaction controlling the formation of disulfide-bonded PDGF dimers, renaturation experiments were carried out with varying initial monomer concentrations (Fig. 3). The kinetic analysis revealed an independence of the monomer turnover at given time points on the initial monomer concentration (Fig. 3A), thus clearly excluding a second-order rate-limiting step in the renaturation of PDGF-AB. In addition, kinetic modeling revealed that the formation of the disulfide-bonded dimer is best described by a first-order rate-determining reaction (Fig. 3B). Deviation of the predicted monomer turnover from the experimental data originates from the formation of soluble off-pathway products, which are not able to form native PDGF-AB. To account for the incomplete monomer turnover, the kinetic model was further refined by including an additional step leading to the irreversible formation of misfolded off-pathway products (Fig. 4A). The experimental data are now well described by the productive first-order reaction with the rate constant of k1 = 1.5 10−5s−1 yielding the native disulfide-bonded PDGF-AB dimer and an unproductive reaction with a rate constant ofk1′ = 7.5 10−6 s−1leading to non-native off-pathway products (Fig. 4B).Figure 4Simplified model for the formation of disulfide-bonded PDGF-AB dimers from unfolded and reduced PDGF-A and -B monomers.A, simplified model for the formation of disulfide-bonded PDGF-AB dimers additionally including the formation of non-native off-pathway folding products Mmisfoldedincompetent for the formation of native disulfide-bonded PDGF-AB dimers.

In addition, the experimental time course data of the relative concentrations of PDGF-A and -B monomers (■) and disulfide-bonded dimers (▪) are shown. Experimental conditions were the same as described in the legend to Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A variation of the GdnHCl concentration between 0.25 and 1.5 mol l−1 in the renaturation buffer revealed a strong decrease in the rate of the formation of the disulfide-linked dimer with increasing concentrations of the chaotropic agent (Fig.5). The graphic representation of the rate constants in a “chevron plot” revealed a linear dependence on the GdnHCl concentration by anticipating a first-order rate-limiting step for the generation of the disulfide-linked PDGF-AB dimer (Fig.5B). Final yields of disulfide-linked PDGF-AB dimers increased from 13 to 75% by decreasing the concentration of GdnHCl from 1.5 to 0.25 mol l−1. At 2 mol l−1GdnHCl, formation of disulfide-linked dimers was not detectable (data not shown). A unimolecular rate-limiting reaction during the formation of the disulfide bonded PDGF dimer could either indicate a rate-limiting folding reaction on the level of the monomeric chain or structural rearrangements on the level of the dimeric not yet disulfide-bonded growth factor. To discriminate between these two possibilities, a kinetic study of the formation of disulfide-bonded dimers was carried out using either the purified A- or B-chains or an equimolar mixture of both chains (Fig.6). The formation of disulfide-bonded PDGF-AA or PDGF-BB homodimers displayed identical kinetics indicating that both monomeric forms as well as the dimerized homodimer have similar folding and assembly pathways. In contrast, disulfide-bonded heterodimers were formed three times more rapidly (k1 = 1.5 10−5 s−1, experimental conditions, cf. Fig. 6) compared with the formation of the two different disulfide-bonded homodimers from either pure A- or B-chains (k1 = 0.5 10−5s−1, experimental conditions, cf. Fig. 6) when renaturation was started from an equimolar mixture of both chains. At all temperatures ranging from 4 °C to 45 °C heterodimerzation occurred more rapidly compared with the formation of homodimers (Fig. 7and Table I), suggesting a general preference for the formation of the heterodimer. Also, the kinetics of homodimerization of the two different PDGF-AA or -BB isoforms did not show any significant difference in the temperature range studied, supporting the conclusion that homodimerization of either PDGF-AA or -BB follows most likely similar pathways.Table ITemperature dependence of the renaturation of the different PDGF isoformsTemperatureFirst-order rate constant,k1Final yieldPDGF-AAPDGF-BBPDGF-ABPDGF-AAPDGF-BBPDGF-AB°C10−5s−1%40.03 ± 0.0050.05 ± 0.0050.06 ± 0.015181717150.13 ± 0.0050.17 ± 0.010.5 ± 0.1254555250.5 ± 0.10.5 ± 0.051.5 ± 0.1505061351.0 ± 0.11.0 ± 0.053.0 ± 0.2505159451.0 ± 0.050.5 ± 0.052.0 ± 0.15504757Experimental conditions were the same as described in the legend to Fig. 7. Open table in a new tab Experimental conditions were the same as described in the legend to Fig. 7. During the renaturation of all the three different PDGF isoforms aggregation was not observed up to temperatures of 35 °C. However at 45 °C, partial aggregation of all PDGF isoforms occurred. A summary of the results from the renaturation experiments carried out at the different temperatures is shown in Table I. An estimation of the activation enthalpies from the Arrhenius plots (Fig. 7; only data from 4 to 35 °C) of either homo- or heterodimerization did not reveal a significant difference for the different PDGF isoforms. Assuming a first-order rate-limiting renaturation step, activation enthalpies in the range of 70–80 kJ mol−1 were estimated for the formation of PDGF-AA, -AB, or -BB. Subunit association can be a very fast process with rate constants in the order of 107 mol−1 l s−1(e.g. Ref. 25Milla M.E. Sauer R.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1125-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) that are encountered in diffusion-controlled reactions. However, when folding and association is connected with the formation of intra- and intermolecular disulfide bonds, e.g.during renaturation of antibody fragments, the regain of the biological activity can occur in the time scale of hours to days (26Buchner J. Rudolph R. Bio/Technology. 1991; 9: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). The formation of disulfide-bonded dimers of PDGF is also a very slow process occurring in the time scale of hours. Studies on the folding and association of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (18Philo J.S. Rosenfeld R. Arakawa T. Wen J. Narhi L.O. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10812-10818Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and nerve growth factor (19Rattenholl A. Ruoppolo M. Flagiello A. Monti M. Vinci F. Marino G. Lilie H. Schwarz E. Rudolph R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), growth factors where the subunits are not connected by intermolecular disulfide bonds, also revealed slow renaturation kinetics, although, in general, little information exists on the folding and association pathways of dimeric proteins of the cystine knot growth factor family. The rate-limiting step during the renaturation of a dimeric protein can either be a first-order step resulting from unimolecular conformational changes or a second-order step originating from the encounter and assembly of the subunits. The experimental results clearly show that the formation of the PDGF dimer is a process controlled by a first-order reaction, thus proving that the encounter of the monomeric chains to form the dimeric growth factor is not the rate-limiting step in the renaturation of PDGF. A first-order rate-determining reaction during the renaturation of a multimeric protein is not unusual. For example, the kinetic analysis of the renaturation of the homodimeric mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase revealed a second-order association reaction (27Jaenicke R. Rudolph R. Heider I. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 1217-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), whereas the renaturation kinetics of the cytoplasmic enzyme, also a homodimer, were governed by a first-order rate-limiting step (28Rudolph R. Fuchs I. Jaenicke R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1662-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A first-order rate-limiting reaction can result from folding events on the monomer level or from structural rearrangements of an already dimerized protein. The comparative analysis of homo- and heterodimerization revealed identical kinetics for the formation of the disulfide-bonded AA or BB homodimers, suggesting that their renaturation pathways do not differ significantly, e.g. that folding of the two different monomeric chains into association competent molecules, association of these monomers into homodimers, and, finally, formation of intermolecular disulfide bridges do not exhibit significantly different pathways when renaturation was started either from the unfolded and reduced pure A- or B-chains. In contrast, the AB heterodimers were formed three times more rapidly compared with the formation of the homodimers. Assuming a rate-determining first-order step on the level of monomer folding and observing identical homodimerization kinetics is not contradictive if both monomeric isoforms exhibit identical folding kinetics prior to the formation of the dimer. But a rate-determining first-order step on the level of monomer folding should also result in the same kinetics for homo- and heterodimerization if both monomeric isoforms exhibit identical folding kinetics. However, we observe that heterodimerization of PDGF-AB occurs three times more rapidly than homodimerization. These results clearly exclude the possibility that the rate-determining first-order step can be assigned to conformational folding steps on the level of the not yet dimerized monomer but point clearly to structural rearrangements on the level of the dimerized but not yet disulfide-bonded dimer as the pace maker of renaturation. In this case, the different monomers can fold on identical pathways as the experimental results strongly suggest; however, once dimerized but not yet disulfide-bonded, the formation of the cystine bonds between the different chains must be facilitated between the PDGF-A and -B monomer compared with disulfide-bonding between identical chains. The results also show that a statistically and diffusion controlled encounter of the different monomers must be reversible, i.e. that non-covalent monomer association and dissociation must occur prior to the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds under the conditions studied. Once connected by intermolecular disulfide bonds, however, there are no indications for subunit exchange processes (data not shown). The results from the kinetic studies on the folding and assembly of PDGF are summarized in the model depicted in Fig.8. The kinetically preferred formation of the heterodimeric growth factor should also affect the isoform distribution. Statistically an isoform distribution of 1:2:1 is expected when refolding occurs from an equimolar mixture of A- and B-chains. However, three times faster heterodimerization compared with homodimerization should result in an isoform distribution of 1:6:1, which accounts for 12.5% PDGF-AA, 75% PDGF-AB, and 12.5% PDGF-BB. A similar isoform distribution was reached when Chinese hamster ovary cells were used for coexpression of the genes encoding the PDGF-A and -B chains (19% AA, 69% AB, and 12% BB; Ref. 29Östman A. Rall L. Hammacher A. Wormstead M.A. Coit D. Valenzuela P. Betsholtz C. Westermark B. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16202-16208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The strong dependence of the kinetic constant of the rate-limiting renaturation step on the concentration of the denaturant GdnHCl strongly suggests that general structural rearrangements on the level of the non-covalently associated but not yet disulfide-bonded dimer determine the speed of renaturation. Finally, similar activation enthalpies of hetero- and homodimerization indicate that preferential heterodimerization must be controlled by entropic factors resulting in a more favorable positioning of the cysteines from different chains for the formation of the intermolecular disulfide bonds compared with disulfide bond formation between identical chains. We are grateful to F. X. Schmid for useful comments concerning the interpretation of the Arrhenius plot data."
