https://openalex.org/W2113784410,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a major cause of blindness in the elderly. We report a genome-wide screen of 96 cases and 50 controls for polymorphisms associated with AMD. Among 116,204 single-nucleotide polymorphisms genotyped, an intronic and common variant in the complement factor H gene ( CFH ) is strongly associated with AMD (nominal P value &lt;10 -7 ). In individuals homozygous for the risk allele, the likelihood of AMD is increased by a factor of 7.4 (95% confidence interval 2.9 to 19). Resequencing revealed a polymorphism in linkage disequilibrium with the risk allele representing a tyrosine-histidine change at amino acid 402. This polymorphism is in a region of CFH that binds heparin and C-reactive protein. The CFH gene is located on chromosome 1 in a region repeatedly linked to AMD in family-based studies."

Comparison of older and more recent malaria maps shows how the disease has been geographically restricted, but it remains entrenched in poor areas of the world with climates suitable for transmission. Here we provide an empirical approach to estimating the number of clinical events caused by Plasmodium falciparum worldwide, by using a combination of epidemiological, geographical and demographic data. We estimate that there were 515 (range 300-660) million episodes of clinical P. falciparum malaria in 2002. These global estimates are up to 50% higher than those reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) and 200% higher for areas outside Africa, reflecting the WHO's reliance upon passive national reporting for these countries. Without an informed understanding of the cartography of malaria risk, the global extent of clinical disease caused by P. falciparum will continue to be underestimated."
https://openalex.org/W3145351529,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common, late-onset, and complex trait with multiple risk factors. Concentrating on a region harboring a locus for AMD on 1q25-31, the ARMD1 locus, we tested single-nucleotide polymorphisms for association with AMD in two independent case-control populations. Significant association ( P = 4.95 × 10 -10 ) was identified within the regulation of complement activation locus and was centered over a tyrosine-402 → histidine-402 protein polymorphism in the gene encoding complement factor H. Possession of at least one histidine at amino acid position 402 increased the risk of AMD 2.7-fold and may account for 50% of the attributable risk of AMD."
https://openalex.org/W2117386992,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of visual impairment and blindness in the elderly whose etiology remains largely unknown. Previous studies identified chromosome 1q32 as harboring a susceptibility locus for AMD. We used single-nucleotide polymorphisms to interrogate this region and identified a strongly associated haplotype in two independent data sets. DNA resequencing of the complement factor H gene within this haplotype revealed a common coding variant, Y402H, that significantly increases the risk for AMD with odds ratios between 2.45 and 5.57. This common variant likely explains ∼43% of AMD in older adults."

https://openalex.org/W2042723520,"Standard quantum computation is based on sequences of unitary quantum logic gates that process qubits. The one-way quantum computer proposed by Raussendorf and Briegel is entirely different. It has changed our understanding of the requirements for quantum computation and more generally how we think about quantum physics. This new model requires qubits to be initialized in a highly entangled cluster state. From this point, the quantum computation proceeds by a sequence of single-qubit measurements with classical feedforward of their outcomes. Because of the essential role of measurement, a one-way quantum computer is irreversible. In the one-way quantum computer, the order and choices of measurements determine the algorithm computed. We have experimentally realized four-qubit cluster states encoded into the polarization state of four photons. We characterize the quantum state fully by implementing experimental four-qubit quantum state tomography. Using this cluster state, we demonstrate the feasibility of one-way quantum computing through a universal set of one- and two-qubit operations. Finally, our implementation of Grover's search algorithm demonstrates that one-way quantum computation is ideally suited for such tasks. A new approach to quantum computing was launched by Robert Raussendorf and Hans Briegel in 2001. Until then most experiments had involved a sequence of interactions between single particles (qubits) in a sequential network of quantum logic gates. Raussendorf and Briegel envisaged computing based on a particular class of entangled states, the cluster states. In this method, a quantum computer is initialized in a cluster state, then computation proceeds by single-particle measurements on individual qubits in the cluster. The measurements imprint a quantum logic circuit on the state, which destroys its entanglement and makes the process irreversible. Hence the name ‘one-way quantum computing’ for the system. Walther et al. now report a significant experimental advance: the first realizations of cluster states and cluster state quantum computation. The cluster is created in the polarization state of four photons and computing proceeds via a set of one- and two-qubit operations."
https://openalex.org/W2028919524,"The transition of cells from an epithelial to a mesenchymal phenotype is a critical event during morphogenesis in multicellular organisms and underlies the pathology of many diseases, including the invasive phenotype associated with metastatic carcinomas. Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) is a key regulator of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, the molecular mechanisms that control the dissolution of tight junctions, an early event in EMT, remain elusive. We demonstrate that Par6, a regulator of epithelial cell polarity and tight-junction assembly, interacts with TGFβ receptors and is a substrate of the type II receptor, TβRII. Phosphorylation of Par6 is required for TGFβ-dependent EMT in mammary gland epithelial cells and controls the interaction of Par6 with the E3 ubiquitin ligase Smurf1. Smurf1, in turn, targets the guanosine triphosphatase RhoA for degradation, thereby leading to a loss of tight junctions. These studies define how an extracellular cue signals to the polarity machinery to control epithelial cell morphology."

These are well characterized sites of methylation within histones, but there are numerous other, less characterized, sites of modification. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, methylation of K36/H3 has been linked to active genes, but little is known about this methylation in higher eukaryotes. Here we analyzed for the first time the levels and spatial distribution of di- and tri-methyl (di- and tri-Me) K36/H3 in metazoan genes. We analyzed chicken genes that are developmentally regulated, constitutively active, or inactive. We found that active genes contain high levels of these modifications compared with inactive genes. Furthermore, in actively transcribed regions the levels of di- and tri-Me K36/H3 peak toward the 3′ end of the gene. This is in striking contrast to the distributions of di- and tri-Me K4/H3, which peak early in actively transcribed regions. Thus, di/tri-Me K4/H3 and di/tri-Me K36/H3 are both useful markers of active genes, but their genic distribution indicates differing roles. Our data suggest that the unique spatial distribution of di- and tri-Me K36/H3 plays a role in transcriptional termination and/or early RNA processing.

Our data suggest that the unique spatial distribution of di- and tri-Me K36/H3 plays a role in transcriptional termination and/or early RNA processing. Histone N-terminal tails are subject to a variety of post-translational covalent modifications. These include acetylation, phosphorylation, and methylation, all of which have the potential to alter chromatin architecture and thereby to affect all aspects of DNA processing (1Fischle W. Wang Y. Allis C.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 2: 172-183Crossref Scopus (989) Google Scholar, 2Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2002; 403: 41-45Crossref Scopus (6679) Google Scholar, 3Turner B.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Over the last few years it has become increasingly clear that deregulation of the enzymes performing these modifications can be linked to various human pathologies including cancer (4Hake S.B. Xiao A. Allis C.D. Br. J. Cancer. 2004; 90: 761-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 5Schneider R. Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 396-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). For instance, mutations in histone acetyltransferases have been linked to cancer, and histone deacetylase inhibitors are now in the clinician's armory as anti-cancer chemotherapeutic agents (4Hake S.B. Xiao A. Allis C.D. Br. J. Cancer. 2004; 90: 761-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Histone kinases, such as the aurora kinases, have also been linked to oncogenesis (4Hake S.B. Xiao A. Allis C.D. Br. J. Cancer. 2004; 90: 761-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). More recently evidence has begun to emerge implicating histone methyltransferases in developmental disorders as well as in cancer (6Rayasam G.V. Wendling O. Angrand P.O. Mark M. Niederreither K. Song L. Lerouge T. Hager G.L. Chambon P. Losson R. EMBO J. 2003; 16: 3153-3163Crossref Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In vivo histone lysines may be mono-, di-, or tri-methylated, but little is known concerning the functional interplay between these different levels of methylation. In metazoa the levels of the di- and tri-methyl forms of lysine 4 of histone H3 (K4/H3) have been shown to peak in the 5′ transcribed region of active genes, implicating both in the early phases of transcriptional elongation (7Schneider R. Bannister A.J. Myers F.A. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. Kouzarides T. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2004; 6: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Consistent with this the yeast Set1p enzyme that is responsible for methylating K4/H3 is found associated with the initiation-elongation phosphorylated form of RNA pol II, 1The abbreviations used are: pol II, polymerase II; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation. RNAPII-5P (8Ng H.H. Robert F. Young R.A. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 709-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). Another H3 modification, di-methyl K36/H3, also has been found in the transcribed region of active genes in yeast (9Xiao T. Hall H. Kizer K.O. Shibata Y. Hall M.C. Borchers C.H. Strahl B.D. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 10Krogan N.J. Kim M. Tong A. Golshani A. Cagney G. Canadien V. Richards D.P Beattie B.K. Emili A. Boone C. Shilatifard A. Buratowski S. Greenblatt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4207-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). In this case, the Set2p enzyme that methylates K36/H3 associates with the elongation-termination form of RNA pol II, RNAPII-2P (9Xiao T. Hall H. Kizer K.O. Shibata Y. Hall M.C. Borchers C.H.

Recently, the mammalian NSD1 protein has been shown to possess K36/H3 methyltransferase activity (6Rayasam G.V. Wendling O. Angrand P.O. Mark M. Niederreither K. Song L. Lerouge T. Hager G.L. Chambon P. Losson R. EMBO J. 2003; 16: 3153-3163Crossref Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Haploinsufficiency of the NSD1 gene leads to Sotos syndrome, which is a neurological disorder characterized by overgrowth in childhood, advanced bone age, craniofacial abnormalities, mental retardation, and possibly a susceptibility to cancer (11Visser R. Matsumoto N. Curr. Opin. Pediatr. 2003; 15: 598-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 12De Boer L. Duyvenvoorde H.A. Willemstein-Van Hove E.C. Hoogerbrugge C.M. Van Doorn J. Maassen J.A. Karperien M. Wit J.M. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 2004; 151: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In addition, translocation of the NSD1 gene leads to the development of certain leukemias (13Al-Mulla N. Belgaumi A.F. Teebi A. J. Pediatr. Hematol. Oncol. 2004; 26: 204-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Taken together, these facts suggest that deregulation of K36/H3 methylation and the resulting effect on transcription may be crucial events in cellular transformation. Mapping studies have analyzed the spatial distribution of di-methyl K36/H3 in active yeast genes and have found that this modification is generally enriched in transcribed regions, but no definitive trend within transcribed regions has been observed (9Xiao T. Hall H. Kizer K.O. Shibata Y. Hall M.C. Borchers C.H. Strahl B.D. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 10Krogan N.J. Kim M. Tong A. Golshani A. Cagney G.

Furthermore, recent experiments performed in mammalian cells have mapped di-Me K36/H3 to active genes but not inactive genes (14Zhou M. Deng L. Lacoste V. Park H.U. Pumfery A. Kashanchi F. Brady J.N. Kumar A. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 13522-13533Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, to date nothing is known concerning the role of tri-Me K36/H3. Here, we describe the characterization of anti tri-Me K36/H3 antisera and use the antibody to map tri-Me K36/H3 to active metazoan genes. Analysis of the spatial distribution of di- and tri-Me K36/H3 within active genes indicates that the levels of these modifications increase toward the 3′ end of actively transcribing genes. Antibodies—Di-methyl K36/H3-specific antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Tri-methyl K36/H3-specific antibodies are now available from Abcam Ltd. Nucleosome Preparation and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation— Chicken mononucleosomes were prepared and chromatin immunoprecipitations (ChIPs) performed essentially as described previously (20Hebbes T.R. Clayton A.L. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1823-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 21Myers F.A. Evans D.R. Clayton A.L. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20197-20205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Typically, 150 μg of sucrose gradient-purified input mononucleosomes (as DNA) were dialyzed into the immunoprecipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.02% SDS, 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 0.9% Triton X-100) and immunoprecipitated at 4 °C with 10 μg of affinity-purified antibodies in the presence of protein A/G beads (Amersham Biosciences). The beads were then washed five times with immunoprecipitation buffer and twice with wash buffer (350 mm NaCl, 0.02% SDS, 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 0.9% Triton X-100). The histones and DNA from the input, unbound (supernatant), and bound fractions were recovered as described (20Hebbes T.R. Clayton A.L. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1823-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Quantitative Real-time PCR—Using an ABI 7000 real-time PCR system and the TaqMan PCR Master Mix protocol (Applied Biosystems), differences in the DNA content of the bound and input fractions were determined. Bound to input (B/I) ratios were determined for each amplicon by taking a fixed aliquot of the DNA extracted from the input and bound nucleosomal samples. These were amplified together with a defined amount of genomic DNA on the same plate, using the latter to construct the standard curve. B/I values for any one amplicon are thus in the correct quantitative ratio to B/I values for other amplicons measured for the same ChIP, because this procedure compensates for differences in the PCR efficiencies of different probe/primer combinations and for nucleosome representation. However, B/I values derived using different ChIPs cannot be quantitatively compared because of variations in the efficiency of individual immunoprecipitations. All data within each graphical representation are derived from a single representative ChIP experiment; repeat ChIPs were found to give the same relative spatial distributions of B/I values across all amplicons. PCR reactions were carried out in triplicate using fixed amounts of template DNA from each fraction: 50 °C for 2 min and 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C. The threshold (CT) was set such that the fluorescence signal was above the base-line noise but as low as possible in the exponential amplification phase. For each amplicon a standard curve was determined by plotting the number of cycles at which the fluorescence crossed the threshold (crossing values) against increasing amounts of genomic DNA template. Based on this standard curve, the DNA sequence content of the input and bound fractions was determined. All primers and TaqMan probes were designed using ABI Primer Express software. The PCR products were substantially shorter than 200 bp, the length of DNA in a nucleosome. Primer and TaqMan sequences are available on request. To better evaluate the role of methylation of K36/H3 in transcription in metazoans, we asked whether the tri-methylation of K36/H3 is more tightly associated with gene activity or inactivity and determined the spatial distribution of this modification within several genes. To this end we performed ChIPs with anti tri-Me K36/H3 antibodies and mapped the presence of this modification in the promoter and transcribed region of developmentally regulated, constitutively active and inactive chicken genes. Input chromatin was in the form of mononucleosomes purified from the nuclei of 15-day chicken embryo erythrocytes; the DNA sequence content of the antibody-bound nucleosomes was analyzed by real-time PCR with short amplicons. The resulting mapping is thus at the mononucleosome level. The experimental methods used were exactly as described for our previous determination of the distribution of di- and tri-Me K4/H3 (7Schneider R. Bannister A.J. Myers F.A. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. Kouzarides T. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2004; 6: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). First, the specificity of the antibody against tri-Me K36/H3 was verified. This was done by using the antibodies in Western blots of various histone preparations (Fig. 1). We prepared total cellular extracts from three strains of Schizosaccharomyces pombe: wild type; a set1 knock-out lacking the Set1p K4/H3 methyltransferase; and a set2 knock-out, which lacks the Set2p K36/H3 methyltransferase. The antibody specifically recognizes a band corresponding to histone H3 in the wild type strain. Importantly, this recognition is maintained in the set1 knock-out strain but is lost in the set2 knock-out strain (Fig. 1A). This confirms the specificity of the antibodies for Me K36/H3. Furthermore, recognition of the H3 epitope is specifically blocked by an H3 peptide containing tri-Me Lys-36 but not by peptides bearing mono-Me or di-Me Lys-36, nor is it affected by peptides containing tri-Me lysine at positions other than Lys-36 (Fig. 1B and data not shown). We conclude that the antibody is specific for the tri-methylated form of K36/H3. To map the distribution of tri-Me K36/H3 by native ChIP, the promoters and transcribed regions of the four genes in the chicken β-globin locus were the first target to be analyzed (15Felsenfeld G. Gene. 1993; 135: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These genes were chosen because they are a highly characterized model gene system that includes both active and inactive genes. In 15-day chicken embryo erythrocytes the adult and hatching genes (βA, βH) are active, whereas the embryonic rho and epsilon genes (βρ, βϵ) are inactive (Fig. 2a). Although there is little detectable tri-Me K36/H3 either in the 16 kb of heterochromatin that lies upstream of the locus (Fig. 2b, bar 1) or in the promoters or transcribed regions of the inactive βρ and βϵ genes (Fig. 2b, bars 2, 3, 8, and 9), at the promoters (bars 4 and 6) and in particular within the transcribed regions of the active βA and βH genes (bars 5 and 7) the levels are substantial. These data imply that tri-Me K36/H3 is enriched mostly in the transcribed region of active genes. This hypothesis was tested by analyzing the upstream (5′) transcribed regions of a number of constitutively active and tissue-specific genes and comparing enrichments of tri-Me K36/H3 to those found in similar regions of inactive genes. Fig. 2c clearly shows that tri-Me K36/H3 is enriched at active genes, whereas at several tissue-specific genes not expressed in erythrocytes, very low but not zero levels of tri-Me K36/H3 are present in their transcribed regions. It is striking that there appears to be significantly more tri-Me K36/H3 in the transcribed region of the βA gene when compared with the level at the other active globin gene, βH (Fig. 2b). This might have two explanations: (i) more tri-Me K36/H3 is found associated with the βA gene because it is the most active gene in the β-globin locus in 15-day embryos; or (ii) because the amplicon analyzed in the βA gene is near the 3′ end of the transcribed region but that analyzed for the βH gene is more toward the 5′ end of its transcribed region, the distribution of tri-Me K36/H3 might increase toward the 3′-ends of transcribed regions. If the latter assumption is correct and it is a general phenomenon, then the levels of tri-Me K36/H3 at other active genes should increase toward the 3′ ends of their transcribed regions. Analysis of a further four active genes, vimentin, DNAPKcs, L30, and MHCII demonstrated that this was indeed the case (Fig. 3). Each of the four genes displayed significantly increased levels of tri-Me K36/H3 toward the 3′ ends of their transcribed regions. Previously we have shown that di- and tri-Me K4/H3 are also markers of active transcription but that they peak in the early (5′) transcribed regions of active genes (7Schneider R. Bannister A.J. Myers F.A. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. Kouzarides T. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2004; 6: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). From the data presented here, tri-Me K36/H3 may also be regarded as a marker of active transcription, but its distribution appears to be different from that of methylated K4/H3. To determine more precisely the spatial distribution of tri-Me K36/H3 at active genes, two active genes were analyzed in more detail: carbonic anhydrase (CA, tissue-specific, 17 kb) and GAPDH (housekeeping gene, 4 kb) (see Fig. 4). For comparison, the distribution of tri-Me K4/H3 is displayed together with that of tri-Me K36/H3. Across both the CA and GAPDH genes there is a clear enrichment of tri-Me K36/H3 toward the 3′ ends of their transcribed regions, in sharp contrast to tri-Me K4/H3, which is confined to the most 5′ transcribed regions, as reported previously (7Schneider R. Bannister A.J. Myers F.A. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. Kouzarides T. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2004; 6: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). We also determined the spatial distribution of di-Me K36/H3 across the CA and GAPDH genes and found a strikingly similar distribution to that of tri-Me K36/H3 (Fig. 4). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae di-Me K36/H3 has been implicated in both the activation and repression of genes, although the mechanism(s) involved are far from clear (9Xiao T. Hall H. Kizer K.O.

The yeast Set2p enzyme methylates K36/H3 and associates with RNA polymerase II (RNA pol II), which is phosphorylated at Ser-2 within its C-terminal domain repeats (9Xiao T. Hall H. Kizer K.O. Shibata Y. Hall M.C. Borchers C.H. Strahl B.D. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 10Krogan N.J. Kim M. Tong A. Golshani A. Cagney G. Canadien V.

Ser-2 phosphorylated RNA pol II (RNAPII-2P) is the transcriptionally active elongating form that transcribes the DNA into RNA. The observation that this form of RNA pol II binds Set2p implicates Set2p, and hence methyl K36/H3, in the process of transcriptional elongation. This correlates with the observation that methylated K36/H3 is present within active genes; but why do di- and tri-Me K36/H3 levels increase in a 5′-3′ direction toward the ends of transcribed regions? The increase could be due to extra methyltransferase loading as the elongating RNA pol II molecules travel further or because the enzymatic activity of the histone methyltransferase increases toward the 3′ end of genes. The above data clearly show that in metazoans di- and tri-Me K36/H3 is associated with the process of active transcription, but what process could require Me K36/H3? We previously reported that di- and tri-Me K4/H3 levels peak in the early transcribed region of the active genes analyzed here (7Schneider R. Bannister A.J. Myers F.A. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. Kouzarides T. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2004; 6: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). This led us to suggest that methyl K4/H3 has an important role in the early phase of transcriptional elongation. In contrast, in the present study we find that di- and tri-Me K36/H3 peak toward the 3′ end of actively transcribing regions, implying that methyl K36/H3 has a different role than that of di- and tri-Me K4/H3. Furthermore, we detect no significant differences between the spatial distributions of di- and tri-Me K36/H3, suggesting that these modifications may have very similar or overlapping functions. Me K36/H3 modification levels reach a maximum right at the end of the 4-kb GAPDH gene but ∼15 nucleosomes before the end of the four times longer CA gene, so the peak might occur at an approximately fixed distance from the start of transcription. However, the DNAPKcs gene is ∼85 kb long, and the 3′ amplicon monitored (Fig. 3) is in the last of 86 exons; so the peak of tri-Me K36/H3 is clearly located close to the end of the transcribed region, whatever its length, and might therefore be directly involved in transcription termination or have a role in transcriptionally linked early mRNA processing. Consistent with the second possibility, the transcribing RNA polymerase (to which Set2p binds) has been shown to be involved in the early phase of RNA processing (18Bird G. Zorio D.A. Bentley D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8963-8969Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the yeast Set2 protein contains a WW motif, a motif recently shown to be essential in proteins involved in pre-mRNA splicing, which is a process that occurs in vivo in concert with transcription (19Lin K-T. Lu R.-M. Tarn W.-Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9176-9185Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Whatever the detailed explanations, the mapping studies reported here suggest that methylated K4/H3 and methylated K36/H3 have distinct roles at active genes."

To test this conclusion further, we created transgenic mice expressing a fusion mutant protein of β-catenin and LEF (CA-LEF) in nascent chondrocytes. Transgenic mice had severe skeletal defects, particularly in limbs. Growth plates were totally disorganized, lacked maturing chondrocytes expressing Indian hedgehog and collagen X, and failed to undergo endochondral ossification. Interestingly, the transgenic cartilaginous elements were ill defined, intermingled with surrounding connective and vascular tissues, and even displayed abnormal joints. However, when activated β-catenin mutant (Δ-β-catenin) was expressed in chondrocytes already engaged in maturation such as those present in chick limbs, chondrocyte maturation and bone formation were greatly enhanced. Differential responses to Wnt/β-catenin signaling were confirmed in cultured chondrocytes. Activation in immature cells blocked maturation and actually de-stabilized their phenotype, as revealed by reduced expression of chondrocyte markers, abnormal cytoarchitecture, and loss of proteoglycan matrix. Activation in mature cells instead stimulated hypertrophy, matrix mineralization, and expression of terminal markers such as metalloprotease (MMP)-13 and vascular endothelial growth factor. Because proteoglycans are crucial for cartilage function, we tested possible mechanisms for matrix loss. Δ-β-Catenin expression markedly increased expression of MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-7, MMP-9, MT3-MMP, and ADAMTS5. In conclusion, Wnt/β-catenin signaling regulates chondrocyte phenotype, maturation, and function in a developmentally regulated manner, and regulated action by this pathway is critical for growth plate organization, cartilage boundary definition, and endochondral ossification.

Skeletogenesis continues to attract much research interest because of its fundamental roles in embryonic development and growth and its susceptibility to pathologies. The process initiates with formation of mesenchymal or ectomesenchymal cell condensations at specific sites and times in the early embryo. As exemplified by the limb, the mesenchymal condensations then undergo chondrogenesis and give rise to cartilaginous long bone anlagen (1Horton W.A. Royce P.M. Steinmann B. Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1993: 73-84Google Scholar, 2Karsenty G. Nature. 2003; 423: 316-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The chondrocytes become organized in growth plates, proliferate, and mature into pre-hypertrophic and hypertrophic chondrocytes. Pre-hypertrophic chondrocytes express genes such as Indian hedgehog, and hypertrophic chondrocytes express a number of characteristic genes, including collagen X, alkaline phosphatase, osteopontin, and metalloprotease (MMP) 1The abbreviations used are: MMP, metalloprotease; IHH, Indian hedgehog; HA, hemagglutinin; RT, reverse transcriptase; CA-LEF, constitutive active form of mouse LEF-1.1The abbreviations used are: MMP, metalloprotease; IHH, Indian hedgehog; HA, hemagglutinin; RT, reverse transcriptase; CA-LEF, constitutive active form of mouse LEF-1.-13. Eventually, the hypertrophic chondrocytes mineralize their matrix by deposition of apatitic crystals and are replaced by marrow, vascular, and bone cells via an endochondral ossification process. Whereas these stepwise endochondral events proceed, diarthrodial synovial joints form at each epiphyseal end. Joint formation begins with appearance of a mesenchymal interzone that comes to separate adjacent cartilaginous anlagen (3Pacifici M. Koyama E. Iwamoto M. Gentili C. Connect. Tissue Res. 2000; 41: 17-784Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Although the above principles and general mechanisms are clear and well established, much remains to be understood about skeletogenesis, particularly at the molecular signaling level.Wnt proteins are powerful secreted signaling factors that regulate a number of developmental processes (4Nusse R. Varmus H.E. Cell. 1992; 69: 1073-1087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar, 5Huelsken J. Birchmeier W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). The vertebrate Wnt family currently comprises 20 members. Wnt proteins act by binding to Frizzled and low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein cell surface receptors (4Nusse R. Varmus H.E. Cell. 1992; 69: 1073-1087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar, 5Huelsken J. Birchmeier W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Upon Wnt binding, Frizzled receptors transduce signals via the β-catenin-LEF/TCF pathway (5Huelsken J. Birchmeier W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 6Eastman Q. Grosschedl R. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1999; 11: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar), Ca2+-calmodulin-PKC pathway (7Miller J.R. Hocking A.M. Brown J.D. Moon R.T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7860-7872Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar), or JNK-dependent pathway (8Veeman M.T. Axelrod J.D. Moon R.T. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 367-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar). The β-catenin-LEF/TCF pathway is the best characterized to date and is conserved from Drosophila to humans (5Huelsken J. Birchmeier W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 6Eastman Q. Grosschedl R. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1999; 11: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). In the absence of Wnt binding to Frizzled receptors, β-catenin is found to form complexes with cytoplasmic proteins such as glycogen synthase kinase 3β, Axin, and adenomatous polyposis coli, and remains phosphorylated (9Nakamura T. Hamada F. Ishidate T. Anai K. Kawahara K. Toyoshima K. Akiyama T. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 10Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Ikeda S. Kishida M. Sakamoto I. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10823-10826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated cytoplasmic β-catenin molecules become ubiquitynated and are directed for proteasome-assisted degradation (11Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2135) Google Scholar). On the other hand, when Wnt proteins bind to the receptors, degradation is inactivated and a “free” form of β-catenin accumulates in the cytoplasm (9Nakamura T. Hamada F. Ishidate T. Anai K. Kawahara K. Toyoshima K. Akiyama T. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 10Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Ikeda S. Kishida M. Sakamoto I. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. J. Biol.

Dev. 1998; 8: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Accumulated β-catenin molecules translocate to the nucleus and serve as a co-activator of resident LEF/TCF transcriptional factors, resulting in complexes that bind to response sequences and modulate expression of target genes (6Eastman Q. Grosschedl R. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1999; 11: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 12Willert K. Nusse R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar).Wnt proteins are involved in skeletogenesis. Seminal observations by Dealy and co-workers (13Dealy C.N. Roth A. Ferrari D. Brown A.M. Kosher R.A. Mech. Dev. 1993; 43: 175-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) first showed that Wnt-7a is expressed by early limb bud ectoderm and influences skeletal patterning along the dorsal-ventral axis. Wnt-3a was found to share similar expression patterns and possibly similar roles (14Kengaku M. Capdevila J. Rodriguez-Esteban C. De La Pena J. Johnson R.L. Belmonte J.C. Tabin C.J. Science. 1998; 280: 1274-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies indicated that Wnt-1, -4, and -7a exert inhibitory influences on differentiation of mesenchymal cells into chondrocytes, whereas Wnt-5a and -5b stimulate it (15Rudnicki J.A. Brown A.M. Dev. Biol. 1997; 185: 104-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 16Church V. Nohno T. Linker C. Marcelle C. Francis-West P. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4809-4818Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Wnt-5a and Wnt-5b were also shown to have strong influences on skeletogenesis in chick and mouse embryos (17Yang Y. Topol L. Lee H. Wu J. Development. 2003; 130: 1003-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 18Hartmann C. Tabin C.J.

Growth Differ. 1999; 41: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Of particular relevance to the present study are two recent reports on Wnt/β-catenin roles in skeletogenesis using transgenic approaches (20Akiyama H. Lyons J.P. Mori-Akiyama Y. Yang X. Zhang R. Zhang Z. Deng J.M. Taketo M.M. Nakamura T. Behringer R.R. McCrea P.D. de Crombrugghe B. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1072-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 21Guo X. Day T.F. Jiang X. Garrett-Beal L. Topol L. Yang Y. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2404-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Akiyama et al. (20Akiyama H. Lyons J.P. Mori-Akiyama Y. Yang X. Zhang R. Zhang Z. Deng J.M. Taketo M.M. Nakamura T. Behringer R.R. McCrea P.D. de Crombrugghe B. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1072-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar) found that continuous expression of an activated β-catenin form (Δ-β-catenin) in nascent chondrocytes using collagen II promoter sequences blocks further chondrocyte development and also ossification, as indicated by low expression of chondrocyte master regulator Sox9 and bone regulator Runx2. A detailed analysis of the chondrocyte phenotype and maturation program was, however, not performed. Guo et al. (21Guo X. Day T.F. Jiang X. Garrett-Beal L. Topol L. Yang Y. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2404-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) used a similar approach and found severe defects in long bone joint formation also. On the other hand, previous studies from our groups indicated that when Wnt/β-catenin signaling is experimentally activated at later stages and specifically in chondrocytes already undergoing and advancing toward maturation, activation resulted in a marked stimulation of hypertrophy (22Enomoto-Iwamoto M. Kitagaki J. Koyama E. Tamamura Y. Wu C. Kanatani N. Koike T. Okada H. Komori T. Yoneda T. Church V. Francis-West P.H. Kurisu K. Nohno T. Pacifici M. Iwamoto M. Dev. Biol. 2002; 251: 142-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 23Kitagaki J. Iwamoto M. Liu J.G. Tamamura Y. Pacifici M. Enomoto-Iwamoto M. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2003; 11: 36-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Together, the above studies lead to the intriguing and important notion that Wnt/β-catenin signals may not have a single role in skeletogenesis, but their interventions in the regulation of this complex multistep process may be multiple and developmentally prescribed. The present study was carried out to test these hypotheses more directly using transgenic approaches in mice and gain-of-function studies in chick embryo limbs and chick chondrocytes in culture. The results provide support for our hypotheses and reveal also that the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway has critical roles in maintenance of cartilage tissue integrity and formation of proper tissue boundaries.MATERIALS AND METHODSGeneration of Transgenic Mice—DNA fragments encoding a constitutive active form of mouse LEF-1 (CA-LEF) that includes amino acids 695–781 of β-catenin fused to the COOH terminus of murine LEF-DNA (24Vleminckx K. Kemler R. Hecht A. Mech. Dev. 1999; 81: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), were cloned into the NotI site of a collagen 2 α1 (Col2α1)-based expression vector (25Ueta C. Iwamoto M. Kanatani N. Yoshida C. Liu Y. Enomoto-Iwamoto M. Ohmori T. Enomoto H. Nakata K. Takada K. Kurisu K. Komori T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 87-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Synthetic NarI site was introduced into a HindIII site of the above vector. The resulting vector contains the CA-LEF expression unit including the 5′-NarI site-Col2α1 promoter (nucleotide 1940–2971 of M65161), β-globin intron cassette, CA-LEF, SV40 poly(A), Col2α1 enhancer (4930–5571 of M65161), NarI site-3′ in pNASSβ backbone (Clontech). CA-LEF was tagged with HA antigen at the COOH-terminal site to monitor transgene expression. The expression unit of CA-LEF was excised by NarI digestion, purified, and injected into pronuclei of fertilized eggs from F1 hybrid mice (C57BL/6 X C3H). Transgenic embryos were identified by PCR using two pairs of primers: 5′-TGCAGCTTTATCCAGGCTGGTCAG-3′ and 5′-CACCCATCTCATGCTCCATCATCATAGG-3′, which amplify the 345-bp fragment of CA-LEF; 5′-TGGTCATCATCCTGCCTTTCTC-3′ and 5′-ATTAGGTCACTGTCCGTGTGGG-3′, which amplify the 256-bp fragment of part of the β-globin intron and the LEF-1 DNA binding domain. Genomic DNA was prepared from liver tissue. Expression of the transgene at the protein level was analyzed by immunostaining for HA antigens. Seventy-two of 377 embryos carried CA-LEF transgene and 11 embryos expressed the transgene products.Skeletal, Histological, and Immunohistochemical Examinations— For anatomical examination, whole skeletons of E18.5 embryos were stained with alizarin red S and Alcian blue as described (25Ueta C. Iwamoto M. Kanatani N. Yoshida C. Liu Y. Enomoto-Iwamoto M. Ohmori T. Enomoto H. Nakata K. Takada K. Kurisu K. Komori T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 87-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). For light microscopy, tissues from E18.5 embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1 m phosphate buffer, and the resulting paraffin sections (6 μm in thickness) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). For immunohistochemistry, sections were de-masked by treatment with 0.2% pepsin in 0.02 n HCl for 15 min at 37 °C, and were incubated with rabbit anti-mouse tenascin-C antibody (26Kalembey I. Yoshida T. Iriyama K. Sakakura T. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1997; 41: 569-573PubMed Google Scholar) or anti-MMP-2 antibody (Chemicon International Inc., Temecula, CA) for 16 h at 4 °C. After rinsing, sections were incubated with biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) and then with Cy3-conjugated streptavidin (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA); each incubation was for 30 min at room temperature.In Situ Hybridization—Tissue sections using in situ hybridization was carried out with digoxigenin-conjugated or 35S-labled riboprobes (25Ueta C. Iwamoto M. Kanatani N. Yoshida C. Liu Y. Enomoto-Iwamoto M. Ohmori T. Enomoto H. Nakata K. Takada K. Kurisu K. Komori T. J.

Chick CD44 (438–915 of NM_204980) and Gli3 (688–1131 of AF0022818) were amplified from E8 chick wing bud cDNA by RT-PCR and subcloned into pGEM-T vector.Cell Cultures and Viral Infection—Chondrocytes isolated from the caudal (for immature cells) and cephalic (for mature cells) portions of day 17 chick embryo sterna (SPAFAS, c/o) were cultured in high-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (28Pacifici M. Golden E.B. Adams S.L. Shapiro I.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 192: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The cells were infected with concentrated RCAS virus encoding the active form of Δ-β-catenin that lacks the amino-terminal domain (β-catenin) (14Kengaku M. Capdevila J. Rodriguez-Esteban C. De La Pena J. Johnson R.L. Belmonte J.C. Tabin C.J. Science. 1998; 280: 1274-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar) or chick Wnt-14 (29Hartmann C. Tabin C.J.

Tabin, Harvard University) and subcultured at the density of about 1.0–1.5 × 104/cm2 by trypsinization after 1 week, and maintained in complete medium containing 10 μg/ml of ascorbic acid. By passage one, more than 85% of the cells were routinely infected as revealed by immunocytochemistry of viral antigens (30Enomoto-Iwamoto M. Iwamoto M. Mukudai Y. Kawakami Y. Nohno T. Higuchi Y. Takemoto S. Ohuchi H. Noji S. Kurisu K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 409-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar); expression of introduced genes was confirmed by Western blot. For matrix mineralization, cultures were provided with 1 mm β-glycerophosphate (31Iwamoto M. Shapiro I.M. Yagami K. Boskey A.L. Leboy P.S. Adams S.L. Pacifici M. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 207: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Proteoglycan accumulation and matrix mineralization in the cell layer were visualized by histochemistry (30Enomoto-Iwamoto M. Iwamoto M. Mukudai Y. Kawakami Y. Nohno T. Higuchi Y. Takemoto S. Ohuchi H. Noji S. Kurisu K. J.

Kemler R. Hecht A. Mech. Dev. 1999; 81: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Transfections were carried out with TransIT-LT1 transfection reagent (Mirus Bio Corp., Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activity was measured 2 days after transfection by standard methods.RNA Isolation and RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated by the guanidine isothiocyanate method (31Iwamoto M. Shapiro I.M. Yagami K. Boskey A.L. Leboy P.S. Adams S.L. Pacifici M. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 207: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). First strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA with 1 μm of random 9-mer primer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using SuperScript II™ reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) at 42 °C for 45 min. Subsequent amplification was performed with Premix Taq (TaKaRa EX Taq version, Takara Mirus Bio Inc., Madison, WI) for 25–35 cycles under the following conditions: 94 °C for 30 s, 58–60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. Primer sequences for RT-PCR amplification are follows: 5′-TTCTGCTCACTTGGATCCACTG-3′ and 5′-CGATCTCCATCGTGACGTTGTA-3′ for 13–324 of vascular endothelial growth factor (AB011078), 5′-GCAACAGAAACGAGGAGCAAAGCAT-3′ and 5′-CAGGGGAAGAAGTAGGTTCACCG TC-3′ for 438–915 of CD44 (NM_204980), 5′-AGCGGATGCTCAAGGGGTTCTATG-3′ and 5′-GGTGCAGATGGCACATTTGATGAG-3′ for 1814–2409 of chordin (NM_204980), 5′-TGTCTATCTCCCGCTGTCTGATGC-3′ and 5′-CGACTTCGGTCTTGACTTTGGTGCG-3′ for 688–1131 of Gli3 (AF0022818), 5′-TCCTTTGCTTCTGGATTTCACGGTG-3′ and 5′-CTCTGGTCTTTCTGTGGGTGCCATT-3′ for 523–960 of MMP3 (XM_417175), 5′-TGCAACAGCCCAGATGTGGAATCC-3′ and 5′-CCTCGCCTATCATCCCAATGAAGTG-3′ for 295–805 of MMP7 (Ensemble data base ID: ENSGALT00000027770), 5′-GCCCTATGAAGACATCCGCCAGAA-3′ and 5′-TGGAAGTTCTCCGTGTCCATCCACT-3′ for 84–407 of MT2-MMP (ENSGALT 00000001489), 5′-TCACTCCCCTCACCTTCACCCAGAT-3′ and 5′-ACCCATCGCTGTTGCCACCATTG-3′ for 452–856 of MMP9 (AF222690), 5′-GCCTTGTGCCTCCTTGTCTTGGTT-3′ and 5′-AAAGTTCCACCGTGAGTTGTTGCGT-3′ for 1837–2365 of cMT3-MMP (NM_205197), 5′-GGAGGCGTTCAGTTTGCTTATCGTC-3′ and 5′-TCCACCACACACCCCACATTTATCATA-3′ for 832–1257 of ADAMTS5 (ENSGALT00000025470). The resulting products were sequenced to confirm specific amplification of the target transcripts. All other PCR primers were described previously (22Enomoto-Iwamoto M. Kitagaki J. Koyama E.

Iwamoto M. Kanatani N. Yoshida C. Liu Y. Enomoto-Iwamoto M. Ohmori T. Enomoto H. Nakata K. Takada K. Kurisu K. Komori T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 87-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). CA-LEF is a fusion protein consisting of the DNA binding site of mouse LEF-1 and the transactivation domain of β-catenin, and has activity in chondrocytes similar to Δ-β-catenin used in previous studies (24Vleminckx K. Kemler R. Hecht A. Mech. Dev. 1999; 81: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).Transgenic mice expressing CA-LEF died at birth of respiratory failure and displayed severe dwarfism with shortened limbs and a flattened skull (Fig. 1B) compared with wild type littermates (Fig. 1A). Skeletal staining with alizarin red and Alcian blue revealed that mineralization was markedly reduced in trunk and limbs and affected ribs, vertebrae, and long bones (Fig. 1, A and B). Under-mineralization was also evident in the cranial base (Fig. 1D, arrow) compared with wild type (Fig. 1C), but calvaria mineralization appeared largely unaffected (Fig. 1, A and B). In addition to mineralization defects, transgenic skeletons displayed abnormalities in overall patterning, development, and growth, particularly in the limbs. Transgenic scapula, humerus, radius, and ulna were considerably short (Fig. 1H) and hind limb elements were sharply hypoplastic and totally un-mineralized (Fig. 1J) compared with corresponding wild type elements (Fig. 1, G and I). Ulna and radius had undergone fusion in some embryos (Fig. 1H, arrow) and digit joints were poorly formed (Fig. 1, H and J, arrowheads). Interestingly, the extent and overall patterns of Alcian blue staining suggested that transgenic cartilages and their extracellular matrices were actually not uniform and homogenous (Fig. 1L, arrows), although wild type cartilage displayed typical seamless matrix homogeneity (Fig. 1K).Growth Plate Defects—Histologically, long bone elements in wild type E18.5 limbs had a typical organization consisting of a well formed articular cap and joints, well defined zones of chondrocyte maturation in the growth plates, and active endochondral ossification in the diaphysis (Figs. 2, A, C, E, and G). In contrast, transgenic elements were completely disorganized (Fig. 2, B, D, F, and H). There was no clear histological demarcation of articular cap and joints, and typical growth plates were absent. Most if not all the chondrocytes, regardless of their localization with a given element, displayed uniform, round and relatively small-sized morphology and shape (Fig. 2, D and H, arrows), thus differing sharply from wild type chondrocytes displaying their characteristic and marked changes in cytoarchitecture and phenotype in different growth plate zones (Fig. 2, C and G). Interestingly, transgenic cartilage was not clearly distinguishable from adjacent tissues, and there was common occurrence of an apparent inter-mixing of cartilage tissues with adjacent connective and vascular tissues (Fig. 2, D and H, arrowheads). The latter probably accounts for the lack of uniform Alcian blue staining seen anatomically in similar transgenic specimens above (Fig. 1L).Fig. 2Histological analysis of limb skeletons. Longitudinal sections of fore (A–D) and hind (E–J) limb skeletons from E18.5 CA-LEF transgenic mouse embryos (TG; B, D, F, H, and J) and the wild type littermates (WT; A, C, E, G, and I) were subjected to H&E staining (A–H) or immunostaining with anti-HA antibody (I and J). Bars represent 1 mm for A, B, E, and F, and 0.2 mm for C, D, and G–J.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To verify that the above histological defects were associated with expression of CA-LEF in cartilage, sections were processed for immunohistochemistry using antibodies to HA tag present in the CA-LEF-encoding transgene. Transgenic cartilages were clearly stained by the HA antibodies, although surrounding tissues were not (Fig. 2J). In addition, every tissue in the wild type specimens was negative (Fig. 2I), reaffirming specificity of expression and staining.Gene Expression Patterns—The severe histological defects and chondrocyte cellular uniformity seen in transgenic growth plate cartilage suggested that the maturation program of chondrocytes had been markedly affected by CA-LEF expression. To characterize such possible changes, longitudinal sections of E18.5 limb skeletal elements were processed for histochemical staining with Safranin O to depict matrix proteoglycan deposition and for in situ hybridization to define the molecular cell phenotypes. Wild type specimens stained strongly with Safranin O both in their articular cap and growth plate, and low staining was seen in subadjacent endochondral bone and surrounding connective tissues as expected (Fig. 3A). In contrast, transgenic cartilages stained in a dull and substandard manner, and staining of cartilaginous masses was often not uniform (Fig. 3B, arrows). In situ hybridization showed that wild type articular cap and growth plate chondrocytes strongly expressed genes encoding cartilage-characteristic matrix macromolecules, such as Collagen IX and Aggrecan, and showed a prescribed reduction in expression of these genes in the hypertrophic zone (Fig. 3, C and E). The cartilage master regulator Sox9 displayed an identical and typical pattern (Fig. 3G), and the important signaling factor Indian hedgehog (IHH) was expressed in the pre-hypertrophic zone (Fig. 3I). Transgenic cartilage displayed very low and scattered expression of collagen IX and aggrecan (Fig. 3, D and F), poor expression of Sox9 (Fig. 3H), and undetectable expression of IHH (Fig. 3J). Not surprisingly then, expression of genes associated with chondrocyte hypertrophy and endochondral ossification, which is Collagen X, was completely absent in transgenic cartilage (Fig. 3L), whereas the gene exhibited a strong and restricted pattern in wild type (Fig. 3K).Fig. 3Histochemical and in situ hybridization characterizations of growth plate phenotype.

Such a basic quantity eludes both theory and observation, because of an imperfect understanding of the star-formation process and because of incompleteness in surveying the Galaxy. The Arches cluster is ideal for investigating such limits, being large enough to expect stars at least as massive as approximately 500 solar masses (approximately 500 Mo; based on a typical mass function), and young enough for its most massive members to still be visible. It is also old enough to be free of its natal molecular cloud, it is at a well-established distance, and it is close enough for us to discern its individual stars. Here I report an absence of stars with initial masses greater than 130 Mo in the Arches cluster, whereas the typical mass function predicts 18. I conclude that this indicates a firm limit of 150 Mo for stars; the probability that the observations are consistent with there being no upper limit is 10(-8)."

In contrast, evolution in nature can lead to efficient receptors and catalysts whose structures defy prediction. To access such unpredictable structures, we prepared dynamic combinatorial libraries in which reversibly binding building blocks assemble around a receptor target. We selected for an acetylcholine receptor by adding the neurotransmitter to solutions of dipeptide hydrazones [proline-phenylalanine or proline-(cyclohexyl)alanine], which reversibly combine through hydrazone linkages. At thermodynamic equilibrium, the dominant receptor structure was an elaborate [2]-catenane consisting of two interlocked macrocyclic trimers. This complex receptor with a 100 nM affinity for acetylcholine could be isolated on a preparative scale in 67% yield."

Integrin activation is mediated by phosphoinositol 3-kinase and is followed by an increase in integrin binding to extracellular matrix proteins. Mechanical stretch stimulation of JNK was dependent on new integrin binding to extracellular matrix. These data define a molecular mechanism for the role of integrins in mechanotransduction."

Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4060) Google Scholar). The key mediators of apoptosis are caspases, a family of cysteine proteases that cleave a critical set of cellular proteins near specific aspartic acid residues (2Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar). Apoptosis-inducing members of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily, such as Fas ligand (FasL) 1The abbreviations used are: FasL, Fas ligand; DISC, death-inducing signaling complex; DED, death effector domain; siRNA, small interfering RNA; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PBS-T, phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Tween 20; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; FMK, fluoromethyl ketone; IETD, Ile Glu Thr Asp; AFC, 7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin. and Apo2L/TRAIL, activate caspases through the cell extrinsic apoptosis signaling pathway by engaging their respective “death” receptors: Fas and DR4 or DR5, leading to assembly of the DISC (3Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5169) Google Scholar). Upon ligand stimulation, the adaptor protein FADD (Fas-associated death domain) binds to the receptor through homophilic death domain interactions. FADD then recruits the apoptosis initiator proteases caspase-8 and -10, through homophilic death effector domain (DED) interactions. The proximity of caspase molecules in the DISC facilitates their dimerization and thereby stimulates their proteolytic activity (4Shi Y. Cell. 2004; 117: 855-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 5Boatright K.M. Renatus M. Scott F.L. Sperandio S. Shin H. Pedersen I.M. Ricci J.E. Edris W.A.

Cell. 2003; 11: 543-549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Activation of caspase-8 is followed by two self-processing events; the first cleaves a 10-kDa fragment (p10) from the full-length caspase, leaving an intermediate fragment (p43/41) at the DISC, and the second cleaves an 18-kDa fragment (p18) from the p43/41 intermediate, allowing formation of an active caspase-8 (p18/p10)2 heterotetramer, which is released into the cytosol. In turn, cytosolic caspase-8 catalyzes the cleavage and activation of downstream effector caspases, such as caspase-3 and -7, which execute the apoptotic death program. c-FLIP (cellular FLICE inhibitory protein) is structurally related to procaspase-8 and -10 but lacks enzymatic activity (7Krueger A.

Immunol. 2001; 1: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). At least 10 splice variants of c-FLIP exist on the mRNA level, but often only two c-FLIP proteins are detected: a 26-kDa short form (c-FLIPS) and a 55-kDa long form (c-FLIPL) (9Scaffidi C. Schmitz I.

In contrast, c-FLIPL contains two N-terminal DEDs and a C-terminal caspase-like domain, similar to caspase-8 and -10. However, c-FLIPL is proteolytically inactive, because it lacks a specific cysteine residue that is critical for caspase activity. Both c-FLIP variants are capable of binding to the Fas DISC (7Krueger A. Baumann S. Krammer P.H. Kirchhoff S. Mol. Cell.

The presence of c-FLIPS or c-FLIPL in the Fas DISC does not preclude caspase-8 recruitment; rather, DISC-associated caspase-8/c-FLIP complexes are formed (9Scaffidi C. Schmitz I. Krammer P.H.

In contrast, c-FLIPL is cleaved between its large (p20) and small (p12) subunits by apical caspases in the DISC; however, a second cleavage between the large subunit and the N-terminal DEDs has not been detected, probably because of the lack of a conserved cleavage site (9Scaffidi C. Schmitz I. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1541-1548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Interaction of caspase-8 with c-FLIPS does not support caspase-8 activation; therefore, binding of c-FLIPS to the Fas DISC inhibits Fas-mediated apoptosis (7Krueger A. Baumann S. Krammer P.H. Kirchhoff S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8247-8254Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 8Thome M. Tschopp J. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 1: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Indeed, ectopic overexpression of c-FLIPS inhibits apoptosis induction by FasL or Apo2L/TRAIL (7Krueger A. Baumann S. Krammer P.H. Kirchhoff S. Mol. Cell.

Conversely, it has been shown that ectopically expressed c-FLIPL at the Fas DISC can support caspase-8 activation (14Micheau O. Thome M. Schneider P. Holler N. Tschopp J. Nicholson D.W. Briand C.

Furthermore, recent studies with purified components show that c-FLIPL activates caspase-8 or -10 through heterodimerization (17Boatright K.M. Deis C. Denault J.B. Sutherlin D.P. Salvesen G.S. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). However, caspase activity within heterodimers with c-FLIPL permits only partial processing of caspase-8, resulting in cleavage between the large and small subunit, but not between the DEDs and the large subunit, similar to the cleavage of c-FLIPL described above (13Krueger A. Schmitz I. Baumann S. Krammer P.H. Kirchhoff S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20633-20640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). The partial processing of active caspase-8 in caspase-8/c-FLIPL heterodimers retains active caspases-8 at the DISC, preventing its release into the cytosol (18Chang D.W. Xing Z. Capacio V.L. Peter M.E. Yang X. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4132-4142Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Although the role of c-FLIPS as an inhibitor of death receptor-mediated apoptosis is well understood and resembles the activity of v-FLIP proteins (7Krueger A. Baumann S. Krammer P.H. Kirchhoff S.

Furthermore, stable overexpression of c-FLIP in tumor cells promoted tumor growth in vivo, consistent with anti-apoptotic action (24Medema J. de Jong J. van Hall T. Melief C. Offringa R. J. Exp.

However, more recent work showed that ectopic c-FLIPL expression at levels that are roughly equivalent to those of endogenous c-FLIPL in HeLa and MCF7 cells augmented the induction of caspase-8 processing and apoptosis by FasL (15Chang D.W.

To date, loss-of-function studies that specifically interrogate the role of c-FLIPL in modulating caspase-8 activation at the DISC have not been reported. To examine the involvement of endogenous c-FLIPL in caspase-8 activation, we developed siRNA oligonucleotides that selectively knock down the expression of either c-FLIPL or c-FLIPS in several cancer cell lines and studied the effect of these siRNAs on apoptosis initiation by Apo2L/TRAIL. Knockdown of c-FLIPL enhanced the recruitment, activation, and processing of caspase-8 by the DISC, leading to greater effector caspase stimulation and apoptosis. Thus, despite the ability of c-FLIPL to support caspase-8 activation upon heterodimerization, the dominant role of endogenous c-FLIPL in the modulation of death receptor-mediated apoptosis initiation appears to be inhibitory. Cell Lines, Antibodies, and Reagents—A549 and H460 human lung carcinoma cells (catalog numbers CCl-185 and HTB-177, respectively) were obtained from ATCC and cultured in 50% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 50% FK12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, and antibiotics (penicillin/streptomycin). HeLa human cervical adenocarcinoma cells (catalog number CCL-2) and 293 human embryonic kidney cells (catalog number CRL-1573) also were obtained from ATCC and cultured in 100% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics (penicillin/streptomycin). U2OS human osteosarcoma cells were a gift from Ellen Filvaroff (Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA) and were maintained in McCoy's F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics (penicillin/streptomycin). Anti-c-FLIP antibody (NF6) (catalog number APO-20A-070-C050) was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals, (San Diego, CA). Anti-caspase-8 antibodies (1C12 (catalog number 9746) and 5C7 (catalog number 05-447)) were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA) and Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions (Lake Placid, NY), respectively. Anti-caspase-3 antibody (catalog number SA-320) was from BioMol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Anti-actin antibody (catalog number 69100) was from ICN Biomedicals (Aurora, OH). Anti-Apo2L (2E11) was generated at Genentech, Inc. Anti-DR4 (3G1 and 4G7) and anti-DR5 (3H3 and 5C7) monoclonal antibodies were generated at Genentech, Inc. using receptor-Fc fusion proteins as antigens. Anti-DR4 (4G7) and anti-DR5 (5C7) monoclonal antibodies, used to immunoprecipitate the Apo2L/TRAIL DISC, were conjugated to agarose using the ImmunoPure Protein G IgG Plus orientation kit (catalog number 44990) from Pierce. The anti-DR4 (3G1) and anti-DR5 (3H3) monoclonal antibodies, used for immunodetection of DR4/5 in DISC immunoprecipitations, were biotinylated using EZ-link Sulfo-NHS-LC biotinulation kit (catalog number 21217) from Pierce. As secondary reagents, we used horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1 (catalog number 559626) from BD PharMingen (San Diego, CA), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG2b (catalog number 1090-02) from Southern Biotechnology Associates (Birmingham, AL), or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin from Amersham Biosciences. As substrates for immunodetection we used either ECL from Amersham Biosciences or SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate from Pierce. Nontagged soluble Apo2L/TRAIL was prepared as described (35Lawrence D. Shahrokh Z. Marsters S. Achilles K. Shih D. Mounho B. Hillan K. Totpal K. DeForge L. Schow P. Hooley J. Sherwood S. Pai R.

FLAG-tagged Apo2L/TRAIL was prepared and cross-linked with anti-FLAG antibody M2 (Sigma) as described (36Kischkel F.C. Lawrence D.A. Chuntharapai A. Schow P. Kim K.J. Ashkenazi A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 611-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). FLAG-tagged FasL was prepared by cloning amino acids 130–281 of human FasL into pCMV FLAG (Sigma), followed by transient expression in Chinese hamster ovary cells and purification by affinity chromatography. Immunodetection—The cell lysates were prepared as described (36Kischkel F.C. Lawrence D.A. Chuntharapai A. Schow P. Kim K.J. Ashkenazi A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 611-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar) and quantitated using the BCA protein assay from Pierce. Between 15 and 50 μg of protein/lane was loaded onto a 10% (c-FLIP, caspase-8) or 4–12% (caspase-3) SDS-polyacrylamide gel, electrophoresed, and electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose following manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The membranes were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Tween 20 (PBS-T) and blocked with 5% milk in PBS-T overnight. The concentration of all primary antibodies was 1–2 μg/ml, secondary antibodies were used at 1:10,000–1:40,000 dilution, and horseradish peroxidase-strepavidin was used at a 1:250 dilution. The membranes were incubated with primary antibodies for 1–3 h, washed three times for 10 min in PBS-T, incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h, washed three times for 10 min in PBS-T, and exposed to either ECL or SuperSignal. Immunoprecipitation and DISC Analysis—These experiments were done as previously described for Apo2L/TRAIL-FLAG + anti-FLAG DISC analysis (36Kischkel F.C. Lawrence D.A. Chuntharapai A. Schow P. Kim K.J. Ashkenazi A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 611-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). The DR4/5 DISC immunoprecipitation experiments also were performed as described, except that anti-DR4 (4G7) and anti-DR5 (5C7) monoclonal antibodies were directly conjugated to agarose for the immunoprecipitation. siRNA Preparation and Transfection—siRNA oligonucleotides against c-FLIPL and c-FLIPS were synthesized by Dharmacon Research, Inc. (Lafayette, CO) using their custom SMARTpool and siDE-SIGN technology. siCONTROL Non-Targeting siRNA pool control (catalog number D-001206-13-20) was also from Dharmacon Research, Inc. All of the siRNA oligonucleotides were resuspended to a concentration of 20 μm. The cells were seeded for transfection in medium without antibiotics 1 day before transfection so that they were 85–95% confluent on the day of transfection. For transfection, regular medium was replaced with low serum media (0–10% FBS, depending on cell type) without antibiotics. The cells were transfected with siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) at a ratio of 1:1 to 1:3 siRNA (μg):Lipofectamine (μl), with a final concentration of 80–120 nm siRNA. The cells were incubated with the siRNA-Lipofectamine 2000 complexes overnight, and then low serum medium was replaced with normal media (10% FBS) without antibiotics and incubated for a total of 48–60 h before further analysis. Apoptosis Assays—To analyze cells for the percentage of apoptosis, we determined the percentage of subdiploid nuclei. The cells were stained with propidium iodide after ethanol fixation and RNase treatment and then analyzed by flow cytometry as previously described (37Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4431) Google Scholar), using CellQuest Pro software with a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Caspase Activity Assays in Whole Cell Extracts—The caspase-8 activity assay was performed using the BD ApoAlert caspase fluorescent assay kit (catalog number K2028-2), according to the manufacturer's instructions. siRNA-transfected cells were harvested, counted, and aliquoted at equal numbers for each treatment. The cells were treated with 100 ng/ml FLAG-tagged Apo2L/TRAIL for varying amounts of time at 37 °C and then lysed in manufacturer-provided cell lysis buffer. The cell supernatants were transferred to a 96-well plate and 2× reaction buffer/dithiothreitol and the fluorescent caspase-8 substrate (IETD-AFC) were added and incubated for 1–3 h at 37 °C before reading in a fluorometer at 400/505 nm. The caspase 3/7 assay was performed using Apo-One homogenous caspase-3/7 assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. siRNA-transfected cells were harvested, counted, and aliquoted at equal numbers for each treatment. The cells were treated with FLAG-tagged Apo2L/TRAIL at varying doses for 4 h at 37 °C and then lysed in manufacturer-provided homogeneous caspase-3/7 reagent (containing the caspase-3/7 substrate Z-DEVD-R110). The lysates were incubated at room temperature for 1–3 h before reading in a fluorometer at 485/530 nm. Caspase Activity Assays at the Apo2L/TRAIL DISC—The caspase-8 activity assay was performed using the Caspase-Glo 8 assay kit from Promega (catalog number G8201), according to the manufacturer's instructions, with the following modifications: siRNA-transfected cells were harvested, counted, and aliquoted at equal numbers (1–2 × 107 cells) for each treatment. The cells were treated with 333 ng/ml FLAG-tagged Apo2L/TRAIL + anti-FLAG M2 antibody for varying amounts of time at 37 °C and then lysed. The cell lysates were transferred to Immunopure Immobilized protein A/G beads (Pierce; catalog number 20421) and immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C. Protein A/G beads were washed four times in lysis buffer, resuspended in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (not eluted), and transferred to a white-walled 96-well plate. Equal volume (100 μl) Caspase-8 Glo reagent (Z-LETD-aminoluciferin) was added and incubated for 30 min to 2 h at room temperature before reading in a luminometer. Affinity Precipitation of Active Caspase-8 —siRNA-transfected cells were harvested, counted, and aliquoted at equal numbers (1–2 × 107 cells) for each treatment. The cells were treated with 333 ng/ml FLAG-tagged Apo2L/TRAIL + anti-FLAG M2 for varying amounts of time at 37 °C and then lysed. The cell lysates were incubated with 10 μm Biotin-IETD-FMK at 37 °C for 30 min to label active sites and transferred to immunopure immobilized streptavidin beads (Pierce; catalog number 20349) for precipitation overnight at 4 °C. Streptavidin beads were washed five times in lysis buffer and eluted in sample buffer for immunoblot analysis. Knockdown of Endogenous c-FLIPL Enhances Apoptosis Induction by Apo2L/TRAIL—Taking advantage of the different C-terminal ends of the c-FLIP variants, we designed siRNA oligonucleotides (38Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8186) Google Scholar) expected to knock down either c-FLIPL (P5), c-FLIPS (s1), or both variants together (P1, P3, P6). We transfected human A549 lung carcinoma cells with these siRNAs, incubated the cells for 48 h, and examined the levels of c-FLIP proteins by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1A). The results confirmed the ability of oligonucleotides P5 and s1 to knock down expression of FLIPL and FLIPS, respectively, whereas P1 and P3 knocked down both c-FLIP variants, and P6 was ineffective at knocking down c-FLIPL. Apoptosis analysis (Fig. 1C) indicated that knockdown of c-FLIPL increased the level of spontaneous cell death to ∼10% as compared with transfection of the control siRNA, whereas knockdown of c-FLIPS had a minimal effect. Notably, depletion of both c-FLIP variants resulted in 33–35% of the cells undergoing spontaneous apoptosis. This observation suggests that the two c-FLIP variants may act cooperatively in A549 cells to block apoptosis signals that may spontaneously emanate from death receptors. We therefore focused our subsequent experiments on knocking down either c-FLIPL or FLIPS, but not both. Given the high degree of sequence homology between c-FLIP and caspase-8 and -10, we examined the effect of c-FLIP siRNA transfection and consequent protein reduction on caspase-8 and -10 protein levels. None of the c-FLIP siRNA oligonucleotides showed a significant effect on the amounts of caspase-8 and -10 (Fig. 1B). Transfection with the P1 and P3 siRNA oligonucleotides was associated with some degree of spontaneous processing of caspase-8, as indicated by the presence of a p43/41 band, consistent with increased apoptosis in cells with both c-FLIP variants reduced (Fig. 1C). These results verify that the c-FLIP siRNA oligonucleotides specifically knock down c-FLIPL, c-FLIPS, or both but not caspase-8 or -10. To assess the effect of c-FLIP knockdown on death receptor-induced apoptosis, we transfected the A549 cells with control or c-FLIP variant-specific siRNA, incubated them for 48 h, added increasing doses of Apo2L/TRAIL for another 4 h, and determined the resulting amount of apoptosis. c-FLIP variant knockdown was confirmed (Fig. 2A, inset). Knockdown of c-FLIPL modestly increased the level of apoptosis in the absence of added ligand and substantially enhanced apoptosis induction by Apo2L/TRAIL at all doses (Fig. 2A); depletion of c-FLIPS also augmented apoptosis sensitivity, particularly at higher doses of Apo2L/TRAIL. Next, we examined the effect of c-FLIP variant knockdown on the time course of Apo2L/TRAIL-induced apoptosis. To this end, we transfected A549 cells with control or c-FLIP variant-specific siRNA and treated with an intermediate dose of Apo2L/TRAIL (33 ng/ml) for increasing amounts of time. c-FLIP variant knockdown was confirmed (Fig. 2B, inset). c-FLIPL-depleted A549 cells were more sensitive to Apo2L/TRAIL and underwent Apo2L/TRAIL-induced apoptosis much earlier than control cells (Fig. 2B, 2 h). Knockdown of c-FLIPS also increased Apo2L/TRAIL-induced apoptosis as early as 2 h but not as robustly as c-FLIPL"
https://openalex.org/W1971939635,"The endo-β-glucuronidase, heparanase, is an enzyme that cleaves heparan sulfate at specific intra-chain sites, yielding heparan sulfate fragments with appreciable size and biological activities. Heparanase activity has been traditionally correlated with cell invasion associated with cancer metastasis, angiogenesis, and inflammation. In addition, heparanase up-regulation has been documented in a variety of primary human tumors, correlating with increased vascular density and poor postoperative survival, suggesting that heparanase may be considered as a target for anticancer drugs. In an attempt to identify the protein motif that would serve as a target for the development of heparanase inhibitors, we looked for protein domains that mediate the interaction of heparanase with its heparan sulfate substrate. We have identified three potential heparin binding domains and provided evidence that one of these is mapped at the N terminus of the 50-kDa active heparanase subunit. A peptide corresponding to this region (Lys158–Asp171) physically associates with heparin and heparan sulfate. Moreover, the peptide inhibited heparanase enzymatic activity in a dose-responsive manner, presumably through competition with the heparan sulfate substrate. Furthermore, antibodies directed to this region inhibited heparanase activity, and a deletion construct lacking this domain exhibited no enzymatic activity. NMR titration experiments confirmed residues Lys158–Asn162 as amino acids that firmly bound heparin. Deletion of a second heparin binding domain sequence (Gln270–Lys280) yielded an inactive enzyme that failed to interact with cell surface heparan sulfate and hence accumulated in the culture medium of transfected HEK 293 cells to exceptionally high levels. The two heparin/heparan sulfate recognition domains are potentially attractive targets for the development of heparanase inhibitors.

The two heparin/heparan sulfate recognition domains are potentially attractive targets for the development of heparanase inhibitors. Heparan-sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) 1The abbreviations used are: HSPGs, heparan sulfate proteoglycans; HS, heparan sulfate; ECM, extracellular matrix; WT, wild type; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; CM, conditioned medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HA, hyaluronic acid; GS, glycol-split. are members of the glycosaminoglycan family, a class of molecules that consists of unbranched, repeated disaccharide units attached to a core protein. Proteoglycans are present essentially in every tissue compartment, localized in the extracellular matrix (ECM), on the cell surface, intracellularly in granules, and even in the nucleus (1Couchman J.R. Nature Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 926-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 2Hiscock D.R. Yanagishita M. Hascall V.C. J. Biol.

Virtually all cells express at least one proteoglycan on their surface. Membrane-associated proteoglycans are mostly HS that can be either transmembrane (syndecan) or glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored (glypican). From mice to worms, embryos that lack HS die during gastrulation (3Kramer K.L. Yost H.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2003; 37: 461-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), suggesting a critical developmental role for HSPGs. HSPGs play key roles in numerous biological settings, including cytoskeleton organization, cell/cell, and cell/ECM interactions (4Iozzo R.V. San Antonio J.D. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 5Sasisekharan R. Shriver Z. Venkataraman G. Narayanasami U. Nature Rev.

For biological function, HSPGs exert their multiple functional repertoire via several distinct mechanisms that combine structural, biochemical, and regulatory aspects. By interacting with other macromolecules such as laminin, fibronectin, and collagen IV, HSPGs contribute to the structural integrity, self-assembly, and insolubility of the ECM and basement membrane. ECM components are, however, only one class of HSPG-binding proteins. In fact, numerous enzymes, growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines are sequestered by HSPGs on the cell surface and ECM, most often as an inactive reservoir (7Capila I. Linhardt R.J. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2002; 41: 391-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (1550) Google Scholar, 8Munoz E.M. Linhardt R.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 1549-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Cleavage of HSPGs would ultimately release these polypeptides and convert them into bioactive mediators, thus ensuring rapid tissue response to local environmental alterations. The protein core of HSPGs is susceptible to cleavage by several classes of proteases (9Fitzgerald M.L. Wang Z. Park P.W. Murphy G. Bernfield M. J.

The heparanase cDNA encodes for a protein of 543 amino acids that undergoes proteolytic processing at two potential cleavage sites, Glu109–Ser110 and Gln157–Lys158, yielding an 8-kDa polypeptide at the N terminus and a 50-kDa polypeptide at the C terminus that heterodimerize to form an active heparanase enzyme (30Fairbanks M.B.

Based on published consensus sequences that mediate the interaction between polypeptides and heparin, we have identified three potential heparin binding domains mapped at Lys158–Asp171, Gln270–Lys280, and Lys411–Arg432 of the 50-kDa heparanase subunit. Here we provide evidence that the Lys158–Asp171 N-terminal peptide physically associates with heparin and HS more strongly than the other two peptides. Moreover, the peptide inhibits heparanase enzymatic activity in a dose-responsive manner, presumably through competition with the HS substrate. Furthermore, antibodies directed to this region inhibit heparanase activity (34Zetser A. Levy-Adam F. Kaplan V. Gingis-Velitski S. Bashenko Y. Schubert S. Flugelman M.Y. Vlodavsky I. Ilan N. J.

Vlodavsky I. Ilan N. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7733-7741PubMed Google Scholar). Heparanase Deletion Mutants—Human heparanase cDNA constructs were generated using splice overlap extension PCR (40Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2641) Google Scholar), applying the pcDNA3-Hpa plasmid (31Levy-Adam F. Miao H.Q. Heinrikson R.L. Vlodavsky I. Ilan N. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Briefly, two PCRs were performed to generate overlapping 5′ and 3′ fragments encoding each mutation, followed by a third PCR for the fusion of the two fragments. The following primers were used in each PCR: for the Lys158–Val172 deletion (65Δ15 variant): PCR1, 8F (31Levy-Adam F. Miao H.Q. Heinrikson R.L. Vlodavsky I. Ilan N. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The final PCR (PCR3) for the fusion of the above fragments was performed with 8F and 50R primers. For introducing the deletions in the 50-kDa heparanase the following primers were used: 50Δ15F, 5′-GGAATTCTATACACTTTTGCAAACTGCT-3′, and 50R primers, for generation of the 50Δ15-kDa variant, PCR1, 50F (31Levy-Adam F. Miao H.Q. Heinrikson R.L. Vlodavsky I. Ilan N. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Expression Vectors—The forward primers (8F and 50F) contained an inserted EcoRI restriction site, and the reverse primer (50R) contained an XhoI restriction site that enabled cloning in-frame into the pSecTag2A vector (Invitrogen). Proteins cloned in this vector contained c-Myc and His6 tags in their C terminus. Following PCR with a proofreading enzyme (Pfu, Promega, Madison, WI), the vector and the constructs were digested with EcoRI and XhoI and ligated with T4 ligase. The clones were propagated in DH5α Escherichia coli strain. DNA sequencing of the constructs was performed using vector- and construct-specific primers. Cell Lines and Transfection—HEK 293 and B16 melanoma cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, glutamine, pyruvate, and antibiotics. Transient or stable transfection was performed using FuGENE reagent, according to the manufacturer instructions (Roche Applied Science). 48 h following transfection, cells were harvested, lysed, and analyzed by immunoblotting and heparanase enzyme activity assays or were subjected to selection with 500 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen). Stable transfectant pools were obtained after 2–3 weeks and used for further experiments. Immunoblotting, Metabolic Labeling, and Immunoprecipitation— Cell extracts were prepared using a lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Protein concentration was determined (Bradford reagent, Bio-Rad), and 30 μg of protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) and probed with the appropriate antibody followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) and an enhanced chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Metabolic labeling was performed essentially as described (34Zetser A. Levy-Adam F. Kaplan V. Gingis-Velitski S. Bashenko Y. Schubert S. Flugelman M.Y. Vlodavsky I. Ilan N. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2249-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent cell cultures were methionine-starved for 30 min prior to the addition of 150 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences) and pulsed for 20 min. For immunoprecipitation, equal volumes (0.1 ml) or equal trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts/min of lysate samples were brought to a volume of 1 ml with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (buffer A) and incubated with anti-Myc tag antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. Protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were then added for an additional 30 min. Beads were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with buffer A supplemented with 300 mm NaCl and 5% sucrose and once again with buffer A. Sample buffer was then added, and after boiling at 100 °C for 5 min, samples were subjected to electrophoresis as described above. Gels were fixed (30 min, 25% isopropyl alcohol + 10% acetic acid) and fluorographed (30 min, Amplify, Amersham Biosciences) following drying and autoradiography. Heparanase Activity Assay—Preparation of ECM-coated 35-mm dishes and determination of heparanase activity were performed as described in detail elsewhere (14Vlodavsky I. Friedmann Y. Elkin M. Aingorn H. Atzmon R. Ishai-Michaeli R. Bitan M. Pappo O. Peretz T. Michal I. Spector L. Pecker I. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar, 31Levy-Adam F. Miao H.Q. Heinrikson R.L. Vlodavsky I. Ilan N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 308: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). For inhibition studies, heparanase (20 ng) was incubated (2 h, 37 °C) with 35S-labeled ECM in the presence of the indicated concentration of peptides. For heparanase inhibition studies with intact cells, B16 melanoma cells (2 × 106) were resuspended in RPMI medium and incubated (18 h, 37 °C) with 35S-labeled ECM in the presence of the indicated peptide concentration. To evaluate heparanase activity in cell extracts, heparanase-transfected 293 cells (1 × 106) expressing the WT or deletion constructs were lysed by three freeze/thaw cycles, and the resulting cell extracts were incubated (18 h, 37 °C) with 35S-labeled ECM. The incubation medium (1 ml) containing sulfate-labeled degradation fragments was subjected to gel filtration on a Sepharose CL-6B column. Fractions (0.2 ml) were eluted with PBS, and their radioactivity was counted in a β-scintillation counter. Degradation fragments of HS side chains are eluted at 0.5 < Kav < 0.8 (peak II, fractions 15–30) and represent heparanase degradation products. Nearly intact HSPGs are eluted just after the V0 (Kav < 0.2, peak I, fractions 3–15) (14Vlodavsky I. Friedmann Y. Elkin M. Aingorn H. Atzmon R. Ishai-Michaeli R. Bitan M. Pappo O. Peretz T. Michal I. Spector L. Pecker I. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). These high molecular weight products are released by proteases that cleave the HSPG core protein. Heparin/HS Binding—Peptides (50 μm) were incubated (2 h, 4 °C) with heparin/HS-Sepharose beads in PBS, washed with PBS supplemented with NaCl to a final concentration of 0.35 m, followed by one wash with PBS. Dye-free sample buffer was added, and the beads were boiled for 5 min and centrifuged, and the supernatants were loaded on Tris-Tricine gel. Subsequently, gels were stained with Coomassie Blue to visualize bound peptides. For inhibition of heparanase binding to heparin, 20 ng of heparanase protein were incubated with heparin-Sepharose beads in the presence of increasing concentrations of the peptide of interest or its scrambled control peptide, followed by two washes with PBS supplemented with 0.6 m NaCl. Sample buffer was then added, and the mixture was boiled for 5 min and centrifuged, and the supernatant was subjected to immunoblotting with anti-heparanase antibodies. Extracellular accumulation of heparanase in the presence of heparin was examined as described (41Gingis-Velitski S. Zetser A. Kaplan V. Ben-Zaken O. Cohen E. Levy-Adam F. Bashenko Y. Flugelman M.Y. Vlodavsky I. Ilan N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44084-44092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Briefly, stable transfected 293 cells expressing the 65-kDa WT, point-mutated, or the deletion (Δ10, Δ15, and Δ20) variants were incubated (18 h, 37 °C) with heparin, HS, and hyaluronic acid (HA) or glycol-split modified heparin under serum-free conditions. Medium was then collected and subjected to immunoblotting without or with prior precipitation with 10% trichloroacetic acid. Cell extracts were prepared, and 30 μg of protein were similarly analyzed. Heparanase Uptake—Uptake experiments were carried out essentially as described (34Zetser A. Levy-Adam F. Kaplan V. Gingis-Velitski S. Bashenko Y. Schubert S. Flugelman M.Y. Vlodavsky I. Ilan N. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2249-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 41Gingis-Velitski S. Zetser A. Kaplan V. Ben-Zaken O. Cohen E. Levy-Adam F. Bashenko Y. Flugelman M.Y. Vlodavsky I. Ilan N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44084-44092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Briefly, CHO K1 cells were incubated with 1 μg of 65-kDa WT or the 65Δ10 heparanase for the indicated time under serum-free conditions. At each time point the medium was aspirated, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and cell extracts were analyzed by immunoblotting as described above. For uptake inhibition studies, heparanase was iodinated to a high specific activity by the chloramine T (Sigma) method. Iodinated heparanase was added to CHO cells together with the Lys158–Asp171 (KKDC) peptide or its scrambled control peptide. Following incubation (1 h, 4 °C), cells were washed, lysed, and counted with γ-counter. NMR Spectra—NMR samples of the unlabeled Lys158–Asp171 peptide (KKDC) and the corresponding scrambled sequence were dissolved in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 5.8, supplemented with 0.15 m NaCl and 10% D2O. All NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 600 spectrometer equipped with a quadruple resonance proton-carbon-nitrogen-deuterium 5-mm probe (Bruker TCI cryo-probe®), with cooled coil and preamplifier and using a self-shielded z gradient coil. Spectra were acquired nonspinning at temperatures of 295 K. For two-dimensional homonuclear 1H experiments, DQF-COSY, TOCSY, and ROESY were performed according to the Bruker library pulse sequences. For ROESY, mixing times of 200 ms and a spin-lock of 150 ms obtained by continuous irradiation were used. COSY/TOCSY and ROESY experiments were acquired using 8 and 16 scans per series of 1Kx512W data points, respectively. Data were zero filled in F1, and a shifted squared cosine function was applied prior to Fourier transformation. Water suppression was carried out using excitation sculpting sequence with gradients (42Hwang T.L. Shaka A.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1998; 135: 280-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC experiments were acquired with 96 scans for each of 320 increments on F1 dimension. The matrix size 1Kx512 was zero filled to 4Kx2K by application of a squared cosine function prior to Fourier transformation. Titration Experiments—For titration of both the KKDC and scrambled control peptide with the synthetic pentasaccharide: GlcNSO3,6SO3-GlcA-GlcNSO3,3,6SO3-IdoA2SO3-GlcNSO3,6SO3-OMe (AGA*IA) (Sanofi-Synthelabo®), peptides concentration were 1.3 mm in the buffer described above. To minimize dilution, titration steps were carried out by adding small quantities (8 μl) of a concentrated (58 mm) solution of AGA*IA pentasaccharide to reach a peptide/pentasaccharide molar ratio of 1:5 (asterisk indicates a trisulfated saccharide). Proton and nitrogen chemical shifts of the amide cross-peaks of HSQC spectra were measured. Values were referred to trimethylsilyl propionate sodium salt and urea for proton and nitrogen, respectively. For each NH cross-peak, the composite chemical shift variation vector ΔCS (ΔCS = [(ΔδHN2 + ΔδN2/25)/2]1/2) for both peptides was calculated. Identification of Heparin Binding domains—Sequence alignment of heparin binding domains from several proteins had led to the characterization of two consensus sequences, XBBXBX and XBBBXXBX, where B is basic and X is hydropathic (neutral and hydrophobic) amino acid (43Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 21-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the primary protein sequence of heparanase revealed the existence of two domains that match the consensus sequence for heparin binding (Fig. 1). These are mapped at Lys158–Asp162 (KKFKN), which is the N terminus region of the 50-kDa heparanase subunit, and at Pro271–Met278 (PRRKTAKM) (the boldface letters represent basic amino acids that comprise a consensus sequence for heparin binding) (Fig. 1). A third domain contains two clusters of basic amino acids in tandem (Lys411–Lys417 and Lys427–Arg432) (Fig. 1) and is considered as a potential heparin binding domain as well. The KKDC (Lys158–Asp171) Peptide Physically Interacts with HS—In order to study the relevance of the above sequences for heparanase/HS interaction, we synthesized three peptides that contained the putative heparin binding domain (Fig. 2A).

https://openalex.org/W2047904155,"The StarD4 and StarD5 proteins share ∼30% identity, and each is a steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR)-related lipid transfer (START) domain. We previously showed StarD4 expression is sterol-repressed, consistent with regulation by sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), whereas StarD5 is not sterol-regulated. Here we further address the regulation and function of StarD4 and StarD5. Unlike StAR, the START family prototype, StarD4 and StarD5 were not induced by steroidogenic stimuli in Leydig cells. However, StarD4 and StarD5 showed StAR-like activity in a cell culture steroidogenesis assay, indicating cholesterol transfer. In transgenic mice expressing active SREBPs, StarD4 was predominantly activated by SREBP-2 rather than SREBP-1a. The mouse and human StarD4 proximal promoters share ∼70% identity, including several potential sterol regulatory elements (SREs). Reporters driven by the StarD4 promoter from either species were transfected into NIH-3T3 cells, and reporter activity was highly repressed by sterols. Site-directed mutagenesis of potential SREs identified a conserved functional SRE in the mouse (TCGGTCCAT) and human (TCATTCCAT) promoters. StarD5 was not sterol-repressed via SREBPs nor was it sterol-activated via liver X receptors (LXRs). Even though StarD4 and StarD5 were not LXR targets, their overexpression stimulated LXR reporter activity, suggesting roles in cholesterol metabolism. StarD5 expression increased 3-fold in free cholesterol-loaded macrophages, which activate the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. When NIH-3T3 cells were treated with agents to induce ER stress, StarD5 expression increased 6–8-fold. Because StarD4 is regulated by sterols via SREBP-2, whereas StarD5 is activated by ER stress, they likely serve distinct functions in cholesterol metabolism.

Breslow J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22183-22186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). A START domain is an ∼210-amino acid globular protein domain with an internal hydrophobic cavity for lipid binding. Based on phylogenetic analysis of the START family, StarD4, StarD5, and StarD6 form a subfamily most closely related to the cholesterol binding START domains of the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR/StarD1) and MLN64 (StarD3) (2Soccio R.E. Adams R.M. Romanowski M.J. Sehayek E. Burley S.K. Breslow J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6943-6948Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). StAR delivers cholesterol to mitochondria in steroidogenic cells (3Stocco D.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 193-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar), whereas MLN64 has been implicated in cholesterol movement from endosomes (4Strauss J.F. Liu P. Christenson L.K. Watari H. Steroids. 2002; 67: 947-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Other START proteins like phosphatidylcholine transfer protein (PCTP/StarD2) (5Roderick S.L. Chan W.W. Agate D.S. Olsen L.R. Vetting M.W. Rajashankar K.R. Cohen D.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 507-511PubMed Google Scholar) and ceramide transporter (CERT/GPBP/StarD11) (6Hanada K. Kumagai K. Yasuda S. Miura Y. Kawano M. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Nature. 2003; 426: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar) are more distantly related to the StarD4 subfamily. Therefore, the StarD4 subfamily is likely to function in cholesterol metabolism. StarD4 and StarD5 are widely expressed, with highest levels in liver, whereas StarD6 expression is limited to testis. StarD4 was first identified using microarrays as a gene whose expression in mouse liver decreased ∼3-fold upon cholesterol feeding (2Soccio R.E. Adams R.M. Romanowski M.J. Sehayek E. Burley S.K. Breslow J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6943-6948Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In both mouse liver and cultured cells, StarD4 showed the same pattern of gene regulation as known targets of the sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), whereas StarD5 was not sterol-regulated. Two transcription factor families, the SREBPs and liver X receptors (LXRs), are implicated in gene regulation by cholesterol and its oxysterol metabolites (7Schoonjans K. Brendel C. Mangelsdorf D. Auwerx J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 114-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). When sterols are low, SREBPs activate genes responsible for synthesis and uptake of cholesterol and fatty acids (8Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (3710) Google Scholar). Two SREBP genes encode three distinct proteins; SREBP-1a and SREBP-1c predominantly activate genes involved in fatty acid metabolism, whereas SREBP-2 targets are involved in cholesterol metabolism (8Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (3710) Google Scholar). When sterols are in excess, SREBPs are inactive, whereas the LXR nuclear receptors are activated by oxysterol ligands. Most known LXR target genes function in reverse cholesterol transport, a process by which high density lipoproteins transport cholesterol from peripheral cells to the liver, where it is excreted in bile as free cholesterol or bile acids (9Repa J.J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1243-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). There is cross-talk between LXRs and other transcriptional pathways, notably LXRs stimulating fatty acid synthesis by activating SREBP-1c expression (10Repa J.J. Liang G. Ou J. Bashmakov Y. Lobaccaro J.M. Shimomura I. Shan B. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mangelsdorf D.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2819-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar). Recently, cholesterol was shown to activate a third transcriptional pathway, as free cholesterol-loaded macrophages trigger the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response (11Feng B. Yao P.M. Li Y. Devlin C.M. Zhang D. Harding H.P. Sweeney M. Rong J.X. Kuriakose G. Fisher E.A. Marks A.R. Ron D. Tabas I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 781-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Known ER stress target genes include ER chaperones, ER calcium channels, pro-apoptotic transcription factors, and components of the secretory pathway (12Kaufman R.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1389-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar), but additional targets could function in cholesterol metabolism. In this study we address the differential gene regulation for StarD4 and StarD5. Although both showed StAR-like cholesterol transfer activity in a cell culture steroidogenesis assay, their expression is not activated like StAR during steroidogenesis. In the SREBP transgenic mouse model, StarD4 expression was preferentially induced by SREBP-2 compared to SREBP-1a. In cell culture reporter transfection assays, luciferase reporters driven by the StarD4 promoter were sterol-regulated. Potential SREs were identified in the mouse and human StarD4 promoters, and each was targeted by site-directed mutagenesis to identify one conserved functional element. StarD5 was not sterol-regulated via SREBPs or LXRs, but ER stress activated StarD5 expression 6–8-fold in cultured cells. Finally, in transient transfection overexpression assays, StarD4 and StarD5 showed two functional activities, 1) stimulation of steroidogenesis by the mitochondrial P450scc enzyme and 2) stimulation of LXR reporter activity. Because the known cholesterol transfer proteins StAR and MLN64 shared these activities, StarD4 and StarD5 likely also function in cholesterol metabolism. Animals and Diets—Transgenic mice expressing truncated nuclear forms of human SREBP-1a or SREBP-2 were obtained from Jackson Laboratory (catalog numbers 002840 and 003311) and backcrossed to C57BL/6. Mice were genotyped by PCR from tail tip DNA using primers in Supplemental Table I. N6/N7 generation SREBP-1a and N2/N3 SREBP-2 mice were used in these studies. Transgenic and littermate control male mice were fed standard rodent chow from birth to 8 weeks. They were then switched to a 65% protein, 10% carbohydrate diet (Purina TestDiet 8092) for 2 weeks to induce maximal transgene expression, since the SREBP transgenes were under the control of the PEPCK (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase) promoter (13Horton J.D.

For the LXR agonist study, 7-week-old male C57BL/6 mice on a semisynthetic modified AIN76a diet containing 0.00% cholesterol (Clinton/Cybulsky Rodent Diet (15Lichtman A.H. Clinton S.K. Iiyama K.

This treatment was repeated after 24 h, and mice were sacrificed later the same day. At the end of each experiment mice were fasted for 5–6 h early in the light cycle, sedated with ketamine/xylazine, and sacrificed. Livers were harvested and stored in RNAlater (Ambion) according to manufacturer's instructions. Gene Expression Assays—RNA preparation, Northern blotting, and TaqMan real-time quantitative RT-PCR (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were performed as previously described (2Soccio R.E. Adams R.M. Romanowski M.J. Sehayek E. Burley S.K. Breslow J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6943-6948Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). For Northern probes the mouse StarD5 open reading frame (ORF) and β-actin primers were as described (2Soccio R.E. Adams R.M. Romanowski M.J. Sehayek E. Burley S.K. Breslow J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6943-6948Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The mouse TaqMan primers have also been described for StarD4 ORF, StarD5, MLN64, HMGR, HMGS, FABP5, and ABCG5 (2Soccio R.E. Adams R.M. Romanowski M.J. Sehayek E. Burley S.K. Breslow J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6943-6948Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 16Maxwell K.N. Soccio R.E. Duncan E.M. Sehayek E. Breslow J.L. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 2109-2119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), whereas those for StAR and BiP are shown in Supplemental Table I. Cloning and PCR—All molecular cloning followed standard techniques using enzymes from New England Biolabs. PCR reagents were from Advantage cDNA polymerase kit (Clontech), primers were from Genelink, and thermal cycling was on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 7700. All DNA constructs were sequence verified at the Rockefeller University DNA Sequencing Resource Center. DNA sequence was aligned and analyzed using the DNAStar software package. FLAG-START Expression Plasmids—START domain coding sequences were PCR-amplified from C57BL/6 mouse liver or testis cDNA using primers with restriction sites at their 5′ tails. The primers for StarD4 and StarD5 ORFs were as previously described (2Soccio R.E. Adams R.M. Romanowski M.J. Sehayek E. Burley S.K. Breslow J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6943-6948Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), whereas the StAR START domain, MLN64 START domain, and PCTP ORF primer sequences are shown in Supplemental Table I. The PCR products were generally cloned into BamHI and XhoI sites of the pCMV-Tag2B FLAG epitope tagging mammalian expression vector (Stratagene). The mouse StarD5 sequence has an internal BamHI site, so it was cloned using 5′ PstI instead. Mouse StAR has an internal XhoI site but was cloned using this enzyme by partial digestion. All expression plasmids were sequence-verified using T3 and T7 primers to assure correct START domain sequence and in-frame fusion of the N-terminal FLAG epitope tag. Mouse StarD4 and PCTP had coding single nucleotide polymorphisms characteristic of the C57BL/6 strain (StarD4, Ala-121, Thr-152; PCTP, Gly-205, Gly-324, Gly-379), compared with those found in some other strains like FVB. For anti-FLAG Western blots, whole cell lysates from transfected COS-1 cells were prepared in lysis buffer with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Protein concentrations were measured using BCA reagent (Pierce), and 50 μg of protein was loaded in each well of pre-cast 12% polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen) for SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen), and blots were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline-casein (Pierce). The primary antibody was 1:500 anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma), and the secondary antibody was 1:2000 goat anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase (Sigma). Blots were washed in phosphate-buffered saline-Tween and developed using Renaissance Chemiluminescence Reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE)—Total liver RNA was prepared from chow-fed C57BL/6 mice, and pooled human total liver RNA was purchased from Clontech. The FirstChoice RLM-RACE kit (Ambion) was used according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, total RNA was treated with phosphatase, decapped, 5′-ligated to a RACE adaptor sequence, and reverse-transcribed. The resulting cDNA was the template for nested PCRs with 5′ inner and outer primers in the adaptor and 3′ gene-specific inner and outer primers. 5′ genespecific primers served as controls, and the sequences of mouse and human StarD4 RACE primers are shown in Supplemental Table I. RACE inner PCR products were TA-cloned with pCR-2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen) and sequenced. StarD4 Reporter Cloning and Mutagenesis—PCR primers were designed to amplify StarD4 promoter sequence from genomic DNA. The mouse StarD4 proximal promoter was amplified from C57BL/6 genomic DNA using a forward primer at -1335 and reverse primers at either +34 or +137 (Supplemental Table I). The forward primer had a SacI tail, and reverse primers had HindIII tails. These PCR products were TA-cloned. To generate the -1335 StarD4 reporters, the entire SacI/HindIII fragment was subcloned into these sites in the pGL3 basic luciferase vector (Promega). To generate -874 reporters, BglII (which cuts at -874) and HindIII-digested promoter fragments were cloned into these sites of pGL3. To generate -350 reporters, such as the -350/+34 reporter used in most experiments, BamHI (which cuts at -350) and HindIII-digested fragments were cloned into the BglII/HindIII sites of pGL3. The human StarD4 proximal promoter from -521 to -8 was similarly amplified from genomic DNA with BamHI and HindIII tails and cloned into pGL3. Mutations were generated in the mouse -350/+34 and human -521/-8 reporters using the GeneEditor in vitro site-directed mutagenesis system (Promega) according to manufacturer's instructions. The mouse and human StarD4 mutagenic oligos to eliminate potential SREs and CCAAT boxes are shown in Supplemental Table I. The mutations were designed to add or remove restriction sites so mutant clones could be identified. All wild type and mutant StarD4 reporter constructs were sequence-verified. A potential SREBP-binding E box has been reported in the pGL3 polylinker between the SacI and BglII sites (17Annicotte J.S. Schoonjans K. Haby C. Auwerx J. Biotechniques. 2001; 31 (and 996): 993-994PubMed Google Scholar). The mouse -350/+34 and human -521/-8 StarD4 reporters were cloned into the BglII and HindIII sites and, thus, included this potentially confounding element. Therefore, additional forward primers with 5′ SacI tails for mouse -350 and human -281 were generated to PCR amplify and re-clone these reporters (Supplemental Table I). These modified SacI/HindIII wild type and SRE-B mutant reporters showed the same activity and regulation as the previous BglII/HindIII versions, indicating that the putative E-box had no effect in these studies (data not shown). Cell Culture, Media, and Treatments—All cultured mammalian cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2. MA-10 cells (a gift of Jonathan Smith) were cultured in Waymouth's medium with 15% horse serum. To stimulate steroidogenesis, MA-10 cells were cultured in 1 μm 8-bromo-cAMP (Sigma) for 3 h. Media was withdrawn and pregnenolone levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Diagnostic Biochem Canada). All other cell types (NIH-3T3, COS-1, RAW, and Hepa-1) were obtained from ATCC and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. NIH-3T3 cells were grown as fibroblast-like cells and were not differentiated to adipocytes. Lipoprotein-depleted serum was prepared from fetal bovine serum by ultracentrifugation as described (2Soccio R.E. Adams R.M. Romanowski M.J. Sehayek E. Burley S.K. Breslow J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6943-6948Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with various drugs and agents from Sigma. To regulate SREBP activity, 1000× stock solutions were made for cholesterol (10 mg/ml) and 25-hydroxycholesterol (1 mg/ml) in ethanol as well as mevinolin/lovastatin (1 mg/ml). To ER stress cells, 1000× stocks were made for tunicamycin (2.5 mg/ml in methanol), thapsigargin (2 mm), brefeldin A (10 mg/ml in ethanol), or dithiothreitol (2 m). Other 1000× stocks were 10 mm T0901317 and 1 mg/ml for 22(R)-hydroxy-cholesterol, both in ethanol. To treat cells, these agents were added to media containing lipoprotein-depleted serum or fetal bovine serum at a final concentration of 1×, thus, 1:1000 of the stock concentrations above. Vehicle control experiments showed no effect of 0.1% ethanol or methanol in the various assays (data not shown). Treatments were preformed on subconfluent cells in 6-well plates for 18–20 h. Transient Transfection Experiments—Before all transfection assays, cells were split into 24-well plates at ∼104 cells per well and grown overnight. The next day each well of 50–80% confluent cells was transfected with 200–400 ng of total plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine PLUS reagent (Invitrogen). Data are presented as the mean and S.D. of triplicate wells. For the steroidogenesis assay each well of COS-1 cells was transfected with 100 ng of F2 P450scc expression plasmid (a gift of Walter Miller, described in Ref. 18Harikrishna J.A. Black S.M. Szklarz G.D. Miller W.L. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 371-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), 100 ng of 3β-hydroxysteroid reductase (a gift of Jerome Strauss, described in Ref. 19Zhang M. Liu P. Dwyer N.K. Christenson L.K. Fujimoto T. Martinez F. Comly M. Hanover J.A. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Strauss III, J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33300-33310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and 100 ng of FLAG-START. After transfection, cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum for 48 h. Media was withdrawn, and progesterone was assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Diagnostic Biochem Canada). For StarD4 reporter experiments, each well of NIH-3T3 cells was transfected with 200 ng of luciferase reporter and 20 ng of cytomegalovirus-β-galactosidase expression vector for normalization. After 3 h, the serum-free transfection media was replaced with 0.5 ml of experimental media; that is, control (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% lipoprotein-depleted serum), sterols (10 μg/ml cholesterol; 1 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol), or lovastatin (1 μg/ml mevinolin). After 18–20 h, cells were lysed with passive lysis buffer and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities (Promega). Luciferase relative light units were normalized to β-galactosidase units (absorbance at 420 nm), and results were expressed as this ratio. The SREx3 control luciferase reporter (a gift of Doug Thewke and Michael Sinensky) had been generated by subcloning the sterol-regulated promoter region from the pTK(Kx3) CAT reporter (20Dawson P.A. Hofmann S.L. van der Westhuyzen D.R. Sudhof T.C. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3372-3379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) into pGL2 basic (Promega). In the assays for START domain effects on LXR reporters, each well of COS-1 cells was transfected with 200 ng of LXR element (LXRE) luciferase reporter, 50 ng of β-galactosidase, 25 ng of LXR, 25 ng of retinoid X receptor, and 100 ng of FLAG-START. Cells were cultured after transfection in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum for 18–20 h before lysis. The LXRE luciferase reporter and expression plasmids for human LXRα, mouse LXRβ, and human retinoid X receptor α were gifts of Jonathan Smith and originally generated in the laboratory of Ron Evans (21Forman B.M. Ruan B. Chen J. Schroepfer Jr., G.J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10588-10593Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Other Materials—Triplicate cDNA samples from control mouse macrophages and those loaded with free cholesterol or cholesterol esters were gifts of Bo Feng and Ira Tabas, described in Feng et al. (11Feng B. Yao P.M. Li Y. Devlin C.M. Zhang D. Harding H.P. Sweeney M. Rong J.X. Kuriakose G. Fisher E.A. Marks A.R. Ron D. Tabas I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 781-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). The assay for Xbp1 splicing and the mouse Xbp1 PCR primers were as described (23Calfon M. Zeng H. Urano F. Till J.H. Hubbard S.R. Harding H.P. Clark S.G. Ron D. Nature. 2002; 415: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2115) Google Scholar). Data Analysis and Statistics—For all quantitative assays, the control and experimental groups were compared by a two-tailed type 2 Student's t test, with the threshold for significance at p < 0.05. Data were analyzed in Microsoft Excel and graphed in Prism (Graphpad). All bar graphs show the mean with S.D. error bars. StarD4 and StarD5 in Steroidogenesis—In adrenal and gonadal steroidogenic cells, StAR delivers cholesterol to the mitochondrial P450 side chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc) to generate the first steroid pregnenolone. This is converted to progesterone by 3β-hydroxysteroid reductase, and subsequent enzymatic steps generate other steroids. To assay for StAR-like activity, non-steroidogenic COS-1 cells can be transfected with P450scc and 3β-hydroxysteroid reductase to generate progesterone. As previously reported (24Watari H. Arakane F. Moog-Lutz C. Kallen C.B. Tomasetto C. Gerton G.L. Rio M.C. Baker M.E. Strauss III, J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8462-8467Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 25Bose H.S. Whittal R.M. Huang M.C. Baldwin M.A. Miller W.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11722-11731Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), co-transfection of the START domain from StAR or MLN64 results in a stimulation of steroidogenesis (Fig. 1A). Although to a lesser extent, StarD4 and StarD5 also increase progesterone production, indicating StAR-like cholesterol transfer activity. As a negative control, the phosphatidylcholine binding START protein PCTP was inactive in this assay. Western blots against the FLAG epitope tag indicate that these START domains are overexpressed to similar levels, although StarD4 expression was consistently less (Fig. 1B). In steroidogenic cells pituitary tropic hormones signal via cAMP and greatly induce StAR expression. When steroidogenic MA-10 mouse Leydig tumor cells were treated with a cAMP analog, there was a 13-fold increase in pregnenolone production (24.2 ± 1.6 to 306.3 ± 75.7 ng/ml, p < 0.01). StAR mRNA expression increased 45-fold, whereas expression of MLN64 and StarD5 was unchanged (Fig. 1C). StarD4 was induced almost 3-fold, as was the SREBP-target gene HMG CoA reductase (HMGR), likely the result of steroidogenesis depleting cellular cholesterol and causing SREBP activation. Therefore, StarD4 and StarD5 were like StAR in stimulating steroidogenesis when overexpressed in an in vitro assay, but unlike StAR, as their expression levels were not highly activated by cAMP in steroidogenic cells. SREBP Activation of StarD4 Expression—We hypothesized that StarD4 expression is cholesterol-regulated via SREBP transcription factors (2Soccio R.E. Adams R.M. Romanowski M.J. Sehayek E. Burley S.K. Breslow J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6943-6948Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Transgenic mice overexpressing transcriptionally active nuclear SREBP-1a- or SREBP-2-truncated proteins show constitutive activation of target genes (8Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (3710) Google Scholar). Gene expression in livers from these mice have previously been analyzed by Northern blots (26Amemiya-Kudo M. Shimano H. Hasty A.H. Yahagi N. Yoshikawa T. Matsuzaka T. Okazaki H. Tamura Y. Iizuka Y. Ohashi K. Osuga J. Harada K. Gotoda T. Sato R. Kimura S. Ishibashi S. Yamada N. J.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12027-12032Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar). Genes involved in cholesterol metabolism are activated by SREBP-2 and also SREBP-1a, but genes involved in fatty acid metabolism are highly regulated by SREBP-1a but not SREBP-2. Microarray analysis has shown StarD4 expression is induced 3.0–3.5-fold in SREBP-1a and 4.6–6.1-fold in SREBP-2 transgenic mice (27Horton J.D. Shah N.A. Warrington J.A. Anderson N.N. Park S.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12027-12032Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar). We used quantitative PCR to analyze expression of StarD4 and control genes in similar SREBP-1a and SREBP-2 transgenic mice compared with non-transgenic littermates (Fig. 2). The control SREBP-1 target fatty acid-binding protein 5 (FABP5) and SREBP-2 target HMG CoA synthase (HMGS) showed the expected patterns of regulation (16Maxwell K.N. Soccio R.E. Duncan E.M. Sehayek E. Breslow J.L. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 2109-2119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). StarD4 expression was induced 5-fold in SREBP-2 transgenic mice (p < 0.01) but only 2-fold in SREBP-1a transgenic mice (p = NS). This pattern is consistent with SREBP-2 regulation, so StarD4 is a preferential SREBP-2 target likely to function in cholesterol metabolism. Differences in the regulation of SREBP-1 versus SREBP-2 target genes have been reported in intact wild-type mice fed dietary cholesterol for 1 week. SREBP-2 target genes are immediately down-regulated after only 1 day of cholesterol feeding, whereas SREBP-1 targets take several days (16Maxwell K.N. Soccio R.E. Duncan E.M. Sehayek E. Breslow J.L.

https://openalex.org/W2031079874,"Mutations in the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) cause chromosome 7-linked long QT syndrome type II (LQT2). We have shown previously that LQT2 mutations lead to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention and rapid degradation of mutant hERG proteins. In this study we examined the role of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in the degradation of the LQT2 mutation Y611H. We showed that proteasome inhibitors N-acetyl-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-norleucinal and lactacystin but not lysosome inhibitor leupeptin inhibited the degradation of Y611H mutant channels. In addition, ER mannosidase I inhibitor kifunensine and down-regulation of EDEM (ER degradation-enhancing α-mannosidase-like protein) also suppressed the degradation of Y611H mutant channels. Proteasome inhibition but not mannosidase inhibition led to the accumulation of full-length hERG protein in the cytosol. The hERG protein accumulated in the cytosol was deglycosylated. Proteasome inhibition also resulted in the accumulation of polyubiquitinated hERG channels. These results suggest that the degradation of LQT2 mutant channels is mediated by the cytosolic proteasome in a process that involves man-nose trimming, polyubiquitination, and deglycosylation of mutant channels.

Long QT syndrome is a cardiac disorder characterized by prolongation of QT intervals on the electrocardiogram and a high risk of sudden death due to ventricular arrhythmias.

Cell. 1995; 80: 795-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2002) Google Scholar). hERG encodes the pore-forming subunit of the rapidly activating-delayed rectifier K+ channel (IKr) in the heart (2Sanguinetti M.C.

Science. 1995; 269: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). Studies of LQT2 mutant channels expressed heterologously in oocytes or mammalian cells have shown that LQT2 mutations cause hERG channel dysfunction by multiple mechanisms including defective protein trafficking, abnormal gating or permeation, and dominant negative suppression of wild type hERG channel function (4January C.T. Gong Q. Zhou Z. J. Cardiovasc. Electrophysiol. 2000; 11: 1413-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the LQT2 mutation Y611H is trafficking-defective (5Zhou Z. Gong Q. Epstein M.L. January C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21061-21066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). This mutant expresses only the immature form of hERG channel protein, which fails to reach the plasma membrane. The Y611H mutant protein is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and rapidly degraded. It is well recognized that newly synthesized proteins in the ER are under stringent surveillance by a quality control system (6Brodsky J.L. McCracken A.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 7Ellgaard L. Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar, 8Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar). The ER quality control system ensures that only properly folded and assembled proteins are exported from the ER to the Golgi. Misfolded and unassembled proteins are retained in the ER and eventually degraded by a process termed ER-associated degradation (ERAD). According to current models, ERAD substrates undergo retrotranslocation or dislocation from the ER to the cytosol, in which they are degraded by the proteasome (8Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar). In most cases, the degradation by the proteasome is preceded by polyubiquitination. In addition, mannose trimming by ER mannosidase I and deglycosylation by cytosolic peptide:N-glycanase (PNGase) are important processes in proteasomal degradation of glycoproteins (8Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar). Recently EDEM (ER degradation-enhancing α-mannosidase-like protein) has been shown to play a crucial role in the degradation of misfolded glycoproteins (9Molinari M. Calanca V. Galli C. Lucca P. Paganetti P. Science. 2003; 299: 1397-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 10Oda Y. Hosokawa N. Wada I. Nagata K. Science. 2003; 299: 1394-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). The importance of ERAD is underscored by the fact that proteasomal degradation of misfolded proteins has been shown in an increasing number of human diseases. The role of ERAD in the degradation of misfolded proteins has been studied extensively in cystic fibrosis and α1-antitrypsin deficiency (11Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar, 12Qu D. Teckman J.H. Omura S. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol.

Defective trafficking of mutant channels to the plasma membrane has been shown as the most common mechanism of hERG channel dysfunction in LQT2. More than 15 LQT2 mutations have been reported to cause defective trafficking of mutant channels (13Delisle B.P. Anson B.D. Rajamani S. January C.T. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 1418-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 14Gong Q. Keeney D.R. Robinson J.C. Zhou Z. J. Mol. Cell.

These LQT2 mutations lead to misfolding, ER retention, and the degradation of mutant hERG channels (5Zhou Z. Gong Q. Epstein M.L. January C.T. J. Biol.

Dennis A.T. Wang L. Brown A.M. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 87-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kagan A. Yu Z. Fishman G.I. McDonald T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11241-11248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), little is known about how mutant hERG channels are targeted to the cytosolic proteasome for degradation. In this study, we analyzed the role of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in the degradation of the LQT2 mutant Y611H. Our results suggest that the mutant hERG protein is targeted to the proteasome for degradation by dislocation from the ER membrane to the cytosol. The proteasome-dependent degradation involves man-nose trimming, ubiquitination, and deglycosylation of mutant channels. Reagents and Cell Transfection—The proteasome inhibitors lactacystin and N-acetyl-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-norleucinal (ALLN) were purchased from Kamiya Biomedical Co. (Seattle, WA) and Calbiochem, respectively. The ER mannosidase I inhibitor kifunensine was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals, Inc. (North York, Ontario, Canada). Anti-hERG antibody was raised against the hERG-thioredoxon fusion protein as described previously (5Zhou Z. Gong Q. Epstein M.L. January C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21061-21066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Anti-ubiquitin monoclonal antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anticalnexin antibody was purchased from Stressgen (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). Expre35S35S protein labeling mix was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. HEK293 cells stably expressing wild type hERG or the Y611H mutant were cultured as described previously (5Zhou Z. Gong Q. Epstein M.L. January C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21061-21066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). For down-regulation of EDEM, HEK293 cells were cotransfected with 6 μg of pcDNA3-Y611H and 10 μg of pcDNA3-siEDEM or pcDNA3-siGFP utilizing Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) (9Molinari M. Calanca V. Galli C. Lucca P. Paganetti P. Science. 2003; 299: 1397-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Western blot procedures were described previously (5Zhou Z. Gong Q. Epstein M.L. January C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21061-21066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and proteinase inhibitors. After centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, cell lysates were subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. hERG proteins were detected with anti-hERG antibody (1:10000 dilution) and visualized with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibody and ECL detection kit. Deglycosylation of hERG proteins by PNGase was performed as described previously (17Zhou Z. Gong Q. Ye B. Fan Z. Makielski J.C. Robertson G.A. January C.T. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 230-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—Cells in 35-mm plates were pulse-labeled for 1 h in methionine- and cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 110 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine and chased in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2 mm unlabeled methionine and cysteine for time intervals up to 24 h. For drug treatment, 50 μm ALLN, 20 μm lactacystin, 100 μm leupeptin, or 100 μm kifunensine was added 1 h before pulse labeling and was continuously included in the culture medium during the pulse and the chase periods. At the end of chase period, cells were lysed in 600 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and protease inhibitors (100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 μl/ml aprotinin). After centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, cell lysates were precleared by incubation with protein A-agarose beads (Pierce). hERG antiserum (1:100 dilution) was then added, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C overnight. The antigen-antibody complexes were isolated with protein A-agarose beads, subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and visualized with autoradiography. For quantitative analysis, the dried gels were exposed to a K-screen and quantified by phosphorimaging analysis using Quantity One soft ware (Bio-Rad, Molecular Imager FX). Detection of Ubiquitinated hERG Proteins—Cells were lysed in 600 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer. Cell lysates containing an equal amount of protein were immunoprecipitated with anti-hERG antibody at 1:100 dilution as described above. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to 5.5% SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were probed with monoclonal anti-ubiquitin antibody at 1:500 dilution. The membranes were also probed with anti-hERG antibody after stripping of the bound anti-ubiquitin antibodies. Subcellular Fractionation—Cells were homogenized in 600 μl of homogenization buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl. pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and proteinase inhibitors with a Dounce homogenizer. Cells metabolically labeled by [35S]methionine/cysteine were homogenized in 600 μlof homogenization buffer by freezing and thawing the cell suspension and passing it 10 times through a 25-gauge needle as described previously (18Petaja-Repo U.E. Hogue M. Laperriere A. Bhalla S. Walker P. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4416-4423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Homogenates were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min to remove unbroken cells and nuclei. The postnuclear supernatant was then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant from the 10,000 × g centrifugation was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. Membrane pellets from 10,000 × g and 100,000 × g spins were washed with homogenization buffer and solubilized in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and protease inhibitors. The supernatant from the 100,000 × g centrifugation (cytosolic fraction) was adjusted to a final concentration of 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Solubilized membranes and cytosolic fractions were analyzed by immunoprecipitation and immunoblot as described above. Equal fractions from each pellet and supernatant were analyzed. RNase Protection Assay—Twenty-four h after transfection with siRNAs, the cells were harvested and total RNA isolated using the RNeasy method (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNase protection probes were made by subcloning a 452-nucleotide cDNA fragment corresponding to 1386–1838 bp of EDEM and a 290-nucleotide cDNA fragment corresponding to 466–756 bp of actin into pCRII vector (Invitrogen). The antisense RNA probes were transcribed using a MAXIscript in vitro transcription kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) and biotin-16-UTP (Roche Applied Science). Thirty μg of total RNA or yeast tRNA were analyzed with EDEM riboprobe, and 10 μg of total RNA or yeast tRNA were analyzed by actin riboprobe using RPAII and BrightStart BioDetect kits (Ambion). Yeast tRNA was used as a control for the complete digestion of the probes by RNase. The involvement of the proteasome in the degradation of hERG channel was initially assessed by examining the effect of proteasome inhibitors ALLN and lactacystin on the steady state protein levels of wild type hERG and the LQT2 mutant Y611H. Fig. 1 shows Western blot analysis of hERG channel in HEK293 cells stably transfected with wild type hERG or Y611H. Wild type hERG expressed two protein bands, an upper band of 155 kDa and a lower band of 135 kDa, whereas the Y611H mutant expressed only the 135-kDa lower band. We have previously shown that the upper band is the fully glycosylated, mature form of the channel protein located in the plasma membrane, and the lower band is a core-glycosylated, immature form of the channel protein located in the ER (5Zhou Z. Gong Q. Epstein M.L. January C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21061-21066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Exposure to 50 μm ALLN or 20 μm lactacystin for 24 h significantly increased protein levels of the immature form without an apparent increase in the mature form of wild type hERG or Y611H. The lysosome inhibitor leupeptin had no effect on protein levels of wild type hERG or Y611H. These results strongly suggest that the proteasome is involved in the degradation of the immature form of hERG channels. To further examine the role of the proteasome in the degradation of hERG channels, we performed pulse-chase analysis. In these experiments, cells expressing wild type hERG or Y611H were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine for 1 h and chased with unlabeled methionine and cysteine for up to 24 h under control conditions or in the presence of 50 μm ALLN (Fig. 2A). Under control conditions, wild type hERG was initially synthesized as the 135-kDa immature form, which was gradually converted to the 155-kDa mature form. The kinetics of hERG channel maturation and degradation were analyzed by phosphorimaging quantification. As shown in Fig. 2B, the conversion of wild type hERG from the immature to the mature form became obvious at 2 h of chase and reached a maximum at 8 h. About 60% of the immature form was converted to the mature form. In the presence of ALLN, there was a significant increase in the amount of labeled immature form of wild type hERG. The increase in the immature form, however, did not result in an increase in the mature form during the chase. In fact, ALLN significantly reduced the efficiency of hERG channel maturation, as only about 20% of the immature form was converted to the mature form in the presence of ALLN. In pulse-chase experiments, the Y611H mutant was initially synthesized as the 135-kDa immature form and was not converted to the mature form during the chase (Fig. 2C). Rather, the mutant protein underwent progressive degradation with complete disappearance of the 135-kDa band by 24 h. Kinetic analysis shown in Fig. 2D revealed that the immature form of Y611H was degraded with an estimated half-life of 4.5 h. ALLN inhibited the degradation of the Y611H mutant channel, thereby prolonging its half-life to 12 h (Fig. 2, C and D). However, inhibition of the degradation did not cause conversion of the immature to the mature form. We also performed pulse-chase experiments to study the effects of the specific proteasome inhibitor lactacystin and the lysosome inhibitor leupeptin on the degradation of the Y611H mutant channel. In these experiments, cells expressing Y611H were labeled for 1 h and chased for 8 h under control conditions or in the presence of 10 μm lactacystin or 100 μm leupeptin. As shown in Fig. 3, lactacystin inhibited the degradation of the Y611H mutant. After 8 h of chase, 26% of the 35S-labeled hERG protein remained under control conditions, whereas in the presence of lactacystin 68% of the 35S-labeled hERG protein remained. In contrast, leupeptin had no effect on the degradation of the Y611H mutant. After 8 h of chase, 17 and 21% of the 35S-labeled hERG protein remained under control conditions and in the presence of leupeptin, respectively. Thus, these pulse-chase results are consistent with our Western blot data and suggest that the cytosolic proteasome is involved in the degradation of the Y611H mutant channel. Degradation of ERAD substrate proteins by the cytosolic proteasome implies that they must be dislocated from the ER to the cytosol. It has been reported that some membrane proteins can be dislocated from the ER to the cytosol in an intact form when proteasome activity is inhibited (18Petaja-Repo U.E. Hogue M. Laperriere A. Bhalla S. Walker P. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4416-4423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 19Bebok Z. Mazzochi C. King S.A. Hong J.S. Sorscher E.J. J.

Cell Biol. 2001; 157: 381-394Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To test whether hERG channel proteins undergo similar dislocation, we performed subcellular fractionation experiments (Fig. 4A). After removal of unbroken cells and nuclei by centrifugation at 1000 × g, postnuclear supernatant was separated into three fractions: 10,000 × g pellet (crude membranes), 100,000 × g pellet (residual microsome membranes), and 100,000 × g supernatant (cytosolic fraction) (18Petaja-Repo U.E. Hogue M. Laperriere A. Bhalla S. Walker P. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4416-4423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis showed that in the absence of ALLN, both wild type hERG and Y611H mutant proteins were recovered only from the 10,000 × g pellet membrane fraction. In the presence of ALLN, they were also present in the 100,000 × g supernatant cytosolic fraction. As a control, the ER membrane protein calnexin was shown to be present only in the 10,000 × g pellet membrane fraction. Thus, these results suggest that an intact form of hERG channel can be dislocated from the ER to the cytosol. Because ERAD substrate proteins dislocated to the cytosol have been reported to undergo deglycosylation prior to degradation by the proteasome (18Petaja-Repo U.E. Hogue M. Laperriere A. Bhalla S.

FASEB J. 2000; 14: 769-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), we examined whether the hERG protein recovered from the cytosolic fraction represents the deglycosylated form. As shown in Fig. 4B, the Y611H mutant protein recovered from the cytosolic fraction had a molecular mass of 132 kDa and was resistant to PNGase treatment. In contrast, the mutant protein recovered from membrane fraction had a molecular mass of 135 kDa and was sensitive to PNGase, with its molecular mass being reduced to 132 kDa. These results suggest that Y611H mutant protein recovered from the cytosolic fraction represents the deglycosylated form. To demonstrate that the presence of hERG channels in the cytosol is due to dislocation of those retained in the ER, rather than the failure of incorporation of newly synthesized hERG channels into the ER, we performed pulse-chase experiments followed by cell fractionation. Cells expressing the Y611H mutant were labeled for 1 h and chased for up to 24 h in the presence of 50 μm ALLN. hERG proteins were immunoprecipitated from the 10,000 × g pellet membrane fraction and the 100,000 × g supernatant cytosolic fraction. As shown in Fig. 5, nearly all 35S-labeled hERG protein was present in the membrane fraction at the end of the pulse labeling. The amount of hERG protein in the membrane fraction gradually decreased during the chase, whereas the amount of hERG protein in the cytosolic fraction gradually increased, reaching a maximum at 8 h of chase. These pulse-chase experiments strongly suggest that newly synthesized hERG channels are incorporated into the ER membrane and then dislocated from the ER into the cytosol for proteasomal degradation. The results also show that despite the presence of hERG protein in the cytosolic fraction, the majority of hERG protein was still present in the membrane fraction during the chase, indicating that the rate of dislocation from the membrane to the cytosol is reduced in the presence of proteasome inhibitors. Many ERAD substrate proteins are conjugated with poly-ubiquitin chains that serve as a signal for proteasomal degradation. To demonstrate that the hERG channel is modified by polyubiquitin chains, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-hERG antibody and then immunoblotted with anti-ubiquitin antibody. In these experiments, untransfected HEK cells and cells expressing wild type hERG or Y611H were treated with or without ALLN for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 6A, treatment of cells with ALLN resulted in the accumulation of high molecular weight ubiquitinated hERG channels in wild type hERG and in Y611H-transfected cells but not in untransfected cells. Ubiquitinated hERG channels were barely detectable in untreated cells, suggesting that ubiquitinated hERG channel protein is normally degraded by the proteasome in the absence of proteasome inhibitor. To determine the subcellular localization of the ubiquitinated hERG channels, cell fractionation experiments were carried out in which hERG channels were immunoprecipitated from membrane and cytosolic fractions of ALLN-treated cells and then immunoblotted with anti-ubiquitin antibody. As shown in Fig. 6B, ubiquitinated hERG channels were present in both membrane and cytosolic fractions. This result suggests that the ubiquitination of hERG channels starts before they are released into the cytosol. The hERG channel protein is modified by N-linked glycosylation (17Zhou Z. Gong Q. Ye B.

Physiol. 2002; 283: H77-H84Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Several studies have shown that the trimming of mannose by ER mannosidase I is required for proteasomal degradation of glycoproteins (25Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7946-7951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 26Jakob C.A. Burda P. Roth J. Aebi M. J.

Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). We examined the role of mannose trimming in the degradation of the Y611H mutant channel by using the ER mannosidase I inhibitor kifunensine. As shown in Fig. 7, cells expressing the Y611H mutant were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine for 1 h and chased with unlabeled methionine and cysteine for up to 24 h under control conditions or in the presence of 100 μm kifunensine (Fig. 7A). Similar to proteasome inhibitors, kifunensine inhibited the degradation of the Y611H mutant channel. In cell fractionation experiments, it was found that inhibition of degradation by kifunensine did not result in the accumulation of hERG channel protein in the cytosol (Fig. 7B). These results suggest that mannose trimming is an important process in the degradation of the Y611H mutant channel. Recently, it has been shown that EDEM plays an important role in proteasomal degradation of misfolded glycoproteins (9Molinari M. Calanca V. Galli C. Lucca P. Paganetti P. Science. 2003; 299: 1397-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 10Oda Y. Hosokawa N. Wada I. Nagata K. Science. 2003; 299: 1394-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). EDEM is an ER type II membrane protein homologous to α-ER mannosidase but lacking mannosidase activity. To test whether EDEM is involved in the degradation of mutant hERG channels, we used RNA-mediated interference to reduce the intracellular concentration of EDEM. In these experiments, we cotransfected the Y611H mutant with an EDEM-directed siRNA (siEDEM) or a control GFP-directed siRNA (siGFP) (9Molinari M. Calanca V. Galli C. Lucca P. Paganetti P. Science. 2003; 299: 1397-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) into HEK293 cells and performed pulse-chase analysis 24 h after transfection. A RNase protection assay revealed a decrease in EDEM mRNA in siEDEM-transfected cells (57 ± 5%) compared with siGFP control (n = 3) (Fig. 8A). Pulse-chase experiments showed that down-regulation of EDEM inhibited the degradation of the Y611H mutant channel (Fig. 8, B and C). Down-regulation of EDEM led to a prolongation of the half-life of the Y611H mutant channel from 3.2 to 9.5 h, similar to that found in ALLN-treated samples. The present experiments demonstrate that degradation of LQT2 mutant hERG channels is mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. We show that the misfolded hERG protein is targeted to the proteasome for degradation by dislocation from the ER membrane to the cytosol. The proteasome-dependent degradation involves mannose trimming, ubiquitination, and deglycosylation of mutant channels. Our pulse-chase experiments revealed important information about the kinetics of the biogenesis of the wild type hERG channel. About 60% of the core-glycosylated immature form of wild type hERG is processed to the complex-glycosylated mature form. Compared with other polytopic membrane proteins, the hERG channel has intermediate maturation efficiency. For example, the maturation efficiency of the Shaker potassium channel is near 100%, whereas less than 40% of newly synthesized wild type cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance and delta opioid receptor are processed to the mature forms, and the remaining immature forms are degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (18Petaja-Repo U.E.

Chem. 1994; 269: 25710-25718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our data also suggest that a fraction of wild type hERG protein that fails to mature is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. In the presence of proteasome inhibitors, there is an increase in the immature form of wild type hERG protein. In addition, proteasome inhibition results in the accumulation of ubiquitinated wild type hERG channels. In the case of the delta opioid receptor, proteasome inhibition leads to an increase in the cell surface expression of functional receptors (18Petaja-Repo U.E. Hogue M. Laperriere A. Bhalla S. Walker P. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4416-4423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In hERG, however, inhibition of the proteasome does not result in an increase in the mature form. Similarly, proteasome inhibition increases the immature but not the mature form of wild type cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance (11Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). Degradation of ER luminal and membrane proteins by the cytosolic proteasome requires dislocation of substrates from the ER to the cytosol. This retrograde transport is believed to occur through the Sec61p ER translocation complex (32Pilon M. Schekman R. Romisch K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4540-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 33Plemper R.K. Bohmler S. Bordallo J. Sommer T. Wolf D.H. Nature. 1997; 388: 891-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of dislocation and the link between dislocation and proteolysis by the proteasome are controversial. It has been reported that dislocation and degradation by the proteasome are tightly coupled events in several ERAD substrates, suggesting that active proteasome is required for the extraction of ERAD substrates from the ER (23Mancini R. Fagioli C. Fra A.M. Maggioni C. Sitia R. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 769-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 34Mayer T.U. Braun T. Jentsch S.

In this model, ER proteins are directly dislocated from the ER membrane into the membrane-bound proteasome for degradation. The 19 S cap ATPases may provide the driving force for the membrane extraction. However, some ERAD substrates have been reported to accumulate in the cytosol when proteasome activity is inhibited (18Petaja-Repo U.E. Hogue M. Laperriere A. Bhalla S. Walker P. Bouvier M. J. Biol.

Recently, it has been shown that the cdc48/p97·Ufd1·Npl4 complex is involved in the dislocation of ERAD substrates from the ER to the cytosol (37Jarosch E. Taxis C. Volkwein C. Bordallo J. Finley D. Wolf D.H. Sommer T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 38Ye Y. Meyer H.H. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2001; 414: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). It is proposed that the ATPase activity of cdc48/p97 is involved in extracting proteins from the ER membrane (39Tsai B. Ye Y. Rapoport T.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 246-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). In our experiments, a fraction of the hERG channel protein accumulates in the cytosol following inhibition of the proteasome. However, the fact that the rate at which the hERG channel protein accumulates in the cytosol is much slower than the rate of degradation in the absence of proteasome inhibitors indicates that the efficiency of dislocation is reduced in the presence of proteasome inhibitors. A similar reduction in dislocation efficiency by proteasome inhibitors has been reported for other ERAD substrates (18Petaja-Repo U.E. Hogue M. Laperriere A. Bhalla S. Walker P. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4416-4423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 20VanSlyke J.K. Musil L.S. J.

Thus, although proteasome activity is not obligatory for the dislocation of hERG channel, inhibition of the proteasome affects the efficiency of hERG channel dislocation. Our present results show that mannose trimming by ER mannosidase I is required for the degradation of Y611H mutant channels. We have previously shown that the hERG channel undergoes N-linked glycosylation at residue Asp-598 in the extracellular domain between transmembrane segments 5 and 6 (24Gong Q. Anderson C.L. January C.T. Zhou Z. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: H77-H84Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). N-Linked glycosylation begins with the en bloc transfer of a preassembled oligosaccharide chain, Glu3Man9GluNA2, to asparagine residues of glycoproteins in the ER (40Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3779) Google Scholar). The oligosaccharide chain is subject to the trimming of glucose and mannose residues by a number of glycosidases including glucosidases I and II and ER mannosidases I and II. Several reports have indicated the prerequisite of mannose trimming by ER mannosidase I in proteasomal degradation of glycoproteins (25Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In our experiments, the ER mannosidase I inhibitor kifunensine suppresses the degradation of Y611H mutant channels. Unlike proteasome inhibitor treatment, in which a fraction of hERG protein accumulates in the cytosol, kifunensine treatment does not result in the cytosolic accumulation of hERG protein. The results suggest that mannose trimming contributes to the initial targeting process that is upstream of the dislocation of the hERG protein in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This process may involve the interaction of the mannose-trimmed hERG channel with EDEM because down-regulation of EDEM by RNA-mediated interference suppresses the degradation of Y611H mutant channels. Our results support the proposal that EDEM functions as a lectin that recognizes the mannose-trimmed misfolded glycoproteins and promotes their degradation by the cytosolic proteasome (9Molinari M. Calanca V. Galli C. Lucca P. Paganetti P. Science. 2003; 299: 1397-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 10Oda Y. Hosokawa N. Wada I. Nagata K.

EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The present experiments show that the hERG channel is modified by ubiquitination. The requirement of ubiquitination for proteasomal degradation has been shown in many ERAD substrates (42Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6959) Google Scholar). Recent studies also suggest that attachment of polyubiquitin chains to ERAD substrates is required for their dislocation from the ER to the cytosol (43de Virgilio M. Weninger H. Ivessa N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9734-9743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 44Yu H. Kopito R.R. J. Biol.

Cell. 2001; 12: 2546-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In our experiments, ubiquitinated hERG channels were recovered from both membrane and cytosolic fractions, suggesting that ubiquitination of hERG channels starts prior to their dislocation from the ER to the cytosol. Thus, it is possible that ubiquitin modification may contribute to dislocation as well as proteasomal degradation of hERG channels. In addition to ubiquitin modification, hERG channel accumulated in the cytosol was also found to be deglycosylated. The presence of deglycosylated intermediates in the cytosol has been reported for other glycosylated ERAD substrates (18Petaja-Repo U.E. Hogue M. Laperriere A. Bhalla S. Walker P. Bouvier M. J. Biol.

FASEB J. 2000; 14: 769-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These intermediates are believed to be the result of deglycosylation of ERAD substrates by a cytoplasmic PNGase prior to their degradation by the proteasome (21Wiertz E.J. Jones T.R. Sun L. Bogyo M.

Recently, genes encoding yeast cytoplasmic PNGase PNG1 and its mouse homologue mPNG1 have been identified (46Suzuki T. Park H. Hollingsworth N.M. Sternglanz R. Lennarz W.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1039-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Both Png1p and mPng1p display N-glycanase activity toward intact glycoproteins and are believed to be responsible for the deglycosylation of ERAD substrates in the cytosol (47Park H. Suzuki T. Lennarz W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11163-11168Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic PNGase has been shown to interact with the proteasome and may play an important role in proteasome-mediated degradation of misfolded glycoproteins (48Hirsch C. Blom D. Ploegh H.L.

Defective trafficking of mutant channels to the plasma membrane has been increasingly recognized as an important mechanism of hERG channel dysfunction in LQT2. Trafficking-defective LQT2 mutations lead to misfolding, ER retention, and degradation of mutant hERG channels. Our present study suggests that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays an important role in the ER retention and degradation of LQT2 mutant channels. Because hERG belongs to a large superfamily of voltage-gated potassium channels and defective trafficking of disease-causing mutations has been reported in several voltage-gated potassium channels such as Kv1.1 and KvLQT1 (50Manganas L.N.

https://openalex.org/W2011337212,"It is known that melanophilin is a myosin Va-targeting molecule that links myosin Va and the cargo vesicles in cells. Here we found that melanophilin directly activates the actin-activated ATPase activity of myosin Va and thus its motor activity. The actin-activated ATPase activity of the melanocyte-type myosin Va having exon-F was significantly activated by melanophilin by 4-fold. Although Rab27a binds to myosin Va/melanophilin complex, it did not affect the melanophilin-induced activation of myosin Va. Deletion of the C-terminal actin binding domain and N-terminal Rab binding domain of melanophilin resulted in no change in the activation of the ATPase by melanophilin, indicating that the myosin Va binding domain (MBD) is sufficient for the activation of myosin Va. Among MBDs, the interaction of MBD-2 with exon-F of myosin Va is critical for the binding of myosin Va and melanophilin, whereas MBD-1 interacting with the globular tail of myosin Va plays a more significant role in the activation of myosin Va ATPase activity. This is the first demonstration that the binding of the cargo molecule directly activates myosin motor activity.

The present finding raises the idea that myosin motors are switched upon their binding to the cargo molecules, thus avoiding the waste of ATP consumption. Myosins are motor proteins that interact with actin filaments and convert energy from ATP hydrolysis into mechanical force. In addition to well characterized conventional, filament-forming myosin-II of muscle and non-muscle cells, a number of unconventional myosins have been discovered. The myosin superfamily is currently organized into 18 classes based upon phylogenetic sequence comparisons of the motor domain (1Reck-Peterson S.L. Provance Jr., D.W. Mooseker M.S. Mercer J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1496: 36-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 2Mermall V. Post P.L. Mooseker M.S.

Class V myosin is considered one of the oldest classes of myosin, which distributes from low eukaryotic, such as yeast, to vertebrate cells (4Berg J.S. Powell B.C. Cheney R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 780-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, there are three distinct subclasses of myosin V, named myosin Va, Vb, and Vc. Myosin Va consists of two identical heavy chains that dimerize through the formation of several parallel coiled-coil regions to form a homodimer. The N-terminal motor domain contains the ATP- and actin-binding sites, which is followed by a neck consisting of six IQ motifs with the consensus of IQXXXRGXXXR, the binding sites for CaM 1The abbreviations used are: CaM, calmodulin; Mc, melanocyte; McM5, melanocyte-type myosin Va; McM5ΔF, melanocyte-type myosin Va with exon-F deletion; ABD, actin-binding domain; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CaMKII, Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase II; DTT, dithiothreitol; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; MBD, myosin Va-binding domain; RBD, Rab27a-binding domain. and myosin light chains. The next ∼500 amino acids are predicted to form a series of coiled-coils separated by more flexible regions. The last ∼400 amino acids form a globular tail domain (5Cheney R.E. O'Shea M.K.

This globular tail domain, in conjunction with a portion of the coiled-coil region, mediates myosin Va binding to specific membrane-bound organelles such as melanosome (6Wu X. Bowers B. Wei Q. Kocher B. Hammer 3rd., J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 847-859Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Wu X.S. Rao K. Zhang H. Wang F. Sellers J.R. Matesic L.E. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Hammer 3rd, J.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Evidence has accumulated that myosin Va is a cargo-transporting motor in cells, which moves cargo molecules on actin cables to the specific destination (for review see Ref. 8Langford G.M. Traffic. 2002; 3: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Supporting this notion, it has been shown that myosin Va is a processive motor that travels on an actin filament for a long distance without dissociating from actin (9Mehta A.D. Rock R.S. Rief M.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). A critical question is how myosin Va motor activity is regulated. Recently we, and other groups, found that the ATPase activity of full-length myosin Va is well regulated by Ca2+ and a large conformational transition is accompanied with the activation (13Li X.D. Mabuchi K. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 315: 538-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 14Wang F. Thirumurugan K. Stafford W.F. Hammer 3rd, J.A. Knight P.J.

Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the truncated myosin Va, such as myosin Va HMM and S1, are constitutively active and not regulated by Ca2+ (16Trybus K.M. Krementsova E. Freyzon Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27448-27456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 17Wang F. Chen L. Arcucci O. Harvey E.V. Bowers B. Xu Y. Hammer 3rd, J.A. Sellers J.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 34766-34771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Sedimentation analysis showed that the s20,w of myosin Va undergoes a Ca2+-induced conformational transition from 14 to 11 S. Electron microscopy revealed that, in physiological ionic conditions, myosin Va shows an extended conformation in high Ca2+, whereas it forms a folded shape in the presence of EGTA, in which the tail domain was folded back toward the head-neck junction. A critical finding is that Ca2+-induced conformational transition is closely correlated to the actin-activated ATPase activity. Furthermore, we found that the motor domain of myosin Va folds back to the neck domain in Ca2+, whereas the head-neck domain is more extended in EGTA (13Li X.D. Mabuchi K. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 315: 538-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The following model was proposed based on the above findings. The binding of the tail domain to the head-neck of myosin Va inhibits the mechanoenzymatic activity of myosin Va. Upon Ca2+ binding to CaM at the neck domain, the tail domain dissociates from the head-neck, and the inhibition of the mechanoenzymatic activity of myosin Va is reversed. This raises the possibility that the tail domain not only functions as a cargo binding site, but also serves as a regulatory component of myosin Va. In other words, myosin Va may become active upon cargo binding. In the present study, we addressed this possibility by studying the effect of melanophilin binding on myosin Va motor function. Melanophilin or Slac2-a, the organelle receptor for myosin Va in mouse melanocyte, has been identified by genetic and biochemical approaches (7Wu X.S. Rao K. Zhang H. Wang F. Sellers J.R.

Myosin Va binds to melanosome by interacting with a receptor-protein complex containing Rab27a and melanophilin. The melanophilin bound to Rab27a associated with melanosome recruits myosin Va. The melanophilin binding site of myosin Va is encoded by a melanocyte (Mc)-specific exon-F and melanophilin strongly interacts with the Mc-type myosin Va containing exon-F, but weakly interacts with brain-type myosin Va lacking exon-F (23Wu X. Wang F. Rao K. Sellers J.R. Hammer 3rd, J.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1735-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Despite the intensive investigation of the interactions between myosin Va and melanophilin, as well as Rab27a, it is unknown if the interaction with melanophilin regulates the activity of myosin Va. In this study, we found that melanophilin directly stimulates the actin-activated ATPase activity of myosin Va. Materials—Restriction enzymes and modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), unless indicated otherwise. Actin was prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle acetone powder according to Spudich and Watt (24Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant CaM of Xenopus oocyte (25Chien Y.H. Dawid I.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) was expressed in Escherichia coli as described previously (26Maruta S. Ohki T. Kambara T. Ikebe M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 256: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose was purchased from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). Anti-FLAG M2 antibody, Anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel, FLAG peptide (Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys), phosphoenolpyruvate, 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine, and pyruvate kinase were from Sigma. Myosin Va Expression Vectors—Murine melanocyte-type myosin Va (McM5), was subcloned into pFastBac (Invitrogen) as described before (13Li X.D. Mabuchi K. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 315: 538-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). McM5 lacking exon-F (McM5ΔF) was constructed by overlap extension PCR technique by using PfuUltra high fidelity DNA polymerase (#600380, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and plasmid of McM5/pFastBac as a template. The 5′ fragment, which begins in 5′ of unique natural HindIII site and ends with a sequence that skips exon-F and contains the 25 bp that follow exon-F, was amplified using following 5′ and 3′ primers: CTTTGAGAAGCCCCGCATGT (M5RM-S544+) and 5′-GCTTTTCAAGTTGTTCCATCAGATCCAGGTTTTCATTGGTCAGCCGGG-3′(M5-DelF–). The 3′ fragment, which begins with a sequence containing the 21 bp preceding exon-F and then skips exon-F, and ends at the stop codon of McM5 (nucleotide of 5634; 5562 in GenBank™ accession number: X57377), was amplified using following 5′ and 3′ primers: 5′-CGGCTGACCAATGAAAACCTGGATCTGATGGAACAACTTGAAAAGCAG-3′(M5-DelF+) and 5′-ATATCTCGAGTCAGACCCGTGCGATGAAGCCCAGG-3′ (M5ARV1835–). Those two fragments were purified, mixed, and amplified using the outside primers. The resulting product was digested with HindIII and BstEII and used to replace the corresponding HindIII/BstEII fragment in McM5/pFastBac, generating McM5ΔF/pFastBac. McM5-S1650A/pFastBac was produced by mutating AGT (Ser-1675) (nucleotide 5020–5022 in McM5; nucleotide 4948–4950 (Ser-1650) in X57377) into GCT (Ala) or GAG (Glu). Note: for easy comparison with previous publications, we used the nucleotide number of X57377, which contains exon-B and -F, but lacks exon-D. The melanocyte type myosin Va contains exon-D and -F, but lacks exon-B. Melanophilin and Rab27a Expression Vectors—Murine melanocyte melanophilin (GenBank™ accession number: NM_053015) was cloned from mouse kidney by RT-PCR using following primers: 5′-GCTAGCATGGGGAGGAAGCTGGACCTGTCGGGTCTGACC and GATGGCTGTTGGGTCCAAGGCACTGTCGTGTACG, and subcloned into p21TOPO vector (Invitrogen). Full-length melanophilin cDNA was excised by NheI/XhoI digestion and subcloned into a modified pFastBac plasmid (Invitrogen), pFastBacHis6, which has a C-terminal Tag (VSAHAGT-KHHHHHH) containing a His tag. Truncation of melanophilin was produced by PCR and subcloned into pFastBacHTb (Invitrogen). All truncated melanophilin constructs contain an N-terminal tag (MSYYHHHHHHDYDIPTTENLYFQGAMGIRNSKYVDELTS) containing a His tag. Murine Rab27a (GenBank™ accession number: AB046693) was cloned from mouse brain by RT-PCR using primers 5′-CGGATCCGATGTCGGATGGAGATTACGAT and 5′-ATGCCTCGAGTCAACAGCCACACAACCCCT, and subcloned into the BamHI and XhoI sites of pFastBacHTc (Invitrogen). A constitute active form of Rab27a was produced by site-directed mutation of CAG (Glu-78) to TTG (Leu). Rab27a constructs contain an N-terminal tag (MSYYHHHHHHDYDIPTTENLYFQGAMGIR) containing a His tag. All PCR-derived subcloned fragments were sequenced to confirm that no errors had been inadvertently introduced. Expression and Purification of Myosin Va, Melanophilin, and Rab27a Constructs—Production of recombinant baculoviruses containing myosin Va heavy chains (McM5, McM5ΔF, McM5-S1650A, or McM5-S1650E), and expression and purification of recombinant myosin Va were described as previously (13Li X.D.

Commun. 2004; 315: 538-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), except the purified myosin Va samples were dialyzed against 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5 at 20 °C), 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm DTT. Similar procedures were used to produce recombinant baculoviruses containing full-length or truncated melanophilin and Rab27a. Sf9 cells, infected with recombinant baculovirus containing melanophilin, were harvested by centrifugation and washed with 4 mm EGTA in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl). Cell pellets were then lysed with sonication in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 15 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.3 m NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 0.02% NaN3, 5 mm ATP, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.2 mg/ml Trypsin inhibitor (egg), and 0.5% Triton X-100. After centrifugation at 120,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant was incubated with 1.0 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose affinity resin in a 50-ml conical tube on a rotating wheel in a cold room for 1 h. The resin suspension was then loaded on a column (1 × 10 cm) and washed with 30 ml of solution A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 15 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.3 m NaCl, 0.2 mm EGTA, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). Melanophilin bound to resin was eluted with 0.25 m imidazole in solution A. The collected melanophilin was dialyzed overnight on ice against 1 liter of 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5 at 20 °C), 0.2 m NaCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm DTT. Protein concentration of Myosin Va was determined by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 staining of SDS-PAGE (7.5–20%) using smooth muscle myosin heavy chain as a standard as described previously (13Li X.D. Mabuchi K. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 315: 538-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The concentrations of Rab27a and full-length and truncated melanophilin were measured by a Coomassie Plus Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce) using BSA as standard. The molecular masses of 66.7 kDa (full-length melanophilin), 42.6 kDa (Δ-RBD), 49.7 kDa (Δ-ABD), 35.0 kDa (MBD), 24.4 kDa (MBD-1), 22.5 kDa (MBD-2), 25.1 kDa (ABD), and 28.6 kDa (Rab27a) were used for calculation of molar concentration. Other Assays—The ATPase activity of myosin Va was measured using an ATP regeneration system at 25 °C as described before (13Li X.D. Mabuchi K. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 315: 538-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Reaction solution, except ATP, was mixed and preincubated at 25 °C for 10 min before adding ATP to start reaction. Coimmunoprecipitation of His-tagged melanophilin and FLAG-tagged McM5 was performed in the condition similar to ATPase assay. 85 nm McM5 and 255 nm melanophilin were incubated in washing solution composed of 20 mm MOPS-KOH (pH 7.0), 1 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mg/ml BSA, 1 mm DTT, 12 μm CaM, 0.2 m KCl, 1 mm EGTA (EGTA condition) or 1 mm CaCl2 and 1.031 mm EGTA (pCa5 condition) at 25 °C for 10 min. 228 μl of the above mixture was mixed with 10 μl of Anti-FLAG M2 gel, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 10 min, spun down, and washed twice with 250 μl of corresponding washing solution. After carefully removing the supernatant, 20 μl of 0.3 mm FLAG peptide in washing solution was added to the precipitation. After mixing and spinning down, supernatant was carefully removed and subjected to SDS-PAGE (7.5–20%) and melanophilin-His was detected by mouse monoclonal antibody recognizing penta-His (#344660, Qiagen Inc., Germany). Expression and Purification of Melanophilin Constructs—A full-length murine melanophilin (or slac2-a) and various truncated constructs were expressed in sf9 cells and purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose affinity chromatography and their ability to stimulate the ATPase activity of murine melanocyte-type myosin Va (McM5) was examined. As shown in Fig. 1A, melanophilin is composed of three distinct domains, i.e. Rab27a binding domain, myosin Va binding domain, and actin binding domain. We produced seven constructs of melanophilin, i.e. full-length, Δ-RBD, Δ-ABD, MBD, MBD-1, MBD-2, and ABD. To facilitate purification, a histidine tag was attached to the C terminus of the full-length or the N terminus of the truncated melanophilin. Purified melanophilin constructs are shown in Fig. 1B. The apparent molecular masses of the purified melanophilin constructs estimated by SDS-PAGE are larger than the calculated molecular mass based on their amino acid sequences. For example, the calculated molecular mass of full-length melanophilin with C-terminal His-tag is 66.7 kDa, which is much lower than the apparent molecular mass of 90 kDa. The higher apparent molecular mass may be due to post-translational modification, or the unique amino acid composition of melanophilin. A similar result has been found for mammalian cell expressed melanophilin (27Fukuda M. Kuroda T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43096-43103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 28Fukuda M. Kuroda T.S. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 583-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Melanophilin Stimulates the ATPase of Melanocyte-type Myosin Va (McM5)—To examine whether the binding of melanophilin to myosin Va affects the function of myosin Va, we measured the actin-activated ATPase of myosin Va in the presence of melanophilin. As shown in Fig. 2A, melanophilin significantly stimulated the actin-activated ATPase activity of melanocyte-type myosin Va (McM5) in the presence of EGTA. The stimulation by melanophilin follows Michaelis-Menten equation, with Vmaxof 5.39 s–1head–1 and Km of 0.15 μm melanophilin. The maximal stimulation of actin-activated ATPase activity of McM5 by melanophilin is about four times that in the absence of melanophilin (Table I). It should be mentioned that no significant ATPase activity was detected from the melanophilin sample alone. The activation was only observed for the actin-activated ATPase activity, and there was no significant activation of the basal ATPase activity of McM5 by melanophilin (not shown).Table IKm and Vmax of Melanophilin constructs-stimulated actin-activated ATPase activity of McM5VmaxKms-1head-1μmMelanophilin5.39 ± 0.250.15 ± 0.01Δ-ABD6.20 ± 1.050.28 ± 0.01MBD4.26 ± 0.331.07 ± 0.19MBD-1aThe actin-activated ATPase activity of McM5 increased linearly with the increase of MBD-1 up to 30 μm.MBD-20.81 ± 0.082.24 ± 0.70a The actin-activated ATPase activity of McM5 increased linearly with the increase of MBD-1 up to 30 μm. Open table in a new tab It has been shown that C terminus of melanophilin interacts with actin (29Kuroda T.S. Ariga H. Fukuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5245-5255Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). One possibility for the activation of myosin Va is that melanophilin increases the affinity between myosin Va and actin. Therefore, we measured the ATPase activity of McM5 as a function of actin to determine the effect of melanophilin on the apparent Kactin and Vmax of the McM5 ATPase activity. As shown in Fig. 3A and Table II, although apparent Kactin was not significantly changed, the Vmax was increased by 3-fold by melanophilin in EGTA condition. The results indicate that the activation of myosin Va by melanophilin is not due to increase in the affinity between myosin Va and actin. Contrast to EGTA condition, there is no significant change of Vmax of actin-activated ATPase of McM5 in pCa5 condition by melanophilin, although the apparent Kactin was decreased by 2-fold by melanophilin (Fig. 3B and Table II). Coimmunoprecipitation of melanophilin and McM5 showed that melanophilin binds to McM5 in both EGTA and pCa5 condition (Fig. 3C).Table IIKactin and Vmax of actin-activated ATPase activity of McM5 in the absence and presence of melanophilinEGTA conditionPCa5 conditionVmaxKactinVmaxKactins-1head-1μms-1head-1μmControl2.44 ± 0.2923.9 ± 6.320.5 ± 1.353.2 ± 16.4+ 0.5 μm melanophilin6.60 ± 0.8022.3 ± 5.519.5 ± 1.328.3 ± 5.4 Open table in a new tab Fig. 4 shows the melanophilin-induced activation of the actin-activated ATPase of McM5 as a function of ionic strength. In the absence of melanophilin, the activity increased from 0.15 to 0.4 m KCl. Previously, it was shown that myosin Va changes its conformation from a folded to an extended conformation, and this is reflected by the ATPase activity (13Li X.D. Mabuchi K. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 315: 538-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 14Wang F. Thirumurugan K. Stafford W.F. Hammer 3rd, J.A. Knight P.J. Sellers J.R. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Ca2+ and ionic strength affect the change in the conformation, and high ionic strength favors the extended active conformation (13Li X.D. Mabuchi K. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 315: 538-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 14Wang F. Thirumurugan K. Stafford W.F. Hammer 3rd, J.A. Knight P.J. Sellers J.R. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is thought that the increase in McM5 ATPase activity by ionic strength is due to the change in the conformation of McM5. Melanophilin activated the ATPase activity of McM5 at wide range of ionic conditions, but the ratio of the ATPase activity in the presence and absence of melanophilin reached the maximal at 0.2 m KCl. Similar results were found for truncated melanophilin constructs (see below). Therefore, all ATPase activity was measured in the presence of 0.2 m KCl. Domain Analysis of the Activation of McM5 ATPase Activity by Melanophilin—Melanophilin consists of three distinct domains, i.e. Rab27a binding domain (RBD) at N terminus, myosin Va binding domain (MBD) in the middle region, and actin-binding domain (ABD) at C terminus (29Kuroda T.S. Ariga H. Fukuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5245-5255Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). We produced various deletion constructs of melanophilin to determine the domain essential for the activation of myosin Va ATPase activity. As shown in Fig. 2, Δ-ABD activated the actin-activated ATPase activity of McM5 similar to wild type melanophilin, suggesting that the actin-binding domain of melanophilin is not critical for the activation of McM5. Further, truncation of RBD did not predominantly attenuate the maximum activation of the ATPase activity, although a higher concentration was required for the activation (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that MBD alone is sufficient for the activation of myosin Va. It should be mentioned that the ionic strength dependence of Δ-ABD and MBD stimulated ATPase activity is quite similar to that of the wild type, supporting that MBD contains all the binding and activating function of melanophilin to myosin Va (data not shown). It was shown previously (23Wu X. Wang F. Rao K. Sellers J.R. Hammer 3rd, J.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1735-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) that the interaction between myosin Va and melanophilin is regulated by a melanocyte (Mc)-specific alternative splicing in the tail domain of myosin Va. Melanophilin strongly interacts with the Mc-type myosin Va containing the Mc-specific exon-F but weakly interacts with brain-type myosin Va lacking exon-F. It has been shown that there are two separate myosin Va binding sites in MBD, i.e. the N terminus of MBD binds to myosin Va globular tail domain (MBD-1 site) and the C terminus of MBD binds to the exon-F region of Myosin Va (MBD-2 site) (28Fukuda M. Kuroda T.S. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 583-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To further identify the binding sites required for the activation of myosin Va, we produced two constructs containing MBD-1 and MBD-2 sites, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2, MBD-1 and MBD-2 differently stimulated the actin-activated ATPase activity of McM5. MBD-1 activated the ATPase activity of McM5 linearly correlated with the concentration of MBD-1 and could not reach saturation at 30 μm. On the other hand, MBD-2 activated the ATPase activity with Michaelis-Menten kinetics with the dissociation constant similar to that of the entire MBD (Fig. 2 and Table I). However, Vmax of MBD-2-induced activation was much lower than that of whole MBD-induced activation (Table I). These results suggest that the MBD-2 site interacting with the exon-F of myosin Va plays a predominant role in the binding between myosin Va and melanophilin. On the other hand, the interaction between myosin Va and MBD-1 site is critical to the activation of the ATPase activity. Fig. 1A summarized the effects of truncation of melanophilin on the stimulation of actin-activated ATPase of McM5. McM5 activity was markedly stimulated by low concentration (1 μm) of full-length melanophilin and truncated melanophilin having both MBD-1 and MBD-2 domains, moderately stimulated by MBD-1 and MBD-2, but not stimulated by ABD. To further assess the roles of MBD-1 and MBD-2, we examined the effects of MBD-1 and MBD-2 on the stimulation of McM5 ATPase activity by wild type melanophilin. As shown in Fig. 5, the ATPase activity of McM5 in the presence of melanophilin (0.1 μm) was further increased with MBD-1, but the activity decreased with MBD-2. It is thought that MBD-2 competed with the full-length melanophilin and decreased the activation, because MBD-2 itself did not have a strong activating function. These results support the view that MBD-1 is essential for the activation and MBD-2 is critical for the high affinity of melanophilin to McM5. To determine if the presence of exon-F in McM5 is required for the activation by melanophilin, we produced McM5ΔF, an exon-F-deleted melanocyte-type myosin Va. Similar to McM5, the ATPase activity of McM5ΔF in pCa5 is about six times that in EGTA (see Fig. 7) indicating that McM5ΔF is well regulated by Ca2+, and exon-F is not involved in the Ca2+-dependent regulation of myosin Va. On the other hand, full-length melanophilin (0.5 μm), and MBD (5 μm) only slightly stimulated the ATPase activity of McM5ΔF, indicating that the presence of exon-F is critical for full activation of myosin Va by melanophilin.Fig. 7Effects of melanophilin on the actin-activated ATPase activit"

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae two machineries are involved in this process, one of which includes the mitochondrial fusion promoting GTPase Fzo1. Although a role for the F-box protein Mdm30 in regulating the stability of Fzo1 has been proposed, the molecular basis for the regulation of the fission to fusion ratio of mitochondria remains unknown. To discern the mechanism of the regulation of mitochondrial morphology, we arrested cells at different stages of the cell cycle and examined mitochondrial morphology as well as the stability of mitochondrial fission and fusion proteins. In response to a G1 arrest evoked by the mating pheromone α factor the mitochondrial network fragmented into small pieces, which was accompanied by dramatic down-regulation of Fzo1. Mating pheromone also triggered the degradation of Fzo1 produced under the control of a constitutive promoter, and Fzo1 was stabilized upon proteasome inhibition, indicating a role for the proteasome system in the degradation of Fzo1. However, deletion of MDM30 did not stabilize Fzo1 after mating pheromone treatment, showing a different mechanism from the previously reported process of steady state Fzo1 regulation. We show an example for a regulated change of the mitochondrial fission to fusion ratio during the life cycle of budding yeast.

Proteasomal degradation of Fzo1 in response to the mating pheromone is proposed to mediate the remodeling of the mitochondrial network during the process of mating. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mitochondria consist of long tubules that are located in the cell periphery. Because of constant fission and fusion of individual mitochondria, they form a dynamic mitochondrial network. Although many proteins have an impact on mitochondrial morphology (1Dimmer K.S. Fritz S.

Cell. 2002; 13: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), six proteins seem to build up the core mitochondrial fission and fusion machinery (2Shaw J.M. Nunnari J.

Mitochondrial fusion is governed by the large outer mitochondrial membrane GTPase, Fzo1 (3Rapaport D. Brunner M. Neupert W. Westermann B. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1123-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), and the dynamin-related GTPase, Mgm1, which is located in the intermembrane space (6Wong E.D. Wagner J.A. Gorsich S.W. McCaffery J.M. Shaw J.M. Nunnari J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 341-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Deletion of either of these genes results in the loss of fusion-competent mitochondria and, because of ongoing mitochondrial fission, the mitochondria fragment into small pieces that eventually form clumped mitochondrial masses (7Jensen R.E. Hobbs A.E. Cerveny K.L. Sesaki H. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2000; 51: 573-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial fission is mediated by the large dynamin-related GTPase Dnm1 (8Otsuga D. Keegan B.R. Brisch E. Thatcher J.W. Hermann G.J. Bleazard W. Shaw J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 333-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), the adaptor protein Mdv1, and the outer mitochondrial membrane protein Fis1. Mutation of either of these fission proteins leads to highly interconnected, often net-like mitochondria. Interestingly, mutation of the fusion machinery together with the fission machinery restores the wild type mitochondrial morphology. However, this reflects a static morphology rather than the dynamic equilibrium of ongoing mitochondrial fission and fusion in wild type budding yeast.Mitochondrial morphology in budding yeast is able to adapt to nutrition status or growth phase (9Kawano S. Takano H. Kuroiwa T. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 161: 49-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Growth on respiratory substrates, such as glycerol, leads to a more elaborate mitochondrial network, probably because of an increased need for oxidative phosphorylation. Reaching the stationary growth phase causes fragmentation of mitochondria. However, the regulation of the activity of the mitochondrial fission and fusion machinery that governs these physiological morphological changes remains largely unknown.The proteins of the fission and fusion machinery are widely conserved from yeast to man. Drosophila melanogaster possesses two orthologs of the yeast mitofusin Fzo1, one of which is the founding member of the family of mitofusins, Fuzzy onions (fzo), that is involved in the generation of a specialized mitochondrion during sperm development. The other, Drosophila dmfn, seems to be a more general mitofusin and is expressed in many cell types (10Hwa J.J. Hiller M.A. Fuller M.T. Santel A. Mech. Dev. 2002; 116: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Mammals have the two mitofusins Mfn1 and Mfn2 (11Santel A. Fuller M.T. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 867-874Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), both of which are involved in maintaining mitochondrial morphology (12Chen H. Detmer S.A. Ewald A.J. Griffin E.E. Fraser S.E. Chan D.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar). Opa1 (Mgm1 in yeast), another dynamin homologue, also participates in mitochondrial fusion. To date, the mitochondrial fission machinery in mammals consists of the Dnm1 ortholog Drp1 and the Fis1 ortholog hFis1 (13Scott S.V. Cassidy-Stone A. Meeusen S.L. Nunnari J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 482-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Drp1 and Fis1 are involved not only in the fission of mitochondria but also in apoptosis (14Frank S. Gaume B.

Weinbach N. Westermann B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2303-2313Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and other proteins involved in mitochondrial fission and fusion. Unexpectedly, we found that treatment with the yeast mating factor induces the degradation of Fzo1 and the fragmentation of mitochondria independently of SCFMdm30. The stability of other components of the mitochondrial fission and fusion machinery is unaffected after activation of the pheromone signaling pathway, suggesting a new regulatory mechanism for a physiologically induced mitochondrial morphology rearrangement.MATERIALS AND METHODSYeast Procedures—Standard procedures were used for mating, transformation, sporulation, and tetrad dissection of yeast cells. All strains used were W303 (MATa ade2-1 can1-100 his3-11 leu2-3 trp1-1 ura3) background. Cells were grown at 26 °C in complex XY medium (20 g/liter bacto peptone, 10 g/liter yeast extract, 10 mm KH2PO4, 0.2 g/liter tryptophan, and 0.1 g/liter adenine) supplemented with 2% glucose. Cells containing plasmids were grown in synthetic complete medium with 2% glucose lacking the appropriate nutrient. Cells were treated with 50 ng/ml α factor (Sigma), 50 μm MG132 in 1% Me2SO (Sigma), or 15 μg/ml nocodazole in 1% Me2SO (Sigma).DNA Constructs and Genetic Manipulations—3xHA- or 13xMyc-tagged versions of Fzo1, Mdv1, Dnm1, and Fis1 were generated using the pFA-3xHA-KANmx or pFA-13xMyc-KANmx plasmids (21Longtine M.S.

Gene disruption was verified by PCR. For the generation of deletion constructs the LEU2 marker was amplified from Yiplac128 (22Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2506) Google Scholar) using 5′-CCGTTAGAATTCGAATTCACCCTATGAACATATTC-3′ and 5′-CCGTTAAAGCTTAAGCTTAACTGTGGGAATACTC-3′ and cloned EcoRI and HindIII into pBLUESCRIPT (pAN150).

To generate TEF2Myc3FZO1, FZO1 was amplified using 5′-CTAGTATCTAGAATGTCTGAAGGAAAACAACAATTC-3′ and 5′-CTAGTACTCGAGATCTAATCGATGTCTAAATTTATTTC-3′ from genomic DNA using Pfx polymerase (Invitrogen) and cloned XbaI/XhoI into pAN158, a pRS306-based vector containing the TEF2 promoter, a 3xMYC tag, and the CYC1 terminator. The FZO1 sequence was verified by sequencing.Protein Analysis—For preparation of protein lysates, cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed once with ice-cold water, resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% IGEPAL CA-630, and 1% Triton X-100), supplemented with protease inhibitor mix (Sigma), and mixed with acid-washed glass beads. The cells were broken by shaking in a mixer mill (Retsch) for 5 min. Cell debris was removed by a 3-min centrifugation at 4 °C. Protein lysates were heated to 98 °C with 2× SDS loading buffer for 5 min. Protein lysates were analyzed by Western blot using mouse monoclonal antibodies 12CA5 (Roche Applied Science) and 9E10 (Roche Applied Science), anti-porin antibody (Molecular Probes), and horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse antibodies (Amersham Biosciences).Microscopy—Cells for confocal microscopy were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde (Sigma) for 10 min, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and embedded in 0.2% agarose into German borosilicate chamber slides (Nunc). Pictures were taken using a LSM510 Meta (Zeiss) equipped with a 100× oil immersion objective. Confocal pictures were projected into one plane using LSM 5 image browser (Zeiss) and overlaid using Photoshop (Adobe).RESULTSFzo1 Is Unstable in α Factor-arrested but Not in Nocodazole-treated Cells—It was previously shown that Fzo1 stability can be regulated by the F-box protein Mdm30 (20Fritz S. Weinbach N. Westermann B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2303-2313Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). F-box proteins are substrate recruiting factors for the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex SCF (24Tyers M. Jorgensen P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 54-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), an important factor in controlling major cell cycle transitions. Cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation of SCF substrates often targets them for degradation. Because mitochondria in mammalian cells had been reported to fragment during cell division through an unknown mechanism, we examined the stability of a functional 3xHA-tagged version of Fzo1 in different cell cycle stages. The mating pheromone α factor was used to arrest cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. As shown in Fig. 1A, 5 h after treatment with α factor Fzo1 was no longer detectable, whereas Fzo1 was stable in untreated control cells.To examine the stability of Fzo1 in M phase, we arrested cells at the metaphase to anaphase transition by evoking the spindle checkpoint with the spindle poison nocodazole and compared them with cells treated with α factor. As shown in Fig. 1B, levels of Fzo1 in G1 cells were greatly diminished compared with the levels in asynchronously grown cultures. In contrast, Fzo1 levels were not influenced by nocodazole treatment. Even after a prolonged cell cycle arrest due to spindle checkpoint activation, Fzo1 levels were as high as in untreated control cells. These data indicate a mating pheromone-dependent regulation of the mitochondrial fusion machinery. The stability of Fzo1 after a long treatment with nocodazole shows that Fzo1 is not per se unstable in a prolonged cell cycle arrest.α Factor Treatment Influences Mitochondrial Morphology— Because Fzo1 disappeared after treatment with α factor we examined the mitochondrial morphology in α factor-treated cells. The mitochondria of these cells were visualized using mitochondria-targeted GFP (kindly provided by B. Westermann). Untreated control cells showed several elongated, sometimes branched, mitochondria (Fig. 2A, 0 h α factor, and B, 0 h nocodazole), often located on the periphery of the cell. In contrast, 38% of the cells treated with α factor for 2 h showed highly fragmented mitochondria (Fig. 2A). Longer incubation with α factor increased the percentage of cells with fragmented mitochondria from 49% after 4 h to 87% after 6 h. Prolonged treatment with α factor shifted the mitochondrial phenotype from fragmented, separate mitochondria to more clumped mitochondria. The mitochondrial fragmentation after treatment with α factor resembles the punctate mitochondrial phenotype in Δfzo1 cells (Fig. 2A, lower panel). As expected from the stability of Fzo1 during spindle checkpoint activation, mitochondria in nocodazole-treated cells remained tubular and interconnected (Fig. 2B), showing that a cell cycle arrest per se does not lead to mitochondrial fragmentation. Deletion of DNM1 leads to the formation of interconnected, fission-incompetent mitochondria (25Bleazard W. McCaffery J.M. King E.J. Bale S. Mozdy A. Tieu Q. Nunnari J. Shaw J.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). To examine the role of the mitochondrial fission machinery in the mating pheromone-evoked mitochondrial fragmentation, Δdnm1 cells were treated with α factor, and mitochondrial morphology was analyzed by confocal microscopy (Fig. 2C). 99% of untreated control cells showed long and tubular mitochondria, often with regions of condensed mitochondrial networks. During α factor treatment most of the cells (from 95% at 2 h to 85% at 6 h) still displayed this mitochondrial phenotype. Mitochondria were never fragmented into small round units as in wild type cells but were sometimes completely condensed without any tubules (from 5% at 2 h to 15% at 6 h). Thus, the observed mitochondrial fragmentation after pheromone treatment is mediated by the Dnm1-dependent mitochondrial fission machinery.Fig. 2Mitochondria fragment after treatment with α factor. A, exponentially growing cells of strain yAN101 (mito-GFP Δbar1) were treated with α factor for 2, 4, and 6 h or left untreated (column 0) and processed for microscopy. To compare mitochondria after treatment with α factor with mitochondria in Δfzo1 cells, exponentially growing cells of strain yAN150 (Δfzo1 mito GFP Δbar1) were fixed for microscopy. Pictures were taken and processed with LSM 5 Image Browser (Zeiss). Mitochondrial morphology in cells (n > 200) was observed by microscopy and categorized as long mitochondria or fragmented and clumped mitochondria. B, cells of strain yAN101 (mito-GFP Δbar1) in early logarithmic phase were treated with nocodazole and processed for microscopy as described in A. C, cells of strain yAN124 (Δdnm1 Δbar1 mito-GFP) were treated with α factor and analyzed by confocal microscopy as described in A. Cells containing mitochondria with tubular parts were counted as tubular, otherwise as clumped. D, logarithmic phase cells of strain yAN021 (mito-GFP Δbar1) and yAN039 (mito-GFP cdc28-4) were grown in XYD medium at 26 °C before shift to 37 °C. Cells were then processed for microscopy as described in A. wt, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Mating pheromone evokes a G1 cell cycle arrest by activating the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Far1 (26Peter M. Herskowitz I. Science. 1994; 265: 1228-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Far1 then inactivates G1 cyclin-dependent kinase activity by binding to Cdc28-cyclin complexes. To further characterize the observed mitochondrial fragmentation in G1 arrested cells, we used a strain carrying the temperature-sensitive cdc28-4 allele and analyzed the mitochondrial morphology using mito-GFP and confocal microscopy. The cdc28-4 allele allows growth at room temperature but leads to a G1 cell cycle arrest at 37 °C because of insufficient cyclin-dependent kinase activity. Mitochondrial morphology in 87% of cdc28-4 cells and in 93% of wild type control cells at room temperature was tubular (Fig. 2D). After a shift to 37 °C, 86% of the cdc28-4 cells displayed a fragmented and often clumped mitochondrial morphology, whereas only 20% of the wild type control cells showed an altered mitochondrial morphology.Mating pheromone-induced cell cycle arrest, as well as the cdc28-4-mediated cell cycle block, is characterized by low cyclin-dependent kinase activity. Nocodazole treatment on the other hand leads to a cell cycle arrest with high cyclin-dependent kinase activity. Therefore, mitochondrial fragmentation is induced selectively by two independent processes that decrease the cyclin-dependent kinase activity. Because mitochondrial morphology depends on ongoing fission and fusion, mitochondrial fragmentation shows that fission activity prevails over fusion activity. This physiological alteration of mitochondria morphology by α factor that occurs during the yeast mating process correlates with the disappearance of Fzo1.In higher eukaryotes, mitochondrial fragmentation is part of the cell death program (27Mancini M. Anderson B.O. Caldwell E. Sedghinasab M. Paty P.B. Hockenbery D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 449-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 28Karbowski M. Youle R.J. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 870-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar), and treatment with mating pheromone is a stimulus for programmed cell death in yeast (29Severin F.F. Hyman A.A. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R233-R235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). A recent study showed that mitochondrial fragmentation in yeast occurs after treatment with acetic acid and that inhibition of mitochondrial fission with a dominant negative inhibitor of Drp1 inhibits the cell death (17Fannjiang Y. Cheng W.C. Lee S.J. Qi B. Pevsner J. McCaffery J.M. Hill R.B. Basanez G. Hardwick J.M. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2785-2797Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Thus, the observed mitochondrial fragmentation after treatment with α factor may reflect the initiation of a programmed cell death pathway due to unsuccessful mating. Therefore, we treated cells of a wild type strain, a Δdnm1 strain, and a Δfis1 strain with high concentrations of α factor (100 μg/ml) for 7 h and compared the survival of these cells by spotting serial dilutions onto agar plates (data not shown). We found no difference in the survival of these three strains. Because mitochondria do not fragment in pheromone-treated Δdnm1 cells (Fig. 2C), this result indicates that the observed mitochondrial fragmentation after α factor treatment plays no cell death promoting role.Fzo1 Levels Are Down-regulated upon α Factor Treatment in a Proteasome-dependent Manner—To analyze the mechanism of Fzo1 down-regulation in response to α factor, Myc3FZO1 was expressed under the control of the constitutive TEF2 promoter (30Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Gene(Amst.). 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1571) Google Scholar). Exponentially growing TEF2-Myc3FZO1 cells were treated with α factor or left untreated. Myc3Fzo1 levels were analyzed by Western blotting. Fig. 3A shows that constitutively produced Myc3Fzo1 is unstable after treatment with α factor, whereas Myc3Fzo1 is stable in untreated control cells. This shows that Fzo1 levels after treatment with α factor are regulated in a posttranslational fashion. The mating pheromone-induced degradation of Fzo1 outweighs the ongoing constitutive expression from the unregulated TEF2 promoter.Fig. 3α Factor treatment activates proteasome-mediated degradation of Fzo1. A, early log phase cells of yAN097 (TEF2-Myc3-FZO1 Δbar1) were either treated with α factor or left untreated. Cells were harvested at the indicated time points, and protein lysates were analyzed with Western blot using anti-HA and anti-porin antibodies. B, growing cells of strain yAN027 (FZO1HA3 Δbar1 Δmdm30) were treated as described in A. C, α factor arrested cells of yAN018 (FZO1HA3 Δbar1) were treated either with 50 μm/ml proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Sigma) in Me2SO (1% final concentration) or with only Me2SO (DMSO) as a control. Cells were harvested at 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 h after treatment. Protein lysates were prepared and analyzed by Western blot using anti-HA and anti-porin antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A role for the F-box protein Mdm30 was proposed in the regulation of Fzo1 stability (20Fritz S. Weinbach N. Westermann B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2303-2313Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To address whether α factor triggers Mdm30-mediated degradation of Fzo1, we constructed a Δmdm30 strain containing a 3xHA-tagged version of Fzo1. Either Δmdm30 or wild type cells were treated for 6 h with α factor. Fzo1 levels were analyzed using Western blot. As shown in Fig. 3B, the deletion of MDM30 does not prevent the α factor-triggered decrease of Fzo1. Fzo1 protein is down-regulated in Δmdm30 cells with similar kinetics compared with wild type cells. To investigate a possible role of ubiquitin-mediated proteasome-dependent degradation of Fzo1 after α factor treatment, we used the specific proteasome inhibitor MG132 (31Kimata Y. Higashio H. Kohno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10655-10660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Treatment with MG132 greatly stabilized Fzo1 upon α factor treatment compared with control cells treated only with α factor and the solvent Me2SO (Fig. 3C). This suggests that α factor activates a proteasome-dependent degradation of Fzo1. However, degradation of Fzo1 after treatment with α factor is not prevented by the deletion of MDM30. This indicates that two mechanisms involving proteasome-dependent degradation exist for the regulation of Fzo1 stability, one functioning during steady state regulation of mitochondrial morphology and a distinct pathway activated by α factor.Impact of α Factor Treatment on Other Components of the Mitochondrial Fission and Fusion Machinery—Because treatment with α factor leads to a dramatic alteration in the balance between mitochondrial fission and fusion and greatly influences the levels of the mitofusin Fzo1, we determined whether this is reflected in the level of other mitochondrial fission or fusion proteins. To this end, we used strains producing 3xHA epitope-tagged versions of Dnm1, Ugo1, and Mgm1 (kindly provided by J. Shaw) and 13xMyc epitope-tagged versions of Fis1 and Mdv1. Cells in early logarithmic phase were treated with α factor for 6 h. At different time points cells were harvested, and protein lysates were prepared.Levels of Ugo1, Mgm1, Dnm1, and Fis1 were analyzed by Western blot using anti-HA or anti-Myc antibodies. The detection of the outer mitochondrial membrane protein porin, using anti-porin antibodies, served as a loading control. We found that the levels of the fission protein Fis1 are unaffected by trea"

Thus, the latter clearly arise from β-carotene. In the wild type, the electrochromic band shift of the slow phase (centered at 500 nm) is shifted by 6 nm to the blue compared with the fast phase (centered at 506 nm).

Light energy initiates primary electron transfer such that the oxidizing equivalent resides on P700, a heterodimer of chlorophyll a (Chl a) and its C132-epimer Chl a′ (1Kobayashi M. Watanabe T.

Whether the PsaB-side quinone as well as the PsaA-side quinone are active for electron transfer has been the subject of considerable recent debate. Optical studies have shown that the reoxidation of A1– is biphasic (t½ of 5–30 ns and 150–300 ns) (8Brettel K. Garab G. Photosynthesis: Mechanism and Effects. 1.

The same phylloquinone was proposed to participate in both phases. Joliot and Joliot (12Joliot P. Joliot A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11130-11136Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) showed, however, that the relative amplitudes of the fast and slow phases were insensitive to the membrane potential, inconsistent with the attribution of the fast phase to the formation of equilibrated state, A1–FX ⇄ A1FX–, an electrogenic electron transfer step (13Leibl W. Toupance B. Breton J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10237-10244Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). They suggested that the biphasic kinetics could come from either of the following two models: (i) a single phylloquinone molecule in two different conformational states having different A1– reoxidation rates, or (ii) two different phylloquinones, one on each side of the reaction center and oxidized by FX at different rates. The former would constitute a unidirectional pathway, and the latter would be bidirectional. The x-ray structure reveals no obvious differences between the binding pockets of the two phylloquinones nor a difference in the phylloquinone-FX edge-to-edge distances (6.8 Å).

A. 2001; 98: 4437-4442Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), using site-directed mutants of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, provided the first experimental support for the participation of both the PsaA-side and PsaB-side quinones in electron transfer to FX. Site-directed replacement of the tryptophan directly π -stacked to the PsaA-side phylloquinone with phenylalanine (PsaA-W693F) selectively slowed the slower phase of A1– reoxidation, whereas the same mutation of the corresponding tryptophan on the PsaB side (PsaB-W673F) selectively slowed the faster phase. Xu and co-workers (10Xu W. Chitnis P.R. Valieva A. van der Est A. Brettel K. Guergova-Kuras M. Pushkar Y.N. Zech S.G. Stehlik D. Shen G. Zybailov B. Golbeck J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27876-27887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), using the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, confirmed the room temperature optical results on the PsaA-W693F and the PsaB-W673F mutations, but although transient EPR studies provided experimental evidence for PsaA-side electron transfer, there was no indication of PsaB-side electron transfer. Similarly, Cohen et al. (15Cohen R.O. Shen G. Golbeck J.H. Xu W. Chitnis P.R. Valieva A.I. Van der Est A. Pushkar Y. Stehlik D. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4741-4754Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) constructed site-directed mutants in which the axial methionine ligands to chlorophylls eC-A3 and eC-B3 were changed to leucine, and they found an effect on the transient EPR signal only on the PsaA-side mutant. They concluded that electron transfer occurs primarily along the PsaA branch in cyanobacteria, although a minor fraction of electron transfer along the PsaB branch could not be excluded. Fairclough and co-workers (16Fairclough W.V. Forsyth A. Evans M.C.W. Rigby S.E.J. Purton S. Heathcote P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1606: 43-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), however, constructed a site-directed replacement with histidine of a methionine ligand to chlorophyll eC-A3 in C. reinhardtii, PsaA-M684H, that still allows photoautotrophic growth despite having blocked electron transfer to the PsaA branch phylloquinone. This observation implies that the PsaB branch is active for electron transfer and that its activity is sufficient to support photoautotrophic growth. This mutation and the corresponding PsaB-side ligand replacement, PsaB-M664H, were constructed by Fairclough et al. (16Fairclough W.V. Forsyth A. Evans M.C.W. Rigby S.E.J. Purton S. Heathcote P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1606: 43-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and by Ramesh et al. (17Ramesh V.M. Gibasiewicz K. Lin S. Bingham S.E. Webber A.N. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1369-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Both mutations block or slow electron transfer from A0– to A1 on their respective branches, implying that in C. reinhardtii both PsaA and PsaB branches are active in electron transport. All of the carotenoids in the electron density map derived from the x-ray crystal structure of PS I were modeled as β-carotene (2Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Seanger W. Krauss N. Nature. 2001; 411: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (2060) Google Scholar). Seventeen were in an all-trans configuration. Two were modeled as 9-cis; another showed a 13-cis configuration, and two were shown with 2-cis double bonds: 9,9′-di-cis and 9,13′-di-cis (for numbering, see Fig. 1 and Ref. 18Britton G. Britton G. Liaaen-Jenson S. Pfander H. Carotenoids. 1B. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel1995: 13-62Google Scholar). The carotenoids are arranged in six clusters with each cluster containing 2, 3, or 6 carotenoids. (see Fig. 9 of Ref. 3Fromme P. Jordan P. Krauss N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1507: 5-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). In cyanobacteria and in other carotenoid-producing organisms, carotenoids are synthesized from isoprenoid precursors. The first step specific for carotenoid biosynthesis is the head-to-head-condensation of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (see Fig. 1). This reaction is catalyzed by phytoene synthase and forms phytoene, a C40 carotenoid with three conjugated double bonds. Phytoene desaturase (encoded by crtP (pds)) catalyzes the double dehydrogenation of phytoene to form ζ-carotene, which possesses seven conjugated double bonds. Another enzyme, ζ-carotene desaturase (encoded by crtQ (zds)), is responsible for the dehydrogenation of ζ-carotene to form lycopene, a carotenoid with 11 conjugated double bonds. Lycopene cyclase catalyzes the formation of β-ionylidene rings at both ends of lycopene to form β-carotene, still with 11 conjugated double bonds but with the terminal double bonds being part of the rings. β-Carotene can then be hydroxylated in the rings by specific β-carotene hydroxylases to form β-cryptoxanthin, isocryptoxanthin, and/or zeaxanthin (Fig. 1). Brettel (11Brettel K. FEBS Lett. 1988; 239: 93-98Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and Joliot and Joliot (12Joliot P. Joliot A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11130-11136Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) proposed that the reduction of the PS I phylloquinone electron acceptor, A1, produces electrochromic band shifts centered at 450 and 500–510 nm of one or more nearby carotenoid molecules. According to the x-ray crystal structure, several carotenoids with different orientations and configurations and modeled as β-carotene are indeed present in the immediate vicinity of each of the two phylloquinone molecules (Fig. 2). If both branches of the electron transport chain were active, then each of the phylloquinones should show electrochromic shifts of two different sets of carotenoids, the absorption spectra of which might be slightly different. To examine this possibility, we have altered the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway to replace β-carotene with carotenoids having shorter π -conjugation, the absorbance bands of which are blue-shifted compared with β-carotene. This replacement should shift the carotenoid electrochromism to shorter wavelengths, allowing the WT carotenoid band shifts associated with A1– formation to be clearly identified. The results presented here show that associated with each of the two phases of the A1– reoxidation is the loss of electrochromic band shifts on two different sets of carotenoid molecules with different absorbance spectra. These spectral differences are consistent with the differences in configuration of the carotenoids close to phylloquinones on the PsaA and PsaB branches as seen in the x-ray crystal structure. These results therefore support a model for electron transport in PS I in which both the PsaA- and PsaB-side phylloquinones participate in electron transfer to FX. Construction of Mutants—The genes for phytoene desaturase (pds) and ζ-carotene desaturase (zds) were deleted separately in the genome of WT Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and replaced by a kanamycin resistance cassette. A PCR copy of the gene to be deleted (pds or zds) that included 500 bases upstream and downstream of the gene was ligated onto a pGEM-T plasmid vector (Promega A1360) using T4 DNA ligase and amplified in XL1-Blue Escherichia coli competent cells (Stratagene 200249). In this resulting plasmid, the first and last 50 bases of the gene together with the ligated pGEM-T plasmid vector between them were copied by PCR using primers designed to give unique restriction enzyme sites to the termini of the PCR product. The PCR product was digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes and then ligated using T4 DNA ligase to a kanamycin resistance cassette with the same sticky ends as the PCR product. This final plasmid construct was then amplified in XL1-Blue E. coli competent cells and used to transform the WT Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 strain. Transformation of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 WT strain was as described in Nixon et al. (19Nixon P.J. Trost J.T. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10859-10871Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Successful transformants were selected on Petri plates containing BG-11 medium, 5 mm glucose, 50 μg/ml kanamycin and grown in very dim light (∼0.1 μmol photons m–2 s–1) at 30 °C. Kanamycin-resistant colonies representing successful transformants were replated seven times in BG-11 plates containing 5 mm glucose and 200 μg/ml kanamycin to obtain full segregation. Deletion mutations were confirmed by extracting total pigments from the cells and analyzing for the complete absence of β-carotene by HPLC (see below). The cells were also unable to produce β-carotene under nonselective conditions (without kanamycin). PS I Preparation—WT Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 cells were grown in liquid BG-11 containing 5 mm glucose medium as described (20Rögner M. Nixon P.J. Diner B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6189-6196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Tang X.-S. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4594-4603Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 22Rippka R. Deruelles J. Waterbury J.B. Herdman M. Stanier R.Y. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1979; 111: 1-61Crossref Google Scholar). The mutants were grown in BG-11 containing 5 mm glucose in very dim light (∼0.1 μmol photons m–2 s–1). Isolation of the thylakoid membranes from these cells was performed as described previously (20Rögner M. Nixon P.J. Diner B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6189-6196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Tang X.-S. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4594-4603Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The thylakoid membranes were suspended at a concentration of 1 mg/ml chlorophyll in Buffer A (25% glycerol, 20 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm MES, pH 6.0). After addition of a one-ninth volume of 10% (w/v) n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside (β-DM) (final concentration of 1% (w/v)), the suspension was stirred for 20 min and then centrifuged at 55,000 rpm in a 70Ti rotor (Beckman-Coulter) for 30 min. The supernatant was then loaded onto an ∼500-ml weak anion exchange Toyopearl DEAE-650S (Supelco) column pre-equilibrated with Buffer B (Buffer A containing 0.03% β-DM) and washed with Buffer B containing 19 mm MgSO4. Elution of PS I complex from the column was performed by using 500 ml of Buffer B, forming an increasing salt gradient from 19 to 30 mm MgSO4. At the end of the gradient, the salt concentration was increased to 50 mm MgSO4. The eluent fractions containing PS I were pooled and concentrated in a Millipore concentrator utilizing a YM 100 Diaflo ultrafiltration membrane. The concentrated samples were then desalted by passing them through a gel filtration column (Econo-Pac 10 DG, Bio-Rad) pre-equilibrated with Buffer B. The samples were then frozen in liquid N2 and stored at –80 °C until use. Pigment Analysis—The chlorophyll content of the cells was determined by extraction with 100% methanol and using the 79.24 ml/mg extinction coefficient of Lichtenthaler (23Lichtenthaler H.K. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 148: 350-382Crossref Scopus (9261) Google Scholar) at 665 nm. For total pigment analysis, PS I complexes were extracted with a 50:50 acetone/methanol mixture under dim light. The mixture was centrifuged for 2 min (10,000 × g), and a 50-μl aliquot of the supernatant was immediately filtered (0.45 μm, Millex-LH PTFE) and injected onto a reverse phase HPLC column (Zorbax-ODS, 4.6 mm x 15 cm, Rockland Technologies) equilibrated with methanol/ethyl acetate (68:32, v/v). The separation was performed in isocratic mode using the same solvent system (24Giorgi L.B. Nixon P.J. Merry S.A.P. Joseph D.M. Durrant J.R. de las Rivas J. Barber J. Porter G. Klug D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2093-2101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min for 60 min at room temperature. The relative chlorophyll and carotenoid concentrations were determined by measuring the area of their respective peaks in the HPLC and dividing by the extinction coefficients according to Giorgi et al. (24Giorgi L.B. Nixon P.J. Merry S.A.P. Joseph D.M. Durrant J.R. de las Rivas J. Barber J. Porter G. Klug D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2093-2101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). EPR Spectroscopy—X-band (9.4 GHz) EPR studies were performed using a Bruker ECS-106 spectrometer and a standard mode resonator (ST 8615) equipped with a slotted port for light entry. Cryogenic temperatures were maintained with a liquid helium cryostat and an ITC-4 temperature controller (Oxford, UK). The microwave frequency was measured with a Hewlett-Packard 5340A frequency counter, and the magnetic field was calibrated using α, α′-diphenyl-β-picrylhydrazyl as the standard. Sample temperatures were monitored by a calibrated thermocouple located 3 mm beneath the bottom of the quartz sample tube and referenced to liquid N2. The spectra of FA–/FB– in WT and mutant PS I complexes were obtained as described previously (25Heathcote P. Moënne-Loccoz P. Rigby S.E.J. Evans M.C.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6644-6650Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Glycine buffer (1 m) was added to bring the pH to 10.0 (100 mm final concentration), and sodium dithionite was added to a final concentration of 50 mm. The sample was incubated in darkness on ice for 30 min, after which the sample was frozen in liquid N2 and the EPR spectrum was recorded at 15 K. Q-band (34 GHz) EPR studies were performed using a Bruker ER 5106 QT-W1 resonator equipped with a port for sample illumination. Cryogenic temperatures were maintained with a Bruker ER4118CV liquid nitrogen cryostat and a Bruker ER4121 temperature control unit. The microwave frequency was measured with a Bruker ER035M NMR gaussmeter. The magnetic field was calibrated with γ, γ-bisdiphenylene-β-phenylallyl complexed 1:1 with benzene, which has no detectable g anisotropy at 34 GHz. Photoaccumulation of A–– and FX– in all PS I samples was carried out as described in Ref. 26Yang F. Shen G. Schluchter W.M. Zybailov B.L. Ganago A.O. Vassiliev I.R. Bryant D.A. Golbeck J.H. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1998; 102: 8288-8299Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar. The pH of the sample was adjusted to 10.0 with glycine buffer (1 m) (final concentration of 100 mm), and sodium dithionite was added to a final concentration of 50 mm. After incubation for 20 min in the dark on ice, the sample was frozen in liquid nitrogen and placed in the microwave cavity. A pre-illumination spectrum was then recorded at 205 K. The sample was then illuminated with a 20-milliwatt He-Ne laser for 40 min at 205 K. The laser was then turned off, and the light-induced spectrum was recorded at the same temperature. The light-minus-dark difference spectrum at 205 K showed primarily A1– as signals from FX– and the other iron-sulfur clusters were only detectable at very low temperatures (less than 20 K). Optical Spectroscopy—Charge recombination kinetics from FA–/FB– to P700+ nm were measured at 435 nm in a laboratory-built flash-detection spectrophotometer similar to that originally described by Joliot et al. (27Joliot P. Béal D. Frilley B. J. Chim. Phys. Phys.-Chim. Biol. 1980; 77: 209-216Crossref Google Scholar). PS I complexes at a Chl a concentration of 14 μg/ml were suspended in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 10 μm sodium ascorbate, plus 4 μm DCPIP (or 250 μm sodium ascorbate without DCPIP), and 0.03% β-DM. Under these conditions, P700 is fully reduced, and all electron acceptors are oxidized prior to excitation (26Yang F. Shen G. Schluchter W.M. Zybailov B.L. Ganago A.O. Vassiliev I.R. Bryant D.A. Golbeck J.H. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1998; 102: 8288-8299Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Charge separation was induced by a saturating flash (30 mJ) provided by a linear flash lamp pulsed dye laser (model LFDL-3, Cynosure Inc.) using rhodamine 590 perchlorate (Exciton). The reduction of P700+ by recombination was measured at 435 nm using detecting flashes provided by an EG & G FX199U flash lamp and passed through a Jobin-Yvon HL300 monochromator. Measurements of the kinetics of A1– oxidation in the nanosecond to microsecond time scale were performed on whole cells and isolated PS I complexes in a flash-detection spectrophotometer as described previously (14Guergova-Kuras M. Boudreaux B. Joliot A. Joliot P. Redding K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4437-4442Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 28Béal D. Rappaport F. Joliot P. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1999; 70: 202-207Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Whole cells were suspended in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 20% (w/v) Ficoll, and 5 μm carbonyl cyanide (4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl)hydrazone. The PS I complexes were suspended at a concentration of 40 μg/ml under the same conditions as for charge recombination, except that the sodium ascorbate and DCPIP concentrations were 10 mm and 40 μm, respectively. Decay-associated spectra of the kinetic phases were derived from a global multiexponential fit of the kinetic components obtained at each wavelength, using the program MEXFIT (29Mueller K.-H. Plesser T. Eur. Biophys. J. 1991; 19: 231-240Google Scholar). Charge separation was induced by a 5-ns (full width at half-maximal) light pulse at 700 nm using a Nd:YAG pumped LDS 698 dye exciting ∼70% of the reaction centers. Absorbance changes were followed from 5 ns to 20 μs using detecting flashes provided by an OPO Continuum (OPO Panther, type II) from 300 to 540 nm, frequency doubled for wavelengths less than 410 nm. For detection in the UV, a fluorescent glass (Sumita Optical Glass, Lumilass-B) was used to convert the UV photons to the blue where the blocking filters perform better. Measurements of the variable fluorescence yield in whole cells were used to quantify functional PS II relative to the WT using a Joliot-type flash detection spectrophotometer as described previously (30Diner B.A. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 297: 337-360Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Cells were suspended in 50 mm HEPES/KOH (pH 7.5) at a concentration equivalent to an OD730 = 0.9 and were incubated for 10 min in the dark in 0.3 mm p-benzoquinone and 0.3 mm potassium ferricyanide prior to the start of the experiment. The cells were then incubated in the dark at room temperature in the presence of 20 μm DCMU and 20 mm NH2OH, the latter added ∼30 s before the start of the measurement. The variable fluorescence yield of PS II was then measured by detecting flashes following each of 20 saturating light flashes (18 Hz). Gene Knock-out Mutations—The crtP (pds) and crtQ (zds) genes were deleted independently in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 as described under “Materials and Methods.” The pds– and zds– mutants were difficult to select as the gene deletions caused the mutants to be acutely light-sensitive. This photosensitivity was most probably due to the inability of the carotenoids with shorter conjugated chains to quench chlorophyll triplet states, which in the presence of light and oxygen lead to the formation of toxic singlet excited O2 (1Δg) (31Siefermann-Harms D. Physiol. Plant. 1987; 69: 561-568Crossref Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Consequently, to drive genomic segregation to completion, the pds– and zds– mutants were selected on BG-11 containing 5 mm glucose plates prepared with fresh 200 μg/ml kanamycin and grown under very dim light (∼0.1 μmol photons m–2 s–1). The reduced light intensity resulted in a very low rate of cell growth. These knock-out mutations also resulted in the complete loss of the PS II reaction centers in both mutant strains, as indicated by the absence of fluorescence induction in the presence of DCMU and hydroxylamine (see “Materials and Methods”). Several failed attempts at the biochemical isolation of PS II complexes from thylakoid membranes (21Tang X.-S. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4594-4603Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) also indicated the absence of PS II. The absence of PS II is likely a consequence of the inability to assemble PS II complexes, where only phytoene or ζ-carotene is available as a replacement for β-carotene. The PS I concentration of the mutants, on a per chlorophyll basis, was close to that of the WT strain, as equivalent loading of detergent-solubilized thylakoid membranes (based on chlorophyll content) onto the DEAE column leads to similar recoveries of PS I complexes. However, the amount of"

Although the carcinogenic mechanism of cadmium is a multifactorial process, oxidative DNA damage is believed to be of prime importance. In particular, cadmium suppresses the capacity of cells to repair oxidative DNA damage. In this study, cadmium treatment led to a significant increase in γ-ray-induced 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) formation. Western blotting and semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR revealed that cadmium treatment caused a decrease in the expression level of human OGG1 (8-oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase-1; hOGG1) in human fibroblast GM00637 and HeLa S3 cells. In addition, the cadmium-mediated decrease in hOGG1 transcription was the result of decreased binding of the transcription factor Sp1 to the hOGG1 promoter. Finally, we show that an increase in the functional hOGG1 expression level could inhibit the cadmium-mediated increase in γ-ray-induced 8-oxoG accumulation as well as in γ-radiation-induced mutation frequency at the HPRT (hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase) gene locus. These results suggest that cadmium attenuates removal of γ-ray-induced 8-oxoG adducts, which in turn increases the mutation frequency, and that this effect might, at least in part, result from suppression of hOGG1 transcription via inactivation of Sp1 as a result of cadmium treatment.

Workers are exposed to cadmium through the smelting and refining of metal ores; during electroplating and welding; and during the manufacture of batteries, paints, and plastic stabilizers. On the other hand, the general population is exposed to cadmium through cigarette smoke and contaminated food, water, and air (2International Agency for Research on Cancer IARC Monogr. Eval.

Toxicol. 1998; 11: 420-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and cadmium compounds are not bacterial mutagens and are only weakly mutagenic in mammalian cells (18Dally H. Hartwig A. Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 1021-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 19Rossman T.G. Roy N.K. Lin W. Nordberg G.F. Alessio L. Herber R.F.M. Toxicity and Carcinogenicity: Cadmium in Human Environment. International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyons, France1992: 367-375Google Scholar). Therefore, cadmium-induced DNA lesions may be indirectly caused by cadmium, e.g. via inhibition of oxidative DNA repair systems. ROS have a variety of ill effects on DNA, including oxidized bases, abasic (apurinic/apyrimidinic) sites, strand breaks, and DNA-protein cross-links (20Wiseman H. Halliwell B. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1974) Google Scholar). Among the oxidative lesions, 8-oxoG is one of the major base lesions formed after oxidative attack on the DNA (21Cadet J. Berger M. Douki T. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 131: 1-87PubMed Google Scholar). Relatively large quantities of 8-oxoG are produced in mammalian cells either as a byproduct of normal oxidative metabolism or as a result of exogenous sources of ROS, such as ionizing radiation, single oxygen sensitizer dyes, and redox-active organic molecules (22Wood M.L. Dizdaroglu M. Gajewski E. Essigmann J.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7024-7032Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). To prevent the mutagenic effect of 8-oxoG, the bacterium Escherichia coli contains a “GO system” (23Tchou J. Grollman A.P. Mutat. Res. 1993; 299: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The bacterial GO system consists of three proteins: MutM (also known as Fpg protein), a DNA glycosylase/lyase that recognizes 8-oxoG:C and catalyzes the excision of 8-oxoG (24Boiteux S. O'Connor T.R. Laval J. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3177-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 25Tchou J. Kasai H. Shibutani S. Chung M-H. Laval J. Grollman A.P. Nishimura S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4690-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar); MutY, a DNA glycosylase that recognizes 8-oxoG:A and catalyzes the excision of A (26Michaels M.L. Pham L. Nghiem Y. Cruz C. Miller J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3841-3845Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar); and MutT, a specific phosphatase that cleaves 8-oxo-dGTP (27Maki H. Sekiguchi M. Nature. 1992; 355: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, OGG1 (8-oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase-1), which is structurally unrelated but functionally similar to Fpg (formamidopyrimidine glycosylase) in E. coli (28Radicella J.P. Dherin C.

S. A. 1997; 94: 7429-7434Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), is the main defense enzyme against the mutagenic effects of 8-oxoG in the cellular DNA. Inactivation of the OGG1 gene in yeast and mice leads to an increase in mutation frequency in the cells (31Thomas D. Scot A.D. Barbey R. Padula M. Boiteux S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 254: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 32Klungland A. Rosewell I. Hollenbach S. Larsen E. Daly G. Epe B. Seeberg E. Lindahl T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13300-13305Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). The human OGG1 (hOGG1) gene is found on chromosome 3p26.2, and allelic deletions in this region frequently occur in a variety of human cancers (33Naylor S.L. Johnson B.E. Minna J.D. Sakaguchi A.Y. Nature. 1987; 329: 451-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). In addition, the hOGG1 gene is somatically mutated in some cancer cells and is highly polymorphic among human population groups (34Chevillard S. Radicella J.P. Levalois C. Lebeau J. Poupon M.F. Oudard S. Dutrillaux B. Boiteux S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3083-3086Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 35Blons H. Radicella J.P. Laccourreye O. Brasnu D. Beaune P. Boiteux S. Laurent-Puig P. Mol. Carcinog. 1999; 26: 254-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Recently, several groups have demonstrated that cadmium suppresses the capacity of cells to repair oxidative DNA damage (36Hartwig A. Toxicol. Lett. 1998; 102-103: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 37Fatur T. Lah T.T. Filipic M. Mutat. Res. 2003; 529: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Moreover, Potts et al. (38Potts R.J. Watkin R.D. Hart B.A. Toxicology. 2003; 184: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) have clearly shown that cadmium inhibits oxidative DNA repair by the down-regulation of OGG1 in rat lung epithelial cells and that this down-regulation of OGG1 is related to cadmium-mediated decreases in OGG1 mRNA. Therefore, there has been considerable interest in determining whether this phenomenon also occurs in human cells and, if so, which transcription factor mediates the down-regulated OGG1 expression in cadmium-treated cells. However, up to now, the mechanism by which cadmium causes these effects has not been known. The hOGG1 promoter region was recently cloned (39Dhenaut A. Boiteux S. Radicella J.P. Mutat. Res. 2000; 461: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and sequence analysis of the promoter region revealed two CpG islands and no TATA or CAAT boxes, suggesting that the hOGG1 gene is essentially a housekeeping gene, which is believed to be expressed in a constitutive way. However, the activity of the housekeeping gene can be modulated under certain conditions, such as oxidative stress (40Kletzien R.F. Harris P.K. Foellmi L.A. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). In human tissues, the level of OGG1 expression is much higher in the thymus, testis, kidney, intestine, brain, cerebrum, and germinal center of B cells than in other tissues (28Radicella J.P. Dherin C. Desmaze C. Fox M.S. Boiteux S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8010-8015Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 42Kuo F.C. Sklar J. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1547-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 43Nishioka K. Ohtsubo T. Oda H. Fujiwara T. Kang D. Sugimachi K. Nakabeppu Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1637-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Moreover, a specific increase in the 8-oxoG incision activity occurs in the mitochondria with age (44Souza-Pinto N.C. Croteau D.L. Hudson E.K. Hansford R.G. Bohr V.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1935-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), suggesting that OGG1 expression may be modulated by a variety of stimuli. The presence of an Nrf2-binding site, which contributes to regulating the antioxidant responses and coordinating induction of the genes coding the detoxifying enzymes (45Venugopal R. Jaiswal A.K. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3145-3156Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar), within the hOGG1 promoter region suggests that hOGG1 expression is modulated by oxidative stress. In support of this hypothesis, several groups have demonstrated that hOGG1 is inducible by ROS at the mRNA level in several experimental systems. For example, diesel exhaust particles, an environmental pollutant, are known to generate ROS and to induce lung cancer in experimental animals. Treatment of rats with diesel exhaust particles results in dose- and time-dependent changes in the levels of 8-oxoG as well as induction of hOGG1 mRNA (46Tsurudome Y. Hirano T. Yamato H. Tanaka I. Sagai M. Hirano H. Nagata N. Itoh H. Kasai H. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 1573-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In addition, hOGG1 gene expression levels are elevated after rats are exposed to crocidolite asbestos, which is associated with epithelial cell injury in the process of carcinogenesis via oxidative stress (47Kim H.N. Morimoto Y. Tsuda T. Ootsuyama Y. Hirohashi M. Hirano T. Tanaka I. Lim Y. Yun I.G. Kasai H. Carcinogenesis. 2001; 22: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Moreover, the DNA-alkylating agent methyl methanesulfate can up-regulate hOGG1 expression through induction of the transcription factor NF-YA (48Lee M.R. Kim S-H. Cho H.J. Lee K.Y. Moon A.R. Jeong H.G. Lee J.S. Hyun J.-W. Chung M.-H. You H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9857-9866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Therefore, the activity of certain transcription factors can be important to regulation of hOGG1 expression under some circumstances. It has been proposed that zinc finger transcription factors, such as Sp1 (specificity protein-1), may be targets for the toxic action of cadmium and other heavy metals (49Hartwig A. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2001; 3: 625-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Sp1 is a zinc finger transcription factor known to play a role in eukaryotic gene expression (50Kadonaga J.T. Jones K.A. Tjian R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 20-23Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (878) Google Scholar, 51Mortensen E.R. Marks P.A. Shiotani A. Merchant J.L. J. Biol.

Biol. 1992; 12: 3998-4006Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that cadmium significantly suppresses Sp1 DNA binding activity (53Gong P. Ogra Y. Koizumi S. Ind. Health. 2000; 38: 224-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 54Zawia N.H. Crumpton T. Brydie M. Reddy G.R. Razmiafshari M. Neurotoxicology. 2000; 21: 1069-1080PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, Sp1 DNA binding activity is negatively regulated by phosphorylation in cadmium-exposed alveolar epithelial cells (55Watkin R.D. Nawrot T. Potts R.J. Hart B.A. Toxicology. 2003; 184: 157-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we investigated whether cadmium indeed down-regulates hOGG1 mRNA in human cells and whether cadmium-induced modulation of Sp1 transcriptional activity is responsible for suppression of hOGG1 expression in human cells. We used semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR and Western blotting to measure the alterations in hOGG1 mRNA and protein in human fibroblast GM00637 cells and human cervix cancer HeLa S3 cells exposed to cadmium, respectively. We then examined the effect of cadmium on the putative Sp1-binding sites of the hOGG1 promoter by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). The level of 8-oxoG accumulation was determined by HPLC using an electrochemical detector, and mutation frequency was determined by measuring the mutation frequency at the HPRT (hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase) gene locus. Our results confirm that cadmium suppresses the mRNA and protein expression of OGG1. Subsequent experiments focused on elucidating the mechanisms responsible for this suppression of OGG1 expression. We found that the decreased Sp1 transcriptional activity as a result of cadmium treatment had a profound negative impact on hOGG1 transcription. Finally, we found that suppression of OGG1 expression by cadmium led to increased accumulation of 8-oxoG and that this increased the frequency of mutations caused by γ-irradiation. Chemicals—Cell culture media, fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin were purchased from Invitrogen. Chloroform and isopropyl alcohol were purchased from Calbiochem. All other chemicals were supplied by Sigma. Cell Line Maintenance—Human fibroblast GM00637 cells (Coriell Institute for Medical Research) were maintained in Earle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Human cervix cancer HeLa S3 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. All cells were maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Drosophila SL2 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in Grace's insect cell culture medium at 25 °C. Preparation of Constructs and Transfection—The constructs of hOGG1 and the hOGG1 promoter (p(-700)hogg1luc) are described elsewhere (48Lee M.R. Kim S-H. Cho H.J. Lee K.Y. Moon A.R. Jeong H.G. Lee J.S. Hyun J.-W. Chung M.-H. You H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9857-9866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The Drosophila Sp1 expression vector pPac-Sp1 and the empty vector pPac were kindly provided by Dr. Robert Tjian (University of California, Berkeley, CA). The luciferase reporter construct containing Sp1-responsive elements (Sp1-luciferase) was kindly provided by Dr. Toshiyuki Sakai (Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan). To create stable hOGG1-expressing cells, GM00637 and HeLa S3 cells were transfected with the hOGG1 expression vectors using the Lipofectamine method (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After transfection, the cells were incubated with complete medium containing 400 μg/ml G418 for 5 weeks. The cell clones resistant to G418 were isolated and analyzed. For Drosophila SL2 cells, transfection was carried out by calcium phosphate precipitation (Promega Corp.). Briefly, 1 × 106 cells were plated 24 h before transfection, and the complexes were incubated with the cells for 4-6 h. The pPac plasmid was used as a negative control for Sp1, and either pPac or pCMV was added to equalize the amount of DNA transfected in each well whenever necessary. Luciferase Activity Assay—The luciferase activity after reporter gene transfection was determined as described previously (48Lee M.R. Kim S-H. Cho H.J. Lee K.Y. Moon A.R. Jeong H.G. Lee J.S. Hyun J.-W. Chung M.-H. You H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9857-9866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reporter plasmids were transiently transfected into cells using the Lipofectamine method (Promega Corp.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfection efficiency was determined using the Renilla luciferase gene-containing pRL-CMV plasmid (Promega Corp.). HCT116 cells were transiently transfected with the reporter plasmid and then treated with 0-10 μm CdCl2. 24 h after treatment, the transfected cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in passive lysis buffer (Promega Corp.) with gentle shaking at room temperature for 20 min. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 2 min to pellet the cell debris. The supernatants were transferred to a fresh tube, and the dual-luciferase activity in the cell extracts was determined according Promega Corp. Briefly, each assay mixture contained 2 μl of cell lysate and 10 μl of firefly luciferase-measuring buffer (LAR II®, Promega Corp.). The firefly luciferase activity was measured using a luminometer (programmed to perform a 2-s pre-measurement delay, followed by a 10-s measurement period for each reporter assay). After measuring the firefly luciferase activity (Stop & Glo®, Promega Corp.), Renilla luciferase-measuring buffer was added, and the Renilla luciferase activity was measured. Each transfection was performed in duplicate, and all were repeated at least three times. Treatment of Cultures—The cells were seeded into 100-mm diameter tissue culture dishes and allowed to attach for a period of 16-24 h at 37 °C. The cells were treated with different concentrations of CdCl2 (Sigma) for 24 h to determine the CdCl2-induced cytotoxicity and the increase in the accumulation of 8-oxoG in the DNA by CdCl2. In γ-irradiation studies, the cells were preincubated with 10 μm CdCl2 for 20 h and irradiated either with 10-50-gray (Gy) γ-rays (for 8-oxoG assay) or with 0.5-5-Gy γ-rays (for clonogenic cell survival assay) using a γ-cell irradiator (Clonac 600C, Linac Systems, LLC) at a dose rate of 0.96 Gy/min. The control cells were subjected to a similar treatment, but without CdCl2. Cytotoxicity Assay—The extent of cell death was assayed by trypan blue exclusion. Cell viability was determined as the percentage of the total cell number that remained unstained. Clonogenic Cell Survival Assay—Cells were seeded at 4 × 105/25-cm culture flask and incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The cells were preincubated without or with 10 μm CdCl2 for 20 h and irradiated with 0.5-5-Gy γ-rays. Cells were then treated with cisplatin or UVC light, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, trypsinized, and resuspended in fresh medium. They were counted with a Coulter counter, and the number of cells required for plating was obtained by successive dilutions in fresh complete medium. The cells were plated in triplicate in 100-mm Petri dishes over a homogeneous feeder layer formed 24 h previously by plating 5 × 104 irradiated cells. Cells were then allowed to grow at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere for 14 days. Fresh medium was added on day 7. On day 14, cultures were fixed with methanol and stained with Giemsa. The number of colonies exceeding 50 cells was counted with a binocular lens. The survival fraction was determined as the ratio of the number of colonies observed after treatment to the number of cells seeded, adjusted to the plating efficiency. Western Blotting—The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed at 0 °C for 30 min in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 2 mm EGTA, 50 mm glycerol phosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μ/ml aprotinin, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 5 mm NaF. The protein content was measured using a Bio-Rad dye binding microassay, and 20 μg of protein/lane was electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels after boiling for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer. The proteins were blotted onto Hybond ECL membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Markers (Fermentas) were used as the size standards. After electroblotting, the membranes were blocked with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 containing 5% milk and incubated with anti-hOGG1, anti-Sp1, and anti-α-tubulin antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) diluted in blocking buffer for 4 h. The primary antibody dilutions were those recommended by the manufacturer. The membranes were washed, incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies (1:4000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) in blocking buffer for 2 h, and washed repeatedly. The blotted proteins were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (iNtRON Biotech, Seoul, Korea). Semiquantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—RNA extraction was carried out using RNA STAT-60™ (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, after homogenizing the cells in RNA STAT-60, the homogenate was mixed with chloroform (5:1, v/v), shaken vigorously for 15 s, and then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The RNA in the upper colorless aqueous phase was precipitated by adding isopropyl alcohol, washed twice with 70% ethanol, and air-dried for 10 min. The RNA was then resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. 10-μl RNA aliquots were prepared and stored at -70 °C until needed. 2 μg of the total RNA was reverse-transcribed using a Moloney murine leukemia virus cDNA synthesis system (Promega Corp.), and the reverse-transcribed DNA was subjected to PCR. The profile of the replication cycles was as follows: denaturation at 94 °C for 50 s, annealing at 58 °C for 50 s, and polymerization at 72 °C for 1 min. In each reaction, the same amount of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as an internal control. The primers used for PCR were as follows: hOGG1, 5′-CTG CCT TCT GGA CAA TCT TT-3′ (forward) and 5′-TAG CCC GCC CTG TTC TTC-3′ (reverse; designed to amplify a 551-bp region); and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-CCA TGG AGA AGG CTG GGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CAA AGT TGT CAT GGA TGA CC-3′ (reverse; designed to amplify a 194-bp region) (total number of cycles = 26). The PCR products were resolved on 1% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide, and then photographed. EMSA—The nuclear protein was extracted from the GM00637 and HeLa S3 cells as described previously (48Lee M.R. Kim S-H. Cho H.J. Lee K.Y. Moon A.R. Jeong H.G. Lee J.S. Hyun J.-W. Chung M.-H. You H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9857-9866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and pelleted at 4 °C for 5 min at 2500 rpm. The upper supernatant was carefully removed, and the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold cell lysis buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm aprotinin, and 1 mm leupeptin. The suspension was incubated on ice for 15 min with occasional mixing by inversion. Subsequently, 24 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 was added; the cells were mixed by inversion; and the nuclei were immediately pelleted at 4 °C for 5 min at 3000 rpm. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet containing the nuclei was resuspended by adding dropwise 50 μl of ice-cold nuclear extraction buffer containing 30 mm HEPES, 0.3 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm aprotinin, 1 mm leupeptin, and 450 mm KCl. The mixture was then incubated on ice for 30 min, and the nuclear debris were pelleted at 15,000 rpm for 20 min. The protein concentration of the nuclear extracts was determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The nuclear extracts were stored at -70 °C until needed. EMSA binding reactions were incubated for 20 min at room temperature in a 20-μl final volume containing 5 μg of nuclear extract, 20 fmol of end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences). The binding buffer contained 30 mm HEPES, 0.3 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm aprotinin, and 1 mm leupeptin. Supershift assays were performed by adding 1 μl of anti-Sp1 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). The complexes were resolved on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA by electrophoresis at 200 V for 1 h. The gels were dried and exposed overnight at -70 °C to Eastman Kodak x-ray film. Small Interfering RNAs (siRNAs)—The sequences of the 21-nucleotide sense and antisense RNAs were as follows: Sp1 siRNA, 5′-GAUCACUCCAUGGAUGAAAUU-3′ (sense) and 5′-UUUCAUCCAUGGAGUGAUCUU-3′ (antisense) for the Sp1 gene (nucleotides 11-32 from the start codon); hOGG1 siRNA1, 5′-GUAUGGACACUGACUCAGUAUU-3′ (sense) and 5′-UCUGAGUCAGUGUCCAUACUU-3′ (antisense) for the hOGG1 gene (nucleotides 185-206); hOGG1 siRNA2, 5′-GUACUUCCAGCUAGAUGUUUU-3′ (sense) and 5′-AACAUC"
https://openalex.org/W2048543680,"Maspin is a serpin that acts as a tumor suppressor in a range of human cancers, including tumors of the breast and lung. Maspin is crucial for development, because homozygous loss of the gene is lethal; however, the precise physiological role of the molecule is unclear. To gain insight into the function of human maspin, we have determined its crystal structure in two similar, but non-isomorphous crystal forms, to 2.1- and 2.8-Å resolution, respectively. The structure reveals that maspin adopts the native serpin fold in which the reactive center loop is expelled fully from the A β-sheet, makes minimal contacts with the core of the molecule, and exhibits a high degree of flexibility. A buried salt bridge unique to maspin orthologues causes an unusual bulge in the region around the D and E α-helices, an area of the molecule demonstrated in other serpins to be important for cofactor recognition. Strikingly, the structural data reveal that maspin is able to undergo conformational change in and around the G α-helix, switching between an open and a closed form. This change dictates the electrostatic character of a putative cofactor binding surface and highlights this region as a likely determinant of maspin function. The high resolution crystal structure of maspin provides a detailed molecular framework to elucidate the mechanism of function of this important tumor suppressor.

Maspin (mammary serine proteinase inhibitor (SERPINB5)) was initially identified as a tumor-suppressing serpin down-regulated in invasive mammary carcinoma cell lines (1Zou Z. Anisowicz A.

Maspin loss in numerous cancers (including breast, prostate, squamous cell carcinoma, gastric cancer, and lung) correlates with metastasis and a poor clinical prognosis (for a review, see Ref. 2Zhang M.

In contrast, high levels of maspin expression in certain cancers (in particular, pancreatic and ovarian cancer) correlate with tumor invasion and poor survival. Like other clade B serpins (3Silverman G.A. Bird P.I. Carrell R.W. Church F.C. Coughlin P.B. Gettins P.G. Irving J.A. Lomas D.A. Luke C.J. Moyer R.W. Pemberton P.A. Remold-O'Donnell E. Salvesen G.S.

The intracellular role of maspin is at present unclear, but it has been suggested to play a role in apoptosis pathways (6Jiang N. Meng Y. Zhang S. Mensah-Osman E. Sheng S. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4089-4098Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). A large body of evidence suggests that maspin has an important extracellular role: it can suppress tumor growth and metastasis in vivo and tumor cell motility and invasion in vitro (1Zou Z.

Maspin also plays a fundamental role in early embryonic development; murine knock-out studies reveal that it is essential for proper organization of the epiblast (9Gao F. Shi H.Y. Daughty C. Cella N. Zhang M. Development. 2004; 131: 1479-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Consistent with a complex role in tumorigenesis, maspin also exhibits anti-angiogenic activity (10Zhang M. Volpert O. Shi Y.H. Bouck N. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), and expression of the maspin gene has been demonstrated to be under the control of the oncogenic transcription factors p53 and p63 (11Zou Z.

Han J. Kim J. Park C. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 6900-6905Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Because the failure to properly control proteolytic activity can result in disruption of the basement membrane and promote tumor invasion, it was initially hypothesized that maspin may exert its anti-metastatic effect by functioning as a pericellular protease inhibitor (1Zou Z. Anisowicz A. Hendrix M.J. Thor A. Neveu M. Sheng S. Rafidi K. Seftor E. Sager R. Science. 1994; 263: 526-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar).Serpins are unusual molecules that fold into a metastable native state. The majority of serpins function to inhibit either serine or cysteine proteases; however, non-inhibitory members of the family have also been identified, including the avian serpin ovalbumin and the human angiogenesis inhibitor pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) 1The abbreviations used are: PEDF, pigment epithelium-derived factor; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; RCL, reactive center loop; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; PAI-2, plasminogen activator inhibitor-2. 1The abbreviations used are: PEDF, pigment epithelium-derived factor; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; RCL, reactive center loop; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; PAI-2, plasminogen activator inhibitor-2.

Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1845-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). All known inhibitory serpins inactivate target proteases via a major conformational change termed the stressed (S) to relaxed (R) transition. During this rearrangement, the region responsible for docking with the protease (the reactive center loop (RCL)) is cleaved and inserts into the center of a large β-sheet (the A β-sheet), forming an extra β-strand. This conformational rearrangement is responsible for the translocation and trapping of the target protease (15Huntington J.A. Read R.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). Mutations within the RCL that interfere with the S to R transition (for example, within the conserved hinge region) abolish or seriously compromise inhibitory activity. Consistent with these data, serpins (such as ovalbumin and PEDF) that do not function as protease inhibitors have non-conserved hinge regions and lack the ability to undergo the S to R transition under physiological conditions (16Stein P.E. Tewkesbury D.A. Carrell R.W. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).Biochemical and biophysical studies reveal that maspin does not undergo the S to R transition and is thus unable to inactivate proteases in a classic serpin-like fashion (17Pemberton P.A. Wong D.T. Gibson H.L. Kiefer M.C. Fitzpatrick P.A. Sager R. Barr P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15832-15837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Nor does the RCL of maspin contain the consensus hinge region motif present in inhibitory serpins (18Hopkins P.C. Whisstock J. Science. 1994; 265: 1893-1894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Hopkins P.C. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15872-15879Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that maspin may control the urokinase-type plasminogen activator and/or tissue-type plasminogen activator; however, recent studies do not support this view (8Ngamkitidechakul C. Warejcka D.J. Burke J.M. O'Brien W.J. Twining S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31796-31806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 20Bass R. Fernandez A.M. Ellis V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46845-46848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, the RCL of maspin is clearly important for function: studies using synthetic maspin RCL peptides as well as maspin/ovalbumin chimeras reveal that this region is important for promoting cell adhesion (8Ngamkitidechakul C. Warejcka D.J. Burke J.M. O'Brien W.J. Twining S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31796-31806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 21Blacque O.E. Worrall D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10783-10788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that maspin is a non-inhibitory serpin that functions to suppress angiogenesis and metastasis through an as yet uncharacterized protein-protein or protein-ligand interaction.The role of maspin in tumor progression, angiogenesis, and embryogenesis is of great interest, but many aspects of maspin biology, such as the underlying biochemical reasons behind the apparently conflicting role of maspin in different cancers, remain to be understood. To begin to understand maspin at the molecular level we have determined two crystal structures of this important human tumor suppressor, at 2.1- and 2.8-Å resolution. Recently a 3.1-Å crystal structure of a maspin mutant lacking cysteine residues has been reported (22Al-Ayyoubi M. Gettins P.G. Volz K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55540-55544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar); however, the low resolution of this structure places a limit on structural interpretation. High resolution structures of the wild-type protein reveal that maspin is capable of undergoing conformational change in and around the G-helix, a region of the serpin scaffold previously understood to be conformationally inert. In particular, structural changes in this region result in a major reorganization of charged residues and the manifestation of a large negatively charged patch centered on the G-helix. We suggest that this region represents a cofactor binding site under conformational control.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Expression and Purification—The pRSETc/maspin plasmid (21Blacque O.E. Worrall D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10783-10788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) was modified by restriction enzyme digest, using NdeI and EcoRI to excise the translated codons upstream of the maspin cDNA and replace them with the following oligonucleotides after annealing: 5′-tatgcggggttctcatcatcatcatcatcatgaaaacctgtattttcagggccag and 5′-aattctggccctgaaaatacaggttttcatgatgatgatgatgatgagaaccccgca.The resulting plasmid, pHisTev/maspin, encodes an N-terminal hexahistidine tag linked to the maspin cDNA via a tobacco etch virus protease recognition site. Maspin was expressed in Escherichia coli and purifed using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose as described previously (Qiagen) (21Blacque O.E. Worrall D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10783-10788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), except that the N-terminal hexahistidine tag on the recombinant maspin was removed using tobacco etch virus protease as described (23Kapust R.B. Tozser J. Fox J.D. Anderson D.E. Cherry S. Copeland T.D. Waugh D.S. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 993-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar) and the tag-less maspin protein was further purified by gel filtration using Superdex 200 (Amersham Biosciences). Recombinant maspin was routinely stored in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and this material was used throughout the course of the work. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Voyager-DE STR BioSpectrometry Workstation, Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA) revealed that the molecular mass of the purified product was 42.92 kDa, compared with a theoretical molecular mass of 42.53 kDa. Because β-mercaptoethanol was used in all buffers throughout the purification and crystallization steps, the molecular weight discrepancy corresponds to approximately five cysteine residues derivatized with β-mercaptoethanol. The derivation of cysteine residues is consistent with the high resolution crystal structures, which show three and six derivatized cysteines for each of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit.Maspin Cleavage by Cathepsin L—Recombinant maspin (18 μm) was treated with 0.25 μm recombinant human cathepsin L (24Carmona E. Dufour E. Plouffe C. Takebe S. Mason P. Mort J.S. Menard R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8149-8157Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) at 37 °C for 30 min in 0.1 m NaAc, pH 5.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Brij-35, 10 mm cysteine. Complete cleavage within the RCL was confirmed by SDS-PAGE, and the molecular masses of the cleaved products were found to be 38.24 and 4.707 kDa by mass spectrometry. Based on these data (and the observation that the only cysteine residue in the C-terminal peptide is buried and unmodified in all crystal structures) the position of the cleavage site was mapped to P5/P6 (SIE↓VPG).Spectroscopic Methods—Circular dichroism experiments were performed using a Jasco 810 Spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Tokyo). The protein concentration for both cleaved and native maspin used was 15 μm with a 0.1-cm path length. Thermal denaturation was performed at a heating rate of 1 °C/min in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and monitored at 222 nm.Cell-Extracellular Matrix Adhesion Assay—The breast carcinoma cell line MDA-MB-231 (provided by T. Brown, Monash University), was routinely cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm glutamine (Invitrogen). For the cell adhesion assay, wells were coated with 50 μl of 5 μg/ml fibronectin (Sigma) and blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline. The cell adhesion assay was performed essentially as described by Ngamkitidechakul et al. (8Ngamkitidechakul C. Warejcka D.J. Burke J.M. O'Brien W.J. Twining S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31796-31806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), except that prior to assessing adhesion, cells in suspension were preincubated with the indicated concentration of recombinant maspin for 30 min at 37 °C, then added directly to the wells.Crystallization—Maspin was concentrated to 20 mg/ml and a Cartesian Honeybee™ crystallization robot (Genomic Solutions) was used to establish initial crystallization conditions (100-nl drops). Small needles were identified in a condition containing 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.28, 3 m (NH4)2SO4. Subsequent fine screening was carried out using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Single large crystals grew at 22 °C in 0.1 m BisTris, pH 8.3, 2.9 m (NH4)2SO4 after 4–6 weeks. The crystals were flash-frozen prior to data collection with 5% ethylene glycol as the cryoprotectant.X-ray Data Collection, Structure Determination, and Refinement—The first crystal form of maspin diffracted to 2.8-Å resolution and belongs to space group P212121, with unit cell dimensions of a = 53.54 Å, b = 100.48 Å, c = 136.61 Å. The second form diffracted to 2.1-Å resolution and belongs to space group P212121, with unit cell dimensions of a = 54.12, b = 95.05, c = 139.23. Both structures are consistent with two monomers in the asymmetric unit and ∼42% solvent content (calculated using Matthews (25Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7899) Google Scholar)). The data were integrated and scaled with the HKL suite (26Otwinowski Z. Minor. W.

McCoy A.J. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar) and multiple superposed search models of native serpins (ovalbumin, 1OVA; antitrypsin, 1QLP; serpin 1K, 1SEK; antithrombin, 1E05). Two clear peaks in the rotation function yielded two solutions in the translation function that packed well within the unit cell and, together with unbiased features in the initial electron density map, confirmed the correctness of the molecular replacement solution.An initial model was built using native ovalbumin (1OVA), with all sequence differences mutated to alanine. The progress of refinement was monitored by the Rfree value (5% of the data) with neither a sigma, nor a low resolution cut-off applied to the data. The structure was refined using rigid-body fitting of the individual domains followed by the simulated-annealing protocol implemented in CNS (version 1.1) (28Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16929) Google Scholar), interspersed with rounds of model building using the program ‘O’ (29Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13003) Google Scholar). Tightly restrained individual B-factor refinement was employed, and bulk solvent correction was applied to the data set, which led to a significant drop in the Rfree value. Further refinement, incorporating translation, libration, and screw-rotation displacement refinement was then carried out using REFMAC (30Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13773) Google Scholar). A bulk solvent correction (Babinet model with mask) was also used within REFMAC. Throughout refinement, tight non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were imposed on the two molecules, excluding residues involved in crystal contacts. Water molecules were included in the model if they were within hydrogen-bonding distance to chemically reasonable groups, if they appeared in Fo - Fc maps contoured at 3.5σ and had a B-factor <60 Å2. The RCL loop in both monomers was observed to be mobile and relatively disordered and was not modeled fully in either monomer.Upon obtaining better diffracting crystals, the 2.1-Å structure was solved by molecular replacement using AMORE (31Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1367-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) and chain A of the refined 2.8-Å model as a search probe. Subsequent structure refinement proceeded as for the 2.8-Å structure using CNS, however the higher resolution data permitted full positional and B-factor refinement without non-crystallographic symmetry restraints. Further refinement, incorporating translation, libration, and screw-rotation displacement refinement was then carried out using REFMAC (30Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13773) Google Scholar), together with automated placement of solvent molecules using ARP/wARP. A bulk solvent correction (Babinet model with mask) was also used within REFMAC. See Table I for a summary of refinement statistics and model quality. The coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession codes 1XU8 and 1WZ9).Structural Analysis—Hydrogen bonds (excluding water-mediated bonds), salt bridges, and surface area were calculated using the WHA-TIF server (32Rodriguez R. Chinea G. Lopez N. Pons T. Vriend G. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 523-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar); MolScript (33Kraulis P.J. J. Appl.

Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar) and DeluxeAlign 2J. Irving, unpublished data. were used to produce Fig. 3. GRASP surfaces were color-coded according to electrostatic potential (calculated by the Poisson-Boltzmann solver within GRASP). Lys and Arg residues were assigned a single positive charge, and Asp and Glu residues were assigned a single negative charge; all other residues were considered neutral. The calculation was done assuming a uniform dielectric constant of 80 for the solvent and 2 for the protein interior. The ionic strength was set to zero. The color of the surface represents the electrostatic potential at the protein surface, going from blue (potential of +10 kT/e) to red (potential of -10 kT/e), where T is temperature, e is the charge of an electron, and k is the Boltzmann constant. The probe radius used was 1.4 Å. Maspin, PEDF, and ovalbumin were superposed using the program PINQ (Ref. 37Lesk A.M. Saccone C. Biosequences: Perspectives and User Services in Europe. European Economic Community, Brussels, Belgium1986: 23-28Google Scholar and references contained therein), and using techniques as previously described (38Whisstock J.C. Skinner R. Carrell R.W.

https://openalex.org/W2110639213,The paucity of melted rock in this crater may be due to the striking projectile's speed. Meteor Crater in Arizona was the first terrestrial structure to be widely recognized as a meteorite impact scar and has probably been more intensively studied than any other impact crater on Earth. We have discovered something surprising about its mode of formation — namely that the surface-impact velocity of the iron meteorite that created Meteor Crater was only about 12 km s−1. This is close to the 9.4 km s−1 minimum originally proposed1 but far short of the 15–20 km s−1 that has been widely assumed2 — a realization that clears up a long-standing puzzle about why the crater does not contain large volumes of rock melted by the impact.
https://openalex.org/W2057351871,"Translation initiation of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA occurs through an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) located at its 5′ end. As a positive-stranded virus, HCV uses the genomic RNA template for translation and replication, but the transition between these two processes remains poorly understood. HCV core protein (HCV-C) has been proposed as a good candidate to modulate such a regulation. However, current data are still the subject of controversy in attributing any potential role in HCV translation to the HCV core protein. Here we demonstrate that HCV-C displays binding activities toward both HCV IRES and the 40 S ribosomal subunit by using centrifugation on sucrose gradients. To gain further insight into these interactions, we investigated the effect of exogenous addition of purified HCV-C on HCV IRES activity by using an in vitro reporter assay. We found that HCV IRES-mediated translation was specifically modulated by HCV-C provided in trans, in a dose-dependent manner, with up to a 5-fold stimulation of the IRES efficiency upon addition of low amounts of HCV-C, followed by a decrease at high doses. Interestingly, mutations within some domains of the IRES as well as the presence of an upstream reporter gene both lead to changes in the expected effects, consistent with the high dependence of HCV IRES function on its overall structure. Collectively, these results indicate that the HCV core protein is involved in a tight modulation of HCV translation initiation, depending on its concentration, and they suggest an important biological role of this protein in viral gene expression.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) 1The abbreviations used are: HCV, hepatitis C virus; IRES, internal ribosome entry site; UTR, untranslated region; nt, nucleotide; EMCV, encephalomyocarditis virus; CSFV, classical swine fever virus; DM, n-dodecyl maltoside; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus, type 1; GBV-B, GB virus B; RRLs, rabbit reticulocyte lysates; NS, nonstructural; C, core protein. is the primary causative agent of non-A and non-B hepatitis, frequently associated with high rates of progressive liver disease, leading to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (1Hoofnagle J.H. Hepatology. 1997; 26: S15-S20Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Since its identification in 1989 (2Choo Q.L. Kuo G. Weiner A.J. Overby L.R. Bradley D.W. Houghton M. Science. 1989; 244: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (6292) Google Scholar), appreciation of the significant worldwide impact of chronic HCV infection has grown as ∼170 million people, i.e. 3% of the world's population, are infected with HCV. HCV is an enveloped positive-stranded RNA virus whose genome of about 9600 nucleotides (nt) encodes a polyprotein that is processed by both host and viral proteases to yield individual structural and nonstructural HCV proteins (3Reed K.E. Rice C.M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2000; 242: 55-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). HCV, along with pestiviruses and GB virus B (GBV-B), are members of the Flaviviridae family that utilize a cap-independent mechanism to initiate translation of their viral RNA that starts at the AUG codon (position 341 for HCV), following ribosome recognition of the upstream internal ribosome entry site (IRES) (4Tsukiyamakohara K. Iizuka N. Kohara M. Nomoto A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1476-1483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HCV IRES is a cis-acting element, highly folded into a complex secondary and tertiary structure consisting of several stem-loop domains, which has been shown to be crucial for its functionality (reviewed in Ref. 5Rijnbrand R.C. Lemon S.M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2000; 242: 85-116PubMed Google Scholar). Of the four domains delineated within the HCV 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR), only the first seems not to be part of the IRES. The minimal sequence necessary for IRES activity extends approximately from nt 42 to a short stretch (12–30 nt) downstream of the initiation codon (6Reynolds J.E. Kaminski A. Kettinen H.J. Grace K. Clarke B.E. Carroll A.R. Rowlands D.J. Jackson R.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6010-6020Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). However, the 3′ border of the IRES element remains controversial because of conflicting data on the requirement of some viral coding sequences between the AUG codon and the reporter gene for its efficiency. The following explanation has been proposed to reconcile the different reports: the HCV IRES-dependent translation negatively correlates with the stability of the putative stem-loop IV involving base pairing between the extreme 3′ end of the HCV 5′-UTR and the 5′ proximal open reading frame following the initiation codon, located in the loop of that hairpin structure (7Honda M. Brown E.A. Lemon S.M. RNA (N. Y.). 1996; 2: 955-968PubMed Google Scholar). Several studies have demonstrated a significantly enhanced expression of different reporters when part of the viral coding sequence is retained (6Reynolds J.E. Kaminski A. Kettinen H.J. Grace K. Clarke B.E. Carroll A.R. Rowlands D.J. Jackson R.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6010-6020Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 8Zhao W.D. Lahser F.C. Wimmer E. J.

Virol. 2000; 74: 10827-10833Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), although no specificity in that coding sequence seems to be required, as demonstrated with chimeric constructs harboring either CSFV or HCV coding sequences (11Fletcher S.R. Ali I.K. Kaminski A. Digard P. Jackson R.J. RNA (N. Y.). 2002; 8: 1558-1571PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of the internal initiation of HCV IRES, because of its extreme sensitivity to secondary structure in the vicinity of the initiation codon, resembles the situation described in prokaryotic systems rather than that observed for picornavirus RNAs (12Pestova T.V. Shatsky I.N. Fletcher S.P. Jackson R.J. Hellen C.U. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 67-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). First, there is formation of a binary complex between the basal part of domain III of the IRES (loop IIId) and the 40 S ribosomal subunit, followed by binding of the eukaryotic initiation factor 3 to the apical domain IIIb (13Kieft J.S. Zhou K. Jubin R. Doudna J.A. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 194-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 14Ji H. Fraser C.S. Yu Y. Leary J. Doudna J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16990-16995Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). This complex is further stabilized by the apical loop of domain II, independently of any other canonical translation initiation factors, leading to the terminal 80 S ribosomal assembly by binding of the 60 S subunit and allowing translation initiation (12Pestova T.V. Shatsky I.N. Fletcher S.P. Jackson R.J. Hellen C.U. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 67-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar) of the viral RNA. However, it has been suggested that trans-acting noncanonical factors either of cellular or of viral origin interact with HCV RNA in the stem-loop region IV, tightly modulating translation (5Rijnbrand R.C. Lemon S.M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2000; 242: 85-116PubMed Google Scholar). It appears, by analogy with picornaviruses, that the interaction of the HCV IRES with cellular factors has been studied more than the effect of HCV-encoded proteins on the HCV translation. Because of its particularity of promoting persistent infection, HCV has been suggested to possess a self-modulating mechanism to maintain a low level of replication. Therefore, it can be assumed that viral protein(s) might modulate RNA balance between the following three key steps of the viral life cycle: translation, replication, and packaging. Some of these proteins have been proposed to influence HCV IRES activity, such as core protein (15Shimoike T. Mimori S. Tani H. Matsuura Y. Miyamura T. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9718-9725Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,16Zhang J. Yamada O. Yoshida H. Iwai T. Araki H. Virology. 2002; 293: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), NS4A and NS4B (17Kato J. Kato N. Yoshida H. Ono-Nita S.K. Shiratori Y. Omata M. J. Med. Virol. 2002; 66: 187-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and NS4B and NS5A (18He Y. Yan W. Coito C. Li Y. Gale Jr., M. Katze M.G. J. Gen. Virol. 2003; 84: 535-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, there are conflicting results, mostly those concerning the HCV core protein that still appears to be a good candidate that might interact with HCV IRES for the following reasons. First, it is supposed to be present in the infected cell with E1 and E2 glycoproteins after decapsidation as a component of the nucleocapsid and also to be the first protein synthesized in that cell due to its most N-terminal position in the HCV polyprotein. Second, in addition to its role as a structural protein in the assembly and morphogenesis to form viral nucleocapsids, HCV core protein is involved in a wide range of biological activities such as cell transformation (19Ray R.B. Lagging L.M. Meyer K. Ray R. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4438-4443Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), apoptosis (20Marusawa H. Hijikata M. Chiba T. Shimotohno K. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4713-4720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), dysregulation of lipid metabolism (21Barba G. Harper F. Harada T. Kohara M. Goulinet S. Matsuura Y. Eder G. Schaff Z. Chapman M.J. Miyamura T. Brechot C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1200-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar), modulation of immunological functions (22Large M.K. Kittlesen D.J. Hahn Y.S. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 931-938PubMed Google Scholar), regulation of cell signaling (23Tellinghuisen T.L. Rice C.M. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2002; 5: 419-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and of cellular transcriptional promoters (24Ray R.B. Lagging L.M. Meyer K. Steele R. Ray R. Virus Res. 1995; 37: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) (for review see Refs. 25Lai M.M. Ware C.F. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2000; 242: 117-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 26McLauchlan J. J. Viral Hepat. 2000; 7: 2-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 27Ray R.B. Ray R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 202: 149-156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is still the subject of debate as to whether HCV core protein acts as a translational regulator. Some controversial reports assert that the core protein-coding sequence modulates HCV IRES function, acting through a long range RNA-RNA interaction that is either nonspecific (28Wang T.H. Rijnbrand R.C. Lemon S.M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 11347-11358Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) or specific, as described between nt 24 and 38 within the HCV 5′-UTR and nt 428 and 442 of the core coding sequence (29Kim Y.K. Lee S.H. Kim C.S. Seol S.K. Jang S.K. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In contrast, other studies indicate that the HCV core protein reduces the efficiency of HCV IRES translation by binding to the IRES either (i) through more than two of the four identified clusters of basic amino acid residues (15Shimoike T. Mimori S. Tani H. Matsuura Y. Miyamura T. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9718-9725Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or (ii) through two different amino acids sequences of core protein described as follows: amino acids 34–44 (16Zhang J. Yamada O. Yoshida H. Iwai T. Araki H. Virology. 2002; 293: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and amino acids 1–20 as well as the corresponding synthetic peptide (30Li D. Takyar S.T. Lott W.B. Gowans E.J. J. Gen. Virol. 2003; 84: 815-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In either case, a down-regulation of the IRES activity was reported. In this study, to gain insight into the potential role of the HCV core protein in influencing the efficiency of the HCV IRES-directed translation, we further examined the effect of the wild-type purified HCV core protein on the expression of reporter genes in an in vitro system. We found that the core protein provided in trans specifically modulates the HCV IRES activity in a dose-dependent manner. These findings suggest that the HCV core protein may play a role in the regulation of viral gene expression, which is discussed as one possible molecular mechanism facilitating viral persistence. Plasmid Constructs—Enzymes used for cloning and modifying DNA were from New England Biolabs and Roche Applied Science. Bicistronic vectors (vb) were derived from the pIRF vector, as described previously (10Laporte J. Malet I. Andrieu T. Thibault V. Toulme J.J. Wychowski C. Pawlotsky J.M. Huraux J.M. Agut H. Cahour A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 10827-10833Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, this plasmid contains the CMV and T7 promoters for transcription, the firefly luciferase (FLuc) gene, followed by the HCV 5′-UTR sequence and the Renilla luciferase gene (RLuc) in the pcDNA3.1Zeo (+) vector (Invitrogen). In this system, the upstream reporter FLuc (control) is translated in a cap-dependent fashion, whereas the downstream reporter RLuc (assay) is under the control of the HCV IRES. The constructs are described in Fig. 1. Vectors containing different HCV IRES sequences were obtained by inserting in the intercistronic region of pIRF, in place of the original HCV-1a IRES, HCV IRES sequences amplified from human patient sera by reverse transcription-PCR performed on the corresponding HCV RNAs and digested with BamHI and PstI enzymes. HCV IRES of genotype 1b was described in Ref. 31Laporte J. Bain C. Maurel P. Inchauspe G. Agut H. Cahour A. Blood. 2003; 101: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, and mutated IRESs of genotype 1a, as depicted in Fig. 1, have been reported in previous studies as follows: Q12 and Q22 in Ref. 10Laporte J. Malet I. Andrieu T. Thibault V. Toulme J.J. Wychowski C. Pawlotsky J.M. Huraux J.M. Agut H. Cahour A. J.

Methods. 2003; 109: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar. Heterologous IRES sequences were amplified with appropriate primers containing BamHI and PstI sites (i) from pCITE vector (Novagen) for encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) IRES (586 nt) (33Jang S.K. Krausslich H.G. Nicklin M.J. Duke G.M. Palmenberg A.C. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 2636-2643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), (ii) from pA/C-4 (a gift from Dr. C. Wychowski) for classical swine fever virus (CSFV) IRES (Alfortville strain) (373 nt) (34Ruggli N. Tratschin J.D. Mittelholzer C. Hofmann M.A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3478-3487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and (iii) from pSV CAT BiP Luc (kindly provided by Dr. P. Sarnow) for human immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein (BiP) IRES (220 nt) (35Macejak D.G. Sarnow P. Nature. 1991; 353: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Monocistronic vectors (mv) consist of (i) vm FLuc, containing the FLuc gene alone and cloned into pcDNA3.1, and (ii) vm IRLuc, the second plasmid concomitantly used with vm FLuc, which includes the RLuc gene expressed under the different IRES sequences, as described above, and inserted upstream of it. The constructs for expression of HCV and GBV-B core proteins were obtained by inserting into the pT7-7 (His6) vector (36Cortay J.C. Negre D. Scarabel M. Ramseier T.M. Vartak N.B. Reizer J. Saier Jr., M.H. Cozzone A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14885-14891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) the following NdeI-PstI-digested fragments as amplified previously by PCR: (i) a 507-bp fragment corresponding to amino acids 1–169 for the HCV-1b core protein (GenBank™ accession number D89872) encoded by the plasmid pCMV-C980 (a gift from Dr. K. Shimotohno (37Tanaka T. Kato N. Nakagawa M. Ootsuyama Y. Cho M.J. Nakazawa T. Hijikata M. Ishimura Y. Shimotohno K. Virus Res. 1992; 23: 39-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar)); and (ii) a 354-bp fragment corresponding to amino acids 1–118 for GBV-B (GenBank ™ accession number AF179612) encoded by the plasmid pGBB (a gift from Dr. J. Bukh (38Bukh J. Apgar C.L. Yanagi M. Virology. 1999; 262: 470-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar)). The correct orientations and sequences of all these constructs were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. Purification of Core Proteins and 40 S Ribosomal Subunit—Core-(His6) fusion proteins were produced in the inclusion bodies and purified as described previously (39Boulant S. Becchi M. Penin F. Lavergne J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45785-45792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Briefly, Escherichia coli strain BL21 SI (Invitrogen) was transformed with the plasmids encoding the respective core proteins of HCV and GBV-B. Transformants were grown at 37 °C in Luria broth medium without sodium chloride (NaCl), and expression of the recombinant fusion protein was induced by adding NaCl to a final concentration of 200 mm. Thereafter, two extractions were performed with 6 m urea in the presence of 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and the proteins were purified on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen) by elution with 250 mm imidazole and were submitted to a step of reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography. After lyophilization, each of the proteins was dissolved in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol buffer, containing or not 0.1% n-dodecyl maltoside (DM). The overall conformation and the oligomeric properties of the core proteins in solution were investigated by using circular dichroism, analytical centrifugation, intrinsic fluorescence measurements, and proteolysis with endoproteinase Glu-C. The results indicated that core proteins produced aggregate in the absence of detergent but behave as soluble α-helical folded proteins in the presence of mild detergent. The folded form displayed an exchange between monomer and dimer state. 2S. Boulant, C. Vanbelle, C. Ebel, F. Penin, and J. P. Lavergne, submitted for publication. HIV-1 IIIB p24 core was from Advanced Biotechnologies, Inc. (Tebu, France), and consisted of the native viral protein obtained from HIV-1 IIIB-infected HUT76 cells, purified by immunoaffinity, and solubilized in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2. The 40 S ribosomal subunit was prepared by zonal centrifugation, as described previously, using free polysomes (40Reboud A.M. Dubost S. Buisson M. Reboud J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6954-6961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In Vitro Transcription—Plasmids were linearized at the NotI site located immediately downstream of the gene of interest. The linearized sequences were purified by QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and served as templates for in vitro transcription of uncapped RNAs from the T7 promoter using large scale RNA production T7 RiboMAX system (Promega). After a 90-min incubation at 37 °C followed by treatment with RQ1 DNase (Promega) for 15 min at 37 °C, the RNAs synthesized were extracted and purified using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Then their content was determined by UV spectrophotometry, and their integrity was confirmed by SDS-agarose gel electrophoresis. The 32P-labeled HCV IRES RNA was obtained from vm IRLuc plasmid linearized with PstI, by in vitro transcription, and treatment with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) in the presence of [γ-32P]adenine triphosphate (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences), under standard conditions. Western Blot Analysis—Protein analysis by Western was performed with standard protocols after migration on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences), the HCV core protein was probed with primary monoclonal anti-core antibody (19D96D6; gift of Dr. C. Jolivet-Reynaud) (1:10,000) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugate goat anti-mouse monoclonal antibody (1:3,000) as secondary reagent and then revealed by the ECL+ detection procedure (Amersham Biosciences). Sucrose Gradient Centrifugation Analysis of 40 S Ribosomal Complexes—Purified 40 S ribosomal subunit (5 pmol), purified HCV core protein 1b (2.5 pmol), and 32P-radiolabeled HCV IRES RNA (2.5 pmol) were incubated according to different combinations in a final volume of 100 μl of gradient buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% dodecyl maltoside) for 15 min at 30 °C. The reactions were then layered over 5–20% (w/v) linear sucrose gradient and centrifuged in a Beckman SW 60 swing bucket rotor at 50,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C. Fractions (400 μl) were collected from the bottom of the tube, and the absorbance profile at A280 was monitored. Alternatively, the total radioactivity in each gradient fraction was estimated in a Packard Tri-Carb counter, and the presence of core protein was determined after 10% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid precipitation, followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. In Vitro Translation and Luciferase Assay—In vitro translations in micrococcal nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Promega) were performed according to the supplier's instructions, after a 1-h incubation at 30 °C, in a final volume of 10 μl containing 200 ng of RNA, with the addition, when appropriate, of 1 μl of core protein in increasing amounts varying from 10 to 1000 ng. When starting from plasmid DNA constructs, the TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) was primed with 200 ng of linearized DNA and increasing concentrations of core protein for transcription-translation with T7 RNA polymerase as indicated by the manufacturer in a 10-μl reaction mixture for 60 min at 30 °C. DNA and RNA amounts were in the translation linear response range for the corresponding batch of lysate. Luciferase activities were assayed on 6 μl of the reaction mixture by using dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). The FLuc and RLuc values were expressed relative to the control transcript without the addition of HCV-C protein, which was assigned a value of 1 (100% efficiency). Errors were calculated as the standard deviation of three calculated IRES activities and expressed as percentages of the average activity. HCV Core Protein Interferes with the Formation of the HCV IRES-40 S Ribosomal Subunit Primary Complex—As an initial examination of the impact of HCV core (HCV-C) protein on IRES-directed translation, we investigated the potential interaction of that viral protein with the HCV IRES-40 S complex. Because the HCV IRES specifically binds to the 40 S ribosomal subunit, even in the absence of any initiation factors, it is likely that additional factor(s) may modulate internal initiation of translation, interfering with IRES-40 S assembly. We addressed this possibility for HCV core protein, taking into account that it has already been reported to interact with HCV IRES (as mentioned above) and with the ribosome (41Santolini E. Migliaccio G. La Monica N. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3631-3641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To this end, we analyzed the potential interaction between the three constituents, HCV IRES, 40 S ribosomal subunit, and HCV-C protein, by ultracentrifugation on sucrose gradients of the complexes resulting from different combinations between them (Fig. 2). After characterization of the constituents taken individually, their putative association with each other was assessed either by counting radioactivity for IRES or by immunoblotting for core protein. IRES RNA-core association was confirmed (Fig. 2, B and C-b) in fractions 2–6, suggesting the formation of complexes slightly entering the gradient. Moreover, a complete cosedimentation of the 40 S subunit with HCV-C protein was observed (Fig. 2C-c). The sedimentation pattern of IRES plus the 40 S subunit indicated that the HCV IRES was recovered in two regions, in addition to the top of the gradient (Fig. 2B): fractions 7–9 corresponding to the association with 40 S, and fractions 2–5 that might result from interaction of IRES with ribosome element(s), due to the background noted in the distribution of the absorbance profile at 280 nm (Fig. 2A). Accordingly, it has been reported recently that HCV IRES exhibited a strong affinity for the ribosomal S5 protein that prevented the recruitment of the 40 S subunit (42Ray P.S. Das S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1678-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Therefore, it appears in this experiment that any event that might impair the observed unexplained binding of IRES in fractions 3–6 could improve IRES-40 S interaction. This happened in the last step, with the addition of purified core protein as shown in Fig. 2, B and C-d, with a shift in IRES distribution, corresponding to an enhanced association of IRES-40 S in fractions 7–9. Taken together, these data indicate that HCV core protein displays binding activity toward both HCV IRES and the 40 S ribosomal subunit. Moreover, they suggest that HCV-C may help IRES RNA-40 S assembly. HCV Core Protein Stimulates HCV IRES Activity in a Dose-dependent Manner—The results reported above prompted us to elucidate which regulatory mechanism, if any, would modulate HCV IRES efficiency through HCV core protein. We first used an in vitro coupled transcription-translation TnT system. All HCV IRESs used contained the first 30 nucleotides of the viral coding sequence, as described previously (10Laporte J. Malet I. Andrieu T. Thibault V. Toulme J.J. Wychowski C. Pawlotsky J.M. Huraux J.M. Agut H. Cahour A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 10827-10833Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), between the HCV initiation codon and the Renilla luciferase (RLuc) reporter. The core protein of genotype 1b was expressed in a prokaryotic system and purified as described under “Materials and Methods.” In this study, we used amino acids 1–169 of the protein, which is similar in size to the mature protein as suggested earlier by Santolini et al. (41Santolini E. Migliaccio G. La Monica N. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3631-3641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The TnT mix was primed with 200 ng of bicistronic DNA reporter vector vb IRF-1b containing the genotype 1b HCV IRES (31Laporte J. Bain C. Maurel P. Inchauspe G. Agut H. Cahour A. Blood. 2003; 101: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and supplemented, when appropriate, with increasing amounts of purified recombinant HCV core protein diluted in buffer with or without DM. This mild detergent was expected to avoid core aggregation as the protein has the propensity to multimerize via an interacting domain mapped within its N-terminal hydrophobic region (amino acids 36–102) (43Matsumoto M.

Jeng K.S. Zhu N. Lai M.M. Virology. 1996; 218: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), we were interested in testing their respective effects on HCV IRES activity. Luciferase activities were measured by using the Stop and Glo dual luciferase assay system (Promega) and were plotted against HCV-C concentrations (Fig. 3A, left). The results showed modest enhancement of RLuc activity (Fig. 3A, left, shaded bars) at increasing concentrations (10, 100, and 1000 ng) of core protein. However, the activity observed for FLuc, expressed in a cap-dependent manner, was almost the same (Fig. 3A, left, striped bars). Therefore, the effect of core addition on HCV IRES efficiency could be evaluated by comparing the ratio of RLuc activity relative to that of FLuc, with the ratio obtained with the same vector in the absence of core protein, arbitrarily considered to be 1 (Fig. 3B, left). A gradual increase was observed upon the addition of HCV-C protein to the translation reactions, suggesting an impact of the viral protein on the HCV IRES-mediated translation. This effect is dose-dependent, because RLuc expression was the highest in the presen"

Functional studies suggest a dual role for stargazin, both as a modulatory γ subunit for voltage-dependent calcium channels and as a regulator of post-synaptic membrane targeting for α-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA)-type glutamate receptors. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that stargazin can bind proteins of either complex in vivo, but it remains unclear whether it can associate with both complexes simultaneously. Cacng2 is one of eight closely related genes (Cacng1-8) encoding proteins with four transmembrane segments, cytoplasmic termini, and molecular masses between 25 and 44 kDa. This group of Cacng genes constitutes only one branch of a larger monophyletic assembly dominated by over 20 genes encoding proteins known as claudins. Claudins regulate cell adhesion and paracellular permeability as fundamental components of non-neuronal tight junctions. Because stargazin is structurally similar to claudins, we hypothesized that it might also have retained claudin-like functions inherited from a common ancestor. Here, we report that expression of stargazin in mouse L-fibroblasts results in cell aggregation comparable with that produced by claudins, and present evidence that the interaction is heterotypic and calcium dependent. The data suggest that the cell adhesion function of stargazin preceded its current role in neurons as a regulator of either voltage-dependent calcium channels or AMPA receptors. We speculate these complexes may have co-opted the established presence of stargazin at sites of close cell-cell contact to facilitate their own evolving intercellular signaling functions.

Among the four subunits comprising the mammalian voltage-gated Ca2+ channel (α1, α2δ, β, and γ), the γ subunit is the least well understood. Originally copurified with the 1,4-dihydropyridine receptor (L-type Ca2+ channel) from skeletal muscle (1Takahashi M. Seagar M.J. Jones J.F. Reber B.F. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sci. 1989; 560: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), early studies focused exclusively on the ability of the glycosylated 32-kDa transmembrane γ subunit to modulate the electrophysiological properties of the channel. Functional expression of the γ subunit with other channel subunits in Xenopus oocytes produced minor and variable effects on the amplitude of the resulting Ca2+ currents (4Mori Y. Friedrich T. Kim M.S. Mikami A. Nakai J. Ruth P. Bosse E. Hofmann F. Flockerzi V. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. Imoto K. Tanabe T. Numa S.

Mori Y. Campbell K.P. Frankel W.N. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 340-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar) used positional cloning to identify the defect responsible for epilepsy and ataxia in the stargazer (stg) mutant mouse. The novel gene encoded a glycosylated 36-kDa neuronal protein (stargazin) with 25% amino acid identity to the skeletal muscle Ca2+ channel γ subunit. Expression of stargazin protein with neuronal Ca2+ channel α1A, β1, and α2δ1 subunits in cultured baby hamster kidney cells inhibited Ca2+ currents to a small, but significant, degree by altering the balance of channel availability and inactivation. These subtle modulatory effects were reminiscent of the behavior of the skeletal muscle γ subunit (4Mori Y. Friedrich T. Kim M.S. Mikami A. Nakai J. Ruth P. Bosse E. Hofmann F. Flockerzi V.

It was concluded that stargazin was a neuronal Ca2+ channel γ subunit (γ2, gene symbol Cacng2), 1The abbreviations used are: Cacng or CACNG, Ca2+ channel γ; LIM, lens intrinsic membrane; EMP, epithelial membrane protein; PMP, peripheral myelin protein; CLDN or Cldn, claudin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; AMPA, α-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; TJ, tight junction; CAM, cell adhesion molecule; AMPAR, α-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate receptor. complementing the skeletal muscle-specific γ1 subunit (Cacng1) (6Letts V.A.

Genet. 1998; 19: 340-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar), and other possible functions went largely unexplored. The role of stargazin as a Ca2+ channel subunit was supported by studies that demonstrated that γ2 protein could be copurified and coimmunoprecipitated with other channel subunits from rodent brain and could modulate the biophysical properties of Ca2+ channels composed of different subunit isoform combinations (7Klugbauer N. Dai S. Specht V. Lacinova L. Marais E. Bohn G. Hofmann F. FEBS Lett. 2001; 470: 189-197Crossref Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 8Kang M.G. Chen C.C. Felix R. Letts V.A. Frankel W.N. Mori Y.

J. Physiol. 2001; 532: 583-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In 2000, the primary identity of γ2 as a voltage-gated Ca2+ channel subunit was challenged by discovery of a novel function, when it was found to be essential for the membrane localization and synaptic targeting of AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) in mouse cerebellar neurons (10Chen L. Chetkovich D.M. Petralia R.S. Sweeney N.T. Kawasaki Y. Wenthold R.J. Bredt D.S. Nicoll R.A. Nature. 2000; 408: 936-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Stargazer mutant mice, which exhibit gross defects in cerebellar function, lack detectable AMPAR currents in granule neurons. Transfection of Cacng2 into cultured stg/stg granule cells completely restored synaptic AMPAR function. Other experiments demonstrated that γ2 coimmunoprecipitates with GluR1, -2, and -4 AMPAR subunits expressed in heterologous COS cells, and that the postsynaptic density protein, PSD-95, is required to translocate the γ2-AMPAR complex to neuronal postsynaptic membranes (10Chen L.

Interestingly, this investigation failed to identify the Ca2+ current abnormalities in stg/stg neurons that might have been predicted from in vitro studies of γ2 function as a Ca2+ channel subunit. This could be explained if loss of γ2 is functionally rescued by compensating proteins or, alternatively, if γ2 is not required as a Ca2+ channel subunit in vivo. Subsequent analyses extended these results to support a central role for γ2 in the AMPA receptor pathway (11Choi J. Ko J. Park E. Lee J.R. Yoon J. Lim S. Kim E. J. Biol.

Recent functional analyses demonstrated that the novel γ subunit-like proteins can, like γ2, interact with and regulate voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, AMPARs, or both, however, the results were quite variable. Klugbauer et al. (7Klugbauer N. Dai S. Specht V. Lacinova L. Marais E. Bohn G. Hofmann F. FEBS Lett. 2001; 470: 189-197Crossref Scopus (153) Google Scholar) reported that γ4 altered the steady state inactivation of the P/Q-type Ca2+ channel although γ5 accelerated the kinetics of current activation and inactivation of the T-type calcium channel in HEK-293 cells (7Klugbauer N. Dai S. Specht V. Lacinova L. Marais E. Bohn G. Hofmann F. FEBS Lett. 2001; 470: 189-197Crossref Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Rousset et al. (9Rousset M. Cens T. Restituito S. Barrere C. Black J.L. McEnery M.W. Charnet P. J. Physiol. 2001; 532: 583-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) showed that γ3 hyperpolarized the activation and increased the inactivation of P/Q-type Ca2+ channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes, with some dependence on other auxiliary channel subunits. Kang et al. (8Kang M.G. Chen C.C. Felix R. Letts V.A. Frankel W.N. Mori Y. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32917-32924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) demonstrated that γ3 copurified with other neuronal Ca2+ channel subunits in vivo. Coexpression of γ7 protein with the pore forming CaV2.2 (α1B) protein nearly eliminated N-type Ca2+ currents in Xenopus oocytes or COS cells, and reduced conductance through L-type and P/Q-type Ca2+ channels. Unexpectedly, the mechanism of inhibition in this case appeared to be a reduction of α1 subunit protein expression by γ7 rather than modulation of existing channels (25Moss F.J. Viard P. Davies A.

Cell Cardiol. 2004; 37: 1147-1158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) showed that coexpression of γ6 significantly decreased currents through recombinant T-type Ca2+ channels (CaV3.1) in HEK-293 cells and native T-type Ca2+ channels in atrial HL-1 cells, and that this effect did not accompany any decrease in the level of CaV3.1 mRNA or protein. The abilities of γ1–γ8 to regulate AMPA receptors appear to be more straightforward than their regulation of voltagegated Ca2+ channels: γ3, γ4, and γ8 each bind to PSD-95 and appear to function much like γ2 in regulating AMPARs, whereas there is no evidence yet of such a role for γ1, γ5, γ6, or γ7 (17Yamazaki M. Ohno-Shosaku T. Fukaya M. Kano M. Watanabe M. Sakimura K. Neurosci. Res. 2004; 50: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 27Tomita S. Chen L. Kawasaki Y. Petralia R.S. Wenthold R.J. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 805-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). As a result, some have relabeled γ2, γ3, γ4, and γ8 as “transmembrane AMPA-receptor regulatory proteins,” or TARPs (27Tomita S. Chen L. Kawasaki Y. Petralia R.S. Wenthold R.J. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 805-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). The expansion of protein families through gene and whole genome duplication provides raw material for adaptive evolution via mutation and selection, and is considered a driving force in the development of biological novelty and complexity (28Ohno S. Evolution By Gene Duplication. Springer-Verlag, New York1970Crossref Google Scholar, 29Nadeau J.H. Sankoff D. Genetics. 1997; 147: 1259-1266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Prince V.E. Pickett F.B. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 827-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Whereas the selective pressures that determine the fate of recently copied genes are poorly understood, theoretical models propose alternative outcomes. In some models, duplicated genes evolve novel adaptive functions while losing ancestral functions; in other models, the ancestral functions are retained as new ones emerge (29Nadeau J.H. Sankoff D. Genetics. 1997; 147: 1259-1266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Prince V.E. Pickett F.B. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 827-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 31Force A. Lynch M. Pickett F.B. Amores A. Yan Y.L. Postlethwait J. Genetics. 1999; 151: 1531-1545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This raises the intriguing possibility that the evolution of voltage-gated Ca2+ channel modulation and AMPAR trafficking functions for the γ subunit proteins did not occur at the expense of some fundamental ancestral capability. The expression of γ subunit genes in several tissue types that do not express either AMPARs or voltagegated Ca2+ currents is consistent with such a third function. We previously reported a phylogenetic relationship between Ca2+ channel γ subunits and a larger family of proteins called claudins (18Burgess D.L. Davis C.F. Gefrides L.A. Noebels J.L. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 1204-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The claudin superfamily also contains peripheral myelin protein-22 (PMP-22), lens intrinsic membrane protein-2 (LIM-2), and epithelial membrane proteins 1 through 3 (EMP1–3). Claudins are cell adhesion molecules that selectively regulate paracellular permeability at epithelial tight junctions (TJs) and facilitate other types of inter- and intramembraneous interactions in nonepithelial cells (32Tsukita S. Furuse M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 915: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 33Van I.C. Anderson J.M. Physiology. 2004; 19: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). There is evidence that PMP-22 and LIM-2 may have similar roles in these or other cell types (34Notterpek L. Roux K.J. Amici S.A. Yazdanpour A. Rahner C. Fletcher B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Eye Res. 2003; 77: 567-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Based on the phylogenetic relationship and structural similarity of γ subunits and claudins, and applying current models of adaptive evolution among duplicated genes, we speculated that these proteins might yet share a basic ancestral function. Here, we test the hypothesis that the neuronal protein, stargazin, can mediate cell adhesion like the tight junction protein, Claudin-1. We present evidence in support of this hypothesis and discuss the potential implications in terms of Ca2+ channel and AMPA receptor behavior in neurons.

To facilitate alignment, sequences were trimmed to include only the region spanning the first through the fourth transmembrane domains, as predicted by the TMpred program (36Hofmann K. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 347: 166Google Scholar). The sequences were aligned using the ClustalW algorithm set to the default parameters within the MegAlign module of the Lasergene (DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI) software package, viz. gap penalty, 10.00; gap length penalty, 0.20; delay divergent sequences, 30; DNA transition weight, 0.50; and protein weight matrix, Gonnet series. A phylogenetic tree based on this alignment was constructed with the MegAlign program using the same parameters. The linear alignment created by ClustalW was optimized by visual inspection, and shaded so that black represents ≥67% conservation throughout the entire family and gray represents ≥50% conservation within the clade. Claudin-1, Cacng2 (Stargazin), and Mutant Cacng2-N48Q Expression Plasmids—Two types of expression plasmids were constructed: one for bicistronic expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) and Claudin-1, Cacng2, or Cacng2-N48Q protein, and the other for expression of GFP fused to the NH2 terminus of these proteins. cDNAs for mouse Claudin-1 (Cldn1; locus AF072127) (43Furuse M.

The cDNAs were cloned into pGEM T-Easy (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) and sequenced to confirm the absence of mutations (Seqwright Laboratories, Houston, TX). The Cacng2-N48Q mutation construct was created using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The cDNAs were then transferred into vectors pIRES2-EGFP and pEGFP-C1 (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA), which provided a neomycin resistance selectable marker. Cell Lines and Transfections—L929 mouse fibroblasts (L-cells) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). All cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and lacking antibiotics except during selection of transformed clones. Cells were transfected with plasmids using FuGENE-6 (Roche Diagnostics Corp., Indianapolis, IN) and stable transfectant cells were selected by growth in medium containing 500 μg of G418/ml. Clones were selected by dilution into 96-well plates. Colonies derived from single cells were expanded and aliquots were frozen in liquid nitrogen. Transient transfections of subconfluent HEK-293 cells in 60-mm culture dishes were done using 2 μg of each DNA construct for a GFP fusion protein and FuGENE-6 reagent, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were harvested or examined by fluorescence microscopy 48 h later. Cell Aggregation Assays—Subconfluent cells were harvested from culture dishes by treatment with 0.05% trypsin, 0.53 mm EDTA for 10 min, dissociated by gentle pipetting, and washed once with culture medium. 1 × 106 cells in 1 ml of culture medium were placed into duplicate wells of 12-well culture plates, which were precoated with a 1% Noble agar in culture medium gel to prevent cell adherence to the dish. Independent plates were prepared for each time point, equilibrated for 10 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2, sealed, and placed in a gyratory shaker at 80 rpm at 37 °C. Aggregation was arrested and preserved by adding glutaraldehyde to a final concentration of 4%. Cells were diluted 10-fold into balanced electrolyte solution and the particles from each well were counted using a Z1 particle counter (Beckman Coulter Inc., Fullerton, CA) set to a particle size threshold of 9 μm. To test the role of Ca2+ in aggregation, EGTA was added to both the agar plate-coating solution and the culture medium. The MaxChelator program (www.stanford.edu/~cpatton/maxc.html) was used to calculate the EGTA concentration to achieve the desired free calcium concentrations in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The values used for the calculations were: total Ca2+, 1.9175 mm; Mg2+, 0.813 mm; temperature, 37 °C; pH, 7.6; and ionic strength, 0.339 m. The ratios of EGTA concentration to the expected final free calcium concentrations were: 2.0 mm EGTA (0.82 μm Ca2+), 1.9 mm EGTA (21 μm Ca2+), 1.4 mm EGTA (0.570 mm Ca2+), and 0.0 mm EGTA (1.9 mm Ca2+). The data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of two independent measurements. Significance was evaluated using a paired, two-tailed Student's t test. Heterotypic Cell Adhesion Experiments—Experiments were done using L929 fibroblast cells (L-cells) labeled with the lipophilic PKH26 red fluorescent cell marker (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions and as described (37Duguay D. Foty R.A. Steinberg M.S. Dev. Biol. 2003; 253: 309-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). To ensure that the labeling procedure did not alter aggregation properties, mock-labeled cells were prepared by processing in solutions without the added dye marker. One-to-one ratios of PKH26 red-labeled L-cells and unlabeled L-cells, L-cells stably expressing bicistronic GFP and Claudin-1, or L-cells stably expressing bicistronic EGFP and γ2 were prepared as in a standard cell aggregation assay. After 4.5 h of aggregation, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, to avoid the autofluorescence produced by glutaraldehyde, and transferred to phosphate-buffered saline for microscopy. Approximately 1 × 103 cells of each mixture were counted from digital images and visually scored as either individual cells or members of cell clusters. Fluorescence and Light Microscopy—For immunofluorescent detection of γ2 protein, parental L-cells and cells stably transformed with Cacng2 or Cacng2-N48Q constructs were plated in 4-well NalgeNunc LabTek II chamber slides at 7.5 × 104 cells/well. After 2 days in culture, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, pretreated with 5% normal goat serum, stained with 15–30 μg/ml rabbit anti-γ2 antibody (Upstate LLC, Lake Placid, NY) and then with a 1:1,000 dilution of Alexa 546-labeled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Nuclei were stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and cells were mounted in SlowFade S-2828 component A (Molecular Probes). Light microscopy was carried out with an Olympus IX71 inverted microscope (Olympus America, Melville, NY) outfitted for epifluorescence and Nomarski differential interference contrast. Images were captured with a Hammamatsu Orca CCD camera (Hammamatsu Photonic Systems, Bridgewater, NJ) and processed using SimplePCI (Compix, Cranberry Township, PA). Electron Microscopy—Cells and aggregates were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2, postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, en bloc stained with 1% aqueous uranyl acetate, and embedded in Epon 812 resin. Ultrathin sections were stained with 2% ethanolic uranyl acetate and then with Reynold's lead citrate. Sections were examined with a Hitachi H-7500 transmission electron microscope (Hitachi High Technologies America Inc., Pleasanton, CA) and images were obtained with a Gatan 2Kx2K CCD camera using Gatans Digital Micrograph Contrast software (Gatan Inc., Pleasanton, CA). Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Positive and negative controls for γ2 immunodetection were prepared from cerebella of affected homozygous mutant (stg/stg) and unaffected homozygous wild type (+/+) littermates of stg/+ (B6C3Fe a/a-Cacng2stg/J) mouse matings. Cerebella were homogenized in ×10 volumes of 0.32 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1:100 dilution of mammalian protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Subconfluent control or transfected L-cells were harvested from 100-mm culture dishes into 200 μl of warm sample buffer. Protein samples in 2% SDS were heated to 70 °C for 10 min, separated on prewarmed 12% polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose filters in 20% methanol in Tris/glycine buffer at 80 volts for 2 h at 4 °C. Filters were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.05% Tween 20. The γ2 protein was detected following incubation with 1 μg/ml of rabbit antibodies directed against carboxylterminal residues 305–323 (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY). Horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Biosciences) and exposure to BioMax MS film (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY). Blots were stripped and probed with 2.5 μg/ml mouse clone AC-74 anti-β actin antibody (Sigma) or a mixture of the anti-β actin antibody plus 0.2 μg/ml rabbit anti-GFP antibody (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). Sequence Comparison and Phylogenetic Analysis—We initially suggested the relationship between the Ca2+ channel γ1–γ5 subunits and the Claudin-4 protein in a previous study (18Burgess D.L. Davis C.F. Gefrides L.A. Noebels J.L. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 1204-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and extend that observation here to include several additional proteins (Fig. 1A). Three distinct clades were discriminated: claudins, gammas, and a third clade containing PMP-22, LIM-2, and EMP1–3. The distant affiliation of claudins to the protein Clarin-1 (gene symbol USH3A), used as the outgroup in our analysis, was suggested by Adato et al. (38Adato A. Vreugde S. Joensuu T. Avidan N. Hamalainen R. Belenkiy O. Olender T. Bonne-Tamir B. Ben-Asher E. Espinos C. Millan J.M. Lehesjoki A.E. Flannery J.G. Avraham K.B. Pietrokovski S. Sankila E.M. Beckmann J.S. Lancet D. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 10: 339-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Additional proteins with homology to the claudins include NKG7 (natural killer cell group 7), TM4SF10 (transmembrane 4 superfamily, member 10), PERP (TP53 apoptosis effector), and C3orf4 (chromosome 3, open reading frame 4) (data not shown).

https://openalex.org/W2152825552,"Most tumors show abnormal karyotypes involving either chromosome rearrangements and/or aneuploidies. The aim of our study is to measure the rate of both structural and numerical chromosome instability in two colorectal cancer cell lines: HCT116, and SW480 and its single subclones. To determine structural instability, we measured the nonclonal chromosome alterations of the last cell division by means of multicolor-fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). To quantify numerical instability, we used centromere-specific DNA probes to simultaneously detect chromosome loss and nondisjunctional events in binucleated cells obtained by cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay (CBMN). After clonal episodes, the structural chromosome instability rate increased significantly, confirming the large contribution of structural rearrangements to the heterogeneity of cancer cells. On the other hand, the aneuploidy rate was high and conserved in both the parental SW480 cell line and its subclones. The ability to differentiate chromosome loss and nondisjunction by the CBMN assay allowed us to conclude that no significant differences were detected among these events. Analysis of nucleoplasmic bridges, micronuclei, and nuclear blebs also demonstrated the differences among the structural instability rates of the parental cell line and its subclones. Overall, our results demonstrate the prevalence of structural over numerical chromosome instability in the subclones when comparing them with their parental cell line, confirming the contribution of ongoing chromosomal reorganizations in the generation of tumor cell heterogeneity."

They are also powerful DNA recognition elements for the positioning of ubiquitous molecules acting on DNA, such as anticancer drugs. A prerequisite for further development of DNA code-reading molecules including TFOs is their ability to form a complex in a cellular context: their binding affinities must be comparable to those of DNA-associated proteins. To reach this goal, chemically modified TFOs must be developed. In this work, we present triplex-forming properties (kinetics and thermodynamics) and cellular activity of G-containing locked nucleic acid-modified TFOs (TFO/LNAs). In conditions simulating physiological ones, these TFO/LNAs strongly enhanced triplex stability compared with the non-modified TFO or with the pyrimidine TFO/LNA directed against the same oligopyrimidine·oligopurine sequence, mainly by decreasing the dissociation rate constant and conferring an entropic gain. We provide evidence of their biological activity by a triplex-based mechanism, in vitro and in a cellular context, under conditions in which the parent phosphodiester oligonucleotide did not exhibit any inhibitory effect.

The design of synthetic non-protein molecules able to control DNA-associated biological functions through their interaction with a specific DNA sequence represents a very attractive approach. Among DNA code-reading molecules, triplex-forming oligonucleotides (TFOs) 1The abbreviations used are: TFO, triplex-forming oligonucleotide; LNA, locked nucleic acid; TFO/LNA, LNA-modified triplex-forming oligonucleotide; nt, nucleotide(s); GFP, green fluorescent protein; CMV, cytomegalovirus; PPT, polypurine tract; nt, nucleotide(s); SPR, surface plasmon resonance. are able to bind to the major groove of oligopyrimidine·oligopurine regions in double-stranded DNA. A series of results have validated triplex-based approaches at the molecular and cellular levels: triplexes have been shown to interfere with transcription (initiation and elongation), replication, repair, and recombination (1Besch R. Giovannangeli C. Degitz K. Curr. Drug Targets. 2004; 5: 691-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 2Seidman M.M. Glazer P.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). However, the intracellular efficiency of TFOs still has to be improved. One possible approach consists of increasing the stability of the non-covalent triple helices under physiological conditions to reach binding affinities comparable to those of DNA-associated regulatory proteins. To this end, a variety of chemically modified nucleic acids have been developed. Among them are locked nucleic acids (LNAs) that contain LNA nucleotide monomers, i.e. ribonucleotides with a 2′-O,4′-C-methylene linkage that effects conformational fixation of the furanose ring in a C3′-endo conformation (3Koshkin A. Rajwanshi V.K. Wengel J. Tetrahedron Lett. 1998; 39: 4381-4384Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 4Obika S. Nanbu D. Hari Y. Andoh J. Morio K. Doi T. Imanishi T. Tetrahedron Lett. 1998; 39: 5401-5404Crossref Scopus (615) Google Scholar). LNA-containing oligonucleotides have been recently shown to enhance triplex stability and to alleviate in part the sequence constraints imposed by the triple helical recognition motifs (5Buchini S. Leumann C.J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2003; 7: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 6Wengel J. Vester B. Lundberg L.B. Douthwaite S. Sorensen M.D. Babu B.R. Gait M.J. Arzumanov A. Petersen M. Nielsen J.T. Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids. 2003; 22: 601-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Only a few hybridization properties of LNA-modified TFOs (TFO/LNAs) have been reported so far, and they all concern (T,C)-containing TFO/LNAs. It has been shown that fully modified TFO/LNAs failed to bind to double-stranded DNA (7Obika S. Uneda T. Sugimoto T. Nanbu D. Minami T. Doi T. Imanishi T. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2001; 9: 1001-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 8Koizumi M. Morita K. Daigo M. Tsutsumi S. Abe K. Obika S. Imanishi T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3267-3273Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), likely due to conformational restraint of TFO/LNA. However, alternating DNA and LNA nucleotides in TFO sequences is appropriate for efficient triplex formation. A study on a 15-mer pyrimidine TFO/LNA provided evidence that LNA-induced triplex stabilization is associated with a slower dissociation rate constant and a less unfavorable entropic contribution compared with the non-modified TFO (9Torigoe H. Hari Y. Sekiguchi M. Obika S. Imanishi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2354-2360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In previous works, TFO/LNAs have been used only for in vitro assays, including plasmid functionalization (10Hertoghs K.M. Ellis J.H. Catchpole I.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5817-5830Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, LNA-modified oligonucleotides are appealing molecules: they have been successfully used as efficient antisense agents, even in vivo (for examples, see Refs. 11Elayadi A.N. Braasch D.A.

Biol. 2002; 9: 1073-1084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the present work we report the triplex forming properties and intracellular activity of G-containing TFO/LNAs. We characterized the mechanism of triplex stabilization induced by LNA modifications in G-containing TFOs, compared with non-modified isosequential phosphodiester TFOs and with pyrimidine TFO/LNA directed against the same oligopyrimidine· oligopurine target sequence. The dependence of triplex stability on pH was also explored. To address these questions, kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of triplexes were evaluated by surface plasmon resonance. Specificity of TFO/LNA binding was also analyzed, using UV melting experiments, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and restriction enzymatic protection assay. Finally, we evaluated the capacity of G-containing TFO/LNAs to interfere with biological processes in vitro and in cells, using experimental settings designed to demonstrate a triplex-based mechanism in a quantitative manner. We showed that G-containing TFO/LNAs were active, as measured by inhibition of transcription elongation. Our results support TFO/LNA activity in a cellular context at submicromolar concentrations, which has never been reported before, and represent the first step toward further development of TFO/LNAs as artificial modulators of DNA-associated biological functions. Oligonucleotides—Oligonucleotide analogues with LNA residues were synthesized as previously described (3Koshkin A. Rajwanshi V.K. Wengel J. Tetrahedron Lett. 1998; 39: 4381-4384Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar) or purchased from Proligo (France SAS). Phopodiester oligonucleotides were synthesized by Eurogentec; for cellular experiments, the phosphodiester oligonucleotide (15TCG sequence, see Fig. 1) was 3′-modified by incorporation of a propylamine group (named 15TCG*/po) to resist nuclease-mediated degradation. Plasmids—The pSP-F47 plasmid was constructed by insertion of a 780-bp fragment of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1/nef gene containing the oligopyrimidine·oligopurine PPT target sequence between the T7 and SP6 promoters in the pSP73 host vector (Promega), as previously described in detail (18Giovannangeli C. Perrouault L. Escude C. Gryaznov S. Helene C. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 386-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This system allowed us to run bidirectional in vitro transcription assays. The pCMV(+)PPT/luc plasmid derives from the bidirectional expression vectors (pBI Tet vectors; Clontech). These vectors contain the tet-responsive element between two identical minimal CMV promoters in opposite directions. This system was used to express two reporter genes, the firefly luciferase (Photinus pyralis) gene (luc) and the GFP gene. Expression of both genes is co-regulated by doxycycline. The activator protein (reverse Tet repressor protein, rTetR) binds the tetresponsive element in the presence of doxycycline and activates transcription. This protein was produced from the pTet-On expression plasmid (Clontech). Two 55-bp inserts containing either the wild-type human immunodeficiency virus type 1 polypurine tract target sequence (PPT, 5′-AAAAGAAAAGGGGGGA-3′) or a mutated sequence (PPTmut, 5′-AAAAGAAGGGGAGGAA-3′; the four mutations are shown in bold) were cloned in the 5′-transcribed but untranslated regions of the luciferase and GFP genes, downstream of the transcription start site. The pRL-CMV vector (Promega) contains Renilla luciferase (from the marine organism Renilla reniformis) under the control of the CMV promoter. pRL-CMV was used to monitor transfection efficiency. UV Absorption Melting Experiments—All thermal denaturation experiments were performed in a 10 mm sodium cacodylate buffer (at the indicated pH value) containing 10 mm MgCl2 and 150 mm NaCl. The sample contained 1 μm duplex (PPT or mutPPT duplex: 29-bp-long intramolecular hairpin duplexes) and 1.5 μm TFO (see the sequences in Fig. 1). Melting profiles were recorded at 260 nm, using an UVIKON 940 spectrophometer, as previously described (19Faria M. Wood C. White M. Helen C. Giovannangeli C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Corrections for spectrophotometric instability were made by subtracting the absorbance at 540 nm from that at 260 nm. The temperature was decreased from 92 °C to 0 °C and increased again to 92 °C at a rate of 0.2 °C/min. All the cooling and heating profiles presented here were reversible. The melting temperature (Tm in °C) was evaluated from melting curves, either directly or after subtraction of the duplex absorption from that of the triplex. The triplex Tm was estimated within ±0.5 °C accuracy, except when the melting profiles of triplex transition presented a weak hypochromism (±1 °C accuracy in Tm). The standard molar enthalpy and entropy changes ( ΔHa0 and ΔSa0) associated with triplex formation were determined according to a two-state model and a van't Hoff analysis (20Marky L. Breslauer K. Biopolymers. 1987; 26: 1601-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). SPR Experiments—SPR measurements were performed on a BIAcore 2000™ (BIAcore AB) using a carboxymethylated dextran-coated sensor chip (CM5), as previously described (21Alberti P. Arimondo P.B. Mergny J.L. Garestier T. Helene C. Sun J.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 5407-5415Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, a controlled amount of streptavidine (∼5500 resonance units) was immobilized on the chip after activation by N-ethyl-N′-(dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide. The unused activated sites were capped by injecting 100 μl of 1 m ethanolamine. One micromolar solutions of 3′-biotinylated hairpin duplexes (PPT duplex and control duplex 5′-GCTAAAGAGAGAGAGAAATCGTTTTCGATTCTCTCTCTCTTTAGCTTTTTTT-Biotin) were prepared in a buffer purchased from BIA-core (0.01 m HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.0005% surfactant P20), and duplex injection was controlled to obtain a 1500-resonance unit increase. Serial dilutions of TFO were prepared in 10 mm sodium cacodylate, 10 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.0005% surfactant P20 at different pH values (pH 6, 6.5, or 7). These triplexforming buffer conditions are the same as the ones used in UV absorption melting experiments. G-containing TFOs, such as the 15TCG sequence, can self-associated to form G-quadruplex structures, thus decreasing the effective concentration of TFO. To prevent G-quadruplex formation, stock solutions of 15TCG/LNA and 15TCG/po were alkalitreated (with 50 mm NaOH for 15 min at 25 °C and neutralized with 50 mm HCl) before SPR or spectroscopic experiments. Serial TFO injections were performed (100 μl at a flow rate of 10 μl/min) simultaneously on the hairpin duplex containing the target PPT sequence and on the control duplex lacking the PPT sequence. All the sensorgrams were corrected by subtraction of the control duplex signal, reflecting mainly bulk index changes. For thermodynamic analyses, SPR experiments were carried out at four fixed temperatures (20 °C, 25 °C, 30 °C, and 37 °C). The sensorgrams were analyzed using BIAevaluation 3.0 software. The association rate constant kon was determined by the linear fitting of the apparent association rate constant (kapp = kon × [TFO] + koff) at different TFO concentrations ([TFO]), in agreement with a two-state model. The dissociation profile could be fitted by a bi-exponential model. The fast component was neglected because it could arise from a fast relaxation of the sensor chip matrix, as previously discussed (21Alberti P. Arimondo P.B. Mergny J.L. Garestier T. Helene C. Sun J.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 5407-5415Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The mass transport effects were negligible under our experimental conditions. Electrophoresis Mobility Shift Assay—PPT or mutPPT hairpin intramolecular duplexes were 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) by T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega). The duplex (50 nm) was incubated with increasing concentrations of TFO in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm spermine, and 10% sucrose (at room temperature overnight). The non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel (15%) was run at 37 °C in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, and 5 mm MgCl2. Gels were scanned with a PhosphorImager, and results were quantified using the ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). The level of complex formation was estimated by the TFO concentration at which 50% of complex was formed (C50). Restriction Enzyme (DraI) Protection Assay—The pCMV(+)PPT/luc plasmid contains the PPT sequence overlapping one of the seven DraI sites. It was used as a substrate for a restriction enzyme protection assay. For the cleavage assay, the pCMV(+)PPT/luc plasmid was incubated at 37 °C for 20 min with increasing amounts of oligonucleotides in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm spermine in the presence of DraI enzyme. The fragments generated by DraI cleavage in the absence of TFO are 3654-, 1936-, 1718-, 692-, 683-, 534-, and 19-bp long. A 3654-bp fragment corresponding to the addition of the 1936- and 1718-bp fragments was obtained when TFO-induced inhibition of DraI cleavage occurred. The extent of triplex-mediated inhibition of DraI cleavage was assessed by gel electrophoresis (0.8% agarose gel) and quantitated. The TFO concentration that gave 50% inhibition (IC50) was then evaluated. In Vitro Transcription Assay—Transcription assays were performed using the pSP-F47 plasmid that contains the PPT sequence between T7 and SP6 promoters. The plasmid was linearized by BspEI for T7 transcription and synthesis of purine/PPT-containing RNA (660-nt long) or by Bsu36I for synthesis of pyrimidine/PPT-containing RNA (597-nt long). The linearized plasmids (0.5 μg) were used for in vitro transcription assays in the presence of increasing amounts of TFOs in a buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2; 6 mm MgCl2; 2 mm spermidine; 4 mm dithiothreitol; 1 unit/μl RNase inhibitor in presence of 500 μm ATP, CTP, and UTP; 100 μm GTP; and 0.3 μm [α-32P]GTP. Transcription was initiated by addition of 25 units of phage RNA polymerase (T7 or SP6). After 5 min at 37 °C, transcription reactions were terminated by ethanol precipitation (10 volumes of ethanol was added to samples with 0.3 m sodium acetate and 15 μg of glycogen). The transcription products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 6% polyacrylamide gels, and quantifications (±10%) were obtained by PhosphorImager analysis. The percentages were corrected for transcript length effects, taking into account that the transcripts were uniformly radiolabeled. Cell Cultures and Transient Expression Assay—The P4-CCR5 cells were derived from HeLa cells (22Charneau P. Mirambeau G. Roux P. Paulous S. Buc H. Clavel F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. P4-CCR5 cells were used for transfection of oligonucleotides and reporter vectors. Transfections were performed using the cationic activated dendrimer Superfect (Qiagen). Typically, 0.1 μg of pCMV(+/–)-PPT/luc plasmid, 0.1 μg of pTet-On activator plasmid, 0.003125 μg of pRL-CMV plasmid, and various amounts of oligonucleotides were mixed with Superfect (1.5 μl) in a total volume of 12 μl (serum-free medium). The mixture was prepared for triplicates and added to P4-CCR5 cells (13,750 cells/well in a 96-well plate in 88 μl of serum-containing medium in the presence of doxycycline, which was necessary for CMV promoter induction). After cell lysis (in 30 μl of Passive Lysis Buffer; Promega), activities of both luciferases (firefly and Renilla) were measured in the same cell extract using the dual-luciferase assay kit (Promega), and GFP expression was measured as well (15 μl of lysate in 80 μl of phosphate-buffered saline). Luciferase and GFP expressions were measured with a luminometer/fluorometer (Victor™-Wallac). The modulation of firefly luciferase expression by oligonucleotide treatment was quantitated by evaluation of the firefly/Renilla ratio; the specificity of triplex-induced inhibition was evaluated by the GFP/Renilla ratio. Each experiment was repeated at least three times, and values are presented as the mean of a triplicate (±S.D.) from a representative experiment. RNA Analysis—Total cellular RNA was prepared (RNeasy Mini; Qiagen). Firefly and Renilla luciferase RNAs were subjected to competitive reverse transcription-PCR (for details, see Ref. 23Diviacco S.

Perrouault, U. Asseline, J. Wengel, and C. Giovannangeli, manuscript in preparation. Briefly two sets of two PCR primers were designed for each luciferase RNA; two competitor DNAs (firefly and Renilla) were used and co-amplified with the RNA sample. For each luciferase, the two amplified products (from sample and competitor, which are 153- and 192-bp long for firefly and 250- and 294-bp long for Renilla, respectively) were separated using an 8% PAGE in Tris borate-EDTA and quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis. Tight and Specific Binding of LNA-modified TFOs in the (T,C,G)-Motif—In the present work we have studied the binding and biological properties of a series of LNA-modified TFOs (TFO/LNAs) directed against a 16-bp-long oligopyrimidine· oligopurine sequence (named PPT). All the sequences and their LNA content are shown in Fig. 1. The TFOs (15TCG and 16TC) have been described previously (25Faria M. Wood C.D. Perrouault L. Nelson J.S. Winter A. White M.R. Helene C. Giovannangeli C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3862-3867Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Both bind parallel to the purine-containing strand of the duplex by Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding. Because fully modified TFO/LNA failed to hybridize to double-stranded DNA (7Obika S. Uneda T. Sugimoto T. Nanbu D. Minami T. Doi T. Imanishi T. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2001; 9: 1001-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), only a few LNA modifications (five to nine) were introduced. For the (T,C,G)-containing sequence, three TFO/LNAs were designed: the 15TCG(1)/LNA is composed of alternating LNA and DNA nucleotides all along the sequence (8 LNA/15 nt); the 15TCG(2)/LNA contains LNA modifications only in the T-rich part of the sequence (5 LNA/15 nt); and the 16TCG/LNA is a modified version of the 15TCG(2)/LNA with two additional LNA modifications at the 3′-end of the sequence to increase resistance to 3′-exonucleases (26Kurreck J. Wyszko E. Gillen C. Erdmann V.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1911-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), and it was used in cellular experiments. The 16TC/LNA sequence is the pyrimidine analogue of the 15TCG(1)/LNA and was designed as a reference to compare the (T,C)- and (T,C,G)-motifs. The thermal stability of the different triplexes formed by these TFO/LNAs and the PPT target sequence was first determined by UV absorption melting experiments at neutral pH. Representative UV melting profiles of the triplexes formed by 15TCG/LNA and 16TC/LNA are shown in Fig. 2; the melting temperature values (Tm) are summarized in Table I. The presence of LNA modifications strongly increases the triplex-forming ability of the oligomers compared with the isosequential phophodiester in the (T,C)-motif (as described previously) (9Torigoe H.

Wengel J. Sun J.S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4160-4169Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and in the (T,C,G)-motif. At neutral pH and physiological concentrations of monovalent cations (150 mm), the highest thermal stability was obtained with the sequences 15TCG(1)/LNA and 15TCG(2)/LNA (Tm = 58 °C and 55 °C, respectively): a 21 °C and 18 °C increase (respectively) in the melting temperature was observed compared with the corresponding pyrimidine sequence 16TC/LNA (Tm = 37 °C). The presence of three additional LNA modifications in the G-rich portion of the 15-TCG sequence slightly enhanced triplex stability (ΔTm(15TCG(1)/LNA–15TCG(2)/LNA) = 3 °C, i.e. 1 °C/(LNA-G nucleotide)). Compared with the isosequential phospodiester 15TCG/po, the presence of LNA modifications resulted in a strong increase in Tm (4.9 °C/LNA nucleotide and 7.2 °C/LNA nucleotide for 15TCG(1)/LNA and 15TCG(2)/LNA, respectively). Two additional LNA modifications at the 3′-end of the 15TCG(2)/LNA sequence did not significantly influence triplex stability as measured by the Tm (ΔTm(16TCG/LNA–15TCG(2)/LNA) = 1 °C). This result is consistent with the hypothesis that the 3′-end nucleotide of the 16TCG/LNA sequence is not involved in base triplet formation as already observed for the 16TCG/po (28Giovannangeli C. Rougee M. Garestier T. Thuong N.T. Helene C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In two of them, we compared the TFO/LNA binding to the PPT duplex target and to the mutPPT duplex containing two mutations (5′-AAAAGAAAAAGGAGGA-3′; mutations are shown in bold). First, using UV absorption melting experiments, we showed that 15TCG(1)/LNA and 15TCG(2)/LNA could discriminate between the wild-type and the mutated target with a large decrease in Tm (ΔTm = 27 °C and 19 °C, respectively). It should be noted that nine contiguous triplets could theoretically be formed with the A4GA4 sequence on both of the targets (PPT and mutPPT). Second, the specificity of triplex formation was confirmed by gel shift experiments. Increasing amounts of the different TFO/LNAs were incubated in the presence of the PPT or mutPPT duplexes at 37 °C and neutral pH (see “Materials and Methods”). TFO concentrations required for 50% of complex formation (C50) were estimated. Under these conditions, the two 15TCG/LNA sequences present affinities for the PPT target in the same range (C50(15TCG(1)/LNA) = 0.4 μm;C50(15TCG(2)/LNA) = 0.15 μm). Under our experimental conditions (150 mm NaCl), the 15TCG sequences might self-associate; a different degree of self-association for 15TCG(1)/LNA and 15TCG(2)/LNA could explain the slight difference in apparent binding affinities. No binding was detected on the mutPPT duplex up to 2.5 μm TFO/LNAs (at this concentration, the triplex was completely formed on PPT duplex), ensuring specificity of DNA target recognition. Third, we determined the capacity of TFO/LNAs to interfere with restriction enzyme cleavage specifically at the triplex site. Indeed, the sequence at the 5′-side of the PPT oligopurine strand provides a recognition site for the restriction enzyme DraI, which overlaps the triplex site on 3 bp (Fig. 1). This enzyme cleaves at the junction of the triple helix site (TTT↓AAA), and triplex formation inhibits DNA cleavage (29Giovannangeli C. Diviacco S. Labrousse V. Gryaznov S. Charneau P. Helene C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The pCMV(+)-PPT/luc plasmid contains the PPT site and seven DraI sites. In the presence of TFO, DraI cleavage was impaired only on the site overlapping the PPT sequence: inhibition of cleavage at this site led to the appearance of a unique longer 3654-bp fragment and the disappearance of the 1936- and 1718-bp fragments. TFO concentrations required for 50% inhibition (IC50) of DraI cleavage were determined from the concentration dependence of cleavage inhibition for the two 15TCG/LNA TFOs (IC50(15TCG(1)/LNA) ≈ 0.3 μm and IC50(15TCG(2)/LNA) ≈ 0.2 μm). Under the same conditions, the isosequential phosphodiester TFO did not inhibit cleavage at 37 °C up to a concentration of 10 μm. The level of DraI cleavage inhibition specifically at the triplex site induced by TFOs reflects both the specificity and the stability of triplex formation.Table IISpecificity of G-containing TFO/LNA bindingTFO/LNAΔTmaTm values of different G-containing TFO with PPT or mutPPT duplexes (see oligopyrimidine·oligopurine sequences in Fig. 1).

In this study, we aimed to unravel the signaling cascades mediate FGF9 actions in human uterine endometrial stromal cell. Our results demonstrate that the mitogenic effect of FGF9 is transduced via two parallel but additive signaling pathways involving mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase. Activation of mTOR by FGF9 induces p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K1) phosphorylation, cyclin expression, and cell proliferation, which are independent of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis demonstrates that mTOR physically associates with S6K1 upon FGF9 treatment, whereas ablation of mTOR activity using RNA interference or pharmacological inhibitor blocks S6K1 phosphorylation and cell proliferation induced by FGF9. Further study demonstrates that activation of mTOR is regulated by a phospholipase Cγ-controlled calcium signaling pathway. These studies provide evidence to demonstrate, for the first time, that a novel signaling cascade involving phospholipase Cγ, calcium, mTOR, and S6K1 is activated by FGF9 in a receptor-specific manner.

On the other hand, aberrant expression of FGF9 is associated with the development of several human diseases including prostate cancer, brain tumor, and endometriosis (3Giri D. Ropiquet F. Ittmann M.

Neurosurgery. 1998; 43: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Despite its well studied biological functions, the signaling mechanism of FGF9 remains to be identified.The signaling of FGF is mediated via complex interactions between specific members of the FGF family and one or more FGF receptor isoforms. Receptors for FGF (FGFR1 to -4) are tyrosine kinase receptors consisting of two intracellular tyrosine kinase domains, a single transmembrane domain, and an extracellular portion that contains three immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains. The third Ig domain (Ig III), which exerts the highest impact on FGF receptor binding specificity and tissue-specific expression patterns, is the region in which alternative splicing occurs. Three different splice variants (designated as IIIa, IIIb, and IIIc) have been identified for FGFR1 and FGFR2, whereas only the IIIb and IIIc variants have been detected for FGFR3 (14Johnson D.E. Lu J. Chen H. Werner S. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4627-4634Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 15Duan D.S. Werner S. Williams L.T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 11620-11627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As of yet, no splice variant for FGFR4 has been identified. The splicing variant “IIIa” of FGFR is a secreted protein, whereas IIIb and IIIc are both membrane-bound receptors containing mutually exclusive Ig III domains. It is generally believed that the IIIb isoform of FGFRs is expressed in epithelial lineages, whereas the IIIc variant is restricted to mesenchymal origin (18Avivi A. Yayon A. Givol D. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 19Yan G. Fukabori Y. McBride G. Nikolaropolous S. McKeehan W.L. Mol. Cell.

These include phosphorylation of Src and phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ), leading finally to activation of PKC as well as activation of Crk and Shc (21Larsson H. Klint P. Landgren E. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25726-25734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The adaptor protein, FRS2, serves as an alternative link of FGFR to the activation of PKC and, in addition, activates the Ras signaling cascade. FRS2 contains multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites in the C-terminal tail that serve as binding sites for the Grb2 and for the Src homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase, Shp2 (22Kouhara H.

Furthermore, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K1) cascade also play important roles in mediating FGFR signaling. Activation of PI3K by FGF-FGFRs has been demonstrated in studies using biochemical, pharmacological, and genetic approaches (25Carballada R. Yasuo H. Lemaire P.

Results from these studies suggested that PI3K can be activated directly via association with FRS or indirectly via an Erk-dependent pathway (27Hadari Y.R. Gotoh N. Kouhara H. Lax I. Schlessinger J.

For example, most studies on FGF receptor-mediated signal transduction have been carried out using FGFR1 as the prototypical FGFR, which is bound by many members of FGF family. Others using an overexpression system to characterize the signaling pathways of a given splice variant have had trouble in interpreting the significance of their data, since it is not obtained under physiological conditions (30Hinsby A.M. Olsen J.V. Bennett K.L. Mann M. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2003; 2: 29-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 31Cailliau K. Browaeys-Poly E. Vilain J.P. Biochim. Biophys.

We previously reported that endometrial stroma expresses predominantly the FGFR2IIIc splice variant by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis and immunohistostaining and that FGF9 potently stimulates endometrial stromal cell proliferation (5Tsai S.J. Wu M.H. Chen H.M. Chuang P.C. Wing L.Y. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 2715-2721Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This unique feature of the endometrial stromal cell makes it the ideal model for investigation of the signaling pathway of FGF9 devoid of unnecessary interference from other FGFRs or forced overexpression of FGFR in a cell that normally does not express such receptor. Results from this study should provide novel information in dissecting the complex FGF-FGFR signaling network and bring new insight in understanding physiological and pathological functions of FGF9.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Primary antibodies (anti-Akt, anti-phospho-Akt (Ser473), anti-phospho-Akt (Thr308), anti-Erk1/2, anti-phospho-Erk1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204), anti-S6K1, anti-phospho-S6K1 (Thr389), anti-phospho-S6K1 (Thr421/Ser424), anti-mTOR, anti-phospho-mTOR (Ser2448), anti-phospho-mTOR (Ser2481), anti-TSC2, anti-phospho-TSC2 (Thr1462), anti-PKCα, and anti-PKCδ) were from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA); anti-β-actin was from Oncogene Research Products (Cambridge, MA); anti-proliferating cell nuclear antigen was from Zymed Laboratories (South San Francisco, CA); and anti-cyclin A, anti-cyclin D1, anti-PI3K 110α, anti-total PKC, and anti-PDK1 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.

Human ethics approval was obtained from the Clinical Research Ethics Committee at The National Cheng Kung University Medical Center, and informed consents were obtained from the patients. Tissues were immersed in Hanks' solution supplemented with HEPES and antibiotics and transported to the laboratory for further processing. The biopsies were minced and subjected for isolation of stromal cells as previously described (32Tsai S.J. Wu M.H. Lin C.C. Sun H.S. Chen S.M. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

The stromal cell population was free of epithelial cell contamination.Cell Cultures—Stromal cells were cultured in culture medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12, 10% FCS, penicillin (100 μg/ml), streptomycin (100 units/ml), and fungizone (50 μg/ml) in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The medium was changed every other day. When the cells reached confluence, they were subcultured in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium supplemented with 10% FCS, penicillin (100 μg/ml), streptomycin (100 units/ml), and fungizone (50 μg/ml) until 70% confluence was reached. After serum starvation for 36 h, the cells were treated with vehicle, FGF9 (50 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of different inhibitors under serum-free, phenol red-free medium conditions. For the siRNA experiment, cells were cultured in a 12-well plate and transfected with SignalSilence™ mTOR siRNA or SignalSilence™ control siRNA according to procedures recommended by the manufacturer (Cell Signaling). Two days after transfection, cells were treated with FGF9 for 15 min. Cells were harvested under Tris-sucrose-EDTA buffer (10 mm Tris, 250 mm sucrose, and 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm NaVO3, and 1 mm NaF) and centrifuged at 600 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to remove debris. Protein concentrations were determined by the Lowry method (34Lowry D.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).[3H]Thymidine Incorporation Assay—Subcultured stromal cells were deprived of serum for 36 h, treated with recombinant human FGF9 (50 ng/ml; R&D Research, San Diego, CA) for 18 h in the presence or absence of different inhibitors (as described in the figure legends), and subjected to [3H]thymidine incorporation assay as previously described with minor modification (5Tsai S.J. Wu M.H. Chen H.M. Chuang P.C. Wing L.Y. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 2715-2721Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 33Wu M.H. Chuang P.C. Chen S.M. Lin C.C. Tsai S.J. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2002; 8: 456-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were incubated with [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/ml) for 4 h and then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were incubated with 10% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid for 20 min and then washed with phosphate-buffered saline. The acid-insoluble fractions were dissolved by 1 n NaOH and then neutralized with an equal volume of 1 n HCl. Five hundred-microliter aliquots were transferred to a scintillation vial containing 3.5 ml of counting fluid (Ready Safe; Beckman). The radioactivity was measured by a liquid scintillation counter.Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Whole cell lysate (500 μg of protein) was precleaned using Sepharose-conjugated protein A (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 1 h, and then anti-S6K1 antibody (4 μg/ml) was incubated with the lysate for 16–18 h at 4 °C with rotation. Protein A-Sepharose was then added to the lysate to capture the S6K1-antibody complex. After extensive washing with ice-cold washing buffer (0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in 1× phosphate-buffered saline), immune complex was recovered by the protein A-Sepharose beads. They were boiled in 2× SDS sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue) and subjected to SDS-PAGE separation. Proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), which was blocked in 5% skimmed milk at 4 °C overnight. Membrane was then incubated with specific primary antibodies for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing with TBST (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) for 3 × 10 min, membrane was further incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Membrane was washed for 6 × 10 min with PBST and detected by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were then stripped with striping buffer (100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, and 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7) and redetected as described above using different set of primary and secondary antibodies. For statistical analysis, the intensity of individual band in a given Western blot was quantified using the AlphaImager analyzing software (Alpha Innotech Corp, San Leandro, CA).PI3K Kinase Activity Assay—Serum-starved stromal cells were stimulated with 50 ng/ml FGF-9 for 5 min at 37 °C. The samples were lysed for 20 min on ice in 200 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate). Immunoprecipitation was performed using anti-p85α, anti-phosphotyrosine, or an irrelevant mouse IgG at 4 °C overnight. Protein A-Sepharose was then added, and the incubation was continued for 1 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times in lysis buffer and once in kinase activity buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2). PI3K activity was initiated in 50 μl of final volume by the addition of 45 μl of kinase activity buffer, 5 μl of 1 ng/ml phosphoinositides, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Phosphoinositides were sonicated for 15 min in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and added to the samples (final concentration, 0.1 ng/ml). The reactions were stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 1 n HCl and 160 μl of CHCl3/MeOH (1:1) (v/v). The organic phase was collected, re-extracted with 80 μl of MeOH, 1 n HCl, 2 mm EDTA (1:1) (v/v). The samples were spotted onto Silica Gel 60 TLC (MERCK) plates pretreated with 1% (w/v) potassium oxalate, 2 mm EDTA, 40% MeOH (v/v) for 30 min and air-dried at room temperature. The plates were developed in CHCl3/MeOH/H2O/NH4OH (45:35:8.5:1.5) (v/v), and the radiolabeled spots were detected by autoradiography.Calcium Measurement—Stromal cells were serum-starved for 36 h and then labeled for 40 min at room temperature with 5 μm Fura-2/AM, the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator. Extracellular Fura-2/AM was washed away, and the stromal cells were incubated for an additional 20 min at 37 °C in Fura-2-free buffer. The Petri dish was mounted on a computer-connected inverted microscope with epifluorescence attachments (Diaphot 300; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). The excitation light from a xenon lamp was filtered to provide wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm using a high speed rotating filter wheel (Lambda 10-2, Sutter, Novato, CA). Cells were carefully focused and then sequentially treated with different concentrations of FGF9 (50, 100, and 200 ng/ml) at a 7-min interval. In a separated experiment, cells were pretreated with LY294002 (0.1, 1, 10 μm) or wortmannin (100 nm) 30 min prior to calcium measurement. Results from five randomly picked cells were used to calculate single cell calcium levels. At the end of each experiment, the calcium concentration was calibrated by applying ionomycin (5 μm) in the presence of 5 μm EGTA, followed by 10 μm CaCl2. All signals were corrected for autofluorescence determined by exposing the tissue to 5 mm manganese to quench cytosol Fura-2 fluorescence. Intracellular free calcium was estimated after subtracting background and autofluorescence according to the established formula.Statistical Analysis—The data were expressed as means ± S.E. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 4.02 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Duncan's procedure was used to test the difference between individual treatment groups, whereas Dunnet's test was applied to compare treatment groups versus control once significance was found by F test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.RESULTSFGF9-induced Stromal Cell Proliferation Is Partially Mediated by the Ras-Erk Signaling Pathway—To investigate the mitogenic effect of FGF9, endometrial stromal cells were cultured in serum-free, phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 for 36 h and treated with FGF9 to induce cell proliferation. The addition of FGF9 (50 ng/ml) induced a greater than 10-fold increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation over basal level (Fig. 1A). Concordantly, expression of cell cycle regulators such as cyclin D1 (marker of G1 to S phase) and cyclin A (marker of S to G2 phase) was time-dependently up-regulated by treatment with FGF9. Elevation of cyclin D1 induced by FGF9 was first evident after treatment with FGF9 for 12 h and sustained for at least 48 h (Fig. 1B). Up-regulation of cyclin A was induced between 12 and 24 h after FGF9 treatment and remained elevated until 48 h (Fig. 1B). Together, this demonstrates that FGF9 can promote cell cycle progression, and the process is unremitting.To investigate the signaling pathway that governs FGF9-induced stromal cell proliferation, cells were pretreated with selective inhibitors for Ras and MEK. Cell proliferation induced by FGF9 was inhibited by pretreatment with MEK inhibitor, PD98059, or Ras inhibitor, FPT, in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2, A and B). Interestingly, disruption of Ras-Erk signaling pathway using FPT or PD98059 cannot completely inhibit FGF9-induced stromal cell proliferation without causing cell death (Fig. 2, A and B, and data not shown).Fig. 2FGF9-induced cell proliferation is partially inhibited by the Ras-Erk signaling pathway. A and B, serum-starved stromal cells were preincubated for 30 min with different doses of PD98059 or FTP and subsequently treated with FGF9 for 22 h. At the final 4 h, [3H]thymidine was added to culture medium. Cells were then harvested and subjected to a [3H]thymidine incorporation assay. Data are means ± S.E. from five independent experiments using different batches of cells performed in triplicate. Different letters denote significant difference between means of each group (p < 0.05). C, stromal cells were serum-starved and were subsequently incubated with FGF9 for the indicated times. Equal amounts of proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with an antibody against phospho-ERK1/2 and subsequently reprobed with anti-Erk1/2 antibody. Four independent experiments were repeated using different batches of cells, and the results were identical. D, a representative Western blot shows phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Erk1/2 after FGF9 treatment. Cells were serum-starved and then treated with FGF9 for 15 min. Cytosolic and nuclear fractions were collected and subjected to Western blot analysis as described. Four independent experiments were repeated using different batches of cells, and the results were similar. E, a representative Western blot shows that phosphorylation of Erk-induced by FGF9 was blocked by pretreatment with PD98059 (10 μm) and FPT (10 μm). Four independent experiments were repeated using different batches of cells, and the results were identical. F, a representative Western blot shows that induction of cyclin D1, cyclin A, and cyclin B1 by FGF9 was inhibited by pretreatment with PD98059 (10 μm) and FPT (10 μm). Four independent experiments were repeated using different batches of cells, and the results were identical.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To verify that incomplete inhibition of FGF9-induced stromal cell proliferation by Ras and MEK inhibitors was not due to incomplete blockage of Ras-MEK signaling, phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of MEK substrate, Erk1/2, was investigated. The addition of FGF9 to cultured stromal cells induced rapid and transient phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and nuclear translocation (Fig. 2D). In contrast, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase were not phosphorylated by treatment with FGF9 (data not shown). Pretreatment with Ras inhibitor, FPT (10 μm), or MEK inhibitor, PD98059 (10 μm), inhibited Erk1/2 phosphorylation induced by FGF9 (Fig. 2E). Interestingly, expression of cyclin D1 was only partially inhibited by pretreatment with FPT and PD98059 (Fig. 2F). Thus, it is likely that the Ras-Erk cascade is only responsible for a portion of FGF9 actions, and one or more pathway(s) may exist to transduce FGF9 signaling.FGF9 Action Is Independent of PI3K and Akt Activation—It is generally believed that PI3K-S6K1 is an important downstream effector system of peptide growth factors. To test whether PI3K-S6K1 signaling is involved in FGF9-induced cell proliferation, we first used PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, to block FGF9-induced stromal cell proliferation. Treatment with LY294002 dose-dependently inhibited FGF9-induced stromal cell proliferation (Fig. 3A). We next examined whether the downstream effector, S6K1, was activated by FGF9. Treatment of endometrial stromal cell with FGF9 induced phosphorylation of S6K1 at Thr389 and Thr421/Ser424 within 5 min and peaked at 15 min (Fig. 3B). The phosphorylation of S6K1 disappeared after 30 min of treatment (Fig. 3B). Phosphorylation of S6K1 was accompanied with nuclear translocation (Fig. 3B), although the significance remains unknown. Pretreatment with LY294002 (10 μm) abrogated FGF9-induced S6K1 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation induced by FGF9 (Fig. 3C).Fig. 3S6K1 is activated by treatment with FGF9 in human endometrial stromal cell. A, stromal cells were treated as described in the legend of Fig. 1 except that different doses of LY294002 were administered. Data are means ± S.E. from five independent experiments using different batches of cells performed in triplicate. Different letters denote significant difference between means of each group (p < 0.05). B, serum-starved stromal cells were treated with FGF9 for 5, 15, or 30 min, and phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of S6K1 was determined by blotting with specific antibody. Equal amounts of cytoplasmic or nuclear proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with an antibody against the phosphorylated/activated form (Thr421 and Ser424) of the S6K1 (p(T/S)). Membrane was stripped and reprobed with anti-phospho-S6K1 (Thr389), anti-S6K1, and anti-β-actin (for cytoplasmic fraction)/anti-proliferating cell nuclear antigen (for nuclear fraction) antibodies, respectively. C, serum-starved stromal cells were preincubated for 30 min with LY294002 (10 μm) and subsequently treated with FGF9 for 15 min. Equal amounts of cytoplasmic or nuclear proteins were analyzed as described above.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Phosphorylation of Akt is usually accompanied by th"

Here we show that purified Ecm1 is a monomeric protein that catalyzes methyl transfer from S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) to GTP. The reaction is cofactor-independent and optimal at pH 7.5. Ecm1 also methylates GpppA, GDP, and dGTP but not ATP, CTP, UTP, ITP, or m7GTP. The affinity of Ecm1 for the cap dinucleotide GpppA (K 0.1 mm) is higher than that for GTP (Km 1 mm) or GDP (Km 2.4 mm). Methylation of GTP by Ecm1 in the presence of 5 μm AdoMet is inhibited by the reaction product AdoHcy (IC50 4 μm) and by substrate analogs sinefungin (IC50 1.5 μm), aza-AdoMet (IC50 100 μm), and carbocyclic aza-AdoMet (IC50 35 μm). The crystal structure of an Ecm1·aza-AdoMet binary complex reveals that the inhibitor occupies the same site as AdoMet. Structure-function analysis of Ecm1 by alanine scanning and conservative substitutions identified functional groups necessary for methyltransferase activity in vivo. Amino acids Lys-54, Asp-70, Asp-78, and Asp-94, which comprise the AdoMet-binding site, and Phe-141, which contacts the cap guanosine, are essential for cap methyltransferase activity in vitro.

The 5′ cap of eukaryotic messenger RNA consists of 7-methyl guanosine linked via an inverted 5′–5′ triphosphate bridge to the initiating nucleoside of the transcript. The cap is formed by three enzymatic reactions: (i) the 5′-triphosphate end of the pre-mRNA is hydrolyzed to a diphosphate by RNA 5′-triphosphatase; (ii) the diphosphate RNA end is capped with GMP by RNA guanylyltransferase; and (iii) the GpppN cap is methylated by RNA (guanine N-7) methyltransferase. This pathway is conserved in all eukaryotic organisms and many eukaryotic viruses (1Shuman S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The capping enzymes are considered attractive targets for antiviral, antifungal, and antiprotozoal drug discovery (2Shuman S. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant.

Microbiology. 1999; 145: 3023-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), but these enzymes are also not well characterized biochemically. Our recent studies have focused on the cap methyltransferase Ecm1 from the microsporidian parasite Encephalitozoon cuniculi (20Hausmann S. Vivares C.P. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 96-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 21Fabrega C. Hausmann S. Shen V. Shuman S. Lima C.D. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 77-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Ecm1 is the smallest cap methyltransferase known (298-aa), and it contains all of the essential components for cap methyltransferase activity in vivo, as gauged by complementation in yeast (20Hausmann S. Vivares C.P. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 96-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We have crystallized Ecm1 and determined its structure by x-ray diffraction (21Fabrega C. Hausmann S. Shen V. Shuman S. Lima C.D. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 77-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Ecm1 contains two ligand-binding pockets, one for the methyl donor AdoMet and one for the cap guanosine methyl acceptor and the 5′-triphosphate of the cap. Superposition of the structures of Ecm1·ligand complexes suggested a direct in-line mechanism of methyl transfer. No Ecm1 residues were observed in contact with the guanine N-7 nucleophile, the AdoMet methyl carbon, or the AdoHcy sulfur leaving group, implying that Ecm1 facilitates methyl transfer to cap guanine N-7 by optimizing proximity and geometry of the donor and acceptor. A similar catalytic strategy is used by glycine N-methyltransferase (22Takata Y. Huhang Y. Komoto J. Yamada T. Konishi K. Ogawa H. Gomi T. Fujioka M. Takusagawa F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8394-8402Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of Ecm1 provided clues to cap recognition and a potential scaffold for structure-based inhibitor design. The limitation to exploiting the structural information is that there has been no biochemical analysis of the cap methyltransferase activity imputed to Ecm1. Here we have shown that Ecm1 is a guanine-specific methyltransferase, determined its methyl acceptor preferences, and interpreted the findings in light of the enzyme structure. We have analyzed inhibition by the product AdoHcy and several substrate analogs and presented the structure of the analog aza-AdoMet in complex with Ecm1. We have conducted a structure-guided functional analysis of the active site of Ecm1 by gauging effects of mutations on methyltransferase activity in vivo and in vitro. Materials—[3H-CH3]AdoMet was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. GTP, GDP, m7GTP, ATP, UTP, CTP, ITP, AdoMet, AdoHcy, and sinefungin were purchased from Sigma. GpppA was purchased from New England Biolabs. 3′-OMeGTP was from Amersham Biosciences. aza-AdoMet and carbocyclic aza-AdoMet were synthesized as described (23Yang M. Ye M. Schneller S.W. J. Org. Chem. 2004; 69: 3993-3996Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Recombinant Ecm1—An NdeI/BamHI fragment encoding the wild-type Ecm1 polypeptide was inserted into the bacterial expression vector pET16b. The pET-Ecm1 plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). A 500-ml culture of E. coli BL21(DE3)/pET-Ecm1 was grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin until the A600 reached ∼0.6. The culture was placed on ice for 30 min and then adjusted to 0.2 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and 2% (v/v) ethanol. After further incubation for 17 h at 18 °C with constant shaking, the cells were harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellet was stored at –80 °C. All subsequent procedures were performed at 4 °C. Thawed bacteria were resuspended in 30 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol). Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and lysozyme were added to final concentrations of 300 μm and 100 μg/ml, respectively. After incubation on ice for 30 min, Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 0.1%, and the lysate was sonicated to reduce viscosity. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 45 min at 18,000 rpm in a Sorvall SS34 rotor. The soluble extract was mixed for 30 min with 2 ml of Ni+2-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) that had been equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 10 mm imidazole. The slurry was poured into a column, and the resin was washed with 10 ml of 10 and 20 mm imidazole in buffer A. Adsorbed protein was then serially step-eluted with 3-ml aliquots of 50, 100, 250, and 500 mm imidazole in buffer A. The polypeptide compositions of the column fractions were monitored by SDS-PAGE. The 250 mm imidazole eluate fraction containing His10-Ecm1 (10 mg of protein) was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol and then stored at –80 °C. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad dye reagent with bovine serum albumin as the standard. An aliquot (45 μg) of the nickel-agarose preparation of His10-Ecm1 was mixed with bovine serum albumin (40 μg) and cytochrome c (40 μg) in 0.2 ml of buffer G (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 0.05% Triton X-100). The mixtures were layered onto a 4.8-ml 15–30% glycerol gradient containing buffer G. The gradient was centrifuged in a Beckman SW50 rotor at 50,000 rpm for 17 h at 4 °C. Fractions (0.2 ml) were collected from the bottom of the tube. Methyltransferase Assay—Reaction mixtures (20-μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm DTT, 5 mm GTP, [3H-CH3]AdoMet, and Ecm1, as specified, were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. Aliquots (16 μl) were spotted onto DEAE-cellulose filters (25-mm, Whatman DE81), which were washed three times batch-wise with 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate. The filters were dried, and the radioactivity adsorbed to the filter was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Mutational Effects on Ecm1 Function in Vivo—Missense mutations were introduced into the ECM1 gene by the PCR-based two-stage overlap extension method. The mutated genes were inserted into the yeast CEN TRP1 plasmid p358-ECM1, where expression of ECM1 is under the control of the natural ABD1 promoter (21Fabrega C. Hausmann S. Shen V. Shuman S. Lima C.D. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 77-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The inserts were sequenced completely to exclude the acquisition of unwanted mutations during amplification and cloning. The in vivo activity of the mutated ABD1 alleles was tested by plasmid shuffle (20Hausmann S. Vivares C.P. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 96-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 21Fabrega C. Hausmann S. Shen V. Shuman S. Lima C.D. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 77-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Yeast strain YBS40 (Mata leu2 ade2 trp1 his3 ura3 can1 abd1::hisG p360-ABD1[CEN URA3 ABD1]) was transformed with CEN TRP1 plasmids containing the wild-type and mutant alleles of ECM1. Trp+ isolates were selected and then streaked on agar plates containing 0.75 mg/ml 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA). Growth was scored after 7 days of incubation at 25, 30, and 37 °C. Lethal mutants were those that failed to form colonies on 5-FOA at any temperature. Individual colonies of the viable ECM1 mutants were picked from the 5-FOA plate and transferred to YPD (yeast extract/peptone/dextrose) agar medium. Two isolates of each mutant were tested for growth on YPD agar at 25, 30, and 37 °C. Growth was assessed as follows: +++ indicates colony size indistinguishable from strains bearing wild-type ECM1; ++ denotes slightly reduced colony size; + indicates that only pinpoint colonies were formed; and– indicates no growth. Mutational Effects on Ecm1 Function in Vivo—NdeI/BamHI fragments encoding Ecm1-Ala mutants K54A, D70A, D78A, D94A, and Y141A were excised from the respective p358-ECM1 plasmids and inserted into pET16b. The pET16-Ecm1-Ala plasmids were introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3). The recombinant Ecm1-Ala proteins were produced and purified from soluble bacterial lysates as described above for wild-type Ecm1. Crystal Structure of Ecm1 Bound to aza-AdoMet—Ecm1 was produced for crystallographic analysis as reported previously (21Fabrega C. Hausmann S. Shen V. Shuman S. Lima C.D. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 77-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Ecm1 was incubated with 1 mm aza-AdoMet for 30 min prior to crystallization by vapor diffusion against a well solution containing 1.2 m sodium/potassium tartrate, 50 mm bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino-tris(hydroxymethyl)methane (pH 6.0 or 6.25), and 20 mm DTT. Crystals were cryoprotected with well solution containing 18% glycerol. Crystals diffracted x-rays to 2.2 Å (P3121, a = b = 63.25 Å, c = 111.84 Å, α = β = 90°, γ = 120°). Data were collected at National Synchrotron Light Source beamline X4A (Brookhaven, NY) using an ADSC quantum-4 charge-couple device detector. Data were reduced with DENZO, SCALEPACK (24Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38252) Google Scholar), and CCP4 (25Project Collaborative Computational Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19667) Google Scholar) software. The Ecm1·aza-AdoMet complex was isomorphous to the previously determined crystal structures of Ecm1 (21Fabrega C. Hausmann S. Shen V. Shuman S. Lima C.D. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 77-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Electron density maps were interpreted using O software (26Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

The coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession code 1Z3C). Methyltransferase Activity of Recombinant Ecm1—Ecm1 was produced in E. coli as a His10-Ecm1 fusion and purified from a soluble extract by nickel-affinity chromatography. The His10-Ecm1 protein was adsorbed to the resin and recovered in the 100–500 mm imidazole eluate fractions (Fig. 1A). Further characterization of Ecm1 was performed using the 250 mm imidazole fraction. The quaternary structure was examined by zonal velocity sedimentation in a 15–30% glycerol gradient. Marker proteins catalase (native size 248 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa) and cytochrome c (12 kDa) were included as internal standards in the gradient. After centrifugation, the polypeptide compositions of the odd numbered gradient fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. His10-Ecm1 (calculated to be a 40-kDa polypeptide) sedimented as a discrete peak (fractions 19–21) between bovine serum albumin and cytochrome c (Fig. 1B). The methyltransferase activity was demonstrated by incubating the gradient fractions with 5.4 μm [3H-CH3]AdoMet and 5mm GTP for 60 min at 37 °C, which resulted in label transfer from AdoMet to the GTP to form an anionic methylated nucleotide product that was adsorbed to a DEAE filter and thereby separated from the cationic AdoMet substrate (28Barbosa E. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7692-7697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extent of 3H-methyl transfer paralleled the abundance of the Ecm1 polypeptide and peaked at fractions 19–20 (Fig. 1B). These results imply a monomeric structure for Ecm1 in solution, which is consistent with the finding that Ecm1 crystallized as a monomer (21Fabrega C. Hausmann S. Shen V. Shuman S. Lima C.D. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 77-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Methyl transfer by Ecm1 was optimal at pH 7.5 in Tris buffer and declined sharply at pH <6.0 (Fig. 1C). Methyl Acceptor Specificity—Various nucleotides were tested as methyl acceptors at 5 mm concentration (Fig. 2). Ecm1 methylated GTP and dGTP but not ATP, CTP, or UTP (Fig. 2A). Thus, Ecm1 is a guanine-specific methyltransferase that does not discriminate between ribose and deoxyribose nucleoside sugars. The putative reaction product, m7GTP, was not methylated by Ecm1, as expected (Fig. 2B). Failure to methylate ITP indicates that the exocyclic 2′-amine of guanine is essential for substrate recognition. Failure to methylate XTP shows that Ecm1 discriminates between an amine and a carbonyl at position 2 of the purine ring. Methyl transfer to GDP was 40% as effective as that to GTP. 3′-OMeGTP was about one-third as effective as GTP and dideoxy-GTP was one-fourth as effective as GTP (Fig. 2). The dependence of the extent of methyl transfer on GTP concentration is shown in Fig. 3, left panel. From a double-reciprocal plot of the data, we calculated a Km of 1 mm GTP. The cap dinucleotide GpppA was a more effective methyl acceptor than GTP at submillimolar concentrations; from the dependence of methyl transfer on GpppA concentration (Fig. 3, right panel), we calculated a Km of 0.1 mm GpppA. The Km for GDP was 2.4 mm (data not shown). Thus the affinity of Ecm1 for the guanine nucleotide methyl acceptor is enhanced by 2-fold by the γ phosphate of GTP and 10-fold by the 5′-nucleoside of the RNA component of GpppA, a more “physiological” mimic of the presumed GpppRNA substrate. Inhibition by the Product AdoHcy and Substrate Analogs Sinefungin and aza-AdoMet—The chemical structures of the substrate AdoMet and the product AdoHcy are shown in Fig. 4. The extent of GTP methylation by Ecm1 increased with [3H-CH3]AdoMet concentration; from a double-reciprocal plot of the data (not shown), we calculated a Km of 25 μm AdoMet. Activity in the presence of 5.4 μm [3H-CH3]AdoMet was inhibited in a concentration-dependent fashion by AdoHcy; the apparent IC50 for AdoHcy was 4 μm (Fig. 5). We surmise that Ecm1 has similar affinities for the substrate AdoMet and the product AdoHcy.Fig. 5Inhibition of methyltransferase activity. Reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm DTT, 5 mm GTP, 5.4 μm [3H-CH3]AdoMet, 2 μg of Ecm1, and either AdoHcy, aza-AdoMet, carbocyclic aza-AdoMet, or sinefungin, as specified, were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. The extents of methyl transfer to yield DE81-absorbable material are plotted as a function of AdoHcy, aza-AdoMet, carbocyclic aza-AdoMet, or sinefungin concentration.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Sinefungin is an analog of AdoMet that has been shown to have antifungal, antiprotozoal, and antiviral activities (29Ghosh A.K. Liu W. J. Org. Chem. 1996; 61: 6175-6182Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 30Pugh C.S. Borchardt R.T. Stone H.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4075-4077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sinefungin differs from AdoMet in that the S-CH3 sulfonium moiety is replaced by a C-NH2 secondary amine (Fig. 4). Although sinefungin is an inhibitor of a variety of AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases, it has been suggested that its antiviral properties reflect selective inhibition of virus-encoded cap methyltransferases (30Pugh C.S. Borchardt R.T. Stone H.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4075-4077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To our knowledge, the effects of sinefungin on a cellular cap-methylating enzyme have not been reported. Here we found that Ecm1 was inhibited by sinefungin in a concentration-dependent manner, with an apparent IC50 of 1.5 μm (Fig. 5B). We infer than Ecm1 has a 2- to 3-fold higher affinity for sinefungin than it does for AdoMet or AdoHcy. aza-AdoMet is a substrate analog in which the sulfur is replaced by nitrogen (Fig. 4) (31Thompson M.J. Mekhalfia A. Jakeman D.L. Phillips S.E.V. Phillips K. Porter J. Blackburn G.M. Chem. Commun. (Camb.). 1996; : 791-792Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 32Minnick A.A. Kenyon G.L. J. Org. Chem. 1988; 53: 4952-4961Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The carbocyclic derivative of aza-AdoMet has a methylene group in lieu of the ribose O-4 atom (Fig. 4) (23Yang M. Ye M. Schneller S.W. J. Org. Chem. 2004; 69: 3993-3996Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). aza-AdoMet and carbocyclic aza-AdoMet were relatively weak inhibitors of Ecm1, with IC50 values of 100 and 35 μm, respectively (Fig. 5A). Product Analysis—The products of the reaction of Ecm1 with 5 mm GTP and 5.4 μm [3H-CH3]AdoMet were analyzed by polyethyleneimine-cellulose thin layer chromatography (TLC) in parallel with a control reaction from which Ecm1 was omitted (Fig. 6). The chromatogram was developed with 0.2 m ammonium sulfate, which allowed resolution of GTP and m7GTP from AdoMet. The positions of unlabeled nucleotide standards were identified by UV shadowing. The distribution of 3H radioactivity was gauged by cutting the chromatogram into 1-cm strips and quantifying each strip by liquid scintillation counting. Most of the radioactivity in the no-enzyme control comigrated with AdoMet, and there was no radioactivity associated with the guanine nucleotides (Fig. 6, bottom panel). In the presence of Ecm1, the [3H-CH3]AdoMet was depleted and the label transferred to a single product comigrating with the m7GTP standard. About 70% of the input label was converted to m7GTP product in this experiment. The TLC assay was used to gauge the specific activity and kinetics of methyl transfer in reactions containing 50 μm AdoMet, 5 mm GTP, and varying amounts of Ecm1. The AdoMet- and m7GTP-containing portions of the TLC plate were excised, and the distribution of radiolabel was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. The specific activity calculated from the slope of the titration curve in Fig. 7A was ∼2.5 pmol of methyl transfer/pmol of Ecm1. A kinetic analysis showed that methylated GTP product accumulated steadily during a 120-min incubation (Fig. 7B), implying that the enzyme was not inactivated during the incubation and that Ecm1 did not catalyze a rapid burst of methylation, with subsequent rounds limited by slow product release. The initial rate was proportional to Ecm1 concentration. The extent of methyl transfer by the highest level of Ecm1 at 120 min corresponded to 40% of the input [3H-CH3]AdoMet substrate. Structure of Ecm1 in Complex with aza-AdoMet—A structure was determined for Ecm1 in complex with the weak inhibitor aza-AdoMet (Table I and Fig. 8A). The 2.2-Å simulated annealing omit density map of the ligand is shown in Fig. 8B contoured at 1.0σ. aza-AdoMet is bound in a manner virtually identical to that of AdoMet reported previously (21Fabrega C. Hausmann S. Shen V. Shuman S. Lima C.D. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 77-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The adenine base of aza-AdoMet is sandwiched between Tyr-124 and Ile-95 through van der Waals (VDW) contacts. Direct hydrogen bonding interactions are observed between adenine N-6 and Asp-122 O-δ, whereas a more distant hydrogen bond is observed between adenine N-1 and Ser-123 O-γ. The ribose O-2′ and O-3′ atoms are coordinated via bidentate hydrogen bonding to the Asp-94 carboxylate, whereas the ribose O-4′ is in VDW contact with Ser-142. The carboxylate oxygen and amino nitrogen atoms of aza-AdoMet make hydrogen bonds with the Lys-54 N-ζ and the backbone carbonyl oxygen atoms of Gln-140 and Gly-72, respectively. Also, both Asp-70 and Asp-78 O-δ atoms make water-mediated contacts to the amino nitrogen and carbonyl oxygen atoms of aza-AdoMet. Structural comparison of the aza-AdoMet, AdoMet, and AdoHcy complexes with Ecm1 revealed no substantive differences in protein or ligand conformations within coordinate error. Thus, aza-AdoMet is a competitive inhibitor for the methyl donor site on Ecm1.Table ICrystallographic data and refinement statisticsEcm1-AzoAdoMetPDB ID1Z3CSourceNational Synchrotron Light SourceX4AWavelength (Å)0.9790Resolution limits (Å)20-2.2Space groupP3121Unit cell (Å) a, b, c, α, β, γ63.25, 63.25, 111.84, 90, 90, 120Number of observations58,215Number of reflections13,451Completeness (%)97.9 (95.7)dParentheses indicate statistics for the high resolution data bin for x-ray data and refinement.Mean I/σI10.9 (4.9)R-merge on IaRmerge = ΣΣhkl Σi|I(hkl)i — 〈I(hkl)〉|/ΣhklΣi〈I(hkl)i〉.8.4 (33.3)Cut-off criteria I/σI-0.5Refinement StatisticsResolution limits (Å)20-2.2Number of reflections13288Completeness (%)97.2 (93.6)Cutoff criteria I/σI0Protein/ligand/water atoms2062/27/132RcrystbRcryst = Σhkl|Fo(hkl) — Fc(hkl)|/Σhkl|Fo(hkl)|, where Fo and Fc are observed and calculated structure.0.222 (0.424)Rfree (5% of data)0.270 (0.454)Bonds (Å)cValues indicate root-mean-square deviations in bond lengths, bond angles, and B-factors of bonded atoms.0.006Angles (°)cValues indicate root-mean-square deviations in bond lengths, bond angles, and B-factors of bonded atoms.1.1B-factor (mc/sc in Å2)cValues indicate root-mean-square deviations in bond lengths, bond angles, and B-factors of bonded atoms.1.45/2.12a Rmerge = ΣΣhkl Σi|I(hkl)i — 〈I(hkl)〉|/ΣhklΣi〈I(hkl)i〉.b Rcryst = Σhkl|Fo(hkl) — Fc(hkl)|/Σhkl|Fo(hkl)|, where Fo and Fc are observed and calculated structure.c Values indicate root-mean-square deviations in bond lengths, bond angles, and B-factors of bonded atoms.d Parentheses indicate statistics for the high resolution data bin for x-ray data and refinement.

Patients most commonly present dermal papules and/or angioid streaks of the retina, detected during routine eye examination. Angioid streaks are marks of subretinal neovascularization, often accompanied by the loss of central vision, the most severe generally occurring symptom of PXE.

The ABC protein family consists of 48 members in the human genome (13Dean M. The Human ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) Transporter Superfamily. National Library of Medicine, NCBI, Washington, D.

Most of the characterized members of the family are involved in transmembrane transport; binding and hydrolysis of ATP are crucial for their transport-related function (13Dean M.

In this line, the association of the R1268Q allele with variations of plasma triglyceride and the high density lipoprotein cholesterol level has been observed (19Wang J. Near S. Young K. Connelly P.W. Hegele R.A. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 46: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The ABCC6-PXE gene has been mapped to the 16p13.11 chromosomal domain and found to be in a close proximity with tail-to-tail orientation to the ABCC1 gene (12Kool M. van der Linden M. de Haas M. Baas F. Borst P. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 175-182PubMed Google Scholar). There are two pseudogenes (ABCC6psi-1 and ABCC6psi-2) also on the short arm of the Chr16 (20Pulkkinen L. Nakano A. Ringpfeil F. Uitto J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 109: 356-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To date 69 PXE-associated mutations have been identified in the human ABCC6-PXE gene (21Hu X. Plomp A. Wijnholds J.

However, in patients with bona fide PXE, the mutations are often undetectable in the coding region on one of the alleles, although the other allele harbors a recessive mutation (22Gheduzzi D.

Moreover, in addition to the PXE developed due to mutations of the ABCC6-PXE gene, secondary PXE has also been described in patients with chronic hemolytic disorder without mutations of the ABCC6-PXE gene (26Aessopos A. Farmakis D. Loukopoulos D. Blood. 2002; 99: 30-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). These data suggest that polymorphisms and mutations of the transcriptional regulatory region of the gene may contribute to the development of PXE. Intriguingly, nothing is known about the transcriptional regulation of the ABCC6 gene. Here we report the first study on the promoter region of the ABCC6-PXE gene and the two ABCC6 pseudogenes. We identified two highly conserved potential regulatory regions in the 5′ upstream 10-kb sequence of ABCC6 and found that the proximal region is under epigenetic control. Using DNA methylation analysis as a tool to identify important transcriptional regulatory sequences, we were able to locate positive and negative regulatory elements in the proximal region. Moreover, our functional data indicate which of the short regulatory elements may be the targets of epigenetic control of the ABCC6 gene. Materials were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich if not indicated in the text. Cell Culture—HepG2/TS and HepG2/F12 cells are HepG2 cells from two different laboratories. The TS subline was a generous gift from Dr. Sára Tóth (Budapest, Hungary). These and the HL60 (acquired from ATCC) cells were maintained in RPMI medium. The F12 subline was a generous gift from Dr. Ilona Kovalszky (Budapest, Hungary). These cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium enriched with F12. The HEK293 (acquired from ATCC) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. All of the media were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, glutamine and antibiotics. Bisulfite Treatment—After genomic DNA extraction, bisulfite treatment was performed according to the standard protocol (27Frommer M. McDonald L.E. Millar D.S. Collis C.M. Watt F. Grigg G.W. Molloy P.L. Paul C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1827-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (2542) Google Scholar, 28Clark S.J. Harrison J. Paul C.L. Frommer M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2990-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (1627) Google Scholar). Briefly, DNA was denatured by 0.3 m NaOH treatment. Bisulfite solution was added to the samples before overnight incubation at 55 °C. After desalting, the treatment was completed by desulfonation and neutralization. Samples were ethanol-precipitated and used for PCR amplification. PCR, Cloning, and Sequencing of Bisulfite-treated DNA—Fragments B1 (223 bp) and B2 (200 bp) were PCR-amplified by using the following primers: B1–9186bs (5′-TTTTTTAGGTYGGTTGATAGTTTAGGTTT-3′) and –8963as (5′-TAAAACTTCTCCCTATAAACATACACCTT-3′); B2–391bs (5′-TTTTATTAGGATGAATTTTTGGAAATTGTT-3′) and –171bas (5′-TCRAAAAACCCCRAACAAAATCCACTAC-3′). Y stands for C or T and R stands for G or A (note that a methylable CpG cytosine is located at these positions in the original sequence). Degenerate primers were designed to amplify both the methylated and unmethylated sequences (however, CpGs in the primers were not included in the analysis of DNA methylation). The primer pairs were tested by the BiSearch web server for nonspecific PCR amplification (29Tusnady G.E. Simon I. Varadi A. Aranyi T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: E9Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The primers were designed to amplify all three ABCC6 sequences with the same efficiency and to allow the identification of the genes by SNPs in the amplicons. The AmpliTaqGold amplification system (Applied Biosystems) was used for the PCR of bisulfite-treated samples. An initial 10-min-long denaturation at 95 °C was followed by 30 cycles with denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing for 30 s at 56 °C, and 53 °C (for B1 and B2, respectively) and elongation at 72° for 90 s. After A-tailing reaction (carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions), the PCR products were subcloned by T/A cloning into the pGEM-Teasy vector (Promega) and sequenced. PCR Amplification of ABCC6 Transcripts—Total RNA was extracted by the TRIpur extraction kit from human cell lines. The following primers (30Szakacs G. Annereau J.P. Lababidi S. Shankavaram U. Arciello A. Bussey K.J. Reinhold W. Guo Y. Kruh G.D. Reimers M. Weinstein J.N. Gottesman M.M. Cancer Cell. 2004; 6: 129-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) were used to amplify and quantify the ABCC6-PXE mRNA by the LightCycler RNA Master SYBR Green I kit (one-step RT-PCR, Roche Diagnostics): RT3062s (5′-GGCCCGGGCATCCAGGTT-3′) and RT3492as (5′-TTTCATCTACGCGAGCATTGTTCT-3′). Cycling and reaction conditions were set up according to the supplier. Briefly, 150 ng of total RNA per sample was amplified in a Light Cycler. Reverse transcription at 61 °C during 20 min and denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s was followed by 43 cycles of 95 °C for 1 s and 60 °C for 5 s, and 72 °C and a single quantification step after each cycle at 80 °C was included. The expression of all three genes was analyzed in HepG2/F12 cells. Reverse transcription was performed with random hexamers on 1 μg of RNA using the Moloney murine leukemia virus-RT enzyme (Promega). The ABCC6 cDNAs were amplified at the annealing temperature of 60 °C using AmpliTaqGold polymerase (Applied Biosystems). The following nonselective primers were used: RTs144 (5′-TCCCATCTACCTCCTCTTCATC-3′) and RTas430 (5′-AGCAGAGAAGCCAGTAACCAAAC-5′). Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends—The determination of transcription initiation site was carried out according to Frohman (31Frohman M. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols. Academic Press, Inc., Orlando, FL1990: 28-38Google Scholar). Briefly, total cDNA was synthesized as described in the previous section with the specific RTas430 (5′-AGCAGAGAAGCCAGTAACCAAAC-3′) primer instead of random hexamers. The cDNA was subjected to terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (Promega) treatment to create a poly(A) tail on the 3′-ends. Then the cDNA was amplified by Taq polymerase (Promega) with nested primers: Adapter-oligo(dT) (5′-GACTCGAGTCGACATCGAT-3′) (17Uitto J. Pulkkinen L. Ringpfeil F. Trends Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 13-17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and RTas361 (5′-GGAACACTGCGACGCTCATCGTGGTGA-3′) for the first round and the same adapter-oligo(dT) primer with RTas269 (5′-GCGACAGCCACGCTGGAGGTACACA-3′) in the second round. Cycling conditions were as follows for both PCRs: 95 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 90 s for 30 cycles. The PCR products were subcloned by T/A cloning into pGEM-Teasy vector (Promega) and sequenced. Luciferase Assays—Reporter plasmid vectors containing the ABCC6-PXE promoter sequences were constructed by PCR cloning. Human genomic DNA was used as template for amplification. The following sequence-specific primers were designed using Primer3 software (Biology WorkBench): downstream primer GGAAAAGGAGAGTGGGGC (position +72 relative to the translation start site) and upstream primers AGCGACCACAGCAAGAGG (–718), GATTCTTGTTGCAGGGGG (–332), and CGATCCCGGAGCTCGAAT (–145). Restriction sites (KpnI site for upstream primers and HindIII site for downstream primer) were added to the 5′-end of primers, and promoter sequences were amplified using high fidelity thermostable DNA polymerase (TaqPfu mixture OptiTaq from EURx, Gdansk, Poland). PCR products were cloned into the pGL3-Basic vector (Promega) to construct plasmids phABCC6(–718/+72)Luc, phABCC6(–332/+72)Luc, and phABCC6(–145/+72)Luc, respectively. The sequence of the cloned inserts was tested for the amplification of the ABCC6-PXE gene and the lack of errors by automated sequencing. The plasmids were transfected by polyethyleneimine transfection reagent (Exgen500 from Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania). Cells were harvested and lysed 48 h after transfection. The activity of luciferase in cell lysate was determined in a Fluoroskan Ascent FL luminometric plate reader (Labsystems, Vantaa, Finland) using a commercial luciferase substrate (BD Biosciences). Results were normalized for transfection efficiency by cotransfection with a control reporter vector encoding secreted alkaline phosphatase under the control of a constitutive cytomegalovirus-derived promoter (kind gift from Dr. S. Schlatter, Zurich). The level of alkaline phosphatase activity was determined spectrophotometrically. For in vitro methylation of promoter sequences, the relevant sequence regions (corresponding to stretches –332/+72 and –145/+72 in the gene) have been excised from plasmids phABCC6(-332/+72)Luc and phABCC6(-145/+72)Luc using KpnI and HindIII restriction enzymes. The excised DNA molecules were gel-purified and subjected to in vitro methylation using SssI DNA methyltransferase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Full methylation was confirmed by the resistance to HpaII and Hin1I (Fermentas) digestion. The methylated promoter fragments were ligated back into the pGL3-Basic vector, the constructs were transfected into cells, and luciferase activity was measured as described above.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3576-3579Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). In Silico Analysis—To characterize the 5′ regulatory regions of the ABCC6 gene, we first carried out an in silico sequence analysis. The ABCC6-PXE gene is located in the 16p13.11 chromosomal domain and is distanced by only 10 kb from the ABCC1 gene in a tail-to-tail orientation (12Kool M. van der Linden M. de Haas M. Baas F. Borst P. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 175-182PubMed Google Scholar, 40Le Saux O. Urban Z. Goring H.H. Csiszar K. Pope F.M. Richards A. Pasquali-Ronchetti I. Terry S. Bercovitch L. Lebwohl M.G. Breuning M. van den Berg P. Kornet L. Doggett N. Ott J. de Jong P.T. Bergen A.A. Boyd C.D. Genomics. 1999; 62: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The distance between the ABCC6-PXE gene and the pseudogenes ABCC6psi-1 and ABCC6psi-2 is 1.5 and 2 Mb, respectively. Psi-1 is inversely orientated relative to ABCC6-PXE. The positions and orientations of the three ABCC6 genes are shown on Fig. 1A. We have analyzed the 10-kb 5′ upstream regulatory regions of the three ABCC6 genes and found that the identity between the three sequences is ∼99%. However, psi-1 and -2 are truncated after the ninth and fourth exons, respectively (20Pulkkinen L. Nakano A. Ringpfeil F. Uitto J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 109: 356-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The analysis of the 10-kb upstream sequence is summarized on Fig. 1B. It revealed the presence of several short and two long repetitive elements, notably a 1.5-kb long Alu repeat at –8.5 kb and a minisatellite between –4.5 kb and –1 kb (relative to the translation start site) in each gene. Two CG-rich sequences were also detected between –0.5 and +0.2 kb and between –9.6 and –8.9 kb. According to the statistical criteria they were termed CpG islands (CGI) (41Gardiner-Garden M. Frommer M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 261-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (2677) Google Scholar, 42Bird A. Taggart M. Frommer M. Miller O.J. Macleod D. Cell. 1985; 40: 91-99Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Several consensus elements for transcription factor binding sites were found between –10 and –9 kb as well as between the –1 kb and the translation start site. The potential physiological relevance of the putative transcription factor binding sites was analyzed by phylogenetic footprinting. We hypothesized that the most important regulatory sequences are more conserved then the rest of the promoter. Thus, we aligned the human, chimpanzee, dog, mouse, and rat sequences from –10 kb (3 kb was available for the dog gene) relative to the translation start site to the 3′-end of the second exon. The chimpanzee sequence turned out to be uninformative because of its 99% identity with the human sequence in the whole region analyzed. Therefore we focused on the conserved elements of the ABCC6 gene regulatory regions in the four other species. We identified two distinct, evolutionarily highly conserved regions in the 5′ upstream sequences (R1 and R2) embedded in the CGIs (see Fig. 1B). R1 is ∼450 bp long and is located between –9.4 and –8.9 kb from the translation start site of the human ABCC6 gene(s). R2 probably constitutes the proximal promoter; the most conserved segment is between –171 and –40 bp, but the whole region is more extended with several dispersed stretches of highly conserved elements with a background of less conserved sequences and some inserted boxes specific to the human promoter. The R2 region ends at –400 bp, but two more stretches of highly conserved sequences were also found between –593 and –559 and between –730 and –683. The more upstream region of the human sequence considerably diverges from the rodent promoters. Both exon 1 and exon 2 were highly conserved, but only two stretches were conserved in the first intron. Interestingly, although both R1 and R2 regions were scanned for transcription factor binding sites by using various web server predictions (Consite, TESS, TRANS-FAC (36Sandelin A. Wasserman W.W. Lenhard B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W249-W252Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 39Kel A.E. Gossling E. Reuter I. Cheremushkin E. Kel-Margoulis O.V. Wingender E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3576-3579Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar)) combined with our phylogenetic data, no clearcut conserved response elements could be detected. Identification of the Transcription Initiation Site—The transcription initiation sites of the ABCC6 genes were also predicted by several web-based search engines (Promoter 2.0, Eponin (34Knudsen S. Bioinformatics. 1999; 15: 356-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 35Down T.A. Hubbard T.J. Genome Res. 2002; 12: 458-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar)). Once again, no one (or more) clear-cut transcription initiation site(s) was proposed. Therefore, we determined the transcription initiation site experimentally. Total cellular RNA from HepG2/F12 cells was reverse-transcribed with a primer specific for the ABCC6 genes. Then a poly(A) tail was added at the 3′-end of the cDNA, which served later as a sequence for primer annealing during subsequent semi-nested PCR experiments. These PCR products were subcloned and sequenced. The transcription initiation site was found to be located at –37 bp relative to the translation initiation site. Interestingly, none of the search engines predicted this position. Interestingly, this site aligns within 1 bp of the transcriptional start site of the ABCC1 gene, suggesting a similar mechanism of action of the basal transcriptional machinery (43Grant C.E. Kurz E.U. Cole S.P. Deeley R.G. Genomics. 1997; 45: 368-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Expression of the ABCC6 Genes—Next, we investigated ABCC6-PXE gene expression in HEK293, HepG2, and HL60 cell lines by RT-PCR. We used two different HepG2 sublines, HepG2/TS and HepG2/F12, each grown in different culture conditions (see “Materials and Methods”). The ABCC6 mRNA detection was carried out by semi-quantitative RT-PCR with LightCycler technology using the SYBR Green detection method. In this experiment the primer pairs used recognized solely the ABCC6-PXE gene. The same amounts of total cellular RNA were used for each sample, and water was included as the negative control (see Fig. 2). The crossing points were around 31.5 cycles for HEK293, HepG2/F12, and HL60 cells and the negative control, whereas ∼26.5 cycles characterized the HepG2/TS cells. The ABCC6 mRNA was not detected in HL60 (myeloid leukemia) cells. The melting temperature analysis of these PCR products revealed the formation of primer dimers in each sample, but PCR product with the expected size appeared only in the HEK293 and HepG2 cells, as illustrated on Fig. 2. Although these data do not allow precise quantification of the ABCC6 mRNA in the various cell lines, they strongly suggest a significantly higher expression level in the HepG2/TS cells than in the other cell lines. In other experiments we also detected the presence of ABCC6 mRNAs in DLD-1 (colon) and Caco-2 (enterocytes) cells and their absence in KATO (gastric) and HL60 cells (data not shown). Expression of the Pseudogenes—Next we asked whether the pseudogenes may also be transcribed. To answer this question, we performed RT-PCR reactions on the HepG2/F12 cell line. In these experiments we used one common primer pair, since oligos could not be designed to amplify specifically the pseudogenes and ABCC6-PXE cDNAs because of the more than 99% identity of the three sequences. The PCR products were subcloned, and 11 clones were sequenced. Ten of them contained fragments corresponding to cDNAs"

Park, Center for Molecular Medicine, Sungkyunkwan University (Seoul, Korea).Transfection of Panc-1 Pancreatic Cancer Cells and Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—Cells were cultured in 6-well plates in 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. After 16–20 h when cells were 50–60% confluent, siRNA duplexes and/or reporter gene constructs were transfected using Oligofectamine Reagent (Invitrogen). The effects of Tg and Sp siRNAs on transactivation was investigated in Panc-1 cells cotransfected with (500 ng) GRP78 constructs. Briefly, the siRNA duplex was transfected into each well to give a final concentration of 70 nm. Cells were harvested after 48 h, and luciferase activity of lysates (relative to β-galactosidase activity) was determined. For the ER stress study, cells were treated with Me2SO (control) or with the indicated concentration of Tg or Tm for 18 h. For electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), nuclear extracts from Panc-1 cells were isolated as previously described and aliquots were stored at -80 °C until used (31Abdelrahim M. Smith R. II I Burghardt R. Safe S. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 6740-6749Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 32Abdelrahim M. Smith R. II I Safe S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 1373-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar).Western Immunoblot—Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and collected by scraping in 200 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 0.5 m sodium chloride, 1.5 mm magnesium chloride, 1 mm EGTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, and 5 μl/ml of protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). The lysates from the cells were incubated on ice for 1 h with intermittent vortexing followed by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Equal amounts of protein from each treatment group were diluted with loading buffer, boiled, and loaded onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Samples were electrophoresed, and proteins were detected by incubation with polyclonal primary antibodies Sp1 (PEP2), Sp3 (D-20), Sp4 (V-20), TFII-I, GRP78 (H-129), and β-tubulin (H-235) followed by blotting with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody as previously described (31Abdelrahim M. Smith R. II I Burghardt R. Safe S. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 6740-6749Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 32Abdelrahim M. Smith R. II I Safe S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 1373-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). After autoradiography, band intensities were determined by a scanning laser densitometer (Sharp Electronics Corp., Mahwah, NJ) using Zero-D Scanalytics software (Scanalytics Corp., Billerica, MA).EMSA—Wild-type ERSE (wtERSE), mutant ERSE (mERSE), and GC-rich oligonucleotides were synthesized and annealed, and 5-pmol aliquots were 5′-end-labeled using T4 kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. A 30-μl EMSA reaction mixture contained ∼100 mm potassium chloride, 3 μgof crude nuclear protein, or 1–2 band-forming units of human recombinant Sp proteins, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), with or without unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide, and 10 fmol of radiolabeled probe. After incubation for 20 min on ice, antibodies against selected proteins were added and incubated another 20 min on ice. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved by 5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as previously described (31Abdelrahim M. Smith R. II I Burghardt R. Safe S. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 6740-6749Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 32Abdelrahim M. Smith R. II I Safe S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 1373-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Specific DNA-protein and antibody-supershifted complexes were observed as retarded bands in the gel. wtERSE and mERSE sequence used in gel shift analysis are given below. The NF-Y/CBF and YY1 motifs are underlined, and the mutation is in bold: human GRP78, GGG CCA ATG AAC GGC CTC CAA CGA (-94 ERSE (wt)) and GGG CCA ATG AAC TTA CTC CAA CGA (-94 ERSE (m)).Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—Panc-1 cells (2 × 107 cells) were treated with Me2SO (time 0) or 1 μg/ml Tm for the indicated times. Cells were then fixed with 1.5% formaldehyde, and the cross-linking reaction was stopped by addition of 0.125 m glycine. After washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were scraped and pelleted. Collected cells were hypotonically lysed, and nuclei were collected. Nuclei were then sonicated to the desired chromatin length (500–1000 bp). The chromatin was precleared by addition of protein A-conjugated beads and then incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with gentle agitation. The beads were pelleted, and the precleared chromatin supernatant was immunoprecipitated with antibodies to IgG, Sp1, Sp3, Sp4, YY1, NF-Y, TFII-I, TFIIB, and ATF6 at 4 °C overnight. The protein-antibody complexes were collected by addition of protein A-conjugated beads at room temperature for 1 h; the beads were extensively washed, and protein-DNA cross-links were reversed. DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, and PCR was performed on the purified material. The GRP78 primers were as follows: 5′-CGG AGC AGT GAC GTT TAT TG-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACC TCA CCG TCG CCT ACT C-3′ (reverse); and they amplified a 165-bp region of the human GRP78 promoter, which contains the ERSEs. The positive control primers were 5′-TAC TAG CGG TTT TAC GGG CG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCG AAC AGG AGG AGC AGA GAG CGA-3′ (reverse) and amplified a 167-bp region of the human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene. The negative control primers were 5′-ATG GTT GCC ACT GGG GAT CT-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGC CAA AGC CTA GGG GAA GA-3′ (reverse) and amplified a 174-bp region of human CNAP1 exon. PCR products were resolved on a 2% agarose gel in the presence of 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide as described (33Hong J. Samudio I. Liu S. Abdelrahim M. Safe S. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 5774-5785Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance was determined by analysis of variance and Scheffe's test, and the levels of probability are noted. The results are expressed as means ± S.D. for at least three separate (replicate) experiments for each treatment.RESULTSERSEs from various ER stress-responsive genes exhibit a tripartite structure, which includes two motifs that bind NF-Y/CBF and YY1 and flank a central nonanucleotide (N9) sequence that shows some variability in different ERSEs (28Parker R. Phan T. Baumeister P. Roy B. Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3220-3233Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). N9 motifs from most ERSEs are GC-rich, and we hypothesized that Sp family proteins may directly or indirectly influence ER stress-induced gene/protein expression. Results summarized in Fig. 1 show that Tm (0.5 μg/ml) and Tg (0.5 μm) induced GRP78 protein in Panc-1 pancreatic cancer cells, whereas levels of β-tubulin were unaffected by ER stress (Fig. 1A). The potential role of Sp proteins on ER stress-induced GRP78 protein expression was determined in Panc-1 cells transfected with small inhibitory RNAs for Sp1 (iSp1), Sp3 (iSp3), and Sp4 (iSp4) and a nonspecific scrambled (iScr) RNA. Western blot analysis of whole cell lysates from the various treatment groups showed that iScr did not affect Tg-/Tm-induced GRP78 protein, whereas significant inhibition of GRP78 protein levels was observed in lysates from cells transfected with iSp1, iSp3, and iSp4 (Fig. 1B). The order of effectiveness of these siRNAs in decreasing GRP78 protein levels was iSp4 > iSp1 > iSp3. The results in Fig. 1, B and C, also demonstrate that neither Tg or Tm affected Sp protein levels and that the RNA interference assay for Sp protein knockdown is highly selective for Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 as reported previously (31Abdelrahim M. Smith R. II I Burghardt R. Safe S. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 6740-6749Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 32Abdelrahim M. Smith R. II I Safe S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 1373-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 33Hong J. Samudio I. Liu S. Abdelrahim M. Safe S. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 5774-5785Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These data clearly demonstrate that ER stress-induced GRP78 protein expression is dependent on Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4.The direct effects of Sp proteins on GRP78 was further investigated in Panc-1 cells transfected with the plasmid pGRP78, which contains a -374-bp insert derived from the proximal region of the human GRP78 gene promoter. This promoter sequence contains three ERSEs, and treatment with Tg significantly induced transactivation (>3-fold) (Fig. 1D), and this paralleled the induction of GRP78 protein (Fig. 1A). In cells treated with Tg and cotransfected with pGRP78 and iSp1, iSp3, or iSp4, both basal and induced luciferase activities were significantly decreased (Fig. 1D). These results further confirm that Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 play an important role in regulation of a prototypical stress induced gene/protein GRP78. We further examined the role of Sp proteins in stress responses by gel mobility shift assays using the 32P-labeled ERSE, which was identical to ERSE-2 from the GRP78 promoter. The pattern of three retarded bands associated with the YY1 and NF-Y or ERSF-DNA complexes in extracts from control (Me2SO) or Tg (Fig. 2A) was similar to that reported previously (28Parker R. Phan T. Baumeister P. Roy B. Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3220-3233Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). All three bands were decreased after coincubation with 100-fold excess of unlabeled ERSE (lane 5) and YY-1 antibodies immunodepleted the YY-1-ERSE complex (lane 7). Previous studies report that TFII-I was induced by ER stress and bound the ERSF-ERSE complex, and this contributed to the enhanced intensity of the retarded band (28Parker R. Phan T. Baumeister P. Roy B. Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3220-3233Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Incubation of stress-induced Panc-1 cell lysate with 32P-labeled ERSE and TFII-I antibodies decreased intensity of the ERSF-ERSE band (immunodepletion), although a supershifted band was not detected. Tg also induces TFII-I protein levels in Panc-1 cells as reported previously in other cell lines (28Parker R. Phan T. Baumeister P. Roy B. Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3220-3233Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and gel mobility shift assays show that the intensity of the Tg-induced ERSF-DNA complex (lane 6) is significantly decreased after coincubation with increasing amounts of TFII-I antibody (lanes 3–5) (Fig. 2B). Even under these conditions, a supershifted complex was not observed.Fig. 2Protein interactions with ERSE and related oligonucleotides.A, 32P-labeled ERSE binding to nuclear extracts from Panc-1 cells treated with Tg. Nuclear extracts from Me2SO or Tg-treated cells were incubated with 32P-labeled ERSE alone or in combination with 100-fold excess unlabeled ERSE (100X) oligonucleotide, YY1 (αYY1), or TFII-I (αTFII-I) antibodies and separated in a gel mobility shift assay as described under “Materials and Methods.” The specifically bound ERSF, NF-Y, and YY1 complexes are indicated by arrows. B, induction of TFII-I by Tg and gel mobility shift assay. Whole cell lysates from untreated (-) or Tg-treated Panc-1 cells were analyzed by Western blot analysis for TFII-I expression as described under “Materials and Methods.” Nuclear extracts from Tg-treated Panc-1 cells were analyzed by gel mobility shift assays as described in Fig. 2A; however, increasing amounts of TFII-I antibody were used. C, supershift of ERSE-protein complex by Sp protein antibodies. Panc-1 cells were treated with Me2SO and Tg. Nuclear extracts were incubated with 32P-labeled ERSE and Sp1 (αSp1), Sp3 (αSp3), or Sp4 (αSp4) antibodies and separated in a gel mobility shift assay as described under “Materials and Methods.” ERSF, NF-Y, YY1, and Sp protein complexesare indicated by arrows, and the supershifted Sp protein complexes are indicated. D, binding of Sp1 protein to different radiolabeled oligonucleotides. Recombinant Sp1 protein (1 or 2 band-forming units) was incubated with 32P-labeled ERSE, mERSE, or GC oligonucleotides alone or in combination with 100-fold excess unlabeled ERSE oligonucleotide, αIgG, or Sp1 (αSp1) antibodies and separated in a gel mobility shift assay as described under “Materials and Methods.” Sp1-DNA complexes and supershifted complexes are indicated by arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Sp proteins interact directly or indirectly with other transcription factors to modulate gene/protein expression (34Safe S. Kim K. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2004; 77: 1-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Direct interaction of Sp1 protein with the ERSE was investigated in a gel mobility shift assays using 32P-labeled ERSE extracts from Tg-treated Panc-1 cells and Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 antibodies (Fig. 2C, lanes 4–6). Distinct supershifted bands were observed using Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 antibodies (lanes 4–6), and the most pronounced decrease in the intensity of the ERSF-ERSE complex was observed with the Sp1 antibody suggesting that Sp1 protein is the major Sp protein bound to the ERSF-ERSE complex. These results indicate that Sp proteins may directly bind the ERSE, and this was further confirmed in gel mobility shift assays using a series of radiolabeled oligonucleotides and recombinant Sp1 protein. Previous studies indicate that the consensus GC-rich oligonucleotide binds Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 with high affinity (31Abdelrahim M. Smith R. II I Burghardt R. Safe S. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 6740-6749Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 32Abdelrahim M. Smith R. II I Safe S. Mol.

Using the same amount of Sp1 protein, it was clear that the Sp1-GC retarded band was significantly more intense than the Sp1-ERSE band reflecting different Sp protein-DNA binding affinities. However, the results show that Sp1 directly binds the GC and ERSE oligonucleotides, and both retarded bands were supershifted by Sp1 antibody (lanes 4 and 10) but not by nonspecific IgG (lane 11). The mutant ERSE, which did not bind Sp1 (lane 9), contained three specific mutations (underlined) in the nonanucleotide sequence (GAA CTT ACT) in which a TTA sequence replaced the wild-type GGC. Parker et al. (28Parker R. Phan T. Baumeister P. Roy B. Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3220-3233Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) have previously demonstrated the high conservation of the GC-rich sequences in ERSEs from GRP78 and other stress-related genes, and mutation of the GGC sequence greatly decreased stress-induced responses in transactivation assays (16Roy B. Lee A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1437-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 35Marcus N. Green M. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 1123-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The transactivation studies correlated with the loss of Sp protein-ERSE binding observed in this study (Fig. 2D) and complement the functional studies showing that Sp proteins are critical for activation of stress-induced GRP78 (Fig. 1).Previous studies indicate that induction of ER stress is accompanied by cleavage of p90 ATF-6 to p60 ATF-6, a nuclear transcription factor that interacts with NF-Y proteins (21Yoshida H. Okada T. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Negishi M. Mori K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1239-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 22Kokame K. Kato H. Miyata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9199-9205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). TFII-I is also induced by ER stress and interacts with ATF-6 to form part of the ERSE-protein complex (28Parker R. Phan T. Baumeister P. Roy B. Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3220-3233Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We examined Tm-induced protein interactions with the ERSEs of the GRP78 gene promoter by ChIP (Fig. 3A). As a positive control for this experiment, we show that TFIIB interacts with a specific region of the human GAPDH promoter but not the CNAP1 gene exon (Fig. 3B) (33Hong J. Samudio I. Liu S. Abdelrahim M. Safe S. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 5774-5785Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Treatment of Panc-1 cells with Tm for 0 (Me2SO), 15, 30, and 60 min, followed by ChIP assay, showed that Sp1, Sp3, Sp4, NF-Y, and YY1 were constitutively bound to this region of the GRP78 promoter. There were only minimal temporal increases in Sp1 and YY1 binding. In contrast, TFII-I and ATF-6 were not constitutively bound to the ERSE region of the GRP78 promoter but were rapidly recruited to the promoter after treatment with Tm, and both proteins remained bound for up to 60 min. The induction of ATF6 and TFII-I by ER stress (Tm) and their recruitments to the GRP78 promoter in Panc-1 cells are consistent with the important role of these proteins in mediating a stress-induced response (21Yoshida H.

We also investigated the ERSE binding of nuclear extracts from untreated (lane 1) and Tg-treated (lanes 2–5) Panc-1 cells cotransfected with nonspecific scramble RNA (iScr, lanes 1 and 2) and iSp1, iSp3, or iSp4 (lanes 3–5, respectively) (Fig. 3C). The results showed that Sp protein knockdown decreased but did not eliminate intensity of the ERSF-DNA complex, suggesting that stress-induced proteins are retained as part of the complex and do not require Sp proteins for binding.Fig. 3Analysis of protein interactions with GRP78 ERSE and a proposed model.A, transcription factor binding to the GRP78 promoter.

https://openalex.org/W2146100405,"Affinity purification of plasmid DNA is an attractive option for the biomanufacture of therapeutic plasmids, which are strictly controlled for levels of host protein, DNA, RNA, and endotoxin. Plasmid vectors are considered to be a safer alternative than viruses for gene therapy, but milligram quantities of DNA are required per dose. Previous affinity approaches have involved triplex DNA formation and a sequence-specific zinc finger protein. We present a more generically applicable protein-based approach, which exploits the lac operator, present in a wide diversity of plasmids, as a target sequence. We used a GFP/His-tagged LacI protein, which is precomplexed with the plasmid, and the resulting complex was immobilized on a solid support (TALON resin). Ensuing elution gives plasmid DNA, in good yield (>80% based on recovered starting material, 35-50% overall process), free from detectable RNA and protein and with minimal genomic DNA contamination. Such an affinity-based process should enhance plasmid purity and ultimately, after appropriate development, may simplify the biomanufacturing process of therapeutic plasmids."

We found that IL-18 and IL-18Rα bind to glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) glycan via the third mannose 6-phosphate diester and the second β-GlcNAc-deleted mannose 6-phosphate of GPI glycan, respectively. To determine which GPI-anchored glycoprotein is involved in the complex of IL-18 and IL-18Rα, IL-18Rα of IL-18-stimulated KG-1 cells was immunoprecipitated together with CD48 by anti-IL-18Rα antibody. More than 90% of CD48 was detected as β-GlcNAc-deleted GPI-anchored glycoprotein, and soluble recombinant human CD48 without GPI glycan bound to IL-18Rα, indicating that CD48 is associated with IL-18Rα via both the peptide portion and the GPI glycan. To investigate whether the carbohydrate recognition of IL-18 is involved in physiological activities, KG-1 cells were digested with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C before IL-18 stimulation. Phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C treatment inhibited the phosphorylation of tyrosine kinases and the following IL-18-dependent interferon-γ production. These observations suggest that the complex formation of IL-18·IL-18Rα·CD48 via both the peptide portion and GPI glycan triggers the binding to IL-18Rβ, and the IL-18·IL-18Rα·CD48·IL-18Rβ complex induces cellular signaling.

It also has some IFN-γ-independent pro-inflammatory activities because it induces T cells and natural killer cells to synthesize tumor necrosis factor-α, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, nitric oxide, and chemokines (2Micaller M.J. Ohtsuki T. Kohno K. Tanabe F. Ushio S. Namba M. Tanimoto T. Torigoe K. Fujii M. Ikeda M. Fukuda S. Kurimoto M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). It has been reported that IL-18 binds to IL-18 receptor (IL-18R) α and β and that this induces signal transduction pathways that may involve nuclear factor-κB (3Robinson D. Shibuya K. Mui A. Zonin F.

Matsumoto S. Koide K. Takeuchi M. Ikeda M. Ohta T. Kurimoto M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (4Tsuji-Takayama K. Matsumoto S. Koide K. Takeuchi M. Ikeda M. Ohta T. Kurimoto M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which the formation of IL-18·IL-18Rα·IL-18Rβ complex leads to intracellular signal transduction remains unclear. Our laboratory has been interested in the carbohydrate recognition activities of various cytokines because we speculate that sugar chains recognized by these cytokines may function as immunomodulators (5Fukushima K. Ishiyama C. Yamashita K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 426: 298-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We previously reported that IL-1β specifically recognizes GPI anchor glycans (6Fukushima K. Hara-Kuge S. Ohkura T. Seko A. Ideo H. Inazu T. Yamashita K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10579-10584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). IL-18 has been classified as a member of the IL-1 family on the basis of its structural similarity to IL-1β (7Kumar S. McDonnell P.C. Lehr R. Tierney L. Tzimas M.N. Griswold D.E. Capper E.A. Tal-Singer R. Wells G.I. Doyle M.L. Young P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10308-10314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Thus, here we investigated whether IL-18 also has carbohydrate binding ability. We found that like IL-1β, IL-18 recognizes GPI anchor glycans and that it specifically binds to the third mannose 6-phosphate diester, and this binding is inhibited by the addition of mannose 6-phosphate. Furthermore, it was found that IL-18Rα also recognizes GPI anchor glycans and that IL-18Rα specifically binds to the exposed second mannose 6-phosphate. To elucidate the physiological significance of the GPI anchor glycan binding ability of both IL-18 and IL-18Rα, we investigated the effect of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) treatment on the IL-18-stimulated tyrosine-phosphorylation of KG-1 cells. We found that PI-PLC treatment diminished intracellular signaling and IFN-γ production. It seems that GPI anchor glycan recognition by IL-18 and IL-18Rα induces formation of the IL-18·IL-18Rα·GPI anchor glycan complex, and this complex immediately binds to IL-18Rβ and induces intracellular signal transduction. Analysis of the IL-18Rα or IL-18Rβ immunoprecipitates of IL-18-treated KG-1 cells revealed the presence of a single 47-kDa GPI-anchored protein, CD48, in the complex, and CD48 bound to IL-18Rα via both GPI anchor glycan and the specific peptide sequence. Thus, it appears that IL-18, IL-18Rα, and CD48 complex formation via GPI glycan and the specific peptide sequences triggers binding to IL-18Rβ and thereby induces intracellular signal transduction and IFN-γ production. Materials and Chemicals—rhIL-18 was purchased from Medical & Biological Laboratories Co., Ltd. (Nagoya, Japan). l-[35S]Methionine (1175 Ci/mmol) was purchased from MP Biomedicals, Inc. Ribonuclease B, thyroglobulin, ovalbumin, transferrin, fetuin, mannose 6-phosphate, mannose 1-phosphate, glucose 6-phosphate, myo-inositol 1-phosphate, mannose 6-sulfate, N-acetylglucosamine 1-phosphate, and ethanolamine phosphate were purchased from Sigma. Mannitol 6-phosphate was prepared by NaBH4 reduction of mannose 6-phosphate. The soluble form of human placental alkaline phosphatase (shAP) was purified according to the previously reported methods (8Ogata S. Hayashi Y. Takami N. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10489-10494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). T-H glycoprotein was prepared from pooled urine, as described previously (9Tamm I. Horsfall Jr., F.L. J. Exp. Med. 1952; 95: 71-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was kindly provided by Dr. M. Kuroki (Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan). Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→2Manα1→6-(Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→2Manα1→3)Manβ1→4GlcNAc was purified from the urine of patients with GM1 gangliosidosis (10Yamashita K. Ohkura T. Okada S. Yabuuchi H. Kobata A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 4789-4798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preparation of 35S-rhIL-18—cDNA encoding human IL-18 was kindly provided by Hayashibara Co. Ltd. The pET3a plasmid (Novagen, Inc., Madison, WI) was used as the T7 expression plasmid. A SalI-EcoRI fragment corresponding to the human IL-18 gene was inserted between the SalI and EcoRI sites of pET3a to produce the expression plasmid pET3a-IL-18. This was used as a template for in vitro transcription and translation in Puresystem® (Post Genome Institute Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) in the presence of [35S]methionine. The in vitro transcription and translation was accomplished as described in the manufacturer's instructions. An aliquot of the translation products was subjected to SDS-PAGE using 15% polyacrylamide gels and autoradiographed. The translation products were separated from free [35S]methionine using a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences) with PBS and used immediately. Reactions using 1 pmol of plasmid DNA template and 30 μCi of [35S]methionine reproducibly provided 150 pmol of 35S-rhIL-18. Binding Assays of IL-18 or IL-18R to Glycoproteins—The binding of 35S-rhIL-18 to various glycoproteins was measured by solid-phase binding assays. Thus, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates (Corning, Inc., Corning, NY) were coated with glycoproteins at 10 μg/ml in PBS at 4 °C overnight. The plates were washed with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS, blocked with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 1% human serum albumin, and then treated with 1–5 × 104 dpm of 35S-IL-18 (1–5 pmol) in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 0.1% human serum albumin at 37 °C for 2 h. After washing with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS, the bound 35S-rhIL-18 was released by treatment with 100 μl of 1% SDS, and the radioactivity was measured by means of a liquid scintillation counter. The protein concentration used to coat the plates was determined by experiments using various concentrations up to 1 mg/ml. To hydrolyze the GlcNAc-phosphodiester linkage and the Neu5Acα2→3Gal linkages of shAP, shAP was treated with acid as follows (11Fukushima K. Ikehara Y. Kanai M. Kochibe N. Kuroki M. Yamashita K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36296-36303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar): 10 μg of shAP was incubated in 50 μl of 0.01 N HCl at 100 °C for 30 min, after which the pH was adjusted to 7, and de-GlcNAc-shAP was prepared. An aliquot of de-GlcNAc-shAP was also treated with phosphatase. To do this, the pH of the de-GlcNAc-shAP solution was first adjusted to pH 8 followed by incubation with a 20-μl slurry of bovine intestine alkaline phosphatase-immobilized beads (Sigma) at 37 °C for 1 h. The beads were then removed by centrifugation (1000 × g, 30 s) to generate de-GlcNAc-phosphate-shAP. In the case of IL-18Rα, the plates were blocked with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and then incubated with various concentrations of the IL-18Rα-Fc chimera or IL-18Rβ-Fc chimera (R&D Systems) in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 0.1% BSA. Bound IL-18Rα or IL-18Rβ was treated with mouse anti-human IgG Fc antibody (Sigma) and anti-mouse IgG antibody-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Amersham Biosciences) and detected with TMB (tetramethylbenzidine) solution (Wako Chemicals). Cell Culture—KG-1 human leukemia cells (RCB1166) were obtained from the RIKEN Cell Bank (Ibaraki, Japan) and maintained in complete RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 IU/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The cells were cultured until the cell density reached 1 × 106 cells/ml, after which the culture was split. IFN-γ Production of KG-1 Cells Stimulated by IL-18 —For the bioassay, cells were resuspended in complete medium at a cell density of 1 × 106 cells/ml and plated out in microtiter plates at 100 μl/well. Thereafter, 100 μl of rhIL-18 at various concentrations diluted in complete RPMI 1640 medium was added. The cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere, after which an IFN-γ enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed by using a human IFN-γ enzyme immunoassay kit (Beckman Coulter Co.). To investigate the efffect of mannose 6-phosphate, rhIL-18 and mannose 6-phosphate at various concentrations were mixed and preincubated at 37 °C for 30 min before being added to cells. To investigate the effect of PI-PLC, KG-1 cells (1 × 106 cells/100 μl PBS) were incubated with 5 milliunits/ml PI-PLC in PBS at 37 °C for 60 min before IL-18 stimulation. Detection of Tyrosine-phosphorylated Proteins in IL-18-stimulated KG-1 Cells—KG-1 cells (1 × 107 cells) were incubated in the presence or absence of rhIL-18 (10 ng/ml) at 37 °C for 20 min. To investigate the effect of PI-PLC, cells were treated with PI-PLC (5 milliunits/ml, 37 °C for 60 min) before IL-18 stimulation. After incubation, the cells were harvested, washed twice in PBS, and boiled for 10 min in the sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. After transfer onto nitrocellulose membrane, the blots were incubated with a biotinylated anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (Upstate Inc.) followed by avidin-conjugated peroxidase and visualized by means of the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Identification of the GPI-anchored Protein Involved in the IL-18·IL-18Rα·IL-18Rβ Complex—KG-1 cells (1 × 107 cells) were solubilized with 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and Halt™ Protease inhibitor mixture kit (Pierce). The IL-18Rα and IL-18Rβ subunits of IL-18-stimulated KG-1 cells were immunoprecipitated by using goat anti-IL-18Rα and goat anti-IL-18Rβ antibodies (R&D System) and protein G-immobilized resin (Amersham Biosciences). After SDS-PAGE using a 10.5% acrylamide gel and blotting onto a nitrocellulose filter, the GPI-anchored protein involved in the high-affinity complex of IL-18·IL-18Rα·IL-18Rβ was probed by proaerolysin, mouse anti-proaerolysin antibody (Protox Biotech), and HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (12Nelson K.L. Buckley T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19839-19843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and visualized by using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). CD48 was detected by the mouse anti-CD48 antibody (Serotec Ltd.) and HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody. Preparation of Soluble CD48 without GPI Glycan—A cDNA encoding the full open reading frame of CD48 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from KG-1 cell cDNAs, which were prepared using the Super-Script™ preamplification system for first-strand cDNA synthesis (Invitrogen). The primers used were 5′-atggatccCACTTGGTACATATGACC (forward primer) and 5′-tgaagcttTCAGGTAAGTAACAGGCC (reverse primer) for CD48. The sequences shown in lowercase letters reveal appropriate restriction sites. The amplified cDNA was digested with BamHI and HindIII and cloned into pColdI (Takara Bio Inc., Tokyo, Japan). The sequence of the resulting plasmid was confirmed using an Applied Biosystems Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer (PE Biosystems). The plasmid was transformed with Escherichia. coli BL21 strain. Luria-Bertani broth with 100 μg/ml ampicillin was inoculated with the overnight culture of the transformed E. coli. When the absorbance at 600 nm reached a value of 0.5, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the cultures were allowed to stand at 15 °C for 24 h. The bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 15 min. Cell pellets were resuspended and disrupted using a sonicator in PBS. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min, the supernatant was applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Amersham Biosciences). After washing the column with 50 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 8.0) containing 20 mm imidazole, CD48 was eluted with 50 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 8.0) containing 250 mm imidazole. The purified CD48 was dialyzed against PBS and checked using SDS-PAGE. Protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad Protein Assay dye reagent and bovine serum albumin as a standard. Binding Assay of Soluble CD48 to IL-18Rα or IL-18Rβ—The binding of soluble CD48 to IL-18Rα or IL-18Rβ was measured by a solid-phase binding assay. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates were coated with CD48 (10 μg/ml) in PBS at 4 °C overnight. The plates were washed with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS, blocked with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 3% BSA, and then incubated with various concentrations of the IL-18Rα-Fc chimera or IL-18Rβ-Fc chimera in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 0.1% BSA. Bound IL-18Rα or IL-18Rβ was treated with goat anti-IL-18Rα antibody or goat anti-IL-18Rβ antibody (R&D Systems) and HRP-conjugated anti-goat IgG antibody (Amersham Biosciences) and detected with TMB solution. To investigate the inhibitory effect of anti-CD48 antibody, the plates were treated with mouse anti-CD48 antibody after blocking with BSA. Separation of GPI-anchored Proteins by PVL Column Chromatography—GPI-anchored glycoproteins on KG-1 cells were released by digestion with PI-PLC (5 milliunits/ml PBS) at 37 °C for 1 h. Released GPI-anchored proteins were applied to a PVL-Sepharose column. PVL was obtained from Wako Chemicals. PVL-Sepharose (3 mg/ml) was prepared from PVL and CNBr-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). After flow-through components were collected, bound components were eluted with PBS containing 0.3 m GlcNAc. Both components were applied to a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences) for desalting and freeze-dried. After SDS-PAGE using 10.5% acrylamide gel and blotting onto nitrocellulose membrane, CD48 was detected using mouse anti-CD48 antibody and HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody. Before blotting, total protein was stained with SYPRO® Orange (Bio-Rad). IL-18 Binds to the GPI-anchored Protein shAP—We previously reported that IL-1β is able to bind to carbohydrates and that it recognizes the GPI anchor glycan (6Fukushima K. Hara-Kuge S. Ohkura T.

Because IL-1β shares amino acid sequence homology with IL-18, we investigated whether IL-18 also has carbohydrate binding activity. First, we performed binding assays using plates coated with 10 μg/ml ribonuclease B (13Liang C-J. Yamashita K. Kobata A. J. Biochem.

Because BSA resulted in relatively high nonspecific binding, we used human serum albumin as the blocking reagent. We prepared 35S-rhIL-18 by in vitro translation in the presence of [35S]methionine followed by separation from excess [35S]methionine by PD-10 column chromatography. The resulting 35S-rhIL-18 protein was immediately used in the binding assays. We found that 35S-rhIL-18 bound to shAP (Fig. 1A; Fig. 2B, ○), T-H glycoprotein (Fig. 1B), and CEA (Fig. 1C) in a dose-dependent manner. The binding of 35S-rhIL-18 to plates coated with 10 μg/ml CEA, shAP, or T-H glycoprotein was concentration-dependent up to 2 × 104 dpm/100 μl. These bindings did not change in the presence of 1 mm EDTA, which shows that the binding of IL-18 to shAP does not require divalent cations. Thus, IL-18 appears, like IL-1β (6Fukushima K.

Ikehara Y. Kanai M. Kochibe N. Kuroki M. Yamashita K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36296-36303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Consequently, we used this protein to more precisely determine the carbohydrate binding specificity of IL-18. To do this, we investigated the inhibitory effects on the binding of 35S-rhIL-18 to shAP of haptenic sugars derived from the GPI anchor glycan of shAP. The saccharides tested and their inhibitory effects are summarized in Table I. The biantennary sugar chain of shAP, which is an asialo-N-linked sugar chain, was not inhibitory at concentrations of up to 1 mm. In contrast, mannose 6-phosphate, which is a constituent of the GPI anchor glycan of shAP, was an effective inhibitor. However, other constituents of the GPI anchor glycan of shAP, such as ethanolamine phosphate, inositol phosphate, and GlcNAcβ1-phosphate, were not inhibitory up to 1 mm. In addition, mannose 6-sulfate, mannose 1-phosphate, glucose 6-phosphate, and mannitol-6-phosphate were not inhibitory at concentrations up to 1 mm, which indicate that mannose substituted with phosphate at the C-6 position is necessary for the carbohydrate binding of IL-18.Table IAbility of haptenic sugars to inhibit the binding of 35S-rhIL-18 to shAPHaptenic oligosaccharideConcentration needed for 50% inhibitionMannose 6-phosphate10-6 mGal2·GlcNAc2·Man3·GlcNAcNDaND, an inhibitory effect was not detected even when up to 1 mm of the haptenic oligosaccharide was presentEthanolamine phosphateNDInositol phosphateNDGlcNAc-1-phosphateNDMannose-6-sulfateNDMannose-1-phosphateNDGlucose-6-phosphateNDMannitol-6-phosphateNDa ND, an inhibitory effect was not detected even when up to 1 mm of the haptenic oligosaccharide was present Open table in a new tab These observations led us to speculate that IL-18 recognizes a mannose 6-phosphate diester moiety in GPI anchor glycans. To test this, we removed the second mannose 6-phosphate diester of shAP by mild acid and phosphatase treatment and performed the IL-18-binding assay again. Because de-GlcNAc shAP and de-GlcNAcβ1→phosphate shAP maintained their ability to bind to 35S-rhIL-18 (Fig. 2B, • and □), it appears that IL-18 specifically binds to the third mannose 6-phosphate diester in the GPI anchor glycan. The Binding of IL-18 to the GPI Anchor Glycan Modulates IFN-γ Production and Intracellular Tyrosine Phosphorylation of IL-18-stimulated KG-1 Cells—It is known that human leukemia KG-1 cells produce IFN-γ when they are stimulated with IL-18 (1Okamura H. Tsutsi H. Komatsu T. Yutsudo M. Hakura A. Tanimoto T. Torigoe K. Okura T. Nukada Y. Hattori K. Nature. 1995; 378: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (2411) Google Scholar). To determine whether the recognition of the GPI anchor glycan by IL-18 is important for the expression of its physiological functions, we assessed the ability of mannose 6-phosphate and PI-PLC to block the stimulatory effects of IL-18 on the production of IFN-γ production by KG-1 cells. First, we confirmed that incubation of KG-1 cells (1 × 105 cells/well) for 24 h in the presence of rhIL-18 indeed induced them to produce IFN-γ in a rhIL-18-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). Because 10 ng/ml IL-18 was sufficient to stimulate IL-18-dependent IFN-γ production, the following experiments were performed at this concentration. As shown in Fig. 3B, mannose 6-phosphate inhibited the IFN-γ production of KG-1 cells, although 10-5 m mannose 6-phosphate was not sufficient to inhibit all the activity. These results suggest that mannose 6-phosphate competes for IL-18 binding to the GPI anchor glycans on the cell surface and thereby suppresses the IL-18-induced physiological activity of KG-1 cells. Furthermore, removal of the GPI-anchored proteins on KG-1 cells by PI-PLC treatment inhibited the rhIL-18-stimulated IFN-γ production (Fig. 3B) and tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 4). These results indicate that IL-18 binding of the third mannose 6-phosphate diester in the GPI-anchor glycan is at least required to enhance IL-18-dependent intracellular signal transduction and IFN-γ production.Fig. 4Effect of PI-PLC treatment on IL-18-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation in KG-1 cells. Phosphorylated tyrosines were detected with an anti-phosphorylated tyrosine antibody as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The white arrowhead indicates protein whose tyrosine phosphorylation has been enhanced by IL-18 treatment.

Jee J. Shikano H. Mishima M. Ohki I. Ohnishi H. Li A. Hashimoto K. Matsukuma E. Omoya K. Yamamoto Y. Yoneda T. Hara T. Kondo N. Shirakawa M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 966-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), we speculated that IL-18Rα may interact with the second mannose 6-phosphate diester of the GPI anchor glycan. To test this notion, we coated plates with intact shAP, de-β-GlcNAc-shAP, and de-GlcNAcβ1→phosphate-shAP and assessed the binding of the IL-18Rα-Fc chimera by using a mouse anti-human IgG Fc antibody and HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Fig. 5). We found that IL-18Rα only bound to de-β-GlcNAc-shAP in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5A, •) and did not recognize intact shAP or de-GlcNAcβ1→phosphate-shAP (Fig. 5A, ○ and □); on the other hand, IL-18Rβ did not show any binding ability to these shAP derivatives (Fig. 5B). These results suggest that both IL-18 and IL-18Rα can recognize the GPI anchor glycan, although they have different binding specificities. Thus, IL-18 binds to the third mannose 6-phosphate diester, whereas IL-18Rα binds to the second mannose 6-phosphate. Identification of the GPI-anchored Protein Involved in the Complex of IL-18·IL-18Rα·IL-18Rβ—If IL-18 and IL-18Rα binding to a GPI-anchored glycoprotein triggers the formation of the IL-18·IL-18Rα·IL-18Rβ complex, a specific GPI-anchored glycoprotein should be co-immunoprecipitated with IL-18Rα or IL-18Rβ in lysates of IL-18-stimulated KG-1 cells. To identify the GPI-anchored protein recognized by IL-18 and IL-18Rα, the IL-18·IL-18Rα·IL-18Rβ complex was immunoprecipitated by using anti-IL-18Rα or IL-18Rβ antibody, and the co-immunoprecipitated GPI-anchored protein was detected by using proaerolysin, which specifically binds to GPI-anchor glycans (11Fukushima K. Ikehara Y. Kanai M. Kochibe N. Kuroki M. Yamashita K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36296-36303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Only a single 47-kDa protein was detected as a GPI-anchored protein in the anti-IL-18Rα antibody or anti-IL-18Rβ antibody immunoprecipitates in lysates of IL-18-stimulated KG-1 cells (Fig. 6A, lanes 3 and 5). However, the immunoprecipitates using rabbit IgG instead of anti-IL-18Rα or anti-IL-18Rβ antibody were not stained by proaerolysin (Fig. 6A, lanes 6 and 7). Because whole GPI-anchored proteins in KG-1 cells were detected as shown in lane 1 of Fig. 6A, it appears that this 47-kDa protein is specifically involved in the IL-18·IL-18Rα·IL-18Rβ complex. We also confirmed that IL-18Rβ was co-immunoprecipitated with IL-18Rα by staining the immunoprecipitates with anti-IL-18Rβ antibody in IL-18-stimulated KG-1 cells; moreover, IL-18Rα was co-immunoprecipitated with IL-18Rβ (data not shown). It has been reported that CD48 is one of the GPI-anchored proteins on T cells and associates with protein kinase p56lck (22Stefanova I. Horejsi V. Ansotegui I.J. Knapp W. Stockinger H. Science. 1991; 254: 1016-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). We found that an anti-CD48 antibody stained the immunoprecipitates that were generated by using anti-IL-18Rα or anti-IL-18Rβ antibodies (Fig. 6B, lanes 8–11); on the other hand, the immunoprecipitates using rabbit IgG were not stained by anti-CD48 antibody (Fig. 6B, lanes 12 and 13). In the absence of IL-18, CD48 was weakly detected in the immunoprecipitate by using anti-IL-18Rα antibody or anti-IL-18Rβ antibody (Fig. 6B, lanes 8 and 10). Therefore, CD48 seems to be a GPI-anchored protein that weakly associates with IL-18Rα. GPI Anchor Glycan of CD48 Lacks βGlcNAc—CD48 was specifically immunoprecipitated with IL-18Rα, although many GPI-anchored glycoproteins exist on the cell surface. In order to determine why CD48 specifically binds to IL-18Rα, we investigated whether CD48 has βGlcNAc-deleted GPI glycan or whether the CD48 protein portion interacts with IL-18Rα. After KG-1 cells were treated with PI-PLC, released GPI-anchored glycoproteins were subjected to PVL-Sepharose column chromatography, which specifically recognizes the βGlcNAc residue (23Kochibe N. Matta K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 173-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately half of GPI-anchored proteins flowed through the column (PVL- component), and the remainder was eluted with 0.3 m GlcNAc (PVL+ component) (Fig. 7, lanes 1 and 2). Both PVL- and PVL+ components were applied to SDS-PAGE, blotted, and immunostained with anti-CD48 antibody. More than 90% of CD48 molecules were PVL- components (Fig. 7, lanes 3 and 4), suggesting that most CD48 molecules have βGlcNAc-deleted GPI glycan and can bind to IL-18Rα. CD48 Binds to IL-18Rα via Both GPI Glycan and the Peptide Portion—Sequentially, to elucidate whether the protein portion in CD48 also interacts with IL-18Rα, soluble recombinant human CD48 (srhCD48) without GPI glycan was prepared, and we assayed the binding ability between IL-18Rα and srhCD48 without GPI glycan by using a solid-phase binding assay. IL-18Rα bound to srhCD48-coated plates dose-dependently, and the binding was inhibited by the addition of anti-CD48 antibody (Fig. 8A). On the other hand, IL-18Rβ could not bind to srhCD48 (Fig. 8B). These results suggested that only CD48 was associated with IL-18Rα because CD48 could bind to IL-18Rα via both GPI glycan and the protein portion of CD48. We clearly demonstrated in this study that both IL-18 and IL-18Rα have carbohydrate recognition abilities and that each of them separately recognizes a different site in the GPI anchor glycan of CD48. Although IL-18 and IL-18Rα recognize common epitope of various GPI-anchored glycoproteins, IL-18Rα may selectively bind to CD48 via both the specific peptide sequence and GPI glycan. We also showed that mannose 6-phosphate or PI-PLC treatment inhibits the response of KG-1 cells to IL-18 stimulation in terms of IFN-γ secretion and intracellular tyrosine phosphorylation and that this may inhibit the binding of CD48 to IL-18Rα and IL-18. These results also suggested that CD48 binding to IL-18Rα via the peptide portion was not strong enough to retain the association after inhibition of binding via GPI glycan. As previously reported, IL-18 induces signal transduction pathways that may involve nuclear factor-κB (3Robinson D. Shibuya K. Mui A. Zonin F. Murphy E. Sana T. Hartley S.B. Menon S. Kastelein R. Bazan F. O'Garra A. Immunity. 1997; 7: 571-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar), p56lck (4Tsuji-Takayama K. Matsumoto S. Koide K. Takeuchi M. Ikeda M. Ohta T. Kurimoto M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and MAPK (4Tsuji-Takayama K. Matsumoto S. Koide K. Takeuchi M. Ikeda M. Ohta T. Kurimoto M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It has not been shown that p56lck and MAPK associate with IL-18Rα and IL-18Rβ, but p56lck has been reported to associate with CD48 (22Stefanova I. Horejsi V. Ansotegui I.J. Knapp W. Stockinger H. Science. 1991; 254: 1016-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar, 24Garnett D. Barclay A.N. Carmo A.M. Beyers A.D. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 26: 2540-2544Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This in turn suggests that CD48 is an integral component of the signal-transducing IL-18 complex. Because it is known that the IL-18·IL-18Rα complex binds to IL-18Rβ (21Kato Z. Jee J. Shikano H. Mishima M. Ohki I. Ohnishi H. Li A. Hashimoto K. Matsukuma E. Omoya K. Yamamoto Y. Yoneda T. Hara T. Kondo N. Shirakawa M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 966-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), it is likely that after IL-18Rα, IL-18, and CD48 form a complex on the cell surface, this complex immediately binds to IL-18Rβ, as presented in the model shown in Fig. 9, and that this leads to signal transduction and IFN-γ production. This is the first report showing that a GPI anchor glycan of CD48 may actually be essential for the delivery of the IL-18 signal. We found that IL-18 binds to the third mannose 6-phosphate diester, whereas IL-18Rα binds to the second exposed mannose 6-phosphate of GPI glycan. On the other hand, >90% of CD48 does not have GlcNAcβ1→phosphate→6 mannose residue (Fig. 8), although GlcNAcβ1→phosphate residue is a common epitope of GPI glycan (11Fukushima K. Ikehara Y. Kanai M. Kochibe N. Kuroki M. Yamashita K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36296-36303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Because a β-N-acetylglucosamine residue of the GlcNAcβ1→phosphate→6 mannose residue must be removed to be recognized by IL-18Rα, the β-N-acetylglucosamine residue that protects the exposure of the second mannose 6-phosphate diester in the GPI anchor glycan may regulate the IL-18-dependent immune response. As a result, we are currently determining whether a GlcNAcβ1→phosphate-specific β-N-acetylglucosaminidase is secreted together with IL-18 by stimulated macrophages. The inhibitory effect of mannose 6-phosphate on the IL-18-stimulated production of IFN-γ by KG-1 cells was very weak (its 50% inhibitory concentration was 10-5 m). However, we could not use more than 10-5 m mannose 6-phosphate because it changed the pH of the medium. It is likely that mannose 6-phosphate does not efficiently inhibit the recognition by IL-18 or IL-18Rα of the endogenous GPI anchor glycan in CD48 because the endogenous GPI anchor glycan is a rather strong ligand compared with exogenous mannose 6-phosphate. Although both tumor necrosis factor-α and IL-18 recognize the GPI anchor glycan, they bind to different sites because tumor necrosis factor-α binds the second mannose 6-phosphate diester (5Fukushima K. Ishiyama C. Yamashita K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 426: 298-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), whereas IL-18 binds the third mannose 6-phosphate diester. These observations indicate that different cytokines may have precise and unique carbohydrate binding specificities. IL-1β and IL-18 have moderate sequence similarity (7Kumar S. McDonnell P.C. Lehr R. Tierney L. Tzimas M.N. Griswold D.E. Capper E.A. Tal-Singer R. Wells G.I. Doyle M.L. Young P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10308-10314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), and the receptors for IL-1β and IL-18 belong to the IL-1 receptor family (25Born T.L. Smith D.E. Garka K.E. Renshaw B.R. Bertles J.S. Sims J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The intracellular signaling pathways of IL-1β and IL-18 also share the same downstream mediators (3Robinson D. Shibuya K. Mui A. Zonin F. Murphy E. Sana T. Hartley S.B. Menon S. Kastelein R. Bazan F. O'Garra A. Immunity. 1997; 7: 571-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Because IL-1β also recognizes GPI anchor glycans (6Fukushima K. Hara-Kuge S. Ohkura T. Seko A. Ideo H. Inazu T. Yamashita K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10579-10584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we are now investigating whether the mechanism by which IL-1β recognizes the GPI anchor glycan is equivalent to that of IL-18. GPI-anchored proteins are widely distributed on the cell surface (26McConville M.J. Ferguson M.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 305-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). GPI anchor glycans are essential for embryogenesis and skin development in mice (27Tarutani M. Itami S. Okabe M. Ikawa M. Tezuka T. Yoshikawa K. Kinoshita T. Takeda J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7400-7405Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), and GPI deficiencies cause paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria in humans (28Takeda J. Miyata T. Kawagoe K. Iida Y. Endo Y. Fujita T. Takahashi M. Kitani T. Kinoshita T. Cell. 1993; 73: 703-711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). Moreover, GPI-anchored proteins are receptors for bacterial toxins, clostridial α-toxin (29Gordon V.M. Nelson K.L. Buckley J.T. Stevens V.L. Tweten R.K. Elwood P.C. Leppla S.H. J. Biol.

Here we show a novel putative function of the GPI anchor glycan of CD48, namely, as an immunomodulator of the response to IL-18. Our future studies will analyze this potential immunomodulatory function of the GPI anchor glycan."
https://openalex.org/W2013825941,"We have previously reported that epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), the cytochrome P450 epoxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid, are potent stereospecific activators of the cardiac KATP channel. The epoxide group in EET is critical for reducing channel sensitivity to ATP, thereby activating the channel. This study is to identify the molecular sites on the KATP channels for EET-mediated activation. We investigated the effects of EETs on Kir6.2ΔC26 with or without the coexpression of SUR2A and on Kir6.2 mutants of positively charged residues known to affect channel activity coexpressed with SUR2A in HEK293 cells. The ATP IC50 values were significantly increased in Kir6.2 R27A, R50A, K185A, and R201A but not in R16A, K47A, R54A, K67A, R192A, R195A, K207A, K222A, and R314A mutants. Similar to native cardiac KATP channel, 5 μm 11,12-EET increased the ATP IC50 by 9.6-fold in Kir6.2/SUR2A wild type and 8.4-fold in Kir6.2ΔC26. 8,9- and 14,15-EET regioisomers activated the Kir6.2 channel as potently as 11,12-EET. 8,9- and 11,12-EET failed to change the ATP sensitivity of Kir6.2 K185A, R195A, and R201A, whereas their effects were intact in the other mutants. 14,15-EET had a similar effect with K185A and R201A mutants, but instead of R195A, it failed to activate Kir6.2R192A. These results indicate that activation of Kir6.2 by EETs does not require the SUR2A subunit, and the region in the Kir6.2 C terminus from Lys-185 to Arg-201 plays a critical role in EET-mediated Kir6.2 channel activation. Based on computer modeling of the Kir6.2 structure, we infer that the EET-Kir6.2 interaction may allosterically change the ATP binding site on Kir6.2, reducing the channel sensitivity to ATP.

Although the role of the cardiac KATP channels under normal physiological conditions remains unclear, it is crucial in ischemic preconditioning, and activation of KATP channels occurs during cardiac ischemia and hypoxia, leading to reduced Ca2+ influx and intracellular Ca2+ overload (2Gross G.J. Peart J.N. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2003; 285: 921-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Some important insights were provided by studies using the Kir6.2 knock-out mice, which have compromised ability in modulating cardiac electrophysiological properties, contractility (3Suzuki M.

Recently, a form of human dilated cardiomyopathy was found to be associated with mutations of the cardiac KATP channels (7Bienengraeber M. Olson T.M. Selivanov V.A. Kathmann E.C. O'Cochlain F. Gao F.

The cardiac KATP channel is a heterooctamer containing four inward rectifier K+ channel (Kir6.2) and four sulfonylurea receptor (SUR2A) subunits. SUR contains two cytoplasmic nucleotide binding folds that were initially thought to be important for channel regulation by ATP (8Aguilar-Bryan L. Clement J.P.T. Gonzalez G. Kunjilwar K. Babenko A. Bryan J. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 227-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). However, a truncation mutant of the Kir6.2 involving deletion of the C-terminal 26 residues (Kir6.2ΔC26) gives rise to channels that retain much of the ATP sensitivity in the absence of SUR (9Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Zhao C. Trapp S. Ashcroft F.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). Also, mutations in the SUR produced only small effects on ATP inhibition of Kir6.2/SUR currents (10Ashcroft F.M. Gribble F.M. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 288-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that both the N and C termini of Kir6.2 contribute to the site(s) that regulates ATP sensitivity, and they include Arg-50, Cys-166, Ile-167, Thr-171, Arg-176, Arg-177, Glu-179, Ile-182, Lys-185, Arg-192, Arg-201, and Gly-344 residues. Of these, Arg-50, Lys-185, and Arg-201 residues are particularly crucial for ATP sensitivity and are implicated for interaction with the α, β, and γ phosphates of ATP (11Trapp S. Haider S. Jones P.

Lipid metabolites are important modulators of the KATP channels, and these include the long chain acyl-CoA esters (14Schulze D. Rapedius M. Krauter T. Baukrowitz T. J. Physiol.

The plasma level of EETs is in nm range and could increase several fold in the coronary sinus eluent during cardiac ischemia and reperfusing (21Nithipatikom K. DiCamelli R.F. Kohler S. Gumina R.J.

The intracellular EET concentrations undoubtedly would be much higher under these conditions. Indeed, the amount of EETs release from phospholipids through activation of phospholipase A2 had been estimated to reach the μm range of concentration in human platelets (22Zhu Y. Schieber E.B.

EETs have been considered to be candidates of endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factors in human coronary vessel bed (23Campbell W.B. Gebremedhin D. Pratt P.F. Harder D.R. Circ.

(Lond.). 2001; 534: 651-667Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that EETs are potent activators of the cardiac KATP channels, reducing the channel sensitivity to ATP, and had an EC50 of about 30 nm (17Lu T. Hoshi T. Weintraub N.L. Spector A.A. Lee H.C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 537: 811-827Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 18Lu T. VanRollins M. Lee H.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 1076-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Single channel kinetic studies showed that EETs reverse the effect of ATP on the KATP channel properties, prolong the channel open time, and shorten the channel closed times (17Lu T. Hoshi T. Weintraub N.L. Spector A.A. Lee H.C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 537: 811-827Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Structural determinant studies showed that only the 11(S),12(R)-EET, but not the 11(R),12(S)-EET enantiomer, could activate the cardiac KATP channels (18Lu T. VanRollins M. Lee H.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 1076-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In addition, the carboxylic group, the carbon chain length, and the number of double bonds on the EET molecule all were not important. Only the presence of the epoxide group is critical for KATP channel activation (18Lu T. VanRollins M. Lee H.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 1076-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These results suggest that there is a specific and direct interaction between EETs and cardiac KATP channels. In this study we examined the role of SUR2A and the positively charged residues on the Kir6.2 subunit that modulate channel ATP sensitivity and open probability (Po) on channel sensitivity to EETs. Kir6.2 Mutagenesis and Expression—Mutations and deletions of mouse Kir6.2 (GI:1622948) were performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Oligonucleotide primers containing the desired mutations were synthesized by IDATE Co. (Coralville, IA). The orientation of the constructs and the correct mutations were verified by DNA sequencing (DNA facilities core of Mayo Clinic). Kir6.2 and SUR2A in pcDNA3.1 were kindly provided by Dr. Andre Terzic. Kir6.2, SUR2A, and green fluorescent protein inserted in pcDNA3.1 were transfected into HEK293 cells in ratios of 1:4:1 (w/w/w) using a FuGENE 6 transfection kit (Roche Applied Science). The transfected cells were detected by the presence of green fluorescent protein expression under an ultraviolet microscope (Olympus, IX70) 48 h after transfection. HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5 mm glucose and 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 units/ml). Electrophysiology—Inside-out single channel recordings were recorded with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Forest City, CA), and output of the amplifier was filtered through an 8-pole Bessel filter at 5 kHz and digitized at 40 kHz as described previously (17Lu T. Hoshi T. Weintraub N.L. Spector A.A. Lee H.C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 537: 811-827Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Macroscopic currents of Kir6.2 channels were elicited from excised inside-out patches using a continuous voltage ramp protocol (+100 mV to –100 mV) over 100 ms at 30-s intervals with a holding potential of 0 mV. The pipette resistance was 0.2∼0.5 megaohms for macropatch and 5 megaohms for single channel recordings when filled with the pipette solution, which contained 140.0 mm KCl, 1.0 mm EGTA, 5.0 mm HEPES, 1.0 mm CaCl2 (pH adjusted to 7.4 with N-methyl-d-glucamine). For the ATP response curves, various amounts of ATP (10-8 to 10-2 m) were added to a 0 Mg2+ bath solution containing 70.0 mm KCl, 70.0 mm potassium aspartate, 2.0 mm EGTA, 5.0 mm HEPES, 7.0 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine (pH adjusted to 7.35 with N-methyl-d-glucamine). The pH was readjusted when the ATP concentration in the bath solution was greater than 1 mm. ATP sensitivity of the channel was measured when currents became stable and reached steady state with the bath solution. The effects of EETs on the ATP sensitivity of the channel were determined by measuring the percentage changes before and after application of 5 μm 11,12-EET in the presence of ATP concentrations at IC50. To obtain the ATP IC50, the relationship between ATP and channel maximal conductance (G) or Po at various ATP concentrations was plotted and fitted using a Hill equation of the form, G = Gmax/[1 + ([ATP]/IC50)H], where Gmax represents channel maximal conductance at zero ATP concentration, [ATP] represents the concentration of ATP, IC50 is the concentration at half-maximal inhibition, and H is the Hill coefficient. All experiments were conducted at room temperature (23 °C). Computer Modeling of Kir6.2 Structure—Using the crystal structure of a related KATP-sensitive channel, KirBac1.1 (33Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Antcliff J.F. Rahman T. Lowe E.D. Zimmer J. Cuthbertson J. Ashcroft F.M. Ezaki T. Doyle D.A. Science. 2003; 300: 1922-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar), as the template to locate the residues of interest in this study, we generated a putative three-dimensional structural model of Kir6.2. The KirBac1.1 coordinates were downloaded from the Protein Data Bank (file 1P7B). The amino acid sequences of mouse Kir6.2- and KirBac1.1-crystallized protein were aligned with 50% identity according to the conserved domain data base of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). The KirBac1.1-crystallized protein has a more complete N terminus than that of GIRK1 (G-protein-activated inward rectifier potassium channel 1). The predicted Kir6.2 structure was created by PyMol software, and the estimated distance between two residues was measured from the model. Materials—Unless otherwise mentioned, all chemicals used were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. 8,9-, 11,12- and 14,15-EET were purchased from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI), solubilized in 100% ethanol as 5 mm stocks, and stored at –80 °C. HEK293 cells and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were obtained from Invitrogen. Statistical Analysis—Data are present as the mean ± S.E. Student's t test was used to compare data between two groups. A one-way analysis of variance followed by a Tukey test analysis was employed to compare data from multiple groups using SigmaStat software (Jandel, San Rafael, CA). We first determined whether the heterologously expressed Kir6.2/SUR2A wild type (Kir6.2 wt) channels are activated by EETs. We measured the ATP sensitivity of Kir6.2 wt in the presence and absence of 5 μm 11,12-EET to obtain maximal channel activation. Fig. 2A shows representative recordings of Kir6.2 wt (top panel). ATP at IC50 concentration (50 μm) produced 50% inhibition of the currents, and this effect was reproducible after washout and re-exposure to ATP. However, in the presence of 5 μm 11,12-EET, application of ATP at IC50 concentrations failed to produce the same amount of inhibition in the Kir6.2 wt channels. The ATP inhibitory effect was significantly antagonized by 11,12-EET as observed in native KATP channels in cardiac ventricular myocytes (17Lu T. Hoshi T. Weintraub N.L. Spector A.A. Lee H.C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 537: 811-827Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Single channel recordings confirmed that the effects of ATP concentrations on channel Po were reduced in the presence of 5 μm 11,12-EET (Fig. 2B). 5 μm 11,12-EET increased the ATP IC50 of the channel from a base line of 44.4 ± 16.4 to 468.4 ± 135.0 μm (n = 6, p < 0.05 versus base line (Fig. 2C). The Hill coefficient (H) remained unchanged (1.23 ± 0.08 at base line versus 1.28 ± 0.10 with EET; n = 6, p = not significant). These results suggest that the Kir6.2 wt channels expressed in HEK293 cells retain the sensitivity to activation by EET, similar to native KATP channels in cardiac ventricular myocytes. Kir6.2ΔC26 forms functional channels when expressed in HEK293 cells without the co-expression of SUR2A as previously reported (Fig. 3, A and B) (9Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Zhao C. Trapp S. Ashcroft F.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). 5 μm 11,12-EET increased the ATP IC50 of Kir6.2ΔC26 from 105.2 ± 20.6 μm at base line to 989.8 ± 468.4 μm (n = 6, p < 0.05 versus base line) without changing H (Fig. 3C). However, in the presence of Kir6.2ΔC26 alone, not only the channel ATP sensitivity was decreased (ATP IC50 = 105.2 ± 20.6 μm, n = 6, p < 0.05, versus Kir6.2 wt), but H was also significantly reduced to 0.61 ± 0.01 compared with 1.23 ± 0.08 in the Kir6.2 wt (n = 6 for both, p < 0.05). The current amplitudes in cells expressing Kir6.2ΔC26 were also much lower than in those expressing Kir6.2 wt. Coexpressing Kir6.2ΔC26 with SUR2A would restore the channel ATP IC50 (47.0 ± 9.4 μm, n = 8) and H (1.34 ± 0.94, n = 8) to values similar to those of the Kir6.2 wt (Fig. 4B), consistent with previous reports (9Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Zhao C. Trapp S. Ashcroft F.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar, 34Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Proks P. Trapp S. Ryder T.J. Haug T. Reimann F. Ashcroft F.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3290-3296Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the SUR2A subunit modulates the Kir6.2 channel property and ATP sensitivity, but activation of the KATP channel by EETs does not require the presence of SUR2A. Also, the last 26 amino acids of the Kir6.2 C terminus were not required for sensitivity to EET. Because the SUR2A subunit is not involved with Kir6.2 channel sensitivity to EET, all further studies with Kir6.2 mutant channels were performed with the coexpression of SUR2A.Fig. 4Effects of positive charge neutralization on channel ATP sensitivity. A, continuous current recordings from Kir6.2 wt, R50A, K185A, and R201A coexpressed with SUR2A in HEK293 cells using a voltage ramp protocol (+100 mV to –100 mV) in the presence of various concentrations of ATP as indicated. B, normalized channel conductance of the Kir6.2 wt, the N-terminal mutants (left), and the C-terminal mutants (right) was plotted against the ATP concentrations. Each point represents the mean ± S.E. The R50A, K185A, and R201A mutants show dramatic reduction in ATP sensitivity. The R27A mutant showed less marked but still significant reduction in ATP sensitivity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because EETs activate the KATP channels by reducing channel sensitivity to ATP and may share a common mechanism with other lipid metabolites in KATP channel activation, we tried to identify the molecular sites on the Kir6.2 that are important for EET sensitivity by neutralizing the positively charged residues before Gly-334 and to determine the effects of these mutations on EET sensitivity. We found that the Kir6.2 R27A, R50A, K185A, and R201A mutants significantly reduced the channel ATP sensitivity, consistent with previous reports (11Trapp S. Haider S. Jones P. Sansom M.S.

Fig. 4A shows representative current tracings of Kir6.2 wt, R50A, K185A, and R201A coexpressed with SUR2A. The ATP IC50 was dramatically increased from 43.0 ± 6.2 μm (n = 8) in the Kir6.2 wt to 2921.3 ± 726.8 μm in R50A (n = 8, p < 0.05 versus wt), to 536.5 ± 111.0 μm in K185A (n = 8, p < 0.05 versus wt), and to 1950.0 ± 594.2 μm in R201A (n = 7, p < 0.05 versus wt) (Fig. 4B). The R27A mutant produced a small but significant increase in ATP IC50 (73.4 ± 16.4 μm, n = 8, p < 0.05, versus wt) (see Fig. 6, upper panel). In addition, the G334D mutant was practically ATP-insensitive, with IC50 >20 mm, and no currents could be recorded from the R176A, R177A, R206A, and R301A mutants in excised inside-out patches, as previously reported (35Shyng S.L. Cukras C.A. Harwood J. Nichols C.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 599-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 39Drain P. Li L. Wang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13953-13958Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). To examine the effects of EETs on ATP inhibition of the Kir6.2 mutants, we determined the effects of 5 μm 11,12-EET in the presence of IC50 concentrations of ATP for each mutant channel. We found that all the mutants of neutralized positively charged residues, including R27A and R50A, on the cytoplasmic N terminus of Kir6.2 were activated by 11,12-EETs, with significant reduction to ATP inhibition (Fig. 5 and Fig. 6, lower panel). These findings suggest that EET and ATP probably act at different sites on Kir6.2. On the C-terminal side of Kir6.2, sensitivity to 11,12-EET was preserved in R192A, K207A, K222A, and R314A. However, the effects of 11,12-EET were abolished in the K185A, R195A, and R201A mutants, and channel inhibition by ATP was not altered by 11,12-EET (Fig. 5). Summary of ATP sensitivity and 11,12-EET effects on Kir6.2 wt and neutralized positively charged Kir6.2 mutants is shown in Fig. 6. Because the three-dimensional orientations of the EET regioisomers are different, we further compared the effects of 8,9- and 14,15-EET with 11,12-EET on Kir6.2 wt and mutant channels. We found that 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-EET are functionally equipotent activators of Kir6.2 wt. 5 μm 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-EET attenuated the channel ATP IC50 inhibition by 140.6 ± 27.8, 100.0 ± 14.8, and 139.9 ± 41.7%, respectively (n = 5, p = not significant) (Fig. 7C). 8,9-EET did not affect the ATP inhibition on the Kir6.2 K185A, R195A, and R201A mutants and shares the same critical sites with 11,12-EET (Fig. 7, A and B). Similar to 8,9- and 11,12-EET, the effect of 5 μm 14,15-EET was abolished with the K185A and R201A mutant. However, 5 μm 14,15-EET did not affect the ATP inhibition on the R192A but diminished the ATP effect on the R195A mutant. Hence interestingly, Arg-192, instead of Arg-195, is a critical site for channel activation by 14,15-EET (Fig. 7C). These results suggest that the residues Lys-185, Arg-192/Arg-195, and Arg-201 of the Kir6.2 C terminus are critical molecular determinants for KATP channel sensitivity to EETs. In this study we reported several novel observations on the molecular determinants for activation of the KATP channels by EETs. First, we found that the SUR2A subunit is not required for EET to activate the Kir6.2 subunit. Second, the N-terminal positively charged residues of Kir6.2 are not important for determining EET sensitivity of the channel. Third, three C-terminal residues Lys-185, Arg-192/Arg-195, and Arg-201 are critical molecular sites for EET sensitivity. These results place the EET sensitivity over a region encompassing 16 amino acid residues on the C terminus of Kir6.2, and this may possibly represent the EET binding pocket. These results also indicate that the molecular determinants for EET are different from ATP and PIP2. The mechanisms of ATP inhibition of the cardiac KATP channels are complex and involve both Kir6.2 and SUR2A subunits. Our results showed that the presence of SUR2A alters the channel IC50 and H to ATP (Figs. 2 and 3). This is consistent with recent reports that SUR modifies the ATP binding pocket of Kir6.2 by increasing the width of the groove that binds the phosphate tail of ATP without changing the length of the groove and by enhancing the interaction with the adenine ring (40Dabrowski M. Tarasov A. Ashcroft F.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2004; 557: 347-354Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Previous studies identified Lys-185 and Arg-201 on the C terminus and Arg-50 on the N terminus of Kir6.2 as particularly crucial for ATP binding (12Ribalet B. John S.A. Weiss J.N. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 266-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 13John S.A. Weiss J.N. Xie L.H. Ribalet B. J. Physiol.

(Lond.). 1999; 514: 19-25Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Two processes have been proposed to describe the mechanism of KATP inhibition by ATP. First, ATP may bind to a channel closed state and stabilizes it, resulting in a decrease in Po. Second, ATP may bind to the channel open state and destabilizes the open channel, reducing Po and shortening the mean open time constant (12Ribalet B. John S.A. Weiss J.N. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 266-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies suggested that Lys-185 interacts with the β-phosphate and Arg-201 interacts with the α phosphate of ATP; the former interaction destabilizes the channel open state, whereas the latter would favor the channel entrance into stable closed states (12Ribalet B. John S.A. Weiss J.N. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 266-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 13John S.A. Weiss J.N. Xie L.H. Ribalet B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 552: 23-34Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The role of Arg-50 is less clear, and interaction with the β phosphate (12Ribalet B. John S.A. Weiss J.N. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 266-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and the γ phosphate (11Trapp S. Haider S. Jones P. Sansom M.S. Ashcroft F.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2903-2912Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) of ATP has been suggested. How many ATP binding pockets exist in each Kir6.2 subunit is not known. Studies using maltose-binding fusion proteins of the cytoplasmic regions of Kir6.2 showed that ATP only binds to the cytoplasmic C terminus but not to the N terminus of the channel (41Vanoye C.G. MacGregor G.G. Dong K. Tang L. Buschmann A.S. Hall A.E. Lu M. Giebisch G. Hebert S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23260-23270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Our study confirmed that Arg-50, Lys-185, and Arg-201 are critical sites for ATP sensitivity, and Arg-27 also slightly but significantly affects ATP IC50. Recently, It has been reported that Arg-50 may approach the vicinity of Lys-185 and Arg-201 of the neighboring Kir6.2 subunit to form an ATP binding site by intramolecular complementation (42Antcliff J.F. Haider S. Proks P. Sansom M.S. Ashcroft F.M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). This study identified Lys-185, Arg-201, and Arg-195 residues as critical sites for determining the channel sensitivity to 8,9- and 11,12-EET, whereas Arg-192 rather than Arg-195 is critical for the Kir6.2 channel sensitivity to 14,15-EET. This may be due to the position of the epoxide group and its three-dimensional orientation. Nevertheless, regioisomer-specific interaction with Arg-192 and Arg-195 produced the same effect and potency in Kir6.2 channel activation, indicating that Arg-192/Arg-195 may represent the epoxide binding site. However, the exact mechanism whereby EETs antagonize the ATP effects is not known. Interestingly, the R27A and R50A mutations altered ATP sensitivity without affecting channel sensitivity to 11,12-EET. In contrast, the R192A or R195A mutation did not change the response to ATP, but channel activation by 11,12-EET was lost. Only the K185A and R201A mutations diminished both the ATP and EET effects on the channel. These results suggest that the EET binding site on Kir6.2 is different from that of ATP. A direct competition for binding between ATP and PIP2 at the C terminus of Kir6.2 has been reported (43MacGregor G.G. Dong K. Vanoye C.G. Tang L. Giebisch G. Hebert S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2726-2731Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Previous studies showed that the basic residues in two regions (176–222 and 301–314) in the C terminus of Kir6.2 are important for determining the PIP2 effects (35Shyng S.L. Cukras C.A. Harwood J. Nichols C.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 599-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Arg-176, Arg-177, Arg-206, Arg-222, and Arg-301 residues in particular are sites critical for PIP2 sensitivity. Of the N-terminal sites, Arg-54 was identified as a major determinant for PIP2 modulation of ATP sensitivity in the KATP channels (44Schulze D. Krauter T. Fritzenschaft H. Soom M. Baukrowitz T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10500-10505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) Interestingly, with the possible exception of Arg-201, none of the PIP2-sensitive residues overlaps with those of ATP or EET. Recently, long chain acyl-CoA esters were found to modulate ATP inhibition of the KATP channels by the same mechanisms as PIP2 (14Schulze D. Rapedius M. Krauter T. Baukrowitz T. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 552: 357-367Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar), suggesting these lipid metabolites shared a common site of interaction on the channel. Indeed, it has been proposed that there is a novel lipid-interacting motif for inward rectifier K+ channels termed KIRLI domain (45Cukras C.A. Jeliazkova I. Nichols C.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 119: 581-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The core of this domain is composed of residues 170–320, and the structure is composed of anti-parallel β strands and an α helix, which closely resembles that of the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a known PIP2 binding motif. According to this model, charged residues including Arg-176, Arg-177, Arg-192, and Arg-195 are clustered on one side of the β-strand pocket. Arg-176 and Arg-177 are involved with PIP2 interaction (45Cukras C.A. Jeliazkova I. Nichols C.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 119: 581-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), whereas Arg-192 and Arg-195 are important for EET sensitivity. Whether EETs and PIP2 interact with the KATP channels through a similar mechanism that affects ATP sensitivity is at present unknown. However, we would like to emphasize that there are major differences between EET and PIP2 on KATP channel activation. First, the EET effects are stereo-specific with an EC50 in the range of 10-8 m and reach steady state within 2 min. Second, the negative charge on the EET molecule is not important. The EET methyl ester is as active as EET in reducing ATP sensitivity of the channel (18Lu T. VanRollins M. Lee H.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 1076-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Third, unlike PIP2, EETs could not activate the KATP channels after rundown or from glibenclamide inhibition. Fourth, with the exception of Arg-201, residues on the Kir6.2 channel that are important for PIP2 sensitivity, such as Arg-54 and Lys-222, are not important for EET sensitivity. Hence, we believe that EETs and fatty acid epoxides constitute a unique class of lipid metabolites that function as KATP channel activators. To better understand the role of the EET-sensitive sites on Kir6.2, we constructed a molecular model of Kir6.2 based on the crystal structure of KirBac1.1 (33Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Antcliff J.F. Rahman T. Lowe E.D. Zimmer J. Cuthbertson J. Ashcroft F.M. Ezaki T. Doyle D.A. Science. 2003; 300: 1922-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar) (Fig. 8). This ATP-sensitive channel shares 50% sequence homology with Kir6.2, and it contains a more complete N terminus than that of Kir3.1, which has been used for creating putative Kir6.2 models (46Fox J.E.M. Nichols C.G. Light P.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 679-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Fig. 8A shows the side view of two neighboring Kir6.2 subunits (yellow and green), and the locations of specific residues that are relevant to the current study are labeled. Interestingly, Lys-185, Arg-201, and Gly-334 are clustered together and may represent the ATP binding pocket. Based on the three-dimensional structural model created, the estimated distance between Gly-334 to Lys-185 and to the Arg-201 side chain is 8.3 and 12.5 Å, where the distance from Lys-185 to Arg-201 is 6.9 Å, similar to a previous report (13John S.A. Weiss J.N. Xie L.H. Ribalet B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 552: 23-34Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar) (Fig. 8B). It has been suggested that Arg-201 interacts with the α-phosphate of ATP, and Lys-185 interacts with the β-phosphate of ATP. Gly-334 has been proposed to interact with the adenine ring of ATP (13John S.A. Weiss J.N. Xie L.H. Ribalet B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 552: 23-34Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, the details of the molecular structure of the Kir6.2 N terminus, in particular the ATP-sensitive sites including Arg-27, has not been completely resolved. The residues from Lys-185 to Arg-201 consist of an anti-parallel β-sheet with Arg-192 and Arg-195 forming one end of this structure (Fig. 8B). The estimated distance between Arg-192 to Arg-195 is 5.7 Å, and this distance may accommodate the spatial constraints between the epoxide groups in 11,12-EET and 14,15-EET. Furthermore, the estimated distances from Arg-195 to Lys-185, Arg-201, and Gly-334 are 25.2, 22.0, and 25.4 Å, respectively, whereas those from Arg-192 to these residues are 22.3, 15.7, and 18.6 Å, respectively, and are shorter than those from Arg-195. Because the distance from α-phosphate to γ-phosphate is about 8 Å, Arg-192 and Arg-195 are too far to be involved with ATP binding (40Dabrowski M. Tarasov A. Ashcroft F.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2004; 557: 347-354Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). One working model for the EET effects is that Arg-192 or Arg-195 constitute the EET binding site and upon physical interaction with EETs would result in allosteric changes in the ATP binding site. Hence, Lys-185 and Arg-201 represent sites downstream of EET binding (Fig. 8B), and mutations in these sites produce conformational changes that would preemptively nullify the EET effects. The locations of Arg-192 and Arg-195 are also not in the vicinity of Arg-176 and Arg-177, which are important PIP2 binding sites, and this may help to explain why EETs and PIP2, even though they are both lipid metabolites that activate the cardiac KATP channels, behave so differently. In summary, we have provided mechanistic insights on Kir6.2 channel regulation by EETs. Three positively charged residues, Lys-185, Arg-192/Arg-195, and Arg-201, on the C terminus of Kir6.2 are crucial for EET sensitivity. Because Arg-192 and Arg-195 are not ATP-sensitive residues, they may interact with EETs, resulting in allosteric changes in the three-dimensional structure of the ATP binding pockets and reducing the channel sensitivity to ATP. Direct binding studies will be helpful to further confirm this finding. Download .pdf (.1 MB) Help with pdf files"

EC 1.5.99.7) isolated from the bacterium Methylophilus methylotrophus (isolate W3A1) is an iron-sulfur-containing flavoprotein consisting of two identical, catalytically independent subunits. Each subunit has a molecular mass of 83 kDa and contains an unusual covalently linked 6-S-cysteinyl FMN cofactor (linking the flavin via its 6-position to Cys30 of the polypeptide), a bacterial ferredoxin-type [4Fe-4S] center, and one equivalent of tightly bound ADP having an unknown function (1Steenkamp D.J.

The enzyme catalyzes the oxidative demethylation of trimethylamine (TMA) to dimethylamine and formaldehyde (presumably through an imine intermediate that spontaneously hydrolyzes once dissociated from the enzyme). This reductive half-reaction of the catalytic cycle results in two-electron reduction of the enzyme shown in Reaction 1. Eox+(CH3)3N+H2O→E2e−+(CH3)2NH+HCHO+2H+REACTION 1 The catalytic cycle is completed by an oxidative half-reaction that involves removal of reducing equivalents from the enzyme via its [4Fe-4S] center (after electron transfer from the FMN site) by electron-transferring flavoprotein (ETF), the natural electron acceptor for TMADH (1Steenkamp D.J. Mallinson J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 429: 705-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). ETF is a 63-kDa αβ heterodimer containing one equivalent of FAD and one equivalent of AMP (like the ADP of TMADH, of unknown function) (8Duplessis E.R. Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. Thorpe C. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1994; 32: 195-199PubMed Google Scholar), and operates in a one-electron oxidation-reduction cycle between the oxidized FAD and the anionic semiquinone FAD. oxidation states (9Steenkamp D.J. Gallup M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4086-4089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, recently it has been shown that ETF can be readily reduced to the hydroquinone form by both trimethylamine and sodium dithionite reduction when it is bound to TMADH (10Jang M.-H. Scrutton N.S. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12546-12552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The ETF semiquinone passes its reducing equivalent to an ETF:CoQ oxidoreductase and thus serves as an electron carrier between various catabolic enzymes and the principal respiratory chains of a variety of organisms (including man) (11Thorpe C. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. II. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 471-486Google Scholar, 12Husain M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 188: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). TMADH is an interesting example of a complex flavoprotein that possesses multiple redox-active centers and is a convenient system in which to study biological electron transfer. TMADH can take up a total of three electrons per subunit upon reduction: two at the FMNH2 and one at the iron-sulfur center. The enzyme with two electrons per subunit (TMADH2e–), the reduced form generated on reduction by trimethylamine, is not fully reduced and has two possible distributions: fully reduced FMNH2 with oxidized [4Fe-4S] or flavin semiquinone and reduced [4Fe-4S]. The equilibrium between these two distributions is governed by the reduction potentials of the centers and is pH-dependent. At pH 7.0 the former distribution is favored by a factor of approximately two (13Rohlfs R.J. Huang L. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22196-22207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Previous studies have examined both intramolecular electron transfer within TMADH (13Rohlfs R.J. Huang L. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22196-22207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and intermolecular electron transfer between TMADH and ETF (10Jang M.-H. Scrutton N.S. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12546-12552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 14Huang L. Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol.

Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9188-9200Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The former work has demonstrated that electron transfer from FMN to the iron-sulfur center in TMADH occurs rapidly, with kET >1000 s–1, and is not rate-limiting to overall catalysis. Electron transfer on to ETF has been studied by following the reaction of reduced TMADH with oxidized ETF, varying the concentration of the latter (14Huang L. Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23958-23965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 15Wilson E.K. Huang L. Sutcliffe M.J. Mathews F.S. Hille R. Scrutton N.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These two studies have shown that the observed rate constant for electron transfer exhibits hyperbolic dependence on [ETF], from which an apparent limiting kET of ∼180 s–1 and a dissociation constant for binding of TMADHred and ETFox of 10 μm have been determined. Assuming a decay parameter β for electron transfer as a function of distance of 1.4 Å–1, this value for the limiting rate of electron transfer is consistent with a donor-acceptor distance of ∼12 Å; approximately the extent to which the [4Fe-4S] is buried in TMADH. Tyr442 lies at the surface of TMADH, constitutes one side of a shallow cleft on the surface of the protein nearest the buried [4Fe-4S] center (7Lim L.W. Mathews F.S. Steenkamp D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3075-3078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it is likely that ETF docks close to Tyr442 in forming the protein-protein complex. Kinetic studies of the TMADH mutants Y442F, Y442L, and Y442G have shown that mutations at this site significantly influence electron transfer from TMADH to ETF; at 25 °C, the Y442G mutant exhibits a ∼30-fold decrease in the limiting rate constant for electron transfer and a 10-fold increase in Kd (15Wilson E.K. Huang L. Sutcliffe M.J. Mathews F.S. Hille R. Scrutton N.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Recently, the reaction of reduced TMADH with ETF has been reexamined (17Basran J. Chohan K.K. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9188-9200Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), not only with wild-type enzyme but also several site-directed mutants at Tyr442, which had previously been investigated (15Wilson E.K. Huang L. Sutcliffe M.J. Mathews F.S. Hille R. Scrutton N.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Whereas results with the mutant TMADH forms were largely consistent with the earlier study, the wild-type enzyme was found to exhibit kinetics with a linear dependence on [ETF] rather than the hyperbolic dependence found in the two earlier studies. Based on this observation, a model was proposed in which mutations at Tyr442 had very large effects on the rate of electron transfer from the iron-sulfur center of TMADH to the FAD of ETF, although the effect was masked by a rate-limiting conformational change with the wild-type enzyme. In subsequent studies (18Jones M. Talfournier F. Bobrov A. Grossmann J.G. Vekshin N. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8457-8465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), it was suggested that subsequent to this rate-limiting conformational change, ETF was converted to a form that was far more kinetically competent to be oxidized or reduced. This conformational change was proposed to persist for some time even after dissociation of ETF from TMADH, and the overall process was termed “structural imprinting” (18Jones M. Talfournier F. Bobrov A. Grossmann J.G. Vekshin N. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8457-8465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In an effort to resolve these conflicting interpretations in the literature and to clarify the kinetic behavior of the oxidative half-reaction of TMADH with ETF, we have further examined the spectroscopic changes and kinetics of their interaction. In particular, the protein concentration and oxidation state dependence of spectral changes associated with the formation of complex of TMADH and ETF have been reexamined. The results indicate that the spectral changes previously attributed to complex formation between TMADH and either ETFox (10Jang M.-H. Scrutton N.S. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12546-12552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) or ETFsq (19Jones M. Basran J. Sutcliffe M.J. Grossmann J.G. Scrutton N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21349-21354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) are instead attributed to electron transfer processes, which can be partially reversed under certain conditions. In addition to equilibrium studies of formation of the TMADH·ETF complex, kinetic experiments with wild-type and a Y442G mutant have also been reexamined. The results are fully consistent with the two earlier studies, and we find no evidence to support a model for electron transfer between TMADH and ETF that involves a rate-limiting conformational change within the TMADH·ETF complex or, by corollary, a profound effect on electron transfer upon mutating Tyr442. The results are also inconsistent with the formation of an imprinted state of ETF upon prior incubation with TMADH. Chemicals—Mono- and di-potassium phosphate and TMA were obtained from Sigma. Sodium dithionite was from Virginia Chemicals. Ferricenium hexafluorophosphate was prepared as described by Lehman et al. (20Lehman T.C. Hale D.E. Bhala A. Thorpe C. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 186: 280-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 21Lehman T.C. Thorpe C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10594-10602Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). TOPO-TA (with TOP 10 electrocompetent cells) and pTrcHis2A were purchased from Invitrogen. All enzymes used in the molecular biology experiments (including NcoI and XhoI) were purchased from MBI Fermentas, except for Pfu DNA polymerase, which was purchased from Stratagene. All bacterial media were purchased from Fisher. TMADH and ETF Purification—M. methylotrophus W3A1 was grown on TMA as sole carbon source, and TMADH was purified as described by Steenkamp and Mallinson (1Steenkamp D.J. Mallinson J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 429: 705-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), with the exception that Sephacryl S-200 was used instead of Sephadex G-200 in the gel filtration step of the purification. The concentration of the purified TMADH on a per flavin basis was determined from the 442-nm absorbance of oxidized enzyme using a molar extinction coefficient of 27.3 mm–1 cm–1 (6Kasprzak A.A. Papas E.J. Steenkamp D.J. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 535-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Routine enzyme assays were performed as described by McIntire (22McIntire W.S. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 188: 250-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). As-isolated TMADH is denoted here as TMADHai to distinguish it from fully oxidized enzyme, obtained by treatment with ferricenium hexafluorophosphate. ETF was purified essentially as described by Steenkamp and Gallup (9Steenkamp D.J. Gallup M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4086-4089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Again, Sephadex G-200 in the gel filtration step of the purification was replaced with Sephacryl S-200. Because ETF as-isolated was typically partially reduced, it was oxidized by reaction with ferricenium hexafluorophosphate prior to use (yielding ETFox). Residual oxidant was removed by passage through a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The concentration of ETF was determined from the absorbance at 438 nm using an extinction coefficient of 11.3 mm–1cm–1 (9Steenkamp D.J. Gallup M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4086-4089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purification of Recombinant Trimethylamine Dehydrogenase—The gene encoding the previously reported TMADH Y442G mutant (15Wilson E.K. Huang L. Sutcliffe M.J. Mathews F.S. Hille R. Scrutton N.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) was obtained by a modified version of the QuikChange mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene) using the wild-type gene cloned into the TOPO-TA maintenance vector (to be described elsewhere) and the mutagenic nucleotide: 5′-GGTGAGTGGAGCGGTCACCGCG-3′. The mutant gene was subcloned into the pTrcHis2A vector and the mutation confirmed by sequencing. This vector was used to transfect electrocompetent Escherichia coli BL21 DE3 cells and overexpress the recombinant protein. For the recombinant wild-type and mutant enzymes, a rapid purification method was adapted and modified from the previously developed method for the purification of trimethylamine dehydrogenase from bacterium W3A1 (1Steenkamp D.J. Mallinson J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 429: 705-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Transfected E. coli BL21 DE3 cells from above were grown in 2 liters of TPP medium containing 0.1 g/liter flavin mononucleotide (FMN), 0.1 g/liter riboflavin, 0.2 g/liter ferrous ammonium sulfate, and 100 mg/ml ampicillin. Cells were grown to an A600∼0.6, induced with 400 μm isopropyl-β-thiogalactoside, grown for 24 h at 28 °C, and harvested by centrifugation (7000 × g for 10 min). Cells were resuspended in 50 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7. Crude lysate from cell lysis/sonication was loaded onto a DEAE column and eluted using a linear 0∼0.5 m NaCl gradient. Fractions containing recombinant TMADH were collected and pooled based on purity (UV-visible spectrum, SDS-PAGE), and then concentrated. The enzyme was then loaded onto an S-200 column pre-equilibrated with potassium phosphate buffer and eluted with the same buffer. With this improved construct, increased levels of FMN incorporation were evident, typically reaching 70%. Enzyme concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using an extinction coefficient of 27,300 m–1 cm–1 at 443 nm, after correction for the deflavo enzyme (6Kasprzak A.A. Papas E.J. Steenkamp D.J. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 535-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Binding Studies of TMADHai and ETFox or ETFsq—Solutions of TMADH were placed in a tonometer and made anaerobic by alternatively evacuating and flushing with O2-free argon. Using a Hamilton syringe, 1.2-ml samples of TMADH at the desired concentration were placed in one side of a split-cell cuvette that was sealed with a rubber septum and made anaerobic by flushing with O2-free argon. A solution of oxidized ETF (ETFox) of the same concentration was made anaerobic in the same way, and 1.2 ml of this solution was then placed in the other side of the cuvette. The stoichiometry of TMADH and ETFox in each case was thus 1:1. A spectrum of the two proteins in separate compartments of the cuvette was then recorded using a Hewlett-Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer, after which the two compartments were mixed and a second spectrum taken. The [after-mixing] – [before-mixing] difference spectrum was then obtained mathematically using software provided by the manufacturer. Given the kinetically determined dissociation constant Kd for the binding of the TMADHred and ETFox of 10 μm (14Huang L. Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23958-23965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), a 10-fold greater concentration of the two proteins in the present experiment should ensure essentially complete formation of the protein complex (assuming the Kd is not greatly affected by the oxidation state of TMADH). Because concentrations used in the experiments were limited by the light path of the cuvette and the nonlinearity of Beer's law at high optical density, the concentrations used here could be no higher than 100 μm. The identical protocol was used to obtain the difference spectrum associated with formation of the TMADHai and ETFred complex. ETFSQ was obtained by titration of ETF with sodium dithionite. Simulation of Spectral Changes Associated with Electron Transfer from TMADH to ETF—The readily obtained spectra of TMADHox, TMADH2eq, ETFSQ, and ETFox were used to calculate the difference spectrum of TMADHox – TMADH2eq and the difference spectrum of ETFSQ – ETFox. These two difference spectra were then used to obtain a simulation of the spectral change associated with electron transfer from TMADH to ETF. Treatment of TMADH with Phenylhydrazine Hydrochloride— Phenylhydrazine-inactivated TMADH (TMADHinact) was prepared according to the method described previously (23Nagy N. Kenny W.C. Singer T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2684-2688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar): 50 μm TMADH in 0.1 m sodium pyrophosphate buffer, pH 7.7, was incubated with 2 mm phenylhydrazine at 30 °C for 4 h. The solution was then filter-concentrated and passed through a Sephadex G-25 column to remove excess phenylhydrazine. The concentration of TMADH thus obtained was determined using an extinction coefficient of 21.4 mm–1 cm–1 at 410 nm (6Kasprzak A.A. Papas E.J. Steenkamp D.J. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 535-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Kinetics of Electron Transfer between TMADH and ETF—Kinetic experiments were carried out using a Kinetic Instrument Inc. stopped-flow apparatus equipped with an On Line Instruments Systems (OLIS) model 3920Z data collection system, or an Applied Photophysics SX.17 MV stopped-flow spectrophotometer. Anaerobic native TMADH, TMADHinact, or mutant TMADH Y442G was made anaerobic in a glass tonometer by alternate cycles of evacuation and flushing with argon, and reduced by titration with sodium dithionite delivered via a titration syringe. Spectral changes were monitored via a side-arm cuvette attached to the tonometer. Fully oxidized ETF was prepared as described above and made anaerobic as above in a tonometer. The concentration of reagent in excess in the stopped-flow experiment (either ETF or TMADH) was at least five times greater than that of the limiting reagent to ensure pseudo first-order conditions. Kinetic transients obtained after mixing reduced TMADH with ETF were fitted to sums of exponentials using software provided by the manufacturers (24Bevington R.R. Data Reduction and Error Analysis for the Physical Sciences. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York1996: 235-236Google Scholar). Although well-established anaerobic procedures were used throughout (25Foust G.P. Burleigh Jr., B.D. Mayhew S. Williams Jr., C.H. Massey V. Analyt. Biochem. 1969; 27: 530-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 26Beinert H. Orme-Johnson W.H. Palmer G. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 54: 111-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), it is to be noted that the reduced forms of both TMADH and ETF are unusually unreactive toward oxygen (each requiring hours in air to become reoxidized). In addition, no evidence of oxygen contamination (e.g. a reduced absorbance changes seen in the course of an experiment) was observed in any of the studies reported here. The Binding of As-isolated TMADH to Oxidized ETF and ETF Semiquinone—The spectral change observed upon mixing TMADHai and ETFox is shown in Fig. 1A (solid line) and is in good agreement with that reported previously (10Jang M.-H. Scrutton N.S. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12546-12552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Previous studies of a variety of flavoproteins (27Massey V. Ganther H.

Chem. 1984; 259: 1570-1576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have reported spectral changes similar to that seen here on mixing TMADHai with ETFox. Examples include the binding of aromatic amino acids or benzoate to d-amino acid oxidase (27Massey V. Ganther H. Biochemistry. 1965; 4: 1161-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 28Quay S. Massey V. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 3348-3353Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), p-methoxybenzaldehyde to old yellow enzyme (29Abramovitz A.S. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5327-5336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), tartronate to lactate oxidase (30Ghisla S. Massey V. Choong Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10662-10669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and 8-bromoxanthine to oxidized xanthine oxidase (31Hille R. Stewart R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1570-1576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These spectral changes have been interpreted to be arising from moving a normal non-covalently modified flavin from a more hydrophilic environment to a more hydrophobic one. Based on this earlier work, we have previously proposed (10Jang M.-H. Scrutton N.S. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12546-12552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) that the spectral change shown in Fig. 1A (solid line) is caused by a perturbation of the environment of FAD in ETF (rather than the spectrally distinct 6-S-cysteinyl FMN of TMADH) upon formation of the TMADH·ETF complex. If this is true, then it should be possible to use this spectral change to obtain a dissociation constant for ETF binding to (oxidized) TMADH. Fig. 1B shows the dependence of the observed spectral change on protein concentration, with results that are at least qualitatively consistent with a Kd of ∼10 μm. The observed spectral change, however, also turns out to be very similar to the difference spectrum obtained by Huang et al. (14Huang L. Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23958-23965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) for the oxidation of TMADH3eq or of reduced phenylhydrazine-inactivated TMADH by ETFox. This observation raises the question of whether the observed spectral change in the present experiment arises from complex formation between TMADH and ETF or from electron transfer processes. In addition to the spectral change attributed to binding of TMADH to oxidized ETF, a very large spectral change associated with formation of a complex between as-isolated TMADH and ETF semiquinone (ETFsq), with an extinction change of over 16.0 mm–1 cm–1 at 460 nm, has been reported (18Jones M. Talfournier F. Bobrov A. Grossmann J.G. Vekshin N. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8457-8465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 19Jones M. Basran J. Sutcliffe M.J. Grossmann J.G. Scrutton N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21349-21354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This extinction change exceeds the extinction coefficient for the anionic semiquinone at this wavelength, and the reported spectral change in fact closely resembles that seen upon reduction of TMADH. We have further examined the spectral change associated with mixing TMADHai with ETFsq (reduced by titration with sodium dithionite), rather than the fully oxidized ETFox. The observed spectral change is shown in Fig. 1A (dotted line). Surprisingly, this change is not at all like that reported previously (19Jones M. Basran J. Sutcliffe M.J. Grossmann J.G. Scrutton N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21349-21354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) but rather appears to be the mirror image of that seen in the experiment using TMADH and ETFox. It seems very likely that in the earlier study using ETFsq, the observed spectral change seen upon mixing TMADHox with ETFsq was caused by overtitration of ETF with excess reductant, which reduced TMADH when the two protein solutions were mixed. The observed mirror image relationship of the spectral changes seen for the (TMADHai + ETFox) experiment, on the one hand, and the (TMADHai + ETFsq) experiment on the other, is extremely surprising if, as has been previously concluded, the former is in fact caused by a change in the environment of the FAD of oxidized ETF because the spectral signatures of FAD and FAD. are quite distinct. The question is thus raised as to whether the observed spectral changes might instead reflect electron transfer processes (from TMADH to ETF in the first experiment, and partial reversal, from ETFsq to TMADH, in the second) rather than complex formation per se. For this to be the case, however, it would require that as-isolated TMADH be partially reduced, although perhaps to only a small degree. Similarly, electron transfer must be at least partially reversed (again possibly to only a small degree) in the second experiment. Binding of TMADHox and ETFox—If the observed spectral change seen on binding TMADHai to ETFox is caused by electron transfer and as-isolated TMADH is indeed partially reduced, then prior treatment of TMADH with oxidant should eliminate the observed spectral change. Fig. 2 shows a comparison of the spectral changes upon binding ETFox with as-isolated TMADH (from Fig. 1) or with oxidized enzyme (TMADHox) that had been pretreated with the oxidant ferricenium hexafluorophosphate. It is apparent that the extent of the observed spectral change is greatly decreased upon oxidization of TMADH, the difference spectrum being reduced essentially to the baseline. These results clearly indicate that as-isolated TMADH is partially reduced, although to only a small degree. From the absorbance change at 498 nm, and using a Δϵobs = Δϵ (TMADHox – TMADH2eq) + Δϵ (ETFsq – ETFox) = 5.4 + 1.21 = 6.61 mm–1 cm–1 (14Huang L. Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23958-23965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), we estimate that 1.40 μm re"
