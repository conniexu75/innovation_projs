https://openalex.org/W1984584304,"Local catabolism of the essential amino acid tryptophan is considered an important mechanism in regulating immunological and neurological responses. The kynurenine pathway is the main route for the non-protein metabolism of tryptophan. The intermediates of the kynurenine pathway are present at micromolar concentrations in blood and are regulated by inflammatory stimuli. Here we show that GPR35, a previously orphan G protein-coupled receptor, functions as a receptor for the kynurenine pathway intermediate kynurenic acid. Kynurenic acid elicits calcium mobilization and inositol phosphate production in a GPR35-dependent manner in the presence of Gqi/o chimeric G proteins. Kynurenic acid stimulates [35S]guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) binding in GPR35-expressing cells, an effect abolished by pertussis toxin treatment. Kynurenic acid also induces the internalization of GPR35. Expression analysis indicates that GPR35 is predominantly detected in immune cells and the gastrointestinal tract. Furthermore, we show that kynurenic acid inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor-α secretion in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Our results suggest unexpected signaling functions for kynurenic acid through GPR35 activation.

GPCRs contain seven transmembrane domains and are activated by a wide variety of ligands, including light, ions, metabolic intermediates, amino acids, nucleotides, lipids, peptides, and proteins. In addition to ∼250 characterized receptors, ∼120 human genes encode non-olfactory GPCRs whose ligands and function remain to be determined (1Fredriksson R. Schioth H.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1414-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). These orphan receptors are expected to play important roles in the regulation of a diversity of physiological functions. In the past decade an increasing number of GPCRs have been de-orphanized. Many of the identified ligands are metabolic intermediates, including succinate (ligand for GPR91) (5He W. Miao F.J. Lin D.C.

We have built a library of ∼300 biochemical intermediates to test their ability to activate orphan GPCRs. We identified kynurenic acid, one of the first metabolites of tryptophan isolated and characterized in mammals (13Ellinger A. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1904; 43: 325-337Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 14Homer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1914; 17: 509-518Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), as a ligand for GPR35. Cloned as an orphan GPCR in 1998 (15O'Dowd B.F. Nguyen T. Marchese A. Cheng R. Lynch K.R. Heng H.H. Kolakowski Jr., L.F. George S.R. Genomics. 1998; 47: 310-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), GPR35 shares 30% amino acid identity with GPR55. Expression analysis revealed prominent expression of GPR35 in immune and gastrointestinal tissues, suggesting potential physiological roles for GPR35 in these organs. Tryptophan metabolites such as serotonin and melatonin are well known ligands for GPCRs. Kynurenic acid has been reported to play important physiological roles in the brain (16Stone T.W. Darlington L.G. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 609-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 17Schwarcz R. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2004; 4: 12-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Most biological effects associated with kynurenic acid, such as neuroprotective activities, have been attributed to its antagonism on N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (16Stone T.W. Darlington L.G. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 609-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 18Stone T.W. Mackay G.M. Forrest C.M. Clark C.J. Darlington L.G. Clin. Chem. Lab. Med. 2003; 41: 852-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Here we have identified a novel mechanism by which kynurenic acid may regulate peripheral cellular responses through activation of GPR35. Cloning and Cell Culture—Full-length human, mouse, and rat GPR35 were cloned by PCR from human universal cDNA, mouse spleen cDNA, and rat spleen cDNA (BD Bioscience Clontech), respectively. Sequence-confirmed cDNAs were inserted into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 (Cellgro) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. HeLa and HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. All cell lines were cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2. CHO-GPR35 stable cells were generated by transfecting CHO cells with N-terminal-FLAG-tagged human GPR35 and subsequently selected in 1 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Flow cytometry analysis was carried out on FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) after staining with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) and goat anti-mouse IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate secondary antibody (Caltag). All compounds tested were from Sigma. Aequorin Assay—CHO cells were transfected with either empty vector or vector expressing GPR35 together with the aequorin reporter plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) (5He W. Miao F.J. Lin D.C. Schwandner R.T. Wang Z. Gao J. Chen J.L. Tian H. Ling L. Nature. 2004; 429: 188-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 19Stables J. Green A. Marshall F. Fraser N. Knight E. Sautel M. Milligan G. Lee M. Rees S. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 252: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). For each 10-cm dish, 5 μg of GPR35 and 5 μg of aequorin reporter plasmids were used. When indicated, 2 μg of plasmids expressing small G proteins (Gα16, Gqo5, Gqi9, and/or Gqs5) (20Amatruda T.T.

J. K. Industrievertetungen, Handel, Germany) at room temperature for 1 h, and stimulated with compounds. Ligand-induced calcium mobilization, as indicated by an increase in aequorin luminescence, was recorded over a period of 20 s with a Microlumat luminometer (Berthold). Inositol Phosphate Accumulation Assay—HEK293 cells seeded in 96-well plates were transfected with GPR35 (100 ng/well) and small G proteins (Gα16 or Gqo5, 20 ng/well). After labeling with [3H]myoinositol (Amersham Biosciences) for 16 h, cells were stimulated with compounds in Hanks' buffered salt solution, 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 10 mm LiCl, 0.01% bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for 1 h. 20 mm formic acid was used to lyse the cells at 4 °C for 4 h. Ysi-SPA beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added to the cell lysates and incubated overnight in the dark. Radioactivity was recorded on a Topcount 96/384 scintillation counter (Packard). GTPγS Binding Assay—CHO-GPR35 stable cells were pretreated with or without pertussis toxin (Calbiochem, 100 ng/ml) for 16 h before harvesting. Cells were resuspended and homogenized in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA followed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove nuclei and cellular debris. Membrane fractions were collected by spinning the supernatant at 38,000 × g for 30 min and resuspended in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) and 5 mm MgCl2. 25 μg of membranes was incubated at room temperature for 1 h in assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% bovine serum albumin (pH 7.5)) containing 3 μm GDP and 0.1 nm [35S]GTPγS (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in the absence or presence of kynurenic acid. Reactions were terminated by vacuum filtration through GF/B filters, and the retained radioactivities were quantified on liquid scintillation counter. Immunofluorescence Staining—HeLa cells were seeded on coverslips in 6-well plates and transfected with N-terminal-FLAG-tagged human, mouse, or rat GPR35. For surface staining, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, blocked with 5% goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline (Cellgro), and incubated with anti-FLAG M1 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) for 1 h on ice. After extensive washing in phosphate-buffered saline, cells were incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG-rhodamine secondary antibody for an additional 30 min. Internalization of GPR35 was induced by kynurenic acid (300 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C. After ligand stimulation, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton before staining with antibodies. Images were captured with a CCD digital camera connected to a Leica DC500 microscope. Quantitative RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA from human or mouse tissues (BD Biosciences Clontech) were treated with DNase I (Ambion) before reverse transcription. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed on an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detector using Taqman PCR core reagents (Applied Biosystems). Ratios of GPR35 to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase message RNA were calculated using a ΔΔCt method (Applied Biosystems). Primers and probes were designed using Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems). Primer and probe sequences for human GPR35 were GTGCCCTCCTGGAGACGAT (forward) and GCAGCAGTTGGCATCTGAGA (reverse) and for the probe, 5′-FAM-CGTCGCGCCCTGTACATAACCAGC-BHQ-3′. (FAM, 6-carboxyfluorescein; BHQ, black hole quencher). Primer and probe sequences for mouse GPR35 were ATCACAGGTAAACTCTCAGACACCAACT (forward) and CTTGAACGCTTCCTGGAACTCT (reverse) and for the probe, 5′-FAM-TGGATGCCATCTGTTACTACTACATGGCCA-BHQ-3′. In Situ Hybridization—Mouse GPR35 cDNA cloned in pCMV-SPORT6 vector (Invitrogen) was used as a template for generating RNA probes using T7 and SP6 RNA polymerase (Promega). [33P]UTP-labeled antisense or sense GPR35 RNA probes were hybridized to paraformaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded mouse tissue array (Imgenex). The hybridization buffer contained 50% formamide, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 10 mm NaH2PO4, 10% dextran sulfate, 1× Denhardt's solution, 0.5 mg/ml tRNA as described (24Chuang P.T. Kawcak T. McMahon A.P. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 342-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). After extensive washing, slides were exposed to x-ray film, dipped in emulsion type NTB (Kodak), and developed after 3 weeks. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin for nuclear visualization. Cytokine Secretion—Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and CD14+ monocytes were purchased from Allcells. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml, and monocytes were seeded at 2 × 105 cells/ml in 24-well plates in RPMI 1640 medium. Kynurenic acid was added 1 h before lipopolysaccharides (LPS (Sigma), final concentration at 10 ng/ml). Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 18 h, and supernatant was collected for cytokine assay. Untreated cells were used as controls. TNF-α concentrations were determined with Quantikine enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (R&D Systems) following the manufacturer's instructions. To search for natural ligands for orphan GPCRs, we tested a collection of ∼300 biochemical intermediates for their ability to evoke an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) using the aequorin assay (19Stables J. Green A. Marshall F. Fraser N. Knight E. Sautel M. Milligan G. Lee M. Rees S. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 252: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). CHO cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding human GPR35, aequorin reporter, and a mixture of promiscuous or chimeric small G proteins (Gα16, Gqs5, Gqo5, and Gqi9), which have been reported to couple with GPCRs that are not normally linked to Ca2+ signaling and shift their signal transduction to calcium mobilization (21Conklin B.R. Farfel Z. Lustig K.D. Julius D. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1993; 363: 274-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 22Coward P. Chan S.D. Wada H.G. Humphries G.M. Conklin B.R. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 270: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 23Milligan G. Marshall F. Rees S. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1996; 17: 235-237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Kynurenic acid evoked a specific rise in [Ca2+]i in cells expressing human GPR35 and G protein mixture, with a medium effective concentration (EC50)of39 μm (Fig. 1A). No specific response was observed in control cells (Fig. 1A). Kynurenic acid (structure shown in Fig. 1B)isa metabolite in the tryptophan metabolic pathway (Fig. 1C). Kynurenic acid also activated mouse and rat orthologues of GPR35 (Fig. 2). Quinolinic acid, another metabolite of the tryptophan pathway and often indicated to have opposing functions to kynurenic acid (16Stone T.W. Darlington L.G. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 609-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar), produced no response (Fig. 2). Interestingly, kynurenic acid is more potent on rodent GPR35 than on human GPR35, with EC50 values of 11 and 7 μm for mouse and rat GPR35, respectively. GPR35 was selectively activated by kynurenic acid but not by other tryptophan metabolic pathway intermediates (Table 1) such as 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid and 3-hydroxykynurenine that are implicated in T cell regulation (25Platten M. Ho P.P. Youssef S. Fontoura P. Garren H. Hur E.M. Gupta R. Lee L.Y. Kidd B.A. Robinson W.H. Sobel R.A. Selley M.L. Steinman L. Science. 2005; 310: 850-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Of ∼300 biochemical intermediates, kynurenic acid was found to be the most potent in stimulating GPR35 (data not shown). Furthermore, kynurenic acid did not activate ∼40 other GPCRs, including GPR55, the closest homologue of GPR35 (data not shown).TABLE 1Tryptophan metabolites potency in aequorin assay EC50 indicates the concentration of a compound that produces 50% of the maximum response and is calculated from dose-response curves.

The Gqi/o chimeras (22Coward P. Chan S.D. Wada H.G. Humphries G.M. Conklin B.R. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 270: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), Gqo5 and Gqi9, significantly potentiated the activation of GPR35 by kynurenic acid, whereas Gqs chimera (Gqs5) and the promiscuous G protein Gα16 did not (Fig. 3). The use of Gqi/o chimera was reported to allow the Gi/o-coupled GPCRs to signal via the Gq pathway, leading to calcium mobilization (21Conklin B.R. Farfel Z. Lustig K.D. Julius D. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1993; 363: 274-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). These results suggest that GPR35 may signal through Gi/o pathways in CHO cells. Kynurenic acid induced the accumulation of inositol phosphate in HEK293 cells transiently transfected with GPR35 and Gqo5 (Fig. 4). No inositol phosphate formation was detected in the absence of co-transfected G proteins, suggesting that GPR35 may not signal through the Gq pathway (Fig. 4). These results agree with the observation that the Gqi/o chimeras significantly enhanced GPR35 activation in the aequorin assay (Fig. 3). Flow cytometry analysis showed surface expression of GPR35 on CHO cells stably expressing N-terminal-FLAG-tagged human GPR35 but not vector control cells (Fig. 5A). Kynurenic acid stimulated [35S]GTPγS incorporation in membrane preparations from CHO-GPR35 cells, an effect abolished by preincubation with pertussis toxin (Fig. 5B). CHO-vector control cells did not respond to kynurenic acid (data not shown). The EC50 for kynurenic acid-induced activation of human GPR35 in [35S]GTPγS binding assay was 36 μm, similar to the EC50 value obtained from the aequorin assay. These results, together with the preference for Gqi/o chimeras in the aequorin and inositol phosphate formation assays suggest that GPR35 activation by kynurenic acid couples to a pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi/o pathway. Ligand-induced receptor internalization is often characteristic of GPCR activation and signal attenuation (26von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18448-18452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence staining of cells expressing N-terminal-FLAG-tagged human, mouse, or rat GPR35 revealed that GPR35 proteins from different species were localized to the plasma membrane (Fig. 6A). In contrast, a FLAG-tagged protein IKKβ (27Woronicz J.D. Gao X. Cao Z. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar) exhibited an expected intracellular localization (Fig. 6A). Kynurenic acid stimulation induced the translocation of GPR35 from plasma membrane to punctate intracellular structures (Fig. 6B), a characteristic of receptor internalization. Expression analysis by quantitative reverse transcriptase-mediated PCR revealed that both human GPR35 and mouse GPR35 were predominantly expressed in immune and gastrointestinal tissues, with limited expression in other tissues (Fig. 7). In humans, GPR35 messenger RNA was mainly detected in the peripheral leukocytes, spleen, small intestine, colon, and stomach (Fig. 7A). In mice, high levels of GPR35 expression were detected in the spleen and gastrointestinal tract (Fig. 7B). Similar results were obtained using primers and probes annealing to different regions of GPR35 (data not shown). Among various subpopulations of immune cells, GPR35 was detected in CD14+ monocytes, T cells, neutrophils, and dendritic cells, with lower expression in B cells, eosinophils, basophils, and platelets (Fig. 7C). In situ hybridization experiments using mouse multiple tissue arrays corroborated with quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR data. Specific GPR35-positive signals were detected in the spleen and gastrointestinal tract, including duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, colon, and rectum (Fig. 8A). GPR35 sense probe did not generate significant signals in these tissues (Fig. 8A). In various regions of the intestine (duodenum in Fig. 8B, ileum in Fig. 8C, and colon in Fig. 8D), GPR35 was primarily expressed in the epithelial cells located in the crypts of Lieberkühn, with lower expression in the intestinal villi. No significant signals were detected in lamina propria, muscularis propria, and enteric neurons (data not shown). To investigate the potential biological functions of kynurenic acid on immune cells expressing GPR35, we tested the effect of kynurenic acid on cytokine secretion in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Kynurenic acid by itself did not stimulate TNFα secretion in these cells (data not shown). However, kynurenic acid was able to attenuate LPS-induced TNFα secretion in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 9A). Similar results were obtained using purified peripheral blood CD14+ monocytes (Fig. 9B). In the current study we have identified kynurenic acid, an intermediate in the tryptophan metabolic pathway, as a ligand for GPR35. Kynurenic acid activated GPR35 in aequorin assay and inositol phosphate accumulation assay in the presence of Gqi/o chimeric G proteins. Kynurenic acid also stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding in a GPR35-dependent manner and induced the internalization of GPR35. The discovery of kynurenic acid as an endogenous ligand for GPR35 further highlighted the importance of tryptophan catabolism in regulating biological functions. The tryptophan metabolic pathway leading to the synthesis of kynurenine (kynurenine pathway) is the main route for non-protein metabolism of the essential amino acid tryptophan. Of the dietary tryptophan intake that is converted biochemically into other compounds, ∼99% is metabolized by the kynurenine pathway (16Stone T.W. Darlington L.G. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 609-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Given its roles in immunity and the central nervous system, the kynurenine pathway has emerged as an attractive target for drug development (16Stone T.W. Darlington L.G. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 609-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 17Schwarcz R. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2004; 4: 12-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 25Platten M. Ho P.P.

As an intermediate of the kynurenine pathway, kynurenic acid has been shown to be a naturally occurring antagonist for NMDA glutamate receptor (IC50 ∼ 8-15 μm in the absence of glycine; IC50 ∼ 230 μm in the presence of 10 μm glycine) (29Kessler M.

Neurobiol. 2002; 53: 479-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and mediates a neuroprotective effect. Another intermediate in the pathway, quinolinic acid, could excite neurons and cause neurotoxicity in the central nervous system by acting as an agonist at the NMDA receptors (17Schwarcz R. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2004; 4: 12-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 18Stone T.W. Mackay G.M. Forrest C.M. Clark C.J. Darlington L.G. Clin. Chem. Lab. Med. 2003; 41: 852-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The EC50 values of kynurenic acid on GPR35 activation reported in the current study are comparable with the concentration required for NMDA receptor antagonism. Tryptophan metabolic pathway is activated during inflammatory conditions such as viral invasion, bacterial lipopolysaccharide, or interferon-γ stimulation (31Taylor M.W. Feng G.S. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2516-2522Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar, 32Mellor A.L. Munn D.H. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 762-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1815) Google Scholar). The activation of tryptophan metabolism causes a reduced plasma tryptophan level and an elevation of kynurenic acid level (16Stone T.W. Darlington L.G. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 609-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Kynurenic acid has a basal plasma level of ∼140 nm (33Swartz K.J. During M.J. Freese A. Beal M.F. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 2965-2973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and its concentration is substantially elevated to micromolar level by inflammatory responses and cytokine release (34Heyes M.P. Saito K. Crowley J.S. Davis L.E. Demitrack M.A. Der M. Dilling L.A. Elia J. Kruesi M.J. Lackner A. et al.Brain. 1992; 115: 1249-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 35Saito K. Markey S.P.

Sci. 2002; 9: 436-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The concentrations of kynurenic acid required for GPR35 activation in in vitro assays are higher than basal plasma kynurenic acid level (EC50 values were ∼39, 11, and 7 μm for human, mouse, and rat GPR35, respectively, in aequorin assays). However, it is frequently observed that a much higher ligand concentration is required when Gi/o-coupled receptors are converted to Gq signaling by coexpressing chimeric G proteins (11Taggart A.K. Kero J. Gan X. Cai T.Q. Cheng K. Ippolito M. Ren N. Kaplan R. Wu K. Wu T.J. Jin L. Liaw C. Chen R. Richman J. Connolly D. Offermanns S. Wright S.D. Waters M.G. J. Biol.

Furthermore, serum or plasma measurements only reflect the concentration of kynurenic acid after diffusion and dilution from the site of release and, therefore, may underestimate the effective concentration at the site of action. This is particularly true when a local inflammatory reaction occurs after infection, injury, or immune cell activation. Because kynurenic acid is a metabolite that is not subject to rapid subsequent metabolism, it is conceivable that higher concentrations than blood levels can be achieved in local tissues to evoke a significant biological effect. The predominant expression of GPR35 in immune cells and the elevation of kynurenic acid levels during inflammation suggest that this receptor-ligand pair may play important roles in immunological regulation. In fact, kynurenic acid inhibited LPS-induced TNFα secretion in peripheral blood monocytes (Fig. 9). Because the tryptophan metabolic pathway is activated by pro-inflammatory stimuli, the anti-inflammatory effect of kynurenic acid provides an interesting feedback mechanism in modulating immune responses. More in depth studies are needed to address whether the anti-inflammatory effects of kynurenic acid are mediated by GPR35 activation. GPR35 is enriched in the intestinal crypts of Lieberkühn, which are rich in actively proliferating stem cells and progenitor cells crucial for the self-renewal of gastrointestinal epithelium (40Hauck A.L. Swanson K.S. Kenis P.J. Leckband D.E. Gaskins H.R. Schook L.B. Birth Defects Res. C. Embryo Today. 2005; 75: 58-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Interestingly, elevated plasma levels of kynurenic acid are reported in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (36Forrest C.M. Gould S.R. Darlington L.G. Stone T.W. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2003; 527: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 37Forrest C.M. Youd P. Kennedy A. Gould S.R. Darlington L.G. Stone T.W. J. Biomed. Sci. 2002; 9: 436-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The involvement of GPR35 in inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease and other gastrointestinal disorders should be further investigated. GPR35 has limited expression in the brain, where kynurenic acid is known to exert neuroprotective effects (18Stone T.W. Mackay G.M. Forrest C.M. Clark C.J. Darlington L.G. Clin. Chem. Lab. Med. 2003; 41: 852-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Although mechanisms such as NMDA receptor blockade by kynurenic acid have been recognized, the roles of GPR35 in these processes are unknown. It remains to be investigated whether some of the effects mediated by kynurenic acid in the brain might result from GPR35 activation. GPR35-deficient mice will be valuable for dissecting the biological functions of kynurenic acid. GPR35 has been reported as a potential oncogene implicated in gastric cancer (41Okumura S. Baba H. Kumada T. Nanmoku K. Nakajima H. Nakane Y. Hioki K. Ikenaka K. Cancer Sci. 2004; 95: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The kynurenine pathway is activated in immune cells surrounding the core of solid tumors (16Stone T.W. Darlington L.G. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 609-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). It is possible that kynurenic acid produced by activated immune cells could stimulate the abnormal growth of gastrointestinal cells expressing GPR35, contributing to tumorigenesis in these tissues. Thus, we have identified the tryptophan metabolite kynurenic acid as an endogenous ligand for GPR35. This study together with others (5He W. Miao F.J. Lin D.C. Schwandner R.T. Wang Z. Gao J.

https://openalex.org/W2154353368,"There are growing data to suggest that tissue hypoxia represents a critical force that drives adult vasculogenesis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression is dramatically up-regulated by hypoxia and results in enhanced neovascularization. Although the role of VEGF in angiogenesis has been well characterized, its role in adult vasculogenesis remains poorly understood. We used two distinct murine bone marrow transplantation (BMT) models to demonstrate that increased VEGF levels at the site of tumor growth promoted vasculogenesis in vivo. This effect of VEGF was downstream of its effect to enhance either mobilization or survival of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). Both VEGFR1 (flt1) and VEGFR2 (flk1) are expressed on culture expanded human EPCs. Previous studies suggest that the effect of VEGF on endothelial cell migration is primarily mediated via VEGFR2; however, VEGF-induced EPC migration in vitro was mediated by both receptors, suggesting that VEGF-VEGFR1 interactions in EPCs are distinct from differentiated endothelial cells. We used specific blocking antibodies to these receptors to demonstrate that VEGFR1 plays an important role in human EPC recruitment to tumors. These findings were further supported by our finding that tumor-associated placental growth factor (PlGF), a VEGFR1-specific agonist, increased tumor vasculogenesis in a murine BMT model. We further showed that both VEGF receptors were necessary for the formation of functional vessels derived from exogenously administered human ex vivo expanded EPCs. Our data suggest local VEGF and/or PlGF expression promote vasculogenesis; VEGF plays a role in EPC recruitment and subsequent formation of functional vessels."
https://openalex.org/W2086530747,"Although bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are clinically useful for bone regeneration, large amounts are required to induce new bone formation in monkeys and humans. We found recently that heparin stimulates BMP activity in vitro (Takada, T., Katagiri, T., Ifuku, M., Morimura, N., Kobayashi, M., Hasegawa, K., Ogamo, A., and Kamijo, R. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 43229-43235). In the present study, we examined whether heparin enhances bone formation induced by BMPs in vivo and attempted to determine the molecular mechanism by which heparin stimulates BMP activity using C2C12 myoblasts. Heparin enhanced BMP-2-induced gene expression and Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation at 24 h and thereafter, although not within 12 h. Heparitinase treatment did not affect the response of cells to BMP-2. In the presence of heparin, degradation of BMP-2 was blocked, and the half-life of BMP-2 in the culture medium was prolonged by nearly 20-fold. Although noggin mRNA was induced by BMP-2 within 1 h regardless of the presence of heparin, noggin failed to inhibit BMP-2 activity in the presence of heparin. Furthermore, simultaneous administration of BMP-2 and heparin in vivo dose-dependently induced larger amounts of mineralized bone tissue compared with BMP-2 alone. These findings clearly indicate that heparin enhances BMP-induced osteoblast differentiation not only in vitro but also in vivo. This study indicates that heparin enhances BMP-induced osteoblast differentiation in vitro and in vivo by protecting BMPs from degradation and inhibition by BMP antagonists. Although bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are clinically useful for bone regeneration, large amounts are required to induce new bone formation in monkeys and humans.

Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) 2The abbreviations used are: BMPs, bone morphogenetic proteins; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; ALP, alkaline phosphatase.2The abbreviations used are: BMPs, bone morphogenetic proteins; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; ALP, alkaline phosphatase. were originally identified as an activity inducing ectopic bone formation when implanted into muscle tissue (1Urist M.R. Science. 1965; 150: 893-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (4426) Google Scholar). Isolation of BMPs using heparin affinity column chromatography and molecular cloning of BMPs revealed that the ectopic bone-inducing activity is due to several BMPs (2Sampath T.K. Muthukumaran N.

Wang E.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1528-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (3306) Google Scholar). More than 15 BMPs have since been identified in vertebrates and are classified into several subgroups: the BMP-2/4 subgroup, the BMP-5/6/7/8 subgroup, the GDF (growth and differentiation factor)-5 (also termed BMP-14)/GDF-6 (BMP-13)/GDF-7 (BMP-12) subgroup, and the BMP-3 subgroup (4Katagiri T.

With the exception of BMP-1, BMPs are members of the TGF-β superfamily, which includes multifunctional factors in vertebrates and invertebrates (3Wozney J.M. Rosen V. Celeste A.J. Mitsock L.M. Whitters M.J. Kriz R.W. Hewick R.M. Wang E.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1528-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (3306) Google Scholar). BMPs play critical roles in skeletal development, especially in mammals (4Katagiri T. Takahashi N. Oral Dis. 2002; 8: 147-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 5Canalis E. Economides A.N.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 328: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). BMPs regulate the differentiation and function of cells that are involved in bone and cartilage formation and deformation, including osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and osteoclasts (4Katagiri T. Takahashi N. Oral Dis. 2002; 8: 147-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 5Canalis E. Economides A.N. Gazzerro E. Endocr.

A cell culture system using C2C12 myoblasts can mimic part of the process of the ectopic bone formation induced by BMPs in muscle tissue (8Katagiri T. Yamaguchi A. Komaki M. Abe E. Takahashi N. Ikeda T. Rosen V. Wozney J.M. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Suda T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1755-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). BMPs inhibit myogenic differentiation of myoblasts into mature muscle cells and convert their differentiation pathway into that of osteoblast lineage cells. Using this model system in vitro, a critical factor for osteoblast differentiation (termed Osterix) has been cloned as a novel zinc finger transcription factor induced by BMP-2 (9Nakashima K. Zhou X. Kunkel G. Zhang Z. Deng J.M. Behringer R.R. de Crombrugghe B. Cell. 2002; 108: 17-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2700) Google Scholar). Osterix knock-out mice do not have bone tissues because of lack of osteoblast differentiation from mesenchymal progenitor cells (9Nakashima K. Zhou X. Kunkel G. Zhang Z. Deng J.M. Behringer R.R. de Crombrugghe B. Cell. 2002; 108: 17-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2700) Google Scholar). Although several growth factors, including TGF-β and activin, inhibit the myogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells in vitro, they do not induce osteoblast differentiation (8Katagiri T. Yamaguchi A. Komaki M. Abe E. Takahashi N. Ikeda T. Rosen V. Wozney J.M. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Suda T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1755-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar, 10Ladd A.N. Yatskievych T.A. Antin P.B. Dev. Biol. 1998; 204: 407-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). It has been reported that TGF-β itself fails to induce ectopic bone formation in vivo (2Sampath T.K. Muthukumaran N. Reddi A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7109-7113Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the C2C12 cell model system is useful for examining the molecular mechanisms of TGF-β superfamily members during ectopic bone formation in muscle tissue. It should therefore be useful for examining the molecular mechanism of bone formation and osteoblast differentiation induced by BMPs. BMP signaling is transduced by two types of transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors. BMP receptors IA (ALK-3) and IB (ALK-6), ALK-1, and ALK-2 function as type I BMP receptors, whereas BMP receptor II and activin receptors II and IIB function as type II receptors, which are constitutively active kinases (4Katagiri T. Takahashi N. Oral Dis. 2002; 8: 147-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 11Yoon B.S. Lyons K.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 93: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 12Miyazawa K.

Biol. 2001; 239: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). After type II receptors phosphorylate type I receptors in a ligand-dependent fashion, activated type I receptors phosphorylate downstream molecules in the cytoplasm. The Smad1/5/8 transcription factors are phosphorylated by BMP type I receptors in the cytoplasm as substrates and accumulate in the nucleus within 1 h after BMP stimulation (4Katagiri T. Takahashi N. Oral Dis. 2002; 8: 147-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 11Yoon B.S. Lyons K.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 93: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 12Miyazawa K. Shinozaki M.

Biol. 2001; 239: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated Smad proteins directly regulate expression of primary target genes through binding to their promoter or enhancer elements together with Smad4 and other transcription factors (14ten Dijke P. Korchynskyi O. Valdimarsdottir G. Goumans M.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2003; 211: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 15Ito Y. Miyazono K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). BMP activity is positively and negatively regulated by many types of molecules both intracellularly and in the extracellular environment (7Wan M. Cao X. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 328: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 13von Bubnoff A. Cho K.W. Dev. Biol. 2001; 239: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 16Balemans W. Van Hul W. Dev. Biol. 2002; 250: 231-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Various corepressors and coactivators of Smad proteins have been identified in the cytoplasm or nucleus in mammalian cells. Noggin, chordin, follistatin, and the DAN family proteins bind to BMPs in the extracellular space and inhibit binding of ligands to cell-surface receptors (16Balemans W. Van Hul W. Dev. Biol. 2002; 250: 231-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, heparin enhances BMP-induced osteoblast differentiation in C2C12 myoblasts in vitro (17Takada T. Katagiri T. Ifuku M. Morimura N. Kobayashi M. Hasegawa K. Ogamo A. Kamijo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43229-43235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Other types of sulfated polysaccharides such as native heparan sulfate and synthetic dextran sulfate also stimulate BMP-2 (17Takada T. Katagiri T. Ifuku M. Morimura N. Kobayashi M. Hasegawa K. Ogamo A. Kamijo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43229-43235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The capacity of these sulfated polysaccharides to stimulate BMP-2 appears to depend on the size and number of their sulfated residues (17Takada T. Katagiri T. Ifuku M. Morimura N. Kobayashi M. Hasegawa K. Ogamo A. Kamijo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43229-43235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Heparin does not enhance osteoblast differentiation induced by direct activation of the BMP intracellular signaling pathway by overexpression of a constitutively active BMP receptor without addition of BMPs (17Takada T.

This finding suggests that heparin primarily exhibits effects upstream of the BMP receptor, including BMP ligands, rather than on the BMP intracellular signaling pathway. Heparin has been reported to enhance the activities of fibroblast growth factors by increasing the affinity of ligands for receptors as a coreceptor (18Olwin B.B. Burrus L.W. Zuber M.E. Lueddecke B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1991; 638: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 19Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2070) Google Scholar). However, heparin decreases the amount of BMP-2·receptor complex in C2C12 cells, suggesting that a novel mechanism of the heparin activity is involved in the case of BMPs (17Takada T. Katagiri T. Ifuku M. Morimura N. Kobayashi M. Hasegawa K. Ogamo A. Kamijo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43229-43235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The unique and specific capacity of BMPs to induce new bone formation in vivo should be useful for the development of therapeutic drugs for in vivo bone regeneration (1Urist M.R. Science. 1965; 150: 893-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (4426) Google Scholar, 20Sykaras N. Opperman L.A. J. Oral Sci. 2003; 45: 57-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). However, it has been reported that >100-fold larger amounts of BMPs are required to induce bone formation in higher animals such as monkeys and humans than in rodents (21Kusumoto K. Bessho K. Fujimura K. Akioka J. Okubo Y. Wang Y. Iizuka T. Ogawa Y. J. Int. Med. Res. 2002; 30: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We speculated that simultaneous administration of BMPs with sulfated polysaccharides might reduce the amounts of BMPs required to induce clinically useful amounts of new bone in vivo. In this study, we found that heparin stimulates the ectopic bone-forming activity of BMP-2 in vivo and propose a novel mechanism of the effects of heparin on BMP signaling in target cells. Recombinant Proteins and Heparin—Purified recombinant human BMP-2 was obtained from Astellas Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Recombinant human BMP-4 and BMP-6 and recombinant mouse noggin/Fc chimera were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Heparin prepared from porcine intestine and low molecular weight heparin was purchased from Sigma. Purified heparin for injection into patients was obtained from Fuso Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd.

The cells were treated with BMPs in the presence or absence of heparin in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2.5% fetal bovine serum. The concentrations of BMP-2 in the culture medium were quantified using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (R&D Systems). Alkaline Phosphatase Activity—Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was measured as a marker of osteoblast differentiation (8Katagiri T. Yamaguchi A. Komaki M. Abe E. Takahashi N. Ikeda T. Rosen V. Wozney J.M. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Suda T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1755-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). Cells treated with an acetone/ethanol mixture (50:50, v/v) were incubated with a substrate solution composed of 0.1 m diethanolamine, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate. The reaction was terminated by adding NaOH, and A values were measured at 405 nm. Reverse Transcription-PCR—The gene expression levels were determined by reverse transcription-PCR (22Yanai T. Katagiri T. Akiyama S. Imada M. Yamashita T. Chiba H. Takahashi N. Suda T. J. Bone Miner. Metab. 2001; 19: 345-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Total RNAs were extracted from C2C12 cells with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and then reverse-transcribed using SuperScript II (Invitrogen). PCR amplification was performed with Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and the following primers: ALP, GATCATTCCCACGTTTTCAC and TGCGGGCTTGTGGGACCTGC; osteocalcin, CAAGTCCCACACAGCAGCTT and AAAGCCGAGCTGCCAGAGTT; Runx2 type I, ATGCGTATTCCTGTAGATCC and CTACAACCTTGAAGGCCACG; Runx2 types II and III, ATGCTTCATTCATTCGCCTCACAAAC and CCAAAAGAAGCTTTGCTG; Osterix, TTAAGCTTGCGTCCTCTCTGCTTGA and TTTCTAGATCAGATCTCTAGCAGGTT; noggin, ATGGAGCGCTGCCCCAGCCT and CTAGCAGGAACACTTACACT; and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, TGAAGGTCGGTGTGAACGGATTGGC and CATGTAGGCCATGAGGTCCACCAC. cDNA was denatured at 94 °C for 5 min, followed by 25 repeated cycles at 94 °C for 45 s, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and extension at 68 °C for 1 min. Histochemical Analysis—To determine protein levels immunohistochemically, cells were incubated with appropriate primary and secondary antibodies as described (8Katagiri T. Yamaguchi A. Komaki M. Abe E. Takahashi N. Ikeda T. Rosen V. Wozney J.M. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Suda T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1755-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). The following primary antibodies were used: anti-heparan sulfate clone F58-10E4 (Seika-gaku Corp., Tokyo), anti-phosphorylated Smad1/5/8 (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA), and anti-myosin heavy chain clone MF-20 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA). To determine ALP activity histochemically, cells were stained for enzyme activity as described (8Katagiri T. Yamaguchi A. Komaki M. Abe E. Takahashi N. Ikeda T. Rosen V. Wozney J.M. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Suda T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1755-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). Staining was visualized with a BX50 fluorescence microscope with a DP50 digital CCD camera (Olympus Corp., Tokyo). Western Blot Analysis—C2C12 cells were treated with 100 ng/ml BMP-2 in the presence or absence of 5 μg/ml heparin and then lysed in Tris-buffered saline (25 mm Tris-HCl and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) containing 1% Triton X-100 and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics) as described (17Takada T.

The lysates were subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Phosphorylated and total Smad1/5/8 proteins were detected using anti-phosphorylated Smad1/5/8 antibody and anti-Smad1 antibody (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY), respectively. Determination of the Amounts of BMP-2—C2C12 cells were incubated for up to 50 h with 100 ng/ml BMP-2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2.5% fetal bovine serum. At each time point, the culture medium and cell lysate, which were prepared by extracting the cells with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 m urea for 30 min at room temperature, were obtained and kept at −80 °C until used. The amounts of BMP-2 in the culture medium and cell lysates were determined using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ectopic Bone Formation Assay—The effects of heparin on bone formation in vivo induced by BMP-2 were examined by ectopic bone formation assay in mice (24Toyoda H. Terai H. Sasaoka R. Oda K. Takaoka K. Bone (NY). 2005; 37: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Five μg of BMP-2 and 0, 0.25, 2.5, or 25 μg of heparin were mixed and added to 20 ml of 0.01 m HCl solution; blotted onto a collagen sponge disk (6-mm diameter, 1-mm thickness) fabricated from commercially available bovine collagen sheets (Helistat, Integra Neuro-Sciences, Plainsboro, NJ); freeze-dried; and kept at −20 °C until implanted into mice. All procedures were carried out under sterile conditions. Twenty-four male ICR mice (4-week-old; Nippon SLC, Hamamatsu, Japan) were housed and acclimated in cages with free access to food and water for 1 week, and they were divided into four groups (eight mice/group). The mice were anesthetized by diethyl ether gas inhalation, and the collagen pellets prepared as described above were surgically implanted into both dorsal muscle pouches (two pellets/animal) of the mice. At 2, 3, and 4 weeks after surgery, the mice were killed, and the implants were harvested and processed for histological analysis as follows. All harvested samples were radiographed with a soft x-ray apparatus (Sofron Co., Ltd., Tokyo). The bone mineral content (milligrams/ossicle) of each ossicle was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry using a bone mineral analyzer (DCS-600EX, ALOKA, Inc., Tokyo). Sections of the ossicles or tissue mass from each group were stained with hematoxylin/eosin and examined under a light microscope. Differences in bone mineral density among groups were evaluated by one-way analysis of variance To adjust for multiple comparisons when one-way analysis of variance showed a significant difference between groups (p < 0.05), Fisher's least significant difference post hoc test was used to identify which group differences accounted for the significant p value. The analyses were conducted using StatView Version 5.0 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). Specificity of the Enhancing Effect of Heparin on Induction of ALP Activity by BMPs—We first compared the effect of heparin on ALP activity, a typical marker of osteoblast differentiation, induced by BMP-2, BMP-4, and BMP-6 in C2C12 cells. As we reported previously (17Takada T. Katagiri T. Ifuku M. Morimura N. Kobayashi M. Hasegawa K. Ogamo A. Kamijo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43229-43235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), heparin at 5 μg/ml enhanced the ALP activity induced by both BMP-2 and BMP-4 (Fig. 1, A and B). In contrast, the enzyme activity induced by BMP-6 was suppressed by heparin (Fig. 1C). Drosophila DPP, a homolog of mammalian BMP-2 and BMP-4, failed to induce ALP activity in the presence or absence of heparin in our assay system (data not shown), although highly purified heparin had effects on BMP-2 similar to those of the heparin used throughout this study (Fig. 1D). Low molecular weight heparin, which is ∼5-fold smaller than native heparin, also enhanced induction of ALP activity by BMP-2, but to a lesser extent than native heparin (Fig. 1D). The estimated ED50 values of low molecular weight heparin and native heparin were 10 and 2 μg/ml, respectively, suggesting that the size of sulfated polysaccharides is critical for enhancement of induction of ALP activity by BMPs. Role of Endogenous Heparan Sulfate and Pretreatment with Heparin in Responses to BMPs—C2C12 cells expressed heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the cell surface and/or in the extracellular space (Fig. 2A, upper panels). We next examined the role of endogenous heparan sulfate in responses to BMP-2. When C2C12 cells were pretreated with heparitinase and then further cultured with BMP-2 in the presence of heparitinase, endogenous heparan sulfate was removed from the cultures in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A, upper panels). However, similar numbers of ALP-positive cells were induced by BMP-2 regardless of the presence of heparitinase (Fig. 2A, lower panels). Furthermore, the dose dependence of the effects of BMP-2 on ALP activity was nearly equivalent in the presence and absence of 0.1 unit/ml heparitinase (Fig. 2B). We reported previously (17Takada T. Katagiri T. Ifuku M. Morimura N. Kobayashi M. Hasegawa K. Ogamo A. Kamijo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43229-43235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) that heparin does not enhance osteoblast differentiation induced by activation of a signaling pathway downstream of BMP receptors, suggesting that a primary target of heparin is upstream of the receptor. In agreement with this finding, pretreatment of C2C12 cells with heparin on Days −1 to 0 did not enhance the ALP activity induced by BMP-2 on Day 3 (Fig. 2C). Moreover, preincubation of BMP-2 with heparin before treatment did not affect ALP activity (Fig. 2C). Although we cannot rule out the possibility that the preincubation with heparin was negligible on Day 3, these results suggest that heparin rapidly modifies BMP-2 in culture medium. Time Dependence of the Effects of Heparin on BMP-2 Activity—We further examined the time courses of changes in the expression levels of genes related to osteoblast differentiation, such as ALP, osteocalcin, Osterix, and Runx2 type I and types II and III (Fig. 3). The levels of Runx2 type I were not changed by BMP stimulation either with or without heparin until 48 h. Expression of the other genes was induced by BMP-2 and further stimulated by heparin after 24 h. However, the extent of induction of Osterix by BMP-2 at 4 h was not enhanced by heparin (Fig. 3). We next assessed whether heparin affects the levels of phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 induced by BMP-2. BMP-2-induced phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 peaked within 1 h and gradually decreased until 72 h (Fig. 4, A and B). Interestingly, the phosphorylation levels of Smad proteins were not affected within 12 h by heparin, but were increased at 24 and 48 h (Fig. 4A). This time-dependent effect of heparin on the phosphorylation of Smad proteins was further confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis. Accumulation of phosphorylated Smad1/5/8 in nuclei was increased by BMP-2 stimulation at 24 h and thereafter only in the presence of heparin (Fig. 4B). We further examined the time dependence of the enhancing effects of heparin on the phosphorylation of Smad proteins induced by BMP-2. C2C12 cells were stimulated with BMP-2 in the presence or absence of heparin for 1 or 24 h on Day 1 or 2 after cell inoculation to examine the effect of cell growth on the stimulatory capacity of heparin. Phosphorylated Smad proteins were increased only in cultures treated for 24 h with BMP-2 in the presence of heparin (Fig. 4C), suggesting that the enhancement of Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation by heparin depends on the period of treatment and not the day of incubation. We examined the effect of heparin on the stability of phosphorylated Smad proteins. C2C12 cells were pretreated for 1 or 6 h with BMP-2 to induce Smad phosphorylation, cultured without BMP-2, and finally examined for the levels of phosphorylated Smad proteins at 24 h. Phosphorylated Smad proteins were undetectable in cultures pretreated with BMP-2 for 1 or 6 h even in the presence of heparin (Fig. 4D), suggesting that heparin enhances the levels of phosphorylated Smad proteins induced by BMP-2 without increasing their stability. Heparin Maintains the Concentration of BMP-2 in Culture Medium—Because phosphorylated Smad proteins were increased by heparin only in the presence of BMP-2, we determined the amounts of BMP-2 in the culture medium in the presence and absence of heparin. Surprisingly, in the absence of heparin, the concentration of BMP-2 in the culture medium rapidly decreased below 50% of the original concentration within 1 h and was almost undetectable after 10 h (Fig. 5A). In contrast, in the presence of heparin, >60% of BMP-2 remained in the culture medium at 12 h, and BMP-2 was still detectable at 50 h (Fig. 5A). We also determined the amounts of BMP-2 in cell layers throughout the culture period. As shown in Fig. 5A (right panel), the amounts of BMP-2 were <10% in the presence and absence of BMP-2, suggesting that the disappearance of BMP-2 from the culture medium is due to degradation of the ligand rather than accumulation in cell layers. We next examined whether BMP-2 in culture medium affects the differentiation of C2C12 cells in the absence of heparin. When C2C12 cells were treated for 3 days with graded concentrations of BMP-2, myogenic differentiation was almost completely inhibited by 100 ng/ml BMP-2, and osteoblast differentiation was induced by 300 ng/ml BMP-2 (Fig. 5B) (8Katagiri T. Yamaguchi A. Komaki M. Abe E. Takahashi N. Ikeda T. Rosen V. Wozney J.M. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Suda T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1755-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). However, these concentrations were decreased to approximately one-third to one-tenth when the culture medium was changed every 24 h to keep the concentrations of BMP-2 in the medium (Fig. 5B). These findings suggest that heparin blocks the rapid decrease in the BMP concentration in culture medium and that lower concentrations of BMP-2 are capable of affecting the pathway of differentiation of C2C12 cells if they are continuously stimulated by daily refreshment of ligand. Heparin Protects BMP Activity from Inhibition by Noggin—Noggin, a BMP antagonist that blocks BMP signaling in the extracellular space, is induced by BMPs as an early-response gene (25Gazzerro E. Gangji V. Canalis E. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 102: 2106-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Noggin mRNA was induced within 1 h after BMP-2 stimulation in C2C12 cells (Fig. 6A). The level of induction of noggin mRNA by BMP-2 was not enhanced by heparin at 1 h, but was increased at 72 h (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, exogenously added recombinant noggin dose-dependently decreased the numbers of ALP-positive cells induced by 300 ng/ml BMP-2. In contrast, 100 ng/ml BMP-2 with 5 μg/ml heparin induced similar ALP activity levels compared with 300 ng/ml BMP-2 alone. Under this condition, large numbers of ALP-positive cells remained even in the presence of 300 ng/ml exogenous noggin (Fig. 6B). These data suggest that heparin protects BMPs from inhibition by noggin. Heparin Stimulates the Ectopic Bone Formation Induced by BMP-2 in Vivo—Finally, we examined the enhancing effect of heparin on BMP-2 activity in vivo. BMP-2 induced ectopic bone formation within 2 weeks in mice. Heparindose-dependently increased the size of new bone induced by BMP-2 for up to 4 weeks (Fig. 7, A and B). Heparin alone preserved more bone tissue induced by BMP-2 after 4 weeks of incubation than did BMP-2 alone (data not shown). Bone mineral density was also increased by heparin in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 7C). At 4 weeks, the insides of the bone pellets treated with BMP-2 alone were filled with bone marrow. In the presence of heparin, however, not only bone marrow but also a large amount of trabecular bone was observed in the pellets (Fig. 7D). Some groups, including our own, have reported independently that sulfated polysaccharides such as heparin, heparan sulfate, and dextran sulfate enhance the osteoblast differentiation induced by BMPs in vitro (17Takada T. Katagiri T. Ifuku M. Morimura N. Kobayashi M. Hasegawa K. Ogamo A. Kamijo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43229-43235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 26Ruppert R. Hoffmann E. Sebald W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). In this study, we have demonstrated that heparin enhanced the bone formation induced by BMP-2 in vivo as well. In the presence of heparin, BMP-2 induced larger amounts of mineralized bone tissues within 2 weeks in mice. Moreover, we have demonstrated that low molecular weight heparin, which is smaller than native unfractionated heparin and is widely used clinically, also enhanced BMP-2 activity at least in vitro, although the specific activity of low molecular weight heparin in enhancing this effect was less than that of native heparin. This confirmed our previous finding that sulfated polysaccharides stimulate BMP activities in a size-dependent fashion (17Takada T. Katagiri T. Ifuku M. Morimura N. Kobayashi M. Hasegawa K. Ogamo A. Kamijo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43229-43235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggest that simultaneous application of BMP-2 and sulfated polysaccharides is useful for regeneration of local bone tissues in vivo. This possibility requires examination in in vivo models of bone regeneration in higher animals. Cultured cells express various types of proteoglycans, which consist of core proteins and polysaccharide chains, including heparan sulfate (27Pacifici M. Shimo T. Gentili C. Kirsch T. Freeman T.A. Enomoto-Iwamoto M. Iwamoto M. Koyama E. J. Bone Miner. Metab. 2005; 23: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 28Couchman J.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 926-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 29Belting M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 145-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). We have shown that not only heparin but also other types of sulfated polysaccharides such as native heparan sulfate and synthetic dextran sulfate enhance BMP activities (17Takada T. Katagiri T. Ifuku M. Morimura N. Kobayashi M. Hasegawa K. Ogamo A. Kamijo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43229-43235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). These proteoglycans may accumulate on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix and regulate BMP activities. Indeed, it has been reported that cell-surface proteoglycans inhibit the activity of BMP-7 in ROS17/2.8 osteosarcoma cells (30Irie A. Habuchi H. Kimata K. Sanai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 308: 858-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, removal of heparan sulfate from cultures of C2C12 cells did not affect the osteoblast differentiation that occurred in response to BMP-2. This discrepancy in findings may due to differences in the cell types tested, i.e. osteosarcoma versus myoblasts, or in BMP subgroups, BMP-7 versus BMP-2. Interestingly, heparin inhibited the ALP activity that was stimulated by BMP-6 in C2C12 cells. BMP-6 is classified into the same subgroup as BMP-7 (but not BMP-2/4) based on amino acid similarity (31Celeste A.J. Iannazzi J.A. Taylor R.C. Hewick R.M. Rosen V. Wang E.A. Wozney J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9843-9847Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). It appears that the positive or negative effects of sulfated polysaccharides on BMP activities depend on the primary structures of BMPs. Although all amino acid sequences of BMP-2-8 were identified in the bone-inducing fraction purified from bone extracts using a heparin column, the structures of the N termini of BMP-2 and BMP-4, which are thought to be the heparin-binding domains, are quite different from those of BMP-6 and BMP-7 (26Ruppert R. Hoffmann E. Sebald W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 31Celeste A.J. Iannazzi J.A. Taylor R.C. Hewick R.M. Rosen V. Wang E.A. Wozney J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9843-9847Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). These differences may affect the three-dimensional structures and receptor-binding abilities of ligand·heparin complexes. Indeed, different types of receptors have been identified for the BMP-2 and BMP-7 subgroups (4Katagiri T. Takahashi N. Oral Dis. 2002; 8: 147-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 5Canalis E. Economides A.N. Gazzerro E. Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 218-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). These issues require further examination. Heparin is thought to increase the binding affinity of fibroblast growth factor for its specific receptor and thereby enhance downstream signaling (18Olwin B.B. Burrus L.W. Zuber M.E. Lueddecke B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1991; 638: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 19Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2070) Google Scholar). A similar mechanism seems unlikely to occur in the case of BMPs because heparin does not stimulate complex formation between BMP-2 and the BMP type IA receptor on the surface of C2C12 cells (17Takada T. Katagiri T. Ifuku M. Morimura N. Kobayashi M. Hasegawa K. Ogamo A. Kamijo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43229-43235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Moreover, heparin failed to stimulate certain early events in response to BMP-2, such as the phosphorylation of Smad proteins and the induction of early-response genes, including noggin and osterix. Instead, heparin required >12 h to stimulate the events induced by BMP-2. Interestingly, we found that heparin maintained the concentration of BMP-2 in the culture medium at higher levels and protected BMP-2 from inhibition by noggin, which was induced as part of the negative feedback loop in response to BMP-2. On the basis of the findings we obtained, we propose a novel mechanism for the stimulatory activity of heparin on BMPs (Fig. 8). In the absence of heparin, BMP activities are negatively regulated by the inhibitory microenvironment, e.g. immediate decreases in the amounts of active ligands due to degradation, and BMP antagonists are induced by BMP signaling as part of the negative feedback loop to suppress excess signaling. However, in the presence of heparin, bioactive BMPs remain in the extracellular space for a longer period, and active ligands are protected from suppression by antagonists. In conclusion, heparin stimulated not only the osteoblast differentiation induced by BMP-2 and BMP-4 in vitro but also the bone formation induced by BMP-2 in vivo. It appears that heparin stimulates BMP activities by protecting ligands from the inhibitory microenvironment around target cells rather than increasing receptor-binding affinity. These findings suggest that simultaneous administration of BMPs with sulfated polysaccharides should be clinically useful at least for local bone regeneration.

https://openalex.org/W2031196559,"Here we demonstrate that type I protein kinase A is redoxactive, forming an interprotein disulfide bond between its two regulatory RI subunits in response to cellular hydrogen peroxide. This oxidative disulfide formation causes a subcellular translocation and activation of the kinase, resulting in phosphorylation of established substrate proteins. The translocation is mediated at least in part by the oxidized form of the kinase having an enhanced affinity for alpha-myosin heavy chain, which serves as a protein kinase A (PKA) anchor protein and localizes the PKA to its myofilament substrates troponin I and myosin binding protein C. The functional consequence of these events in cardiac myocytes is that hydrogen peroxide increases contractility independently of beta-adrenergic stimulation and elevations of cAMP. The oxidant-induced phosphorylation of substrate proteins and increased contractility is blocked by the kinase inhibitor H89, indicating that these events involve PKA activation. In essence, type I PKA contains protein thiols that operate as redox sensors, and their oxidation by hydrogen peroxide directly activates the kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2003315040,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are neurodevelopmental conditions characterized by impaired social interaction, communication skills, and restricted and repetitive behavior. The genetic causes for autism are largely unknown. Previous studies implicate CACNA1C (L-type CaV1.2) calcium channel mutations in a disorder associated with autism (Timothy syndrome). Here, we identify missense mutations in the calcium channel gene CACNA1H (T-type CaV3.2) in 6 of 461 individuals with ASD. These mutations are located in conserved and functionally relevant domains and are absent in 480 ethnically matched controls (p = 0.014, Fisher's exact test). Non-segregation within the pedigrees between the mutations and the ASD phenotype clearly suggest that the mutations alone are not responsible for the condition. However, functional analysis shows that all these mutations significantly reduce CaV3.2 channel activity and thus could affect neuronal function and potentially brain development. We conclude that the identified mutations could contribute to the development of the ASD phenotype.

Autism spectrum disorders affect ∼0.5% of children in the general population and cause great morbidity (1Bryson S.E. Rogers S.J. Fombonne E. Can. J. Psychiatry. 2003; 48: 506-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 2Volkmar F.R. Pauls D. Lancet. 2003; 362: 1133-1141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Epidemiologic studies estimate that up to 400,000 children are affected in the United States alone (3Fombonne E. J. Autism Dev. Disord. 2003; 33: 365-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). The primary features of ASD are severe difficulties in social interaction, communication deficits, and unusual behaviors, including repetitive and/or ritualistic actions. There is considerable variation in the severity of phenotypes in autism spectrum disorders, which include autism, Asperger syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder, Rett syndrome, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified. Despite the high prevalence and importance of autism spectrum disorders, very little is known about underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms (4Zoghbi H.Y. Science. 2003; 302: 826-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Timothy syndrome (TS) 3The abbreviations used are: TS, Timothy syndrome; WT, wild type; ANOVA, analysis of variance.3The abbreviations used are: TS, Timothy syndrome; WT, wild type; ANOVA, analysis of variance. is a complex physiological and developmental disorder, which includes autism spectrum disorders. We discovered that TS resulted from a recurrent, de novo CACNA1C calcium (Ca2+) channel mutation, G406R. Our findings that individuals with TS met the criteria for autism, or had severe deficits of language and social development, suggest that abnormal Ca2+ signaling may cause these disorders (5Splawski I.

Based on these results we hypothesized that mutations in other Ca2+ channel genes might be responsible for non-syndromic forms of ASD. Neuroanatomical studies of autistic patients have found histological abnormalities in the major regions of the limbic system including the hippocampus and amygdala and in the cerebellum and cerebral cortex (6Sadamatsu M. Kanai H. Xu X. Liu Y. Kato N. Congenit. Anom. (Kyoto). 2006; 46: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). CaV3.2, a T-type calcium channel encoded by the CACNA1H gene, is abundantly expressed in these and other regions. T-type Ca2+ channels activate with relatively small depolarization of the neuron membrane triggering low threshold spikes that contribute to rebound burst firing and oscillatory behavior in central neurons (7Perez-Reyes E. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 117-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). In the thalamus, this behavior maintains normal transitions in sensory gating, sleep, and arousal (8McCormick D.A. Bal T.

Here we identify missense mutations in the calcium channel gene CACNA1H (T-type CaV3.2) of six families affected by ASD. 461 individuals with ASD were screened for both mutations in the CACNA1H gene and the specific G406R mutation in the CACNA1C gene we had previously found associated with TS. Missense mutations were only found in the CACNA1H gene and were absent in 480 ethnically matched individuals unaffected by ASD. We show that heterologous expression of the mutated T-type channels functionally alters several biophysical properties of human CaV3.2 including current density and voltage-dependent gating properties. Within the complex circuitry of the neuronal system these mutated CaV3.2 channels may contribute to the development of the ASD phenotype. Subjects—Our samples included 461 unrelated probands from families with ASD from the publicly available data base supported by the National Institute of Mental Health, which consists of DNA materials and genotypic and phenotypic data. Each family was ascertained on the condition that at least two individuals were diagnosed with ASD (13Geschwind D.H. Sowinski J. Lord C. Iversen P. Shestack J. Jones P. Ducat L. Spence S.J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 69: 463-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Diagnostic tests included autism diagnostic interview-revised (14Lord C. Rutter M. Le Couteur A. J. Autism Dev. Disord. 1994; 24: 659-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (6724) Google Scholar) and the autism diagnostic observational schedule (15Lord C. Risi S. Lambrecht L. Cook Jr., E.H. Leventhal B.L. DiLavore P.C. Pickles A. Rutter M. J. Autism Dev. Disord. 2000; 30: 205-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (5523) Google Scholar). Our control group consisted of 480 ethnically matched individuals. Informed consent or assent was obtained from all individuals or their guardians according to standards established by local institutional review boards. Genotypic and DNA Sequence Analyses—Oligonucleotides (see supplemental Table 1) to all known exons of the CACNA1H gene were designed to genomic sequences found in the Celera data base using Oligo 6.6 (Molecular Biology Insights). PCR amplification of DNA samples and mutational analyses were carried out as described previously (16Splawski I. Tristani-Firouzi M. Lehmann M.H. Sanguinetti M.C. Keating M.T. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 338-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). PCR fragments were purified using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen), and sequencing was performed with an ABI 3700 automated DNA sequencer. Oligonucleotide sequences and PCR conditions are included in the supplemental information. Statistical Analysis—Fisher's exact test was used to determine the p value for the association of ASD and CACNA1H mutations. Northern Blot—Blot analyses were performed using human brain II and V Northern blots (Clontech). An ∼1060 base pair (AvrII/PshA1) fragment from the C-terminal end of CaV3.2 was used as a probe. The fragment was labeled with the Prime-It II labeling kit (Stratagene). Hybridization and washing conditions followed the manufacturer's suggestions. The blots were exposed to film for 3 days. Cell Culture and Transfection—Transformed human embryonic kidney-293 (HEK-293T) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 5% CO2 and 37 °C. Cells grown to 90% confluence in 35-mm Petri dishes were transiently transfected with plasmid DNAs encoding each Cav3.2 construct (4 μg) and green fluorescent protein (0.1 μg) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The WT human CaV3.2 cDNA (Genbank™ accession number AF051946) was a kind gift from E. Perez-Reyes (University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA). 24-36 h after transfection green fluorescent protein-positive cells expressed sufficient levels of the Ca2+ channels to proceed with electrophysiological recordings. Cells were split via trypsin EDTA and plated on glass coverslips at 5-10% confluence and given 2-3 h to settle and attach. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutations were introduced to the WT human CaV3.2 cDNA using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Oligonucleotide sequences are detailed in the supplemental materials. The presence of the desired mutations and absence of all other changes were verified by sequencing the entire CaV3.2 cDNA (Molecular Genetics Core, Children's Hospital, Boston and Harvard Medical School). To ensure against modifications that may have occurred in the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) during mutagenesis unique restriction sites were used to place fragments containing the CaV3.2 mutations into an identically digested WT construct that had not been subject to PCR. Electrophysiology—Electrophysiological experiments were performed using the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique. Recordings were obtained using an Axo-patch 200B amplifier, Digidata 1322A analog-to-digital converter, and pClamp 8.01 software (Molecular Devices, Union City, CA). Data were filtered at 2 kHz and digitized at 5 kHz. Modified Ringer's solution with low chloride contained (in mm): 140 sodium gluconate, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 20 HEPES, and 10 glucose (pH 7.4; 310 mosm). The internal pipette solution contained (in mm): 120 cesium methanesulfonate, 10 EGTA, 8 NaCl, 2 Mg-ATP, and 20 HEPES (pH 7.4; 290 mosm). Borosilicate glass pipettes (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) were pulled with a DMZ-Universal puller (Dagan Corp., Minneapolis, MN) to a typical pipette resistance of 3 mΩ after fire polishing. The pipettes were parafilm-wrapped prior to patching. Cell capacitance was measured for each cell and access resistance compensated to 80%. Data Acquisition and Analysis—The current-voltage protocol stepped the cell membrane potential from −100 mV to test potentials starting at −90 and increasing to +20 mV in 10-mV increments. Test potentials were 150 ms in duration, and the membrane potential was returned to −100 mV for 10 s between acquisitions to allow complete recovery from inactivation. Peak inward Ca2+ currents were plotted as a function of the test potential to generate current-voltage relations (I-V). The peak currents were also normalized by the individual cell capacitance measurement for the comparison of current densities. Individual I-V and mean current-density-V relations were fit with a modified form of the Boltzmann equation, where Ipeak = (V - Erev) G (1/1 + exp (Va,1/2 - V)/S)), and Erev is the reversal potential, Va,1/2 is the half-activation potential, G is the maximum slope conductance, and S is the slope factor that is inversely proportional to the effective gating charge. From single exponential fits of the activation and inactivation phases of the inward Ca2+ currents obtained during the I-V protocol the τ activation and inactivation were assessed. The τ deactivation was estimated from single exponential fits of currents obtained during the tail current protocol, where a short 2-ms prepulse to +45 mV was given to maximally open the voltage-gated channels before stepping the membrane potential of the cell back to test voltages between −160 and −40 mV. To assess the voltage dependence of inactivation, the cell membrane was stepped from a holding potential of −100 mV to conditioning potentials 1 s in duration between −125 and −35 mV in 10-mV increments before proceeding to a test potential of −35 mV for 150 ms, from which the resulting inward Ca2+ currents were analyzed. The voltage of half-inactivation (Vi,1/2) was estimated from Boltzmann fits of I/Imax versus voltage where I/Imax = 1/(1 + exp (z*(VT - Vi,1/2)/25.6)). During the subthreshold inactivation protocol the membrane of the cell was stepped to a conditioning voltage of −75 mV for 1 s from −110 mV followed by a test depolarization of −35 mV for 150 ms. Peak currents obtained following the conditioning depolarization were normalized to currents obtained in the absence of the conditioning step to determine the persistent current. Clamp-fit 9.0 was used to analyze all data obtained in Clampex (Molecular Devices). Fits of the I-V relations, activation, and inactivation curves were carried out in SigmaPlot (Jandel Scientific). Data are presented as the means ± S.E. Statistical tests included both Student's t test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). They were conducted in SigmaStat (Jandel Scientific), and p values are provided throughout. Due to the unequal number of samples between the assessed groups, the data fail to satisfy statistical tests for normality. Subsequently, the ANOVA analysis provides a much more conservative interpretation of statistical significance. Here, we report heterozygous mutations in CACNA1H, a Ca2+ channel gene expressed in brain (Fig. 1A) in samples from individuals with ASD. We screened all 35 exons of CACNA1H in 461 individuals with ASD. Four missense mutations were identified in conserved domains (Fig. 1, B-E). Analysis of exon 5 revealed a C634T transition in DNA samples in an affected individual from kindred 74-0190 (Fig. 1B). This led to the substitution of arginine by cysteine at residue 212 (R212C). Arg212 is completely conserved in multiple species, ranging from worms to humans and is located at the end of the fourth transmembrane segment of domain I (DI/S4, Fig. 2A). In exon 12, an affected individual from kindred 63-688 had a C2704T transition, which resulted in an arginine to tryptophan change (R902W). Arg902 resides in the fourth transmembrane segment of domain II (DII/S4, Fig. 2A) and is also completely conserved (Fig. 1C). A transversion of Gly2886 to Cys in exon 13 caused the substitution of a conserved tryptophan to cysteine (W962C) in an affected member of kindred 74-264 (Fig. 1D). Trp962 is located in the pore-forming loop of domain II (DII/P, Fig. 2A). Three unrelated individuals with autism from kindreds 63-331, 74-114, and 74-329 carried an identical C to T transition at nucleotide position 5621. This mutation replaced a highly conserved alanine with valine (A1874V, Fig. 1E) located 11 amino acid residues beyond the final transmembrane segment of domain IV (DIV/S6, Fig. 2A). In all three cases, the A1874V mutation was on the same allele as an arginine to glutamine polymorphism at 1871 (R1871Q). The allele frequency for the R1871Q polymorphism among autistic samples was 6.1%, while it was 5.7% among controls. Thus, the allele frequency was slightly higher among individuals with autism but the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.697). The carriers of the four mutations, R212C, R902W, W962C, and A1874V, were all Caucasian. The low incidence of these mutations within the affected population may indicate that the changes represent rare polymorphisms. However, the mutations were not found in 480 control ethnically matched individuals, and the Fisher's exact test predicted an association between the CACNA1H mutations and ASD (p = 0.014).FIGURE 2Mutations identified in individuals with ASD alter the activation properties of Cav3.2 channels.

For the illustrated cells, the peak current for WT was −767.8 pA (mean ± S.E. =-597.9 ± 101.2, n = 11), −304.5 pA for R212C (mean ± S.E. =-283.5 ± 51.2, n = 11), −109.7 pA for R902W (mean ± S.E. =-107.1 ± 10.7, n = 13), and −141.3 pA for W962C (mean ± S.E. =-114.8 ± 27.2, n = 8). R1871Q/A1874V (data not shown) did not differ significantly from WT (mean ± S.E. =-445.8 ± 108.8, n = 11). The horizontal scale bar equals 20 ms. The vertical scale bar equals 50 pA. C, current density-voltage relationships.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In three of the six families, an affected child who did not carry a CACNA1H mutation was present. Further inspection of the pedigrees also shows that one sibling and several parents, who were not obviously affected, carried the described mutations. Several factors can explain these apparent discrepancies. Penetrance of the mutations could be in issue. Mutations of other genes in the affected individuals, both carriers and noncarriers of the CACNA1H gene mutation, could be contributing to the phenotype. Formal phenotypic evaluation of the apparently normal parents and siblings was not completed in the National Institute of Mental Health study. Thus some of these individuals may be subclinically affected. It is also possible that the identified mutations are not major contributors to the ASD phenotype in these families but only modify the phenotypic expression. To determine the molecular consequences of the CACNA1H mutations on channel function, we heterologously expressed WT and mutant forms of the CaV3.2 channel in HEK 293T cells. The biophysical properties of the channels were characterized by standard whole-cell patch clamp techniques. Each of the voltage sensor mutants (R212C DI/S4, R902W DII/S4) and the pore mutant (W962C) formed channels that conducted substantially less current than WT channels (though ANOVA analysis determined the difference was not significant for R212C, see Table 1 Gmax values). Previous characterization of the CaV1.2 G406R mutation associated with TS revealed no differences in current density compared with WT (5Splawski I. Timothy K.W. Sharpe L.M. Decher N. Kumar P.

To assess functional expression, peak currents (Fig. 2B), current-density voltage relationships (Fig. 2C), and conductances (Table 1) were measured. To determine the effect of the mutations on channel activation, we assessed voltage sensitivity. With the exception of W962C, all of the ASD-associated mutations were less voltage sensitive (greater depolarizations were required to activate these channels; Fig. 2C). For the voltage sensor mutant R902W, the voltage at which 50% of channel population was activated (Va,1/2) was shifted by +11 mV (Table 1). Both R902W and R1871Q/A1874V activated slower than WT, with significant differences in τ activation noted at several voltages (Table 3, Fig. 4, A, B, and D). These data demonstrate that the ASD mutations reduce available Ca2+ current and thus should reduce neuronal excitability.TABLE 1Several mutations associated with ASD activate at significantly depolarized potentials and/or have a reduced conductance Individual I-V relations were fit with a modified Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation and the results averaged. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. In parentheses fits of the mean current density-voltage relations (Fig. 2C) with the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation are presented, where S is the slope and G is conductance.

Inactivation of CaV channels protects cells from unremitting Ca2+ entry during long depolarizations. For both the R902W voltage sensor mutant and the R1871Q/A1874V C-terminal mutation, the voltage at which 50% of the channel population was inactivated (Vi,1/2) shifted to more depolarized potentials (Fig. 3A). By ANOVA analysis, the shift was significantly different for the R902W mutant (Table 2). Holding WT channels at a subthreshold voltage of −75 mV inactivated 30% of the population from the closed state (n = 6; Fig. 3B, left panel). However, the shift in the inactivation threshold for R902W (+13 mV; Table 2) prevented substantial inactivation (11%, n = 6) and permitted a greater number of channels to open in response to subsequent depolarization (Fig. 3B, right panel; Student's t test, p = 0.00008). Thus, small perturbations from resting membrane potential are less likely to cumulatively inactivate this mutant channel. Since the rate (1/τ) of inactivation of the DI/S4 R212C mutant and the DII/S4 R902W mutant were also significantly slower than WT, these ASD mutant channels are expected to allow larger calcium influx once activated (Table 3, Fig. 4, A-C and E).TABLE 2Determination of the membrane potential where half of each channel population is found in the activated (Va,1/2) or inactivated (Vi,1/2) state Individual open probability relations were fit with the Boltzmann equation and the results averaged.

Unlike during inactivation, these deactivated channels can rapidly reopen. Both voltage sensor mutants deactivated faster than WT channels (Table 3). Despite the apparent increase in deactivation rates, the decrease in inactivation rates for R212C and R902W (Fig. 3, C and D) extend Ca2+ influx beyond that seen in WT channels. None of the mutant channels, including the pore mutant W962C, differed from WT in their rates of recovery from inactivation, permeation, or selectivity properties (Fig. 2C, Table 1). The R1871Q polymorphism had similar biophysical properties to the R1871Q/A1874V ASD-associated mutant for all parameters assessed (Tables 1, 2, 3, ANOVA). Our aim was to determine whether mutations in Ca2+ channel genes could contribute to the pathogenesis of non-syndromic ASD in some individuals. CACNA1H encodes the T-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channel CaV3.2, which regulates intracellular Ca2+ concentrations and neuronal firing (7Perez-Reyes E. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 117-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar, 18Chemin J. Monteil A. Briquaire C. Richard S. Perez-Reyes E. Nargeot J. Lory P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 478: 166-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). CACNA1H is expressed in many regions of the brain with highest expression in hippocampus, amygdala, and putamen (19Talley E.M. Cribbs L.L. Lee J.H. Daud A. Perez-Reyes E. Bayliss D.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1895-1911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), areas previously associated with ASD (20Brambilla P. Hardan A. di Nemi S.U. Perez J. Soares J.C. Barale F. Brain Res. Bull. 2003; 61: 557-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). We discovered substitutions in highly conserved residues of CaV3.2 in six of 461 individuals with ASD. These mutations altered the functional properties of the channel. Coupled with previous work implicating Ca2+ channel mutations in a syndromic form of autism (17Splawski I. Timothy K.W. Decher N. Kumar P. Sachse F.B. Beggs A.H. Sanguinetti M.C. Keating M.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 8086-8096Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), our data suggest that Ca2+ channel dysfunction should be considered as a potential factor in the development of ASD. The mutations associated with ASD are all in critical regions of the protein that would be expected to alter T-type calcium channel function. Expression of R212C, R902W, and the double mutant (R1871Q/A1874V) yielded smaller currents that were less sensitive to voltage-dependent activation. Lower current densities may indicate that these CACNA1H mutations prevent proper trafficking of the channels thereby reducing the number of functional channels on the membrane. Alternatively, the CaV3.2 mutations may reduce either the single channel conductance or the maximal open probability. It would not be unexpected for a mutation to alter the functionality or targeting of a protein due to folding errors and thus is a question to address in future experiments. Alterations in the mutant CaV3.2 channel sensitivity to voltage for activation can be interpreted using current models of voltage-dependent channel gating in which positively charged arginine residues in the S4 segments of the channel move in response to a change in the transmembrane voltage (21Hille B. Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes. Third Ed. Sinauer, Sunderland, MA2001Google Scholar). This movement transmits force directly to the S6 gating lever (22Long S.B. Campbell E.B. Mackinnon R. Science. 2005; 309: 903-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). Less charge in the mutant S4 domains (by replacement of arginines by uncharged tryptophan or cysteine) thus makes the channel less voltage-sensitive (larger voltage differences are required to make the same gating transition). The positioning of both S4 mutations close to the inner membrane surface may explain why the loss of charge was not noted in the slope factor values obtained in the I-V analysis. A striking shift in the potential of half inactivation was also noted for the R902W mutation and to a lesser extent in R1871Q/A1874V. The shift was significant enough to prevent significant cumulative inactivation of R902W, which likely occurs in WT CaV3.2 channels with fluctuations above the neuronal resting membrane potential. Thus, while the R902W and R1871Q/A1874V mutants may require greater voltage changes to open, and open at a slower rate, they are likely to conduct calcium longer until sufficient depolarization triggers inactivation. The pore mutation, W962C, did not affect voltage sensitivity, but currents mediated by this mutant channel protein were smaller. This suggests that W962C may be expressed in lower amounts in native neurons. Table 4 summarizes the altered biophysical characteristics of the mutated CaV3.2 channels and the proposed effects on neuronal calcium influx. It is speculative to predict the overall effect these changes might have on development and neuronal communication, yet the widespread expression pattern of CaV3.2 in the brain might explain the contribution these mutations may make to the multifaceted phenotype of ASD. With a future generation of knock-in mice carrying these ASD-associated CACNA1H mutations we may gain an understanding of the actual effects these channel alterations manifest in a neuronal environment. As an association between brain enlargement and autism has been made (6Sadamatsu M. Kanai H. Xu X. Liu Y. Kato N. Congenit. Anom. (Kyoto). 2006; 46: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), it may be that within the mouse nervous system our identified ASD mutants may increase cell proliferation or neurite outgrowth.TABLE 4Mutations associated with ASD are characterized by properties predicted to result in a reduction in neuronal firingCaV3.2 mutationElectrophysiological propertiesPredicted effect on Ca2+ levelsR212CDecreased current density↓ Ca2+ entry+ shift in Va,½↓ Ca2+ entrySlower rate of inactivation↑ Ca2+ entryFaster rate of deactivation↓ Ca2+ entryR902WDecreased current density↓ Ca2+ entry+ shift in Va,½↓ Ca2+ entry+ shift in VI,½↑ Ca2+ entrySlower rate of activation↓ Ca2+ entrySlower rate of inactivation↑ Ca2+ entryFaster rate of deactivation↓ Ca2+ entryW962CDecreased current density↓ Ca2+ entryR1871Q/A1874V+ shift in Va,½↓ Ca2+ entry+ shift in Vi,½↑ Ca2+ entrySlower rate of activation↓ Ca2+ entrySlower rate of inactivation↑ Ca2+ entry Open table in a new tab All of our functional analysis was conducted within the background of a single splice variant of the CaV3.2 channel. Recently, more than 12 alternative splicing sites were identified within the CACNA1H gene, several of which alter the kinetics and voltage-dependent gating characteristics of the channel (23Zhong X. Liu J.R. Kyle J.W. Hanck D.A. Agnew W.S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 1497-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). None of the ASD-associated variants described here occur in alternatively spliced exons. However, it would be useful to determine whether the phenotype of the identified CaV3.2 mutations is exacerbated or ameliorated within specifically spliced channels, as transcriptional control is likely to play a complex role in the development of the brain. Depending on the expression patterns and abundance of the alternatively spliced channels, localized changes effected by mutated CaV3.2 channels may vary greatly in different regions of the brain. It is possible that the identified CACNA1H mutations are not major contributors to the ASD phenotype but instead modify the phenotypic expression. Few of the affected individuals we tested harbored CACNA1H mutations, and three of the six families contained an affected child who did not carry a CACNA1H mutation. It is also likely that penetrance is incomplete as one sibling and several parents, who were not obviously affected, carried the described mutations. However, formal phenotypic evaluation was not completed or was not available in the apparently normal parents and siblings. It would not be surprising if the penetrance of a single genetic factor were incomplete, as studies have suggested that ASD is of polygenic inheritance (24Muhle R. Trentacoste S.V. Rapin I. Pediatrics. 2004; 113: e472-e486Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). It is also clear that other genetic and environmental factors contribute to ASD. Mutations in other regions of the CACNA1H gene have been identified in childhood absence epilepsy (10Khosravani H. Altier C. Simms B. Hamming K.S. Snutch T.P. Mezeyova J. McRory J.E. Zamponi G.W. J.

Little has been known, however, regarding the actual ATP and adenosine concentrations in the thin (∼7 μm) liquid layer lining native airway surfaces and the link between ATP release/metabolism and autocrine/paracrine regulation of epithelial function. In this study, chimeric Staphylococcus aureus protein A-luciferase (SPA-luc) was bound to endogenous antigens on primary human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cell surface and ATP concentrations assessed in real-time in the thin airway surface liquid (ASL). ATP concentrations on resting cells were 1-10 nm. Inhibition of ecto-nucleotidases resulted in ATP accumulation at a rate of ∼250 fmol/min/cm2, reflecting the basal ATP release rate. Following hypotonic challenge to promote cell swelling, cell-surface ATP concentration measured by SPA-luc transiently reached ∼1 μm independent of ASL volume, reflecting a transient 3-log increase in ATP release rates. In contrast, peak ATP concentrations measured in bulk ASL by soluble luciferase inversely correlated with volume. ATP release rates were intracellular calcium-independent, suggesting that non-exocytotic ATP release from ciliated cells, which dominate our cultures, mediated hypotonicity-induced nucleotide release. However, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) did not participate in this function. Following the acute swelling phase, HBE cells exhibited regulatory volume decrease which was impaired by apyrase and facilitated by ATP or UTP.

ATP regulates the airway epithelial mucociliary clearance activities that are critical for pulmonary host defense against bacteria which deposit on airway surfaces.

ADO activates Gs/adenylyl cyclase-coupled A2b receptor to promote cyclic AMP-dependent cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) activation and Cl− secretion (6Huang P. Lazarowski E.R. Tarran R. Milgram S.L. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14120-14125Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 7Cobb B.R. Ruiz F. King C.M.

Functional and biochemical evidence indicates that release and subsequent metabolism of ATP on the airway surface contribute to P2Y2 and A2b receptor-regulated electrolyte transport and airway surface liquid (ASL) volume homeostasis (8Lazarowski E.R.

These include the use of an atomic force microscopy probe coated with myosin fragments (21Schneider S.W. Egan M.E. Jena B.P. Guggino W.B. Oberleithner H. Geibel J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 32925-32932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and a chimeric luciferase with a leader sequence and a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor expressed at the plasma membrane of cells (25Pellegatti P. Falzoni S. Pinton P. Rizzuto R. Di Virgilio F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3659-3665Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The ATP sensitivity of most of these methods is from semiquantitative to the micromolar range, suitable for the studies of ATP release from secretory cells, whereas nanomolar range sensitivity might be necessary for studies of airway epithelial ATP release. Joseph et al. utilized a recombinant luciferase fused to the IgG-binding domain of Staphylococcus aureus protein A (SPA-luc) to position luciferase on the cell surface (19Joseph S.M. Buchakjian M.R. Dubyak G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23331-23342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). SPA-luc was attached to 1321N1 astrocytoma cells via antibodies against CD14 heterogeneously expressed in these cells and exhibited sensitivity for ATP in the 10-10,000 nm range. Stimulation of 1321N1 cells with thrombin resulted in enhanced release of ATP, which reached submicromolar levels as assessed by the cell-attached SPA-luc. In contrast, thrombin-induced changes in ATP concentrations in the bulk extracellular compartment as measured by soluble luciferase were negligible (19Joseph S.M. Buchakjian M.R. Dubyak G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23331-23342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the physiological regulation of ATP concentrations in the micro-environment at the airway luminal surface. A well differentiated (WD) primary human bronchial epithelial (HBE) culture system was utilized as a model for native human airway epithelia. SPA-luc (19Joseph S.M. Buchakjian M.R. Dubyak G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23331-23342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) was re-engineered and purified to exhibit 100-fold increase in luciferase activity. Real-time measurements of ATP concentration in the thin film of ASL on HBE cells were performed with cell-attached SPA-luc under resting and luminal hypotonic challenge conditions. Results from this technique were compared with those obtained with real-time measurements by luciferase dissolved in ASL and with pipette-sampling and off-line luminometry approaches (8Lazarowski E.R.

The physiological role for released ATP in airway epithelial volume regulation in response to hypotonic challenge was also investigated. Cell Culture—WD primary HBE cultures were established from surgical specimens of main stem or lobar bronchi from healthy or cystic fibrosis (CF) donors on 12 or 6.5 mm diameter Transwell supports (Corning) as described (26Fulcher M.L. Gabriel S. Burns K.A. Yankaskas J.R. Randell S.H. Methods Mol. Med. 2005; 107: 183-206PubMed Google Scholar). Cultures typically became fully differentiated in 20-30 days. Purification of SPA-luc—pMALU5, a cDNA construct encoding SPA-luc, was kindly provided by Dr. George Dubyak (Case Western Reserve University). The SPA-luc sequence was amplified from pMALU5 by PCR with up and down primers harboring at their 5′ ends BamHI and KpnI restriction sites, respectively. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and KpnI and ligated into similarly digested pT7-HTb, thus introducing a His6 tag and tobacco etch virus cleavage site at the N terminus of SPA-luc. pT7-HTb/SPA-luc was transformed into Escherichia coli (BL21-*; Invitrogen) and SPA-luc was expressed by overnight induction with 0.2 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 20 °C. The cells were lysed by an Emulsiflex homogenizer (Avestin, Ontario, Canada). Soluble proteins were precipitated with 55% ammonium sulfate, resuspended, and purified by two passages over a Ni2+-chelating column (GE Healthcare). The His6 tag was cleaved from the fusion protein using His6-tobacco etch virus protease (3 h at 30 °C), and the digestion mixture was run over a Ni2+-chelating column a third time and SPA-luc eluted in the flow-through. The protein concentration and luciferase activity of fractions obtained through the purification process were assayed using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) and the LB953 AutoLumat luminometer (15Okada S.F. O'Neal W.K. Huang P. Nicholas R.A. Ostrowski L.E. Craigen W.J. Lazarowski E.R. Boucher R.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 124: 513-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), respectively. SPA Binding Antigens—SPA-luc binding to endogenous antigens on the apical surface of isolated WD HBE cells was investigated with a Leica SP2 AOBS confocal microscope as described previously (27Kreda S.M. Mall M. Mengos A. Rochelle L. Yankaskas J. Riordan J.R. Boucher R.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2154-2167Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Immunostaining was performed on fixed, non-permeabilized cultures with primary antibodies against keratan sulfate (KS) or MUC1 followed by fluorescein isothiocyatate-labeled secondary antibodies, or with fluorescein isothiocyatate-labeled wheat germ agglutinin (WGA). Cell ELISA—The concentrations of the selected antibodies/lectins required to achieve maximal SPA binding to WD HBE culture surfaces were optimized by quantitating cell-surface-bound protein A-horseradish peroxidase conjugates (SPA-HRP) by a cell ELISA. The apical surface of WD HBE cultures was first incubated with 50 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 30 min. The solution was replaced with 50 μl of PBS/BSA containing various concentrations of an anti-MUC1 antibody (mouse IgG2b, ab8323, Abcam, Cambridge, MA), an anti-KS antibody (mouse IgG2b, Chemicon, Temecula, CA), or biotinylated WGA (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). In the latter instance, an additional incubation (1 h) with 2 μg/ml anti-biotin antibody (rabbit, Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX) in 50 μl of PBS/BSA was performed. The apical surface of the cultures was washed three times with PBS (10 min/wash) and incubated with 1 μg/ml SPA-HRP (Pierce) in 50 μl of PBS for 1 h. The basolateral surfaces of cultures were bathed in 1 ml of Hank's balanced salt solution buffered with 10 mm HEPES (HBSS/HEPES). All incubation procedures were performed at 4 °C. After three apical washes with PBS (10 min each), an ELISA with o-phenylenediamine was performed according to the manufacturer's instruction (Pierce) and the intensity of the colorimetric reaction assessed at 490 nm by a microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) with SOFTmax Pro software. ATP Sensitivity of Cell-attached SPA-luc—Attachment of SPA-luc was carried out using the optimal antibody/lectin concentrations determined as above. Briefly, after blocking with PBS/BSA for 30 min, the apical surface of WD HBE cultures (on 12-mm Transwells) was incubated with 20 μg/ml anti-MUC1 antibody, 10 μg/ml anti-KS antibody, or 4 μg/ml biotinylated WGA followed by 2 μg/ml anti-biotin antibody for 1 h at 4°C. After three washes with PBS, the apical HBE surface was incubated with 0.5 mg/ml purified SPA-luc for 1 h at 4°C, washed with PBS, and the mucosal surface replenished with a specified volume of HBSS/HEPES. SPA-luc-attached cultures were equilibrated at room temperature for 30 min to re-establish basal ATP concentrations. Cultures were subsequently transferred to a 35 mm polyacetal assay chamber, which contained 1 ml of HBSS/HEPES in a basolateral reservoir, and placed gently in a Turner TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Biosystems, Sunnyvale, CA). Luciferin (150 μm) was added to the ASL and arbitrary light units (ALU) integrated for 10 s and recorded. Known concentrations of ATP were added in a stepwise manner (e.g. 1 nm added twice, 10 nm added twice, then 100 nm added twice). The ATP sensitivity of SPA-luc dissolved in bulk solution (100 μl of HBSS/HEPES) was obtained in parallel, using a Transwell without cells. ATP Concentration and Release Rates on Resting HBE Cells— For real-time ATP measurements, HBE cells, with either cell-attached SPA-luc or soluble luciferase (Sigma L9506; 0.5-2.0 μg/culture), were placed in the Turner TD-20/20 luminometer and luciferin (150 μm) added to the mucosal liquid. Luminescence was measured every minute until the ALU values (i.e. basal ATP concentration) reached steady state (i.e. less than ± 10% variability over 10 min). At the end of each assay, an ATP-luminescence relationship was obtained as above. For off-line ATP measurements, the ASL on resting WD HBE cultures was sampled by gently pipetting (from volume >100 μl) or micro-sampling (from volume ≤100 μl) and ATP concentrations measured as described previously (8Lazarowski E.R.

ATP release rates from resting cells were determined by monitoring ATP accumulation in real-time under conditions resulting in maximal inhibition of cell-surface nucleotidase activities. The nucleotidase inhibitor mixture contained 300 μm β,γ-methylene-ATP, 30 μm ebselen, and 10 mm levamisole, to inhibit ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterases (eNPPs) (28Joseph S.M.

After recording the basal ATP concentration as described above, the inhibitor mixture was added to the mucosal liquid and ATP concentrations measured every minute. The efficacy of the nucleotidase inhibitors was tested on separate HBE cultures in the presence of 500 nm ATP as described previously (10Lazarowski E.R. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31061-31068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Hypotonic Challenge—After recording basal ATP concentrations in real-time, H2O (half the initial volume, containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2) was added gently to the ASL. Luminescence was subsequently recorded for 5 min: every 0.2 s for the first minute, then every 10 s for the next 4 min. For an isosmotic control, the same volume of mannitol solution (300 mm, containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2) was added as above. At the end of each assay, an ATP-luminescence relationship was obtained as above. Changes in luciferin/luciferase activity generated by addition of hypotonic or isosmotic solutions were tested on wells without cells containing ATP standards and confirmed to be <10%. ATP concentrations were alternatively measured by off-line luminometry of sampled ASL as described previously (15Okada S.F. O'Neal W.K. Huang P. Nicholas R.A. Ostrowski L.E. Craigen W.J. Lazarowski E.R. Boucher R.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 124: 513-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The initial rate of ATP release following hypotonic challenge was assessed in the presence of the nucleotidase inhibitor mixture in 50 μl of mucosal liquid with soluble luciferase. Cell Volume Regulation—Changes in cell height were used as a parameter to estimate cell volume changes following a hypotonic challenge, as described previously (15Okada S.F. O'Neal W.K. Huang P. Nicholas R.A. Ostrowski L.E. Craigen W.J. Lazarowski E.R. Boucher R.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 124: 513-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In brief, WD HBE cells were loaded with 5 μm calcein-AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oregon) for 30 min at 37 °C. The apical surface of cultures was equilibrated for 10 min with 33 μl of HBSS/HEPES before study. The cultures were then positioned on a Zeiss 510 confocal microscope. H2O (17 μl) was added to apical surface to generate a 200 mosm solution, and xz-scanning images were obtained every second for initial 15 s, then every 5 s for next 75 s. Experiments were also performed on cultures pretreated with apyrase (ATP diphosphohydrolase, 10 units/ml) for 5 min, 8-(p-sulfophenyl)theophylline (8-SPT, an ADO receptor antagonist, 100 μm) for 30 min or ATP, UTP, or ATPγS (100 μm) on the luminal surface. Ca2+i Dependence of Hypotonicity-induced ATP Release— BAPTA-AM loading (100 μm for 30 min at 37 °C) of WD HBE cells and Ca2+i mobilization studies with Fura-2-AM were performed as described previously (32Ribeiro C.M. Paradiso A.M. Carew M.A. Shears S.B. Boucher R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10202-10209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). ATP release from BAPTA- and vehicle-loaded cultures was measured with soluble luciferase in 50 μl of mucosal liquid. Statistical Analysis—All experiments were performed on cultures established from at least three donors. Data were expressed as mean values ± S.E. of observations. Where appropriate, data were analyzed by Student's t test or analysis of variance with GraphPad Prism software. Unpaired t tests or analysis of variance were used to obtain the p value for differences between means; a repeated-measures analysis of variance was used when comparing series of ATP values at each time point among different conditions. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. Optimization of SPA-luc Attachment to HBE Cell Surfaces— Partially purified His6-SPA-luc exhibited a specific activity of 1.6 × 105 ALU/μg when assessed in the presence of 1 μm ATP. This specific activity was 100-fold higher than that initially detected in E. coli homogenate and represented 67% of the initial activity in the crude supernatant starting material (Fig. 1 and Table 1). Indeed, the specific activity of purified SPA-luc was similar to that of commercially available luciferase (Sigma catalog number L9506, 1.3 × 105 ALU/μg).TABLE 1Purification of SPA-luc Soluble proteins from SPA-luc transfected E.coli lysates (“Crude sup”) were precipitated with 55% ammonium sulfate (“AmSO4 55% pellet”), resuspended, and purified by three passages over a Ni2+-chelating column. 1-4 correspond to lanes 1-4 in Fig. 1.1: crude sup2: AmSO455% pellet3: 1st column fractions 13–314: 3rd column flow-throughVolume, ml200404.53.9Protein concentration, mg/ml2060197.1Activity, ALU·μl−13.18 × 1043.56 × 1041.06 × 1061.09 × 106Specific activity, ALU·μg−11.59 × 1035.93 × 1025.58 × 1041.60 × 105Relative total activity, % recovery10022.475.066.7 Open table in a new tab Anti-KS and anti-MUC1 antibodies, as well as WGA, bound avidly to the apical surface of WD HBE cultures as revealed by confocal microscopy (Figs. 2, A-C) suggesting that these reagents would bind SPA-luc to endogenous HBE cell-surface antigens. Subsequently, the concentration of the antibody or lectin required for attachment of maximal amounts of SPA to HBE cell surfaces was determined by a cell ELISA as 10, 20, and 4 μg/ml for anti-KS antibody, anti-MUC1 antibody, and biotinylated WGA, respectively (Fig. 2D). Next, we examined the luminescence generated by cell-attached SPA-luc in response to exogenously added ATP. Luminescence was linear in the range of 10-10,000 nm exogenous ATP and was similar for the three different methods of anchoring SPA-luc to the cell surface (Fig. 3A). Nonspecific binding of SPA-luc occurred but generated ∼20-fold less luminescence than SPA-luc attachment via antibodies or lectin (Fig. 3A). Notably, the ATP-luminescence curves were flatter in the 0-10 nm range, which likely reflected the contribution of endogenous ATP release by HBE cells (compare the curves with those made in wells without cells (Fig. 3B)). The ATP sensitivity of SPA-luc complexed to HBE cells was compared with that of known concentrations of SPA-luc in solution. The ATP-luminescence relationship of SPA-luc bound to the cells (Fig. 3A) aligned best with that of 10 μg/ml SPA-luc dissolved in 100 μl of buffer (Fig. 3B). Thus, bound SPA-luc was equivalent to ∼1 μg/culture or ∼0.88 μg/cm2 of culture surface. Basal ATP Concentrations—To accurately assess basal ATP concentrations on HBE cell surfaces, we investigated the effect of ASL volume on ATP concentrations on resting cells utilizing a spectrum of techniques. The ATP concentrations in varied ASL volumes on resting WD HBE cultures were accordingly measured by: 1) pipette- or micro-sampling and off-line luminometry, 2) real-time luminometry with soluble luciferase (Sigma), and 3) real-time luminometry with cell-attached SPA-luc. Basal ATP concentrations were similar (1-10 nm) over a range of ASL volumes as measured by the three techniques (Fig. 4). However, micro-sampling generated more variability than real-time luminometry, likely reflecting shear stress artifacts induced by the aspiration of liquid. Basal ATP Release Rates—ATP concentrations on resting HBE cells reflect the balance between basal ATP release and hydrolysis (10Lazarowski E.R. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31061-31068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). For example, ATP (500 nm) added to 300 μl of ASL on HBE cells exhibited a half-life of ∼0.5 min, illustrating the activity of ecto-nucleotidases on HBE cell surfaces (Fig. 5A). Addition of the nucleotidase inhibitors, β,γ-methylene-ATP, ebselen, or levamisole, each of which blocks a different ecto-nucleotidase enzyme family expressed on WD HBE surface, partially inhibited ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 5A). When combined together, the three inhibitors exhibited an additive effect, producing a >50-fold reduction in the rate of ATP hydrolysis. Therefore, the combination of the three enzyme inhibitors was utilized to assess ATP release rates from resting cells. Under conditions where nucleotidases were maximally inhibited, endogenous ATP accumulation was measured by cell-attached SPA-luc and by luciferase dissolved in the mucosal liquid. Addition of the inhibitor mixture to the ASL resulted in ATP accumulation (Fig. 5B). Changes in ATP concentrations were negligible when the inhibitor mixture was add"
https://openalex.org/W2029882629,"It is generally accepted from the darwinian theory of evolution that a progressive increase in population adaptation will occur in populations containing genetic variation in fitness, until a stable equilibrium is reached and/or the additive genetic variation is exhausted. However, the theoretical literature of population genetics documents exceptions where mean population fitness may decrease in response to evolutionary changes in gene frequency, due to varying selective coefficients, sexual selection or to epistatic interactions between loci. Until now, no examples of such exceptions have been documented from fitness estimates in either natural or experimental populations. We present here direct evidence that, as a result of epistatic interactions between adaptive mutations, mean population fitness can decrease in asexual evolving populations of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae."
https://openalex.org/W2003428416,"Redox sensitivity of actin toward an exogenous oxidative stress has recently been reported. We report here the first evidence of in vivo actin redox regulation by a physiological source of reactive oxygen species, specifically those species generated by integrin receptors during cell adhesion. Actin oxidation takes place via the formation of a mixed disulfide between cysteine 374 and glutathione; this modification is essential for spreading and for cytoskeleton organization. Impairment of actin glutathionylation, either through GSH depletion or expression of the C374A redox-insensitive mutant, greatly affects cell spreading and the formation of stress fibers, leading to inhibition of the disassembly of the actinomyosin complex.

These data suggest that actin glutathionylation is essential for cell spreading and cytoskeleton organization and that it plays a key role in disassembly of actinomyosin complex during cell adhesion. Actin is the main component of the cytoskeleton and exists as monomeric G-actin, able upon extracellular stimuli to polymerize into filamentous F-actin. Different structures of F-actin are produced by elongation of preformed filaments by accessory proteins, such as profilin, actin-related protein 2/3, actin-depolymerizing factor/cofilin complexes, and many others. These actin-interacting proteins may act through different mechanisms, as forming transversal branching filaments or blocking the extensive elongation at the cell margins (1Winder S.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 14-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 2Mullins R.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Actin cytoskeleton is modified by integrin signal in response to extracellular matrix (ECM) 3The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; BIAM, N-(biotinoyl)-N′-(iodoaceyl)ethylenediamine; BSO, buthionine sulfoximine; LOX, lypoxygenase; FN, fibronectin; PL, polilysine; nmMHC, non-muscle myosin heavy chain; NDGA, nordihydroguaretic acid; PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatases; ROS, reactive oxygen species; RIPA, radioimmune precipitation assay; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; wt, wild-type; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. transforming actin architecture from a cortical ring to a plain structure of stress fibers in complete adherent cells. Integrin-mediated cell adhesion proceeds in a step-like program: cells contact the substratum, integrins ligate to the ECM proteins and clusterize, focal contacts form, the cell spreads and finally organizes the actin filaments in stress fibers for mechanical resistance. The control of cytoskeleton organization is mainly due by the action of the members of the family of the small GTPases Rho like Cdc42, Rho, and Rac. In response to growth or chemotactic factors and cell-cell or cell-matrix interaction, Rho is activated thus inducing the formation of actin stress fibers. In contrast, activated Rac provokes actin-dependent membrane ruffling and Cdc42 causes protrusion of actin-rich microspikes from the cell surface (1Winder S.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 14-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Much evidence supports the idea that reactive oxygen species (ROS) act as second messengers thus modulating the activity of signaling proteins upon growth factors and cytokines stimulation. The downstream effect of ROS production is the reversible oxidation of redox-sensible proteins through a direct modification of the thiol group of reactive cysteines (3Finkel T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 52-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Redox-regulated proteins include tyrosine phosphatases, several transcription factors, p53, and the p21Ras family of proto-oncogenes (4Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 509-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Recently, Chiarugi et al. (5Chiarugi P. Pani G. Giannoni E. Taddei L. Colavitti R. Raugei G. Symons M. Borrello S. Galeotti T. Ramponi G. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 933-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) proposed a redox regulation of integrin signaling during cell adhesion. In this new model, integrin activation is joined to generation of ROS specifically acting on cytoplasmic target proteins as low molecular weight-phosphotyrosine phosphatase (5Chiarugi P. Pani G. Giannoni E. Taddei L. Colavitti R. Raugei G. Symons M. Borrello S. Galeotti T. Ramponi G. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 933-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) and the tyrosine kinase Src (6Giannoni E. Buricchi F. Raugei G. Ramponi G. Chiarugi P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6391-6403Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The reversibile oxidation of both these proteins has profound effect on cell spreading onto ECM, through indirect activation of both Focal Adhesion Kinase and the small GTPase Rho (5Chiarugi P. Pani G. Giannoni E. Taddei L. Colavitti R. Raugei G. Symons M. Borrello S. Galeotti T. Ramponi G. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 933-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 7Nimnual A.S. Taylor L.J. Bar-Sagi D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 236-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), thus suggesting that ROS act as second messengers in the organization of cytoskeleton in response to integrin engagement. Herein, we report evidence that ROS produced by integrins upon ECM contact are essential mediators for actin fibers formation during cell spreading. In particular, ROS acts on mixed disulfide with glutathione which is a key step for actin stress fibers. Assay of Intracellular H2O2—Three minutes before assaying 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (Molecular Probes) was added to a final concentration of 5 μm. Cells were lysed in 1 ml of RIPA buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and analyzed immediately by fluorescence spectrofotometric analysis using a Perkin Elmer Fluorescence Sprectrofotometer 650-10S equipped with a xenon power supply (excitation wavelength: 488 nm, emission wavelength: 510 nm). Cell Culture and Transfection—Murine fibroblasts NIH-3T3 (from American Type Culture Collection) were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. For transfection experiments, confluent cells were transfected with 4 μg of plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instruction. The pSG5-FLAG-β-actin and pSG5-FLAG-β-actin C374A was a generous gift of Prof. C. Stournaras. Cell Adhesion Assay—Cells were serum-starved for 24 h and then detached with 0.25% trypsin for 1 min. Trypsin digestion was then blocked by the use of 0.5 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma). Cells were centrifuged, diluted in fresh culture medium, incubated for 30 min in gentle agitation at 37 °C, and finally seeded for 45 min on polylysine (PL)-treated or fibronectin (FN)-treated dishes for the period indicated. For N-(biotinoyl)-N′-(iodoaceyl)ethylenediamine (BIAM) (Molecular Probes) labeling of proteins, cells were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton, 2 mm EGTA) supplemented with BIAM (100 μm final concentration) and protease inhibitors mixture (Sigma). Lysates were then maintained on ice for 15 min and then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min. For the binding of BIAM-labeled proteins with immobilized avidin (Pierce), 30 μl of resin were added to the clarified samples and maintained overnight at 4 °C in gentle agitation. The resin was first washed four times with RIPA buffer and then resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer. The pattern of BIAM-labeled proteins were visualized by a Western blot using horseradish peroxidase-avidin conjugate (Bio-Rad), washed, and developed with the enhanced chemiluminescence kit. Immunoprecipitation—PL- or FN-plated cells were lysed for 20 min on ice in 500 μl with RIPA lysis buffer. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation and immunoprecipitation was performed for 4 h at 4°C with 1-2 μg of the specific antibodies. Immunocomplexes were collected on protein A-Sepharose, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Immunoblots were incubated in 2% milk and 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS buffer for 1 h at room temperature, probed first with specific antibodies and then with secondary antibodies. Quantity-One software (Bio-Rad) was used to perform quantitative analysis. MALDI-TOF Analysis—BIAM-labeled lysates were run on SDS-PAGE. The gel was then stained by Coomassie Blue solution, subjected to destain solution for 24 h and finally washed in water until completely equilibrated. The bands of interest were excised, transferred to an Eppendorf tube, and then washed twice with 50 mm NH4HCO3/acetonitrile (1:1) and shrunk with acetonitrile. After drying, samples were subjected to a reduction reaction in a buffer containing 10 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mm NH4HCO3 for 45 min at 56 °C followed by an alkylation step in a buffer containing 55 mm Iodoacetic acid, 25 mm NH4HCO3 for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. After a final washing step, samples were dried up and trypsin digested for 24 h at 37 °C. The peptides were then extracted from gel bands by sonification and by supplementing 50% acetonitrile and 1% trifluoroacetic acid (1:1 proportion with sample), and the supernatants were recovered and then dried. Spectrometric analysis was conducted on an Ultraflex MALDI-TOF (Bruker Daltonics) using a Scout ion source and operating in a positive reflectron mode. Samples were mixed with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (1:1). An 0.8 picomol/μl sample was deposed with the dry droplet technique on an AnchorChip target. Peptides were identified within an error of 120 parts/million. Confocal Microscopy—Presuspended NIH-3T3 were seeded onto coverslips, washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at 4 °C. Fixed cells were permeabilized with three washes with TBST (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100) and then blocked with 5.5% horse serum in TBST for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then incubated with specific primary antibodies or fluorescent phalloidin, diluted 1:100 in TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) overnight at 4 °C. When necessary, cells were incubated with secondary antibodies (diluted 1:100) for 1 h at room temperature in TBST with 3% bovine serum albumin. After extensive washes in TBST cells were mounted with glycerol plastine and observed under a laser scanning confocal microscope (Bio-Rad MRC 1024 Es) equipped with a krypton/argon laser source for fluorescence imaging and with differential interference contrast optics. The argon (488 nm) and krypton (568 nm) laser lines were used to simultaneously excite the cells, and the emitted fluorescence signals were collected with a Nikon Plan Apo 60×/1.4 oil immersion objective. A series of optical sections (512 × 512 pixels) were taken through the depth of the cells with a thickness of 1 μm at intervals of 0.2 μm. Wound Healing Migration Assay—Confluent NIH-3T3 cells were serum-starved for 24 h, and dishes were scored with a sterile 200-μl micropipette tip and photographed. Thereafter cells were treated with 30 ng/ml platelet-derived growth factor. After 8 h transfected cells were visualized by a colorimetric reaction using the Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Then the wounds were photographed again to visualize incoming cells. Actin Is Oxidized by ROS Produced by Integrin Receptors during Cell Adhesion—Besides our identification of low molecular weight-phosphotyrosine phosphatase and the tyrosine kinase c-Src as two target proteins of the integrin-induced ROS (5Chiarugi P. Pani G. Giannoni E. Taddei L. Colavitti R. Raugei G. Symons M. Borrello S. Galeotti T. Ramponi G. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 933-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 6Giannoni E. Buricchi F. Raugei G. Ramponi G. Chiarugi P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6391-6403Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), we now have continued with a further screening for redox-sensitive proteins during integrin receptor signaling, using BIAM, which is a sulfhydryl-modifying reagent that selectively probes the thiolate form of reactive cysteine residues (8Kim J.R. Yoon H.W. Kwon K.S. Lee S.R. Rhee S.G. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 283: 214-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). ECM adhesion of NIH-3T3 murine fibroblasts was assayed 45 min after seeding onto coated dishes, in accordance with the peak of ROS during ECM-induced cell spreading (5Chiarugi P. Pani G. Giannoni E. Taddei L. Colavitti R. Raugei G. Symons M. Borrello S. Galeotti T. Ramponi G. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 933-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Western blot analysis of affinity-purified BIAM-labeled lysates of PL- and FN-adhering cells shows an integrin-dependent redox sensitivity of a protein of about 47 kDa, which was identified by MALDI-TOF analysis as β-actin (Fig. 1, B and C). This identification was confirmed by anti-β-actin immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1D). Parallel to previous findings indicating actin as a redox-sensitive protein during induced oxidative stress (9Laragione T. Bonetto V. Casoni F. Massignan T. Bianchi G. Gianazza E. Ghezzi P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14737-14741Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), we aimed to investigate the function of integrin-elicited ROS on the organization of the overall actin cytoskeleton. Previous studied indicated that, following engagement of integrin receptors, the small GTPase Rac-1 plays a key role in ROS production though the activation of 5-lypoxigenase (LOX) (5Chiarugi P. Pani G. Giannoni E. Taddei L. Colavitti R. Raugei G. Symons M. Borrello S. Galeotti T. Ramponi G. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 933-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). We now find that the depletion of oxidants using specific inhibitor for LOX, nordihydroguaretic acid (NDGA), greatly affects actin organization during cell spreading (Fig. 2A). FN-spreading cells treated with this inhibitor display a morphology very similar to PL-adhering cells, with a disorganized peripheric actin ring and a rounded shape. Administration of this antioxidant when the spreading is completed does not affect the overall actin cytoskeletal architecture (Fig. 2B), suggesting that ROS play a role in actin organization only during the dynamic process of cell spreading in response to binding to ECM proteins. Cells Spreading and Cytoskeleton Rearrangements Require Actin Glutathionylation—Mild oxidation can result in the formation of mixed disulfides between protein sulfydryl groups and glutathione (GSH), giving rise to S-glutathionylated proteins. Furthermore, actin has already been indicated as a glutathionylated protein during epidermal growth factor stimulation (10Wang J. Boja E.S. Tan W. Tekle E. Fales H.M. English S. Mieyal J.J. Chock P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47763-47766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). With the goal to analyze whether during integrin-mediated cell adhesion actin undergoes glutathionylation upon oxidation, we investigated its binding to GSH during a time course experiment. Anti-GSH immunoblot analysis of actin revealed that there is a transient increase in actin glutathionylation upon engagement of integrin receptors (Fig. 3A). Moreover, we find that GSH is greatly implicated in actin regulation during cytoskeleton rearrangement due to cell spreading. Actually, depletion of GSH causes a dramatic impairment of actin cytoskeleton organization leading to a rounded cell shape, similar to the effect observed in adhering cells treated with NDGA. In addition, the effect of buthionine sulfoximide (BSO) on actin cytoskeletal organization and cell shape can be relieved by re-administration of GSH (Fig. 3, B and C), thus indicating the reversibility of the inhibition of actin organization upon GSH depletion. Although we cannot exclude that BSO affects the glutathionylation of other cytoskeletal proteins, we speculate an effect on β-actin glutathionylation. We thereafter checked the level of actin glutathionylation in the above conditions (Fig. 3D). Actually, gluthathionyated actin correlates with a normal cell shape (untreated and BSO+GSH-treated cells), while complete loss of actin glutathionylation is linked to an unusual cell shape (BSO-treated cells). Involvement of Cysteine 374 of Actin in Cytoskeleton Organization during Cell Spreading—ROS modify protein function by the specific alteration of the redox state of reactive cysteine residues (3Finkel T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 52-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Although actin contains six highly conserved cysteine residues, the three-dimensional structure reveals that only the thiol of cysteine in position 374 is exposed on the surface of the molecule. The in vitro study of Wang et al. (10Wang J. Boja E.S. Tan W. Tekle E. Fales H.M. English S. Mieyal J.J. Chock P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47763-47766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) indicated that cysteine 374 is a glutathionylated residue that undergoes deglutathionylation upon epidermal growth factor stimulation. We therefore looked at the role of cysteine 374 in GSH disulfide formation during cell adhesion, using FLAG-tagged wild type (wt) and the cysteine 374 to alanine (C374A) mutant of β-actin. We observed that the C374A mutant glutathionylation is greatly impeded upon integrin engagement (Fig. 4A), thus confirming C374A as the main GSH-reactive sulfydryl in actin. To analyze the role of actin redox regulation during cell spreading, a double labeling analysis of FN-adhering cells was carried out to reveal whole actin organization (red) and recombinant FLAG-tagged actin (green) (Fig. 4B). The results demonstrate that wild-type β-actin overexpression does not affect cell spreading or F-actin organization, whereas C374A β-actin expression leads to a severe inability to organize the cytoskeleton and to spread in response to ECM ligands (Fig. 4B). Remarkably, cells expressing the redox-insensitive mutant have a rounded shape and a morphology very similar to antioxidant-treated ones (Fig. 2). These findings suggest that in vivo C374 probably plays a key role in GSH disulfide formation upon integrin engagement and in cell spreading. On the other side, we were interested in studying whether cysteine 374 oxidation is involved in other phenomena requiring actin cytoskeleton reorganization. Platelet-derived growth factor-induced cell migration was analyzed by a wound healing assay in NIH-3T3 cells expressing wild-type or C374A β-actin. We found that wild-type and C374A expressing cells have a similar motility after platelet-derived growth factor administration suggesting that cysteine 374 does not affect cell migration (Fig. 4C). Redox Regulation of Actin Is Essential for Actinomyosin Complex Disassembly—Cytoskeleton contractility of both muscle and non-muscle cells is guaranteed by the actinomyosin complex which, in response to extracellular signals, can be rapidly assembled or disassembled to allow cell shape changes (11Small J.V. Resch G.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 517-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). We therefore analyzed the redox sensitivity of the association between actin and non-muscle myosin heavy chain (nmMHC) in cell spreading due to ECM contact. Fig. 5A shows that successful and completed cell adhesion is associated with the disassembly of the actinomyosin complex, as indicated by the disappearance of the association between myosin and actin upon FN contact. GSH depletion and ROS removal both impede the dissociation between actin and nmMHC, confirming a role for integrin-induced ROS production and GSH content in the dynamics of actinomyosin complex. Moreover, this association is greatly enhanced in C374A-expressing cells, suggesting that glutathionylation of cysteine 374 is involved in the disassembly of the actinomyosin complex upon completion of cell spreading. The ROS-dependent association between actin and nmMHC is further confirmed by confocal analysis performed on endogenous actin (Fig. 5B). Hence, whatever the methods used for impeding or limiting actin glutathionylation (PL seeding, antioxidant treatment, GSH depletion, or mutation of actin glutathionylation site) the effect on actinomyosin complex is the inhibition of its disassembly. We report here that: (i) during integrin-mediated cell adhesion actin is a redox-sensitive protein and undergoes a direct redox regulation by a physiological source of ROS; (ii) inhibition of 5-LOX-driven oxidants completely impedes actin fiber formation during cell adhesion leading to a ring-like actin cytoskeleton; (iii) actin undergoes glutathionylation on Cys374 during cell adhesion and the impairment of this redox modification leads to the inability of cells to spread and to organize the cytoskeleton in response to ECM; (iv) impairment of actin glutathionylation leads to inhibition of the disassembly of the actinomyosin complex, suggesting that this redox modification is a key step in the dynamic contraction of cytoskeleton during cell spreading. The recent literature opened an intriguing scenario in which signal transduction by oxygen species, through reversible regulation of PTPs, cytosolic protein-tyrosine kinases and receptor protein-tyrosine kinases, and cytoskeletal proteins, represents a widespread and conserved component of the biochemical machinery triggered by several extracellular stimuli to transmit their signals (3Finkel T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 52-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 4Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 509-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Integrin-mediated adhesion causes the transient inactivation of low molecular weight-PTP and SH2-protein-tyrosine phosphatase 2. 4M. L. Taddei, personal communication. This inactivation guarantees for the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of the PTP substrates, i.e. focal adhesion kinase and p190Rho GTPase-activating protein (12Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Taddei L. Giannoni E. Camici G. Manao G. Raugei G. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4640-4646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Beside the regulation of PTPs, anchorage-dependent ROS can regulate protein tyrosine phosphorylation through a direct action on protein-tyrosine kinases. We recently reported a direct redox regulation of the tyrosine kinase Src, which undergoes a strong activation mediated by an intramolecular disulfide bond formation in response to integrin receptor engagement (6Giannoni E. Buricchi F. Raugei G. Ramponi G. Chiarugi P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6391-6403Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The results described herein correspondingly support the novel idea that ROS regulate cytoskeleton dynamics through both indirect and direct systems. Indirect regulation is translated through soluble redox-sensitive enzymes, as low molecular weight-phosphotyrosine phosphatase or Src, whose oxidation gives rise to a signal culminating in cytoskeleton rearrangement (5Chiarugi P. Pani G. Giannoni E. Taddei L. Colavitti R. Raugei G. Symons M. Borrello S. Galeotti T. Ramponi G. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 933-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 6Giannoni E. Buricchi F. Raugei G. Ramponi G. Chiarugi P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6391-6403Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Besides this indirect regulation, ROS can act on actin cytoskeleton through a shorter way, i.e. the direct oxidation of a cytoskeletal protein as actin. Previous studies indicated that, following engagement of integrin receptors, the small GTPase Rac-1 plays a key role in ROS production though the activation of 5-LOX (5Chiarugi P. Pani G. Giannoni E. Taddei L. Colavitti R. Raugei G. Symons M. Borrello S. Galeotti T. Ramponi G. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 933-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). We now find that the depletion of 5-LOX driven oxidants greatly affects actin organization and hence cell spreading. ECM-spreading cells treated with this inhibitor display a morphology very similar to PL-adhering cells showing a round profile. Herein we report that ROS produced during integrin-mediated cell adhesion affect the ability to spread of ECM-seeded cells targeting the actin cytoskeleton. Indeed, antioxidant-treated cells display chaotic actin fibers and a disorganized peripheric actin ring. We therefore reasoned that ROS are not involved in actin oxidation as housekeeping mediators, in agreement with their role as inducible second messengers of integrin receptor signaling. In fact, administration of this antioxidant when cell spreading is completed does not influence the whole cytoskeletal structure, signifying that ROS participate in actin reorganization only during the dynamic process of ECM-induced cell spreading. We highlight that ROS are not merely by-products of 5-LOX during leukotriene synthesis and may be included among primary products of this enzyme. Actually, based on several preliminary reports describing leukotrienes produced by LOX as key molecules involved in cell adhesion regulation (13Massoumi R. Nielsen C.K. Azemovic D. Sjolander A. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 289: 342-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 14Nagata M. Saito K. Tsuchiya K. Sakamoto Y. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2002; 109: 676-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), we can speculate that both lipid and oxidant LOX products synergize in the regulation of cell adhesion. Intracellular oxidation can result in the formation of mixed disulfides between protein sulfydryl groups and GSH resulting in S-glutathionylated proteins. Actin glutathionylation has been already reported during epidermal growth factor (10Wang J. Boja E.S. Tan W. Tekle E. Fales H.M. English S. Mieyal J.J. Chock P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47763-47766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) and in hepatocytes and hepatoma cells exposed to oxidative stress (15Fratelli M. Demol H. Puype M. Casagrande S. Eberini I. Salmona M. Bonetto V. Mengozzi M. Duffieux F. Miclet E. Bachi A. Vandekerckhove J. Gianazza E. Ghezzi P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3505-3510Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). The present findings indicate an increase in actin glutathionylation upon engagement of integrin receptors, suggesting that GSH is heavily involved in actin regulation during cytoskeleton rearrangement due to cell spreading. Indeed, GSH-depleted cells show lesser spreading and great impairment of cytoskeleton organization, similar to cells treated with NDGA. In particular, the effect of BSO on cytoskeletal organization and cell spreading can be relieved by re-administration of GSH, suggesting that the inhibition of cell spreading in response to GSH depletion, and hence to the induced oxidative stress, is reversible. Hence we correlated actin glutathionylation with cell spreading and the impairment of this glutathionylation, due to GSH depletion, to a rounded shape and a ring-like actin cytoskeleton. This statement is in keeping with the previous findings of Wang et al. (10Wang J. Boja E.S. Tan W. Tekle E. Fales H.M. English S. Mieyal J.J. Chock P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47763-47766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), describing that cell rounding upon growth factor-induced mitosis is correlated with actin de-glutathionylation. In vivo actin glutathionylation is a simple way in which oxidants exert their role in protein post-translational modification. It has been reported in vivo and in vitro that the oxidation of a sulfhydryl group to sulfenic acid (SOH) rapidly and spontaneously leads to further oxidation products such as sulfinic and sulfonic acid (SO2 and SO3) (16Claiborne A. Yeh J.I. Mallett T.C. Luba J. Crane E.J. II I Charrier V. Parsonage D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15407-15416Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). These further S-oxidation states are probably terminal products on which cellular reduction systems cannot operate, leading to permanently modified proteins. In intracellular systems with low oxidation grade to redox-sensitive proteins, the formation of disulfides, either between intra- or intermolecular protein cysteines or with a mixed disulfide with GSH, retains a key role (16Claiborne A. Yeh J.I. Mallett T.C. Luba J. Crane E.J. II I Charrier V. Parsonage D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15407-15416Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). This post-translational modification has been recently suggested as a possible means of redox regulation of protein function and activity and, therefore, one of the mechanisms whereby oxidants exert a regulatory effect on cell function (17Ghezzi P. Bonetto V. Fratelli M. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2005; 7: 964-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 18Giustarini D. Rossi R. Milzani A. Colombo R. Dalle-Donne I. J. Cell Mol. Med. 2004; 8: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 19Huang K.P. Huang F.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 1049-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In this light actin glutathionylation may be a mechanism that protects cells against irreversible organization of microfilaments, regulating actin polymerization and preserving microfilaments dynamics. Although actin contains six highly conserved cysteine residues, the three-dimensional structure reveals that only the thiol of cysteine in position 374 is exposed on the surface of the molecule, so as to be accessible to solvents and highly mobile (20Dalle-Donne I. Rossi R. Milzani A. Di Simplicio P. Colombo R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 1624-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). In addition, surface exposure of Cys374 is not influenced by actin polymerization into F-actin (21Orlova A. Galkin V.E. VanLoock M.S. Kim E. Shvetsov A. Reisler E. Egelman E.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Our findings suggest that in vivo actin oxidation involves cysteine 374 and that this residue probably plays a key role in GSH disulfide formation upon integrin engagement and in cell spreading. In fact, the removal of cysteine 374 causes redox insensitivity of actin and completely impedes actin fiber formation and cell spreading but not cell motility. These results support the idea that cysteine 374 plays a role only during cell spreading and whole actin cytoskeleton organization but not during the dynamic of cytoskeleton reorganization of a moving cells, thus suggesting that actin dynamics are dissimilar during adhesion of cells or during cell movement. Furthermore, the key role of Cys374 in actin polymerization is further indicated by its ability to act as an in vivo dominant negative mutant, since it is able to almost completely suppress the organization of endogenous actin, obstructing filament formation. On the other side we exclude that the C374A mutant affects actin function as a result of a conformational change, as indicated by its ability to completely support cell motility. Although actin has already been indicated as a redox-sensitive protein during induced oxidative stress (9Laragione T. Bonetto V. Casoni F. Massignan T. Bianchi G. Gianazza E. Ghezzi P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14737-14741Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), we report here the first evidence of an in vivo actin oxidation by a physiological source of ROS. Exogenous oxidative stress has been implied in the disruption of cytoskeleton both during diamide treatment and in fibroblasts of Friederich ataxia patients, a disease correlated with iron-mediated oxidative stress (20Dalle-Donne I. Rossi R. Milzani A. Di Simplicio P. Colombo R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 1624-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 22Liu S.M. Sundqvist T. Exp.

In both reports the exogenous oxidative stress is correlated with a stable high level of actin glutathionylation and impairment of cytoskeleton function. On the contrary, our data propose actin glutathionylation as a key signaling event downstream of integrin receptor engagements. In this context ROS act as physiological messengers transiently increasing upon ECM contact and peaking in concomitance of cell spreading. The transitory redox regulation of actin during integrin receptor engagement leads to cytoskeleton organization and cell spreading. We suggest that a continuous oxidative stress, as in diamide-treated or ataxia cells, can greatly differ from a transient signaling event, and this can account for the different effect observed on actin cytoskeleton organization. Myosin II is the major motor protein in both muscle and non-muscle cells, and its main role is to regulate contraction in association with actin filaments. nmMHCII is a part of the actinomyosin cytoskeleton, which is subject to continuous remodeling in response to ECM contact to allow cell shape changes (25Piekny A.

Although a high resolution structure of the actomyosin interface is not yet available, we suggest that the redox modification to which actin undergoes during cell spreading negatively regulates the binding between actin and myosin, thus exerting a crucial effect on the dynamic cycles of assembly/disassembly of the contractile machinery. We further speculate that the disassembly of the actinomyosin complex caused by actin glutathionylation could strongly contribute to impairment of microfilament function in diamide treated or Friederich ataxia cells (24Pastore A. Tozzi G. Gaeta L.M. Bertini E. Serafini V. Di Cesare S. Bonetto V. Casoni F. Carrozzo R. Federici G. Piemonte F. J. Biol.

Cytoskeleton dynamics leading to cell spreading through loss of contractility and organization of actin fibers involve the two antagonistic small GTPases Rho and Rac through three synergic pathways, two of which are redox-based. First, activation of Rac-1 regulates the phosphorylation of myosin heavy chain and actinomyosin disassembly, leading to loss of contractility and to cell spreading (29van Leeuwen F.N. van Delft S. Kain H.E. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Second, the Rac-mediated ROS production during cell adhesion leads to a down-regulation of Rho activity finally culminating in loss of contractility and permitting cell spreading (7Nimnual A.S. Taylor L.J. Bar-Sagi D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 236-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Our herein presented data point to a third mechanism regulating cytoskeleton assembly in response to ECM contact, through a redox-based actin reorganization due to glutathionylation (Fig. 6). We emphasize the role of a direct regulation though oxidation of actin function, but the precise mechanism by which oxidants change the structure and the spatial organization of actin filaments remains to be elucidated."
https://openalex.org/W2023992908,"Oncogenic Ras interferes with adhesive functions of epithelial cells, but requires tumor growth factor β (TGFβ) signaling to cause epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumor progression in model systems. To investigate the mechanisms by which Ras and TGFβ pathways cooperate in EMT induction, we introduced a tamoxifen-inducible version of Raf-1 (RafER) into fully polarized, mammary epithelial cells (EpH4). EMT characterized by loss of E-cadherin expression and upregulation of invasiveness-promoting genes was induced by TGFβ plus 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4HT) activation of RafER. Downregulation of E-cadherin by RafER plus TGFβ was detectable in total cell lysates after 48 h and much earlier in detergent-insoluble fractions of E-cadherin. Both pathways cooperated to strongly enhance endocytosis of E-cadherin, mainly via the clathrin-dependent route. Pulse-chase experiments showed decreased E-cadherin protein stability in cells stimulated with TGFβ and 4HT and increased E-cadherin half-life in the presence of monensin. Monensin and chloroquine prevented E-cadherin degradation to different extent, but only monensin effectively blocked the loss of E-cadherin from the junctional complexes. Both lysosome inhibitors caused accumulation of E-cadherin vesicles, some of which were positive for Cathepsin D and lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP-1). In addition, TGFβ and mitogen-activated protein kinase hyperactivation synergistically induced E-cadherin ubiquitination, suggesting that the cooperation of Raf and TGFβ favors lysosomal degradation of E-cadherin instead of its recycling. Our data indicate that early stages of EMT involve cooperative, post-translational downregulation of E-cadherin, whereas loss of E-cadherin via transcriptional repression is a late event in EMT."

Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) 2The abbreviations used are: Kv channel, voltage-gated potassium channel; MiRP, MinK-related peptide; ES, embryonic stem. channels repolarize excitable cells by opening in response to membrane depolarization to permit K+ ion efflux. In addition to the 40 known genes that encode the pore-forming (α) subunits of Kv channels (1Gutman G.A. Chandy K.G. Grissmer S. Lazdunski M. McKinnon D. Pardo L.A. Robertson G.A. Rudy B. Sanguinetti M.C. Stuhmer W. Wang X. Pharmacol.

One family of ancillary subunits, the MinK-related peptides (MiRPs, encoded by KCNE genes), contributes five known members to the human genome. MiRPs are single transmembrane domain subunits that co-assemble with Kv α subunits, altering their gating, conductance, regulation, and pharmacology (2McCrossan Z.A. Abbott G.W. Neuropharmacology. 2004; 47: 787-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The MiRP1 protein, encoded by the KCNE2 gene, is now more commonly referred to as KCNE2, and this nomenclature is used here to avoid confusion. KCNE2 regulates hERG potassium channels, and KCNE2-hERG complexes are thought, at least in part, to generate the cardiac IKr current, the major repolarizing force in human ventricles (3Abbott G.W.

Aside from interacting with hERG, KCNE2 has been found to modulate other Kv α subunits in heterologous co-expression studies, including KCNQ1 (also known as Kv7.1) (7Tinel N. Diochot S. Borsotto M. Lazdunski M. Barhanin J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6326-6330Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), Kv3.1, Kv3.2 (8Lewis A. McCrossan Z.A. Abbott G.W. J. Biol.

Res. 2001; 88: 1012-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Effects of KCNE2 on KCNQ1 are particularly dramatic: KCNE2 converts KCNQ1 to a voltage-independent “leak” channel that retains K+ selectivity but is constitutively active regardless of membrane potential (7Tinel N. Diochot S. Borsotto M. Lazdunski M. Barhanin J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6326-6330Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In addition to its role in human heart, KCNQ1 is required for normal gastric acid secretion (10Grahammer F. Herling A.W. Lang H.J. Schmitt-Graff A. Wittekindt O.H. Nitschke R. Bleich M. Barhanin J.

KCNE2, like KCNQ1, is expressed in parietal cells, leading to the suggestion that KCNE2 might co-assemble with KCNQ1 in parietal cells (10Grahammer F. Herling A.W. Lang H.J. Schmitt-Graff A.

Aside from heart and stomach, KCNE2 has also been detected in kidney, lung, bladder, brain, spinal cord, and skeletal muscle (2McCrossan Z.A. Abbott G.W.

Here, we disrupted the murine kcne2 gene to identify its roles in mammalian physiology. The results demonstrate for the first time that KCNE2 is required for gastric acid secretion and also the first genetic evidence of a role for any of the KCNE proteins in the gastrointestinal tract. These findings have implications for the physiology, pharmacology, and pharmacogenetics of the mammalian gastrointestinal tract and potentially for treatment of pathophysiologic conditions such as gastro-esophageal reflux disease and peptic ulcers. Targeted Disruption of Kcne2—Kcne2 was disrupted in RF8 129/SvJae murine embryonic stem (ES) cells by homologous recombination using standard techniques (14Nagy A. Gertenstein M. Vintersten K.

A 3.2-kb 3′-genomic DNA fragment, beginning 29 nucleotides downstream of the kcne2 stop codon, was amplified by PCR from SV129J (ES) cell DNA using the following primers: forward, 5′-CCGTCTCAATTGGACAGGGTGCTTCTGCTGCC-3′ and reverse, 5′-ATGTGTCAATTGAGCAGACTAAGCAGAAAGACTCTAAAGGG-3′.A 3.3-kb 5′-genomic DNA fragment, ending with the nucleotide prior to the start codon, was amplified by PCR from SV129J ES cell DNA using the following primers: forward, 5′-AGCCTTTGCTGTCTGTTGTAGGC-3′ and reverse 5′-AGTGACTCTAGCTAGTGCCCAGG-3′. The 3′- and 5′-fragments were sequentially subcloned into the Mfe1 and the SalI-ClaI sites of the pNTK-loxP vector (15Francis S.A. Shen X. Young J.B. Kaul P. Lerner D.J. Blood. 2006; 107: 1627-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Homologous recombination of the targeting vector replaces the entire open reading frame of kcne2 (Fig. 1A). Homologous recombination of the targeting vector in ES cells was confirmed by Southern blotting using 3′- and 5′-probes outside the recombined region. The primer sequences for amplifying the probes were 5′-probe (giving 324-bp probe): forward, 5′-AGCCTTTGCTGTCTGTTGTAGGC-3′ and reverse, 5′-AGTGACTCTAGCTAGTGCCCAGG-3′;3′-probe (giving 375-bp probe): forward, 5′-CCAGTATCAACTTCAACCAAAGC-3′ and reverse, 5′-TTGTGCTAACAAGAGAATATCACG-3′ (Fig. 1A). Correctly targeted ES cells were aggregated with C57BL/6 mouse blastocysts and implanted into C57BL/6 female mice to generate chimeric progeny. The chimeric progeny were bred to C57BL/6 mice to generate 50:50 129/SvJae:C57BL/6 progeny, which in turn were interbred to generate the mice used in this study. All mice functionally characterized in this study were 10-15 weeks of age, from F2 and F3 generations. All mice were housed, experimented on, and euthanized according to Cornell University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines. Reverse Transcription PCR and Western Blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from the stomachs of ∼12-week-old kcne2 (+/+) and (-/-) littermates, DNase cleaned, and reverse transcribed. A portion of the kcne2 gene was amplified using the following primers (5′ to 3′): CCCAGACACTGGAGGATGCC (sense) and ACTGTGAACCCCGTCGCCCC (antisense), giving a PCR product of 340 bp from kcne2 (+/+) mice and no signal from kcne2 (-/-) mice. For detection of KCNE2 protein, membrane fractions from stomachs extracted from adult kcne2 (-/-) and (+/+) littermates were prepared using modifications of previously reported protocols (16Barry D.M. Trimmer J.S. Merlie J.P. Nerbonne J.M. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 361-369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17McCrossan Z.A. Lewis A. Panaghie G. Jordan P.N. Christini D.J. Lerner D.J. Abbott G.W. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 8077-8091Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and analyzed using Western blotting with polyclonal anti-KCNE2 antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad Laboratories) for visualization with fluorography. Electron Microscopy and Histology—For electron microscopy, mid-stomach tissue from kcne2 (+/+), (+/-), and (-/-) mice (2/gender/genotype) was washed, fixed, stained, and dehydrated and then infiltrated and embedded in Spurr's resin. Sections were cut, contrasted with lead citrate, and viewed on a JSM 100 CX-II electron microscope (JEOL USA Inc., Peabody, MA) operated at 80 kV. Images were recorded on Kodak 4489 Electron Image film and then digitized on an Epson Expression 1600 Pro scanner at 900 dpi. For histology, kcne2 (+/+), (+/-), and (-/-) mice (2/gender/genotype) were sacrificed using CO2 asphyxiation. Stomachs were removed, fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, processed by routine methods, and embedded in paraffin wax. Sections (5 μm) were placed on super frost (positively charged) slides, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and evaluated with an Olympus BX45 light microscope (New York/New Jersey Scientific, Inc., Middlebush, NJ). Stomach sections were also stained with periodic acid-Schiff for demonstration of mucin. Immunohistochemistry—Immunohistochemical detection was performed with a Discovery XT System (Ventana Medical Systems) using slides prepared from stomach sections as for histology. For single labeling with diaminobenzidine detection a 30-min blocking step was employed, using 10% normal goat serum (Vector Laboratories; catalog number S-1000) and 2% bovine serum albumin (KCNQ1) or MOM Blocking reagent (Vector Laboratories; catalog number MKB-2213) (H+/K+-ATPase β-subunit) followed by avidin and biotin incubation for 4-8 min each. Incubation with the primary antibodies (KCNQ1, Chemicon catalog number AB5932; 1 mg/ml; H+/K+-ATPase β-subunit, Affinity Bioreagents catalog number MA3-923; 0.5 mg/ml) was carried out for 3 h at room temperature followed by 60 min of incubation with: for KCNQ1, biotinylated anti-rabbit antibody at 1:200 dilution (Vectastain ABC kit (rabbit IgG) catalog number PK-6101) or for H+/K+-ATPase β-subunit, biotinylated anti-mouse IgG (H+L) secondary antibody at 1:250 dilution (Vector MOM basic kit catalog number BMK-2202). Diaminobenzidine detection kit containing Blocker D, Copper D, Inhibitor D, streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase D and diaminobenzidine D (Ventana Medical Systems) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Slides were viewed with a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope and photographed using a RT Color Camera and SPOT software (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.). Whole Stomach and Parietal Cell pH Measurements—Studies were conducted on gastric tissue from 3-month-old kcne2 (+/+), (+/-), and (-/-) mice using methods described previously (18Wang W.H. Henderson R.M. Geibel J. White S. Giebisch G. J. Membr. Biol. 1989; 111: 277-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 19Geibel J. Giebisch G. Boron W.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: F790-F797PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, for whole stomach measurements, stomachs were ligated ex vivo at the esophageal and duodenal junctures and excised, infused with 0.3-0.5 ml of non-buffered, isotonic saline, and then incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in oxygenated HEPES-buffered Ringer's solution (pH 7.4) with or without 100 μm histamine (Sigma-Aldrich) before measuring pH of the aspirated stomach contents. For parietal cell measurements, individual gastric glands were hand dissected and loaded with the pH-sensitive dye 2′,7-bis(2-carbocyethyl)-5-(and 6) carboxyfluoresceinacetomethylester (BCECF) (Invitrogen). Proton extrusion by individual parietal cells was monitored by observing recovery of intracellular pH (pHi) in the presence of 100 μm histamine or 100 μm carbachol (Sigma-Aldrich) after acidification using the NH4Cl prepulse technique (20Roos A. Boron W.F. Physiol. Rev. 1981; 61: 296-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (2297) Google Scholar). Serum Gastrin Measurements—Mice were euthanized by carbon dioxide asphyxiation. Whole blood was collected postmortem by cardiac puncture following euthanasia. Following coagulation of the remaining whole blood at room temperature for 30 min, the clotted blood was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5-10 min at 4 °C. Aliquots of serum were submitted to a commercial reference laboratory (Clinical Pathology Laboratory at Animal Medical Center, New York, NY) for determination of biochemical parameters. Serum gastrin levels were determined by AniLytics, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD) using a double antibody radioimmunoassay (Diagnostic Products Corp., Los Angeles, CA). Statistical Analyses—Numerical data were analyzed with EXCEL software (Microsoft) using one-way analysis of variance with statistical significance set at p < 0.05. Disruption of the kcne2 Gene—To determine physiological roles of KCNE2 we disrupted the kcne2 gene by homologous recombination in murine ES cells to create kcne2 (-/-) mice in a 50:50 C57BL/6:129/SVJae genetic background (Fig. 1, A and B). kcne2 transcript and its protein product KCNE2 are expressed in stomach tissue of wild-type mice but absent from that of kcne2 (-/-) mice (Fig. 1, C and D). kcne2 (+/-) matings generated offspring with the expected Mendelian frequencies, kcne2 (+/+), 25%; kcne2 (+/-), 46%; kcne2 (-/-), 29% (n = 114), indicating that KCNE2 is not required for embryo viability in the 50:50 C57BL/6:129/SVJae genetic background. kcne2 (-/-) Mice Exhibit Increased Stomach Mass Due to Marked Glandular Hyperplasia—kcne2 (+/-) and (-/-) mice had normal outward appearance, and body weights of 12-15-week kcne2 (+/+), (+/-), and (-/-) mice were similar: male, 26.8 ± 0.8 g, 26.1 ± 0.4 g, 25.8 ± 0.8 g, respectively; female, 20.6 ± 1.3 g, 20.3 ± 0.5 g, 21.0 ± 0.4 g, respectively (n = 6-14; no significant difference between groups). In contrast, internal examination revealed that kcne2 (-/-) mice had markedly enlarged stomachs (Fig. 2A). In particular, the kcne2 (-/-) stomachs exhibited unusually prominent rugal folds and marked hyperplasia of the glandular stomach compared with kcne2 (+/+) and (+/-) mice, with no apparent differences in the non-glandular stomach (Fig. 2B). Stomachs from kcne2 (-/-) mice had a 4-fold greater mass (0.5 ± 0.04 g) than those of kcne2 (+/+) (0.13 ± 0.03 g) or (+/-) mice (0.13 ± 0.03 g) (p < 0.001, n = 3-5; Fig. 2C). kcne2 (+/-) and (-/-) Mice Have Impaired Gastric Acid Secretion—Given the markedly abnormal appearance of the stomach in kcne2 (-/-) mice, we measured the pH in ex vivo stomachs to ascertain whether kcne2 is required for normal gastric acid secretion. The stomachs from kcne2 (+/+) mice had a mean basal pH of 3.9 ± 0.1, which was significantly reduced to pH 2.8 ± 0.2 when stimulated with 100 μm histamine (p < 0.01). In contrast, the mean luminal pH in stomachs from kcne2 (-/-) mice was strikingly more alkaline under basal conditions (pH 6.5 ± 0.2) and was not significantly altered by histamine (pH 6.6 ± 0.2). Importantly, the mean luminal pH in kcne2 (+/-) mice was intermediate between the two (basal, pH 4.6 ± 0.2) and was significantly shifted by histamine stimulation (pH 3.8 ± 0.2, p < 0.05) (Fig. 3; n = 5-8 stomachs/group). These data demonstrate that disruption of the kcne2 gene impairs gastric acid secretion and that the effect of kcne2 on gastric acid secretion is gene-dose dependent. kcne2 (-/-) Mice Have a Primary Defect in Gastric Acid Secretion—Gastrin, produced by G-cells in the antrum of the stomach, is a peptide hormone that stimulates parietal cell acid secretion. Impaired gastrin production can result in reduced gastric acid secretion (21Friis-Hansen L. Sundler F. Li Y. Gillespie P. Saunders T. Greenson J. Owyang C. Rehfeld J. Samuelson L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: G561-G568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the hypochlorhydria in kcne2 (+/-) and achlorhydria in kcne2 (-/-) mice were due to a defect in gastrin production or release, we compared serum gastrin levels in kcne2 (+/+), (+/-), and (-/-) mice. Gastrin levels were markedly elevated in kcne2 (-/-) mice: 421 and 213 pg/ml in the two knock-out mice evaluated compared with 93 and 33 pg/ml for two wild-type littermates and 45 and 28 pg/ml for two kcne2 (+/-) mice in this study. Previous reports indicated that normal murine gastrin levels are in the range of 32-67 pg/ml (12Lee M.P. Ravenel J.D. Hu R.J. Lustig L.R. Tomaselli G. Berger R.D. Brandenburg S.A. Litzi T.J. Bunton T.E. Limb C. Francis H. Gorelikow M. Gu H. Washington K. Argani P. Goldenring J.R. Coffey R.J. Feinberg A.P. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 1447-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 22Watson S.A. Smith A.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 625-631PubMed Google Scholar). These data demonstrated that achlorhydria in kcne2 (-/-) mice and hypochlorhydria in kcne2 (+/-) mice were not due to a secondary defect in gastrin production or release. The results suggested that kcne2 disruption causes a primary defect in parietal cell acid secretion. kcne2 (-/-) Mice Have Gastric Glandular Hyperplasia, Confined to Non-acid Secretory Cells—Histological examination demonstrated that kcne2 (-/-) mice exhibit significant diffuse gastric glandular hyperplasia characterized by lengthening of both the fundus and neck portions of the stomach. These hyperplastic gastric glands were lined primarily with tall, columnar cells exhibiting unusually abundant cytoplasm that was pale blue when stained with hematoxylin and eosin (Fig. 4A) and magenta when stained with periodic acid-Schiff (Fig. 4B), indicating these columnar cells were mucous neck and/or chief cells. In contrast, the gastric glands of kcne2 (+/+) and (+/-) mice displayed no hyperplasia and were of normal size (Fig. 4A). In addition, there were mild to moderate numbers of neutrophils scattered within the lamina propria basally, the submucosa, and the muscularis in all kcne2 (-/-) stomachs studied (n = 4) but in none of the stomachs from wild-type or heterozygous mice (Fig. 4A). H+/K+-ATPase β-subunit expression is an established marker of parietal cells in gastric glands (23Karvar S. Yao X. Crothers Jr., J.M. Liu Y. Forte J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50030-50035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Using specific antibodies, we found characteristic H+/K+-ATPase β-subunit distribution confined largely to cells in the upper and middle neck region of gastric glands from both kcne2 (+/+) and (-/-) mice (Fig. 5, A and B). Cell counts of H+/K+-ATPase β-subunit positive versus negative cells revealed no significant difference in the mean number of H+/K+-ATPase β-subunit positive cells per gastric gland cross-section between kcne2 (+/+) (13.8 ± 0.3) and kcne2 (-/-) mice (12.2 ± 0.5) (p > 0.05; n = 50 glands/genotype). However, total cells per gland cross-section in kcne2 (-/-) mice (62.9 ± 0.9) were approximately double that of kcne2 (+/+) mice (28.8 ± 0.4) (p < 0.001; n = 50 glands/phenotype). Thus, gastric gland hyperplasia in kcne2 (-/-) mice was confined to cells lacking the H+/K+-ATPase β-subunit, suggesting hyperplasia only of non-acid secretory cell types. KCNQ1 Expression Is Up-regulated in kcne2 (-/-) Mice— KCNQ1 was previously suggested as a putative partner for KCNE2 in parietal cells (10Grahammer F. Herling A.W. Lang H.J. Schmitt-Graff A. Wittekindt O.H. Nitschke R. Bleich M. Barhanin J. Warth R. Gastroenterology. 2001; 120: 1363-1371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 13Heitzmann D. Grahammer F. von Hahn T. Schmitt-Graff A. Romeo E. Nitschke R. Gerlach U. Lang H.J. Verrey F. Barhanin J. Warth R. J. Physiol. 2004; 561: 547-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In gastric glands, KCNQ1 is expressed predominantly in parietal cells of wild-type mice but reportedly exhibits lower level expression in non-parietal cell types such as mucous-producing cells (10Grahammer F. Herling A.W. Lang H.J. Schmitt-Graff A. Wittekindt O.H. Nitschke R. Bleich M. Barhanin J. Warth R. Gastroenterology. 2001; 120: 1363-1371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Here, using antibodies raised against KCNQ1 α subunit, we found KCNQ1 distribution in the stomach corpus of kcne2 (+/+) mice similar to that previously reported, with a region of high expression in parietal cells confined largely to a band in the upper and middle neck region of gastric glands and weaker expression in the fundus and surface cells of gastric glands. In contrast, in kcne2 (-/-) mice, KCNQ1 was highly expressed more uniformly throughout the gastric gland in parietal and non-parietal cells, from the fundus through to the surface cells (Fig. 5, C and D). Quantification of this redistribution by cell counting (n = 25 glands/genotype) indicated that the stronger KCNQ1 labeling was detected in a mean of 11.4 ± 0.4 cells per gastric gland in kcne2 (+/+) mice compared with a mean of 21.6 ± 0.7 cells per gastric gland in kcne2 (-/-) mice, a 2-fold increase in the latter. This altered KCNQ1 distribution was suggestive of compensatory remodeling in response to the absence of kcne2. kcne2 (-/-) Mice Exhibit Abnormal Parietal Cell Morphology—Electron micrographs of the corpus region of the stomach showed highly abnormal parietal cell morphology in the absence of kcne2; in particular, the intracellular canaliculi of kcne2 (-/-) parietal cells were much larger than those in wild-type parietal cells, leading to abnormal distribution of mitochondria in kcne2 (-/-) parietal cells, in which they were confined to the cell periphery. Parietal cells from kcne2 (+/-) mice, however, appeared structurally normal (Fig. 6A). Chief cells in kcne2 (-/-) mice displayed no obvious differences from those of their wild-type littermates (Fig. 6B). These data demonstrate that KCNE2 is required for normal parietal cell morphology. It is noteworthy that although kcne2 (+/-) mice have impaired gastric acid secretion, their parietal cell morphology and glandular architecture are normal. This strongly suggests that KCNE2 has an important role in gastric acid secretion. KCNE2 Is Required for Parietal Cell Acid Secretion—Stimulation of parietal cell histamine H2 receptors or muscarinic M3 receptors triggers parietal cell proton release. To determine whether KCNE2 is required for agonist-triggered parietal cell proton release, we measured intracellular pH recovery in individual parietal cells in freshly isolated gastric glands after activation of H2 receptors with histamine (100 μm) or of muscarinic M3 receptors with carbachol (100 μm). The resting pH in parietal cells was similar in all three genotypes: 7.25 ± 0.03 in kcne2 (+/+), 7.28 ± 0.04 in kcne2 (+/-), and 7.26 ± 0.03 in kcne2 (-/-) (n = 70-150 cells from 3-5 mice/group). After an NH4Cl prepulse to acid load the cells and stimulation with either carbachol or histamine (100 μm), kcne2 (-/-) parietal cells had greatly suppressed rates of proton secretion: a mean ΔpH/minute of ∼0.01 units compared with ∼0.1 units in kcne2 (+/+) cells (p < 0.01). kcne2 (+/-) cells had an intermediate mean proton secretion rate of 0.05 pH units (p < 0.05) (Fig. 7, A and B; n = 70-150 cells from 3-5 mice/group). These results demonstrate that KCNE2 is required for normal proton extrusion by parietal cells in vitro. Gastric acidification is required for normal digestion and nutrient absorption in humans as well as for the sterilization of fluids and the prevention of bacterial overgrowth (24Champagne E.T. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1989; 249: 173-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The molecular regulation of parietal cell acid secretion is incompletely understood. The gastric H+/K+-ATPase is primarily responsible for acidification of the stomach lumen (11Spenney J.G. J. Clin. Gastroenterol. 1983; 5: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), and the 1:1 exchange of H+ ions for K+ ions by the H+/K+-ATPase requires a continuous supply of K+ from the luminal side (25Geibel J.P. World J. Gastroenterol. 2005; 11: 5259-5265Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To avoid rapid depletion of K+ in the stomach lumen along with a reduction of acid secretion, a K+ recycling path at the apical surface is required. Previous reports have provided genetic evidence that KCNQ1 is required for this K+ recycling mechanism (12Lee M.P. Ravenel J.D. Hu R.J. Lustig L.R. Tomaselli G. Berger R.D. Brandenburg S.A. Litzi T.J. Bunton T.E. Limb C. Francis H. Gorelikow M. Gu H. Washington K. Argani P. Goldenring J.R. Coffey R.J. Feinberg A.P. J. Clin.

A. 2005; 102: 17864-17869Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), although a range of candidate potassium channels have been proposed and some or all of them may be involved in this process (27Waldegger S. Pflugers Arch. 2003; 446: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Inward rectifier potassium channels Kir2.1, Kir4.1, Kir4.2, and Kir7.1 are expressed in gastric mucosa, with Kir2.1 reportedly showing the highest expression (28Fujita A. Horio Y. Higashi K. Mouri T. Hata F. Takeguchi N. Kurachi Y. J. Physiol. 2002; 540: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 29Malinowska D.H. Sherry A.M. Tewari K.P. Cuppoletti J. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C495-C506Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Kir2.1 colocalizes with H+/K+-ATPase in parietal cells and shows increased current when stimulated with lowered pH and protein kinase A (29Malinowska D.H. Sherry A.M. Tewari K.P. Cuppoletti J. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C495-C506Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Kir4.1, but not Kir4.2 or Kir7.1, is also expressed in parietal cells, where it reportedly localizes to the apical membrane (28Fujita A. Horio Y. Higashi K. Mouri T. Hata F. Takeguchi N. Kurachi Y.

Most inflammatory processes are self-limiting (1Majno G. Joris I. Cells, Tissues, and Disease.Principles of General Pathology. Oxford University Press, New York2004Google Scholar), implicating the existence of endogenous circuits for anti-inflammation and/or pro-resolution mediators that are operative during the temporal events of host defense and inflammation (recently reviewed in Refs. 2Serhan C.N.

Drug Discov. 2004; 3: 401-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). We identified and characterized lipid mediators that are generated during spontaneous resolution phase and that possess anti-inflammatory and/or pro-resolving properties; these include lipoxins, resolvins, and protectins (2Serhan C.N. Savill J. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 1191-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1776) Google Scholar). Like other autacoids, these lipid mediators are generated in response to stimuli, act locally, and may be rapidly inactivated by further metabolism via enzymatic pathways (4Bannenberg G.L. Chiang N.

Thus, it is important to identify the further metabolic products of these pro-resolving lipid mediators and evaluate their bioactivities in vivo. The resolvins and protectins are new families of lipid mediators derived from omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, namely eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, that are generated and act locally at sites of inflammation, where they counterregulate polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) 2The abbreviations used are: PMN, polymorphonuclear leukocyte; resolvin, resolution phase interaction product; RvE1, resolvin E1; PGDH, prostaglandin dehydrogenase; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; IL, interleukin; ESI, electrospray ionization; LC, liquid chromatography; GC, gas chromatography; LXA4, lipoxin A4; ATLa, 15-epi-16-(p-fluorophenoxy)-LXA4 methyl ester (LXA4 analog); LTB4, leukotriene B4; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; RANTES, regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted.2The abbreviations used are: PMN, polymorphonuclear leukocyte; resolvin, resolution phase interaction product; RvE1, resolvin E1; PGDH, prostaglandin dehydrogenase; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; IL, interleukin; ESI, electrospray ionization; LC, liquid chromatography; GC, gas chromatography; LXA4, lipoxin A4; ATLa, 15-epi-16-(p-fluorophenoxy)-LXA4 methyl ester (LXA4 analog); LTB4, leukotriene B4; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; RANTES, regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted. infiltration and promote resolution (for recent reviews, see Refs. 2Serhan C.N.

RvE1 is also formed by microbial cytochrome P450 monooxygenase in an aspirin-independent manner (11Arita M. Clish C.B. Serhan C.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), which can contribute to its production in vivo that is enhanced with aspirin treatment in both human (8Arita M. Bianchini F.

The complete stereochemistry of bioactive RvE1 was established and demonstrated to be (5S,12R,18R)-trihydroxy-6Z,8E,10E,14Z,16E-eicosapentaenoic acid (8Arita M. Bianchini F. Aliberti J. Sher A. Chiang N. Hong S. Yang R. Petasis N.A. Serhan C.N. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 713-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). RvE1 is active in both in vitro and in vivo systems, where it displays potent counterregulatory and tissue-protective roles. RvE1, for example, reduces neutrophil transendothelial migration in vitro in the nanomolar concentration range (7Serhan C.N. Clish C.B. Brannon J. Colgan S.P. Chiang N. Gronert K. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1197-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). These anti-inflammatory actions are also demonstrable in vivo, where RvE1 blocks PMN infiltration both in peritonitis (8Arita M. Bianchini F. Aliberti J. Sher A. Chiang N. Hong S. Yang R. Petasis N.A. Serhan C.N. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 713-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar) and in inflamed colon tissues during colitis (9Arita M. Yoshida M. Hong S. Tjonahen E. Glickman J.N. Petasis N.A. Blumberg R.S. Serhan C.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 7671-7676Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). RvE1 also attenuates antigen-presenting cell functions such as dendritic cell migration and interleukin (IL)-12 production in vivo (8Arita M. Bianchini F. Aliberti J. Sher A. Chiang N. Hong S. Yang R. Petasis N.A. Serhan C.N. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 713-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Here, we report that enzymatic conversion of RvE1 specifically generates 18-oxo-RvE1 resulting in its inactivation. An RvE1 stable analog was designed that resisted rapid conversion by dehydrogenation and retained biological activity that reduced both PMN infiltration and pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in vivo. Materials—Synthetic RvE1 was prepared by total organic synthesis and matched with the published criteria (8Arita M. Bianchini F. Aliberti J. Sher A. Chiang N. Hong S. Yang R. Petasis N.A. Serhan C.N. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 713-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). The RvE1 analog (19-(p-fluorophenoxy)-RvE1 methyl ester) was prepared in a stereochemically pure form by total organic synthesis (structure and olefinic region NMR spectrum is shown in Fig. 6A). Female C57BL/6J mice (7-8 weeks old) were from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Recombinant human 15-PGDH was isolated as described previously (6Clish C.B. Levy B.D. Chiang N. Tai H.-H. Serhan C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25372-25380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). NAD+, diethyl ether, and methoxamine hydrochloride were from Sigma. N,O-Bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide was from Fisher. LC-UV-MS/MS Analysis—Liquid chromatography-ultraviolet-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-UV-MS/MS) results were acquired with the LCQ (Thermo Finnigan) quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer system equipped with an electrospray ionization probe. RvE1 and its enzymatic products were suspended in mobile phase and injected into the HPLC component with a LUNA C18-2 (100 × 2 mm × 5 μm) column and a UV diode array detector. The column was eluted with methanol/water/acetic acid (58/42/0.01 (v/v/v)) at 0.2 ml/min. GC-MS Analysis—Carboxylic acid was methylated with excess ethereal diazomethane for 1 h at room temperature. The RvE1 metabolic product was derivatized with hydromethoxamine in pyridine to form methoxime for 2 h at room temperature, and hydroxyl groups were derivatized by N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide to form O-trimethylsilyl ether (12Powell W.S. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 128: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). GC-MS analysis was performed with a Hewlett-Packard 5971A mass selective detector quadropole equipped with a HPG1030A work station and GC 5890. The column was a HP-5MS (5% diphenyl-95% dimethylpolysiloxane). The temperature program was initiated at 150 °C for 2 min, reaching 230 °C at 10 min and then 280 °C at 20 min. Reference saturated fatty acid methyl esters carbons C16-C24 gave the following retention times (min): C16, 8.80; C18, 10.64; C20, 12.54; C22, 14.70; C24, 17.06; these were used to calculate C-values. Enzymatic Conversion of RvE1—RvE1 (5 μg) was incubated with recombinant human 15-PGDH (1 μg) and NAD+ (1 mm) in 100 μl of Tris-HCl buffer (50 mm, pH 9.0) at 37 °C. Increments in absorption at 340 nm were recorded, and reaction rates were calculated via first order regression curves computer-fitted to the change in absorption as a function of time. The product of this reaction was purified by solid extraction (Sep-Pak C18) and further purified by reverse-phase HPLC with a LUNA C18-2 (100 × 2 mm x 5 μm) column eluted with methanol/water/acetic acid (58/42/0.01 (v/v/v)) at 0.2 ml/min. RvE1 Metabolism in Cells and Tissues—Female C57BL/6J mice at 7-8 weeks were euthanized by isofluorane, and lungs (150-200 mg) were isolated and washed with ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Dissected organs were freeze-thawed three times and then suspended in 200 μl of PBS (pH 7.4) and 1 mm NAD+. Incubations were initiated by adding 1 μg of RvE1 at 37 °C, and after 2 h, 2 volumes of ice-cold methanol was added to terminate the reactions. Human PMN were isolated from healthy volunteers (Brigham and Women's Hospital protocol 88-02642) by Ficoll gradient as described previously (7Serhan C.N. Clish C.B. Brannon J. Colgan S.P. Chiang N. Gronert K. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1197-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). Freshly isolated PMNs were suspended at 25 × 106 cells in 0.5 ml of PBS, incubated with 1 μg of RvE1 for 20 min at 37 °C, and the reaction was stopped with 2 volumes of ice-cold methanol. Inflammation—Murine peritonitis was carried out as described previously (13Perretti M. Getting S.J. Winyard P.G. Willoughby D.A. Inflammation Protocols: Methods in Molecular Biology. 225. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2003: 139-146Google Scholar), and 100 ng/mouse of RvE1 sodium salt or 18-oxo-RvE1 was injected into the tail vein followed by 1 ml of zymosan A (1 mg/ml) injected into the peritoneum. For experiments with the RvE1 analog, RvE1 methyl ester or 19-(p-fluorophenoxy)-RvE1 methyl ester was each given intravenously at 1.0 μg/mouse. Peritoneal lavages were collected at 2 h, and cells were enumerated. For differential leukocyte counts, 100 μl of the lavaged cells were added to 100 μl of 30% bovine serum albumin and centrifuged onto microscope slides at 2,200 rpm for 4 min using a Cytofuge (StatSpin, Norwood, MA). The slides were allowed to air-dry, and cells were visualized using Wright Giemsa stain. Chemokine and cytokine levels were determined from peritoneal exudates using a SearchLight mouse chemokine array (Pierce). Enzymatic Conversion of RvE1—LC-MS/MS-based analyses were employed to determine whether 15-PGDH could catalyze the conversion of RvE1 to oxo metabolites. RvE1 eluted from the LC system at 10.9 min and gave a molecular anion of 349 atomic mass units ([M - H]− = m/z 349), which was rapidly and enzymatically converted to a product upon addition of recombinant human 15-PGDH and NAD+. The main product derived from RvE1 gave a retention time of 9.6 min and a molecular anion of 347 atomic mass units ([M - H]− = m/z 347) (Fig. 1A). The reduction in mass of 2 atomic mass units corresponded to the loss of two hydrogen atoms that could occur with the oxidation of one of the alcohol groups within RvE1 to give rise to an oxo group. The UV absorption spectrum of RvE1 shows a maxima at 271 and 234 nm consistent with the reported characteristics (8Arita M. Bianchini F. Aliberti J. Sher A. Chiang N. Hong S. Yang R. Petasis N.A. Serhan C.N. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 713-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar), indicative of the presence of both conjugated triene and diene chromophores. Conversion of an alcohol of RvE1 to an oxo group also switched the chromophore from diene to dienone (comprising a ketone in conjugation with the diene). This extension of conjugation lowered the difference in energy between ground and excited electronic states and consequently the absorption maximum was red-shifted from 234 to 270 nm (Fig. 1A). To gain evidence for the proposed oxo-RvE1 structure and the carbon position, the product ion mass spectrum (MS/MS) was analyzed. Oxo-RvE1 fragmented via: (i) neutral loss of H2O and CO2 to yield the product ions m/z 329 ([M - H]−-H2O), 311 ([M - H]−-2H2O), 303 ([M - H]−-CO2), 285 ([M - H]−-CO2-H2O), and 267 ([M - H]−-CO2-2H2O); and (ii) cleavages of the 17,18 C-C bond to yield m/z 291, 18,19 C-C bond to yield m/z 319, and 5,6 C-C bond to yield m/z 231 (Fig. 1B). The product ion derived from cleavage of the 17,18 C-C bond (m/z 291) implicated that the oxo group was at the carbon 18 position rather than the possible carbon 12 position or even the 5 position. To further confirm the oxo group at the carbon 18 position, the isolated compound was treated with diazomethane followed by methoxyamine to form the methoxime and analyzed using GC-MS. Selective ion monitoring at m/z = 535 (expected molecular weight of 18-oxo-RvE1 methyl ester in the presence of 2 trimethylsilane ether and 1 methoxime) identified a single peak at 18.6 min (C-value of 26.3). The MS spectrum of the trimethylsilane-derivatized methoxime product gave diagnostic fragments as reported and assigned in Fig. 2 (see inset). Therefore, the structure of RvE1 conversion product was confirmed as 18-oxo RvE1. Next, the time course of RvE1 conversion to 18-oxo-RvE1 by the dehydrogenase was monitored by the formation of NADH from NAD+ as increase in absorbance at 340 nm (Fig. 3). The initial conversion rate for RvE1 was 0.43 ± 0.07 μmol of NADH/min/mg of enzyme. Using essentially identical reaction conditions, prostaglandin E2 was converted at a rate of 1.43 ± 0.26 μmol of NADH/min/mg of enzyme. In addition, almost 50% less conversion was observed using the 6,7,14,15-diacetylenic derivative of RvE1 (n = 3, data not shown). Taken together, these results emphasize the structural recognition required for the dehydrogenase reaction. RvE1 Metabolism in Cells and Tissues—To address whether oxidation of the alcohol group at carbon 18 position represents a major pathway of RvE1 metabolism in cells or tissues, we performed RvE1 incubations with isolated mouse lung (Fig. 4A) and human PMN (Fig. 4B). As shown in Fig. 4A, lung incubations gave a single component beneath a peak of m/z = 347 at 9.8 min on LC-UV-MS chromatogram. This peak had a unique UV absorbance with a maximum at 270 nm (Fig. 4A, inset) and co-eluted with the enzymatically prepared 18-oxo-RvE1 by the recombinant 15-PGDH as described above. Tandem MS spectrum at m/z 347 further supported the identity of the lung incubation product as 18-oxo-RvE1 with the corresponding fragments at m/z 347 (M - H), 329 (M - H-H2O), 311 (M - H-2H2O), 303 (M - H-CO2), 285 (M - H-H2O-CO2), 275 (M - H-2H2O-CO2-2H), and diagnostic ions at m/z 291 and 257 (319-H2O-CO2). Approximately 25-30% of the added RvE1 was converted to 18-oxo-RvE1, and no other components were apparent at m/z 347 that corresponded to either 5-oxo or 12-oxo-RvE1. These results demonstrate that 18-oxo-RvE1 is the major initial oxidation product of RvE1 in the lung. On the other hand, RvE1 incubations with isolated human PMN gave a major single component beneath a peak of m/z = 365 at 3.9 min with UV chromophores at 234 and 271 nm, suggesting an oxidation product retaining diene and triene structures in the molecule (Fig. 4B and inset). The tandem mass spectrum of the material beneath this peak at m/z = 365 supported an ω-oxidation product 20-hydroxy-RvE1 structure with corresponding fragments at m/z 365 (M - H), 347 (M - H-H2O), 329 (M - H-2H2O), 321 (M - H-CO2), 311 (M - H-3H2O), 303 (M - H-H2O-CO2), 285 (M - H-2H2O- CO2), and 267 (M - H-3H2O-CO2) as well as diagnostic ions at m/z 291, 289 (307-H2O), 273 (291-H2O), and 195. Therefore, RvE1 metabolism was tissue- and cell-type specific, in that oxidation at the carbon 18 position was the major initial metabolism in the lung, and ω-oxidation to form 20-hydroxy-RvE1 was the major pathway in peripheral blood human PMN. Anti-inflammatory Actions of 18-Oxo-RvE1—To determine whether 18-oxo-RvE1 retained the bioactivities of RvE1 (8Arita M. Bianchini F. Aliberti J. Sher A. Chiang N. Hong S. Yang R. Petasis N.A. Serhan C.N. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 713-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar), the isolated 18-oxo-containing compound was assessed for its ability to regulate leukocyte infiltration in vivo using the zymosan-induced peritonitis. Intravenous administration of RvE1 at 100 ng reduced total leukocyte numbers by ∼25% in the inflamed peritoneal cavity and, specifically, stopped PMN infiltration by ∼40%. By direct comparison, 18-oxo-RvE1 at the same dose was essentially devoid of anti-inflammatory activity (Fig. 5). These results demonstrate that the conversion of RvE1 to its 18-oxo-product represents a mode of RvE1 inactivation. Blocking Metabolic Conversion of RvE1 Retains Function— Because RvE1 conversion to 18-oxo-RvE1 by dehydrogenation at carbon 18 represents biological inactivation (Fig. 5), an analog was designed with bulky substitutions placed adjacent to the 18 position on the ω-end of the molecule to resist both ω-oxidation and carbon 18 position oxidation, namely 19-(p-fluorophenoxy)-RvE1 methyl ester (Fig. 6A). This RvE1 analog was designed using an approach and rationale similar to that used for ATLa, a stable analog structure of aspirin-triggered lipoxin (14Takano T. Clish C.B. Gronert K. Petasis N.A. Serhan C.N. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 819-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 15Schottelius A.J. Giesen C. Asadullah K. Fierro I.M. Colgan S.P. Bauman J. Guilford W. Perez D.H. Parkinson J.F. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 7063-7070Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Here, a para-fluorophenoxy group substitution at carbon 19 was used in place of the remaining carbons at the ω-end (Fig. 6A). This novel RvE1 analog was resistant to rapid oxidation by the recombinant human dehydrogenase (Fig. 6, B and C). To determine whether the designed RvE1 substitution retained the anti-inflammatory activity of native RvE1, we evaluated this analog directly compared with the actions of RvE1 in vivo. This RvE1 analog, 19-(p-fluorophenoxy)-RvE1 methyl ester, proved to be as potent as native RvE1 in stopping total leukocyte infiltration and specifically PMN infiltration into murine peritonium (Table 1). Also the key cytokines and chemokines associated with leukocytes and inflammation were monitored (Table 2). At 2 h, both RvE1 and its analog markedly inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines (e.g. tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, KC, RANTES, and MCP-5). Thus these results indicate that the metabolically resistant RvE1 analog depicted in Fig. 6A retained the bioactivity of native RvE1.TABLE 1RvE1 and RvE1 stable analog stop PMN infiltration in vivo RvE1 methyl ester and 19-(p-fluorophenoxy)-RvE1 methyl ester were injected intravenously at 1 μg/mouse followed by 1 ml of zymosan A (1 mg/ml) into the peritoneum.

In the lung, dehydrogenation of the hydroxyl group at carbon 18 to form 18-oxo-RvE1 represented the major initial metabolic route for RvE1. The 18-oxo-RvE1 was devoid of the potent anti-inflammatory actions of its precursor RvE1 in vivo. A metabolically resistant RvE1 analog, namely 19-(p-fluorophenoxy)-RvE1 methyl ester, was prepared that proved to retain the anti-inflammatory actions of native RvE1 to reduce PMN infiltration and pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine productions in vivo. RvE1 has potent actions both in vitro and in vivo within the nanomolar range to stop leukocyte migration and protect tissues from leukocyte-mediated damage (8Arita M. Bianchini F. Aliberti J. Sher A.

In general, eicosanoids such as prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and lipoxins are generated from stored precursors, exert their bioactions at specific receptors (16Brink C. Dahlen S.E. Drazen J. Evans J.F. Hay D.W. Nicosia S. Serhan C.N. Shimizu T. Yokomizo T. Pharmacol. Rev. 2003; 55: 195-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), and are rapidly inactivated via local enzymatic catabolism in target tissues. Several enzyme pathways are described that are involved in eicosanoid metabolism via each of the main pathways, including β-oxidation, ω-oxidation, dehydrogenation, and/or reduction (5Tai H.-H. Ensor C.M. Tong M. Zhou H. Yan F. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2002; 68 (483-493): 68-69Google Scholar). Leukotriene B4 (LTB4), for example, is converted by ω-oxidation in human PMN by a cytochrome P450 enzyme (17Naccache P.H. Molski T.F. Becker E.L. Borgeat P. Picard S. Vallerand P. Sha'afi R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8608-8611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or by dehydrogenation at the 12-hydroxyl group to form 12-oxo-LTB4 in kidney (18Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Takahashi T. Kasama T. Kobayashi Y. Sato F. Taketani F. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18128-18135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LXA4 is converted by sequential dehydrogenation and reduction in macrophages by 15-PGDH and 15-oxoprostaglandin 13-reductase/LTB4 12-hydroxydehydrogenase (PGR/LTB4DH) (6Clish C.B. Levy B.D. Chiang N. Tai H.-H. Serhan C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25372-25380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). 15-PGDH activity is found in high levels in lung, liver, kidney, placenta, spleen, and immune cells and is involved in the metabolic inactivation of prostaglandins E2 and F2 and LXA4 (5Tai H.-H. Ensor C.M. Tong M. Zhou H. Yan F. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2002; 68 (483-493): 68-69Google Scholar, 19Hanza A. Cho H. Tai H.H. Zhan C.G. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2005; 13: 4544-4551Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that RvE1 undergoes initial metabolic pathways that are tissue- and/or cell-type specific, in that oxidation of alcohol group at the carbon 18 position was the major route in the lung, and ω-oxidation to form 20-hydroxy-RvE1 was a major route in human PMN. Moreover, in addition to the ω-6 carbon, i.e. C-15 hydroxyl dehydrogenase activities, we report here that 15-PGDH also serves as ω-3 C-18 hydroxyl dehydrogenase for RvE1 to form 18-oxo-RvE1, which results in inactivation of native RvE1. The inflammatory response of the body constitutes a recognition of invading pathogens, and chemicals, and/or tissue injury followed by recruitment of inflammatory cells clears the original stimulus and promotes resolution of inflammation, which allows tissue to return to homeostasis (1Majno G. Joris I. Cells, Tissues, and Disease.Principles of General Pathology. Oxford University Press, New York2004Google Scholar). Many inflammatory processes are self-limiting and self-resolving systems, suggesting the existence of endogenous anti-inflammatory and/or pro-resolution mediators that are operative during the course of inflammation (7Serhan C.N. Clish C.B. Brannon J. Colgan S.P. Chiang N. Gronert K. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1197-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). RvE1 is a potent anti-inflammatory lipid mediator derived from ω-3 eicosapentaenoic acid, which is generated during the spontaneous resolution phase of acute inflammation where specific cell-cell interactions occur (7Serhan C.N. Clish C.B. Brannon J. Colgan S.P. Chiang N. Gronert K. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1197-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar, 8Arita M. Bianchini F. Aliberti J. Sher A. Chiang N. Hong S. Yang R. Petasis N.A. Serhan C.N. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 713-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Here we have described that the counterregulatory activity of RvE1 on leukocyte migration is subject to enzymatic inactivation. This system may contribute in part to the return of inflamed tissue to homeostasis associated with a temporal switch of the families of lipid mediators generated during the course of inflammation and resolution (2Serhan C.N.

In the present experiments, a RvE1 analog, namely 19-(p-fluorophenoxy)-RvE1 methyl ester (Fig. 6A), was designed to protect from both ω-oxidation and/or rapid dehydrogenation at carbon 18 and was found to be essentially equipotent to native RvE1 in vivo in stopping leukocyte infiltration and reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine production in peritonitis. RvE1 oxidation at either the carbon 5 or 12 hydroxyl group is also possible, because 5- and 12-dehydrogenases have been shown to exist in some mammalian cells (18Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Takahashi T.

Thus designer resolvin mimetics that resist further metabolism/inactivation can be useful tools in vivo to evaluate the roles and actions of resolvins and their therapeutic potential for new treatment of human disorders associated with aberrant inflammation.

https://openalex.org/W2102403552,"Activation of dendritic cells by ligands for Toll-like receptors (TLR) is a crucial event in the initiation of innate and adaptive immune responses. Several classes of TLR ligands have been identified that interact with distinct members of the TLR-family. TLR4 ligands include lipopolysaccharide derived from different Gram-negative bacteria and viral proteins. Recent reports have demonstrated the TLR-mediated activation of dendritic cells by heat shock proteins (HSPs). However, doubts were raised as to what extent this effect was due to lipopolysaccharide contaminations of the HSP preparations. We re-examined this phenomenon using Gp96 or its N-terminal domain, nominally endotoxin-free (<0.5 enzyme units/mg). As described previously, innate immune cells are activated by Gp96 at high concentrations (≥50 μg/ml) but not at lower concentrations. However, preincubation of low amounts of Gp96 with TLR2 and TLR4 ligands at concentrations unable to activate dendritic cells by themselves results in the production of high levels of proinflammatory cytokines, up-regulation of activation markers, and amplification of T cell activation. Our results provide significant new insights into the mechanism of HSP-mediated dendritic cell activation and present a new function of HSPs in the amplification of dendritic cell activation by bacterial products and induction of adaptive immune responses.

First of all, they act as molecular chaperones involved in the folding of newly synthesized proteins as well as in degradation of misfolded proteins (1Parsell D.A. Lindquist S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 437-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (1850) Google Scholar, 2Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3565) Google Scholar). In addition, HSPs have been reported to fulfill immunological functions. These include the ability to associate with peptides derived from intracellular protein degradation and to induce adaptive immune responses against these peptides (3Schild H. Arnold-Schild D. Lammert E. Rammensee H.G. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 4Srivastava P. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). Based on these features, HSPs have been proposed to be involved in a process called cross-priming, which describes the uptake of antigens by professional APCs, the processing and presentation of these antigens by major histocompatibility complex molecules, and the subsequent activation of naive T cells (5Bevan M.J. J. Exp. Med. 1976; 143: 1283-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 6Arnold D. Faath S. Rammensee H. Schild H. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 885-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). A crucial event for this process to take place efficiently is the receptor-mediated interaction of HSPs with professional APCs, first reported in 1999 (7Arnold-Schild D. Hanau D. Spehner D. Schmid C. Rammensee H.G. de la Salle H. Schild H. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3757-3760PubMed Google Scholar). Only receptor-mediated uptake of HSP-peptide complexes allows peptide representation by major histocompatibility complex molecules (8Singh-Jasuja H. Toes R.E. Spee P. Munz C. Hilf N.

By now, several receptors on the surface of APCs able to specifically interact with HSPs have been identified. They include the receptor for α2-macroglobulin, CD91 (11Binder R.J. Han D.K.

MacAry P. Younson J.S. Singh M. Oehlmann W. Cheng G. Bergmeier L. Lehner T. Immunity. 2001; 15: 971-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In addition, during the incubation of HSP-peptide complexes with bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) for peptide representation, it was observed that this procedure leads to BMDC activation (16Singh-Jasuja H. Scherer H.U. Hilf N. Arnold-Schild D. Rammensee H.G. Toes R.E.M. Schild H. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 2211-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 17Basu S. Binder R.J. Suto R. Anderson K.M.

Immunol. 2000; 165: 6029-6035Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). This was observed for different members of the HSP family, including Hsp60, Hsp70, Hsp90, and Gp96, and appeared to reflect a peptide-independent feature (19Ohashi K. Burkart V. Flohe S. Kolb H. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 558-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar, 20Asea A. Kraeft S.K. Kurt-Jones E.A. Stevenson M.A. Chen L.B. Finberg R.W. Koo G.C. Calderwood S.K. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1344) Google Scholar). Evidence from different laboratories suggested that the effect of HSP-mediated activation of professional APCs depends mainly on the presence of functional TLR4, and to a lesser extent, also TLR2 molecules (21Vabulas R.M. Braedel S. Hilf N. Singh-Jasuja H. Herter S. Ahmad-Nejad P. Kirschning C.J. Da Costa C. Rammensee H.G. Wagner H. Schild H. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 15028-15034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar). This finding immediately raised concerns as to whether or not HSP molecules themselves or HSP-contaminating endotoxins are responsible for the effects observed (24Wallin R.P. Lundqvist A. More S.H. von Bonin A. Kiessling R. Ljunggren H.G. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 130-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). This concern was legitimate because all HSP preparations contained low, but detectable, amounts of endotoxin. Nevertheless, several control experiments, including pretreatment of HSP molecules with polymyxin B, which neutralizes LPS, suggested that HSP molecules and not endotoxins were responsible for the biological activity observed (24Wallin R.P. Lundqvist A. More S.H. von Bonin A. Kiessling R. Ljunggren H.G. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 130-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). However, modifications of the protocols used for HSP purification were able to dramatically reduce the levels of contaminating endotoxins, and these HSP preparations were not able to activate APCs but retained their chaperone functions as an indication for remaining biological activity (26Gao B. Tsan M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22523-22529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 27Gao B. Tsan M.F. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 31853-31860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). So we were left with a situation in which endotoxin-free HSPs did not activate professional APCs, but at the same time, concentrations of LPS alone corresponding to those found in activating HSP preparations were also not sufficient to induce activation (29Radsak M.P. Hilf N. Singh-Jasuja H. Braedel S. Brossart P. Rammensee H.G. Schild H. Blood. 2003; 101: 2810-2815Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Inspired by a constant observation during Gp96 purification, in which Gp96-containing fractions always showed 3–5 times higher endotoxin levels as compared with Gp96-free flanking fractions, we hypothesized that Gp96 binds LPS; therefore, LPS could become concentrated in the Gp96-containing fractions. Following this hypothesis, we decided to investigate the possibility that the interaction of Gp96 with LPS augments the biological activity of LPS. The observation that Gp96 molecules can bind LPS in a saturable and competable manner supported our premise (28Reed R.C. Berwin B. Baker J.P. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31853-31860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Stimulating DCs with a low concentration of LPS (<1 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of Gp96, we observed a 10–100-fold augmentation of the biological activity of LPS by Gp96 with regard to the production of proinflammatory cytokines, especially IL-12 p70, and the up-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules. When we extended our analysis to the entire spectrum of TLR ligands available to us, we observed that in addition to LPS, Gp96 also dramatically enhanced the biological activity of the TLR2 ligand Pam3Cys. For both ligands, the Gp96 enhanced activation of BMDCs resulted in significant activation of antigen-specific CTL. These data provide an explanation for the observed differences in the biological activities of Gp96. More importantly, however, we report here a new function of Gp96 molecules in the amplification of signals induced by TLR2 and four ligands that might be important for an earlier onset of innate immune responses during bacterial infections. Reagents—Gp96 purification (Immatics Biotechnologies, Tübingen, Germany) was according to the protocol described (6Arnold D. Faath S. Rammensee H. Schild H. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 885-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) with slight modifications (28Reed R.C. Berwin B. Baker J.P. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31853-31860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In brief, a pellet of the IGELa2 cell line (mouse, B cell myeloma; grown in suspension) was homogenized in hypotonic lysis buffer (30 mm NaHCO3, pH 7.1, containing protease inhibitors) and ultrasonicated. To remove cell debris, the lysate was centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g. The supernatant was sterile-filtered and mixed with a sterile phosphate-buffered saline buffer containing potassium and magnesium ions (final concentration 2 mm KCl and 2 mm MgCl2). The cleared lysate was purified by affinity chromatography on Sepharose-coupled concanavalin A (ConA-Sepharose; GE healthcare, Freiburg, Germany). Bound glycoproteins were eluted with phosphate-buffered saline containing 6% (w/v) methyl-α-d-mannopyranoside (Sigma, Taufkirchen, Germany), 2 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm KCl. The eluate was loaded on a Mono Q column and further separated by anion exchange chromatography using an ÄKTA explorer fast protein liquid chromatography system (GE Healthcare). Proteins were eluted applying a gradient of increasing NaCl concentration in 5 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. Gp96 elutes in a sharp peak at ∼350 mm NaCl. Pooled peak fractions were sterile-filtered (0.22 μm). To yield the efficient removal of LPS by detergent wash on column, an adapted method described by Reed et al. (28Reed R.C. Berwin B. Baker J.P. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31853-31860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) was applied for the purification of Gp96 used in Fig. 6. All materials were decontaminated prior to use, either by soaking in 70% EtOH, 0.5 m acetic acid or by baking for 4 h at 200 °C. All buffers were made in pyrogen-free water. After loading of the MonoQ column as described above, the column was washed sequentially with 400 ml of TTTE (25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% (v/v) Tween 20, 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 10 mm EDTA), 400 ml of 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% (v/v) Triton X-114, and 100 ml of 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 50 mm NaCl. The purity of Gp96 was >95% as analyzed by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-PAGE gels. Endotoxin content was determined by limulus amoebocyte lysate assay QCL-1000 (Cambrex, East Rutherford, NJ). The limulus amoebocyte lysate (LAL) assay was performed as determined in the manufacturer's protocol, which is in accordance with the guidelines published by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration. Bacterial endotoxin catalyzes the activation of a pro-enzyme in the LAL. The Gp96 sample (stock diluted 1:7, 1:49, 1:343) was mixed with the test kit LAL (containing the pro-enzyme) and incubated at 37 °c for 10 min. The synthetic substrate solution was then mixed with the LAL sample, and absorbance was measured at 405 nm. The correlation between the absorbance and the endotoxin concentration is linear in the 0.1–1.0 EU/ml range. As an internal endotoxin standard, we used Salmonella typhimurium LPS (Sigma), which is the same LPS we used for stimulation of the dendritic cells. Endotoxin content of the Gp96 preparations were in a range from 1.7 to 8 EU/mg Gp96 and below 0.5 EU/mg for Gp96 purified using the LPS removal procedure by Reed et al. (28Reed R.C. Berwin B. Baker J.P. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31853-31860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Canine GRP94 containing the amino acid residues 22–337 of Gp96 (Gp96.NTD) was purified according to the protocol described by Soldano et al. (53Soldano K.L. Jivan A. Nicchitta C.V. Gewirth T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48330-48338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In short, a Gp96.NTD-6XHis fusion was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21. Soluble, monomeric Gp96.NTD was purified by affinity chromatography on Ni2+ agarose (Sigma). To remove contaminating endotoxin, resin-bound NTD was extensively washed in TTTE buffer (25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% (v/v) Tween 20, 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-114, and 10 mm EDTA) at 4 °C. Following endotoxin removal, Gp96.NTD was eluted by the addition of imidazole buffer, and imidazole was subsequently removed by dialysis against endotoxin-free phosphate-buffered saline. Endotoxin was determined by limulus amoebocyte lysate assay (QCL-1000, Cambrex). The endotoxin content of Gp96.NTD was below 0.5 EU/mg. On SDS-PAGE, Gp96.NTD runs at about 36 kDa; the predicted molecular mass is 32 kDa. TLR4 agonist LPS (S. typhimurium) was from Sigma. TLR2 agonist palmitoyl-3-Cys-Ser-(Lys)4 (Pam3Cys) was from EMC microcollections (Tübingen, Germany). TLR3 was stimulated with Poly(I:C) (Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany), TLR7 with R-848 from InvivoGen (Toulouse, France), and TLR9 with the phospothioate-stabilized oligonucleotide CpG 1668 from TIB Molbiol (Berlin, Germany). Recombinant human LPS-binding protein and the recombinant soluble form of human CD14 were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The peptide SGPSNTPPEI was synthesized by N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) chemistry and kindly provided by Stefan Stevanovic (Tübingen, Germany). The following monoclonal antibodies were used for analyses by flow cytometry. Anti-mouse CD8-APC-Cy7, CD8-PerCP, CD25-PE-Cy7, CD44-APC, CD11c-APC, CD14-FITC, CD80-FITC, CD86-PE, and CD40-FITC were obtained from Pharmingen. Anti-mouse IFN-γ-APC was from Immunotools (Friesoythe, Germany). Mice—C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice were obtained from the local animal facility of the University of Mainz. TLR2−/− mice, generated by Tularik, Inc. (South San Francisco, CA), were provided by Hermann Wagner (Technical University, Munich, Germany). TLR4-defective BALB/c mice, which express the LPSd allele from the LPS hyporesponsive strain C3H/HeJ (30Takakuwa T. Knopf H.P. Sing A. Carsetti R. Galanos C. Freudenberg M.A. Eur. J.

St35 mice (C57BL/6 background) are transgenic for a T cell receptor recognizing the peptide SGPSNTPPEI (SGP) from the adenovirus Ad5 E1a protein (amino acids 234–243), presented on H2-Db. They were cross-bred with B6.SJL-ptprca/BoCrTac(KO)RAG2 N10 (RAG2−/−, Ly5.1) (Taconic, Germantown, MD) to yield RAG2−/− knock-out mice. All animal procedures were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the University of Mainz.

Contaminating red blood cells were removed by a hypotonic lysis step (150 mm ammonium chloride, 1 mm potassium bicarbonate, 0.1 mm ethylene diamine tetra acetate (all from Sigma) in distilled water, pH 7.3).

Minor modification included full replacement of culture medium containing GM-CSF (200 units/ml) on day 2 (removal of non-adherent cells); on day 4, about 75% of medium/GM-CSF (200 units/ml) was replaced. Culture medium was Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Cambrex, East Rutherford, NJ) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. On day 6, DCs were considered immature by FACS analysis (CD11c+, CD14−, CD40low, CD80low, CD86low). The macrophage-like cells RAW309 were kept in RPMI 1640 (Cambrex) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and antibiotics. For harvest, the medium was removed, and cells were incubated for 5–10 min at 4 °C in ice-cold Versene (1:5000; Invitrogen). Stimulation of Cells—After 6 days of GM-CSF-mediated differentiation, mouse BMDCs, human PMN, or the macrophage-like cells RAW309, respectively, were seeded out in 96-well culture plates for activation. Cells were incubated with 20 μg/ml Gp96, 10 μg/ml N-terminal domain Gp96 in triplicate wells. To enhance the binding of TLR ligands to Gp96, a preincubation was performed for 1 h at 37°C before adding them to the cultures. After 16–20 h of activation, supernatants were collected for analyses. Cells were fed and used for FACS analysis 48 h after stimulation. Detection of Cytokines—Cytokines were measured in the cell culture supernatant by standard ELISA protocols or by the Luminex detection system. The Multicytokine Beadlite kits were purchased from Biomol, Hamburg, Germany and produced by Upstate Biotechnology (Charlottesville, VA). They were used according to the manufacturer's protocol. IL-8 production by human PMN was assessed by ELISA (R&D Systems, Wiesbaden, Germany). For analyses of mouse cytokines by ELISA, all antibodies and recombinant standards were from Pharmingen. The capture antibody was bound onto the Maxisorb (NUNC, Roskilde, Denmark) assay plate overnight at 4 °C. The amount of biotinylated detection antibody was determined using streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase, an enzyme that interacts with the 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine liquid substrate (Sigma). After stopping of the reaction with 2 m H2SO4, the assay was read out at an absorbance of 450 nm using the SpectraFluorPlus reader from Tecan (Crailsheim, Germany). Stimulation of T Cell Receptor Transgenic CD8+T Cells in Vitro—Day 6 GM-CSF differentiated immature BMDCs were activated with 25 μg/ml Gp96, 1 ng/ml LPS, 10 ng/ml Pam3Cys, Gp96/LPS, Gp96/Pam3Cys in 24-well plates for 12 h. Preincubation of stimuli was as described above; the concentration was equal to the single stimuli. 100 pm SGP peptide (H2-Db-restricted Ad5-E1a234–243) was loaded onto the DCs for 1 h at 37°Cand then washed off cautiously but extensively. T cell receptor transgenic T cells from the spleen of a St35 RAG2−/− were labeled with 2.5 μm carboxyfluorescein diacetate succimide ester (CFSE; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 4 min at 37 °C in the dark. The DC:T cell co-culture was performed in 48-well plates at a ratio of 1:60. After 2 and 3 days, the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Expression of surface activation markers (CD25, CD62L, CD44) was analyzed on viable (propidium iodide-negative) and CD8-positive cells. In a separate staining reaction from the identical sample, intracellular IFN-γ production was determined. In both assays, the T cells were CFSE-labeled to monitor cell division. To measure the cytokine intracellularly, the cells were restimulated with 1 nm peptide plus 1 μg/ml brefeldin A (Sigma) to prevent secretion for 4 h. After CD8-PerCP staining of the surface, the cells were washed and incubated in Cytofix/Cytoperm solution (Pharmingen) for 30 min. Washing and intracellular staining (IFN-γ-APC) steps thereafter were in 0.1% Saponin (Sigma)/0.5% bovine serum albumin (Roth) buffer. FACS Analysis—We performed all flow cytometric analyses with a FACSCanto flow cytometer and FACSDiva software (Pharmingen). Gp96 has been demonstrated to directly activate BMDC cell function (12Basu S. Binder R.J. Ramalingam T. Srivastava P.K. Immunity. 2001; 14: 303-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar, 18Binder R.J. Anderson K.M. Basu S. Srivastava P.K. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 6029-6035Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In more recent studies, it was reported that this activity was lost following rigorous reduction of contaminating LPS levels (28Reed R.C. Berwin B. Baker J.P. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31853-31860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Enigmatically, LPS concentrations corresponding to those found in activating HSP preparations were also not sufficient for BMDC activation (29Radsak M.P. Hilf N. Singh-Jasuja H. Braedel S. Brossart P. Rammensee H.G. Schild H. Blood. 2003; 101: 2810-2815Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for these apparently conflicting observations is that LPS and Gp96 associate with one another and that this interaction acts synergistically to enhance the BMDC response to LPS. As Gp96 has been demonstrated to function as an LPS-binding protein (28Reed R.C. Berwin B. Baker J.P. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31853-31860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), we determined whether such interactions influence the cellular response to LPS. Titration experiments were performed to establish the range of Gp96 and LPS concentrations necessary to elicit production of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-12 to allow the detection of a Gp96-mediated amplification. As shown in Fig. 1, titrated amounts of Gp96 mediated activation of mouse BMDCs in a concentration-dependent manner at high concentrations (>50 μg/ml), shown by the production of IL-6 and the chemokines RANTES and KC (A) as well as by the production of low amounts of IL-10 (B). This was also true for the production of MCP-1 and RANTES by the macrophage cell line RAW309 and for the release of IL-8 by human neutrophils (data not shown). At lower concentrations (<25 μg/ml), however, the activating effects of Gp96 on either cell type were negligible. We performed similar titrations for LPS, focusing our further experiments on the effects on BMDCs since this cell type is crucially involved in bridging innate and adaptive immune responses. Here, maximal activation was still observed at LPS concentrations of 1 ng/ml (Fig. 1C). Further reducing the amount of LPS resulted in reduced levels of IL-6 production, and at about 0.25 ng/ml, no IL-6 production was detected anymore. The same was observed for the production of IL-12 p40. Now, using LPS and Gp96 at concentrations unable to induce DC activation alone (0.25 ng/ml for LPS and 25 μg/ml for Gp96, respectively), an increase in IL-6 and IL-12 p40 production was detectable when both stimuli were combined (Fig. 2A). However, after preincubation of LPS with Gp96 for 1 h at 37°C, a significant enhancement of the IL-6 or IL-12 production became evident (A, LPS + Gp96 preincubated). This was accompanied by the up-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules CD86 and CD40 (Fig. 2B) and also by the release of RANTES and KC, whereas the production of IL-10 was not enhanced. To investigate this observation in more detail, we preincubated titrated amounts of LPS with constant amounts of Gp96 and stimulated BMDCs. As depicted in Fig. 3, we observed a concentration-dependent IL-6 production that was now already detectable at 50 pg/ml of LPS in the presence of Gp96 (A). The same behavior was found for the production of IL-12 p40 (B) and IL-12 p70 (C). Here, a considerable enhancement was even visible at an LPS concentration of 1 ng/ml. Interestingly, the enhancing effect of Gp96 was also observed for the chemokines RANTES and KC but not for the production of IL-10. Having observed the amplification of LPS-mediated DC activation, we determined whether Gp96 could augment the response to other TLR ligands. Therefore, we incubated BMDCs with different TLR ligands at concentrations that induce only a weak activation of BMDCs as indicated by the production of low amounts of proinflammatory cytokines and expression of co-stimulatory molecules. The experiment was performed in the presence or absence of constant amounts of Gp96. As depicted in Fig. 4, among the different TLR ligands tested, only the TLR2 agonist Pam3Cys mediated a significant enhancement of the production of IL-12 p40 (A) and IL-12 p70 (B) in the presence of Gp96 (indicated by brackets). The same was found for IL-6 (data not shown). These results were paralleled b"
https://openalex.org/W2137825653,"The purpose of the current study was to examine the binding of pulmonary surfactant protein A (SP-A) to TLR4 and MD-2, which are critical signaling receptors for lipopolysaccharides (LPSs). The direct binding of SP-A to the recombinant soluble form of extracellular TLR4 domain (sTLR4) and MD-2 was detected using solid-phase binding, immunoprecipitation, and BIAcore. SP-A bound to sTLR4 and MD-2 in a Ca2+-dependent manner, and an anti-SP-A monoclonal antibody whose epitope lies in the region Thr184–Gly194 blocked the SP-A binding to sTLR4 and MD-2, indicating the involvement of the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) in the binding. SP-A avidly bound to the deglycosylated forms of sTLR4 and MD-2, suggesting a protein/protein interaction. In addition, SP-A attenuated cell surface binding of smooth LPS and smooth LPS-induced NF-κB activation in TLR4/MD-2-expressing cells. To know the role of oligomerization in the interaction of SP-A with TLR4 and MD-2, the collagenase-resistant fragment (CRF), which consisted of CRD plus neck domain of SP-A, was isolated. CRF assembled as a trimer, whereas SP-A assembled as a higher order oligomer. Although CRD was suggested to be involved in the binding, CRF exhibited approximately 600- and 155-fold higher KD for the binding to TLR4 and MD-2, respectively, when compared with SP-A. Consistently significantly higher molar concentrations of CRF were required to inhibit smooth LPS-induced NF-κB activation and tumor necrosis factor-α secretion. These results demonstrate for the first time the direct interaction between SP-A and TLR4/MD-2 and suggest the importance of supratrimeric oligomerization in the immunomodulatory function of SP-A.

Stimulation of different TLRs induces distinct patterns of gene expression, which leads to the activation of innate immunity and instructs the development of antigen-specific acquired immunity (2Akira S. Takada H. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6618) Google Scholar). Among the TLR family, TLR4 plays a critical role in recognition and signaling of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (3Chow J.C. Young D.W. Golenbock D.T. Christ W.J. Gusovsky F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10689-10692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar). TLR4 requires accessory protein MD-2 for an efficient response to LPS (4Shimazu R. Akahsi S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 38044-38051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but LPS has been demonstrated to be cross-linked with TLR4 and MD-2 only when coexpressed with CD14 (8da Silva Correia J.

The lung is constantly challenged by inhaled pathogens, pollutants, and particles that are present in the environment. Pulmonary surfactant, a mixture of lipids and proteins that serves to reduce the surface tension of the alveoli, is involved in the innate immune system of the lung. Recent studies demonstrate that the most abundant component of surfactant protein, surfactant protein A (SP-A), plays important roles in pathogen clearance and inflammatory responses (9Wright J.R. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 58-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 10Sano H. Kuroki Y. Mol. Immunol. 2005; 42: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 11McCormack F.X.

Physiol. 2001; 63: 521-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). SP-A belongs to the collectin subgroup of the C-type lectin superfamily along with surfactant protein D (SP-D) and mannose-binding lectin. The primary structure of SP-A subunits are composed of a short amino-terminal segment, a collagen-like sequence characterized by Gly-X-Y repeats with an interruption near the midpoint of the domain, a neck domain, and a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) (13Kuroki Y. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25943-25946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Trimeric association occurs by the folding of collagenous domains into triple helices (14King R.J. Simon D. Horowitz P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1001: 294-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and coiled-coil bundling of α-helices in the neck (15Hoppe H.J. Barlow P.N. Reid K.B. FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Fully assembled SP-A is a bouquet-like octadecamer consisting of six trimeric subunits that are stabilized by the amino-terminal sequences and disulfide bonds (16Voss T. Eistetter H. Scheirle K.P. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 201: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar).

Xiao Y.Q. Dickinson M. Green K.E. Henson P.M. Cell. 2003; 115: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Although it has been suggested that SP-A activates cellular responses dependent on TLR4 (21Guillot L. Balloy V. McCormack F.X. Golenbock D.T. Chignard M. Si-Tahar M. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5989-5992Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), the interactions of SP-A with TLR4 or MD-2 have not been examined yet. The objectives of this study were to investigate the direct binding of SP-A to TLR4 and MD-2 and to clarify the structural requirement of SP-A for the interactions with TLR4/MD-2 and regulation of TLR4-dependent inflammatory responses. We show that SP-A binds to TLR4 and MD-2 via CRD and prevents LPS-induced signaling. The trimeric assembly consisting of CRD plus neck domain reveals specific but insufficient activities against TLR4 and MD-2, suggesting the importance of oligomerization for anti-inflammatory effects of SP-A. Materials—The macrophage-like cell line U937 (JCRB9021) was obtained from the Health Science Research Resources Bank (Osaka, Japan) and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells (CRL-1573) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. LPSs (Escherichia coli O26:B6 and Salmonella minnesota Re595) were purchased from Sigma. Monoclonal antibody PE10 against human SP-A was prepared as described previously (22Kuroki Y. Fukada Y. Takahashi H. Akino T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 836: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Anti-V5 monoclonal antibody was purchased from Invitrogen. SP-A—Native human SP-A (hSP-A) derived from bronchoalveolar lavage fluids of patients with alveolar proteinosis was purified by affinity chromatography on mannose-Sepharose 6B followed by gel filtration as described previously (23Kuroki Y. Tsutahara S. Shijubo N. Takahashi H. Shiratori M. Hattori A. Honda Y. Abe S. Akino T. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1993; 147: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The wild type recombinant human SP-A (wtSP-A) was expressed in CHO-K1 cells. A 1.13-kb cDNA for human SP-A1 in pVL1392 vector (24Tsunezawa W. Sano H. Sohma H. McCormack F.X. Voelker D.R. Kuroki Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1387: 433-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) was digested and subcloned into pEE14 plasmid vector. The SP-A cDNA in pEE14 vector was transfected into CHO-K1 cells by using Lipofectamine and PLUS reagent (Invitrogen). CHO-K1 cells expressing SP-A were grown in glutamate-free Glasgow minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% heat-inactivated and dialyzed fetal calf serum and 50 μm methionine sulfoximine for gene amplification. For protein purification, cells were transferred to serum-free EXCELL 302 medium (JRH Bioscience, Lenexa, KS) and incubated for 3 days. The medium was collected, and four additional harvests were performed, allowing 24–48 h of culture between harvests. The medium was finally filtered with a 0.45-μm filter, adjusted to 2 mm CaCl2, and applied to a mannose-Sepharose column. The proteins were eluted with 5 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 5 mm EDTA and dialyzed against 5 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4). The mutated human SP-A (SP-AE195Q,A197D) in which Glu195 and Ala197 of hSP-A were replaced with Gln and Asp, respectively, was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange mutagenesis kit, Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX) using wtSP-A cDNA in pEE14 vector as a template. The mutant SP-AE195Q,A197D was expressed in CHO-K1 cells as described above. Collagenase Treatment of hSP-A—The collagenase digestion of hSP-A was performed as described previously (25Murata Y. Kuroki Y. Akino T. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). hSP-A was incubated with collagenase III from Clostridium histolyticum at 37 °C for 22 h. The collagenase-resistant fragment (CRF) was isolated by gel filtration using HighLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 prep grade (Amersham Biosciences). Endotoxin Removal—Endotoxin was removed from SP-A or CRF preparations using polymyxin B-agarose (Sigma) as described elsewhere (26McIntosh J.C. Mervin-Blake S. Conner E. Wright J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: L310-L319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The endotoxin content in hSP-A or CRF preparations was below 2.7 pg/μg of protein as determined by Limulus amebocyte lysate assay. TLR4 and MD-2—Expression and purification of a soluble form of recombinant extracellular domain of TLR4 (sTLR4) and recombinant MD-2 have been described recently (5Hyakushima N. Mitsuzawa H. Nishitani C. Sano H. Kuronuma K. Konishi M. Himi T. Miyake K. Kuroki Y. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 6949-6954Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). sTLR4 consists of the extracellular domain of Glu24–Lys631 and a His6 tag at the carboxyl-terminal end. MD-2 contains the carboxyl-terminal fusion V5 tag and a His6 tag. The proteins were expressed by a baculovirus-insect cell expression system and purified from the medium using a column of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). TLR4 peptide (TLR4E24–K47) and TLR2 peptide (TLR2E21–S45) were purchased from Invitrogen. These peptides consist of amino-terminal regions of TLR4 or TLR2 and do not involve leucine-rich repeats. The sequence of TLR4E24–K47 and TLR2E21–S45 is ESWEPCVEVVPNITYQCMELNFYK and ESSNQASLSCDRNGICKGSSGSLNS, respectively. Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis—Four micrograms of recombinant MD-2 were resolved by 13% SDS-PAGE under non-reducing or reducing (1% β-mercaptoethanol) conditions and visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. For native conditions, 15 μg of MD-2 were subjected to a NativePAGE™ Novex® 4–16% bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen). Binding Assay with Microtiter Wells—sTLR4, MD-2, or BSA (500 ng/well) was coated onto microtiter wells, and nonspecific binding was blocked with 10 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 5 mg/ml BSA (buffer A). The indicated concentrations of SP-A or CRF in buffer A were added and incubated at 37 °C for 5 h. After washing the wells, the wells were incubated with anti-human SP-A polyclonal antibody followed by the incubation with HRP-labeled anti-rabbit IgG. For the detection of the binding of biotinylated SP-A or CRF, HRP-conjugated streptavidin was used instead of the antibodies. The peroxidase reaction was finally conducted by using o-phenylenediamine as a substrate, and the absorbance at 492 nm was measured. When needed, wtSP-A was preincubated at 37 °C for 1 h with either anti-hSP-A monoclonal antibody PE10 or control antibody 6B2 before adding to the wells. To eliminate the effect of Ca2+ on the binding, 5 mm EDTA was included in buffer A instead of CaCl2 in some experiments. Binding Assay in Solution—wtSP-A (2 μg) was incubated with 2 μg of either sTLR4 or MD-2 at 37 °C for 2 h in 20 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 3 mg/ml BSA. The mixture was then incubated with 1 μg of anti-sTLR4 mAb 4D9 or anti-V5 mAb at 4 °C for 2 h, and immune complexes were precipitated with protein G-Sepharose (40 μl) by gentle shaking at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were washed three times with 20 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and resuspended in SDS sample buffer. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE after boiling for 5 min under reducing conditions and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was immunoprobed with anti-human SP-A polyclonal antibody followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. The proteins that reacted with the antibodies were finally visualized by using a chemiluminescence reagent (SuperSignal, Pierce). BIAcore Method—BIAcore 3000 (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) was used to assess the interactions of hSP-A with sTLR4 or MD-2. Native hSP-A (50 μg/ml) in 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.0) was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip using an amine coupling method. TLR4 or MD-2 in 5 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.15 m NaCl and 5 mm CaCl2 was passed over the surface of the sensor chip, and the interactions were monitored for 2 min. The sensor surface was then washed with the same buffer to start the dissociation, and the chip was finally regenerated with 10 mm EDTA at the end of each experiment. The association rate constant (Ka) and the dissociation rate constant (Kd) were calculated according to the BIAevaluation software (Version 3.1, BIAcore AB) using a program named 1:1 (Langmuir) binding model. The dissociation constant (KD) was determined by Kd/Ka. Ligand Blot Analysis—For deglycosylation, sTLR4 and MD-2 (2 μg) were incubated with 1 unit of N-glycosidase F (Roche Diagnostics) at 37 °C for 2 h in 10 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 10 mm EDTA, 2% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, and 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40. The removal of oligosaccharides was confirmed by a carbohydrate detection kit (G. P. Sensor, J-Oil Mills, Yokohama, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For ligand blot analysis, sTLR4, MD-2, deglycosylated sTLR4, and deglycosylated MD-2 were electrophoresed under reducing conditions and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After nonspecific binding was blocked with 20 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 5 mg/ml BSA, and 1% (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone, the membranes were incubated with wtSP-A or BSA (2 μg/ml) for 17 h. The membranes were then incubated with anti-human SP-A polyclonal antibody followed by HRP-labeled anti-rabbit IgG. The binding of SP-A to sTLR4 or MD-2 was detected by using diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride as a substrate. Gel Filtration—The molecular masses of hSP-A and CRF were determined by gel filtration chromatography. Analysis was performed using a 1.8 × 77-cm column of 8% agarose beads (Iberagar, Coina, Portugal) in 5 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 2 mm CaCl2 at 4 °C. Elution was monitored at an absorbance of 280 nm. Blue dextran, BSA, and chymotrypsinogen A were used as molecular mass standards. LPS Binding to TLR4/MD-2-expressing Cells—HEK293 cells stably expressing TLR4 and MD-2 (293-hTLR4/MD2-CD14) (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA) were maintained in growth medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml blasticidin and 50 μg/ml hygromycin B. Adherent cells were collected, and one million cells/tube were preincubated in the absence or presence of 10 μg/ml hSP-A at 37 °C for 30 min. The cells were then further incubated with 1 μg/ml Alexa488-labeled smooth LPS (E. coli O55:B5, the molecular mass is ∼10,000 Da) or Alexa488-labeled rough LPS (S. minnesota, the molecular mass is ∼3000 Da) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at 4 °C for 30 min. After washing the cells three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mg/ml BSA, cell-associated fluorescence was determined by using FACSCalibur and CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Anti-hSP-A polyclonal antibody (100 μg/ml) was added to hSP-A preparations 10 min before incubating with the cells. NF-κB Reporter Assay—HEK293 cells were plated at 1 × 105/well on 24-well plates on the day before transfection. The cells were transiently transfected by FuGENE™ 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) with 50 ng of sTLR4 cDNA and 10 ng of MD-2 cDNA together with 30 ng of NF-κB reporter construct (pNF-kB-Luc, Stratagene) and 3.5 ng of a construct directing expression of Renilla luciferase (pRL-TK, Promega, Madison, WI). Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml either smooth (O26:B6) or rough (Re595) LPS for 5 h in the absence or presence of hSP-A or CRF, which had been preincubated with the cells for 1 h before adding LPS to the wells. Luciferase activity was measured by dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. TNF-α Assay—U937 cells (2.5 × 105/well) were placed on 24-well plates and induced to differentiate by incubation with 10 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for 24 h. The cells were further incubated in the absence of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for 24 h. After the cells were preincubated with the indicated concentrations of hSP-A or CRF for 1 h, the cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml LPS for 5 h in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. The culture medium was then collected, and TNF-α secretion was measured using a human TNF enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay set (BD Biosciences). Other Methods—Polyclonal antibody against human SP-A was raised in rabbits against purified recombinant human SP-A. The biotinylation of hSP-A and CRF was performed as described previously (17Sano H. Chiba H. Iwaki D. Sohma H. Voelker D.R. Kuroki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22442-22451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Significance was determined using two-tailed Student's t test. Analysis of the State of Recombinant MD-2—MD-2 is a 20–30-kDa glycoprotein that contains a leader sequence but lacks a transmembrane domain. Although some of the MD-2 molecules remain attached to the extracellular domain of TLR4, the rest is secreted into the extracellular fluids as monomers and large disulfide-linked oligomers (27Visintin A. Mazzoni A. Spitzer J.A. Segal D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12156-12161Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). To assess the state of recombinant MD-2 expressed by a baculovirus-insect cell expression system, electrophoresis was performed under denaturing and non-denaturing conditions. As seen in Fig. 1A, recombinant MD-2 in the presence of SDS migrated mainly as monomers of 25 kDa under reducing and non-reducing conditions, although dimeric forms of an apparent molecular mass of 45 kDa were also detected in the unreduced state. When analyzed by non-denaturing native PAGE, recombinant MD-2 consisted of larger oligomers (band between 66 and 360 kDa) and species of ∼59 and 28 kDa, corresponding to dimers and monomers (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that our preparation of MD-2 contained oligomers and monomers under the native conditions. Previous studies demonstrated larger oligomers of recombinant MD-2 resolved by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions (28Re F. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23427-23432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 29Mullen G.E.D. Kennedy M.N. Visintin A. Mazzoni A. Leifer C.A. Davis D.R. Segal D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3919-3924Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), but the inconsistency may be due to the different expression system. Although the relevance of large oligomers of MD-2 for LPS signaling is still controversial (28Re F. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23427-23432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 29Mullen G.E.D. Kennedy M.N. Visintin A. Mazzoni A. Leifer C.A. Davis D.R. Segal D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3919-3924Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), we have tested that our preparation actively confers LPS responsiveness to TLR4-transfected cells (5Hyakushima N. Mitsuzawa H. Nishitani C. Sano H. Kuronuma K. Konishi M. Himi T. Miyake K. Kuroki Y. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 6949-6954Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Binding of SP-A to TLR4 and MD-2—We first investigated direct interactions of SP-A with purified sTLR4 or MD-2 coated onto microtiter wells. In the presence of Ca2+, wtSP-A clearly bound to solid-phase sTLR4 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2A), indicating that SP-A interacted with the extracellular domain of TLR4. Likewise when MD-2 was coated onto the wells, wtSP-A avidly bound to MD-2 in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 2B). The interactions of SP-A with sTLR4 and MD-2 were also examined by a solution-phase assay. When wtSP-A and sTLR4 were coincubated, wtSP-A was associated with sTLR4 that was immunoprecipitated with anti-sTLR4 antibody (Fig. 2C, upper panel). Similarly wtSP-A was clearly coprecipitated with MD-2 (Fig. 2C, lower panel). The results demonstrate the direct binding of SP-A to sTLR4 and MD-2 in the solution phase. We further determined the binding parameters by surface plasmon resonance analysis (Fig. 3). When various concentrations of sTLR4 were overlaid to hSP-A immobilized on a sensor chip, an association rate constant of Ka = 1.89 × 104 m−1 s−1 and a dissociation rate constant of Kd = 3.7 × 10−4 s−1 were disclosed. The passage of MD-2 over immobilized hSP-A yielded an association rate constant of Ka = 9.58 × 103 m−1 s−1 and a dissociation rate constant of Kd = 3.13 × 10−4 s−1. The consequent dissociation constant of KD (Kd/Ka) was 1.96 × 10−8 m, or 3.28 × 10−8 m, for sTLR4/SP-A interaction or MD-2/SP-A interaction, respectively. These data, calculated based on the monomeric molecular mass of sTLR4 or MD-2, indicate the high affinity interactions of SP-A with sTLR4 and MD-2. Taking into account the presence of larger oligomers of MD-2 (Fig. 1B), the actual KD for SP-A/MD-2 interaction may be much lower than the calculated KD, suggesting the higher binding affinity between the proteins.FIGURE 3Association and dissociation of sTLR4 and MD-2 with the immobilized SP-A. The parameters of bindings for sTLR4 (A) or MD-2 (B) with hSP-A were determined by surface plasmon resonance analysis (BIA-core) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Sensograms for the bindings of various concentrations of sTLR4 or MD-2 to hSP-A immobilized on a sensor chip are shown. RU, response units.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Properties of SP-A Binding to TLR4 and MD-2—Because SP-A belongs to a C-type lectin family, it recognizes various ligands via CRD in a Ca2+-dependent manner. For the purpose of clarifying the binding properties of SP-A with the pattern recognition receptors, we next examined the binding of SP-A to TLR4 and MD-2 in the presence of EDTA or excess mannose (Fig. 2, A and B). Inclusion of 5 mm EDTA instead of CaCl2 in the binding buffer almost completely abolished the binding of wtSP-A to solid-phase sTLR4 or MD-2. On the other hand, the association of wtSP-A with sTLR4 or MD-2 was partially attenuated by the presence of 0.2 m mannose. As much as 0.2 m mannose induced a 50–60% reduction in the binding of wtSP-A to sTLR4 or MD-2. These results suggest that SP-A associates with sTLR4 and MD-2 in a Ca2+-dependent manner and raised a possibility that CRD is involved in the interactions of SP-A with these pattern recognition receptors. To determine the role of SP-A CRD in the binding to TLR4 and MD-2, a solid-phase binding assay was performed in the presence of anti-SP-A monoclonal antibody, whose epitopes are located in SP-A CRD. When wtSP-A was preincubated with monoclonal antibody PE10 before adding to the wells, wtSP-A failed to recognize sTLR4 (Fig. 4A) or MD-2 (Fig. 4B) coated onto the wells. In contrast, control antibody 6B2 did not alter the binding ability of wtSP-A to either sTLR4 or MD-2. Because monoclonal antibody PE10 recognizes Thr184–Gly194 regions of SP-A CRD (30Chiba H. Sano H. Saitoh M. Sohma H. Voelker D.R. Akino T. Kuroki Y. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7321-7331Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), Thr184–Gly194 of SP-A may be the critical region required for the binding of SP-A to TLR4 and MD-2. The replacement of Glu195 by Gln and Arg197 by Asp in rat SP-A results in altered carbohydrate binding specificity of the CRD of SP-A (31McCormack F.X. Kuroki Y. Stewart J.J. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29801-29807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We generated hSP-A mutant SP-AE195Q,A197D in which substitutions of Gln for Glu195 and Asp for Ala197 were introduced based upon the corresponding regions of rat SP-A. The binding of SP-AE195Q,A197D to sTLR4 or MD-2 was then examined, and it was found that SP-AE195Q,A197D avidly bound to sTLR4 (Fig. 4C) and MD-2 (Fig. 4D) to the same extent as wtSP-A. The results suggest that the carbohydrate binding specificity of SP-A may not be necessary for sTLR4 or MD-2 recognition. Taking all these results into account, we conclude that SP-A interacts with sTLR4 and MD-2 via CRD in a Ca2+-dependent manner, but the lectin property of SP-A may not be involved in the recognition of sTLR4 and MD-2.

https://openalex.org/W2077053514,"The α-conotoxin Vc1.1 is a small disulfide-bonded peptide currently in development as a treatment for neuropathic pain. This study describes the synthesis, determination of the disulfide connectivity, and the determination of the three-dimensional structure of Vc1.1 using NMR spectroscopy. Vc1.1 was shown to inhibit nicotine-evoked membrane currents in isolated bovine chromaffin cells in a concentration-dependent manner and preferentially targets peripheral nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subtypes over central subtypes. Specifically, Vc1.1 is selective for α3-containing nAChR subtypes. The three-dimensional structure of Vc1.1 comprises a small α-helix spanning residues Pro6 to Asp11 and is braced by the I-III, II-IV disulfide connectivity seen in other α-conotoxins. A comparison of the structure of Vc1.1 with other α-conotoxins, taken together with nAChR selectivity data, suggests that the conserved proline at position 6 is important for binding, whereas a number of residues in the C-terminal portion of the peptide contribute toward the selectivity. The structure reported here should open new opportunities for further development of Vc1.1 or analogues as analgesic agents.

Conotoxins are peptide toxins, ranging in size from 12 to 30 amino acids, isolated from the venom of snails from the Conus genus (1Terlau H. Olivera B.M. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 41-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). Members of this peptide family target a range of membrane receptors with both high potency and selectivity and as a consequence are useful as neuropharmacological probes and have a range of potential pharmaceutical applications. The α-conotoxins are a subfamily of conotoxins that typically range in size from 12 to 16 amino acids, which contain two disulfide bonds in a I-III, II-IV connectivity and have an amidated C terminus. The α-conotoxins interact with both muscle and neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), 3The abbreviations used are: nAChR, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; ACh, acetylcholine; DQF-COSY, double quantum filtered correlated spectroscopy; RP-HPLC, reversed-phase-high performance liquid chromatography; IC50, half-maximal inhibitory concentration; MS, mass spectrometry; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; ES-MS, electrospray-mass spectrometry; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; MES, 2-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation.3The abbreviations used are: nAChR, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; ACh, acetylcholine; DQF-COSY, double quantum filtered correlated spectroscopy; RP-HPLC, reversed-phase-high performance liquid chromatography; IC50, half-maximal inhibitory concentration; MS, mass spectrometry; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; ES-MS, electrospray-mass spectrometry; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; MES, 2-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. which have been implicated in a range of disorders, including Alzheimer disease, schizophrenia, depression, and small cell lung carcinoma, and they play a role in analgesia and addiction (2McIntosh J.M.

Curr. Med. Chem. 2004; 11: 1715-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Selected α-conotoxin examples are shown below in Fig. 1. The α-conotoxin Vc1.1 was first discovered using a PCR screen of cDNAs from the venom ducts of Conus victoriae (6Sandall D.W. Satkunanathan N. Keays D.A. Polidano M.A. Liping X. Pham V. Down J.G. Khalil Z. Livett B.G. Gayler K.R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6904-6911Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The cysteine spacing within the sequence of Vc1.1 suggests that it is a member of the 4/7 subclass of α-conotoxins, which includes the extensively studied conotoxins MII, EpI and PnIB, although the actual disulfide connectivity of Vc1.1 has yet to be reported. In addition to an amidated C terminus, which is common to all α-conotoxins, Pro6 and Glu14 in Vc1.1 are post-translationally modified to hydroxyproline and γ-carboxyglutamate, respectively. The post-translationally modified peptide, designated vc1a, was recently identified in the venom of C. victoriae using MS analysis (7Jakubowski J.A. Keays D.A. Kelley W.P. Sandall D.W. Bingham J.P. Livett B.G. Gayler K.R. Sweedler J.V. J. Mass Spectrom. 2004; 39: 548-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Synthetic Vc1.1, an antagonist of neuronal nAChRs in bovine chromaffin cells, has been shown to alleviate neuropathic pain in three rat models of human neuropathic pain and to accelerate the functional recovery of injured neurons (8Satkunanathan N. Livett B. Gayler K. Sandall D. Down J. Khalil Z. Brain Res. 2005; 1059: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). As an analgesic, Vc1.1 has been reported be more active than ω-conotoxin MVIIA, a conotoxin that has recently been approved as a treatment for intractable pain (6Sandall D.W. Satkunanathan N. Keays D.A. Polidano M.A. Liping X. Pham V. Down J.G. Khalil Z. Livett B.G. Gayler K.R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6904-6911Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). More recently, Vc1.1 was shown to antagonize the nicotine-induced increase in axonal excitability of unmyelinated C-fiber axons in isolated segments of peripheral human nerves (9Lang P.M. Burgstahler R. Haberberger R.V. Sippel W. Grafe P. Neuroreport. 2005; 16: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Electrophysiological and immunohistochemical data indicate the functional expression of nAChRs composed of α3, α5, and β4 but not α4, β2, or α7 subunits in axons of unmyelinated C fibers (9Lang P.M. Burgstahler R. Haberberger R.V. Sippel W. Grafe P. Neuroreport. 2005; 16: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 10Lang P.M. Burgstahler R. Sippel W. Irnich D. Schlotter-Weigel B. Grafe P. J. Neurophysiol. 2003; 90: 3295-3303Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Blockade of nAChRs on unmyelinated peripheral nerve fibers may have an analgesic effect on unmyelinated sympathetic and/or sensory axons. Interestingly, synthetic vc1a was reported to not inhibit the neuronal-type nicotinic response in chromaffin cells and was inactive in two rat neuropathic pain assays (7Jakubowski J.A. Keays D.A. Kelley W.P. Sandall D.W. Bingham J.P. Livett B.G. Gayler K.R. Sweedler J.V. J. Mass Spectrom. 2004; 39: 548-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Vc1.1 is now under development as a treatment for neuropathic pain (5Livett B.G. Gayler K.R. Khalil Z. Curr. Med. Chem. 2004; 11: 1715-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 11Gayler K.

Mag. 2005; 24: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) but neither a specific receptor target nor the structure has been reported. Herein, we report the three-dimensional structure of Vc1.1 in solution as determined by NMR spectroscopy and explicitly determine the disulfide connectivity via chemical reduction and MS analysis. In addition, we show that Vc1.1 selectively antagonizes peripherally expressed nAChRs subtypes over those typically expressed in the central nervous system. These findings provide an insight into the potential modes of action of this analgesic peptide. We also examined the structure and activity of two derivatives of Vc1.1, vc1a and [P6O]-Vc1.1, which contain the post-translationally modified residues hydroxyproline and γ-carboxyglutamic acid and compare them to our findings for Vc1.1. Peptide Synthesis and Oxidative Folding—Vc1.1, vc1a, and [P6O]-Vc1.1 were assembled on 4-methylbenzhydrylamine amide resin (Auspep) by manual solid-phase peptide synthesis using the in situ neutralization/O-benzotriazole-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate protocol for t-butoxycarbonyl chemistry (12Schnölzer M. Alewood P. Jones A. Alewood D. Kent S.B.H. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1992; 40: 180-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). Cleavage of the peptide from the resin was achieved using HF with p-cresol and p-thiocresol as scavengers (9:0.5:0.5 (v/v) HF:p-cresol:p-thiocresol). The reaction was allowed to proceed at −5 to 0 °C for 1.5 h. The HF was then removed under vacuum, and the peptide was precipitated with ether, filtered, dissolved in 50% acetonitrile containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid, and lyophilized. The crude peptides were purified by RP-HPLC on a Phenomenex C18 column using a gradient of 0-80% B (Buffer A: H2O/0.05% trifluoroacetic acid; Buffer B: 90% CH3CN/10% H2O/0.045% trifluoroacetic acid) in 80 min, and the eluant was monitored at 230 nm. These conditions were used in subsequent purification steps. Analytical RP-HPLC and ES-MS confirmed the purity and molecular mass of the synthesized peptides. The linear peptides were oxidized by dissolving in 0.1 m NH4HCO3 (pH 8.2) at a concentration of 0.3 mg/ml and stirring overnight at room temperature. The oxidized peptides were then purified by RP-HPLC, and the molecular weight was confirmed by ES-MS. Determination of Disulfide Connectivity—Peptide (50 μg) was dissolved in 50 μ l of 0.2 m sodium citrate (pH 3.0), and 50 μl of 20 mm tris-carboxyethylphosphine in citrate buffer was added. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 5 min before injection onto the RP-HPLC. The partially reduced peptide was collected, and an equal volume of 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide in citrate buffer was added immediately. The reaction mixture was then incubated at 60 °C for 1 h, and the resulting product was isolated by RP-HPLC and lyophilized. The peptide was then redissolved in citrate buffer and fully reduced with an excess of tris-carboxyethylphosphine, resulting in a peptide with two free cysteines and two alkylated cysteines. This peptide was then analyzed by MS/MS sequencing to identify the location of the alkylated cysteines in the sequence. NMR Spectroscopy—NMR data for Vc1.1, vc1a, and [P6O]-Vc1.1 were recorded on samples dissolved in 90% H2O/10% D2O at pH 3.5. Bruker ARX 500- and 600-MHz spectrometers were used in the acquisition of data. 2D NMR experiments included DQF-COSY, E-COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY, with all spectra recorded at 280 K. A series of 1D and TOCSY spectra acquired immediately following dissolution of fully protonated Vc1.1 in D2O were used in the determination of slow exchanging NH protons. All spectra were analyzed on Silicon Graphics Indigo workstations using XWINNMR 1.3 (Bruker) and Sparky software. Chemical shifts were referenced to 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane 5-sulfonate at 0 ppm. Structure Calculations on Vc1.1—Distance information for Vc1.1 was obtained from a NOESY spectrum with a mixing time of 200 ms at 280 K. Peak heights were used to determine distance restraints. Backbone dihedral restraints were determined from 3JHN-Hα coupling constants obtained from lineshape analysis of the anti-phase cross-signal splitting in a high digital resolution 2D DQF-COSY spectrum or from a 1D 1HNMR spectrum. The Φ angle was restrained to 120 ± 30° for 3JHN-Hα > 8Hzand-60 ± 30° for 3JHN-Hα < 5.8 Hz. Intraresidue NOE and 3JHα-Hβ coupling patterns were used in assigning χ1 angle restraints of some side chains. There were also 12 restraints included for 6 hydrogen bonds identified from D2O exchange data and preliminary structures. Initial structures were generated using Dyana software (13Guntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2537) Google Scholar), and the final structure calculations were performed using a simulated annealing protocol with CNS (14Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Rice L.M. Structure. 1997; 5: 325-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). This protocol involves a high temperature phase comprising 4000 steps of 0.015 ps of torsion angle dynamics, a cooling phase with 4000 steps of 0.015 ps of torsion angle dynamics during which the temperature is lowered to 0 K, and finally an energy minimization phase comprising 500 steps of Powell minimization. The resultant structures were subjected to further molecular dynamics and energy minimization in a water shell (15Linge J.P. Nilges M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The refinement in explicit water involved the following steps. First, heating to 500 K via steps of 100 K, each comprising 50 steps of 0.005 ps of Cartesian dynamics. Second, 2500 steps of 0.005 ps of Cartesian dynamics at 500 K before a cooling phase where the temperature is lowered in steps of 100 K, each comprising 2500 steps of 0.005 ps of Cartesian dynamics. Finally, the structures were minimized with 2000 steps of Powell minimization. Fifty structures were calculated, and the 20 with the lowest overall energies were retained for analysis. Structures were visualized using the program MOLMOL (16Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14 (51-55): 29-32Crossref Scopus (6454) Google Scholar) and analyzed with PROMOTIF (17Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M.

Electrophysiological Recordings from nAChRs in Bovine Adrenal Chromaffin Cells and Exogenously Expressed in Xenopus Oocytes—Chromaffin cells were prepared from bovine adrenal glands and maintained on glass coverslips in 24-well plates (Nunc) as previously described (19Lawrence G.W. Weller U. Dolly J.O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Electrodes (GF150F-7.5, Harvard Apparatus Ltd., Edenbridge, UK) were pulled, fire-polished, and had resistances of 2-3 MΩ when filled with intracellular solution (in mm: 140 CsCl, 2 CaCl2, 11 EGTA, 2 MgATP, 10 HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2). Agonists were diluted in bath solution (in mm: 140 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1.2 MgCl2, 2.5 CaCl2, 7.7 glucose, 10 HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.35) and were applied to cells by brief (10 ms) pressure ejection (15 p.s.i., Picospritzer II, General Valve, Fairfield, NJ) from an extracellular pipette positioned ∼50 μm from the cell to evoke maximal responses to agonists (20Fischer H. Liu D.M. Lee A. Harries J.C. Adams D.J. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 3571-3577Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Conotoxins were bath applied and co-applied with the agonist in the extracellular pipette. Membrane currents evoked by agonist application were amplified and low pass filtered (10 kHz) using an MultiClamp 700B patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments Inc., Union City, CA), and voltage steps were generated from a PC Pentium computer using pCLAMP 9.2 software and a Digidata 1322A interface (Axon Instruments Inc.). All experiments were carried out at room temperature (22 °C). RNA preparation, oocyte preparation, and expression of nAChR subunits in Xenopus oocytes were performed as described previously (21Hogg R.C. Hopping G. Alewood P.F. Adams D.J. Bertrand D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26908-26914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, plasmids with cDNA encoding the rat α1-α7, β1-4, γ, and δ nAChR subunits were provided by J. Patrick (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX) and subcloned into the oocyte expression vector pNKS2. All oocytes were injected with 5 ng of cRNA, except the α5- and α6-containing nAChRs in which 15-20 ng of each subunit was injected to aid expression and then kept at 18 °C in ND96 buffer (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2,1mm MgCl2,and 5 mm HEPES, at pH 7.4) supplemented with 50 mg/liter gentamycin and 5 mm pyruvic acid 2-5 days before recording. Membrane currents were recorded from Xenopus oocytes using an automated work station with eight channels in parallel, including drug delivery and on-line analysis (OpusXpress™ 6000A workstation, Axon Instruments Inc.). Both the voltage-recording and current-injecting electrodes were pulled from borosilicate glass (GC150T-15, Harvard Apparatus Ltd.) and had resistances of 0.3-1.5 MΩ when filled with 3 m KCl. All recordings were conducted at room temperature (20-23 °C) using a bath solution of ND96 as described above. HEPES (pKa 7.48) was replaced by MES (pKa 6.1) as the buffer in the bath solution for experiments carried out at pH 6.0. During recordings, the oocytes were perfused continuously at a rate of 1.5 ml/min, with 250-s incubation times for the conotoxin. Acetylcholine (100 μm) was applied for 2 s at 5 ml/min, with 600-s washout periods between applications. Cells were voltage-clamped at a holding potential of −80 mV. Data were sampled at 500 Hz and filtered at 200 Hz. Peak current amplitude was measured before and following incubation of the toxin. Statistics—All data represent arithmetic means ± S.E. Concentration-response curves for antagonists were fitted by unweighted non-linear regression to the logistic equation,Ex=EmaxXn/(Xn+IC50n)(Eq. 1) where Ex is the response, X is the antagonist concentration, Emax is the maximal response, n is the slope factor, and IC50 is the concentration of antagonist that gives 50% inhibition of the agonist response. Computation was done using SigmaPlot 8.0 (Jandel Corp.). The rate of onset and recovery from block during toxin washout were obtained from single exponential fits to the data using SigmaPlot 8.0. The Kd for the toxin was then calculated using Equation 2,Kd=koff/kon(Eq. 2) where koff = 1/τoff (s−1) and kon = (1/τon-koff)/[toxin]. The mechanisms of competitive antagonism were evaluated by means of the Schild regression (22Arunlakshana O. Schild H.O. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1959; 14: 48-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (4262) Google Scholar),log(x-1)=logKi-npAx(Eq. 3) where pAx is the negative logarithm of the concentration of the inhibitor, x is the shift of the concentration-response curve (dose ratio) caused by its presence, Ki is the dissociation constant of the inhibitor, and n is the slope factor. The regression line fitted to the data intersects the abscissa at a point corresponding to pA2, which in the case of n = 1 corresponds to Ki (22Arunlakshana O. Schild H.O. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1959; 14: 48-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (4262) Google Scholar). Peptide Synthesis and Oxidative Folding—The sequence of Vc1.1 is shown in Fig. 1. The post-translationally modified derivative of Vc1.1, vc1a, which is found in the venom, contains a hydroxyproline in position 6 and a γ-carboxyglutamic acid in position 14. To further define the roles of these modified residues a third peptide, [P6O]-Vc1.1, was made that contained a hydroxyproline in position 6 but retained the unmodified glutamic acid at position 14. Vc1.1, vc1a, and [P6O]-Vc1.1 were synthesized using t-butoxycarbonyl/in situ neutralization chemistry on 4-methylbenzhydrylamine amide resin. The overall yield of reduced peptides based on the initial starting resin was ∼30%. The oxidation profile of the peptides in 0.1 m NH4HCO3 buffer are shown in Fig. 2. All three peptides, Vc1.1, vc1a, and [P6O-Vc1.1, formed almost exclusively a single isomer with a monoisotopic molecular weights of 1809.7, 1866.6, and 1821.6, respectively, determined by ES-MS. Disulfide Mapping of Vc1.1—Vc1.1, vc1a, and [P6O]-Vc1.1 were partially reduced by incubating with tris-carboxyethylphosphine in citrate buffer at low pH. The reaction mixture was purified by RP-HPLC, and the one-disulfide species was alkylated with N-ethylmaleimide. The alkylated peptide was then fully reduced and analyzed by MS/MS. For all three peptides the MS/MS data clearly showed that C2 and C8 had been alkylated with N-ethylmaleimide. Fragmentation patterns from both ends of the peptide chain were observed and fully supported the proposed alkylation pattern. Therefore, it was concluded that the disulfide connectivity of Vc1.1, vc1a, and [P6O]-Vc1.1 was C2 to C8 and C3 to C16. This is consistent with the I-III, II-IV disulfide bonding pattern seen in other α-conotoxins. NMR Analysis—NH-NHi+1, Hα-NHi+1, and Hβ-NHi+1 connectivities obtained from the NOESY spectrum were used in the sequential assignment of the individual spin systems determined from the TOCSY spectrum. Sequential Hα-NHi+1 connectivities in all three peptides were observed for the entire peptide chain except at Pro6 and Pro13. Hα-Hδi+1 connectivities were utilized in the assignment of these proline residues and incidentally confirmed that the X-Pro bonds were in the trans configuration. Analysis of chemical shift data indicated that residues Cys2-Ser4, P/O6-Asp11, and Pro13-Cys16 all have a negative secondary shifts (Fig. 3a), indicating helical character. This is further supported by the small 3JαN coupling constants observed for Vc1.1 and the slow D2O exchange of the amide resonances for many of these residues (Fig. 3c). This predominance of helical character is characteristic of other α-conotoxin structures reported to date (4Dutton J.L. Craik D.J. Curr. Med. Chem. 2001; 8: 327-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 (a and b) illustrates the high degree of structural similarity between the three molecules. The secondary shifts are almost identical except for where there is a change in residue type at positions 6 and/or 14. This similarity in structure is reinforced by the fact the secondary shift for [P6O]-Vc1.1 matches vc1a at position 6 (as both share a hydroxyproline at this position) and matches Vc1.1 at position 14 (both Glu). A comparison of the chemical shift differences between the Hβ protons, shown in Fig. 3b, suggests that the sidechain orientations in each molecule are also very similar. Therefore, any differences in biological activity between the three peptides is most likely due to changes in the nature of the side chains rather than structural perturbations. Structure Determination of Vc1.1—The solution structure of Vc1.1 was determined by simulated annealing using experimental distance restraints based on NOESY cross-peaks and dihedral angle restraints based on coupling constants. The restraints comprised 21 dihedral angle and 92 distance restraints, which included 59 sequential, 28 medium range, and 5 long range NOEs. Fifty structures were calculated, and the 20 lowest energy structures were chosen as representatives of the solution structure of Vc1.1 as shown in Fig. 4a. A summary of the energetic and geometric statistics for the family of structures is given in Table 1. The structures are in excellent agreement with the experimental data, showing no distance violation >0.2 Å and no dihedral angle violation >2°.TABLE 1Energy and structural statistics for the family of 20 structures representing the solution structures of Vc1.1Energies (kcal/mol)Overall−623 ± 15Bond2.52 ± 0.34Angle15.4 ± 2.3Improper3.57 ± 0.70van der Waals−27.7 ± 4.3NOE3.55 ± 1.22cDih0.992 ± 0.267Dihedral54.5 ± 6.2Electrostatic−676 ± 20R.m.s.d.Bond (Å)0.003 ± 0.0002Angle (degrees)0.49 ± 0.04Improper (degrees)0.43 ± 0.04NOE0.025 ± 0.004cDih0.89 ± 0.12Pairwise r.m.s.d.0.32 ± 0.13Backbone/heavy (Å)1.32 ± 0.37Experimental dataDistance restraints92Dihedral restraints21NOE violations exceeding 0.20 Å0cDih violations exceeding 2.0°0RamachandranMost favored (%)91.7Additionally allowed (%)8.3 Open table in a new tab In general, the fold of Vc1.1, shown in Fig. 4, is consistent with that seen in other α-conotoxins. The main secondary structural element is an α-helix spanning residues Pro6 to Asp11. In addition, PROMOTIF (17Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar) recognizes a type I β-turn at the N terminus of the peptide for residues Cys2 to Ser4. In7 out of the 20 structures in the ensemble the 2-8 disulfide of Vc1.1 is defined as a right-hand hook conformation (χ2 +ve, χ3 +ve, χ2′-ve), and in the remaining structures (13 of 20) the conformation is not formally classified by PROMOTIF (χ2 +ve, χ3 -ve, χ2′-ve). In all 20 structures the 3-16 disulfide bond is in a lefthand spiral conformation. A comparison of the 2-8 disulfide bond in Vc1.1 with the crystal structures of [A10L,D14K]-PnIA and ImI in complex with the acetylcholine-binding protein (AChBP) (23Celie P.H. Kasheverov I.E. Mordvintsev D.Y. Hogg R.C. van Nierop P. van Elk R. van Rossum-Fikkert S.E. Zhmak M.N. Bertrand D. Tsetlin V. Sixma T.K. Smit A.B. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 582-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) shows that the 2-8 disulfide of both peptides is similar to that of the 2-8 disulfide of Vc1.1 (i.e. χ2 +ve, χ3 -ve, and χ2′-ve). Potency of α-Conotoxin Vc1.1 at Native nAChRs—The functional activity of Vc1.1 was investigated via its effects on nicotine-evoked membrane currents in dissociated bovine chromaffin cells. Bath application of Vc1.1 reversibly inhibited nicotine (100 μm)-evoked depolarizing membrane currents in chromaffin cells voltage clamped at −100 mV (Fig. 5a). High micromolar concentrations (≥10 μm) of the toxin almost completely blocked the nicotine-evoked current in chromaffin cells, which recovered completely upon washout (Fig. 5b). Fig. 5c shows the concentration-response relationship obtained for inhibition of nicotine-evoked current amplitude by bath-applied Vc1.1. The curve fitted according to Equation 1 gave a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 1.54 ± 0.14 μm and slope factor (Hill coefficient) of 1.64 ± 0.22 (n = 6). The time courses of onset of inhibition of nicotine-evoked current obtained in the presence of toxin and the recovery from block during toxin washout were fitted by single exponential functions. On- and off-rates of nAChR inhibition and estimates of potency (Kd) were obtained following application and washout of Vc1.1. Vc1.1 (10 μm) exhibited rapid onset of block (kon = 1.3 ± 0.1 × 103 m−1 s−1) and a maximum inhibition to 11 ± 2% (n = 6) of control. Recovery from block to 81 ± 4% (n = 6) of control was obtained after 10 min washout (Fig. 5b) and was associated with a dissociation rate constant, koff = 4.4 ± 0.1 × 10−3 m−1 s−1. Therefore, using Equation 2, a Kd of 3.4 × 10−6 m was calculated. Fig. 6a shows whole cell membrane currents evoked by focal application of 100 μm nicotine to the chromaffin cell held at different membrane potentials. Whole cell I-V relations obtained for peak nicotine-evoked currents obtained in the absence and presence of 1 μm and 2.5 μm Vc1.1 are shown in Fig. 6b. Vc1.1 reversibly inhibited nicotine-evoked current amplitude by ≥ 53% and ≥ 77% (n = 6) at all membrane potentials in the presence of 1 μm and 2.5 μm Vc1.1, respectively, indicating that the block of nAChRs by Vc1.1 was voltage-independent. Competitive antagonism of nAChRs in chromaffin cells by Vc1.1 was evaluated from nicotine concentration-response relations determined in the absence and presence of various concentrations of Vc1.1. A rightward shift without noticeable depression of the concentration-response curve was observed for nicotine-induced currents in the presence of 0.5 μm, 1 μm, and 2.5 μm Vc1.1 (Fig. 6c). Schild plots constructed from shifts (dose ratios) of nicotine concentration-response curves in the absence and presence of Vc1.1 revealed pA2 values of 6.33 (Fig. 6d). The slope of the Schild regression did not significantly differ from unity (−0.99), because the confidence interval of the estimate of the slope included 1 at the 5% significance level. Selectivity of α-CTX Vc1.1 Inhibition of Recombinant nAChR Subtypes—Vc1.1 inhibition of ACh-induced currents was examined in Xenopus oocytes expressing various nAChRs subunit combinations. The ACh-evoked response was assessed every 10 min, and the toxin was bath-applied 4 min prior to co-application of the agonist plus toxin. Vc1.1 (10 μm) failed to inhibit ACh-evoked currents mediated by either the central nAChR subtypes, α4β2 and α4β4, or the skeletal muscle nAChR subtype, α1β1γδ (n = 7-12) (Fig. 7 and Table 2). Similarly, 10 μm Vc1.1 inhibited only 14 ± 2% of the ACh-evoked current mediated by the homopentameric neuronal nAChR, α7 (n = 11) (Fig. 7 and Table 2). However, 10 μm Vc1.1 inhibited the peripheral nAChR subtypes α3β2 and α3β4 to a similar extent, 58 ± 7% (n = 8) and 56 ± 7% (n = 12) of control, respectively. A similar potency was observed upon addition of the α5 subunit to the nAChR combination, α3α5β2(n = 7),"
https://openalex.org/W2143616664,"We have previously reported that keratinocytes defective in glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor biosynthesis display enhanced TGF-beta responses. These studies implicated the involvement of a 150 kDa GPI-anchored TGF-beta1 binding protein, r150, in modulating TGF-beta signaling. Here, we sought to determine the molecular identity of r150 by affinity purification and microsequencing. Our results identify r150 as CD109, a novel member of the alpha2-macroglobulin (alpha2M)/complement superfamily, whose function has remained obscure. In addition, we have identified a novel CD109 isoform that occurs in the human placenta but not keratinocytes. Biochemical studies show that r150 contains an internal thioester bond, a defining feature of the alpha2M/complement family. Loss and gain of function studies demonstrate that CD109 is a component of the TGF-beta receptor system, and a negative modulator of TGF-beta responses in keratinocytes, as implicated for r150. Our data suggest that CD109 can inhibit TGF-beta signaling independently of ligand sequestration and may exert its effect on TGF-beta signaling by direct modulation of receptor activity. Together, our results linking CD109 function to regulation of TGF-beta signaling suggest that CD109 plays a unique role in the regulation of isoform-specific TGF-beta signaling in keratinocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2018944696,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during pathological events, such as inflammation and ischemia-reperfusion, activates both proapoptotic and antiapoptotic signaling programs in endothelial cells. Because cholesterol-rich, plasma membrane rafts serve as platforms for organizing and integrating signaling transduction processes, we asked whether these membrane regions play a mechanistic role in H2O2-induced responses. Bovine aortic endothelial cell cultures exposed to a 500-microM bolus of H2O2 showed progressive activation of caspase 3 and an increase in the number of TUNEL-positive cells. Pretreatment with either wortmannin or PD 098059 heightened these apoptotic responses, demonstrating that both PI3 kinase/Akt and ERK1/2 serve as signaling mediators to alleviate H2O2 cytotoxic effects. To investigate the role of lipid rafts in these signaling processes, endothelial cells were pretreated with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (CD) or filipin to ablate raft structures. H2O2-induced phosphorylation of Akt and ERK 1/2 was attenuated, while caspase 3 and the number of TUNEL positive cells was enhanced in CD-pretreated cells exposed to H2O2. Reconstitution of raft domains restored H2O2-induced Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which was concomitant with reduction of caspase 3 activation and DNA fragmentation. Taken together, our findings suggest that plasma membrane compartments rich in cholesterol participate in signal transduction pathways activated by oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2111366281,"Initially, it was thought that there was no intracellular signaling mediated by NRP-1 alone in response to its ligands. However, the emerging data from our group as well as others suggest that the signaling through NRP-1 actually promotes angiogenesis and is mediated through its C-terminal domain and downstream molecules such as phosphoinositide 3-kinase. Hence, understanding the signal transduction pathways mediated by NRP-1 and identification of its downstream molecules are of importance. By using both in vivo zebrafish model and in vitro tissue culture system, we have shown that the C-terminal three amino acids of NRP-1 (SEA-COOH) are required for NRP-1-mediated angiogenesis. Furthermore, knocking down of RGS-GAIP-interacting protein C terminus (GIPC) in zebrafish, which is associated with C-terminal domain of NRP-1, exhibits similar vasculature phenotypes to those from NRP-1 null. Specific and effective silencing of GIPC in vascular endothelium results in inhibition of NRP-1-mediated migration. In both cases as described, PDZ domain of GIPC is responsible for its function. Taken together, our data suggest a novel role of GIPC in angiogenesis and vessel formation and also support our hypothesis that NRP-1 can facilitate downstream signaling to promote angiogenesis through GIPC."
https://openalex.org/W2071426236,"Interleukin (IL)-1β is a major catabolic cytokine that plays a pivotal role in cartilage destruction. This study examined the possible involvement and regulatory mechanisms of Wnt signaling in IL-1β-induced inhibition of type II collagen expression in chondrocytes. Treatment of chondrocytes with IL-1β up-regulated Wnt-5a and down-regulated Wnt-11 expression. Conditioned medium from Wnt-5a-expressing cells inhibited type II collagen expression, whereas knockdown of Wnt-5a by siRNA blocked the inhibitory effects of IL-1β on type II collagen expression. In contrast to the inhibitory effects of Wnt-5a, Wnt-11 stimulated type II collagen expression. Wnt-5a and Wnt-11 did not cause accumulation of β-catenin or activation of the β-catenin-Tcf/Lef transcriptional complex. Instead, we found that Wnt-5a activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase and that an inhibitor of this kinase blocked Wnt-5a inhibition of type II collagen expression. In contrast, Wnt-11 activated protein kinase C and an inhibitor of this kinase blocked Wnt-11 stimulation of type II collagen expression. Collectively, these results indicate that Wnt-5a and Wnt-11 signaling through distinct non-canonical Wnt pathways have opposing effects on type II collagen expression by chondrocytes.

Collectively, these results indicate that Wnt-5a and Wnt-11 signaling through distinct non-canonical Wnt pathways have opposing effects on type II collagen expression by chondrocytes. To maintain cartilage homeostasis, articular chondrocytes synthesize cartilage-specific extracellular matrix molecules, including type II collagen and sulfated proteoglycans (1DeLise A.M. Fisher L. Tuan R.S. Osteoarthr. Cartilage. 2000; 8: 309-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). This homeostasis is lost in cartilage diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, eventually leading to cartilage destruction. Cartilage destruction involves a loss of differentiated chondrocyte phenotypes (i.e. dedifferentiation), which is characterized by the cessation of type II collagen expression, and onset of fibroblastic type I and type III collagen expression (2Sandell L.J. Aigner T. Arthritis Res. 2001; 3: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). A variety of soluble factors are known to cause chondrocyte dedifferentiation. One of the best studied is interleukin (IL) 2The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; Fz, frizzled receptor; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phophate dehydrogenase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; qRT-PCR, quantitative real-time PCR; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.2The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; Fz, frizzled receptor; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phophate dehydrogenase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; qRT-PCR, quantitative real-time PCR; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.-1β, which plays a key role in cartilage destruction (3Goldring M.B. Fukuo K. Birkhead J.R. Dudek E. Sandell L.J. J. Cell Biochem. 1994; 54: 85-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). We have also shown that Wnt-7a, which is up-regulated by IL-1β, causes dedifferentiation of chondrocytes (4Hwang S.-G. Ryu J.-H. Kim I.-C. Jho E.H. Jung H.-C. Kim K. Kim S.-J. Chun J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26597-26604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Wnt is a family of secreted glycoproteins that can be separated into two classes: the Wnt-1 class (e.g. Wnt-1, -3a, -7a, and -8), which activates the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway; and the Wnt-5a class (e.g. Wnt-4, -5a, and -11), which activates the noncanonical Wnt pathway (5Church V.L. Francis-West P. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2002; 46: 927-936PubMed Google Scholar). The canonical Wnt pathway involves stabilization of cytoplasmic β-catenin and its translocation into the nucleus, where it acts as a transcriptional coactivator. Noncanonical Wnt pathways are independent of β-catenin signaling and involve activation of protein kinase C (PKC), calmodulin-dependent kinase II, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Several Wnt isoforms are known to regulate chondrogenesis and cartilage development. For instance, forced expression of Wnt-1, -7a, or -14 inhibits chondrocyte differentiation within mesenchymal condensations (6Rudnicki J.A. Brown A.M. Dev. Biol. 1997; 185: 104-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 7Tufan A.C. Tuan R.S. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1436-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 8Hartmann C. Tabin C.J. Cell. 2001; 104: 341-351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). In addition, Wnt-5a and Wnt-5b are reported to promote chondrocyte differentiation and to inhibit chondrocyte maturation (9Church V. Nohno T. Linker C. Marcelle C. Francis-West P. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4809-4818Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In contrast, Wnt-4 and Wnt-8 have been shown to accelerate chondrocyte hypertrophy (10Hartmann C. Tabin C.J. Development. 2000; 127: 3141-3159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Enomoto-Iwamoto M. Kitagaki J. Koyama E. Tamamura Y. Wu C. Kanatani N. Koike T. Okada H. Komori T. Yoneda T. Church V.

In addition to the regulation of chondrogenesis and limb development, Wnt proteins appear to regulate the maintenance of differentiated chondrocyte phenotypes. This possibility is indirectly supported by the observation that several Wnt proteins and frizzled receptors (Fz) are expressed in the synovial tissue of arthritic cartilage (12Sen M. Lauterbach K. El-Gabalawy H. Firestein G.S. Corr M. Carson D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2791-2796Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). More direct evidence was provided by our previous observations that Wnt-3a and Wnt-7a inhibit type II collagen expression in articular chondrocytes via the canonical pathway (4Hwang S.-G. Ryu J.-H.

FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 4837-4842Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar); however, the Wnt isoforms regulated by proinflammatory cytokines in chondrocytes and the role of the regulated Wnt isoforms in chondrocyte dedifferentiation have not been identified. Therefore, in the present study, we identified Wnt isoforms regulated by IL-1β in chondrocytes and examined the role of the identified Wnt isoforms in chondrocyte-specific type II collagen expression. We report here that Wnt-5a and Wnt-11 have opposite effects on type II collagen expression via distinct noncanonical Wnt pathways. Articular Chondrocytes and Cartilage Explant Cultures— Rabbit articular chondrocytes were isolated from the cartilage of 2-week-old or 8-month-old New Zealand White rabbits as described previously (14Yoon Y.-M.

Cartilage slices were dissociated enzymatically for 4 h in 0.2% collagenase type II (381 units/mg solid; Sigma) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen). Individual cells were suspended in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 50μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 units/ml penicillin and plated on culture dishes at a density of 5 × 104 cells/cm2. After 3 days in culture, the cells were treated with IL-1β or Wnt-containing conditioned medium and transfected with a reporter gene or siRNA in the presence of 10% (v/v) serum. Type II collagen expression was determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot analysis. For cartilage explant cultures, rabbit joint cartilage explants (∼125 mm3) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum in the absence or presence of IL-1β for 72 h. Expressions of Wnt-5a, Wnt-11, and type II collagen were determined by in situ hybridization. Alternatively, type II collagen protein was detected by Western blotting or immunohistochemistry using anti-type II collagen antibody (MAB8887) obtained from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA) as described below. The epitope for the antibody is localized in the triple helix of type II collagen and the antibody recognizes α1(II) chain of collagen. Preparation of Conditioned Medium Containing Wnt-5a or Wnt-11—Wnt-5a-producing L cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Rabbit Wnt-11 was cloned from chondrocytes (GenBank™ accession number DQ388601), and a mammalian Wnt-11 expression vector was constructed in pcDNA3.0 (Invitrogen). NIH3T3 cells were transfected with the Wnt-11 expression vector or empty vector using Metafectene (Biontex Laboratories GmbH, Munich, Germany), and stable cell lines were established by selection with G418 (0.75 mg/ml). Expression of Wnt-5a and Wnt-11 in stable cell lines was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis. To collect conditioned medium, Wnt-5a-producing L cells or Wnt-11-producing NIH3T3 cells were maintained in serum-free DMEM for 36 h. Conditioned medium was clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min and concentrated 20-fold by ultrafiltration in Amicon-stirred cells (Millipore, Billerica, MA) using a YM membrane with a 10-kDa molecular mass cut-off as described previously (4Hwang S.-G. Ryu J.-H. Kim I.-C. Jho E.H. Jung H.-C. Kim K. Kim S.-J. Chun J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26597-26604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Currently, there are no appropriate methods to determine the exact activity of the Wnt proteins in the conditioned medium. However, the activity of Wnt proteins in conditioned medium was ascertained by measuring transcriptional activity of β-catenin using TOPFlash assay and by determining activation of noncanonical pathways. In addition, control conditioned medium was obtained from a stable cell line transfected with empty vector and used as a control for Wnt-conditioned medium. Reporter Gene Assay—β-Catenin-Tcf/Lef transcriptional activity was determined by a reporter gene assay as described previously (15Ryu J.-H. Kim S.-J. Kim S.-H. Oh C.-D. Hwang S.-G. Chun C.-H. Oh S.-H. Seong J.-K. Huh T.-L. Chun J.-S. Development. 2002; 129: 5541-5550Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Briefly, chondrocytes were transfected with 1 μg of reporter gene (TOPFLASH; optimal Lef-binding site) or control gene (FOPFLASH; mutated Lef-binding site) (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) and 1 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase using Metafectene. Following culture for 24 h, the cells were treated with Wnt-5a- or Wnt-11-conditioned medium for an additional 24 h. Luciferase activity was measured and normalized for transfection efficiency as measured by β-galactosidase activity. RT-PCR Analysis and Quantitative Real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)—Total RNA was isolated using RNA STAT-60 (Tel-Test, Woodlands, TX) and reverse-transcribed with ImProm-II™ reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI). The generated cDNA was amplified by PCR with Taq polymerase (TaKaRa Bio, Shiga, Japan). PCR primers and conditions are summarized in Table 1, and qRT-PCR was performed using a chromo 4 cycler (Bio-Rad) and SYBR Premix Ex Taq™ (TaKaRa Bio). All qRT-PCR reactions were performed in duplicate, and the amplification signal from the target gene was normalized by the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) signal in the same reaction.TABLE 1Oligonucleotide primers and PCR conditionsGenePrimer sequenceaPrimers for Col2a1 and GAPDH are designed from known rabbit sequences.

Complementary oligonucleotides for siRNAs including restriction enzyme sites, 7-mer hairpin loops (TCAAGAG), 21-mer nucleotide sense, and 21-mer nucleotide antisense were designed according to the manufacturer's specifications (InvivoGen). Annealing of sense and antisense oligonucleotides (25 μm) was performed in a solution containing 0.15 m NaCl by heating at 80 °C for 2 min and then cooling to 35 °C. Annealed siRNAs were ligated into Acc65I/HindIII-digested psiRNA-hH1GFP:zeo vector (InvivoGen). Cells were transfected with the siRNAs using Metafectene. Two of the tested siRNA (no. 2 and no. 3) caused effective knockdown of Wnt-5a. Immunohistochemistry—Rabbit joint cartilage explants were fixed for 24 h at 4 °C in phosphate-buffered saline containing 4% paraformaldehyde, dehydrated with increasing concentrations of ethanol, embedded in paraffin, and cut into 4-μm sections as described previously (15Ryu J.-H. Kim S.-J. Kim S.-H. Oh C.-D. Hwang S.-G. Chun C.-H. Oh S.-H. Seong J.-K. Huh T.-L. Chun J.-S. Development. 2002; 129: 5541-5550Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Dewaxed paraffin sections were stained by standard procedures using an antibody against type II collagen (Chemicon International) and visualized with a kit purchased from DAKO Co. (Carpinteria, CA). The sections were counterstained with hematoxylin or nuclear fast red, and sulfated glycosaminoglycan was stained with Alcian blue. In Situ Hybridization—Digoxigenin-conjugated riboprobes for type II collagen, Wnt-5a, and Wnt-11 were synthesized using digoxigenin RNA labeling mix (Roche Diagnostics Corp., Indianapolis, IN). Briefly, the cDNA fragment of rabbit type II collagen was amplified by PCR using specific primers (sense, 5′-GGG TCT CCT GCC TCC TCC TGC TC-3′; antisense, 5′-CTC CAT CTC TGC CAC GGG GT-3′). The cDNA encoding rabbit Wnt-5a and Wnt-11 was inserted into the pcDNA3.0 vector. The full-length DNA plasmids were cut with PstI and SacI for Wnt-5a or with BamHI and SacI for Wnt-11. The products were cloned into the pSPT-18 vector (Roche Diagnostics Corp.), linearized with EcoRI or HindIII, and transcribed with SP6 or T7 RNA polymerase, respectively, to generate antisense and sense probes. For hybridization, dewaxed paraffin sections of cartilage explants were treated with 0.2 n HCl for 10 min and then permeabilized for 10 min at 37 °C with 20 μg/ml proteinase K. After acetylation for 10 min with 0.25% acetic anhydride, the sections were incubated with hybridization buffer (40% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 1× Denhardt's solution, 4× SSC, 10 μm dithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml yeast tRNA, and 1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA) containing denatured sense or antisense digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes. The sections were treated for 30 min at 37 °C with 10 mg/ml RNase A and processed using an anti-digoxigenin detection assay kit (Roche Diagnostics Corp.). Hybridization signals were visualized with a solution of 4-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-iodolyl-phosphate (Roche Diagnostics Corp.). Western Blot Analysis—Whole cell lysate were prepared as described previously (14Yoon Y.-M. Kim S.-J. Oh C.-D. Ju J.-W. Song W.-K. Yoo Y.-J. Huh T.-L. Chun J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 297: 8412-8420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Proteins were size-fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The nitrocellulose sheet was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline. The following antibodies were used to detect proteins: anti-type II collagen (Chemicon International), anti-β-catenin (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), antiextracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK)-1 (BD Biosciences), anti-pan-phospho-PKC (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), and anti-phospho-JNK (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The blots were developed using a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence detection. IL-1β Up-regulates Wnt-5a and Down-regulates Wnt-11 in Chondrocytes—We have previously shown that IL-1β up-regulates Wnt-7a, which causes inhibition of type II collagen expression in chondrocytes (4Hwang S.-G. Ryu J.-H. Kim I.-C. Jho E.H. Jung H.-C. Kim K. Kim S.-J. Chun J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26597-26604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In this study, we extended our study to the various isoforms of Wnt (Fig. 1A) and Fz (Fig. 1B) in primary cultures chondrocytes obtained from joint articular cartilage of 2-week-old rabbits or 8-month-old rabbits. We examined 11 Wnt isoforms and 9 Fz isoforms, and we detected 5 of each. As shown in Fig. 1, IL-1β up-regulated Wnt-5a and Wnt-7a and down-regulated Wnt-11. IL-1β also down-regulated the expression of Fz-1 and Fz-6. Because the functions of up-regulated Wnt-7a have already been reported (4Hwang S.-G. Ryu J.-H. Kim I.-C. Jho E.H. Jung H.-C. Kim K. Kim S.-J. Chun J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26597-26604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), we selected Wnt-5a and Wnt-11 for functional characterization in chondrocytes. Consistent with the inhibitory effects on type II collagen expression in the primary chondrocytes cultures (Fig. 1), IL-1β suppressed type II collagen expression as determined by in situ hybridization and proteoglycan synthesis as demonstrated by Alcian blue staining in cartilage explants (Fig. 2). IL-1β also extensively removed type II collagen in explants as determined by immnohistochemistry. This might be due to not only by the inhibition of type II collagen expression but also induction and activation of matrix metalloproteinases (16Kozaci L.D. Buttle D.J. Hollander A.P. Arthritis Rheum. 1997; 40: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In situ hybridization analysis also indicated that IL-1β causes up-regulation of Wnt-5a and down-regulation of Wnt-11 in cartilage explants cultures (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Up-regulation of Wnt-5a and down-regulation of Wnt-11 expression by IL-1β in cartilage explant cultures. Cartilage explant cultures were untreated (Control) or treated with 5 ng/ml IL-1β for 72 h. Explants were sectioned, and levels of type II collagen, Wnt-5a, and Wnt-11 transcripts were detected by in situ hybridization or immunohistochemical staining. Accumulation of sulfated proteoglycan was determined by Alcian blue staining. The results are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We further characterized the effects of IL-1β on expression of type II collagen, Wnt-5a and Wnt-11 in primary cultures of chondrocytes obtained from articular cartilage of 2-week-old rabbits. As shown in Fig. 3A, IL-1β down-regulated type II collagen expression as demonstrated by Western blotting and RT-PCR. IL-1β also up-regulated Wnt-5a and down-regulated Wnt-11 in a time-dependent manner. We next performed qRT-PCR analysis to compare the expression pattern of Wnt proteins and type II collagen (Fig. 3B). We found that Wnt-5a expression was enhanced and Wnt-11 was reduced after 6 h of stimulation with IL-1β. Thus, qRT-PCR indicated that there is a strong correlation between type II collagen expression and the both down-regulation of Wnt-11 and the up-regulation of Wnt-5a. Wnt-5a Inhibits Type II Collagen Expression in Chondrocytes—The above results suggested that Wnt-5a and Wnt-11 are involved in dedifferentiation of chondrocytes. Therefore, we first examined the role of Wnt-5a in type II collagen expression by using Wnt-5a conditioned medium prepared from L cells. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, treatment of chondrocytes with Wnt-5a significantly reduced the expression of type II collagen in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Wnt-5a also enhanced the inhibitory effects of IL-1β on type II collagen expression (Fig. 4C). The role of Wnt-5a in the regulation of type II collagen expression was further characterized by knockdown of Wnt-5a using siRNAs. Among the three examined siRNAs, no. 2 and no. 3 effectively inhibited the up-regulation of Wnt-5a by IL-1β and resulted in a concomitant recovery of type II collagen expression (Fig. 5A). We therefore used siRNA no. 3 in subsequent experiments. Knockdown of Wnt-5a expression using the siRNA increased type II collagen expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5B). Treatment with an siRNA to block the up-regulation of Wnt-5a by IL-1β also abrogated the inhibitory effects of IL-1β on type II collagen expression (Fig. 5C). On the basis of these results, we hypothesized that Wnt-5a inhibits type II collagen expression, thereby mediating IL-1β-induced dedifferentiation of chondrocytes.FIGURE 5Knockdown of Wnt-5a blocks the suppression of type II collagen expression by IL-1β. A, chondrocytes were transfected with empty vector (−) or three different constructs of rabbit Wnt-5a siRNA (no. 1, no. 2, and no. 3). Following a 24-h incubation, the cells were left untreated (−) or treated (+) with 5 ng/ml IL-1β for an additional 24 h. B, chondrocytes were transfected with the indicated amount of Wnt-5a siRNA (no. 3) and incubated for 48 h. C, chondrocytes were transfected with empty vector or indicated concentrations of the Wnt-5a siRNA vector (no. 3). Following 24 h of culture, the cells were untreated (−) or treated (+) with 5 ng/ml IL-1β for additional 24 h. Expression of type II collagen and Wnt-5a were detected by Western blotting (WB)or RT-PCR. ERK and GAPDH were analyzed as loading controls. The results are representative of four independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Wnt-11 Enhances Type II Collagen Expression in Chondrocytes—We next examined the role of Wnt-11, which is down-regulated by IL-1β, in type II collagen expression by using Wnt-11-containing conditioned medium prepared from NIH3T3 cells. In contrast to the inhibitory effects of Wnt-5a, type II collagen expression was significantly enhanced by exogenous Wnt-11 (Fig. 6A). This stimulation of type II collagen expression by Wnt-11 was dose-dependent (Fig. 6B). Wnt-11 treatment, however, did not affect the inhibition of type II collagen expression by IL-1β (Fig. 6C). The effects of Wnts on type II collagen mRNA expression were observed within 6 h of treatment with Wnt-5a (Fig. 4A) or Wnt-11 (Fig. 6A). However, because of long half-life of type II collagen mRNA (i.e. 15 h) (17Askew G.R. Wang S. Lukens L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16834-16841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the effects of Wnts on type II collagen transcription are likely to be much earlier than this. Wnt-5a and Wnt-11 Regulate Type II Collagen Expression by Distinct Noncanonical Wnt Pathways—We next investigated the mechanisms by which Wnt-5a and Wnt-11 regulate type II collagen expression. We first focused on the role of the canonical Wnt pathway by measuring the accumulation of β-catenin and the transcriptional activity of the β-catenin-Tcf/Lef complex. As shown in Fig. 7, treatment of chondrocytes with Wnt-5a or Wnt-11 conditioned medium did not cause the accumulation of β-catenin as determined by Western blotting or the activation of the β-catenin-Tcf/Lef transcriptional complex as determined by a reporter gene assay. This suggests that the canonical Wnt pathway is not involved in the regulation of type II collagen expression by Wnt-5a or Wnt-11. We therefore examined the role of the noncanonical Wnt pathway in the effects of Wnt-5a and Wnt-11 by focusing on the activation of PKC and JNK. We found that Wnt-5a transiently activated JNK, as demonstrated by its phosphorylation, but that it did not affect the phosphorylation of PKC. Pretreatment of cells with the JNK inhibitor SP600125 (18Bennett B.L. Sasaki D.T. Murray B.W. O'Leary E.C. Sakata S.T. Xu W. Leisten J.C. Motiwala A. Pierce S. Satoh Y. Bhagwat S.S. Manning A.M.

Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15771-15781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) blocked the reduction of type II collagen expression by Wnt-5a (Fig. 8A). In contrast to the effects of Wnt-5a, Wnt-11 transiently activated PKC, as demonstrated by its phosphorylation, but it did activate JNK. Pretreatment with the PKC inhibitor GF109203X but not the JNK inhibitor SP600125 blocked the increase in type II collagen expression by Wnt-11 (Fig. 8B). These results indicate that Wnt-5a and Wnt-11 regulate type II collagen expression by distinct noncanonical Wnt pathways, namely by activating JNK and PKC, respectively. We demonstrated in this study that IL-1β, a major proinflammatory cytokine involved in cartilage destruction, up-regulates the expression of Wnt-5a and down-regulates the expression of Wnt-11. We also demonstrated that Wnt-5a inhibits type II collagen expression by activating the JNK pathway, whereas Wnt-11 enhances type II collagen expression by activating the PKC signaling pathway (see Fig. 9 for a summary of these pathways). Thus, our results suggest that Wnt-5a is associated with cartilage destruction, whereas Wnt-11 plays a role in the maintenance of cartilage homeostasis. Several Wnt isoforms are expressed in the developing cartilage and bone, and they appear to have"

Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1028-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). Activation of caspases, either by extrinsic or intrinsic signals, is regulated by a set of proteins, including the components of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), in the death receptor-mediated extrinsic pathway, and the Bcl-2 family of anti- and proapoptotic proteins, as well as the apoptosome complex including Apaf-1, in the intrinsic pathway, which involves the mitochondrion (2Danial N.N.

Therefore, cardiac ischemia is a clinically relevant model for analyzing the mechanisms that promote death in differentiated cardiomyocytes. Potential executors of caspase-independent cell death have been discovered. The mitochondrial protein apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) was identified as an important executor of cell death when translocated to the nucleus (14Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Castedo M. Hirsch T. Marchetti P. Macho A. Daugas E. Geuskens M. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1331-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). Translocation of AIF has been proposed to be both caspase-dependent (15Arnoult D. Parone P. Martinou J.C. Antonsson B. Estaquier J. Ameisen J.C. J.

Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 591-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the death-inducing role of AIF in differentiated cells is controversial. Indeed, the participation of AIF in cell death has been either confirmed (19Cregan S.P. Fortin A. MacLaurin J.G. Callaghan S.M. Cecconi F. Yu S.W. Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Park D.S. Kroemer G.

Thus, the role of AIF in promoting cell death and the mechanisms involved in promoting its release from mitochondria need to be better characterized. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, AIF is a component of the caspase-dependent mitochondrial pathway, which also involves the mitochondrial endonuclease EndoG (26Wang X. Yang C. Chai J. Shi Y. Xue D. Science. 2002; 298: 1587-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). However, the role of EndoG in apoptotic DNA damage was initially suggested to be caspase-independent (27Li L.Y. Luo X. Wang X. Nature. 2001; 412: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar, 28Parrish J. Li L. Klotz K. Ledwich D. Wang X. Xue D. Nature. 2001; 412: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent data from EndoG deficient mice do not apparently support a relevant role of this protein in mammalian cell death and DNA processing (29Irvine R.A. Adachi N. Shibata D.K. Cassell G.D. Yu K. Karanjawala Z.E. Hsieh C.L. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 294-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 30David K.K. Sasaki M. Yu S.W. Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1147-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Therefore, the role of EndoG in mammalian cell death and the mechanisms involved in its release from mitochondria deserve further investigation. While studying the mechanisms involved in cardiomyocyte cell death, we found that these cells down-regulate the expression of caspases after birth. Therefore, we checked the role of several known caspase-independent effectors of cell damage by using a lentiviral-driven gene knockdown approach. Results herein reported prove that cardiomyocytes lose the competence to dye by apoptosis after the caspase-dependent machinery is silenced during development, and show the existence of a caspase-independent, yet mitochondria-dependent, cell death pathway involving translocation and activation of EndoG, leading to the degradation of nuclear DNA, independently of AIF. Chemicals—Executor caspase-specific substrate Z-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-AFC (Z-DEVD-AFC), caspase-8-specific substrate Z-Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp-AFC (Z-IETD-AFC), pan-caspase inhibitor Z-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-CH2F (z-VAD-fmk), poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors 3,4-dihydro-5[4-(1-piperindinyl)butoxy]-1(2H)-isoquinoline (DPQ) and 1,5-dihydroxyisoquinoline (DIQ), and calpain inhibitor carbobenzoxy-valinyl-phenylalaninal (MDL 28170) were purchased from Calbiochem. Other chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Cell Culture, Treatments, and Viability Measurements—Rat neonatal cardiomyocytes and heart fibroblasts were obtained from the heart of 3-5-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats as described elsewhere (4Sanchis D. Mayorga M. Ballester M. Comella J.X. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 977-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 31Mayorga M. Bahi N. Ballester M. Comella J.X. Sanchis D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34882-34889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Embryonic cardiomyocytes (E16) were obtained following essentially the same protocol, but reducing the time of digestion to 15 min, and were cultured in the same medium enriched with 1 μm insulin (Sigma), 1 ng/ml cardiotrophin-1 (R&D Systems), and 10 nm mouse epidermal growth factor (Upstate). Adult cardiomyocytes (P180) were obtained and cultured following the protocol described by Ravassa et al. (32Ravassa S. Fortuño M.A. González A. López B. Zalba G. Fortuño A. Díez J. Hypertension. 2000; 36: 1065-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Experimental ischemia was achieved by culturing cells in Tyrode's solution (NaCl 137 mm, KCl 2.7 mm, Na2HPO4 8 mm, KH2PO4 1.5 mm, CaCl2 0.9 mm, and 0.5 mm, initial pH: 7.2) inside a hypoxic chamber (Billups-Rothenberg) in a mixture of 5% CO2 and 95% N2 following manufacturer's instructions to attain a 0.1% oxygen concentration (31Mayorga M. Bahi N. Ballester M. Comella J.X. Sanchis D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34882-34889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Quantification of cell death was performed by the trypan blue exclusion assay at the end of treatments as reported (31Mayorga M. Bahi N. Ballester M. Comella J.X. Sanchis D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34882-34889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Cell death in each experimental condition was measured in duplicates, and error bars represent the S.E. of three independent experiments. Enzymatic Caspase Activity Assay—Caspase-8 (Z-IETD-AFC) and executioner (Z-DEVD-AFC) caspase activity were measured in cell extracts as previously reported (4Sanchis D. Mayorga M. Ballester M. Comella J.X. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 977-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), using the fluorogenic substrates at 50 μm in 96-well plates. Fluorescence was detected with a Bio-tek FL 600 fluorometer (Izasa). Data obtained for different experimental conditions were compared within the linear phase of absorbance increase. Data are the mean of three independent experiments performed in duplicates. Cytosolic Extracts—Cytosolic fractions were obtained as previously reported (4Sanchis D. Mayorga M. Ballester M. Comella J.X. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 977-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) at the end of the treatments to detect the release of apoptotic factors from the mitochondria. Western Blot and Immunofluorescence Detection—Whole cell lysates were obtained by addition of Tris-2%SDS pH: 6.8 buffered solution to the cell cultures at the end of the treatments. Protein extracts were denatured by heat shock at 95 °C for 3 min and quantified by the Lowry Assay (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of protein were electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences), and probed with specific antibodies (supplemental Table S1). For immunofluorescence detection, cells were cultured in 4-well plates (NunClon) and fixed by either incubation with paraformaldehyde 4% for 10 min or by 100% methanol for 5 min. Cells were rinsed, permeabilized, and stained as described previously (31Mayorga M. Bahi N. Ballester M. Comella J.X. Sanchis D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34882-34889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). For apoptosis quantification, cells showing cleaved caspase-3 expression and nuclear fragmentation were counted as apoptotic. At least, 100 cells were analyzed per condition and values are mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments. DNA Integrity Assay—Cells were pelleted at the end of each treatment and frozen at −80 °C. Pellets from the same experiment were processed at once. They were diluted in 40 μl of sterile phosphate-buffered saline, mixed with 40 μl of melted 1% low melting agarose (Sigma) in 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris pH 8.3, 45 mm boric acid, 1.0 mm EDTA). Each mixture was poured into a block caster and let to solidify. Each agarose block was submerged into 1 ml of lysis buffer (1% lauryl sarcosil, 0.5 m EDTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 100 μg/ml proteinase K) at 50 °C during 24 h in mild agitation, and rinsed twice with 0.5× TBE for 1 h at room temperature. For analysis of DNA high molecular weight degradation, the blocks were then laid into wells of a 1% agarose, 0.5× TBE gel (CHEF grade, Sigma). Pulse field electrophoresis was performed in a CHEF DR-II system (Bio-Rad) set to the following protocol: run time, 14 h; switch time from 5 to 50 s; voltage gradient, 6 V/cm. Initial lysis buffer was further processed to analyze DNA low molecular weight degradation. Briefly, 1 ml of lysis buffer from DNA extraction was mixed with 1 ml of ethanol, kept at −20 °C for 18 h, and centrifuged. The pellet was rinsed with 70% ethanol, centrifuged again, and the final DNA pellet was diluted in 20 μl of 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 μg/ml RNase. Conventional 2% agarose-gel electrophoresis was performed. Gels were stained with SYBR Safe (Molecular Probes), visualized by UV exposure and recorded with a Kodak DC290 digital camera. Overexpression and Detection of FLAG-tagged EndoG in Cardiomyocytes—To test the hypothesis that EndoG translocates from mitochondria to cytosol during ischemia in cardiomyocytes, the coding sequence of EndoG contained in the mouse IMAGE clone 5029633 (MRC Gene Service) was PCR-amplified flanked by the EcoRI and XbaI sites and was subcloned into the pCDNA3.1 expression plasmid (Invitrogen) inframe and upstream to a FLAG tag. Cardiomyocytes were transfected by the Lipofectamine system (Invitrogen) and overexpressed EndoG-FLAG was detected by immunofluorescence and Western blot with an anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma). Gene Knockdown by Small Hairpin RNA Interference (shRNAi) using Lentiviral Vectors—Specific 19 nucleotide sequences were chosen for each gene (AIF, EndoG) using the free RNAi design interfaces available at the Promega and Invitrogen web sites. Primer couples were designed for cloning in the pSUPER plasmid (Oligoengine) using the BglII and HindIII sites. Primers were designed against the sequences 5′-GGCAACATGGTGAAACTTA-3′ for rat AIF and 5′-GGAACAACCTTGAGAAGTA-3′ for rat EndoG. Then, an EcoRI/ClaI fragment containing the H1 promoter for the RNA polymerase III and the shRNAi sequence was cut from pSUPER and subcloned into the pLVTHM plasmid (from Dr. Trono, Geneva). For each gene, we designed a couple of primers carrying two nucleotide changes from the original sequence that were initially used to verify the specificity of the shRNAi constructs. Each specific shRNAi vector was transfected into HEK293T cells together with the plasmids psPAX2 and pMD2G (from Dr. Trono), using the polyethyleneimine transfection method (Sigma). Transfection efficiency was analyzed by detection of the enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) expression, whose coding sequence is contained in the pLVTHM plasmid and driven by an IRES sequence. The 293T medium was collected after 48 h of transfection and centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 3 h. The final viral pellet was diluted in sterile phosphate-buffered saline plus 2% bovine serum albumin and titrated by transduction of cardiac fibroblasts before treating cardiomyocytes. Cardiomyocytes were transduced 4 h after seeding. Efficiency of transduction was estimated to be over 80% by detection of EGFP expression at 48 h. The capability of the constructs for repressing each gene was routinely tested by Western blot for AIF and by RT-PCR from total RNA for EndoG, as described below. The maximum efficacy of the shRNAi plasmids for reducing endogenous expression of the genes was determined to reach a plateau from 4-6 days after transduction, depending on the gene. Therefore, treatment of cardiomyocytes was started always 6 days after transduction, i.e. after seeding. All experiments carried out with transduced cardiomyocytes were repeated at least four times. Detection of EndoG Transcript by RNA Reverse Transcription Coupled to Standard PCR—Gene expression was analyzed by reverse transcription coupled to PCR (RT-PCR) from total RNA extracts as reported for other genes (31Mayorga M. Bahi N. Ballester M. Comella J.X. Sanchis D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34882-34889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Conventional PCR was performed in a GeneAmp PCR System 2700 thermocycler (Applied Biosystems), using an annealing temperature of 55 °C, with the primers forward: 5′-GACTTCCACGAGGACGATTC-3′, and reverse: 5′-AAGCTGCGGCTGTACTTCTC-3′, producing an amplicon of 218 bp. Control for cDNA input in the amplification reaction performed with a couple of primers amplifying a fragment of the “upstream of n-Ras” (unr) gene. PCR products were migrated in 2% agarose gels and visualized by SYBR Safe staining. Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments. The significance of differences among means was evaluated using the Student's t test. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. Down-regulation of the Caspase-dependent Death Pathway during Cardiac Development Is Associated with a Decrease in Ischemia-induced Caspase Activation in Cardiomyocytes—Expression of the main regulators of caspase-dependent cell death decreased with age in the rat myocardium (Fig. 1A). Apoptotic gene repression took place also in vitro in postnatal cardiomyocytes (Fig. 1B). Experimental ischemia (ischemia, hereafter) was achieved by culturing cells inside a hypoxic chamber (31Mayorga M. Bahi N. Ballester M. Comella J.X. Sanchis D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34882-34889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) in a Tyrode's solution without serum and glucose that becomes acidic during hypoxia (final pH 6.1-6.4). We used skin fibroblasts as positive control for the activation of caspases in this setting (31Mayorga M. Bahi N. Ballester M. Comella J.X. Sanchis D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34882-34889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Executioner caspase-3 activation was observed in embryonic cardiomyocytes and skin fibroblasts, but not in postnatal and adult cardiomyocytes during ischemia or staurosporine treatment (Fig. 1C and supplemental Figs. S1-S3). However, ischemia induced cell death to a similar extent in postnatal cardiomyocytes and skin fibroblasts, whereas cardiac fibroblasts survived to the ischemic period (Fig. 1D). On this account, we have previously reported that cardiac fibroblasts are resistant to apoptosis because of their strong expression of the antiapoptotic factor Bcl-2 (31Mayorga M. Bahi N. Ballester M. Comella J.X. Sanchis D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34882-34889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These data establish a correlation between the silencing of the apoptotic genes during myocardial development and the reduction in the competence of postnatal cardiomyocytes to activate apoptosis. Lack of Caspase Re-expression and Caspase Activity in Cardiomyocytes during Ischemia and Relevance of the Mitochondrial Pathway in Ischemia-induced Fibroblast Apoptosis—Expression of the initiator caspases-8 and -9, the postmitochondrial regulator Apaf-1, and the executioner caspase-3, were significantly less expressed in cultured postnatal cardiomyocytes than in cardiac and dermal fibroblasts (Fig. 2A). Importantly, myocardial expression of these genes was not up-regulated during ischemia (Fig. 2A). Processing of caspase-9, an initiator caspase in the mitochondrial pathway, occurred in skin fibroblasts and, later in cardiac fibroblasts, but not in cardiomyocytes (Fig. 2A). Initiator caspase-8-like activity was measured as an indication of the role of the death receptor-dependent pathway during ischemic cell death. Caspase-8 activity was not detected in ischemic cardiomyocytes, cardiac, and dermal fibroblasts before caspase-3 was engaged (Fig. 2B). Executioner caspase activity was not detected in ischemic cardiomyocytes but was evident in skin fibroblasts (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that a low expression of the caspase-dependent machinery in postnatal cardiomyocytes is maintained during ischemia, thus limiting the impact of caspase activation. Furthermore, executioner caspase processing was not substantially enhanced when ischemic adult cardiomyocyte cultures (pH 6.1-6.4) were reoxygenated and cultured in standard medium (pH 7-7.5) (Fig. 2D). However, ischemia activated the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis in proliferating cell types such as fibroblasts (Fig. 2A). The Pattern of DNA Degradation Induced during Ischemia in Cardiomyocytes Suggests the Participation of Caspase-independent Mechanisms—Caspase-dependent cell death induces a characteristic pattern of DNA degradation related to the activity of endonucleases that cleave DNA between nucleosomes, rendering fragments of low molecular weight, the so-called DNA laddering. Caspase-independent PCD can induce high molecular weight fragmentation of DNA, mainly in fragments of ∼50 kb (14Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Castedo M. Hirsch T. Marchetti P. Macho A. Daugas E. Geuskens M. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1331-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar), and/or low molecular weight fragmentation, which appears as a smear after electrophoresis, because of the ability of the caspase-independent DNAses, such as EndoG, to cleave inside the nucleosomes (33Widlak P. Li L.Y. Wang X. Garrard W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48404-48409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In aerobic conditions, serum and glucose deprivation for 20 h induced two types of DNA degradation in cardiomyocytes. A faint DNA low molecular weight laddering (Fig. 3A, lower panel) that was partially reverted by the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD.fmk (Fig. 3B, lower panel), and high molecular weight fragmentation (Fig. 3A, upper panel), which was not blocked by z-VAD.fmk (Fig. 3B, upper panel). During ischemia, i.e. serum and glucose deprivation in hypoxia and acidosis, cardiomyocyte DNA was fragmented rendering a low molecular weight smear in agarose gels. Upon ischemia, DNA smear was not inhibited by the caspase inhibitor z-VAD.fmk. PARP-1 has been involved in ischemia-induced neuronal cell death (34Eliasson M.J. Sampei K. Mandir A.S. Hurn P.D. Traystman R.J. Bao J. Pieper A. Wang Z.Q. Dawson T.M. Snyder S.H. Dawson V.L. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1089-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar); however, ischemia-induced cardiac DNA damage was not blocked by the two PARP inhibitors DIQ and DPQ. In addition, although calpains have been shown to trigger the release of AIF in vitro (35Polster B.M. Basanez G. Etxebarria A. Hardwick J.M. Nicholls D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6447-6454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), addition of the pan-calpain inhibitor MDL 28170 did not prevent DNA high molecular weight degradation in ischemic cardiomyocytes (Fig. 3, A and B). Furthermore, high molecular weight fragmentation of DNA, compatible with the activity of caspase-independent pathways, was rapidly activated within a few hours of ischemia (Fig. 3A, upper panel), and was not inhibited neither by z-VAD.fmk, nor by DIQ. In contrast, DNA degradation was not observed in ischemic heart fibroblasts after 24 h of treatment, in agreement with our previous results (31Mayorga M. Bahi N. Ballester M. Comella J.X. Sanchis D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34882-34889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Ischemic skin fibroblasts showed a canonical pattern of DNA low molecular weight degradation, which was completely abolished by z-VAD.fmk (Fig. 3, A and B). Therefore, the pattern of DNA degradation during cardiomyocyte ischemia and its execution in the presence of caspase inhibitors suggest the predominant role of a caspase-independent mechanism of cell death. Ischemia Induces Cytochrome c, Truncated AIF, and EndoG Release from Cardiac Mitochondria in the Absence of Caspase Activation—We have previously reported that staurosporine does not induce caspase activation in cardiomyocytes despite cytochrome c translocation, and that overexpression of Apaf-1 partially antagonizes this resistance (4Sanchis D. Mayorga M. Ballester M. Comella J.X. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 977-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Therefore, we analyzed the release of proapoptotic mitochondrial factors during ischemia in cardiomyocytes. Cytochrome c translocation was detected during ischemia in embryonic and postnatal cardiomyocytes (Fig. 4A, panels B, D, F, and H, and Fig. 4C); however, this event was followed by caspase-3 cleavage (activation), and by nuclear fragmentation in embryonic (Fig. 1C and Fig. 4A, panels C and D) but not in postnatal cardiomyocytes (Fig. 4A, panels G and H). AIF and EndoG are mitochondrial proteins that"

The STAS domain resembles an anti-sigma factor antagonist of Bacillus subtilis, which is one distinguishing feature of the SLC26 transporter family; this family includes transporters for sulfate and other anions such as iodide and carbonate. Recent work has demonstrated that this domain is critical for the activity of Arabidopsis thaliana sulfate transporters, and specific lesions in this domain, or the exchange of STAS domains between different sulfate transporters, can severely impair transport activity. In this work we generated a Saccharomyces cerevisiae expression library of the A. thaliana Sultr1;2 gene with random mutations in the linking region-STAS domain and identified STAS domain lesions that altered Sultr1;2 biogenesis and/or function. A number of mutations in the β-sheet that forms the core of the STAS domain prevented intracellular accumulation of Sultr1;2. In contrast, the linking region and one surface of the STAS domain containing N termini of the first and second α-helices have a number of amino acids critical for the function of the protein; mutations in these regions still allow protein accumulation in the plasmamembrane, but the protein is no longer capable of efficiently transporting sulfate into cells. These results suggest that the STAS domain is critical for both the activity and biosynthesis/stability of the transporter, and that STAS sub-domains correlate with these specific functions.

Some characteristics that make SLC26 transporters distinct from each other are likely to reside within unique features of L-STAS domains.Interestingly, the STAS domain of SLC26 transporter proteins resembles the bacterial anti-sigma factor antagonist SpoIIAA of Bacillus (2Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R53-R55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SpoIIAA is a transcription factor that associates with the anti-sigma factor SpoIIAB; this association causes release of the sigma factor from SpoIIAB, triggering sporulation-specific transcription (5Ho M.S. Carniol K. Losick R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20898-20905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). SpoIIAB is also a kinase that can phosphorylate and inactivate SpoIIAA. Recently, STAS domains have been shown to be part of polypeptides other than anion transporters (6Crosson S. Rajagopal S. Moffat K. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), suggesting that STAS sequences may serve a general regulatory function.STAS domains of SLC26 transporters appear to play a role in the function/regulation of transport activity, because mutations that alter this domain can cause loss of function resulting in the diseases diastrophic dysplasia, Pendred syndrome, and congenital chloride diarrhea (7Superti-Furga A.

Recent work, using a heterologous Saccharomyces cerevisiae system, has demonstrated that the STAS domain is critical for the activity of the Arabidopsis thaliana sulfate transporter Sultr1;2 (13Shibagaki N. Grossman A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30791-30799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 14Rouached H. Berthomieu P. El Kassis E. Cathala N. Catherinot V. Labesse G. Davidian J.C. Fourcroy P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15976-15983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). When the L-STAS region of the sulfate transporter was eliminated, most of the truncated protein either never reached the S. cerevisiae plasmamembrane and was rapidly degraded, either en route to or once associated with the plasmamembrane. In contrast, if the STAS domain was deleted (L region maintained), the transporter integrated into the plasmamembrane, but the integrated protein had no detectable uptake activity. Studies of the DRA (down-regulated in adenoma) Cl--HCO3- antiporter (SLC26A3) also demonstrated a STAS domain requirement for transport function (15Chernova M.N. Jiang L. Shmukler B.E. Schweinfest C.W. Blanco P. Freedman S.D. Stewart A.K. Alper S.L. J. Physiol. 2003; 549: 3-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Furthermore, altering A. thaliana Sultr1;2 for codons encoding two cysteines or a threonine of the STAS domain (the latter is analogous to the phosphorylated serine of SpoIIAA) resulted in a polypeptide no longer able to rescue the phenotype of a S. cerevisiae sulfate transporter mutant (14Rouached H. Berthomieu P. El Kassis E. Cathala N. Catherinot V. Labesse G. Davidian J.C. Fourcroy P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15976-15983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the STAS domain contributes to both the catalytic activity and biogenesis of Sultr1;2 and probably has analogous functions in other SLC26 proteins.The control of ion homeostasis in cells is likely to involve interactions among transporters, ion channels, regulatory proteins, proteins involved in ion assimilation and sequestration, and concentrations of ions and perhaps other small molecules in the cytoplasm and/or extracellular environment. For SLC26 family proteins, the STAS domain appears to participate in some aspects of homeostatic control. Recent studies with the DRA Cl--HCO3- antiporter have demonstrated the importance of STAS domain interactions with the regulatory sequence of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, a cAMP-regulated Cl− channel. This interaction modulates the activity of both the transporter and the channel (16Ko S.B. Zeng W. Dorwart M.R. Luo X. Kim K.H. Millen L. Goto H. Naruse S. Soyombo A. Thomas P.J. Muallem S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar).To elucidate protein domain function, the generation and characterization of mutants can be invaluable. S. cerevisiae has served as a heterologous expression system for many eukaryotic genes, and mutant strains have been used to study the catalytic activity and kinetic features of several plant sulfate transporters (13Shibagaki N.

In this study we generated a yeast expression library of the A. thaliana Sultr1;2 gene that had random mutations in the L-STAS domain and selected individual, mutated Sultr1;2 genes by transforming them into CP154-7B, which is null for the two major S. cerevisiae sulfate transporters (21Cherest H. Davidian J.-C. Thomas D. Benes V. Ansorge W. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Genetics. 1997; 145: 627-637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformants were analyzed for their ability to grow on SO42- as a sole sulfur (S) source, ability to transport SO42- , and capacity to accumulate the altered Sultr1;2 polypeptide and properly target it to the plasmamembrane. Lesions in the L-STAS-encoding region of altered Sultr1;2 were characterized to determine which amino acids were critical to the functionality/biogenesis of the Sultr1;2 polypeptide. The consequences of mutations in the STAS domain are discussed and interpreted with the aid of a computer-derived structural model based on the crystal structure of SpoIIAA (14Rouached H. Berthomieu P. El Kassis E. Cathala N. Catherinot V. Labesse G. Davidian J.C. Fourcroy P. J. Biol.

Davidian J.-C. Thomas D. Benes V. Ansorge W. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Genetics. 1997; 145: 627-637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Construction and Screening of a Library of Sultr1;2 Containing Random Mutations in the STAS DomainIntermediate Construct (pIMRNDM)—Plasmids used for expression of the C-terminal, hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged sulfate transporters were constructed in pYX222x (13Shibagaki N. Grossman A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30791-30799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). This plasmid (a) was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and the resulting linearized vector (a′) in which the region encoding the catalytic domain plus part of the region encoding the L-STAS domain (to the BamHI site) was deleted. The deleted plasmid was ligated with a PCR-amplified EcoRI-BamHI fragment containing the sequence encoding Sultr1;2, extending from the initiator Met-1 to Phe-478 (the end of the catalytic region; this fragment is designated “b” in Fig. 1A). The primer set used to create b was forward (5′-ata gaa ttc atg tcg tca aga gct cac cct gtg gac-3′) and reverse (5′-ata gga tcc aaa gat gac gcc aaa gaa tgc tcc aat-3′). The resulting intermediate construct, pIMRNDM, was used to clone a randomly mutagenized L-STAS encoding region. For this purpose, we introduced a BamHI site at nucleotides 1495-1500 in the Sultr1;2 cDNA (GenBank™ accession no. AB042322), which resulted in a V479G substitution in TMD12 of the catalytic region of the transporter. This amino acid is not conserved among S. cerevisiae, plant, and human SLC26 family members (it could be Val, Leu, Gly, Ala, Ile, or Phe), and this region of the C-terminal TMD does not appear to directly influence substrate transport.Construction of Sultr1;2 Library with Mutated STAS Domains—During the amplification of the Sultr1;2 cDNA, we identified an allele of the Sultr1;2 gene with the missense mutation I553V (a to g at position 1717) that arose as a consequence of the natural error rate of TaqDNA polymerase. This mutation eliminated the BamHI site in the Sultr1;2 cDNA. The CP154-7B strain transformed with the allele containing V479G/I553V (WT′) was rescued for the methionine auxotrophy phenotype and exhibited SO42- transport activity similar to that of CP154-7B harboring the unaltered Sultr1;2 gene (WT, Fig. 1B). The Sultr1;2 cDNA encoding the I553V lesion was used as a template for PCR random mutagenesis; this enabled us to exploit the BamHI sites at the N-terminal end of the L-STAS domain for digesting (with BamHI/SalI) and cloning of PCR fragments into pIMRNDM deleted for the L-STAS region of Sultr1;2. Random mutagenesis of the L-STAS encoding region was performed by PCR amplification of the cDNA using the DiversityKit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) and the primer set RNDMFB (5′-ata gga tcc gtt gag atc gga ctt ctt att gcc gtc tcg-3′) and RNDMRS (5′-act aag tcg acc gac ctc gtt gga gag ttt tgg aca gca-3′). Two conditions with different MnSO4 concentrations (320 μm and 640 μm, for “mild” and “severe” mutagenesis, respectively) were used to generate the mutagenized libraries. The mildly mutagenesis library had 2-3 mutation per 1000 bp, whereas the severely mutagenized library had 4-6 mutations per 1000 bp. The PCR fragment of the mutated L-STAS region (“e” in Fig. 1A) was digested with BamHI and SalI and cloned into pIMRNDM digested with the same enzymes (“c′” in Fig. 1A).Selection and Growth of Transformants—The cDNA L-STAS-mutagenized library was transformed into CP154-7B by the lithium acetate method (23Burke D. Dawson D. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Plainview, NY2000: 103-105Google Scholar), and transformants were selected for histidine auxotrophy. Each transformant was streaked onto low SO42- SD medium (500 μm SO42- , 400 μm methionine, and 96 μm histidine) and high SO42- SD medium (40 mm 143 μm methionine, and 96 μm histidine) to test for SO42- -dependent growth. Growth of the transformants was monitored at 30 °C for 2-3 days. DNA fragments coding for the L-STAS domains of the various Sultr1;2 alleles were amplified by colony PCR using a primer set that annealed to sequences bordering the L-STAS-encoding region (forward, 5′-c atc ctc gca gct atc atc at-3′ and reverse, 5′-ctc agt tag cta gct gag-3′), and the amplified fragment was sequenced.Growth, Subcellular Location, and Sulfate UptakeCP154-7B transformants were grown at 30 °C in SD-His-Met liquid medium, containing 500 μm MgSO4, or SD-His liquid medium, containing ∼40 mm SO42- . Transformants were assayed for rates of growth, SO42- transport activity, and subcellular location of Sultr1;2. Cell growth was evaluated by measuring the optical density of cultures at 600 nm (A600) in a DU640 spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter, Palo Alto, CA). Cells in mid-logarithmic phase of growth (A600 = 0.2-0.3) were used for fractionation of cell membranes and polypeptide analysis (13Shibagaki N. Grossman A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30791-30799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). SO42- uptake was assayed in exponentially growing cells (A600 < 0.4) (13Shibagaki N. Grossman A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30791-30799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).Polypeptide AnalysesCells in mid-logarithmic growth phase (A600 = 0.2-0.3) were used for SDS-PAGE (13Shibagaki N. Grossman A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30791-30799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies raised to H+-ATPase1 (Pma1), a plasmamembrane marker, were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA), and anti-HA antibodies (Roche Applied Science) were used to detect the C-terminal HA-tagged Sultr1;2 polypeptide.Alignments and ThreadingSLC26 family proteins from humans (PENDRIN (O43511), DRA (P40879), prestin (P58743), and DTDST (P50443)), A. thaliana (Sultr1;1 (NP 192602), Sultr1;2 (NP 849899), Sultr2;1 (O04722), Sultr2;2 (NP565165), Sultr3;1 (NP190758), Sultr1;3 (NP564159), Sultr3;2 (NP192179), Sultr3;3 (BAA75015), Sultr3;4 (NP188220), Sultr3;5 (NP568377), Sultr4;1 (NP196859), and Sultr4;2 (NP187858); GenBank™ accession numbers are in parenthesis) and SpoIIAA from Bacillus sphaericus (PDB ID 1h4z) were aligned using ClustalW. Alignment parameters were gap opening penalty = 10, gap extension penalty = 0.2, delay divergent sequence = 30, and hydrophobic residue gap = GPSNDQEKR. The amino acid alignments of the C-terminal half of the Sultr1;2 polypeptide, which includes the L-STAS domain, are presented as a sequence logo (24Crooks G.E. Hon G. Chandonia J.M. Brenner S.E. Genome Res. 2004; 14: 1188-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (8008) Google Scholar) (available at weblogo.berkeley.edu/).RESULTSGenerating Mutagenized L-STAS of Sultr1;2—Random mutations were introduced into the Sultr1;2 sequence encoding the L-STAS domain (from the end of TMD12 to the end of the polypeptide; described under “Experimental Procedures”). The mutant Sultr1;2 cDNA library was transformed into S. cerevisiae CP154-7B (21Cherest H. Davidian J.-C. Thomas D. Benes V. Ansorge W. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Genetics. 1997; 145: 627-637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and transformants were tested for methionine-independent, SO42- -dependent growth on solid medium (Fig. 2A). This assay provided an evaluation of the effectiveness of the introduced Sultr1;2 gene in rescuing the methionine auxotrophy phenotype of CP154-7B. Sultr1;2 alleles carried by transformants unable to grow in the absence of methionine were mostly from the “mild condition” mutagenized library (except for alleles “Y517C+V616E,” “N545I,” and “S588R”), because the “severe condition”-mutagenized library often gave multiple mutations, making it difficult to interpret the phenotypes; these alleles were categorized as “nonfunctional.” We also identified “functional” alleles in transformants for which the mutated Sultr1;2 was able to rescue the methionine auxotrophy phenotype of CP154-7B (Fig. 2A). These functional alleles were isolated using the severe condition mutagenized library, because the majority of changes in functional alleles identified from the mild mutagenesis library were silent (the amino acid sequence was not altered). Colony PCR was performed to amplify DNA fragments encoding the L-STAS domain of Sultr1;2 in transformants, and amplified fragments were directly sequenced to identify mutated bases. For nonfunctional mutants, only alleles containing a single missense mutation were chosen for further analyses, except for the allele with both Y517C and V616E substitutions. Table 1 shows specific changes in STAS domain sequences from transformants expressing functional or non-functional Sultr1;2, provides a qualitative view of accumulation of Sultr1;2 in cells, and indicates whether or not the transporter localizes to the plasmamembrane (see below). A DNA fragment encoding the L-STAS peptide from each mutant allele was recloned into pIMRNDM to generate full-length Sultr1;2, the ligated insert was sequenced to ensure that no modification occurred during the cloning procedure, and the plasmid with the recombinant gene was transformed into CP154-7B; re-transformation was performed to confirm that the phenotype was solely a consequence of a lesion in the L-STAS region of the polypeptide.FIGURE 2Growth of CP154-7B harboring the unaltered Sultr1;2 gene or Sultr1;2 with random mutations in the L-STAS domain. A, CP154-7B transformed with constructs harboring the unaltered Sultr1;2 gene (WT), Sultr1;2 with two mutations introduced for cloning purposes (WT′), mutated versions of Sultr1;2, and an empty vector plasmid (vector). The descriptions of amino acid changes caused by the introduced mutations are used as allele names. Mutant alleles marked with asterisks contain additional lesions.

The bars, representing the doubling time in wild-type and mutant strains, are marked with a′ (at end of bar) when the growth rates were significantly different from those of WT′ (p < 0.02, two-tailed Student's t test). The doubling time of each transformant is an average value obtained from at least three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TABLE 1Summary of mutations analyzed in this work Class I includes alleles of the mutated Sultr1;2 gene for which the protein accumulates to significantly lower levels (<20%) than that of the unaltered Sultr1;2 polypeptide but does not rescue the methionine auxotroph phenotype of CP154-7B. Class II includes alleles of mutated Sultr1;2 gene for which the protein is expressed and accumulates in the plasmamembrane, but it does not rescue the methionine auxotroph phenotype of CP154-7B. Class III includes alleles of mutated Sultr1;2 gene for which the protein confers varying SO42- uptake activity to CP154-7B, but the transformants may not grow as rapidly in low SO42- medium as CP154-7B transformed with the unaltered Sultr1;2 gene. Complementation of the growth phenotype of CP154-7B on SO42- is based on data shown in Fig. 2: -, no growth on SO42- +, and ++, slow growth on SO42- (+, doubling time >10 h; ++, 6-10 h in low SO42- medium); +++, growth on SO42- is comparable to that of CP154-7B transformed with the unaltered Sultr1;2 gene. Protein accumulation measurements are based on immunological signals from the fused C-terminal HA epitope relative to the Pma1 signal, as shown in Fig. 3: +, <20% of wild type; ++, between 20% and 70% of wild type; +++, >70% of wild type.

Rose A. McDermott J.P. Fujiwara T. Hayashi H. Yoneyama T. Davies J.P. Plant J. 2002; 29: 475-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). SO42- uptake rates in the sel1-8 mutant of A. thaliana were reported to be lower than in the wild-type plants (27Shibagaki N. Rose A. McDermott J.P. Fujiwara T. Hayashi H. Yoneyama T. Davies J.P. Plant J. 2002; 29: 475-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). None of these altered Sultr1;2 alleles could rescue the methionine auxotrophy phenotype of CP154-7B, as shown in Fig. 2A (compare sulfate, 40 mm, with sulfate, 500 μm, in the top row of each grid). These mutant alleles do not have the lesions incorporated into the constructs for cloning purposes (V479G and I553V).Phenotypic Analysis of S. cerevisiae Cells Expressing Sultr1;2— SO42- -dependent growth characteristics of strains newly transformed with plasmids containing WT, WT′, and the randomly mutagenized Sultr1;2 alleles were monitored for growth in high and low SO42- medium. CP154-7B transformed with unaltered Sultr1;2 or with the Sultr1;2 allele with the V479G and I553V changes doubled in ∼2.8 h in SD-His medium containing 40 mm SO42- (high SO42- medium, Fig. 2B, left panel, WT and WT′), which is close to that of wild-type S. cerevisiae cells (W303 cells, not shown). All nonfunctional transformants grew in high SO42- medium with doubling times from 3 to 4 h (not shown). In most cases, growth rates were only slightly slower than that of cells harboring unaltered Sultr1;2. Although the doubling time of CP154-7B with unaltered Sultr1;2 on low SO42- medium was ∼5 h (Fig. 2B, right panel, WT and WT′), all nonfunctional transformants showed no, or extremely slow growth in low SO42- liquid medium (not shown). In contrast, doubling times of CP154-7B with functional Sultr1;2 alleles ranged from 5 to nearly 30 h on low SO42- medium (Fig. 2B, right panel), and from 3 to 4 h on high SO42- medium (Fig. 2B, left panel).Accumulation of Nonfunctional Sultr1;2—Sultr1;2 protein accumulation in nonfunctional transformants was evaluated in whole cell extracts by Western blot analyses using antibodies specific for the HA tag (positioned at the C terminus of the Sultr1;2 protein). The fusion of the HA epitope to the C terminus of the introduced protein does not affect the ability of Sultr1;2 to rescue the CP154-7B mutant phenotype (13Shibagaki N. Grossman A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30791-30799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). An antibody against Pma1 was used as a control to identify the plasmamembrane fraction and to normalize the HA signal. The level of the HA signal relative to that of Pma1 is shown in Fig. 3A and quantified in Fig. 3B. Some transformants with nonfunctional Sultr1;2 had significantly less Sultr1;2 protein than cells transformed with WT′ Sultr1;2. Transformants for which the ratio of Sultr1;2 to Pma1 signal was 20% or less relative to that measured in transformants harboring the WT′ Sultr1;2 construct were S546P, Q573P, I577N, E578K, and L607W. Low level protein accumulation in these strains is likely to explain their inability to grow on low SO42- medium and to efficiently transport SO42- these mutant alleles are classified as Class I in Table 1.FIGURE 3Sultr1;2 protein levels in strains carrying mutant alleles of Sultr1;2.

https://openalex.org/W2171145595,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) modulates several distinct aspects of synaptic transmission, including GABAergic transmission. Exposure to BDNF alters properties of GABA(A) receptors and induces changes in the expression level at the cell surface. Although phospholipase C-related inactive protein-1 (PRIP-1) plays an important role in GABA(A) receptor trafficking and function, its role in BDNF-dependent modulation of these receptors, together with the role of PRIP-2, was investigated using neurons cultured from PRIP double knock-out mice. The BDNF-dependent inhibition of whole cell GABA-evoked currents observed in wild type neurons was not detected in neurons cultured from knock-out mice. Instead, a gradual increase in GABA-evoked currents in these neurons correlated with a gradual increase in phosphorylation of GABA(A) receptor beta3 subunit in response to BDNF. To characterize the specific role(s) that PRIP plays as components of underlying molecular machinery, we examined the recruitment of protein phosphatase(s) to GABA(A) receptors. We demonstrate that PRIP associates with phosphatases as well as with beta subunits. PRIP was found to colocalize with GABA(A) receptor clusters in cultured neurons and with recombinant GABA(A) receptors when co-expressed in HEK293 cells. Importantly, a peptide mimicking a domain of PRIP involved in binding to beta subunits disrupted the co-localization of these proteins in HEK293 cells and potently inhibited the BDNF-mediated attenuation of GABA(A) receptor currents in wild type neurons. Together, the results suggest that PRIP plays an important role in BDNF-dependent regulation of GABA(A) receptors by mediating the specific association between beta subunits of these receptors with protein phosphatases."
https://openalex.org/W2138373011,"Small ubiquitin-related modifiers, SUMO-2/3 and SUMO-1, are involved in gene regulation and nuclear structures. However, little is known about the roles of SUMO, in heterochromatin formation of mammalian cells. Here we demonstrate that SUMOs directly interact with human MCAF1, which forms complexes with either the methyl-CpG-binding protein MBD1 or SETDB1, which trimethylates histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3-K9) in the presence of MCAF1. Modification of MBD1 with either SUMO-2/3 or SUMO-1 facilitated the interaction between MBD1 and MCAF1, suggesting that SUMOylation links the methylation of DNA and histones. In a cultured human cell line, SUMOs were localized in MBD1- and MCAF1-containing heterochromatin regions that were enriched in trimethyl-H3-K9 and the heterochromatin proteins HP1β and HP1γ. Specific knockdown of either SUMO-2/3 or SUMO-1 induced dissociation of MCAF1, trimethyl-H3-K9, and the HP1 proteins from the MBD1-containing heterochromatin foci, suggesting a requirement for SUMOs for heterochromatin assembly. These findings provide insights into the roles of SUMOylation in the regulation of heterochromatin formation and gene silencing."
https://openalex.org/W2076254403,"The actin-activated ATPase activity of full-length mammalian myosin Va is well regulated by Ca2+, whereas that of truncated myosin Va without the C-terminal globular tail domain (GTD) is not. Here, we have found that exogenous GTD is capable of inhibiting the actin-activated ATPase activity of GTD-deleted myosin Va. A series of truncated constructs of myosin Va further showed that the entire length of the first coiled-coil (coil-1) of the tail domain is critical for GTD-dependent regulation of myosin Va and that deletion of 58 residues from the C-terminal end of coil-1 markedly hampered regulation. Negative staining electron microscopy revealed that GTD-deleted myosin Va formed a “Y”-shaped structure, which was converted to a triangular shape, similar to the structure of full-length myosin Va in the inhibited state, by addition of exogenous GTD. In contrast, the triangular shape was not observed when the C-terminal 58 residues of coil-1 were deleted, even in the presence of exogenous GTD. Based on these results, we propose a model for the formation of the inhibited state of myosin Va. GTD binds to the C-terminal end of coil-1. The neck-tail junction of myosin Va is flexible, and the long neck enables the head domain to reach the GTD associated with the end of coil-1. Once the head interacts with the GTD, the triangular inhibited conformation is stabilized. Consistent with this model, we found that shortening of the neck of myosin Va by two IQ motifs abolished the regulation by GTD, whereas regulation was partially restored by shortening of coil-1 by an amount comparable to that of the two IQ motifs.

Class V myosin is considered one of the oldest classes of myosin, being distributed from low eukaryotes, such as yeast, to vertebrate cells (1Berg J.S. Powell B.C. Cheney R.E. Mol. Biol.

In mammalian cells, there are three distinct subclasses of myosin V, named myosin Va, Vb, and Vc (3Cheney R.E. O'Shea M.K. Heuser J.E. Coelho M.V. Wolenski J.S. Espreafico E.M. Forscher P.

Myosin Va is a processive motor, which undergoes multiple catalytic cycles coupled to multiple mechanical advances for each diffusional encounter with its actin track (6Mehta A.D. Rock R.S. Rief M.

This property allows single or a few myosin Va molecules to support movements of an organelle along actin filaments with a large step approximating the 36-nm pseudo repeat of the track. Myosin Va consists of two identical heavy chains that dimerize through the formation of a coiled-coil structure to form a homodimer. At the N terminus is the motor domain containing the ATP and actin binding sites. The motor domain is followed by a neck that consists of six IQ motifs with the consensus sequence IQXXXRGXXXR, which act as the binding sites for calmodulins or myosin light chains. The next ∼500 amino acids are predicted to form a series of coiled-coils separated by several flexible regions. The last ∼400 amino acids form a globular tail domain (3Cheney R.E. O'Shea M.K.

Bowers B. Wei Q. Kocher B. Hammer 3rd., J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 847-859Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One of the most important questions is how the motor function of myosin Va is regulated. If myosin Va were constantly active, then the high concentrations of myosin Va found in brain (3Cheney R.E. O'Shea M.K. Heuser J.E. Coelho M.V. Wolenski J.S. Espreafico E.M. Forscher P. Larson R.E.

Therefore, it is desirable that the mechanoenzymatic activities of myosin Va is regulated in vivo. However, the molecular mechanism of myosin Va regulation is not well understood.

Sedimentation velocity analysis showed that the myosin Va undergoes a Ca2+-induced conformational transition from 14 S to 11 S (12Wang F. Thirumurugan K. Stafford W.F. Hammer 3rd, J.A. Knight P.J.

Electron microscopy revealed that at low ionic strength, myosin Va has an extended conformation in high Ca2+ whereas it forms a folded shape in the presence of EGTA, in which the tail domain is folded back toward the head (12Wang F.

The conformational transition is closely correlated with activation of the actin-activated ATPase activity of myosin Va (13Li X.D. Mabuchi K. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

These results suggest that the tail domain plays a key role in the Ca2+-dependent regulation of myosin Va, by inhibiting the ATPase of the head (12Wang F. Thirumurugan K. Stafford W.F.

In this model, myosin Va in the inhibited state is in a folded conformation such that the tail domain interacts with and inhibits the myosin Va motor activity. Cargo binding, high Ca2+, and/or phosphorylation may reduce the interaction between the head and tail domains, thus activating its activity. Consistent with this model, we recently found that the actin-activated ATPase activity of melanocyte-type myosin Va is significantly activated by the binding of melanophilin (17Li X.D. Ikebe R.

Because myosin Va binds to melanophilin through its tail domain, we proposed that this interaction interferes with the interaction between the tail and head domains of myosin Va, thus relieving the inhibitory effect of the tail domain (17Li X.D. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17815-17822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In this study, we further investigated the molecular mechanism of the regulation of the motor activity of myosin Va. Our results indicate that the C-terminal globular tail domain of myosin Va directly binds to the head domain, thus inhibiting motor function. Furthermore, our results suggest that the lengths of the neck domain and the first long coiled-coil domain structurally coordinate the binding between the head and the tail domains, and thus are critical for the regulation of myosin Va motor activity. Materials—Restriction enzymes and modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), unless indicated otherwise. Pfu Ultra High-Fidelity DNA polymerase was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA).

Myosin Va Expression Vectors—Murine melanocyte-type myosin Va (McM5), was subcloned into baculovirus transfer vector pFastBac (Invitrogen) as described before (13Li X.D. Mabuchi K. Ikebe R. Ikebe M.

To facilitate the purification, an N-terminal tag (MSYYH HHHHH DYKDD DDKNI PTTEN LYFQG AMGIR NSKAY VDELT SPA), containing a sequence of His6 tag and FLAG tag, was added to McM5. C-terminal-truncated myosin Va were produced by introducing a stop codon at various nucleotide sites of McM5 (Fig. 1). M5S1-LZ1 was produced by replacing the last 33 residues (Tyr943–Glu975) of M5-975 with the 32 residues of GCN4 leucine zipper (MKQLEDK VEELLSK NYHLENE VARLKKL VGER) by using overlapping PCR. GTD-deleted myosin Va with internal deletions, including McM5ΔTΔ2, McM5ΔTΔ3, McM5ΔTΔ4, McM5ΔTΔIQ12, McM5ΔTΔIQ34 McM5ΔTΔIQ56, McM5ΔTΔIQ34Δ49aa, McM5ΔTΔ42aa, and McM5ΔTΔIQ34Δ42aa, were produced by overlapping PCR as described previously (17Li X.D.

The cDNA coding the GTD (Gly1468–Val1877) was constructed by conventional PCR and subcloned in-frame to pFastBacHTb (Invitrogen). An N-terminal tag (MSYYH HHHHH DNIPT TENLY FQGAM GS) containing His6 tag was added to GTD. Recombinant baculoviruses were prepared as described previously (13Li X.D. Mabuchi K. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 315: 538-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of Myosin Va Constructs—GTD was expressed in Sf9 cells and purified by Ni-NTA-agarose affinity chromatography and size-exclusion chromatography. To express GTD, 400 ml of Sf9 cells (suspension culture) was infected with baculovirus expressing GTD, and cultured in 1 liter of medium at 27 °C for 3 days. After harvesting and washing with 4 mm EGTA in TBS (0.15 M NaCl, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), the cell pellets were lysed with sonication in 50 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 15 mm imidazole-HCl, pH7.5, 0.3 m NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.02% NaN3, 5 mm ATP, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.2 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor (Egg), and 0.5% Triton X-100). After centrifugation at 120,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant was incubated with 4.0 ml of Ni-NTA-agarose affinity resin in a 50-ml conical tube on a rotating wheel in a cold room for 2 h. The resin suspension was then loaded on a column (1 × 10 cm) and washed with 30 ml of solution A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 15 mm imidazole-HCl pH7.5, 0.3 m NaCl, 0.2 mm EGTA, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). The protein bound to the resin was eluted with 0.25 m imidazole in solution A. SDS-PAGE showed that the eluate from the Ni-NTA-agarose column contained two bands with apparent molecular masses of 100 kDa and 50 kDa (Fig. 2A). The calculated molecular mass of GTD is 50 kDa. It therefore appeared that the lower and upper bands in SDS-PAGE might be monomeric and dimeric GTD, respectively. Western blot showed that both bands were recognized by anti-His antibody and anti-M5T antibody (Fig. 2C). To separate the two bands, the eluate from Ni-NTA-agarose chromatography was subjected to size-exclusion chromatography. About 4 ml of the eluate from Ni-NTA-agarose was loaded onto a Sephacryl S-300 column (1.5 × 60 cm) pre-equilibrated with Solution D (0.2 m NaCl, 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT). The fractions 30–54 (1.5 ml per fraction) were collected and subjected to SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2B). The fractions containing high concentrations of monomeric GTD were pooled. The concentration of GTD was determined by the absorbance at 280 nm (1 A280 equal to 1.35 mg/ml GTD). About 10 mg of monomeric GTD could be obtained in one preparation. The nature of the putative “dimeric GTD” is not clear. Because there are 8 cysteine residues in GTD, we suspected that some GTD might have dimerized by cross-linking through intermolecular disulfide bonds. However, the migration of the “dimeric GTD” in SDS-PAGE did not change even when it was treated with high concentrations of reducing reagents (0.1 m 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 m DTT, or 25 mm TCEP, data not shown). In size-exclusion chromatography (Fig. 2B), the dimeric GTD eluted far ahead of IgG (molecular mass of 150 kDa), suggesting that it may be an oligomer of dimeric GTD. Whatever the nature of the 100-kDa band, all following experiments were done with the monomeric GTD. Full-length myosin Va and the truncated mutants were expressed in Sf9 cells by co-infection with recombinant baculovirus expressing myosin Va and calmodulin. Expressed myosin Va was purified by anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel as described previously (13Li X.D. Mabuchi K. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 315: 538-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), except that the purified myosin Va samples were dialyzed against 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5 at 20 °C), 0.2 m NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, and 10% sucrose on ice overnight. The purified myosin Va samples, in an aliquot of 100 μlin PCR tube, were quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. The concentration of myosin Va was determined by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 staining of SDS-PAGE gels (7.5–20%) using smooth muscle myosin heavy chain as a standard as described previously (13Li X.D. Mabuchi K. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 315: 538-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To calculate the molar concentration of the expressed protein, the following molecular masses (in kDa) were used: 224 (McM5), 177 (McM5ΔT), 149 (M5-1234), 135 (M5-1105), 128 (M5-1047), 114 (M5-975), 114 (M5-928), 119 (M5S1-LZ1), 176 (McM5ΔTΔ2), 170 (McM5ΔTΔ3), 165 (McM5ΔTΔ4), 171 (McM5ΔTΔIQ12), 171 (McM5ΔTΔIQ34) 171 (McM5ΔTΔIQ56), 172 (McM5ΔT Δ49aa), 172 (McM5ΔTΔ42aa), 166 (McM5ΔTΔIQ34Δ49aa), 166 (McM5ΔTΔIQ34Δ42aa), and 50 (GTD). Electron Microscopy—Rotary metal-shadowing electron microscopy of myosin Va was performed as described previously (13Li X.D. Mabuchi K. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 315: 538-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Briefly, myosin Va samples, diluted to about 4 nm in EGTA-600 solution (1 mm MgCl2, 30% glycerol, 1 mm EGTA, 600 mm ammonium acetate, pH 7.0), were absorbed onto a freshly cleaved mica surface for 30 s. Unbound proteins were rinsed away, and then the specimen was stabilized by brief exposure to uranyl acetate (26Mabuchi K. J. Struct. Biol. 1990; 103: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) before shadowing. For negative staining, full-length or truncated myosin Va was diluted to 20 nm with 0.15 m sodium acetate, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MOPS (pH 7.0) at room temperature. Five microliters of the solution were applied to UV-treated or glow-discharged, carbon-coated grids, and immediately stained with 1% uranyl acetate (27Burgess S.A. Walker M.L. Thirumurugan K. Trinick J. Knight P.J. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 147: 247-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The same procedure was used for the specimens made by mixing 20 nm truncated myosin Va with 2 μm GTD for 10 min. Negatively stained grids were examined in a CM120 electron microscope (FEI, Hillsboro, OR), fitted with an anti-contamination device cooled by liquid nitrogen, and operated at 120 kV. Micrographs were recorded on an F224HD slow scan CCD camera (TVIPS, Gauting, Germany) at a magnification of 65,000 (0.37 nm/pixel). Other Assays—The ATPase activity of myosin Va was measured using an ATP regeneration system at 25 °C as described before (13Li X.D. Mabuchi K. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 315: 538-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Reaction solution, except ATP, was mixed and preincubated at 25 °C for 10 min before adding ATP to start the reaction. SDS-PAGE and Western blot were as described previously (13Li X.D. Mabuchi K. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 315: 538-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Exogenous GTD Inhibits the ATPase Activity of GTD-deleted Myosin Va (McM5ΔT)—As described in the introduction, the actin-activated ATPase activity of truncated myosin Va without the C-terminal GTD is not regulated by Ca2+, whereas that of full-length myosin Va is (15Homma K. Saito J. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34766-34771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 16Wang F. Chen L. Arcucci O. Harvey E.V. Bowers B. Xu Y. Hammer 3rd, J.A. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4329-4335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Regulation is abolished by deleting just the GTD (the construct of McM5ΔT, see Fig. 1) (14Krementsov D.N. Krementsova E.B. Trybus K.M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the GTD is necessary to inhibit the actin-activated ATPase activity of myosin Va. To determine whether exogenous GTD inhibits the function of the myosin Va motor domain, we measured the actin-activated ATPase activity of McM5ΔT (Fig. 1) in the presence of exogenous GTD. The inhibition of ATPase activity was dose-dependent, and the apparent affinity between McM5ΔT and GTD was 0.88 μm (Fig. 3A). The actin-activated ATPase activity of McM5ΔT in the presence of 8 μm GTD was similar to that of full-length myosin Va under EGTA conditions, which was 1.75 head−1 s−1 under similar conditions (13Li X.D. Mabuchi K. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 315: 538-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), suggesting that McM5ΔT was changed to an inhibited state in the presence of exogenous GTD. Similar to full-length myosin Va, the activity of McM5ΔT was not inhibited by GTD under high Ca2+ conditions (Fig. 3A). The inhibitory effect of GTD on McM5ΔT was very sensitive to ionic strength. As shown in Fig. 3B, with an increase of NaCl from 100 mm to 400 mm, the ATPase activity of McM5ΔT in the absence of GTD sharply decreased, whereas that of McM5ΔT in the presence of GTD was bell-shaped with an increase in ionic strength. Overall, the inhibitory effect of GTD on McM5ΔT decreases with an increase in ionic strength. When the NaCl concentration is over 300 mm, GTD has virtually no inhibitory effect. These results suggest that GTD-dependent inhibition of the ATPase activity of McM5ΔT depends on ionic interaction. The First Long Coiled-coil Segment Is Essential for Inhibition of the ATPase Activity of Myosin Va Motor Domain—The motor domain and neck of myosin Va are connected to the GTD by a series of coiled-coil domains interrupted by a number of flexible regions (Fig. 1). The number and length of predicted coiled-coils varies among different isoforms of myosin Va. For McM5, five coiled-coils separated by four flexible regions are predicted by Paircoil (28Berger B. Wilson D.B. Wolf E. Tonchev T. Milla M. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8259-8263Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). To investigate which portion of the tail domain is essential for regulation by GTD, we made a series of C-terminal truncation mutants of myosin Va (Fig. 1), and examined the inhibitory effect of GTD on the actin-activated ATPase activity of the constructs. As shown in Fig. 4, the ATPase activity of M5-1234 was potently inhibited by GTD with an apparent affinity of 1.2 μm, which is similar to that of McM5ΔT. The inhibition of the actin-activated ATPase activity of M5-1105 by GTD was slightly less than that of M5-1234. By contrast, the actin-activated ATPase activities of M5-928, M5-975, and M5-1047 were not effectively inhibited by GTD. These results indicate that the first long coiled-coil (coil-1) is critical for regulation, whereas the distal tail portion, i.e. coil-2 to coil-5, is not essential for inhibition by GTD. These results could be explained in three ways. The first is that the specific sequence of the C-terminal portion of coil-1 is essential for regulation by GTD. Second, the double-headed structure is critical for regulation and deletion of the C-terminal portion of coil-1 destabilizes the double-headed structure. Third, the length of coil-1 is critical for GTD-induced inhibition of myosin Va. To examine whether the regulation of truncated myosin Va is related to the double-headed state, we visualized the molecules by rotary metal-shadowing electron microscopy. We found that the majority of the molecules of McM5ΔT, M5-1234, M5-1105, and M5-1047 were double-headed, whereas about 75% of M5-975 and most of M5-928 were single-headed (Fig. 5). These results suggest that single-headed myosin Va S1 is not regulated. On the other hand, although both M5-1105 and M5-1047 are mostly double-headed, GTD markedly inhibited the actin-activated ATPase activity of M5-1105, but only marginally inhibited that of M5-1047, suggesting that the double-headed structure is not sufficient for the regulation by GTD.FIGURE 5Rotary-shadowing electron microscopy of various truncated myosin Va.

The arrowheads in A indicate the small globular domain at the end of the tail of McM5ΔT. The length of the stalk of McM5ΔT is 30.5 ± 4.8 nm (n = 72), and that of the tail of M5-1105 is 31.3 ± 2.5 nm (n = 51). Scale bar: 100 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further clarify the role of the double-headed structure, we constructed M5S1-LZ1, an artificially dimerized myosin Va S1, by replacing the C-terminal 33 amino acid residues of M5-975 with 32 amino acid residues of leucine zipper, producing a continuous, in-register coiled-coil (Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 5G, the majority of M5S1-LZ1 molecules are double-headed. However, the actin-activated ATPase activity of M5S1-LZ1 is not effectively inhibited by GTD, being similar to that of M5-975 (Fig. 4), indicating that the double-headed structure is not sufficient for the regulation of myosin Va by GTD. To investigate the role of the coil-1/hinge region on the regulation of myosin Va, we produced three McM5ΔT constructs with various deletions in this region (Fig. 1). Deletion of 1048–1059 (McM5ΔTΔ2) moderately decreased the inhibitory effect of GTD on the ATPase activity, whereas deletion of 1048–1105 (McM5ΔTΔ3) or 1048–1150 (McM5ΔTΔ4) essentially eliminated the inhibitory effect of GTD (Fig. 6). The results support the idea that the C-terminal portion of coil-1 is important for GTD-induced inhibition of ATPase activity.

Activation of the receptor induced a very rapid and transient activation of R-Ras. Studies with inhibitors and activators of various signaling pathways indicated that R-Ras activation by the M3 mAChR is dependent on cyclic AMP formation but is independent of protein kinase A. Similar to the rather promiscuous M3 mAChR, two typical Gs-coupled receptors also induced R-Ras activation. The receptor actions were mimicked by an Epac-specific cyclic AMP analog and suppressed by depletion of endogenous Epac1 by small interfering RNAs, as well as expression of a cyclic AMP binding-deficient Epac1 mutant, but not by expression of dominant negative Rap GTPases. In vitro studies demonstrated that Epac1 directly interacts with R-Ras and catalyzes GDP/GTP exchange at this GTPase. Finally, it is shown that the cyclic AMP- and Epac-activated R-Ras plays a major role in the M3 mAChR-mediated stimulation of phospholipase D but not phospholipase C. Collectively, our data indicate that GPCRs rapidly activate R-Ras, that R-Ras activation by the GPCRs is apparently directly induced by cyclic AMP-regulated Epac proteins, and that activated R-Ras specifically controls GPCR-mediated phospholipase D stimulation.

In addition, in vitro interaction of R-Ras with several Ras regulatory proteins, including various guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), has been reported (5Cullen P.J.

Despite these similarities, studies in different cell types demonstrated that R-Ras has biological functions distinct from classic H-Ras. Notably, although H-Ras inhibits cell adhesion in fibroblasts by reducing the affinity of integrins for their ligands, R-Ras has been shown to promote integrin activation (7Kinbara K. Goldfinger L.E. Hansen M. Chou F.-L. Ginsberg M.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 767-776Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Zhang Z. Vuori K. Wang H. Reed J.C. Ruoslahti E.

Recently, it has been proposed that R-Ras might enhance integrin-mediated cell attachment and spreading through alterations in the cellular Ca2+ handling, by decreasing the Ca2+ content of the endoplasmic reticulum (12Koopman W.J.H. Bosch R.R. van Emst-de Vries S.E. Spaargaren M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Willems P.H.G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13672-13679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The capacity of R-Ras to modulate cell adhesion by maintaining integrin activity can be regulated by phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue in its effector domain by an Eph receptor kinase (13Zou J.X. Wang B. Kalo M.S. Zisch A.H. Pasquale E.B. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13813-13818Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, it has been reported that Eph receptor signaling to R-Ras is controlled by tyrosine phosphorylation of R-Ras by the Src kinase on tyrosine 66, and by binding of R-Ras to the Src homology 2 domain-containing Eph receptor-binding protein SHEP1, which binds in addition to the Ras-related GTPase Rap1A (14Dodelet V.C.

J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1824-1827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Notably, Rap1 has been shown to play a key role in the regulation of several aspects of cell adhesion, in particular in integrin-mediated cell adhesion (16Bos J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), and thus R-Ras might modulate integrin signaling in concert with Rap GTPases. Other studies have shown that the semaphorin 4D receptor, plexin-B1, can down-regulate R-Ras activity by acting as an R-Ras-specific GAP in the presence of the Rho family member Rnd1, and thereby suppresses integrin activation and cell adhesion (17Oinuma I. Ishikawa Y. Katoh H. Negishi M. Science. 2004; 305: 862-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent studies in different cell types demonstrated that R-Ras is involved in control of cell migration, apparently through spatio-temporal regulation of Rho and Rac activities (18Wozniak M.A. Kwong L. Chodniewicz D. Klemke R.L. Keely P.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 84-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 19Jeong H.-W. Nam J.-O. Kim I.-S.

In a recently generated R-Ras-null mouse, increased proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells and enhanced angiogenesis was observed (21Komatsu M. Ruoslahti E. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 1346-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar).Despite the increasing evidence that R-Ras is obviously a key regulator of several cellular processes, our knowledge about the mechanisms leading to activation of R-Ras is very limited. In particular, it should be mentioned that in most studies the biological function of R-Ras was analyzed by ectopically expressing constitutively active or dominant negative R-Ras mutants. Activation of R-Ras, i.e. GTP loading, is catalyzed by several distinct GEFs, comprising about 20 distinct proteins (5Cullen P.J. Lockyer P.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 6Quilliam L.A. Rebhun J.F. Castro A.F. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

Of note, there is no report on a GEF that is specific for R-Ras. For example, the Ca2+/diacylglycerol-regulated GEFs, RasGRP1–3, have been reported to activate R-Ras, H-Ras, and Rap1 (22Ohba Y. Mochizuki N. Yamashita S. Chan A.M. Schrader J.W. Hattori S. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. J. Biol.

It should be emphasized, however, that none of these studies addressed the question whether activation of R-Ras by these GEFs is triggered by specific membrane receptors.The aim of this report was to study whether and by which mechanisms G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) activate R-Ras and to define a biological function of R-Ras in the GPCR actions. For this, we used the M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) stably expressed in HEK-293 cells. Numerous studies have demonstrated that this prototypical GPCR can couple to all major subtypes of heterotrimeric G proteins, not only to Gq proteins, as initially assumed (26Peralta E.G.

By this distinct G protein coupling, the M3 mAChR can lead to the regulation of various effector enzymes, including phospholipase C (PLC), phospholipase D (PLD), and adenylyl cyclase, and activation of small GTPases from distinct families (26Peralta E.G.

Here we report that the M3 mAChR strongly activates R-Ras, that this activation requires endogenously expressed cyclic AMP-activated Epac1 proteins as shown by silencing of cellular Epac1 using siRNAs, and that this cellular response is mimicked by typical Gs-coupled receptors.

Densitometric analysis of the bands was performed with ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). For measurement of VASP phosphorylation, serum-starved HEK-293 cells were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C with 30 μm forskolin, followed by cell lysis in a buffer containing 1% SDS and 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, and five passages through a 25-gauge needle. Thereafter, the lysates were clarified by centrifugation, followed by determination of protein concentration and incubation in Laemmli buffer for 10 min at 95 °C.

To obtain the soluble and untagged proteins, the immobilized proteins were proteolytically digested by thrombin (Rap2B, ΔDEP Epac1), factor Xa (R-Ras) or eluted with 400 mm imidazole (C3G). For protease digestion, the washed beads were resuspended in thrombin buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.6, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol) or factor Xa buffer (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 6.5 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 8.8 mm CaCl2, pH 7.2), respectively, and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with thrombin or factor Xa (followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C).

Thereafter, MgCl2 was added to a final concentration of 5 mm, and the incubation was continued for a further 20 min. Finally, purified ΔDEP Epac1 or C3G-(830–1078) equilibrated for 15 min in exchange buffer, containing 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 80 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm AMP-PNP, and 10 mm GTP, was added in the absence (C3G-(830–1078)) or presence of 1 mm 8-Br-cAMP(ΔDEP Epac1), and the reaction was continued for the indicated periods of time. Bound and free [3H]GDP were separated by adding 1.5 ml of washing buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 8 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.05% 2-mercaptoethanol) and filtration through nitrocellulose filters. The ratio of GEF protein to the GTPases in the exchange assays typically was 1:1, as assessed from the protein bands of Coomassie-stained gels.Protein Binding Assays—Serum-starved HEK-293 cells transfected with wild-type Epac1 were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml benzamidine, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin. Nucleotide-free, GDP-bound, and GTPγS-bound forms of recombinant GST-tagged R-Ras, Rap2B, and ARF1, immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads, were prepared exactly as described (38Lutz S.

Thereafter, the beads (5–10 or 50 μg of protein) were incubated with lysates of the transfected cells (3–4 mg of protein) or purified ΔDEP Epac1 (50 μg of protein) overnight at 4 °C. Finally, after three washes, the beads were resolved in Laemmli buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose for Western blotting, using anti-Epac1 antibodies as indicated.Immunoblot Analysis—For detection of R-Ras, phospho-VASP, VASP (each at a dilution of 1:500), and Epac1 (dilution of 1:1000–1:10,000), equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% acrylamide gels. After transfer to nitrocellulose membranes and a 1-h incubation with the antibodies at the above given dilution factors, the proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence.Generation of HEK-293 Cells Stably Expressing Retroviral Encoded siRNA Epac1—siRNA molecules targeted against Epac1 were delivered to HEK-293 cells by retroviral transfer as described (39Barton G.M. Medzhitov R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14943-14945Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. First, the human H1 promoter, suitable for expression of short RNA molecules, was cloned by PCR from genomic DNA using the primers 5′-CGCGGTCGACATGGAAATCGAACGCTGACGTCATCAACCCGCTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CGCGGTCGACCTCGAGGCGCTTCGAAGTGGTCTCATACAGAACTTATAAGATTCC-3′ (reverse). This construct contains two artificial restriction sites for XhoI and Bsp119I for site-directed insertion of the respective siRNA constructs, including suitable transcription stop signals. The entire construct was sequenced and cloned into the SalI site within the 3′-long terminal repeat of the pQCXIH vector (Clontech). This vector contains a hygromycin resistance gene under the control of a cytomegalo-virus promoter followed by an internal ribosome entry site as well as enhanced green fluorescent protein sequence. siRNA sequences targeted against human Epac1 were designed according to current algorithms and consisted of the cDNA of the target transcript followed by nine nucleotides hairpin sequences and the reverse sequence. For human Epac1 (GenBank™ accession number NM_006105), the entire sequences were 5′-CGAACCCGGCACTTCGTGGTACATTATTCAAGAGATAATGTACCACGAAGTGCCTTTTTGGAAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCGAGTTCCAAAAAGGCACTTCGTGGTACATTATCTCTTGAATAATGTACCACGAAGTGCCGGGTT-3′ (reverse). Two oligonucleotides (0.06 μg/μl, final concentration) encoding these sequences were annealed in a stepwise process for 4 min at 90 °C, 10 min at 70 °C, 5 min at 62 °C, 5 min at 37 °C, 5 min at 25 °C, and 5 min at 10 °C in 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4. After hybridization the construct was ligated into the XhoI/Bsp119I site of the modified pQCXIH vector. All vector constructs used were sequence-verified. Packaging GP2–293 cells (Clontech) were co-transfected with the respective pQCXIH-siRNA vector and the pVSV-G plasmid (encoding the envelope protein of the vesicular stomatitis virus) by calcium-phosphate transfection. Supernatants were harvested and ultracentrifuged for enrichment of recombinant retroviruses. M3 mAChR-expressing HEK-293 cells were infected with the recombinant retroviruses for 24 h at 37 °C, and infection was monitored by fluorescent microscopy detection of enhanced green fluorescent protein. Stably infected cells were further selected by incubation with 200 μg/ml hygromycin. Epac1 transcripts were measured by quantitative real time PCR using the fluorescent dye SYBR Green. Total RNA samples were obtained using the NucleoSpin RNA II kit, including a DNA digestion step (Macherey-Nagel) according to the manufacturer's instructions. As control, cells infected with retroviruses lacking a siRNA insert were used. Reverse transcription was done with an oligo(dT)15 primer and 1 μg of RNA using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Quantitative PCR was performed by monitoring the fluorescence of the SYBR Green dye (Platinum SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix UDG; Invitrogen) on a 7500 real time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Applied primer pairs were specific for the sequences of Epac1 (5′-AGTTTCCCACCTCCACGAGGAC-3′; 5′-ACATAAGCCCAGGTGCTGGCTG-3′) and the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (5′-GGCGATGCTGGCGCTGAGT-3′; 5′-CATGGTTCACACCCATGACGA-3′), which was used for normalization. The relative transcription level of the EPAC1 gene in siRNA expressing cells compared with vector controls is expressed as ΔCT values (40Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods (Orlando). 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref Scopus (119255) Google Scholar).Data Presentation—Data shown in the figures are either representative experiments or the mean ± S.E. of n independent experiments, each performed in triplicate. Comparisons between means were either with the Student's paired t test or one-way analysis of variance test, and a difference was regarded significant at p < 0.05.RESULTSActivation of R-Ras by the M3 mAChR—The M3 mAChR stably expressed in HEK-293 cells can couple to several types of heterotrimeric G proteins, thereby leading to stimulation of various effector enzymes and activation of small GTPases from different families (26Peralta E.G.

https://openalex.org/W1549843892,"Signal transduction through G alpha(q) involves stimulation of phospholipase C beta (PLC beta) that results in increased intracellular Ca2+ and activation of protein kinase C. We have measured complex formation between G alpha(q) and PLC beta1 in vitro and in living PC12 and HEK293 cells by fluorescence resonance energy transfer. In vitro measurements show that PLC beta1 will bind to G alpha(q)(guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate) and also to G alpha(q)(GDP), and the latter association has a different protein-protein orientation. In cells, image analysis of fluorescent-tagged proteins shows that G alpha(q) is localized almost entirely to the plasma membrane, whereas PLC beta1 has a significant cytosolic population. By using fluorescence resonance energy transfer, we found that these proteins are pre-associated in the unstimulated state in PC12 and HEK293 cells. By determining the cellular levels of the two proteins in transfected versus nontransfected cells, we found that under our conditions overexpression should not significantly promote complex formation. G alpha(q)-PLC beta1 complexes are observed in both single cell measurements and measurements of a large (i.e. 10(6)) cell suspension. The high level (approximately 40% maximum) of FRET is surprising considering that G alpha(q) is more highly expressed than PLC beta1 and that not all PLC beta1 is plasma membrane-localized. Our measurements suggest a model in which G proteins and effectors can exist in stable complexes prior to activation and that activation is achieved through changes in intermolecular interactions rather than diffusion and association. These pre-formed complexes in turn give rise to rapid, localized signals."

Many neurotransmitters are removed from the synaptic cleft by transporters, which thereby enable efficient synaptic transmission. Many of these transporters are sodium- and chloride-dependent and form a family which, besides the transporters for γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), 2The abbreviations used are: GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; TM, transmembrane domain; MTS, methanethiosulfonate; MTSET, [2-(trimethylammonium) ethyl-]methanethiosulfonate; MTSES, (2-sulfonatoethyl)methanethiosulfonate.2The abbreviations used are: GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; TM, transmembrane domain; MTS, methanethiosulfonate; MTSET, [2-(trimethylammonium) ethyl-]methanethiosulfonate; MTSES, (2-sulfonatoethyl)methanethiosulfonate. also includes those for serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, and glycine (for reviews, see Refs. 1Kanner B.I.

The role of chloride in this process is still under debate because it has been suggested that during sodium-coupled GABA transport, obligatory chlorideout/chloridein exchange takes place (9Loo D.D.

In contrast to sodium, lithium cannot support transport of [3H]GABA (10Bennett E.R. Su H. Kanner B.I. J. Biol.

Zeuthen T. Gether U. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 544: 447-458Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In the absence of GABA, leak currents are observed when lithium replaces sodium. These leak currents have a much steeper voltage dependence than the GABA-induced transport currents observed in the presence of sodium (12Mager S. Kleinberger-Doron N. Keshet G.I. Davidson N. Kanner B.I. Lester H.A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5405-5414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Bismuth Y. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. J. Biol.

These lithium leak currents are inhibited by low concentrations of sodium ions, and this inhibition is not competitive. These observations indicate that when sodium binds to GAT-1, the leak mode is converted into a conformation that enables coupled transport (11MacAulay N. Zeuthen T. Gether U. J. Physiol.

Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar). The transporter consists of 12 transmembrane domains (TMs), with TMs 1-5 related to TMs 6-10 by a pseudo-2-fold axis in the membrane plane. Two sodium ions, Na1 and Na2, and a leucine molecule are occluded in this structure (15Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar). Although the overall sequence identity between the eukaryotic and prokaryotic counterparts is only 20-25%, there are clusters of high sequence conservation. These are distributed throughout the primary structure and include functionally important residues (reviewed in Ref. 15Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that the published structure may be a useful model to study the neurotransmitter transporter members of this family.In this study, we have investigated the possibility that one or more amino acid residues, which correspond to those that coordinate Na1 and Na2 in LeuTAa, participate in the interaction of lithium with GAT-1. This would provide an important initial clue toward understanding the structural basis of cation selectivity in neurotransmitter transporters. As a parent construct, we have used GAT-1 with cysteine 74 mutated to alanine (C74A). Transport by this mutant, which has similar properties as wild type GAT-1, is not inhibited by membrane-impermeant sulfhydryl residues (14Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3705-3712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 16Zhou Y. Bennett E.R. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13800-13808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Our results provide evidence for the idea that the architecture of the sodium binding sites in GAT-1 is similar, but not identical, to that of LeuTAa. The sodium binding site of GAT-1 that corresponds to Na1 is highly specific, whereas the ability of lithium to substitute for sodium at the other sodium binding site and to mediate leak currents by the transporter is controlled by aspartate 395.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneration and Subcloning of Mutants—Mutations were made by site-directed mutagenesis of the wild type GAT-1 in the vector pBluescript SK(-) (Stratagene) according to the Kunkel method as described (17Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4544) Google Scholar, 18Kleinberger-Doron N. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3063-3067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the parent DNA was used to transform Escherichia coli CJ236 (dut-, ung-). From one of the transformants, single-stranded uracil-containing DNA was isolated upon growth in uridine-containing medium according to the standard protocol from Stratagene using helper phage R408. This yields the sense strand, and consequently, mutagenic primers were designed to be antisense. Mutants were subcloned into a construct containing C74A-GAT-1 in the pOG1 vector using two unique restriction enzymes. The pOG1 vector is an oocyte expression vector that contains a 5′-untranslated Xenopus β-globin sequence, the T7 RNA promoter, and a 3′-poly(A) signal. The coding and non-coding strands were sequenced between the two restriction sites.Cell Growth and Expression—HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 200 units/ml penicillin, 200 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine.

Oocytes were removed from anesthetized Xenopus laevis frogs and treated with collagenase (type 1A; Sigma number C-9891) until capillaries were absent and injected with 50 nl of undiluted cRNA on the same or the next day. Oocytes were maintained at 18 °C in modified Barth's saline containing the following (in mm): 88 NaCl, 1 KCl, 1 MgSO4, 2.4 NaHCO3, 1 CaCl2, 0.3 Ca(NO3)2, 10 HEPES, pH 7.5, with freshly added 2 mm sodium pyruvic acid and 0.5 mm theophylline, and supplemented with 10,000 units/liter penicillin, 10 mg/liter streptomycin, and 50 mg/liter gentamicin.Oocyte Electrophysiology—This was done as described (14Kanner B.I.

Oocytes were placed in the recording chamber, penetrated with two micropipettes (backfilled with 2 m KCl, resistance varied between 0.5 and 2 megaohms), and voltage-clamped using a GeneClamp 500 amplifier (Axon Instruments) and digitized using a Digidata 1200A (Axon Instruments), both controlled with the pClamp6 suite (Axon Instruments). Currents were acquired with Clampex 6.03 at 10 kHz every 0.5 ms and low pass-filtered online. The membrane potential of the oocytes was jumped from −140 mV to +60 mV in 25-mV increments, using −25 mV as holding potential, unless stated otherwise in the figure legends. Each potential was held clamped for 500 ms. The membrane potential was measured relative to an extracellular Ag/AgCl electrode in the recording chamber. Recording solution contained 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. In substitution experiments, sodium ions were replaced with equimolar choline or lithium (as indicated in the figure legends). Figures were prepared using Origin 6.1 (Microcal). The GABA-induced currents are defined as the currents in the absence of GABA subtracted from those in its presence (at the concentrations indicated in the figure legends). In those experiments, in which the effect of the impermeant sulfhydryl reagents MTSET or MTSES was analyzed, this was done exactly as described (21Borre L. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13501-13507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).Homology Modeling—Figures were prepared using the Deep-View Swiss-PDB viewer downloaded from the ExPASy Proteomics Server. Homology modeling of the Na2 binding site of GAT-1 based on the LeuTAa structure (accession code 2A65) was performed using the Tripos Sybyl7.0 computational software. Initially, modeling of the Na2 binding pocket was carried out for amino acid residues located within 6 Å from the sodium ion for greater precision, and afterward, energy minimization of the wild type and D395T were carried out for amino acid residues within a distance of 4 Å from the Na2 ion and compared. Energy computation and minimization were performed using the Powell method with Simplex initial optimization, Tripos force field, Gasteiger-Huckel charges, and a constant dielectric function.RESULTSIon Dependence of GABA Transport by Putative Na2 Site Mutants—The GABA (1 mm)-induced transport currents by oocytes expressing C74A at various sodium concentrations are shown in Fig. 1A. When lithium was the substituting ion, the GABA-induced currents reached saturation at lower Na+ concentrations than when choline replaced sodium. In the presence of lithium, the transport currents at 2 mm sodium were approximately half of those at 96 mm, whereas this value increased to about 18 mm in its absence (Fig. 1A). Although the results shown are for currents recorded at −140 mV, similar results were also obtained at the other potentials analyzed, −40 and −90 mV, and similar results were also obtained with wild type GAT-1 (data not shown). In the LeuTAa structure, Na2 is coordinated by three main chain carbonyl oxygens and the hydroxyl oxygens from the TM8 residues threonine 354 and serine 355 (15Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar). The equivalents of these latter two residues in GAT-1 are aspartate 395 and serine 396, respectively. Significant transport currents were observed by the mutants in which aspartate 395 was replaced by serine or threonine, D395S or D395T, respectively. However, with the D395S/C74A and D395T/C74A mutants, no stimulation of the transport currents by lithium was observed (Fig. 1, B and C). Importantly, the sodium concentration dependence of the GABA-induced currents by these mutants in the presence of either choline or lithium was almost the same as that for C74A in the presence of choline (Fig. 1, A-C). Similar results were also observed when these mutants were in the background of wild type GAT-1 (data not shown). In the case of D395C, a very minor stimulation by lithium, much smaller than in the case of C74A, was seen (Fig. 1, A and D). For this mutant, GABA was used at 10 mm rather than at 1 mm because its Km at −140 mV and 96 mm sodium was ∼400 μm, which is ∼2.5-fold of that in D395S/C74A and D395T/C74A and ∼8-fold that of C74A (Table 1). However, the value of Km is also dependent on the sodium concentration (22Radian R. Kanner B.I. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 1236-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). At 20 mm sodium, the Km for GABA in the D395S/C74A mutant was 478 ± 40 μm. Therefore, we also analyzed the currents induced by 10 mm GABA in the D395S/C74A and D395T/C74A mutants, and the results were similar to those depicted in Fig. 1, B and C (data not shown). Transport currents by the D395C/C74A mutant were not affected by preincubation of the oocytes with the membrane-impermeant sulfhydryl reagents MTSET or MTSES (data not shown). The D395E mutant was inactive (data not shown), but the D395N/C74A mutant exhibited GABA-induced transport currents, which were also not stimulated by lithium (Fig. 1E).TABLE 1Kinetic parameters for GABA transport in GAT-1 mutants Km and Vmax were calculated from linear regression using the Lineweaver-Burk plot.KmaThe Km values for GABA measuring the GABA-induced transport currents at −140 mV and 96 mm sodiumImaxbImax is given as a range because of variations in expression levels between various batches of oocytes and also sometimes within a given batchKmcThe Km values for GABA measuring initial rates of [3H]-GABA transport in HeLa cells at 150 mm sodium (3-min time points performed in triplicates) using 24-well platesVmaxμmnAμm(pmol·min−1 (mg of protein−1))C74A56 ± 4408 ± 645.5 ± 0.5343 ± 38N327A/C74A3.7 ± 1.018 ± 1N327C/C74A0.6 ± 0.14 ± 1D395S/C74A173 ± 13271 ± 64D395T/C74A153 ± 12328 ± 50D395C/C74A407 ± 54258 ± 27D395N/C74A1076 ± 180481 ± 82S396T/C74A6652 ± 1072331 ± 46S396C/C74A1277 ± 127167 ± 21S295A/C74A3693 ± 448154 ± 71S295T/C74A53 ± 3156 ± 22a The Km values for GABA measuring the GABA-induced transport currents at −140 mV and 96 mm sodiumb Imax is given as a range because of variations in expression levels between various batches of oocytes and also sometimes within a given batchc The Km values for GABA measuring initial rates of [3H]-GABA transport in HeLa cells at 150 mm sodium (3-min time points performed in triplicates) using 24-well plates Open table in a new tab In contrast to the transport currents induced by 1 mm GABA, when transport of [3H]GABA was measured in HeLa cells expressing C74A (Fig. 2A), the stimulation by lithium was barely visible. This is in agreement with previous studies (10Bennett E.R. Su H. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34106-34113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A major difference between the experiments depicted in Figs. 1A and 2A is that, besides the expression system, the actual GABA concentration in the latter is 50 nm, ∼2 orders of magnitude below the Km for radioactive uptake at 150 mm sodium (Table 1). Indeed, when the GABA concentration was increased to 20 μm, a clear stimulation by lithium was observed (Fig. 2B). When transport of [3H]GABA was measured under the same conditions in HeLa cells expressing D395S/C74A or D395T/C74A, the stimulation by lithium was not observed (Fig. 2, C and D). Again, similar results were obtained when wild type GAT-1 was used as a background (data not shown). In contrast to transport currents, uptake of [3H]GABA could not be observed by the D395C/C74A mutant.FIGURE 2Sodium dependence of [3H]GABA transport. HeLa cells expressing C74A, D395S/C74A, or D395T/C74A GAT-1 were assayed for [3H]GABA transport as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Transport was carried out for 3 min at the indicated sodium concentrations with either choline (•) or lithium (▴) as the substituting ion. Data shown at the indicated Na+ concentrations are normalized to those at 150 mm Na+ (no choline or lithium substitution). GABA concentrations used were either 50 nm, 87 Ci/mmol (A)or 20 μm, 0.44 Ci/mmol (B-D). Values are averages (± S.E.) of at least three experiments each performed in triplicate. [3H]GABA uptake at 150 mm Na+ by D395S/C74A and D395T/C74A was 41.5 ± 7.8% and 31.0 ± 8.9%, respectively, of that by C74A, (n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)GABA-induced currents could be measured with oocytes expressing the S396T/C74A and S396C/C74A mutants (Fig. 3). In the case of S396T/C74A, the voltage dependence of these currents was similar to that of the GABA-induced currents by C74A shown in Fig. 4A (data not shown), indicating coupled transport. On the other hand, the voltage dependence of the GABA-induced currents by S396C/C74A was more similar to that of the lithium leak currents shown in Fig. 4B (data not shown), suggesting that perhaps GABA induces a sodium leak in this mutant rather than sodium-coupled GABA transport. The Km values for GABA in these two mutants were dramatically increased, ∼1.3 and 6.7 mm for S396C/C74A and S396T/C74A, respectively (Table 1). When the currents induced by 10 mm GABA were measured at varying sodium concentrations, a stimulation by lithium was observed (Fig. 3, A and B), although somewhat smaller than that observed in the case of C74A (Fig. 1A). The transport currents by S396C/C74A were not inhibited by preincubation of the oocytes with the membrane-impermeant sulfhydryl reagents MTSET or MTSES (data not shown). The S396T/C74A and S396C/C74A mutants did not exhibit any radioactive GABA transport (data not shown), apparently due to the high Km values of these mutants (Table 1). Radioactive uptake is measurable in the μm range (at higher concentrations, prohibitive amounts of radiolabel are needed), and due to the high Km, the transport rate at these concentrations would be an undetectably small fraction of Vmax.FIGURE 3Sodium dependence of GABA-induced currents by serine 396 mutants at −140 mV. Currents induced by 10 mm GABA were measured at −140 mV in oocytes expressing S396T/C74A (A) or S396C/C74A (B) at the indicated sodium concentrations as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Na+-substituting ions were either choline (•) or lithium (▴). Data are normalized to those obtained at 96 mm Na+ (no choline or lithium substitution). Data are averages of at least three oocytes ± S.E. The magnitudes of net GABA-induced currents (in nA) obtained in 96 mm Na+ at −140 mV by S396T/C74A and S396C/C74A were −330.8 ± 45.7 and −167.2 ± 20.7, respectively (n = 5).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 4Voltage dependence of GABA-induced currents and lithium leak currents.

A, GABA-induced currents in the presence of 96 mm sodium, normalized to those by oocytes expressing C74A measured at −140 mV.

Data are averages of three oocytes ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Lithium Leak Currents by Asp-395 Mutants—The voltage dependence of the sodium-dependent GABA currents by the Asp-395 mutants was more linear than in C74A (Fig. 4A), perhaps due to an altered interaction between the two sodium sites. The similar voltage dependence of the GABA-induced currents in the presence of sodium in the Asp-395 mutants indicates that also in D395C/C74A, these currents reflect coupled transport, which is difficult to detect using the radioactive uptake assay due to the increased Km for GABA. Not only were these coupled currents by the Asp-395 mutants lacking the stimulation by lithium, but the leak currents were also not observed in the presence of lithium (Fig. 4B). The same result was also observed with D395N (data not shown). On the other hand, the S396T and S396C mutants exhibited lithium leak currents that had similar voltage dependence to those by wild type GAT-1 (data not shown).Ion Dependence of GABA Transport by Putative Na1 Mutants—In the LeuTAa structure, Na1 is coordinated by two main chain carbonyl oxygens, the carboxyl oxygen of the transported leucine, the side chain carbonyl oxygens of asparagine 27 and asparagine 286, and the hydroxyl oxygen from threonine 254 (15Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar). The equivalents of the latter three residues in GAT-1 are asparagine 66, asparagine 327, and serine 295. As described previously (14Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3705-3712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 16Zhou Y. Bennett E.R. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13800-13808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), mutation of asparagine 66 of GAT-1 to glutamine, aspartate, or cysteine caused defective transport currents as well as the lack of measurable [3H]GABA transport. No transport currents could be observed by the asparagine 327 to alanine or cysteine mutants (data not shown). However, [3H]GABA transport, albeit diminished, could be measured in both mutants. The background in this assay is very low, ∼0.3-0.4% of the signal, so that the sodium dependence of a mutant that has 5% of the activity of the wild type can still be measured. Analysis of the kinetic parameters of [3H]GABA transport by these mutants at 150 mm sodium revealed a 20- and 80-fold reduction of Vmax in N327A and N327C, respectively (Table 1). This is apparently the reason for the lack of detectable transport currents by these mutants in the oocyte system because in this assay, 5% of wild type activity can only be detected in the best expressing batches of oocytes. The size of these currents reflects Vmax. In contrast to the transport currents in which unlabeled GABA is used and its concentration can be increased at will, radioactive uptake is performed at concentrations below Km and therefore depends both on Vmax and on Km. The Km values for GABA were 3.7 ± 1.0 and 0.6 ± 0.1 μm for N327A/C74A and N327C/C74A, respectively, as compared with 5.5 ± 0.5 μm for C74A (n = 3) (Table 1). In both mutants, transport of [3H]GABA was stimulated by lithium (Fig. 5, A and B). Similar results were also obtained with the more conserved mutants N327D and N327Q (data not shown). Transport by N327C was not inhibited by preincubation of the HeLa cells with MTSET or MTSES (data not shown). Regarding the Km values for GABA, it is important to note that they can only be compared at similar sodium concentrations and membrane potentials. Lowering the sodium concentration results in an increased Km (22Radian R. Kanner B.I. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 1236-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and at less negative membrane potentials, the values for Km decrease (7Mager S. Naeve J. Quick M. Labarca C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Neuron. 1993; 10: 177-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). These facts explain the relatively low Km value of ∼5 μm for radioactive uptake, measured at 150 mm sodium in HeLa cells expressing wild type GAT-1. The membrane potential in these cells infected with the recombinant Vaccinia virus is presumably not very negative. The Km in oocytes, expressing wild type GAT-1, at −140 mV and 96 mm sodium is ∼55 μm (Table 1).FIGURE 5Sodium dependence of [3H]GABA transport by asparagine 327 mutants. HeLa cells expressing N327A/C74A (A) or N327C/C74A (B) were assayed for [3H]GABA transport as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Transport was carried out for 3 min at the indicated sodium concentrations with either choline (•) or lithium (▴) as the substituting ion.

Expression of the adipogenic transcription factors, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) α and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), is lower in differentiating preadipocytes from old than young animals, although no age-related changes occur in C/EBPβ mRNA, which is upstream of C/EBPα and PPARγ.

With aging, preadipocyte CUGBP1 abundance and activity increases, resulting in enhanced translation of the C/EBPβ-LIP isoform, thereby blocking effects of adipogenic transcription factors, predisposing preadipocytes from old animals to resist adipogenesis.

Through middle age fat depot sizes increase. However, in advanced old age, fat depot sizes decrease, and fat becomes redistributed to tissues outside fat depots (1Bertrand H.A. Masoro E.J. Yu B.P.

Gerontol. 2002; 37: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The decline in fat depot mass is because of a decrease in fat cell size, as fat cell numbers are constant or increase in different depots with increasing age (1Bertrand H.A. Masoro E.J. Yu B.P. Science. 1978; 201: 1234-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 2Bertrand H.A. Lynd F.T. Masoro E.J. Yu B.P. J. Gerontol. 1980; 35: 827-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Because capacity for lipolysis decreases in fat cells with aging (4Yki-Jarvinen H. Kiviluoto T. Nikkila E.A. Acta Endocrinol. 1986; 113: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 5Gregerman R.I. J. Gerontol. 1994; 49: B135-B139Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), declines in capacity for lipid accumulation could be particularly important in contributing to reduced adipocyte size. New fat cells arise from preadipocytes throughout the life span, because new fat cells continue to appear from preadipocytes during adulthood, and preadipocytes are present in fat depots at all ages (1Bertrand H.A. Masoro E.J. Yu B.P. Science. 1978; 201: 1234-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 6Hollenberg C.H. Vost A. J. Clin. Investig. 1969; 47: 2485-2498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Klyde B.J.

Physiol. 2004; 286: E577-E588Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). These findings are compatible with the possibility that reduced fat depot size with aging may be related to decreased capacity of preadipocytes to differentiate and of fat cells arising from them to accumulate lipid. Indeed, preadipocytes isolated from old animals accumulate lipid less extensively than cells from young animals, even after weeks in culture under identical conditions (11Djian P. Roncari D.A.K. Hollenberg C.H. J. Clin. Investig. 1983; 72: 1200-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 12Kirkland J.L. Hollenberg C.H. Gillon W.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C206-C210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to the influence of possible age-related changes in diet, activity, hormones, circulation, or other factors extrinsic to adipose cells, altered preadipocyte intracellular characteristics with aging may contribute to changes in fat depot size and function.

Overexpression of C/EBPα in preadipocytes from old animals restores adipogenesis, consistent with a contribution of mechanisms upstream of adipogenic transcription factor expression to the age-related decline in differentiation. C/EBPβ expression increases early during adipogenesis, contributing to enhanced PPARγ and C/EBPα expression (14Wu Z. Bucher N.L.R. Farmer S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4128-4136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Wu Z. Xie Y. Bucher N.L.R. Farmer S.R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2350-2363Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). The early differentiation-related increase in C/EBPβ mRNA is similar across age groups (13Karagiannides I. Tchkonia T. Dobson D.E. Steppan C.M. Cummins P. Chan G. Salvatori K. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Kirkland J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: R1772-R1780Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), implicating events between the increase in C/EBPβ mRNA and subsequent increases in PPARγ and C/EBPα expression. Increases in anti-adipogenic regulators that act at this point, including the liver-enriched inhibitory protein (LIP) isoform of C/EBPβ and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), occur with aging (3Kirkland J.L. Tchkonia T. Pirtskhalava T. Han J. Karagiannides I. Exp. Gerontol. 2002; 37: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 13Karagiannides I. Tchkonia T. Dobson D.E. Steppan C.M. Cummins P. Chan G. Salvatori K. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Kirkland J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: R1772-R1780Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Abundance of the alternatively translated C/EBPβ-LIP, which lacks the full transactivation domain of longer C/EBPβ isoforms, is substantially higher in fat tissue from old than young rats and increases within hours after induction of adipogenesis (13Karagiannides I. Tchkonia T. Dobson D.E. Steppan C.M. Cummins P. Chan G. Salvatori K. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Kirkland J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: R1772-R1780Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This prompted us to investigate potential upstream regulators of C/EBPβ mRNA translation that could contribute to decreased adipogenesis with aging. (CUG)n triplet repeat RNA-binding protein (CUGBP) was identified through its ability to bind specifically to (CUG)8 oligonucleotides in vitro (16Timchenko L. Miller J. Timchenko N. DeVore D. Datar K. Lin L. Roberts R. Caskey C. Swanson M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4407-4414Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 17Timchenko L.T. Timchenko N.A. Caskey C.T. Roberts R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). CUGBP was postulated to play an important role in the pathogenesis of myotonic dystrophy, because the 3′-untranslated region of the myotonin protein kinase gene contains a (CTG)n repeat expansion in patients with this disease. There are two CUGBP isoforms, CUGBP1 and CUGBP2, the cellular localization of which is regulated by phosphorylation by as yet unknown kinases (18Roberts R. Timchenko N. Miller J. Reddy S. Caskey C. Swanson M. Timchenko L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13221-13226Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). By binding to target mRNAs, CUGBP1 can lead to alternative isoform production, both through affecting the translation apparatus and alternative splicing of pre-mRNA molecules (19Timchenko N.A. Welm A.L. Lu X. Timchenko L.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4517-4525Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 20Phillips A. Timchenko L. Cooper T. Science. 1998; 280: 734-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 21Poleev A. Hartmann A. Stamm S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4002-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). C/EBPβ mRNA is among the transcripts to which CUGBP1 can bind, leading to production of low molecular weight isoforms of C/EBPβ in in vitro translation and partial hepatectomy experiments (19Timchenko N.A. Welm A.L. Lu X. Timchenko L.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4517-4525Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Two CUGBP1-binding sites have been identified side by side between the first and second AUG codons in the 5′ region of C/EBPβ mRNA, one in frame and the second out of frame. The latter is located in a small open reading frame that has been shown to regulate initiation of translation from different AUG codons of the C/EBPβ mRNA. Because C/EBPβ is an important regulator of adipogenesis and the ratio of its activating to inhibitory isoforms is subject to a significant decline with aging, we speculated that CUGBP1 has a role in preadipocyte differentiation and declining adipogenesis in advanced old age. Additionally, we examined whether TNFα affects CUGBP1 expression and activity for the following reasons. In liver, CUGBP1 activity is increased by lipopolysaccharide, suggesting that CUGBP1 is a stress-responsive protein (22Welm A.L. Mackey S.L. Timchenko L.T. Darlington G.J. Timchenko N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27406-27413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, C/EBPβ-LIP generation in response to lipopolysaccharide in the liver becomes exaggerated with aging. TNFα abundance is greater in fat tissue from old than young rats (23Morin C.L. Pagliassotti M.J. Windmiller D. Eckel R.H. J. Gerontol. 1997; 52: B190-B195Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). TNFα is anti-adipogenic and downregulates expression of PPARγ (24Xing H. Northrop J.P. Grove J.R. Kilpatrick K.E. Su J.L. Ringold G.M. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2776-2783Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Hence, we speculated that decreased adipogenesis with aging could result, at least partially, from effects of TNFα on CUGBP1. Preadipocyte Isolation and Culture—Preadipocytes were isolated from the epididymal or caudal portion (to exclude brown fat (25Kirkland J.L. Hollenberg C.H. Gillon W.S. Int. J. Obes. 1996; 20: S102-S107PubMed Google Scholar)) of the perirenal depots of 3-, 17-, and 24-30-monthold male, barrier-reared, specific pathogen-free Brown Norway rats (median survival 32 months; maximum survival 43 months (26Hazzard D.G. Soban J. Exp. Aging Res. 1988; 14: 59-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 27Shimokawa I. Higami Y. Hubbard G.B. McMahan C.A. Masoro E.J. Yu B.P. J. Gerontol. 1993; 48: B27-B32Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar)) from the National Institute on Aging colony maintained by Harlan Sprague-Dawley (Indianapolis, IN). The protocol was approved by the Boston University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Separate groups of animals were used for each experiment. All experiments were conducted in parallel, and animals were autopsied to exclude gross pathology. Fat depots were minced, digested in a collagenase solution (1 mg of collagenase/ml Hanks' balanced salt solution; 3 ml/g tissue), filtered, and centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 10 min (25Kirkland J.L. Hollenberg C.H. Gillon W.S. Int. J. Obes. 1996; 20: S102-S107PubMed Google Scholar). The pellet was resuspended in α-minimal essential medium (αMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and the cells were plated for 20 h. The cells were washed, trypsinized until 90% of the cells had lifted, and replated at 4 × 104 cells/cm2. This method results in >90% pure preadipocyte populations (determined by counting colonies derived from single cells that are able to accumulate more lipid than similarly treated skin or lung fibroblasts), irrespective of age or fat depot origin (12Kirkland J.L. Hollenberg C.H. Gillon W.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C206-C210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, preadipocyte recoveries, determined by adding various numbers of preadipocytes to fat tissue aliquots before processing, were similar across depots and age groups. To induce differentiation, confluent preadipocyte cultures were exposed to a serum-free differentiation-inducing medium (DM) containing 5 μg/ml insulin, 10 μg/ml transferrin, and 200 pm triiodothyronine, in 1:1 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium MEM/Ham's F12 (28Garcia E. Lacasa M. Agli B. Giudicelli Y. Lacasa D. J. Endocrinol. 1999; 161: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Media were changed every 2 days. Determination of Preadipocyte Differentiation Stage—Extent of lipid accumulation was assessed by phase contrast microscopy by observers who were not aware of the treatments cells had received, using methods described previously (12Kirkland J.L. Hollenberg C.H. Gillon W.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C206-C210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Tchkonia T. Tchoukalova Y.D. Giorgadze N. Pirtskhalava T. Karagiannides I. Forse R.A. Koo A.

Kindler S. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 2769-2773Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Cells were considered to be in morphological stage 0 when no intracellular granules were visible by phase contrast light microscopy, stage 1 when small dark inclusions were visible, and stage 2 when they contained a few small inclusions that were doubly refractile at medium power (20× objective). Cells were considered to be in at stage 3 when inclusions were larger and more numerous. When the inclusions were large enough to be doubly refractile at low power (10× objective) and filled most of the cytoplasm, they were classified as stage 4. They were considered to be stage 5 when they contained 2-5 large droplets and stage 6 when they contained a single large inclusion that laterally displaced the nucleus. The lipid nature of these inclusions was confirmed by staining with oil red O (31Wang H. Kirkland J.L. Hollenberg C.H. J. Clin. Investig. 1989; 83: 1741-1746Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 32Tchkonia T. Giorgadze N. Pirtskhalava T. Tchoukalova Y. Karagiannides I. Forse R.A. DePonte M. Stevenson M. Guo W. Han J. Waloga G. Lash T.L. Jensen M.D. Kirkland J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: R1286-R1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In previous experiments, we demonstrated that inclusions of the type in stage 4 to 6 cells only appear in differentiating preadipocytes and not other cell types (e.g. lung fibroblasts) in the differentiation medium we used, and that the proportion of such cells is highly correlated with glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity (12Kirkland J.L. Hollenberg C.H. Gillon W.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C206-C210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Wang H. Kirkland J.L. Hollenberg C.H. J. Clin.

RNA Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from preadipocytes using the guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol method (33Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63145) Google Scholar). 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed with Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random oligonucleotides (Amersham Biosciences). PCRs were performed using an ABI 7500 real time PCR system and software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Amplification was performed in a final volume of 20 μl, containing 5 μl of cDNA from the reverse-transcribed reaction, primer mixture (1 μm of each primer), and 10 μ l of 2 × SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Analysis of CUGBP1 mRNA expression was carried out during the exponential phase of amplification using the following primers: sense, 5′-CCAGACAACCAGATCTTGATGCT-3′, and antisense, 5′AGGTTTCATCTGTATAGGGTGATG-3′ (34Timchenko N.A. Cai Z.J. Welm A.L. Reddy S. Ashizawa T. Timchenko L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7820-7826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). CUGPB1 was expressed as a function of hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, which was used as an internal control. The expression of hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase was first evaluated using serially diluted reverse-transcribed cDNA. Primers used for hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase amplification were sense, 5′-CTTGCTCGAGATGTCATGAAG-3′, and antisense, 5′-GTTTGCATTGTTTTACCAGTG-3′. Protein Analysis—For protein analysis, cells were harvested and blotted as described previously (35Zapata J.M. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6916-6920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Membranes were probed with monoclonal antibody to human CUGBP1 (which has 98% sequence homology with rat CUGBP1 (16Timchenko L. Miller J. Timchenko N. DeVore D. Datar K. Lin L. Roberts R. Caskey C. Swanson M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4407-4414Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar)) and goat polyclonal glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology catalog sc-20357, Santa Cruz, CA). Visualization of binding of the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was performed by chemiluminescence. Total protein contents (pg/cell) were 305 ± 32 and 310 ± 38 in undifferentiated and differentiated preadipocytes from 3-month-old rats, respectively, and 335 ± 39 and 333 ± 42 in undifferentiated and differentiated preadipocytes from 24-month-old rats (n = 16 in each group). Equal amounts of protein from undifferentiated or differentiated preadipocytes from young or old rats were loaded in parallel on the same gels. Scanning densitometry was performed using a Hewlett-Packard 3970 scanner (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA) and Quantiscan software (Biosoft, Ferguson, MT). Densitometric results were expressed as a percentage of total optical density within each gel and were normalized to reflect differences in cellular protein content. CUGBP1 UV Cross-link Immunoprecipitation Activity Assay—RNA oligomers (CUG)8 were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 kinase. Equal amounts of the radioactive RNA probe (50-200,000 cpm) were then incubated with the total nuclear and cytosolic protein extracts isolated from preadipocytes of each group (preadipocytes isolated from young or old animals, from young animals with or without TNFα treatment) for 30 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the reactions were subjected to UV treatment for 5 min at 125 mJ and separated by SDS-PAGE, as described previously (16Timchenko L. Miller J. Timchenko N. DeVore D. Datar K. Lin L. Roberts R. Caskey C. Swanson M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4407-4414Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). CUGBP1 was precipitated from the reaction with an anti-CUGBP1 antibody linked to protein A-agarose beads. The immunoprecipitates were then washed four times with PBS and run on a 12% polyacrylamide gel under nondenaturing conditions (36Datar K.V. Dreyfuss G. Swanson M.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). After transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane, x-ray film was exposed to the filter for 3-4 days. The specificity of the interaction was examined by the addition to the reaction mix of 100 ng of unlabeled RNA competitor prior to the addition of protein. To verify the concentration of proteins used for the assay, the filters were stained with Coomassie Blue after the UV cross-link analysis. Generation of Recombinant Adenoviruses—An ∼1.4-kb fragment of CUGBP1 cDNA was isolated with the use of AflII and HindIII restriction endonucleases from the pOPI3CAT CUGBP expression vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with an Rous sarcoma virus promoter. Following blunting of its ends, the CUGBP1 cDNA fragment was ligated into the EcoRV site of the cytomegalovirus adenovirus shuttle vector, pAd Track-CMV (37He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3246) Google Scholar). The pAd-Easy system for production of recombinant adenoviruses was used (Invitrogen). The isolated plasmid DNA was subjected to digestion with the appropriate restriction endonucleases and run on a 0.7% agarose gel to check for the proper orientation of the insert. Colonies containing the correct plasmid were then grown into 500-ml LB cultures, and the pAd Track-CMV/GoI plasmid DNA (containing the CUGBP1 sequence) was isolated by the CsCl gradient ultracentrifugation method (38Sambrook J. Russell D. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). The recombinant vector along with the pAd Easy-1 helper vector (which represents the genome of the serotype 5 human adenovirus) were used to electroporate BJ 5183 Escherichia coli cells (39Sheng Y. Mancino V. Birren B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1990-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), which produce the deleted adenoviral E1 gene in trans. pAd Easy-1 contains the viral genome along with the adenoviral long terminal repeats that allow the formation, through homologous recombination, of the recombinant adenovirus containing the CUGBP1 gene (37He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3246) Google Scholar). The viral genome was then linearized with PacI and used to transfect 911 packaging cells (40Fallaux F.J. Kranenburg O. Cramer S.J. Houweling A. Van Ormondt H. Hoeben R.C. Van der Eb A.J. Hum. Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). The cells were lysed, and the lysate was subjected to CsCl gradient ultracentrifugation (41Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S. Gomez-Foix A.M. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 161-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). The band was loaded on a cassette and dialyzed to remove residual CsCl. A plaque assay was used for titrating the virus (41Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S. Gomez-Foix A.M. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 161-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Adenoviral Infection—Confluent preadipocytes were washed twice with PBS, and growth medium was replaced with α-minimum Eagle's medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum. 4 × 109 adenoviral particles were diluted in 100 μl of PBS containing 0.4 mm polyethyleneimine and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. After incubation, the viral polyethyleneimine complex was added to preadipocytes for 18 h. After infection, cells were washed twice with PBS, and growth or differentiation medium was added. Infection efficiency was assessed by determining the percentage of cells expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) by fluorescence microscopy. CUGBP1 expression was verified by Western blot analysis 48-72 h after infection. Short Interference RNA-mediated CUGBP1 Knockdown—CUGBP1 siRNA (AACCAGATCTTGATGCTATCA) was synthesized (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). CUGBP1 siRNA was labeled with a Cy3 labeling kit (Mirus, Madison, WI). The labeled siRNA was transfected into epididymal rat preadipocytes at 75% confluence with the RNAifect transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). As a control, transfection with nonsilencing, fluorescein-labeled siRNA was carried out under the same conditions. After 6 h, the cells were washed with PBS, and α-minimum Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum was added. Differentiation was initiated 12 h after the siRNA transfection for up to 8 days. Medium was changed every 2nd day. Statistical Analysis—Results are presented as means ± 1 S.E. Each n represents cultures from separate groups of animals. Significance was determined by t tests or single factor ANOVA, as appropriate (42Keppel G. Design and Analysis: A Researcher's Handbook. 4th Ed. Prentice-Hall, Inc, Englewood Cliffs, NJ2004Google Scholar, 43Kachigan S.K. Statistical Analysis. Radius Press, New York1986Google Scholar). Appropriate post hoc tests were used to determine differences among groups. In transfection experiments, comparisons of numbers of transfectants containing lipid inclusions to mock-transfected cells were made by logistic regression analysis with p values determined from log likelihood ratios. In infection experiments, repeated measures of ANOVA with treatment as the nest factor were used in order to determine whether there are differences in lipid accumulation between cells infected with CUGBP1-expressing or control adenovirus. Variation among subjects, due to effect of treatment and due to random effects of subjects within treatment, as well as variation within each subject, was tested. p < 0.05 was considered significant. CUGBP1 Protein Abundance Increases Progressively with Aging—Significantly higher CUGBP1 protein abundance was found in epididymal preadipocytes isolated from middle-aged than young rats (Fig. 1; n = 6; p < 0.01; ANOVA and Duncan's multiple range test). CUGBP1 levels were higher again in old than middle-aged animals (17 versus 30 months; p < 0.01; Duncan's multiple range test). CUGBP1 mRNA levels changed in a similar way with aging (27 ± 3 arbitrary units by real time PCR in young (mean ± 1 S.E.) and 44 ± 3 in old animals; p < 0.01; n = 4; t test). Thus, CUGBP1 protein abundance increases throughout the life span and involves increasing transcript abundance. CUGBP1 Nucleotide Binding Activity Increases with Aging—CUGBP1 activity was determined by measuring binding to (CUG)8 triplets in an UV cross-link immunoprecipitation assay. Cytosolic extracts of preadipocytes isolated from old rats exhibited higher binding activity than extracts from young rat preadipocytes (Fig. 2; p < 0.005; n = 7; t test). CUGBP1 activity was absent in nuclear extracts from the same cells (data not shown). Thus, increased abundance of CUGBP1 protein with aging is associated with increased binding activity. The activity is present in the cytosolic fraction of the preadipocyte, where the translational machinery is located. Activity of the cytosolic isoform is enhanced when hyperphosphorylated by as yet u"
https://openalex.org/W2161441168,"Transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) is a member of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase family and is an upstream signaling molecule of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). Given that NF-κB regulates keratinocyte differentiation and apoptosis, TAK1 may be essential for epidermal functions. To test this, we generated keratinocyte-specific TAK1-deficient mice from Map3k7flox/flox mice and K5-Cre mice. The keratinocyte-specific TAK1-deficient mice were macroscopically indistinguishable from their littermates until postnatal day 2 or 3, when the skin started to roughen and wrinkle. This phenotype progressed, and the mice died by postnatal day 7. Histological analysis showed thickening of the epidermis with foci of keratinocyte apoptosis and intra-epidermal micro-abscesses. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the suprabasal keratinocytes of the TAK1-deficient epidermis expressed keratin 5 and keratin 14, which are normally confined to the basal layer. The expression of keratin 1, keratin 10, and loricrin, which are markers for the suprabasal and late phase differentiation of the epidermis, was absent from the TAK1-deficient epidermis. Furthermore, the TAK1-deficient epidermis expressed keratin 16 and had an increased number of Ki67-positive cells. These data indicate that TAK1 deficiency in keratinocytes results in abnormal differentiation, increased proliferation, and apoptosis in the epidermis. However, the keratinocytes from the TAK1-deficient epidermis induced keratin 1 in suspension culture, indicating that the TAK1-deficient keratinocytes retain the ability to differentiate. Moreover, the removal of TAK1 from cultured keratinocytes of Map3k7flox/flox mice resulted in apoptosis, indicating that TAK1 is essential for preventing apoptosis. In conclusion, TAK1 is essential in the regulation of keratinocyte growth, differentiation, and apoptosis.

In conclusion, TAK1 is essential in the regulation of keratinocyte growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. The epidermis is a multilayered epithelial tissue, maintained by the precise regulation of keratinocyte proliferation, differentiation, and cell death. Cell growth is limited to the basal cell layer, which attaches to the basement membrane. After leaving the basement membrane, keratinocytes differentiate and form a multilayered epidermis instead of undergoing apoptosis. This keratinocyte differentiation is regulated by intracellular signaling pathways involving nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), 2The abbreviations used are: NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; TAK1, transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MAPK, MAP kinase; IKK, IκB kinase; KO, knock-out; K, keratin; Ax, adenovirus vector; P, postnatal day; TAB, TAK1-binding protein; TEWL, trans-epidermal water loss; TUNEL, TdT-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling; RT, reverse transcriptase; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; IL, interleukin; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; poly-HEMA, polyhydroxyethylmethacrylate; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase. the MAP kinase family, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and protein kinase C (1Seitz C.S.

In the epidermis, NF-κB is found in the cytoplasm of basal cells (1Seitz C.S. Lin Q. Deng H. Khavari P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The functional blockade of NF-κB by expressing dominant negative NF-κB in transgenic mouse epidermis produced a hyperplastic epithelium in vivo (1Seitz C.S. Lin Q. Deng H. Khavari P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2307-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). With deficiency of the p65/RelA subunit of NF-κB, the epidermis is hyperplastic (4Zhang J.Y. Green C.L. Tao S. Khavari P.A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Conversely, the overexpression of active p50 (a subunit of NF-κB) and p65 in the transgenic epithelium produced hypoplasia and growth inhibition, suggesting a role for NF-κB in negative cellular growth control (1Seitz C.S. Lin Q. Deng H. Khavari P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2307-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the expression of active p50 and p65 in keratinocytes inhibits cell cycle progression to G1 arrest in vitro, which was associated with an increased p21 level (5Seitz C.S. Deng H. Hinata K. Lin Q. Khavari P.A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4085-4092PubMed Google Scholar) and CDK4 down-regulation (6Dajee M. Lazarov M. Zhang J.Y. Cai T. Green C.L. Russell A.J. Marinkovich M.P. Tao S.

Khavari P.A. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 561-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition to regulating differentiation and cell growth, NF-κB protects keratinocytes from apoptosis, and the blockade of NF-κB function in the epidermis by the expression of the dominant negative mutant IκBα provoked premature spontaneous cell death (8Seitz C.S. Freiberg R.A. Hinata K. Khavari P.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Although the roles of the NF-κB pathway have been studied in keratinocytes, the upstream signal of the NF-κB pathway has not been clarified fully. Transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), a member of the MAP kinase kinase kinase family, is a signaling molecule upstream from NF-κB and is encoded by the Map3k7 gene. TAK1 was originally identified as a signaling molecule activated by transforming growth factor β (9Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). TAK1 is also involved in IL-1 signaling and TNF-α-induced activation of NF-κB and MAP kinases (MAPKs). Activated TAK1 is recruited to TRAF6 and TRAF2, in response to the IL-1 and TNF receptors, respectively (10Takaesu G. Kishida S. Hiyama A. Yamaguchi K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6277-6288Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). TAK1 forms a complex with TAK1-binding protein (TAB) 1, TAB2, and TAB3 (10Takaesu G. Kishida S. Hiyama A. Yamaguchi K.

The activated TAK1 complex phosphorylates IκB kinases (IKKs) and MAPK kinase 6, which activate NF-κB and MAPKs, respectively. The transfection of TAK1 small interfering RNA markedly inhibited TNF-α- and IL-1-mediated activation of NF-κB (11Takaesu G. Surabhi R.M. Park K.J. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Gaynor R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Recently, TAK1 was shown to be essential for innate and adaptive immune responses by generating B cell-specific TAK1 deficiency (15Sato S. Sanjo H. Takeda K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Yamamoto M. Kawai T. Matsumoto K. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). Given that TAK1 is an upstream signaling molecule of the NF-κB pathway, TAK1 might regulate keratinocyte growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. However, the function of TAK1 in epidermal keratinocytes has not been studied. To address this issue, we generated keratinocyte-specific TAK1-deficient mice by using Cre-recombinase transgenic mice under the control of the K5 promoter. Generation of Keratinocyte-specific TAK1-deficient Mice Using Gene Targeting with the Cre Transgene—The targeting construct has been described previously (15Sato S. Sanjo H. Takeda K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Yamamoto M. Kawai T. Matsumoto K. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). We generated keratinocyte-specific TAK1-deficient mice by breeding Map3k7flox/flox mice with mice carrying the Cre transgene under the control of the keratin 5 promoter (K5-Cre) (16Takeda J. Sano S. Tarutani M. Umeda J. Kondoh G. J Dermatol. Sci. 2000; 23: 147-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The Map3k7flox/flox mice were bred with K5-Cre mice to generate K5-Cre/Map3k7flox/+ mice. Subsequently, the K5-Cre/Map3k7flox/+ mice were bred to Map3k7flox/flox mice to generate K5-Cre/Map3k7flox/flox mice. The genotype of each mouse was confirmed using PCR and Western blot analysis. The TAK1 primer sequences were 5′-GGAACCCGTGGATAAGTGCACTTGAAT-3′ and 5′-GGCTTTCATTGTGGAGGTAAGCTGAGA-3′. The amplified products were 320 bp for the floxed allele and 280 bp for the wild-type allele. The Cre-recombinase primers were 5′-TTACCGGTCGATGCAACGAGTGATG-3′ and 5′-TTCCATGAGTGAACGAACCTGGTCG-3′. Isolated keratinocytes were cultured overnight, and the adherent keratinocytes were harvested for Western blot analysis (see Fig. 1D). This protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Ehime University School of Medicine. Trans-epidermal Water Loss (TEWL)—TEWL was measured using a Tewameter TM210 (Integral Co., Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The data are expressed as the means ± S.E. The statistical significance was determined using the paired Student's t test. The differences were considered statistically significant at p < 0.01. Histological Analysis—Mouse skin was fixed in 3.6% formaldehyde, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. Four-μm sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. To analyze differentiation markers, keratin (K) 5, K14, K1, K10, and loricrin, the paraffin-embedded sections were deparaffinized, blocked with 10% goat serum, and reacted with the first antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the first antibodies were detected using a peroxidase staining kit (ImmPRESS; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and visualized with the chromogen 3-amino-9-ethyl-cabazole according to the manufacturer's instructions. For K16 and Ki67 staining, the deparaffinized sections were boiled in 10 mm citrate buffer, pH 6.0, for 40 min and cooled at room temperature for 20 min for antigen retrieval. Subsequently, K16 and Ki67 were stained following the same procedure as for the differentiation markers. Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy—Frozen skin sections (4 μm) were blocked with 10% goat serum and reacted overnight at 4 °C with rabbit anti p50 and p65. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the sections were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG for 30 min at room temperature. The stained specimens were observed under a LSM 510 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). The images were captured using LSM 510 software. TdT-mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL)—Keratinocyte apoptosis was detected by the TUNEL method using an in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Applied Sciences). After being deparaffinized, the sections were treated with 20 μg/ml proteinase K in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, for 15 min at room temperature and labeled according to the manufacturer's instructions. The labeled cells were observed under a fluorescence microscope. Antibodies—The following antibodies were used: K5, K14, K1, and K10 (rabbit; Covance, Berkeley, CA); K16 (mouse, clone number LL025; Chemicon International, Temecula, CA); loricrin (rabbit; Covance); Ki67 (mouse, clone number MM1, Novo Castra Laboratories, Newcastle, UK); β-actin (mouse, clone number AC-15, Abcam, Cambridge, UK); and p50, p65, and TAK1 (rabbit, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Keratinocyte Culture—Primary mouse keratinocytes were isolated from newborn mouse skin. The skin samples were cut into 3-5-mm pieces and incubated with 250 units/ml dispase (Godoshusei, Tokyo, Japan) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium overnight at 4 °C. After the epidermis was separated from the dermis, the epidermal sheets were incubated in a 0.25% trypsin solution for 10 min at 37 °C and teased with forceps. The keratinocytes were collected by centrifugation and were cultured further in CnT-02 medium (CellnTec, Bern, Switzerland). For suspension culture, keratinocytes were plated onto 6-cm polyhydroxyethylmethacrylate (poly-HEMA)-coated plates (3Sayama K. Yamasaki K. Hanakawa Y. Shirakata Y. Tokumaru S. Ijuin T. Takenawa T. Hashimoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40390-40396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The poly-HEMA-coated plates were made by adding 4 ml of a solution containing 10 mg/ml poly-HEMA (Sigma-Aldrich) in ethanol to the dish, drying, and repeating once, followed by extensive phosphate-buffered saline washes. After 24 h, the cells were harvested by pipetting. Western Blotting—Keratinocytes were harvested on ice with lysis buffer containing 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% protease inhibitor (Sigma-Aldrich). The proteins (20 μg) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20 and was incubated with the appropriate first antibody. After washing, the membrane was incubated with fluorescein-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (1:2,500 dilution) for 1 h. The signal was amplified with an anti-fluorescein antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase, followed by the fluorescent substrate AttoPhos (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The membrane was scanned using FluoroImager (Molecular Dynamics), and the intensity of each band was quantified with ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics), referring to the control as one unit. Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR—Total RNA samples were isolated using Isogen (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan), and the TAK1 mRNA expression was analyzed by RT-PCR using RT-PCR High Plus (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). The PCR product (337 bp) was sequenced to confirm the accuracy of amplification. The primer sequences for TAK1 were 5′-AGTGCTGACATGTCTGAAAT-3′ and 5′-TTCGAACACTGCCATGGATT-3′, and those for the internal standard glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′ and 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′. The intensity of each band was quantified using NIH Image. The data are presented as fold induction relative to the control signal, set at 1 unit. Adenovirus Vector—Adenovirus vector (Ax) encoding Crerecombinase was generated using the COS-TPC method (17Hanakawa Y. Amagai M. Shirakata Y. Sayama K. Hashimoto K. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1803-1811Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Virus stocks were prepared by standard procedures. Concentrated, purified virus stocks were prepared using a CsCl gradient, and the virus titer was checked using a plaque formation assay. We infected keratinocytes with Ax at a multiplicity of infection of 100. Empty Ax-1W vector was used as a control. LDH Assay—Cell death was analyzed quantitatively by measuring LDH release using an LDH assay kit (Kyokutokogyo, Tokyo, Japan). Keratinocytes were cultured on 6-cm dishes, and Ax was transfected. At the indicated time, 100 μl of supernatant were harvested, centrifuged, and stored at −70 °C until the LDH assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The LDH of living cells was obtained by cell lysis with 0.1% Tween 20®. LDH release was expressed as a percentage of the total LDH, which was obtained by summing the LDH released and the LDH of living cells. The data are expressed as the means ± S.E. The statistical significance was determined using the paired Student's t test (n = 5). The differences were considered statistically significant at p < 0.01. Generating Mice with Keratinocyte-specific TAK1 Deficiency—The germ line targeting of the Map3k7 gene encoding TAK1 results in embryonic lethality (15Sato S. Sanjo H. Takeda K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Yamamoto M. Kawai T. Matsumoto K. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar); therefore, we generated keratinocyte-specific TAK1-deficient mice (Fig. 1) by breeding Map3k7flox/flox mice with mice carrying the Cre transgene under the control of the keratin 5 promoter (K5-Cre) (16Takeda J. Sano S. Tarutani M. Umeda J. Kondoh G. J Dermatol. Sci. 2000; 23: 147-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis and RT-PCR showed the Cre-mediated deletion of TAK1 in keratinocytes from K5-Cre/Map3k7flox/flox mice at birth (Fig. 1, D and E). Here, the K5-Cre/Map3k7flox/flox mice and Map3k7flox/flox mice are referred to as TAK1-KO and control, respectively. Rough and Wrinkled Skin with Disrupted Barrier Function, Growth Retardation, and Early Mortality in TAK1-KO Mice—At birth, the TAK1-KO mice were macroscopically indistinguishable from their littermates until postnatal day 2 or 3 (P2-P3), when the skin started to roughen and wrinkle. This phenotype progressed with mild scaling, and the TAK1-KO mice subsequently died by P7 (Fig. 2A). At this stage, the mice weighed approximately half the control weight. To evaluate epidermal barrier function, we measured TEWL at P6 (Fig. 2B). The TEWL value in TAK1-KO mice was 6.9-fold that in the control, indicating that the barrier function had been disrupted. Given that the epidermal barrier function arises during keratinocyte differentiation, the regulation of keratinocyte differentiation might be disturbed in TAK1-KO mice. The Map3k7flox/+ and Map3k7+/+ mice with or without K5-Cre showed no pathological phenotypes. Hyperplasia, Apoptosis, and Micro-abscess Formation in the Epidermis of TAK1-KO Mice—The epidermis of TAK1-KO mice at P0 was histologically indistinguishable from that of control mice, except for a few apoptotic cells (arrow). However, the histological analysis of the skin of TAK1-KO mice at P6 (Fig. 3A) showed many apoptotic cells (arrow) and marked thickening of the epidermis without a granular layer (g), indicating abnormal epidermal differentiation. The thickened epidermis contained foci of keratinocyte apoptosis (Fig. 3B, left panel, arrow) and intra-epidermal micro-abscesses (Fig. 3B, right panel, arrowhead), which were associated with apoptotic cells (arrow). The oral mucosa showed a similar phenotype to that of the epidermis (Fig. 3A). Clinically, there were no apparent erosions or ulcers on the oral mucosa (data not shown). No microbial pathogens were seen in the micro-abscesses on staining the specimens with methylene blue (data not shown), indicating that the micro-abscesses were not caused by infection. Because the micro-abscesses were associated with keratinocyte apoptosis, one possible mechanism for micro-abscess formation is the release of cytokines or chemokines from dead keratinocytes. Abnormal Differentiation and Increased Proliferation of Keratinocytes in TAK1-KO Mice—To analyze the differentiation status of epidermal keratinocytes, we performed immunohistochemical analysis of the skin using antibodies against differentiation markers (Fig. 4). The expression of differentiation markers of TAK1-KO epidermis at P0 was similar to that of controls. The expression pattern started to change at P2, and the changes became more marked at P6. The expression of K5 and K14 is normally confined to the basal cell layer, as seen in the control. However, the suprabasal keratinocytes of TAK1-KO mice at P6 expressed K5 and K14. K1, K10, and loricrin are markers for the suprabasal and late phase differentiation of keratinocytes and are normally expressed on the suprabasal keratinocytes and in the upper epidermis, respectively. In addition to the ectopic expression of K5 and K14, the expression of K1, K10, and loricrin was absent on the viable epidermal keratinocytes of TAK1-KO mice at P6. Furthermore, the epidermis of TAK1-KO mice at P6 expressed K16, a marker for inflammatory and hyperproliferative epidermal keratinocytes; K16 expression was absent from control mice. These data indicate that keratinocyte differentiation was disturbed by removing TAK1 from keratinocytes. We further analyzed growth and apoptosis in the epidermis using Ki67 staining and the TUNEL method (Fig. 5). The staining of Ki67 revealed increased proliferation of keratinocytes in the epidermis of TAK1-KO mice at P6 (Fig. 5A), in contrast to the increased apoptosis shown with the TUNEL method (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, Ki67-positive keratinocytes were present in the suprabasal layer of the epidermis of TAK1-KO mice. The expression of p50 and p65 in the basal layer of the epidermis of TAK1-KO mice was decreased at P6 (Fig. 5C). Induction of K1 in the Keratinocytes of TAK1-KO Mice in Suspension Culture—Based on the immunohistochemical results, we postulated that the keratinocytes of TAK1-KO mice do not express K1 by differentiation. To test this, we isolated and cultured keratinocytes from the epidermis of newborn mice. Although the number of Ki67-positive keratinocytes was increased in the epidermis of TAK1-KO mice, the in vitro growth of keratinocytes obtained from TAK1-KO mice was significantly reduced. Therefore, to study the ability of keratinocytes to differentiate, freshly isolated keratinocytes were seeded on culture plates and incubated overnight; adherent cells were subjected to suspension culture (3Sayama K. Yamasaki K. Hanakawa Y. Shirakata Y. Tokumaru S. Ijuin T. Takenawa T. Hashimoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40390-40396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) to induce differentiation. Unexpectedly, the keratinocytes from TAK1-KO mice induced K1 in the suspension culture, as did those from control mice (Fig. 6). Apoptosis of Keratinocytes on Depletion of TAK1 in Culture— Because of the difficulty in culturing TAK1-KO keratinocytes, we depleted TAK1 in cultured keratinocytes obtained from the control mice (Map3k7flox/flox). An adenovirus vector carrying Cre-recombinase (Ax-Cre) was transfected to the cultured keratinocytes. Empty Ax-1W vector was used as a control. As shown in Fig. 7, the expression of TAK1 was reduced to 0.4-fold that in control mice at 48 h after the transfection of Ax-Cre. The reduction of TAK1 in cultured keratinocytes resulted in apoptosis 72 h after transfection (Fig. 7C), indicating that TAK1 prevents keratinocyte apoptosis. The quantitative analysis of cell death based on measurements of LDH release revealed that the apoptosis started at 48 h and was completed at 72 h (D). Although TAK1 is evolutionarily conserved and is thought to be an important intracellular signaling molecule, little is known about its physiological roles. In Xenopus embryonic development, TAK1 is involved in mesoderm induction mediated by bone morphogenetic protein, a member of the transforming growth factor β family (18Shibuya H. Iwata H. Masuyama N. Gotoh Y. Yamaguchi K. Irie K. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. Ueno N. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1019-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). TAK1-deficient Drosophila are viable and fertile, but they do not produce antibacterial peptides and are highly susceptible to Gram-negative bacteria infection (19Vidal S. Khush R.S. Leulier F. Tzou P. Nakamura M. Lemaitre B. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1900-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In HeLa cells, it is thought that TAK1 is involved in the TNF receptor and IL-1 receptor/Toll-like receptor-mediated signaling pathways upstream from NF-κB and MAPKs, based on small interfering RNA inhibition of TAK1 expression (11Takaesu G. Surabhi R.M. Park K.J. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Gaynor R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Because TAK1-deficient mice are embryonically lethal (15Sato S. Sanjo H. Takeda K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Yamamoto M. Kawai T. Matsumoto K. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar), by utilizing embryonic fibroblasts, a loss of response to IL-1β and TNF in TAK1-deficient cells was demonstrated (15Sato S. Sanjo H. Takeda K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Yamamoto M. Kawai T. Matsumoto K. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). To study the role of TAK1 in B cell function, mice with B cell-specific TAK1 deficiency were generated (15Sato S. Sanjo H. Takeda K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Yamamoto M. Kawai T. Matsumoto K. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). The B cell-specific TAK1-deficient mouse showed that TAK1 was indispensable for B cell activation in response to Toll-like receptor ligands (CpG DNA, poly(I:C), and LPS), CD40, and B cell receptor cross-linking (15Sato S. Sanjo H. Takeda K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Yamamoto M. Kawai T. Matsumoto K. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). Furthermore, TAK1-deficient B cells failed to activate NF-κB and JNK in response to IL-1β, TNF, and Toll-like receptor ligands. Therefore, TAK1 has essential functions in the Toll-like receptor-, IL-1 receptor-, TNF receptor-, and B cell receptor-mediated cellular responses. In addition, we showed that TAK1 is essential for regulating keratinocyte differentiation and preventing keratinocyte apoptosis in the epidermis. TAK1-KO mice die by P7. Because the barrier function of the epidermis was severely disturbed, as shown by TEWL, the impaired homeostasis of body fluids resulting from water loss through the skin may have caused the early mortality. Another possible cause of the early mortality is impaired feeding. The body weight at death was approximately half that of the control mice. The lips of the TAK1-KO mice showed signs of scaling, and the histological study revealed massive keratinocyte apoptosis (data not shown), as in the oral mucosa. These findings suggested that the diseased lip and oral mucosa affected nursing, resulting in severe growth retardation, which might cause the early mortality. TAB1 and TAB2 were identified as adaptor proteins of TAK1 using yeast two-hybrid screening (10Takaesu G. Kishida S. Hiyama A. Yamaguchi K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 649-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 13Shibuya H. Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Tonegawa A. Gotoh Y. Ueno N. Irie K. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1996; 272: 1179-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). TAB1 binds to TAK1 constitutively and induces kinase activity on stimulation with IL-1. TAB2 is an adaptor molecule linking TRAF6 and TAK1. With IL-1 stimulation, TAB2 translocates from the cell membrane to the cytosol and binds to TRAF6 and TAK1. TAB3 is a TAB2 homologue that interacts with TRAF6 and TRAF2 on stimulation with IL-1 and TNF, respectively (12Ishitani T. Takaesu G. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Shibuya H. Gaynor R.B. Matsumoto K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6277-6288Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Co-transfection with small interfering RNA s directed against both TAB2 and TAB3 inhibited both the IL-1- and TNF-induced activation of TAK1 and NF-κB (12Ishitani T. Takaesu G. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Shibuya H. Gaynor R.B. Matsumoto K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6277-6288Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). These results suggest that TAB2 and TAB3 play redundant roles as mediators of TAK1 activation in IL-1 and TNF signal transduction. Although TABs have been identified as TAK1 adaptor proteins, the genetic study of these proteins suggested that they do not always function together as a TAK1 complex. The neural tube development was abnormal in the TAK1-deficient embryo (20Shim J.H. Xiao C. Paschal A.E. Bailey S.T. Rao P. Hayden M.S. Lee K.Y. Bussey C. Steckel M. Tanaka N. Yamada G. Akira S. Matsumoto K. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2668-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). This phenotype is substantially different from those of TAB1-deficient (abnormal cardiovascular and pulmonary morphogenesis) and TAB2-deficient (liver degeneration and apoptosis) mice (21Komatsu Y. Shibuya H. Takeda N. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Yasui T. Miyado K. Sekimoto T. Ueno N. Matsumoto K. Yamada G. Mech. Dev. 2002; 119: 239-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 22Sanjo H. Takeda K. Tsujimura T. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Akira S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1231-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These data suggested not only that TAK1 and the TAB complex function as a single unit, but that each component has a distinct role during development (20Shim J.H. Xiao C. Paschal A.E. Bailey S.T. Rao P. Hayden M.S. Lee K.Y. Bussey C. Steckel M. Tanaka N. Yamada G. Akira S. Matsumoto K. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2668-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the roles of TABs in keratinocytes have not yet been studied. Therefore, molecular interaction between TABs and TAK1 and their roles in keratinocytes should be clarified. Genetic studies have shown that mutations in the human NEMO/IKK-γ gene are the cause of incontinentia pigmenti or Bloch-Sulzberger syndrome (23Smahi A. Courtois G. Vabres P. Yamaoka S. Heuertz S. Munnich A. Israel A. Heiss N.S. Klauck S.M. Kioschis P. Wiemann S. Poustka A. Esposito T. Bardaro T. Gianfrancesco F. Ciccodicola A. D'Urso M. Woffendin H. Jakins T. Donnai D. Stewart H. Kenwrick S.J. Aradhya S. Yamagata T. Levy M. Lewis R.A. Nelson D.L. Nature. 2000; 405: 466-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Disruption of the NEMO/IKK-γ gene causes female mice to develop patchy skin lesions with massive granulocyte infiltration and hyperproliferation and increased apoptosis of keratinocytes (24Schmidt-Supprian M. Bloch W. Courtois G. Addicks K. Israel A. Rajewsky K. Pasparakis M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 981-992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 25Makris C. Godfrey V.L.

Diseased animals show severe growth retardation and early mortality (24Schmidt-Supprian M. Bloch W. Courtois G. Addicks K. Israel A. Rajewsky K. Pasparakis M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 981-992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 25Makris C. Godfrey V.L. Krahn-Senftleben G. Takahashi T. Roberts J.L. Schwarz T. Feng L. Johnson R.S. Karin M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 969-979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Although the skin lesion of TAK1-KO mice was not patchy, the clinical appearance, histological findings, and early mortality were similar to those in IKK-γ deficiency. The formation of patchy lesions in IKK-γ deficiency is thought to be the result of a chimerism in the IKK-γ-deficient mouse. Furthermore, the epidermis-specific deletion of IKK-β/IKK2 increased apoptosis and the abnormal expression of differentiation markers, including K6, K14, K10, and loricrin (26Pasparakis M. Courtois G. Hafner M. Schmidt-Supprian M. Nenci A. Toksoy A. Krampert M. Goebeler M. Gillitzer R. Israel A. Krieg T. Rajewsky K. Haase I. Nature. 2002; 417: 861-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), resembling the characteristics of TAK1-KO mice. The development of similar skin phenotypes among mice with TAK1-, IKK-β-, or IKK-γ-deficient epidermal keratinocytes indicates the disruption of a common pathway in these mice. Given that TAK1 activates the IKK complex, the signal from TAK1 to NF-κB might be disrupted in the IKK-β- or IKK-γ-deficient epidermis. Although apoptosis was almost 100% at 72 h in Fig. 7D, TAK1 expression was still 0.4-fold 48 h after Ax-Cre transfection (Fig. 7, A and B). There are three possibilities for this discrepancy: 1) The band in the Western blot of cells transfected with Ax-Cre was slightly lower than that of Ax-1W at 48 h (B); this may represent TAK1Δ, which lacks the ATP-binding site required for kinase activity (15Sato S. Sanjo H. Takeda K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Yamamoto M. Kawai T. Matsumoto K. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar), as in Fig. 1E. Therefore, the active TAK1 has already disappeared, and a small amount of inactive TAK1 (TAK1Δ) appeared instead. 2) Cells started to die 48 h after Ax-Cre transfection. Because the dead cells detached spontaneously or on washing the culture dishes, and only living cells were subjected to analysis, it is most likely that cells expressing 0.4-fold TAK1 were still alive, whereas the complete loss of TAK1 had resulted in the apoptosis of cells that were not included in the analysis. At 72 h, TAK1 knockdown may be complete, and all the cells underwent apoptosis. 3) The transfection efficiency of Ax-Cre might not be equal for all cells. In less transfected cells, TAK1 expression might not be reduced. This might cause the 0.4-fold TAK1 expression at 48 h. Moreover, the high expression of Cre caused the complete loss of TAK1 and apoptosis at 48 h, but these cells were not included in the analysis, as discussed in the second possible explanation. One reason or a combination of these reasons might cause this discrepancy. A possible role for NF-κB in negative cellular growth control via cell cycle regulation has been suggested (1Seitz C.S. Lin Q. Deng H. Khavari P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2307-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 5Seitz C.S. Deng H. Hinata K. Lin Q. Khavari P.A.

Nature. 2003; 421: 639-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Growth inhibitory genes are induced by p65 in keratinocytes but not in other cell types (27Hinata K. Gervin A.M. Jennifer Zhang Y. Khavari P.A. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1955-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In the p65-deficient mouse, the number of Ki67-positive keratinocytes increased in the epidermis, and keratinocyte proliferation increased in culture (4Zhang J.Y. Green C.L. Tao S. Khavari P.A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Based on the increased number of Ki67-positive cells in TAK1-KO mice seen in this study, we postulate that cell growth increased. However, the proliferation of TAK1-KO keratinocytes is reduced in vitro. IKK-β-deficient keratinocytes are also hypoproliferative in vitro, despite an increased number of Ki67-positive cells in the epidermis (26Pasparakis M. Courtois G. Hafner M. Schmidt-Supprian M. Nenci A. Toksoy A. Krampert M. Goebeler M. Gillitzer R. Israel A. Krieg T. Rajewsky K. Haase I. Nature. 2002; 417: 861-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). One possible mechanism to account for an increased number of Ki67-positive cells and decreased proliferation in vitro is the induction of apoptosis that overtakes proliferation. However, this cannot explain the discrepancy between TAK1 and IKK-β deficiencies and p65 deficiency. Similar phenotypic discrepancy has also been found between IKKα/IKK1-deficient mice and others; the phenotypes of IKKα-deficient mice are somewhat different from those of mice deficient in p65, IκB kinase 2, or IKKβ. Mice lacking IKKα died perinatally and showed severely impaired limb outgrowth and abnormal epidermal differentiation (28Takeda K. Takeuchi O. Tsujimura T. Itami S. Adachi O. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Yoshikawa K. Terada N. Akira S. Science. 1999; 284: 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 29Hu Y. Baud V. Delhase M. Zhang P. Deerinck T. Ellisman M. Johnson R. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the phenotypic differences among these deficient mice result from the loss of individual upstream signaling molecules of NF-κB that do not completely impair NF-κB function. The loss of adhesion to the extracellular matrix in suspension culture strongly induces keratinocyte differentiation (3Sayama K. Yamasaki K. Hanakawa Y. Shirakata Y. Tokumaru S. Ijuin T. Takenawa T. Hashimoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40390-40396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Although the epidermis of TAK1-KO mice showed abnormal differentiation, the keratinocytes of TAK1-KO mice differentiated to express K1 in suspension culture. Similarly, IKK-β-deleted keratinocytes retained the ability to differentiate in suspension culture despite the failure of epidermal differentiation (26Pasparakis M. Courtois G. Hafner M. Schmidt-Supprian M. Nenci A. Toksoy A. Krampert M. Goebeler M. Gillitzer R. Israel A. Krieg T. Rajewsky K. Haase I. Nature. 2002; 417: 861-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). These data indicate that the regulation of keratinocyte differentiation by TAK1 and IKK-β is independent of the initiation of differentiation by the loss of adhesion to the extracellular matrix. Keratinocytes in the basal cell layer of control mice expressed p50 and p65, whereas the expression of p50 and p65 in the basal cell layer of TAK1-KO mice was decreased. One possible cause of the decreased expression is abnormal differentiation. High expression levels of p50 and p65 are normally found in the keratinocytes of the basal layer. However, the keratinocytes in the TAK1-KO basal layer did not possess a characteristic feature of the basal layer, the expression of K5 and K14. This abnormal differentiation might cause decreased expression of p50 and p65. As a result of decreased p50 and p65 expression, the NF-κB signal is scarcely transduced to the downstream signaling pathway, in addition to the lack of TAK1. In conclusion, TAK1 is essential in regulating keratinocyte growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. We thank Teruko Tsuda and Eriko Tan for providing significant technical assistance."

Despite the known role of TGF-βR-mediated signaling in suppressing immune response, its role in regulating host defense response in microbial infectious diseases remains largely unknown. In a review of the limited studies on the role of TGF-β signaling in infections, most studies have focused on pathogens that infect host macrophages such as Trypanosoma cruzi and a variety of Leishmania species (8Reed S.G. Microbes Infect. 1999; 1: 1313-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). These studies have demonstrated that excessively produced TGF-β upon infection inhibits macrophage activation, thereby favoring virulence (9Silva J.S. Twardzik D.R. Reed S.G. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 10Tsunawaki S. Sporn M. Ding A. Nathan C. Nature. 1988; 334: 260-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar, 11Barral-Netto M.

In certain situations, however, there is also evidence indicating that TGF-β has been correlated with enhanced resistance to microbes such as Candida albicans, thus benefiting the host (12Spaccapelo R.

Despite these distinct observations that mainly focused on macrophages, little is known about the role of TGF-β signaling in regulating host defense and immune responses, such as up-regulation of host defense receptor Toll-like receptor (TLR), in the mucosal epithelial cells of airway during bacterial infections (13Shuto T.

FASEB J. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar).In the host innate immune system, the surface epithelial cells are situated at host-environment boundaries and thus act as the first line of host defense against pathogenic bacteria (19Aderem A. Ulevitch R.J. Nature. 2000; 406: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2603) Google Scholar, 20Kopp E. Medzhitov R. Curr. Opin.

The principal challenge for the host is to efficiently detect the invading pathogen and mount a rapid defensive response. They recognize the invading bacteria by directly interacting with pathogen-associated molecular patterns on a variety of bacteria via TLRs expressed on the host (19Aderem A. Ulevitch R.J. Nature. 2000; 406: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2603) Google Scholar, 20Kopp E. Medzhitov R. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2003; 15: 396-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 21Medzhitov R.

Activation of TLRs, in turn, leads to induction of direct antimicrobial activity that can result in elimination of the invading pathogen before a full adaptive immune response takes effect (20Kopp E. Medzhitov R. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2003; 15: 396-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 21Medzhitov R.

Immunol. 2004; 5: 987-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (3280) Google Scholar). TLRs are type I transmembrane receptors with leucine-rich repeats in the extracellular domains and cytoplasmic domains that resemble the mammalian IL-1 receptor (19Aderem A. Ulevitch R.J. Nature. 2000; 406: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2603) Google Scholar, 20Kopp E. Medzhitov R. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2003; 15: 396-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 22Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6586) Google Scholar). To date, 11 members of the human TLR family have been cloned (20Kopp E. Medzhitov R. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2003; 15: 396-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 22Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6586) Google Scholar, 25Zhang D. Zhang G. Hayden M.S. Greenblatt M.B. Bussey C. Flavell R.A. Ghosh S. Science. 2004; 303: 1522-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). Of these, TLR2 has been shown to be critically involved in responding to a variety of Gram-positive bacterial products, including peptidoglycan, lipoprotein, lipoteichoic acid, and lipoarabinomannan (19Aderem A. Ulevitch R.J. Nature. 2000; 406: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2603) Google Scholar, 20Kopp E. Medzhitov R. Curr. Opin.

The importance of TLR2 in host defense was further highlighted by the studies from knock-out mice showing decreased survival of TLR2-deficient mice after infection with Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (26Takeuchi O. Hoshino K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5392-5396Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). Furthermore, our recent study demonstrated that TLR2 also plays a key role in activating host immune and inflammatory response by surface lipoprotein from the Gram-negative bacterium nontypeable Hemophilus influenzae (NTHi), a major cause of otitis media and exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (27Shuto T. Xu H. Wang B. Han J. Kai H. Gu X.X. Murphy T. Lim D.J. Li J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8774-8779Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 28Jono H. Shuto T. Xu H. Kai H. Lim D.J.

Commun. 2004; 324: 1087-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Thus, it is clear that TLR2 plays a crucial role in host defense against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. However, TLRs have also been implicated in some immune mediated and inflammatory diseases due to excessive immune responses. To avoid detrimental immune and inflammatory response, the host immune system needs to constantly strike a balance between activation and inhibition of immune response (32Fukao T. Koyasu S. Trends Immunol. 2003; 24: 358-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 33Liew F.Y. Xu D. Brint E.K. O'Neill L.A. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 446-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). One important way to achieve such a balance is to tightly regulate the expression level of TLRs. Given the important role that TGF-β signaling plays in mediating a variety of cellular responses, such as proliferation, differentiation, and suppression of immune responses, it is likely that TGF-β signaling may also be critically involved in regulating the host defense response by tightly controlling the expression of TLRs, the most important host defense receptors.In the present study, we provide evidence for the first time that TGF-βR acts as a positive regulator for TLR2 induction by bacterium NTHi via a Smad3/4-dependent mechanism. We showed that TβR-mediated signaling is probably activated by an NTHi-derived TGF-β mimicry molecule via an autocrine-independent mechanism. Moreover, our data indicate that TGF-β receptor-Smad3/4 signaling pathways are positively involved in TLR2 induction by NTHi via a dual mechanism involving functional cooperation with the NF-κB pathway and MAPK phosphatase 1 (MKP-1)-dependent inhibition of p38 MAPK, a negative regulator for TLR2 induction. Finally, we confirmed the positive regulation of TLR2 by TβR-Smad3/4 signaling in vivo. Thus, our study provides new insights into the role of TGF-β signaling in positively regulating host defense response by tightly controlling the expression level of TLR2 during bacterial infections and may help to further develop new therapeutic strategies for these diseases.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents—SB431542 was purchased from Sigma. SB203580, cycloheximide, and Ro31-8220 were purchased from Calbiochem. Recombinant human TGF-β1 was purchased from R&D Systems.Bacterial Strains and Culture Conditions—NTHi strain 12, a clinical isolate, was used in this study (34Wang B. Lim D.J. Han J. Kim Y.S.

For making NTHi crude extract, NTHi were harvested from a plate of chocolate agar after overnight incubation and incubated in 30 ml of brain heart infusion broth supplemented with NAD (3.5 μg/ml). After overnight incubation, NTHi were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The resulting pellet of NTHi was suspended in 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and sonicated. Subsequently, the lysate was collected and stored at −70 °C. Live bacteria of NTHi at a multiplicity of infection of 100:1 were used to treat the epithelial cells. NTHi lysates (15 μg/ml) were used to treat the cells for all of the other experiments. We chose to use NTHi lysates because of the following reasons. First, NTHi has been shown to be highly fragile and has the tendency to autolyze. Its autolysis can be triggered in vivo under various conditions including antibiotic treatment. Therefore, using lysates of NTHi represents a common clinical condition in vivo, especially after antibiotic treatment.Cell Culture—Human cervix epithelial cell line HeLa was maintained as described (13Shuto T.

All media received additions of 100 units/ml penicillin and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin.Real Time Quantitative PCR Analysis of TLR2 and TGF-βs—Total RNA was isolated by using TRIzol® Reagent (Invitrogen) by following the manufacturer's instruction. For the reverse transcription reaction, TaqMan reverse transcription reagents (Applied Biosystems) were used. Briefly, the reverse transcription reaction was performed for 60 min at 37 °C, followed by 60 min at 42 °C by using oligo(dT) and random hexamers. PCR amplification was performed by using TaqMan Universal Master Mix for TLR2 and mTLR2 or SYBR Green Universal Master Mix for PAI-1, TGF-βs, mouse TNF-α, and mIL-1β. In brief, reactions were performed in duplicate containing 2× Universal Master Mix, 1 μl of template cDNA, 100 nm primers, and 100 nm probe in a final volume of 12.5 μl, and they were analyzed in a 96-well optical reaction plate (Applied Biosystems). Probes for TaqMan include a fluorescent reporter dye, 6-carboxyfluorescein, on the 5′-end and labeled with a fluorescent quencher dye, 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine, on the 3′-end to allow direct detection of the PCR product. Reactions were amplified and quantified by using an ABI 7700 sequence detector and the manufacturer's corresponding software (Applied Biosystems). The relative quantities of mRNAs were obtained by using the comparative Ct method (for details, see Ref. 44Biosystems Applied User Bulletin 2: ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System.

Primary antibody was detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit or mouse IgG (Santa Cruz, CA). Samples were viewed and photographed using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope.TGF-β1 Neutralization Assays—For neutralization assays, TGF-β1 or NTHi lysate was mixed with purified IgG or human anti-TGF-β1 antibody (R&D Systems) at the indicated concentrations and incubated for 1 h before the addition to cells (28Jono H.

Next, 100 μl of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody was added for 1 h. Finally, 100 μl of TMB substrate buffer (Bio-Rad) was added for 30 min and color-developed in relation to the amount of TGF-βs present.

Hoshino K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5392-5396Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar), and 7-8-week-old mice were used in this study. After the trachea was surgically exposed by a middle line incision in the skin, NTHi was directly injected into the trachea. Lung tissues were collected and then stored at −80 °C. In experiments using chemical inhibitors, SB431542 (0.2 mg/mouse; 10 mg/kg) or Ro31-8220 (0.2 mg/mouse; 10 mg/kg) or an equal volume of control vehicle was given via an intraperitoneal route 30 min before the inoculation of NTHi into the trachea. Total RNA was isolated from the frozen tissue using TRIzol reagent. Three mice were used for each inoculation group. For in vivo bacterial clearance experiments, WT and Tlr2−/− mice were intratracheally inoculated with 50 μl of live bacterial suspension (1 × 108 colony-forming units) for 6 h. To examine the effect of perturbing TGF-βR signaling on bacteria clearance in mice, mice were pretreated with the TGF-βRI inhibitor SB431542 (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) 2 h before live NTHi inoculation. Six hours after bacteria inoculation, mice were sacrificed for bacterial clearance examination. The lung was removed, weighed, and homogenized in 1.5 ml of sterile PBS. One hundred microliters of homogenate and further serial 10-fold dilutions were plated on chocolate agar plates and incubated for 48 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the House Ear Institute and University of Rochester.RESULTSTGF-β Receptor I/II-Smad3/4 Signaling Pathway Is a Positive Regulator for Bacterium NTHi-induced TLR2 Transcription—Despite the key role that TGF-β signaling plays in regulating diverse cellular responses, such as proliferation, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis as well as suppressing immune responses, its role in regulating human TLR in host defense response remains unknown (1Massague J.

In skin, the distribution of collagen XVI overlaps that of the collagen-binding integrins α1β1 and α2β1. Basal layer keratinocytes express integrin α2β1, whereas integrin α1β1 occurs in smooth muscle cells surrounding blood vessels, in hair follicles, and on adipocytes. Cells bearing the integrins α1β1 and α2β1 attach and spread on recombinant collagen XVI. Furthermore, collagen XVI induces the recruitment of these integrins into focal adhesion plaques, a principal step in integrin signaling. Of potential physiological relevance, these integrin-collagen XVI interactions may connect cells with specialized fibrils, thus contributing to the organization of fibrillar and cellular components within connective tissues. In cell-free binding assays, collagen XVI is more avidly bound by α1β1 integrin than by α2β1 integrin. Both integrins interact with collagen XVI via the A domain of their α subunits. A tryptic collagen XVI fragment comprising the collagenous domains 1-3 is recognized by α1β1 integrin. Electron microscopy of complexes of α1β1 integrin with this tryptic collagen XVI fragment or with full-length collagen XVI revealed a unique α1β1 integrin-binding site within collagen XVI located close to its C-terminal end.

Collagen XVI belongs to the fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices (FACIT) 3The abbreviations used are: FACIT, fibril-associated collagen with interrupted triple-helices; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DEJ, dermal-epidermal junction; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; ECM, extracellular matrix; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; NC, noncollagenous; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; BSA, bovine serum albumin; BS3, bis-(sulfo-N-hydroxy-succinimidyl)-suberate. family of collagens (1Myllyharju J.

Biochem. 1995; 64: 403-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar) and is composed of 10 collagenous domains, designated as COL1-10, which are flanked by 11 noncollagenous (NC) regions (3Pan T.-C. Zhang R.-Z. Mattei M.-G. Timpl R. Chu M.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6565-6569Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It constitutes a minor component of the extracellular matrices (ECM) of skin and cartilage. Despite its integration into small heterotypic D-banded fibrils of cartilage, collagen XVI is not generally a component of D-banded fibrils, which contain several types of collagens and further constituents, i.e. small leucine-rich proteoglycans and noncollagenous glycoproteins, in an alloy-like mixture (4Kassner A. Hansen U. Miosge N. Reinhardt D.P. Aigner T. Bruckner-Tuderman L. Bruckner P. Grässel S. Matrix Biol. 2003; 22: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 5Eikenberry E.F. Bruckner P. Seibel M.J. Robins S.P. Bilezekian J.P. Dynamics of Bone and Cartilage Metabolism. Academic Press, San Diego1999: 289-300Google Scholar). In a tissue-specific manner, collagen XVI is incorporated into structurally and functionally discrete matrix aggregates, such as in specialized fibrillin-1-rich microfibrils in skin. Collagen XVI preferentially associates with that part of the microfibrillar apparatus lacking an amorphous elastin core and is localized in the dermal epidermal junction (DEJ) zone of the papillary dermis (4Kassner A. Hansen U. Miosge N. Reinhardt D.P. Aigner T. Bruckner-Tuderman L. Bruckner P. Grässel S. Matrix Biol. 2003; 22: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Here the microfibrils insert perpendicularly into the basement membrane. This location suggests that collagen XVI plays an active role in anchoring microfibrils to basement membranes. Despite its occurrence in the dermis, it is not only produced by fibroblasts but also by keratinocytes, similarly to type VII collagen (6Grässel S. Unsold C. Schacke H. Bruckner-Tuderman L. Bruckner P. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 309-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 7Ryynänen J. Sollberg S. Parente M.G. Chung L.C. Christiano A.M. Uitto J. J. Clin. Investig. 1992; 89: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which these collagens are transported across the basement membrane and incorporated into the mesenchymal stroma is yet unknown. Although many matrix proteins self-assemble and thus contribute to the organization of supramolecular networks, cells also affect the architecture of the ECM networks by grasping and moving ECM proteins. Most of these cell-matrix interactions are mediated via integrins, a huge family of cell adhesion molecules (reviewed in Ref. 8Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6955) Google Scholar). Integrins consist of two subunits, α and β. Both subunits associate with their N-terminal domains to form the integrin head, which harbors the divalent cation-dependent binding site for its extracellular matrix ligand. Both subunits span the plasmalemma once, and with their short C-terminal cytoplasmic domains they interact with the actin cytoskeleton. By connecting the ECM with the cytoskeleton, integrins are not only responsible for mechanical anchorage of the cell but also transfer signals from the ECM into the cell and vice versa (8Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6955) Google Scholar, 9Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E.

Thus, via integrins, the components of the ECM not only induce cellular reactions, such as cell adhesion, spreading, migration, and gene activation, in an outside-in fashion, but can also be remodeled by the cells in an inside-out manner (11Akiyama S.K. Yamada S.Y. Chen W.-T. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 863-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Four collagen-binding integrins have been described so far (12Eble J.A. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2005; 11: 867-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 13Heino J. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 319-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Although the integrins α10β1 and α11β1 are mainly found on differentiated chondrocytes (14Camper L. Hellman U. Lundgren-Akerlund E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20383-20389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) and mesenchymal progenitor cells of developing skeletal muscle tissue (15Tiger C.F. Fougerousse F. Grundstrom G. Velling T. Gullberg D. Dev. Biol. 2001; 237: 116-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), respectively, the two integrins, α1β1 and α2β1, show a broader tissue distribution. Integrin α1β1 is expressed in various tissues, e.g. in smooth muscle cells surrounding small blood vessels, in neuronal tissue, epithelial cells, and (pre)adipocytes (12Eble J.A. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2005; 11: 867-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 16Gardner H. Kreidberg J. Koteliansky V. Jaenisch R. Dev.

Integrin α2β1 is not only the collagen-binding integrin on platelets and involved in collagen-induced platelet activation and blood clotting, but it is also localized in mesenchymal cells and in epithelial cells abutting the basement membrane (12Eble J.A. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2005; 11: 867-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 18Santoro S.A. Zutter M.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 813-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Its high expression level on basal layer keratinocytes is drastically reduced during their terminal differentiation and concomitant loss of basement membrane contact (19Watt F.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3919-3926Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Until now, no direct interaction with cells has been reported for collagen XVI, nor has any cell surface adhesion molecule yet been identified that may mediate such a cellular interaction. Similar tissue distribution of the integrins, α1β1 and α2β1, and of collagen XVI in skin prompted us to investigate the potential interaction of this FACIT molecule with these collagen-binding integrins. Here we demonstrate that cells can interact with collagen XVI via the integrins α1β1 and α2β1. Furthermore, we narrowed down the putative α1β1 integrin-binding site within a C-terminal tryptic fragment of collagen XVI, which includes the domains COL1-3. Materials—RuGli cells were provided by Dr. F. Ruggiero (Institute de Biologie et Chimie des Protéines, CNRS UMR 5086, Lyon, France). Both RuGli and HT1080 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) under 5% CO2. For the assays, cells were harvested with 0.5 mm EDTA in PBS and washed with DMEM. The monoclonal antibody (mAb) Ha31/8 against rat integrin α1 subunit was purchased from Pharmingen. The mAb AGF-1 directed against the human integrin α1 subunit was a generous gift from Dr. H. Gardner (Biogen, Cambridge, MA). Monoclonal antibodies against the integrins were from different sources: P1E6 from Chemicon (Hampshire, UK); JA202, JA208, JA215, JA218, and JA221 with well characterized epitopes (20Tuckwell D.S.

Hybridoma cells producing mAb 9EG7 against the human integrin β1 subunit were provided by Dr. D. Vestweber (University of Münster, Münster, Germany). Generation of antibodies directed against recombinant collagen XVI is described elsewhere (22Kassner A. Tiedemann K. Notbohm H. Ludwig T. Mörgelin M. Reinhardt D.P. Chi M.L. Bruckner P. Grässel S. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 339: 835-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Antibodies were purified by affinity chromatography on protein A and G columns according to standard procedures. The anti-vinculin-mAb hVinc, purified from ascites (Sigma), was covalently labeled with digoxigenin using digoxigenin-N-(hydroxysuccinimidyl) ester (Roche Diagnostics) in a 400-fold molar surplus. The antibody JA221 was biotinylated with a 500-fold molar excess of biotin-hexanoic-N-(hydroxysuccinimidyl) ester (Pierce). Recombinant expression and purification of human collagen XVI and of soluble α2β1 integrin have been described previously (22Kassner A. Tiedemann K. Notbohm H. Ludwig T. Mörgelin M. Reinhardt D.P.

Immunofluorescence Staining of Skin Sections—Cryosections of adult murine skin were fixed for 10 min at 4 °C with -20 °C cold acetone and incubated for 1 h at 37°C in blocking solution consisting of 5% goat serum (Dako Serotec, Düsseldorf, Germany) and 1% BSA in Complete Mini® protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics) dissolved in PBS. When biotinylated primary antibodies were used, sections were subsequently saturated with the Biotin Blocking System X0590 (Dako) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After washing with PBS, sections were incubated with the following primary antibodies in blocking solution without BSA for 2 h at 37°C: biotinylated murine mAb AGF-1, the murine monoclonal antibody JA221, diluted 1:1000 and 1:100, respectively, and a protein A-purified polyclonal antibody raised against recombinant collagen XVI in guinea pig, diluted 1:50. After washing with PBS, the appropriate secondary antibodies were applied in blocking solution without BSA for 1 h at 37 °C as follows: Alex-aFluor 488-conjugated streptavidin, AlexaFluor 488-conjugated anti-(mouse IgG) antibodies, and AlexaFluor 555-conjugated anti-(guinea pig IgG) antibodies (all from Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands), each at a final concentration of 5 μg/ml. After washing with PBS, sections were counterstained with the nuclear dye DAPI (Molecular Probes) for 7 min at 300 nm in PBS and subsequently mounted with Fluoromount (Dako). Micrographs were taken with a laser scanning microscopic unit C1 (Nikon GmbH, Düsseldorf, Germany) at the indicated magnifications. Cell Adhesion Assay with Recombinant Collagen XVI—Multiwell plates were coated with recombinant collagen XVI dissolved in PBS at 4 °C overnight. Nonspecific protein-binding sites were blocked with 1% BSA in PBS for 2 h at room temperature. RuGli and HT1080 cells were added to each well at a cell density of 0.5 × 106 cells/ml in DMEM, supplemented with either 1 mm MnCl2 or 10 mm EDTA. Cells were allowed to adhere for 30-45 min at 37 °C under 5% CO2. After a single wash with PBS, adherent cells were fixed with 70% (v/v) ethanol for 7 min, stained with 0.2% (w/v) crystal violet (Sigma) for 30 min, and thoroughly rinsed with water to remove excess dye. Cell-absorbed crystal violet was extracted with 70% ethanol, and absorbance was measured at 560 nm. Background values of cells attached to BSA were subtracted. For mAb inhibition studies, the multiwell plates were coated with 5 μg/ml recombinant collagen XVI in PBS. The cells were preincubated with the mAbs for 20 min before they were added to the wells. All other steps were carried out as in the adhesion assay described above. Immunofluorescence Staining of Collagen-binding Integrins in Cells—The wells of a chamber slide (Greiner, Frickenhausen, Germany) were coated with recombinant collagen XVI at 40 μg/ml, with the collagen IV fragment CB3[IV] at 2 μg/ml, with collagen I at 10 μg/ml, or with fibronectin at 5 μg/ml (Invitrogen) at 4 °C overnight. After washing with PBS, the wells were blocked with 0.1% heat-denatured BSA in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. RuGli and HT1080 cells suspended in DMEM with or without 0.1 mm MnCl2 were added at a density of 200,000 and 50,000 cells/ml into the substrate-coated wells. After incubation for 2 h at 37°C under 5% CO2, adherent wells were washed with PBS supplemented with 2 mm each of MgCl2 and CaCl2, with or without 0.1 mm MnCl2, and fixed with 2% formaldehyde in the same buffer for 7 min at room temperature. After triple washing with PBS, cells were permeabilized and blocked with blocking buffer (0.5% saponin, 2.5% methanol, 2% horse serum in PBS) for 1 h. RuGli cells were stained with rabbit antiserum directed against the integrin α1 subunit (24Kern A. Eble J.A. Golbik R. Kühn K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and murine anti-vinculin mAb hVinc (Sigma), diluted in blocking buffer 1:500 and 1:250, respectively, for 1.5 h. These primary antibodies were then detected with AlexaFluor 568-conjugated anti-(rabbit IgG) antibodies and AlexaFluor 488-conjugated anti-(mouse IgG) antibodies (both from Molecular Probes). These secondary antibodies were diluted 1:400 and 1:500 in blocking buffer and incubated for 1.5 h. HT1080 cells were incubated for 1.5 h with 5 μg/ml biotinylated JA221 and 10 μg/ml digoxigenin-labeled mAb hVinc, both in blocking buffer. Detection was performed by incubation for 1.5 h with AlexaFluor 555-conjugated streptavidin (Molecular Probes), diluted 1:1000, and fluorescein-labeled anti-digoxigenin antibodies (Roche Diagnostics) at 10 μg/ml, both dissolved in blocking buffer. Incubation steps with both primary and secondary antibodies were followed by three washing steps with blocking buffer for 15 min each. Finally, all cells were shortly rinsed with water and mounted in Fluoromount G (Molecular Probes). Pictures were taken with a confocal laser scanning microscope (Nikon PCM 2000) with at least six pictures averaged to minimize the background noise. Generation, Production, and Purification of a Soluble α1β1 Integrin—The cDNA encoding the full-length human integrin α1 subunit including the 28-amino acid rat signal sequence was kindly provided by Dr. E. E. Marcantonio (Columbia University, New York) as an insert in the pLEN-vector, as described previously (25Briesewitz R. Epstein M.R. Marcantonio E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2989-2996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 3119-bp sequence, which codes for the signal sequence and the amino acids 1-1008 of the mature integrin α1 ectodomain, was excised from this pLEN-integrin α1 plasmid using SalI and BamHI. The BamHI- and AgeI-flanked DNA-fragment, 340 bp in length, which codes for amino acids 1009-1113 of the ectodomain, and a short spacer stretch containing a factor X cleavage site, was generated by PCR using the pLEN-integrin α1 plasmid as template and the following primer pair: forward primer, 5′CCC CAT ATC TTT GAG GAT CCT TTC 3′, and reverse primer, 5′GCC ACC GGT TCT TCC TTC GAT CCC TCC TGG CAC TCT GCC CGG TAG 3′, with the restriction sites of BamHI and AgeI, respectively, underlined. The insect cell expression vector pUC-HygMT-α3Fos (26Eble J.A. Wucherpfennig K.W. Gauthier L. Dersch P. Krukonis E. Isberg R.R. Hemler M.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10945-10955Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) was cleaved by SalI and AgeI. By a triple ligation, the SalI-BamHI fragment and the BamHI-AgeI-flanked PCR amplicon, encoding the N- and C-terminal parts, respectively, of the integrin α1 ectodomain were directionally introduced into the cleaved pUC-HygMT vector and thus joined to its C-terminal Fos zipper sequence via a factor X cleavage site. The PCR-derived DNA sequence was verified by sequencing. The pUC-HygMT-β1XJun plasmid encoding the integrin β1 ectodomain with a factor X cleavage site and the dimerizing leucine zipper motif of Jun was derived from the pUC-Hyg-β1Jun plasmid (26Eble J.A. Wucherpfennig K.W. Gauthier L. Dersch P. Krukonis E. Isberg R.R. Hemler M.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10945-10955Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) by inserting the factor X cleavage site-coding sequence. Both constructs were cotransfected into Drosophila Schneider cells, which were then selected by hygromycin. After two rounds of subcloning by limited dilution, the clone 2H4 was established for α1β1 integrin production. To produce soluble α1β1 integrin, the clone 2H4 was grown in spinner flasks to a density of 12 × 106/ml. After induction with 0.8 mm Cu2+ ions for 5 days, the cell supernatant was harvested, concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon Millipore, Schwalbach, Germany), and loaded onto a CB3[IV] column. Soluble α1β1 integrin was eluted by 10 mm EDTA. Its concentration and purity were determined by BCA test (Pierce) and SDS-PAGE. Integrin Binding to Collagen XVI and Inhibition by mAb—Recombinant collagen XVI dissolved at 20 μg/ml in PBS was coated onto a multiwell plate at 4 °C overnight. After washing with PBS, the wells were blocked with 1% heat-inactivated BSA in TBS, pH 7.4 (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl), supplemented with 2 mm MnCl2. The recombinant soluble integrins α1β1 and α2β1 were diluted in the same buffer, supplemented with either 1 mm MnCl2 or 1 mm MnCl2 together with the integrin-activating mAb 9EG7 or 10 mm EDTA alone (non-specific background). After binding to collagen XVI, unbound integrins were washed off twice with HEPES-washing buffer (50 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm MnCl2). Bound integrins were fixed with 2.5% glutardialdehyde in HEPES-washing buffer for 10 min and detected by ELISA using a rabbit antiserum directed against the integrin β1 subunit and subsequently an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-(rabbit IgG) antibody (Sigma) as described previously (23Eble J.A. Beermann B. Hinz H.-J. Schmidt-Hederich A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12274-12284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Affinity constants were calculated from the titration curves as described previously (24Kern A. Eble J.A. Golbik R. Kühn K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). For antibody inhibition studies, wells coated with 20 μg/ml collagen XVI were incubated with constant concentrations of the integrins α1β1 (100 nm) or α2β1 (300 nm). The anti-integrin α1-mAb AGF-1 was used at different concentrations. Binding of soluble α2β1 integrin to collagen XVI was individually challenged with a panel of anti-α2 integrin mAbs each at 600 nm. Bound integrins were detected after fixation by the ELISA procedure described above. Limited Trypsin Digestion of Collagen XVI— 0.5 mg of recombinant collagen XVI, dissolved in PBS, was digested with trypsin (Sigma) at an enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:100 in the presence of 5 mm CaCl2 for 30 min at 20 °C. After stopping the reaction with 1 μg/ml aprotinin, the digestion mixture was diluted with 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 5.6 (Mono S-buffer A), and applied to a Mono S column (Amersham Biosciences). The integrin-binding triple-helical fragment with an SDS-PAGE-determined molecular mass of each chain of about 64 kDa was eluted in a linear gradient from 0 to 1 m NaCl in Mono S buffer A at 0.5 ml/min. Cross-linkage of Soluble α1β1 Integrin with the Triple-helical Tryptic Collagen XVI Fragment—Soluble α1β1 integrin was dialyzed four times against 50 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 μm MnCl2. Then the integrin was mixed with the Mono S eluate fraction containing the tryptic collagen XVI fragment. The mixture containing 0.1 mg/ml (360 nm) integrin and about 5 μg/ml (26 nm) tryptic fragment was supplemented with MgCl2 and MnCl2 to final concentrations of 1 mm and 10 μm, respectively. After addition of bis-(sulfo-N-hydroxy-succinimidyl)-suberate (BS3) (KMF, Lohmar, Germany) to 0.2 mm, the mixture was incubated for 2 h at 20 °C. The cross-linking reaction was stopped with 5 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0. To purify the complex of α1β1 integrin and the triple-helical collagen XVI fragment, the solution was diluted with 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.9 (Mono Q buffer A) and loaded onto a Mono Q column (Amersham Biosciences). The complex was separated from noncross-linked proteins in a gradient of 0-0.5 m NaCl in Mono Q buffer A. Eluate fractions that contained the covalent complex of α1β1 integrin and tryptic collagen XVI fragment were identified by Western blotting using antibodies specifically directed against either integrin or collagen XVI. Negative Staining of the Covalent Complex Consisting of α1β1 Integrin and the Tryptic Collagen XVI Fragment or Full-length Collagen XVI—The Mono Q-eluate fractions containing the covalent complex of α1β1 integrin and tryptic collagen XVI fragment were submitted to negative staining. 5-μl aliquots of cross-linked protein solutions were adsorbed for 1 min on carbon-coated grids, which had been rendered hydrophilic by glow discharge at low pressure beforehand. Adsorbed samples were washed with 2 drops of water and stained with 2 drops of 0.75% (w/v) uranyl formate. Specimens were visualized in a Jeol JEM 1230 electron microscope operated at an accelerating voltage of 60 kV. Images were recorded with a Gatan Multiscan 791 CCD camera. Contour length analysis was carried out with Digital-Micrograph software (Gatan Inc.). Electron Microscopy of Complexes of α1β1 Integrin and Full-length Collagen XVI—Soluble α1β1 integrin was purified on a Mono Q column (Amersham Biosciences) in a 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer containing 0.5 mm MgCl2 and 20 μm MnCl2 by a gradient of 0-500 mm NaCl. Collagen XVI was dialyzed against 200 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 7.9. Both binding partners were allowed to react for 3 min in the presence of integrin-activating antibody 9EG7. Then they were mixed with an equal volume of 80%(v/v) glycerol and squeezed between two freshly cleaved mica pieces. Specimens were then dried for 2 h in a high vacuum. Subsequently, they were decorated with 3 nm platinum/carbon at a low angle on a rotating table, followed by coating with 10 nm carbon at a 90° angle. Replicas were floated off on distilled water and picked up on 400 mesh copper grids. In parallel experiments, specimens were subjected to negative staining. Finally, complexes were visualized by transmission electron microscopy, as described above. Collagen XVI and the Integrins α1β1 and α2β1 Show Overlapping Distribution Patterns within Skin Tissue—In adult skin, collagen XVI is characteristically confined to narrow zones below basement membranes at the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ) of the upper papillary dermis, of hair follicles, and around fatty tissue (Fig. 1, red fluorescence), in accordance with previous results (6Grässel S. Unsold C. Schacke H. Bruckner-Tuderman L. Bruckner P. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 309-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To study potential interactions of dermal and epidermal cells with collagen XVI, we performed immunofluorescence stainings of adult mouse skin sections with monoclonal antibodies directed against the α subunits of the collagen-binding integrins α1β1 and α2β1. In particular, integrin α2β1 is prominently expressed by the basal layer keratinocytes lining the epidermal side of the DEJ basement membrane (Fig. 1, G-I, green fluorescence). The integrin α1β1 exhibits a much weaker and broader distribution within the epidermal cell layers compared with the restricted α2β1 integrin expression. Instead, it is found around dermal hair follicles (Fig. 1, A-C, green fluorescence) and within the adipose tissue in deeper skin layers (Fig. 1, D-F, green fluorescence). Double immunofluorescence staining with antibodies directed against collagen XVI and integrin α1β1 displayed a partial colocalization of both proteins within the adipose tissue in the deeper dermal layers (Fig. 1, D-F). Additionally, cells of the inner sheet of dermal hair bulbs exhibited a strong α1β1 integrin signal, whereas cells of the outer root sheet are positive for collagen XVI (Fig. 1, A-C). Double immunofluorescence staining of collagen XVI and α2β1 integrin revealed an adjacent, very close location of collagen XVI with α2β1 integrin within the basement membrane zone of the DEJ (Fig. 1, G-I). Although collagen XVI appeared to be more abundant on the dermal face of the DEJ zone, opposite to the α2β1 integrin-rich basal layer keratinocytes, it is also found within the basement membrane itself forming the borderline between the dermal and epidermal compartment. The partially overlapping tissue distribution prompted us to test a putative interaction of collagen XVI with α1β1 or α2β1 integrin-bearing cells. Integrins α1β1 and α2β1 Mediate Cell Attachment to Collagen XVI—To study potential cell contacts with collagen XVI in more detail, recombinant human collagen XVI was isolated from a 293 EBNA cell expression system in sufficient quantities and high purity. After its immobilization to multiwell plates, collagen XVI was utilized as attachment substratum for two prototypic cell lines. The rat glioma cell line RuGli was used because these cells mediate their contacts with collagen principally through integrin α1β1, whereas human HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells are known to interact with collagen mainly via integrin α2β1 (27Vandenberg P.

Cells of both lines attached to the immobilized collagen XVI in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2, A and B). Cell attachment was completely abolished by EDTA, typical of an integrin-mediated process. Likewise, addition of Mn2+, which activates β1 integrins, enhanced adhesion of RuGli cells to collagen XVI. Remarkably, adhesion of these cells in the presence of Mn2+ ions also showed an elevated plateau value, thus indicating increased adhesion strength (Fig. 2A). This activating effect was less pronounced for HT1080 cells interacting with collagen XVI (Fig. 2B). To prove whether the attachment of RuGli and HT1080 cells to immobilized collagen XVI was mediated"

The three-dimensional structure of its water-soluble form is known, but that of the membrane-bound HlyE complex is not. We have used electron microscopy and image processing to show that the pores are predominantly octameric. Three-dimensional reconstructions of HlyE pores assembled in lipid/detergent micelles suggest a degree of conformational variability in the octameric complexes. The reconstructed pores were significantly longer than the maximum dimension of the water-soluble molecule, indicating that conformational changes occur on pore formation."

Homology modeling of guanylate cyclase, based on the crystal structure of adenylate cyclase, reveals a single GTP-binding site and a putative second site pseudosymmetric to the GTP-binding site. However, the role of this pseudosymmetric site has remained unclear. Using equilibrium dialysis, we identified two nucleotide-binding sites with high and low affinity for α,β-methylene guanosine 5′-triphosphate (GMP-CPP). In contrast, 2′-dADP occupied both sites with equivalent affinities. Adenosine-5′-β,γ-imido triphosphate (AMP-PNP), which competitively inhibited the cyclase reaction, bound solely to the high affinity site, indicating the role of this site as the catalytic site. The function of the low affinity site was examined using allosteric activators YC-1 and BAY 41-2272. YC-1 significantly reduced the affinity of 2′-dADP, probably by competing for the same site as 2′-dADP. BAY 41-2272 totally inhibited the specific binding of one molecule of 2′-dADP as well as GMP-CPP. This suggests that the activators compete with these nucleotides for the low affinity site. Infrared and EPR analyses of the enzymic CO- and NO-hemes also supported the suggested role of the low affinity site as a target for the activators.

The NO-mediated stimulation of enzyme activity occurs in two steps: a six-coordinate NO complex is initially formed in the reaction with NO, which is then converted to an active five-coordinate NO complex, resulting in rupture of the weak His-iron bond (17Makino R.

Guanylate cyclases, including soluble and particulate forms, have several functional and structural features common to those of adenylate cyclases. Both classes of enzyme catalyze the cyclization of chemically related compounds (i.e. GTP and ATP). Mammalian ACs contain two cytoplasmic catalytic domains, designated C1 and C2, that share 35% sequence identity (19Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 461-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar, 20Smit M.J. Iyengar R. Adv. Second. Messenger Phophoprotein Res. 1997; 32: 1-21Crossref Google Scholar, 21Tang W.-J. Yan S. Drum C. Adv. Second. Messenger Phophoprotein Res. 1997; 32: 137-151Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). When mixed together, the isolated C1 and C2 domains form an active heterodimer, which is stimulated by forskolin, a specific activator of AC (22Whisnant R.E. Gilman A.G. Dessauer C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6621-6625Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 23Yan S.-Z. Hahn D. Haung Z.-H. Tang W.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10941-10945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In contrast, neither the C2 nor the C1 homodimer display detectable enzyme activity. The crystal structure of the C1-C2 heterodimer reveals a shallow trough at the interfacial region created by the head-to-tail association of the C1 and C2 domains (24Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). ATP-binding site and pseudosymmetric site are formed within the cleft of the interfacial region: the former site where catalysis occurs and the latter site that binds forskolin. In contrast, the C2 homodimer contains two forskolin-binding sites within the cleft (25Zhang G. Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Hurley J.H. Nature. 1997; 386: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). sGC consists of two similar subunits, α- and β-subunits, both of which contain a C-terminal catalytic domain with a nucleotide-binding motif homologous to that of the C1 and C2 domains of mammalian ACs (26Nakane M. Arai K. Saheki S. Kuno T. Buechler W. Murad F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16841-16845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A modeling study, using the crystal structure of AC as a template, predicted that the association of the C-terminal regions of sGC creates a single GTP-binding site similar to that of AC, as well as a potential pseudosymmetric site at the interfacial region (27Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Rao V.D. Hurley J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13414-13419Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The GTP-binding site includes amino acid residues responsible for catalysis, whereas the pseudosymmetric site lacks several basic residues thought to be required for catalysis. By analogy with the forskolin-binding site of AC, one might predict that the pseudosymmetric site constitutes the binding site for YC-1 (3-(5′-hydroxymethyl-3′-furyl)-1-benzylindazol), which is known to sensitize sGC to activation by NO and CO (28Friebe A. Schultz G. Koesling D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6863-6868Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Chang et al. (29Chang F.-J. Lemme S. Sun Q. Sunahara R.K. Beuve A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11513-11519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) has shown that ATP analogue ATPγS alters the cyclase activity presumably by acting at the pseudosymmetric site. Unlike NO, YC-1 and BAY 41-2272 (3-(4-amino-5-cyclopropyrpyrimidine-2′-furyl)-1-(2-fluorobenzyl)-1H-pyrazolo(3,4-b)pyridine) are non-heme-binding allosteric activator of sGC (28Friebe A. Schultz G.

The NO-sensitizing action of YC-1 is due to the facilitated formation of an active five-coordinate NO-heme (31Makino R. Obayashi E. Homma N. Shiro Y. Hori H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11130-11137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the sensitizing action of YC-1 is explained by preventing the release of NO from the active NO-heme (32Russwurm M. Mergia E. Mullershausen F. Koesling D. J. Biol.

Similarly, the CO sensitization by YC-1 and BAY 41-2272 is associated with the formation of five-coordinate CO-heme (31Makino R. Obayashi E. Homma N. Shiro Y. Hori H. J. Biol.

Administration of BAY 41-2272 was found to initiate a physiological response in the NO-sGC signaling pathway (30Stasch J.-P. Becker E.M. Alonso-Alija C. Apeler H. Dembowsky K. Feurer A. Gerzer R.

Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Although it has been reported that YC-1 occupied the same site as BAY 41-2272 (30Stasch J.-P. Becker E.M. Alonso-Alija C. Apeler H. Dembowsky K. Feurer A. Gerzer R. Minuth T. Perzborn E. Pleiss U. Schröder H. Schroeder W. Stahl E. Steinke W. Straub A. Schramm M. Nature. 2001; 410: 212-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), no direct experimental evidence for the location of this site has been obtained. For instance, several investigators proposed the N-terminal half of the α-subunit as a target for YC-1 (30Stasch J.-P. Becker E.M. Alonso-Alija C. Apeler H. Dembowsky K. Feurer A. Gerzer R. Minuth T.

Chem. 2003; 278: 12590-12597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), whereas a recent mutational study supported the presence of a YC-1-binding site on the C-terminal part (37Lamothe M. Chang F.-J. Balashova N. Shirokov R. Beuve A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3039-3048Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In the present study, we identified two nucleotide-binding sites/heterodimeric sGC by equilibrium dialysis. Until recently such kinds of experiments were not possible because of the limited quantity of purified protein. Functional analyses by kinetics together with infrared and EPR spectroscopic studies indicate that one of the two sites constitutes the substrate site responsible for catalysis. The other site was considered to be a pseudosymmetric site, which exclusively serves as the binding site for YC-1 or BAY 41-2272. Our model not only explains the data described in the present study but also consolidates the results from previous investigations. Enzyme Purification—Fresh bovine lung (5 kg) was minced and homogenized using a Waring blender in 12 liters of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing a mixture of protease inhibitors of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm EDTA, and 55 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Protease inhibitors and β-mercaptoethanol were included in all the buffers throughout the purification unless stated otherwise. The successive purification steps of the enzyme were the same as those described earlier (31Makino R. Obayashi E. Homma N. Shiro Y. Hori H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11130-11137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The purified enzyme preparations were stored in liquid nitrogen until use. Spectral Measurements—Optical absorption spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Lambda 18 spectrophotometer. The temperature of the cuvette holder was controlled by thermomodule elements. The buffer used was 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm NaCl and 5% (v/v) glycerol. EPR spectra were measured on a Varian E-12 X-band EPR spectrometer (Varian, Palo Alto, CA) with 100-kHz field modulation at 77 K, as described previously (17Makino R. Matsuda H. Obayashi E. Iizuka T. Shiro Y. Hori H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7714-7723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The infrared spectra were measured at 27 °C on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Spectrum One Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer fitted with a mercury-cadmium-telluride detector. The cell had CaF2 windows with a light path length of 0.1 mm. Equilibrium Dialysis—The buffer used for equilibrium dialysis was 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm NaCl and 5% (v/v) ethylene glycol supplemented with 4% (v/v) DMF to maintain the desired concentration of the poorly soluble YC-1. The concentration of DMF was increased to 7% (v/v) in experiments to test the effects of BAY 41-2272, because this compound had lower aqueous solubility than YC-1. The additions of 5% ethylene glycol and 4% or 7% DMF did not significantly affect the enzyme activity. A five-cell equilibrium dialyzer (Spectrum Laboratories, Rancho Dominguez, CA) was used for dialysis. Dialysis half-cells (250 μl) were separated by dialysis membrane with a cut-off of 14 kDa. One half-cell was filled with the ferrous enzyme, and the opposite half-cell contained the desired amount of nucleotides and/or effectors, YC-1 and BAY 41-2272. Other details were given in the appropriate figure legends. The dialysis chamber was shaken at a constant rate of 94 strokes/min at 4 °C or 69 strokes/min at 25 °C. The reaction achieved equilibrium within 12 and 6 h at 4 and 25°C, respectively. After dialysis for 16 h at 4 °C and 7–8 h at 25 °C, nucleotides in each half-cell were quantified by HPLC analysis using a C18 or an anion exchange column at a constant flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. An aliquot of the sample was used for spectrophotometric determination of the enzymic heme concentration. The amount of enzyme-bound nucleotide was estimated from the difference in the concentration between the two half-cells, with and without enzyme. Equilibrium binding of nucleotides with ferrous sGC was analyzed by saturation binding and Scatchard plots (38Scatchard G. Ann. New York Acad. Sci. 1948; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17805) Google Scholar). Dissociation constant (Kd) and the maximum number of the binding sites (Bmax) for the binding of nucleotides were determined by nonlinear regression analyses of saturation binding plots and by linear or nonlinear analysis of Scatchard plots. In Scatchard plot analyses, the B/(nucleotide)free was plotted on the ordinate against fractional saturation (B = (nucleotide)bound/(sGC)total) on the abscissa. The plot yields a straight line with a slope of −1/Kd and an intercept on the horizontal axis that gives the maximum number of bound nucleotide (Bmax). The Kd and Bmax were determined by KELL or GraphPad Prism. Kinetic Measurements—Inhibition of guanylate cyclase activity by ATP analogues was kinetically analyzed in the presence of a desired amount of these analogues. The buffer used was 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, containing 5% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm Mn2+, 5 mm DTT, and 50 mm NaCl. The reaction mixture (150 μl) included 0.014 μm sGC. The reaction was started by the addition of 5 μl of S-nitroso-N-acetyl-d,l-penicillamine (4 mm) and was incubated for 10 min at 27 °C. After terminating the reaction by the addition of 5 μl of 30% (v/v) acetic acid, the concentration of cGMP was determined by HPLC analysis as described previously (17Makino R. Matsuda H. Obayashi E. Iizuka T. Shiro Y. Hori H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7714-7723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The initial velocity was linear with time for 15 min irrespective of the concentration of GTP. All of the experimental points were averages of three independent assays. Reagents—GMP-CPP was purchased from Jena Bioscience GmbH (Jena, Germany) and used without further purification. All of the other nucleotides were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Japan (Tokyo, Japan). We further purified these nucleotides on a preparative C18 HPLC column to avoid ambiguity caused by impurities included in the commercially available preparations. The final purity of each nucleotide was >95%. YC-1 and BAY 41-2272 were purchased from ALEXIS (San Diego, CA). Other chemicals, purchased from Wako Chemicals Co. (Tokyo, Japan), were of the highest commercial grade. Stoichiometry of GMP-CPP Binding—The stability of several GTP analogues during dialysis was checked. Of nucleotides tested, only GMP-CPP was stable, but the other analogues, including guanosine-5′-β,γ-imido triphosphate and dGTP, were metabolized to cGMP during dialysis. Other nucleotides including 2′-deoxy-3′-GMP (uncompetitive inhibitor) and cGMP exhibited no detectable affinity for the ferrous enzyme even in the presence of an excess amount of pyrophosphate. Saturation plots for GMP-CPP binding in the presence of metal cofactors such as Mn2+ are illustrated in Fig. 1. The binding of Mn2+-GMP-CPP is not univalent. Nonlinear regression analysis, based on the two-site model without constraints, indicates the presence of two classes of binding sites; there are a high affinity site with a Kd = 5.5 μm and a Bmax = 0.90, and a low affinity site with a Kd = 188 μm and a Bmax = 1.12. A Scatchard plot for the binding of Mn2+-GMP-CPP becomes curved at elevated concentrations of the nucleotide, representing the presence of the high and low affinity sites for the binding of this nucleotide (Fig. 1, inset). Ca2+-GMP-CPP also occupied both sites, but the saturation curve appeared to be univalent (Fig. 1). Although the result means that the affinity of the high affinity site was reduced to a level comparable with that of the low affinity site when Ca2+ was included, we were unable to estimate the minor difference by nonlinear curve fitting based on the two-site model. Accordingly, the Ca2+-GMP-CPP binding was analyzed by the one-site model. The result yielded the Bmax = 2.07 and Kd = 109 μm (Fig. 1). However, Mg2+-GMP-CPP gave no reliable data because of the extremely low affinity: Kd > 400 μm (Fig. 1). For this reason, we have selected Mn2+ and Ca2+ as metal cofactors in the present analyses, although both metals may not be physiologically important. The presence of two classes of binding sites is not due to degradation of the enzyme during dialysis, because the subunit structure and the optical absorption spectrum of the enzyme are significantly unaffected before and after dialysis (supplemental Fig. S1). Moreover, 75–90% of the enzyme activity was recovered after dialysis. A non-univalent saturation as shown in Fig. 1 generally represents either two independent classes of binding site, with high and low affinities for the ligand, or a negatively cooperative interaction between binding sites. The latter possibility is less likely because 2′-dADP binds independently to the two sites as described below. Therefore we propose that the enzyme has both high and low affinity binding sites for the nucleotide. Hereafter, we designate the two binding sites as the “high affinity site” and the “low affinity site” accordingly. The presence of nonequivalent binding site was not limited to nucleotide with guanine base, because binding of AMP-CPP displayed high and low affinity sites (Fig. 2A). To examine the function of the individual nucleotide-binding sites, we searched for nucleotides that selectively bind to either the high or the low affinity site. Of the nucleotides tested, 2′-dADP inhibited the binding of GMP-CPP, i.e. the addition of 0.5 mm 2′-dADP reduced the amount of the enzyme-bound GMP-CPP from 23.5 to 5.8 μm at 4 °C (data not shown). This result suggests that 2′-dADP occupies the same sites as GMP-CPP or possibly adjacent sites that overlap with those for GMP-CPP. Although 2′-dADP binds unselectively to both sites, it is nevertheless useful for analyzing the function of individual binding sites (see below). By contrast, AMP-PNP reduced the Bmax for the binding of GMP-CPP to 0.97 from 2.02 at 4 °C (▴ in inset of Fig. 1), suggesting that AMP-PNP is tightly and selectively associated with the high affinity site. Binding of AMP-PNP and 2′-dADP—In contrast to the binding of GMP-CPP and AMP-CPP (Figs. 1 and 2A), AMP-PNP occupies solely a single binding site with high affinity both in the presence of Mn2+ and Ca2+ (Fig. 2B). This result together with finding described above (Fig. 1, inset, ▴) suggests that AMP-PNP binds exclusively to the high affinity site. This site would not be a target for YC-1, because the high affinity site constitutes catalytic site as described below. As expected, YC-1 has no significant effect on the AMP-PNP binding, suggesting that the binding site of YC-1 is distinct from the high affinity site (Fig. 2C). It seems likely that the high affinity site participates in catalysis. Indeed, we confirmed that the high affinity site serves as the catalytic site by kinetic analyses. The initial velocity of the cyclase reaction in the presence of various amounts of AMP-PNP was plotted against the concentration of GTP. Analysis by Lineweaver-Burk plot shows that AMP-PNP displays competitive inhibition with a single intersection point on the ordinate, indicating that GTP and AMP-PNP occupy the same site (Fig. 3A). A secondary plot, in which the slopes were plotted versus the concentration of AMP-PNP, was linear (Fig. 3A, inset). The analysis of data obtained by the secondary plot gave inhibition constants (Ki) of 15.0 μm at 27 °C (Fig. 3A, inset) and 5.1 μm at 10 °C (data not shown). The Ki at 10 °C essentially agreed with the Kd for AMP-PNP binding under comparable conditions (1.5 μm at 4 °C; Fig. 2B). Taking these results into consideration, we propose that the high affinity site corresponds to the catalytic site of the enzyme. The Lineweaver-Burk plot for inhibition by 2′-dADP gave the intersection point above the abscissa and to the left of the ordinate (Fig. 3B). This inhibition pattern agrees with that of a mixed type inhibition, a mixture of competitive and noncompetitive inhibition (39Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Willey & Sons, Inc., New York1975: 176-177Google Scholar). Thus, binding of 2′-dADP to the substrate site excludes the substrate (i.e. GTP), whereas binding to the noncompetitive site has no effect on GTP binding, although the resulting complex is catalytically inactive. The secondary plot that is concave upwards with increasing concentrations of 2′-dADP (Fig. 3B, inset) suggests that 2′-dADP binds to at least two sites (39Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Willey & Sons, Inc., New York1975: 176-177Google Scholar). Saturation plots of the 2′-dADP binding determined in the presence of Mn2+ at 4 and 25 °C and of Ca2+ at 4 °C were univalent with Bmax =∼2 (Fig. 4). These results represent the two binding sites of 2′-dADP with equivalent affinities irrespective of the metal used as a cofactor. The Kd of 38.4 μm in the presence of Mn2+ at 25 °C essentially agreed with Ki determined kinetically under comparable conditions (∼30 μm at 27 °C), as shown in the inset of Fig. 3B. Taken together, these findings indicate that 2′-dADP binds to the high and low affinity sites with equivalent affinities and also suggest that the noncompetitive inhibitory site corresponds to the low affinity site. Effect of YC-1 on the Binding of 2′-dADP—In contrast to the effect on binding of AMP-PNP (Fig. 2C), YC-1 impairs the affinity of 2′-dADP without changing the Bmax for 2′-dADP (i.e. Bmax = 1.95) at 25 °C (Fig. 4B). Such a mode of inhibition implies that YC-1 competes for the same sites as 2′-dADP. If it is assumed that YC-1 binds solely to the low affinity site, the resultant saturation curve should be a biphasic curve consisted of high and low affinity components. However, we were unable to experimentally obtain a biphasic curve, because YC-1 reduces the binding affinity of 2′-dADP by only about 1.5-fold (Fig. 4B). We thus tested whether 2′-dADP was able to inhibit the binding of YC-1. We have previously reported the presence of a single binding site for YC-1 with Kd = 124 μm at 27 °C in the absence of metal cofactor (31Makino R. Obayashi E. Homma N. Shiro Y. Hori H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11130-11137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In the present work, we examined the effect of metal on the binding of YC-1. As shown in Fig. 5A, 1.18 molecule of YC-1 was found to bind to the ferrous sGC with a Kd of 51.9 μm in the presence of Mn2+ at 25 °C. This indicated that the addition of Mn2+ increased the affinity of YC-1 by about 2.5-fold without changing the Bmax. No significant effects of AMP-PNP on the YC-1 binding (Fig. 5B, left columns) confirm again that the binding site of YC-1 is distinct from the high affinity site. The addition of 2′-dADP inhibited the binding of YC-1, but the inhibitory effect was incomplete even in the presence of an excess amount of 2′-dADP (Fig. 5B). Although partial inhibition by 2′-dADP renders likely the possibility of YC-1 binding to the low affinity site, this result is inadequate to conclude the binding of YC-1 to the low affinity site. To solve the issue, we have used BAY 41-2272 instead of YC-1, because BAY 41-2272 has been reported to tightly bind to sGC and to occupy the same site as YC-1 (30Stasch J.-P. Becker E.M.

Soc. 2005; 127: 4625-4631Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Indeed, BAY 41-2272 effectively prevented the binding of YC-1 to sGC (Fig. 5B), confirming a previous report (30Stasch J.-P. Becker E.M. Alonso-Alija C. Apeler H. Dembowsky K. Feurer A. Gerzer R. Minuth T. Perzborn E. Pleiss U. Schröder H. Schroeder W. Stahl E. Steinke W. Straub A. Schramm M. Nature. 2001; 410: 212-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Effect of BAY 41-2272 on the Binding of GMP-CPP and 2′-dADP—In Fig. 6, the binding of GMP-CPP or 2′-dADP is compared in the presence and the absence of BAY 41-2272. BAY 41-2272 apparently abolished the low affinity component of the GMP-CPP binding, as indicated by a decrease in the Bmax to 1.08 (Fig. 6A). The affinity for the binding of GMP-CPP to one site in the presence of BAY 41-2272 essentially agreed with that for the high affinity site (8.2 versus 5.5 μm; compare Fig. 6A with Fig. 1). Likewise, the binding of BAY 41-2272 prevented 2′-dADP from binding to either of the two sites (Fig. 6B). The Kd (44.4 μm) of 2′-dADP for a single site is comparable with that for 2′-dADP binding in the absence of BAY 41-2272 (38.4 μm) (Fig. 4B). These results are"

Violaxanthin is bound to each of the antenna proteins of both photosystems. Former studies with recombinant Lhcb1 and different Lhca proteins implied that each antenna protein contributes specifically to violaxanthin conversion related to protein-specific affinities of the different violaxanthin binding sites.

Recombinant proteins were reconstituted with different xanthophyll mixtures to study the conversion of violaxanthin at different xanthophyll binding sites in these proteins. The extent and kinetics of violaxanthin de-epoxidation were found to be dependent on the respective protein and, for each protein, also on the binding site of violaxanthin. In particular, violaxanthin bound to Lhcb4 was nearly inconvertible for de-epoxidation, whereas violaxanthin bound to Lhcb5 was fully convertible but with slow kinetics. Lhcb6 exhibited heterogeneous violaxanthin conversion characteristics, which could be assigned to different populations of reconstituted Lhcb6 complexes with respect to violaxanthin binding sites. The results support the proposed different binding affinities of violaxanthin to the three putative violaxanthin binding sites (V1, N1, and L2) in antenna proteins.

Despite this high structural similarity, however, antenna proteins differ from each other with respect to their pigment binding properties.

The role of Zx in thermal energy dissipation has been related to the binding of two molecules of Zx to the PsbS protein of PSII (23Ruban A.V. Pascal A.A. Robert B. Horton P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7785-7789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 24Aspinall-O'Dea M. Wentworth M. Pascal A. Robert B. Ruban A. Horton P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Based on spectroscopic analysis, a direct involvement of Zx in the quenching process due to the presence of a Chl-Zx heterodimer and the formation of a carotenoid (Car) cation has been proposed as the molecular mechanism of energy quenching in PSII (26Holt N.E. Zigmantas D. Valkunas L. Li X.P. Niyogi K.K. Fleming G.R. Science. 2005; 307: 433-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar, 27Ma Y.Z. Holt N.E. Li X.P. Niyogi K.K. Fleming G.R. Proc. Natl.

Graf M. Rech J. Jahns P. Planta. 2006; 223: 532-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). It is, thus, likely that energy dissipation is related to different mechanisms including different quenching sites and that each single antenna protein contributes to the concerted response of the organized thylakoid macrostructure (20Horton P. Wentworth M. Ruban A. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 4201-4206Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Binding of xanthophylls to antenna proteins has been supposed to limit the conversion of Vx to Zx in the xanthophyll cycle (34Jahns P. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 35Härtel H. Lokstein H. Grimm B. Rank B. Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 471-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In vivo analysis of the dynamics of xanthophyll conversion demonstrated that the extent and kinetics of Zx formation differ in single antenna subcomplexes (36Färber A. Young A.J. Ruban A.V. Horton P. Jahns P. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 1609-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), most likely reflecting different affinities of Vx binding sites in different antenna proteins. It is reasonable to assume that these characteristics of Vx conversion are related to different functions of the single antenna proteins in the dissipation of excess light energy. To understand the contribution of each of the single antenna proteins and/or specific xanthophyll binding sites to the formation of Zx (and, thus, to energy dissipation), the convertibility of Vx to Zx has been investigated in recombinant antenna proteins. Recent studies on recombinant Lhcb1 (37Jahns P. Wehner A. Paulsen H. Hobe S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22154-22159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and Lhca1-4 (38Wehner A. Storf S. Jahns P. Schmid V.H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26823-26829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) brought evidence that Vx bound to V1 and N1 is, like non protein-bound Vx, easily accessible for de-epoxidation, whereas Vx bound to L2 is only partially, and/or with slower kinetics, convertible to Zx. These characteristics are likely to reflect the different affinities of Vx to the respective xanthophyll binding sites in the distinct antenna proteins. In this work we investigated the de-epoxidation characteristics of the three minor PSII antenna proteins, Lhcb4 - 6, which are supposed to bind Vx at the L2 site under in vivo conditions (6Morosinotto T. Caffarri S. Dall'Osto L. Bassi R. Physiol. Plant. 2003; 119: 347-354Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Recombinant proteins were reconstituted with different xanthophyll mixtures to gain information about the characteristics of Vx conversion at the different Car binding sites in these proteins. Clearly different de-epoxidation characteristics were found for each of the minor PSII antenna proteins, confirming the importance of protein-specific properties for the regulation of Vx conversion to Zx. Together with former studies on the other LHC proteins our data allow us to relate the multiphasic kinetics of Vx de-epoxidation found under in vivo conditions and isolated thylakoids to different xanthophyll binding properties of the single antenna proteins. Isolation and Cloning of lhcb4, lhcb5, and lhcb6 Genes—The cDNA fragments of a tobacco cDNA library (Nicotiana tabacum) were cloned into the EcoRI site of the Lambda ZAP II vector system (Stratagene). For screening of the cDNA library for the minor antenna proteins, heterologous sequence tag clones from Solanum lycopersicum (accession numbers X61287 and M32606 for lhcb5 and lhcb6, respectively) and Arabidopsis thaliana (accession number X71878 for lhcb4) were used (kindly provided by Bernhard Grimm). Samples were [32P]dCTP-labeled using the Random Primers DNA labeling system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's manual. Plaque hybridization was performed overnight at 65 °C (for lhcb5 and lhcb6) or 56 °C (for lhcb4) in hybridization buffer (0.75 m NaCl, 75 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0, 0,1% SDS, 0,1 mg/ml salmon sperm, 1 g/liter Ficoll 400, 1 g/liter polyvinylpyrrolidone, 1 g/liter bovine serum albumin), and hybridized filters were exposed to a radiographic film (Eastman Kodak Co.). In vivo excision of the phagemid was achieved by using the ExAssist™/SOLR™ system (Stratagene). The cDNA sequences were analyzed with the PCGENE program (Intelligenetics, Mountain View, CA). The sequences have been submitted to the GenBank™ data base with accession numbers DQ676843 (for Lhcb4), DQ676844 (for Lhcb6), and DQ676845 (for Lhcb5). Cloning of the Overexpression Plasmids—The coding sequences of the respective mature antenna proteins of Lhcb6, Lhcb5, and Lhcb4 were cloned into the overexpression vector pET21a (Novagene) using the BamHI and Hin-dIII restriction sites. For DNA amplification, the following primer sets were used: Lhcb6, 5′-ATAATTGGATCCGCGGCAGCAGCTGCTCCCAAG-3′ and 5′-GCGCCGAAGCTTCAAACCAAGAGCTCCAAGGGGTAT-3′, Lhcb5, 5′-ATAATTGGATCCAAGAAGGCTGCTGCTGCCCCT-3′ and 5′-GCGCAGAAGCTTCAAAGTGGGGGCTCTTTCAGC-3′; Lhcb4, 5′-GAGAGGGGATCCCGATTCGGATTCGGAAAAAA-3′ and 5′-GCGGCGAAGCTTAGAGAAGAAGCCGAATGTGTC-3′. Overexpression and Reconstitution of LHC Apoproteins—For overexpression, the plasmids were transformed into the Escherichia coli strain BL21. Overexpression and purification of the proteins as inclusion bodies were carried out following the protocol established for recombinant Lhcb1 protein (39Paulsen H. Rümler U. Rüdiger W. Planta. 1990; 181: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Protein quantification was performed using the Bio-Rad dye binding assay according to the manufacturer's manual. Pigments used for reconstitution were isolated from pea thylakoids as described in Paulsen and Schmid (40Paulsen H. Schmid V.H.R. Smith A.G. Witty M. Heme, Chlorophyll and Bilins: Methods and Protocols. Humana Press Totowa, NJ2002: 235-253Google Scholar). Reconstitution was performed using the detergent exchange method (41Schmid V.H.R. Cammarata K.V. Bruns B.U. Schmidt G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7667-7672Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The reconstitution mixture for Lhcb6 complexes contained 180 μg of the inclusion body protein, 300 μg of Chl (a/b = 1), and 45 μg of xanthophylls. For Lhcb4 complexes the same assay was used, but the Chl a/b concentration was raised to 3. Lhcb5 complexes were reconstituted with a mixture of 240 μg of protein, 300 μg of Chl (a/b = 3), and 45 μg of xanthophylls. Xanthophylls were added as single species or in 1:1 ratios. In Vitro De-epoxidation—In vitro de-epoxidation was carried out with VxDE extracts from spinach chloroplasts as described before (37Jahns P. Wehner A. Paulsen H. Hobe S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22154-22159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For repurification of the de-epoxidized complexes, samples were concentrated with Centricon YM-50 tubes after 2 h of de-epoxidation. The concentrated sample was loaded on a sucrose gradient (0.1-0.8 m sucrose, 5 mm Tricine, pH 7.6, and 0.06% β-dodecyl maltoside) and centrifuged for 18 h at 300,000 × g and 4 °C. The resulting bands were harvested with a syringe, and the pigment content was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Pigment Analysis—Pigments were extracted from all samples with 2-butanol (42Martinson, T. A., and Plumley, F. G. (21995) Anal. Biochem. 228, 123-130Google Scholar) and analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC as described earlier (36Färber A. Young A.J. Ruban A.V. Horton P. Jahns P. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 1609-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Spectroscopy—Fluorescence emission spectra (PerkinElmer Life Sciences luminescence spectrometer LS 55) were recorded at room temperature. The samples were diluted to a Chl concentration of 1 μg/ml in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 0.06% β-dodecyl maltoside, 20% glycerol, 200 μg/ml glucose oxidase, and 40 μg/ml katalase. Apoproteins of Lhcb4 - 6 were overexpressed in E. coli and reconstituted with pigment extracts isolated from spinach thylakoids. The xanthophyll mixture used for reconstitution was varied to yield either complexes with the native xanthophyll composition (Lhcb4 and Lhcb5, Lut + Vx + Nx; Lhcb6, Lut + Vx) or complexes, in which either Lut or Nx were replaced by Vx. The pigment composition of the different complexes is summarized in Table 1. The pigment stoichiometry per monomer of Lhcb4 and Lhcb5 complexes with the native xanthophyll composition (Lhcb4-LVN and Lhcb5-LVN) was in agreement with the data published for recombinant proteins of Zea mays (43Crimi M. Dorra D. Bosinger C.S. Giuffra E. Holzwarth A.R. Bassi R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 260-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 44Croce R. Canino G. Ros F. Bassi R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7334-7343Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In accordance with the literature, two xanthophylls per monomer are bound by these complexes. The slightly higher stoichiometries obtained in Lhcb5 complexes in presence of Nx (Lhcb5-LVN and Lhcb5-NV) may indicate that a third xanthophyll binding site might be occupied under these reconstitution conditions. In Lhcb6, significantly less than two xanthophylls were found per monomer when the data are normalized to 10 Chls per monomer (Table 1). This is in contrast to the stoichiometry of two xanthophylls per monomer (or 10 Chls) reported in other studies (45Pagano A. Cinque G. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17154-17165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 46Moya I. Silvestri M. Vallon O. Cinque G. Bassi R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12552-12561Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Thus, either a fraction of recombinant Lhcb6 binds only one xanthophyll per monomer under our reconstitution conditions, or the number of coordinated Chl molecules is lower than 10. The latter possibility is supported by the fact that Lhcb6 is known to be rather unstable and tends to loose Chl molecules in its isolated form (45Pagano A. Cinque G. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17154-17165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). If the data are normalized to 8 Chl per monomer, a stoichiometry of two xanthophylls per monomer would also be given in Lhcb6.TABLE 1Pigment stoichiometries of reconstituted Lhcb4-6 Apoproteins of Lhcb4-6 were reconstituted with different pigment mixtures as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After reconstitution, complexes were concentrated and separated from free pigments by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. For quantification, pigments were extracted with 2-butanol from the respective gradient bands and analyzed by HPLC. Data are normalized to yield the stoichiometries per monomer assuming that 8, 9, and 10 Chls (a + b) are coordinated per monomer of Lhcb4, -5, and -6, respectively. Mean values (±S.D.) of 6-10 independent experiments are shown.

It can, thus, be assumed that Lut was stoichiometrically replaced by Vx in Lhcb6-V. Reconstitution of Lhcb5 in the absence of Nx (Lhcb5-LV) or Lut (Lhcb5-NV), however, resulted in a reduction of the Chl a/b ratio, reflecting the variability of this complex in binding either Chl a or Chl b without affecting the xanthophyll binding properties (44Croce R. Canino G. Ros F. Bassi R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7334-7343Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In Lhcb5, it was therefore possible to replace both Nx and Lut by Vx. Only in Lhcb4, reconstitution in the absence of Nx (Lhcb4-LV) or Lut (Lhcb4-NV) led to a reduction of the xanthophyll binding capacity. It has to be noted, however, that the stoichiometries of Nx and Lut per monomer are not altered in the presence and absence of Lut and Nx, respectively. It can, thus, be assumed that the binding affinity of Vx to the Nx and Lut binding site is reduced in comparison with Nx and Lut, respectively. As a consequence, a fraction of Lhcb4 complexes bound only one xanthophyll per monomer when either Nx or Lut was absent during reconstitution. The functionality of the recombinant proteins was tested by recording the fluorescence emission spectra at excitation wavelengths that preferentially excite Chl a (440 nm) or Chl b (475 nm) (Fig. 1). Independent of the excitation wavelength, fluorescence emission was found to peak at about 680 nm in Lhcb4, supporting the functional coupling of the chlorophylls in these complexes (Fig. 1, A-C). Only in Lhcb4-LV complexes (Fig. 1B), a very faint shoulder at about 660 nm was visible upon excitation of Chl b at 475 nm, indicating that a small fraction of the excitation energy is not completely transferred from Chl b to Chl a. A similar picture was found for Lhcb5 complexes reconstituted with the full complement of xanthophylls (Lhcb5-LVN, Fig. 1D). Reconstitution in the absence of Nx (Lhcb5-LV) or Lut (Lhcb5-NV) resulted in a more pronounced shoulder of the emission spectra at 660 nm (Fig. 1, E and F), indicating again a less efficient energy transfer from Chl b to Chl a in a small fraction of complexes. It should be noted that the appearance of the shoulder at 660 nm in Lhcb4-LV, Lhcb5-LV, and Lhcb5-NV correlates with the reduction of the Chl a/b ratio in comparison with the complexes with the native xanthophyll composition, Lhcb4-LVN, and Lhcb5-LVN, respectively (see Table 1). The markedly increased peak at 660 nm upon excitation at 475 nm in Lhcb6 under both reconstitution conditions (Fig. 1, G and H) is in agreement with former studies on recombinant Lhcb6 from maize (45Pagano A. Cinque G. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17154-17165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, even in Lhcb6 complexes with the native xanthophyll composition (Lhcb6-LV), a pronounced fraction of the excitation energy is not efficiently transferred from Chl b to Chl a. This property of recombinant Lhcb6 might be related to the fraction of complexes that possibly binds only one xanthophyll per monomer (see above). The enzymatic conversion of Vx to Zx in the reconstituted LHCs was studied during 2 h of incubation at 20 °C with a VxDE extract isolated from spinach thylakoids. Non-protein-bound Vx, which was used as the control substrate to test the VxDE activity in each assay was nearly completely de-epoxidized within 10 min (Fig. 2A). In recombinant Lhcb6 complexes with the native xanthophyll composition (Lhcb6-LV, Fig. 2B), ∼35% of the Vx was convertible to Zx with somewhat slower kinetics as non-protein bound Vx, whereas the remaining fraction of Vx was not accessible for de-epoxidation (Table 2). We ensured that the activity of the enzyme did not limit the reaction by testing the conversion of freshly added Vx at the end of the experiment (not shown). Thus, two different populations of Lhcb6-LV complexes must exist that differ in the accessibility of Vx for de-epoxidation. After replacement of Lut by Vx (Lhcb6-V, Fig. 2C), about 40% of the Vx was converted to Zx with even more retarded kinetics than before (Table 2). Obviously, the replacement of Lut by Vx induced only a partial increase of the Vx convertibility. This indicates that Vx is not accessible for de-epoxidation at the (former) Lut binding sites in Lhcb6.TABLE 2Kinetics of Vx conversion Under assumption of an irreversible first order reaction, rate constants were determined for the Vx conversion shown in Figs. 1, 2, 3. For simplification, analyses were restricted to the first step of de-epoxidation (Vx → Ax). For all Lhcb5 complexes (Fig. 3) and non-protein-bound Vx (Fig. 2A), data points were fitted with two exponentials, in all other cases with a single exponential (k1). Amplitudes (A1 and A2) and rate constants (k1 and k2) represent mean values ± S.D. of three independent experiments.SampleAmplitudeRate constantA1A2k1k2%10−3 min−1Non protein-bound Vx85 ± 415 ± 4310 ± 3010 ± 6Lhcb4-LVN15 ± 1270 ± 40Lhcb4-LV31 ± 2290 ± 60Lhcb4-NV17 ± 1230 ± 40Lhcb5-LVN10 ± 190 ± 1290 ± 803 ± 0.2Lhcb5-LV76 ± 424 ± 3250 ± 2010 ± 5Lhcb5-NV27 ± 273 ± 1460 ± 104 ± 0.3Lhcb6-LV36 ± 190 ± 6Lhcb6-V38 ± 130 ± 3 Open table in a new tab In Lhcb5, the de-epoxidation characteristics were different (Fig. 3). In all complexes a biphasic conversion was found (Table 2). The majority of complexes with the native xanthophyll composition (Lhcb5-LVN, Fig. 3B) showed slower conversion kinetics than the corresponding complexes of Lhcb6, and the reaction was not completed within the time frame of the experiment. Fitting of the data indicated that all of the Vx bound to Lhcb-LVN was convertible to Zx but with strongly retarded kinetics in comparison with non-protein-bound Vx (Table 2). It can, thus, be assumed that Vx is generally accessible for de-epoxidation in Lhcb5, but Vx conversion occurs only with very slow kinetics. After reconstitution of Lhcb5 in the absence of Nx (Lhcb5-LV, Fig. 3B), the Vx convertibility was dramatically accelerated (Table 2). The rapid and complete deepoxidation of most of the Vx (about 75%) under these conditions let us conclude that the presence of Nx is responsible for the restriction of the Vx accessibility in Lhcb5-LVN complexes. On the other hand, when Lut was omitted from the reconstitution assay (in Lhcb5-NV, Fig. 3D), the fraction of rapidly convertible Vx was increased in comparison with Lhcb5-LVN complexes. About 30% of the Vx pool was convertible with fast kinetics (like the majority of Lhcb5-LV complexes), and about 70% was convertible with slow kinetics (like the majority of Lhcb5-LVN complexes) (Table 2). According to the increased fraction of rapidly convertible Vx in Lhcb5-LV complexes, we assume that this portion of Vx is related to complexes that did not bind Nx. Vx de-epoxidation in r"
https://openalex.org/W2053366738,"Replicative senescence of human keratinocytes is determined by a progressive decline of clonogenic and dividing cells, and its timing is controlled by clonal evolution (i.e., the transition from stem cells to transient amplifying and postmitotic cells). Progressive increase of p16INK4a (inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 4A) expression has been shown to correlate with keratinocyte clonal evolution. Thus, the aim of our study is to understand whether p16INK4a accumulation is a triggering mechanism of epidermal clonal evolution or a secondary event. We show that inactivation of p16INK4a, by an antisense strategy, allows primary human keratinocytes to escape replicative senescence. Specifically, p16INK4a inactivation alone blocks clonal evolution and maintains keratinocytes in the stem cell compartment. Antisense excision is followed by keratinocyte senescence, confirming that persistent p16INK4a inactivation is required for maintenance of clonal evolution block. Immortalization is accompanied by resumption of B-Cell Specific Moloney murine leukemia virus site 1 (Bmi-1) expression and telomerase activity, hallmarks of tissue regenerative capacity. In turn, Bmi-1 expression is necessary to maintain the impairment of clonal evolution induced by p16INK4a inactivation. Finally, p16INK4a down-regulation in transient amplifying keratinocytes does not affect clonal evolution, and cells undergo senescence. Thus, p16INK4a inactivation appears to selectively prevent clonal conversion in cells endowed with a high proliferative potential. These data indicate that p16INK4a regulates keratinocyte clonal evolution and that inactivation of p16INK4a in epidermal stem cells is necessary for maintaining stemness."
https://openalex.org/W1964267001,"The human mitochondrial NAD(P)+-dependent malic enzyme (m-NAD-ME) is a malic enzyme isoform with dual cofactor specificity and substrate binding cooperativity. Previous kinetic studies have suggested that Lys362 in the pigeon cytosolic NADP+-dependent malic enzyme has remarkable effects on the binding of NADP+ to the enzyme and on the catalytic power of the enzyme (Kuo, C. C., Tsai, L. C., Chin, T. Y., Chang, G.-G., and Chou, W. Y. (2000) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 270, 821-825). In this study, we investigate the important role of Gln362 in the transformation of cofactor specificity from NAD+ to NADP+ in human m-NAD-ME. Our kinetic data clearly indicate that the Q362K mutant shifted its cofactor preference from NAD+ to NADP+. The Km(NADP) and kcat(NADP) values for this mutant were reduced by 4-6-fold and increased by 5-10-fold, respectively, compared with those for the wild-type enzyme. Furthermore, up to a 2-fold reduction in Km(NADP)/Km(NAD) and elevation of kcat(NADP)/kcat(NAD) were observed for the Q362K enzyme. Mutation of Gln362 to Ala or Asn did not shift its cofactor preference. The Km(NADP)/Km(NAD) and kcat(NADP)/kcat(NAD) values for Q362A and Q362N were comparable with those for the wild-type enzyme. The ΔG values for Q362A and Q362N with either NAD+ or NADP+ were positive, indicating that substitution of Gln with Ala or Asn at position 362 brings about unfavorable cofactor binding at the active site and thus significantly reduces the catalytic efficiency. Our data also indicate that the cooperative binding of malate became insignificant in human m-NAD-ME upon mutation of Gln362 to Lys because the sigmoidal phenomenon appearing in the wild-type enzyme was much less obvious that that in Q362K. Therefore, mutation of Gln362 to Lys in human m-NAD-ME alters its kinetic properties of cofactor preference, malate binding cooperativity, and allosteric regulation by fumarate. However, the other Gln362 mutants, Q362A and Q362N, have conserved malate binding cooperativity and NAD+ specificity. In this study, we provide clear evidence that the single mutation of Gln362 to Lys in human m-NAD-ME changes it to an NADP+-dependent enzyme, which is characteristic because it is non-allosteric, non-cooperative, and NADP+-specific. The human mitochondrial NAD(P)+-dependent malic enzyme (m-NAD-ME) is a malic enzyme isoform with dual cofactor specificity and substrate binding cooperativity.

Mutation of Gln362 to Ala or Asn did not shift its cofactor preference. The Km(NADP)/Km(NAD) and kcat(NADP)/kcat(NAD) values for Q362A and Q362N were comparable with those for the wild-type enzyme. The ΔG values for Q362A and Q362N with either NAD+ or NADP+ were positive, indicating that substitution of Gln with Ala or Asn at position 362 brings about unfavorable cofactor binding at the active site and thus significantly reduces the catalytic efficiency. Our data also indicate that the cooperative binding of malate became insignificant in human m-NAD-ME upon mutation of Gln362 to Lys because the sigmoidal phenomenon appearing in the wild-type enzyme was much less obvious that that in Q362K. Therefore, mutation of Gln362 to Lys in human m-NAD-ME alters its kinetic properties of cofactor preference, malate binding cooperativity, and allosteric regulation by fumarate. However, the other Gln362 mutants, Q362A and Q362N, have conserved malate binding cooperativity and NAD+ specificity. In this study, we provide clear evidence that the single mutation of Gln362 to Lys in human m-NAD-ME changes it to an NADP+-dependent enzyme, which is characteristic because it is non-allosteric, non-cooperative, and NADP+-specific. Malic enzymes are a newly discovered family of oxidative decarboxylases that catalyze the conversion of the substrate l-malate to CO2 and pyruvate, with concomitant reduction of NAD(P)+ to NAD(P)H (1Hsu R.Y.

However, site-directed mutagenesis and kinetic studies have demonstrated that ATP may actually act as an active-site inhibitor rather than an allosteric inhibitor (30Hung H.-C. Chien Y.C. Hsieh J.-Y.

These structural data establish malic enzymes as a new class of oxidative decarboxylases with a discrete backbone structure (6Xu Y. Bhargava G. Wu H. Loeber G. Tong L.

Human m-NAD-ME in various complexes with malate/pyruvate, Mn2+/Mg2+, NAD+, fumarate, and transition state analog inhibitors has been reported (6Xu Y. Bhargava G. Wu H. Loeber G. Tong L.

In the structure of human m-NAD-ME, there are two NAD+-binding sites located in the active center and the exosite at the tetramer interface, respectively (Fig. 1A). In addition, a fumarate-binding site is located at the dimer interface (Fig. 1A) (33Yang Z. Lanks C.W. Tong L. Structure (Lond.). 2002; 10: 951-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Pigeon c-NADP-ME in complex with NADP+, Mn2+, and the transition state analog oxalate, as well as Ascaris suum m-NAD-ME in complex with NADH and the inhibitor tartronate, has also been reported (8Yang Z. Zhang H. Hung H.-C. Kuo C.C. Tsai L.C. Yuan H.S. Chou W.Y. Chang G.-G. Tong L. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 332-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 9Coleman D.E. Rao G.S.J. Goldsmith E.J.

Moreover, A. suum m-NAD-ME is activated by fumarate binding to a separate allosteric site (28Karsten W.E. Pais J.E. Rao G.S.J. Harris B.G. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9712-9721Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Malic enzymes have high amino acid sequence conservation but distinct cofactor specificities. Previous kinetic studies have suggested that Lys362 in pigeon c-NADP-ME has noteworthy impact on the binding of NADP+ to the enzyme as well as a considerable effect on the catalytic power of the enzyme. The structure of pigeon c-NADP-ME reveals that the 2′-phosphate of NADP+ is placed on the surface of the enzyme and interacts with Ser346 and the ammonium side chain of Lys362 (8Yang Z. Zhang H. Hung H.-C. Kuo C.C. Tsai L.C. Yuan H.S. Chou W.Y. Chang G.-G. Tong L. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 332-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Sequence alignments of malic enzymes revealed that Lys362 is completely conserved among NADP+-dependent malic enzymes, but in NAD+-dependent malic enzymes, residue 362 is glutamine instead (Fig. 1B). This prompted us to examine the effect of mutation of Gln362 to Lys on the cofactor specificity of human m-NAD-ME. In this study, we provide detailed kinetic evidence delineating the determinants of the dual cofactor specificity and substrate cooperativity of human m-NAD-ME. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to identify the significance of Gln362 in the cofactor specificity, substrate cooperativity, and catalytic activity of the enzyme. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Malic Enzymes—The detailed expression and purification steps for human m-NAD-ME were described previously (3Loeber G. Infante A.A. Maurer-Fogy I. Krystek E. Dworkin M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3016-3021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Bhargava G. Mui S. Pav S. Wu H. Loeber G. Tong L. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 127: 72-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, m-NAD-ME was cloned into the expression vector pRH281 and transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 cells for overexpression of the enzyme under the control of the inducible trp promoter system (3Loeber G. Infante A.A. Maurer-Fogy I. Krystek E. Dworkin M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3016-3021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The overexpressed enzyme was purified by anion exchange DEAE-Sepharose chromatography (Amersham Biosciences), followed by ATP-agarose affinity chromatography (Sigma). After purification, the enzyme was buffer-exchanged and concentrated in 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) using Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter devices (Millipore Corp.) with a molecular mass cutoff at 30 kDa. The enzyme purity was examined by SDS-PAGE, and the protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (35Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). The purified DNA of human m-NAD-ME was used as template, and the desired primers were used to mutate the Gln362 codon to the Ala, Lys, and Asn codons using Pfu DNA polymerase, which replicated both plasmid strands with high fidelity in the PCR. The primers containing the mutated site were 25-45-mers, which were needed for specific binding of template DNA. The synthetic oligonucleotides used as mutagenic primers were 5′-GCAAAAATAGATAGTTATGCTGAACCATTTACTCACTCAGC-3′ for Q362A, 5′-GCAAAAATAGATAGTTATAAA GAACCATTTACTCACTCAGC-3′ for Q362K, and 5′-GCAAAAATAGATAGTTATAACGAACCATTTACTCACTCAGC-3′ for Q362N (with the mutation positions underlined and in boldface). After 16-18 temperature cycles, mutated plasmids including staggered nicks were produced. The PCR products were then treated with DpnI to digest the human wild-type m-NAD-ME templates. Finally, the nicked DNAs containing the desired mutations were transformed into the Escherichia coli XL-1 strain, and their DNA sequences were checked by autosequencing. Enzyme Kinetic Analysis—The enzyme reaction was measured by the production of NADH or NADPH. The reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm malate (pH 7.4), various concentrations of NAD+ or NADP+, and 10 mm MgCl2 in a total volume of 1 ml. The absorbance at 340 nm at 30 °C was instantly recorded after the enzyme was added to the reaction mixture and monitored continuously in a Beckman DU 7500 spectrophotometer. In this process, 1 unit of enzyme is defined as the enzyme amount that catalyzes the production of 1 μmol of NAD(P)H/min. An absorption coefficient of 6.22 mm−1 for NAD(P)H was used in the calculations. Apparent Michaelis constants of the substrate and cofactors were determined by varying the concentration of one substrate (or cofactor) around its Km while leaving the other components unvaried at the saturated concentrations. The ATP inhibition experiment for malic enzyme activity was carried out at a series of ATP concentrations from 0 to 3 mm at different concentrations of NAD+. The total set of data was globally fitted to the following equation, which expresses a competitive inhibition pattern: v = Vmax[S]/([S] + Km(1 + [ATP]/Ki(ATP))), where v is the observed initial velocity, Vmax is the maximum rate of the reaction, Km is the Michaelis constant for the substrate, and Ki(ATP) is the inhibition constant for ATP. The sigmoidal curves of [malate] versus initial rates were fitted to the Hill equation, and data were further analyzed to calculate the K0.5 value, the substrate concentration at half-maximal velocity, and the Hill coefficient (h), which is a measure of the degree of cooperativity: v = Vmax [malate]h/(K0.5h + [malate]h). All data fitting work was performed with the SigmaPlot 8.0 program (Jandel, San Rafael, CA). Expression, Purification, and Characterization of Recombinant Human m-NAD-ME—The recombinant malic enzymes were successfully expressed and purified to apparent homogeneity (data not shown). The amounts of purified protein were 5.1, 1.7, 5.9, and 1.9 mg from 250 ml of cell lysate, and the specific activities of these enzymes were 45.2, 4.1, 1.8, and 3.8 units/mg for the wild-type (WT), Q362A, Q362K, and Q362N enzymes, respectively. The results indicate that the WT and Gln362 mutant enzymes were significantly overexpressed. The much lower specific activities of these Gln362 mutant enzymes imply that Gln362 may play an important role in the catalytic mechanism of the malic enzyme. The kinetic parameters for the recombinant malic enzymes utilizing NAD+ or NADP+ as the cofactor were determined in the absence or presence of fumarate (Table 1). The initial velocities measured in various concentrations of NAD+ or NADP+ followed hyperbolic kinetics. In the presence of fumarate, the Km(NAD) and Km(NADP) values for the WT and Gln362 mutant enzymes were reduced, and the kcat values for these enzymes were elevated, indicating that these mutant enzymes can still be allosterically activated by fumarate. The Km(NAD) values for the Gln362 mutants were increased by ∼2-4-fold compared with that for the WT enzyme, but the Km(NADP) values increased slightly for Q362A and Q362N and notably decreased for Q362K. Furthermore, the Km(NADP) values for the WT, Q362A, and Q362N enzymes were larger than the Km(NAD) values; however, the opposite results were found for the Q362K enzyme. Although fumarate always decreased the Km values for these enzymes, it seemed to be less effective in reduction of the Km(NADP) values. The decrease in the Km(NAD) values for these enzymes by fumarate was ∼1.6-3.6-fold, but the decrease in the Km(NADP) values was ∼1.2-1.9-fold.TABLE 1Kinetic parameters for human wild-type and Q362 mutant mitochondrial malic enzymesKm(NAD)Km(NADP)Km(NADP)/Km(NAD)kcat(NAD)kcat(NADP)kcat(NADP)/kcat(NAD)kcat(NAD)/Km(NAD)kcat(NADP)/Km(NADP)WT (−)0.57 ± 0.111.57 ± 0.322.8119.426.710.06209.514.27WT (+)0.16 ± 0.041.19 ± 0.147.4174.4013.960.08109011.73Q362A (−)0.95 ± 0.212.24 ± 0.602.454.083.630.0756.931.62Q362A (+)0.27 ± 0.051.40 ± 0.275.282.156.210.08304.264.44Q362K (−)0.90 ± 0.090.39 ± 0.060.427.4158.172.130.46149.15Q362K (+)0.55 ± 0.190.21 ± 0.030.455.3266.941.2100.58318.76Q362N (−)1.63 ± 0.263.36 ± 0.672.118.241.610.0911.190.48Q362N (+)0.62 ± 0.062.86 ± 0.374.636.442.660.0758.770.93 Open table in a new tab The kcat values for the WT and Gln362 mutant enzymes with NADP+ as the cofactor (kcat(NADP)) were much less than those with NAD+ as the cofactor (kcat(NAD)) except for the Q362K enzyme. The kcat(NADP) for Q362K was ∼2-fold larger than the kcat(NAD) for the enzyme, indicating that the Q362K enzyme favors NADP+ as the cofactor. The kcat(NAD) and kcat(NAD)/Km(NAD) values for the Gln362 mutants were decreased by ∼2-7- and 4-19-fold, respectively, compared with those for the WT enzyme, suggesting that this amino acid residue has its specific role in the catalytic mechanism of the malic enzyme. Similar to the kcat(NAD) and kcat(NAD)/Km(NAD) values for Q362A and Q362N, the kcat(NADP) and kcat(NADP)/Km(NADP) values for these two mutants were less than those for the WT enzyme. However, the kcat(NADP) for the Q362K enzyme was increased by ∼5- or 10-fold in the presence or absence of fumarate, respectively, compared with that for the WT enzyme. Furthermore, the kcat(NADP)/Km(NADP) values for Q362K were ∼27-35-fold higher than those for the WT enzyme. Fumarate increased the kcat(NAD) and kcat(NADP) values for these enzymes, although its effect was more pronounced in increasing the kcat(NADP) for Q362K. Fumarate increased the kcat(NAD) and kcat(NADP) values for these enzymes by ∼1.5-2.0-fold; but for Q362K, the kcat(NADP) was only slightly increased by 1.1-fold. Cooperative Effect of Malate on Wild-type and Mutant m-NAD-MEs—The initial velocities of m-NAD-ME measured in various concentrations of malate with either NAD+ or NADP+ as the cofactor demonstrated sigmoidal kinetics (Fig. 2, closed circles), which implies cooperative malate binding. Fumarate completely abolished this cooperative effect of malate. At a saturated concentration of fumarate (3 mm), which can fully activated malic enzyme activities, the curve changed from sigmoidal to hyperbolic (Fig. 2, closed triangles). For the WT (Fig. 2, A and B), Q362A (Fig. 2, C and D), and Q362N (Fig. 2, G and H) enzymes, the initial velocities at various malate concentrations in the absence of fumarate showed obvious sigmoidal kinetics, and this phenomenon was diminished after addition of fumarate. These results show that mutation of Gln362 to Ala or Asn did not change the cooperative effect of malate binding to the enzyme and that this cooperative effect could still be abolished by fumarate. For the Q362K enzyme, the cooperative effect of malate with NAD+ as the cofactor was not significant (Fig. 2E), and in contrast to the WT enzyme, both cooperativity and fumarate activation were not obvious in the Q362K enzyme with NADP+ as the cofactor (Fig. 2F), suggesting that the mutant enzyme is less sensitive to fumarate with NADP+ as the cofactor. Table 2 summarizes the results obtained from analysis of the sigmoidal curves fitted by the Hill equation. For the WT enzyme, the K0.5,malate(NAD) and K0.5,malate(NADP) values, corresponding to half-saturation for l-malate with NAD+ or NADP+ as the cofactor, were similar, and both were reduced by fumarate. This suggests that the cooperative effect of malate is independent of cofactor specificity. The Hill coefficient (h) with either NAD+ or NADP+ (hNAD and hNADP, respectively) was close to 2, and both h values were reduced almost to 1 by fumarate, indicating the conversion of cooperative to non-cooperative behavior of malate binding to the enzyme. The K0.5,malate(NAD) values for these Gln362 mutants were similar to those for the WT enzyme, but the K0.5,malate(NADP) values for Q362K were smaller than those for the WT enzyme and the other Gln362 mutants, although the K0.5,malate(NADP) values in the presence of fumarate were reduced to similar levels for the WT and mutant enzymes. The hNAD and hNADP values for Q362K were 1.57 and 1.34, respectively, which are smaller than those for the WT enzyme, suggesting that the cooperative effect of malate binding is insignificant in this mutant enzyme. The hNAD for Q362A (h = 2.39) was larger than that for the WT enzyme, but the hNADP was slightly smaller (h = 1.75). The hNAD and hNADP values for Q362N were 1.91 and 2.04, respectively, similar to those for the WT enzyme. The h values for the WT and Gln362 mutant enzymes were reduced almost to 1 in the presence of fumarate as manifested by the change of the sigmoidal curves to hyperbolic kinetics after fumarate addition (Fig. 2).TABLE 2Kinetic parameters derived from the Hill equation and Ki values for human wild-type and Q362 mutant mitochondrial malic enzymesK0.5,Malate(NAD)K0.5,Malate(NADP)hNADhNADPKi,ATP(NAD)Ki,ATP(NADP)Wild-type (−)12.84 ± 0.4815.50 ± 0.781.93 ± 0.101.94 ± 0.140.30 ± 0.040.33 ± 0.03Wild-type (+)3.26 ± 0.504.31 ± 0.661.04 ± 0.121.15 ± 0.13Q362A (−)15.87 ± 0.6612.60 ± 0.722.39 ± 0.181.75 ± 0.120.27 ± 0.060.33 ± 0.07Q362A (+)5.39 ± 1.545.25 ± 0.391.16 ± 0.211.08 ± 0.06Q362K (−)11.85 ± 0.945.68 ± 0.331.57 ± 0.141.34 ± 0.080.17 ± 0.010.32 ± 0.02Q362K (+)5.09 ± 1.423.44 ± 0.391.00 ± 0.181.06 ± 0.10Q362N (−)16.77 ± 1.6310.48 ± 0.671.91 ± 0.252.04 ± 0.200.33 ± 0.060.57 ± 0.07Q362N (+)4.79 ± 0.635.48 ± 0.511.06 ± 0.101.16 ± 0.08 Open table in a new tab Inhibitory Effect of ATP on Wild-type and Gln362 Mutant Malic Enzymes—ATP could effectively inhibit the catalytic activity of human m-NAD-ME. The inhibitory effect of ATP was more pronounced on these Gln362 mutant enzymes with NAD+ as the cofactor (Fig. 3A). Q362K was the most susceptible to ATP inhibition (Fig. 3A, closed triangles). The residual enzyme activities were in the following order: WT, Q362N, Q362A, and Q362K (Fig. 3A). However, ATP inhibition was less obvious with NADP+ as the cofactor (Fig. 3B). The inhibition curves for Q362A and Q362K with increasing ATP concentrations almost overlapped with that for the WT enzyme. The residual enzyme activities of the WT, Q362A, and Q362K enzymes were at the same level with NADP+ (Fig. 3B), but were quite different with NAD+. However, the Q362N enzyme became a little more resistant to ATP inhibition compared with the WT enzyme (Fig. 3B). ATP is an active-site inhibitor of m-NAD-ME following a competitive mechanism with respect to NAD+ and malate (29Hsu W.C. Hung H.-C. Tong L. Chang G.-G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7382-7390Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 30Hung H.-C. Chien Y.C. Hsieh J.-Y. Chang G.-G. Liu G.-Y. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12737-12745Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that the Gln362 mutants were also inhibited by ATP. A double-reciprocal plot demonstrated that all lines intercepted at the y axis, indicating simple competitive inhibition patterns (data not shown). The inhibition constants of ATP with respect to NAD+ (Ki,ATP(NAD)) and NADP+ (Ki,ATP(NADP)) were 0.30 and 0.33 mm, respectively (Table 2), indicating that the binding affinity of ATP for the enzyme is not correlated with the cofactor specificity. In contrast, the Ki,ATP(NAD) values for Q362A and Q362K (0.27 and 0.17 mm, respectively) were smaller than those for the WT enzyme. On the other hand, the Ki,ATP(NADP) values for the WT, Q362A, and Q362K enzymes were almost identical (0.32-0.33 mm), whereas Q362N had a slightly larger Ki,ATP(NADP) value (0.57 mm) compared with the WT enzyme. However, Gln362 is not primarily responsible for the binding of ATP in the active site (10Chang G.-G. Tong L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12721-12733Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 30Hung H.-C. Chien Y.C. Hsieh J.-Y. Chang G.-G. Liu G.-Y.

Structure (Lond.). 2002; 10: 951-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar); thus, no significant changes were observed in the Ki(ATP) values for the WT and Gln362 mutant enzymes. Structural studies have revealed that ATP is bound at the cofactor-binding site, residing in the adenosine diphosphate-binding region (33Yang Z. Lanks C.W. Tong L. Structure (Lond.). 2002; 10: 951-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The additional phosphate of NADP seems to have no effect on the binding affinity of ATP. Malic enzymes have discrete specificities for the dinucleotide cofactor in that some can only use NAD+ as the cofactor, whereas others can only use NADP+. Human m-NAD-ME is one of a small number of malic enzymes that have dual specificity (3Loeber G. Infante A.A. Maurer-Fogy I. Krystek E. Dworkin M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3016-3021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular basis for the cofactor selectivity of these enzymes is still poorly understood. Previous studies with other enzymes revealed that an Asp residue near the active site is expected to have an NAD+ preference and cannot tolerate the additional phosphate group of NADP+ (36Wierenga R.K. Terpstra P. Hol W.G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar, 37Scrutton N.S. Berry A. Perham R.N. Nature. 1990; 343: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). However, the respective Asp residue, Asp345, is conserved in all malic enzymes. The structures show that Asp345 is pointed away from the ribose and is ion-paired with Arg354 (10Chang G.-G. Tong L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12721-12733Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). This provides an explanation for the observation that some malic enzymes with a conserved Asp at this position can still use NADP+ as the cofactor. The cofactor-binding regions of human m-NAD-ME and pigeon c-NADP-ME are shown in Fig. 4 (A and B, respectively), with the ionic interaction between Asp345 and Arg354 indicated by green dashed lines. In c-NADP-ME, Asp354 is ion-paired not only with Arg354 but also with Lys362 (Fig. 4B). The additional salt bridge is not observed in human m-NAD-ME because the corresponding residue at position 362 is glutamine (Fig. 4A). Mutagenesis and kinetic studies have suggested that Lys362 in pigeon c-NADP-ME plays a critical role governing the cofactor specificity (38Kuo C.C. Tsai L.C. Chin T.Y. Chang G.-G. Chou W.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 821-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Mutation of Lys362 has a tremendous effect on NADP+ binding to c-NADP-ME. Thus, the NADP+ specificity is proposed to be determined by the electrostatic interactions involving the positive charge of the side chain Lys362 (Fig. 4B). This important residue is replaced by glutamine in human m-NAD-ME. The most important result of this work is our demonstration that the Gln362 mutants of human m-NAD-ME shift their cofactor specificity from NAD+ to NADP+. Cofactor Preference Shifting of the Human Q362K Enzyme—Our kinetic data clearly indicate that the Q362K mutant enzyme shifted its cofactor preference from NAD+ to NADP+. The Km(NADP) and kcat(NADP) values for this mutant were reduced by 4-6-fold and increased by 5-10-fold, respectively, compared with those for the WT enzyme. Furthermore, up to a 2-fold reduction in Km(NADP)/Km(NAD) and elevation of kcat(NADP)/kcat(NAD) were observed for the Q362K enzyme (Table 1). To evaluate the contribution of a side chain to substrate specificity in the WT enzyme relative to its change in a mutant, we further calculated the free energy change (ΔG) for the Gln362 mutant enzymes according to the following equation: ΔG = -RT ln((kcat(mut)/Km(mut)/(kcat(WT)/Km(WT))). The kcat/Km values and the ΔG values with NAD+ or NADP+ in the malic enzyme reaction are shown in Table 3.TABLE 3Free energy change (ΔG) for human wild-type and Q362 mutant mitochondrial malic enzymeskcat(NAD)/Km(NAD)kcat(NADP)/Km(NADP)ΔGNADΔGNADPm−1 s−1m−1 s−1kcal/molkcal/molWild-type (−)2.10 × 1054.27 × 1030.000.00Wild-type (+)1.09 × 1061.17 × 1040.000.00Q362A (−)5.69 × 1041.62 × 1030.780.58Q362A (+)3.04 × 1054.43 × 1030.770.59Q362K (−)3.04 × 1041.49 × 1051.16−2.14Q362K (+)1.01 × 1053.19 × 1051.43−1.99Q362N (−)1.12 × 1044.78 × 1021.761.32Q362N (+)5.88 × 1049.31 × 1021.761.53 Open table in a new tab The ΔG for Q362K with NAD+ was positive (1.16 kcal/mol), whereas that with NADP+ was negative (−2.14 kcal/mol), indicating that substitution of Gln with Lys at residue 362 in human m-NAD-ME increases the binding affinity of NADP+ at the active site and thus significantly improves the catalytic activity with NADP+ as the cofactor. Like pigeon NADP-ME, the Q362K mutant enzyme preferred NADP+ rather than NAD+ as the cofactor in catalysis. Looking at the active-site structure (Fig. 4B), these results are almost certainly due to the formation of an extra salt bridge between Lys362 and Asp345 in the Q362K enzyme. This additional ionic interaction diminishes the repulsion between Asp345 and the phosphate group of NADP+ and thus increases the tolerance of NADP+ docking in the active site, similar to the NADP+-binding mode in pigeon c-NADP-ME (Fig. 4B). Mutation of Gln362 to Ala or Asn did not shift the cofactor preference from NAD+ to NADP+. The Km(NADP)/Km(NAD) and kcat(NADP)/kcat(NAD) values for Q362A and Q362N were comparable to those for the WT enzyme (Table 1). The ΔG values for Q362A and Q362N with either NAD+ or NADP+ were positive, indicating that substitution of glutamine with alanine or asparagine at residue 362 brings about unfavorable effects on cofactor binding at the active site. Furthermore, there was no significant difference between ΔGNAD and ΔGNADP for Q362A, as was also observed for Q362N, supporting the observation that the cofactor preference of these two mutants has not changed, unlike that of Q362K. This might be due to a lack of the extra salt bridge observed between Lys362 and Asp345 in the Q362K enzyme, so the repulsion still exists between Asp345 and NADP+ in the Q362A and Q362N enzymes, and the NAD+ preference is thus conserved in these two mutant enzymes. Cooperative Effect of Malate Binding and Allosteric Activation of the Gln362 Mutant Enzymes—Our data also point out that the cooperative binding of malate became insignificant in human m-NAD-ME after mutation of Gln362 to Lys, and the sigmoidal phenomenon that appeared in the WT enzyme (Fig. 2, A and B, closed circles) was diminished in Q362K (Fig. 2, E and F, closed circles). The h values for the WT enzyme with either NAD+ or NADP+ as the cofactor were close to 2, whereas those for the Q362K enzyme were 1.57 and 1.34, respectively. This shows that the Q362K enzyme not only shifted its cofactor preference to NADP+ but also reduced its malate binding cooperativity, especially with NADP+ as the cofactor. In addition, the activating effect of fumarate on the Q362K enzyme was less noticeable (Fig. 2F), and the kcat for Q362K was not obviously elevated by addition of fumarate from 58.17 to 66.94 s−1. Therefore, mutation of Gln362 to Lys seems to change the human NAD-ME kinetic properties of cofactor preference, malate binding cooperativity, and allosteric regulation by fumarate. Substitution of Gln with Lys in human m-NAD-ME has thus made the enzyme similar to pigeon c-NADP-ME, which is characterized as non-allosteric, non-cooperative, and NADP+-specific. However, the kinetic properties of malate binding cooperativity and the NAD+ specificity of the other Gln362 mutants, Q362A and Q362N, are conserved (Fig. 2). Mutation of Gln362 to Ala or Asn did not diminish the sigmoidal binding phenomenon of malate and conserved the activating effect of fumarate, similar to the WT enzyme (Fig. 2). Moreover, the h values for Q362A and Q362N with either NAD+ or NADP+ as the cofactor also approached 2, and these values were reduced almost to 1 in the presence of fumarate, revealing that the Q362A and Q362N enzymes do not have reduced malate binding cooperativity with NAD+ or NADP+ as the cofactor. Significance of Gln362 in Catalysis of the Malic Enzyme—Gln362 seems to be involved in the catalysis of human m-NAD-ME because the kcat(NAD) values for Q362A and Q362N in the absence or presence of fumarate were notably smaller than those for the WT enzyme. Fig. 4C shows the hydrogen-bonding networks of Gln362. The amide side chain of this residue is hydrogen-bonded with Ala312 and Asn359. Mutation of Gln362 to Ala causes the enzyme to retain less than half of the enzyme activity compared with the WT enzyme, and the enzyme activity of Q362N is only ∼20% of that of the WT enzyme, suggesting that Gln362 plays an important role in catalysis. Because Gln362 is not in the catalytic triad (5Karsten W.E. Liu D. Rao G.S.J. Harris B.G. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 3626-3635Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), it may not directly participate in the catalytic reaction, but the hydrogen-bonding network involving Gln362 might be very important in maintaining the correct active-site geometry that is essential for catalysis. To our surprise, the catalytic constant (kcat) for Q362N was smaller than that for Q362A. Because the amide side chain is retained in Q362N, there might be some unanticipated hydrogen-bonding interactions between Asn362 and other amino acid residues that are unfavorable for cofactor binding, causing incorrect active-site structure for catalysis. In summary, we have provided kinetic evidence demonstrating the determinants of the dual cofactor specificity and substrate cooperativity of m-NAD-ME. Our results provide excellent explanations for elucidating the differences between m-NAD-ME and c-NADP-ME in cofactor specificity and malate cooperative binding."

Homology modeling of the extracellular domain of these proteins has revealed many molecular details, but it is not yet clear how GABA is orientated in the binding pocket. Here we have examined the role of arginine residues that the homology model locates in or close to the binding site of the GABAC receptor (Arg-104, Arg-170, Arg-158, and Arg-249) using mutagenesis and functional studies. The data suggest that Arg-158 is critical for GABA binding and/or function; substitution with Lys, Ala, or Glu resulted in nonfunctional receptors, and modeling placed the carboxylate of GABA within 3Å of this residue. Substitution of Arg-104 with Ala or Glu resulted in >10,000-fold increases in EC50 values compared with wild type receptors, and modeling indicated a role of this residue both in binding GABA and in the structure of the binding pocket. Substitution of Arg-170 with Asp or Ala yielded nonfunctional receptors, whereas Lys caused an ∼10-fold increase in EC50. Arg-249 was substituted with Ala, Glu, or Asp with relatively small (∼4–30-fold) changes in EC50. These and data from other residues that the model suggested could interact with GABA (His-105, Ser-168, and Ser-243) support a location for GABA in the binding site with its carboxylate pincered between Arg-158 and Arg-104, with Arg-104, Arg-170, and Arg-249 contributing to the structure of the binding pocket through salt bridges and/or hydrogen bonds. γ-Aminobutyric acid, type A (GABAA) receptors, of which the GABAC receptor family is a subgroup, are members of the Cys loop family of neurotransmitter receptors.

Olsen R.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 569-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1799) Google Scholar). It mediates its effects via both ionotropic (GABAA) and metabotropic (GABAB) receptors. GABAC receptors are a subfamily of GABAA receptors and are sometimes referred to as GABAρ receptors, because the first subunit identified from this class of receptor was called ρ1 (2Cutting G.R. Lu L. O'Hara B.F. Kasch L.M. Montrose-Rafizadeh C. Donovan D.M. Shimada S. Antonarakis S.E. Guggino W.B. Uhl G.R. Kazazian H.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2673-2677Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). These receptors have been separated from “classic” GABAA receptors because of their distinct pharmacological properties; GABAC receptor-mediated responses are not inhibited by bicuculline (the classic competitive GABAA receptor antagonist) nor induced by baclofen (the classic GABAB receptor agonist). In addition, 3-aminopropylphosphinic acid, a potent competitive GABAC receptor antagonist, acts as an agonist at the GABAB receptor and is inactive at the GABAA receptor, and GABA and trans-4-aminocrotonic acid are more potent agonists at GABAC receptors than GABAA or GABAB receptors (3Johnston G.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1996; 17: 319-323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus there is clearly some variation in the structures of the different GABA-binding sites contained in these receptors, although the sequence homology between GABAA and GABAC receptor subunit sequences (>25%) indicates that their basic structures will be similar (structural homology is estimated at close to 80%) and will be similar to other members of the Cys loop family (4Kusama T.

The lack of detailed structural information available for Cys loop receptors means that homology modeling is currently one of the best approaches to investigate possible molecular interactions between binding site residues and ligands. This approach has been made possible by the availability of the high resolution structure of the acetylcholine binding protein (AChBP), which is homologous to the extracellular domain of the nicotinic ACh receptor (6Brejc K. van Dijk W.J.

Generating an accurate representation of the orientation of GABA in the GABAC receptor-binding site could identify the processes involved in ligand recognition at this receptor and would also assist in drug design; current data indicate that drugs acting on GABAC receptors could possibly be used to treat visual, sleep, and cognitive disorders (4Kusama T.

It has recently been shown that Tyr-198 forms a cation-π interaction with the positive amine of GABA (15Lummis S.C. Beene D.L. Harrison N.J. Lester H.A. Dougherty D.A. Chem.

The aim of this study was to locate the other end of GABA, the carboxylate group, in the binding site. This negatively charged end of GABA has been shown to interact with one or more positively charged residues in the GABAA receptor-binding pocket (16Wagner D.A. Czajkowski C. Jones M.V. J.

Briefly, a GeneClamp 500B amplifier was connected to a PC running CLAMPEX v6.0.3 software via a DigiData1200 Series Interface (all from Axon Instruments, Inc.). Glass microelectrodes were pulled from GC150TF-10 glass capillaries (Harvard Apparatus) using a P-87 micropipette puller (Sutter) to a resistance of 0.5 mΩ and back-filled with 3 m KCl.

GABA was diluted in CFFR and applied to the bath using a Valve Bank 8 II system (Automate Scientific, Inc.). Concentration-response curves and parameters were obtained using Prism software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Cell Culture—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were maintained on 90 mm tissue culture plates at 37 °C and 7% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. They were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mix F-12 (1:1) with GLU-TAMAX I™ containing 10% fetal calf serum and passaged when confluent. The cells grown on 22-mm coverslips were transfected using calcium phosphate precipitation (19Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell.

Immunofluorescent Localization—The methodology was similar to that described for localization of the 5-HT3 receptor, as described previously (17Price K.L. Lummis S.C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23294-23301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, transfected cells were fixed in ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde and then incubated with the GABAρ1 antisera sc-21336 (which recognizes the extracellular domain) at 1:100 dilution. Biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (Vector) and fluorescein isothiocyanate avidin D (Vector) were used to detect bound antibody as per the manufacturer's instructions. The coverslips were mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector), and immunofluorescence was observed using a Nikon optiphot or confocal microscope. Modeling and Ligand Docking—The protein sequence of the extracellular domain of the human GABAρ1 receptor was aligned with the sequence of AChBP from Lymnaea stagnalis using FUGUE, and a three-dimensional homology model was generated using MODELLER 6v2 based on the crystal structure of AChBP at 2.7 Å resolution (13Harrison N.J. Lummis S.C. J. Mol. Model. 2005; : 1-8Google Scholar). The pentamer was generated by superimposing the model onto each protomer of AchBP, and the generated pentamer model was then energy-minimized using the force field implemented in MODELLER 6v2. The best model was selected after Ramachandran plot analysis of all of the generated models. Docking was carried out using GOLD 3.0 (The Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre, Cambridge, UK). Functional Studies of Wild Type and Mutant GABAC Receptors—Xenopus oocytes injected with wild type GABAρ1 receptor subunit mRNA showed robust responses to GABA application 2–4 days after injection (Fig. 2). Dose-response curves revealed an EC50 of 1.37 ± 0.18 μm and a Hill coefficient of 1.6 ± 0.25 (Table 1). These data are in good agreement with the values previously published (20Amin J. Weiss D.S.

Open table in a new tab Arginine Residues in the Binding Site—R104A and R104E mutant receptors were functional, with high EC50 values: ∼15,000 and 40,000 μm, respectively (Table 1). No responses were obtained from oocytes injected with mRNA for R104K at GABA concentrations up to 30,000 μm. Similarly, oocytes injected with mRNA from all of the receptors mutated at Arg-158 showed no responses to GABA at concentrations up to 30,000 μm. Oocytes from the same batches injected with wild type GABAρ1 mRNA showed expected responses, indicating that receptor expression in these oocytes was unaffected. R170A or R170D mutant receptors were also insensitive to GABA, but R170K mutant receptors gave rise to responses with an EC50 less than 10-fold different from wild type receptors. Arg-249 mutant receptors had relatively small increases in EC50 values (4–30-fold). Hill coefficients were not significantly changed for any of these receptors when compared with wild type receptors. Representative traces are shown in Fig. 2. Other Polar Residues—His-105 is another potentially positively charged residue that might interact with GABA and is located in the binding pocket. However, our data showed that an interaction with this residue was unlikely, because all His-105 mutants tested were functional. H105A and H105D mutants had small increases in EC50 compared with wild type receptors (3–4-fold), although there was a larger increase (∼60-fold) in EC50 for H105R mutants. Thus size appears more critical than charge here. Hill coefficients were not significantly changed. Two serine residues (Ser-168 and Ser-243) are located in the binding site and therefore may contribute to GABA stabilization via hydrogen bonds. Application of GABA to oocytes injected with mRNA for S168T and S168A mutant receptors revealed increases in EC50 of ∼10- and 50-fold, respectively, compared with wild type, whereas oocytes injected with mRNA for the S168V receptor showed no responses to GABA up to 30,000 μm. In the study of Ser-243 mutant receptors, increases in EC50 of ∼30- and ∼3-fold were observed for Thr and Ala mutants, respectively, compared with wild type. Hill coefficients were not significantly changed for any of the functional serine mutants. Immunofluorescent Localization of Wild Type and Mutant Receptors—No function was observed for R104K, R170A, R170D, R158A, R158E, R158K, and S168V mutant receptors. This indicated that these changes either affected receptor binding, gating, and/or expression. All of the nonfunctional mutants localized to the surface of HEK293 cells following transient transfection (examples are shown in Fig. 3), suggesting that global receptor folding and assembly are not significantly affected. Those receptors that reach the cell surface are presumed to be pentamers, because single Cys loop receptors subunits that do not assemble in the ER are normally degraded (22Wanamaker C.P. Christianson J.C. Green W.N. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 998: 66-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This assay was performed in mammalian cells, because there are problems from endogenous oocyte fluorescence. However, because mammalian cells are generally less tolerant of expression of ion channel proteins than oocytes, it is reasonable to assume that any receptors localized to the cell surface in HEK293 cells will also reach the surface in oocytes (17Price K.L. Lummis S.C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23294-23301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Modeling—The model revealed a GABA-binding pocket rich in aromatic residues, and in particular there was an aromatic box, consisting of Tyr-102, Tyr-198, Tyr-241, and Tyr-247, at one end of the binding site. Docking, combined with previous functional studies (15Lummis S.C. Beene D.L. Harrison N.J. Lester H.A. Dougherty D.A. Chem. Biol. 2005; 12: 993-997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), suggest that the amine of GABA is located here. There are also a number of charged and hydrophilic residues in the binding pocket that have the potential to interact with GABA: Arg-104, His-105, Met-156, Arg-158, Ser-168, Ser-197, Ser-243, and Arg-249. Docking indicated that the carboxylate end of GABA was located close to Arg-104 and Arg-158 (Fig. 4). In this study we have examined the role of the positively charged arginine residues located in the binding pocket of the GABAC receptor to define the orientation of GABA in the binding pocket. The most sensitive of these residues was Arg-158, because none of the amino acids that replaced it resulted in functional receptors. An Arg at position 104 is also important, because receptors mutated at this location were either insensitive to GABA, or their EC50 values were increased more than 10,000-fold compared with wild type. At position 170 a positively charged residue appeared required for function, whereas a variety of residues were reasonably well tolerated at position 249. If we assume that the positively charged amine of GABA is close to Tyr-198 as previously proposed (14Johnston G.A. Chebib M. Hanrahan J.R. Mewett K.N. Curr. Drug Targets CNS. Neurol. Disord. 2003; 2: 260-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), these new data are consistent with the negatively charged carboxylate being located between Arg-104 and Arg-158, although closer to the latter (Fig. 4). Examination of the model suggests that Arg-104, Arg-170, and Arg-249 may also contribute to the stability of the binding site via hydrogen bonds and/or salt bridges. Specific interactions are described in more detail below. Arg-104—The large changes in EC50 following mutation at position 104 indicates that this Arg plays an important role in the function of the receptor. Because an EC50 combines binding affinity and functional efficacy, it is not possible to tell from these data which is being affected. However, there is good evidence from GABAA receptor studies that this residue is involved specifically in binding. In the GABAA receptor α5 subunit (23Hartvig L. Lukensmejer B. Liljefors T. Dekermendjian K. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1746-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), mutation to Lys of the equivalent arginine (Arg-70) caused an ∼700-fold increase in EC50, but there was no change in diazepam and allopregnanolone modulation, and pentobarbital stimulation properties were unaffected, suggesting a specific alteration to GABA binding. Also, substituted cysteine accessibility method studies in the GABAA receptor α1 subunit have shown that methylthiosulphonate modification of the Cys derivative of Arg-66 (equivalent to Arg-104) is slowed by the presence of GABA or the competitive antagonist SR-95531, indicating a specific interaction of this residue with ligand (24Boileau A.J. Evers A.R. Davis A.F. Czajkowski C. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4847-4854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Holden J.H. Czajkowski C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18785-18792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Examination of the GABAC-binding site model suggests that Arg-104 is well placed to play a similar role here, because it could help to stabilize the positive charge of GABA. In addition the model suggests that it may have a role in contributing to a network of hydrogen bonds with the stretch of amino acids located immediately behind the binding pocket (Fig. 5A). This might explain the loss of function when Arg was replaced by Lys but not by Glu; manipulation of the model at this position using Swisspdb-viewer indicates that Lys would form fewer hydrogen bonds than either Arg and Glu and thus may subtly disrupt the binding pocket and/or modify the conformational change subsequent to binding. Thus we propose that this residue is critical for the formation and/or stability of the binding site and also contributes directly to GABA binding. Arg-158—The lack of function when Arg-158 was mutated indicates that this residue is essential for receptor structure and/or function. However, because the Arg-158 mutants reached the plasma membrane in HEK293 cells, it suggests the global structure of the receptor is not changed and that this residue has a specific role in the microstructure of the binding site or in receptor binding or function. An Arg is conserved here in all GABAA, GABAC, and glycine receptor subunits, suggesting an important role in all anion selective Cys loop receptors, and there is evidence that this role, at least for GABAA receptors, is in ligand binding. Mutation of this residue in the α5 subunit resulted in an ∼300-fold increase in EC50, but there was no change in diazepam and allopregnanolone modulation, and pentobarbital stimulation properties were unaffected, suggesting a specific alteration of GABA binding (22Wanamaker C.P. Christianson J.C. Green W.N. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 998: 66-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), although cysteine substitution at the equivalent Arg in the α1 subunit yielded receptors with expression that was too low to obtain data (5Sedelnikova A. Smith C.D. Zakharkin S.O. Davis D. Weiss D.S. Chang Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1535-1542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The GABAC receptor model shows that this residue is 2.5Å from the carboxylate of GABA and could stabilize GABA by both charge and hydrogen bond interactions. The model shows no specific interactions with any residue in the binding site (Fig. 5B), which would be energetically unfavorable; thus it is likely that this Arg interacts with water and/or with ligand. Because there is insufficient space in our model for water here when GABA is in the binding pocket, we propose that this residue is specifically involved in GABA binding. Arg-170—The model suggests that Arg-170 could participate in both hydrogen bonds and salt bridges with two other regions of the receptor subunit (Fig. 5C). This hypothesis is not inconsistent with the data, because we observed functional receptors with Lys, which could compensate for both of these bonding requirements, but not Ala or Asp. These data might also suggest that a positive charge is necessary for receptor function at position 170, but such a hypothesis is not supported by the results of Sedelnikova et al. (5Sedelnikova A. Smith C.D. Zakharkin S.O. Davis D. Weiss D.S. Chang Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1535-1542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), in which a cysteine substitution yielded a functional receptor. The EC50 for the R170C mutant was increased ∼10-fold compared with wild type, a shift similar to that we observed for the R170K receptor. Because Cys can form hydrogen bonds, it could compensate to some extent for the loss of Arg. It is not possible to tell from our data whether binding affinity or functional efficacy is being affected, but the study of Sedelnikova et al. (5Sedelnikova A. Smith C.D. Zakharkin S.O. Davis D. Weiss D.S. Chang Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1535-1542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) indicated that this is a ligand-binding residue, because the Cys mutant at this position was protected from modification by both GABA and a competitive GABAC receptor antagonist. Further evidence comes from GABAA receptor work, where the equivalent residue (Arg-131) has been proposed to form part of a crown of arginines (in addition to Arg-207 and Arg-66) that stabilize the GABA carboxylate (16Wagner D.A. Czajkowski C. Jones M.V. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 2733-2741Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Interestingly our model of the GABAC receptor-binding site suggests that Arg-170 may be too far from GABA to interact with it, although it is possible that this region of loop E may be closer to GABA than predicted. Interestingly, the recent cryo-electron microscope images of the nicotinic ACh receptor (26Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 967-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar) show that structural variations exist in the β5-β5′ stretch (located in loop E) between the ligand-bound AChBP and its unbound state, suggesting that movement does occur in this region on agonist binding. More structural data are needed to prove this hypothesis, but the current model and data both indicate an important role of Arg-170 either with adjacent residues that could be important to maintain the structure of the binding region and/or as a residue directly involved in GABA binding. Arg-249—The final arginine investigated was Arg-249. A charged residue is conserved at this position in many members of the Cys loop family and has been shown to be important in 5-HT3 and GABAA receptors (16Wagner D.A. Czajkowski C. Jones M.V. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 2733-2741Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 27Schreiter C. Hovius R. Costioli M. Pick H. Kellenberger S. Schild L. Vogel H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22709-22716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Indeed, Wagner et al. (16Wagner D.A. Czajkowski C. Jones M.V. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 2733-2741Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) proposed that the equivalent Arg-207 in the GABAA receptor makes direct contact with the ligand and is partially responsible for satisfying the negative charge of the carboxylate of GABA. If this was also true for the GABAC receptors, then large increases in EC50 values would be expected upon Arg-249 mutation. Significant differences in EC50 value compared with wild type were recorded for the R249A and R249K mutants, yet these changes were smaller (∼15- and 25-fold increases, respectively) than those observed for the GABAA R207C mutation (∼70-fold increase for R207C (28Wagner D.A. Czajkowski C. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 67-74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) and much smaller for those observed for Arg-158 and Arg-104 mutants, suggesting that this hypothesis is not correct. Without better structural data and/or an understanding of the conformational changes that result in channel opening, it is difficult to explain these apparent differences in relative EC50 values between putative ligand-binding residues, but we might speculate that the very large changes observed when GABAC receptor residues are mutated might be due to it having fewer residues that participate in the binding interaction, and particularly the interaction that stabilizes the positive charge on the GABA molecule. Certainly our data indicate that the GABAC receptor has no preference for a charged residue at position 249, and thus it is clearly not required in the GABAC receptor to satisfy the negative carboxylate of GABA. The model suggests that the primary role of this residue maybe to assist the formation of the correct structure of the binding pocket by hydrogen bonding with Tyr-241 (Fig. 5D), and we currently favor this proposal. Other Residues—Two other Arg residues are within 10 Å of the binding pocket (Arg-144 and Arg-221). Previous studies have shown that mutation of either of these amino acids to cysteine does not change the EC50 of the receptor and that such mutants are not accessible to sulfydryl-specific reagents (5Sedelnikova A. Smith C.D. Zakharkin S.O. Davis D. Weiss D.S. Chang Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1535-1542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus it seems reasonable to assume that these arginines do not interact with ligand. It is also possible that other positively charged residues may contribute to ligand binding. His-141, Lys-143, and Lys-217 have been investigated using the substituted cysteine accessibility method (5Sedelnikova A. Smith C.D. Zakharkin S.O. Davis D. Weiss D.S. Chang Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1535-1542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and these data suggested that they were not protected from modification by GABA and thus were not present in the binding site. Another possibility is His-105, but we observed only small increases in EC50 when this was mutated to Ala or Asp, although the larger Arg did increase EC50 by ∼60-fold, suggesting that size and not charge is the critical factor at this location. This supports the model, and previous studies in GABAA and 5-HT3 receptors, which all predict this region to be β-sheet, with His-105 or its equivalent facing away from the pocket (24Boileau A.J. Evers A.R. Davis A.F. Czajkowski C. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4847-4854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to interaction with positive residues, the carboxylate of GABA may also be stabilized through hydrogen bonds to other polar residues in the binding pocket. If the docking pose showing the carboxylate near to Arg-158 and Arg-104 is accurate, then Ser-168 and Ser-243 are in sufficiently close proximity to interact with the ligand. To investigate this, each of these residues was mutated such that the hydrogen-bonding moiety was either conserved or removed. These data revealed that Ser-243 does not form such a bond through its side chain (replacement with Thr was much less favorable than with Ala), but a hydroxyl group was favored at position 168. Thus a hydrogen bond here may help to stabilize GABA or may contribute to maintaining the structural integrity of the binding pocket. Conclusions—Our data suggest that Arg-158 and Arg-104 are most closely associated with the ligand in the GABAC receptor, with Arg-158 having the most important role. These two positive amino acids could “pincer” the negative carboxylate, satiating its charge. Such an orientation is predicted by studies docking GABA into a model of the ρ1 extracellular domain. In this orientation the cation-π interaction with Tyr-198 is also satisfied, offering further support for this docking pose (Fig. 4). Thus our study has provided experimental evidence for a location of GABA in which potential partners for both the positive and negative groups of GABA are provided and also suggests that binding of GABA to the GABAC receptor may differ subtly from that in the GABAA receptor."

In this study, we identified components of the Hoxd4 P1 promoter directing expression in neurally differentiating retinoic acid-treated P19 cells. We mapped three nucleosomes that are subsequently remodeled into an open chromatin state upon retinoic acid-induced Hoxd4 transcription. These nucleosomes spanned the Hoxd4 transcriptional start site in addition to a GC-rich positive regulatory element located 3′ to the initiation site. We further identified two major cis-acting regulatory elements. An autoregulatory element was shown to recruit HOXD4 and its cofactor PBX1 and to positively regulate Hoxd4 expression in differentiating P19 cells. Conversely, the Polycomb group (PcG) protein Ying-Yang 1 (YY1) binds to an internucleosomal linker and represses Hoxd4 transcription before and during transcriptional activation. Sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation studies revealed that the PcG protein MEL18 was co-recruited with YY1 only in undifferentiated P19 cells, suggesting a role for MEL18 in silencing Hoxd4 transcription in undifferentiated P19 cells.

This study links for the first time local chromatin remodeling events that take place during transcriptional activation with the dynamics of transcription factor association and DNA accessibility at a Hox regulatory region. Hox gene transcriptional activation marks the onset of an intricate series of events leading to proper embryonic patterning in all animals. The products of Hox genes, homeodomain-containing HOX transcription factors, are essential in specifying antero-posterior positional identity, hindbrain development, limb formation, and numerous additional morphogenetic and organogenetic events (1Krumlauf R. Cell. 1994; 78: 191-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar, 2Kmita M. Duboule D. Science. 2003; 301: 331-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Given their crucial role in embryonic development, the genes encoding HOX proteins are highly conserved throughout the animal kingdom, and their expression is tightly regulated (3Manzanares M. Wada H. Itasaki N. Trainor P.A. Krumlauf R. Holland P.W. Nature. 2000; 408: 854-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In mammals, 39 Hox genes are organized into four clusters, each located on a different chromosome (1Krumlauf R. Cell. 1994; 78: 191-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar). Comparison of the clusters reveals 13 possible gene positions, although none of the clusters retains a full complement of 13 genes. Hox genes occupying the same positions are termed paralogs, sharing high sequence identity and functional redundancy. One can assign a 3′ and a 5′ end to a cluster since all genes are transcribed in the same direction. A unique feature of Hox gene clusters is a process termed “colinearity,” correlating both the timing of transcriptional activation and the anterior expression borders with the position of a particular Hox gene along a cluster (4Duboule D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 514-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Therefore, genes located more 3′ are expressed earlier and have a more anterior expression border than genes located more 5′ along the cluster. This observation and several other studies have led to the hypothesis that a sequential opening of chromatin, starting at the 3′ end of a cluster and moving successively 5′, leads to the release of silencing, first at the 3′ end, and sequentially allowing the expression of more 5′ genes with increasing time (5Duboule D. Deschamps J. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 738-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 6Roelen B.A. de Graaff W. Forlani S. Deschamps J. Mech. Dev. 2002; 119: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Numerous studies have now established that it is the strictly defined anterior expression border that most determines HOX activity, and shifting this border either anteriorly or posteriorly leads to embryonic malformations and homeotic transformations (7Rijli F.M. Mark M. Lakkaraju S. Dierich A. Dollé P. Chambon P. Cell. 1993; 75: 1333-1349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). A full understanding of Hox function therefore requires an explication of the mechanisms governing spatiotemporally restricted expression. The regulation of Hox gene transcription is accomplished through a set of enhancers located a few kilobases upstream or downstream of the gene, although some enhancers have been shown to be located hundreds of kilobases away (8Maconochie M. Nonchev S. Morrison A. Krumlauf R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 529-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar).

In vivo mutations of the Hoxa1 and Hoxb1 RAREs result in hindbrain patterning defects and cranial nerve malformations similar to those observed in the Hoxa1 and Hoxb1 full knockouts, emphasizing a key role for retinoids in controlling Hox gene expression during embryogenesis (17Dupé V. Davenne M. Brocard J. Dollé P. Mark M. Dierich A. Chambon P. Rijli F.M. Development (Camb.). 1997; 124: 399-410PubMed Google Scholar). Transgenic studies in mouse embryos where RARE sequences were mutated resulted in posteriorized Hox gene expression in both the somitic mesoderm and the developing hindbrain (24Marshall H. Morrison A. Studer M. Pöpperl H. Krumlauf R. FASEB. J. 1996; 10: 969-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 25Nolte C. Amores A. Nagy Kovacs E. Postlethwait J. Featherstone M. Mech.

Biol. 1993; 13: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), suggests a positive role for RA in activating Hox gene transcription. Hoxd4 is an ortholog of the Drosophila Hox gene Deformed (Dfd). Hoxd4 expression begins at embryonic day 8.25 and has an anterior border of expression between rhombomeres six and seven (r6/7) in the developing hindbrain and between somites four and five in the mesoderm (27Featherstone M.S. Baron A. Gaunt S.J. Mattei M.G. Duboule D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4760-4764Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). A 5′ mesodermal enhancer containing an RARE and an ARE has been described earlier and shown to be functional in P19 cells (26Pöpperl H. Featherstone M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 28Pöpperl H. Featherstone M.S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3673-3680Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). A 3′ neural enhancer containing a DR5 type RARE is crucial for initiation and maintenance of Hoxd4 expression in the central nervous system (22Zhang F. Nagy Kovacs E. Featherstone M.S. Mech. Dev. 2000; 96: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 29Zhang F. Pöpperl H. Morrison A. Kovacs E.N. Prideaux V. Schwarz L. Krumlauf R. Rossant J. Featherstone M.S. Mech.

Two proximal promoters, an upstream promoter (P2) and a downstream promoter (P1), have been identified (31Folberg A. Kovacs E.N. Featherstone M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29151-29157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Transcripts originating from P1 have a more anterior border of expression in the central nervous system (r6/7) and are further anteriorized in response to RA, suggesting that P1 is more responsive to signals originating from the 3′ neural enhancer (31Folberg A. Kovacs E.N. Featherstone M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29151-29157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Similar to Hoxb4 (32Brend T. Gilthorpe J. Summerbell D. Rigby P.W. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 2717-2728Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), interactions between the Hoxd4 3′ neural enhancer and its proximal promoter P1 are important in initiation of Hoxd4 gene expression in the hindbrain of transgenic embryos (25Nolte C. Amores A. Nagy Kovacs E. Postlethwait J. Featherstone M. Mech. Dev. 2003; 120: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and in neurally differentiating P19 embryonal carcinoma cells (33Rastegar M. Kobrossy L. Kovacs E.N. Rambaldi I. Featherstone M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8090-8103Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We have correlated this enhancer-promoter interaction with chromatin changes occurring upon Hoxd4 gene activation in response to RA in neurally differentiating P19 cells and in the central nervous system of developing mouse embryos. Chromatin opening occurred first at the 3′ neural enhancer followed by the intervening sequences, culminating at the proximal promoter P1 (33Rastegar M. Kobrossy L. Kovacs E.N. Rambaldi I. Featherstone M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8090-8103Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These studies also established P19 cells as a valid system for studying Hoxd4 enhancer-promoter function. In this study, we further characterized the Hoxd4 P1 promoter. Because of the importance of enhancer-promoter communication and chromatin modifications that culminate at P1 during neural Hoxd4 gene expression, we investigated the roles of nucleosome position, chromatin remodeling, and cis-regulatory elements involved in initiating Hoxd4 gene expression in neurally differentiating P19 cells. We show that nucleosomes are positioned at P1 and are remodeled in response to RA. Furthermore, we show that an ARE and a YY1 binding site regulate correct Hoxd4 expression in P19 cells in response to RA, as does a GC-rich motif that is essential for core promoter activity. We also show that YY1 continues to exert a repressive effect on Hoxd4 transcription in P19 cells even after gene activation. This repression is correlated with MEL18 recruitment to the YY1 binding site at P1 during Hoxd4 transcriptional silencing. Finally, we discuss our results in the light of the evidence that links chromatin to Hox gene regulation and YY1-mediated repression to PcG-mediated silencing of Hoxd4. Tissue Culture and Transfections—P19 mouse embryonal carcinoma cells were cultured in α-minimum essential medium (α-MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For neural differentiation, P19 cells were plated as low density monolayers at 105 cells/ml α-MEM supplemented with 0.3 μm RA for 48 h. Transient transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). P19 cells were plated either in the presence or in the absence of RA followed by transfection of different constructs in an antibiotic-free α-MEM. Twenty-four hours later, the medium was replaced with α-MEM containing antibiotics, and RA was added to the cells undergoing differentiation. Transfected cells were harvested 24 h later by scraping in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 100 μl of lysis buffer (10% Triton X-100, 1 m K2HPO4, 1 m KH2PO4, 1 m dithiothreitol) for 5 min. Luciferase Vectors and Assays—Luciferase reporter constructs were designed in a pXP2 promoter-less background (34Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-458PubMed Google Scholar) containing the luciferase gene coupled to region CL of the Hoxd4 3′ neural enhancer (pXP2CL, see Fig. 2B, construct 1) (22Zhang F. Nagy Kovacs E. Featherstone M.S. Mech. Dev. 2000; 96: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). pXP2CL was prepared by cloning EcoRV/BamHI-digested CL fragments (in TOPO-II background) into SmaI/BamHI-digested pXP2 followed by sequencing. All Hoxd4 P1 deletion fragments were amplified by PCR using P1-specific primers and Pfx platinum (Invitrogen) as the heat-stable DNA polymerase. pSNlacZpA (29Zhang F. Pöpperl H. Morrison A. Kovacs E.N. Prideaux V. Schwarz L. Krumlauf R. Rossant J. Featherstone M.S. Mech. Dev. 1997; 67: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) was used as a template, and PCR products were subcloned into TOPO-II (Invitrogen) and sequenced. BamHI-XhoI promoter fragments were cloned into BglII/XhoI sequentially digested pXP2CL. For luciferase assays, 30 μl of cell extract was incubated in 100 μl of luciferin solution (10 mm luciferin, 1 m Tris pH 7.8) and 12.5 μl of assay buffer (50 mm ATP, 1 m MgCl2, 1 m Tris pH 7.8). Luciferase activity was measured using a Lumat LB 9507 luminometer (EG&G Berthold). For measuring transfection efficiency, Rous sarcoma virus β-galactosidase plasmid was co-transfected with the luciferase reporter constructs, and β-galactosidase assays were performed as described (33Rastegar M. Kobrossy L. Kovacs E.N. Rambaldi I. Featherstone M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8090-8103Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Final luciferase values were reported as relative luciferase activity per β-galactosidase unit. Site-directed Mutagenesis—For site-directed mutagenesis of the YY1 binding site, primers carrying the mutated sequences (Table 1) were used in two separate PCRs (each containing either the 5′ or the 3′ primer containing the mutation), and the amplified products were gel-purified, combined, and used as a template for another nested PCR. The products of the final PCR were also gel-purified, subcloned into TOPO-II, and sequenced to verify mutations. This was followed by BamHI/XhoI digestion and cloning into pXP2CL. For mutating the ARE sequences, an NruI-BamHI fragment was released from pSXm34/35 already harboring the mutated ARE (28Pöpperl H. Featherstone M.S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3673-3680Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), bluntended, and cloned into construct 1 (see Fig. 2B).TABLE 1Oligonucleotides used in this studyLM-PCR5′-3′Linker oligo LM-PCR 1GCGGTGACCCGGGAGATCTGAATTCLinker oligo LM-PCR 2GAATTCAGATCO-115CTGAATGTCTGCTCTGGGTAGGACCCGAGGO-69AGACAACGTTACAACCTCGGGTCCO-195CCGAGCCTACCTGCACCATCTCTGAAAGCCChIP5′-3′Hoxd4 ARE forwardTACTCTTCTGTGCTGCTGTCHoxd4 ARE reverseTGCTTCTGCTGCTGCTATGHoxd4 P1 YY1 binding site forwardGAACTCATTGCTGTAGCGAGHoxd4 P1 YY1 binding site reverseCAGAGCAGACATTCAGGCgapdh NAD binding domain forwardAACGACCCCTTCATTGACgapdh NAD binding domain reverseTCCACGACATACTCAGCACEMSA5′-3′YY1 consensus senseGGGGATCAGGGTCTCCATTTTGAAGCGGGATCTCCCYY1 consensus antisenseGGGAGATCCCGCTTCAAAATGGAGACCCTGATCCCCHoxd4 P1 YY1 binding site senseCCTACCTGCACCATCTCTGAAAGCCAGGHoxd4 P1 YY1 binding site antisenseCCTGGCTTTCAGAGATGGTGCAGGTAGGOligo A (1-33)ATGGTCGATGCAAAAACTTCATATATCTCCGACOligo B (34-66)ATGGCCAGAGACTGAGGCGCGGAGAGTACTGGCOligo C (1-66)ATGGTCGATGCAAAAACTTCATATATCTCCGACATG GCCAGAGACTGAGGCGCGGAGAGTACTGGCRT-PCR5′-3′Hoxd4 homeobox forwardCTACACCAGACAGCAAGTCCHoxd4 homeobox reverseCTATAAGGTCGTCAGGTCCGSite-directed mutagenesis5′-3′mYY1 forwardACAACGAGAGTAAAGCCAGGCTTGGTGAGTTCmYY1 reverseGCCTGGCTTTACTCTCGTTGTCAGGTAGGCTCGGTG CATTTCTAAsiRNA5′-3′YY1 siRNA senseAAGAUGAUGCUCCAAGAACdTdTYY1 siRNA antisenseGUUCUUGGAGCAUCAUCUUdTdTCtrl siRNA senseCCUCGUCGUAGAACCUCCAdTdTCtrl siRNA antisenseUGGAGGUUCUACGACGAGGdTdT Open table in a new tab Micrococcal Nuclease (MNase) Digestion and Genomic DNA Purification—Nuclei were prepared according to Carey and Smale (35Carey M. Smale S.T. Transcriptional Regulation in Eukaryotes: Concepts, Strategies, and Techniques. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 338-346Google Scholar). Undifferentiated or neurally differentiated P19 cells were resuspended in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer for 5 min, pelleted, and resuspended in MNase digestion buffer. This was followed by adding either 1 units or 5 units of MNase (Roche Applied Science) for 5 min. The reaction was stopped, and samples were treated with 25 μg/μl proteinase K (Roche Applied Science) overnight at 37 °C. For naked DNA controls, MNase digestion was carried out following DNA purification of chromatin extracted from P19 cells. Following phenol/chloroform extraction, samples were treated with 10 μg/μl RNase A for 2 h followed by another round of phenol/chloroform extraction. Finally, DNA was ethanol-precipitated and resuspended in 100 μl of H2O. One μg of DNA was used for ligation-mediated PCR (LM-PCR, see below). Restriction Enzyme Accessibility—Following nuclei purification, samples were resuspended in restriction enzyme digestion buffer (35Carey M. Smale S.T. Transcriptional Regulation in Eukaryotes: Concepts, Strategies, and Techniques. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 338-346Google Scholar) followed by incubation with different concentrations of KpnI and PvuII (New England Biolabs) for either 10 min or 20 min at 37 °C. This was followed by proteinase K digestion and DNA purification. After determining the DNA concentration, 1 μg of DNA was used for in vitro EcoRI (New England Biolabs) digestion. Twenty-five percent of the digestion reaction was used for LM-PCR. LM-PCR—LM-PCR was performed as described previously (36Garrity P.A. Wold B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1021-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), with some modifications. Following DNA purification, digested DNA was ligated to a double-stranded unidirectional linker, which provided a common 5′ sequence for annealing to a PCR primer. This was followed by PCR amplification using a 3′ gene-specific primer and a 5′ primer complementary to the unidirectional linker (Table 1). Finally, a second nested PCR was performed using a radioactively labeled 3′ gene-specific primer, allowing us to detect specific MNase cleavage products by autoradiography. Because the PCR templates consist of DNA fragments linked to a 25-bp linker, the actual size of the gene-specific product is 25 bp less than the size detected on the gel. All PCR reactions were carried out with the heat-stable DNA polymerase Pfu (Fermentas). First-strand synthesis reactions were performed for restriction enzyme-treated DNA but not for MNase-treated DNA. Instead, MNase-treated DNA was phosphorylated using polynucleotide kinase (Fermentas) followed directly by ligation with the unidirectional linker (Table 1). The amplification PCR consisted of 18 (restriction enzyme) or 23 (MNase) PCR cycles with an extension time starting at 5 min plus 15 s for each additional cycle. The labeling PCR consisted of three cycles for all the in vivo DNA treatments. Gene-specific primers complementary to Hoxd4 P1 were used, and their exact positions are given in Table 1. Real-time PCR using gapdh-specific oligonucleotides was performed to ensure equal loading. ChIP Assays and Real-time PCR—ChIP experiments were performed as described (33Rastegar M. Kobrossy L. Kovacs E.N. Rambaldi I. Featherstone M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8090-8103Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides used for real-time PCR are listed in Table 1. For sequential ChIP, a second immunoprecipitation procedure was performed using chromatin samples consisting of antibody-protein-DNA complexes that were eluted from the agarose beads of the first ChIP. Five μg of purified antibodies was used for each ChIP experiment. Anti-PBX1, -MEL18, and -YY1 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The anti-HOXD4 rabbit polyclonal antibody was described previously (33Rastegar M. Kobrossy L. Kovacs E.N. Rambaldi I. Featherstone M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8090-8103Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Electromobility Shift Assays (EMSAs) and Supershifts—Nuclear extracts and EMSAs were performed as described (37Houle M. Prinos P. Iulianella A. Bouchard N. Lohnes D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6579-6586Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Five μg of polyclonal antibody was added to the binding reaction in supershift experiments. The primers used are listed in Table 1. Anti-Sp1 and anti-Sp3 antibodies were kind gifts of Dr. Christopher Mueller (Queen's University). Whole Cell Extracts, Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extracts, and Immunoblotting—Whole cell extracts from P19 cells and immunoblotting were performed as described (33Rastegar M. Kobrossy L. Kovacs E.N. Rambaldi I. Featherstone M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8090-8103Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were also prepared as described (38Haller K. Rambaldi I. Daniels E. Featherstone M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49384-49394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). RNA Extraction and RT-PCR—RNA extraction and RT-PCR were performed as described (33Rastegar M. Kobrossy L. Kovacs E.N. Rambaldi I. Featherstone M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8090-8103Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For PCR, primers specific for the Hoxd4 homeobox (located in the second coding exon) were used to assay for Hoxd4-specific transcripts, in addition to gapdh-specific primers (spanning the coding region) that were used as a control (Table 1). RNA Interference—For silencing yy1 gene expression, siRNA oligonucleotides based on yy1 cDNA sequences were used as described previously (39Kurisaki K. Kurisaki A. Valcourt U. Terentiev A.A. Pardali K. Ten Dijke P. Heldin C.H. Ericsson J. Moustakas A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4494-4510Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) (accession number NM_009537). The YY1 siRNA sequence is identical in the human, mouse, and Xenopus cDNAs. Control siRNA oligonucleotides were designed as purine to pyrimidine (and vice versa) mutations of the YY1 siRNA primers (Table 1). For YY1 knockdown in undifferentiated P19 cells, both control and YY1 siRNA primers having BglII- and HindIII-compatible ends were annealed and cloned into BglII/HindIII-digested pSUPER (OligoEngine, Seattle, WA), creating pSUPER-CTRL and pSUPER-YY1, respectively. Plasmids were transfected into undifferentiated P19 cells using Lipofectamine 2000, and knockdown was achieved 24 h later. For P19 cells differentiated with RA, the same cDNA sequences were used for designing the siRNA primers, this time delivered to the cells as ready-to-use 2′-deprotected double-stranded siRNA duplex. The pSUPER-retro system was not used in these experiments because P19 cells had to be pretreated with RA before transfection, optimal timing of YY1 knockdown did not coincide with initiation of Hoxd4 transcription, and therefore, the effects of YY1 depletion on Hoxd4 gene expression could not be monitored. Instead, P19 cells were treated with RA for 24 h followed by transient transfection with YY1 siRNA oligonucleotides (see Fig. 6, YY1 siRNA) or control oligonucleotides (see Fig. 6, Ctrl siRNA). The cells were subjected to total protein and RNA extraction 24 h later. Both primer sets were purchased from Dharmacon Research Inc. and transfected in P19 cells at a concentration of 200 nm using Lipofectamine 2000. Cells were harvested 48 h later. Nucleosome Positioning and Remodeling at the Hoxd4 P1 Promoter—In our previous study, we showed that Hoxd4 transcription is initiated from the correct start sites within 48 h following RA treatment of P19 cells (33Rastegar M. Kobrossy L. Kovacs E.N. Rambaldi I. Featherstone M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8090-8103Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). RA responsiveness was dependent on the Hoxd4 3′ neural enhancer, which contains an RARE. Moreover, modifications characteristic of transcriptionally active chromatin (histone H3 acetylation and methylation) were correlated with transcriptional activation, starting at the 3′ end of the gene and concluding more 5′ at P1. This conversion was accompanied by recruitment of RNA polymerase II to the Hoxd4 locus, a process that did not occur in the absence of RA and not before those chromatin modifications took place. These results suggested that the Hoxd4 P1 promoter is not a nucleosome-free region and raised the question of whether nucleosome positioning plays an active role in mediating the repression and/or activation of Hoxd4 transcription. To investigate nucleosome positioning at P1, we performed high resolution nucleosome mapping using MNase digestion coupled with LM-PCR analysis (40Weinmann A.S. Plevy S.E. Smale S.T. Immunity. 1999; 11: 665-675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). A unique property of MNase is its ability to create double-stranded nicks in internucleosomal regions of partially digested chromatin. To compare nucleosome positions before and after Hoxd4 transcriptional activation, we used nuclei extracted from P19 cells either untreated or treated with RA for 48 h and thus coinciding with initiation of Hoxd4 transcription. Two sets of nested primers were designed to confirm nucleosome positions at P1, one set amplifying in the 3′ direction relative to Hoxd4 transcription and the other amplifying in the 5′ direction (Fig. 1A). Both primers were located upstream of the transcriptional start site (+1) at positions –115 (O-115) and –69 (O-69). Primer positions were chosen based on results from low resolution MNase-coupled Southern blotting experiments that gave a rough estimation of nucleosome positions (data not shown). Two major cleavage products could be detected using radiolabeled O-115 and nuclei from untreated cells but not the naked DNA control (Fig. 1B, left panel). These sites thus define an internucleosomal region spanning nucleotides –25 to –10, respectively. This ind"

However, it was found that recombinant PDCD5 added exogenously to culture medium could also enhance programmed cell death triggered by certain stimuli. Here we show that PDCD5 has a remarkable role in intercellular transport in various cells (endogenous caveolin-1-positive and -negative cells) through a clathrin-independent endocytic pathway that originates from heparan sulfate proteoglycan binding and lipid rafts. These conclusions are supported by the studies of slow internalization kinetics of PDCD5 endosomes, by the resistance of endosomes to nonionic detergents, by the overexpression of the clathrin dominant negative mutant form, which did not block PDCD5-fluorescein isothiocyanate uptake, and by PDCD5 localization in lipid rafts by immunofluorescence, electron microscopy techniques, and sucrose density centrifugation. This is further supported by the findings that certain drugs that disrupt lipid rafts, compete with cell membrane heparan sulfate proteoglycans, or block the caveolae pathway, impair the PDCD5 internalization process. The translocation activity of PDCD5 may possess physiological significance and be a potential mechanism for its programmed cell death-promoting activity. PDCD5 protein also has the ability to drive the internalization of large protein cargo, depending on the residues 109-115 mapped by deletion mutagenesis, and can introduce the Mdm-2 binding domain of human p53 into living cells to induce cell death in human cancer cells, indicating that PDCD5 may serve as a vehicle and thus have potential in the field of protein delivery to the cells.

This is the first evidence of such findings. The plasma membrane, consisting of a lipid bilayer into which proteins and glycoproteins are inserted, is generally impervious to proteins. Some larger proteins termed translocatory proteins, however, can enter the cell by endocytosis into endocytic vesicles through as yet unknown exact mechanisms. The mounting interest in the cell-penetrating capacity of these translocatory proteins is due to their ability to drive the internalization of large protein cargoes that are chemically coupled or fused to them.

Deletion analyses of the first two proteins, Tat and Drosophila Antennapedia, have mapped the apparent intercellular transfer function to the short runs of highly basic residues, termed protein transduction domains (PTDs), or cell-permeable peptides. Early mechanistic studies showed that Tat-mediated transduction occurs through a rapid, temperature- and energy-independent process, suggesting direct penetration across the lipid bilayer. Because of the strong cell surface binding characteristics of the Tat PTD, measurements of protein internalization by flow cytometry or after fixation led to the above incorrect early assumptions regarding cellular uptake. Many studies have shown that Tat and Tat fusion proteins are rapidly internalized by lipid raft-dependent endocytosis or macropinocytosis after a cell surface interaction of Tat with cell membrane heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) (7Rusnati M.

PDCD5 (programmed cell death 5), formerly designated as TFAR19 (TF-1 cell apoptosis-related gene 19), is cloned as a gene whose expression is increased during the apoptotic process of TF-1 cells induced by cytokine withdrawal using a cDNA-RDA method (cDNA representational differences analysis) (15Liu H.T.

Previous studies have shown that PDCD5, when transiently or stably overexpressed in TF-1, MGC-803, and HeLa cells, facilitates programmed cell death triggered by certain stimuli, such as growth factor withdrawal or serum withdrawal from culture medium (15Liu H.T.

Chen Y.Y. Zhang Y.M. Ma D.L. Life Sci. 2002; 71: 1771-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Recently, the decreased expression of PDCD5 has been reported in various human tumors, such as breast cancer (20Hedenfalk I. Duggan D. Chen Y. Radmacher M. Bittner M. Simon R. Meltzer P. Gusterson B.

These observations suggest that PDCD5 plays a significant role in both apoptotic and nonapoptotic programmed cell death and may participate in the pathophysiologic course of diseases involving abnormal programmed cell death. We have found that exogenously added human recombinant PDCD5 to culture medium of TF-1 cells or HL-60 cells can also enhance programmed cell death triggered by growth factor deprivation in TF-1 cells 3Y. Zhang and D. Ma, unpublished observations. or serum deprivation in HL-60 cells (25Zhang Y.M. Xu X.Z. Liu H.T. Song Q.S. Ma D.L. J. Chinese Immunol. 2000; 16: 8-11Google Scholar). An interesting question that remains to be addressed is how the exogenous PDCD5 enters the cells and promotes programmed cell death. Here we show that human recombinant PDCD5 protein makes use of clathrin-independent endocytosis to enter the cells. PDCD5 also has the ability to drive the internalization of large protein cargo EGFP that is fused to it. Furthermore, we have mapped a specific region of PDCD5 is necessary to drive translocation via mutagenesis assays. To determine whether the interaction of PDCD5 with the cell surface leads to the PDCD5 internalization, we tried to deliver a biologically functional peptide through PDCD5 into the cells. Others have found that the biologically functional peptide from the Mdm-2 binding domain of human p53, residues 17-26 (ETFSDLWKLL), fused to penetratin of the antennapedia to enable transport across the cell membrane, resulting in human cancer cell death (26Kussie P.H.

Our study shows that PDCD5 can also introduce human p53 peptide into cells and induce their death. Compared with transferrin internalized by the clathrin pathway and Tat involved in lipid rafts/caveolae endocytosis (11Fittipaldi A. Ferrari A. Zoppe M. Arcangeli C. Pellegrini V. Beltram F. Giacca M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34141-34149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), human PDCD5 protein is a molecule similar to Tat. Therefore, it may be useful for exploiting PDCD5 as a vehicle for transcellular delivery of various molecules. The translocation activity of PDCD5 also suggests that human PDCD5 may promote programmed cell death via a novel mechanism that involves its reentry into the cells. Antibodies and Fluorescent Markers—Antibodies against clathrin heavy chain, transferrin receptor and caveolin-1 were from Transduction Laboratories (BD Biosciences). Anti-HSP70 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-histone H3 was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). IRDye 800- or IRDye 700-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody and IRDye 800-conjugated anti-GFP antibody were obtained from Rockland. Secondary TRITC-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody, TRITC- and FITC-labeled transferrin, and Alexa Fluor 594-labeled cholera toxin subunit B and anti-EGFP antibody were all from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Protease inhibitor mixture tablets were obtained from Roche Applied Science. Hoechst 33342 was from Sigma. pDsRed-Hub Plasmid Construction—The cDNA encoding Homo sapiens clathrin heavy chain residues 1073-1675 (28Liu S.H. Marks M.S. Brodsky F.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1023-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), clathrin hub fragment, was cloned into the BamHI and XhoI sites of the pDsRed-C3 vector (Clontech) to generate pDsRed-Hub for transfection. The plasmid was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cell Cultures and Transfection—HEK293 and U937 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen), and HT-29 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and l-glutamine (2 mm). 4 × 106 HEK293 cells in 400 μl were transiently transfected by electroporation with 10 μg of the expression plasmid at 120 V for 20 ms, using an electric pulse generator (Electro Square Porator ECM 830, BTX, San Diego, CA). Cells were generally assayed 36-48 h after transfection. Recombinant PDCD5 Protein—Recombinant PDCD5 protein was purified as described previously (15Liu H.T. Wang Y. Zhang Y.M. Song Q.S. Di C.H. Chen G. Tang J. Ma D.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 29Wang L. Fan H. Mo X.N. Zhang Y.M. Wei Z.R. Zhong Y.C. Huang D.W. J. Peking Univ. (Health Sci.). 2003; 35: 360-363Google Scholar). Briefly, Escherichia coli pop2136 harboring the prokaryotic expression vector pMTY4-PDCD5 was heated to induce the expression of the MS2-PDCD5 fusion protein. After denaturing, renaturing, and cleavage with thrombin, PDCD5 was purified by ion exchange chromatography with DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) and by gel filtration over Sephacyl S-200 HR (Amersham Biosciences). Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) labeling of recombinant PDCD5 protein was prepared as described previously (30Masseyeff R.F. Albert W.H. Staines N.A. Methods Immunol. Anal. 1993; 3: 237-238Google Scholar). Subcloning and Deletion Mutagenesis—PDCD5 sequence was cloned into the EcoRI site of pEGFP-C3 vector (Clontech), and then EGFP and EGFP-PDCD5 sequence were cloned into the NotI site of pGEX-4T-2 vector (Amersham Biosciences) to generate pGEX-EGFP and pGEX-EGFP-PDCD5, respectively. To facilitate expression vector construction, a NotI recognition site was introduced at both ends of the open reading frame by PCR with primers. The C-terminal deletion mutants of PDCD5 (amino acids 1-115 and 1-108, respectively) were constructed using PCR amplification of the relevant portions of PDCD5 cDNA, followed by restriction digestion and subsequent subcloning into pGEX-4T-2 vector to generate pGEX-EGFP-PDCD5Δ116-125 and pGEX-EGFP-PDCD5Δ109-125, respectively. PDCD5 deletion constructs are designated PDCD5Δx-y, where x and y indicate the first and last deleted PDCD5 residue according to the complete human PDCD5 sequence (15Liu H.T. Wang Y. Zhang Y.M. Song Q.S. Di C.H. Chen G. Tang J. Ma D.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). All constructs were sequenced using an ABI 3100 DNA sequencer. The pGEX plasmids containing the required clone were transformed into the E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) to express the corresponding GST fusion proteins. GST fusion proteins were respectively bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (Amersham Biosciences). After on-column thrombin cleavage, the EGFP, EGFP-PDCD5, EGFP-PDCD5Δ116-125, and EGFP-PDCD5Δ109-125 proteins were released from GST, because the GST moiety remains bound to the Sepharose resin while the desired protein is eluted with PBS buffer. p53N Peptide and p53N-PDCD5 Expression—The peptide ETFSDLWKLL from the Mdm-2 binding domain of p53, denoted as p53N, was synthesized by solid phase synthesis and purified by HPLC to 95% purity in GL Biochem (Shanghai) Ltd. The oligonucleotides encoding the residues 17-26 (ETFS-DLWKLL) from the amino-terminal of p53 Mdm-2-binding domain of p53 were synthesized and subcloned into the pGEX-4T to express the p53N peptide fused to the N terminus of PDCD5 (i.e. p53N-PDCD5 protein). The p53N-PDCD5 protein was expressed in BL21 (DE3) and purified with glutathi-one-Sepharose 4B resin (Amersham Biosciences). FITC labeling of recombinant p53N-PDCD5 protein was prepared as previously described previously (30Masseyeff R.F. Albert W.H. Staines N.A. Methods Immunol. Anal. 1993; 3: 237-238Google Scholar). Protein Subcellular Fractionation Analysis—5 × 106 HEK293 cells or U937 cells were incubated with recombinant EGFP-PDCD5 for 5 h and washed in PBS, and cells were fractionated into cytosol, membranes, nuclei, and cytoskeleton using the Qproteome cell compartment kit from Qiagen according to the manufacturer's instructions, and then one-fifth of each fraction was subjected to Western blotting. The fractions were analyzed to detect EGFP-PDCD5 protein and HSP70 and histone 3 proteins as the controls for cross-contamination during the cell fractionation procedure were sequentially reprobed with corresponding antibodies, respectively, on the same membrane. Isolation of Triton X-100-insoluble Membranes—Isolation of Triton X-100-insoluble membranes was performed essentially as described previously (31Hinrichs J.W. Klappe K. Hummel I. Kok J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5734-5738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 32Rakheja D. Narayan S.B. Pastor J.V. Bennett M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 317: 988-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), with some modifications. 5 × 106 HEK293 cells or 1 × 107 U937 cells were incubated with recombinant EGFP-PDCD5 for 5 h, washed, and left in 1 ml of ice-cold 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in MNE buffer (25 mm MES (pH 6.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) and incubated on ice for 20 min. The cell suspension was then homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer at 20 strokes. The homogenate was then adjusted to 40% sucrose by the addition of 1 ml of 80% (w/v) sucrose in MNE buffer and loaded onto the bottom of a 5-ml ultracentrifuge tube. On top of this, 2 ml of 30% (w/v) sucrose in MNE buffer was overlaid, and then 1 ml of 5% (w/v) sucrose in MNE was overlaid. After centrifugation for 18 h at 100,000-150,000 × g in a Beckman MLS50 swing-out rotor, 10 0.5-ml fractions were collected from the top of the gradient. To concentrate the raft fraction, each fraction was diluted 10-fold with ice-cold MNE and centrifuged in a Beckman MLS50 swing-out rotor at 150,000 × g for 2 h at 4°C. The pellets were solubilized in sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to Western blotting. The same membrane was reprobed with corresponding antibodies, respectively. Western Blotting—Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond™ and ECL™; Amersham Biosciences). After blocking in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBS-T) and 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature, membranes were incubated with IRDye 800-conjugated anti-GFP antibody or with corresponding primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were then washed with TBS-T three times for 10 min and directly detected or incubated with corresponding IRDye 800 or IRDye 700-labeled IgG secondary antibody in the dark for 1 h at room temperature. Following another three washes with TBS-T for 10 min, the membranes were scanned in the appropriate channels (800 nm for IRDye800 antibody, 700 nm for IRDye700 antibody) of the LI-COR Infrared Imaging System (Odyssey, Lincoln, NE) and analyzed with Odyssey software. Drug Treatments—Cells were pretreated with the different drugs, 0.1-100 μg/ml heparin, 1.25-10 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD), 5 μm cytochalasin D, 20 μm nocodazole, 10-250 μm genistein, genistin, or 100 nm to 2.5 μm staurosporine, respectively, for 30 min in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, after which time recombinant protein in fresh medium containing the same inhibitor was added. Cells were then processed after treatment with inhibitor and recombinant protein for fluorescence microscopy or flow cytometry. All these drugs were from Sigma. Treatment with Triton X-100—Cells were incubated with recombinant PDCD5-FITC together with transferrin-TRITC for 5 h, washed, and left in ice-cold 1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 min before fixation with 2% paraformaldehyde. Fluorescence Microscopy—For different fluorescent protein treatments, HEK293 cells were grown in specialized glass-bottom microwell dishes (MatTek Corp.) to about 50% confluence, and then fresh, 10% fetal bovine serum medium containing different fluorescent molecules was added. Final concentrations of fluorescent molecules were 1 μm recombinant PDCD5-FITC, p53N-PDCD5-FITC, Alexa Fluor 594-labeled cholera toxin B and/or transferrin-TRITC, or 1 μm protein of EGFP, EGFP-PDCD5, EGFP-PDCD5Δ116-125, or EGFP-PDCD5Δ109-125. After 5 h of treatment with recombinant proteins, cells were rinsed twice with PBS buffer and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. For immunostaining, fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, washed and blocked with PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 30 min at room temperature, and incubated with a 1:200 dilution of primary antibodies in PBS supplemented with 2% BSA. Cells were rinsed three times with PBS and incubated with a 1:100 dilution of secondary antibodies for 30 min in 2% BSA in PBS. Cells were rinsed three times, all fluid was removed, and samples were mounted with 90% glycerin (Sigma) in PBS. For live cell recording, cells plated on 35-cm glass bottom dishes (MatTek Corp.) were placed in a humidified Plexiglas chamber and maintained at 37 °C throughout the experiment. For the fast dynamics recording and co-localization experiments, cells were imaged using a TCS-SP laser-scanning confocal microscope with a ×40 or ×63 oil immersion lens (Leica Microsystems, Mannheim, Germany). Electron Microscopy—To study the internalization of PDCD5 coupled to gold particles (PDCD5-gold), a pre-embedding procedure was performed. Briefly, according to the Colloidal Gold Conjugation Protocol (Schleicher & Schuell), PDCD5 gold labeling was done at pH 6.2 (for PDCD5, the pI is pH 5.9 (29Wang L. Fan H. Mo X.N. Zhang Y.M. Wei Z.R. Zhong Y.C. Huang D.W. J. Peking Univ. (Health Sci.). 2003; 35: 360-363Google Scholar)). HEK293 or HT-29 cells cultured on 12-well cell culture plates for 20 h were washed once with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 25 mmol/liter HEPES containing 0.1% BSA at 8 °C and then incubated for 1 h with PDCD5-gold (9 nm, 3.6 μg/ml) at 8 °C and shifted to 37 °C for 1 h to induce the internalization. After several washes, cells were scraped, pelleted for 5 min at 3000 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge, and fixed with 3% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 2 h at 4°C. Fixed cells were prepared for electron microscopy as previously described (33Tran D. Carpentier J.L. Sawano F. Gorden P. Orci L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7957-7961Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Thin sections were cut, mounted on grids, and viewed in a JEM-1230 transmission electron microscope (JEOL, Japan) after contrasting with uranyl acetate. Flow Cytometry—Quantification of internalized FITC-labeled PDCD5 recombinant protein was performed. Briefly, cells were plated in 24-well plates to about 70% confluence and incubated with 5 μg/ml recombinant PDCD5-FITC for the times indicated in Fig. 1, or cells were pretreated with the different concentrations of heparin (0.1-100 μg/ml) or the different concentrations of MβCD (1.25-10 mm) for 30 min and then incubated with 5 μg/ml PDCD5-FITC or p53N-PDCD5-FITC recombinant protein in fresh medium containing the same inhibitor. Cells were then washed, trypsinized, centrifuged, again washed twice with PBS, and finally analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Programmed Cell Death Induction and Detection of Phosphatidylserine Externalization—HT-29 cells were seeded into each well of 24-well tissue culture dishes containing 1 ml of culture medium. Cells were allowed to adhere for 24 h when the medium was replaced with media containing a 0.75-3 μm concentration of the recombinant p53N-PDCD5 protein, recombinant PDCD5 protein, or p53N peptide to be tested. Another set of wells (controls) in each experiment was processed identically but with peptide and protein-free media. Cells were fed every 24 h with 0.3 ml of their respective peptide- or protein-containing media. The cultures were examined daily for changes in cell growth and morphology. Cells were released and collected after 2 days of treatment. 1 × 105 washed cells were resuspended in 200 μl of binding buffer (PBS containing 1 mm calcium chloride). To detect phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization, FITC-conjugated annexin V (0.5 μg/ml final concentration) was added to the suspended cells according to the manufacturer's instructions (Biosea, China). After incubation for 20 min at room temperature, 400 μl of binding buffer was added again, and samples were immediately analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) with excitation using a 488-nm argon ion laser. Caspase-3-like Activity Assay—Briefly, after treatment with a 3 μm concentration of the recombinant p53N-PDCD5 protein, recombinant PDCD5 protein, or p53N peptide for 2 days, incubation medium was removed, and the cells were lysed for 10 min in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, 130 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Cell lysates containing 15 μg of protein were incubated at 37 °C in buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% CHAPS, and 10 mm dithiothreitol with the fluorogenic substrate Ac-DEVD-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (ALEXIS Biochemicals Industriestrasse). Fluorescence was measured with the use of a FLUOStar fluorometer (BMG Labtechnologies) equipped with an excitation filter of 380 nm and emission filter of 460 nm. Results were calculated as a proportion of the control over 90 min (T90/T0). Samples were prepared in triplicate. Kinetics of PDCD5 Internalization—The kinetics of cellular internalization of PDCD5-FITC in HEK293 cells and U937 cells is shown comparatively in Fig. 1. The PDCD5-FITC protein or FITC with the equal absorbance to PDCD5-FITC at 495 nm was added to the cell culture medium of human HEK293 or U937 cells, and cellular fluorescence was quantitatively assessed at different time points by flow cytometry. Analysis of the flow cytometry profiles and of the mean cellular fluorescence values shown in Fig. 1, A-D, clearly indicates that the PDCD5-FITC protein internalization kinetics in different cell types is similar. However, internalization of PDCD5-FITC was blocked at 4 °C in both cell types (Fig. 1G), suggesting that the internalization is an energy-dependent process. A microscopic analysis of cells treated with PDCD5-FITC protein indicated that fluorescence was localized to discrete compartments in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1E) with a very few labeled proteins reaching the nuclei (Fig. 1F), suggesting internalization by an endocytic process in this cas"
https://openalex.org/W2084649705,"A large cytoplasmic domain accounts for approximately one-third of the entire protein of one superfamily of ligand-gated membrane ion channels, which includes nicotinic acetylcholine (nACh), γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA), serotonin type 3 (5-HT3), and glycine receptors. Desensitization is one functional feature shared by these receptors. Because most molecular studies of receptor desensitization have focused on the agonist binding and channel pore domains, relatively little is known about the role of the large cytoplasmic domain (LCD) in this process. To address this issue, we sequentially deleted segments of the LCD of the 5-HT3A receptor and examined the function of the mutant receptors. Deletion of a small segment that contains three amino acid residues (425–427) significantly slowed the desensitization kinetics of the 5-HT3A receptor. Both deletion and point mutation of arginine 427 altered desensitization kinetics in a manner similar to that of the (425–427) deletion without significantly changing the apparent agonist affinity. The extent of receptor desensitization was positively correlated with the polarity of the amino acid residue at 427: the desensitization accelerates with increasing polarity. Whereas the R427L mutation produced the slowest desensitization, it did not significantly alter single channel conductance of 5-HT3A receptor. Thus, the arginine 427 residue in the LCD contributes to 5-HT3A receptor desensitization, possibly through forming an electrostatic interaction with its neighboring residues. Because the polarity of the amino acid residue at 427 is highly conserved, such a desensitization mechanism may occur in other members of the Cys-loop family of ligand-gated ion channels. A large cytoplasmic domain accounts for approximately one-third of the entire protein of one superfamily of ligand-gated membrane ion channels, which includes nicotinic acetylcholine (nACh), γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA), serotonin type 3 (5-HT3), and glycine receptors. Desensitization is one functional feature shared by these receptors. Because most molecular studies of receptor desensitization have focused on the agonist binding and channel pore domains, relatively little is known about the role of the large cytoplasmic domain (LCD) in this process. To address this issue, we sequentially deleted segments of the LCD of the 5-HT3A receptor and examined the function of the mutant receptors. Deletion of a small segment that contains three amino acid residues (425–427) significantly slowed the desensitization kinetics of the 5-HT3A receptor. Both deletion and point mutation of arginine 427 altered desensitization kinetics in a manner similar to that of the (425–427) deletion without significantly changing the apparent agonist affinity. The extent of receptor desensitization was positively correlated with the polarity of the amino acid residue at 427: the desensitization accelerates with increasing polarity. Whereas the R427L mutation produced the slowest desensitization, it did not significantly alter single channel conductance of 5-HT3A receptor. Thus, the arginine 427 residue in the LCD contributes to 5-HT3A receptor desensitization, possibly through forming an electrostatic interaction with its neighboring residues. Because the polarity of the amino acid residue at 427 is highly conserved, such a desensitization mechanism may occur in other members of the Cys-loop family of ligand-gated ion channels. The Cys-loop pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (LGIC) 2The abbreviations used are: LGIC, ligand-gated ion channel; 5-HT, serotonin; ACh, acetylcholine; W T, wild type; LY, LY 278,584, LCD, large cytoplasmic domain; ANOVA, analysis of variance; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; pS, picosiemens. superfamily includes nicotinic acetylcholine (nACh), γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA), glycine, and serotonin type 3 (5-HT3) receptors (1Maricq A.V. Peterson A.S. Brake A.J. Myers R.M. Julius D. Science. 1991; 254: 432-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). These receptors play crucial roles in fast synaptic transmission through agonist-induced opening of transmembrane ion channels in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Topologically, these receptors consist of a large extracellular N-terminal domain, a large cytoplasmic domain (LCD), and four transmembrane domains (1Maricq A.V. Peterson A.S. Brake A.J. Myers R.M. Julius D. Science. 1991; 254: 432-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). The 5-HT3 receptor can modulate the release of neurotransmitters such as glutamate, GABA, and dopamine (DA), and plays a role in the reward mechanisms of drug addiction (2Grant K.A. Drug Alcohol Depend. 1995; 38: 155-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 3van Hooft J.A. Vijverberg H.P. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 605-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Of all five 5-HT3 subunits identified by molecular cloning, the 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B subunits have been the most thoroughly characterized (4Reeves D.C. Lummis S.C. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2002; 19: 11-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Although the 5-HT3B subunit can form a functional heteromer when co-expressed with the 5-HT3A subunit (5Davies P.A. Pistis M. Hanna M.C. Peters J.A. Lambert J.J. Hales T.G. Kirkness E.F. Nature. 1999; 397: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), the 5-HT3A subunit is capable of forming a functional channel (1Maricq A.V. Peterson A.S. Brake A.J. Myers R.M. Julius D. Science. 1991; 254: 432-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar), and such a homomer is thought to be the dominant functional form in the central nervous system (6Morales M. Wang S.D. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6732-6741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One common feature shared by members of the LGIC superfamily is that these receptors desensitize at synaptic sites when exposure to agonist is prolonged. Desensitization plays a critical role in the regulation of neuronal excitability and the efficacy of synaptic transmission (7Jones M.V. Westbrook G.L. Neuron. 1995; 15: 181-191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 8Jones M.V. Westbrook G.L. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 96-101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Several inherited mutations occurring in ACh receptors have been shown to alter receptor desensitization kinetics (9Wang H.L. Milone M. Ohno K. Shen X.M. Tsujino A. Batocchi A.P. Tonali P. Brengman J. Engel A.G. Sine S.M. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 226-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 10Brownlow S. Webster R. Croxen R. Brydson M. Neville B. Lin J.P. Vincent A. Newsom-Davis J. Beeson D. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These mutations increase or decrease the synaptic response to ACh and result in slow or fast channel syndromes, which is thought to contribute to pathological mechanisms of certain types of neurological diseases (9Wang H.L. Milone M. Ohno K. Shen X.M. Tsujino A. Batocchi A.P. Tonali P. Brengman J. Engel A.G. Sine S.M. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 226-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 10Brownlow S. Webster R.

Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 998: 138-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Like other members of the LGIC superfamily, 5-HT3 receptors desensitize in the continued presence of agonist (12Yakel J.L. Jackson M.B. Neuron. 1988; 1: 615-621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Mechanisms underlying receptor desensitization have been the focus of much research and discussions for the last several decades (7Jones M.V. Westbrook G.L. Neuron. 1995; 15: 181-191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 8Jones M.V. Westbrook G.L. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 96-101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Despite extensive investigation, the molecular mechanisms of receptor desensitization are not totally understood. There are many factors that contribute to this physiological process. Desensitization kinetics may be affected by external calcium concentration (13Lobitz N. Gisselmann G. Hatt H. Wetzel C.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 844-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), posttranslational modification of the receptor protein (14Swope S.L. Moss S.J. Raymond L.A. Huganir R.L. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1999; 33: 49-78Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and subunit composition (15Hapfelmeier G. Tredt C. Haseneder R. Zieglgansberger W. Eisensamer B. Rupprecht R. Rammes G. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 1720-1733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Both the large extracellular N-terminal domain and transmembrane domains of LGICs have been found to be important in regulation of receptor desensitization (16Corringer P.J. Le Novere N. Changeux J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 431-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Whereas recent studies have revealed the important involvement of the LCD of 5-HT3A receptor in regulation of channel conductance and Ca2+ permeability (17Peters J.A. Hales T.G. Lambert J.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2005; 26: 587-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), little is known about the structural and functional role of the LCD in receptor desensitization. To address this question, we sequentially deleted segments of the LCD in the 5-HT3A receptor and expressed the mutant receptors in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells. The desensitization kinetics of these receptors was measured using a fast perfusion system. We identified a single arginine residue at 427 that is critical for 5-HT3A receptor desensitization kinetics. Deletion or point mutation of this residue substantially slowed receptor desensitization without significantly affecting agonist binding affinity. The magnitude of receptor desensitization is correlated with the polarity of the residue at 427. These findings suggest that the residue at 427 regulates 5-HT3A receptor desensitization by a hydrogen-bonding or ionic interaction with its neighboring amino acid residues. This structural element could play an important role in the conformational transition required for the desensitization of the 5-HT3A receptor as well as other members of the Cys-loop LGIC superfamily. Deletional Mutation and Site-directed Mutagenesis—Deletions and point mutations of the long isoform of the mouse 5-HT3A receptor were introduced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The authenticity of the DNA fragments that flank the mutation site was confirmed by double-strand DNA sequencing using an ABI Prism 377 Automatic DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Preparation of cRNAs and Expression of Receptors—Complementary RNAs (cRNAs) were synthesized in vitro from linearized template cDNAs with a mMACHINE RNA transcription kit (Ambion). The quality and the sizes of synthesized cRNAs were confirmed by denatured RNA-agarose gels. Mature female Xenopus laevis frogs were anesthetized by submersion in 0.2% 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester (Sigma), and a group of oocytes was surgically excised. The oocytes were separated and the follicular cell layer was removed by treatment with type I collagenase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 2 h at room temperature. Each oocyte was injected with a total of 20 ng of RNA in 20 nl of diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water and was incubated at 19 °C in modified Barth's solution (MBS: 88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 2.0 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Recording from Xenopus Oocytes—After incubation for 2–5 days, the oocytes were studied at room temperature (20–22 °C) in a 90-μl chamber. The oocytes were superfused with MBS at a rate of 6 ml/min. Agonists and chemical agents were diluted in the bathing solution and applied to the oocytes for a specified time, using a solenoid valve controlled superfusion system. Membrane currents were recorded by two-electrode voltage clamp at a holding potential of −70 mV, using a Gene Clamp 500 amplifier (Axon Instruments, Inc.). The recording microelectrodes were filled with 3 m KCl and had electrical resistances of 0.5–3.0 MΩ. Data were routinely recorded on a chart recorder (Gould 2300S). Average values are expressed as mean ± S.E. Western Blot of Membrane Surface Receptor Proteins—Xenopus oocytes expressing 5-HT3A receptors were incubated with N-hydroxysuccinimide-SS-biotin (NHS-SS-biotin, Pierce) at a concentration of 1.5 mg/ml in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C under a nonpermeabilized condition, as described previously (18Sun H. Hu X.Q. Moradel E.M. Weight F.F. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34150-34157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The oocytes were then washed extensively and homogenized. The homogenate was centrifuged repeatedly at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C until all yolk granules and melanosomes were pelleted. The final supernatant was incubated with 100 μl of NeutrAvidin-linked beads (Pierce) by end-over-end rotation for 2 h at 4°C. The beads were centrifuged and washed extensively to isolate bead-bound proteins. Labeled proteins were eluted from the beads and loaded onto 10% SDS/PAGE. After transfer onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Invitrogen), the surface proteins were blocked with PBS (pH 7.5) containing 0.1% Tween-20 (Sigma) and 5% nonfat powdered milk and then incubated for 1 h with a polyclonal antibody (pAb120, 1:20,000) directed to the extracellular N-terminal domain of the 5-HT3A receptor (19Spier A.D. Wotherspoon G. Nayak S.V. Nichols R.A. Priestley J.V. Lummis S.C. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 67: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The proteins were washed, blotted with a 1:600 dilution of fluorescein-linked anti-rabbit IgG in PBS and incubated with anti-fluorescein AP conjugate (Pierce) at 1:2500 dilution in PBS for 1 h. The proteins detected by ECF substrate (Amersham Biosciences) were scanned using a Molecular Dynamics Storm Gel and Blot Imaging System with ImageQuant Image Analysis Software (Amersham Biosciences). Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 cells obtained from the American Type Culture Collection were cultured in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 95% air. Cells were plated at a density of 106 cells/ml in 35-mm dishes and allowed to grow to 70–95% confluence prior to transient transfection using calcium phosphate or Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). The cDNA plasmid ratio for 5-HT3A subunits and green fluorescent protein (Invitrogen) was 3:1 (total amount of DNA: 4 μg). Receptor Binding—HEK293 cells were incubated at 22 ± 1 °C for 60 min in various concentrations (10 nm) of [3H]LY278,584 (specific activity = 64 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences), a selective antagonist of 5-HT3 receptor. The nonspecific binding was less than 5% of the total binding, as determined by incubation in 100 nm unlabeled LY278,584. The specific binding was determined by subtracting the nonspecific binding from the total binding. Each sample is the average from at least 3–4 separate experiments. Reactions were incubated for 1 h at 25 °C and were terminated by rapid vacuum filtration using a Brandel cell harvester onto GF/B filters followed by two rapid washes with 20 ml of ice-cold PBS buffer. Radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Data were analyzed by nonlinear sigmoidal dose-response curve fitting (PRISM). Whole Cell Recording and Fast Solution Perfusion—Whole cell recordings were performed in HEK293 cells 1–3 days after transfection. HEK293 cells were re-plated on the day of the experiment. Cells were continuously superfused with a solution containing 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH, ∼340 mOsm with sucrose). Membrane currents were recorded in the whole cell configuration using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instrument) at 20–22 °C. Cells were held at −60 mV. Data were acquired using pClamp 9.0 software (Axon). Solutions were applied through two barrel theta glass tubing (TGC150, Warner Instrument) that had been pulled to a tip diameter of ∼200 μm. The piezoelectric device was driven by TTL pulses from the pClamp 9.0 software (Axon). Voltage applied to the piezo device produced a rapid lateral displacement (∼50 μm) of the theta tubing to move the interface between control and test solutions. Solution exchange rate for open pipette and whole cell recording was estimated using the potential change induced by switching from the control solution to a 140 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG) test solution at 0 mV in the absence of agonist; and the current rising phase was fit using an exponential function. The solution exchange time constants were ∼0.3 ms for an open pipette tip and ∼1.6 ms for whole cell recording. Noise Analysis—Single channel conductances were determined using nonstationary variance analysis (20Brown A.M. Hope A.G. Lambert J.J. Peters J.A. J. Physiol. 1998; 507: 653-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Whole cell patch-clamp recording was performed at room temperature using an Axopatch 1D or 200B (Axon Instruments) amplifier. Patch-pipettes had tip resistances of 1–7 mΩ following fire polishing. Cells were voltage-clamped at −60 mV and were bathed in an extracellular medium containing (in mm): NaCl, 150; KCl, 5; CaCl2, 0.2; HEPES, 10; glucose, 10; pH was adjusted to 7.4 using NaOH and osmolality to 340 mmol/kg using sucrose. Data were acquired at 5–10 kHz in 1s blocks on a computer using a DigiData interface and pClamp software (Axon Instruments). Records of current activated by 1 μm 5-HT were filtered (2 kHz 8-pole Bessel) and the DC component digitally subtracted. Variance of the AC component was determined and the background variance subtracted as described previously (20Brown A.M. Hope A.G. Lambert J.J. Peters J.A. J. Physiol. 1998; 507: 653-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and plotted against background-corrected mean current amplitude from the DC component. Unitary current was determined either from the slope of a least-squares linear fit to the data or from a fit of the data to the equation σ2 = iI-I2/N, where σ2 is the current variance, i is the single channel current amplitude, I is the whole cell current amplitude, and N is the number of functional channels. Values for unitary current (in pA) were divided by the holding potential (in V) to yield single channel conductance (in pS). Data Analysis—Statistical analysis of concentration-response data were performed with the use of the nonlinear curve-fitting program ALLFIT. Data were fitted using the logistic Equation 1,Y={(Emax-Emin)/[1+(X/EC50)n]}+Emin(Eq. 1) where X and Y are concentration and response, respectively; Emax and Emin are the maximal and minimal responses, respectively; EC50 is the half-maximal concentration; and n is the slope factor (apparent Hill coefficient). Data were statistically compared by the paired Student's t test, or analysis of variance (ANOVA), as noted. Average values are expressed as mean ± S.E. A Cytoplasmic Segment (423–427) Is Critical for Channel Gating—To understand the structural and functional role of the LCD in the 5-HT3A receptor (Fig. 1A), we sequentially deleted short regions of the LCD using the PCR technique (Fig. 1A). The LCD was first divided into 8 microdomains, each of which contains 5–25 amino acid residues (Fig. 1B). The cRNAs for the wild-type (WT) and mutant receptors were injected into Xenopus oocytes to determine the functional expression of these receptors. Most of these mutant receptors were functional when exposed to 100 μm 5-HT (Fig. 1B), except for Del(423–427), which resulted in a loss of function when expressed in both Xenopus oocytes and HEK293 cells. The amino acid sequence of this segment, Arg-Glu-Val-Ala-Arg, is highly conserved in the 5-HT3A receptors across different species (Fig. 1C). To determine whether or not Del(423–427) can affect the translational machinery and trafficking of the 5-HT3A receptor protein, we directly measured 5-HT3A receptor surface expression in oocytes by labeling cell surface proteins with sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin. A representative Western blot in Fig. 1D illustrates that the protein expression levels in the cell surface membrane did not differ between the WT and Del(423–427) mutant 5-HT3A receptors. To test whether the Del(423–427) mutant receptor retained 5-HT binding activity, we conducted ligand binding experiments in HEK293 cells transfected with the cDNAs for the WT and Del(423–427) 5-HT3A receptors. Fig. 1E illustrates the curves for displacement of specific binding of 10 nm [3H]LY 278,584, a selective antagonist of 5-HT3 receptors, by various concentrations of 5-HT in membranes isolated from cells transfected with the WT (open circles) and Del(423–427) mutant (solid circles) receptors. The values of Kd and the Hill coefficient were 0.25 ± 0.07 μm and 1.8 ± 0.1, respectively, for WT 5-HT3A receptors and 0.18 ± 0.03 μm and 1.6 ± 0.1 for the mutant receptors, respectively; these values are not significantly different (unpaired Student's t test, p > 0.1, n = 12). Deletion of Single Amino Acid Residue at 427 Slows Receptor Desensitization—The above observations suggest that deletion of the entire segment (423–427) in the LCD of the 5-HT3A receptor can disrupt channel gating. To more carefully probe the structural and functional roles of individual amino acid residues within the segment (423–427), we sequentially deleted these residues one at each time. All of the point-mutated receptors were functional when expressed in both HEK293 cells and Xenopus oocytes. The maximal amplitude of 5-HT-activated current in cells expressing the mutant receptors did not significantly differ from that of the WT receptors (data not shown). In transfected HEK293 cell, deletion of Val425 or Ala426 significantly shifted in parallel the 5-HT concentration-response curves to the left of the WT receptor (Fig. 2A; p < 0.01, ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer test, n = 5), whereas deletion of Arg423, Glu424, or Arg427 did not significantly alter the 5-HT EC50s (Fig. 2A; p > 0.2, ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer test, n = 5–7). Next, we examined gating kinetics of the mutant receptors using fast perfusion. In HEK293 cells expressing WT 5-HT3A receptors, the average desensitization time constants of currents activated by 3, 30, and 1000 μm 5-HT were 6.1 ± 0.18 s, 3.8 ± 0.4 s, and 1.3 ± 0.02 s. These time constants are in agreement with results of previous studies (21Gunthorpe M.J. Peters J.A. Gill C.H. Lambert J.J. Lummis S.C. J. Physiol. 2000; 522: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 22Mott D.D. Erreger K. Banke T.G. Traynelis S.F. J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 46583-46589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Deletion of Arg427 (Δ427) produced a marked slowing of desensitization and deactivation of the 5-HT3A receptors (Fig. 2, B and C, p < 0.001, ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer test, n = 11). In contrast, deletion of the other amino acid residues individually within the segment (423–427) accelerated the receptor desensitization and deactivation (Fig. 2, B and C, p < 0.01, ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer test, n = 5). All single amino acid deletions listed in Fig. 2 did not affect 5-HT3A receptor activation time constant (data not shown). To understand if Arg427 is a functionally dominant residue within the region (423–427), we deleted all three residues of 425–427 in one receptor. This deletion markedly slowed desensitization and deactivation of the 5-HT-activated current in a manner similar to that of the Arg427 deletion (Fig. 3, A–D). In contrast, deletion of an adjacent segment (412–422), which contains 10 amino acid residues, did not significantly affect the gating kinetics of the 5-HT3A receptor (Fig. 3, A–D; unpaired Student's t test, p = 0.21, n = 5).FIGURE 3Effects on receptor desensitization and deactivation by deletions of (412–421) and (423–427).

To investigate the molecular basis of this regulation by Arg427, we substituted the arginine at 427 with a series of amino acid residues and examined the desensitization kinetics of the mutant receptors. In general, replacing Arg427 with hydrophobic amino acid residues such as leucine (L) or alanine (A) substantially slowed the desensitization time constant of the 5-HT3A receptor, whereas replacing the Arg427 with polarized or hydrophilic residues such as lysine (K) or asparagine (N) accelerated receptor desensitization (Fig. 4, A and B). Next, we conducted linear regression analysis to compare the time constants of the desensitization kinetics with the biochemical and biophysical properties of the residue 427 including hydrophobicity (24Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17296) Google Scholar), polarity (25Grantham R. Science. 1974; 185: 862-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar), isoelectric point (pI) (from Lasergene, DNASTAR) and volume (26Harpaz Y. Gerstein M. Chothia C. Structure. 1994; 2: 641-649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Among these variables, the time constants for receptor desensitization were significantly linearly related to polarity and hydropathicity of the residue at 427 (Fig. 5, A and B, p < 0.001, linear regression analysis, n = 10). There was no significant relation between the desensitization time constants and the molecular volume and pI of the residue at 427 (Fig. 5, C and D, p = 0.42, linear regression analysis, n = 10). No such correlation was observed between the polarity of the residue 427 and the EC50 values for 5-HT (data not shown).FIGURE 5Correlation analysis of the desensitization kinetics with properties of the amino acid residue at 427.

C, correlation of isoelectric point (pI) of the amino acid residue at 427 with desensitization kinetics.

Note that strong correlation was observed between the polarity and hydrophobicity of the residue at 427 with receptor desensitization.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Effects of Point Mutations of Arg427 on the Single Channel Conductance of 5-HT3A Receptor—A previous study showed that point mutations of three arginine residues in the LCD of the human homomeric 5-HT3A receptors increased single channel conductance (27Kelley S.P. Dunlop J.I. Kirkness E.F. Lambert J.J. Peters J.A. Nature. 2003; 424: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). One of the arginine residues (Arg440) reported in this study is equivalent to the residue 427 of the mouse counterpart. In view of this, we conducted noise analysis experiments to examine the unitary conductance of the R427L mutant receptor, which exhibited the slowest desensitization kinetics. To get the largest possible conductance, we used a Mg2+-free extracellular solution and with a relatively low concentration of Ca2+ (0.2 mm), because both divalent cations were found to reduce single channel conductance (20Brown A.M. Hope A.G. Lambert J.J. Peters J.A. J. Physiol. 1998; 507: 653-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The unitary conductance of the 5-HT3A receptor channels under these conditions was 1.3 ± 0.17 pS (n = 5) for the WT receptor (Fig. 6A), which agrees well with previous results obtained under similar conditions (20Brown A.M. Hope A.G. Lambert J.J. Peters J.A. J. Physiol. 1998; 507: 653-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In cells expressing the R427L mutant receptors, the unitary conductance was 1.1 ± 0.15 pS (Fig. 6B). These values are not significantly different (p = 0.44, One-way ANOVA, n = 5–8). Note that the molecular volume of the alanine (A) residue that was used to place Arg427 residue (Arg440 of the human clone) is smaller than that of both leucine and arginine at 427. In this regard, we examined the unitary conductance of the R427G mutant and observed that the R427G mutation increased single channel conductance from 1.3 ± 0.2 to 2.3 ± 0.2 pS (Fig. 6C, p < 0.002, one-way ANOVA, n = 5). In a separate study, we examined the current-voltage relationships of the WT and R427A mutant receptors with a voltage ramp from −80 to +60 mV at the peak of current activated by 3 μm 5-HT (Fig. 7A). The current evoked by 5-HT reversed at 1.1 ± 0.1 mV in the WT receptors and 1.3 ± 0.2 mV in the mutant receptors; these values are not significantly different (p > 0.5, unpaired Student's t test, n = 5). To further explore if the polarity of the Arg427 residue is conserved among the members of the Cys-loop LGIC superfamily, we aligned the amino acid sequence of the fragment that flanks Arg427 with equivalent sites in 13 other human receptors that belong to the LGIC superfamily (Fig. 7B). The residue corresponding to Arg247 in each receptor is highlighted in bold and italic. As can be seen, the polarity of Arg427 is indeed conserved across all of these subunits. In the studies reported here, we have shown that deletion or point mutations of a single amino acid residue at position 427 of the 5-HT3A receptor slowed apparent desensitization without changing receptor activation kinetics. Such modulation appeared to be specific for the amino acid residue at 427, because deletions of the adjacent amino acid residues of the 5-HT3A receptor did not produce a similar effect on the desensitization kinetics. In addition, point mutations of Arg427 did not affect other channel properties such as single channel conductance and ion selectivity, indicating that a site at 427 in the large cytoplasmic loop of the 5-HT3A receptor is specific for regulation of desensitization kinetics. Deletion of the segment 423–427 in the LCD of the 5-HT3A receptor resulted in a loss of channel function, as revealed by electrophysiological recordings. This was likely caused by occlusion of channel gating rather than agonist binding, because both receptor protein expression at the cell membrane surface and receptor binding were unaffected by the 423–427 deletion. These findings suggest that this segment, which contains five highly conserved amino acid residues, is a structural element critical for channel opening. This notion is consistent with a previous prediction that a cytoplasmic domain containing arginine 423 and 427 residues of the 5-HT3A receptor participates in the formation of the intracellular portal of the channel pore (27Kelley S.P. Dunlop J.I. Kirkness E.F. Lambert J.J. Peters J.A. Nature. 2003; 424: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The desensitized state of a receptor is proposed to have a higher affinity for agonist than that of the non-desensitized closed state (28Katz B. Thesleff S. J. Physiol. 1957; 138: 63-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). Accordingly, increases in desensitization rate can increase apparent agonist affinity (7Jones M.V. Westbrook G.L. Neuron. 1995; 15: 181-191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 8Jones M.V. Westbrook G.L. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 96-101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). In the present study, mutations at position Arg427 that decreased the rate of desensitization in the 5-HT3A receptor produced little or no change in the receptor sensitivity to agonist as assessed by 5-HT EC50 values. The 5-HT EC50 values of the WT and mutant receptors are not correlated with the extent of receptor desensitization. Thus, although increases in desensitization rate can increase apparent affinity, the present results are consistent with the view that desensitization has little influence on peak EC50 value in the WT receptor. One of the possible mechanisms that may explain the kinetic changes by point mutations at Arg427 is that this mutation may increase the probability of the channel of being open, which could slow the time constant of desensitization. Unfortunately, investigation of this mechanism at the single channel level is not possible because of the low conductance of the homomeric channel (5Davies P.A. Pistis M. Hanna M.C. Peters J.A. Lambert J.J. Hales T.G. Kirkness E.F. Nature. 1999; 397: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). The slowing deactivation induced by the mutations of Arg427 could be caused by the receptor's stay in the open state being prolonged, because the open channel has been shown to lock the agonist from unbinding (29Chang Y. Weiss D.S. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). It should be noted that we cannot rule out the possibility that the measurement of macroscopic receptor deactivation is, in fact, contaminated with receptor desensitization. Our observation that measures of amino acid polarity were related to receptor desensitization may indicate that a hydrogen bonding-like interaction involving Arg427 may occur, which is involved in receptor conformational transitions conferring fast desensitization kinetics. On the other hand, increasing the hydrophobicity of the residue at 427 slowed this rate. The fast gating kinetics of the receptor implies that the free energy barrier required to switch between the closed and open states of the channel is relative low. Increasing the strength of a hydrophobic interaction at this position may be sufficient to tip the balance and bias the channel toward opening. It should be also pointed out that residues located in both sides of the membrane may collectively influence receptor gating kinetics (23Hu X.Q. Zhang L. Stewart R.R. Weight F.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46583-46589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), so that the overall ion channel gating kinetics likely reflects the coordinated influence of multiple sites throughout the protein. Recent studies have shown that several key arginine residues including Arg423 and Arg427 within the LCDs of 5-HT3A and α4β2 nACh receptors may serve as a common determinant of single channel conductance (17Peters J.A. Hales T.G. Lambert J.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2005; 26: 587-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 27Kelley S.P. Dunlop J.I. Kirkness E.F. Lambert J.J. Peters J.A.

Chem. 2006; 281: 8062-8071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Substitution of the arginine residues at 423 and 427 with aspartic acid (D) and alanine (A) residues resulted in increasing single channel conductance (17Peters J.A. Hales T.G. Lambert J.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2005; 26: 587-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 27Kelley S.P. Dunlop J.I. Kirkness E.F. Lambert J.J. Peters J.A.

Chem. 2006; 281: 8062-8071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These observations bring us a question on the structural and functional role of the very same amino acid residue at 427 in both receptor desensitization and single channel conductance events. Our observations reported in this study suggest that the molecular processes of receptor desensitization and channel conductance involving Arg427 should be mediated by distinct molecular processes. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed that the R427L mutation significantly slowed desensitization kinetics without altering single channel conductance. In contrast, the R427G mutation slowed receptor desensitization and increased single channel conductance. This suggests that molecular basis involving Arg427 that modulates single channel conductance and desensitization kinetics may depend on the specific biochemical nature of the residue at 427. For instance, the extent of receptor desensitization is strongly correlated with the polarity of the residue at 427, whereas the single channel conductance is likely to be dependent on the molecular volume of the residue at 427: with reducing or increasing the molecular volume of the 427 residue, the single channel conductance varies. If this is the case, one should not expect any appreciable change in single channel conductance by a leucine (L) substitution of an arginine at 427 of the WT receptor, as the molecular volume of both residues is nearly identical. Moreover, we also observed that the receptor desensitization kinetics was not affected by deletion of Arg423, which has been shown to be a critical site for single channel conductance (17Peters J.A. Hales T.G. Lambert J.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2005; 26: 587-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This also suggests that channel properties such as single channel conductance and desensitization should differ in their molecular basis. It is interesting to note that the Arg427, which links transmembrane domains with intracellular vestibule, is in an ideal position to transduce protein conformational changes required for receptor desensitization in the presence of agonists. Consistent with this hypothesis, a recent study using 5-HT3A receptor with an insertion of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) into the receptor LCD has revealed conformation changes cross the transmembrane domains to the intracellular side of the 5-HT3A receptor (31Ilegems E. Pick H. Deluz C. Kellenberger S. Vogel H. Chembiochem. 2005; 6: 2180-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Because the changes of EGFP fluorescence intensity after agonist application were stable for several minutes, it is likely that such transitions represent dynamic conformational changes of 5-HT3A receptor protein from an agonist-bound open state to a desensitized state. In summary, the study reported here provides evidence that an arginine residue at 427 of the 5-HT3A receptor is critical for receptor desensitization through an interaction with neighboring amino acid residues. Because the members of Cys-loop LGIC superfamily are highly conserved in their amino acid sequences, our observations provide a new avenue for future studies to look for desensitization mechanisms of the 5-HT3A receptor as well as other members of the LGIC superfamily.

Mutations in the RPE65 gene are associated with inherited retinal dystrophies with unknown mechanisms. Here we show that two point mutations of RPE65, R91W and Y368H, identified in patients with retinal dystrophies both abolished the isomerohydrolase activity of RPE65 after a subretinal injection into the Rpe65−/− mice and in the in vitro isomerohydrolase activity assay, independent of their protein levels. Further, the R91W and Y368H mutants showed significantly decreased protein levels but unchanged mRNA levels when compared with the wild-type RPE65 (wtRPE65). Protein stability analysis showed that wtRPE65 is a fairly stable protein, with an apparent half-life longer than 10 h, when expressed in 293A cells. Under the same conditions, mutants R91W and Y368H both showed substantially decreased protein stabilities, with half-lives less than 2 and 6 h, respectively. Subcellular fractionation and Western blot analysis demonstrated that wtRPE65 predominantly exists in the membrane fraction, while both of the mutants are primarily distributed in the cytosolic fraction, suggesting that these mutations disrupt the membrane association of RPE65. However, palmitoylation assay showed that wtRPE65 and both of the mutants were palmitoylated. These results suggest that these mutations may result in critical structural alterations of RPE65 protein, disrupt its membrane association, and consequently impair its isomerohydrolase activity, leading to retinal degeneration.

As Rpe65−/− mice lack 11-cis retinal and overaccumulate all-trans retinyl esters, it is commonly believed that RPE65 plays an important role in the generation of 11-cis retinal in the visual cycle, possibly at the step of isomerization of all-trans retinyl ester to 11-cis retinol. Recently, we and other groups have provided direct evidence indicating that RPE65 is the isomerohydrolase, an enzyme catalyzing the isomerization and hydrolysis of all-trans retinyl ester to 11-cis retinol in the visual cycle (35Moiseyev G.

Although multiple mutations in the RPE65 gene have been identified in patients with inherited retinal dystrophies, the molecular pathogenesis for the retinal degeneration associated with the RPE65 missense mutations has not been elucidated. Here, we investigated the impacts of two missense point mutations, R91W and Y368H, common in patients with retinal dystrophies (12Lorenz B. Gyurus P. Preising M. Bremser D. Gu S. Andrassi M. Gerth C.

Construction of RPE65 Expression Vector and Site-directed Mutagenesis—The full-length human RPE65 cDNA was subcloned into the pBluescript SK(+) vector. Mutations R91W and Y368H were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) following the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. The sequences of the mutants were confirmed from both directions using ABI-3730 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and subcloned into a transfer vector, pShuttle-CMV (Stratagene). The pShuttle-CMV vectors carrying wtRPE65 and its mutants, R91W and Y368H, were linearized with PmeI, and transformed into BJ5183-AD1 (Stratagene) to generate recombinant adenovirus DNA. The recombinant adenovirus DNA was linearized with PacI and transfected into QBI-293A cells (Qbiogene, Carlsbad, CA) for adenovirus packaging using FuGENE6 (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) as recommended by the manufacturer. The recombinant adenoviruses were verified by PCR followed by DNA sequencing from both directions. Furthermore, the gene expression from adenovirus vectors was confirmed by Western blot analysis using an anti-RPE65 antibody (38Ma J.X. Zhang J. Othersen K.L. Moiseyev G. Ablonczy Z. Redmond T.M. Chen Y. Crouch R.K. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 1429-1435PubMed Google Scholar). Generated adenoviruses were amplified and titered using the plaque-forming assay (plaques-forming unit per ml, PFU/ml) by VectorBioLabs (Philadelphia, PA). Co-expression of LRAT with wtRPE65 or Its Mutants in QBI-293A Cells—QBI-293A cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented 5% fetal bovine serum in 15-cm dishes until 65–75% confluent. The human LRAT cDNA in the pcDNA6 vector was transfected into the QBI-293A cells. Twenty-four hours following the transfection, the cells were infected separately with Ad-wtRPE65, Ad-R91W, and Ad-Y368H at multiplicity of infection (MOI, the ratio of virus pfu to cell number) of 20 or MOI of 250 and cultured for another 24 h. The cells were harvested and stored in the −80 °C freezer until they were used. Isomerohydrolase Activity Assay—QBI-293A cells co-expressing LRAT and wtRPE65, or R91W or Y368H were lysed in a buffer containing 10 mm BTP (Bis-Tris propane, pH 8.0). Uninfected QBI-293A cells were used as a negative control. Cell lysates were sonicated on ice for 20 s in a reaction buffer (10 mm BTP, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl) and the total cell lysate was used for activity assays. All-trans [11,12-3H]retinol in ethanol (1 mCi/ml, 52 Ci/mmol, Perkin Elmer, Boston, MA) was dried under argon and resuspended in the same volume of dimethyl formamide (DMF). For each reaction, 2 μl of the non-diluted all-trans [11,12-3H]retinol in DMF and 250 μg of total cell lysate were added into 200 μl of the reaction buffer containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 25 μm CRALBP (cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein). After a 2-h incubation in the dark at 37 °C, retinoids generated were extracted by the addition of 300 μl of cold methanol and 300 μl of hexane. The upper organic phase was collected and analyzed by normal phase HPLC as described (39Moiseyev G. Crouch R.K. Goletz P. Oatis Jr., J. Redmond T.M. Ma J.X. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2229-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The peak of each retinoid isomer was identified based on retinoid standards. The isomerohydrolase activity was calculated from the area of 11-cis retinol peak using Radiomatic 610TR software (PerkinElmer) with synthetic 11-cis [3H]retinol as a standard. For the mouse eyecups, the assay was performed using 250 μg of eyecup homogenate. Quantitative Real-time RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from cells using RNeasy (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and treated with RNase free DNase-I (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) to remove viral DNA contaminations before reverse transcription. Each PCR included a negative control which omitted reverse transcriptase to exclude possible amplification from viral DNA contaminations. The primers for real-time PCR span large introns in the RPE65 gene to avoid amplification from possible genomic DNA contaminations. Quantitative PCR reactions were performed with iQ SYBR Green supermix (Bio-Rad) following manufacturer's protocol, and the signals were detected using MyiQ single color real-time detection system (Bio-Rad). The data were analyzed with the MyiQ data analyzing software (Bio-Rad) and Microsoft Excel. The PCR products were visualized with 2% of agarose gel electrophoresis to ensure that the PCR reactions amplified only single products of 173 bp. Subretinal Injection of Adenovirus Carrying wtRPE65, R91W, and Y368H into Rpe65−/− Mice—Subretinal injection was performed in Rpe65−/− mice at 2 weeks of age. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with a 50:50 mix of ketamine (100 mg/ml) and xylazine (20 mg/ml), and the pupils were dilated with topical phenylephrine (2.5%) and tropicamide (1%). A sclerotomy was made ∼0.5-mm posterior to the limbus with a blade; a glass injector connected to a syringe filled with 3 μl of virus was introduced through the sclerotomy area into the vitreous cavity. The tip of the injector was introduced into the subretinal space through a peripheral retinotomy, and the virus was slowly injected. A gray bubble demonstrated that the virus was delivered into the expected site and retina was detached from the RPE. Subcellular Fractionation of Cultured Cells—The 293A cells expressing RPE65 or its mutants were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, separated into cytosolic, membrane, nuclear, and cytoskeletal fractions using FractPrep™ (BioVision, Mountain View, CA) following the manufacturer's protocol. The same amount of proteins (8 μg) on each fraction was resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot analysis using a purified RPE65 antibody (38Ma J.X. Zhang J. Othersen K.L. Moiseyev G. Ablonczy Z. Redmond T.M. Chen Y. Crouch R.K. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 1429-1435PubMed Google Scholar) to confirm their subcellular localization. Protein Stability Assays—To determine the half-lives of wtRPE65 and its mutants, QBI-293A cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum until 65–75% confluent and then infected with the virus at MOI of 10. The recombinant RPE65 and its mutants were allowed to express for 18 h. The protein synthesis was then stopped by addition of 25 μg/ml of cycloheximide (CHX; Sigma). The cells were harvested at 0, 2, 6, and 10 h following the addition of CHX. The expression levels of the proteins were confirmed by Western blot analysis and semiquantified with densitometry. Apparent half-lives were averaged from four independent experiments and expressed as mean ± S.D. Palmitoylation Assay—QBI-293A cells were separately infected by Ad-wtRPE65 (MOI = 100), Ad-R91W (MOI = 400), and Ad-Y368H (MOI = 400). The infected cells were incubated for 2 h, followed by the addition of 6 mCi of [9,10-3H]palmitic acid (American Radiolabeled Chemical, Inc., St. Louis, MO), and incubated for another 16 h. The cells were harvested by cell scraper, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and then lysed by sonication. Expressed wtRPE65 and its mutants were purified by immunoprecipitation. Briefly, same amounts of total cell lysates (1.3 mg) were dissolved by phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.3% CHAPS and 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 1.5 h on ice. Solubilized fraction by CHAPS was separated by centrifugation, and gently mixed with cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) conjugated with the antibody for human RPE65 in cold room overnight. The Sepharose was washed five times by phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.3% CHAPS and proteinase inhibitors described above. The final elution was performed by addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Purified wtRPE65 and its mutants were separated in the 8% SDS-PAGE gel. The gel was treated with Amplify™ reagent (Amersham Biosciences) according to manufacturer's protocol and dried using gel dryer. The dried gel was exposed to Kodak Biomax MS (Kodak, Rochester, NY) in an autoradiography cassette −80 °C for 8 days, and the film was then developed. Gene Delivery of Ad-R91W or Ad-Y368H Fails to Restore Isomerohydrolase Activity in Rpe65−/− Mice—Ad-wtRPE65, Ad-R91W, and Ad-Y368H were separately injected into the subretinal space of Rpe65−/− mice at 2 weeks of age. Two weeks following the injection, mice were sacrificed, and their eyecups were dissected and homogenized individually as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The eyecups of untreated wt mice (sv129) at the same age (4 weeks after birth) were prepared as the positive control. The same amount of total eyecup protein (250 μg) from each mouse was used for in vitro isomerohydrolase activity assay. Incubation of all-trans [3H]retinol with eyecup proteins from sv129 mice generated a peak of 11-cis [3H]retinol (Fig. 1A), whereas the same amount of eyecup protein from Rpe65−/− mice did not generate any 11-cis retinol (Fig. 1B), consistent with previous studies (7Redmond T.M. Yu S. Lee E. Bok D. Hamasaki D. Chen N. Goletz P. Ma J.X. Crouch R.K. Pfeifer K. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 344-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). Eyecup homogenates from Rpe65−/− mice injected with Ad-wtRPE65 converted a significant amount of all-trans [3H]retinol to 11-cis [3H]retinol (Fig. 1C), demonstrating that Ad-wtRPE65 injection restored isomerohydrolase activity in Rpe65−/− mice. Under the same conditions, however, mice injected with Ad-R91W (Fig. 1D) or Ad-Y368H (Fig. 1E) did not exhibit any detectable isomerohydrolase activities. Mutations R91W and Y368H Decrease the Protein Level but Not the mRNA Level of RPE65—To study the impact of the point mutations, R91W and Y368H, on RPE65 expression, we have infected QBI-293A cells with the same titer of Ad-wtRPE65, Ad-R91W, or Ad-Y368H. Twenty-four hours following the infection, the cells were harvested and homogenized. The same amount of total cellular protein was blotted with the anti-RPE65 antibody. The result showed that both of the RPE65 mutants had substantially lower protein abundance than that of wtRPE65 in the infected cells (Fig. 2A). To elucidate the mechanism responsible for the decreased protein levels of the R91W and Y368H mutants, we compared their mRNA levels. QBI-293A cells, which were separately infected by the same titer (MOI = 20) of Ad-wtRPE65, Ad-R91W, and Ad-Y368H were harvested 18 h following the adenoviral infections. The mRNA levels were measured using quantitative real-time RT-PCR. After normalization by mRNA levels of a housekeeping gene, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, there was no significant difference in the mRNA levels between wtRPE65, R91W, and Y368H (p > 0.1, n = 3) (Fig. 2B). The amplified PCR product showed a single band with the expected size (173 bp) only from the infected cells as shown by the agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2C). The PCR product was not amplified from contamination of viral DNA, as the negative control RT-PCR without reverse transcriptase did not generate any detectable PCR product (Fig. 2B), demonstrating specificity of the RT-PCR. Mutations R91W and Y368H Decrease RPE65 Protein Stability—To determine if the mutations affect the protein stability, QBI-293A cells were separately infected with Ad-wtRPE65, Ad-R91W, and Ad-Y368H at MOI of 10. The protein expression was allowed for 18 h and then blocked by the addition of 25 μg/ml CHX. The cells were harvested at 0, 2, 6, and 10 h after the addition of CHX, and the protein levels of wtRPE65 and its mutants were measured by Western blot analysis and semiquantified using densitometry. WtRPE65 showed a high stability, with a half-life more than 10 h in 293A cells (Fig. 3). In contrast, the R91W and Y368H mutants exhibited significantly accelerated degradation under the same conditions, with apparent half-lives less than 2 and 6 h, respectively (Fig. 3), suggesting that these single point mutations decrease the stability of RPE65. Mutations R91W and Y368H Alter the Subcellular Localization of RPE65 Protein—Furthermore, we examined subcellular localization of wtRPE65 and its mutants in the infected QBI-293A cells. Cells infected with Ad-wtRPE65, Ad-R91W, and Ad-Y368H were fractionated. The wtRPE65 protein was found at a high level in the membrane fraction and a relatively low level in the cytosolic fraction, consistent with previous findings that RPE65 exists in a membrane associated form and a cytosolic form (38Ma J.X.

In contrast, the two RPE65 mutants predominantly exist in the cytosolic fraction, with low levels in the membrane fraction, suggesting that these mutations disrupt the membrane association of RPE65 (Fig. 4). The mutant proteins detected in the cytoskeletal/inclusion body fraction may b"

Although the molecular mechanism of the GroEL system has been examined previously, the mechanism by which GroEL and GroES assist folding of nascent polypeptides during translation is still poorly understood. We previously demonstrated a co-translational involvement of the Escherichia coli GroEL in folding of newly synthesized polypeptides using a reconstituted cell-free translation system (Ying, B. W., Taguchi, H., Kondo, M., and Ueda, T. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 12035–12040). Employing the same system here, we further characterized the mechanism by which GroEL assists folding of translated proteins via encapsulation into the GroEL-GroES cavity. The stable co-translational association between GroEL and the newly synthesized polypeptide is dependent on the length of the nascent chain. Furthermore, GroES is capable of interacting with the GroEL-nascent peptide-ribosome complex, and experiments using a single-ring variant of GroEL clearly indicate that GroES association occurs only at the trans-ring, not the cis-ring, of GroEL. GroEL holds the nascent chain on the ribosome in a polypeptide length-dependent manner and post-translationally encapsulates the polypeptide using the GroES cap to accomplish the chaperonin-mediated folding process.

GroEL forms a large ring-shaped structure comprised of two heptameric rings of identical 57-kDa subunits, and these rings are stacked back-to-back (12Weiss C. Goloubinoff P. J. Biol.

Nature. 1997; 388: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). GroEL executes two consecutive processes: binding of substrate proteins to prevent irreversible aggregation (the holder function) and release of the arrested protein to complete folding (the folder function) (5Taguchi H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2005; 137: 543-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The orderly progression of these two reactions is coordinated by ATP and GroES as follows. The substrate polypeptide is bound through multiple apical domains (7Farr G.W. Furtak K. Rowland M.B. Ranson N.A. Saibil H.R. Kirchhausen T. Horwich A.L.

In the most productive pathway, the release of the substrate protein results in its encapsulation in a cavity formed by the GroEL-GroES complex (15Weissman J.S. Hohl C.M. Kovalenko O. Kashi Y.

In E. coli, three major chaperone systems, the trigger factor (TF), 3The abbreviations used are: TF, trigger factor; PURE, protein synthesis using recombinant elements; DSP, dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate); CCT, chaperonin containing t-complex polypeptide 1; TRiC, TcP-1 ring complex. DnaK, and GroEL systems, are known to be involved in the folding of translated proteins (4Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M.

The prevailing view assumes that TF and the DnaK system act as co-translational chaperones to prevent protein aggregation, whereas GroEL acts as a post-translational chaperone to help polypeptides that have been released from the ribosome to reach their native state (4Hartl F.U.

However, the recent finding that overproduction of GroEL and GroES permits the growth of the E. coli lacking TF and DnaK (27Vorderwulbecke S. Kramer G. Merz F. Kurz T.A. Rauch T. Zachmann-Brand B.

EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) has raised questions as to whether the roles of these chaperones are non-overlapping. We recently reevaluated the role of GroEL in the folding of newly translated polypeptides in vivo and in vitro and found that GroEL co-translationally associated with nascent polypeptides (29Ying B.W. Taguchi H. Kondo M. Ueda T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12035-12040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To investigate the involvement of GroEL during translation, we have used a highly controllable cell-free translation system, called the PURE (protein synthesis using recombinant elements) system (30Shimizu Y. Inoue A. Tomari Y. Suzuki T. Yokogawa T. Nishikawa K. Ueda T. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (1343) Google Scholar, 31Shimizu Y. Kanamori T. Ueda T. Methods (San Diego). 2005; 36: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), that contains only a minimal set of purified E. coli factors responsible for protein synthesis. Taking advantage of the PURE system, which lacks all endogenous chaperones (30Shimizu Y. Inoue A. Tomari Y. Suzuki T. Yokogawa T. Nishikawa K. Ueda T. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (1343) Google Scholar, 32Ying B.W. Taguchi H. Ueda H. Ueda T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 1359-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), we clearly demonstrated that GroEL associated with the translation complex and mediated correct folding by encapsulating the newly synthesized polypeptide in the cavity formed by the GroEL-GroES complex (29Ying B.W. Taguchi H. Kondo M. Ueda T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12035-12040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). How GroEL associates with the translation complex and how GroES participates in the folding process remain to be clarified. The aim of this study was to elucidate the detailed molecular mechanism of the co-translational involvement of GroEL. The results presented here show that a stable association of a nascent protein with GroEL is dependent on the length of the newly translated polypeptide and that the post-translational capping by GroES leads to encapsulation of the substrate protein into the GroEL-GroES cavity for correct folding. Proteins and Reagents—The GroEL variants (GroEL and SR1), GroES, antibodies to each of the proteins, and IgG-horse radish peroxidase conjugates were all obtained from commercial sources or were prepared as described previously (15Weissman J.S.

Construction of Truncated MetK Protein mRNAs—Adenosyl-methionine synthetase (MetK) protein mRNAs of various lengths were prepared by PCR amplification using the plasmid pET20b-metK constructed previously (29Ying B.W. Taguchi H. Kondo M. Ueda T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12035-12040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) as the template. A universal 5′-primer containing a T7 promoter and individual 3′-primers consisting of the corresponding 3′-end MetK sequences and the termination codon sequence TAA were used for PCR amplification to generate the MetK fragments of different lengths. Cell-free Translation—Transcription translation-coupled cell-free translation using the PURE system was carried out as described (32Ying B.W. Taguchi H. Ueda H. Ueda T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 1359-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) with a slight modification of the magnesium concentration (13 mm) in the reaction. When indicated, the final concentrations of the added chaperones were: 0.2 μm GroEL, 14-mer, 0.2 μm GroES, 7-mer, and 0.2 μm SR1, 7-mer. Autoradiographic Analysis and Enzyme Assays—The solubility of in vitro synthesized MetK was evaluated by autoradiographic analysis of the radiolabeled translation products as described previously (32Ying B.W. Taguchi H. Ueda H. Ueda T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 1359-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The solubility of the translated product was calculated as the ratio of the soluble against total amount of 35S-incorporated full-length proteins. MetK activity was assayed as described previously (29Ying B.W. Taguchi H. Kondo M. Ueda T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12035-12040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The ratio of the maximal rate of 14C-labeled adenosyl-methionine synthesis to the soluble amount of the translated product was calculated as the relative enzymatic activity of the enzyme. Western Blot and Proteolysis—Western blotting analyses were performed to detect the presence of GroEL and GroES, as described previously (32Ying B.W. Taguchi H. Ueda H. Ueda T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 1359-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The proteolysis analysis using proteinase K was performed as in the previous report (29Ying B.W. Taguchi H. Kondo M. Ueda T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12035-12040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Preparation of the Translation Complexes—Single-round translation was carried out at 37 °C for ∼15 min and quenched by the addition of chilled buffer, as described previously (29Ying B.W. Taguchi H. Kondo M. Ueda T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12035-12040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The resultant mixture was immediately separated by centrifugation (35,000 rpm, 5 h) on a 10–50% continuous sucrose gradient and fractionated as described previously (29Ying B.W. Taguchi H. Kondo M. Ueda T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12035-12040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Preparation of the Cross-linked Translation Complexes—A single round of translation was quenched, as described above, if necessary, followed by cross-linking using DSP, according to the manufacturer's protocol. The reaction mixture was then overlaid onto 1.5 ml of buffer G (32Ying B.W. Taguchi H. Ueda H. Ueda T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 1359-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and centrifuged in a TLA100.3 rotor at 50,000 rpm for 4 h. The resulting pellet was dissolved using buffer S (20 mm Hepes-KOH, 10 mm Mg(OAc)2, 30 mm KCl, 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.6). Stable Co-translational Association of GroEL with the Nascent MetK Peptide Is Dependent on the Polypeptide Length—We have used the essential E. coli protein MetK (35Markham G.D. DeParasis J. Gatmaitan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14505-14507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Wei Y. Newman E.B. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 1651-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) as a model substrate for further investigation of the translation-coupled folding process since our previous study using the PURE system clearly demonstrated that GroEL was able to associate with the nascent MetK polypeptide on the ribosome (29Ying B.W. Taguchi H. Kondo M. Ueda T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12035-12040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In addition, MetK is known to be a GroEL-associated protein, and refolding of denatured MetK is stringently dependent on GroEL, GroES, and ATP (10Houry W.A. Frishman D. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1999; 402: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 11Kerner M.J. Naylor D.J. Ishihama Y. Maier T. Chang H.C. Stines A.P. Georgopoulos C. Frishman D. Hayer-Hartl M. Mann M. Hartl F.U. Cell. 2005; 122: 209-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar), indicating that it is an excellent model substrate for the GroEL system. We first asked whether stable co-translational association of the nascent polypeptide with GroEL required a particular length of polypeptide. Several mRNAs for truncated MetK proteins of various lengths were constructed, as illustrated in Fig. 1A. Truncated and full-length (383 amino acids) MetK mRNAs were subsequently subjected to a single round of cell-free translation from which the release factors were omitted. The translation complexes were collected by ultracentrifugation, and the resultant pellets were analyzed by Western blot to detect the presence of GroEL. As shown in Fig. 1B, the amount of GroEL in the translation mixture of the 240-amino-acid MetK fragment (lane 4) was almost the same as that of the full-length polypeptide (lane 5). In contrast, the amount of GroEL in the translation complexes markedly decreased in the translation reactions of MetK polypeptides shorter than 99 amino acids (lanes 1–3) and was comparable with the background level (lane 6). These data suggested that the co-translational association between the nascent polypeptide and GroEL depends on the length of the translated protein. GroES Associates with the GroEL Translation Complex—We have previously demonstrated that GroES, together with GroEL, encapsulated the MetK polypeptide and was required for its proper folding (29Ying B.W. Taguchi H. Kondo M. Ueda T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12035-12040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We next investigated the timing of GroES binding to GroEL during encapsulation of the substrate protein. Considering that the GroEL residues involved in GroES binding mostly overlap with those responsible for substrate protein binding (13Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar, 14Fenton W.A. Kashi Y. Furtak K. Horwich A.L.

Cell. 1999; 99: 757-768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that GroES binds to the cis-ring of GroEL, which associates with the nascent peptide on the ribosome. However, recent analyses using single-molecule analysis, as well as GroEL mutants, suggest an intermediate cis-ternary complex in which GroES binds to the cis-ring of GroEL loaded with the substrate protein during the functional GroEL cycle (34Taguchi H. Ueno T. Tadakuma H. Yoshida M. Funatsu T. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 861-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 39Kawata Y. Kawagoe M. Hongo K. Miyazaki T. Higurashi T. Mizobata T. Nagai J.

Chem. 2006; 281: 962-967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the translation complex binds GroES in vivo (29Ying B.W. Taguchi H. Kondo M. Ueda T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12035-12040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), although we could not exclude the possibility that GroES co-translationally associated with the translation complex in the cell as the nascent GroES polypeptide emerged from the ribosome. To address this issue, we conducted an in vitro translation using the PURE system to examine the co-translational association of GroES. Single round cell-free translations, with or without the MetK mRNA, were carried out in the presence of both GroEL and GroES followed by ultracentrifugation to isolate the translating ribosome complexes. Both the supernatants (free GroES) and the pellets (GroES bound to the translation complexes) were subjected to Western blot analysis using an antibody against GroES. In the presence of mRNA, GroES was found both in the translating ribosome complex (the pellets) and free in the supernatant (Fig. 2, lane 1), whereas GroES was only found as the free form (supernatant) in the absence of mRNA. This result clearly indicates the co-translational involvement of GroES in vitro using the PURE system. Binding Topology of GroES to GroEL Double Rings Using a Single-ring Variant (SR1) of GroEL—The observation that the association of GroES with the translation complex is dependent on the presence of mRNA and the fact that GroES does not directly bind denatured proteins suggest that GroES in the translating ribosome complex may be associated with GroEL bound to the nascent polypeptide. Since GroES can bind either the cis-ring or the trans-ring of GroEL in the presence of ATP (15Weissman J.S. Hohl C.M. Kovalenko O. Kashi Y. Chen S. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1995; 83: 577-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), we next investigated the binding topology of the proteins. Since the wild-type GroEL has two identical rings facing back-to-back, it is hard to distinguish which ring contacts GroES. Thus, we utilized a single-ring variant of GroEL, called SR1, to examine GroES binding. SR1 contains four point mutations that abolish the major contacts between the two rings of GroEL and has been shown to bind to, but not readily release, GroES in the presence of ATP (42Weissman J.S. Rye H.S. Fenton W.A. Beechem J.M. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). If SR1 is able to mediate correct folding of MetK, the presence of GroES in the translation complex would indicate that GroES binds to the cis-ring of SR1 because the trans-ring is absent in SR1. To investigate whether SR1 and GroES assist the functional folding of MetK in the PURE system, the solubility and enzymatic activity of MetK synthesized in the presence of SR1 or SR1-GroES were evaluated. The soluble amount of the newly synthesized MetK increased in translation reactions performed with increasing amounts of SR1-GroES or GroEL-GroES (Fig. 3A), indicating that SR1-GroES was able to prevent aggregation of the newly translated MetK as efficiently as the GroEL-GroES complex. Subsequently, the enzymatic activity of the newly synthesized MetK was estimated to assess the folding status. The addition of both SR1 and GroES significantly increased the relative biological activity of MetK (Fig. 3B). These data indicate that the proper folding of the translated MetK was dependent on SR1-GroES to a similar extent as the wild-type GroEL-GroES. Subsequently, we ascertained whether SR1 encapsulates MetK into the cavity formed with GroES. Translation products were treated with various concentrations of proteinase K (0, 20, 200 μg/ml) followed by native-PAGE (5–10% gradient gel) to evaluate the resistance of the chaperonin-MetK complex to the protease. As shown in Fig. 3C, the products translated in the presence of SR1 and GroES (lane 1, MetK-SR1) survived proteolysis (lane 2, MetK-SR1), whereas those translated in the presence of SR1 alone (lane 4, MetK-SR1) were completely digested by proteinase K, even at the lowest concentration (lane 5). In addition, the native and intermediate MetK proteins (Fig. 3C, MetKI and MetKN) were detected as sharp bands, which is consistent with our previous results with wild-type GroEL (29Ying B.W. Taguchi H. Kondo M. Ueda T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12035-12040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Thus, SR1 assisted the folding of MetK by forming a cis-ternary complex with GroES. Taken together, we conclude that SR1 is able to assist the functional folding of MetK through encapsulation of the newly translated MetK in the cavity formed by the SR1-GroES complex. GroES Is Absent from the SR1-associated Translation Complex—The interactions among the nascent chain, SR1, and GroES were then investigated. The single-round translation was carried out in the presence of both SR1 and GroES, using the MetK mRNA as the template. The native translation complexes were separated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, as shown in Fig. 4A. The fractions, corresponding to the ribosomal subunits (30S and 50S) and the translating ribosomes (monosomes and polysomes) were analyzed by Western blot. SR1 was evident in the translating ribosomes (panel b, monosome and polysome fractions), indicating the co-translational association of SR1 with the nascent MetK. In contrast, the co-chaperonin GroES was hardly detectable in the translation complexes (panel c, monosome and polysome fractions) but was found mostly in the upper fractions, probably as a complex with SR1 (panel c, fractions of 30S and 50S). To confirm these results, chemical cross-linking was used to detect possible weak or transient co-translational associations of GroES to SR1 in the translation reactions. Cell-free translation in the presence of SR1 and GroES was performed with or without template mRNA. The translation complexes comprising the ribosome, the nascent peptide, the associated SR1, and GroES, if any, were covalently cross-linked using DSP, a bifunctional cleavable cross-linker targeted for amino groups followed by ultracentrifugation to separate cross-linked translation complexes from the free proteins. Samples of both the initial reaction mixture and the translation complex pellet recovered after ultracentrifugation were separated by gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions to cleave the cross-linked complexes and analyzed by Western blot (Fig. 4B). SR1, but not GroES, was detected to a greater extent in the translation complex (lane 7), although similar amounts of SR1 and GroES were observed in the reaction mixtures before ultracentrifugation (lanes 4 and 5). As controls, SR1 and GroES faintly appeared in the non-translating ribosomes (lane 8). Additionally, neither SR1 nor GroES contaminated the PURE system alone (lanes 3 and 6). These results clearly demonstrate that GroES is not co-translationally associated with SR1. We previously reported that GroEL co-translationally associated with nascent polypeptides (29Ying B.W. Taguchi H. Kondo M. Ueda T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12035-12040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This observation is not consistent with the prevailing model, which suggests that GroEL acts as a post-translational chaperone in E. coli (19Bukau B. Deuerling E. Pfund C. Craig E.A. Cell. 2000; 101: 119-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 43Netzer W.J. Hartl F.U.

This current report describes further investigations of the newly observed behavior of the GroEL system in translation and addresses several questions that arise from our previous observations. First, we have shown that the stable co-translational interaction of GroEL with the translation complex depends on the length of the nascent polypeptide, using MetK as a model substrate. At present, we cannot exclude the possibility that the C-terminal region of MetK has a specific motif for GroEL binding. Nevertheless, the results here are consistent with previous reports that GroEL has multiple binding sites for denatured proteins (14Fenton W.A. Kashi Y. Furtak K. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1994; 371: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 45Ashcroft A.E. Brinker A. Coyle J.E. Weber F. Kaiser M. Moroder L. Parsons M.R. Jager J. Hartl U.F. Hayer-Hartl M. Radford S.E.

Biol. 2003; 334: 489-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and that multivalent binding of substrate proteins to GroEL is required for folding of stringent substrates (7Farr G.W. Furtak K. Rowland M.B. Ranson N.A. Saibil H.R. Kirchhausen T. Horwich A.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 561-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In addition, earlier observations that the protein substrates of GroEL in vivo are larger than ∼10 kDa (8Ewalt K.L. Hendrick J.P. Houry W.A. Hartl F.U. Cell. 1997; 90: 491-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 10Houry W.A. Frishman D. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Hartl F.U.

Hartl F.U. Cell. 2005; 122: 209-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) are also consistent with our results. Further studies on nascent polypeptides other than MetK are necessary to draw a general conclusion that GroEL preferentially associates with longer nascent polypeptides. The preferential stable binding of GroEL to longer nascent polypeptides might be compatible with the presence of other co-translational chaperones, such as the trigger factor, which can also protect nascent polypeptides from aggregation (24Ferbitz L. Maier T. Patzelt H. Bukau B. Deuerling E. Ban N. Nature. 2004; 431: 590-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 25Tomic S. Johnson A.E. Hartl F.U. Etchells S.A. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 72-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 26Hoffmann A. Merz F. Rutkowska A. Zachmann-Brand B. Deuerling E. Bukau B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6539-6545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). For example, polypeptides emerging from the ribosomal tunnel could associate with the trigger factor, and subsequently, following elongation of the polypeptides, could be exchanged for GroEL. This scheme might cause a transient simultaneous association of both the trigger factor and GroEL with a single nascent chain. Alternatively, GroEL may be required instead of the trigger factor in some cases, as indicated by the recent report showing that the trigger factor was not a general shield for nascent peptides (25Tomic S. Johnson A.E. Hartl F.U. Etchells S.A. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 72-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We assumed that such long nascent chains that are not protected by the trigger factor might require GroEL for proper folding. To elucidate the preferential co-translational association between the nascent peptides and individual chaperones, further well designed experiments performed in the presence of the additional trigger factor and/or the DnaK system, besides GroEL, are underway. It has been estimated that the cellular concentration of GroEL is less than one-tenth that of ribosomes (47Lorimer G.H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 48Ellis R.J. Hartl F.U. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), indicating that all nascent polypeptides cannot be protected by the GroEL system. In fact, a proteome-wide analysis of GroEL substrate proteins in GroEL-substrate complexes in vivo revealed a set of substrate proteins that stringently need the GroEL system (the class III substrates) (11Kerner M.J. Naylor D.J. Ishihama Y. Maier T. Chang H.C. Stines A.P. Georgopoulos C. Frishman D. Hayer-Hartl M. Mann M. Hartl F.U. Cell. 2005; 122: 209-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). What makes substrates stringently dependent on GroEL is not clear, but the nascent chain length-dependent co-translational association of GroEL may provide a rational explanation for the mechanism by which stringent substrates are enriched in the GroEL complexes. Considering that the longer the nascent polypeptides are, the more difficult protein folding is, longer polypeptides that can associate with the multiple binding sites in GroEL may experience a more efficient post-translational assistance by the GroEL system. Furthermore, the formation of such co-translational GroEL binding to the nascent chains has a potential advantage for proteins that stringently require the GroEL system since it may prevent formation of irreversible aggregates. Secondly, we addressed how GroES assists GroEL-dependent folding of the nascent protein. We showed that both the double-ring GroEL (wild type) and the single-ring SR1 are able to mediate folding of the stringent substrate MetK via GroES capped encapsulation of the substrate. The double-ring GroEL interacted with both the nascent MetK and GroES, whereas SR1 bound to the nascent MetK, but not to GroES, during translation. These results clearly indicate that GroES interacts with the trans-ring, but not the cis-ring, of the wild-type GroEL associated with the nascent polypeptide. Subsequently, GroES may cap the cis-ring of GroEL, which has incorporated the newly synthesized polypeptide detached from ribosome. Since even SR1 can encapsulate the substrate without the trans-GroES interaction, one might ask what are the differences between the double-ring GroEL and SR1 in the encapsulation processes. At least under the condition in which single-round translation was conducted, the efficiencies of the encapsulation processes were similar, indicating that the trans-GroES interaction is not necessary for the encapsulation itself. Further, we suggest that the encapsulation by the cis-binding of GroES occurs after detachment of the trans-bound GroES in the case of the double-ring GroEL. We previously found an association of GroES with the translation complex in growing E. coli (29Ying B.W. Taguchi H. Kondo M. Ueda T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12035-12040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Now we can understand that this GroES interaction in vivo would be via the trans-ring of GroEL, although the trans-GroES binding is not a prerequisite for the encapsulation of the substrate polypeptides. Then what is the importance of this trans-ring interaction of GroES? We assume that the co-translational binding of the asymmetric GroEL-GroES complex to nascent polypeptides seems to reflect the double-ring GroEL as a “two-stroke engine” (49Lorimer G. Nature. 1997; 388: 720-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 50Xu Z. Sigler P.B. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 124: 129-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), resulting in an efficient cycling of GroEL turnover. Since the double-ring GroEL alternates its rings as folding-active cis-complexes (51Rye H.S. Roseman A.M. Chen S. Furtak K. Fenton W.A. Saibil H.R. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1999; 97: 325-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), the co-translational binding as the asymmetric complex would be appropriate for the efficient use of the limited amount of GroEL in the cell (47Lorimer G.H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 48Ellis R.J. Hartl F.U. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Such a two-stroke mode for GroEL-mediated folding would be extremely important in the cells lacking other co-translational chaperones, trigger factors, or DnaK. Furthermore, the eukaryotic group II chaperonin CCT/TRiC, which does not require GroES-like co-chaperonin, has been known to work in a co-translational mode (e.g. Ref. 52Etchells S.A. Meyer A.S. Yam A.Y. Roobol A. Miao Y. Shao Y. Carden M.J. Skach W.R. Frydman J. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28118-28126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). As CCT/TRiC seems to contain a built-in lid structure (53Klumpp M. Baumeister W. Essen L.O. Cell. 1997; 91: 263-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 54Ditzel L. Lowe J. Stock D. Stetter K.O. Huber H. Huber R. Steinbacher S. Cell. 1998; 93: 125-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), the trans-ring lid of the nascent peptide-bound CCT/TRiC might be an evolutional consequence of the co-translational trans-capping of GroES. Post-translational capping by GroES would ensure efficient encapsulation of the substrate proteins in the GroEL-GroES cavity. The upper limit of the polypeptides accommodated in the GroEL-GroES cavity is ∼57 kDa (17Sakikawa C. Taguchi H. Makino Y. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21251-21256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, it has been reported that some larger molecular weight proteins serve as substrates for GroEL-GroES, both in vitro and in vivo (7Farr G.W. Furtak K. Rowland M.B. Ranson N.A. Saibil H.R.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3220-3230Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The GroEL-polypeptide complex could be capped by GroES exclusively in the trans-configuration once these large proteins exceed the encapsulation capacity (55Chaudhuri T.K. Farr G.W. Fenton W.A. Rospert S. Horwich A.L. Cell. 2001; 107: 235-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 56Farr G.W. Fenton W.A. Chaudhuri T.K. Clare D.K. Saibil H.R. Horwich A.L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3220-3230Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The co-translational asymmetric complex described here, in which GroES bound to the trans-GroEL ring, might represent a complex in which GroES capped the trans-ring of GroEL that had bound to a protein too large to be encapsulated. Indeed, the ribosome-nascent polypeptide complex is extremely large when compared with the GroEL cavity. Our results demonstrate that GroEL can contact and associate with the nascent polypeptide portion of this complex as a holder chaperone. After that, GroEL may exert a folder activity together with the co-chaperonin GroES once the GroEL cavity is spatially sufficient to encapsulate the substrate protein. In summary, we have revealed that GroEL is not only a post-translational but also a co-translational chaperone in the translation process. An immediate conclusion is that these co- and post-translational roles correspond to the holder and folder functions, respectively. Thus, the progression from the co- to post-translational function should be guaranteed by the binding of GroES to the cis-GroEL ring. In this context, GroES is a key regulator in the chaperonin system for post-translational processes. In eukaryotes, co-translational folding predominates in translation (43Netzer W.J. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1997; 388: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 52Etchells S.A. Meyer A.S. Yam A.Y. Roobol A. Miao Y. Shao Y. Carden M.J. Skach W.R. Frydman J. Johnson A.E. J. Biol.

The absence of a direct homolog of GroES in eukaryotes might be an evolutionary consequence of the preference in the folding process."

It has been hypothesized that human CB2 (hCB2) and its ligands are immune regulators due to the defined expression of hCB2 mRNA in peripheral immune cells and tissues. This hypothesis was bolstered by studies showing that 2-arachidonyl glycerol, a full agonist at hCB2 (1Gonsiorek W. Lunn C. Fan X. Narula S. Lundell D. Hipkin R.W. Mol.

However, direct measurement of hCB2 protein expression in immune cells has been hampered by the lack of radioligands with CB2 selectivity and high specific activity. Binding analyses of CB2 have used tritiated agonists such as [3H]CP55,940 or [3H]WIN55, 212 that bind with low nanomolar affinity but have low specific activities (specific activity, 20–180 Ci/mmol) and little or no selectivity versus CB1. As a result, CB2 pharmacology has been almost completely restricted to studies with recombinantly expressed receptor (for review, see Ref. 5Howlett A.C. Barth F. Bonner T.I. Cabral G. Casellas P.

Cell culture medium was purchased from Invitrogen. Cell Membrane Preparation—Sf9 membranes exogenously expressing hCB2 + β1γ2Gαi1 or β1γ2Gαi1 alone and RB-hCB2 membranes were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Other cell membrane preparations were generated as previously described (1Gonsiorek W. Lunn C. Fan X. Narula S. Lundell D. Hipkin R.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 1045-1050PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, adherent cells were harvested using cell dissociation buffer according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Dissociated cells and cells grown in suspension were collected by centrifugation and used immediately or stored at –80 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended and incubated on ice for 30 min in homogenization buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, pH 7.6) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride as a protease and amidase inhibitor (13Pertwee R.G.

Cells were then homogenized with 15–20 strokes at 900 rpm with a Dounce homogenizer using stirrer type RZR1 polytron homogenizer (Caframo, Wiarton, Ontario). Intact cells and nuclei were removed by low speed centrifugation (500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C). Membranes in the supernatant were pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and then resuspended in gly-gly buffer (20 mm glycylglycine, 1 mm MgCl2, 250 mm sucrose, pH 7.2) and stored at –80 °C. Protein determinations were performed using the Bradford method (15Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214435) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analyses—Western blots were performed as previously described (16Hipkin R.W. Friedman J. Clark R.B. Eppler C.M. Schonbrunn A. J. Biol.

CHO-hCB2, MonoMac6, Sf9-hCB2, Ba/F-hCB1, and Ba/F-hCB2 cell membranes were solubilized in sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol (v/v), 6 m urea, 20% glycerol, pH 6.8) by incubation at 60 °C for 15 min. Where indicated, membrane proteins were prepurified by wheat germ agglutinin-agarose chromatography prior to solubilization in sample buffer (16Hipkin R.W. Friedman J. Clark R.B. Eppler C.M.

Proteins were resolved on a 7.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was then blocked for 2 h with “Blotto” (10 mm NaH2PO4, 10% nonfat dry milk, 10% glycerol, 0.2% Tween 20) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the indicated antibody dilutions. Following incubation with appropriate conjugated secondary antibodies, immunoreactive proteins were detected with the ECL chemiluminescent antibody detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Synthesis of N-(1-{4-[4-methoxy-2-(4-methoxy-benzenesulfonyl)-benzenesulfonyl]-phenyl}-ethyl)-methane[35S]sulfonamide ([35S]Sch225336)—As can be seen in the schematic in Fig. 2, [35S]Sch225336 (2.4) was generated using a [35S]mesyl chloride precursor (2.1). To prepare the [35S]mesyl chloride, an aqueous solution of [35S]methane sulfonic acid (2.1) (5 mCi, 40 μl, ∼1400 Ci/mmol) was evaporated to dryness in a 10-ml V-Vial (Wheaton Scientific) and dissolved in anhydrous methylene chloride (1.5 ml). 150 μl of oxalyl chloride was added, and the reaction was stirred for 30 min under Argon prior to the addition of 20 μl of 10% dimethyl formamide. The reaction was stirred overnight at room temperature, diluted with methylene chloride (1.5 ml), cooled in an ice bath, and washed successively with ice-cooled 1% aqueous sodium bicarbonate (2 × 2 ml), room temperature 1% aqueous sodium bicarbonate (2 ml), and 2% aqueous sodium bisulfate (1 ml) solutions. The methylene chloride solution was dried for 1 h over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated to a volume of ∼50 μl via distillation for immediate use in the next step. In a 300-μl V-Vial (Wheaton Scientific), 1-{4-[methoxy-2-(4-methoxy-benzenesulfonyl)-benzenesulfonyl]-phenyl}-ethylamine (2.3) (10 mg) was dissolved in anhydrous methylene chloride (20 μl) and triethylamine (10 μl). The methylene chloride solution of [35S]mesyl chloride (2.2) (∼50 μl) was added and the reaction stirred vigorously for 1 h. The reaction was concentrated to dryness and the product purified by high pressure liquid chromatography on a 9.4 × 250 mm Zorbax Extend C18 column with a mobile phase of 0.05 m pH 9 triethylammonium acetate (40:60) acetonitrile at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. Detection was at 254 nm. A total batch of 1.3 mCi of (2.4) at a specific activity of >1400 Ci/mmol at a radiochemical purity of 99.5% was isolated. Radioligand Binding and [35S]GTPγS Exchange Assays—In radioligand binding assays, cell membranes (0.1–13 μg/point, in triplicates) were incubated in 100–150 μl of binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (Factor V, lipid free), pH 7.4) in 96-well microplates. Incubations contained the indicated concentrations of cold ligands and [3H]CP55,940 (standard activity, 180 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or [35S]Sch225336 (standard activity, 1400 Ci/mmol). After the indicated incubation time, the reaction was terminated by rapid filtration of the membranes through the microfiltration plates coated with 0.5% polyethylenimine (UniFilter GF/C filter plate; Packard, Meriden, CT), using a Tomtek 96-well cell harvester (Hamden, CT.). The membranes were washed ten times with ice-cold buffer composed of 50 mm Tris, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, pH 7. Membrane-bound radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation using a TopCount NXT Microplate Scintillation and Luminescence Counter (Packard). [35S]GTPγS exchange was measured using a scintillation proximity assay as previously described (17Gonsiorek W. Zavodny P. Hipkin R.W. J. Immunol. Methods. 2003; 273: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). For each assay point, membranes (2 μg/well in triplicate) were preincubated for 30 min at room temperature with 150 μg of wheat germ agglutinin-coated scintillation proximity assay beads (Amersham Biosciences) in scintillation proximity assay binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (Factor V, lipid free), pH 7.4) supplemented with 5 μm GDP.). The beads and membranes were transferred to a 96-well Isoplate (Wallac, Gaithersburg, MD) and incubated for 60 min at room temperature with the indicated concentrations of cannabinoids. The reactions were then incubated for a further 60 min in the presence of 0.1 nm [35S]GTPγS (triethyl ammonium salt; specific activity, 1250 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Membrane-bound [35S]GTPγS was then measured using a Trilux 1450 MicroBeta counter (Wallac, Turku, Finland). Autoradiography and Cytochemical Analysis of Frozen Sections—Adjacent 20-μm tissue sections were cut on a cryostat, mounted onto precleaned microscope glass slides (Colorfrost/Plus; Fisher), and stored at –80 °C until the day of the assay. Before the experiments, slides were brought to a room temperature and then equilibrated in the assay buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, 5 mm MgCl2, 125 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.0002% NaN3, 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (Factor V, lipid free, pH 7.4) for 5 min at 25 °C. Slides then were transferred to a fresh assay buffer containing 0.1–0.3 nm [35S]Sch225336 (1400 Ci/mmol) or 3 nm [3H]CP55,940 in the presence or absence of cold cannabinoids and incubated for 2 h at 25°C. Slides were then rinsed three times for 5 min each in cold phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, rinsed in deionized H2O, and gently dried under a stream of cold air. Sections were exposed to a tritium storage phosphor screen (GE Healthcare) for 24 h at 25 °C. The phosphor screens were then scanned and digitized using a phosphorimager Storm 860 (GE Healthcare). The sections were exposed to either Kodak BioMax MS film (tritium) or Kodak BioMax MR film ([35S]Sch225336) (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY) for 5–72 days at –80 °C. In parallel, adjacent sections were either fixed in 10% phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde and stained with hematoxylin/eosin or fixed with cold 100% acetone and used for immunohistochemistry with anti-CD79α and/or anti-CD3 (DakoCytomation, Carpinteria, CA). For immunohistochemistry, acetone-fixed slides were pretreated with 3% H2O2 and 0.1% azide for 10 min before incubation with primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Following the incubation with biotinylated anti-mouse antibody for 30 min, the binding of the antibodies was visualized with Vectastain® Elite ABC kit plus 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride or Vectastain® ABC-AP kit plus Vector Red (Vector, Burlingame, CA). When necessary, the slides were counterstained with hematoxylin. Data Analysis—Data are reported as mean values ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments, each performed in triplicate. Nonlinear regression analyses of saturation data and of concentration-response data were performed using Prism 2.0b software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) to calculate Kd, Bmax,IC50, and EC50. IC50 values were converted to apparent Ki values by the method of Cheng and Prusoff (18Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem.

Materials—The CB2-selective bis-sulfone Sch225336 (N-[1(S)-[4-[[4-methoxy-2-[(4-methoxyphenyl)sulfonyl]phenyl]sulfonyl]phenyl]ethyl]methanesulfonamide) and the cannabinoid inverse agonist standards SR141716A (N-(piperidin-1-yl)-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4 dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1H-pyrazole-3 carboxamide hydrochloride) and SR144528 (N-[(1S)-endo-1,3,3-trimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-yl]-5-(4-chloro-3-methylphenyl)-1-(4 methyl benzyl)-pyrazole-3carboxamide were prepared by the Department of Chemical Research (Schering-Plough Research Institute). HU-210 (6aR, 10aR analog of 11-hydroxy-Δ 8-tetrahydrocannabinol) was purchased from BioMol Research Laboratories, Plymouth Meeting, PA. All other reagents were of the best grade available and purchased from common suppliers. Immunoblot Analysis of hCB2 Protein—Anti-hCB2 antibodies were tested in Western blots for their utility in immunodetection of HA-tagged CB2 using an anti-HA antibody as a positive control. Membrane proteins from untransfected CHO-K1 cells or CHO-hCB2 cells overexpressing HA-tagged CB2 were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membranes were incubated with an anti-HA monoclonal antibody or polyclonal antibodies raised against peptides representing unique amino acid sequences in hCB2. The anti-HA antibody recognized a diffuse 55-kDa protein and a faint but more defined 45-kDa protein in the CB2-transfected (but not parental) CHO cells (Fig. 1A). The appearance and Mr of these proteins is reminiscent of that seen in the Western blots of CHO-hCB2 membranes generated by Carayon et al. (19Carayon P. Marchand J. Dussossoy D. Derocq J.M. Jbilo O. Bord A. Bouaboula M. Galiegue S. Mondiere P. Penarier G. Fur G.L. Defrance T. Casellas P. Blood. 1998; 92: 3605-3615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using their polyclonal antibody raised against a synthetic peptide derived from the predicted amino acid sequence of the carboxylic tail of hCB2. The diffuse appearance of the 55-kDa receptor protein is consistent with the migration patterns of a glycoprotein (20Hipkin R.W. Sanchez-Yague J. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 21Gu Y.Z. Schonbrunn A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 527-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The fainter 45-kDa protein may be a receptor precursor similar to that described for other G protein-coupled receptors (20Hipkin R.W. Sanchez-Yague J. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The classification of hCB2 as a glycoprotein is verified by its successful purification with wheat germ agglutinin chromatography prior to Western blot analysis (Fig. 1B). None of the purported anti-hCB2 antibodies that we tested (Calbiochem 209552 and 209554, ABR PA1–744 and PA1–746, Alexis) successfully identified the 55-kDa (or 45-kDa) receptor protein using a panel of recombinant and tumor cell lines. Representative immunoblots are shown in Fig. 1, C–E. None of the purported anti-hCB2 antibodies immunoreacted with proteins consistent with the experiments with the HA-tagged receptor, i.e. a diffuse 55-kDa glycoprotein. With all the antibodies tested, immunoreactive bands were quite sharp, inconsistent with hCB2 (Fig. 1, A and B) and G protein-coupled receptors in general (16Hipkin R.W. Friedman J. Clark R.B. Eppler C.M. Schonbrunn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13869-13876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 20Hipkin R.W. Sanchez-Yague J. Ascoli M. Mol.

Moreover, the immunoreactive protein(s) were either too small or too large and/or were equally evident in samples from cells that do express hCB2 (Fig. 1, D and E). With the Calbiochem 209552 antibody (Fig. 1C), a single sharp immunoreactive band (molecular mass ∼60 kDa) was evident in the CHO-hCB2 sample but not in either the Sf9-hCB2 or the Monomac6 samples. The 746 antibody did not immunoreact with any specific protein. Taken together, these data indicate that these antibodies are less than optimal for the immunodetection of authentic hCB2. Therefore, we endeavored to develop a CB2-selective radioligand. Synthesis of [35S]Sch225336—The synthesis of [35S]Sch225336 is shown schematically in Fig. 2. [35S]mesyl chloride (2.2) was prepared from commercially obtained [35S]methane sulfonic acid (2.1) by the method of Dean et al. (22Dean D.C. Nargund R.P. Pong S.S. Chaung L.Y. Griffin P. Melillo D.G. Ellsworth R.L. Van der Ploeg L.H. Patchett A.A. Smith R.G. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 1767-1770Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) using oxalyl chloride. The resulting [35S]mesyl chloride (2.2) was then reacted directly with a large molar excess (∼12,000) of the precursor primary amine of Sch225336 (2.3) to generate [35S]Sch225336 (2.4) in an ∼50% crude yield. After preparative reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography, a batch of 1.3 mCi at a radiochemical purity of 99.5% with a specific activity of >1400Ci/mmol was isolated. Equilibrium Binding Analyses with [35S]Sch225336—As can be seen in the saturation binding analysis with CHO-hCB2 membranes shown in Fig. 3A, [35S]Sch225336 bound hCB2 in a saturable manner with a Kd = 0.065 nm at equilibrium. This affinity constant is slightly lower than the Ki derived in competition binding analyses with [3H]CP55,940 (Ref. 6Lavey B.J. Kozlowski J.A. Hipkin R.W. Gonsiorek W. Lundell D.J. Piwinski J.J. Narula S. Lunn C.A. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2005; 15: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, and data not shown). Scatchard analysis of the saturation binding data (Fig. 3A, inset) revealed a single binding site with a Hill ∼1. Saturation analyses with Sf9 membranes exogenously expressing hCB2 + β1γ2Gαi1 (Fig. 3B) showed similar high affinity, saturable [35S]Sch225336 binding (Kd = 0.071 ± 0.002 nm) with no significant [35S]Sch225336 binding in Sf9 membranes expressing only β1γ2Gαi1. The utility of [35S]Sch225336 relative to [3H]CP55,940 in competition binding analyses was assessed in the CHO-hCB2 membranes. Radioligand binding was displaced in a concentration-dependent manner by unlabeled compound (Hill ∼1) (Fig. 4A), though competition bindings with [35S]Sch225336 conferred a much superior signal:noise (B/B0) relative to the tritiated agonist (Fig. 4B). [35S]Sch225336 binding was inhibited by structurally unrelated cannabinoid agonists, including CP55,940 and unlabeled Sch225336 (Fig. 4C), WIN55,212–2, HU210, anandamide, and 2-arachidonyl glycerol (data not shown) and the inverse agonist SR144528 (Fig. 4C). There was no measurable [35S]Sch225336 binding in membranes expressing hCB1 (data not shown), consistent with the low affinity of Sch225336 for CB1 measured in competition binding analyses with [3H]CP55,940 (6Lavey B.J. Kozlowski J.A. Hipkin R.W. Gonsiorek W. Lundell D.J. Piwinski J.J. Narula S. Lunn C.A. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2005; 15: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data show that [35S]Sch225336 represents a novel, high affinity CB2-specific radioligand with high specific activity. Analyses of hCB2 Expression in Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes and Hematopoietic Cell Lines—CB2 expression in hematopoietic cells has been reported, largely based on the detection of its mRNA (23Derocq J.M.

As our efforts in CB2 immunodetection were unsuccessful (above), we assessed the utility of [35S]Sch225336 to define and quantitate hCB2 expression in hemopoietic cells and cell lines. Saturation binding analyses were performed on membranes from human Jurkat T lymphoma cells (clone E6–1), human T lymphoma HUT78 cells, human monocytic U937 and MonoMac6 cells, and activated human peripheral lymphocytes (PBL). All of these cells express measurable hCB2 with the highest expression in Mono-Mac6 cell membranes, whereas the PBL and HUT78 had the lowest expression (Fig. 5A). The effect of in vitro activation conditions on PBL expression of hCB2 is shown in Fig. 5B. Membranes were prepared from PBL isolated from two different individuals and treated with phytohemagglutinin in the presence of either IL-2 (to stimulated a TH1-like phenotype) (28Mossman S.P.

Saturation analyses in membranes from HL-60 cells differentiated toward a more neutrophil-like phenotype by prolonged incubation in the presence of Me2SO or db-cAMP reveal saturable, high affinity [35S]Sch225336 binding (Fig. 5C). [35S]Sch225336 binding in membranes from monocytic (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-treated) HL-60 cells (Fig. 5D) is considerably less than that measured in Me2SO-treated HL membranes or in the monocyte-like MonoMac6 cells (Fig. 5A).

https://openalex.org/W1964508477,"Loss of fibronectin (FN) assembly in the extracellular matrix has long been recognized as a feature of cellular transformation. However, such assembly is regulated not only by FN synthesis but also by its post-translational modifications. The mechanism controlling FN protein stability has remained unclear so far. Recently it was demonstrated that FN matrix turnover occurs intracellularly at the lysosome following caveolin-1-dependent endocytosis. Although FN was reported to undergo ubiquitindependent degradation, the ubiquitin ligase responsible for FN ubiquitination is unknown. In this study, we have identified β-TrCP as the ubiquitin ligase for lysosomal degradation of FN. We found two conserved β-TrCP recognition motif (DSGVVYS and DSGSIVVS) in the primary amino acid sequence of human, mouse, and rat FN. Down-regulation of either β-TrCP1 or β-TrCP2 by small interference (siRNA) caused significant accumulation of FN. Immunolocalization studies showed intracellular accumulation of FN in β-TrCP siRNA-treated cells without showing much alteration in its matrix association. We also observed that exposure of cells to UV irradiation effectively down-regulated FN following increased ubiquitination, which was significantly inhibited either by lysosomal inhibitor or by siRNA-mediated down-regulation of β-TrCP. Taken together, constitutive FN degradation, as well as UV-induced degradation, is ubiquitination dependent and controlled by β-TrCP.

Fibronectin (FN), 2The abbreviations used are: FN, fibronectin; β-TrCP, β-transducin repeat-containing protein; ECM, extracellular matrix; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; SCF, Skp1/Cullin/F-box; siRNA, small interference RNA; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase.2The abbreviations used are: FN, fibronectin; β-TrCP, β-transducin repeat-containing protein; ECM, extracellular matrix; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; SCF, Skp1/Cullin/F-box; siRNA, small interference RNA; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase. a matrix glycoprotein, plays important roles in cell adhesion, migration, growth, and differentiation (1Pankov R. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3861-3863Crossref PubMed Scopus (1412) Google Scholar). The functional FN consists of two 250-kDa subunits linked covalently near their C termini by a pair of disulfide bonds. There are two different forms of fibronectins: plasma “cold insoluble globulin” and tissue FNs. Both forms originate from the same gene by alternative splicing in three different regions (EIIIA, EIIIB, and IIICS), giving rise to ∼20 isoforms (2Patel R.S. Odermatt E. Schwarzbauer J.E. Hynes R.O. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2565-2572Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). FN generally interacts with integrins, a major component of the extracellular matrix (ECM), and thereby facilitates bilateral exchange of information between cells and the matrix environment (3Bershadsky G.B. Pankov R. Yamada K.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar). It has been known for decades that malignant transformation modifies such cell-matrix interactions (4Labat-Robert J. Sem. Cancer Biol. 2002; 12: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and perturbed FN matrix assembly has been recognized as a hallmark of transformed cells (5Hynes R. Ali I. Destree A. Mautner V. Perkins M. Senger D. Wagner D. Smith K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1978; 312: 317-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 6Vaheri A. Alitalo K. Hedman K. Keski-Oja J. Kurkinen M. Wartiovaara J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1978; 312: 343-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). During transformation cells lose their surface FN, which has so far been attributed either to transcriptional down-regulation or to proteolytic degradation (7Moro L. Colombi M. Molinari Tosatti M.P. Barlati S. Int. J. Cancer. 1992; 51: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 8Kornblihtt A. Pesce C.G. Alonso C.R. Cramer P. Srebrow A. Werbajh S. Muro A.F. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). However, it is obscure how post-translational modifications control the metabolism of FN. It is necessary to study FN protein stability because significant up-regulation of FN protein has been detected in metastatic breast cancer tissues, without significant increase in the transcript levels (9Hao X. Sun B. Lahdesmaki H. Dunmire V. Feng Y. Zhang S.W. Wang H. Wu C. Wang H. Fuller G.N. Symmans W.F. Shmulevich I. Zhang W. Cancer. 2004; 100: 1110-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar).It has been well established that ubiquitination plays an important role in proteasomal degradation of proteins. Recent findings also emphasize the role of ubiquitination in endocytosis of plasma membrane-associated proteins followed by their sorting and lysosomal degradation (10Hicke L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). Several E3 ubiquitin ligases, such as c-Cbl/Hakai and Rsp5/NEDD4, have been implicated in such processes (11Katzmann D.J. Babst M. Emr S.D. Cell. 2001; 106: 145-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). More recently, another ubiquitin ligase, Homolog of Slimb (HOS), also known as β-TrCP2 or Fbw1b, was reported to mediate the ligand-induced ubiquitination of interferon-α receptor followed by its endocytosis and lysosomal degradation (12Kumar K.G.S. Tang W. Ravindranath A.K. Clark W.A. Croze E. Fuchs S.Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5480-5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar).Although there is only limited information about ubiquitin-mediated control of FN, FN matrix assembly is regulated by physical interaction with tumor suppressor von Hippel-Lindau protein. At a molecular level von Hippel-Lindau protein forms complexes with cullin 2, elongin B, and elongin C, together known as the VEC complex (13Ohh M. Yauch R.L. Lonergan K.M. Whaley J.M. Stemmer-Rachamimov A.O. Louis D.N. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Iliopoulos O. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 959-968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The cullin 2 and elongin C component of VEC complex is structurally similar to cullin 1/Cdc53 and Skp1, respectively, of the Skp1, Cullin, and F-box (SCF)-like ubiquitin ligases in yeast (14Stebbins C.E. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1999; 284: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). It was thus speculated that ubiquitination might be playing an important role in FN matrix assembly. It was also shown recently that relaxin, a polypeptide hormone member of the insulin-like growth factor family, could increase the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of FN in vitro (15McDonald G.A. Sarkar P. Rennke H. Unemori E. Kalluri R. Sukhatme V.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 285: F59-F67Google Scholar). Interestingly, FN has been recently reported to undergo continuous turnover through caveolin-1-dependent endocytosis followed by lysosomal degradation (16Sottile J. Chandler J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 757-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). According to these data, we speculate that the lysosomal degradation of FN may be regulated by ubiquitination. In this report, we have identified SCFβ-TrCP as a potent ubiquitin ligase that determines the rate of FN matrix turnover by promoting lysosome-mediated degradation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—Human osteosarcoma U2OS cells, mammary epithelial MCF-10A cells, and human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, T47D, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-468 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. U2OS, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-468 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and MCF-10A cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 mixed (1:1) medium supplemented with 5% horse serum. To inhibit proteasome-dependent degradation of proteins, cells were treated with 2 μm MG132 for 4 h. To inhibit lysosomal degradation, cells were treated with 20 mm methylamine hydrochloride for 4 h.Small Interference RNA—Small interference RNAs (siRNAs) were custom synthesized by Dharmacon. The sequences of anti-β-TrCP1/β-TrCP2 siRNAs were described previously (17Guardavaccaro D. Kudo Y. Boulaire J. Barchi M. Busino L. Donzelli M. Margottin-Goguet F. Jackson P.K. Yamasaki L. Pagano M. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 799-812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with 200 nm specific siRNAs or randomized cocktails of double-stranded RNA as a control, using the Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). At 24 h posttransfection, cells were transfected again with the same RNA preparations to ensure efficient silencing effects.Reverse Transcription PCR—Total RNA was isolated from cells with the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Total RNA (1 μg) was subjected to reverse transcriptase reaction using the SuperScript First-Strand synthesis system (Invitrogen). After the reverse transcriptase reaction, RNaseH was added to remove the RNA template from the reaction. Subsequently, PCR was performed in a total volume of 50 μl using 1 μl of the reverse transcriptase product. To confirm that the amounts of target mRNAs were within semiquantitative linear range of reaction, increasing amounts of RNA samples were examined in pilot experiments. The primers used for β-TrCP1 amplification were 5′-GGGGCCTATGATGGAAAAAT-3′ and 5′-TATGTTCGAGAAGGGGAACG-3′ and those for β-TrCP2 amplification were 5′-AAACCAGCCTGGAATGTTTG-3′ and 5′-CAGTCCATTGCTGAAGCGTA-3′. The primers used for co-amplification (143 kb) of the control RPS14 ribosomal mRNA were 5′-GGCAGACCGAGATGAATCCTCA-3′ and 5′-CAGGTCCAGGGGTCTTGGTCC-3′. The reaction was performed in the PTC-200 Peltier Thermal Cycler (MJ Research) at 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 23 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. Amplified DNAs were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, and signals in ethidium bromide-stained gels were quantified using the EDAS-290 Imaging System (Kodak).Antibodies, Immunoblotting, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunostaining—Polyclonal anti-fibronectin (Ab-10) antibody was purchased from Neomarker, and mouse monoclonal anti-fibronectin antibody was purchased from Calbiochem. Anti-β-actin (AC-15) monoclonal antibody was purchased from Sigma. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and rabbit immunoglobulin secondary antibodies, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse and Texas Red-conjugated anti-rabbit, as well as recombinant protein A-agarose beads and the Supersignal West Pico chemiluminescence reagent, were obtained from Pierce. To prepare cell lysates, cells were scraped off and lysed by sonication in a buffer including 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm NaF, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, ×100 diluted protease inhibitor mixture (P8340; Sigma), 10% glycerol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. All the chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Immunoblotting and immunofluorescence staining were performed as described previously (18Zou X. Tsutsui T. Ray D. Blomquist J.F. Ichijo H. Ucker D.S. Kiyokawa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4818-4828Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Fluorescent-labeled cells were imaged on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted microscope followed by optical sectioning using Apotome slider module (Carl Zeiss Inc.). The signals on films were quantified by densitometric scanning using the GS-700 Imaging System and Molecular Analyst software (Bio-Rad).Differential Separation of Matrix-associated FN—Matrix were prepared as described previously (19Munshi H.G. Stack M.S. Methods Cell Biol. 2002; 69: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In brief, MCF-10A cells were transfected with small interference RNA as described above. At 48 h post-transfection, cells were either left untreated or treated for 5 min with 20 mm ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH). Released intracellular materials were washed completely with a flow of water followed by wash with phosphate-buffered saline. Matrix were collected by scraping using the lysis buffer described above, and for immunostaining, matrix were fixed using 10% buffered formalin.RESULTSFibronectin Contains Putative β-TrCP Recognition Motifs—FN was reported to undergo continuous endocytosis and degradation at the lysosome in a caveolin-1-dependent manner (16Sottile J. Chandler J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 757-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In accordance with recent studies that have suggested the involvement of ubiquitination in endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of receptors (10Hicke L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar), we first examined the involvement of the above ubiquitin ligases in our system. As β-TrCP was known to recognize its substrate through DpSG(X) 2+npS destruction motif, we analyzed human, mouse, and rat FN peptide sequences and identified two such destruction motifs (DSGVVYS and DSGSIVVS) that are conserved in all three species (Fig. 1A).β-TrCP1/2 siRNA Increases Endogenous Fibronectin Levels—To investigate whether FN is a substrate for SCFβ-TrCP, we transfected human mammary epithelial MCF-10A cells with β-TrCP1 and β-TrCP2 siRNA and analyzed total (cellular and matrix-associated) FN levels by Western blotting. As expected, a significant increase in the FN level was detected both in β-TrCP1- and β-TrCP2-siRNA treated cells (Fig. 1B). However, β-TrCP2 was more effective in stabilizing FN levels compared with β-TrCP1 (Fig. 1B). To evaluate the importance of β-TrCP in regulating FN levels in other cell line cultures, we tested the effect of β-TrCP2 knock down in a panel of human breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-231, and T47D) and also in the human osteosarcoma U2OS cells. In all cases tested, β-TrCP2 knock down resulted in significant increases in endogenous FN levels within 48 h of siRNA transfection (Fig. 1C). Taken together, these data indicate that SCFβ-TrCP negatively regulates FN levels.β-TrCP2 Suppression Results in Accumulation of Intracellular FN—Because we consistently observed increased levels of total fibronectin in β-TrCP2 siRNA-treated cultures, we then examined the FN localization in control and β-TrCP2 siRNA-treated MCF-10A cells. To fractionate matrix-associated FN, we eliminated cellular proteins from culture preparations by osmotically lysing cells with NH4OH followed by repeated wash as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Immunoblotting demonstrated no major change in the amount of matrix-associated FN in β-TrCP2 siRNA-treated cultures compared with control cultures (Fig. 2A). Immunostaining of similarly treated cell cultures also showed comparable staining patterns, structure, and levels of matrix-associated FN (Fig. 2B, c and d). In sharp contrast, immunostaining of whole cell culture preparations showed that β-TrCP2 siRNA-treated cells had significantly increased levels of intracellular FN staining compared with control cultures (Fig. 2B, a and b). Therefore, β-TrCP appears to play an essential role in intracellular processing or disposal of FN and probably not in its matrix assembly; absence of such ubiquitin ligase activity could lead to intracellular accumulation of FN.FIGURE 2β-TrCP2 siRNA-treated MCF-10A cells accumulate intracellular fibronectin without significant changes in extracellular FN matrix assembly. A, cells were either mock transfected or transfected with β-TrCP2 siRNA. At 48 h post-transfection, cells were either left untreated or treated with 20 mm ammonium hydroxide for 10 min. Total cell lysates or matrix-only-associated fractions were collected as described under “Experimental Procedures.” FN protein levels were determined by immunoblotting. B, immunostaining of FN in whole cell cultures (left panels) and extracellular matrix-only fractions (right panels). MCF-10A cells were transfected with indicated siRNAs, and samples were prepared.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fibronectin Undergoes Ubiquitination and Degradation upon UV Irradiation—Treatment of cells with genotoxic agents such as UV irradiation, X-rays, and alkylating compounds is known to alter the synthesis as well as degradation of various extracellular matrix-associated proteins (20Zhao W.

When U2OS cells were exposed to different doses (20-200 J/m2) of UV irradiation and further incubated for different time periods, progressive down-regulation of total FN levels was detected in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). Moreover, immunoprecipitation of FN followed by immunoblotting for ubiquitin showed a significant increase in FN ubiquitination upon UV treatment of U2OS cells, confirming the role of ubiquitination in the process (Fig. 3C). In contrast, when cells were treated with γ-irradiation, we did not detect any significant change in the total FN level even at higher doses of γ-irradiation (10 grays) (Fig. 3B).FIGURE 3Fibronectin undergoes ubiquitination and degradation upon UV treatment. A, human osteosarcoma U2OS cells were either left untreated or treated with different doses (20-200 J/m2) of UV irradiation. Cell lysates were collected at different times after irradiation, and FN protein levels were determined by immunoblotting. B, cells were irradiated with different doses (6-10 grays) of γ-irradiation, and FN protein levels at the indicated times after irradiation were determined by immunoblotting. C, cell lysates from UV-irradiated (20 J/m2) or non-irradiated cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FN antibody or negative control IgG (NC), followed by immunoblotting with anti-ubiquitin (Ub) antibody. Poly-ubiquitinated species of FN are indicated as Fibronectin-(Ub)n.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)UV-mediated Degradation of Fibronectin Is Mediated by Lysosomes—As it was previously demonstrated that FN undergoes continuous turnover through a lysosome-dependent pathway, we examined whether UV-dependent FN down-regulation was mediated by either lysosomal or proteasomal degradation. U2OS cells were UV irradiated in the presence of the lysosomal inhibitor methylamine hydrochloride or the proteasomal inhibitor MG132. The UV-mediated FN degradation was almost completely protected by methylamine hydrochloride, whereas MG132 was ineffective (Fig. 4A). These results suggest that UV irradiation induces rapid ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation of FN.FIGURE 4UV-mediated down-regulation of fibronectin is abolished either by lysosomal inhibitor or by β-TrCP2 siRNA. A, human osteosarcoma U2OS cells were treated with UV irradiation (20 J/m2) in the presence or absence of either lysosomal inhibitor (methylamine hydrochloride (MA)at20 mm) or proteasomal inhibitor MG132 at 2 μm. At 2 h post-irradiation, FN levels in whole cell cultures were determined by immunoblotting. B, U2OS cells were either mock transfected or transfected with β-TrCP2 siRNA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” At 48 h post-transfection, cells were left untreated or irradiated with 20 J/m2 UV. At 2 h post-irradiation, cell lysates were prepared for immunoblotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)β-TrCP2 Is Involved in UV-mediated Degradation of FN—Because it became clear that the UV-mediated FN degradation is a lysosomal event preceded by increased ubiquitination, we then assessed whether SCFβ-TrCP plays a key role in the process. Interestingly, previous studies suggested that SCFβ-TrCP can control not only proteasomal but also lysosomal degradation of the interferon-α receptor (12Kumar K.G.S. Tang W. Ravindranath A.K. Clark W.A. Croze E. Fuchs S.Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5480-5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Thus, we transfected U2OS cells with β-TrCP2 siRNA, and 48 h later cells were exposed to 20 J/m2 UV irradiation. Total FN levels in cultures were measured by immunoblotting at 2 h post-irradiation. β-TrCP2 knock down by siRNA significantly blocked the UV-mediated FN degradation, suggesting that β-TrCP2 is involved in the UV-mediated lysosomal degradation of FN (Fig. 4B).DISCUSSIONECM remodeling is known to play important roles in various biological events, including tissue homeostasis and malignant transformation of cells (24Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1990; 60: 849-859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 25Pasqualini R. Bourdoulous S. Koivunen E. Woods V. Ruoslahti E. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 1197-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Among various regulators, FN matrix polymerization is a key regulator of ECM remodeling (26Sottile J. Hocking D.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3546-3559Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Recent studies also indicated that FN matrix turnover is a critical determinant for ECM remodeling (16Sottile J. Chandler J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 757-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Therefore, identification of factors regulating FN matrix turnover is essential for better understanding of the biology of ECM. Previous studies have shown that FN matrix turnover occurs through a caveolin-1-dependent endocytotic process followed by lysosomal degradation (16Sottile J. Chandler J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 757-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Although initially it was believed that the lysosomal degradation of proteins might not be precisely regulated, more recent studies showed that ubiquitination plays important roles not only in proteasomal degradation but also in lysosomal degradation (27Urbe S. Essays Biochem. 2005; 41: 81-98Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we attempted to identify the ubiquitin ligase for FN turnover. By locating the conserved amino acid motif DSG(X)2+nS and also by using siRNA technology, we could identify SCFβ-TrCP as a ubiquitin ligase promoting constitutive as well as UV-mediated FN degradation.As ubiquitination has already been implicated for FN matrix assembly (13Ohh M. Yauch R.L. Lonergan K.M. Whaley J.M. Stemmer-Rachamimov A.O. Louis D.N. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Iliopoulos O. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 959-968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), we also investigated the effect of β-TrCP knock down on FN matrix assembly. However, our data indicate that β-TrCP does not significantly affect FN matrix assembly. Thus, ubiquitination of FN by different E3 ligases may lead to distinct consequences, i.e. von Hippel-Lindau protein-mediated ubiquitination regulating matrix assembly (28Stickle N.H. Chung J. Klco J.M. Hill R.P. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Ohh M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3251-3261Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and β-TrCP-mediated ubiquitination promoting lysosomal degradation. A fine balance between the activities of the two ubiquitin ligases may determine the homeostasis of FN. At this point it is plausible to hypothesize that following endocytosis, FN has to be ubiquitinated by β-TrCP before being targeted to lysosome for degradation.Another possibility is that β-TrCP-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of FN is important for “ER quality control.” In eukaryotic cells the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has the inherent ability to ensure that only correctly folded and assembled proteins are forwarded to their destination (29Rose J.K. Doms R.W. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 257-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 30Hurtley S.M. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 277-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). Most of the membrane-associated and secretory proteins are synthesized in the polysomes bound to the rough ER. During and shortly after its synthesis, the ectodomain assumes proper conformation in the lumen of the ER. Proteins that fail to assume their correct final conformation in the lumen of the ER in most cases undergo ubiquitin-dependent degradation in the cytosol (31de Virgilio M. Weninger H. Ivessa N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9734-9743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). For example, aggrecan, a major proteoglycan of the cartilage extracellular matrix, has already been reported to undergo such ubiquitination-dependent proteasomal degradation (32Domowicz M.S Pirok E.W. II I Novak T.E. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35098-35105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It is possible that if FN protein is misfolded it may undergo ubiquitination-dependent lysosomal degradation and SCFβ-TrCP may play an essential role in the process. However, whether the intracellularly accumulated FN proteins in cells with β-TrCP knock down are misfolded, similarly to aggrecan, remains to be determined. Recent reports have shown that certain human cancers, e.g. metastatic thyroid carcinoma (33Ryu S. Jimi S. Eura Y. Kato T. Takebayashi S. Cancer Lett. 1998; 133: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), display intracellular accumulation of FN, which may be associated with the more aggressive behavior of such tumors. Interestingly, in the peptide sequence of aggrecan we noticed the DSG(X)2+nS motif, which can make this protein a probable substrate for β-TrCP. Thus, SCFβ-TrCP might play an essential role in ER quality control by degrading misfolded proteins.It has been known for about a decade that cytoskeletal geometry plays a central role in activating intracellular signaling pathways that lead to cell cycle progression (34Chen C.S. Mrksich M. Huang S. Whitesides G.M. Ingber D.E. Science. 1997; 276: 1425-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4127) Google Scholar, 35Bohmer R.M. Scharf E. Assoian R.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Proper FN matrix assembly in turn specifies the organization of the cytoskeleton and thereby can regulate cell proliferation. It is also well known that exposure of cells to UV or γ-irradiation can cause arrest of cell proliferation. A major emphasis has been placed on DNA damage-activated G1, S, or G2 checkpoints as mechanisms for such arrest (36Niida H. Nakanishi M. Mutagenesis. 2006; 21: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Although only a few studies have addressed the effect of radiation on ECM rearrangements, such studies were able to demonstrate significant alterations on ECM gene expression and protein degradation upon irradiation (20Zhao W. O'Malley Y. Wei S. Robbins M.E. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 2000; 76: 391-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 21Cordes N. Meineke V. J. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2075239691,"Adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase-like protein 1 (AHCYL1) is a novel intracellular protein with ∼50% protein identity to adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (AHCY), an important enzyme for metabolizing S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine, the by-product of S-adenosyl-l-homomethionine-dependent methylation. AHCYL1 binds to the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor, suggesting that AHCYL1 is involved in intracellular calcium release. We identified two zebrafish AHCYL1 orthologs (zAHCYL1A and -B) by bioinformatics and reverse transcription-PCR. Unlike the ubiquitously present AHCY genes, AHCYL1 genes were only detected in segmented animals, and AHCYL1 proteins were highly conserved among species. Phylogenic analysis suggested that the AHCYL1 gene diverged early from AHCY and evolved independently. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR showed that zAHCYL1A and -B mRNA expression was regulated differently from the other AHCY-like protein zAHCYL2 and zAHCY during zebrafish embryogenesis. Injection of morpholino antisense oligonucleotides against zAHCYL1A and -B into zebrafish embryos inhibited zAHCYL1A and -B mRNA translation specifically and induced ventralized morphologies. Conversely, human and zebrafish AHCYL1A mRNA injection into zebrafish embryos induced dorsalized morphologies that were similar to those obtained by depleting intracellular calcium with thapsigargin. Human AHCY mRNA injection showed little effect on the embryos. These data suggest that AHCYL1 has a different function from AHCY and plays an important role in embryogenesis by modulating inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor function for the intracellular calcium release.

The hAH-CYL1 protein (∼60 kDa, 530 amino acids) consists of a novel N-terminal hydrophilic domain (106 amino acids) and a C-terminal domain (424 amino acids), which is homologous (51% protein identity) to the methylation pathway enzyme, AHCY (EC 3.3.1.1, ∼46 kDa). AHCY is the evolutionarily conserved and ubiquitously expressed enzyme that catalyzes the reversible hydrolysis of S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine, a byproduct of the S-adenosyl-l-homomethionine-dependent methyltransferase reaction, into adenosine and homocysteine using NAD+ as a cofactor (2Turner M.A. Yang X. Yin D. Kuczera K. Borchardt R.T. Howell P.L. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 33: 101-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Although AHCYL1 conserves the cysteines required for a tight globular structure of AHCY and the NAD+ binding motif, AHCYL1 lacks some binding sites for S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine, suggesting that AHCYL1 has a different function from AHCY. The N-terminal hydrophilic domain contains 79 polar or charged amino acids, including a cluster of Ser, Thr, and Tyr (potential phosphorylation sites), and this domain is likely to regulate AHCYL1 function (1Dekker J.W. Budhia S. Angel N.Z. Cooper B.J. Clark G.J. Hart D.N. Kato M. Immunogenetics. 2002; 53: 993-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). AHCYL1 is highly conserved among species, and the human and mouse orthologs have 100% protein identity, suggesting a highly conserved function yet to be understood. The other AHCY-like protein KIAA0828 (termed AHCYL2 hereafter) has similar gene and protein structure to those of AHCYL1, but again its function is unknown (1Dekker J.W. Budhia S. Angel N.Z.

In blood, hAHCYL1 mRNA was predominantly expressed in dendritic cells (DC), the most potent antigen-presenting cells for eliciting immune responses (4Hart D.N.J.

Increased hAH-CYL1 mRNA expression during DC differentiation and activation suggested that hAHCYL1 plays a role in DC differentiation and function (1Dekker J.W. Budhia S. Angel N.Z. Cooper B.J. Clark G.J. Hart D.N. Kato M. Immunogenetics. 2002; 53: 993-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, the UniGene data base analysis (UniGene cluster Hs.4113) and our multiple tissue expression array analysis 3B. J. Cooper, unpublished results.3B. J. Cooper, unpublished results. indicated that hAHCYL1 is also expressed in nonhematopoietic tissues, especially at high levels in neuronal and renal tissues. Recently, Ando et al. (6Ando H. Mizutani A. Matsu-ura T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10602-10612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) showed that AHCYL1 is identical to an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R)-binding protein (termed IP3R-binding protein released with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, or IRBIT). Binding of AHCYL1 to IP3R, an important regulator of intracellular Ca2+ release, is mediated by its N-terminal domain, and its phosphorylation appears to be essential for the AHCYL1 binding. Importantly, the AHCYL1 binding site on IP3R also mediates the IP3-IP3R interaction, suggesting that AHCYL1 regulates IP3 binding to the IP3R. The consequence of AHCYL1 interacting with the IP3R remains to be elucidated, but it is of significant interest given the important regulating role other molecules (and other signaling pathways) have on Ca2+ as a result of IP3R activation. To investigate the function of AHCYL1, we chose the zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a model organism for molecular genetic analysis. We describe the cDNA cloning and genomic organization of the zAHCYL1, compare them with those of hAHCYL1 and other AHCYL1 homologs, and demonstrate the effect of suppression and overexpression of AHCYL1 on zebrafish development. In Silico Cloning of zAHCYL1—Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) corresponding to zAHCYL1 were identified in the dbEST data base from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) by performing a BLASTn search using hAHCYL1 coding sequence as the query. Nine overlapping ESTs (GenBank™ accession numbers CA473816, BI473660, BI885096, CD284541, BI430354, BI884776, BI473380, CD594351, and BF937243) were compiled using Sequencher software (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, MI) to form a putative zAHCYL1 cDNA sequence. This sequence was used to design primers for cloning the full-length zAHCYL1 cDNA (described below). Exon/intron boundaries were determined via a zebrafish genomic BLAST search available from the Ensembl Zebrafish Genome Server. Identification of AHCYL1 in Other Species—AHCYL1 orthologs in other species were identified by tBLASTn searches using hAHCYL1 protein sequence for enquiry on the NCBI genomic or EST data bases. Searches were conducted in the following organisms (data base used is shown in parentheses): Anopheles gambiae (genome), Caenorhabditis elegans (genome), Drosophila melanogaster (genome), Takifugu rubripes (genome), Gallus gallus (EST), Plasmodium falciparum (genome), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (genome), Xenopus laevis (EST), and the microbial genome data base (completed genomes only). To confirm that output sequences were AHCYL family orthologs and not AHCY orthologs, the sequences were assessed for (i) N-terminal domain containing conserved Ser/Thr residues and (ii) alignment with the hAHCY protein using NCBI pairwise BLAST indicating less similarity to hAHCY than hAHCYL1. Phylogenic analysis was performed using the programs ClustalW for multiple sequence alignment and Protdist for computing the phylogenic tree and bootstrap values with 100 bootstrap cycles. Both programs are available on the Australian National Genomic Information Service Bioinformatics service (ANGIS; available on the World Wide Web at www.angis.org.au). The protein sequences included were AHCYL1 orthologs from human (GenBank™ accession number AF315687), zebrafish (GenBank™ accession number AY611473, this report), fugu fish (GenBank™ accession number BK005364; this report), and fruit fly (GenBank™ accession number NM_139489 and NM_206499); AHCYL2 orthologs from human (GenBank™ accession number NM_015328) and zebrafish (GenBank™ accession number NM_201340); and AHCY orthologs from human (GenBank™ accession number NM_000687), mouse (GenBank™ accession number BC086781), zebrafish (GenBank™ accession number BC044200), and fruit fly (GenBank™ accession number NM_078609). Prediction of Phosphorylation Sites and NAD+ Binding Domain—Potential Ser/Thr/Tyr phosphorylation sites in the AHCYL1 protein sequences were assessed using the program NetPhos 2.0 (7Blom N. Gammeltoft S. Brunak S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1351-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (2513) Google Scholar) on the ExPASy Molecular Biology server (available on the World Wide Web at au.expasy.org). The AHCY NAD+ binding region of the AHCYL1 proteins was defined using the Conserved Domain Database through NCBI. RT-PCR Cloning of zAHCYL1—Total RNA was isolated from adult zebrafish head extracted with Trizol (Invitrogen) and 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) for zAHCYL1 using the FirstChoice RLM RACE kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. First strand cDNA synthesis was carried out using 10 μg of the total RNA, and the primary PCR was performed using the outer adaptor primer (5′-GCTGATGGCGATGAATGAACACTG-3′) and the gene-specific outer primer MK279 (5′-GCTGAGCTGTAGCTGTCCGTA-3′, nucleotides 508–528 of zAHCYL1A) using AmpliTaq Gold (Applied Biosystems, Scoresby, Victoria, Australia). The primary PCR product was further amplified using the inner adaptor primer (5′-CGCGGATCCGAACACTGCGTTTGCTGGCTTTGATG-3′) and the gene-specific inner primer MK280 (5′-TCCTGTTTGTCCTCCTGGTT-3′, nucleotides 425–444 of zAHCYL1A) (see Fig. 1). The PCR was performed on a PTC 200 thermal cycler (MJ Research, Waltham, MA) with the following reaction cycle: 94 °C for 10 min; 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s; 72 °C for 10 min. Cloning of full-length zAHCYL1 coding sequence was performed using a Thermoscript RT-PCR system (Invitrogen). Briefly, 1 μg of total RNA from adult zebrafish head was subjected to first strand cDNA synthesis using oligo(dT)20 reverse primer. To obtain full-length zAHCYL1 coding regions, gene-specific primers nested to the zAHCYL1 5′- and 3′-untranslated region were synthesized: MK350 (5′-CGACAGCTTGTTCTCCTTCC-3′) and MK352 (5′-AAGAGCTCAGGCCAGACACA-3′), corresponding to exon 1 (nucleotides 58–77) and exon 2 (nucleotides 9–28), respectively, as the forward primers and MK351 (5′-AAGCCACACAGACATCCTTTTT-3′), corresponding to nucleotides 2288–2310, as the nested reverse primer. PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Annandale, New South Wales, Australia) for sequencing. Identification of Alternatively Spliced hACHYL1—Alternative N-terminal splicing of hAHCYL1 was identified in humans using the dbEST data base available from NCBI. In order to identify sequences of authentic splice variants, we searched for ESTs that (i) contained sequence that overlapped substantially with known hAHCYL1 cDNA and (ii) could be mapped to the chromosome band 1p12 for the hAHCYL1 gene (1Dekker J.W. Budhia S. Angel N.Z. Cooper B.J. Clark G.J. Hart D.N. Kato M. Immunogenetics. 2002; 53: 993-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA purified from zebrafish embryos at different stages of development (50–100 embryos/stage) using Trizol (Invitrogen) was treated with DNase I (Invitrogen) to remove contaminating genomic DNA and subjected to cDNA synthesis with random hexamers using Expand reverse transcriptase (Roche Applied Science). For quantitative RT-PCR analysis, the cDNA was combined with gene-specific forward and reverse primers for zAHCYL1A, zAHCYL1B, zAHCYL2, and zAHCY and a SYBR green master mix (QuantiTect SYBR PCR kit, Qiagen, Clifton Hill, Victoria, Australia) and subjected to real time PCR using a Rotorgene 3000 thermal cycler (Corbett Research, Mortlake, New South Wales, Australia). Zebrafish glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used for normalization of cDNA input. The primers were zAHCYL1A, MK279, and MK391 (5′-ACAGCGAGGTGAACATGAAC-3′); zAHCYL1B, MK279, and MK352; zAHCYL2, MK388 (5′-TCTTGGTGGGACGTTTGTTG-3′), and MK390 (5′-ACCGAGCCCCATGAAGAT-3′); and zebrafish GAPDH, MK293 (5′-CCCAATGTCTCTGTTGTGGA-3′), and MK294 (5′-CGTGTAGAGCAATACCAGCA-3′). The standard curves were generated using serially diluted gene-specific amplicons. The thermal cycling conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 15 min, 45 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 58 °C for 15 s and 72 °C for 30 s, followed by melting temperature analysis (72–99 °C with 1 °C increments). Data analysis was performed using Rotorgene 5.0 software (Corbett Research). The amplification was specific as judged by melting temperature analysis, agarose gel analysis, and DNA sequencing of the amplicons. The experiments were performed in duplicate and repeated at least twice. Production of Rabbit Anti-AHCYL1 Peptide Antibody—Rabbit polyclonal peptide antisera against the AHCYL1 C-terminal peptide were produced by immunizing New Zealand White rabbits with diphtheria toxoid-conjugated synthetic peptide CGPFKPNYYRY (Mimotopes, Clayton, Victoria, Australia) using a conventional schedule with Freund adjuvant at the Herston Medical Research Center (Herston, Queensland, Australia). The titer of the antibody against the peptide was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate (Maxsorb; Nalge Nunc, Rochester, NY) coated with streptavidin (Sigma) and biotinylated peptides for AHCYL1 (biotin-SGSGCGPFKPNYYRY). The antibody was purified with a series of affinity column chromatography using a HiTrap protein A and a HiTrap streptavidin (Amersham Biosciences) conjugated with the biotinylated C-terminal AHCYL1 peptide. The antibody reacted with both AHCYL1 and AHCY in Western blot analysis. Zebrafish Maintenance and Collection of Embryos—Zebrafish were maintained under standard conditions as described (8Westerfield M. The Zebrafish Book: Guide for the Laboratory Use of Zebrafish (Danio rerio).3rd Ed. University of Oregon Press, Eugene, OR1995Google Scholar) and used under the protocols approved by University of Queensland Animal Ethics Committee. Embryos were obtained from natural spawning of adult fish on a 14-h light/10-h dark cycle and were raised at 28 °C. Stages were determined by both hours postfertilization (hpf) and morphologic features (9Kimmel C.B. Ballard W.W. Kimmel S.R. Ullmann B. Schilling T.F. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 203: 253-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (8703) Google Scholar). Photographs were taken on a SPOT digital camera setup (Diagnostic Instruments Inc, Sterling Heights, MI) using a Leica S240 dissecting microscope equipped with an epifluorescent system. Morpholino Antisense Oligonucleotides against AHCYL1 for Microinjection—The morpholino antisense oligonucleotides MO1A (5′-TGGCATCCTCGCCACAGTCTGTCAT-3′) and MO1B (5′-CATGGTTCATGTTCCCTGTGTGTGT-3′) against zAHCYL1A and zAHCYL2 (see Fig. 1), and a standard control morpholino antisense oligonucleotide (5′-CCTCTTACCTCAGTTACAATTTATA-3′) were obtained from Gene Tools (Philomath, OR). Zebrafish embryos at the 1–2-cell stage were microinjected (0.5 nl/embryo) with the morpholino oligonucleotides (1, 0.5, or 0.2 mm) mixed with synthetic capped enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), E1/EGFP, or E2/EGFP mRNA (0.125 mg/ml, described below). Production of pCS2-hAHCYL1, pCS2-hAHCY, and pCS2-zAHCYL1 mRNA Synthesis Vectors—The cDNAs of human and zebrafish AHCYL1 and human AHCY cDNA, including 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions were cloned into the pCS2+ expression vector (10Rupp R.A. Snider L. Weintraub H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1311-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Briefly, hAHCYL1A sequence was excised from the clone 211(1)B (1Dekker J.W. Budhia S. Angel N.Z. Cooper B.J. Clark G.J. Hart D.N. Kato M. Immunogenetics. 2002; 53: 993-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) using XbaI and SacI, and ligated into the corresponding sites available in pCS2+ to generate pCS2-hAHCYL1A. The human AHCY cDNA was amplified using RT-PCR from pooled human cDNA (from monocyte-derived dendritic cells and cell lines (i.e. L428 and HL60)) using primers MK276 (5′-CGGCCCAGTTCCTGTTCC-3′) and MK277 (5′-GCTCATGGTTCCCTGTGG-3′) using a Taq polymerase (Roche Applied Science). The PCR product was cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector for sequence confirmation. The insert was excised with NotI and SpeI, NotI site-blunted, and subcloned into pCS2+ with blunted BamHI and SpeI sites. The zAHCYL1A sequence was derived from the pGEM-T Easy vector clone (described above) and cloned into pCS2+ using a strategy similar to that described for the human AHCY clone. All plasmids were linearized with NotI for in vitro mRNA synthesis. Production of pCS2-E1/EGFP and pCS2-E2/EGFP mRNA Synthesis Vectors—zAHCYL1 cDNAs encoded by the exon 1 and exon 2 were PCR-amplified with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using sets of primers MK350/MK380 (5′-GCACCATGGCCTCCTGGTTGGCAAACTGAA-3′, NcoI site underlined) for exon 1 and MK352/MK382 (5′-GCATCATGACCTCCTGGTTGGCAAACTGAA-3′, RcaI site underlined) for exon 2, respectively (see Fig. 1). The PCR products were cloned into pCS2+EGFP digested with SmaI/NcoI or SmaI/RsaI so that the cloned exons were in frame with EGFP. Capped mRNA Synthesis and Microinjection—Capped mRNA was synthesized using a SP6 mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). EGFP (an injection control) mRNA was prepared as described previously (10Rupp R.A. Snider L. Weintraub H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1311-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). RNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation and resuspended to a concentration at 1.5 mg/ml, and integrity was checked by formaldehyde denaturing gel electrophoresis. Zebrafish embryos at the 1–2-cell stage were microinjected (0.5 nl/embryo) with the synthesized mRNA (1 mg/ml) mixed with EGFP mRNA (0.125 mg/ml). Only EGFP-positive embryos were examined at 12–28 hpf and scored according to the severity of their morphological defects. Embryos injected with EGFP mRNA at 1.2 mg/ml were used as injection controls. Depletion of Intracellular Calcium Stores—Thapsigargin treatment of embryos was performed according to Westfall et al. (11Westfall T.A. Hjertos B. Slusarski D.C. Dev. Biol. 2003; 259: 380-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 5 mm thapsigargin (Sigma) stock solution was made in Me2SO. 32–64-cell stage embryos were incubated with 5 μm thapsigargin diluted in egg medium (8Westerfield M. The Zebrafish Book: Guide for the Laboratory Use of Zebrafish (Danio rerio).3rd Ed. University of Oregon Press, Eugene, OR1995Google Scholar). Me2SO-only incubations were used as a negative control. After a 1-h incubation, embryos were washed extensively in egg medium and incubated at 28 °C in embryo media until required. Western Blot Analysis—Zebrafish embryos (1–2-cell stage) were injected with synthetic hAHCYL1, zAHCYL1, or hAHCY mRNA (1.5 mg/ml) in combination with EGFP mRNA and incubated for 6 h. EGFP-positive embryos were harvested and lysed with 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete; Roche Applied Science), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), and 5 mm EDTA, and the lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration was determined by a BCA protein assay (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as standard. The lysate was aliquoted and stored at −70 °C until use. For positive controls, COS-7 cells in two 100-mm dishes were transfected with pCS2-hAHCYL1 or pCS2-hAHCY (5 μg/dish) using Fugene 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol and incubated for 48 h. The cells were lysed with the lysis buffer, and protein concentration was determined as above. The lysate from the zebrafish embryos (250 μg) and COS-7 cell transfectants (20 μg) was fractionated with a 4–12% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel (NuPAGE; Invitrogen) in reducing conditions and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PVDF-Plus, Osmonics, Westborough, MA). The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat skim milk, 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated sequentially with the rabbit anti-AHCYL1 peptide antibody (5 μg/ml) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000 dilution; Chemicon, Boronia, Victoria, Australia) and the signals detected with enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Cloning of zAHCYL1 and Its Genomic Organization—The AHCYL1 gene is highly conserved among species (e.g. 100% protein identity between human and mouse) (1Dekker J.W. Budhia S. Angel N.Z. Cooper B.J. Clark G.J. Hart D.N. Kato M. Immunogenetics. 2002; 53: 993-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To clone the zAHCYL1, we conducted a BLAST search using the coding sequence for hAHCYL1 cDNA (GenBank™ accession number AF315687) to search the NCBI zebrafish EST data base. The ESTs obtained were aligned to establish a consensus zAHCYL1 cDNA sequence, which was confirmed by RT-PCR and DNA sequencing. To determine the transcriptional start site on zAHCYL1 mRNA, we performed 5′-RACE analysis using primers nested in the 5′-zAHCYL1 cDNA in the adult zebrafish head-derived cDNA library. This resulted in two PCR products (∼450 and 250 bp) (Fig. 1A). Sequencing analysis revealed that these two products corresponded to two zAHCYL1 mRNA variants with mutually exclusive transcription start sites termed zAHCYL1A and zAHCYL1B (Fig. 1, B and C). The zAHCYL1A sequence corresponded to the zAHCYL1 sequence obtained by EST data base search and confirmed using RT-PCR (Fig. 1B). This was identified as the ortholog of hAHCYL1 (described below). The zAHCYL1B sequence contained a previously uncharacterized 46-bp alternative 5′-untranslated region plus an alternative coding sequence for the N-terminal 9 amino acids, assuming that the first ATG in the sequence is the initiation codon (Fig. 1C). These results suggested that at least two alternatively spliced variants of zAHCYL1 were present. To determine the full genomic structure of zAHCYL1A and -B, we performed a BLAST search of the Ensembl zebrafish genomic sequence data base. One BAC clone (GenBank™ accession number AL773601) contained all of the cDNA sequences, and we determined the intron-exon boundaries using the “GT-AG” splice site consensus by comparing the genomic sequence with these cDNA sequences. We found the zAHCYL1 gene consisted of 18 exons spanning 39 kb (Fig. 2A). The zAHCYL1A transcript was encoded by 17 exons (with exon 2 spliced out), and the last 15 exons encoded the AHCY-like domain, similar to hAHCYL1. The zAHCYL1B transcript is also encoded by 17 exons but uses exon 2, located 9.2 kb downstream of exon 1, as an alternative first exon. The putative zAHCYL1A protein (encoded by exons 1 and 3–18) consists of 554 amino acids with an N-terminal hydrophilic domain (130 amino acids; exons 1, 3, and 4) and an AHCY-like domain (424 amino acids; exons 4–18) (Fig. 2B). The putative initiation codon was identified by comparing the zAHCYL1 protein to that of T. rubripes AHCYL1 protein (assigned GenBank™ accession number BK005364). The zAHCYL1B protein (exons 2 and 3–18) consists of 500 amino acids with the N-terminal hydrophilic domain being only 76 amino acids (exons 2–4) (Fig. 2B). Its initiation codon was identified as the first methionine in exon 2. Next we investigated possible alternative usage of 5′ exons in hAHCYL1 (now termed hAHCYL1A). By carrying out an extensive analysis of human EST sequences, we identified two ESTs encoding previously uncharacterized, alternatively spliced hAHCYL1 mRNAs termed hAHCYL1B and -C (Fig. 2C). hAHCYL1B was represented by two ESTs (GenBank™ accession numbers T19009 and BI460083) encoded by two separate exons (i.e. exons 2 and 3) joined to exon 5 (Fig. 2C). hAHCYL1C was represented by three ESTs (GenBank™ accession numbers AU279527, AL036027, and BF930049), which contained another alternative exon 4 (Fig. 2C). These three newly identified exon sequences (exons 2–4) could be joined by proper intron/exon junctions to exon 5. However, the only putative initiation codon appeared in exon 5, suggesting that these exons encoded alternative 5′-untranslated regions for truncated hAHCYL1 proteins, which lacked nearly half of the N-terminal hydrophilic domain (Fig. 2D). AHCYL1 Protein Is Evolutionarily Conserved among Species—We used phylogenic analysis to assess the evolutional relationships between the orthologs of AHCYL1, AHCY, and the other member of the AHCY-like protein family in zebrafish, zAHCYL2 (GenBank™ accession number AAH5951), a possible ortholog of hAHCYL2 (GenBank™ accession number BC024325) (3Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Suyama M. Kikuno R. Hirosawa M. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1998; 5: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The AHCYL1 genes were distinguished from AHCY genes, suggesting that AHCYL1 diverged early from AHCY and evolved separately (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, both zebrafish and human AHCYL2 were more closely related to AHCYL1 than AHCY. Fruit fly AHCY-like proteins (CG9977 and AHCY89E), which also have an N-terminal hydrophilic domain and an AHCY-like domain, clustered with AHCYL1 and AHCYL2. The amino acid comparison between the human and zebrafish AHCYL1A proteins show 93% identity and 97% similarity, across the region encoded by human exons 5–20 and the zebrafish exons 3–18 (Fig. 3B). Comparison with additional AHCYL1A orthologs (from mouse, fugu fish, and fruit fly) confirmed that the AHCY-like domains, including the NAD+ binding domains (161 amino acids) were highly conserved in the AHCYL1 orthologs (Fig. 3B). In addition to highly conserved Cys, 27 predicted Ser/Thr/Tyr phosphorylation sites were conserved among all vertebrates analyzed, 16 of which were clustered in the N-terminal hydrophilic domain (Fig. 3B). The majority of these Ser/Thr/Thr residues were also conserved in the fruit fly AHCYL protein. The protein sequences encoded by exon 1 are highly diverse between species, with zAHCYL1 proteins being 24 amino acids longer than hAHCYL1 at the N terminus. These data suggest that Ser/Thr/Tyr phosphorylation and NAD+ binding are likely to play an important role in AHCYL1 function. zAHCYL1A and -B and zAHCYL2 mRNA Are Regulated during Embryogenesis—We investigated the expression of zAHCYL1A and −B, zAHCYL2 and zAHCY mRNA in developing zebrafish embryos by real time RT-PCR (Fig. 4). Zebrafish GAPDH was used to normalize the cDNA input. zAHCYL1A was first apparent at the shield stage of embr"
https://openalex.org/W2079196943,"During 3T3L1 adipogenesis there is a marked reduction in β-catenin and N-cadherin expression with a relatively small decrease in p120 catenin protein levels. Cell fractionation demonstrated a predominant decrease in the particulate (membrane-bound) pool of p120 catenin with little effect on the soluble pool, resulting in a large redistribution from the plasma membrane to the cytosol. Reexpression of p120 catenin inhibited constitutive (transferrin receptor) and regulated mannose 6-phosphate receptor and GLUT4 trafficking to the plasma membrane. The inhibition of membrane trafficking was specific for p120 catenin function as this could be rescued by co-expression of N-cadherin. Moreover, overexpression of a p120 catenin deletion mutant (p120Δ622–628) or splice variant (p120-4A), neither of which could regulate Rho or Rac activity, showed no significant effect. The inhibition of GLUT4 translocation was also observed upon the simultaneous expression of a constitutively active Rac mutant (Rac1/Val12) in combination with a dominant-interfering Rho mutant (RhoA/Asn19). This was recapitulated by expression of the Rho ADP-ribosylation factor (C3ADP) in combination with constitutively active Rac1/Val12. Moreover, siRNA-mediated knockdown of p120 catenin resulted in increased basal state accumulation of GLUT4 at the plasma membrane. Together, these data demonstrate that p120 catenin plays an important role in maintaining the basal tone of membrane protein trafficking in adipocytes through the dual regulation of Rho and Rac function and accounts for reports implicating Rho or Rac in the control of GLUT4 translocation.

More recently, studies have shown that p120 exists in three pools including the membrane-associated cadherin-bound pool, a cytoplasmic pool, and a nuclear pool (26Grosheva I. Shtutman M. Elbaum M.

Shuttle of p120 between cadherin-bound and cytoplasmic pools has been suggested to regulate the functional role of p120 catenin (31Anastasiadis P.Z. Reynolds A.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 604-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Thus, sequestration by the membrane-bound cadherins may provide a mechanism to buffer p120 catenin action on Rho GTPases in the cytosol. Based upon these considerations, we have found that during adipogenesis p120 catenin redistributes from a membrane-bound to a cytosolic pool concomitant with a reduction in cadherin expression. Moreover, the cytoplasmic pool of p120 catenin sets the basal state of membrane trafficking through the dual regulation of Rho and Rac function. Materials—p120 catenin and N-cadherin cDNA were cloned from 3T3L1 cDNA library by RT-PCR. p120Δ622–628 and the p120-4A splice variant were obtained as described previously (32Yanagisawa M.

Murine 3T3L1 pre-adipocytes were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection repository and differentiated as described previously (35Watson R.T. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1261-1268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). p120 and N-cadherin monoclonal antibodies were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories. Fluorescent secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Sigma. p120 siRNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Dharmacon. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection of 3T3L1 Adipocytes—Murine 3T3L1 pre-adipocytes were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 25 mm glucose and 10% calf serum at 37 °C with 8% CO2. Cells were differentiated into adipocytes with 1 μg/ml insulin, 1 μm dexamethasone, and 0.5 mm isobutyl-1-methylxanthine as described previously (35Watson R.T. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1261-1268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Differentiated adipocytes were electroporated using the Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad) with settings of 0.16 kV and 950 microfarads (36Min J. Okada S. Coker K. Ceresa B.P. Elmendorf J.S. Syu L.-J. Noda Y. Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 751-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Following electroporation, cells were plated on glass coverslips and allowed to recover for about 16–18 h. Then the cells were starved with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 2–3 h and stimulated with 100 nm insulin for 30 min. Immunofluorescence—Transfected adipocytes were fixed for 15 min in 4% paraformaldehyde containing 0.2% Triton X-100. Cells were then blocked in 5% donkey serum (Sigma) plus 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. Primary and secondary antibodies were used at 1:100 dilutions in blocking solution, and samples were mounted on glass slides with Vectashield (Vector Labs). Fluorescent images were acquired by confocal fluorescent microscopy (Zeiss LSM 510). siRNA-mediated p120 Knockdown in 3T3L1 Adipocytes—siRNA-mediated knockdown of p120 was performed using a double strand siRNA oligonucleotide as described previously (37Davis M.A. Ireton R.C. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 525-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 nmol of p120 siRNA oligonucleotide or random oligonucleotide was electroporated into 3T3L1 adipocytes (170 V, 950 microfarads). Under these conditions, more than 95% of the adipocyte population was positive of siRNA uptake, and cell lysates were collected at various times as indicated in the legend to Fig. 6. Cell Fractionation and Immunoblotting—Differentiated 3T3L1 adipocytes were starved in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 2–3 h, and then treated with or without 100 nm insulin for 30 min. Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and collected in 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors, and the cells were passed 10 times through a 22-gauge needle. The homogenized cells were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The protein content of the supernatant (cytosolic protein) and the pellet (membrane protein) was quantified using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Equal protein amounts (50 μg) from each of the fractions were loaded onto 4–15% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels, subjected to electrophoresis, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and immunoblotted with monoclonal antibodies directed against p120, N-cadherin, and β-catenin, respectively. RT-PCR—RNA was isolated, using the Micro-FastTrack 2.0 kit (Invitrogen), from murine 3T3L1 pre-adipocytes and differentiated adipocytes (4, 8, and 12 days after addition of differentiation medium). First strand cDNAs were synthesized from mRNAs with oligo(dT)18 primer using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD Biosciences). The cDNAs were then used as templates for PCR with primers specific for N-cadherin (forward, 5′-AAGTGCCATTAGCTAAAGGCATTCA-3′, and reverse, 5′-CTTTTAATAGTCACTGGAGATAAGGG-3′), OB-cadherin (forward, 5′-ACATTGATCCGAAGTTCATCAGCAAT-3′, and reverse, 5′-GTTTGGGTTGTGCATGATTTCAGG-3′), and H,T-cadherin (forward, 5′-AGGACCCACTGGTACCCGACGT-3′ and reverse, 5′-CTTTATCAGGGACTGTCTGTTTATGA-3′). The PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis for quantity and size determination. Regulation of N-cadherin, β-Catenin, and p120 Catenin during Adipogenesis—It is well established that β-catenin is a suppressor of adipocyte differentiation, and consistent with previous studies (38Ross S.E.

In parallel, there was also a marked reduction in the expression of the cell surface adhesion receptor, N-cadherin (Fig. 1B, lanes 1–4). However, although p120 catenin could directly bind to N-cadherin, there was only a modest reduction in the expression of p120 catenin (Fig. 1A, lanes 1–4). Because p120 catenin can also bind to other cadherin family members, we examined the differentiation-dependent expression of several other cadherins by RT-PCR. PCR screening of 14 different cadherin family members demonstrated that 3T3L1 fibroblasts only expressed N-, OB-, and HT-cadherins (data not shown). Consistent with the immunoblotting data, N-cadherin mRNA was relatively abundant in predifferentiated adipocytes and was markedly down-regulated during the initiation of 3T3L1 adipogenesis (Fig. 2). Similarly, OB- and HT-cadherin mRNAs were down-regulated following differentiation.FIGURE 2Expression of N-cadherin, OB-cadherin, and HT-cadherin mRNAs during 3T3L1 adipogenesis. 3T3L1 cells were induced to differentiate as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Total cell mRNA extracts were collected either right before differentiation (lanes 1, 5, and 9) or after 4 (lanes 2, 6, and 10), 8 (lanes 3, 7, and 11), or 12 (lanes 4, 8, and 12) days of differentiation. Equal amounts of total RNA were subjected to RT-PCR and agarose gel electrophoresis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Despite the large reduction in cadherin mRNA and N-cadherin protein levels, p120 catenin protein expression was only marginally decreased in differentiated adipocytes compared with pre-adipocytes (Fig. 1). We therefore examined the membrane versus cytosolic distribution of p120 catenin, N-cadherin, and β-catenin during adipogenesis (Fig. 3). In pre-adipocytes, p120 catenin, N-cadherin, and β-catenin were primarily found in the particulate (membrane) fraction with substantially reduced amounts in the cytosolic fraction. As observed in the whole cell extracts, when the cells differentiated into adipocyte phenotypes, there was a dramatic reduction in N-cadherin and β-catenin protein levels in both the membrane and cytosolic fractions (Fig. 3, B and C). In contrast, p120 catenin was predominantly decreased in the membrane fraction with only a minor reduction in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 3A). These resulted in a difference in the ratio of particulate:cytosolic p120 catenin from approximately 6:1 to 0.8:1. The developmental changes in p120 catenin distribution were unaffected by insulin stimulation. p120 Catenin Expression Inhibits Plasma Membrane Trafficking in Adipocytes—Previous studies have suggested that p120 catenin may function to regulate intracellular trafficking pathways (24Anastasiadis P.Z.

To first assess the effect of p120 catenin on adipocyte membrane trafficking, we overexpressed p120 catenin with the constitutive recycling membrane receptor protein, the transferrin receptor (Fig. 4A). Following 24 h of expression, a substantial portion of the expressed transferrin receptor was localized to the plasma membrane. However, in the presence of p120 catenin, there was a dramatic reduction in the amount of cell surface localized transferrin receptor. The mannose 6-phosphate receptor (MPR) primarily recycles between the trans-Golgi network and late endosomes but can undergo an insulin-stimulated translocation to the plasma membrane in adipocytes (43Kandror K.V. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21703-21708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 44Martin S. Millar C.A. Lyttle C.T. Meerloo T. Marsh B.J. Gould G.W. James D.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3427-3438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The insulin-stimulated translocation was readily apparent in cells transfected with an MPR-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion construct (Fig. 4B). Although expression of p120 catenin had no effect on the very low basal state MPR-GFP localization to the plasma membrane, there was a marked inhibition of the insulin-stimulated translocation. Similarly, insulin is a potent stimulator of GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane, and this was also inhibited by the expression of p120 catenin (Fig. 4C). Together, these data demonstrate that high levels of p120 catenin reduce both constitutive (transferrin receptor) and hormone-regulated (MPR and GLUT4) trafficking to the plasma membrane. To determine whether the inhibitory effect was specific to the unbound form of p120 catenin, we next examined the ability of overexpressed N-cadherin to reverse the inhibitory property of overexpressed p120 catenin on the trafficking of the GLUT4 reporter (Fig. 5). As is apparent, co-expression of N-cadherin increased the basal trafficking of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane without any significant effect on the insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4. N-cadherin expression also prevented the inhibitory action of p120 catenin on insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. Similarly, a p120 catenin deletion mutant (p120Δ622–628) and splice variant (p120-4A) that cannot regulate Rho or Rac activity, respectively, were completely devoid of any inhibitory function with respect to insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. To further confirm the functional role of the endogenous p120 catenin protein, we utilized siRNA to specifically reduce p120 catenin protein levels (Fig. 6A). Transfection of fully differentiated 3T3L1 adipocytes with a p120 catenin siRNA resulted in a time-dependent reduction in p120 catenin protein levels (Fig. 6A, lanes 1, 4, and 7) compared with mock-transfected (lanes 2, 5, and 8) and random (lanes 3, 6, and 9) siRNA-transfected cells. The total p120 catenin protein levels were reduced by 80 and 90% between 48 and 96 h post-siRNA transfection, respectively. Having established an efficient protocol to reduce p120 catenin expression, we then co-transfected the adipocytes with GLUT4 and p120 catenin siRNA and determined the extent of basal and insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation (Fig. 6, B–D). Twenty-four hours after siRNA expression, p120 catenin protein levels were reduced by ∼50% with no significant effect on GLUT4 trafficking to the plasma membrane (Fig. 6B). In contrast, by 48 and 72 h when p120 catenin levels were decreased ∼80 and 90%, respectively, there was a concomitant increase in the basal state accumulation of GLUT4 at the plasma membrane. This occurred without any effect on insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation and was also not observed in the mock or random siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 6, C and D). These data confirm that the level of p120 catenin functions as a basal state repressor of adipocyte membrane trafficking. p120 Catenin Inhibits Membrane Trafficking through Dual Regulation of Rho and Rac—Rho and Rac family members of small GTP-binding proteins play central roles in the control of actin polymerization, and it has recently been reported that p120 catenin can function to activate Rac1 and inhibit RhoA (24Anastasiadis P.Z. Moon S.Y. Thoreson M.A. Mariner D.J. Crawford H.C. Zheng Y. Reynolds A.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Because the p120Δ622–628 deletion mutant and p120-4A splice variant were unable to affect membrane GLUT4 translocation (Fig. 5), we next assessed the potential role of Rho and Rac proteins in adipocyte membrane trafficking (Fig. 7). As observed previously, expression of p120 catenin inhibited insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. In comparison, expression of either the dominant-interfering Rac1 (Rac1/Asn17) or RhoA (RhoA/Asn19) mutants had no significant effect on GLUT4 translocation. Although expression of the constitutively active Rac1 (Rac1/Val12) and RhoA (RhoA/Val14) mutants partially increased basal GLUT4 translocation, there was no significant effect on insulin-stimulated translocation. In contrast, co-expression of active Rac1/Val12 with dominant-interfering RhoA/Asn19, a combination that simulates the function of p120, recapitulated the inhibition of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. The converse experiment, co-expression of inactive Rac1/Asn17 with active RhoA/Val14, increased the basal state translocation of GLUT4 without affecting insulin-stimulated translocation. Moreover, although expression of the RhoA ADP-ribosylation inhibitor (C3ADP) alone had no effect, co-expression of C3ADP with active Rac1/Val12 also inhibited insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. Together, these data are fully consistent with the soluble pool of p120 catenin functioning to activate Rac and inhibit Rho as the responsible targets mediating p120 catenin inhibition of adipocyte membrane trafficking. In the basal state, the GLUT4 protein is predominantly localized to as yet undefined intracellular compartments probably through a dynamic retention mechanism that continually retrieves intracellular GLUT4 vesicles (45Karylowski O. Zeigerer A. Cohen A. McGraw T.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 870-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 46Bogan J.S. Hendon N. McKee A.E. Tsao T.S. Lodish H.F.

Insulin stimulation results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of various effectors and signaling proteins leading to an enhanced rate of GLUT4 exocytosis, thereby increasing the steady-state distribution in the plasma membrane (47Chunqiu Hou J.

This is thought to occur through an insulin-stimulated trafficking of GLUT4 from a sequestered compartment into the constitutively recycling endosome system. Although the pathways utilized by insulin to stimulate GLUT4 exocytosis have been intensively investigated, the mechanisms responsible for basal retention have been poorly studied. In particular, another insulin-regulated protein, IRAP (insulin-responsive aminopeptidase), is expressed in pre-adipocytes and during adipogenesis becomes sequestered into the same intracellular compartments as GLUT4 (52Martin S. Rice J.E. Gould G.W. Keller S.R. Slot J.W. James D.E. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2281-2291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 53Kandror K. Pilch P.F. J. Biol.

Commun. 1997; 239: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In addition to the specialized insulin-responsive compartment, adipocytes also display an insulin-responsive plasma membrane translocation of classical constitutive trafficking endosomal proteins such as the transferrin receptor and the MPR, albeit to a reduced extent (56Oka Y. Rozek L.M. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9435-9442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 57Tanner L.I. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol.

Thus, during adipogenesis, a mechanism must be initiated that results in a reduction of the basal plasma membrane trafficking for at least several basal recycling proteins. Several studies have implicated the actin cytoskeleton in the regulation of membrane trafficking (6Kanzaki M. Pessin J.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 509-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). During adipogenesis, polymerized actin converts from primarily a stress fiber organization to a strong cortical actin network that appears to control both constitutive and insulin-regulated membrane trafficking (59Kanzaki M. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25867-25869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Rho and Rac family members of small GTP-binding proteins play central roles in the control of actin polymerization, and it has recently been reported that p120 catenin can function to activate Rac1 and inhibit RhoA (24Anastasiadis P.Z. Moon S.Y. Thoreson M.A. Mariner D.J. Crawford H.C. Zheng Y. Reynolds A.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Based upon the essential requirement of filamentous actin in adipocyte trafficking events, we examined the effect of various agents known to regulate filamentous actin organization. In this regard, we observed that p120 catenin appears to play an important role in maintaining a low basal rate of membrane transport in adipocytes. This was based upon p120 overexpression that inhibited the plasma membrane trafficking of the transferrin receptor, MPR and GLUT4. Moreover, p120 catenin knockdown induced an increased distribution of GLUT4 to the cell surface consistent with p120 functioning as a critical component setting the basal rate of exocytosis. During adipogenesis the amount of membrane-bound p120 catenin was markedly reduced, whereas the cytosolic p120 catenin levels remained relatively constant. Thus, the portion of cytosolic/membrane p120 catenin levels markedly increased in fully differentiated adipocytes compared with pre-adipocytes. This apparently resulted from a down-regulation of the membrane cadherin proteins directing p120 catenin to the plasma membrane and suggests that in adipocytes the relative redistribution of p120 was responsible for alteration in function. Consistent with this interpretation, reexpression of N-cadherin increased basal state plasma membrane trafficking consistent with a redistribution of p120 from the cytosol back to a membrane-bound form. Interestingly, in epithelial cells the loss of p120 catenin expression appears to be responsible for the stability of cadherin (37Davis M.A. Ireton R.C. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 525-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 60Ireton R.C. Davis M.A. van Hengel J. Mariner D.J. Barnes K. Thoreson M.A. Anastasiadis P.Z. Matrisian L. Bundy L.M. Sealy L. Gilbert B. van Roy F. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 465-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Because adipocytes are relatively nonadherent, it is not surprising that there is a marked decrease in the expression of cadherin cell surface adhesion proteins. Whether or not the decrease in cadherin expression during adipogenesis was a cause or consequence of changes in p120 catenin levels, only the membrane-bound form of p120 catenin was affected. Nevertheless, our data are fully consistent with the cytosolic pool of p120 catenin adipocyte reducing membrane trafficking as retargeting of the cytosolic p120 catenin to the plasma membrane prevented its inhibitory effect. In any case, the ability of p120 catenin to modulate membrane trafficking is apparently because of its ability to confer a dual regulation of both Rho and Rac. Recently, the cytosolic form of p120 catenin was found to activate Rac1 concomitant with an inhibition of RhoA (24Anastasiadis P.Z. Moon S.Y. Thoreson M.A. Mariner D.J. Crawford H.C. Zheng Y. Reynolds A.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Although the specific molecular mechanism(s) accounting for this coordinated dual regulation is not established, we could fully recapitulate the inhibitory action of p120 catenin by the co-expression of an active Rac1 and inactive RhoA mutants. Importantly, neither the individual Rac1 and RhoA mutants nor co-expression of inactive Rac1 with active RhoA was inhibitory. Moreover, inhibition of endogenous RhoA with C3ADP was also without effect, however, in the presence of active Rac1 again resulted in an inhibition of membrane translocation. Thus, these data demonstrate that the underlying steady-state rate of adipocyte membrane trafficking is set by the extent of cytosolic p120 catenin protein through the dual regulation of Rac and Rho. In this regard, numerous studies have established that both Rho and Rac play fundamental roles in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton (6Kanzaki M. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42436-42444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 22JeBailey L. Rudich A. Huang X. Di Ciano-Oliveira C. Kapus A. Klip A. Mol.

In particular, Rho is generally thought to control stress fiber filamentous actin, whereas Rac appears to regulate actin-based membrane ruffling at the leading edge of cells (62Ridley A.J.

In pre-adipocytes, filamentous actin is primarily organized into stress fibers, whereas during adipogenesis it converts to a cortical form of filamentous actin beneath the plasma membrane (59Kanzaki M.

In addition, several studies have previously shown that insulin induces actin ruffling and that inhibition of actin polymerization has a dramatic effect on adipocyte GLUT4 trafficking (6Kanzaki M.

Thus, it is likely that p120 catenin exerts its effect on adipocyte membrane protein trafficking through modulation of actin organization via the dual regulation of Rho and Rac function.

However, the relationship between the structural changes linked to ATP hydrolysis and the functional properties of actin is not understood. Labeling of actin Cys374 by tetramethylrhodamine (TMR) has been reported to make actin non-polymerizable and enabled the crystal structures of ADP-actin and 5′-adenylyl β,γ-imidodiphosphate-actin to be solved. TMR-actin has also been used to solve the structure of actin in complex with the formin homology 2 domain of mammalian Dia1. To understand how the covalent modification of actin by TMR may affect the structural changes linked to ATP hydrolysis and to evaluate the functional relevance of crystal structures of TMR-actin in complex with actin-binding proteins, we have analyzed the assembly properties of TMR-actin and its interaction with regulatory proteins.

The critical concentrations for assembly of TMR-actin in ATP and ADP were only an order of magnitude higher than those for unlabeled actin. The functional interactions of actin with capping proteins, formin, actin-depolymerizing factor/cofilin, and the VCA-Arp2/3 filament branching machinery were profoundly altered by TMR labeling.

The regulated dynamics of actin assembly plays a pivotal role in cell motility. The hydrolysis of actin-bound ATP that accompanies actin polymerization is at the origin of treadmilling, which powers actin-based motility processes. Hydrolysis of ATP destabilizes actin-actin interactions in the filament and affects the structure of actin enough to specify the recognition of ATP- and ADP-actin by different regulatory proteins, yet the nature of the structural change that supports the functional importance of this reaction in actin following ATP hydrolysis remains a debated issue. Crystallographic data indicate that the nucleotide-binding cleft of actin can be in an open or closed state; however, the open and closed states do not appear to logically correlate with the bound nucleotide being ADP (1Kabsch W.

Reconstructions of actin filaments indicate that the structure of ADP-F-actin is more consistent with the open state of actin (10Belmont L.D. Orlova A. Drubin D.G. Egelman E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The crystal structure of actin in complex with ciboulot, a Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome homology 2 (WH2) 2The abbreviations used are: WH2, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome homology 2; TMR, tetramethylrhodamine; AMPPNP, 5′-adenylyl β,γ-imidodiphosphate; ADF, actin-depolymerizing factor; FH2, formin homology 2; WASP, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein. domain/β-thymosin repeat-containing protein that, like β-thymosin, specifically binds ATP-actin, shows that it is only in the closed state of actin that the conformation of the shear zone of actin between subdomains 1 and 3 allows the binding of WH2 domains (3Hertzog M. van Heijenoort C.

These two studies (3Hertzog M. van Heijenoort C. Didry D. Gaudier M. Coutant J. Gigant B. Didelot G. Preat T. Knossow M. Guittet E. Carlier M.-F.

A. 1999; 96: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) suggest that ATP-actin has a closed conformation, that ADP-actin has an open conformation, and that proteins that specifically bind ATP-actin maintain the closed conformation even though ATP has been hydrolyzed into ADP in the crystal. In contrast with these conclusions, uncomplexed tetramethylrhodamine (TMR)-labeled actin harbors a closed structure in both the ADP- and AMPPNP-bound states; in addition, actin subdomain 2 adopts a novel helical fold in the ADP-bound state, whereas it displays the conventional disordered fold in the AMPPNP-bound state (2Otterbein L.R. Graceffa P. Dominguez R. Science. 2001; 293: 708-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 8Graceffa P. Dominguez R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34172-34180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that the structural change in subdomain 2 is linked to ATP hydrolysis and is responsible for the weakening of longitudinal actinactin bonds in the filament. This proposed structural effect of ATP hydrolysis was then questioned because the TMR probe, which locates at the shear zone linking subdomains 1 and 3 at the barbed face of actin, may interfere with the structural changes linked to the binding of ATP or ADP to unlabeled, fully functional actin (12Egelman E.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 735-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Caution is required when trying to understand the functional properties of actin from the different crystal structures known. First, crystal packing may introduce a bias favoring one of many structures that may exist in dynamic equilibrium in solution. To make things worse, if all these structures are energetically very similar, the structure favored by crystallization may not be the one that tends to predominate in solution upon binding a ligand like ATP or ADP. Second, crystal structures of actin are obtained by preventing actin polymerization by association with a polymerization-inhibiting protein or drug, by chemical modification, or by mutation. In all cases, the actin that is crystallized has lost its major functional property, which is to polymerize in filaments and to hydrolyze ATP upon assembly in filaments. Because actin is an efficient ATPase in the polymerized state only, the fact that TMR labeling renders actin unable to polymerize does not facilitate the correlation between the structural and functional properties of ADP- and ATP-actin. To clarify these issues, a biochemical analysis of TMR-actin was carried out (13Kudryashov D.S. Reisler E. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 2466-2475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Nucleotide exchange is slower on TMR-actin than on unmodified actin, consistent with the permanently closed structure of TMR-actin. The susceptibility of the DNase I-binding loop to proteolytic cleavage is similarly affected for TMR-actin and unmodified actin by the nature of the bound nucleotide, supporting the view that a structural change in labeled as well as unlabeled actin (presumably the disordered-to-ordered transition of subdomain 2) accompanies the replacement of ATP by ADP. On the other hand, solution studies of actin and TMR-actin proved unsuitable to distinguish the open and closed structures. Earlier works using partially labeled TMR-actin had established that TMR-actin copolymerizes with unlabeled actin (14Tait J.F. Frieden C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 216: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 15Sase I. Miyata H. Corrie J.E.T. Craik J.S. Kinosita Jr., K. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 323-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), thus enabling monitoring of actin dynamics in live cells by microinjecting trace amounts of TMR-actin (16Wang Y.L. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 597-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Recent work further showed that unpolymerizable TMR-actin causes destabilization of standard actin filaments upon copolymerization (17Kudryashov D.S. Phillips M. Reisler E. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 1136-1145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 18Orlova A. Shvetsov A. Galkin V.E. Kudryashov D.S. Rubenstein P.A. Egelman E.H. Reisler E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17664-17668Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). A detailed analysis of the structure-function relationship of 100% labeled TMR-actin and its interactions with several actin-binding proteins is carried out here. We show that TMR-actin polymerizes, with a 30-fold higher critical concentration than unlabeled actin, into very short filaments that are destabilized by ATP hydrolysis. The filament structure, the assembly dynamics, and the functional interactions of actin with regulatory proteins are profoundly affected by TMR labeling. The binding of capping proteins and formin to barbed ends of TMR-F-actin was weakened by 2 orders of magnitude. Actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF), which destabilizes standard filaments, had the opposite stabilizing effect on TMR-F-actin, decreasing its critical concentration. TMR-actin failed to form branched filaments with VCA (verplorin/cofilin/acidic) and the Arp2/3 complex, consistent with an impaired functional interaction of the WH2 domain of VCA with G-actin. These results provide insight into the structural features of actin at the origin of its assembly properties and its interaction with regulators. The results have important bearings in evaluating the functional relevance of the structures of TMR-actin in complex with proteins that control filament assembly at barbed ends, including formins (19Otomo T. Tomchick D.R. Otomo C. Panchal S.C. Machius M. Rosen M.K. Nature. 2005; 433: 488-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), and in interpreting real-time observations of the dynamics of individual actin filaments using TMR-actin (20Amann K.J. Pollard T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15009-15013Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 21Fujiwara I. Takahashi S. Tadakuma H. Funatsu T. Ishiwata S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 666-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Proteins—Actin was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle and isolated in the monomeric CaATP-G-actin form by gel filtration chromatography on Superdex 300 in buffer A (5 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.8), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, and 0.01% NaN3). Actin was pyrenyl-labeled (22Carlier M.-F. Pantaloni D. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6565-6571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TMR labeling of actin was carried out at a concentration of 50-70 μm G-actin in 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 0.2 mm ATP with overnight incubation at 0 °C in the dark in the presence of 3 molar equivalents of TMR-maleimide (Molecular Probes). Following arrest of the reaction and gel filtration of the adduct in buffer A, the extent of labeling was determined using an extinction coefficient of 106,000 m-1 cm-1 at 557 nm for rhodamine combined with the Bradford assay (50Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (218585) Google Scholar) for actin using unlabeled actin as a standard. The TMR/actin molar ratio was 0.9 to 1.2 (data from 24 independent experiments). The solution of TMR-G-actin was stored on ice and used within 1 week. Different batches of labeled material gave identical values of the critical concentration and parameters of interaction with regulatory proteins. This work was performed with 22 different batches of TMR-actin, and each experiment was reproduced at least three times. Spectrin-actin seeds were prepared from human erythrocytes (23Casella J.F. Barron-Casella E.A. Torres M.A. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 30: 164-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The His-tagged recombinant formin homology 2 (FH2) domain of mammalian Dia1 was expressed and purified as described (24Romero S. Le Clainche C. Didry D. Egile C. Pantaloni D. Carlier M.-F. Cell. 2004; 119: 419-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Recombinant human gelsolin, human ADF, thymosin β4, and the VCA domain of human neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) were bacterially expressed and purified (25Egile C. Loisel T.P. Laurent V. Li R. Pantaloni D. Sansonetti P.J. Carlier M.-F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1319-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). The Arp2/3 complex was purified from bovine brain (25Egile C. Loisel T.P. Laurent V. Li R. Pantaloni D. Sansonetti P.J. Carlier M.-F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1319-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Electron Microscopy—Negatively stained samples of filaments of TMR-actin polymerized at 7 μm were observed under a JEOL JEM-2100F UHR microscope at 50,000-fold magnification. Actin Polymerization Assays—Unlabeled or TMR-labeled actin was traced with 0.2% pyrenyl-labeled actin. Actin assembly was monitored by following the increase in pyrene fluorescence using a SPEX Fluorolog-2 spectrofluorometer. Sedimentation assays were performed by centrifuging samples of polymerized actin for 30 min at 400,000 × g in a Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge. Supernatants and resuspended pellets were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. ATP Hydrolysis Measurements—The G-actin solution in buffer A was equilibrated with [γ-32P]ATP. The cleavage of ATP was monitored by measuring acid-labile 32Pi (26Carlier M.-F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Melki R. Didry D. Xia G.-X. Hong Y. Chua N.-H. Pantaloni D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Polymerization was monitored in the spectrofluorometer, and aliquots were removed at time intervals and placed in an acid quench solution containing ammonium molybdate. The water-insoluble phosphomolybdate complex was extracted, and 32Pi radioactivity was measured in a scintillation counter. Actin Polymerization Modeling—Polymerization of TMR-actin at different concentrations was modeled using Berkeley Madonna software. The following scheme and derived set of differential equations were used, where A is ATP-G-actin, F is the filament ends, and Aadp is ADP-G-actin: Step 1, A + A → F (nucleation); Step 2, F + A ⇔ F (growth-depolymerization); Step 3, F ⇔ 2F (fragmentation-reannealing); Step 4, F + Aadp ⇔ F (growth-depolymerization of ADP-actin); and Step 5, Aadp → A (nucleotide exchange). The following values of the rate constants corresponding to Steps 1-5 were used to obtain a satisfactory fit of experimental spontaneous assembly curves recorded over an order of magnitude span in TMR-actin concentrations. Kif and Kir refer to the forward and reverse rate constants for Step i. Nucleation is a slow, thermodynamically unfavorable step and, for simplicity, is represented as a single slow irreversible reaction of rate constant K1f. (The reverse reaction was assumed to be extremely slow compared with the rate of assembly.) The modeled curves were unchanged if a reverse reaction (dimer dissociation) with a rate constant as high as 4 × 10-3 s-1 was included because the dimer has a higher probability to elongate than to dissociate at the range of actin concentrations investigated. K1f = 4.0 10-8 μm-1 s-1; critical concentration (Cc) = 0.5 μm; K2f = 0.6 μm-1 s-1; K2r = K2fCc; K3f = K3i((A0 - Atotal)/(F))1/2; K3r = 0.088 μm-1 s-1; Ccd = 30 (where Ccd is the critical concentration for assembly of ADP-TMR-actin); K4f = 0.03 μm-1 s-1; K4r = K4fCcd; and K5f = 0.1 s-1. It was found that the fragmentation rate constant K3f varied with the square root of the average length of the filaments that presented an exponential length distribution: K3f = K3i(A0 - Atotal)/(F)1/2, where F is the concentration of filaments. The concentration of total actin was A0. The concentration of unassembled actin was Atotal = A + Aadp. The concentration of assembled actin was Pol = A0 - Atotal. The observed fluorescence was computed as follows: F = f0 + (A0 - Atotal)·f(F) + A·f(A) + Aadp·f(Aadp), where f0 is the fluorescence signal for buffer alone, f(F), f(A), and f(Aadp) are the specific fluorescence of F-actin, ATP-G-actin, and ADP-G-actin, respectively. The values of K1f, K3i, K3r, and K4f were adjusted to provide the best fit to the data, whereas the values of all other parameters were experimental values that introduced a constraint. The global fit for all curves was performed step by step by first adjusting the parameters for each curve individually. Then, the best fit values of a given parameter were averaged over all the curves, and the average value was taken as a constraint in the subsequent fit of all curves individually. The cycle was repeated for the next parameter. The first parameter to be adjusted was the one that displayed the smallest S.D. Analysis of Filament Assembly from TMR-actin—G-actin was labeled with TMR-maleimide as described (2Otterbein L.R. Graceffa P. Dominguez R. Science. 2001; 293: 708-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 8Graceffa P. Dominguez R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34172-34180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The extent of labeling was 1 ± 0.1 mol of TMR/actin, in agreement with the previous reports. As reported, after 1 night of incubation in the presence of salt at physiological concentration, 90% of the TMR-actin was essentially found in the supernatant when it was centrifuged. However, two puzzling observations were made. First, much less TMR-actin (typically 10 μm, i.e. 25% of the total actin) was found in the supernatant after 15 min of polymerization than after 18 h. Second, when TMR-F-actin was centrifuged after 1 night of incubation under physiological ionic conditions, the supernatant, once re-equilibrated in buffer A by gel filtration, was again able to polymerize. To elucidate the processes that underlie these puzzling observations, the ability of TMR-actin to polymerize was assayed by monitoring the change in fluorescence of pyrenylactin added at a very low percentage (0.1-0.2%) to TMR-actin. The polymerization of TMR-actin was characterized by a very slow nucleation process, followed by a rapid explosive polymerization with an overshoot and partial depolymerization to a lower steady-state fluorescence (Fig. 1A). The final value of pyrenyl-actin fluorescence was much lower than that of unlabeled actin fluorescence. The polymerization time courses obtained with different percentages of pyrenyl-actin (0.1-2%) superimposed when they were normalized (Fig. 1B), confirming that pyrenyl-actin traces the actual polymerization process of TMR-actin. To understand the very slow nucleation of TMR-actin, TMR-actin was polymerized at different concentrations (Fig. 1C), and the dependence of the lag time (defined as the time at which the fluorescence increase reached 5% of the maximum increase) on TMR-actin concentration was plotted as a log/log representation. The slope of the straight line equals N/2, where N is the size of the nucleus, for a nucleation-growth mechanism (27Oosawa F. Asakura T. Thermodynamics of the Polymerization of Protein. Academic Press, New York1975: 47-51Google Scholar, 28Ross P.D. Hofrichter J. Eaton W.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 96: 239-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The value of the slope was 1.0, indicating that the nucleus is a dimer. In contrast, the nucleus for standard actin filaments is a trimer (29Tobacman L.S. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3207-3214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Holmes K.C. Popp D. Gebhard W. Kabsch W. Nature. 1990; 347: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1328) Google Scholar). The overshoot polymerization of TMR-actin strikingly resembles the kinetics of ATP-actin polymerization under sustained fragmentation (22Carlier M.-F. Pantaloni D. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6565-6571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in which filaments grow at a constant average length, and filament number increases in proportion to polymer mass. As a consequence of ATP hydrolysis and exposure of ADP-actin subunits at filament ends, it was shown that partial depolymerization occurs because ADP-actin polymerizes at a high critical concentration, and the exchange of ATP for bound ADP on TMR-G-actin is not very fast. Notably, addition of a low amount of TMR-actin to unlabeled actin induces an acceleration of the polymerization process and shortening of the filament length, also suggesting a severing effect of TMR-actin upon incorporation in a standard filament (17Kudryashov D.S. Phillips M. Reisler E. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 1136-1145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The view that the overshoot results from the partial depolymerization of TMR-F-actin following ATP hydrolysis was challenged as follows. TMR-actin was polymerized in the presence of BeF3-, a structural analog of Pi that binds to the site of the γ-phosphate of ATP immediately following release of Pi and that mimics the transition state F-ADP-P* of ATP hydrolysis on F-actin (31Combeau C. Carlier M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19017-19021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of BeF3-, the overshoot disappeared, and a higher fluorescence level was reached (Fig. 1D, cyan curve). The same level was reached upon addition of BeF3- to TMR-F-actin assembled at steady state in ATP (Fig. 1D, black curve). When the 1:1 TMR-labeled ATP-actin complex (31.5 μm) was polymerized in the absence of free ATP, the polymerization was transient and was followed by 90% depolymerization. Addition of BeF3- again restored the high level of TMR-F-actin (Fig. 1D, red curve). These data indicate that filaments assembled from TMR-ATP-actin are greatly destabilized by ATP hydrolysis and that BeF3- recapitulates a stable ATP-like state of TMR-F-actin, as already demonstrated for unlabeled F-actin. Negatively stained samples of filaments assembled from TMR-actin were observed under the electron microscope (Fig. 2A). Consistent with the view that the rapid assembly results from extensive fragmentation, only very short filaments were seen in a noisy background because of the high amount of TMR-G-actin (4-5 μm; see below). The average length was 30 nm, which corresponds to ∼15 actin subunits (Fig. 2B). Upon addition of BeF3-, the length of TMR-actin filaments increased, consistent with BeF3--induced stabilization (Fig. 2A). The very short length of TMR-ADP-F-actin filaments and their lengthening in the ADP-BeF3- state suggest that the filaments fragment often because of the fragility of the longitudinal interactions between ADP-actin subunits and must be very dynamic at steady state. This view was strengthened by measuring ATP hydrolysis during the assembly of TMR-actin and at steady state in comparison with unlabeled actin at the same concentration (Fig. 2C). ATP was hydrolyzed in a burst phase accompanying the polymerization of TMR-actin, followed by a steady rate. The rate of ATP hydrolysis at steady state was 26-fold faster for TMR-actin than for unlabeled actin, in agreement with the large increase in filament number. A steady rate of 5μm Pi released per min was measured in a solution of 20μm TMR-F-actin. From these numbers, we infer that, in the conventional method of preparation of TMR-actin, all the ATP present initially in the actin solution must have been hydrolyzed into ADP upon overnight incubation under physiological ionic conditions. Critical concentration measurements for assembly of TMR-actin in ATP and ADP were carried out using pyrenyl-actin fluorescence and sedimentation assays. Under physiological ionic conditions (0.1 m KCl and 1 mm MgCl2), the critical concentrations for assembly of TMR-actin were 3 ± 0.5 μm in ATP and 30 ± 3 μm in ADP (Fig. 3 and Table 1). The same critical concentration in ATP was obtained using TMR-actin isolated from either the pellet or supernatant of TMR-actin centrifuged overnight in the presence of salt and then re-equilibrated in buffer A.TABLE 1Thermodynamic and kinetic parameters for filament assembly from TMR-actinParameterUnlabeled actinTMR-actinCritical conc in ATPBoth ends free0.1 μm3 ± 0.5 μmPointed ends0.6 μm6 μmCritical conc in ADP1.5 μm30 μmk+B10 μm–1 s–10.65 μm–1 s–1 Open table in a new tab In the absence of KCl and in the presence of 1 mm MgCl2, the critical concentration was 8 ± 1 μm in ATP and was too high (>50 μm) to be measured in ADP. In the presence of ATP and BeF3- at physiological ionic strength, the critical concentration decreased to 0.5 μm. Sedimentation assays indicated that TMR-ADP-actin did not accumulate at steady state (data not shown). The amounts of sedimented F-actin and TMR-F-actin at 20 μm were identical. Still, the slopes of the fluorescence of unlabeled F-actin and TMR-F-actin in the presence of BeF3- were not identical (Fig. 3). In conclusion, the fluorescence of pyrenyl-F-actin in a filament made from TMR-actin was 2.5-fold lower than in a standard filament. This effect cannot be due to simple quenching of pyrenyl fluorescence by TMR because addition of free fluorophore to a solution of pyrenyl-actin did not affect the fluorescence. We conclude that the environment of the pyrenyl probe is different in F-actin and TMR-F-actin because of the different structures of the two filaments. Overall, the data demonstrate that, in contrast with previous views, TMR-actin can polymerize. A plausible interpretation of previous reports is that, during the labeling reaction, exhaustion of ATP due to filament rapid turnover yielded TMR-ADP-actin. We showed above that TMR-ADP-actin has a high critical concentration for assembly, especially at low ionic strength. TMR-actin was thus essentially unassembled and was found in the supernatant of centrifuged TMR-F-actin (2Otterbein L.R. Graceffa P. Dominguez R.

Our data show, however, that, once re-equilibrated in ATP-containing buffer A, TMR-actin found in the supernatant can be polymerized again, with the same characteristics as the originally labeled material. Barbed and Pointed End Assembly Parameters of TMR-actin— The rate parameters for association of TMR-G-actin with filament ends cannot be derived from the analysis of spontaneous assembly because the slow nucleation is not followed by association of G-actin with the ends of preformed nuclei that would remain in constant number. The continuous fragmentation of filaments introduces a supplementary variable in the system. The rate of barbed end assembly of TMR-G-actin from spectrin-actin seeds was measured at different concentrations of T"
