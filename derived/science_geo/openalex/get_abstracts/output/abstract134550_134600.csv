In this study, we have identified and characterized a novel 61-kDa protein kinase related to RIP that is a component of both the TNFR-1 and the CD40 signaling complexes. Receptor interactingprotein-2 (RIP2) contains an N-terminal domain with homology to Ser/Thr kinases and a C-terminal caspaseactivation and recruitment domain (CARD), a homophilic interaction motif that mediates the recruitment of caspase death proteases. Overexpression of RIP2 signaled both NF-κB activation and cell death. Mutational analysis revealed the pro-apoptotic function of RIP2 to be restricted to its C-terminal CARD domain, whereas the intact molecule was necessary for NF-κB activation. RIP2 interacted with other members of the TNFR-1 signaling complex, including inhibitor of apoptosis protein cIAP1 and with members of the TNFR-associated factor (TRAF) family, specifically TRAF1, TRAF5, and TRAF6, but not with TRAF2, TRAF3, or TRAF4. These TRAF interactions mediate the recruitment of RIP2 to receptor signaling complexes.

TNFR family members are defined by the presence of cysteine-rich repeats in their extracellular domain. Certain members share additional homology, possessing an intracellular domain termed the “death domain” that mediates recruitment of death domain-containing adapter molecules to the receptor signaling complex (13Chinnaiyan A.M.

TNFR-1 can signal a diversity of cellular activities by assembling an intricate signaling complex made of a number of adapter molecules that enables mediation of both apoptosis and NF-κB activation. CD40 is a cell surface transmembrane glycoprotein receptor expressed in late B-cells in the bone marrow, mature B-cells and certain accessory cells including bone marrow-derived dendritic cells and follicular dendritic cells (16Stamenkovic I.

The absence of an enzymatic domain in the cytoplasmic region of the TNFR family implies that signaling is mediated by receptor-associating proteins. The intracellular mediators identified to date fall into two distinct groups. The first group consists of proteins with a highly conserved domain termed the death domain and includes TRADD (20Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 81: 495-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1721) Google Scholar), FADD/MORT1 (13Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2144) Google Scholar), RIP (21Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Lee T.H. Kim E. Seed B. Cell. 1995; 81: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar, 22Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.-B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1996; 4: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar), and RAIDD (23Duan H. Dixit V.M. Nature. 1997; 385: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). These molecules are recruited to TNFR-1 or to Fas (CD-95) through homophilic interactions involving the cognate death domains. Overexpression of these death domain-containing adapter molecules mimics responses induced by ligand-receptor interactions, including NF-κB activation and apoptosis (22Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.-B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1996; 4: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar, 23Duan H. Dixit V.M. Nature. 1997; 385: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 24Chinnaiyan A.M. Tepper C.G. Seldin M.F. O'Rourke K. Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4961-4965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). In contrast to the other adapter molecules, RIP, in addition to a death domain, contains an N-terminal region of approximately 300 residues that is homologous to Ser/Thr protein kinases. RIP possesses kinase activity as it autophosphorylates itself on Ser/Thr residues. Overexpression of RIP engages the death pathway and activates NF-κB. The kinase domain does not appear to mediate either function, inasmuch as overexpression of the death domain by itself is sufficient to induce apoptosis and the intermediate domain (which separates the kinase and death domains) mediates NF-κB activation. The second group consists of the TNF-receptor-associated factors (TRAF); to date, six members have been identified. TRAF1 and TRAF2 were initially identified based on their interaction with the cytoplasmic domain of TNFR-2 (25Rothe M. Wong S.C. Henzel W.J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1994; 78: 681-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). TRAF1 and TRAF2 form homo- and heteromeric complexes with each other. Importantly, TRAF2, but not TRAF1, binds directly to the cytoplasmic domain of TNFR-2 and CD40 (26Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). Therefore, TRAF1 can only be recruited to the receptor signaling complex through TRAF2. TRAF3 interacts with CD40, CD30, TNFR-2, and lymphotoxin-β receptor (27Cheng G. Cleary A.M. Ye Z.S. Hong D.I. Lederman S. Baltimore D. Science. 1995; 267: 1494-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 28Hu H.M. O'Rourke K. Boguski M.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30069-30072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but its signaling function remains unclear. TRAF5 mediates signals arising from CD40 and lymphotoxin-β receptor (29Ishida T.

Azuma S. Kobayashi N. Tojo T. Suzuki K. Aizawa S. Watanabe T. Mosialos G. Kieff E. Yamamoto T. Inoue J. J. Biol.

Nature. 1996; 383: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). TRAF family members in turn associate with downstream signaling components including the cellular inhibitors of apo-ptosis, cIAP1 and cIAP2, present in both TNFR-1 and TNFR-2 signaling complexes (33Rothe M. Pan M.-G. Henzel W.J. Ayres T.M. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 83: 1243-1252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). The IAPs, being caspase inhibitors, could potentially act to attenuate apoptosis. Herein, we describe the identification of a novel TRAF-interacting kinase, designated RIP2, that specifically binds to TRAF1, TRAF5, and TRAF6, and is recruited to the TNFR-1 and CD40 receptor signaling complexes. The cDNA corresponding to a partial open reading frame of the C terminus of RIP2 was identified as a sequence homologous to RIP (21Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Lee T.H. Kim E. Seed B. Cell. 1995; 81: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar, 22Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.-B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V.

Fleischmann R.D. Fuldner R.A. Bult C.J. Lee N.H. Kirkness E.F. Weinstock K.G. Gocayne J.D. White O. et al.Nature. 1995; 377: 173-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). A full-length cDNA was obtained by screening an oligo(dT)-primed human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) cDNA library. A total of 1 × 106 transformants were screened with a 32P-labeled DNA fragment generated by PCR corresponding to amino acids 82–248 of the RIP2 open reading frame (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Double-stranded DNA sequencing was carried out by the dideoxy chain termination method using modified T7 DNA polymerase (Sequenase, U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Sequence alignments were performed using DNASTAR Megalign software. Human multiple tissue and human cancer cell line poly(A)+ RNA blots (CLONTECH) containing 2 μg/lane poly(A)+ RNA were hybridized according to the manufacturer's instructions using a 32P-labeled RIP2 probe corresponding to amino acids 82–248 of the RIP2 open reading frame. The DNA inserts encoding the N-terminal HA-tagged (HA-RIP2) or C-terminal Myc-His6-tagged (Myc-RIP2) RIP2 eukaryotic expression constructs were generated by standard PCR techniques and subcloned into the mammalian expression vectors pcDNA3 or pcDNA3.1/Myc-His (Invitrogen), respectively. Alteration of the catalytic lysine 47 to an alanine for RIP2(K47A) was accomplished by site-directed mutagenesis employing a four-primer PCR-based method (36Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2080) Google Scholar). The mutagenetic oligonucleotides were GTCCAGGTGGCCGTGGCCCACCTGCACATCCACA and TGTGGATGTGCAGGTGGGCCACGGCCACCTGGAC. The presence of the introduced mutation (underlined) and fidelity of PCR replication was confirmed by sequence analysis. Human MCF7 breast carcinoma cells were transiently transfected as described previously (13Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2144) Google Scholar, 37Duan H. Chinnaiyan A.M. Hudson P.L. Wing J.P. He W. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1621-1625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2.5 × 105 MCF7 cells were transfected with 0.1 μg of the reporter plasmid pCMV β-galactosidase plus 1 μg of test plasmid in six-well tissue culture dishes using LipofectAMINE as per manufacturer's instructions. Thirty-six hours after transfection, the cells were fixed with 0.5% gluteraldehyde and stained with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside for 3–4 h. Cells were visualized by phase contrast microscopy. Approximately 300 β-galactosidase-positive cells were assessed from each transfection (n = 3) from three randomly selected fields, and the mean of these was used to calculate percentage apoptosis. Viable or apoptotic cells were distinguished based on morphological alterations typical of adherent cells undergoing apoptosis including becoming rounded, condensed, and detached from the dish (38Kerr J.F. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12616) Google Scholar, 39Cohen J.J. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 126-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar). Transient transfection of 293 cells was performed by calcium phosphate precipitation with the indicated constructs as described previously (40Chinnaiyan A.M. Orth K. O'Rourke K. Duan H. Poirier G.G. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4573-4576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Where indicated, a CrmA expression construct was included to suppress apoptosis. Cells were harvested 24–36 h after transfection and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, and a protease inhibitor mixture). Lysates were immunoprecipitated with control monoclonal antibody (mAb) (designated C) or epitope mAb for 4 h at 4 °C as described (24Chinnaiyan A.M. Tepper C.G. Seldin M.F. O'Rourke K. Kischkel F.C.

The precipitates were washed three times in lysis buffer and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Subsequent protein immunoblotting was performed as described (24Chinnaiyan A.M. Tepper C.G. Seldin M.F. O'Rourke K. Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4961-4965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). For reporter gene assays, 293 cells (2.5 × 105 cells/well) were seeded into six-well plates and transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (40Chinnaiyan A.M. Orth K. O'Rourke K. Duan H. Poirier G.G. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4573-4576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar) with 0.1 μg of E-selectin-luciferase reporter gene plasmid and the indicated amounts of each expression construct. The total DNA concentration was kept constant by supplementation with empty vector. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection and reporter gene activity determined with the Luciferase Assay System (Promega). A β-galactosidase expression vector (0.1 μg) was used to normalize transfection efficiencies. Immunoprecipitates were prepared from transfected 293 cells as described above and washed once with 1 ml of kinase assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). The kinase assay was performed at 30 °C for 30 min in 30 μl of kinase assay buffer supplemented with 100 mm[γ-32P]ATP and 5 μm ATP. Reactions were stopped with 20 μl of SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Data base searching revealed two novel cDNA clones (HDEDU78 and HNFJB62) encoding partial open reading frames that had homology to the serine threonine kinase domain of RIP. A HUVEC cDNA library was screened to obtain a full-length cDNA. It contained a 1623-base pair open reading frame encoding a novel 541-residue protein with a predicted molecular mass of 61 kDa and was designated RIP2 (Fig. 1 A). The putative initiator methionine (ACCATGA) was in agreement with the consensus Kozak sequence for translation initiation (41Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2789) Google Scholar). The N terminus of RIP2 displayed high homology to protein kinases, with residues +1 to +311 of RIP2 constituting a protein kinase domain. Alignment of the predicted kinase domain of RIP2 with that of both human and murine RIP (Fig. 1 B) demonstrated that the three molecules share significant homology and conservation. The middle of the molecule contains a stretch of 143 amino acids with little or no homology to known proteins. A BLAST search of the public data base revealed that the 87 C-terminal amino acids of RIP2 had statistically significant homology (p < 0.001) with the intermediate domain of both mammalian cIAP1 and cIAP2 (Fig. 1 C) and, to a lesser extent, similarity to the prodomain of the human death protease caspase-2 and theCaenorhabditis elegans death protease CED-3. Comparable domains of approximately 90 amino acids have been identified in a number of other molecules involved in apoptotic signaling, including RAIDD, caspase-1, caspase-2, caspase-9, and cIAP1 and cIAP2. This domain is known to mediate homophilic interactions, allowing for the recruitment of caspases to receptor complexes. Therefore, this unique motif has been termed CARD (for caspaseactivation and recruitment domain) (42Hofmann K. Bucher P. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 155-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Sequence comparisons revealed that the RIP2 CARD domain possessed highest homology with the corresponding domain in cIAP1 and cIAP2 (51.3% and 47.9% similarity). This was comparable to the homology between the CARD motifs that mediate the interaction of RAIDD and caspase-2 (67.2% similarity). Human tissue and cell line RNA blots were probed with a 32P-labeled cDNA probe specific for RIP2. RIP2 was found to be constitutively expressed in a variety of human tissues (Fig. 2). Two transcripts were detected. The 2-kilobase transcript corresponds in size to the cDNA cloned from the HUVEC library. The other transcript, which is approximately 2.4 kilobases, may represent a related RIP2 isoform or may have arisen from use of an alternate polyadenylation signal. Nevertheless, RIP2 was highly expressed in the spleen, peripheral blood leukocytes, placenta, testis, and heart, but was barely detectable in the thymus (Fig. 2, upper panels). A variety of transformed cell lines expressed low levels of RIP2, whereas RAJI cells, a transformed B-cell line, displayed significant expression (Fig. 2, lower panel). 293 cells were transfected with HA-RIP2 or HA-RIP2(K47A), a mutant in which the conserved lysine essential for enzymatic activity and ATP binding has been altered to an alanine, and immunoprecipitated. An in vitro kinase assay was performed on the immunoprecipitated complex, and a 61-kDa32P-labeled band corresponding to RIP2 was identified (Fig. 3 A). As predicted, no kinase activity was observed for RIP2(K47A). These observations demonstrate that RIP2 is an autophosphorylating protein kinase. Based on sequence alignments to the catalytic domains of known protein kinases (Fig. 3 B), RIP2 contains residues that are highly conserved in Ser/Thr kinases. Specifically, the key subdomains that differentiate Tyr from Ser/Thr substrate specificity (the DLKTQN sequence, corresponding to kinase subdomain VI, and the GTIIYMPPE sequence, corresponding to kinase subdomain VIII) are conserved (Fig. 3 B) (43Hanks S.K. Lindberg R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 44Taylor S.S. Radzio-Andzelm E. Structure. 1994; 2: 345-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). To study its functional role, human MCF7 breast carcinoma cells were transfected with a eukaryotic expression vector encoding RIP2 and subsequently assessed for apoptosis. Overexpression of RIP2 induced extensive cell death in transfected cultures, displaying morphological characteristics typical of adherent cells undergoing apoptosis: becoming rounded and condensed, and detaching from the culture dish (Fig. 4 A). To identify the domain responsible, truncation mutants were constructed and analyzed for their ability to induce cell death. Deletion of the CARD domain encoding region, RIP2-(1–454), abolished the pro-apoptotic function of RIP2, whereas expression of the CARD domain alone, RIP2-(455–541), induced apoptosis at levels comparable to the native molecule. This indicated that the apoptotic activity of RIP2 was restricted to the C-terminal CARD motif (Fig. 4 B). Kinase activity was not required as RIP2(K47A) induce apoptosis at comparable levels to wild-type RIP2 (Fig. 4 B). Furthermore, deletion of the kinase domain of RIP2 (positions 311–541) had no effect on its pro-apoptotic activity. Taken together, these results substantiate the previous observation that the CARD domain is both sufficient and necessary for RIP2-mediated apoptosis. RIP2-induced apoptosis was blocked by a broad range of known inhibitors of apoptosis, including CrmA, z-VAD-fmk, p35, bcl-xL, cIAP1, and cIAP2 (Fig. 4 C). Because RIP2 has sequence homology to RIP, a known activator of NF-κB (22Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.-B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1996; 4: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar), we investigated a possible role for RIP2 in NF-κB activation. An NF-κB-dependent E-selectin-luciferase reporter construct and a RIP2 expression vector were cotransfected into 293 cells. Expression of RIP2 activated the reporter gene in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5 A), with maximum induction of luciferase activity being 40-fold compared with vector control. The intact molecule was required for this activity, as truncated derivatives of RIP2 failed to induce NF-κB activity, suggesting that integrity of the molecule was essential for its ability to signal NF-κB (data not shown). RIP2(K47A) retained the ability to induce NF-κB activation, consistent with kinase activity not being required (data not shown). NF-κB activation induced by members of the TNFR family is in part mediated by the TRAF adapter family. We therefore determined whether dominant negative versions of TRAF proteins could act as inhibitors of RIP2-induced NF-κB activation. RIP2-induced NF-κB activation was blocked by dominant negative derivatives of TRAF2 (TRAF2-DN) and TRAF6 (TRAF6-DN), whereas, as expected, TRAF3-DN did not interfere with RIP2-mediated NF-κB activation (Fig. 5 B). Furthermore, a dominant negative mutant version of the downstream kinase NIK, which is implicated in TRAF-mediated NF-κB activation, strongly inhibited RIP2-induced NF-κB activation. Conversely, dominant negative versions of adapter molecules that act upstream of the TRAFs (RIP-DN and FADD-DN) were without effect. Several proteins involved in apoptotic signaling possess regions of sequence similarity that mediate homophilic interactions. Frequently, these domains mediate the association of proteins in a signaling cascade. RIP2 contains a CARD motif that is known to mediate protein-protein interactions (23Duan H. Dixit V.M. Nature. 1997; 385: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Given this, we determined if RIP2 might interact with other CARD-containing molecules. 293 cells were transiently transfected with expression constructs that directed the synthesis of Flag-RAIDD, Flag-caspase-9, Flag-caspase-1, Flag-caspase-4, Myc-cIAP1, Myc-cIAP2, and epitope-tagged-RIP2. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed surprising specificity, with RIP2 binding only cIAP1 (Fig. 6), the molecule to which it is most similar in the CARD motif. Previous studies have demonstrated that RIP interacts with TRAF1, TRAF2, and TRAF3 and, as part of a RIP-TRAF2-TRADD complex, can be recruited to TNFR-1 (22Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.-B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1996; 4: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar). Because of the observed sequence similarity between RIP and RIP2, we determined if RIP2 could similarly interact with TRAF proteins. 293 cells were transiently transfected with expression constructs that directed the synthesis of Flag epitope-tagged TRAF proteins and Myc epitope-tagged-RIP2. Immunoprecipitation of Flag-TRAF1, Flag-TRAF5, and Flag-TRAF6 quantitatively coprecipitated Myc-RIP2 (Fig. 7 A). No association was detected with Flag-TRAF2, Flag-TRAF3, or Flag-TRAF4 (Fig. 7 A). TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6 mediate NF-κB activation (26Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar,29Ishida T. Tojo T. Aoki T.

Taken together, these studies raised a paradox inasmuch as RIP2-induced NF-κB activity can be inhibited by TRAF2-DN (Fig. 4 B), despite the absence of a direct interaction between RIP2 and TRAF2 (Fig. 7 A). However, because TRAF1 interacts strongly with both TRAF2 and RIP2, it was possible that TRAF2 interacted with RIP2 through TRAF1. 293 cells were transfected with combinations of expression constructs that directed the synthesis of Myc-RIP2, Flag-TRAF1, and AU1-TRAF2. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies and the immunoprecipitates analyzed by Western blotting using anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 7 B). This analysis confirmed that RIP2 associated strongly with TRAF1, but not with TRAF2. However, when cells coexpressed RIP2, TRAF1, and TRAF2, coimmunoprecipitation of RIP2 with TRAF2 was evident (Fig. 7 B), suggesting that TRAF1 can serve as a bridging molecule between RIP2 and TRAF2. RIP2 specifically binds to TRAF5 and TRAF6 and, through TRAF1, interacts with TRAF2. Therefore, we determined whether RIP2 could be immunoprecipitated with members of the TNFR family in the concomitant presence of TRAF molecules. In 293 cells expressing RIP2, CD40, and TRAF6 or TRAF5, RIP2 was quantitatively coprecipitated with CD40 (Fig. 8 A). In cells expressing CD40, RIP2, and TRAF1 or TRAF2 only, a weak association (presumably mediated by endogenous TRAFs) could be detected between CD40 and RIP2. However, when CD40 and RIP2 were expressed in the presence of both TRAF1 and TRAF2, enhanced association of RIP2 with CD40 could be detected (Fig. 8 B). On activation of TNFR-1, the adapter molecule TRADD is recruited to the signaling complex where it subsequently binds the TRAF2-TRAF1 heterocomplex. Because RIP2 binds to the same heterocomplex, we asked if it could be recruited to TNFR-1. In 293 cells expressing TNFR-1, TRADD, and TRAF1or TRAF2, little RIP2 coprecipitated with TNFR-1 (Fig. 8 C). The small amount that did precipitate was probably mediated by endogenous TRAFs. However, when TNFR-1 and RIP2 were co-expressed in the presence of TRADD, TRAF1, and TRAF2, enhanced binding of RIP2 to TNFR-1 was detected (Fig. 8 C). Taken together, these results suggest that RIP2 could be a component of both the TNFR-1 and CD40 receptor signaling complexes. In summary, we have identified a novel protein kinase, RIP2, that can be recruited to the CD40 and TNFR-1 signaling complexes. Because TRAF proteins function as adaptor molecules for other TNFR family members, it is possible that RIP2 is also recruited to additional receptors. Regardless, the identification of this molecule has added a second kinase (other than RIP) that is recruited to signaling complexes assembled by certain members of the TNFR family.

https://openalex.org/W1980069375,"A 1.6-kilobase pair cDNA was isolated from a human T-cell-derived expression library that encodes a novel eosinophil chemoattractant (designated ecalectin) expressed during allergic and parasitic responses. Based on its deduced amino acid sequence, ecalectin is a 36-kDa protein consisting of 323 amino acids. Although ecalectin lacks a hydrophobic signal peptide, it is secreted from mammalian cells. Ecalectin is not related to any known cytokine or chemokine but rather is a variant of human galectin-9, a member of the large family of animal lectins that have affinity for β-galactosides. Recombinant ecalectin, expressed in COS cells and insect cells, exhibited potent eosinophil chemoattractant activity and attracted eosinophils in vitro and in vivo in a dose-dependent manner but not neutrophils, lymphocytes, or monocytes. The finding that the ecalectin transcript is present in abundance in various lymphatic tissues and that its expression increases substantially in antigen-activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells suggests that ecalectin is an important T-cell-derived regulator of eosinophil recruitment in tissues during inflammatory reactions. We believe that this is the first report of the expression of an immunoregulatory galectin expressed by a T-cell line that is selective for eosinophils.

Because these regulatory factors often work in concert, an eosinophil generally has to be cytokine-primed to respond to an ECA. Increased numbers of eosinophils in tissues that contain antigen-activated T-cells have been observed by several groups (30Frew A.J. Kay A.B. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 4158-4164PubMed Google Scholar, 31Azzawi M. Bradley B. Jefferey P.K. Frew A.J. Wardlaw A.J. Knowles G. Assoufi B. Collins J.V. Durham S. Kay A.B. Am. Rev. Respir.

However, it has been assumed that T-cells do not directly recruit eosinophils into tissues because they do not produce substantial amounts of an eotaxin. Most ECA are positively charged proteins that are small in size. For example, human eotaxin-1 consists of only 74 amino acids, yet 16 of them are either Lys or Arg (5Ponath P.D. Qin S. Ringler D.J.

We previously noted that concanavalin A-activated or antigen-activated CD4+ T-cells from patients infected with Schistosoma mansoni (35Hirashima M. Ueno M. Kamiya K-I. Higuchi S. Matsumoto R. Lymphokine Cytokine Res. 1991; 10: 481-486PubMed Google Scholar) produce an apparently novel 30–40-kDa ECA with a relatively neutral isoelectric point. The virus-transformed human T-cell line STO-2 also appears to spontaneously produce this ECA (36Hirashima M. Ueno M. Higuchi S. Matsumoto T. Sakata K-M. Matsumoto R. Adachi M. Lymphokine Cytokine Res. 1992; 11: 331-338PubMed Google Scholar). Using blocking antibodies, we concluded that the T-cell-derived ECA was not IL-3, IL-5, or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. We now describe the purification, molecular cloning, and functional expression of ecalectin, a novel ECA produced by T-cells. Ecalectin is a variant of a protein, designated human galectin-9 (37Türeci Ö. Schmitt H. Fadle N. Pfreundschuh M. Sahin U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6416-6422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), of unknown function recently found in the tumor of a patient with Hodgkin's lymphoma. The STO-2 cell line was previously derived by transformation of normal human T-cells with human T-cell lymphoma-leukemia virus (35Hirashima M. Ueno M. Kamiya K-I. Higuchi S. Matsumoto R. Lymphokine Cytokine Res. 1991; 10: 481-486PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis revealed that the cell line is of T-cell origin. It expresses CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, and CD8 but lacks granulocyte/macrophage and B-cell markers such as CD16, CD19, and Leu7. Supernatants from STO-2 cells (2 × 10−5/ml) that had been cultured for ∼72 h in SF-02 serum-free medium (Sanko-Junnyaku Co., Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with 0.1% human serum albumin, 100 units/ml IL-2 (Tokushima Research Institute, Tokushima, Japan), 50 μM 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 5 μg/ml fungizone were adjusted to pH 5.0 with 50 mm sodium acetate buffer. The resulting conditioned medium (5 liters) was applied to replicate 2.6 × 40-cm columns of CM-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that had been equilibrated with 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0. Each ion exchange column was washed extensively with equilibration buffer to remove the major albumin contaminate in the conditioned medium. Bound ecalectin was eluted by exposing the column to 20 mm sodium phosphate and 0.1 m NaCl, pH 7.0. After dialysis of the pooled eluate (∼300 ml) against 1% glycine, the material was subjected to preparative isoelectric focusing. Those 40-ml fractions having proteins with a pI of 7–8 were collected on a Rotofor system (Bio-Rad). The ecalectin-enriched material was then concentrated ∼10-fold in an ultrafiltration apparatus with a YM-5 membrane (Amicon Corp., Lexington, MA). After the material was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), it was fractionated further on a 1 × 30-cm column of Superose-12 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with the same buffer. Based on a calibration of the gel filtration column, most of the ECA activity was 30–40 kDa. The ecalectin-enriched fractions were precipitated with 60% saturated ammonium sulfate, dissolved in 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) containing 30% ammonium sulfate, and applied to a 4.6 mm × 7.5-cm reverse phase column of TSKgel phenyl-5PW (Tosoh Co., Tokyo, Japan) equilibrated in the same buffer. The column was subjected to a linear gradient, decreasing the ammonium sulfate concentration in the buffer from 30 to 0%. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis of a portion of the final biologically active fraction failed to reveal a Coomassie Blue-stainable protein of a defined molecular weight. Nevertheless, New Zealand White rabbits were immunized with the resulting partially purified ecalectin in Freund's complete adjuvant, and after booster injections in Freund's incomplete adjuvant, sera were collected. Once the ecalectin cDNA described below was isolated and its amino acid sequence was deduced, a more specific antibody was generated in rabbits using an anti-peptide approach. A 13-mer peptide (AFSSSQAPYLSPA) corresponding to residues 2–14 of human ecalectin was synthesized by Peptide Inc. (Osaka, Japan). A Cys residue was then added to the C terminus of the ecalectin peptide to facilitate the coupling of the resulting 14-mer peptide through its thiol group tom-maleimidobenzoic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Sigma). A rabbit was immunized with the coupled peptide, sera were collected, and the relevant antibodies were purified using an affinity column consisting of the same peptide coupled to 2-fluoro-1-methylpyridinium toluene 4-sulfonate cellufine (Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan). A STO-2 cell cDNA expression library was constructed with the ZAP ExpressTM cDNA Gigapack cloning kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, ∼5 μg of poly(A)+ mRNA was isolated from 1 × 108 STO-2 cells with the FastTrack RNA isolation kit from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA). The first DNA strand was synthesized with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and a 50-mer oligo(dT) primer (5′-GAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAACTAGTCTCGAGTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3′) containing an internal XhoI site. Synthesis was carried out in the presence of 5-methyl-CTP to methylate internal XhoI sites in the cDNAs, and then EcoRI adaptors were ligated onto the 5′-ends of the resulting cDNAs. After digestion withXhoI (Stratagene), the cDNAs were size-fractionated on a 1-ml Sephacryl S-500 HR (Life Technologies, Inc.) gel filtration column that had been equilibrated in 0.1 mm EDTA, 25 mm NaCl, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. cDNAs of >500 base pairs were pooled, directionally cloned into the bacteriophage expression vector, and then packaged into phage particles with Gigapack III Gold extract. Escherichia coli (strain XL-1 Blue MRF′) was transfected with the resulting phage to obtain a cDNA library with a titer of ∼1 × 1011plaque-forming units/ml. The STO-2 cell cDNA library was then probed with the picoBlueTM immunoscreening kit from Stratagene and the newly generated antibodies (∼10 ng/ml) directed against human ecalectin. The ExAssist/XLOLR system (Stratagene) was used for the cloning and expression of ecalectin in COS-1 cells because it allows for efficient excision of pBK-CMV phagemid from the ZAP express vector. With the use of plasmid miniprep isolation kits from Qiagen (Santa Clara, CA), plasmid DNA was purified from the clones selected by the immunoscreening procedure. To determine which immunoreactive clones actually encoded a functional ECA, in each instance ∼5 μg of purified cDNA were transfected into COS cells via the DEAE-dextran method (38Sussman D.J. Milman G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1641-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) or the SuperFect method employing a polycationic reagent from Qiagen. Transfectants were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (FCS) and 50 μM 2-mercaptoethanol at 37 °C for 3 days, and then the resulting supernatants were examined as described above for ECA activity. For a negative control, replicate COS cells were transfected in a similar fashion with a pCMV β-gal cDNA (Stratagene). The ecalectin cDNAs, isolated from the three immunoreactive clones that exhibited ECA activity in the in vitro assay described below, were sequenced in both directions on an Applied Biosystems automated DNA sequencer as described by Sanger and co-workers (39Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52658) Google Scholar) using vector-specific primers and newly created oligonucleotides corresponding to internal nucleotide sequences in the ecalectin cDNA. Recombinant human ecalectin was also expressed inSpondoptera frugiperda 9 (Sf9) insect cells using the approach we previously used to generate a recombinant tryptase zymogen (40Matsumoto R. Šali A. Ghildyal N. Karplus M. Stevens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19524-19531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Briefly, the ecalectin cDNA was liberated from pBK-CMV by digesting the mammalian cell expression plasmid withEcoRI and NotI. The resulting cDNA was then inserted into the corresponding restriction sites of pVL1393 (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) downstream of the promoter of the polyhedrin gene. Plasmid DNA, purified by CsCl density gradient centrifugation, was mixed with linearized BaculoGoldTM DNA (PharMingen) and calcium phosphate, and the resulting DNA solution was added to Sf9 insect cells. The recombinant baculovirus that contained the ecalectin cDNA was identified by a plaque assay, amplified, and used to infect fresh Sf9 cells. Sf9 cells were cultured at 27 °C in TNM-FH medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS. After 3 days of culture, the infected cells (∼7 × 106) were collected by centrifugation and suspended in 1 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl (TBS) and varied protease inhibitors (100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), 2 μg/ml leupeptin (Sigma), 1 μg/ml pepstatin A (Sigma), 2 μg/ml aprotinin (Sigma), and 1 mm EDTA). The cell suspension was sonicated on ice and centrifuged to remove the debris, and the resulting supernatant was applied to a 1-ml lactose column (Seikagaku Corp.). After the affinity column was washed extensively with TBS to remove contaminating insect cell-derived proteins, recombinant ecalectin was eluted by exposing the column to 200 mmlactose in TBS. Aliquots of the eluate fractions were evaluated for their protein content. Buffer containing SDS and 2-mercaptoethanol was added to each, and the sample was boiled for 5 min and then subjected to SDS-PAGE. Gels were silver-stained to evaluate the number of proteins in each column fraction. Protein blots, prepared from replicate gels, were stained with the above anti-peptide antibody and the ECLTM development system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to demonstrate the presence of the recombinant ecalectin. Eosinophil chemotaxis of native, COS cell-derived recombinant, and insect cell-derived recombinant ecalectin was evaluated in vitro as described (35Hirashima M. Ueno M. Kamiya K-I. Higuchi S. Matsumoto R. Lymphokine Cytokine Res. 1991; 10: 481-486PubMed Google Scholar, 36Hirashima M. Ueno M. Higuchi S. Matsumoto T. Sakata K-M. Matsumoto R. Adachi M. Lymphokine Cytokine Res. 1992; 11: 331-338PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, CD16− eosinophils were isolated by subjecting peripheral blood human mononuclear cells from healthy volunteers to a discontinuous density gradient of Percoll (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), followed by immunomagnetic treatment of the obtained cells with anti-CD16 immunoglobulin (DAKO A.S., Glostrup, Denmark). The purity and viability of the obtained eosinophils were >97 and 95%, respectively. Chemotactic activity was evaluated with a 48-well chamber (Neuro Probe Inc., Cabin John, MD) containing a polyvinylpyrolidone-free membrane with 5-μm standard pore sizes. Human eosinophils (0.5–1 × 106/ml) and varied concentrations of a test chemoattractant were placed in the top and bottom chambers, respectively. Each assay was performed in triplicate. After a 1–2-h incubation at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, the membrane separating the two chambers was removed and placed in Diff-Quik® stain (Baxter Healthcare Corp., McGaw Park, IL), and the stained eosinophils that had migrated through the membrane were counted under the microscope. Human C5a (Sigma), IL-5 (Genzyme, Cambridge, MA), RANTES (Genzyme), and eotaxin-1 (Seikagaku Corp.) were used as positive controls. The ability of ecalectin to attract peripheral blood human neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes in vitro was evaluated in a similar fashion. Neutrophils were obtained by centrifuging human peripheral blood cells at 400 × g for 20 min on a discontinuous density gradient of Percoll. After the contaminating erythrocytes were lysed with ammonium chloride, the purity of the resulting neutrophils was ∼99%. Monocytes and lymphocytes were separated from one another by briefly culturing the resulting monocyte/lymphocyte-enriched fraction in 75-cm2 plastic culture flasks. The nonadherent lymphocytes were subjected to a second plastic adherence step. As assessed immunohistochemically with fluorescence-activated cell sorting and anti-CD14 immunoglobulin (DAKO A.S.), the monocyte contamination in the resulting lymphocyte preparation was 1% or less. The flasks containing the adherent monocytes were washed several times with PBS. Ice-cold RPMI 1640 containing 5% FCS and 0.5% EDTA were added, and the flasks were shaken on ice for 30 min. The recovered cells were almost pure monocytes. Chemotaxis was carried out essentially as described above for eosinophils except that the membranes used in some of the assays had 3- and 8-μm standard pore sizes. Human C5a and IL-8 (Genzyme) served as positive controls in the neutrophil chemotaxis assay. Human lymphotactin (Genzyme) and MCP-1 (Genzyme) served as positive controls in the lymphocyte and monocyte chemotaxis assays, respectively. For evaluation of its ECA activity in vivo, purified insect cell-derived recombinant ecalectin was dialyzed extensively against PBS to remove the lactose. PBS containing 1% human serum albumin (1.0 ml) with or without purified ecalectin (∼10−7m) was then injected into the peritoneal cavities of replicate C57BL/6 mice. 14–24 h later, each mouse was sacrificed, 6 ml of PBS containing 2% FCS was injected into the peritoneal cavity, and the obtained cells in the peritoneal exudate were centrifuged onto slides. The resulting slides were stained with Diff-Quick, and the number of eosinophils that had extravasated into the peritoneal cavity of the mouse was determined. To determine if there are multiple ecalectin-like genes in the human genome, 6-μg samples of human blood-derived genomic DNA (Noven, Madison, WI) were incubated overnight at 37 °C with 30–60 units of BamHI,BglII, EcoRI, HindIII,KpnI, NotI, PstI, SalI,XbaI, or XhoI (New England Biolabs). After electrophoretic separation of the resulting digests in a 0.9% agarose gel (41Southern E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 503-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (21469) Google Scholar), a DNA blot was prepared and probed under conditions of high stringency with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled probes that correspond to residues 1–460 or residues 1073–1579 (sequence corresponding to the 3′-untranslated region) of the human ecalectin cDNA. Premade blots containing either total RNA (OriGene Technologies, Rockville, MD) or poly(A)+ RNA (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) from various human tissues were analyzed with the radiolabeled ecalectin probes. RNA blots were washed twice for 15 min each at room temperature in 2× SSC containing 0.1% SDS and then twice for 30 min each at 60 °C in 0.1× SSC containing 0.1% SDS. After autoradiography, the images were analyzed with a BAS-2000. 32P imaging apparatus (Fuji Film Co., Tokyo, Japan). To determine if the steady-state level of the ecalectin transcript in a T-cell can be antigen-regulated, heparinized peripheral blood was obtained from two volunteers sensitive to Dermatophagoides farinae, and the peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation. The obtained cells (5 × 106/ml) were suspended in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% FCS and cultured for 48 h in the absence or presence of 5 μg/ml of D. farinae. Under these in vitro conditions, the T-cells in the peripheral blood mononuclear cell preparation should be the cells that are preferentially activated. Total RNA was isolated from control and D. farinae-stimulated cells with RNeasy Midi kits from Qiagen. For blot analysis of each sample, ∼5 μg of denatured total RNA were electrophoresed in a 1.4% agarose/formaldehyde gel, and the separated RNA was blotted onto Hybond™ nylon membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (42Thomas P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5201-5205Crossref PubMed Scopus (5861) Google Scholar). After UV-cross-linking of the RNA, the membranes were incubated at 68 °C for 30 min in QuikHyb (Stratagene) containing 40 μg/ml of denatured salmon sperm DNA (Stratagene) alone and then for 2 h in the same hybridization buffer containing a radiolabeled ecalectin probe. To ensure that approximately equal amounts of RNA were loaded in the individual lanes of the blot, the same blot generally was reprobed with the 548-base pair fragment (CLONTECH) that consists of residues 256–804 of a human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA (43Tso J.Y. Sun X-H. Kao T-H. Reece K.S. Wu R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 2485-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). Supernatants from antigen-activated T-cells from normal donors were also evaluated by SDS-PAGE/immunoblot analysis with the anti-peptide antibody described above for determining whether or not immunoreactive ecalectin was exocytosed from these nontransformed cells. 32 immunoreactive clones were obtained when the expression cDNA library prepared from the human T-cell line was screened with anti-ecalectin immunoglobulin directed against the semipurified factor. When the cDNAs from these clones were individually transfected into COS cells and the supernatants of the transfectants were analyzed 2 days later, three of the clones exhibited potent ECA activity in the in vitro chemotaxis assay. Subsequent nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that these clones encoded the same protein. The consensus nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the STO-2 cell-derived ecalectin cDNAs are depicted in Fig. 1. If the translation-initiation and translation-termination sites begin at residues 60 and 1028, respectively, the open reading frame of the transcript encodes a 36-kDa protein consisting of 323 amino acids. The ecalectin transcript has a typical polyadenylylation signal sequence at residues 1576–1581. 59 and >560 nucleotides are present in its 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions, respectively. Repetitive sequences are often found in the 3′-untranslated regions of transcripts that have short half-lives (44Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3123) Google Scholar). Although no repetitive “AUUUA” motif resides in the 3′-untranslated region as it does in eotaxin-1 and most other chemokine and cytokine transcripts, four copies of a “CCCUCC” motif reside between residues 1341 and 1484 in the 3′-noncoding portion of the ecalectin transcript. Native ecalectin is secreted from the STO-2 cell line. Although the deduced amino acid sequence of the STO-2-derived transcript indicates that ecalectin contains large numbers of Phe, Leu, and Val residues, this ECA lacks a hydrophobic signal peptide at its amino terminus. Ecalectin is also predicted to have a pI of ∼8.1. Ecalectin has four Cys residues and three potential Asn-linked glycosylation sites at positions 34, 79, and 137. Blot analysis of genomic DNA digested separately with 10 different restriction enzymes indicated multiple genes in the human genome encode ecalectin-like transcripts. Nevertheless, the 5′ (Fig. 2, lanes 3,5, 6, 8, and 10) and 3′ (data not shown) ecalectin probes often hybridized strongly to one major DNA fragment in the digested genomic DNA. When varied human tissues were analyzed with these probes, the ∼1.8-kb ecalectin transcript or its homolog was found in relative abundance in lymphoid tissues (Fig. 3). Because of the prominence of the ecalectin transcript in T-cell-enriched tissues, we investigated whether or not its level increases in peripheral blood mononuclear cells after antigen stimulation. As shown in Fig. 4 for one of the two allergic patients, these cells contained a small amount of ecalectin mRNA. However, the amount of ecalectin transcript increased ∼50- and ∼90-fold in the two experiments after the cells from the patients were exposed toD. farinae for 48 h. Although the steady-state level of a transcript does not always correlate with the amount of protein that the cell produces, these RNA blot findings suggest that the T-cells in the preparation d"

Although asymmetricNG,NG-dimethylation of arginine residues in glycine-arginine-rich domains of eucaryotic proteins, catalyzed by type I protein arginineN-methyltransferases (PRMT), has been known for some time, members of this enzyme class have only recently been cloned. The first example of this type of enzyme, designated PRMT1, cloned because of its ability to interact with the mammalian TIS21 immediate-early protein, was then shown to have protein arginine methyltransferase activity. We have now isolated rat and human cDNA orthologues that encode proteins with substantial sequence similarity to PRMT1. A recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion product of this new rat protein, named PRMT3, asymmetrically dimethylates arginine residues present both in the designed substrate GST-GAR and in substrate proteins present in hypomethylated extracts of a yeastrmt1 mutant that lacks type I arginine methyltransferase activity; PRMT3 is thus a functional type I protein arginineN-methyltransferase. However, rat PRMT1 and PRMT3 glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins have distinct enzyme specificities for substrates present in both hypomethylatedrmt1 yeast extract and hypomethylated RAT1 embryo cell extract. TIS21 protein modulates the enzymatic activity of recombinant GST-PRMT1 fusion protein but not the activity of GST-PRMT3. Western blot analysis of gel filtration fractions suggests that PRMT3 is present as a monomer in RAT1 cell extracts. In contrast, PRMT1 is present in an oligomeric complex.

Immunofluorescence analysis localized PRMT1 predominantly to the nucleus of RAT1 cells. In contrast, PRMT3 is predominantly cytoplasmic. Protein function is often modulated by post-translational covalent modifications. One such modification is theN-methylation of the side chain of guanidino arginine residues (1Gary J.D. Clarke S Prog.

TIS21 (also known as PC3 and BTG2) is a member of a family proteins (TIS21, BTG1, BTG3, and TOB) thought to be involved in negative control of the cell cycle (8Guehenneux F. Duret L. Callanan M.B.

Moreover, human PRMT1 was independently isolated as a protein that interacts with the intracellular domain of the interferon-α, β receptor (15Abramovich C. Yakobson B. Chebath J. Revel M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domain of this receptor is also a docking site for many signaling proteins such as tyrosine kinases, serine/threonine kinases, and STAT transcription factors (16Leaman D.W. Leung S. Li X. Stark G.R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1578-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). PRMT1 antisense oligonucleotides relieve interferon-β-induced growth inhibition (15Abramovich C. Yakobson B. Chebath J. Revel M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The interaction of PRMT1 with both the TIS21 immediate-early gene product and with a transmembrane receptor suggests a role for this enzyme in cell signaling. Human and rat PRMT1 are 96% identical at the amino acid level. Rmt1, the yeast PRMT1 homologue, is 45% identical to the human and rat PRMT1 proteins and is the predominant protein arginine methyltransferase activity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, accounting for more than 85% of yeast PRMT activity (17Gary J.D.

Data base searches have identified a distinct human gene,HRMT1L1 (19Katsanis N. Yaspo M.L. Fisher E.M. Mamm. Genome. 1997; 8: 526-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), whose predicted open reading frame encodes a protein containing a potential protein arginineN-methyltransferase domain that has 33% of its amino acid residues identical to and 61% of its amino acid residues similar to human PRMT1. The calculated molecular mass for the PRMT1 polypeptide, based on the translated cDNA sequence, is 40.5 kDa (7Lin W.-J. Gary J.D. Yang M.C. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15034-15044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). However, protein arginine methyltransferase activity from several mammalian tissues and cell lines migrates on gel filtration columns at apparent sizes ranging between 150 and 500 kDa (4Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2800-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 7Lin W.-J. Gary J.D. Yang M.C. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol.

By using a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify proteins that interact with PRMT1, we have identified a previously unknown protein whose carboxyl-terminal 365 residues share substantial sequence similarity with PRMT1. This protein, which has protein arginineN-methyltransferase activity, has been named PRMT3. Although PRMT3 and PRMT1 are both type I protein arginineN-methyltransferases, they differ in their substrate specificities, oligomerization properties, interaction with TIS21, and subcellular localization. The rat PRMT1 cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using pPC86-PRMT1 (7Lin W.-J. Gary J.D. Yang M.C. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15034-15044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) as the template and the primers 5′CCCCGGAATTCATGGCGGCAGCCGAGGCC3′ and 5′CTGGACGTCGACTCAGCGCATCCG3′. This cDNA was subcloned into pLexA(L) (7Lin W.-J. Gary J.D. Yang M.C. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15034-15044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) at an EcoRI/SalI site to create the “bait” plasmid pLexA(L)-PRMT1. pLexA(L) contains a leucine-selective marker and encodes a LexA fusion protein that will bind to the LexA operator sequence. A rat pPC86 cDNA library prepared from rat FAO hepatoma cell poly(A)+ mRNA (7Lin W.-J. Gary J.D. Yang M.C. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15034-15044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) was used as “prey” plasmids for the screen. These plasmids contain a tryptophan-selective marker and encode fusion proteins with the GAL4 transcription factor activation domain. Yeast two-hybrid screening to identify proteins that interact with PRMT1 was performed as described previously (7Lin W.-J. Gary J.D. Yang M.C. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15034-15044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Twenty-five cDNA clones showed positive interactions with PRMT1 in both histidine prototrophy and β-galactosidase assays. These 25 clones were separated into four groups by PCR amplification, restriction digestion analysis, and sequencing. 15 clones were identical to pPC86-PRMT1, 8 were identical to clone 2A, and the other 2 were independent clones 4A and 7A. Clones 2A, 4A, and 7A were sequenced using the Dye Deoxyterminator cycle sequencing kit and a 373 DNA sequencer (Perkin-Elmer). Homology searches were performed using the BLAST algorithm, through the National Center for Biotechnology Information (22Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70762) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of clone 2A revealed that it is an incomplete clone, lacking the 5′-end region encoding the amino-terminal end of the protein. To recover a cDNA encoding the entire open reading frame, a rat FAO cDNA library in Lambda-Zap vector was screened using a 700-base pair 5′-end fragment of 2A as a probe. A 2.4-kilobase pair cDNA insert was recovered in pBluescriptSK(−), between the EcoRI and XhoI sites, and sequenced using the dye cycle sequencing kit. This 2.4-kilobase pair cDNA clone corresponding to the 2A sequence is termed PRMT3. The cDNA region corresponding to the amino-terminal 184-amino acid fragment of PRMT3 cDNA was PCR-amplified using primers 5′GGTGGGTCGACCGCCATGTGTTCGCTGGCG3′ and 5′CCACAGGAAGACTCACTTCTTCG′3 and template pBluescript(SK)-PRMT3. The fragment was digested with SmaI and SalI and inserted into pGEX(SN)-PRMT3-(90–528) (see “Preparation of GST Fusion Proteins”) at SalI/SmaI sites. This reaction resulted in the GST-PRMT3 full-length fusion construct, pGEX(SN)-PRMT3. The full-length PRMT3 cDNA was removed from pGEX(SN)-PRMT3 with SalI and NotI and inserted into pPC86 to make pPC86-PRMT3. Plasmid pBTM117 encodes a LexA DNA binding domain and was used to create alternative bait constructs for yeast two-hybrid analysis (24Koerner T.J. Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Tzagoloff A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 477-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). pBTM117-PRMT3-(214–528) was constructed as follows: DNA for amino acids 214–528 was PCR-amplified using primers 5′GTCGACGAAGGATGGCGTCTACTTCAGCTC3′ and 5′TTGATTGGAGACTTGACC3′ from pPC86-PRMT3-(90–528). The amplified cDNA was cut withSalI and NotI and inserted into pBTM117, to create pBMT117-PRMT3-(214–528). pBTM117-PRMT3-(90–528) and pGAD425-PRMT3-(90–528) were constructed by inserting the PRMT3-(90–528) coding region from pPC86-PRMT3-(90–528) into pBTM117 and pGAD425 at the SalI and NotI sites. To analyze interactions, strain L40 was transformed with bait and prey plasmids in different combinations. The transformed yeast were plated on appropriate selective media and incubated at 30 °C. Individual colonies were patched and assayed for β-galactosidase activity. pGST-GAR was constructed by fusing the Schistosoma japonicum glutathioneS-transferase protein to the first 148 amino acids of human fibrillarin, a region containing 14 arginine residues in a glycine-rich region. The human fibrillarin coding sequence was PCR-amplified from a combined liver and spleen cDNA library and cloned into the GST fusion vector pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), utilizingBamHI and EcoRI restriction sites engineered into the PCR primers. The resulting construct, pGST-FIB, was digested withNheI and NdeI to remove the carboxyl-terminal portion of fibrillarin. The 5′-overhangs remaining from the digest were filled in with the Klenow large fragment polymerase, and the plasmid was religated and introduced into Escherichia coli DH5a cells (Life Technologies, Inc.). The multiple cloning site of pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was modified to accept cDNA fragments at SalI andNotI sites and termed pGEX(SN). To make pGEX(SN)-PRMT3-(184–528), the DNA encoding the sequence between these amino acids of PRMT3 was amplified from pPC86-PRMT3, using primers 5′GGTGGGTCGACCATGAAACAATTTGCTCAGGACTTT3′ and 5′TTGATTGGAGACTTGACC3′. The amplified fragment was digested withSalI and NotI and inserted into pGEX(SN) at theSalI/NotI sites. PGEX(SN)-PRMT3-(90–528) was constructed by inserting the PRMT3-(90–528) DNA sequence from pPC86-PRMT3-(90–528) into pGEX(SN) at theSalI/NotI sites. pGEX(SN)-PRMT1 and pGEX-RMT1 were described previously (7Lin W.-J.

Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12585-12594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). All GST fusion proteins were expressed and purified as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). SDS-PAGE analysis of each purified protein, with the exception of GST-GAR, indicated that only a single major band was visible by Coomassie staining. Although full-length GST-GAR is a 41-kDa polypeptide, the major methylated product electrophoreses as a broad band at apparent sizes of 28–36 kDa, with a major species at 28 kDa. In addition, a 14-kDa polypeptide is also methylated. These results suggest that the fusion protein may be sensitive to proteolysis during its expression or purification. Purified fusion proteins were stored at −80 °C. RAT1 cell lysate protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). Other protein samples were assayed using a modified Lowry procedure (23Bailey J.L. Techniques in Protein Chemistry. 2nd Ed. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1967: 340-341Google Scholar), after precipitation with 1 ml of 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. Bovine serum albumin was used as the standard for both procedures. Polyclonal antibodies against PRMT1 and PRMT3 were raised in rabbits, using TrpE fusion proteins as antigens. The cDNA for the TrpE-PRMT1 fusion protein was constructed as follows: cDNA of PRMT1 was PCR-amplified from pPC86-PRMT1, using the primers 5′CCCCGGAATTCATGGCGGCAGCCGAGGCC3′ and 5′GTCGACTCTAGAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGGCGCATCCGGTAGTCGGTGG3′. The amplified fragment was digested with EcoRI andXbaI and inserted into pATH11 (24Koerner T.J. Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Tzagoloff A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 477-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) to make pATH11-PRMT1. The plasmid for TrpE-PRMT3-(166–528) fusion protein expression, pATH11-PRMT3-(166–528), was constructed by inserting theXmaI and XbaI fragment of the PRMT3 (from base pair 575 to 2070 in the PRMT3 cDNA), in-frame, into pATH11. TrpE fusion proteins were expressed as described previously (24Koerner T.J. Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Tzagoloff A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 477-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Proteins from inclusion bodies were extracted with 6 m urea and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The fusion proteins were excised from the gel and electroeluted in 10 mm NaHCO3, 3 mm Na2CO3, pH 9.9, containing 0.06% SDS. The purified proteins, which appeared homogenous on SDS-PAGE, were used to immunize New Zealand White rabbits for antibody production (Cocalico Biologicals, Co., Reamstown, PA). The specificities of anti-PRMT1 and anti-PRMT3 antisera were analyzed in immunoblotting experiments, using RAT1 cell extracts (7Lin W.-J. Gary J.D. Yang M.C. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15034-15044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) and GST fusion proteins. Anti-PRMT1 antiserum recognized recombinant GST-PRMT1 but not GST-PRMT3-(90–528). Anti-PRMT3 antiserum recognized recombinant GST-PRMT3-(90–528) but not GST-PRMT1. The anti-PRMT1 antiserum recognized PRMT1 present in a RAT1 cell lysate as a 42-kDa band on SDS-PAGE. Immunoreactivity of the anti-PRMT1 antiserum with this 42-kDa antigen band was immunodepleted by GST-PRMT1 absorption but not by GST-PRMT3-(90–528) absorption. The anti-PRMT3 antiserum recognized a 60-kDa antigen in RAT1 cell extracts. Immunoreactivity was depleted from the anti-PRMT3 antiserum by absorption with GST-PRMT3-(90–528) fusion protein but not by absorption with GST-PRMT1 fusion protein. Total RNA from tissues was prepared using guanidinium thiocyanate phenol/chloroform (25Chomczymski P. Sacci N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA from PC12 cells was isolated using lithium chloride (26Cathala G. Savouret J. Mendez B. West B. Karin M. Martial J.A. Baxter J.D. Lab. Methods. 1983; 2: 329-335Google Scholar). RNA was subjected to electrophoresis and Northern blotting as described previously (9Montagnoli A. Guardavaccaro D. Starace G. Tirone F. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 1327-1336PubMed Google Scholar). RAT1 cells in four-cell chamber slides were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, 8.1 mmNa2HPO4, 137 mm NaCl, 2.6 mm KCl, pH 7.4) and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for 15 min, followed by a 15-min incubation in 2% PFA in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Alternatively, cells were fixed and permeabilized with 100% methanol for 15 min at −20 °C. The PFA-fixed cells were washed twice with PBS containing 0.1 mglycine and 0.1% Triton X-100 and then blocked with goat serum (1:20 dilution in PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20). For methanol fixation, cells were blocked with goat serum. After blocking, cells were incubated for 2 h in primary antibody dilutions (1:350 for anti-PRMT1, 1:200 for anti-PRMT3) in PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20 and goat serum diluted 1:50. Then cells were washed three times with PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20 and incubated in the secondary antibody solutions (1:100 diluted fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit IgG in PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20/and goat serum diluted 1:50). After 1 h, cells were washed four times in PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20 and mounted in fluoromount (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL) and examined with a Zeiss fluorescence microscope. To immunodeplete PRMT1 and PRMT3 antisera, GST-PRMT1 and GST-PRMT3-(90–528) were isolated with glutathione-Sepharose beads from 350-ml E. coli cultures. The beads with the absorbed GST proteins were resuspended in 100 μl of PBS, and 10 μl of anti-PRMT1 or anti-PRMT3 antisera was added. The mixtures were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. The supernatant fractions were recovered by passing the mixtures through 0.2-μm filters. Western blotting experiments demonstrated the specificity of immunodepletion. Hypomethylated yeast extract from S. cerevisiae rmt1 strain JDG9100-2, lacking the major yeast type I protein arginine N-methyltransferase, Rmt1, was prepared as described previously (17Gary J.D.

Specific conditions for the methylation reactions are described in the relevant figure legends. Reactions were terminated by the addition of an equal volume of SDS-containing sample buffer (30Lischwe M.A. Cook R.G. Ahn Y.S. Yeoman L.C. Busch H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6025-6028Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and heating to 100 °C for 5 min. Samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE (27Laemmli U.K. Favre M. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (3025) Google Scholar), Coomassie Brilliant Blue R staining, and fluorography as described previously (7Lin W.-J. Gary J.D. Yang M.C. Clarke S.

Protein samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting analysis as described previously (28Tang J. Bond J.S. Arch. Biochim. Biophys. 1998; 349: 192-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A yeast strain expressing the bait fusion protein LexA-PRMT1 was transformed with a cDNA library in which the GAL4 activation domain (GAL4AD) is fused to cDNAs from rat liver-derived FAO cells (7Lin W.-J.

Twenty-five positive cDNA plasmids were isolated and separated into four groups by PCR analysis, restriction digest analysis, and sequencing; PRMT1 (15 isolates), 2A (8 isolates), 4A (1 isolate), and 7A (1 isolate). Sequence analysis indicated that 4A is homologous to a yeast alcohol dehydrogenase, and 7A encodes a homologue of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored extracellular membrane protein involved in transcytosis in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. A BLAST search (22Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70762) Google Scholar) of protein sequence data bases indicated that the predicted open reading frame encoded by the 2A clone is closely related to mammalian PRMT1 (7Lin W.-J.

Biol. 1996; 16: 3668-3678Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Northern analysis of RNA from RAT1 fibroblast cells suggested that 2A is a truncated portion of a 2.4-kilobase pair transcript (data not shown). By using clone 2A as a probe, a longer cDNA was cloned from a RAT1 cDNA library. This cDNA encodes an open reading frame of 528 amino acids. Comparison of PRMT1 and the “2A” putative methyltransferase domain (amino acids 195 to 528) reveals 46% identity and 67% similarity at the amino acid level. The designation “PRMT2” already exists as a GenBankTM entry (U80213) for a cDNA that shares some sequence identity with PRMT1. This human sequence was named HRMT1L1 (19Katsanis N. Yaspo M.L. Fisher E.M. Mamm. Genome. 1997; 8: 526-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We have, therefore, named the polypeptide encoded by the full-length 2A transcript “protein argininemethyltranferase 3” or PRMT3. The high degree of identity among the Rmt1, PRMT1, and PRMT3 sequences suggests that PRMT3 might also be a protein arginineN-methyltransferase. The amino-terminal 194-amino acid fragment of PRMT3, which does not resemble any known protein, is rich in acidic amino acid residues. It is, therefore, called the N-terminal acidic amino acid-rich (NAR) domain of PRMT3. The PRMT3 NAR domain contains two functional motifs, a putative C2H2 zinc finger motif (Cys48–His69) and a tyrosine phosphorylation consensus sequence (Tyr85–Phe93) similar to the STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation site (29Shuai K. Schindler C. Prezioso V.R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1992; 258: 1808-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). A BLAST search identified two human EST sequences (AA307385 and H38113) closely related to rat PRMT3 cDNA. Sequencing confirmed thatAA307385 is the human PRMT3 orthologue but is missing the amino-terminal 10 amino acid residues (Fig. 1). At the amino acid level, human PRMT3 is 90% identical to rat PRMT3. Human PRMT3 contains the carboxyl-terminal putative methyltransferase domain and the amino-terminal NAR domain. GST-GAR is a recombinant protein arginine methyltransferase substrate containing the first 148 amino acids of the human fibrillarin protein, fused in-frame to GST. The amino-terminal region of fibrillarin contains 14 arginine residues, the majority of which are present in “RGG” consensus methylation sites (30Lischwe M.A. Cook R.G. Ahn Y.S. Yeoman L.C. Busch H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6025-6028Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 31Lapeyre B. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Bouche G. Amalric F.

GST-GAR is not methylated in E. coli, which lacks protein arginine methyltransferase activity (4Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2800-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). GST fusions of the asymmetrically methylating (type I) protein arginineN-methyltransferases from S. cerevisiae (Rmt1) and rat (PRMT1) catalyze the methylation of GST-GAR (Fig. 2 A). Recombinant GST-PRMT3 also catalyzes methylation of GST-GAR. Both monomethylated arginine and asymmetrically dimethylated arginine are present after acid hydrolysis of the GST-PRMT3 reaction product mixture (Fig. 2 B). A similar result is observed when GST-Rmt1 and GST-PRMT1 methylation products are analyzed (7Lin W.-J. Gary J.D. Yang M.C. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15034-15044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 17Gary J.D. Lin W.-J. Yang M.C. Herschman H.R. Clarke S. J. Biol.

The 3H-labeled amino acids elute just ahead of unlabeled standards, due to their increased molecular weight and slightly altered pI values (33Gottschling H. Freese E.

Twenty-four amino acid residues located on both the distal and the proximal surface of the molecule were chosen for mutagenesis. These 24 mutant proteins were expressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, purified, and characterized with respect to their ability to bind cytochrome <i>b</i> <sub>5</sub> and support substrate oxidation. Seven mutants, R122A, R126A, R133A, F135A, M137A, K139A, and K433A, all on the proximal surface of cytochrome P450 2B4 near the heme ligand, were identified that exhibited decreased ability to bind cytochrome<i>b</i> <sub>5</sub>. All of the mutants except K433A are located in either the C or C* helices or their termini. In addition, these seven mutants and two additional mutants on the proximal surface of cytochrome P450, R422A and R443A, were shown to exhibit decreased binding to cytochrome P450 reductase. These studies indicate that the binding sites for cytochrome <i>b</i> <sub>5</sub> and cytochrome P450 reductase are, as predicted, located on the proximal surface of cytochrome P450 2B4 and are partially overlapping but not identical."
https://openalex.org/W2013751209,"The resistance to stress-induced apoptosis conferred by the thermotolerant state or by exogenous expression of HSP72 was measured in mouse embryo fibroblasts. The induction of thermotolerance protects cells from heat, tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), and ceramide-induced apoptosis but not from ionizing radiation. Because the development of thermotolerance is associated with increased levels of heat shock proteins, we determined whether constitutive expression of one of the major inducible heat shock proteins, HSP72, could also protect cells from stress-induced apoptosis. Cells expressing constitutive HSP72 were shown to have significantly reduced levels of apoptosis after heat, TNFα, and ceramide but not after ionizing radiation. Activation of stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK) was found to be strongly inhibited in thermotolerant cells after heat shock but not after other stresses. Cells that constitutively express HSP72 did not demonstrate decreased SAPK/JNK activation after any of these stresses. Thus, factors other than HSP72 that are induced in the thermotolerant state are able to reduce activation of SAPK/JNK after heat stress. Notably, the level of activation of SAPK/JNK did not correlate with the amount of apoptosis detected after different stresses. Constitutive HSP72 expression inhibited poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage in cells after heat shock and TNFα but not after ceramide or ionizing radiation. The results suggest either that SAPK/JNK activation is not required for apoptosis in mouse embryo fibroblasts or that HSP72 acts downstream of SAPK/JNK. Furthermore, the data support the concept that caspase activity, which can be down-regulated by HSP72, is a crucial step in stress-induced apoptosis. Based on data presented here and elsewhere, we propose that the heat shock protein family can be classified as a class of anti-apoptotic genes, in addition to the Bcl-2 and inhibitor of apoptosis protein families of genes.

The regulation of normal development involves a combination of cell division, differentiation, and death. Although much emphasis was previously placed on mechanisms of cell cycle progression, mechanisms of cell death have only recently begun to be understood. Programmed cell death, or apoptosis, is an active process resulting in characteristic morphological changes to the cell including condensed regions of nuclear material, internucleosomal DNA cleavage, and membrane blebbing (1Wyllie A.H. Kerr J.F.R. Currie A.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1980; 68: 251-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (6728) Google Scholar). The fragmented chromatin, still membrane-bound, is phagocytosed by neighboring cells, thus avoiding an inflammatory response. Apoptosis is responsible for the removal of unwanted cells of many lineages and is thought to be an important safeguard against hyperplasia, which can be an early event in neoplasia (2Raff M.C. Nature. 1992; 356: 397-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar). Environmental stresses such as heat, radiation, and hypoxia; growth factors and ligands for surface receptors; and many drugs or chemical agents can induce apoptosis. Nevertheless, cells undergoing apoptosis exhibit a similar morphology, suggesting that these divergent apoptotic stimuli converge to trigger a common pathway of cell death. The common pathway involves a family of proteases known as the interleukin-1β-converting enzyme (ICE)-like 1The abbreviations used are: ICE, interleukin-1β-converting enzyme; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; HSP, heat shock protein; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblast(s); Gy, gray; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; p-NPP, p-nitrophenyl phosphate. proteases or caspases, which are activated in a proteolytic cascade to cleave specific substrates (3Chinnaiyan A.M. Dixit V.M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 555-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Zhivotovsky B. Burgess D.H. Orrenius S. Experientia. 1996; 52: 968-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). More recently, it has become evident that the transmission of signals from external stresses is accompanied by the activation of two families of kinases, the stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs), also known as the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), and the p38/HOG-1 kinases (5Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24313-24316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). Another possible signaling molecule in apoptotic pathways is the second messenger, ceramide. Increases in ceramide levels mediated by the activation of sphingomyelinase and consequent hydrolysis of sphingomyelin have been observed after exposure of cells to heat, radiation, TNFα, and peroxide (6Verheij M. Bose R. Lin X.H. Yao B. Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Birrer M.J. Szabo E. Zon L.I. Kyriakis J.M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. Nature. 1996; 380: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar). In addition, exogenously added ceramide induces apoptosis (7Jarvis W.D. Kolesnick R.N. Fornari F.A. Traylor R.S. Gewirtz D.A. Grant S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Thus, whereas the early signals appear to be specific to a particular stress or group of stresses, the subsequent events, such as the activation of the caspases and possibly the SAPKs and ceramide, are common events. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are a group of inducible proteins, some of which are constitutively expressed and increase in response to stress, whereas others are expressed only after stress (8Lindquist S. Craig E.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1988; 22: 631-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4438) Google Scholar). The constitutively expressed proteins act as chaperones for other cellular proteins, binding to nascent polypeptides to prevent premature folding and to translocate proteins into organelles (9Hartl F.U. Martin J. Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1992; 21: 293-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The induction of increased levels of the stress proteins is associated with the development of thermotolerance, a transient resistance to heat induced by prior exposure to mild heat or other stress agents (10Subjeck J.R. Sciandra J.J. Johnson R.J. Br. J. Radiol. 1982; 55: 579-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 11Li G.C. Werb Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3218-3222Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). It is apparent that induced stress proteins can act to protect cells from stress-induced damage by preventing protein denaturation and/or by repairing such damage (12Schroeder H. Langer T. Hartl F.U. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4137-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). One major group of HSP is the HSP70 family that comprises a multi-gene family with at least 11 genes in humans (13Tavaria M. Gabriele T. Kola I. Anderson R.L. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1996; 1: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) and 8 identified so far in the mouse (14Tavaria M. Kola I. Anderson R.L. Gething M.-J. Guidebook to Molecular Chaperones and Protein Folding Factors. Sambrook & Tooze Publications, Oxford University Press, New York1997: 49-52Google Scholar). We and others have shown previously that induction of thermotolerance with a parallel induction of HSP inhibits heat-induced apoptosis in several cell lines (15Mosser D.D. Martin L.H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 151: 561-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 16Strasser A. Anderson R.L. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1-7PubMed Google Scholar).

Cell Res. 1996; 223: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), from the cytotoxic effects of TNFα (21Jaattela M. Wissing D. Bauer P.A. Li G.C. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3507-3512Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), from monocyte killing (22Jaattela M. Wissing D. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), and from nitric oxide (23Bellmann K. Jaattela M. Wissing D. Burkart V. Kolb H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In some of these studies, however, it was not demonstrated whether the cells died by apoptosis after these stresses. As part of our investigation of pathways of stress-induced apoptosis, we have measured the effects of either induction of thermotolerance or constitutive expression of HSP72 in blocking apoptosis induced by external stresses. The protection provided by HSP72 against diverse apoptosis-inducing stresses that we have reported here and other data in the literature lead us to propose that the heat shock gene family represents another class of apoptosis-inhibiting genes. Mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) derived from Balb/c mice were minimally transformed with E1A and Ras as described previously (24Lowe S.W. Jacks T. Housman D.E. Ruley H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2026-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). To generate cells with constitutive HSP72 expression, clones were infected with the pMVH/human HSP72 proviral vector containing the 2.3-kilobase human HSP72 cDNA under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter (25Li G.C.

Cultures were single cell cloned, and HSP72 levels were determined by Western blotting. Except where specified, the high HSP72 expressing clone 2 cell line was used in experiments. MEF were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2atmosphere. Immediately prior to each experiment, the medium was replaced with fresh pH equilibrated medium. All experiments were performed on 50% confluent cell cultures. For heat shock treatments, cells were immersed in a circulating water bath calibrated to 43 ± 0.1 °C for 10–60 min. Lyophilized mouse TNFα (Sigma) was reconstituted in deionized H2O at 170 units/μl and diluted into culture medium at concentrations ranging from 50 to 500 units/ml. Human TNFα, a kind gift from Dr. A. Strasser, was diluted into culture medium at concentrations ranging from 100 to 1000 ng/ml. C2-ceramide (N-acetyl-d-sphingosine, Sigma) was initially dissolved in ethanol at 100 mm and aliquoted into serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium before being diluted into culture medium. Concentrations of ceramide ranged from 25 to 100 μm. Control cultures were supplemented with an equivalent amount of ethanol. Cells were subjected to ionizing radiation (5–15 Gy) from a cesium source (0.77 Gy/min). After treatment, cells were allowed to recover at 37 °C for various times. Nuclear morphology was assessed by fluorescence microscopy after propidium iodide staining. Briefly, flasks containing approximately 3 × 106 cells were trypsinized, centrifuged at 1000 rpm, and resuspended in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 μg/ml propidium iodide, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% sodium acetate. Samples were incubated on ice for 30 min in the dark before being scored for apoptotic morphology using a fluorescence microscope. A cell was scored as apoptotic if it displayed one or more of the following: nuclear margination, chromatin condensation, or formation of apoptotic bodies. At least 200 cells were counted in each experiment, and the data shown are the means and standard deviation of at least three independent experiments. HSP72 expression in cells was detected using a mouse monoclonal antibody specific for human HSP72 (N15, a kind gift from Dr. W. Welch) or with an antibody that detects both human and mouse HSP72 (SPA-810, StressGen Biotechnologies). The cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) from a 116-kDa protein to an 85-kDa fragment was detected using a mouse monoclonal antibody, C-2–10 (a kind gift from Dr. S. Kaufmann), which recognizes both the full-length and the 85-kDa fragment. Samples containing equal amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose. The membranes were incubated with C-2–10, SPA-810, or N15 antibody, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG and ECL chemiluminescence for PARP or alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and color staining for HSP72. As a loading control, membranes were immunostained with an anti-α-tubulin antibody (clone B-5–1-2, Sigma) and detected by a color reaction using an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody. SAPK/JNK activity was assayed in vitro using a bacterially expressed glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-c-Jun (1–141) fusion protein as a substrate (26Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar). GST-c-Jun was bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads and maintained as a 10% slurry in phosphate-buffered saline/sodium azide. Cells were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in PLC buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 15 mm p-NPP, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated on ice for 10 min. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation (13,000 rpm, 4 °C, 10 min). The supernatant was collected, and SAPK/JNK was immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse JNK1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Samples were resuspended in PLC buffer and incubated with GST-c-Jun-Sepharose beads for 15 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed twice in kinase buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 15 mm p-NPP) and resuspended in kinase reaction buffer (kinase buffer containing 60 μm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 30 mm p-NPP, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP). The kinase reaction was performed at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by washing the beads in PLC buffer supplemented with 20 mm EDTA and 15 mm p-NPP. The beads were resuspended in 2× Laemmli gel sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Samples were subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, stained with Coomassie Blue, destained, dried, and phosphorylation of c-Jun measured by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics). MEF were treated with a mild heat shock (44 °C for 10 min) to induce thermotolerance and allowed to recover at 37 °C for 6 h before being subjected to more severe heat shock, ceramide, TNFα, or ionizing radiation. Cells were scored for apoptotic morphology under a fluorescence microscope following permeabilization and staining with propidium iodide. As shown in Fig. 1 A, cells in a thermotolerant state showed significant decreases in apoptosis after heat shock, ceramide, and TNFα but not after ionizing radiation. The thermotolerant state protected cells from apoptosis after a range of heat doses (Fig. 1 B) or TNFα doses (Fig. 1 C). The induction of thermotolerance induces high levels of HSP72 (Fig. 2).Figure 2Levels of expression of HSP72 in the parental MEF, HSP72 infected clones, thermotolerant MEF, and thermotolerant HSP72 clone 2 cells. MEF were given a mild heat shock at 44 °C for 10 min and allowed to recover for 6 h to induce thermotolerance. Proteins from parental MEF (Control), clones with constitutive HSP72 expression (Clone 2 andClone 3), thermotolerant cells (TT), and thermotolerant clone 2 cells (Clone 2 TT) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted with a mouse monoclonal antibody that detects both mouse and human HSP72 (SPA-810) followed by an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because the development of thermotolerance closely correlates with the induction of HSP72, it was decided to investigate whether constitutive expression of HSP72 alone could protect MEF from stress-induced apoptosis. MEF were infected with HSP72 and single cell cloned, and a number of clones expressing human HSP72 were isolated. The highest HSP72 expressing clone, clone 2, has less HSP72 than is measured in thermotolerant MEF but more than is expressed by clone 3 (Fig. 2). Control and HSP72 expressing cells were treated either with heat shock, ceramide, TNFα, or ionizing radiation as described above, stained with propidium iodide, and scored for apoptotic morphology. As shown in Fig. 3, cells expressing constitutive HSP72 are protected from heat shock-, ceramide-, and TNFα-induced apoptosis but not from ionizing radiation. Although we found that HSP72 does protect the cells from heat stress, we found greater protection from TNFα- and ceramide-induced apoptosis. Also shown in Fig. 3 is the response of clone 2 cells to heat or TNFα after the induction of thermotolerance. The level of HSP72 increases further after induction of thermotolerance in clone 2 but is similar to the level induced in the parental MEF (Fig. 2). Cells expressing both high levels of HSP72 and thermotolerance are more resistant to heat stress than those expressing HSP72 alone (Fig. 3 A), whereas the response to TNFα (Fig. 3 B) is similar to that of HSP72 expressing cells. Thus the protection from heat-induced apoptosis afforded by the thermotolerant state cannot be attributed solely to the induction of HSP72, whereas protection from TNFα-induced apoptosis in thermotolerant cells can be fully accounted for by the expression of HSP72. The level of expression of HSP72 determined the extent of resistance to apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 3 (A and B), clone 3, which expresses less HSP72 than clone 2 (Fig. 2), has less resistance to heat- and TNFα-induced apoptosis. In other retrovirally infected clones expressing less HSP72 than seen in clone 3, no protection against stress-induced apoptosis was detected (data not shown). In summary, protection was only seen in cells expressing moderate to high levels of HSP72, indicating that the process of infection with the retrovirus alone has not altered the response of the cells to stress. The strong protection against TNFα-induced apoptosis afforded by the expression of HSP72 led us to consider other members of the TNF receptor superfamily. To check whether the p55 or p75 TNF receptor was active in MEF, we measured the extent of apoptosis induced by human TNFα. MEF were sensitive to human TNFα, and the toxicity was blocked by HSP72 (Fig. 3 E). This indicates that apoptosis is mediated through the p55 TNF receptor since the p75 TNF receptor does not bind human TNFα. We also tested for sensitivity of MEF to apoptosis induced by binding of antibody or ligand to Fas or binding of Trail to the Trail receptor, other receptors in the TNF receptor family. MEF do not express Fas in amounts detectable by antibody binding, nor do they show signs of toxicity after incubation in either anti-Fas antibody, Fas ligand, or Trail ligand (data not shown). The activation of the SAPK/JNK cascade detected after a number of cytotoxic insults has been proposed to be required for apoptosis (6Verheij M. Bose R. Lin X.H. Yao B. Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Birrer M.J. Szabo E. Zon L.I. Kyriakis J.M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. Nature. 1996; 380: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar). To determine whether the thermotolerant state was protecting MEF from stress-induced apoptosis through the inhibition of this pathway, SAPK/JNK activity was measured by an in vitro kinase assay using a GST-c-Jun (1–141) fusion protein as a substrate. Time courses were performed after each stress to determine optimum times for detecting SAPK/JNK activity. Maximal activity was detected at 30 min after heat shock and TNFα. MEF show a 10–15-fold activation of SAPK/JNK after heat shock and 2–3-fold activation after TNFα. Data shown for ceramide and ionizing radiation were obtained 1 h after stress; however, little SAPK/JNK activation was detected in MEF after ceramide and ionizing radiation over a 24-h period. Using these conditions, SAPK/JNK activity was measured in control and thermotolerant cells. Significant reduction of SAPK/JNK activity in thermotolerant cells after heat shock was observed, but no changes in activity were detected after other stresses (Fig. 4 A). Because the thermotolerant state was shown to reduce SAPK/JNK activation after heat shock but not after other stresses, the effect of HSP72 expression on SAPK/JNK activity was measured. Control and HSP72 expressing cells were subjected to heat shock, ceramide, TNFα, or ionizing radiation and SAPK/JNK activity measured. As shown in Fig. 4 B, HSP72 did not reduce SAPK/JNK activation after any of these stresses, despite protecting the cells from apoptosis. A common event in the apoptotic pathway is the activation of a caspase cascade. PARP, a DNA repair enzyme, has been identified as a substrate for caspase-3. Caspase-3 activity was measured by following the cleavage of PARP from a 116-kDa protein to an 85-kDa fragment. PARP cleavage is first detected in MEF cells 6 h after stress but is more extensive at 16 h after heat, ceramide, and TNFα or 24 h after ionizing radiation (data not shown). We examined the possibility that the thermotolerant state may inhibit PARP cleavage either directly or by regulating some upstream event in the caspase cascade. MEF were treated with heat shock, ceramide, TNFα, or ionizing radiation and allowed to recover for 16 or 24 h. Cell extracts were subjected to immunoblotting with a PARP-specific antibody that recognizes both the 116- and 85-kDa fragments. As shown in Fig. 5 A, the induction of thermotolerance can reduce PARP cleavage after heat shock, TNFα, and ceramide but not after ionizing radiation. Measurement of α-tubulin levels demonstrates equal protein loading in each lane. To determine whether HSP72 could mimic the effect of thermotolerance on PARP cleavage, MEF were treated with heat shock, ceramide, TNFα, or ionizing radiation, and immunoblotting was performed on cell extracts. As found for the thermotolerant state, constitutive HSP72 expression reduced PARP cleavage in cells after heat shock and TNFα but not after exposure to ceramide or ionizing radiation (Fig. 5 B). Many forms of cellular stress lead to the activation of two related signaling pathways mediated by the stress-activated protein kinases, SAPK/JNK and p38/HOG-1 (5Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24313-24316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). The SAPK/JNKs, which are activated by a kinase known as Sek1, comprise a family of eight or more isoforms that phosphorylate the c-Jun and JunD components of the AP1 transcription factor as well as Elk-1 and ATF-2. ATF-2 is also a substrate for p38/HOG-1, as is MAPKAP kinase-2, which in turn phosphorylates the heat shock protein, HSP27, at the same sites at which it is phosphorylated in response to stress (5Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24313-24316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). Many stresses capable of activating SAPK/JNK, including heat shock, TNFα, ceramide, UV light, ionizing radiation, osmotic stress, and anti-cancer agents, also result in apoptosis (reviewed in Ref. 5Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24313-24316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). Despite the observation that SAPK/JNK activation and apoptosis are often co-incident, there is strong debate about the requirement of SAPK/JNK activation for apoptosis. Stable transfection of dominant negative mutants of either Sek1 or c-Jun (TAM-67) has been shown to inhibit apoptosis after ionizing radiation, ceramide, UVC light, heat shock, and hydrogen peroxide (6Verheij M. Bose R. Lin X.H. Yao B. Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Birrer M.J. Szabo E. Zon L.I. Kyriakis J.M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. Nature. 1996; 380: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar). In contrast, studies performed in Sek1 (−/−) ES cells demonstrated a normal apoptotic response after ionizing radiation, UV light, osmotic stress, serum deprivation, anisomycin, heat shock, dexamethasone, and anti-cancer agents, although thymocytes from Sek1 (−/−) mice showed impaired Fas-induced apoptosis (27Nishina H. Fischer K.D. Radvanyi L. Shahinian A. Hakem R. Rubie E.A. Bernstein A. Mak T.W. Woodgett J.R. Penninger J.M. Nature. 1997; 3385: 350-353Crossref Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Controversy surrounds the involvement of SAPK/JNK activation in TNFα-induced apoptosis, with studies claiming that a catalytically inactive MAPKKK (ASK1), which no longer activates SAPK/JNK and p38/HOG-1 (28Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dijke P. Saitoh M. moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. Miyazono K. Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (2037) Google Scholar), can inhibit TNFα-induced apoptosis, as can either Sek1 or TAM67 dominant negative mutants (6Verheij M. Bose R. Lin X.H. Yao B. Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Birrer M.J. Szabo E. Zon L.I. Kyriakis J.M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. Nature. 1996; 380: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar). In contrast, other studies have shown that SAPK/JNK activation occurs through a pathway that is not required for TNFα-induced apoptosis (29Natoli G. Costanzo A. Ianni A. Templeton D.J. Woodgett J.R. Balsano C. Levrero M. Science. 1997; 275: 200-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 30Liu Z. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar). In our study, we have shown that the thermotolerant state or constitutive expression of HSP72 can protect cells from apoptosis induced by heat, TNFα, and ceramide but not from ionizing radiation, thus demonstrating the existence of multiple pathways of stress-induced apoptosis. It is interesting to note that HSP72, which is widely believed to protect cells from heat stress, prevents heat-induced apoptosis to a lesser extent than TNFα- or ceramide-induced apoptosis. Further, the protection seen in thermotolerant cells after TNFα and ceramide can be accounted for by the induction of HSP72, whereas the induction of thermotolerance provides a significantly higher level of protection against heat-induced apoptosis than can be accounted for by HSP72 alone. An explanation for this may lie in the fact that heat is a nonspecific stress that causes damage to many proteins and organelles in the cell, and thus multiple targets need to be protected from heat stress. HSP72 may be able to protect some of these targets, but the induction of other stress proteins may be required for more complete protection. In contrast, TNFα initiates apoptosis through a specific pathway that begins with the activation of TNF receptors. HSP72 could act at one stage of this pathway to minimize the extent to which apoptosis is triggered by TNFα. The possibility that HSP72 may regulate stress-induced apoptosis through inhibition of the SAPK/JNK pathway was investigated, but expression of HSP72 was found to not alter the extent of activation of SAPK/JNK. In addition, we found that the extent of SAPK/JNK activation after the different stresses did not correlate with the extent of apoptosis observed, possibly indicating that SAPK/JNK activation is not required for the induction of apoptosis in MEF. Alternatively, SAPK/JNK activation may be necessary but is not sufficient for apoptosis to occur. We therefore conclude either that MEF can undergo stress-induced apoptosis using a SAPK/JNK-independent pathway that can be regulated by HSP72 or that HSP72 acts downstream of SAPK/JNK activation. Interestingly, SAPK/JNK was inhibited in thermotolerant cells after heat shock but not in cells expressing constitutive HSP72. This supports the finding that thermotolerance provides a substantially higher level of protection against heat-induced apoptosis than HSP72 alone, suggesting that factors other than HSP72 that are induced in the thermotolerant state are capable of suppressing SAPK/JNK activation. An expanding family of cysteine proteases (caspases), of which ICE is the prototype, has been shown to play a key role in mammalian cell apoptosis. The caspases can be divided into three main groups based on sequence similarity: ICE, ICErel 11/Tx/ICH-2 and ICErel 111/Ty; CPP32/Yama/apopain/prICE, ICE-LAP3/MCH3 and MCH2; and finally, Nedd2/ICH-1 (4Zhivotovsky B. Burgess D.H. Orrenius S. Experientia. 1996; 52: 968-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Overexpression of any one of these enzymes induces apoptosis in transfected cells (31Miura M. Zhu H. Rotello R. Hartwieg E.A. Yuan J. Cell. 1993; 75: 653-660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar, 32Kumar S. Harvey N.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Evidence is emerging that multiple caspases may function sequentially after induction of apoptosis in a cell (33Enari M. Talanian R.V. Wong W.W. Nagats S. Nature. 1996; 380: 723-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). A number of substrates have now been identified, including other caspases, proteins involved in DNA repair (PARP and DNA-protein kinase) and some structural proteins (lamin, actin, and vimentin) (4Zhivotovsky B. Burgess D.H. Orrenius S. Experientia. 1996; 52: 968-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), but the importance of some of these substrates in apoptosis is not clear. We investigated the possibility that HSP72 could inhibit stress-induced apoptosis through the regulation of the caspase pathway. Caspase-3 activity can be measured by following the cleavage of PARP from a 116-kDa protein to an 85-kDa fragment. We have shown that constitutive HSP72 expression can prevent PARP cleavage after heat shock or TNFα but not after ceramide or ionizing radiation. The lack of protection of PARP by HSP72 after ceramide exposure is surprising because HSP72 does protect against ceramide-induced apoptosis. The data suggest that HSP72 acts to block the activation or the activity of one of the caspases and/or to protect the substrates of these caspases from proteolytic degradation. The possibility that HSP72 acts as a decoy substrate for the caspases was investigated by Mosser et al. (19Mosser D.D. Caron A.W. Bourget L. Denis-Larose C. Massie B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5317-5327Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar), but they found that HSP72 was unable to inhibit the caspase-3-mediated cleavage of PARP in an in vitro assay. Of interest in this study was the marked protection by HSP72 from TNFα-induced apoptosis, mediated through the p55 TNF receptor. While triggering apoptosis in many cells, TNFα also activates the transcription factor NF-κB that blocks apoptosis (30Liu Z. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar). How HSP72 may interact with this pathway is unknown, but in WEHI-S cells, the expression of HSP72 does not alter the TNF-induced activation of NF-κB, nor does it alter TNF receptor levels (34Jaattela M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 4286-4294PubMed Google Scholar). Instead, HSP72 inhibits TNF-induced activation of phospholipase A2, which releases arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids (34Jaattela M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 4286-4294PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown previously that arachidonic acid is released in response to TNF in sensitive cells but not in TNF-resistant cells (35Neale M.L. Fiera A. Matthews N. Immunology. 1988; 64: 81-86PubMed Google Scholar). Two other families of genes that block apoptosis have been identified. The inhibitor of apoptosis protein family, first recognized as the candidate gene for spinal muscular atrophy, can block apoptosis induced by a number of stresses (36Liston P. Roy N. Tamai K. Lefebvre C. Baird S. Cherton-Horvat G. Farahani R. McLean M. Ikeda J.-E. MacKenzie A. Korneluk R.G. Nature. 1996; 379: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar, 37Uren A.G. Pakusch M. Hawkins C.J. Puls K.L. Vaux D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4974-4978Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 38Dorstyn L. Kumar S. Cell Death Differ. 1997; 4: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The best characterized inhibitors of apoptosis are Bcl-2 and several of its homologues, which can block apoptosis in response to a large number of, but not all, stimuli (39Kroemer G. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which Bcl-2 and its homologues block apoptosis is not clear; however it has been suggested that Bcl-XL prevents disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential that otherwise permits the release of apoptosis-inducing proteins into the cytosol (40Vander Heiden M.G. Chandel N.S. Williamson E.K. Schumacker P.T. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1997; 91: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 blocks the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria that occurs following apoptotic stimuli but prior to membrane depolarization. This in turn prevents the interaction between cytochrome c and Apaf-1 and subsequent caspase activation and apoptosis (41Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T. Lones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4422) Google Scholar, 42Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4289) Google Scholar). It is feasible that HSP72 may protect cells from apoptosis through a similar mechanism; either through the inhibition of cytochrome c release from the mitochondria, or, more likely, by binding directly to cytosolic cytochromec and preventing activation of the caspases. HSP72 is known to bind to peptides derived from cytochrome c (43Greene L.E. Zinner R. Naficy S. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2967-2973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Heat shock proteins have been recognized for some years to protect cells from heat damage and more recently from some other cytotoxic insults. As well as the protective effects of HSP72 shown here and in other studies (17Li W.X. Chen C.H. Ling C.C. Li G.C. Radiat.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) the small heat shock protein, HSP27, has been shown to block apoptosis induced by Fas/Apo-1 and staurosporine (44Mehlen P. Schulze-Osthoff K. Arrigo A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16510-16514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar) and by some anti-cancer drugs (20Samali A. Cotter T.G. Exp.

Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2661-2667PubMed Google Scholar). Heat shock proteins are often expressed at high levels in tumor cells, leading to suggestions that they can protect cells either from immune attack or from the type of therapy being administered. For example, several recent studies have revealed that tumor specimens from patients whose cancer therapy has resulted in a short disease-free survival contain high levels of one or more of the stress proteins (46Ciocca D.R.

Emerging clones of tumor cells would be subjected to host initiated stresses such as TNF and may show prolonged survival if they express high levels of HSP72. Thus, we believe there is evidence to suggest that high levels of heat shock proteins may confer a survival advantage on an emerging or metastasizing clone of neoplastic cells by protecting it from immune surveillance and other host-derived stresses. We therefore propose that the heat shock gene family represents a third class of anti-apoptosis genes. We thank Dr. S. Kaufmann for the anti-PARP antibody, C-2–10; Dr. W. Welch for the anti-human HSP72 antibody, N15; Dr. G. Li for the pMVH human HSP72 proviral vector; and Dr. A. Strasser for human TNFα and Trail ligand. We also acknowledge Dr. D.

https://openalex.org/W2018847450,"Integrin-basement membrane interactions provide essential signals that promote survival and growth of epithelial cells, whereas loss of such adhesions triggers programmed cell death. We found that HSC-3 human squamous carcinoma cells survived and grew readily as monolayers, but when they were suspended as single cells, they ceased proliferating and entered into the apoptotic death pathway, characterized by DNA fragmentation. In contrast, if the suspended carcinoma cells were permitted to form E-cadherin-mediated multicellular aggregates, they not only survived but proliferated. However, aggregated normal keratinocytes were unable to survive in suspension culture and rapidly became apoptotic. Anchorage independence and resistance to apoptosis of HSC-3 cell aggregates required high levels of extracellular Ca2+ and was inhibited with function-perturbing anti-E-cadherin antibody. Resistance to suspension-induced apoptosis in cell aggregates paralleled the up-regulation of Bcl-2 but occurred in the absence of focal adhesion kinase activation. Analysis of suspension-induced death in a set of cloned squamous epithelial cell lines with different levels of E-cadherin expression revealed that receptor-positive cell clones evaded apoptosis and proliferated in three-dimensional aggregate culture, whereas cadherin-negative clones failed to survive. Collectively, these observations indicate that cadherin-mediated intercellular adhesions generate a compensatory mechanism that promotes anchorage-independent growth and suppresses apoptosis. Integrin-basement membrane interactions provide essential signals that promote survival and growth of epithelial cells, whereas loss of such adhesions triggers programmed cell death. We found that HSC-3 human squamous carcinoma cells survived and grew readily as monolayers, but when they were suspended as single cells, they ceased proliferating and entered into the apoptotic death pathway, characterized by DNA fragmentation. In contrast, if the suspended carcinoma cells were permitted to form E-cadherin-mediated multicellular aggregates, they not only survived but proliferated. However, aggregated normal keratinocytes were unable to survive in suspension culture and rapidly became apoptotic. Anchorage independence and resistance to apoptosis of HSC-3 cell aggregates required high levels of extracellular Ca2+ and was inhibited with function-perturbing anti-E-cadherin antibody. Resistance to suspension-induced apoptosis in cell aggregates paralleled the up-regulation of Bcl-2 but occurred in the absence of focal adhesion kinase activation. Analysis of suspension-induced death in a set of cloned squamous epithelial cell lines with different levels of E-cadherin expression revealed that receptor-positive cell clones evaded apoptosis and proliferated in three-dimensional aggregate culture, whereas cadherin-negative clones failed to survive. Collectively, these observations indicate that cadherin-mediated intercellular adhesions generate a compensatory mechanism that promotes anchorage-independent growth and suppresses apoptosis. In stratifying normal epithelium, proliferation is largely confined to the basal layer of cells attached to the basement membrane, and as the cells move to the suprabasal layers, they undergo terminal differentiation. This anchorage-dependent growth requires integrin-mediated signaling generated by cellular contact with extracellular matrix (ECM) 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; poly-HEMA, poly(2-hydroxyethyl methylacrylate); MCA, multicellular aggregate; PCD, programmed cell death; mAb, monoclonal antibody; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; bp, base pair(s); TUNEL, terminal deoxyuridine nucleotide end labeling. ligands (1Giancotti F.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 691-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). When anchorage is lost, normal epithelial cells undergo programmed cell death (2Frisch S.M. Ruoslahti E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar). Apoptosis is a genetically controlled response for cells to commit suicide. The terms apoptosis and programmed cell death are often used interchangeably to describe a mechanism of cellular death that is believed to play an important role in a wide variety of physiological situations and that, when dysregulated, can contribute to the pathogenesis of many diseases. However, in certain pathologic conditions such as psoriasis, dysplasia, and neoplasia, there is evidence of suprabasal proliferation when cells are no longer in direct contact with the basement membrane (3Leigh I.M. Navsaria H. Purkis P.E. McKay I.A. Bowden P.E. Riddle P.N. Br. J. Dermatol. 1995; 133: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 4Kotelnikov V.M. Coon J.S. Taylor S. Hutchinson J. Panje W.

Virol. 1997; 78: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This raises the question: what factors promote the growth of tumor cells in the absence of ECM anchorage? One possibility is cadherin-mediated cell-cell contacts. The cadherins are cell-surface membrane proteins that mediate homophilic calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion, which is crucial for the structural organization and differentiation of cells (6Takeichi M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar, 7Grunwald G.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 797-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 8Geiger B. Ayalon O. Annu. Rev. Cell. Biol. 1992; 8: 307-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). It is interesting that integrin and cadherin receptors have many parallels beyond their common role in regulating cell adhesion: both couple to the actin cytoskeleton to form adhesion plaque structures, both require divalent cations for activity, and both transduce intracellular signals when engaged. Several studies have examined epithelial anchorage dependence in terms of connections between integrin signaling and apoptosis-regulating genes (9Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2788) Google Scholar, 10Boudreau N. Sympson C.J. Werb Z. Bissell M.J. Science. 1995; 267: 891-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar). Pelusoet al. (11Peluso J.J. Pappalardo A. Trolice M.P. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1196-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) reported that N-cadherin-mediated cell contacts inhibit granulosa cell apoptosis. However, to date, little is known about whether cadherin-mediated cell-cell contacts can regulate cell growth. In view of the established role for E-cadherin in morphology and function and our initial observations that suspended squamous epithelial cells form compacted multicellular aggregates, we hypothesized that cadherin-mediated cell-cell contacts could substitute for integrin-ECM adhesion to prevent apoptosis and promote growth in anchorage-deprived cells. The overall goals of the present study were to determine whether epithelial cell-cell adhesion can prevent suspension-induced apoptosis and whether these interactions can facilitate anchorage-independent growth. We show that squamous carcinoma cells can use either cell-substrate or cell-cell adhesion for survival and growth. In the case of cell-substrate interactions, growth information is transmitted via integrin receptors, whereas cell-cell contacts appear to generate survival and proliferation cues through cadherins. Presumably, the overlapping information transduced by both types of adhesion receptors requires receptor-induced cytoskeletal organization and concurrent change in cell shape (i.e., spreading and compaction, respectively). The signals transduced by integrins are just now being identified, but cadherin-based signals are yet to be defined. Whether cells are susceptible or resistant to apoptosis induced by loss of anchorage is a potentially crucial step during tumor progression. We conclude that cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion is a novel mechanism by which epithelial cells can regulate cell growth and programmed cell death. The human oral squamous carcinoma cell lines HSC-3 and HOC-313 have been described previously (12Matsumoto K. Horikoshi M. Rikimaru M. Enomoto S. Oral Pathol. Med. 1989; 18: 498-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Both cell lines are tumorigenic in nude mice (13Matsumoto K. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. Kramer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31807-31813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with insulin, transferrin, and selenium (Life Technologies, Inc.). HOC-313 cells were cloned by serial dilution of a single-cell suspension plated in 96-well plates. Single-cell clones were randomly selected for further culture. Human neonatal foreskin keratinocytes were isolated and cultured as described previously (14Zhang K. Kim J.P. Woodley D.T. Waleh N.S. Chen Y.Q. Kramer R.H. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1996; 4: 159-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The keratinocytes were plated in tissue culture dishes and maintained in serum-free keratinocyte growth medium (Clonetics Corp., San Diego, CA). The medium was changed every 3 days. Cells from passages 2–5 were used for the experiments. Cell monolayer cultures were prepared by seeding 6 × 105 cells in tissue culture dishes (10 cm; Falcon). For the culture of HSC-3 and HOC-313 cells in suspension, monolayers were briefly treated with EDTA to prepare single cells. To generate multicellular aggregates (MCAs), cells were then plated on polyhydroxylethyl-methacrylate (poly-HEMA)-coated 60-mm dishes (6 × 105 cells/dish) in the presence of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with insulin, transferrin, and selenium. To produce suspended single cell cultures, cells were then suspended in semisolid medium consisting of insulin, transferrin, and selenium/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1.5% methylcellulose (Sigma) at 6 × 105 cells/10 cm poly-HEMA-coated dishes. Keratinocytes were processed for multicellular aggregation by briefly treating monolayers with trypsin-EDTA to prepare single cells, which were then plated on poly-HEMA-coated dishes (6 × 105 cells/6-cm dish) in the presence of serum-free keratinocyte growth medium supplemented with 1 mmCa2+ for 24 h. Single-cell suspension cultures of keratinocytes were prepared as above, but semisolid medium supplemented with 1 mm Ca2+ was used. To measure [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA, 6 × 105 cells were plated on dishes as described above; 1 mCi [3H]thymidine was added to each of the dishes at selected time periods, and the cells were labeled for 24-h periods. The dishes were washed three times with Hanks' balanced salt solution, and cells were collected by centrifugation. The cell pellet was extracted with 2 ml of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, the washed pellet was dissolved in 0.1 ml formic acid, and radioactivity was determined in a scintillation counter. Data are expressed as the mean of six dishes. Multicellular aggregates were assayed for growth by determining the total number of cells in the MCA cultures, using the method described by Freyer and Sutherland (15Freyer J.P. Sutherland R.M. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 3504-3512PubMed Google Scholar). Cells (6 × 105) were plated in tissue culture dishes as monolayer, suspended single-cell, or MCA cultures. At selected times, cells were collected and processed for counting using a hemocytometer. Results are expressed as the mean of three dishes. To assay for intranucleosomal DNA cleavage, low molecular weight genomic DNA was extracted with 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and then phenol-chloroform extracted three times and precipitated with ethanol. Samples were then analyzed in a 1.5% agarose gel with 0.25 μg/ml ethidium bromide, visualized by UV fluorescence, and photographed (9Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2788) Google Scholar). Cells were grown as monolayers, suspended single cells, or MCAs for 72 h. Cells were then collected from poly-HEMA dishes by pipetting or from tissue culture dishes by scraping into the medium in which they had been incubated. In monolayer cultures, floating cells were collected and combined with the attached cells before DNA extraction. The suspended single cells and MCAs from 72-h cultures were collected, fixed in freshly prepared paraformaldehyde buffered with 0.1 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), and embedded in agar (1%). The agar blocks were dehydrated with graded ethanols and embedded in paraffin according to standard procedures. The technique for in situ visualization of DNA fragmentation was carried out according to the method described by Moriet al. (16Mori C. Nakamura N. Okamoto Y. Osawa M. Shiota K. Anat. Embryol. 1994; 190: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), which was a modification of the one developed by Gavrieli et al. (17Gavrieli Y. Sherman Y. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (9167) Google Scholar) using a commercially available kit (MBL Laboratories, Watertown, MA). After staining, samples were processed for examination with a Nikon fluorescence microscope using filters for fluorescein isothiocyanate and rhodamine. For analysis of divalent cations, HSC-3 monolayers, suspended single cells and MCAs were seeded at 6 × 105 cells/plate in the presence Ca2+- and Mg+2-free insulin, transferrin, and selenium/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, which was supplemented with high (1 mm) or low (0.09 mm) levels of divalent cations by addition of CaCl2 and MgCl2 at the indicated concentrations. To study the effect of blocking antibody to E-cadherin, HSC-3 cells were seeded at 6 × 105 cells/plate in the presence of mouse anti-human E-cadherin mAb (clone SHE78-7, Zymed Laboratories) at 1 μg/ml and incubated for up to 72 h (18Katayama M. Hirai S. Yasumoto M. Nishikawa K. Nagata S. Otsuka M. Kamihagi K. Kato I. Int. J. Oncol. 1994; 5: 1049-1057PubMed Google Scholar, 19Watabe M. Nagafuchi A. Tsukita S. Takeichi M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Mouse IgG added to monolayer, single cell, and MCA cultures at 1 μg/ml was used as control. [3H]Thymidine incorporation and DNA ladder assays were performed with the cell cultures as described above. We estimated levels of cadherins, Bcl-2, and activation level of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) by immunoblotting. Protein lysates were processed for immunoprecipitation with mouse anti-human Bcl-2 antibody (ascites, Dako) and antibody against FAK (2A7, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Immune complexes were recovered with protein A-agarose (13Matsumoto K. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. Kramer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31807-31813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (13Matsumoto K. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. Kramer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31807-31813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates or total cellular lysates were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, were transferred to Immobilon membranes, and probed with E9 anti-E-cadherin monoclonal antibody (from Dr. Caroline Damsky, University of California, San Francisco), anti-human P-cadherin monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories), anti-human N-cadherin polyclonal antibody (Zymed Laboratories), anti-human Bcl-2 antibody (Dako) or anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Py20, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Immunoreactive bands were visualized using ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The HSC-3 squamous epithelial cells proliferate rapidly in conventional monolayer culture even in the absence of serum (Fig. 1 A). However, when HSC-3 cells were deprived of their anchorage by suspension in methylcellulose as single cells in poly-HEMA-coated dishes, they failed to proliferate and were unable to incorporate [3H]thymidine. In contrast to single cells in suspension, HSC-3 cells that were permitted to form MCAs in suspension were able to proliferate, as assessed by incorporation of [3H]thymidine and corresponding increase in total cell number (Fig. 1, B and C). Similar results were obtained with the MTT reduction assay (data not shown). Although the proliferation rate of MCAs was significantly less efficient than that displayed in monolayer culture, the cell aggregates were clearly able to survive and replicate. FACS analysis of propidium iodide-stained MCAs showed a reduced fraction in G2/M as compared with monolayers and a higher fraction in G0; in contrast, suspended single cells had reduced numbers in the S and G2/M fractions as compared with the multicellular aggregates with a larger proportion of cells in G0/G1. 2S. S. Kantak and R. H. Kramer, unpublished data. By morphological criteria, the suspended single HSC-3 cells appeared abnormal and displayed signs of spontaneous cell death. To assess whether this process represented programmed cell death (PCD), cultures of suspended single cells or MCAs and control monolayer cultures were analyzed for nucleosomal fragmentation and in situ DNA end-labeling. For detection of DNA laddering, genomic DNA was isolated and analyzed for degradation by display in agarose gels (Fig. 2 A). Whereas only high molecular weight DNA was detected in both monolayer (Fig. 2 A, lanes 2 and 5) and MCA cultures (lanes 4 and 7), DNA isolated from 3- and 6-day single-cell suspension cultures revealed extensive DNA laddering typical of apoptotic intranucleosomal cleavage (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3 and6). Usually, the degraded DNA fragments banded at 200–300 bp and above. In other experiments, the appearance of DNA fragmentation after suspension of single cells was monitored; at 12 h postseeding, DNA fragmentation was not evident, but by 24 h, there was significant PCD (data not shown). Moreover, analysis of annexin levels by fluorescence-activated cell sorting showed extensive expression only in the suspended single cells but not in monolayers or MCA cultures (data not shown). We also analyzed DNA isolated from monolayer and suspension cultures of human foreskin keratinocytes to assess whether survival upon MCA formation can occur in normal epithelial cells. Human foreskin epithelial cells were grown as monolayers, suspended single cells, and MCAs. DNA was analyzed for nucleosomal fragmentation after 24 h of culture as described above for HSC-3 cells. Monolayer cultures of keratinocytes showed no detectable DNA fragmentation (Fig. 2 B, lane 2), whereas both suspended single cells and MCA demonstrated extensive DNA laddering (Fig. 2 B, lanes 3 and 4, respectively). Next, we analyzed DNA fragmentation to identify apoptotic cells by processing preparations of suspended HSC-3 single cells and multicellular aggregates for the TUNEL labeling method. Suspended single cells (Fig. 2 C, panel a) and MCAs (Fig. 2 C, panel c) were stained for DNA with propidium iodide to identify nuclei. Fragmented DNA was labeled with dUTP-fluorescein. In the 3-day cultures of suspended single cells, a majority (∼90%) displayed nuclear fragmentation, indicating a marked induction of apoptosis (Fig. 2 C, panel b). However, in the MCAs, only a minor and variable population of cells (∼4%) were apoptotic (Fig. 2 C, panel d). In most cases, the small fraction of positive cells in MCAs appeared at the outer boundary of the MCA or in single cells, suggesting that these cells had failed to properly integrate into the aggregates. Epithelial cells require Ca2+ to form homophilic cell-cell adhesions (6Takeichi M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether high concentrations of divalent cation were necessary for the survival and growth of suspension cultures of HSC-3 cells. Monolayer and MCA cultures were initiated in culture medium containing the following combinations of Ca2+ and Mg2+ at high (1 mm) or low (0.09 mm) concentrations: 1) high Ca2+ and low Mg2+, 2) low Ca2+ and high Mg2+, and 3) low Ca2+ and low Mg2+. In monolayer cultures, HSC-3 cells proliferated well in standard medium containing 1 mm of each cation (Fig. 1 A) or in medium containing either high Ca2+ or high Mg2+ but failed to proliferate when both divalent cations were supplied at low concentration (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, when cells were cultured as MCAs, proliferation was evident only when Ca2+ was present at high concentration (Figs. 1 B and 3 B). If low Ca2+ was used for MCA cultures, no growth occurred, and there was actually a significant decrease in cell number regardless of the Mg2+concentration (Fig. 3 B). HSC-3 multicellular aggregates under the different growth conditions were evaluated for DNA fragmentation. Culturing of MCA in high Ca2+ and high Mg2+ did not produce apoptosis (Fig. 2 A). DNA laddering was detected only in MCA cultures grown without high Ca2+, and substituting 1 mmMg2+ for Ca2+ failed to rescue the cells from suspension-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3 C, lane 5). Monolayer cultures showed no evidence of PCD when either high Ca2+ or high Mg2+ was provided; only when medium contained low levels of both divalent cations was apoptosis evident in the monolayer cultures (not shown). Because integrins are known to function effectively in the presence of Mg2+ and are usually inhibited in high Ca2+ (20Mould A.P. Akiyama S.K. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26270-26277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), these results suggest that the rescue from apoptosis following the formation of survival-promoting cell-cell adhesions in MCAs is not mediated by integrins but via Ca2+-dependent cell contacts. It is well known that cadherins are known to form epithelial cell-cell adhesions through a Ca2+-dependent mechanism (6Takeichi M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar, 21Takeichi M. Science. 1991; 251: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2990) Google Scholar). We analyzed the stepwise formation of HSC-3 cell aggregates, which begins with single cells that subsequently form cell chains by 8 h, collect into loose, irregular clumps of cells by 12 h, condense into compacted MCAs with smooth margins between 15 and 24 h, and remain viable with evidence of growth at 72 h (Fig. 4, A–F). Because squamous epithelial cells are known to use E-cadherin as the primary cell-cell adhesion molecule, we tested the effect of a function-perturbing anti-E-cadherin mAb on multicellular aggregate formation. When the cells were cultured in the presence of mAb SHE78-7, the formation of the large, compact aggregates was severely inhibited at 24 h (Fig. 4 G) and 72 h (Fig. 4 H). Although some limited cell aggregates formed in the presence of the antibody, they were of smaller size, with many visible single cells, and failed to compact, remaining loosely adherent. These effects of mAb SHE78-7 indicated that the assembly and compaction of multicellular aggregates involves functional E-cadherin. We next tested whether mAb SHE78-7 could block proliferation of HSC-3 monolayer, suspended single-cell, or MCA cultures. In these experiments, cultures were initiated with or without blocking SHE78-7 antibody, and after 72 h the incorporation of [3H]thymidine by the cells was measured. The SHE78-7 mAb had no significant effect on the proliferation of HSC-3 cells in monolayer cultures, but [3H]thymidine incorporation by MCA suspension cultures was inhibited by nearly 60% (TableI). The blocking antibody did not significantly alter the low level of [3H]thymidine incorporation in suspended single cells during the same period. Inclusion of an irrelevant mAb for SHE78-7 produced the same negative result as medium alone.3 Analysis of DNA extracted from HSC-3 MCAs cultured in the presence and absence of SHE78-7 showed significant DNA laddering only in cultures treated with the blocking mAb (Fig. 5 A, lane 4), whereas no DNA laddering was visible in the HSC-3 MCAs cultured in the absence of the antibody (Fig. 5 A, lane 3) or in control monolayer cultures (Fig. 5 A, lane 2). These results indicate that hindering the formation of E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell contacts by suspended cells significantly reduces their growth and induces PCD. This suggests that engagement of intercellular E-cadherin contacts in multicellular aggregates may substitute for the loss of cell-matrix signaling.Table IEffect of anti-E-cadherin antibody on growth of HSC-3 cellsCulture conditionsSHE78–8 mAb[3H]Thymidine incorporationaValues represent the mean cpm ± S.D. × 104 of TCA-insoluble radioactivity from triplicate plates.Inhibitionμg/ml%Monolayer25.9 ± 1.8124.7 ± 2.14.6Single cell1.22 ± 1.111.20 ± 0.91.6MCA7.98 ± 0.113.46 ± 0.256.7a Values represent the mean cpm ± S.D. × 104 of TCA-insoluble radioactivity from triplicate plates. Open table in a new tab Levels of Bcl-2 protein estimated by immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis revealed that Bcl-2 was elevated in HSC-3 monolayer and MCA cultures but was down-regulated in suspension cultures of single cells (Fig. 5 B). These results indicate that the inhibition of growth and susceptibility to apoptosis in suspended single cells is associated with the loss of Bcl-2 expression. Next, we tested whether E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesions are involved in the maintenance of Bcl-2 levels by examining the effect of the anti-E-cadherin mAb (Fig. 5 C). Bcl-2 expression was down-regulated by 15–20-fold in HSC-3 multicellular aggregate in the presence of the anti-E-cadherin mAb SHE78-7 when compared with control HSC-3 multicellular aggregates. FAK is an important mediator of integrin-induced signaling involved in anchorage-dependent survival and growth (22Frisch F.M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Chan-Hui P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). The level of activated FAK was assessed by immunoprecipitation and detection of autophosphorylation in monolayer, suspended single cell, and MCA cultures of HSC-3 cells (Fig. 5 D). As expected for monolayer cultures, FAK was fully activated as evidenced by its high level of tyrosine phosphorylation. Also as expected for suspended single cells lacking substrate adhesions, no detectable tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK was observed. However, FAK activation was also lacking in MCA cultures, indicating that cell-cell adhesion fails to trigger significant downstream FAK autophosphorylation. By immunoblotting analysis, the relative levels of FAK protein were unchanged in the different culture conditions (not shown). To further test whether E-cadherin engagement rescues cells in suspension from apoptosis, we studied another human oral squamous carcinoma cell line, HOC-313. The parent population of this cell line has low levels of E-cadherin and is unable to form compacted MCAs. However, this cell line contains a mixed population of both high and low expressors of E-cadherin, and we were able to isolate individual receptor-negative and receptor-positive single-cell clones by serial dilution. A total of nine random clones were isolated, and immunoblotting was used to assess E-cadherin expression. Whereas the parental HOC-313 cells expressed low levels of E-cadherin, the D1 and D2 clones had high levels of E-cadherin, and the C7 and C8 clones had no detectable signal for the receptor (Fig. 6 A). Two clones were selected for further study: the C8 receptor-negative clone and the D1 receptor-positive clone. The ability of the C8 and D1 clones to form cell-cell aggregates was evaluated in suspension cultures on poly-HEMA-coated plates. At 8 h postplating, the E-cadherin-negative C8 clone formed loose chains of aggregates in suspension (Fig. 6 B, panel a) that failed to fully compact by 24 h (Fig. 6 B, panel b). In contrast, the E-cadherin-positive D1 clone efficiently formed condensing aggregates by 8 h (Fig. 6 B, panel c) that completely compacted by 24 h (Fig. 6 B, panel d). Next we analyzed samples of DNA isolated at 72 h from monolayer, suspended single-cell, and MCA cultures formed by the C8 and D1 clonal cell lines. DNA was analyzed on agarose gels for intranucleosomal cleavage. We found that monolayer cultures from either cell line lacked any evidence of DNA fragmentation (Fig. 6 C, lanes 2 and5). However, both cell types showed extensive PCD when cultured as single-cell suspensions. Importantly, the E-cadherin-positive D1 cells that formed compacted MCAs survived and grew in suspension, whereas the cadherin-negative C8 cells underwent apoptosis, as indicated by extensive DNA laddering (Fig. 6 C, lane 7). Most squamous epithelial cells, including their transformed counterparts, are strictly anchorage-dependent; they fail to survive in single-cell suspension culture and undergo terminal differentiation and programmed cell death (9Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2788) Google Scholar, 23Rheinwald J.G. Beckett M.A. Cell. 1980; 22: 629-632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 24Watt F.M. Green H. Nature. 1982; 295: 434-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Our analysis of squamous cell carcinoma cell lines showed that forced anchorage deprivation triggered apoptosis. Suspension-induced cell death was confirmed by several independent criteria, including morphology and DNA fragmentation assessed by gel fractionation and TUNEL. However, if the cells formed cell-cell aggregates, they not only survived in suspension but also proliferated. Moreover, if cells were suspended in low calcium medium to prevent cell-cell adhesion, they failed to proliferate and rapidly entered the death pathway. Importantly, we found that although HSC-3 cells in MCA cultures were able to pr"
https://openalex.org/W2029085695,"Focal adhesion kinase (Fak) is a non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinase that stimulates cell spreading and motility by promoting the formation of contact sites between the cell and the extracellular matrix (focal adhesions). It suppresses apoptosis by transducing survival signals that emanate from focal adhesions via the clustering of transmembrane integrins by components of the extracellular matrix. We demonstrate that Fak is cleaved by caspases at two distinct sites during apoptosis. The sites were mapped to DQTD772, which was preferentially cleaved by caspase-3, and VSWD704, which was preferentially cleaved by caspase-6 and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-derived granzyme B. The cleavage of Fak during apoptosis separates the tyrosine kinase domain from the focal adhesion targeting (FAT) domain. The carboxyl-terminal fragments that are generated suppress phosphorylation of endogenous Fak and thus resemble a natural variant of Fak, FRNK, that inhibits Fak activity by preventing the localization of Fak to focal adhesions. The cleavage of Fak by caspases may thus play an important role in the execution of the suicide program by disabling the anti-apoptotic function of Fak. Interestingly, rodent Fak lacks an optimal caspase-3 consensus cleavage site although it is cleaved in murine cells undergoing apoptosis at an upstream site. This appears to be the first example of a caspase substrate where the cleavage sites are not conserved between species.

This appears to be the first example of a caspase substrate where the cleavage sites are not conserved between species. Fak is a 125-kDa non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinase that is recruited to and activated by the engagement of transmembrane integrins by components of the extracellular matrix (e.g. fibronectin) during integrin-mediated cell adhesion. The activation of Fak leads to (i) activation of the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and (ii) recruitment and phosphorylation (either directly or indirectly via the recruitment of Src-like tyrosine kinases) of a number of cytoskeletal proteins, resulting in the formation of contact sites between the cell surface and the extracellular matrix called focal adhesions. By activating the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and promoting the assembly of focal adhesions, Fak mediates multiple cellular responses to cell adhesion including cell survival and proliferation as well as cell spreading and motility (for review, see Ref. 1Otey C.A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1996; 167: 161-183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fak function is dependent on two distinct domains: the tyrosine kinase domain within the amino-terminal half of the protein and a focal adhesion targeting (FAT 1The abbreviations used are: FAT, focal adhesion targeting; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; rh, recombinant human; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: FAT, focal adhesion targeting; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; rh, recombinant human; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid.) domain within the carboxyl-terminal half of the protein. Fak is positively regulated by autophosphorylation, which allows the recruitment of signaling molecules like Src (2Cobb B.S. Schaller M.D. Leu T.-H. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell.

Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). Fak is negatively regulated by the expression of FRNK (p41/p43FRNK; Fak-relatednon-kinase), a truncated isoform of Fak that contains a FAT domain but lacks the kinase domain (7Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 786-791Crossref Scopus (279) Google Scholar). FRNK inhibits the cellular responses to adhesion by preventing the localization of Fak to sites of integrin clustering (8Richardson A. Parsons T. Nature. 1996; 380: 538-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar).The importance of Fak in transducing an anti-apoptotic signal upon integrin engagement is underscored by a number of studies: (i) constitutively activated forms of Fak prevent epithelial cell death upon cell detachment (anoikis) (9Frisch S.M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Chan-Hui P-Y. J. Cell. Biol. 1996; 134: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar); (ii) inhibition of Fak in cultured fibroblasts results in apoptosis (10Hungerford J.E. Compton M.T. Matter M.L. Hoffstrom B.G.

Craven R.J. Cance W.G. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 413-418PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore not surprising that Fak has been shown to be the target of proteolysis in chicken embryo fibroblasts undergoing apoptosis (16Crouch D.H. Fincham V.J. Frame M.C. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2689-2696PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, these observations were extended in human cell lines undergoing apoptosis and the caspase family of cysteinylaspartate-specific proteases were directly implicated in Fak cleavage (17Wen L.-P. Fahrni J.A. Troie S. Guan J.-L. Orth K. Rosen G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26056-26061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) and disassembly of focal adhesions (18Levkau B. Herren B. Koyama H. Ross R. Raines E.W. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The caspases are responsible for initiating and executing apoptotic cell death by cleaving critical homeostatic, repair, and structural proteins in the dying cell (for review see Ref. 19Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2175) Google Scholar). In this report, we identify two sites within chicken Fak that are cleaved by caspases in vitro and in apoptotic cells. Cleavage at either site results in the separation of the kinase domain from the FAT domain. Fragments containing the FAT domain, when expressed in HeLa cells, inhibit phosphorylation of endogenous Fak, suggesting that they act like FRNK and interfere with the function of uncleaved Fak. Although the molecular masses of the fragments released from the cleavage of human Fak in cells undergoing apoptosis are consistent with the sites identified in chicken Fak, cleavage of murine Fak appears to occur at a different site.RESULTSSerum deprivation of chicken embryo fibroblasts was shown recently to result in the proteolysis of Fak into fragments of 70–90 kDa (16Crouch D.H. Fincham V.J. Frame M.C. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2689-2696PubMed Google Scholar). To identify the enzyme responsible for the cleavage of Fak during apoptosis, we set up an in vitro assay whereby [35S]methionine-labeled chicken Fak generated by in vitro transcription/translation was incubated with an apoptotic extract derived from Jurkat T lymphocytic cells treated with an antibody to the CD95 (Fas/Apo-1) death receptor (these cells were chosen because their ability to undergo apoptotic cell death has been extensively characterized). Two fragments of 90 and 35 kDa were observed after incubation with apoptotic but not with non-apoptotic cell extracts (Fig. 1, lanes 1and 2). The protease inhibitor sensitivity profile of Fak cleavage was characteristic of that of the caspase family of cysteine proteases in that proteolysis was abolished by the cysteine-alkylating reagent iodoacetamide (lane 21), but not by the cysteine protease inhibitor E-64 (lane 14) nor by serine, aspartate, or metalloprotease inhibitors (lanes 3-13 and15-20).To confirm that a caspase was responsible for the cleavage of Fak and to define more precisely the group of caspases involved, we performed the cleavage assays in the presence of three different tetrapeptide aldehydes, each of which preferentially inhibits a caspase subgroup (22Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1838) Google Scholar). The interpretation of the results was based on the known selectivity of these inhibitors for all 10 human recombinant caspases. Up to 10 μm Ac-YVAD-CHO did not prevent the generation of the 90- and 35-kDa proteolytic fragments (Fig. 2 A, lanes 15-21), excluding the possibility that one of the Group I caspases (caspase-1, -4, -5; Ref. 22Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1838) Google Scholar) was responsible for cleavage. In contrast, as little as 100 nm Ac-DEVD-CHO completely abolished Fak cleavage (lanes 1-7; IC50 10 nm) whereas Ac-IETD-CHO inhibited Fak cleavage only when present at moderately high concentrations (lanes 8-14; IC50 200 nm). The only caspase that has an inhibitor specificity consistent with these results is caspase-3, strongly suggesting that this enzyme is responsible for cleaving Fak in apoptotic extracts.Figure 2Fak cleavage is sensitive to Ac-DEVD-CHO and Ac-IETD-CHO but not to Ac-YVAD-CHO. A, apoptotic Jurkat cell extracts were incubated with [35S]methionine-labeled Fak in the presence of the indicated concentrations of tetrapeptide aldehydes. The cleavage reactions were carried out for 1 h at 37 °C and visualized by 10% SDS-PAGE and fluorography.Arrows indicate full-length Fak (p125Fak) and proteolytic fragments generated (p90, p35). B, quantitation of Fak cleavage, assessed by laser densitometric scanning of the 35-kDa proteolytic fragment, is expressed as a percentage of the control to which no drug was added. From this graph, the IC50 values for the various tetrapeptide aldehydes were determined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Caspase-3 is one of the most abundant Group II caspases in apoptotic Jurkat cell extracts. 2D. Rasper, S. Xanthoudakis, S. Roy, and D. W. Nicholson, unpublished results. It has been implicated directly in the cleavage of most of the proteins targeted for proteolysis during apoptosis. To assess whether caspase-3 cleaves Fak and whether this cleavage event is of physiological relevance, [35S]methionine-labeled Fak was incubated with various amounts of purified recombinant human (rh) caspase-3. Fragments with molecular masses identical with those generated by the apoptotic Jurkat cell extract were produced when Fak was incubated with rh caspase-3 (Fig. 3), consistent with the inhibitor studies implicating a Group II caspase such as caspase-3. Thek cat/K m for this substrate was 3.4 × 105m−1s−1, only slightly less than that for poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase (k cat/K m = 15.6 × 105m−1s−1; data not shown), the first identified and most extensively characterized substrate of caspase-3 (23Lazebnik Y.A.

Because cysteine residues are absent from the carboxyl-terminal portion of Fak, we predicted that the 35-kDa fragment was derived from the carboxyl terminus. Analysis of the chicken Fak cDNA sequence revealed an excellent consensus cleavage site for caspase-3, DQTD772, present 282 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of the protein. To confirm that DQTD772was the site being recognized by caspase-3, we substituted the P1 aspartic acid at position 772 for an alanine by site-directed mutagenesis (the presence of an aspartic acid in P1 is absolutely required for cleavage by all caspases). [35S]Methionine-labeled Fak carrying the D772A mutation was not cleaved by caspase-3 (Fig. 4 A, lane 4) under conditions where the conversion of wild-type Fak to 90- and 35-kDa fragments occurred (lane 2).Figure 4Identification of caspase cleavage sites in Fak. A, DQTD772 is cleaved by rh-caspase-3. [35S]Methionine-labeled wild-type (lanes 1 and 2) and mutant (D772A) (lanes 3 and 4) Fak were incubated in the presence (+) or absence (−) of 3.2 nm rh-caspase-3 for 1 h at 37 °C. Fak cleavage was visualized by 10% SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Arrowsindicate full-length Fak (p125Fak) and cleaved fragments (p90, p35). B, DQTD772 and VSWD704are cleaved upon induction of apoptosis in K562 cells. Polyclonal populations of lymphoid K562 cells expressing carboxyl-terminal Flag-tagged wild-type (lanes 1 and 2) and mutant (D772A, lanes 3 and 4; D704A/D772A, lanes 5 and 6) Fak were incubated in the presence (+) or absence (−) of camptothecin for 16 h. Lysates prepared by boiling in SDS-Laemmli buffer were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted using an anti-flag M2 antibody (Kodak). Arrows indicate full-length (p125Fak) and cleaved (p40 and p35) Flag-tagged Fak.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To confirm that the aspartic acid at position 772 was being cleaved in cells undergoing apoptosis, we subcloned wild-type and mutant Fak (D772A) into the eukaryotic expression vector pCEP4β and established polyclonal stable K562 lymphoid cell lines expressing these proteins. The proteins were engineered with a Flag-epitope tag at the carboxyl terminus to allow visualization of the carboxyl-terminal fragments released by proteolysis. Large amounts of the wild-type (wt) and D772A mutant proteins were expressed in these stable cell lines, as assessed by immunoblot analysis using a monoclonal antibody to the Flag epitope (Fig. 4 B, lanes 1 and 3). When the cells were rendered apoptotic by treatment with the topoisomerase inhibitor camptothecin, Fak cleavage occurred, as visualized by the appearance of the Flag-tagged 35-kDa carboxyl-terminal fragment (lane 2). As expected, the 35-kDa fragment was not detected in cells expressing the D772A mutant Fak, confirming that cleavage at Asp772 was responsible for the liberation of the 35-kDa fragment. Instead, low amounts of a fragment of 40 kDa were detected in apoptotic K562 cells expressing the D772A mutant Fak (lane 4). The corresponding 85-kDa fragment was visualized by Western blot analysis of extracts from apoptotic cells expressing a D772A mutant protein with a Flag-epitope tag at the amino terminus (data not shown). We predicted that the potential cleavage site VSWD704 present upstream of the aspartic acid at position 772 was also being cleaved under these conditions. This was confirmed by the absence of Fak cleavage in camptothecin-treated K562 cells expressing a Fak mutant whereby the aspartic acids at both positions 704 and 772 were mutated to alanines (lanes 5 and6).Cleavage assays using recombinant human caspase-3 excluded the possibility that the VSWD704 site was recognized by caspase-3 (Fig. 3). The substrate specificity profile of the caspase family members (22Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1838) Google Scholar) suggested that VSWD704 represented a good consensus site for the Group III activator caspases and a poor substrate for Group II enzymes such as caspase-3. Although one of the Group III enzymes, caspase-8, did not cleave at VSWD704, caspase-6 cleaved both VSWD704 and DQTD772(Fig. 5), as determined in vitro using the recombinant human enzyme. Incubation of wild-type [35S]methionine-labeled Fak with caspase-6 generated both 40- and 35-kDa carboxyl-terminal fragments and the corresponding amino-terminal derived 85- and 90-kDa fragments, respectively (lane 2). Substitution of the aspartic acids at positions 704 and 772 for alanines confirmed that the 40- and 85-kDa fragments were generated by cleavage at VSWD704 and the 35- and 90-kDa fragments, by cleavage at DQTD772 (lanes 3-5). Thek cat/K m values for cleavage at VSWD704 and DQTD772 by rh caspase-6 were 6.5 × 104m−1s−1 and 5.9 × 104m−1 s−1, respectively. The serine protease granzyme B, which is present in the granules of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and has been shown to have a very similar substrate specificity to that of Group III activator caspases (22Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol.

Although both caspase-3 and caspase-6 cleave DQTD772, it is noteworthy that the catalytic efficiency of caspase-3 for this site is approximately 6 times greater than that of caspase-6, suggesting that caspase-3 (or another Group II effector caspase) is more likely to be the protease responsible for cleavage at this site in vivo.Figure 5Cleavage of Fak by rh-caspase-6 in vitro. [35S]Methionine-labeled Fak wild-type (lanes 1 and 2) and mutant (D704A, lane 3; D772A, lane 4; D704A/D772A, lane 5) were incubated with 7.7 nm rh-caspase-6 for 1 h at 37 °C and visualized by 10% SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Arrowsindicate full-length Fak (p125Fak) and cleaved fragments (p90, p85, and corresponding p35 and p40).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The physiological significance of the presence of two distinct caspase cleavage sites in Fak was underscored by examining the cleavage of endogenous protein in human cell lines undergoing apoptosis (both DQTD772 and VSWD704 are conserved in human Fak). Total cell lysates were prepared from Jurkat cells at various times after stimulation of the CD95 (Fas/Apo-1) death receptor by antibodies to CD95 (Fas/Apo-1) (Fig. 6 A). As early as 2 h after the addition of anti-CD95 (Fas/Apo-1), Fak cleavage to a 90-kDa fragment was detected by Western blot analysis using two different antibodies to Fak, one directed against residues 748 to 1053 (α748–1053) and one directed against residues 354–533 (α354–533). The antibody raised against residues 354–533 recognized an additional fragment of 85 kDa. These results are consistent with the cleavage of Fak at both VSWD704 and DQTD772sites in apoptotic Jurkat cells (see Fig. 6 C). Curiously, only the 90-kDa fragment was generated in the human cervical carcinoma cell line HeLa in response to treatment for 2 h with staurosporine, a nonspecific kinase inhibitor that induces apoptosis (Fig. 6 B). A similar result was obtained when we induced apoptosis by serum starvation or by treatment with camptothecin (data not shown). We confirmed that only DQTD772 is recognized in apoptotic HeLa cells by demonstrating that cleavage of transiently transfected chicken Fak was abolished when the P1 aspartic acid at position 772 was substituted for alanine without appearance of fragments corresponding to cleavage at VSWD704 (data not shown). The absence of cleavage at VSWD704 may be due to the absence of caspase-6 (or another caspase capable of cleaving VSWD704) or to the inaccessibility of VSWD704 in HeLa cells.Figure 6Different caspase cleavage sites are recognized in different cell lines. A, cleavage of Fak in Jurkat cells. Human Jurkat T-cells were treated for various periods of time with anti-CD95 (Fas/Apo-1) antibodies to induce apoptosis. Lysates prepared by boiling in SDS-Laemmli buffer were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with either a monoclonal antibody directed against the carboxyl-terminal portion of Fak (residues 748–1053; Upstate Biotechnology) or a monoclonal antibody directed against the amino-terminal portion of Fak (residues 354–533; Transduction Laboratories). B, cleavage of p125Fak in human HeLa cervical carcinoma cells and in murine 3T3 L1 fibroblast cells. HeLa and 3T3 L1 were incubated in the presence (+) or absence (−) of staurosporine for 2 h after which lysates were prepared by boiling in SDS-Laemmli buffer, analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with a monoclonal antibody directed against the amino-terminal portion of Fak (residues 354–533; Transduction Laboratories). Arrowsindicate full-length Fak p125Fak and cleaved fragments (p90 and p75). C, schematic representation of Fak. The positions of the kinase domain, proline-rich region (hatched box), and focal adhesion targeting domain (FAT) are illustrated. Also shown are the regions encompassing the epitopes recognized by the two antibodies (α354–533; α748–1053) and the 85-kDa (p85) and 90-kDa (p90) fragments generated by cleavage at VSWD704 and DQTD772, respectively.D, comparison of the proteolytic fragments generated by caspase cleavage of Fak during apoptosis with the natural competitive inhibitor of Fak, FRNK.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Cleavage at either DQTD772 or VSWD704 results in the separation of the kinase domain from the focal adhesion targeting (FAT) domain. Noteworthy is the fact that the naturally occurring inhibitor of Fak, FRNK, corresponds to the carboxyl-terminal half of Fak, as illustrated in Fig. 6 D. When overexpressed, FRNK prevents the localization of Fak to sites of integrin engagement resulting in decreased Fak phosphorylation and inhibition of Fak-mediated cellular responses to cell adhesion (25Richardson A. Malik R.K. Hildebrand J.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6906-6914Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). In view of the presence of an intact FAT domain within the 35- and 40-kDa fragments generated by caspase cleavage of Fak during apoptosis, we reasoned that these fragments may also act as competitive inhibitors of Fak. To test this hypothesis, Fak deletion mutants identical with the carboxyl-terminal fragments generated during apoptosis were engineered and transiently transfected into HeLa cells. The levels of phosphorylated Fak protein were measured by immunoprecipitation with an anti-Fak antibody and immunoblotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 24 h after transfection (Fig. 7). Expression of either the 35- (lane 4) or the 40-kDa fragment (lane 3) suppressed the phosphorylation of endogenous Fak, as was observed after transfection of FRNK (lane 2). Like FRNK, these fragments acted as competitive inhibitors because their inhibitory effects were abrogated by overexpressing full-length Fak protein (data not shown).Figure 7Inhibition of endogenous Fak tyrosine phosphorylation by the expression of FRNK or the related carboxyl-terminal fragments generated by caspase cleavage. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with the wild-type pCEP4β vector (lane 1) or pCEP4β containing FRNK (lane 2), C705–1053 (lane 3), or C773–1053 (lane 4). C705–1053 and C773–1053correspond exactly to the carboxyl-terminal fragments generated by caspase cleavage at VSWD704 and DQTD772, respectively, except that an initiating methionine was introduced immediately upstream of the P1' amino acid. Twenty-four h after transfection, cells were lysed, and tyrosine-phosphorylated Fak was detected by immunoprecipitation using an antibody directed against the carboxyl terminus of Fak followed by immunoblotting using the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody RC20 (αPY; Transduction Laboratories). In parallel, total amounts of Fak were assessed by immunoprecipitation as described above followed by immunoblotting with an anti-Fak antibody (αFak; anti-kinase domain from Transduction Laboratories).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)If the disabling of Fak by caspase cleavage represents a critical step in the execution of the apoptotic program, the two cleavage sites identified should be conserved in other species. Whereas the caspase-6 cleavage site VSWD704 is present in all species examined (human, rat, mouse, chicken, frog; Fig. 8), the caspase-3 cleavage site DQTD772 is present in chicken and human but not rat or mouse (Fig. 8; the DHMD772 sequence present in frog Fak is predicted to be cleaved efficiently by a Group II effector caspase). Given that one of the caspase cleavage sites (DQTD772) is absent in mouse Fak, we examined whether Fak cleavage occurred in murine cells in response to an apoptotic stimulus. Lysates were prepared from staurosporine-treated 3T3 L1 fibroblasts and analyzed by immunoblotting using the α 354–533 antibody that recognizes both 85- and 90-kDa fragments in human Fak (Fig. 6 B). Neither 85- nor 90-kDa fragments of Fak could be detected in apoptotic murine cells. Instead, murine Fak was cleaved at an upstream site, the identity of which remains to be determined, which results in the appearance of a 75-kDa fragment (we have not excluded the possibility that murine Fak is cleaved first at VSWD704 and then at an upstream site).Figure 8Conservation of caspase cleavage sites in human but not rodent Fak. Amino acid sequences of human (GenBankTM accession number L13616), rat (S83358), mouse (M95408), chicken (M86656), and frog Fak (1362692) were aligned in areas corresponding to the chicken Fak caspase cleavage sites DQTD772 and VSWD704 (numbers refer to the amino acid positions in the chicken sequence, 1 being the initiating methionine).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONThe cleavage of Fak observed in both adherent and suspension cell lines in response to various apoptotic inducers suggests that this proteolytic event plays an important role in the execution of the suicide pathway.

The ADAMs 1The abbreviations used are: ADAM, a disintegrin and metalloprotease; α2M, α2-macroglobulin; MMP, matrix metalloprotease; NEM,N-ethylmaleimide; SVMP, snake venom metalloprotease; nt, nucleotide(s); TACE, TNF-α-converting enzyme. are a family of integral membrane or secreted glycoproteins comprised of several distinct domains. The archetypical ADAM protein has a prodomain, metalloprotease domain, disintegrin domain, cysteine-rich region, and in the case of membrane-anchored ADAMs, a transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain. At least 18 members of the ADAMs family have now been identified and sequenced (1Wolfsberg T.G. White J.M. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 389-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 2Blobel C.P.

SVMPs were the first members of this family to be identified and have been extensively studied (11Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 183-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 12Bjarnason J.B. Fox J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 345-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 13Jia L.G.

Full-length SVMPs are processed to generate a metalloprotease, which is able to degrade proteins of the basement membrane such as type IV collagen and laminin (14Hite L.A. Jia L.G. Bjarnason J.B. Fox J.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 308: 182-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), and a disintegrin domain, which can inhibit the function of platelets by interacting with platelet integrin GPIIb-IIIa (15Paine M.J. Desmond H.P. Theakston R.D. Crampton J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22869-22876Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the domain composition and striking similarity to SVMPs, the ADAMs are thought to play an important role in cellular interactions and tissue integrity. Members of the metzincin superfamily of proteolytic enzymes, including the reprolysin and the matrix metalloprotease (MMP) families, contain the distinctive zinc binding consensus sequence HEXXH (11Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 183-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar,16Stöcker W. Grams F. Baumann U. Reinemer P. Gomis Ruth F.X. McKay D.B. Bode W. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1995; 4: 823-840Google Scholar). However, only a subset of the ADAMs, including ADAM 12, contain this motif and are therefore considered to be potentially active metalloproteases. Protease activity has actually been demonstrated so far for only a few members of the ADAMs family, ADAM 10 and TACE, which have been shown to cleave precursor tumor necrosis factor-α, and theDrosophila ADAM 10 homolog KUZ, which cleaves Notch (5Black R.A.

We recently reported the cloning and sequencing of human ADAM 12 (meltrin α), which can be expressed either as a secreted or a membrane-bound protein (21Gilpin B.J. Loechel F. Mattei M.-G. Engvall E. Albrechtsen R. Wewer U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 157-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). We have now begun to assign functions to the individual domains by assaying activity of wild-type and mutant ADAM 12 proteins expressed in a COS cell transient transfection system. We report here that the metalloprotease domain of ADAM 12 is proteolytically active. Full-length ADAM 12 is a zymogen with the prodomain maintaining the metalloprotease in a latent state most likely via a cysteine switch mechanism. A plasmid for expression of full-length ADAM 12-S (p1151) was constructed using the vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Standard recombinant DNA techniques were used throughout (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A cDNA clone in pBluescript SK(+) containing nt 1–3445 ofADAM 12-L and another cDNA clone containing nt 1854–3333 of ADAM 12-S were used as a source of ADAM 12 sequence (21Gilpin B.J. Loechel F. Mattei M.-G. Engvall E. Albrechtsen R. Wewer U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 157-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The ADAM 12-L insert was excised withEcoRV and XhoI and cloned at theEcoRV/XhoI sites of pcDNA3, giving an expression plasmid for ADAM 12-L (p1138). APflMI/XhoI fragment containing nt 2091–3333 ofADAM 12-S was then exchanged with the correspondingPflMI/XhoI fragment of p1138, yielding plasmid p1151. The construction of plasmid p1095, a minigene which expresses an ADAM 12-S protein where the signal peptide, prodomain, and metalloprotease domain have been replaced by an Ig κ-chain leader sequence, has already been described (21Gilpin B.J. Loechel F. Mattei M.-G. Engvall E. Albrechtsen R. Wewer U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 157-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Plasmids coding for mutant ADAM 12 proteins were produced by replacing the PmlI DNA fragment (nt 721–2168) of plasmid p1151 with PmlI fragments containing the desired mutations. These were generated by strand overlap polymerase chain reaction using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene), a forward and reverse primer hybridizing upstream and downstream of the PmlI sites, and complementary oligonucleotides containing the desired mutation. Briefly, a DNA fragment was produced using the forward primer and the antisense mutant primer, and an overlapping fragment was produced using the sense mutant primer and the downstream primer. The two fragments were gel-purified, then mixed and amplified with Pfu DNA polymerase and the forward and reverse primers. Digestion of the product withPmlI yielded the desired 1447-base pair DNA fragment. The sequences of the oligonucleotide primers are available from the authors upon request. Sequencing to confirm the accuracy of the mutations was performed using the Vistra DNA Sequencer 725 (Amersham). COS-7 cells (ATCC, CRL 1651) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium with Glutamax I and 4500 mg/ml glucose, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. For transient transfections, COS-7 cells were electroporated with a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II using 250 V and 1000 μF for 4 × 106 cells and 10 μg of plasmid in 0.4 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 14 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), with an electrode gap of 0.4 cm. After electroporation, 6 × 105 viable cells were plated in 35-mm tissue culture dishes. 24 h post-transfection, cells were refed with medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum or with serum-free medium (UltraDOMA medium from BioWhittaker). 72 h post-transfection, the medium was harvested and concentrated 10-fold using an Amicon Centricon-10 filter. Samples were denatured and reduced by boiling in SDS sample buffer containing dithiothreitol, subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on Tris/glycine gels (Novex) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The membranes were incubated with medium from 14E3 hybridoma cells (21Gilpin B.J. Loechel F. Mattei M.-G. Engvall E. Albrechtsen R. Wewer U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 157-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) and then with peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-rat immunoglobulins (DAKO). Detection was performed using the chemiluminescence SuperSignal kit from Pierce. The α2-macroglobulin (α2M) complex formation assay was used (23Nagase H. Itoh Y. Binner S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 732: 294-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 24Sottrup Jensen L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 737: 172-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Assays on concentrated serum-free medium from transfected cells were carried out in 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 10 mmCaCl2, and 0.02% sodium azide. The following compounds were added at the indicated final concentrations: 10 units/ml bovine α2M (Boehringer Mannheim); 1 mm 1,10-phenanthroline (Sigma); 5 μm or 500 μm HgCl2(Sigma); 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide (Sigma). Reactions were terminated after incubation at 37 °C for 16 h by boiling in SDS sample buffer as described above. Sequence comparison of ADAM 12 with other reprolysins and with MMPs reveals that the ADAM 12 metalloprotease domain contains the zinc binding sequence that characterizes the active site of the these proteases (Fig. 1). The highly conserved HEXXHXXGXXH motif is present, including the glutamate residue that is required for the catalytic mechanism (16Stöcker W. Grams F. Baumann U. Reinemer P. Gomis Ruth F.X. McKay D.B. Bode W. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1995; 4: 823-840Google Scholar). In addition, ADAM 12 retains the “Met-turn” that appears to be essential for the structural integrity of the zinc-binding site (16Stöcker W. Grams F. Baumann U. Reinemer P. Gomis Ruth F.X. McKay D.B. Bode W. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1995; 4: 823-840Google Scholar). In those MMPs that have an enzymatically active protease domain, the prodomain serves to maintain the enzyme in a latent state via a cysteine switch mechanism (25Springman E.B. Angleton E.L. Birkedal Hansen H. Van Wart H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 26Van Wart H.E. Birkedal Hansen H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5578-5582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar). We predict that in human ADAM 12, the cysteine residue at position 179 in the prodomain complexes to the active site zinc atom in the metalloprotease domain. In addition, examination of the amino acids at the boundary of the prodomain and the metalloprotease domain shows that they match the consensus sequence for cleavage by furin-type endopeptidases (27Denault J.B. Leduc R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 379: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 28Watanabe T. Nakagawa T. Ikemizu J. Nagahama M. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8270-8274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Watanabe T. Murakami K. Nakayama K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 320: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Removal of the prodomain by cleavage at this site would be expected to convert the full-length ADAM 12 zymogen to a mature enzymatically active metalloprotease. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with plasmid p1151 containing the coding sequence of human ADAM 12-S downstream of a cytomegalovirus promoter. Soluble, secreted ADAM 12-S protein was detected by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting of culture medium 72 h post-transfection using the monoclonal antibody 14E3 against the cysteine-rich region of ADAM 12. When full-length ADAM 12-S was expressed in COS cells, two bands were seen on the blot with estimated sizes of 92 and 68 kDa (Fig. 2 A, lane 3). We tentatively assigned the 92-kDa band to full-length ADAM 12-S, and the 68-kDa band to ADAM 12-S after cleavage of the prodomain. These sizes are larger than those calculated from the primary structure (78 and 58 kDa) and most likely reflect glycosylation of the ADAM 12 polypeptides (21Gilpin B.J. Loechel F. Mattei M.-G. Engvall E. Albrechtsen R. Wewer U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 157-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 30Yagami-Hiromasa T. Sato T. Kurisaki T. Kamijo K. Nabeshima Y. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Nature. 1995; 377: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). ADAM 12-S protein that was secreted into medium containing fetal bovine serum generated an additional set of high M rbands (Fig. 2 A, lane 6). These bands are reminiscent of the cross-linked products seen when the protease inhibitor α2M is cleaved by an active protease (24Sottrup Jensen L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 737: 172-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 31Feinman R.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 737: 245-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the high M r bands observed in this experiment arose by cleavage of α2M by the catalytically active metalloprotease domain of ADAM 12, giving cross-linked ADAM 12/α2M proteins that could be detected by monoclonal antibody 14E3. This interpretation was supported by the fact that when COS cells were transfected with an ADAM 12-S minigene, the ADAM 12-S polypeptide lacking a prodomain and metalloprotease domain did not give rise to the high M r products (Fig. 2 A, lanes 2 and 5). To test the hypothesis that ADAM 12 has proteolytic activity toward α2M, the 92- and 68-kDa forms of ADAM 12-S protein were prepared in serum-free medium. They were incubated with purified α2M and then analyzed by immunoblotting with monoclonal antibody 14E3. A portion of the ADAM 12 protein shifted to the same large complexes seen after incubation with serum (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1 and 2), confirming that these bands arise from the reaction of ADAM 12 with α2M and not with some other component of serum. The ladder of slower migrating bands matches the pattern of monovalent and multivalent complexes seen in previous studies of endopeptidases and α2M (24Sottrup Jensen L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 737: 172-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 31Feinman R.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 737: 245-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). As further confirmation that these bands arose from the cleavage of α2M by the metalloprotease activity of ADAM 12, the reaction was carried out in the presence of the metalloprotease inhibitor 1,10-phenanthroline. As can be seen in Fig. 2 B, lane 3, the reaction of ADAM 12 with α2M was blocked by this inhibitor. Activity was also completely inhibited in the presence of EDTA (data not shown). For those members of the metzincin superfamily where the mechanism of the metalloprotease has been studied in detail, the glutamate residue present at the zinc-binding site is absolutely required for catalytic activity (16Stöcker W. Grams F. Baumann U. Reinemer P. Gomis Ruth F.X. McKay D.B. Bode W. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1995; 4: 823-840Google Scholar). As a definitive test for the proteolytic activity of ADAM 12, we used site-directed mutagenesis to change this glutamate residue of ADAM 12 to glutamine. COS cells synthesized both the 92- and 68-kDa forms of ADAM 12 containing the E351 → Q mutation, but these proteins were no longer able to react with α2M (Fig. 2 B, lanes 4 and 5). Thus, the E351 → Q mutation eliminated the protease activity of ADAM 12. We had tentatively attributed the production of two forms of ADAM 12-S by COS cells to processing of the full-length 92-kDa form by a COS cell endopeptidase. Elimination of the furin recognition site at the boundary between the prodomain and metalloprotease domain of ADAM 12 should give a precursor protein from which the prodomain can no longer be cleaved. By site-directed mutagenesis we changed the critical amino acids at the −1 and −2 positions of the predicted furin recognition site (28Watanabe T. Nakagawa T. Ikemizu J. Nagahama M. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8270-8274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When COS cells synthesized an ADAM 12 polypeptide containing the KR207 → NG mutation, only a 92-kDa form was detected in the medium (Fig. 2 B, lane 6). This confirmed that the 92-kDa form is full-length ADAM 12-S containing the prodomain and that it is processed by a furin-type endopeptidase. Additionally, this experiment showed that the 92-kDa product is a latent form of the ADAM 12 protease in that it is inactive when assayed with α2M (Fig. 2 B, lane 7). Therefore, the protease activity detected with wild-type ADAM 12-S must derive from the 68-kDa processed form. We next attempted to activate the ADAM 12 zymogen by treatment with sulfhydryl-reactive compounds. Hg(II) and N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) have been reported to activate latent MMPs by dissociating a cysteine residue in the prodomain from the active site zinc atom (25Springman E.B. Angleton E.L. Birkedal Hansen H. Van Wart H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). ADAM 12 zymogen was converted to an active form by NEM but not by Hg(II) (Fig. 2 B, lanes 8 and 9). The ADAM 12·α2M complexes formed by the NEM-activated zymogen were slightly larger than those seen with wild-type ADAM 12, reflecting the reaction of a 92- and 68-kDa ADAM 12 polypeptide, respectively. Based on sequence comparison to other metalloproteases, the cysteine residue at position 179 of ADAM 12 is part of the cysteine switch of the prodomain, which maintains the metalloprotease domain in a latent state (Fig. 1). There is evidence that the cysteine switch of zinc metalloproteases involves binding of the cysteine thiol to the active site zinc atom but that amino acid residues surrounding the cysteine also contribute in a manner that is not well understood (32Park A.J. Matrisian L.M. Kells A.F. Pearson R. Yuan Z.Y. Navre M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1584-1590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Galazka G. Windsor L.J. Birkedal Hansen H. Engler J.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11221-11227Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 34Chen L.C. Noelken M.E. Nagase H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10289-10295Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 35Sang Q.X. Birkedal Hansen H. Van Wart H.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1251: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 36Grams F. Huber R. Kress L.F. Moroder L. Bode W. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 76-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). As a first step in analyzing the cysteine switch of ADAM 12, the protein with the KR207 → NG mutation at the furin cleavage site was modified by changing Cys179 to either serine or alanine. Expression in COS cells yielded a 92-kDa polypeptide that displayed no protease activity when assayed with α2M (Fig. 3 A, lanes 5 and8). In contrast to the proenzyme with a wild-type Cysteine switch, these mutants could not be activated with NEM (Fig. 3 A, lanes 3, 6, and 9). One possible explanation for these results is that the cysteine switch of ADAM 12 performs two sequential functions: first assisting in the folding of the metalloprotease domain into an active conformation, and subsequently by maintaining the metalloprotease in a latent state until removed by a furin-type protease. According to this hypothesis, the 92-kDa ADAM 12 protein containing the C179 → S or C179 → A mutation is not a latent protease but is in fact inactive. We tested this hypothesis by allowing COS cells to synthesize an ADAM 12 protein with an intact furin cleavage site but containing the C179 → S mutation. After the synthesis, folding, and processing of this polypeptide, the COS cells secreted the 68-kDa form, which could be assayed for protease activity. Fig. 3 B shows the result of this experiment. The 68-kDa ADAM 12-S polypeptide was proteolytically active regardless of whether it was generated from a precursor with a wild-type cysteine switch or a precursor with the C179 → S mutation in the cysteine switch. ADAM 12-S zymogen with a C179 → S mutation therefore contains a latent rather than an inactive metalloprotease domain. In the present study we used the trapping mechanism of α2M as an assay for proteolytic activity of ADAM 12. The mechanism of action of α2M has been studied in detail, and it is known that the formation of covalent complexes is dependent on an enzymatically active protease cleaving the bait region of α2M. It is therefore a useful reagent for identification of catalytically active forms of proteases (23Nagase H. Itoh Y. Binner S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 732: 294-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 31Feinman R.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 737: 245-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). By site-directed mutagenesis, we altered critical amino acid residues of ADAM 12 chosen on the basis of structural comparisons with other members of the reprolysin family, expressed the mutant proteins in COS cells, and then tested for reactivity with α2M. Substitution of the essential glutamate residue (Glu351) at the predicted active site of the ADAM 12 protease completely eliminated protease activity. We have shown that ADAM 12-S is synthesized as a latent metalloprotease. It could be activated chemically by treatment with NEM, which presumably alkylates Cys179 and destroys the cysteine switch of the prodomain. Physiologically, activation is probably achieved by proteolytic cleavage of the prodomain, resulting in unmasking of the catalytic center when the cysteine dissociates from the zinc atom present at the catalytic site of the metalloprotease domain. COS cells synthesize a 92-kDa ADAM 12-S zymogen and convert it to the 68-kDa active form by cleaving at a recognition site for furin-type endopeptidases. We have not determined which of the furin-type endopeptidases is responsible for this cleavage, but it is likely to be furin itself, based on published reports of the processing of both stromelysin-3 and meprin A by furin in COS cells (37Pei D. Weiss S.J. Nature. 1995; 375: 244-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 38Milhiet P.E. Chevallier S. Corbeil D. Seidah N.G. Crine P. Boileau G. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 683-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). It is most likely that the cleavage occurs prior to secretion, as seen with stromelysin-3, because extended incubation of secreted ADAM 12 did not result in further conversion. A fraction of the ADAM 12-S zymogen does not get processed by COS cells and is detectable as a 92-kDa protein in the medium, possibly because endopeptidase activity in the COS cells cannot keep pace with the rate of secretion. We cannot exclude, however, that conversion of ADAM 12 from a latent to an active protease also occurs extracellularly in physiological situations. Since the cysteine switch model was first proposed to explain the mechanism by which the prodomain of MMPs maintains the metalloprotease domain in a latent state (25Springman E.B. Angleton E.L.

A. 1990; 87: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar), a number of studies have supported the role of cysteine and zinc ion coordination in maintaining latency, but it has also become evident that the contribution of other amino acid residues in the prodomain cannot be ignored (32Park A.J.

We present here the first data on the cysteine switch of an ADAM protein. Our results are consistent with the notion that a cysteine switch is part of the latency mechanism of ADAM metalloproteases, as it is for MMPs and SVMPs (36Grams F. Huber R. Kress L.F. Moroder L. Bode W. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 76-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The assignment of Cys179 to the cysteine switch based on sequence comparisons is supported by the fact that sensitivity to NEM alkylation disappears when Cys179 is mutated to another amino acid. The observation that these mutant forms of the ADAM 12 prodomain are still able to maintain the metalloprotease in a latent state is probably because of contributions from amino acid residues in the vicinity of Cys179, as has been seen in studies of MMPs (32Park A.J. Matrisian L.M. Kells A.F. Pearson R. Yuan Z.Y. Navre M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1584-1590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Galazka G. Windsor L.J. Birkedal Hansen H. Engler J.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11221-11227Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The “cysteine switch” of the ADAM 12 prodomain would thus retain sufficient binding affinity for the active site of the metalloprotease domain even after elimination of the cysteine-zinc interaction, such that protease activity is blocked under the assay conditions used here. We suggest that NEM destroys the latency mechanism of the ADAM 12 cysteine switch both by virtue of alkylating the cysteine residue and by steric hindrance of the interactions of neighboring amino acids with amino acids in the metalloprotease domain. Many proteases are synthesized as zymogens, and it is of interest to compare the modes of activation of some of these, in particular MMPs, with ADAMs. Most MMPs are synthesized and secreted in a latent form and are subsequently activated by proteolytic cleavage of the prodomain, thus providing one means of modulating their activity (39Nagase H. Hooper N.M. Zinc Metalloproteases in Health and Disease. Taylor & Francis Ltd., London1996: 153-204Google Scholar). Our data on ADAM 12, and previously published data on ADAM 10 and TACE, suggest that ADAM proteases may be constitutively active once they are secreted or displayed on the cell surface (5Black R.A. Rauch C.T. Kozlosky C.J. Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Wolfson M.F. Castner B.J. Stocking K.L. Reddy P. Srinivasan S. Nelson N. Boiani N. Schooley K.A. Gerhart M. Davis R. Fitzner J.N. Johnson R.S.

Another important means of modulating protease activity is by inhibitors, either those with low specificity such as α2M or those with high specificity such as tissue inhibitors of metalloproteases, which are specific for MMPs (40Birkedal Hansen H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 728-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar, 41Gomez D.E. Alonso D.F. Yoshiji H. Thorgeirsson U.P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 74: 111-122PubMed Google Scholar). To date, we have no information on naturally occurring specific inhibitors of ADAM proteases, but they most likely exist. Other types of cells that produce ADAM 12 may process it differently than do transfected COS cells. One could envisage for example that some cells produce an endopeptidase that can cleave between the metalloprotease and disintegrin domains, and thus synthesize an ADAM 12 protein lacking protease activity but with an enhanced activity of the disintegrin or cysteine-rich domains; this may be the case in C2 cells (30Yagami-Hiromasa T. Sato T. Kurisaki T. Kamijo K. Nabeshima Y. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Nature. 1995; 377: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Also, it is not known whether the disintegrin and cysteine-rich domains are required for the proteolytic activity of ADAM 12. It is conceivable that they are essential for maintaining the metalloprotease domain in an active conformation, or that they contribute to the specificity of ADAM 12 protease by binding to selected substrates. The substrate specificities of several SVMPs and MMPs have been studied extensively. Many of them are capable of cleaving basement membrane components, including laminins, type IV collagen, entactin, and fibronectin. Some, but not others, can cleave gelatins, interstitial collagens, and proteoglycans (39Nagase H. Hooper N.M. Zinc Metalloproteases in Health and Disease. Taylor & Francis Ltd., London1996: 153-204Google Scholar, 42Bjarnason J.B. Fox J.W. Pharmacol. Ther. 1994; 62: 325-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Degradation of the extracellular matrix may lead to loss of tissue integrity and be an important component of the pathology of several diseases such as arthritis and cancer. With the recent discovery of ADAMs, the mammalian homologs of SVMPs, the substrate specificity and pathophysiological role of these proteins is now an exciting focus of investigation. ADAM 10, theDrosophila ADAM 10 homolog KUZ, and TACE have been shown to be involved in protein ectodomain shedding, but no ADAM has yet been demonstrated to degrade components of the extracellular matrix. The physiological substrate of ADAM 12 remains to be identified. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that ADAM 12-S is synthesized as a zymogen with the prodomain maintaining the metalloprotease in a latent state. Cleavage of the prodomain by a furin-type protease results in an ADAM 12 protein with proteolytic activity. We thank Drs. A. M. Mercurio and U. P.

https://openalex.org/W2160079091,"Abstract The relationship between GDP and cannabinoid-stimulated [35S]guanosine-5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) ([35S]GTPγS) binding was investigated in rat cerebellar membranes. Kinetic analyses showed that [35S]GTPγS binding reached steady-state levels and that the association rate was increased by the agonist WIN 55212-2 proportional to the concentration of GDP. Dissociation of [35S]GTPγS occurred with two rates (t½ = 7 and 170 min), and WIN 55212-2 increased the proportion of sites exhibiting the faster rate. Without GDP, [35S]GTPγS bound to membranes with high and low affinity, and WIN 55212-2 had no effect. With 30 μm GDP, [35S]GTPγS bound to low and intermediate affinity sites, and WIN 55212-2 induced high affinity [35S]GTPγS binding without affecting low affinity sites. GDP competed for high affinity [35S]GTPγS binding with high and intermediate affinity in the absence of WIN 55212-2 and with high and low affinity in the presence of WIN 55212-2. Cannabinoid ligands displayed differential abilities to maximally stimulate [35S]GTPγS binding in the presence of GDP. Efficacy differences among ligands increased with increasing GDP concentrations. GDP competition curves revealed that agonists induced low affinity GDP K i values that were proportional to agonist E max values, indicating that agonist efficacy is determined by displacement of GDP from G-proteins."

In a DNA transfer assay, SWAP preferentially recombines (“swaps”) sequences derived from Ig heavy chain switch regions.

Upon stimulation by antigen, expression of the early IgM class usually changes to that of another class (IgG3, IgG1, IgG2b, IgG2a, IgE, or IgA). At the DNA level, the process is mediated by recombination that generally involves DNA transfer between a switch (S) region within the intron 5′ to Cμ and another S region within the intron 5′ to the particular C-gene segment that is to be expressed (1Shimuzu A.

S regions, several kilobase pairs in length, contain short, G-rich repetitive sequence elements, often arranged in tandem arrays. They may adopt secondary structures, such as stem loops, and many break points are located at such structures (6Mussmann R. Courtet M. Schwager J. Du Pasquier L. Eur. J.

They lie scattered all over the S regions or, less often, even outside the S regions. Thus, class switch recombination is region-specific rather than site-specific. Rearrangements combining three S regions are occasionally detected (12Siebenkotten G. Esser C. Wabl M. Radbruch A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 1827-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and, although switch recombination is usually intrachromosomal (13Wabl M. Meyer J. Beck-Engeser G. Tenkhoff M. Burrows P.D. Nature. 1985; 313: 687-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), intermolecular rearrangements have also been observed (14Gerstein R.M. Frankel W.N. Hsieh C-L. Durdik J.M. Rath S. Coffin J.M.

Immunol. 1996; 217: 171-189PubMed Google Scholar), switch rearrangements generally result in deletion of the DNA sequences between the two breakpoints. The mechanism for most class switching events can be described by a loop-excision model (16Jäck H.M. McDowell M. Steinberg C.M. Wabl M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1581-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The exact structure of the loop intermediate is unknown; it may resemble a crossed (α) or a stem loop (Ω) conformation. In that model, after loop formation, four DNA ends are generated by endonucleolytic cleavage of the two S regions to be recombined; these ends are possibly protected or even fixed by proteins. Either (i) the four ends can be rejoined in their original configuration, (ii) the four ends can be inverted, or (iii) the intervening sequence can be circularized and removed while the remaining chromosomal DNA ends are joined together to yield the switched gene. Both inversions (16Jäck H.M. McDowell M. Steinberg C.M. Wabl M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To our knowledge, no recombination-specific function or recombination-related enzyme activity has yet been described for these proteins. We have screened extracts from switching B-cells for activities that preferentially recombine S-regions. Our assay measures stable DNA transfer, a central step of DNA recombination, from a plasmid containing Sμ to a plasmid containing another S region. A similar DNA transfer assay was instrumental in isolating a mammalian protein complex that repairs DNA gaps and deletions through recombination of homologous DNA substrates (24Jessberger R. Berg P.

Here we report the isolation of a protein complex—we call it SWAP—with a recombination activity that is specific for switching B-cells and prefers S-region substrates. We also report the identity of four of the proteins in the SWAP complex: B23 (nucleophosmin), C23 (nucleolin), poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and SWAP-70. B23 promotes single-strand DNA reannealing and the formation of joint molecules in a D-loop assay between homologous sequences but also between Sμ and Sγ sequences.

The Sμsubstrate consisted of an M13 double-stranded (ds) DNA carrying a 1.3-kilobase pair HindIII Sμ fragment (27DePinho R. Kruger R. Andrews N. Lutzker S. Baltimore D. Alt F.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 2905-2912Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and was labeled with digoxigenin (24Jessberger R. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 445-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The Sγ plasmid consisted of pSP72 containing a 3.7-kilobaseEcoRI-HindIII Sγ2b fragment (28Takahashi N. Kataoka T. Honjo T. Gene. 1980; 11: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and was internally labeled with [3H]thymidine. For the standard DNA transfer assay, 0.18 μg of the 3H-labeled DNA substrate (e.g. pSP-Sγ) was incubated together with 0.02 μg of the digoxigenin-labeled substrate (e.g. M13-Sμ) and varying amounts of protein in 50 μl containing 3 mm MgCl2, 30 mm EPPS, pH 7.4, 1 mm DTT, less than 50 mm ammonium sulfate, and 1 mm ATP. After 6 min, the reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS to 0.05% and EDTA to 50 mm. Further processing was as described (24Jessberger R. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 445-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and included a phenol-chloroform extraction step of the DNA prior to binding the products to anti-digoxigenin beads. The activity is expressed as a percentage of input 3H cpm, stably transferred to the recipient and bound to the beads. The protein purification procedures were carried out at 4 °C, and are summarized in Table I. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described (25Jessberger R. Podust V. Hübscher U. Berg P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15070-15079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from 1 × 108 to 8 × 108 lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (50 μg/ml) blasts (0.7 mg of nuclear protein/108 cells). Fraction I (2 mg of protein) was loaded onto a Superdex 200 FPLC gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and fractionated at a flow rate of 1 ml/min in Buffer E (5 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 0.2 mm EDTA, 15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 at 4 °C, and 1 mm PMSF, 10 mmNa2S2O5, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml TLCK, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin A) containing 80 mmammonium sulfate. 1.4-ml fractions were collected, active fractions were pooled (5.6 ml, 0.6 mg of protein, Fraction II), diluted 1:4 with Buffer E, and loaded at 1 ml/min onto a 1-ml Macro S cation exchange FPLC column (Bio-Rad). After washing the column with 20 column volumes of Buffer E-20 (E plus 20 mm ammonium sulfate), the proteins were eluted at a 1 ml/min flow rate with a gradient from 20 to 600 mm ammonium sulfate in Buffer E in 1.2-ml fractions. The switch-specific activity (2.4 ml, 0.011 mg of protein, Fraction III) eluted in two fractions at around 280 mm ammonium sulfate. For further purification, Fraction III was diluted 1:2 with Buffer E and loaded at 0.3 ml/min onto a 1 ml blue Sepharose (HiTrap, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) FPLC column (pre-equilibrated in E-140). Elution was with a linear gradient from 0 to 1000 mmammonium sulfate in Buffer E, and the activity eluted between 740 and 810 mm (0.6 ml, 6 ng of protein, Fraction IV). On ice or at −70 °C, the active fractions were stable for a short period only; frozen in liquid nitrogen, samples remained active for at least several weeks.Table IPurification of SWAPProtein fractionTotal proteinActivityProtein per reactionSpecific activityTotal unitsa1 unit = 0.1% cpm substrate DNA radioactivity transfered.μg% cpmngunits/mgI20002.730000.918000bContains large amounts of several different transfer activities.II6001.14002.81680III111.21580880IV0.60.960.91067640a 1 unit = 0.1% cpm substrate DNA radioactivity transfered.b Contains large amounts of several different transfer activities. Open table in a new tab The gene encoding SWAP-70 was cloned using a polymerase chain reaction strategy based on degenerate oligonucleotides derived from the N-terminal 26 amino acid residues and subsequent screening of a λ-ZAP mouse spleen cDNA library (Stratagene Inc.) with a nondegenerate oligonucleotide. The cDNA contained in the plasmid vector pBluescriptSK was excised from the phages, and the sequence of the SWAP-70 cDNA was determined. The cDNA was subcloned into the pQE-30 vector (Qiagen, Inc.) for expression as a His-tagged protein inE. coli. Purification of the protein was according to standard methods, including lysozyme-lysis of the cells, chromatography of the clear cell extract on a nickel-Sepharose column and elution at 80 mm imidazole, followed by gel filtration on a Superdex75 FPLC column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Gel retardation were performed in 10-μl reaction mixtures containing 0.2–1 ng (3000–6000 cpm) of32P-end-labeled DNA (230-bp EcoRI-KasI M13mp18 DNA fragment, or 49-nt ss oligonucleotide) in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and protein as indicated. After 20 min of incubation at room temperature, DNA-protein complexes were resolved by electrophoresis at 4 °C in nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA. All gels were fixed (60 min in 10% acetic acid, 10% ethanol), dried, and exposed for autoradiography. For azido-ATP labeling (29Knight K.L. McEntee K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 867-872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), reactions were carried out in 200 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm DTT, 5 μm8-N 3-[α-32P]ATP (9–20 Ci/mmol; ICN), and proteins (200 ng). Reaction mixtures were incubated on ice for 60 min and then irradiated for 50 s at a distance of 10 cm from a XL-1500 UV cross-linker (Spectronics Co.). After irradiation, proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. The DNA single-strand reannealing assay (3′ 32P-labeled, 422-nt DNA substrates) was performed as described (26Jessberger R. Riwar B. Baechtold H. Akhmedov A.T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4061-4068Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). For the standard D-loop assay, 100 ng (24 fmol) of predominantly supercoiled plasmid pUC-Sγ DNA or, for controls, DNA linearized outside the region of homology (Asp700 restriction enzyme digest) and 0.8 ng (100 fmol) of 5′-32P-labeled, 49-nt ss Sγ consensus sequence oligonucleotide (5′-GGGACCAGTCCTAGCAGCTGTGGGGGAGCTGGGGAAGGTGGGAGTGTGA; G/C content, 65%) (21Williams M. Maizels N. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2353-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) were incubated together with protein for 30 min at 37 °C in the standard DNA transfer reaction buffer (20 mm EPPS, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT). Reactions were stopped by addition of SDS to 0.1% and 4 μg of proteinase K and further incubation at 37 °C for 45 min. Routinely, products were analyzed in 0.7% agarose gels containing 3 mm magnesium acetate in the TAE buffer system. Gels were run at 2 V/cm for 16–24 h, stained with ethidium bromide, photographed to determine positions of the duplex DNA bands, dried, and exposed for autoradiography for 2–24 h. In later experiments, the magnesium acetate in the agarose gels was found not to be necessary, and the gels could be run at 4 V/cm without reducing the yield of joint molecules. For quantification of products, the ethidium bromide-stained bands were excised, the agarose was melted, and the 32P radioactivity was directly measured in a scintillation counter. The percentage of input 32P-oligonucleotide paired with the duplex DNA in the joint molecules was calculated. Many variations of the assay were performed and are described under “Results.” Some used an oligonucleotide, CS-3, containing the first 25 nt of the 49-nt Sγ sequence (G/C content, 68%) or the 22-nt T7 oligonucleotide (5′-GTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC) (G/C content, 45%), which is fully homologous to the plasmid pBluescriptSK. The pH variations were based on compounds of the polysulfonate buffer family. To assay for a DNA transfer activity that prefers S-region substrates, we labeled a plasmid (pSP72) containing Sγ2b sequences with [3H]thymidine and ds M13 containing Sμsequences with a small number of digoxigenin ligands. Recombinant DNA molecules were quantified by counting 3H in plasmid DNA that had been immunoprecipitated by an anti-digoxigenin antibody (Fig. 1 A); in this way, a direct and quantitative measurement of the catalytic activity leading to DNA transfer was obtained (19Jessberger R. Wabl M. Borggrefe T. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 217: 191-202PubMed Google Scholar, 24Jessberger R. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 445-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To an equimolar mixture of these two constructs, we added nuclear extracts from untreated spleen cells or from spleen cells cultivated for 2–3 days in the presence or absence of LPS (Fig. 1 B). Because these cultures contain non-B lymphocytes and other nonswitching cells, we separated the (switching) blasts from the nondividing (nonswitching) cells according to size by cell elutriation (30Sanderson R.J. Bird K.E. Palmer N.F. Brenman J. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 71: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and tested the nuclear extracts prepared from both cell pools for DNA transfer activity on S substratesversus non-S substrates (Fig. 1 B). Despite the expected presence of general DNA transfer activities in such an extract (24Jessberger R. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 445-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 25Jessberger R. Podust V. Hübscher U. Berg P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15070-15079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the crude nuclear extracts from LPS blasts recombined S region substrates 2–3-fold better than non-S region substrates (Fig. 2 A);i.e. a newly induced, specific activity is added on top of the general DNA swapping. This activity, called SWAP, is not present in extracts from nonswitching cells (Fig. 2 A) or in extracts from thymus cells (not shown). We purified SWAP by eluting it from a sizing column at a position corresponding to a molecular mass of globular proteins of 200–300 kDa (Fraction II). This fraction showed a 4-fold preference for S region substrates and was inactive when isolated from nonswitching cells (Fig. 2 A); no other previously observed DNA transfer assay activity, e.g. from HeLa cells or calf thymus (24Jessberger R. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 445-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 25Jessberger R. Podust V. Hübscher U. Berg P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15070-15079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), eluted at that position. The SWAP was further purified by cation exchange and blue Sepharose chromatography yielding Fraction IV with a preference for S region substrates of 10-fold (Figs. 2 B and3). With these purification steps, the specific activity increased more than 1000-fold (TableI). When an unrelated DNA,e.g. from M13, SV40, or ΦX174, was paired with an S region, SWAP activity was reduced, on the average, by 6-fold (Fig. 2 B). Fully homologous DNA substrates (5.7 kilobase pairs) recombined with less than half the efficiency of two S region substrates (not shown). Because the DNA is treated with SDS/EDTA and phenol extraction after the DNA transfer reaction, the linkage of the two substrates is considered stable and independent of the continuous presence of protein or Mg2+. More than 80% of the transfer products are heat-stable (20 min at 85 °C); the rest probably represents noncovalent reaction intermediates. Maximum product formation by Fraction IV (1 ng) occurred after 6 min of incubation at 37 °C and 3 mm MgCl2. Omission of the four dNTPs did not affect the reaction significantly, but lack of ATP rendered the reaction 88% less efficient. Polymerase chain reaction analysis and subcloning of the bead-bound recombination products confirmed the presence of covalent Sγ-Sμ junctions among the DNA transfer products (not shown). Purified SWAP fractions had no detectable DNA polymerase, DNA helicase, general endonuclease, or general exonuclease activity (not shown). On silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels there were about 12 and 7 polypeptides left in Fractions III and IV, respectively (Fig. 4). When heavily stained, species were seen in Fraction IV with molecular masses of approximately 38, 50, 70, 75, 100, 115, and 160 kDa, of which the 70-kDa species is clearly the most prominent. We gel-eluted and partially sequenced the 38-, 70-, and 115-kDa proteins. The 38-kDa protein yielded tryptic peptides TVSLGAG and FINYVK, which are identical to residues 46–52 and 266–271 of mouse B23 (nucleophosmin) (31Chan P.K. Chan W.Y. Yung B.Y.M. Cook R.G. Aldrich M.B. Ku D. Goldknopf I.L. Busch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14335-14341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 115-kDa protein yielded tryptic peptides TLGDFLAEYAK and TTNFAGILSQG, which are identical to residues 108–118 and 864–874, respectively, of mouse PARP (32Cherney B.W. McBride O.W. Chen D. Alkhatib H. Bhatia K. Hensley P. Smulson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8370-8374Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). These protein identifications were confirmed by Western blotting experiments (not shown). The N terminus of the 70-kDa protein was MRGLKDELLKAIWHAFTALDLDRS, which was not present in the molecular biology data bases. The cDNA of SWAP-70, the novel 70-kDa protein, was cloned and sequenced (Fig. 5). SWAP-70 does not belong to a known protein family, and its 586-amino acid sequence contains nuclear localization signals at positions 222–225, 281–284, and 361–376. There is a possible coiled-coil region between amino acids 320 and 450, as well as a potential O-glycosylation site at amino acids 314–315, a continuous hydrophilic region near its C terminus, and several potential phosphorylation sites for several protein kinases. A fourth SWAP component is described in the next section. The 200–300-kDa gel filtration elution position of SWAP suggests a protein complex, and we looked for high affinity interactions between B23, PARP, and SWAP-70. His-tagged SWAP-70 was overexpressed from E. coli and purified to near homogeneity as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 6 A). Purified SWAP-70 protein (Fraction II) was bound to Sepharose beads as an affinity tag for proteins contained in a nuclear extract from LPS-induced, switching B-cells. About 1 mg of extract was loaded at 25 mm ammonium sulfate. The bound material was stepwise eluted with 80, 120, 300, 600, and 1200 mm ammonium sulfate, and the fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. The 300 and 600 mm fractions contained about 10 polypeptides, as judged from silver-stained gels (not shown). On immunoblots, PARP peaked in the 300 mm fraction (Fig. 6 B), and B23 peaked in the 300 and 600 mmfractions (Fig. 6 C), corresponding to 600 and 1200 mm ionic strength, respectively, of a monovalent salt; this result suggests high affinity binding. Preincubation of the SWAP-70 affinity column with polyclonal anti-SWAP-70 antibodies completely abolished its ability to retain any of the other components of the complex (not shown). Using the affinity column to look for additional proteins forming a complex with SWAP-70, we identified the 100-kDa polypeptide observed in Fractions III and IV of the SWAP complex (Fig. 4). Because it associates with B23 (33Li Y-P. Busch R.K. Valdez B.C. Busch H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and has a similar molecular mass, C23 (nucleolin) was a good candidate for this protein. Using anti-C23 antibodies on Western blots, we detected two cross-reacting polypeptides of 95–100 kDa in the 300 mm ammonium sulfate fraction, likely representing two phosphorylation forms of this heavily modified protein. A third band of lower molecular mass may be a degradation product (34Ghisolfi-Nieto L. Gerard J. Puvion-Dutilleul F. Amalric F. Bouvet P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 34-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6 D). Thus, a fourth component of the SWAP complex is C23, which also binds to SWAP-70 with high affinity. C23 has been described as a subunit of LR1, a B-cell-specific heterodimer that specifically binds switch region DNA (21Williams M. Maizels N. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2353-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 35Hanakahi L.A. Dempsey L.A. Li M-J. Maizels N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3605-3610Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of nuclear extracts of various tissues from 4-week-old C57BL/6 mice were analyzed by Western blotting with affinity purified polyclonal anti-SWAP-70 antibodies. Although there may be low level expression in other tissues, SWAP-70 is strongly expressed only in B-cells that have been induced to switch (Fig. 7 A). Low expression in spleen and in lymph nodes presumably results from the few activated B-cells present in any 4-week-old mice. However, only spleen cells stimulated with LPS and concanavalin A (ConA) express SWAP-70 at high levels. Importantly, SWAP-70 is not expressed in thymocytes, nor in activated, proliferating T-cells. ConA stimulates T-cells, and these in turn stimulate B spleen cells, which then express SWAP-70 at high levels (Fig. 7, A and B); about half of the cells in ConA-stimulated spleen cell cultures are activated B-cells (not shown). In mice lacking B-cells (36Kitamura D. Roes J. Kühn R. Rajewsky K. Nature. 1991; 350: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1544) Google Scholar), ConA did not induce the expression of SWAP-70 (Fig. 7 B). However, LPS-stimulated cells from mice lacking T-cells (34Ghisolfi-Nieto L. Gerard J. Puvion-Dutilleul F. Amalric F. Bouvet P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 34-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) contain high levels of SWAP-70 (Fig. 7 B). In a culture of proliferating pre-B-cells (37Malissen M. Gill A. Rocha B. Trucy J. Vivier E. Boyer C. Köntgen F. Brun N. Mazza G. Spanopoulou E. Guy-Grand D. Malissen B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4347-4358Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), SWAP-70 is highly expressed only when the cells are stimulated with anti-CD40 antibodies and IL-4 to induce switching primarily to the IgE isotype (38Rolink A. Melchers F. Andersson J. Immunity. 1996; 5: 319-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7 C). Similarily, high expression of SWAP-70 was seen 3–5 days after induction of switching to IgA in the cell line I.29-D22 by treatment with LPS and transforming growth factor-β (39Shockett P. Stavnezer J. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6962-6976PubMed Google Scholar) (not shown). SWAP-70 is also expressed at high levels expressed in the pre-B-cell line 18–81, which undergoes class switching (40Burrows P.D. Beck G.B. Wabl M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 564-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 41Burrows P.D. Beck-Engeser G.B. Wabl M.R. Nature. 1993; 306: 243-246Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar), but only at low levels in the pre-B-cell line 70Z/3, which does not switch (Fig. 7 D). In these cell lines, an approximately 45-kDa polypeptide cross-reacts with the antibodies and might be a proteolytic degradation product of SWAP-70. To directly study DNA binding properties of SWAP-70, gel shift experiments were performed. As shown in Fig. 8 A, SWAP-70 bound to DNA. This binding does not require Mg2+ and is even somewhat reduced by its presence. Increasing amounts of SWAP-70 (20 and 40 ng) bound more DNA, but only about 5% of the input DNA was bound, even under optimal conditions. The oligonucleotide used for the experiment shown in Fig. 8 A contains the 49-nt Sγ consensus signal (28Takahashi N. Kataoka T. Honjo T. Gene. 1980; 11: 117-127Crossref Pub"

Mutations in the human PheOH gene cause phenylketonuria, a common autosomal recessive metabolic disorder that in untreated patients often results in varying degrees of mental retardation. We have determined the crystal structure of human PheOH (residues 118–452). The enzyme crystallizes as a tetramer with each monomer consisting of a catalytic and a tetramerization domain. The tetramerization domain is characterized by the presence of a domain swapping arm that interacts with the other monomers forming an antiparallel coiled-coil. The structure is the first report of a tetrameric PheOH and displays an overall architecture similar to that of the functionally related tyrosine hydroxylase. In contrast to the tyrosine hydroxylase tetramer structure, a very pronounced asymmetry is observed in the phenylalanine hydroxylase, caused by the occurrence of two alternate conformations in the hinge region that leads to the coiled-coil helix. Examination of the mutations causing PKU shows that some of the most frequent mutations are located at the interface of the catalytic and tetramerization domains. Their effects on the structural and cellular stability of the enzyme are discussed. Phenylalanine hydroxylase (PheOH) catalyzes the conversion of l-phenylalanine tol-tyrosine, the rate-limiting step in the oxidative degradation of phenylalanine.

Mammalian phenylalanine hydroxylase (PheOH, 1The abbreviations used are: PheOH, phenylalanine hydroxylase; PKU, phenylketonuria; TyrOH, tyrosine hydroxylase; TrpOH, tryptophan hydroxylase; MES, (2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid); Bis-Tris-propane,2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. 1The abbreviations used are: PheOH, phenylalanine hydroxylase; PKU, phenylketonuria; TyrOH, tyrosine hydroxylase; TrpOH, tryptophan hydroxylase; MES, (2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid); Bis-Tris-propane,2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. phenylalanine 4-monooxygenase, EC 1.14.16.1) is an iron- and tetrahydropterin-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the hydroxylation of l-phenylalanine (l-Phe) tol-tyrosine. The reaction is the rate-limiting step in the catabolic pathway of phenylalanine resulting in the complete degradation of the amino acid. PheOH activity is tightly regulated by reversible phosphorylation and substrate activation. Mutations in the human PheOH gene result in the metabolic disorder known as phenylketonuria (PKU), a relatively common autosomal recessive disease that, if not diagnosed and properly treated from birth, ultimately leads to severe mental retardation. Approximately 280 mutant alleles of the human PheOH gene have been identified in patients with PKU and non-PKU hyperphenylalaninemia (1Hoang L. Byck S. Prevost L. Scriver C.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 127-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The mutations lead to a variety of clinical and biochemical phenotypes with different degrees of severity (2Okano Y. Eisensmith R.C Güttler F. Lichter-Konecki U. Konecki D.S. Trefz F.K. Dasovich M. Wang T. Henriksen K. Lou H. Woo S.L.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1991; 324: 1232-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 3Svensson E. Iselius L. Hagenfeldt L. J. Inherited Metab. Dis. 1994; 17: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). PheOH shares many biochemical and physical properties with tyrosine hydroxylase (TyrOH) and tryptophan hydroxylase (TrpOH) suggesting that they evolved from a common ancestor and might constitute a family of structurally related proteins (for review, see Ref. 4Hufton S.E. Jennings I.G. Cotton R.G.H. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 353-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). PheOH, TyrOH, and TrpOH catalyze similar hydroxylation reactions using the same nonheme iron atom but differ in their substrate specificity. All three hydroxylases are organized into three domains: a 12–19-kDa N-terminal domain involved in regulation of the activity followed by a segment of about 38 kDa, which consist of a catalytic domain and a 5-kDa tetramerization domain. The crystal structure of a dimeric form of PheOH (5Erlandsen H. Fusetti F. Martinez A. Hough E. Flatmark T. Stevens R.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 995-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) containing only the catalytic domain shows a remarkable similarity to the previously reported structure of TyrOH (6Goodwill K.E. Sabatier C. Marks C. Raag R. Fitzpatrick P.F. Stevens R.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The tetramerization domain, located at the C terminus of TyrOH, is characterized by the presence of a long helix that promotes oligomerization through a coiled-coil motif (6Goodwill K.E. Sabatier C. Marks C. Raag R. Fitzpatrick P.F. Stevens R.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The sequence homology among the aromatic amino acid hydroxylases is very high, particularly in the catalytic and tetramerization domains (6Goodwill K.E. Sabatier C. Marks C. Raag R. Fitzpatrick P.F. Stevens R.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 7Ledley F.D. DiLella A.G. Kwok S.C.M. Woo S.L.C.

Proteolysis experiments on rat PheOH and TyrOH have shown that deletion of the N-terminal domain results in active truncated proteins with reduced substrate binding specificity. The attachment of either N-terminal regulatory domain (as chimeric proteins) enhances the substrate specificity displayed by the catalytic domain (9Daubner S.C. Hillas P.J. Fitzpatrick P.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11574-11582Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Since the discovery of the relationship between PKU and mutations in PheOH, the enzyme has been the subject of intense biochemical and genetic studies but for many years it has been difficult to gain detailed structural information on PheOH. Crystallization and diffraction to 2.7 Å resolution of a phosphorylated tetrameric form of full-length PheOH was reported several years ago (10Celikel R. Davis M.D. Dai X. Kaufman S. Xuong N.-H. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 495-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), but no structure determination was completed from those studies. More recent crystallization experiments have shown that highly diffracting crystals can be obtained only for dimeric forms of PheOH missing the C-terminal tetramerization domain (11Erlandsen H. Martinez A. Knappskog P.M. Haavik J. Hough E. Flatmark T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 406: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 12Kobe B. Jennings I.G. House C.M. Feil S.C. Michell B.J. Tiganis T. Parker M.W. Cotton R.G.H. Kemp B.E. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1352-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Here we report the first crystallization and structure determination of a truncated form of human tetrameric PheOH (residues 118–452) to which we will refer as PheOHCterm. The crystal structure of PheOH reveals that within one monomer the catalytic and tetramerization domains can adopt two different orientations, thus forming a tetramer similar to that in TyrOH (6Goodwill K.E. Sabatier C. Marks C. Raag R. Fitzpatrick P.F. Stevens R.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) but with an unexpected asymmetry in the packing of the four subunits. Because some of the most common PKU mutations map at the junction between catalytic and tetramerization domain, this structure of PheOH can provide a template for analyzing the molecular basis of PheOH deficiency. The gene encoding the catalytic and the tetramerization domain of human PheOH (residues 118–452 of human phenylalanine hydroxylase, PheOHCterm), cloned into vector pET-3a-d (Novagen), was overexpressed inEscherichia coli BL21. For protein purification, frozen cell paste was resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 20 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 3 mmmethionine, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell lysis was started by adding lysozyme and completed by French press treatment. All purification steps were performed at 4 °C. The soluble fraction of the protein extract was diluted with one volume of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 5% glycerol, 3 mm methionine and applied onto a DEAE Fast Flow column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The fractions containing PheOHCterm were pooled, and the protein was further purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation at 30–50% saturation. The precipitate was resuspended in 50 mm MES buffer, pH 5.8, 2.5% glycerol, 3 mm methionine and loaded onto a Perseptive Biosystem HS column and eluted with a NaCl gradient. PheOHCterm fractions were pooled, concentrated and further purified by size-exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 Pharmacia column eluted with 50 mm Bis-Tris-propane buffer, pH 7.0, 200 mm NaCl, 2.5% glycerol, 3 mm methionine. After adding 2 mm dithiothreitol, the protein was concentrated to about 10 mg/ml in an Amicon pressure cell. The purified PheOHCterm appeared homogeneous (tetramer) as assessed by size-exclusion chromatography and silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Initial crystallization conditions were identified by using the sparse matrix approach (14Jancarik J. Kim S.H. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 409-411Crossref Scopus (2077) Google Scholar). PheOHCterm was crystallized at room temperature by hanging drop vapor diffusion from 0.6 mMgSO4, 0.2 m sodium, potassium tartrate, 10% polyethylene glycol 4000, 100 mm Bis-Tris-propane buffer, pH 7.0. Crystals grew within 1–2 days as triangular plates with dimension 0.6 × 0.6 × 0.2-mm3 in space group P3112 (a = b = 119.5 Å,c = 126.0 Å, α = β = 90°, γ = 120°). The asymmetric unit contains two PheOHCterm monomers, each consisting of a catalytic and a tetramerization domain. Two asymmetric units form one tetramer by a crystallographic two-fold symmetry axis. The solvent content is about 60%. To obtain good diffraction it was essential to harvest and flash freeze the crystals immediately after growth was completed (1–2 days). X-ray diffraction data to 3.1 Å were collected at Beam Line 7–1 of the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) on flash frozen crystals. A solution of 30% glycerol in 25% mother liquor was used as a cryoprotectant. The programs DENZO and SCALEPACK were used for data processing and reduction (15Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38440) Google Scholar). A total of 120,922 measurements were recorded for 18,446 unique reflections. The data set is 99% complete between 20 and 3.1 Å with an R merge value of 7.5%. The PheOHCterm structure was solved by molecular replacement. The search model was based on the atomic coordinates of the crystal structure of tyrosine hydroxylase (6Goodwill K.E. Sabatier C. Marks C. Raag R. Fitzpatrick P.F. Stevens R.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), because the crystal structure of PheOH (5Erlandsen H. Fusetti F. Martinez A. Hough E. Flatmark T. Stevens R.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 995-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) was not yet available when the present study was started. The amino acid sequence identity between the catalytic domains of PheOH and TyrOH is approximately 80%. The best search model included only the catalytic domain of TyrOH in which all the residues that were not identical in the two proteins were replaced with alanine. Molecular replacement was performed using the program AMoRe (16Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5027) Google Scholar, 17CCP4 Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19729) Google Scholar). In the cross-rotation function all data between 8 and 4.0 Å were used and model Patterson vectors were selected within a radius of 30 Å. The translation function and a subsequent step of rigid body refinement were carried out with all data between 8 and 4.0 Å. This procedure allowed a clear identification of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The search for monomer A gave a correlation coefficient of 33% and an R-factor of 50%, whereas the search for monomer B gave a correlation coefficient of 22% and anR-factor of 53%. Orientation and position of the dimer obtained by molecular replacement were improved by rigid body refinement using the program X-PLOR (18Brünger A.T. X-PLOR.Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). This lowered theR-factor to 41% and provided a more accurate definition of the noncrystallographic two-fold operator. The ςA weighted ‖Fo‖ − ‖Fc‖ maps (19Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1986; 42: 140-149Crossref Scopus (2035) Google Scholar) calculated at this stage showed electron density for the helices forming the coiled-coil domain that were not included in the search model. Simulated annealing omit maps (20Hodel A. Kim S.-H. Brünger A.T. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1992; 48: 851-858Crossref Scopus (393) Google Scholar) were calculated for manual model building with the program “O” (21Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowans S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar). Strict noncrystallographic symmetry was initially imposed during the refinement. After addition of the tetramerization domain the restrain option was used because the relative positions of the core and the tetramerization domains within the tetramer are described by different noncrystallographic two-fold operators. The refinement was performed imposing tight noncrystallographic symmetry restraints (weight of 300) for the core of the catalytic domain (residues 118–393) but relaxed restraints for the tetramerization domain (weight of 10). Alternating refinement cycles with X-PLOR (18Brünger A.T. X-PLOR.Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) and model building produced the final structure. In the final model all residues are defined in the electron density with the exception of residues 138–144. The final model of the two subunits in the asymmetric unit, comprising 654 residues, has an R-factor of 22.7% for all measured data between 20 and 3.1 Å and anR-free of 33.7% (22Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3854) Google Scholar). The final structure has a root mean square deviation in bond length and angles of 0.006 Å and 1.7°, respectively. A truncated form of PheOH including the catalytic and tetramerization domains, residues 118–452, was expressed in E. coli, purified and crystallized. This fragment of PheOH (PheOHCterm) retains full catalytic properties but is more soluble than the wild-type enzyme. Dynamic light scattering analysis and size-exclusion chromatography revealed that the recombinant purified protein is 99% monodisperse in solution with a calculated molecular mass around 160 kDa, corresponding to a tetramer (data not shown). PheOHCterm crystallizes in space group P3112 with two molecules in the asymmetric unit forming a tetramer (dimer of dimers) through the crystallographic two-fold symmetry (Fig. 1). The structure was solved by molecular replacement using a model derived from the crystal structure of TyrOH. The PheOHCterm catalytic domain contains 13 α-helices and 8 β-strands and is identical, within coordinate error, to the structure of a dimeric form of PheOH recently determined at 2.0 Å resolution, which we will refer to as PheOHCat (5Erlandsen H. Fusetti F. Martinez A. Hough E. Flatmark T. Stevens R.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 995-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The PheOHCterm catalytic domain in the tetramer structure can be superimposed on the corresponding domain of the TyrOHCterm structure with a root mean square deviation of 0.64 Å for all the Cα atoms. The active site of human PheOHCterm is located in a deep cleft in the core of each monomer and is very similar to that of TyrOHCterm. Although iron was not added during the purification and crystallization procedures, electron density compatible with that of a metal ion is present in the catalytic center in the same site as seen in the structure of TyrOHCterm (6Goodwill K.E. Sabatier C. Marks C. Raag R. Fitzpatrick P.F. Stevens R.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) and PheOHCat (5Erlandsen H. Fusetti F. Martinez A. Hough E. Flatmark T. Stevens R.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 995-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). His-285, His-290, and Glu-330 coordinate the iron in agreement with site-directed mutagenesis studies (23Gibbs B.S. Wojchowski D. Benkovic S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8046-8052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Balasubramanian S. Carr R.T. Bender C.J. Peisach J. Benkovic S.J.

Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2082-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and with the structure of PheOHCat. Glu-286, proposed to be involved in pterin binding in PheOH but not in TyrOH (26Dickson P.W. Jennings I.G. Cotton R.G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20369-20375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), occupies nearly identical positions in both structures. The absence of significant structural differences in the active site of PheOHCterm and TyrOHCterm is not surprising because a similar low substrate binding specificity is observed for the catalytic domains in steady-state kinetic analyses (9Daubner S.C. Hillas P.J. Fitzpatrick P.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11574-11582Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The architecture of the PheOHCterm matches the overall fold and organization found in the structure of TyrOHCterm (6Goodwill K.E. Sabatier C. Marks C. Raag R. Fitzpatrick P.F. Stevens R.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The assembly of PheOH and TyrOH might be described by a domain swapping mechanism in which secondary structural elements mutually switch their position to promote oligomerization (27Bennett M.J. Schlunegger M.P. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2455-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). The tetramerization domain is formed by a C-terminal “arm” consisting of two β-strands, forming a β-ribbon, and a 40 Å long α-helix. The C-terminal arm extends over a neighboring monomer bringing the four helices (one from each monomer) into a tightly packed anti-parallel coiled-coil motif in the center of the structure (Fig. 1). In the PheOH structure the tetramer is formed by two conformationally different dimers resulting in a distortion of the 222 symmetry. A superposition of the two monomers shows that the catalytic domains and tetramerization domains, if taken separately, are identical but they adopt different relative orientations (Fig. 2 A). The distortion of the tetramer symmetry is also evident from a surface calculation: in the PheOHCterm the subunits interact with a buried surface area of about 1200 Å2 and 1700 Å2, across the crystallographic 2-fold dimerization interfaces AC and BD, respectively (Fig. 1). The buried surface calculated for the TyrOHCterm structure is about 1600 Å2for both dimerization interfaces AC and BD. The discrepancy results from a change in backbone conformation at the hinge region that connects the β-ribbon to the coiled-coil helix accompanied by another rotation in the coiled-coil helix. Using the program DYNDOM (28Hayward S. Berendsen H.J.C. Proteins. 1998; 30: 144-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar) it was possible to identify two rotation points in the tetramerization domain. The first hinge axis is found at residue Thr 427 leading to a 22° movement of the catalytic domain with respect to the tetramerization domain. All the residues in the hinge (425–429) are nicely defined in electron density, except for Thr-427, which is very disordered indicating flexibility in this part of the polypeptide chain. The second change in backbone conformation is found at residue Gly-442 that generates a kink in the coiled-coil helix and a rotation of about 20° (Fig. 2 B). A conformational change in the helix could be necessary to preserve the coiled-coil interactions in response to the change in relative orientation of the subunits. In the TyrOH sequence Thr-427 and Gly-442 are replaced by a proline and a histidine residue, repectively (Fig. 2 C). It has recently been proposed that the presence of a proline in the exchanging arm induces conformational constraints on the peptide backbone that favor the optimal conformation for oligomerization (29Bergdoll M. Remy M.-H. Cagnon C. Masson J.-M. Dumas P. Structure (Lond.). 1997; 5: 391-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 C and Fig. 3, both PheOH and TyrOH sequences contain a total of three proline residues in the tetramerization domain. In PheOHCterm two prolines (Pro-407 and Pro-409) define the sharp turn that links the tetramerization domain to the catalytic domain. Another proline is also found at the C-terminal end of β-strand 7 (residue 416), but no proline residue is located at the last hinge region connecting to the coiled-coil where the conformational change is detected. The lack of a proline residue at this position may allow more flexibility at this linker region and modulate the arrangement of the quaternary structure in PheOH. In TyrOH, a proline residue is present in each of the hinge regions of the tetramerization domain, probably stabilizing its domain-swapped conformation. Full-length PheOH has been described to exist as both a tetramer and dimer in a pH-dependent equilibrium and possibly as some monomer (4Hufton S.E. Jennings I.G. Cotton R.G.H. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 353-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 30Kappock T.J. Harkins P.C. Friedenberg S. Caradonna J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30532-30544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Lowering the pH, as well as binding ofl-phenylalanine, shifts the equilibrium toward the tetrameric form of PheOH (31Martinez A. Knappskog P.M. Olafsdottir S. Døskeland A.P. Eiken H.G. Svebak R.M. Bozzini M.L. Apold J. Flatmark T. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 32Knappskog P.M. Flatmark T. Aarden J.M. Haavik J. Martinez A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 813-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). By contrast, TyrOH and TrpOH are always reported to be a tetramer in solution (4Hufton S.E. Jennings I.G. Cotton R.G.H. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 353-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Truncated forms of PheOH and TyrOH where the C-terminal domain is left intact have so far only been isolated as tetramers. Removal of the last 34 residues at the C terminus results in dimeric (PheOH) or monomeric (TyrOH) active hydroxlases. The three-dimensional structure of the PheOHCterm tetramer matches the overall fold and organization found in the structure of tetrameric TyrOHCterm (6Goodwill K.E. Sabatier C. Marks C. Raag R. Fitzpatrick P.F. Stevens R.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Despite the high degree of sequence and structural identity, superposition of TyrOHCtermand PheOHCterm shows that the relative orientation of the subunits forming the tetramer is different in the two enzymes. The difference is caused by a distortion of the 222-fold symmetry in the PheOH tetramer, whereas in the TyrOH tetramer the four subunits are related by crystallographic symmetry and form a dimer of dimers with only two unique subunit-subunit interfaces (6Goodwill K.E. Sabatier C. Marks C. Raag R. Fitzpatrick P.F. Stevens R.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). With the evidence of a conformational change at hand it is tempting to hypothesize whether this structural difference is physiologically meaningful. PheOH and TyrOH share a common catalytic mechanism in which reduced pterin cofactor, molecular oxygen, and iron are required to hydroxylate the aromatic amino acid, but they are regulated through different mechanisms. PheOH activation is believed to be achieved by specific phosphorylation on the regulatory domain and/or by substrate activation. During the past few years the mechanism of activation has been the subject of intense biochemical and spectroscopic studies, which have showed that activation of PheOH by the substrate is highly cooperative and always accompanied by alterations in the tertiary structure, but the nature of the conformational change has not been ascertained yet. Substrate activation has been proposed to involve cooperativity among all four subunits of the tetramer (33Martinez A. Olafsdottir S. Flatmark T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 34Shiman R. Jones S.H. Gray D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11633-11642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and radiation target analysis has shown that activation of PheOH results in modification of the monomer structure and promotes stronger association at the dimer interface (35Davis M.D. Parniak M.A. Kaufman S. Kempner E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 491-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These results are further supported by evidence of increase in volume of the tetrameric protein (30Kappock T.J. Harkins P.C. Friedenberg S. Caradonna J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30532-30544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and by a shift of the dimer ↔ tetramer equilibrium toward the tetrameric form (31Martinez A. Knappskog P.M. Olafsdottir S. Døskeland A.P. Eiken H.G. Svebak R.M. Bozzini M.L. Apold J. Flatmark T. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) upon binding of l-phenylalanine. Recent infrared spectroscopic studies (36Chehin R. Thorolfsson M. Knappskog P.M. Martinez A. Flatmark T. Arrondo J.L.R. Muga A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) led to the same conclusion and have also shown that the alterations measured upon PheOH activation are not accompanied by any measurable changes in the secondary structure. The asymmetric structure of the PheOHCterm tetramer could represent an intermediate state and could suggest that high flexibility in the tetramerization domain is required to optimally orient the domains for catalysis. Further experiments are required to understand if and how the observed asymmetry of the tetramer is related to cooperative substrate activation. A possible contribution to the conformational heterogeneity in the crystal structure of PheOHCterm could be a chemical modification. PheOHCterm crystals lose their diffraction power after a few days and mass spectroscopy analysis shows a time-dependent heterogeneity of the protein in solution. Two-dimensional electrophoresis of full-length recombinant wild-type human PheOH (as isolated from E. coli) has shown a microheterogeneity in terms of isoelectric point (five components), which has been proposed (37Døskeland A.P. Flatmark T. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 941-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and recently proven 2T. Solstad and T. Flatmark, unpublished data. to be a result of progressive deamidation of rather labile amide groups. Studies on short peptides have demonstrated that the rate of nonenzymatic deamidation of asparagine residues primarily depends on the amino acid at positions n − 1 and n + 1, with half-lives from a few hours, when the residue in the n + 1 position is a glycine, to several days (38Tyler-Cross R. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22549-22556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Polar residues preceding Asn and neighboring Ser and Thr increase deamidation rates, whereas bulky, nonhydrophobic residues preceding Asn correlate with low deamidation rates (38Tyler-Cross R. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22549-22556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Deamidation may result in marked conformational changes as first shown for bovine heart cytochrome c (39Flatmark T. Sletten K. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1623-1629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence positions of the labile amide groups in PheOH are, however, not yet identified. Two putative targets for nonenzymatic deamidation are both highly conserved within the mammalian PheOH, and map on the tetramerization domain, Asn-426 (Asp-Asn-Thr), in the hinge loop that seems to confer high flexibility to the tetramerization domain and Asn-438 (Ile-Asn-Ser) in the middle of the coiled coil. Asn-426 and Asn-438 are well defined by the electron density, but Thr-427 is very weakly outlined. Mutation of these residues may confirm if a nonenzymatic deamidation mechanism is responsible for the heterogeneity of PheOHCterm and for the difficulties encountered in the crystallization of this enzyme in its tetrameric form. In discussing the implications of the asymmetric organization of PheOHCterm we should also consider that the observed arrangement could be the result of crystal packing interactions. This possibility can be excluded because the catalytic domains are nearly identical in both the dimeric and tetrameric form of PheOH as well as in the TyrOH structure, even though they crystallize in different space groups. PKU is a common recessive genetic disease caused by mutations in the human PheOH gene. PKU was the first inborn error of metabolism shown to affect the central nervous system and the first form of mental retardation related to a specific enzymatic defect (40Følling I. Acta Paediatr. 1994; 407: 4-10Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Approximately 280 mutant alleles have been identified so far and they have been associated with different degrees of PKU severity (for review see Refs. 2Okano Y. Eisensmith R.C Güttler F. Lichter-Konecki U. Konecki D.S. Trefz F.K. Dasovich M. Wang T. Henriksen K. Lou H. Woo S.L.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1991; 324: 1232-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar and 3Svensson E. Iselius L. Hagenfeldt L. J. Inherited Metab. Dis. 1994; 17: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar and PKU data base:http://www.mcgill.ca/pahdb). The majority of PKU mutations map onto the catalytic domain, but 12 mutations occur in residues at the interface of the catalytic and tetramerization domain or within the tetramerization domain. Of particular interest in this study are the mutations that have been shown by expression studies to severely affect the stability of the enzyme. The splicing mutation IVS12ntg→a in intron 12 of the human PheOH gene is the most prevalent PKU allele among Caucasians (41DiLella A.G. Marvit J. Lidsky A.S. Güttler F. Woo S.L.C. Nature. 1986; 322: 799-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The clinical and metabolic phenotype of homozygotes with the mutation is a severe (“classical”) form of PKU. The mutation leads to the synthesis of a truncated form lacking the last 52 C-terminal amino acids, which include the tetramerization domain. Expression studies in eukaryotic systems indicated that the deletion abolished PheOH activity in the cell as a result of protein instability. Another frequent allele is caused by a CGG-to-TGG transition in exon 12, resulting in an amino acid substitution Arg/Trp at position 408. This mutation also results in undetectable levels of PheOH in vivo and in vitro and a severe metabolic PKU phenotype (42DiLella A.G. Marvit J. Brayton K. Woo S.L.C. Nature. 1987; 327: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Analysis of the TyrOH and PheOH structures shows that the highly conserved Arg-408 is located on the hinge loop that connects the tetramerization arm to the core of the PheOH monomer, flanked by the above mentioned Pro-407 and Pro-409 (Fig. 3). The arginine side chain is buried and forms a hydrogen bond with the main chain carbonyl of Leu-308, Leu-309, and Leu-311 at the C-terminal end of helix 8. Arg-408 could be involved in stabilizing domain swapping and promoting oligomerization by anchoring the tetramerization arm onto the catalytic domain in a proper orientation. Correct alignment of arm exchange in domain swapping is believed to be necessary for the association process (27Bennett M.J. Schlunegger M.P. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2455-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). This suggestion is consistent with the analysis of mutation R408Q that causes a non-PKU hyperphenylalaninemia in homozygotes (43Eiken H.G. Stangeland K. Skjelkvåle L. Knappskog P.M. Boman H. Apold J. Hum. Genet. 1992; 88: 608-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Expression of R408Q mutants in E. coli results in the synthesis of a tetrameric form of the enzyme with high residual activity. 3P. M. Knappskog, E. Bjørgo, and T. Flatmark, unpublished data. Mutations R252W, A259L/T, F299C, and L311P (43Eiken H.G. Stangeland K. Skjelkvåle L. Knappskog P.M. Boman H. Apold J. Hum.

Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2881-2885Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) also result in extremely reduced levels of PheOH and are associated with severe PKU phenotype. As described above, the carbonyl atom of Leu-311 forms a hydrogen bond with Arg-408. Residue Ala-259 is buried in a hydrophobic pocket about 4 Å from Leu-311 and Leu-308; a larger or polar residue cannot be accommodated without disturbing the surrounding environment. Phe-299 is also involved in hydrophobic interactions that stabilize the helix where Leu-311 is located and Arg-252 forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl atom of Ala-313. As shown in Fig. 3, these mutations map in the same region as Arg-408, and they could dramatically alter the hydrogen bond network or produce steric hindrance, interfering with the correct positioning of the β-ribbon. It is likely that their effect will have consequences for the arrangement of the catalytic and tetramerization domains and thus for the normal oligomerization process. Mutation Y414C has also been reported, and the expressed enzyme retains approximately 50% of normal activity (46Okano Y. Eisensmith R.C. Dasovich M. Wang T. Guttler F. Woo S.L.C. Eur. J. Pediatr. 1991; 150: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The mild effect of this mutation can be observed also at structural level: a substitution Tyr → Cys in this position should not have drastic consequences on the interactions with the neighboring residues (Fig. 3). One of the most frequent alleles in the oriental population is the missense mutation R413P in exon 12, which causes a severe metabolic form of PKU. This mutation results in protein instability with almost undetectable levels of PheOH when expressed in eukaryotic cells (47Wang T. Okano Y. Eisensmith R.C. Harvey M.L. Lo W.H.Y. Huang S.Z. Zeng Y.T. Yuan L.F. Furuyama J.I. Oura T. Sommer S.S. Woo S.L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2146-2150Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Arg-413 is located in the middle of the first strand (β7) of the β-ribbon in the tetramerization domain. A proline residue in this position would disrupt the main chain to main chain hydrogen bond network that stabilizes the β-ribbon. The PKU mutation R413P most certainly leads to extreme disorder of the tetramerization arm thus compromising the normal oligomeric state and stability of PheOH. The analysis of these mutations suggest that changes in the β-ribbon have major effects on the stability of the enzyme. The possibility that the β-ribbon represents a mutation “hot spot” points to the structural importance of this element.

To elucidate the molecular mechanism of LGMD2A, we constructed nine p94 missense point mutants found in LGMD2A and analyzed their p94 unique properties. All mutants completely or almost completely lose the proteolytic activity against a potential substrate, fodrin. However, some of the mutants still possess autolytic activity and/or connectin/titin binding ability, indicating these properties are not necessary for the LGMD2A phenotypes. These results provide strong evidence that LGMD2A results from the loss of proteolysis of substrates by p94, suggesting a novel molecular mechanism leading to muscular dystrophies. p94 (calpain3), a muscle-specific member of the calpain family, has been shown to be responsible for limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A (LGMD2A), a form of autosomal recessive and progressive neuromuscular disorder.

Calpain (EC 3.4.22.17), Ca2+-dependent cysteine protease, is a major intracellular protease thought to regulate the cellular function by hydrolyzing substrates in a highly limited manner (1Suzuki K. Sorimachi H. Yoshizawa T. Kinbara K. Ishiura S. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1995; 376: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Previously identified μ- and m-calpains exist as heterodimers consisting of a unique large catalytic subunit and a common small regulatory subunit. The large subunit can be divided into four structural domains; the second and the fourth domains (domains II and IV) are cysteine protease and Ca2+ binding domains, respectively. The small subunit is composed of an NH2-terminal Gly-rich hydrophobic region (domain V) and a Ca2+ binding domain similar to domain IV of the large subunit (domain IV′ or VI). In addition to these two species, which are ubiquitously expressed in almost all mammalian tissues, several novel species of the calpain large subunit family expressed in a tissue-specific manner have been cloned (2Sorimachi H. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Emori Y. Kawasaki H. Ohno S. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20106-20111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Sorimachi H. Saido T.C. Suzuki K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 343: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Thus, it is now established that calpains, at least in mammals, can be classified into two groups, ubiquitous and tissue-specific species, and that the latter should have tissue-specific functions that cannot be accomplished by the former. p94 (calpain 3 or nCL-1, which stands for novelcalpain large subunit) is a muscle-specific member of the calpain large subunit family (2Sorimachi H.

Contributions of these sequences, especially IS2 which includes a nuclear translocation signal, to p94 specific function are presumed. The recent discovery that the p94 gene is responsible for limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A (LGMD2A) 1The abbreviation used is: LGMD2A, limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A. supports the idea that p94-specific function is indispensable for normal muscular function (5Richard I.

This is consistent with the fact that deficiencies in structural proteins around the sarcolemma are commonly observed in all muscular dystrophies so far identified except LGMD2A (14Campbell K.P. Cell. 1995; 80: 675-679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). To investigate the correlation between p94 function and LGMD2A pathology, we tried to evaluate the effects of p94 mutation in LGMD2A focusing on the following p94-specific features, which suggest its pivotal role in protein turnover and/or in function of muscle. First, although p94 is expressed abundantly at the mRNA level in skeletal muscle, little is detectable as protein because of its very rapid autolysis. Moreover, p94 autolyzes even in the presence of excess EGTA, E-64, leupeptin, or calpastatin, a specific proteinaceous inhibitor of conventional calpain (4Sorimachi H. Toyama-Sorimachi N. Saido T.C. Kawasaki H. Sugita H. Miyasaka M. Arahata K. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10593-10605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This rapid and complete autolysis discriminates p94 from other cysteine proteases including calpains. Second, p94 associates with connectin/titin. Connectin/titin is a gigantic muscle protein in charge of muscle elasticity and structure of myofibrils (15Labeit S. Kolmerer B.

FASEB J. 1997; 11: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we found that p94 binds to the C terminus and the N2A region of connectin/titin (18Sorimachi H. Kinbara K. Kimura S. Takahashi M. Ishiura S. Sasagawa S.

In this study, we report that all the p94 point mutants found in LGMD2A examined so far completely or almost completely lose the fodrin proteolysis activity and that all the mutants show changes in autolytic activity and/or connectin/titin binding activity. These results indicate that the loss of p94 protease activity rather than its autolytic activity underlies the molecular mechanism of LGMD2A. Wild type human p94 cDNA was constructed into pSRD or pAS2–1 (20Ohno S. Akita Y. Konno Y. Imajoh S. Suzuki K.

Polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis using long polymerase chain reaction was employed to create an active site mutation, C129S, and the point mutations found in LGMD2A, L182Q, G234E, P319L, H334Q, V354G, R490W, R572Q, S744G, and R769Q in wild type human p94 cDNA (23Braman J. Papworth C. Greener A. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 57: 31-44PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, sense and antisense primers used to create each amino acid substitution were designed to introduce a diagnostic restriction site at the same time. Each mutant was sequenced to verify the presence of the mutation and the absence of any other alterations. Two clones of human connectin/titin cDNA, pCNT-N2 and pCNT-52, identified as positive for p94 binding in our previous study (18Sorimachi H. Kinbara K. Kimura S. Takahashi M. Ishiura S. Sasagawa S.

COS7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Transfection was performed by electroporation using a Bio-Rad gene pulser as described previously (24Chu G. Hayakawa H. Berg P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 1311-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar) with 5 μg of each expression vector cDNA or the same amount of pSRD vector and 5 × 106 COS7 cells. For the coexpression experiment, 5 × 106 COS7 cells were transfected by the mixture of expression vector for C129S and that for wild type or mutant p94. The following procedures were carried out within 10 min (from the cell scrape to the addition of SDS) at 0–4° C. 60 h after transfection, the cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped in phosphate-buffered saline, collected in an ice-cold 1.5-ml tube within 1 min after the scrape of cells. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 4,000 rpm for 2 min, and disrupted by sonication in buffer A (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol). An equal volume of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 4% (w/v) SDS, 0.4% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol) was added to the cell extracts immediately after disruption. For the incubation assay, one-third volume of 10 mm EDTA or 50 mmCaCl2 was added to cell extracts prepared as above. Incubation was carried out at 37° C, and the reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer. The p94-specific anti-IS2 antiserum was produced using the Lys-rich peptide corresponding to the NH2-terminal Lys-rich sequence of the IS2 region. This antiserum is identical to the anti-K-rich antiserum in our previous report (4Sorimachi H. Toyama-Sorimachi N. Saido T.C. Kawasaki H. Sugita H. Miyasaka M. Arahata K. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10593-10605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The antibody specific for the proteolyzed 150-kDa form of the fodrin α subunit was raised against the 5-mer peptide, GMMPR, corresponding to the NH2-terminal sequence of the calpain-catalyzed proteolytic fragment (25Saido T.C.

Whole cell extracts prepared as described above were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 10 or 6% gels. Sample volumes were normalized according to cell number. Proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon P, Millipore, Japan) as recommended by the supplier and incubated with specific antisera as indicated. The secondary antibody was horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories, Inc., U.S.A.). The antibody complexes were visualized using peroxidase substrate (POD™ immunostaining set, Wako, Japan). Wild type and mutant human p94 in pAS2–1, and pCNT-N2 and pCNT-52 human connectin/titin cDNAs in pACT2 and pGAD10 vectors, respectively, were coexpressed in CG-1945 strain Saccharomyces cerevisiaeas described by the manufacturer (MATCHMAKERTM Two-Hybrid System, CLONTECH, U.S.A.). Binding was assayed as growth on −Leu,Trp,His plates supplemented with 1.5, 5, or 15 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole and by β-galactosidase activity using chlorophenol red-β-d-galactopyranoside as a substrate essentially as described previously (18Sorimachi H. Kinbara K. Kimura S. Takahashi M. Ishiura S. Sasagawa S. Sorimachi N. Shimada H. Tagawa K. Maruyama K. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31158-31162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, various point mutations of p94 have been identified in LGMD2A patients (5Richard I. Broux O. Allamand V. Fougerousse F. Chiannilkulchai N. Bourg N. Brenguier L. Davaud C. Pasturaud P. Roudaut C. Hillaire D. Passos-Bueno M.R. Zatz M. Tischrield J.A. Fardeau M. Jackson C.E. Cohen D. Beckmann J.S.

Disord. 1996; 6: 447-453Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and these are expected to abolish one or two but not all of various p94 characteristics described in the Introduction. To clarify which p94 properties is most related to LGMD2A, we constructed 9 of these missense mutations, L182Q, G234E, P319L, H334Q, and V354G in domain II, R490W and R572Q in domain III, and S744G and R769Q in domain IV by site-directed mutagenesis. One question is whether the association with connectin, a unique property of p94, is affected in LGMD2A. Thus, we examined the binding activity of p94 mutants to the clones, pCNT-N2 and pCNT-52 (18Sorimachi H. Kinbara K. Kimura S. Takahashi M. Ishiura S. Sasagawa S. Sorimachi N. Shimada H. Tagawa K. Maruyama K. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31158-31162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), which correspond to the N2A region and the C terminus of human connectin, respectively, using the yeast two-hybrid system. Wild type and C129S human p94 bound to both pCNT-N2 and pCNT-52, as previously reported (Fig. 2,B and D,12 and 11). As for the mutants, P319L bound to pCNT-52 but not to pCNT-N2 (Fig. 2, B andD, 4), whereas G234E, R572Q, S744G, and R769Q bound only to pCNT-N2 (Fig. 2, B andD, 3 and 8–10). L182Q and V354G bound to neither pCNT-52 nor pCNT-N2 (Fig. 2, B andD, 2 and 6), but H334Q and R490W associated with both pCNT-N2 and pCNT-52 (Fig. 2,B and D, 5 and 7) as in the case of wild type. These results unexpectedly showed that the inability to bind connectin is not necessarily required for LGMD2A. To examine whether LGMD2A arises from the loss of p94 autolytic activity, we used a COS expression system previously described (4Sorimachi H. Toyama-Sorimachi N. Saido T.C. Kawasaki H. Sugita H. Miyasaka M. Arahata K. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10593-10605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this system, wild type p94 is hardly detected as a 94-kDa band because of its rapid autolysis but, instead, as a 55-kDa autolyzed product, whereas an active-site mutated inactive p94, C129S, is clearly detected as a stable 94-kDa translated product (Fig. 3, lanes 2 and 3). Thus, it is concluded that p94 is degraded by itself but not by other endogenous proteases in COS7 cells as we previously reported (4Sorimachi H. Toyama-Sorimachi N. Saido T.C. Kawasaki H. Sugita H. Miyasaka M. Arahata K. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10593-10605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the same system, 94-kDa protein products were also observed for the mutants, L182Q, G234E, P319L, H334Q, V354G, R490W, and R572Q (Fig. 3,lanes 4–10). For R572Q, a faint 55-kDa fragment was detected in addition to the clear 94-kDa band, indicating its residual autolytic activity (Fig. 3, lane 10). Thus, these mutants have lost their rapid autolyzing activity as in the case of C129S. On the other hand, the remaining mutants, S744G and R769Q, were not detected even as degradation fragments (Fig. 3, lanes 11 and12). To confirm the expression of these two mutants, we introduced a second mutation, C129S, into these constructs. The artificial double mutants, S744G/C129S and R769Q/C129S, expressed the 94-kDa product as much as C129S (Fig. 3, lanes 13 and14), indicating that both S744G and R769Q disappeared because of autolysis that is possibly even more rapid than wild type p94. These results showed that the loss of very rapid autolytic activity unique to p94 is not a necessary condition leading to LGMD2A but, at the same time, that none of these mutants possesses the autolytic activity identical to that of wild type p94. It looks strange that R572Q mutant, whose mutation localizes in domain III not in the protease domain, showed severely reduced autolytic activity. To clarify the mechanism of the reduction of activity by mutation of domain III, autolysis profiles of R572Q as well as R490W were examined in detail in comparison with wild type and C129S. As our previous studies showed (4Sorimachi H. Toyama-Sorimachi N. Saido T.C. Kawasaki H. Sugita H. Miyasaka M. Arahata K. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10593-10605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), wild type p94 expressed in COS7 cells continues to degrade autocatalytically in the presence of 10 mm EDTA (Fig. 4 A). That is, the 55-kDa fragment of wild type p94 disappeared depending on time (Fig. 4 A, wild type, lanes 1–4). A similar degradation of the 55-kDa fragment was observed in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 4 B, wild type,lanes 1–4). These results showed apparent Ca2+-independent autolytic activity of wild type p94. On the other hand, the 94-kDa product of C129S does not undergo remarkable degradation in the presence of EDTA or Ca2+ (Figs. 4,A and B, C129S, lanes 1–4), indicating that endogenous proteases can be ignored in this system. In contrast, R490W and R572Q showed Ca2+-dependent degradation (Figs. 4,A and B). Although the velocity of the degradation is different, the 94-kDa product degraded efficiently to the 55-kDa and/or the smaller fragments only in the presence of Ca2+, but not in the presence of EDTA (Fig. 4, Aand B, R490W and R572Q, lanes 1–4). These results suggest that the R490W and R572Q mutations reduce the autolytic activity by lowering their Ca2+sensitivity. In other words, R490W and R572Q mutations possibly affect interaction between domain II and domain IV, resulting in alteration of the Ca2+ sensitivity and the reduction of the autolytic activity. Other mutants, L182Q, G234E, P319L, H334Q, and V354G, which lost rapid autolyzing activity (Fig. 3, lanes 4–8), were examined on the alteration of the Ca2+ sensitivity by the same method. The presence of Ca2+ did not compensate for the loss of rapid autolyzing activity for any of these mutants (data not shown). To further confirm the existence of the proteolytic activity of S744G and R769Q, intermolecular C129S p94 processing activity was examined by coexpression of these mutants with C129S. Wild type p94 has been shown to proteolyze other C129S p94 molecules when coexpressed with C129S in COS7 cells as previously reported (18Sorimachi H. Kinbara K. Kimura S. Takahashi M. Ishiura S. Sasagawa S. Sorimachi N. Shimada H. Tagawa K. Maruyama K. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31158-31162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). When C129S and wild type p94 were coexpressed in COS7 cells and extract of the cells cultured for 60 h were immediately subjected to Western blotting without further incubation, intermolecular cleavage of C129S and production of the 55-kDa proteolyzed fragment were detected by anti-IS2 antiserum (Fig. 5, lane 3). In the same manner, when S744G or R769Q was coexpressed with C129S, similar intermolecular cleavage was observed (Fig. 5,lanes 4 and 5), indicating that these two mutants possess protease activity comparable with that of the wild type. Thus, the absence of the autolytic 55-kDa fragment for S744G and R769Q (Fig. 3, lanes 11 and 12) is interpreted as meaning these mutants autolyze more rapidly than wild type p94, with the degradation fragments disappearing almost completely. Because the NH2 terminus of the 55-kDa fragment was recently determined to be in the IS1 region, 2K. Kinbara, S. Ishiura, S. Tomioka, M. Sorimachi, S. Y. Jeong, S. Amano, H. Kawasaki, B. Kolmerer, S. Kimura, S. Labeit, and K. Suzuki, manuscript in preparation. it is predicted that the mutant P319L in IS1 lost rapid autolytic activity (Fig. 3,lane 6) because of the altered susceptibility of IS1 as a target for autocatalytic cleavage but retains protease activity. Coexpression of C129S with P319L generated the 55-kDa proteolyzed fragment showing intermolecular cleavage of C129S by P319L activity (Fig. 5, lane 6). The mutants, R490W and R572Q, for which residual autolytic activity was demonstrated (Figs. 3 and 4), were also subjected to coexpression with C129S. R490W also has intermolecular C129S processing activity (Fig. 4, lane 7). R572Q generates the 55-kDa fragment when expressed by itself (Fig. 3, lane 10), and thus it was impossible to evaluate its effect on the intermolecular processing activity in this system. In contrast to our expectations, the nine missense mutants examined showed diverged properties concerning autolytic activity and connectin/titin binding ability as discussed below, although none had properties identical to those of the wild type. This is apparently contradictory to the fact that all nine mutations result in a common phenotype. To seek a property that is altered in all nine mutants, we further analyzed the protease activity of p94 against possible substrates. It is well established that fodrin is a good substrate for conventional calpains. When calpain digests the fodrin alpha subunit, the 230-kDa full-length molecule is proteolyzed to 150-kDa (27McMahon A.P. Moon R.T. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1987; 15: 804-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 28Harris A.S. Croall D.E. Morrow J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15754-15761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When wild type p94 is expressed in COS7 cells, the 150-kDa fragment is detected by an antibody to the NH2-terminal sequence of the calpain-catalyzed proteolytic fragment of the fodrin alpha subunit (Fig. 6, lane 2, closed arrowhead), showing significant fodrinolysis in the cytosol (25Saido T.C. Yokota M. Nagao S. Yamaura I. Tani E. Tsuchiya T. Suzuki K. Kawashima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25239-25243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, COS7 cells transfected by C129S or vector only showed no proteolytic fodrin fragment (Fig. 6, lanes 1 and3). These results clearly indicate that in vivofodrinolysis is greatly promoted by the expression of wild type p94, if not by p94 itself. In other words, p94 is involved either directly or indirectly in the proteolysis of fodrin by calpain in cultured cells. The expression of other mutant molecules does not generate the 150-kDa proteolyzed fragment of fodrin as efficiently as that of wild type p94 (Fig. 6, lanes 4–12). Surprisingly, cells transfected by S744G or R769Q, which retains autolytic activity and C129S-hydrolyzing activity comparable with wild type (Fig. 3, lanes 11 and12, Fig. 5, lanes 4 and 5), showed almost undetectable 150-kDa fodrin fragment as shown in Fig. 6,lanes 11 and 12. The result clearly shows that all nine mutants are almost, if not completely, inactive as to fodrinolysis like the active-site mutant, C129S (Fig. 6, lane 3). It is concluded that mutations found in LGMD2A commonly affect the proteolysis by p94. In this study, we examined the properties of p94 point mutants found in LGMD2A (5Richard I. Broux O. Allamand V. Fougerousse F. Chiannilkulchai N. Bourg N. Brenguier L. Davaud C. Pasturaud P. Roudaut C. Hillaire D. Passos-Bueno M.R. Zatz M. Tischrield J.A. Fardeau M. Jackson C.E. Cohen D. Beckmann J.S.

None of the mutants were identical to wild type p94 as summarized in Table I. Namely, all mutants show a deficiency in autolytic activity and/or binding ability to the N2A and/or C-terminal regions of connectin/titin. Based on the fact that only COS7 cells transfected with wild type human p94 produce substantial amounts of the 150-kDa proteolyzed fodrin fragment, proteolysis of p94 substrates, if not fodrin, is certainly altered in all mutants.Table ISummary of the properties of nine p94 mutants found in LGMD2AMutationDomainRapid autolysisCa2+requirementIn vivo C129S proteolysisIn vivo fodrinolysisBinding to connectin/titinN2AC-terminalWild type+—++++C129SII————++L182QII——————G234EII————+—H334QII————++V354GII——————P319LIS1——+——+R490WIII—aResidual autolytic activity is observed.++—++R572QIII—aResidual autolytic activity is observed.+NDbProteolysis of C129S cannot be measured due to endogenous 55-kDa band of R572Q.—+—S744GIV++NDcAutolysis is too rapid to measure Ca2+requirement.+—+—R769QIV++NDcAutolysis is too rapid to measure Ca2+requirement.+—+—a Residual autolytic activity is observed.b Proteolysis of C129S cannot be measured due to endogenous 55-kDa band of R572Q.c Autolysis is too rapid to measure Ca2+requirement. Open table in a new tab The involvement of p94 activity in the proteolysis of fodrin observed in our experiments is either direct or indirect. If p94 cleaves fodrin in the same manner as μ- and m-calpains (25Saido T.C. Yokota M. Nagao S. Yamaura I. Tani E. Tsuchiya T. Suzuki K. Kawashima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25239-25243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the complete or nearly complete loss of this proteolysis observed for all mutants provides direct evidence that insufficient proteolytic reaction mediated by p94 causes LGMD2A. Alternatively, p94 may regulate fodrinolysis indirectly,i.e. proteolysis of unidentified p94 substrates finally results in the activation of endogenous calpain(s), possibly m-calpain in COS7 cells. In this case, the reduction in the amount of final product, the 150-kDa fragment, can be attributed to a defect in the step catalyzed by p94. Either case is consistent with the idea that a loss of proper protease function is a mechanism for the etiology of LGMD2A, which has been proposed from the existence of mutant species lacking the protease domain. Our results provide evidence that unique characteristics of p94 distinct from ordinary calpain are functionary important. Our finding that R490W and R572Q can autolyze efficiently only in the presence of Ca2+ emphasizes that p94 is active without Ca2+or at very low concentrations such as the sub nanomolar level. It is interesting that these mutations in domain III, not IV, altered Ca2+ requirement of p94. Mutagenesis of Asp104adjacent to the active site Cys105 has been reported to cause a 9-fold increase in the Ca2+ requirement (29Arthur J.S. Elce J.S. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 535-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Thus, the Ca2+ requirement of calpain is determined not only by Ca2+ binding domain IV but also by the whole structure including domains I, II, and III. Autolysis of p94 is rapid and exhaustive but under a certain regulation. The fact that S744G and R769Q autolyze even more rapidly than wild type p94, but cannot catalyze in vivo fodrinolysis as efficiently as wild type p94, means that a too rapid autolysis causes functional defect. This is not unrelated to structural changes in the EF-hands of the Ca2+ binding domain. Recently, the crystal structure of domain IV′ (VI) of the calpain small subunit, which is similar to domain IV of the large subunit, has been determined (30Blanchard H. Grochulski P. Li Y. Arthur J.S.C. Davies P.L. Elce J.S. Cygler M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 31Lin G. Chattopadhyay D. Maki M. Wang K.K.W. Carson M. Jin L. Yuen P. Takano E. Hatanaka M. DeLucas L.J. Narayana S.V.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 539-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The result shows the existence of five, rather than four EF-hands previously predicted, and reveals that the extreme C-terminal EF-hand structure is involved in the homodimer formation of domain VI. Ser744 and Arg769 corresponding to Ser189 and Arg214 of the small subunit, respectively, are located at the boundary of the α-helix and Ca2+ binding loop of EF-3 (Ser744) and EF-4 (Arg769). Thus, it is likely that the S744G or R769Q mutations cause changes in the structure and/or Ca2+binding affinity of EF-3 and EF-4, resulting in the hyperactivation of p94. We have shown that p94 does not associate with the small subunit under the conditions where the large subunits of μ- and m-calpain show association with the small subunit (18Sorimachi H. Kinbara K. Kimura S. Takahashi M. Ishiura S. Sasagawa S. Sorimachi N. Shimada H. Tagawa K. Maruyama K. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31158-31162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The above observation suggests that, although p94 shows apparent Ca2+-independent protease activity in vitro, Ca2+ ions play an important role in the regulation of p94 activity, presumably at very low concentrations such as the sub nanomolar level. Further investigation is required as to how the interaction between p94 and connectin/titin is involved in LGMD2A. We have found no common alteration in connectin/titin binding ability among the nine mutants so far examined. Although the result might indicate that connectin/titin binding has nothing to do with LGMD2A, it does not necessarily exclude physiological importance of an association between p94 and connectin/titin. p94 is known to bind to the Z-line of myofibril other than the N2A and the C-terminal regions, although we have not yet identified the binding site at the molecular level (18Sorimachi H. Kinbara K. Kimura S. Takahashi M. Ishiura S. Sasagawa S. Sorimachi N. Shimada H. Tagawa K. Maruyama K. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31158-31162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). It is therefore, possible that mutant p94 cannot bind to the Z-line. Moreover, because the two p94 binding sites of connectin/titin, N2A and C terminus, are produced by alternative splicing, alternative splicing might regulate the interaction between p94 and connectin/titins (32Kinbara K. Sorimachi H. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 342: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar,33Kolmerer B. Olivieri N. Witt C.C. Herrmann B.B. Labeit S. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 556-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). From the viewpoint of molecular mechanism underlying the disease, it is noteworthy that p94, a responsible gene product for LGMD2A, is not a membrane or cytoskeletal component as are the products of the genes responsible for other muscular dystrophies, including LGMD2C–2F. Studies using antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotides showed the involvement of p94 in myofibrillar integrity (34Poussard S. Duvert M. Balcerzak D. Ramassamy S. Brustis J.J. Cottin P. Ducastaing A. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 1461-1469PubMed Google Scholar), and thus defects in p94 might cause high susceptibility of the sarcolemma to stress by disturbing proper myogenesis or myodifferentiation. The present work together with the further characterization of p94 function will provide a clear definition and reveal the molecular mechanism of LGMD2A (35van Ommen G.J. Nat.

A full-length cDNA for this enzyme was cloned from a human brain cDNA library. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that the isolated cDNA codes for a polypeptide of 303 amino acids, tentatively called cathepsin Z, that exhibits structural features characteristic of cysteine proteinases. Fluorescent in situ hybridization experiments revealed that the human cathepsin Z gene maps to chromosome 20q13, a location that differs from all cysteine proteinase genes mapped to date. The cDNA encoding cathepsin Z was expressed inEscherichia coli as a fusion protein with glutathioneS-transferase, and after purification, the recombinant protein was able to degrade the synthetic peptide benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Arg-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin, used as a substrate for cysteine proteinases. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that cathepsin Z is widely expressed in human tissues, suggesting that this enzyme could be involved in the normal intracellular protein degradation taking place in all cell types. Cathepsin Z is also ubiquitously distributed in cancer cell lines and in primary tumors from different sources, suggesting that this enzyme may participate in tumor progression as reported for other cathepsins. Finally, on the basis of a series of distinctive structural features, including diverse peptide insertions and an unusual short propeptide, together with its unique chromosomal location among cysteine proteinases, we propose that cathepsin Z may be the first representative of a novel subfamily of this class of proteolytic enzymes.

The cysteine proteinases belonging to the papain family represent a major component of the lysosomal proteolytic system and play an essential role in protein degradation and turnover (1Bond J.S.

Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1624-1630PubMed Google Scholar). All of them contain an essential cysteine residue in their active site but differ in tissue distribution and in some enzymatic properties, including substrate specificities and pH stability. Furthermore, several groups have reported the existence of additional cysteine proteinases including cathepsins M, N, P, and T, which were originally identified because of their degrading activity on specific substrates such as aldolase, collagen, proinsulin, or tyrosine aminotransferase, but whose characterization at the molecular level has not yet been reported (22Pontremoli S.

According to structural and functional data, it is well established that the different cysteine proteinases of the papain family are synthesized as preproenzymes, which are processed to the corresponding proenzymes and targeted to the lysosomes by the mannose 6-phosphate signal attached to them. The enzymes are further processed to mature forms consisting of either a single polypeptide chain or a two-chain form composed of heavy and light chains linked by a disulfide bond (26Berti P.J. Storer A.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). However, in some cases, the precursors of these lysosomal enzymes escape from this processing pathway and continue along the secretory route, entering storage granules and being finally released into the extracellular space (27Kornfeld S. Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 483-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar). In fact, a series of reports have shown that several lysosomal cysteine proteinases are released by tumor cells from different sources, supporting the concept that secreted lysosomal enzymes may play important roles in the developmnent of malignant processes (28Sloane B.F. Dunn J.R. Honn K.V. Science. 1981; 212: 1151-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 29Recklies A.D. Poole A.R. Mort J.S. Biochem.

Furthermore, lysosomal cysteine proteinases have been found to be secreted by activated macrophages, by osteoclasts, or by fibroblasts from patients with I-cell disease, thereby extending the pattern of physiological and pathological conditions in which these enzymes may be involved (2Chapman H.A. Riese R.J. Shi G.P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 63-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar, 27Kornfeld S. Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 483-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar). Based on the hypothesis that a number of different cysteine proteinases could be responsible for the wide variety of biological functions ascribed to this protein family, we have been interested in examining the possibility that additional yet uncharacterized family members could be produced by human tissues. This search for new human cysteine proteinases led us to identify cathepsin O, originally cloned from a breast carcinoma but widely distributed in human tissues (17Velasco G. Ferrando A.A. Puente X.A. Sánchez L.M. López-Otı́n C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27136-27142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have also described the cloning and characterization of human bleomycin hydrolase, a cytosolic cysteine proteinase distantly related to other members of the papain family and involved in chemotherapy resistance (31Ferrando A.A. Velasco G. Campo E. López-Otı́n C. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1746-1750PubMed Google Scholar, 32Ferrando A.A. Pendás A.M. Llano E. Velasco G. Lidereau R. López-Otı́n C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33298-33304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Finally, we have recently reported the finding of cathepsin L2, a cysteine proteinase structurally related to cathepsin L, but showing a unique tissue distribution (21Santamarı́a I Velasco G. Cazorla M. Fueyo A. Campo E. López-Otı́n C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1624-1630PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we report the identification, chromosomal location, and structural and enzymatic characterization of a novel member of this family of enzymes, which has been tentatively called cathepsin Z. Restriction endonucleases and other reagents used for molecular cloning were from Boehringer Mannheim (Mannheim, Germany). Human brain and prostate cDNA libraries, constructed in λgt11, and Northern blots containing poly(A)+ RNAs prepared from different human tissues and cancer cell lines were purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). Double-stranded DNA probes were radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) from Amersham (Amersham, UK) using a commercial random-priming kit purchased from Pharmacia LKB (Uppsala, Sweden). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by the phosphoramidite method in an Applied Biosystems DNA synthesizer (model 392A) and used directly after synthesis. Synthetic peptides Z-Phe-Arg-AMC, Z-Arg-Arg-AMC, and Z-Arg-AMC were from Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland), and proteinase inhibitor E-64 1The abbreviations used are: E-64,trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase(s); EST, expressed sequence tag; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAC, P1 artificial chromosome; Z-Phe-Arg-AMC, benzyloxycarbonyl-l-phenylalanyl-l-arginine-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin. was from Sigma. A computer search of the GenBankTM data base for sequences with homology to human cysteine proteinases led us to identify a sequence derived from an ovarian tumor cDNA clone (AA283747) 2Deposited by L. Hillier, N. Clark, T. Dubuque, K. Elliston, M. Hawkins, M. Holman, M. Hultman, T. Kucaba, M. Le, G. Lennon, M. Marra, J. Parsons, L. Rifkin, T. Rohlfing, F. Tan, E. Trevaskis, R. Waterston, A. Williamson, P. Wohldmann, and R. Wilson, WashU-Merck EST project. and showing a significant similarity with sequences previously determined for other cathepsins. After looking for additional human expressed sequence tags (ESTs) similar to this one, we found approximately 20 overlapping ESTs, spanning around 1350 bp, and useful to design a specific probe for the gene encoding this putative novel cysteine proteinase. This DNA fragment was obtained by PCR amplification of cDNA from a commercially available human brain cDNA library as follows: total λ-phage DNA from this brain cDNA library was screened for the presence of the hypothetical cysteine proteinase using two specific primers 5′-CACCCGGAACCAGCACAT (primer Z1) and 5′-CGATGGGGTCCCCAATG (primer Z2) derived from the overlapping ESTs. The PCR reaction was performed in a GeneAmp 2400 PCR system from Perkin-Elmer for 35 cycles of denaturation (94 °C, 15 s), annealing (56 °C, 15 s), and extension (72 °C, 1 min). The PCR product, 708 bp long, was phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase and cloned into anEcoRV-cut pBS vector. The cloned cDNA was sequenced and found to be identical with the expected sequence. This cDNA was then excised from the vector, radiolabeled, and used to screen a human brain cDNA library, according to standard procedures (33Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Hybridization to the radiolabeled probe was carried out for 18 h in 6 × SSC (1× = 150 mm NaCl, 15 mmsodium citrate, pH 7.0), 5 × Denhardt's (1× = 0.02% bovine serum albumin, 0.02% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.02% Ficoll), 0.1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml denatured herring sperm DNA at 55 °C. The membranes were washed twice for 1 h at 55 °C in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS and exposed to XAR-5 film (Kodak) at −70 °C with intensifying screens. Following plaque purification, several cloned inserts were excised by EcoRI digestion and the resulting fragments subcloned into the EcoRI site of pUC18. Selected DNA fragments were inserted in the polylinker region of phage vector M13mp19 and sequenced by the Sanger method (34Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52610) Google Scholar), using either M13 universal primer or cDNA specific primers and the Sequenase Version 2.0 kit (U. S. Biochemicals). Sequence ambiguities were solved by substituting dITP for dGTP in the sequencing reactions. All nucleotides were identified in both strands. Computer analysis of DNA and protein sequences was performed with the GCG software package of the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group (35Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11536) Google Scholar). A high density gridded human P1 artificial chromosome (PAC) genomic library (kindly supplied by the Human Genome Mapping Resource Center) was screened by filter hybridization with the full-length cathepsin Z cDNA as probe. Three independent clones were identified enclosing the cathepsin Z gene as demonstrated by PCR and Southern blot analysis. DNA from one of these PAC clones was obtained with the standard alkaline lysis method and then used for fluorescent in situ hybridization mapping. To do that, 2 μg of the PAC DNA was nick translated with biotin-16-dUTP and hybridized to normal male metaphase chromosomes obtained from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated cultured lymphocytes, as described previously (36Pendás A.M. Matilla A. Urı́a J.A. Freije J.P. Fueyo A. Estivill X. López-Otı́n C. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1994; 66: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Biotinylated probe was detected using two avidin-fluorescein layers. Chromosomes were diamidine-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride-banded, and images were captured in a Zeiss axiophot fluorescent microscope equipped with a CCD camera (Photometrics). To prepare an expression vector suitable for production of recombinant cathepsin Z in E. coli, we first generated a 727-bp DNA fragment containing the coding sequence for the mature human cathepsin Z by PCR amplification of the isolated full-length cDNA with primers 5′-ATGCTGCCCAAGAGCTGGGAC and 5′-CGATGGGGTCCCCAAATG. The PCR reaction was carried out for 30 cycles of denaturation (95 °C, 30 s), annealing (56 °C, 30 s), and extension (72 °C, 1 min) using the ExpandTM Long Template PCR System (Boehringer Mannheim) to reduce error frequency. The PCR product was phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase, repared with Klenow fragment, and ligated to the expression vector pGEX-3X (Pharmacia LKB), previously treated withSmaI and alkaline phosphatase. The resulting plasmid, called pGEX-3X CathZ, was transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3), and the transformed cells were grown in LB broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C for about 16 h, diluted 1/100 with the same medium, and grown to an A 600 of 1.0. Then, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the incubation was continued for 3 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in 0.05 volumes of phosphate-buffered saline, lysed by using a French press, and centrifuged at 20,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. The soluble extract was treated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B and eluted with glutathione elution buffer (10 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0) following manufacturer's instructions. The enzymatic activity of purified cathepsin Z produced in E. coli was measured using 20 μm Z-Phe-Arg-AMC, Z-Arg-Arg-AMC, or Z-Arg-AMC as substrates and following the procedure described by Barrett and Kirschke (37Barrett A.J. Kirschke H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 535-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Assays were performed at 30 °C, in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 8 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.05% Brij 35. Substrate hydrolysis was monitored in a Cytofluor 2350 fluorometer (Millipore) at excitation and emission wavelengths of 360 and 460 nm, respectively. For inhibition assays, the reaction mixture was preincubated with 20 μm E-64 at 30 °C for 15 min, and the remaining activity was determined using the fluorogenic substrate Z-Phe-Arg-AMC as above. Northern blots containing 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA of different human tissue specimens and cancer cell lines or 20 μg of total RNA from diverse tumor tissues were prehybridized at 42 °C for 3 h in 50% formamide, 5 × SSPE (1 × = 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmNaH2PO4, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4), 10 × Denhardt's, 2% SDS, and 100 μg/ml denatured herring sperm DNA. After prehybridization, filters were hybridized with the 708-bp radiolabeled probe corresponding to the core region of the cathepsin Z cDNA. After hybridization, filters were washed with 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 2 h at 50 °C and exposed to autoradiography. RNA integrity and equal loading were assessed by hybridization with an actin probe. In an attempt to identify novel members of the papain family of cysteine proteinases, we carried out a computer search of the human EST data base, looking for sequences with similarity to previously described family members. This analysis led to the identification of a series of overlapping ESTs that, after assembly, encoded a protein sequence with a significant degree of similarity to the C-terminal region of the different cysteine proteinases of the papain family characterized to date. A cDNA containing part of the nucleotide sequence corresponding to these assembled ESTs was obtained by PCR amplification of total λ-phage DNA prepared from a commercially available human brain cDNA library. The amplified DNA fragment (708 bp) was cloned, and its identity was confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis. The cloned fragment was then radiolabeled and used as a probe to hybridize the same human brain cDNA library utilized for the previous PCR amplification experiment. Upon screening of approximately 1 × 106 plaque-forming units, a total of four independent clones showing positive hybridization with the probe were identified. Then, DNA was isolated from each of these positive clones, and their nucleotide sequence was determined by standard procedures. Analysis of the resulting sequences revealed that all of them seemed to derive from the same gene, which would encode a putative novel human cathepsin. However, none of these isolated cDNA clones contained in their nucleotide sequence the coding information corresponding to the N-terminal region of this novel human enzyme. To obtain this sequence, we screened a human prostate cDNA library using as a probe a 85-bp DNA fragment, prepared by PCR amplification and corresponding to the most 5′-region present in the isolated brain cDNA clones. Upon screening of approximately 1 × 106 plaque-forming units, DNA was isolated from a single clone showing positive hybridization with the 85-bp probe, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. Sequence analysis of this positive clone allowed us to extend by approximately 300 bp the 5′-sequence determined for the brain cDNA clones as well as to confirm the remaining part of the nucleotide sequence derived from these clones. Computer analysis of the 5′-extended sequence revealed an open reading frame 909 bp long, starting with an ATG codon at position 241 and ending with a TAA codon at position 1150 (Fig. 1). Assuming that translation starts at this first ATG, the identified open reading frame codes for a protein of 303 amino acids and a predicted molecular weight of 33,881. Pairwise comparisons for sequence similarities between the identified amino acid sequence and those determined for the different human cysteine proteinases of the papain family characterized to date showed that the percentage of identities ranged from 34% with cathepsin C to 26% with cathepsin B. Despite this overall limited sequence identity, the deduced amino acid sequence from the human cDNA isolated in this work shows all the structural features characteristic of the different members of the papain family (Fig. 2). Thus, the presence of a N-terminal sequence rich in hydrophobic residues suggests the presence of the signal peptide which targets these enzymes to the secretory pathway (1Bond J.S. Butler P.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 333-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar,2Chapman H.A. Riese R.J. Shi G.P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 63-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar, 26Berti P.J. Storer A.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this 20-residue hydrophobic peptide ends in a sequence Ala-Gly-Ala that matches perfectly the Ala-X-Ala motif found at the processing site of eukaryotic preproteins (38von Hejne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1532) Google Scholar). Assuming that the signal peptidase cleaves after this consensus sequence, the resulting protein would be composed of 283 amino acid residues. The multiple alignment of this sequence with those determined for human cysteine proteinases belonging to the papain family also allows us to identify a proregion and a mature proteinase sequence as well as to define the putative cleavage site between both protein domains. In fact, as shown in Fig. 2, the N-terminal of most mature cysteine proteinases can be precisely aligned, the second amino acid being proline in all cases. By analogy with them, the active processed form of the putative novel cysteine proteinase would start at the leucine residue located at position 62, with a predicted molecular weight of 27,280. On the other hand, the amino acid sequence alignment shown in Fig. 2 also allows us to identify the putative active site Cys residue (at position 92) of the novel protein sequence as well as other residues important for the catalytic properties of cysteine proteinases, including the His-241 and Asn-261 residues, which would complete the catalytic triad of these enzymes (26Berti P.J. Storer A.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). A more detailed analysis of the amino acid sequences surrounding these three essential residues revealed a high degree of similarity between the novel sequence and that of the remaining cysteine proteinases. Thus, the N-terminal region contains the conserved tryptophan residue and hydrophobic segment immediately adjacent to the cysteine active site as well as the glutamine residue (at position 87) of the putative oxyanion hole characteristic of the structure of these proteolytic enzymes (39Kamphuis I.G. Drenth J. Baker E.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 182: 317-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 40Musil D. Zucic D. Turk D. Engh R.A. Mayr I. Huber R. Popovic T. Turk V. Towatari T. Katunuma N.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5492-5503Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the C-terminal region contains a series of conserved aromatic residues and the tripeptide Asn-Ser-Trp located in the active site. The predicted protein sequence also contains two potential sites of N-glycosylation located in the mature region (Asn-Tyr-Thr at positions 184 and 224). Because all mammalian cysteine proteinases characterized to date are glycosylated, it is presumed that at least one of these residues has attached the mannose 6-phosphate marker required for lysosomal targeting. Taking together all structural characteristics, we can conclude that the isolated cDNA codes for a novel human cysteine proteinase of the papain family that we propose to call cathepsin Z, because to our knowledge this name is not still used to define any other member of the family. To establish the chromosomal localization of the human cathepsin Z gene, we first isolated PAC clones containing this gene by screening a genomic library with the full-length cDNA as probe. DNA from one of the isolated clones was then employed in fluorescent in situhybridization experiments using human male chromosome metaphases. After diamidine-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride banding of the metaphase cells with specific hybridization signals (more than 90% of the cells), fluorescent yellow signals corresponding to the biotinylated PAC clone were clearly mapped to the telomeric region of chromosome 20, in the q13 region (Fig. 3). As can be also seen in Fig. 3, no other chromosome site was labeled above background. A number of genes have been already mapped to this region, including those encoding adenosine deaminase, prostacyclin synthase, or phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (42Honig J. Martiniuk F.

Genomics. 1993; 15: 219-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, no cysteine proteinase genes of any of the different subfamilies have been previously found to map at this chromosome site. To elucidate whether the isolated cathepsin Z cDNA codes for a functional cysteine proteinase, we expressed the cloned cDNA in a bacterial system following the strategy described for other cysteine proteinases (45Petanceska S. Devi L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26038-26043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To do that, we first prepared by PCR amplification a 727-bp fragment containing the entire coding sequence for the predicted mature cathepsin Z. After confirming the nucleotide sequence of the amplified fragment, it was inserted in the polylinker region of the expression vector pGEX-3X. The resulting plasmid, called pGEX-3X CathZ, as well as the original vector, were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3), and the transformed bacteria were induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. SDS-PAGE analysis of protein extracts prepared from the induced bacteria revealed that the bacteria transformed with the recombinant plasmid contained a fusion protein of about 52 kDa, which was not present in the control extracts (Fig. 4 A). By contrast, a 29-kDa band corresponding to the parental glutathioneS-transferase was detected in the control extracts but not in those prepared from the recombinant bacteria (Fig. 4 A). To purify the recombinant cathepsin Z, we performed an affinity chromatography in a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column, which was eluted with a reduced glutathione-containing buffer. After elution and SDS-PAGE analysis of the protein material present in the chromatographic eluate, a single band of the expected size was detected (Fig. 4 A). To examine the enzymatic activity of the affinity-purified cathepsin Z, we investigate"

We show here that BAG-1 also interacts with retinoic acid receptor (RAR). Gel retardation assays demonstrated that in vitro translated BAG-1 protein could effectively inhibit the binding of RAR but not retinoid X receptor (RXR) to a number of retinoic acid (RA) response elements (RAREs). A glutathioneS-transferase-BAG-1 fusion protein also specifically bound RAR but not RXR. Interaction of BAG-1 and RAR could also be demonstrated by yeast two-hybrid assays. In transient transfection assays, co-transfection of BAG-1 expression plasmid inhibited the transactivation activity of RAR/RXR heterodimers but not RXR/RXR homodimers. When stably expressed in breast cancer cell lines, BAG-1 inhibited binding of RAR/RXR heterodimer to a number of RAREs and suppressed RA-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis. In addition, RA-induced suppression of Bcl-2 expression was abrogated by overexpression of BAG-1. These results demonstrate that BAG-1 can regulate retinoid activities through its interaction with RAR and suggest that elevated levels of BAG-1 protein could potentially contribute to retinoid resistance in cancer cells.

Development of a multicellular organism requires tightly regulated cellular processes, such as proliferation, differentiation, and cell death. Failure to maintain the balance among these fundamental and mechanistically related processes may result in abnormal cell growth, as seen in cancer cells where cell death is often inhibited (1White E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar, 2Reed J.C. J. Cell. Biol. 1994; 124: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2390) Google Scholar). Retinoids, a group of natural and synthetic vitamin A derivatives, are currently used to treat epithelial cancer and promyelocytic leukemia and are being evaluated for prevention and therapy of other human cancers (3Gudas L.J. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids. Raven Press, New York1994: 443-520Google Scholar, 4Hong W.K. Itri L.M. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 597-630Google Scholar). The anti-cancer effects of retinoids are mainly due to their inhibition of cell proliferation, induction of cell differentiation, and promotion of apoptosis. Retinoids alone or in combination with other stimuli induce apoptosis during normal development and in different types of cancer cells in vitro(5Liu Y. Lee M.-O. Wang H.-G. Li Y. Hashimoto Y.

The effects of retinoids are mainly mediated by two classes of nuclear receptors, the retinoic acid receptors (RARs) 1The abbreviations used are: RAR, retinoic acid receptor; RXR, retinoid X receptor; RARE, retinoic acid response elements; TR, thyroid hormone receptor; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; tk, thymidine kinase; MHC, myosin heavy chain; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyl- transferase. and retinoid X receptors (RXRs). RARs and RXRs are encoded by three distinct genes (α, β, and γ) and are members of the steroid/thyroid/retinoid hormone receptor superfamily that function as ligand-activated transcription factors (12Zhang X.-k. Pfahl M. TEM. 1993; 4: 156-162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 13Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P.

Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2837) Google Scholar). 9-cis RA is a high affinity ligand for both RARs and RXRs, whereas all-trans-RA (trans-RA) is a ligand for only RARs. RARs and RXRs primarily function as RXR/RAR heterodimers that bind to a variety of RA response elements (RAREs) and regulate their transactivation activities. Regulation of gene expression either positively or negatively by nuclear hormone receptors is modulated by additional factors. Some of them appear to provide a direct link to the core transcriptional machinery and to modulate chromatin structure (15Horwitz K.B. Jackson T.A. Bain D.L. Richer J.K. Takimoto G.S. Tung L. Mol.

Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). The involvement of retinoid receptors in retinoid-induced apoptosis has been demonstrated in several studies. Expression of RARβ may be involved in the apoptosis of mesenchyme of the interdigital regions during mouse limb development (28Kochhar D.M. Jiang H. Harnish D.C. Soprano D.R. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1993; 383: 815-825Google Scholar). RARβ is required for RA-induced apoptosis of breast cancer (5Liu Y. Lee M.-O. Wang H.-G. Li Y. Hashimoto Y. Klaus M. Reed J.C. Zhang X.-k. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1138-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) and lung cancer (7Li Y. Dawson M.I. Agadir A. Lee M.-O. Jong L. Hobbs P.D. Zhang X.-k. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 75: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) cells, whereas activation of RXR is essential for RA-induced HL-60 cell apoptosis (29Nagy L. Thomazy V.A. Shipley G.L. Fesus L. Lamph W. Heyman R.A. Chandraratna R.A. Davies P.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 3540-3551Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In 4-HPR-induced apoptosis, activation of RARγ may be involved (30Fanjul A.N. Delia D. Pierotti M.A. Rideout D. Qiu J. Pfahl M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22441-22446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 31Fanjul A.N. Bouterfa H. Dawson M. Pfahl M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1571-1577PubMed Google Scholar), whereas regulation of activation-induced apoptosis of T-cells by 9-cis RA requires activation of both RARs and RXRs (32Yang Y. Minucci S. Ozato K. Heyman R.A. Ashwell J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18672-18677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Although much interest has been directed to the role of retinoid-induced apoptosis in both physiological and pathological processes, very little is known regarding regulation of the process. It is believed that apoptosis, once triggered, proceeds through a central death pathway in which specific cellular proteases and endonucleases are activated (1White E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar, 2Reed J.C. J. Cell. Biol. 1994; 124: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2390) Google Scholar, 33Steller H. Science. 1995; 267: 1445-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (2432) Google Scholar). Members of the Bcl-2 family play an important role in the regulation of the central death pathway. Bcl-2 can suppress induction of apoptosis in many systems, whereas Bax promotes apoptosis. In addition, several other proteins that modulate Bcl-2 activity by interacting with Bcl-2 have been described (1White E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar, 2Reed J.C. J. Cell. Biol. 1994; 124: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2390) Google Scholar, 33Steller H. Science. 1995; 267: 1445-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (2432) Google Scholar). One of these genes, BAG-1 (for Bcl-2-associatedanti-death gene 1), was cloned from a murine embryo cDNA library using a protein-protein interaction technique (34Takayama S. Sato T. Krajewski S. Kochel K. Irie S. Millan J.A. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 279-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Two differently localized BAG-1 isoforms, the long BAG-1 isoform and the short BAG-1 isoform, generated by alternative translation initiation are expressed in mammalian cells (35Packham G. Brimmell M. Cleveland J.L. Biochem J. 1997; 328: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Whether two isoforms act differently remains to be determined. Recent studies demonstrated that co-expression of BAG-1 and Bcl-2 in Jurkat lymphoid cells, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, and melanoma cells promoted the survival of these cells in response to a variety of apoptotic stimuli (34Takayama S. Sato T. Krajewski S. Kochel K. Irie S. Millan J.A. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 279-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 36Clevenger C.V. Thickman K. Ngo W. Chang W.-P.

Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2971-2977Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In addition to Bcl-2, BAG-1 also interacts with Raf-1 (38Wang H.-G. Takayama S. Rapp U.R. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7063-7068Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), resulting in activation of its kinase activity. Furthermore, BAG-1 can interact with hepatocyte growth factor receptor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor and enhance the ability of these receptors to transduce signals for cell survival (39Bardelli A. Longati P. Albero D. Goruppi S. Schneider C. Ponzetto C. Comoglio P.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6205-6212Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that BAG-1 may function as an adaptor to mediate the interaction between survival factors and apoptotic machinery and may also play a role in regulating cellular proliferation. The recent observation that BAG-1 binds tightly to Hsp70/Hsc70-family proteins and modulates their chaperone activity (40Hohfeld J. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6209-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 41Takayama S. Bimston D.N. Matsuzawa S. Freeman B.C. Aime-Sempe C. Xie Z. Morimoto R.I. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4887-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 42Zeiner M. Gebauer M. Gehring U. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5483-5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) suggests that the ability of BAG-1 to alter the activities of diverse groups of proteins involved in cell growth control may be attributed to its effects on Hsp70/Hsc70 proteins. Interestingly, the human BAG-1 homolog (also known as RAP46) was cloned from a human liver cDNA library by virtue of its interaction with the glucocorticoid receptor (43Zeiner M. Gehring U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11456-11469Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In vitro, RAP46 interacts with a number of nuclear hormone receptors, including estrogen receptor and thyroid hormone receptor (TR) (43Zeiner M. Gehring U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11456-11469Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Since molecular chaperones are known to play an important role in controlling the activity of many members of the steroid/thyroid/retinoid receptor family (44Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1539) Google Scholar), it is possible that BAG-1 could alter the function of these transcriptional regulators. Before this report, however, it was unknown whether BAG-1 regulates the activities of the nuclear hormone receptors and whether BAG-1 interacts with retinoid receptors. Here we demonstrate that short BAG-1 isoform interacts with the RAR but not the RXR both in vitro and in vivo. GST pull-down and the yeast two-hybrid assays show that BAG-1 directly interacts with RAR but not RXR. Moreover, BAG-1 inhibits RAR/RXR heterodimer DNA binding and suppresses RA-induced transactivation activity of RARs on various RAREs. Overexpression of BAG-1 in MCF-7 and ZR-75-1 breast cancer cells reduces the ability of trans-RA to inhibit the growth and induce apoptosis, as well as its modulation of Bcl-2 expression. Taken together, our results demonstrate that BAG-1 can physically interact with RARs and is an important component in the retinoid response pathway. Our findings suggest that this protein-protein interaction may play a role in the regulation of retinoid-induced growth inhibition and apoptotic processes, potentially contributing to retinoid resistance in cancer. Monkey kidney CV-1 cells and breast cancer MCF-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, and ZR-75-1 breast cancer cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were seeded at 1,000–2,000 cells/well in 96-well plates and treated 24 h later with various concentrations of trans-RA for 7 days. Media andtrans-RA were changed every 48 h. Relative viable cell number was determined using the MTT assay (52Wu Q. Li Y. Liu R. Agadir A. Lee M.-O. Liu Y. Zhang X.-k. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1656-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). For the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase assay (5Liu Y. Lee M.-O. Wang H.-G. Li Y. Hashimoto Y. Klaus M. Reed J.C. Zhang X.-k. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1138-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), cells were treated with or without 10−6m trans-RA. After 48 h, cells were trypsinized, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 1% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 70% ice-cold ethanol, and stored at −20 °C overnight. Cells were then labeled with biotin-16-dUTP by terminal transferase and stained with avidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Boehringer Mannheim). Fluorescently labeled cells were analyzed using a FACScater-Plus. Representative histograms are shown. Cells were lysed in 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH7.4, 5 mmEDTA, 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, leupeptins, and pepstatin. Equal amounts of lysates (50 μg) were boiled in SDS sample buffer, resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. After transfer, the membranes were blocked in TBST (50 mm Tris, pH7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) containing rabbit anti-Bcl-2 serum. The membranes were then washed three times with TBST and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature in TBST containing horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit immunoglobulin. After three washes in TBST, immunoreactive products were detected by chemiluminescence with an enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For CV-1 cells, 1 × 105 cells were plated per well in a 24-well plates 16–24 h before transfection as described previously (45Zhang X.-k. Hoffmann B. Tran P.B. Graupner G. Pfahl M. Nature. 1992; 355: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). For ZR-75-1 cells, 5 × 105 cells/well were seeded in 6-well culture plates. A modified calcium phosphate precipitation procedure was used for transient transfection (45Zhang X.-k. Hoffmann B. Tran P.B. Graupner G. Pfahl M. Nature. 1992; 355: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). For CV-1 cells, 100 ng of reporter plasmid, 150 ng of β-galactosidase expression vector (pCH 110, Amersham), and various amounts of BAG-1 expression vector that expresses short BAG-1 isoform (35Packham G. Brimmell M. Cleveland J.L. Biochem J. 1997; 328: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) were mixed with carrier DNA (pBluescript) to 1,000 ng of total DNA/well. Reporter plasmids βRARE-tk-CAT, TREpal-tk-CAT, and TREMHC-tk-CAT have been previously described (45Zhang X.-k. Hoffmann B. Tran P.B. Graupner G. Pfahl M.

Cell. 1995; 80: 279-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar) that expresses short BAG-1 isoform was stably transfected into MCF-7 or ZR-75-1 cells using calcium phosphate precipitation method, followed by selection using G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described (5Liu Y. Lee M.-O. Wang H.-G. Li Y. Hashimoto Y. Klaus M. Reed J.C. Zhang X.-k. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1138-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). cDNAs for RARα, RXRα, estrogen receptor, and BAG-1, which expresses short BAG-1 isoform cloned into pBluescript (Stratagene), were transcribed by using T7 or T3 RNA polymerase, and the transcripts were translated in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) as described previously (45Zhang X.-k. Hoffmann B. Tran P.B. Graupner G. Pfahl M. Nature. 1992; 355: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). The relative amounts of the translated proteins were determined by separating the [35S]methionine-labeled proteins on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, quantitating the amount of incorporated radioactivity and normalizing it relative to the content of methionine residues in each protein. To synthesize receptor fusion protein, RARγ or RXRα cDNAs were cloned in-frame into the bacterial expression vector pGex.2T (Amersham) as described (45Zhang X.-k. Hoffmann B. Tran P.B. Graupner G. Pfahl M. Nature. 1992; 355: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Preparation and purification of GST-BAG-1 and GST-BAG-1(Δ172–218) fusion proteins has been described (41Takayama S.

Preparation of nuclear extract was described previously (6Wu Q. Dawson M.I. Zheng Y. Hobbs P.D. Agadir A. Jong L. Li Y. Liu R. Lin B. Zhang X.-k. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6598-6608Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Analysis of in vitrosynthesized or bacterially expressed receptor proteins or nuclear proteins by gel retardation was described previously (45Zhang X.-k. Hoffmann B. Tran P.B. Graupner G. Pfahl M. Nature. 1992; 355: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). To analyze the effect of BAG-1 protein, in vitro synthesized BAG-1 protein was preincubated with receptor protein at room temperature for 10 min before the gel retardation assay. The oligonucleotides used for gel retardation assays were βRARE (TGTAGGGTTCACCGAAAGTTCAGTC) (46Hoffmann B. Lehmann J.M. Zhang X.-k. Hermann T. Graupner G. Pfahl M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1734-1743Crossref Scopus (197) Google Scholar); TREpal (TGAGGTCATGACCTGA) (45Zhang X.-k. Hoffmann B. Tran P.B. Graupner G. Pfahl M. Nature. 1992; 355: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar); DR-5-RARE(TGTAGGGTTCACACTGAGTTCACTCA); and DR-2-RARE(AGGTCAAAAGGTCAG). To analyze the interaction between BAG-1 and RAR, GST-BAG-1 fusion protein was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads as described (52Wu Q. Li Y. Liu R. Agadir A. Lee M.-O. Liu Y. Zhang X.-k. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1656-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). As a control, GST prepared under the same conditions was also immobilized. The beads were preincubated with bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml) at room temperature for 5 min. 35S-Labeled in vitro synthesized receptor proteins (2 to 5 μl, depending on translation efficiency) Bcl-2 or Hsc70 were then added to the beads. The beads were then continuously rocked for 1 h at 4 °C in a final volume of 200 μl in EBC buffer (140 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaF, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, and 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0). After washing five times with NETN buffer (100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mmTris, pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40), the bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. For the yeast two-hybrid assay, the yeast two-hybrid system from CLONTECH Inc. (Palo Alto, CA) was used (52Wu Q. Li Y. Liu R. Agadir A. Lee M.-O. Liu Y. Zhang X.-k. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1656-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). BAG-1 cDNA was cloned into the yeast expression vector pGAD424 to generate an in-frame fusion with the Gal4 activation domain. RARγ or RXRα cDNAs were cloned into pGBT11 or pGBT9, respectively, to produce an in-frame fusion with Gal4 DNA binding domain. RARγ was also cloned into pGAD426 that contains Gal4 activation domain to study the interaction between RARγ and RXRα. The yeast reporter strain Y190 containing a LacZ reporter plasmid with Gal4 binding sites was used for transformation. β-Galactosidase activity was determined following the conditions provided by the manufacturer. We investigated whether BAG-1 could interact with retinoid receptors by studying the effect of BAG-1 protein on binding of retinoid receptors to their target DNA sequences. In vitro synthesized RAR and RXR formed a strong RAR/RXR heterodimer complex with the TREpal as described previously (45Zhang X.-k. Hoffmann B. Tran P.B. Graupner G. Pfahl M. Nature. 1992; 355: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). When increasing amounts of in vitro synthesized short BAG-1 isoform protein were incubated with RAR and RXR, the binding of RAR/RXR heterodimers was inhibited in a BAG-1 concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1 a). At a 5 mexcess of BAG-1 protein relative to RAR/RXR, the binding was almost completely inhibited. The effect of BAG-1 on RAR/RXR binding was specific because similar amounts of estrogen receptor did not show any effect. BAG-1 also effectively inhibited the binding of TR/RXR to the TREpal probe (Fig. 1 b), consistent with a prior report that BAG-1 can interact with TR (43Zeiner M. Gehring U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11456-11469Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). To study whether the inhibitory effect of BAG-1 on RAR/RXR heterodimer binding is specific to the TREpal, we used another RA responsive element (βRARE), which is derived from the RARβ promoter (46Hoffmann B. Lehmann J.M. Zhang X.-k. Hermann T. Graupner G. Pfahl M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1734-1743Crossref Scopus (197) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 c, binding of RAR/RXR on the βRARE was also inhibited by the addition of BAG-1 protein. Similar results were obtained with other RAREs, including CRBPI-RARE and ApoAI-RARE (data not shown). Thus, inhibition of RAR/RXR binding to their target DNA sequences by BAG-1 is independent of RAREs. We next determined whether inhibition of RAR/RXR heterodimer binding by BAG-1 is due to interaction of BAG-1 with RAR or RXR. Since in vitro synthesized RAR or RXR alone does not bind efficiently to RARE, we used bacterially expressed RAR or RXR protein. When a 5-fold molar excess of BAG-1 protein was added, the binding of RARγ was significantly inhibited, whereas binding of RXRα was not affected (Fig. 1 d). These results suggest that inhibition of RAR/RXR or TR/RXR heterodimer DNA binding by BAG-1 is likely due to its interaction with RAR or TR but not with RXR. To further study the interaction between BAG-1 and RAR, we used an in vitroGST pull-down assay. A GST-BAG-1 fusion protein was expressed in bacteria and immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads. The beads were then incubated with in vitro synthesized35S-labeled RAR or RXR protein. After extensive washing, the mixtures were analyzed on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel. In comparison to the input lane, significant amounts of labeled RAR but not RXR were retained by GST-BAG-1-Sepharose beads but not by GST control beads (Fig. 2). For control, Bcl-2, a known BAG-1 interacting protein (34Takayama S. Sato T. Krajewski S. Kochel K. Irie S. Millan J.A. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 279-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar), bound strongly to GST-BAG-1 beads. We also employed a BAG-1 mutant protein in which the last 47 amino acid residues are deleted from its C-terminal end (41Takayama S. Bimston D.N. Matsuzawa S. Freeman B.C. Aime-Sempe C. Xie Z. Morimoto R.I. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4887-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). This mutant protein (BAG-1/Δc) can interact with Bcl-2 but not with Hsc70. Interestingly, labeled RAR but not RXR was also retained by the mutant BAG-1, thus implying that the interaction of BAG-1 with RAR is independent of its binding to Hsc70. Interaction between RAR and BAG-1 was also evaluated by the two-hybrid assay in yeast. Fig. 3 shows that co-transformation of BAG-1 and RARγ significantly activated the reporter in β-gal filter assay, whereas co-transformation of BAG-1 and RXRα did not. Interaction between BAG-1 and RARγ was specific because co-transformation of either BAG-1 or RARγ with the corresponding empty vector did not activate the reporter gene. Thus, RAR and BAG-1 also interact in intact cells. To further examine the BAG-1-RAR interaction, we studied the effects of the short BAG-1 isoform on RAR transactivation activity on a number of RAREs by transient transfection assay. When CV-1 cells were transiently transfected with RARα expression vector together with either TREpal-tk-CAT (Fig. 4 a) or βRARE-tk-CAT (Fig. 4 b), trans-RA-induced reporter gene activity was markedly inhibited by co-transfection of BAG-1 expression plasmid in a concentration-dependent manner. The effect is specific to BAG-1 because co-transfection of similar amounts of empty expression vector (p"

Two types of internalization signal have been described: one requiring a tyrosine as the critical residue (tyrosine-based motif), and the other consisting of either two consecutive leucines or an isoleucine and leucine (dileucine motif). Although it seems that these signals are necessary and sufficient for endocytic targeting, the mechanism of recognition is not well understood. To examine this question, tetracycline-repressible cell lines were used to overexpress one of several receptors bearing a tyrosine-based internalization signal. By measuring the rates of endocytosis for either the overexpressed receptor, or that of other endogenous receptors, we were able to show that the endocytosis of identical receptors could be saturated, but a complete lack of competition exists between the transferrin receptor (TfR), the low-density lipoprotein receptor, and the epidermal growth factor receptor. Overexpression of any one of these receptors resulted in its redistribution toward the cell surface, implying that entry into coated pits is limited. During high levels of TfR expression, however, a significant increase in the amount of surface Lamp1, but not low-density lipoprotein receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor, or Lamp2, is detected. This suggests that Lamp1 and TfR compete for the same endocytic sites. Together, these results support the idea that there are at least three distinct saturable components involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis.

Together, these results support the idea that there are at least three distinct saturable components involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Cells selectively internalize specific surface receptors and their ligands through receptor-mediated endocytosis. This process begins when receptors, targeted for endocytosis, are selectively sequestered into specialized structures on the plasma membrane, termed clathrin-coated pits. These sites of rapid endocytosis are responsible for the internalization of a large variety of surface receptors and proteins. The endocytic machinery is able to recognize receptors destined for internalization through short stretches of amino acids in their cytoplasmic domains containing specific targeting information (for reviews, see Refs. 1Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar, 2Marks M.S. Ohno H. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S.

Probably the most thoroughly examined of these is the tyrosine-based motif, which consists of a sequence of 4–6 amino acids, specifically containing a tyrosine that is crucial for proper endocytic targeting (4Chen W.J.

This tyrosine, which usually resides in a YXX∅ or NPXY motif (where X is any amino acid and ∅ is a hydrophobic residue), has been shown to capable of forming a tight turn in secondary structure (10Collawn J.F.

Some receptors, like the EGFR 1The abbreviations used are: EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; Tf, transferrin; TfR, transferrin receptor; fTfR, Flag epitope-tagged transferrin receptor; LDLR, low density lipoprotein receptor; Lamp, lysosomal-associated membrane protein; AP2, clathrin adaptor protein-2. and insulin-R, require ligand binding before they are concentrated into clathrin-coated pits and internalized. Other receptors, including the transferrin receptor, LDLR, and asialoglycoprotein receptor, are constitutively recycled, and spend a majority of their cell surface time clustered in coated pits (reviewed in Refs. 14Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Anderson R.G.W. Russell D.W. Schneider W.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1985; 1: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar). In both cases, sorting signals have been suggested to mediate interactions between the receptor and AP2 complexes present in the coated pit (15Marks M.S. Woodruff L. Ohno H. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 341-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). These AP2 associations, which have been shown in vitro for a number of different receptors (16Chang M.P. Mallet W. Simonetti D.W. Brodsky F.M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 186aCrossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 17Pearse B.M.F. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2457-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 18Pearse B.M.F.

Science. 1995; 269: 1872-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar), would serve either to trap receptors in clathrin-coated pits, or ensure that they are present at the location where new clathrin-coated pit structures are being assembled. In previous work (20Warren R.A. Green F.A. Enns C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2116-2121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), we have shown that overexpression of a Flag epitope-tagged version of the constitutively endocytosing TfR (fTfR), can lead to saturation of endocytosis for the TfR, but does not affect the rate of internalization of the triggered EGFR. This result supports in part, work by Wiley in 1988 (21Wiley H.S. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), and suggests that these two receptors are being internalized by different mechanisms. To examine this further, we have developed two new tetracycline-repressible cell lines that can overexpress the LDLR or the EGFR. In this report, we show that both EGFR and LDLR can be expressed at sufficient levels to saturate their own endocytic mechanism, but do not alter the rate of internalization of each other or the transferrin receptor. When TfR is overexpressed, however, a significant and repeatable accumulation of Lamp1 on the plasma membrane is detected, with no change in the amount of surface Lamp2. We suggest that multiple distinct saturable components exist for clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The plasmids LDLR/pTZ1 and EGFR/pBS were kind gifts from David Russell at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, and Steven H. Wiley at the University of Utah School of Medicine, respectively. The pAlter− plasmid was purchased from Promega. Using Promega's Altered Sitesin vitro Mutagenesis System, the parent plasmid, pAlter−, was mutagenized with the oligonucleotide, PAXbaI (5′-agtattctagagtgtcacc-3′), which adds a second XbaI site to the end of the multiple cloning region, and the oligonucleotide AmpRep (5′-gttgccattgctgcaggcatcgtggtg-3′), which repairs the damaged ampicillin-resistance gene, which is in turn used for selection. The resulting plasmid, pAlterXX, was used as an intermediate vector for cloning receptor DNAs into the pUHD10-3 vector (22Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4256) Google Scholar). To create the LDLR/pUHD10–3 construct, theHindIII-HindIII fragment from LDLR/pTZ1 was cloned into the HindIII site of pAlterXX. The resulting LDLR/pAlterXX was then used to isolate theXbaI-XbaI fragment containing the LDLR sequence, and subsequently cloned into the XbaI site of pUHD10-3. The EGFR/pUHD10-3 construct was made by first cloning theXbaI-SalI fragment from EGFR/pBS into pAlter− and then mutating the EGFR/pAlter− plasmid with oligonucleotides PAXbaI and AmpRep as described above. This EGFR/pAlterXX plasmid was used to isolate a XbaI-XbaI fragment containing the EGFR sequence, which was then cloned into theXbaI site of pUHD10-3. All mutageneses were confirmed by sequencing. The tetracycline-repressible LDLR21 and EGFR8 cell lines were created using protocols described previously (20Warren R.A. Green F.A. Enns C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2116-2121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 μg of plasmid containing the tetracycline-responsive promoter region and sequence for either the LDLR (LDLR/pUHD10–3) or EGFR (EGFR/pUHD10–3) were co-transfected into HeLa cells expressing the tTA fusion protein with 500 ng of plasmid conferring puromycin resistance (pBSPac). Transfected cells were selected in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 400 μg/ml G418 (Calbiochem), and 400 ng/ml puromycin (Sigma). Stable colonies were screened for highest receptor expression in the absence of tetracycline by Western blotting. The monoclonal mouse αLDLR (C7) antibody was obtained from ascites from the C7 cell line available through ATCC. The purified monoclonal mouse αEGFR (538) antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The monoclonal mouse αLamp1 (H4A3) and mouse αLamp2 (H4B4) antibodies, developed by Dr. J. Thomas August and Dr. James E. K. Hildreth, were obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank maintained by The University of Iowa, Department of Biological Sciences, Iowa City, IA, under contract NO1-HD-7-3263 from the NICHD. Non-reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting were performed as described previously (23Williams A.M. Enns C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17648-17654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Markers used on gels were purchased from Sigma, and included myosin heavy chain (205 kDa), β-galactosidase (116 kDa), phosphorylase b (97 kDa), bovine serum albumin (68 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), and carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa). After transfer, the molecular weight marker lanes were stained with Ponceau S for detection. Transferrin (Intergen) and EGF (Life Technologies, Inc.) were labeled as described previously (20Warren R.A. Green F.A. Enns C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2116-2121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Prior to labeling, monoclonal antibodies were purified from ascites by binding to a column of either Protein A-agarose from Sigma (C7 and 2G11) or Protein A/G+-agarose from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (H4A3 and H4B4), followed by washes with 10 column volumes of 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 10 column volumes of 10 mmTris, pH 8.0. Purified antibody was eluted with 100 mmglycine, pH 3.0. Fractions were collected in tubes containing 1m Tris, pH 8.0 (to neutralize the acid), and protein content determined by OD280 measurement. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel elctrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining to verify purity and concentration. Once purified, C7 (720 μg), H4A3 (60 μg), or H4B4 (60 μg) was used in a 50–100-μl reaction of 225 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 0.5 units of lactoperoxidase (Sigma), 0.5 to 1.0 mCi of carrier-free Na125I (DuPont NEN), and 0.003% H2O2. After 5 min at room temperature, 25–50 μl of 2% blue dextran was added, and the protein was separated from unreacted Na125I on a 2-ml desalting column (Pierce). Purification and labeling of LDL was performed as described by Goldstein and colleagues (24Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods. Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). Cells grown to 90% confluency (∼106 cells per well) in 6-well plates, were washed on ice 2 times with cold wash medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium buffered with 20 mm HEPES pH 7.4). Incubation mixes were prepared for either 125I-Tf (35 nm125I-Tf ± 12.5 μm unlabeled Tf),125I-EGF (2.5 nm125I-EGF ± 250 nm unlabeled EGF), 125I-C7 (21 nm125I-C7 ± 500 nm unlabeled C7), 125I-LDL (10 nm125I-LDL ± 100 nm unlabeled LDL), 125I-H4A3 (5 nm125I-H4A3 ± 260 nmunlabeled H4A3), or 125I-H4B4 (2.6 nm125I-H4B4 ± 430 nm unlabeled H4B4). Nonspecific binding measurements were made by including unlabeled ligand or antibody in the incubation mixtures as shown. All bindings were carried out on ice, rocking for 90 min, after which they were washed four times in cold final wash (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm KCl, and 1 mm MgCl2), solubilized in 1.5 ml of 0.1 n NaOH, 0.1% Triton X-100, and counted for 1–6 min in a γ-counter. The rate of uptake was determined as described previously for the ligands 125I-Tf and125I-EGF (20Warren R.A. Green F.A. Enns C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2116-2121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Amounts of either 125I-labeled or unlabeled Tf, EGF, and C7 that were used in the uptake assay are as described above. Since our normal acid stripping procedure was only about 30% efficient at removing surface bound C7 antibody, it had to be modified. Instead of a 2-min wash with 3 ml of acid wash (0.2n acetic acid, 0.5 m NaCl), cells were incubated on ice for 5 min with 3 ml of 30 μg/ml Pronase (Pierce). This stripping procedure removed at least 90% of all surface bound125I-C7, without affecting the final cell count per well. Internalization rates for all ligands are expressed as number of125I-labeled molecules internalized per surface receptor per minute. Cell lines were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% gluteraldehyde in 100 mm HEPES pH 7.2 for 30 min at ambient temperature. The fixed cell pellets were rinsed with 100 mm HEPES, infused with polyvinylpyrrolidone and sucrose (25Tokuyasu K.T. Histochem J. 1989; 21: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), and prepared for cryosectioning (26Griffiths G. Simons K. Warren G. Tokuyasu K.T.

Chem. 1997; 272: 2116-2121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), followed by mouse anti-goat IgG (Jackson Research Labs), and goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to 10-nm gold particles (Amersham). Controls included the substitution of primary antibody with irrelevant antibodies, normal sheep IgG, or phosphate-buffered saline. We have generated three cell lines which can be induced to overexpress different receptors possessing tyrosine-based internalization signals, allowing us to test whether these signals will compete with themselves and each other. Stable HeLa cell lines transfected with the tetracycline repressible system were created to overexpress the EGFR, LDLR, or a Flag epitope-tagged TfR (fTfR). Western blots of positive stable clones selected from approximately 40 to 50 colonies show the degree to which the EGFR and LDLR can be induced. Clones LDLR21 (Fig. 1 a) and EGFR8 (Fig. 1 b) were chosen as the highest tetracycline-responsive expressors of LDLR and EGFR, respectively. Although EGFR8 cells can be maintained in the same growth media as fTfR20-2 cells, fully induced LDLR21 do not survive as well. This is probably due to an excessive and unregulated transport of lipid into the cell by the large population of LDLRs present on the cell surface. The physical appearance of induced LDLR21 cells supports this theory since numerous fatty vesicles, as determined by Oil Red-O staining (data not shown), are present in the cytosol. In order to circumvent this problem, 10% delipidated fetal bovine serum (prepared as described in Ref. 24Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods. Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar) was used in lieu of normal serum in LDLR21 media. Although usage of this media led to the up-regulation of endogenous LDLR and TfR (and possibly others), all subsequent comparisons with the LDLR21 cells were done in identical serum conditions. Characterization of the fTfR20-2 cells from previous studies showed that expression of fTfR as high as 20-fold over endogenous TfR, leads to significant competition for endocytosis (20Warren R.A. Green F.A. Enns C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2116-2121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To determine whether induction of the LDLR could saturate its own endocytosis, the rate of internalization for 125I-labeled C7 antibody (mouse IgG2a anti-LDLR) (28Beisiegel U. Schneider W.J. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G.W. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11923-11931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was examined in LDLR21 cells expressing a range of surface LDLR numbers. Beisiegel and co-workers (28Beisiegel U. Schneider W.J. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G.W. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11923-11931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) had previously demonstrated that this antibody reacted with a 1:1 stoichiometry with the LDLR and used it to measure the cycling of the LDLR. Use of the C7 antibody instead of the receptor's natural ligand, LDL, circumvents difficulties of losing LDL activity during radioactive labeling. Varying levels of LDLR expression were accomplished by first growing several sets of cells to maximal expression in the absence of tetracycline, and then adding tetracycline (2 μg/ml) to individual sets at different times before the experiment was performed (from 0 to 20 h). For each set of cells, a surface binding and uptake assay were performed using 125I-C7 to determine the surface LDLR number and rate of LDLR internalization, respectively. Our results show that across a 3.8-fold increase in the number of surface LDLRs (Fig. 2 a), a corresponding 3.2-fold decrease in the rate of LDLR internalization is observed (Fig. 2 b). For comparison, Davis and colleagues (29Davis C.G. Lehrman M.A. Russell D.W. Anderson R.G.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1986; 45: 15-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) showed that cells expressing LDLRs that are unable to undergo clathrin-mediated endocytosis due to a Tyr → Cys substitution in their internalization signal, internalize 125I-LDL at a rate that is 5-fold slower than that seen with normal cells. This suggests a minimum rate of endocytosis and sets the lower limit for the effect of competition. The competitive effect of EGFR overexpression was examined by performing surface bindings and uptake assays on EGFR8 cells, using125I-labeled EGF as the ligand, under conditions where all the EGFR would be triggered to endocytose. EGFR8 cells, grown either in the presence (+) or absence (−) of 2 μg/ml tetracycline, show a 6.8-fold increase in surface expression of EGFR (Fig. 2 c). At this level of expression, a corresponding 5-fold decrease in the rate of EGFR internalization is detected (Fig. 2 d). This receptor, like the LDLR, competes with itself for endocytosis. These results demonstrate that overexpression of either receptor results in a decrease in the efficiency (rate/receptor) of internalization of that receptor. If the receptors were competing for binding to different epitopes of the same protein then they should show similar saturation curves. The rates of endocytosis for each receptor was plotted against the cell surface number for the particular receptor to determine whether saturation of the pathway occurred with the same number of receptors (Fig. 2 e). The resulting graph indicates that the limiting component in EGF endocytosis is much lower than LDLR and TfR, implying that they compete for different rate-limiting molecules. The TfR and LDLR share similar trafficking pathways: they internalize via clathrin-coated pits, and recycle to the plasma membrane after delivering their cargo to the early endosome. Each receptor contains a tyrosine-based sorting motif in the cytoplasmic domain, but differ in their orientation to the plasma membrane (see Table I). Since TfR and LDLR recycle continuously, and both are capable of saturating their own endocytic pathway, we wanted to determine whether overexpression of one of these receptors could directly affect the rate of endocytosis of the other. fTfR20-2 cells grown in the presence (+) or absence (−) of 2 μg/ml tetracycline were used to measure TfR and LDLR surface binding and rate of uptake of 125I-C7. Even though fTfR is expressed at levels shown previously to be sufficient for saturation of TfR internalization (20Warren R.A. Green F.A. Enns C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2116-2121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), neither the number of LDLR on the cell surface (Fig. 3 a), nor the rate of LDLR internalization (Fig. 3 b) changes significantly. This suggests that the fTfR is saturating a different component of clathrin-mediated endocytosis than that of the LDLR.Table IInternalization signals Open table in a new tab Figure 3Lack of competition between different receptors. The results from surface bindings (a, c, ande) and uptake assays (b, d, and f) are shown for two tet-repressible cell lines. fTfR20-2 cells were grown in the presence (+) or absence (−) of 2 μg/ml tetracycline. A surface binding (a) was performed using either 21 nm125I-C7 (cross-hatched bars, seeinset for clarity) or 35 nm125I-Tf (solid bars). 125I-C7 was also used in an uptake assay (b) on the same set of cells. LDLR21 cells that were repressed at five different time points, as described in Fig. 2, were used to measure surface bindings (c) with either 21 nm125I-C7 (cross-hatched bars) or 35 nm125I-Tf (solid bars).125I-Tf was also used in an uptake assay (d) on the same set of cells. Surface bindings were also performed on LDLR21 cells grown in the presence (+) or absence (−) of 2 μg/ml tetracycline (e), using 2.5 nm125I-EGF (white bars) or 10 nm125I-LDL (cross-hatched bars). An uptake assay (f) was performed on the same set of cells using 21 nm125I-EGF. Addition of 500 nmunlabeled C7, 100 nm LDL, 12.5 μm unlabeled Tf, or 250 nm unlabeled EGF to two of six samples for each set were included in the respective incubation mixes for nonspecific binding and uptake measurements. Error bars indicate the standard deviation of the mean of quadruplicate samples. (Note: although the rate of Tf internalization in endogenous HeLa cells is usually around 0.30 to 0.35 Tf/cell/min, the lower measured rate of 0.15 to 0.20 Tf/cell/min in LDLR21 cells (d) is most likely due to growth of cells in media supplemented with delipidated fetal bovine serum, which is necessary for the survival of LDLR21 cells.)View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To examine whether the same was true for the saturation of LDLR endocytosis, LDLR21 cells expressing variable amounts of LDLR on the surface (prepared as described above) were used to measure endogenous surface TfR number (Fig. 3 c) and rate of 125I-Tf internalization (Fig. 3 d). Even though LDLR numbers are at levels shown earlier to be sufficient to saturate its own endocytosis, neither the number of surface TfRs nor the rate of TfR internalization changes significantly. This experiment confirms our results with the fTfR20-2 cell line, and strongly supports the idea that these two receptors are competing for different limiting components. Previously, we have shown that TfR does not compete with EGFR for endocytosis (20Warren R.A. Green F.A. Enns C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2116-2121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and in this study demonstrate a lack of significant competition between the TfR and LDLR. To determine whether LDLR and EGFR compete for endocytosis, LDLR21 cells were grown in the presence (+) or absence (−) of 2 μg/ml tetracycline, and used to measure both the surface LDLR and EGFR number, as well as determine the rate of uptake of 125I-EGF. The results show that a 7-fold increase in LDLR (Fig. 3 e) does not significantly affect either the surface expression of EGFR or its rate of internalization (Fig. 3 f). Saturation of an endocytic pathway by overexpression of a receptor should result in the accumulation of the receptor at the rate-limiting step in the endocytic/recycling pathway. Previous studies of ours and others indicate that the rate-limiting step is at an early point in the pathway, since receptors accumulate on the cell surface rather than in endocytic compartments (15Marks M.S. Woodruff L. Ohno H. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 341-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 20Warren R.A. Green F.A. Enns C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2116-2121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To visualize this and determine whether the limiting step was at the level of receptor clustering or endocytosis, frozen thin sections of fTfR20-2 cells grown in the presence or absence of tetracycline were immunolabeled with sheep anti-TfR antibody, followed by mouse anti-goat IgG, and goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to 10-nm gold. In the absence of fTfR expression (Fig. 4 a), endogenous TfR is present on the plasma membrane in small amounts. After 3 days (Fig. 4 b) or more than 7 days (Fig. 4 b,inset) in the absence of tetracycline, fTfR expression increases dramatically and greater numbers of total TfRs are present on the cell surface. The immunogold label is more homogeneously distributed along the plasma membrane compared with cells lacking fTfR expression. In addition, there is not a significant increase in the the amount of coated vesicles proteins in these cells (Fig. 5). These results indicate that the limiting step during overexpression of fTfR is at the level of receptor aggregation.Figure 5Levels of AP2 and dyanmin tetracycline-repressible stable cell lines. Cell lysates (6 × 105 cells) from the fTfR-20, LDLR21, and EGFR8 cell lines, grown in the presence or absence of tetracycline for greater than 3 days, were run on SDS-polyacrylamide (8%) gels reducing conditions. After transfer to nitrocellulose, blots were immunodetected with a monoclonal antibody to AP2 (1:5000) (A4325, Sigma) or a rabbit anti-dynamin antibody (1:10,000) (gift from Sandy Schmid, Scripps Institution) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:10,000). The bands were visualized by chemilminescence (Supersignal, Pierce).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) If the TfR distribution shifts to the plasma membrane during endocytic saturation of this receptor, then it follows that other molecules competing for the same pathway of internalization should show a similar shift in equilibrium, detectable as an increase in surface population. We decided to look at the surface populations of the lysosomal associated proteins Lamp1 and Lamp2, for several reasons. First of all, both of these proteins have very short cytoplasmic domains (see TableI) each containing a highly conserved tyrosine residue in a YXX∅ conformation (30Fukuda M. Viitala J. Matteson J.

Stimulation by CSF-1 at 4 °C was used to facilitate the purification and identification of the proteins of the cytosolic anti-phosphotyrosine (PY)-reactive fraction (αPY-RF) involved in downstream signaling pathways. Confocal microscopy revealed that the PY proteins are in close proximity to the CSF-1R at the plasma membrane. The αPY-RF contained pre-existing complexes of PY proteins and non-PY proteins which generally increased in size and PY protein content following CSF-1 stimulation. PY proteins identified by microsequencing and Western blotting include Cbl, STAT3, STAT5a, STAT5b, SHP-1, Shc, and two novel proteins pp57 and pp37.

BAC1.2F5 cells morphologically resemble primary macrophages and, like primary macrophages, require CSF-1 for both survival and proliferation (8Morgan C.J. Pollard J.W. Stanley E.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 130: 420-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). They also exhibit similar chemotactic and morphological responses to CSF-1 (4Boocock C.A. Jones G.E. Stanley E.R. Pollard J.W.

Jones G.E. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 793-803PubMed Google Scholar). When cultured overnight in the absence of CSF-1, BAC1.2F5 cells round up and become less mobile. In response to re-addition of CSF-1, these cells rapidly (5 min) spread and produce membrane ruffles and lamellipodia and regain their motility (4Boocock C.A. Jones G.E. Stanley E.R. Pollard J.W. J.

Incubation of BAC1.2F5 macrophages with CSF-1 causes dimerization, activation, and tyrosine phosphorylation of the CSF-1 receptor (CSF-1R), followed by the tyrosine phosphorylation of several primarily cytoplasmic proteins (15Li W.

Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1795-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The identities of the majority of these proteins are still unknown. At 37 °C, their appearance is maximally stimulated by 60 s (18Sengupta A. Liu W.-K. Yeung Y.-G. Yeung D.C.-Y. Frackelton A.R. Stanley E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

They may represent direct substrates of the activated CSF-1R or substrates of non-receptor tyrosine kinases activated in the CSF-1 response, or alternatively, the increased tyrosine phosphorylation may be due to CSF-1-induced inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatases. At 4 °C, these proteins are tyrosine-phosphorylated with slower kinetics than at 37 °C (16Li W. Yeung Y.-G. Stanley E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6808-6814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Sengupta A. Liu W.-K. Yeung Y.-G. Yeung D.C.-Y. Frackelton A.R. Stanley E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8062-8066Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), but the rates of phosphotyrosine dephosphorylation are differentially lowered. Thus, CSF-1-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation reaches a relatively stable maximum between 90 and 180 min (16Li W. Yeung Y.-G. Stanley E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6808-6814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Sengupta A. Liu W.-K. Yeung Y.-G. Yeung D.C.-Y. Frackelton A.R. Stanley E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Analysis of the stimulation of cells with CSF-1 at 4 °C has enabled differences in the kinetics of the appearance of the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins to be resolved (16Li W. Yeung Y.-G. Stanley E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6808-6814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, by stimulating BAC1.2F5 cells with CSF-1 at 4 °C for 2 h, it is possible to carry out large scale stimulation and subcellular fractionation in order to isolate sufficient amounts of anti-phosphotyrosine (PY)-reactive fraction (αPY-RF) proteins from the subcellular fractions for their identification (20Yeung Y.-G. Berg K.L. Pixley F.J. Angeletti R.H. Stanley E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23447-23450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Essentially the same pattern of protein tyrosine phosphorylation is observed following CSF-1 stimulation at either 4 °C for 2 h or 37 °C for 1 min. However, at 4 °C, subsequent events, e.g. Raf activation and phosphorylation (21Baccarini M. Sabatini D.M. App H. Rapp U.R. Stanley E.R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3649-3657Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), are blocked. Thus, analysis of the stimulation of cells with CSF-1 at 4 °C has been very useful in analyzing the very early events in CSF-1 signal transduction. As indicated above, with the exception of the CSF-1R, a 260-kDa protein which we now know to be a multi-ubiquitinated form of the CSF-1R (22Wang Y. Yeung Y.-G. Langdon W.Y. Stanley E.R. J. Biol.

Hence, we have focused on the identification of the PY proteins in the cytosolic fraction. In our analysis of the cytosolic αPY-RF from CSF-1-stimulated and unstimulated BAC1.2F5 macrophages, the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 was identified by microsequencing of the purified protein (20Yeung Y.-G.

In this report, we describe the use of anti-PY affinity chromatography for the isolation of PY proteins and the non-PY proteins associated with them from the cytosolic fraction of CSF-1-stimulated macrophages. By using Western blotting with antibodies to known proteins and direct purification and microsequencing approaches, we have identified a number of PY and non-PY proteins in the cytosolic αPY-RF, and we demonstrate that these proteins are present in various complexes. We also demonstrate that there is significant reorganization of proteins in these complexes in response to CSF-1 stimulation. BAC1.2F5 macrophages (8Morgan C.J. Pollard J.W. Stanley E.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 130: 420-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) were cultured in 100-mm tissue culture dishes and stimulated with 13.2 nm CSF-1 (human recombinant macrophage colony-stimulating factor, a gift from Chiron Corp.) at 4 °C in the presence of 8 mm iodoacetic acid (IAA, Fluka) to increase the yield of PY proteins, as described previously (15Li W. Stanley E.R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Subcellular fractionation of the cells after CSF-1 stimulation, purification of αPY-RF from the cytosol, trypsin digestion, and separation of tryptic peptides for micro-sequencing were performed exactly as described previously (20Yeung Y.-G. Berg K.L. Pixley F.J. Angeletti R.H. Stanley E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23447-23450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the exception that the C4 reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) was performed at 55 °C and the C8 RP-HPLC at 40 °C. Briefly, cells were disrupted by Dounce homogenization, and subcellular fractions were separated by differential centrifugation. The αPY-RF from the 100,000 × g post-microsomal cytosolic fraction was prepared by affinity column chromatography using anti-PY antibody (Ab1) coupled to Sepharose 4B (Calbiochem). Proteins reactive to the anti-PY antibody were eluted with 5 mm phenyl phosphate (Sigma). Proteins in the eluted cytosolic αPY-RF were denatured and reduced in 6 m guanidine HCl (GdnHCl, Pierce) and 0.1 mβ-mercaptoethanol, and separated by denaturing size exclusion chromatography on a Superose 6 (S6) column (1 × 30 cm, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the presence of 6 m GdnHCl and 0.1m β-mercaptoethanol. Fractions containing proteins of interest were pooled and separated by C4 RP-HPLC at 55 °C. Each protein purified from the C4 RP-HPLC was digested with trypsin (sequencing grade, Boehringer Mannheim), and the peptides generated were resolved by C8 RP-HPLC at 40 °C. Sequences of the peptides were determined using an Applied Biosystem 477A protein sequenator. Anti-CSF-1R antibodies against two cytoplasmic domain peptides (an interkinase domain peptide, EGDSSYKNIHLEKKYVRRDSGFC, and a C-terminal domain peptide, NNDGDYANLPSSGGSGSDSC) were raised in goat by immunizing with a mixture of the two keyhole limpet hemocyanin-coupled peptides (29Büscher D. Dello Sbarba P. Hipskind R.A. Rapp U.R. Stanley E.R. Baccarini M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3323-3332PubMed Google Scholar). The antibodies specific to each peptide were purified from the serum by peptide affinity chromatography and a 1:1 mixture of the two affinity purified antibodies was used. FITC-coupled donkey anti-mouse and Cy3-coupled donkey anti-goat antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Anti-actin (clone C4) was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. Anti-vimentin and anti-tropomyosin were obtained from Sigma. Anti-Cbl, anti-STAT5a, anti-STAT5b, and anti-Vav were purchased from Santa Cruz. Anti-paxillin, anti-Grb2, anti-Shc, anti-STAT1, anti-STAT3, anti-PY (PY20, mouse monoclonal), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated αPY antibody (horseradish peroxidase-RC20) were from Transduction Laboratory. Anti-SHP-1 was raised in rabbit against the C-terminal peptide, KREEKVKKQRSADKEKS (20Yeung Y.-G. Berg K.L. Pixley F.J. Angeletti R.H. Stanley E.R. J. Biol.

Chicken anti-elongation factor-1α (EF-1α) antiserum was raised against the C-terminal peptide AGAGKVTKSAQKAQKAK and purified by peptide affinity chromatography (30Edmonds B.T. Wyckoff J. Yeung Y.G. Wang Y. Stanley E.R. Jones J. Segall J. Condeelis J. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2705-2714PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-human p85 (regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase)) antibody was a gift from Dr. Jonathan Backer of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. An affinity purified antibody to the C-terminal half of the chicken gizzard myosin regulatory light chain (MRLC) was kindly provided by Dr. Kathleen Trybus of Brandeis University. The distribution of PY proteins and the CSF-1R in CSF-1-stimulated and unstimulated cells was assessed by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. Cells were plated onto chamber slides (21 × 20 mm well, Lab-Tek, Nalge Nunc International) and cultured for at least 24 h. Cells were incubated without CSF-1 for 18 h and then stimulated with 13.2 nm CSF-1 at 4 °C for 10 min and 2 h as described previously (15Li W. Stanley E.R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Stimulation medium was removed at the end of incubation, and cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in buffer F (5 mm PIPES, pH 7.2, 1.1 mmNa2HPO4, 0.4 mmKH2PO4, 137 mm KCl, 4.0 mm NaHCO3, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, and 5.5 mm glucose) for 5 min at 37 °C. Subsequent procedures were then carried out at room temperature. The fixed cells were extracted with 0.5% Triton X-100 in buffer F for 10 min and incubated in 0.1 m glycine in buffer F for 10 min to quench aldehyde autofluorescence. After washing 5 times (5 min each time) with the blocking solution (1% bovine serum albumin, 5% normal donkey serum, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 154 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 0.02% NaN3), cells were incubated with the same blocking solution for a further 30 min to block nonspecific immunoreactive sites. Anti-PY (4 μg/ml) and anti-CSF-1R (20 μg/ml) antibodies dissolved in blocking solution were incubated with the cells for 1 h. Unbound antibodies were removed by washing the cells 5 times (5 min each time) with the washing solution (1% bovine serum albumin, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 154 mm NaCl). The cells were then incubated for 1 h with donkey anti-goat antibody (3.75 μg/ml, Cy3-labeled) and donkey anti-mouse antibody (7.5 μg/ml, FITC-labeled) dissolved in blocking solution. After thorough washing (5 times for 5 min each time) with washing solution, the cells were mounted in a medium containing 50% glycerol, 20 mmTris-HCl, 154 mm NaCl, and 100 mg/ml 1,4-diazabicyclo-(2.2.2)octane (Sigma) and examined under a Bio-Rad MRC 600 Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (15Li W. Stanley E.R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 20Yeung Y.-G. Berg K.L. Pixley F.J. Angeletti R.H. Stanley E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23447-23450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All immunoblots were developed with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody and ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The first dimension non-denaturing electrophoresis utilized a 1-mm thick vertical slab gradient (5% acrylamide (10% bis-acrylamide), 15% acrylamide (5% bis-acrylamide)) gel containing 0.01% Triton X-100 polymerized on Gel Bond film (FMC bioproduct) backing and using the buffer system of Davis (31Davis B.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 404-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (15961) Google Scholar). 32P labeling of the cells was performed as described previously (16Li W. Yeung Y.-G. Stanley E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6808-6814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 32P-labeled αPY-RFs from CSF-1-stimulated and unstimulated cells were diluted in stacking gel buffer containing 4% sucrose and 1% Triton X-100 at pH 6.8 for loading, and the gel was run at 12 V/cm for 24 h at 4 °C. Following the first dimension electrophoresis, the gel was removed from the glass plates, blotted to remove excess buffer, wrapped in a layer of plastic food wrap, and exposed to x-ray film for 5 h. The gel lanes comprising the first dimension were cut out with reference to the autoradiogram, immersed in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide (SDS-PAGE) sample buffer (1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 0.1 m β-mercaptoethanol, 6% glycerol, and 0.01% bromophenol blue) without shaking for 2 h at 37 °C and then secured on top of the stacking gel of a 1.5-mm thick, SDS-polyacrylamide gradient slab gel (7.5–17.5% acrylamide, 2.7% bis-acrylamide, Laemmli (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207472) Google Scholar) system) with 0.5% agarose in SDS sample buffer without glycerol. The gel was electrophoresed at 8 V/cm for 18 h at 16 °C, stained with Coomassie Blue, dried, and autoradiographed. An S6 column equilibrated in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 200 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.8% octyl glucoside, and 1 mm benzamidine was run at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min at 4 °C. The αPY-RF (0.2 ml, ∼1 mg/ml) was clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min prior to injection. Protein concentration was monitored at 280 nm, and 0.3-ml fractions were collected. Starting from the fraction containing the protein eluted at the void volume of the column, fractions were pooled in groups of four to yield 10 large fractions of 1.2 ml each, for further analysis. To 100 μl of αPY-RF (containing ∼0.8 mg of protein), 110 mg of GdnHCl, 9.5 μl of 2 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and 1.4 μl of β-mercaptoethanol were added to yield 190 μl of αPY-RF in 6m GdnHCl, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and 0.1m mercaptoethanol. The resulting solution was incubated at room temperature for 2 h and centrifuged at 13,000 ×g for 15 min. The reduced, denatured, and clarified αPY-RF was then injected into an S6 column equilibrated at room temperature in 6 m GdnHCl, 0.5% dodecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (Sigma), 0.1 m β-mercaptoethanol, and 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.5, at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Protein concentration was monitored at 280 nm, and 0.3-ml fractions were collected. DNase I (Sigma) was coupled to Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a concentration of 1 mg of protein per ml of gel by cyanogen bromide activation, and the DNase I binding reaction was performed as described previously (33Zechel K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 110: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Cytosolic extract (60 μg) or the αPY-RF (approximately 6 μg from stimulated and 4 μg from unstimulated cells) prepared from 6 mg of cytosolic protein was incubated with 50 μl (packed volume) of the DNase I-Sepharose beads in buffer A (2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.8% octyl glucoside) at 4 °C for 3 h. The beads were then washed 4 times each with 0.5 ml of buffer A containing 0.2 mNH4Cl (salt wash) and then two times with buffer A. The bound proteins were eluted by incubating the beads with equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer at 60 °C for 30 min. The cytosolic αPY-RF from both CSF-1-stimulated and unstimulated cells prepared from 10 confluent 100-mm culture dishes (∼80 × 106 cells) was incubated with 2 nmol of either phalloidin-XX-biotin (Molecular Probes) or 2 nmol of biotin (Sigma) in buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 m sucrose, 0.8% octyl glucoside, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) in a final volume of 20 μl for 18 h at 4 °C. The reaction mixtures were then incubated for 2 h with 25 μl (packed volume) avidin-agarose (Sigma) equilibrated in buffer B at 4 °C, with continuous agitation. The agarose beads were pelleted by centrifugation and washed 6 times each with 0.5 ml of buffer B at 4 °C. The initial supernatant and the first 2 washes were pooled and concentrated by microcon 30 (Amicon) to 20 μl. The thoroughly washed agarose beads were incubated with equal volume of 2% SDS and heated at 60 °C for 30 min to elute the bound proteins. Cytochalasin D (Sigma) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO, Sigma) at 5 mg/ml. Cells were incubated without CSF-1 for 18 h. Cytochalasin D solution (2.8 μl) was added to each dish (final concentration, 5 μm), and the cells were incubated for a further 3 h without CSF-1 at 37 °C. Control cells received the same volume of Me2SO. CSF-1 was then added (final concentration, 13.2 nm), and the cells were lysed with Nonidet P-40 buffer at various times as described previously (16Li W. Yeung Y.-G. Stanley E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6808-6814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were resolved by gradient SDS-PAGE (7.5–17.5% acrylamide) (20Yeung Y.-G. Berg K.L. Pixley F.J. Angeletti R.H. Stanley E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23447-23450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Silver staining of protein in SDS-PAGE was carried out by the method of Morrissey (34Morrissey J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 117: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2941) Google Scholar). Protein determination was carried out as described previously (20Yeung Y.-G. Berg K.L. Pixley F.J. Angeletti R.H. Stanley E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23447-23450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For all of the following experiments with the exception of experiment shown in Fig. 9, BAC1.2F5 macrophages were preincubated without CSF-1 for 18 h at 37 °C and then incubated for 10 min or 2 h at 4 °C in the presence or absence of CSF-1. The distribution of PY proteins in relation to distribution of the CSF-1R in cells under these conditions was determined by confocal microscopy of cells incubated with mouse anti-PY and goat anti-CSF-1R antibodies and visualized with FITC-coupled anti-mouse and Cy3-coupled anti-goat secondary antibodies, respectively. Under the conditions used, at 10 min after addition of CSF-1, the CSF-1R represents ≥50% of the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. By 2 h after CSF-1 addition, it represents ≤25% (15Li W. Stanley E.R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 16Li W. Yeung Y.-G. Stanley E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6808-6814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Sengupta A.

At 10 min after addition of CSF-1, strong overlapping and punctate expression of CSF-1R and protein tyrosine phosphorylation were observed at the plasma membrane (Fig. 1). Some CSF-1R was localized in an internal perinuclear structure, probably the Golgi complex, which contains the CSF-1R precursor, representing ∼25% of the total cellular CSF-1R as determined by its lower molecular mass and by its content of N-linked oligosaccharides of the high mannose type (35Sherr C.J. Blood. 1990; 75: 1-12Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In cells stimulated with CSF-1 for 2 h, the intensity of anti-PY staining was significantly increased, and the staining was more evenly distributed in the vicinity of the plasma membrane, whereas the CSF-1R staining maintained the punctate appearance seen at 10 min of stimulation (Fig. 1). Thus the proteins exhibiting an increase in phosphotyrosine in response to CSF-1 at 4 °C, despite their predominance in the cytosolic fraction (18Sengupta A. Liu W.-K. Yeung Y.-G. Yeung D.C.-Y.

https://openalex.org/W2027962993,"Activation of receptor tyrosine kinases is thought to involve ligand-induced dimerization, which promotes receptor transphosphorylation and thereby increases the receptor's phosphotransferase activity. We used two platelet-derived growth factor β-receptor (β-PDGFR) mutants to identify events that are required for full engagement (autophosphorylation and activation of the kinase activity) of the β-PDGFR kinase. The F79/81 receptor (Tyr to Phe substitution at 579 and 581 in the juxtamembrane domain of the receptor) was capable of only very modest ligand-dependent autophosphorylation and also failed to associate with numerous SH2 domain-containing proteins. Furthermore, stimulation with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) did not increase the kinase activity of the F79/81 mutant toward exogenous substrates. However, the F79/81 receptor had basal kinase activity and could be artificially stimulated by incubation with ATP. Because the low kinase activity of the F857 mutant (Tyr to Phe substitution at 857 in the putative activation loop) could not be increased by incubation with ATP, failure to phosphorylate Tyr-857 may be the reason why the F79/81 mutant has low kinase activity. Surprisingly, the F857 mutant underwent efficient PDGF-dependent autophosphorylation. Thus the PDGF-dependent increase in the kinase activity of the receptor is not required for autophosphorylation. We conclude that full activation of the β-PDGFR kinase requires at least two, apparently distinct events.

Much work has indicated that dimerization is both necessary and sufficient to activate the kinase activity of the receptor, leading to autophosphorylation of the receptor and the subsequent binding and phosphorylation of downstream signaling proteins (reviewed in Refs. 2Heldin C.-H.

Receptor activation is the first step in the increasingly complex signaling cascades induced by receptor tyrosine kinases; therefore a complete understanding of the activation process is important. Many tyrosines in the intracellular portion of the β-PDGFR have been shown to be phosphorylated in response to ligand binding to the extracellular portion of the receptor. Phosphorylation of tyrosine 857 in the putative kinase activation loop has been shown to be required for maximal receptor kinase activity (6Kazlauskas A. Durden D.L. Cooper J.A.

Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3644-3653Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In addition we found that the β-PDGFR did not become efficiently tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to PDGF and as a result was unable to recruit wild type levels of SH2 domain-containing proteins. However, in contrast to previous findings (17Mori S. Ronnstrand L. Yokote K. Engstrom A. Courtneidge S.A. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.-H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2257-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) we found that the F79/81 receptor was not devoid of kinase activity, with the basal phosphorylation of the F79/81 receptor being comparable or slightly higher than that of the WT receptor. In addition we found that the F79/81 receptor kinase activity could be artificially activated by incubation with ATP. To investigate the defect in the ligand-induced activation of the F79/81 receptor we compared it to another β-PDGFR mutant where tyrosine 857 was replaced with phenylalanine. In contrast to the F79/81 receptor, the F857 receptor became highly tyrosine-phosphorylated following exposure to PDGF. However, despite being highly tyrosine-phosphorylated the F857 receptor was not activated as a kinase toward exogenous substrates. Comparison between the F79/81 and F857 receptors indicated that there are at least two distinct steps in receptor activation, autophosphorylation that requires tyrosines 579 and 581 in the juxtamembrane region and phosphorylation of tyrosine 857 that allows the receptor to phosphorylate exogenous substrates. HepG2 cells, a human hepatoma cell line that does not express endogenous β-PDGF receptors, were cultured and maintained as described previously (20Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Cell. 1993; 73: 321-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Substitutions of phenylalanine for tyrosine at positions 579 and 581 in the human β-PDGF receptor were performed by site-directed mutagenesis as described previously (19Vaillancourt R.R. Heasley L.E. Zamarripa J. Storey B. Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3644-3653Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The mutated receptor DNA was subcloned into the pLXSN2 vector and introduced into the ψ2 and PA317 packaging cell lines, and the resulting virus was used to infect parental HepG2 cells (20Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Cell. 1993; 73: 321-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). The infected cells were selected in the presence of 1 mg/ml (active concentration) G418, and the resulting mass populations were sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorter using the human β-PDGF receptor-specific monoclonal antibody PR7212 (Genzyme) to obtain cell lines expressing comparable levels of receptors, previously estimated to be 5 × 105 receptors/cell (20Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Cell. 1993; 73: 321-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells were grown to 80% confluence and then incubated for 16–20 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum. Cells were then treated with 40 ng/ml PDGF-BB or with buffer alone at 37 °C for the indicated times. Cells were washed twice with HS (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) and then lysed in EB (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% BSA, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) (22Kazlauskas A. Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1395-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Lysates were centrifuged for 20 min at 12,000 ×g, and receptors were immunoprecipitated from the soluble fraction with the 30A antiserum, which is specific for the β-PDGFR (24Valius M. Bazenet C. Kazlauskas A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 133-143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immune complexes were bound to formalin-fixed membranes ofStaphylococcus aureus, spun through an EB sucrose gradient, and then washed twice with EB, PAN (10 mm Pipes, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1% aprotinin) + 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and PAN (23Kazlauskas A. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3279-3286Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and resuspended in PAN before being used in kinase assays or analyzed by Western blotting. To immunoprecipitate Src, resting or stimulated HepG2 cells were lysed in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 30 mm Na2HPO4, 50 mm NaF, 40 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% BSA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mmNa3VO4, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin. Lysates were spun for 10 min at 12,000 × g, and Src family members were precipitated from the supernatant using Src-2 antiserum (Santa Cruz). Immune complexes were collected on protein A-Sepharose and washed three times with lysis buffer and twice with buffer lacking BSA. For Western analysis, proteins were resolved by electrophoresis on 7.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon. Membranes were incubated for 1 h in TBST (10 mm Tris base, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20) and 2% BSA for probing with antiphosphotyrosine or TBST + 5% nonfat dry milk for all other antibodies. The following primary antibodies were used: β-PDGFR, 30A 1:1,000; antiphosphotyrosine 4G10 (UBI):PY20 (Transduction) 1:1, 1:1,000; PLCγ (mixture of monoclonals from UBI) 0.25 μg/ml; p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase (UBI) 1:1,000; RasGAP 69.3 (24Valius M. Bazenet C. Kazlauskas A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 133-143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) 1:1,000. Secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) diluted 1:2,000, and all blots were visualized using ECL detection. β-PDGFR immunoprecipitates were subjected to a standard in vitro kinase assay (6Kazlauskas A. Durden D.L. Cooper J.A. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 413-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) in the presence of 100 μm peptide (MAEEEEYVFIEAKKK) or 0.5 μg of GST-PLCγ and 10 μCi of γ-[32P]ATP in universal kinase buffer (UKB) (20 mm Pipes, pH 7.0, 10 mmMnCl2, 20 μg/ml aprotinin). To pretreat samples with unlabeled ATP, immunoprecipitates were incubated with UKB containing 10 μm ATP for 20 min at 30 °C and then washed once with PAN before being subjected to an in vitro kinase assay. Phosphorylated peptides were separated from γ-[32P]ATP on cellulose plates by thin layer electrophoresis at pH 3.5, and phosphorylated GST-PLCγ was separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE. The level of phosphorylation of peptide or GST-PLCγ was quantitated using Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager IQ software. Equal volumes of 20 mm H2O2 and 2 mmNa3VO4 were combined at room temperature for 10 min. The resulting solution was added to intact cells to a final concentration of 1 mm H2O2 and 0.1 mm Na3VO4. Tyrosines 579 and 581 in the juxtamembrane region of the human β-PDGFR were mutated to phenylalanine (19Vaillancourt R.R. Heasley L.E. Zamarripa J. Storey B. Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3644-3653Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and the resulting receptor (F79/81) was expressed in HepG2 cells. HepG2 cells express a very low level of PDGF α-receptor and no detectable β-PDGFRs (29Valius M. Secrist J.P. Kazlauskas A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3058-3071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It had been previously reported that mutation of tyrosines 579 and 581 resulted in a kinase-inactive receptor (17Mori S. Ronnstrand L. Yokote K. Engstrom A. Courtneidge S.A. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.-H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2257-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) or a receptor with reduced kinase activity (19Vaillancourt R.R. Heasley L.E. Zamarripa J. Storey B. Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3644-3653Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Therefore, we first compared the ability of the F79/81 receptor to become phosphorylated in response to PDGF with the WT receptor and a receptor with a mutation at tyrosine 857 (F857) previously shown to be required for full kinase activity (6Kazlauskas A. Durden D.L. Cooper J.A. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 413-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 7Fantl W.J. Escobedo J.A. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4473-4478Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells expressing these receptors were exposed to 40 ng/ml PDGF-BB for 5 min and then lysed and β-PDGFR-immunoprecipitated. A portion of the immunoprecipitates representing approximately 1.5 × 106 cells was analyzed for phosphotyrosine content and receptor levels by Western blot (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 A shows that the WT receptor had undetectable levels of phosphorylation in resting cells and became highly tyrosine-phosphorylated after exposure to PDGF. Surprisingly the F857 receptor also became highly tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to PDGF, although levels of phosphorylation were slightly reduced compared with WT. Note that part of the apparently lower F857 phosphorylation compared with WT following PDGF stimulation was because of there being less F857 that WT receptor (Fig. 1 B). In contrast to the WT and F857 receptors, the F79/81 receptor was very poorly phosphorylated following addition of PDGF despite approximately equal amounts of receptor being present in the samples (Fig. 1 B). Increasing the length of time that the cells were exposed to PDGF had no effect on the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of the F79/81 receptor (data not shown). Phosphorylation of the β-PDGFR is required for the association of many SH2 domain-containing proteins. Our finding that the F79/81 receptor was poorly phosphorylated suggested that the Src family members may not be the only SH2-containing proteins that cannot associate efficiently with the F79/81 receptor. Consequently, we tested the ability of the F79/81 receptor to associate with a number of proteins that have been shown to bind to the WT receptor following PDGF stimulation. Receptors were immunoprecipitated from resting or stimulated cells and subjected to Western blot analysis for the β-PDGFR, PLCγ, RasGAP, and the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase (p85). As shown in Fig. 2 A, the F79/81 receptor bound reduced amounts of PLCγ and p85 and undetectable levels of RasGAP compared with the WT receptor. The F857 receptor bound the proteins to levels similar as the WT receptor. The kinase dead receptor (R634) included as a control did not detectably bind any of the proteins that associate with the WT receptor. Like the receptor-associated proteins described above, Src family members bind to the β-PDGFR directly, via the SH2 domain (18Kypta R.M. Goldberg Y. Ulug E.T. Courtneidge S.A. Cell. 1990; 62: 481-492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 42Twamley G.M. Kypta R.M. Hall B. Courtneidge S.A. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1893-1901PubMed Google Scholar). We and others have found that the best way to detect this interaction is by immunoprecipitating Src and looking for associated receptor. Fig. 2 B shows that the amount of receptor coprecipitating with Src increased markedly in response to PDGF, whereas no receptor was detected in Src immunoprecipitates from F79/81 or kinase dead receptor-expressing cells, regardless of the presence of PDGF. The amount of receptor-Src complex that was detected in PDGF-stimulated cells expressing receptors singly mutated at either 579 or 581 was also dramatically reduced. In contrast, mutating either of these tyrosines individually had much less of an effect on receptor autophosphorylation and recruitment of SH2 domain-containing proteins, although mutating tyrosine 579 had more of an effect than substituting tyrosine 581 (data not shown). The data presented in Fig. 2 are consistent with previous findings that Src associates with the β-PDGFR provided that tyrosines 579 and 581 are phosphorylated (17Mori S. Ronnstrand L. Yokote K. Engstrom A. Courtneidge S.A. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.-H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2257-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 19Vaillancourt R.R. Heasley L.E. Zamarripa J. Storey B. Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3644-3653Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Our findings indicate that the F79/81 receptor is not a selective Src binding mutant since the binding of other SH2 domain-containing proteins to the F79/81 receptor was also compromised. This was not a surprising result because we and others showed that the F79/81 receptor was very poorly tyrosine-phosphorylated following ligand stimulation (Fig. 1) (17Mori S. Ronnstrand L. Yokote K. Engstrom A. Courtneidge S.A. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.-H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2257-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 19Vaillancourt R.R. Heasley L.E. Zamarripa J. Storey B. Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3644-3653Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In agreement with Vaillancourt et al. (19Vaillancourt R.R. Heasley L.E. Zamarripa J. Storey B. Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3644-3653Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) we found that the amount of F79/81 receptor phosphorylation could be modestly increased following ligand stimulation, whereas Mori et al. (17Mori S. Ronnstrand L. Yokote K. Engstrom A. Courtneidge S.A. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.-H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2257-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) found that this receptor was not detectably phosphorylated. The difference between our data and that of Mori et al. (17Mori S. Ronnstrand L. Yokote K. Engstrom A. Courtneidge S.A. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.-H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2257-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) could be related to the cell type used, as we expressed the receptors in HepG2 cells whereas Mori et al. (17Mori S. Ronnstrand L. Yokote K. Engstrom A. Courtneidge S.A. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.-H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2257-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) used pig aortic endothelium cells. When expressed in other cell types (PC12 (19Vaillancourt R.R. Heasley L.E. Zamarripa J. Storey B. Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3644-3653Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) or Ba/F3 cells (25Drummond-Barbosa D. Vaillancourt R.R. Kazlauskas A. DiMaio D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2570-2581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) the F79/81 receptor did show some receptor autophosphorylation and kinase activity, similar to the data presented here for HepG2 cells. Because none of the cell lines used for these studies naturally express the β-PDGFR, it is possible that they do not accurately reflect the behavior of the F79/81 receptor in a natural setting. We have expressed a chimeric α/β F72/74 receptor (26DeMali K.A. Kazlauskas A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2014-2022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in Ph cells, which are a 3T3-like cell line that does not express the α-PDGFR, as well as in HepG2 cells. This chimeric receptor mutant behaved comparably when expressed in these two cell lines. 2K. DeMali and A. Kazlauskas, unpublished observations. These findings indirectly indicate that the behavior of the F79/81 receptor is not dramatically altered by expressing it in the HepG2 cells. Ongoing studies, in which the mutant receptors will be expressed in mesenchymal cells devoid of either α- or β-PDGFRs, will better address these issues. One explanation for the failure of PDGF to promote the phosphorylation of the F79/81 receptor is that the mutant receptors are unable to dimerize correctly. This does not appear to be the case because the ligand binding domain is within the first three IgG loops in the extracellular domain, and mutations within the cytoplasmic domain have not been shown to inhibit ligand binding or dimerization of the receptors. Furthermore, mutation of tyrosine 579 or 581 alone had no effect on ligand binding (17Mori S. Ronnstrand L. Yokote K. Engstrom A. Courtneidge S.A. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.-H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2257-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Finally, we found that the F79/81 and WT receptors underwent a comparable extent of the PDGF-dependent dimerization (data not shown). These data indicate that replacing tyrosines 579 and 581 with phenylalanine did not prevent binding of PDGF to the extracellular domain of the receptor or receptor dimerization. A second possibility is that the phosphorylation of the juxtamembrane sites makes a very large contribution to the overall phosphorylation of the receptor. However, it has been shown that in vivo the most highly phosphorylated sites in the receptor are at tyrosines 857 and 751 (16Kazlauskas A. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1989; 58: 1121-1133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In addition, the phosphorylation of sites 579 and 581 was not detectable by standard phosphopeptide mapping techniques suggesting that they are phosphorylated to low stoichiometry in vivo(17Mori S. Ronnstrand L. Yokote K. Engstrom A. Courtneidge S.A. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.-H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2257-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Mutation of tyrosine 751 alone or in combination with up to four other tyrosines involved in binding-associated proteins did not prevent the receptor from undergoing extensive tyrosine phosphorylationin vivo (27Joly M. Kazlauskas A. Fay F.S. Corvera S. Science. 1994; 263: 684-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Therefore it is unlikely that the decrease in phosphorylation of the F79/81 receptor is because of the lack of two phosphorylation sites. Because the activation of receptor tyrosine kinases has been inextricably linked with receptor phosphorylation, we next tested the kinase activity of the β-PDGFR mutants. WT, F857, and F79/81 receptors were immunoprecipitated from resting or PDGF-BB-stimulated cells, and immunoprecipitates representing approximately 3 × 105 cells were subjected to an in vitro kinase assay in the presence of a peptide substrate with a tyrosine residue in a sequence shown to be the optimal phosphorylation site for the β-PDGFR (28Songyang Z. Carraway III, K.L. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Feldman R.A. Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Smith D.P. Eng C. Lorenzo M.J. Ponder B.A.J. Mayer B.J. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). Peptides were separated from the γ-[32P]ATP on cellulose plates by thin layer electrophoresis, and the degree of phosphorylation of the peptides was quantitated using a PhosphorImager. Fig. 3 A shows that the WT receptor immunoprecipitated from PDGF-treated cells phosphorylates the peptide approximately four times better than receptors from resting cells. However, PDGF treatment of cells expressing the F79/81 or F857 receptors did not detectably increase the kinase activity of either receptor toward the peptide substrate. We altered the time of the assay incubation (Fig. 3 C) and the substrate concentration (Fig. 3 D), but neither of these variables improved the activity of the F79/81 or F857 receptors. In addition, increasing the time of exposure of the cells to PDGF prior to precipitation of the receptors did not result in activation of either the F79/81 or the F857 receptors (data not shown). We also tested the activity of the receptor mutants against a GST-PLCγ fusion protein substrate (29Valius M. Secrist J.P. Kazlauskas A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3058-3071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and found WT receptor phosphorylated this substrate approximately six times better following PDGF stimulation. Addition of PDGF to cells expressing the F79/81 and F857 receptors had very little effect on the ability of either receptor to phosphorylate GST-PLCγ (Fig. 3 B). Whereas the kinase activity of the F79/81 and F857 receptors was not increased in response to PDGF, these receptors did show basal tyrosine phosphorylation that was greater than that of the WT receptor (Fig. 1) and basal kinase activity that was comparable with the WT (data not shown). Because the receptors were not catalytically dead we tested whether they could be artificially activated. WT, F79/81, and F857 receptors were immunoprecipitated from resting cells and incubated with 10 μm ATP prior to being assayed for activity against the peptide substrate. Fig. 4 shows that incubation of F79/81 receptor with ATP caused the receptor to become activated to the same extent as the WT receptor. In contrast, the F857 receptor was poorly activated by this treatment. These data indicate that the F79/81 receptor is capable of being artificially activated. Furthermore, the failure of the F857 receptor to be activated by incubation with ATP suggests that the F79/81 receptor kinase is not activated in response to PDGF in vivo because it does not become phosphorylated at tyrosine 857. A method to increase the phosphotyrosine content of proteins in vivo is to treat cells with the nonspecific tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor sodium pervanadate (30Secrist J.P. Burns L.A. Karnitz L. Koretzky G.A. Abraham R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5886-5893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We reasoned that this could be a way to phosphorylate and to potentially activate the F79/81 and F857 receptors in vivo. Cells were treated with sodium pervanadate for 2 min before being lysed, and then the β-PDGFRs were immunoprecipitated, and a portion of the immunoprecipitate representing 1.5 × 106 cells was analyzed for phosphotyrosine content by Western blotting and the blots stripped and reprobed for β-PDGFR. Fig. 5 shows that the WT, F79/81, and F857 receptors all became highly phosphorylated in sodium pervanadate-treated cells (Fig. 5 A). The apparently lower extent of phosphorylation of the F857 receptor with all treatments (Fig. 5 A) was because of a reduced amount of receptor in the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 5 B). Thus pervanadate treatment of cells was able to stimulate robust tyrosine phosphorylation of all the receptors. We next tested the receptors immunoprecipitated from sodium pervanadate-treated cells for kinase activity toward the peptide substrate. Immunoprecipitates representing 3 × 105cells were assayed for activity against the peptide substrate. Fig. 5 C shows that treatment of the cells with sodium pervanadate failed to increase the kinase activity of any of the receptors toward the peptide substrate. These data show that sodium pervanadate treatment of cells does not increase the kinase activity of the receptors toward exogenous substrates, despite extensive tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptors. Given that the phosphorylation of tyrosine 857 appears to be required for activating the receptor's kinase activity toward exogenous substrates it is possible that this tyrosine is inaccessible for phosphorylation when receptors are monomeric. If receptor dimerization was a prerequisite for phosphorylation of Tyr-857, then treating cells with pervanadate and PDGF should activate the F79/81 receptor. To test this possibility, cells were treated for 2 min with sodium pervanadate, and then the medium was removed and replaced with fresh medium containing PDGF for 5 min before cells were lysed and receptors immunoprecipitated. Fig. 5 A shows that this treatment led to highly phosphorylated receptors, in the same way as sodium pervanadate treatment alone. This treatment also increased the kinase activity of the WT receptor to the same extent as PDGF alone (Fig. 5 C), indicating that the phosphorylation of the receptor because of sodium pervanadate treatment does not prevent or enhance activation of the WT receptor kinase following ligand binding. However, pretreatment with sodium pervanadate followed by the addition of PDGF did not give any increase in the kinase activity of the F79/81 or F857 receptors. Fig. 5 C also shows that the kinase-inactive form of the β-PDGFR (R634) became highly tyrosine-phosphorylated following sodium pervanadate treatment. This indicates that a kinase other than the receptor itself is responsible for the phosphorylation seen following sodium pervanadate treatment. In summary, the lack of activation of the F79/81 receptor following pervanadate and PDGF treatment could be because the sites that need to be phosphorylated to achieve an activated kinase are not phosphorylated in the presence of sodium pervanadate. Because the levels of receptor phosphorylation and kinase activity are so profoundly affected by mutation of tyrosines involved in binding Src, it is possible that the defect in the F79/81 is because of a lack of Src association with the β-PDGFR. Previous studies have shown that Src will phosphorylate and activate the receptors for insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 in vitro (31Peterson J.E. Jelinek T. Kalekso M. Siddle K. Weber M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27315-27321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Yu K.-T. Werth D.K. Pastan I.H. Czech M.P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 31562-31571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and Src has been shown to phosphorylate tyrosine 934 of the β-PDGFR both in vitro and in vivo (34Hansen K.

In addition, receptor tyrosine kinases appear to be activated when c-Src is overexpressed or when activated forms of Src are expressed (35Luttrell D.K. Luttrell L.M. Parsons S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 36Wasilenko W.J. Panyne D.M. Fitzgerald D.L. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell.

A. 1995; 92: 6981-6985Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). However, under a variety of in vitro conditions we could not show β-PDGFR receptor tyrosine phosphorylation by Src. 3R. M. Baxter, J. P. Secrist, R. R. Vaillancourt, and A. Kazlauskas, unpublished observations. Although this does not rule out a role for Src acting through intermediates or the possibility that Src phosphorylates the receptor in vivo, our data suggest that the role of tyrosines 579 and 581 in PDGF receptor activation is not a direct effect of receptor phosphorylation by Src. Several groups have shown that phosphorylation at tyrosine 857 is required for full activation of the β-PDGF receptor (6Kazlauskas A. Durden D.L. Cooper J.A.

Based on the crystal structure of the receptors for insulin and fibroblast growth factor, kinase activity is suppressed by an “activation loop,” which sterically blocks the catalytic site (38Hubbard S.R. Wei L. Ellis L. Hendrikson W.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 746-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar, 39Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Cell. 1996; 86: 577-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of one or more tyrosine residues in the activation loop removes the steric hindrance and allows substrates access to the catalytic site. More recent crystals of Src family members have suggested that the activation of the kinase involves movement of α-helix C, which leads to conformational changes that lead to increased kinase activity (40Moarefi I. LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Huse M. Lee C.H. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. Nature. 1997; 385: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 41Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of the activation loop may also be involved in the movement of α-helix C. The crystal structure of the β-PDGFR is yet to be solved, but based on sequence comparisons tyrosine 857 is located in a region homologous to the activation loop seen in other receptors, and a role for this site in receptor activation can be postulated. Consistent with tyrosine 857 being involved in repression of β-PDGFR kinase activity, when the site is mutated to phenylalanine (F857), the basal level of receptor phosphorylation is higher than that see in the wild type receptor (Fig. 1 A). In summary we have shown that the F79/81 receptor is not selectively impaired in binding Src but that it is also deficient in associating with a number of other SH2 domain-containing proteins. The basis for the defect in association with SH2 domain-containing proteins appears to be that the F79/81 receptor fails to become efficiently phosphorylated in response to the binding of PDGF. In addition to the defect in binding-associated proteins, the F79/81 receptor kinase activity was not activated toward exogenous substrates in response to PDGF stimulation. Comparison of the tyrosine phosphorylation and kinase activity of the F79/81 and F857 receptor mutants in response to ligand stimulation leads us to propose a two-step model for the full activation of the PDGF receptor. This model proposes that the two juxtamembrane tyrosines at 579 and 581 are required for receptor autophosphorylation, which is a prerequisite for the later phosphorylation of tyrosine 857, which is necessary for the activation of the receptor kinase activity.

This is derived from kinetic studies done in the absence of Ca2+ or in the presence of EDTA. To test the possibility that the anionic Gla domain of FXa, when not neutralized by Ca2+ ions, prevents heparin binding to FXa, the heparin and pentasaccharide dependence of FXa inactivation by AT in both the absence (100 μm EDTA) and presence of Ca2+ (2.5 mm) was studied using wild-type FXa and a FXa derivative that lacks the Gla domain (GDFXa). AT inactivated both FXa derivatives similarly in both the absence and presence of Ca2+ (k 2 = 1.7–2.5 × 103m−1 s−1). The active AT-binding pentasaccharide also accelerated the inactivation rates of both derivatives similarly in both the absence and presence of Ca2+ (k 2 = 5.7–8.0 × 105m−1 s−1). However, in the presence of an optimum concentration of heparin (∼50 nm) the inactivation rate constant of FXa in the presence of Ca2+ (k 2 = 4.4 × 107m−1 s−1) was 13-fold higher than the rate constant in the absence of Ca2+ (k 2 = 3.5 × 106m−1 s−1). Heparin acceleration of GDFXa inactivation by AT was rapid and insensitive to the presence or absence of Ca2+ (k 2= 5.1–5.9 × 107m−1s−1). The additional cofactor effect of heparin with all FXa derivatives was a bell-shaped curve, which disappeared if the ionic strength of the reaction was increased to ∼0.4.

The consensus view is that heparin accelerates thrombin inactivation by AT by facilitating an initial interaction between the two proteins by a bridging mechanism (4Danielsson A. Raub E. Lindahl U.

In FXa inactivation, however, it is believed that a template mechanism has a minimal role or no role at all in the acceleration and that a heparin-induced conformational change in the reactive site loop of AT accounts for all of the accelerating effect of heparin in the reaction (7Owen B.A. Owen W.G.

These distinct inactivation mechanisms are supported by the observation that a unique pentasaccharide fragment of heparin, which can bind and activate AT but is not long enough to bridge the inhibitor and enzyme, specifically promotes FXa but not thrombin inhibition (9Olson S.T.

For thrombin inhibition, heparin chains containing the pentasaccharide plus at least 13 additional saccharides are required to accelerate the reaction (2Lane D.A. Denton J. Flynn A.M. Thompson E.A.

Under these conditions heparin-catalyzed thrombin inactivation by AT is at least 10–20-fold faster than the inactivation of FXa (9Olson S.T. Björk I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J.

Unlike thrombin, however, FXa contains a highly anionic N-terminal domain, which is rich in γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) residues that are involved in Ca2+-dependent membrane binding. This domain of FXa contains 11 γ-carboxylated Glu residues, which are in a random disordered conformation in the absence of Ca2+ (15Stenflo J. Blood. 1991; 78: 1637-1651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test the possibility that in the absence of Ca2+ the Gla domain of FXa antagonizes heparin binding to FXa and thereby prevents heparin from acting as a template in the FXa-AT reaction, the heparin and pentasaccharide dependence of FXa inactivation by AT was studied in both the absence and presence of Ca2+ using wild-type FXa and a recombinant FXa derivative, which lacks the Gla domain (GDFXa). It was found that in contrast to a similar ∼300-fold cofactor effect of the pentasaccharide in FXa inactivation in both the absence and presence of Ca2+, the cofactor effect of heparin was markedly higher if the reaction was carried out in the presence of Ca2+. The difference in the magnitude of the cofactor effect between heparin and the pentasaccharide was ∼5- and ∼60-fold for FXa in the absence and presence of Ca2+, and ∼89- and ∼74-fold for GDFXa in the absence and presence of Ca2+, respectively. These findings can explain why the anti-FXa activity of heparin exhibits a minimal chain length dependence in ex vivo andin vitro assays but significant chain length dependence inin vivo assays (16Thomas D.P. Merton R.E. Barrowcliffe T.W. Thunberg L. Lindahl U. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1982; 47: 244-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 17Ockelford P.A. Carter C.J. Mitchell L. Hirsh J. Thromb. Res. 1982; 28: 401-409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).RESULTSFig. 1 shows the heparin concentration dependence of FXa inactivation by AT in the presence of either 100 μm EDTA (open circles) or 2.5 mm Ca2+ (closed circles). The heparin concentration dependence of the second-order rate constant (k 2) for FXa inactivation in the presence of EDTA reaches saturation at ∼50 nm heparin (Fig. 1), and further increasing the concentration of heparin does not result in a decline ink 2. The maximal rate constant achieved under these conditions was k 2 = 3.5 ± 0.7 × 106m−1 s−1 (TableI). In the presence 2.5 mmCa2+, the accelerating effect of heparin was significantly increased over that measured in EDTA, and the dependence ofk 2 on heparin concentration was bell-shaped, with an initial increase in k 2 followed by a decrease. The maximal k 2 of 4.4 ± 0.4 × 107m−1 s−1, reached at ∼50–300 nm heparin, was 13-fold higher than that measured in the absence of Ca2+ (Fig. 1 and Table I). At higher heparin concentrations, k 2 decreased such that at ∼20 μm heparin there was essentially no difference between the inactivation rates in the absence or presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 1). Thus, only the additional 13-fold cofactor effect of heparin in the presence of Ca2+ was abolished at high heparin concentration, suggesting that a ternary complex by bridging or template mechanism was responsible for this portion of the cofactor effect of heparin in FXa inactivation.Table IThe second-order inhibition rate constants (k2) for AT inactivation of FXa, GDFXa, and thrombin in the presence or absence of pentasaccharide (PS) or heparinProteaseNo cofactor k 2(103m−1s−1)+PS k 2 (105m−1s−1)+Heparin k 2(106m−1s−1)Template effectEDTACa2+EDTACa2+EDTACa2+EDTACa2+-foldFXa2.0 ± 0.12.5 ± 0.16.7 ± 0.17.3 ± 0.13.5 ± 0.744 ± 45.2 ± 1.160 ± 6GDFXa1.7 ± 0.12.5 ± 0.15.7 ± 0.18.0 ± 0.151 ± 659 ± 1090 ± 1274 ± 13Thrombin6.6 ± 0.66.8 ± 0.50.1 ± 0.010.1 ± 0.0156 ± 861 ± 35600 ± 14006100 ± 900The k 2 values for inactivation of each enzyme in the absence or presence of a saturating concentration of cofactors (1 μm pentasaccharide or 50 nm heparin) were determined in TBS buffer containing 1 mg/ml BSA, 0.1% PEG 8000, and either 100 μm EDTA or 2.5 mm Ca2+ as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The kinetic values are average of at least three independent measurements ± S.D. Open table in a new tab FXa has at least three known Ca2+-binding domains that can influence the magnitude of the heparin cofactor effect in the FXa-AT reaction: the N-terminal Gla domain, the epidermal growth factor-like domain-1 (EGF-1), or the C-terminal catalytic domain (15Stenflo J. Blood. 1991; 78: 1637-1651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21495-21499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine which one of these domains is responsible for the Ca2+-dependent cofactor effect of heparin in the reaction, the inactivation studies were carried out with two FXa derivatives, one lacks the Gla domain (GDFXa) and the other lacks both the Gla and EGF-1 domains (E2FXa). It was previously demonstrated that except for the membrane binding properties, all other enzymatic properties of wild-type FXa are preserved in these two mutants (18Rezaie A.R. Neuenschwander P.F. Morrissey J.H. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8176-8180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike the cofactor effect of heparin in FXa inactivation, which was a bell-shaped curve only in the presence of Ca2+, the accelerating effect of heparin in GDFXa inactivation exhibited a bell-shaped dependence on heparin concentration in both the absence and presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 2). At the optimum heparin concentration (50–300 nm), AT inactivated GDFXa with k 2 = 5.1 ± 0.6 × 107m−1 s−1 andk 2 = 5.9 ± 0.1 × 107m−1 s−1 in the absence and presence of Ca2+, respectively (Table I). The maximal value and heparin concentration dependence of k 2 for E2FXa inactivation were similar to that for GDFXa inactivation (data not shown). These results suggest that Ca2+ occupancy of the EGF-1 domain or the catalytic domain does not alter the cofactor function of heparin in the reaction; rather the anionic Gla domain of FXa when not neutralized by Ca2+ ions interferes with heparin binding to FXa, thereby preventing the bridging effect of heparin in the acceleration of protease inactivation. The Ca2+ concentration dependence of the heparin cofactor effect also correlated well with the Ca2+ occupancy of the Gla domain (optimal at ∼1 mm).Figure 2Heparin concentration dependence of GDFXa inactivation by AT in the absence or presence of Ca2+.GDFXa (0.2 nm) inactivation by AT (5 nm) was monitored at varying concentrations of heparin (0–26 μm) in TBS buffer containing 1 mg/ml BSA and 0.1% PEG 8000 in the presence of either 100 μm EDTA (○) or 2.5 mmCaCl2 (•). The second-order association rate constants were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures” and fitted by Equation 1 (solid lines).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)It has been demonstrated that the activated conformer of AT, whether it is activated by heparin or the pentasaccharide, contributes similarly to the acceleration of protease inhibition (9Olson S.T. Björk I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It may, therefore, be possible to estimate the extent that the template mechanism contributes to the heparin rate enhancements observed with FXa inactivation in the presence of Ca2+. This can be done by dividing the inhibition rate constants determined in the presence of heparin by the rate constants determined in the presence of the pentasaccharide. The ratios of these rate constants in the absence and presence of Ca2+ are shown in the last column of Table I. For comparative purposes, the same values for thrombin inhibition were also determined and presented in the same table. The data of Table I suggest that AT inactivates both FXa and thrombin at comparable rates in the presence of heparin and at a physiologic concentration of Ca2+. The template effect of heparin for GDFXa inactivation in the presence of EDTA is comparable with that in Ca2+within experimental error (74–90-fold) and similar to that for FXa inactivation in the presence of Ca2+. The ascending limbs of the curves represent titration of high affinity AT-heparin (K AT,H) interaction, and the descending limbs represent titration of the low affinity GDFXa-heparin interaction (K FXa,H) (6Streusand V.J. Björk I. Gettins P.G.W. Petitou M. Olson S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9043-9051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The computer fit of thek 2 values to Equation 1 provided aK AT,H value of 7.2 ± 2.4 nmand a K FXa,H value of 2.3 ± 0.7 μm for FXa in the presence of 2.5 mmCa2+. For GDFXa inactivation, similar values of 11.6 ± 2.7 nm for K AT,H and 2.8 ± 0.4 μm for K FXa,H were found in the presence of Ca2+. In this case, lower values of 5.4 ± 2.7 nm for K AT,H and 0.26 ± 0.08 μm for K FXa,Hwere obtained in the presence of EDTA, indicating tighter binding of heparin to GDFXa in the absence of Ca2+.The heparin chain length dependence of FXa inactivation by AT in the presence of Ca2+ was studied using oligosaccharides containing 6, 10, 14, and 18 saccharides and high affinity heparin fragments containing on average 22, 35, 50, and 64 saccharides. The cofactor effect of the 6–18-residue long oligosaccharides and the 22-residue long heparin fragment were all simple saturation curves (up to 50 μm) in both the absence and presence of Ca2+ with only an ∼1.7-fold enhanced cofactor effect for the 18-residue long oligosaccharide and an ∼2.5-fold enhanced cofactor effect for the 22-residue long heparin fragment in the presence of Ca2+. A slight improvement in the reactivity of FXa with AT in the presence of Ca2+ was also observed in the absence of heparin (Table I). The maximal ∼10–13-fold template cofactor effect of heparin displaying a bell-shaped dependence on heparin concentration was observed with any of the 35–64-residue long high affinity heparin fragments used for FXa or GDFXa inactivation (data not shown). The optimal heparin concentration,k 2 values, and the K AT,Hand K FXa,H values for the 50- and 64-residue long heparin fragments were all similar to the values determined for the unfractionated heparin (data not shown).It is known that the bridging effect of heparin on the thrombin-AT reaction is dependent on the ionic strength of buffer, but the cofactor effect, which is mediated by a conformational change in the reactive site loop of AT, is relatively insensitive to the ionic strength as long as AT is saturated with heparin (5Olson S.T. Björk I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6353-6364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the additional cofactor effect of heparin in FXa inactivation in the presence Ca2+ or in GDFXa inactivation in both the absence and presence of Ca2+ decreased as a function of increasing salt concentration such that the differences in the reactivities of FXa derivatives was completely abolished at 0.4 m NaCl (TableII).Table IISalt concentration dependence of the cofactor function of heparin in FXa and GDFXa inactivation by AT in the presence of EDTA or Ca2+[NaCl]FXa k 2(m−1s−1)GDFXa k 2(m−1 s−1)EDTACa2+EDTACa2+m0.103.5 ± 0.7 × 1064.4 ± 0.4 × 1075.1 ± 0.6 × 1075.9 ± 0.1 × 1070.154.6 ± 0.1 × 1062.3 ± 0.1 × 1074.4 ± 0.1 × 1073.0 ± 0.1 × 1070.203.6 ± 0.4 × 1069.7 ± 0.6 × 1062.2 ± 0.2 × 1071.3 ± 0.1 × 1070.252.3 ± 0.4 × 1064.4 ± 0.6 × 1068.0 ± 0.3 × 1066.3 ± 1.0 × 1060.301.4 ± 0.4 × 1062.3 ± 0.3 × 1063.3 ± 0.5 × 1062.5 ± 0.1 × 1060.405.3 ± 0.5 × 1056.3 ± 0.2 × 1057.2 ± 1.5 × 1057.1 ± 1.1 × 105The k 2 values were determined by incubating each FXa derivative (0.2 nm) with AT (5 nm) and optimal concentration of heparin (300 nm) in TBS buffer containing 0.1–0.4 m NaCl, 1 mg/ml BSA, 0.1% PEG 8000, and either 100 μm EDTA or 2.5 mm Ca2+ as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The kinetic values are the average of at least three independent measurements ± S.D. Open table in a new tab DISCUSSIONThe anticoagulant effect of heparin is primarily mediated through the acceleration of the rate of inactivation of coagulation proteases (mainly thrombin and FXa) by AT. It is thought that formation of a heparin-AT-protease ternary complex by a bridging or template mechanism accounts for the bulk of the accelerating effect of heparin in thrombin inactivation (5Olson S.T.

Results of the current study are consistent with these observations only when the heparin-catalyzed AT inactivation of FXa was monitored in the absence of Ca2+, an experimental condition that all other previous studies have used to compare the extent of the cofactor effect of heparin and pentasaccharide in the acceleration of FXa inactivation. In the presence of Ca2+, however, it was found that heparin-catalyzed FXa inactivation was at least 13-fold higher than the inactivation in the absence of Ca2+.FXa belongs to a family of vitamin K-dependent coagulation proteases, which all contain a highly anionic N-terminal Gla domain with several γ-carboxylated glutamic acid (Glu) residues that are involved in Ca2+-dependent membrane binding (22Leytus S.P. Foster D.C. Kurachi K. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5098-5102Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 23Persson E. Hogg P.J. Stenflo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22531-22539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In FXa, this domain contains 11 γ-carboxylated Glu residues, which are in random disordered conformation in the absence of Ca2+ but fold properly to their native conformation in the presence of Ca2+ (15Stenflo J. Blood. 1991; 78: 1637-1651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The observation that the accelerating effect of heparin in FXa inactivation in the presence of Ca2+ and in GDFXa inactivation in both the presence and absence of Ca2+ was ∼13–15-fold higher than FXa inactivation in the absence of Ca2+ suggests that the anionic Gla domain prevents the binding of heparin to FXa and thereby the formation of a ternary bridging complex. The Gla domain can interfere with heparin binding to FXa in the absence of Ca2+ by either folding on itself and masking the positively charged residues of the heparin binding site and/or simply by creating a highly electronegative molecule preventing the approach of heparin by repulsive interactions. The interference of an unfolded Gla domain with heparin binding in the absence of Ca2+ may be a universal phenomenon occurring in other vitamin K-dependent Gla-containing coagulation proteases, because in a recent study it was also noticed that heparin dramatically accelerates protein C activation by thrombin and FXa in the presence but not in the absence of Ca2+ (24Rezaie A.R. Blood. 1998; 91: 4572-4580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of Ca2+, however, heparin accelerated the activation of the Gla-domainless protein C by thrombin, suggesting that similar to FXa, the Gla domain of protein C when not stabilized by Ca2+ ions interferes with the cofactor function of heparin in the activation reaction. The existence of a heparin-binding site in FXa and protein C homologous to that in thrombin is suggested by the conservation of the basic site of thrombin in FXa and activated protein C (25Padmanabhan K. Padmanabhan K.P. Tulinsky A. Park C.H. Bode W. Huber R. Blankenship D.T. Cardin A.D. Kisiel W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 947-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 26Mather T. Oganessyan V. Hof P. Huber R. Foundling S. Esmon C. Bode W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6822-6831Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the observed affinity of FXa for heparin in the presence of Ca2+ is comparable with that measured for thrombin, albeit in the absence of Ca2+ (27Olson S.T. Halvorson H.R. Björk I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6342-6352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).This is the first study to show that the cofactor effect of heparin in FXa inactivation by AT at physiologic Ca2+ exceeds the cofactor effect of heparin in thrombin inactivation and that this effect is mediated by a combination of an ∼300-fold enhancement by the pentasaccharide-induced conformational change in the reactive site loop of AT and an ∼60-fold enhancement by a template mechanism. The results of this study further suggest that heparin fragments of 18 saccharides long are required to observe a template effect for heparin in FXa inactivation in the presence of Ca2+, similar to the chain length requirement in thrombin inactivation. Low molecular weight heparins (M r = 4000–6000) are used as antithrombotic agents, and a number of studies suggest that the antithrombotic effect of these types of heparins can be accounted for primarily by their anti-FXa activity, because oligosaccharides less than 18 residues long that are devoid of anti-thrombin activity still exhibit significant antithrombotic activity (28Barrowcliffe T.W. Lane D.L. Lindahl U. Heparin and Related Polysaccharides. Plenum Press, New York1992: 205-220Google Scholar). Relative to unfractionated heparin, however, these oligosaccharide fragments show less antithrombotic activity despite the existence of a comparableex vivo and in vitro anti-FXa activity for both types of heparins (17Ockelford P.A. Carter C.J. Mitchell L. Hirsh J. Thromb. Res. 1982; 28: 401-409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Based on the oligosaccharide chain length dependence of the antithrombotic effect it has been concluded that in addition to the anti-FXa activity, the longer chain heparins in low molecular weight preparations also provide an additional anti-thrombin activity. Results of the current study now suggest that the reduced antithrombotic effect of low molecular weight heparins may be accounted for solely by their anti-FXa activity, because this activity is expected to show a chain length dependence in the presence of Ca2+ like that of thrombin. Because all current in vitro assays measure the anti-FXa activity of heparin in the absence of Ca2+, they would miss this additional chain length-dependent cofactor effect of heparin in FXa inactivation.

This assignment was confirmed using a mutant rP1R (rP1R-M63I) that yielded, upon photoligand binding and CNBr digestion, a broad protein band of ≈46 kDa, which was reduced to a sharp band of ≈20 kDa upon deglycosylation. CNBr digestion of complexes formed with two additional rP1R double mutants (rP1R-M63I/L40M and rP1R-M63I/L41M) yielded non-glycosylated protein bands that were ≈6 kDa in size, indicating that [Bpa23]PTHrP cross-links to amino acids 23–40 of the rP1R.

In preliminary experiments, COS-7 cells that were grown and transfected in 24-well plates were rinsed twice with 1 ml of cold binding buffer, and the cell monolayer was then incubated for 6 h at 4 °C with125I-[Bpa23]PTHrP (1 × 106cpm) diluted in 0.5 ml of binding buffer with or without unlabeled ligand (10−6m bNlePTH or [Bpa23]PTHrP). After incubation, cells were rinsed three times with 1 ml of cold binding buffer before adding 200 μl of binding buffer and placing the dishes on ice under a UV light source for 20 min (Blak Ray long-wave lamp; 366 nm, 7000 microwatts/cm2; UV Products, San Gabriel, CA; source-to-cell distance of ≈5 cm). After photolysis, cells were rinsed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline, twice with a cold acidic buffer (0.05 m glycine and 0.15 m NaCl (pH 2.5)) to remove noncovalently bound radioligand, and twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline before solubilization with 0.5 ml of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (4% (w/v) SDS, 80 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.2% bromphenol blue, and 100 mm dithiothreitol). The lysate was then passed six times through a 19-gauge needle to shear genomic DNA. To prepare larger amounts of the cross-linked ligand-receptor complex, a similar protocol was followed using COS-7 cells that were grown and transfected in 150-mm dishes. For each rinsing step, 30 ml of cold binding buffer were used, and incubation with125I-[Bpa23]PTHrP (2–4 × 107 cpm) was performed in a final volume of 20 ml of binding buffer. During UV light exposure, the cell monolayer was covered with 10 ml of binding buffer, and after photolysis and rinsing, cells were solubilized with 4 ml of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. After heating to 70 °C, samples (and appropriate size markers) were either subjected to analytical SDS-PAGE analysis (5–20% acrylamide, 0.75-mm spacers) according to the method of Laemmli (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) or loaded onto a 16.5% (w/v) Tricine gel (0.75-mm spacers) according to the method of Schägger and von Jagow (28Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar), with subsequent autoradiography of the dried gels (1–14 days at −80 °C with intensifying screens). To isolate larger amounts of radiolabeled ligand-receptor complexes from cells cultured in 150-mm dishes, we used preparative SDS-polyacrylamide gels (5–20% acrylamide, 3-mm spacers); the complexes were identified by autoradiography of the wet gels (exposure time of 4–12 h at room temperature) and electroeluted from an excised gel slice using a Model 422 electroeluter (Bio-Rad). The isolated radiolabeled ligand-receptor complex was stored at −20 °C in elution buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 0.02% SDS) before chemical/enzymatic treatment (see below). CNBr was dissolved in 100% trifluoroacetic acid and then added to the partially purified radiolabeled ligand-receptor complex to give a final concentration of 100 mm CNBr in 70% trifluoroacetic acid. After an overnight, light-protected incubation, the digest was reduced in volume under a stream of nitrogen and then repeatedly lyophilized to remove trifluoroacetic acid and CNBr. Once the apparent molecular mass of each CNBr-derived ligand-receptor fragment had been established, trifluoroacetic acid and CNBr were eliminated more efficiently by ultrafiltration using a Microcon 3 concentrator (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA) and repeated dilution of the retentate with H2O. The CNBr-cleaved and concentrated radioligand-receptor complex was treated with peptideN-glycosidase F (2500 units) for 1 h at 37 °C in 30 μl of 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), 0.5% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, and 1% Nonidet P-40 according to the protocol provided by the supplier. [Bpa23]PTHrP was tested in competition binding studies performed with COS-7 cells expressing the native rP1R and was found to have an apparent binding affinity that is indistinguishable from that of bNlePTH and of other analogs of PTH and PTHrP (7Gardella T.J.

The Bpa-containing PTHrP analog was also fully functional in cAMP accumulation assays and exhibited a potency that was indistinguishable from that of bNlePTH (data not shown). After binding and photoactivation, the covalent complex formed between radioiodinated [Bpa23]PTHrP and the rP1R was visualized by analytical SDS-PAGE and subsequent autoradiography. The complex migrated as a single broad band corresponding to a glycosylated protein with a molecular mass of ≈80 kDa (Fig. 1, lane 1). This size of the ligand-receptor complex is comparable to that previously seen with other photoreactive PTH or PTHrP analogs using either cells expressing endogenous PTH/PTHrP receptors (29Shigeno C.

Coincubation of transfected COS-7 cells with 125I-[Bpa23]PTHrP and unlabeled bPTH-(1–34) (10−6m) or unlabeled [Bpa23]PTHrP (10−6m) completely eliminated the formation of the radiolabeled ligand-receptor complex (data not shown). To identify the region of the P1R that interacted with the Bpa23 moiety, we isolated larger amounts of the radiolabeled ligand-receptor complex using preparative SDS-PAGE, cleaved the partially purified complex with CNBr, and separated the cleavage products on analytical gels. After CNBr cleavage, most of the radioactivity migrated on SDS-PAGE as a single sharp protein band corresponding to a size of <14 kDa (Fig. 1, lane 2). A minor fraction migrated as a diffuse band at the 46-kDa size marker and probably corresponded to a partially cleaved glycosylated ligand-receptor complex. Tricine/SDS-PAGE analysis was used to achieve higher resolution in the low molecular mass range, and this suggested a molecular size of ≈9 kDa for the principal radiolabeled CNBr-generated fragment (see also Fig. 5, lane 1). Since [Bpa23]PTHrP has a molecular size of 4.286 kDa, the receptor fragment contributing to the complex was estimated to have a molecular size of ≈5 kDa. The same results were obtained when analyzing the complex formed between radiolabeled [Bpa23]PTHrP and the endogenous PTH/PTHrP receptor of ROS 17/2.8 cells (data not shown). The above results suggested that Bpa at position 23 of PTHrP interacts with an ≈5-kDa non-glycosylated CNBr-generated portion of the receptor. Inspection of the amino acid sequence of the rP1R showed that several fragments delimited by methionine residues are within this molecular size range (Fig. 2). Because of the predicted overall architecture of ligand-receptor interaction (1Segre G.V. Bilezikian J.P. Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A. Principles in Bone Biology.

Egelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4942) Google Scholar). A mutant rP1R was generated, rP1R-M63I, in which methionine at position 63 was replaced by isoleucine (Fig. 3 B); this mutant receptor had functional (data not shown) and cross-linking (Fig. 1, lane 3) properties that were indistinguishable from the wild-type rP1R. CNBr cleavage of the covalently labeled rP1R-M63I mutant yielded to a broad radioactive band comigrating with the 46-kDa marker (Fig. 1, lane 4, and Fig. 4, lane 1); this cleavage product was reduced to a sharp protein band of <20 kDa upon further digestion with peptide N-glycosidase F (Fig. 4,lane 2). The increase in size from ≈9 to ≈46 kDa of the CNBr-derived ligand-receptor complex that occurred as a result of the M63I mutation and the subsequent size reduction of this larger receptor fragment upon deglycosylation indicated that, in the mutant receptor, Bpa23 interacts with a receptor segment that extends from the amino-terminus to Met174. These results confirmed that cross-linking of [Bpa23]PTHrP to the wild-type P1R occurred between Met63 and the receptor's amino-terminal residue.Figure 3Schematic drawing of the amino-terminus of the wild-type rat PTH/PTHrP receptor and two receptor mutants.

As described under “Experimental Procedures,” the partially purified, CNBr-cleaved radioligand-receptor complex (lane 1) was digested with peptide N-glycosidase F (lane 2). Samples were analyzed by Tricine/SDS-PAGE with subsequent autoradiography (14 days at −80 °C). The positions of different size markers are indicated in kilodaltons.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To further define the site of cross-linking, we introduced methionine substitutions at either Leu40 or Leu41 in the rP1R-M63I mutant to yield the double mutants rP1R-M63I/L40M and rP1R-M63I/L41M, respectively (Fig. 3 C). Like rP1R M63I, these two mutants had biological properties that were indistinguishable from those of the wild-type rP1R (data not shown). Leu40 and Leu41 were chosen because their substitution with methionine is a conservative replacement and because CNBr cleavage at these positions would yield ligand-receptor conjugates whose size upon SDS-PAGE analysis would easily distinguish between the two possible sites of interaction with [Bpa23]PTHrP. Thus, cross-linking to a site amino-terminal of Met40 or Met41 would yield non-glycosylated, low molecular mass complexes corresponding to receptor residues 23–40 and 23–41, respectively, whereas cross-linking to a site carboxyl-terminal of either mutation would yield glycosylated, high molecular mass complexes corresponding to residues 41–174 and 42–174, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5 (lane 3), CNBr cleavage of the affinity-labeledM63I/L40M mutant yielded a small radiolabeled, non-glycosylated complex of ≈6 kDa, as did cleavage of the M63I/L41M mutant (data not shown). This indicated that the covalent interaction between Bpa23 and the rP1R occurred between the receptor's amino-terminus and Leu40. The amino-terminal receptor fragment identified by the above physicochemical approach overlaps a P1R region previously shown by functional studies to be important for ligand binding (24Lee C. Gardella T.J. Abou-Samra A.B. Nussbaum S.R. Segre G.V. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H.M. Jüppner H. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1488-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Two mutant receptors with deletions of residues 26–60 (the E1 region) or 31–47 (E1a) were shown to have only moderately reduced receptor expression levels in COS-7 cells (22 ± 1 and 36 ± 3% of the wild type, respectively) and little or no capacity to bind radiolabeled PTH (24Lee C. Gardella T.J. Abou-Samra A.B. Nussbaum S.R. Segre G.V. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H.M. Jüppner H. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1488-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To further examine the functional importance of residues in this amino-terminal E1a region, we first made four cassette mutant receptors, termed E1a-1 through E1a-4, in which four or five adjacent residues were replaced by either alanine or valine (Fig. 6, A and B). Each mutant receptor was adequately expressed on the surface of COS-7 cells (>35% of the wild-type) (Fig. 6 C). The two mutants in which residues 31–35 and 36–39 were altered displayed diminished125I-rNlePTH binding capacity, whereas the two mutants with substitutions of residues 40–43 and 44–47, respectively, maintained high levels of PTH binding (Fig. 6 D). To further localize candidate binding residues within region 31–39 (E1a-1 and E1a-2), an alanine-scanning approach was used. Several of the individual alanine substitutions in this region, which had little or no effect on cell surface expression (Fig. 7 A), resulted in small reductions in 125I-rNlePTH binding capacity (Fig. 7 B). A reduction in PTH binding of >25% occurred with two substitutions, T33A and Q37A (Fig. 7 B). In addition, each of these two point mutations had a more severe effect on125I-PTHrP binding than on 125I-rNlePTH binding (Fig. 7 C). In competition binding studies with125I-rNlePTH as tracer radioligand, the apparent binding affinity of rNlePTH for wild-type and mutant P1Rs was comparable (Fig. 8 A). The apparent binding affinity of bNlePTH for the T33A and Q37A mutant receptors was 5.0- and 2.3-fold weaker, respectively, than it was for the wild-type receptor (Fig. 8 B). Consistent with the reduced maximal binding of radiolabeled PTHrP, the apparent binding affinity of PTHrP-(1–36) for these two mutant receptors was 14- and 48-fold weaker, respectively, than it was for the wild-type receptor (Fig. 8 C). Both receptor mutations also abolished binding of an amino-terminally truncated PTHrP analog, [Leu11,d-Trp12]PTHrP-(7–34)-amide, indicating that Thr33 and Gln37 affect interactions with region 7–34 of the ligand rather than with region 1–6 (Fig. 8 D and TableI).Figure 8Effects of alanine substitution of Thr33 or Gln37 in the PTH/PTHrP receptor on ligand binding. The rP1R (wild type (WT); •) and the T33A (▵) and Q37A (▪) mutants were expressed in COS-7 cells and evaluated for binding PTH or PTHrP analogs. Competition binding analyses were performed using125I-[Nle8,21,Tyr34]rPTH-(1–34)-NH2as a tracer radioligand and [Nle8,21,Tyr34]rPTH-(1–34)-NH2(A), [Nle8,18,Tyr34]bPTH-(1–34)-NH2(B), [Tyr36]hPTHrP-(1–36)-NH2(C), or [Leu11,d-Trp12]hPTHrP-(7–34)-NH2(D) as an unlabeled competitor ligand.

Previous studies have suggested that the amino-terminal extracellular region of the PTH/PTHrP receptor interacts with carboxyl-terminal region 15–34 of either PTH or PTHrP; a similar architecture of ligand-receptor interaction may well apply to other members of this family of G protein-coupled receptors (9Turner P.R.

In this study, we confirmed and extended these predictions for the P1R with a PTHrP analog containing photoreactive Bpa at position 23, a residue with apparent functional significance based on its ability to determine ligand binding specificity in the P2R (7Gardella T.J.

After CNBr digestion of [Bpa23]PTHrP·P1R complexes, an ≈9-kDa radiolabeled protein was detected upon Tricine/SDS-PAGE analysis. This fragment was likely to represent 125I-[Bpa23]PTHrP covalently coupled to a receptor fragment extending from Tyr23, the first residue after the predicted cleavage site for the signal peptide (33Nielsen H. Egelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4942) Google Scholar), to Met63, the first methionine in the mature receptor sequence. We confirmed this assignment and refined the mapping further by using site-directed mutagenesis to introduce or remove methionines at strategic sites in the receptor. First, the rP1R- M63I mutant was generated and shown to be fully functional. When the ligand-receptor complex formed with this receptor was cleaved with CNBr, the ≈9-kDa band was replaced by an ≈46-kDa glycosylated band corresponding to the receptor fragment extending from the amino-terminus to Met174. This receptor segment contains three of the four potential N-linked glycosylation sites, and glycosylation is consistent with the broadness of the ≈46-kDa complex on SDS-PAGE and its reduction to a smaller, non-glycosylated protein band by peptide N-glycosidase F treatment. These results confirmed that cross-linking between BPA23 and the rat PTH/PTHrP receptor involved residues that are located between the amino-terminus and Met63. The M63I mutation allowed us to exclude other CNBr-derived receptor fragments of similar size, such as Ala426–Met450. Two additional, fully functional receptor double mutants, rP1R-M63I/L40M and rP1R-M63I/L41M, were prepared to further refine the cross-linking site. Both mutants contained the M63I mutation to eliminate the natural CNBr cleavage site at position 63. CNBr cleavage of the complexes formed between 125I-[Bpa23]PTHrP and either of these two mutant receptors resulted in low molecular mass radiolabeled protein conjugates (Fig. 5). This result established that Bpa23 cross-linked to a side amino-terminal to Met41 in the rP1R and clearly excluded segment 41–174 as the site of interaction. Earlier mutagenesis studies had indicated that deletion of a portion of the rP1R that included 17 residues (the E1a region) close to the amino-terminus of the mature receptor abolished binding of radiolabeled PTH or PTHrP, with only moderate effects on receptor expression (24Lee C. Gardella T.J. Abou-Samra A.B. Nussbaum S.R. Segre G.V. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H.M. Jüppner H. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1488-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To further map functional binding residues in this region, we constructed four “cassette” mutants in which four or five adjacent amino acids were replaced by alanine or valine. Two of these cassette mutants, E1a-1 and E1a-2, showed normal cell-surface expression, but little or no binding of radiolabeled PTH or PTHrP. These results suggested that residues within segments 31–35 and 36–39 contribute to ligand interaction. The replacement of each of these nine residues with individual alanine substitutions confirmed this hypothesis. Two mutants, rP1R T33A and rP1R Q37A, exhibited the weakest capacity to bind the radioligand. Interestingly, the effects of these mutations on ligand binding were more pronounced with PTHrP than with PTH; this pattern might be attributable to the divergence in region 15–34 of these two ligands, a hypothesis supported by the observation that the mutations also impaired PTHrP-(7–34) binding. In summary, our physicochemical observations indicate that Bpa23 (and presumably Phe23 in the native PTHrP molecule) interacts with residues at the extreme amino-terminus of the PTH/PTHrP receptor. Mutational analysis of this receptor region supported this conclusion and identified two amino acid residues, Thr33 and Gln37, as possible sites for ligand interaction. The combined use of the two techniques, photoaffinity cross-linking and receptor mutagenesis, should enable the definition of other receptor segments that comprise contact points for PTH and PTHrP.

https://openalex.org/W2038857470,"To identify factors involved in the expression of ligand-gated ion channels, we expressed nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in HEK cells to characterize roles for oligosaccharide trimming, calnexin association, and targeting to the proteasome. The homologous subunits of the acetylcholine receptor traverse the membrane four times, contain at least one oligosaccharide, and are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum until completely assembled into the circular arrangement of subunits of δ-α-γ-α-β to enclose the ion channel. We previously demonstrated that calnexin is associated with unassembled subunits of the receptor, but appears to dissociate when subunits are assembled in various combinations. We used the glucosidase inhibitor castanospermine to block oligosaccharide processing, and thereby inhibit calnexin's interaction with the oligosaccharides in the receptor subunits. Castanospermine treatment reduces the association of calnexin with the α-subunit of the receptor, and diminishes the intracellular accumulation of unassembled receptor subunit protein. However, treatment with castanospermine does not appear to alter subunit folding or assembly. In contrast, co-treatment with proteasome inhibitors and castanospermine enhances the accumulation of polyubiquitin-conjugated α-subunits, and generally reverses the castanospermine induced loss of α-subunit protein. Co-transfection of cDNAs encoding the α- and δ-subunits, which leads to the expression of assembled α- and δ- subunits, also inhibits the loss of α-subunits expressed in the presence of castanospermine. Taken together, these observations indicate that calnexin association reduces the degradation of unassembled receptor subunits in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.

The endoplasmic reticulum localized protein, calnexin, is associated with unassembled subunits of the acetylcholine receptor (15Gelman M.S. Chang W. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Prives J.M. J. Biol.

Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22871-22877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Connolly et al. (18Connolly C.N. Krishek B.J. McDonald B.J. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 89-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) demonstrated that calnexin is associated with subunits of the GABAA receptor, indicating that calnexin association might be involved in the biogenesis of other multisubunit ion channels. Numerous investigations have established that calnexin associates primarily with monoglucosylated oligosaccharides, which are intermediates in the processing of nascent oligosaccharides or products of reglucosylation by the enzyme UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase, and that treatment with the glucosidase inhibitor castanospermine can disrupt the interaction (reviewed in Refs. 19Helenius A. Trombetta E.S. Herbert D.N. Simons J.F. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 193-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar and 20Van Leeuwen J.E. Kearse K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4179-4186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Using transient expression of acetylcholine receptor subunits in HEK cells, we find a role for calnexin association in reducing degradation of unassembled subunits by the proteasome, since treatment with castanospermine reduces the subunit-calnexin association and increases the polyubiquitination of the α-subunit. Additionally, co-treatment with proteasome inhibitors blocks the degradation. Although unassembled α-subunits are degraded at a rapid rate (5Merlie J.P. Lindstrom J. Cell. 1983; 34: 747-757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), treatment with glucosidase inhibitors substantially promotes degradation (4Smith M.M. Schlesinger S. Lindstrom J. Merlie J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14825-14832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our data also indicate that castanospermine treatment does not cause the α-subunit to misfold, as detected by a conformationally sensitive antibody. Therefore, increased degradation by the proteasome appears to be independent of the nascent peptide undergoing misfolding in this system. In contrast, a recent study indicated that treatment of chick myotubes with castanospermine disrupts α-subunit folding and assembly (17Chang W. Gelman M.S. Prives J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28925-28932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Our data also indicate that calreticulin and ERp57, the two other proteins known to have glycoprotein-associating properties similar to calnexin (19Helenius A. Trombetta E.S. Herbert D.N. Simons J.F. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 193-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 21Elliot J.G. Oliver J.D. High S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13849-13855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), do not appear to be bound to the α-subunit. Assembly with the δ-subunit reduces the degradation of the α-subunit when α- and δ-subunits are co-expressed in the presence of castanospermine, indicating that glucose trimming, calnexin association, assembly and entrance into the proteasome are linked in the expression of the receptor. Connections among these phenomena are also likely to be critical to the fidelity of expression of other multisubunit glycoproteins. Castanospermine (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) was solubilized in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at a concentration of 100 μg/ml, and immediately added to 10-cm plates of cells. Cells were treated with castanospermine 2 h prior to transfection, transfected with receptor subunit cDNAs, allowed to grow for 16 h, or replenished with fresh castanospermine in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and raised for another 24 h. Transfections employed the calcium phosphate precipitation method, as described in Keller et al. (16Keller S.H. Lindstrom J. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22871-22877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Generally, 15 μg of plasmid DNA encoding each receptor subunit were added to plates of cells, unless noted otherwise. In transfections where α- to δ-subunit ratios were varied, α-subunit cDNA was transfected at 15 μg of plasmid DNA/plate, and the mass of plasmid DNA encoding the δ-subunit was varied (Figs. 5 and 6).Figure 6The influence of castanospermine on the accumulation of α-δ subunit dimers depends on the transfection ratios of plasmid DNAs encoding the α- and δ-subunits. The transfected α:δ-subunit ratios refer to the masses of plasmid DNAs present in the transfection mixture, where the amount of plasmid DNA encoding the α-subunit is kept constant at 15 μg of DNA/plate and plasmid DNA encoding for the δ-subunit is varied. A,lanes 1 and 2 display samples transfected at a 8:1 ratio and lanes 3and 4 display samples transfected at a 3:1 ratio of plasmid DNAs encoding the α- and δ-subunits. The numbers of cells, antibody dilutions for immunoprecipitations, and volumes loaded in each lane were the same among samples, and consisted of approximately 5% of the total sample. The Western blot was developed first with mAb 210 to detect the α-subunit and then reprobed with mAb 137 to detect the δ-subunit, and the exposures on films were overlaid to show α- and δ-subunits together. The δ-subunits displayed in the Western blot are assembled with α-subunits, since the immunoprecipitating antibody recognized the α-subunit (mAb 61). B, Western blot revealing assembled δ-subunits from a similar experiment as displayed inA, developed with mAb 137.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In experiments involving immunoprecipitations with antibodies to calnexin, calreticulin, ERp57, and the receptor subunits, the solubilization buffer consisted of 0.5% CHAPS, 1The abbreviations used are: CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate; Bgt, bungarotoxin; CST, castanospermine; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; HEK, human embryonic kidney; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; LAC, lactacystin; Z-LLF-CHO, benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-phenylalaninal; mAb, monoclonal antibody. 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, and the protease inhibitors: benzamidine, aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A. The characteristics of the antibodies used for these immunoprecipitations, mAb 35 or mAb 61 to precipitate the α-subunit, mAb 111 to precipitate the β-subunit and mAb 137 to precipitate the δ-subunit, were described previously (22Tzartos S.J. Rand D.E. Einarson B.L. Lindstrom J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8635-8645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Anticalnexin, antipolyubiquitin, and anti-calreticulin were purchased from Stressgen (British Columbia, Canada). Solubilization of cells and immunoprecipitations using anti-polyubiquitin were in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.4% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, N-ethylmaleimide, and the other protease inhibitors listed above. The ratio of solubilization buffer volume relative to the number of cell plates were the same for each sample within an experiment. Following solubilization, samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min. Dilution ratios for antibody in all immunoprecipitations were approximately 1:100. Equivalent volumes of immunoprecipitated samples, consisting of approximately 5% of the total immunoprecipitated material, were loaded in each gel lane. All samples were resolved on 10% Novex gels (San Diego, CA) and transferred to nitrocellulose for Western blot detection. The antibodies used to detect the receptor subunits were mAb 210 for α, mAb 111 for β, and mAb 137 for δ. The antibody to ERp57 was a gift from Dr. Jordan Holtzman (University of Minnesota). Calreticulin was detected on Western blots with the same antibody used in immunoprecipitations. All primary antibodies were diluted 1:1000 to probe Western blots, which were developed by chemiluminescent techniques (Pierce). Immunoprecipitation and Western blot experiments were replicated usually three or more times. Proteasome inhibitors were solubilized in Me2SO and added 3 h after transfection. Equivalent concentrations of Me2SO were added to untreated cells. The final concentration of Me2SO in a plate of cells was at most 0.3%. Cells were grown for an additional 16 h and then solubilized. The proteasome inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-phenylalaninal (Z-LLF-CHO) was obtained from Dr. F. Mercurio (Signal Pharmaceuticals, San Diego, CA) and used at a final concentration of 20 μm. MG-132 (carbobenzoxyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-leucinal) and lactacystin were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA) and used at 50 and 10 μm, respectively. Calpain inhibitor I (N-Ac-Leu-Leu-norleucinal; Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) was used at final concentration of 100 μm. The snake toxin α-bungarotoxin (α-Bgt) binds to both unassembled and assembled α-subunits, whereas carbamoylcholine recognizes only α-subunits assembled with γ-, δ-, or ε-subunits (10Blount P. Merlie J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1072-1080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transfected and untransfected cells were permeabilized in a 0.1% saponin buffer (11Kreienkamp H-J. Maeda R.K. Sine S. Taylor P. Neuron. 1995; 14: 635-644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), exposed to an excess of125I-α-bungarotoxin (125I-α-Bgt) for 3 h, washed, and γ-radiation was counted. The binding of125I-α-Bgt to untransfected cells was subtracted from its binding to transfected cells. Data were standardized to the average of125I-α-Bgt bound to cells untreated with castanospermine. Bands on Western blots were scanned with Deskscan (Hewlett Packard) and integrated with the program Collage (Fotodyne, New Berlin, WI). Cells were treated with the glucosidase inhibitor castanospermine, to identify roles for glucose trimming in the biogenesis of acetylcholine receptors expressed in HEK cells. Treatment with castanospermine, prior to and during the transfection period, inhibits the glucosidase I and glucosidase II enzymes, leaving oligosaccharides capped with three glucose residues. Castanospermine treatment, therefore, maintains larger sized oligosaccharides which are attached to glycoproteins confined to the endoplasmic reticulum. Since unassembled receptor subunits and α-δ dimers are retained intracellularly (23Saedi M.S. Conroy W.G. Lindstrom J.M. J. Cell. Biol. 1991; 112: 1007-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 24Sine S.M. Claudio T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19369-19377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), treatment with castanospermine should maintain larger oligosaccharides attached to the receptor subunits. A side reaction, which may result from a residual fraction of glucosidase enzymes remaining active, is that, nascent oligosaccharide chains whose glucosyl residues have been trimmed, in turn, become reglucosylated by UDP-glucose:glycoprotein-dependent glucosyltransferase. Reglucosylated receptor subunits may accumulate transiently because most glucosidase enzymes are inhibited (20Van Leeuwen J.E. Kearse K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4179-4186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Cells were untreated or treated with castanospermine prior to transfection with cDNAs encoding the α-, β-, or δ-subunits. Following detergent solubilization, receptor protein was immunoprecipitated, resolved on gels, transferred to nitrocellulose and detected with appropriate antibodies. The Western blot in Fig. 1 A demonstrates that castanospermine decreases the migration in gels of the α- (comparelanes 1 to 2), β- (lanes 3 to4), and δ-subunits (lanes 5 and 6), indicating untrimmed oligosaccharides predominate. The δ-subunit often appears as a doublet when resolved toward the bottom of a gel, which is presumably due to partial phosphorylation. Similarly, the α-subunit often appears as a doublet, with a faint unglycosylated lower molecular weight band and a more abundant higher molecular weight protein, which is glycosylated (25Blount P. Merlie J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2613-2622Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). γ-Subunits were not included in these experiments due to the unavailability of the appropriate antibodies. The banding densities in Western blots of α-, β-, and δ-subunits are significantly diminished when expressed in castanospermine (Fig. 1 A), indicating that the intracellular accumulations of these unassembled subunits are reduced. Although treatment with castanospermine at 100 μg/ml diminishes the accumulation of receptor protein, and presumably other glycoproteins, it does not influence the accumulation of most cellular proteins detected with a general stain or antibody (Fig. 1 B). To establish this, untransfected cells were treated or untreated with castanospermine, and grown in a similar manner to transfected cells. Cells were harvested, washed 3 × in phosphate-buffered saline, and solubilized in the 0.5% CHAPS buffer as described earlier. Samples were resolved in gels, which were then stained with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1 and2). Other samples were resolved in gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and exposed to an excess of anti-rat IgG-conjugated peroxidase to detect cellular proteins nonspecifically (Fig. 1 B, lanes 3 and 4). Proteins of similar banding densities align in the gels (Fig. 1 B), indicating that the loss of acetylcholine receptor protein observed in Fig. 1 A, is not due to a general reduction in protein synthesis caused by castanospermine treatment. To identify mechanisms which regulate receptor subunit degradation, experiments were designed to ascertain whether treatment with castanospermine increases conjugation of polyubiquitin to α-subunits. Cells were treated or untreated with castanospermine, transfected with cDNA encoding the α-subunit, and maintained in the presence of proteasome inhibitors: calpain inhibitor I and benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-phenylalaninal (Z-LLF-CHO; 26Vinitsky A.C. Michaud C. Powers J.C. Orlowski M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9421-9428Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Calpain inhibitor I and Z-LLF-CHO were used in this experiment, because other investigations have demonstrated their efficacy for detecting the conjugation of polyubiquitin chains to proteins (27DiDonato J.A. Mercurio F. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1302-1311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28DiDonato J., A. Mercurio F. Caridad R. Wu-li J. Suyang H. Ghosh S. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Detergent extracts were immunoprecipitated with an antibody to polyubiquitin, and Western blots were developed with mAb 210 to detect α-subunits (Fig. 2). The appearance of a characteristic ladder pattern near the top of the gel indicates that the proteins are polyubiquitinated (27DiDonato J.A. Mercurio F. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1302-1311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28DiDonato J., A. Mercurio F. Caridad R. Wu-li J. Suyang H. Ghosh S. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar, 30Yeung S.J. Chen S.H. Chan L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13843-13848Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). A high molecular weight ladder pattern is observed when α-subunits are expressed in the presence of castanospermine (Fig. 2 A, lane 2), indicating that the α-subunits become polyubiquitinated. In comparison, α-subunits expressed in the absence of castanospermine are also polyubiquitinated, but the high molecular weight ladder pattern is fainter (Fig. 2 A, compare lanes 1 and2). The high molecular weight pattern is absent when Z-LLF-CHO is omitted in the experiment (Fig. 2 B); this finding indicates that treatment with Z-LLF-CHO inhibits the degradation of polyubiquitinated α-subunits in the proteasome, thereby allowing the conjugated intermediates to accumulate. Treatment with calpain inhibitor I alone does not lead to the detection of polyubiquitinated α-subunits. In other experiments with proteasome inhibitors, treatment with 50 μm MG-132 resulted in the detection of a distinct, but fainter high molecular weight ladder pattern compared with that observed with Z-LLF-CHO treatment; the density of the high molecular weight ladder pattern was also enhanced when cells were treated with castanospermine (data not shown). To further characterize the mechanisms of degradation, cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitors lactacystin or MG-132, to examine whether degradation of α-subunits is reduced. Lactacystin is a irreversible inhibitor which binds specifically to the proteasome, as demonstrated by affinity labeling and peptide sequencing (31Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1504) Google Scholar). MG-132 is a congener of Z-LLF-CHO, also a peptide-aldehyde that blocks the proteolytic activities of the proteasome (32Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27280-27284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Cells were treated or untreated with castanospermine, transfected with the same plasmid DNA transfection mixture in all plates, and then treated or untreated with a proteasome inhibitor. Following an incubation period, cells were solubilized, and α-subunits were immunoprecipitated and detected on Western blots. As displayed in Fig. 3, lanes 3and 4, and in previous experiments, treatment with castanospermine results in a loss of α-subunit protein; however, inclusion of lactacystin diminishes the loss of α-subunit protein (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 2). Similar results were obtained with MG-132 (Fig. 4 C, lanes 3 and 4). These data indicate that α-subunits, which may have been polyubiquitinated and subjected to isopeptidase activity (33Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar), are degraded in the proteasome in cells treated with castanospermine.Figure 4Characteristics of calnexin recognition of α-subunits. A, cells were treated or untreated with CST and transfected (TFT) with 15 μg of plasmid DNA encoding the α-subunit or also co-transfected with 15 μg of plasmid DNA encoding the δ-subunit. Cells were not treated with a proteasome inhibitor. Sequential immunoprecipitation (IP to:) was first to calnexin (c), followed by immunoprecipitation of the unbound material with anti-α (mAb 61). Lanes 1 and3, 2 and 4, 5 and 7, and, 6and 8 are pairs of sequentially immunoprecipitated samples. The Western blot was developed with mAb 210 to detect α-subunits. The density ratios were calculated by scanning and integrating the density of α-subunit bands on the Western blot and dividing the CST-treated sample by the CST-untreated sample for α-subunits precipitated by one of the antibodies. B, similar to A, except cells were transfected with 3.0 μg of plasmid DNA encoding the α-subunit to reduce expression levels: cells were also treated with lactacystin.C, similar to A, except cells were treated with 50 μm MG-132. Blot was exposed to film 10 times longer than in A and B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Treatment with lactacystin does not appear to enhance the accumulation of α-subunits expressed in the absence of castanospermine (Fig. 3, compare lanes 1 and 3), at a concentration of 10 μg/ml and 16 h of incubation. The degradation rate for α-subunits may be substantially lower when expressed in the absence of castanospermine, preventing detection of an enhanced accumulation in cells not treated with castanospermine. In support of a substantially lower degradation rate for α-subunits expressed in the absence of castanospermine, the conjugation of polyubiquitin chains is substantially reduced when α-subunits are expressed without castanospermine (Fig. 2 A, compare lane 1 to2). To examine whether α-subunits are more prone to aggregate in cells treated with castanospermine, and whether this contributes to the loss of α-subunits, we analyzed insoluble fractions following detergent solubilization of cells. Cells were solubilized in the 0.5% CHAPS buffer described above, subjected to low speed centrifugation (5 min, 2,000 × g), and the resulting supernatant was subjected to high speed centrifugation (30 min, 16,000 ×g). Western blots, of insoluble materials in the final fraction, displayed equivalently dense α-subunit bands in samples treated or untreated with castanospermine (data not shown). Therefore, we were unable to establish aggregation as a factor contributing to the loss of α-subunit protein expressed in the presence of castanospermine. To ascertain whether glucose trimming influences interactions between calnexin and α-subunits, cells were treated with castanospermine, and then transfected with various amounts of plasmid DNA encoding the α-subunit (Fig. 4). In some experiments, cells were also treated with proteasome inhibitors to reduce degradation and to facilitate the distinction between altered recognition by calnexin from increased degradation. Sequential immunoprecipitations were conducted with an antibody to calnexin (c), followed by immunoprecipitation of the unbound material with an anti-α- subunit antibody (mAb 61), to assess the extent of calnexin-α-subunit recognition. In Fig. 4, sequentially precipitated α-subunits are displayed, with lane 1 in sectionsA-C displaying α-subunits bound to calnexin, andlane 3 exhibiting the α-subunits not cleared with calnexin; likewise, lane 2 in sections A-Cdisplays α-subunits bound to calnexin and lane 4 exhibits α-subunits not cleared with calnexin. Densities of α-subunit bands were quantified, and density ratios for α-subunits expressed in the presence relative to the absence of castanospermine were calculated. Each histogram bar was calculated separately for α-subunits precipitated with anti-calnexin or anti-α-subunit antibodies; for example, in Fig. 4, A-C, the histogram bars designatedTFT: α and IP to: c, were calculated for α-subunits co-immunoprecipitated with calnexin by anti-calnexin antibody, by dividing the band densities for α-subunits expressed in the presence (shown in lane 2) and absence of castanospermine (shown in lane 1"

The CLM fraction was separated from the bulk of the cellular protein and was greatly enriched in PtdIns, PtdIns4P, and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) and an adenosine-sensitive type II PtdIns 4-kinase activity.

A vast number of extracellular stimuli are transduced via plasma membrane-associated tyrosine kinase and G protein-coupled receptors to activate the phosphoinositidase C (PIC) 1The abbreviations used are: PIC, phosphoinositidase C; CLM, caveolin-rich light membranes; PtdIns, phosphatidylinositol; PtdIns4P, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate; PtdIns(4,5)P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate: PtdIns 4-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase; PITP, phosphatidylinositol transfer protein; EGF, epidermal growth factor; TLC, thin layer chromatography; DIG(s), detergent-insoluble, glycolipid-rich domain(s); Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: PIC, phosphoinositidase C; CLM, caveolin-rich light membranes; PtdIns, phosphatidylinositol; PtdIns4P, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate; PtdIns(4,5)P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate: PtdIns 4-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase; PITP, phosphatidylinositol transfer protein; EGF, epidermal growth factor; TLC, thin layer chromatography; DIG(s), detergent-insoluble, glycolipid-rich domain(s); Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. signaling pathway. Activation of PIC leads to hydrolysis of PtdIns(4,5)P2 to generate inositol(1,4,5)P3 and diacylglycerol, which lead in turn to increases in intracellular Ca2+ and the activation of protein kinase C, respectively (reviewed in Refs. 1Exton J.H.

In recent years other cellular roles for PtdIns(4,5)P2have been identified. For example, PtdIns(4,5)P2 possesses biological activity in its own right in controlling the organization of the actin cytoskeleton (3Fukami K. Endo T. Imamura M. Takenawa T. J. Biol.

Ferguson K.M. Schlessinger J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 237-242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Furthermore PtdIns(4,5)P2 and its immediate metabolic precursor PtdIns4P are substrates for phosphorylation at the 3′ position by a family of enzymes known as the phosphoinositide 3-kinases (7Toker A. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). 3′-Phosphorylated polyphosphoinositides are thought to represent a novel class of signaling molecules that may regulate a range of intracellular target proteins, including, for example, the protein kinases Btk (8Salim K.

It is clear therefore, that levels of PtdIns4P and PtdIns(4,5)P2 may control multiple intracellular signal transduction cascades. In A431 cells, occupation of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors leads to activation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis by PICγ (11Pike L.J. Eakes A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1644-1651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and stimulation of a type II PtdIns 4-kinase (12Walker D.H. Pike L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7513-7517Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In addition, stimulated EGF receptors co-purify (13Thompson D.M. Cochet C. Chambaz E.M. Gill G.N. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 31243-31251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with PtdIns 4-kinase activity, and there is evidence to suggest that PtdIns 4-kinase (15Cochet C. Filhol O. Payrastre B. Hunter T. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 637-644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) may bind to a basic juxtamembrane region of the EGF receptor. Work from this laboratory has also established that the phosphoinositide transfer protein (PITP) can be co-immunoprecipitated with both EGF receptors and PtdIns 4-kinase activity in EGF-treated A431 cells (14Kauffmann-Zeh A. Klinger R. Endemann G. Waterfield M.D. Wetzker R. Hsuan J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31243-31251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This evidence, coupled with the observation that PITP is required to reconstitute PICβ (16Thomas G.M. Cunningham E. Fensome A. Ball A. Totty N.F. Truong O. Hsuan J.J. Cockcroft S. Cell. 1993; 74: 919-928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) and PICγ (17Kauffmann-Zeh A. Thomas G.M. Ball A. Prosser S. Cunningham E. Cockcroft S. Hsuan J.J. Science. 1995; 268: 1188-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) signaling in cytosol-depleted cells, has led to the hypothesis that the receptor, phosphoinositide kinases, and PITP form a functional signaling complex in mitogen-activated cells (17Kauffmann-Zeh A. Thomas G.M. Ball A. Prosser S. Cunningham E. Cockcroft S. Hsuan J.J. Science. 1995; 268: 1188-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Recent evidence has indicated that PtdIns4P, PtdIns(4,5)P2, and agonist-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis may be highly compartmentalized in discrete Triton X-100-insoluble micro-domains of the plasma membrane that are enriched in caveolin, a recognized marker protein for caveolae (18Pike L.J. Casey L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26453-26456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Caveolae, also known as plasmalemmal vesicles, are generally described as small flask shaped invaginations of the plasma membrane that are characteristically enriched in the integral membrane protein caveolin (19Parton R.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 542-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). They also contain cholesterol, sphingolipids (20Brown D. Waneck G.L. J. Am. Soc.

However, in a previous study PtdIns 4-kinase activity was found not to be localized to caveolae (28Hope H.R. Pike L.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 843-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) suggesting that PtdIns4P was made elsewhere within the cell and somehow sequestered by caveolae. In addition, recent studies have called in to question the equivalence of Triton-insoluble membranes and caveolae. There is evidence to suggest that both receptors and G proteins may in fact localize to non-caveolar plasma membrane regions that do not contain caveolin but have a similar isopynic density to caveolae following equilibrium density gradient centrifugation (29Huang C. Hepler J.R. Chen L.T. Gilman A.G. Anderson R.G.W. Mumby S.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2365-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 30Stan R.V. Roberts W.G. Predescu D. Ihida K. Saucan L. Ghitescu L. Palade G.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). These non-caveolar, low buoyant density membrane domains have been called detergent-insoluble, glycolipid-rich domains (DIGs) or membrane rafts, and it is possible that some of the functional properties previously assigned to caveolae may actually derive from molecules present in rafts as opposed to bona fide caveolae. Given this background, we sought to further investigate the compartmentation of cellular PtdIns4P synthesis by examining whether caveolae represent major sites for the generation of PtdIns4P. Indeed, despite its central role in the regulation of cellular polyphosphoinositide levels, and the observation that only a proportion of the total cellular PtdIns may be available to replenish PtdIns4P during PIC activation, little is known about the organization of PtdIns4P synthesis at the plasma membrane or how the reported cellular compartmentation of phosphoinositide turnover may relate to agonist- and PITP-dependent PtdIns4P production (16Thomas G.M. Cunningham E. Fensome A. Ball A. Totty N.F. Truong O. Hsuan J.J. Cockcroft S. Cell. 1993; 74: 919-928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 17Kauffmann-Zeh A. Thomas G.M. Ball A.

Rev. 1992; 13: 707-718PubMed Google Scholar). The current study utilizes subcellular fractionation to isolate caveolin-enriched light membranes (CLMs) from A431 cells. We demonstrate that PtdIns4P synthesis is indeed concentrated within CLMs and that following immunopurification only a small proportion of the CLM PtdIns 4-kinase activity is associated with caveolae. In addition, using both CLMs and purified caveolae, we show first that endogenous PtdIns in these membrane subdomains is a substrate for a co-localized PtdIns 4-kinase and second that this activity is enhanced by the addition of PITP. [3H]Inositol with PT6–271 stabilizer (17.1Ci/mmol), [γ-32P]ATP (4500–6000 Ci/mmol), and the ECL Western blotting detection system were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Monoclonal anti-caveolin IgG (mAb C060) and anti-caveolin polyclonal antiserum were obtained from Transduction Laboratories. Cell culture reagents were from Life Technologies, Inc. Prestained molecular weight markers and protein assay reagents were purchased from Bio-Rad. Protease inhibitor mixture tablets (COMPLETE) were from Boehringer Mannheim. ENHANCETMspray was purchased from DuPont. OsO4 and glutaraldehyde were purchased from Fluka. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma. PITPα was expressed as a His6-tagged construct in Sf9 cells and purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen). The PITP thus obtained was further purified by gel filtration and shown to possess PtdIns transfer activity. 2S. K. Tan and J. J. Hsuan, unpublished observations. A431 cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator at 5% CO2. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-glutamax medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 50 IU/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. CLM were obtained using a detergent-free method as described previously (32Song S.K. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). All procedures were carried out at 4 °C. A431 cell monolayers grown to 50–70% confluence in 150-mm dishes were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into 2 ml of 100 mmNa2CO3, pH 11.0, containing protease inhibitors. Cells were disrupted by Dounce homogenization (15 strokes) followed by sonication (3 × 20-s bursts). 1 ml of homogenate was mixed with 1 ml of 90% sucrose in MBS buffer (25 mm Mes, 150 mm NaCl, pH 6.5) and placed in a 12-ml ultracentrifuge tube. A 5–35% discontinuous sucrose gradient was formed above the sample by layering on 6 ml of 35% sucrose solution followed by 4 ml of 5% sucrose solution. Both the 5 and 35% sucrose solutions were made in MBS buffer containing 250 mmNa2CO3. The sample was then centrifuged at 39,000 rpm for 16–18 h in a Beckman SW41 rotor. A light-scattering band was identified at the 5–35% sucrose interface that was enriched in caveolin but excluded the bulk of the cellular protein. 1-ml fractions were collected from the top of each gradient. The protein content of each fraction was determined using a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Alternatively, CLM were isolated from A431 cells solely on the basis of their unique buoyant density using a carbonate-free fractionation protocol (23Smart E.J. Ying Y.S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar) that involved ultracentrifugation of sonicated plasma membranes in OptiPrep gradients. 5′-Nucleotidase was assayed using a commercial kit (Sigma), and NADPH-cytochrome creductase activity was assayed using the method of Williams and Kamin (33Williams C.H. Kamin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 587-594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were mixed with an equal volume of 2 × sample buffer and their protein content separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride and probed with various antibodies. Bound antibody was detected using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Where appropriate, immunoblots were quantitated by two-dimensional densitometric analysis. The concentration of caveolin in the original cell homogenate was determined from immunoblots by constructing a standard curve of percent volume (a measure of signal intensity) against protein concentration for serial dilutions of the cell lysate. This relationship was found to be essentially linear for protein concentrations less than 0.6 mg/ml (data not shown). Therefore, the -fold purification of caveolin in the gradient fractions was calculated by dividing the percent volume by the amount of protein in the fraction. For the isolation of caveolae under detergent-free conditions, CLM samples isolated by the carbonate method were precleared with dynal 280 beads coated with sheep anti-rabbit IgG. The cleared sample was incubated with anti-caveolin polyclonal antiserum for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by the addition of Dynabeads for 30 min at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected by magnetic separation and washed four times in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4. A431 cells were cultured in inositol-free medium containing 1% fetal calf serum in the presence of 2 μCi/ml [3H]inositol for 48 h. Cell monolayers were then washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and the CLM fraction was isolated. All steps were carried out on ice, and the Na2CO3 buffer used in these experiments contained EGTA (10 mm) to inhibit PIC activity, and it was found that more than 90% of the [3H]inositol-labeled phosphoinositides in the cell lysate were recovered in the fractions following density gradient centrifugation. Samples from gradient fractions and immunoprecipitates on Dynabeads were extracted with chloroform:methanol:1 m HCl (60:36:4). Samples were vortexed and centrifuged for 10 s in a microcentrifuge at 10,000 rpm. Organic phases were collected and re-extracted twice with methanol:1 m HCl (1:1). Samples were vortexed and centrifuged as before and the organic phase from each tube collected. Lipids were resolved by TLC on Silica-60 plates (Merck) which had been pretreated with 1% potassium oxalate, 2 mm EDTA in 50% methanol and developed using an acid solvent system composed of propan-1-ol:2 m acetic acid (65:35) containing 1% 5m H3PO4. TLC plates were then sprayed with ENHANCETM to allow the visualization of phospholipids. Following fluorography the identity of radiolabeled lipid spots was determined by comparison with non-radiolabeled lipid standards visualized by iodine staining. The amount of radioactivity associated with each spot was determined by scraping spots off the TLC plates and liquid scintillation counting. For assays of PtdIns 4-kinase activity, each sample was mixed with an equal volume of assay buffer composed of 200 mm Tris-HCl, 40 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.6% Triton X-100, 200 μm ATP, 0.1 mg/ml PtdIns, and 100 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Reactions were stopped and the samples extracted and separated by TLC as described for the analysis of [3H]inositol-labeled phosphoinositides. The amount of radioactivity associated with each spot identified by TLC was determined by counting Cerenkov radiation. A similar protocol was employed for assaying endogenous PtdIns kinase activity, with the exception that the assay buffer did not include exogenous PtdIns or detergent. Note that the density gradient buffers employed in this study were found not to interfere with PtdIns 4-kinase activity. Electron microscopic analysis of CLM fractions and intact immunoprecipitated caveolae was performed essentially as described by Stan et al. (30Stan R.V. Roberts W.G. Predescu D. Ihida K. Saucan L. Ghitescu L. Palade G.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). CLMs were fixed in suspension with 1% OsO4 and pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 30 min in a microcentrifuge. The pellet was then stained with 2% uranyl acetate. The caveolae immunoisolated on magnetic Dynabeads were resuspended in 100 mm cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, and fixed with 3% freshly prepared formaldehyde and 1.5% glutaraldehyde. The samples were treated with 1% OsO4, followed by staining in 2% uranyl acetate prior to subsequent processing for electron microscopy using a Jeol 1010 electron microscope operating at 80 kV as described previously (34Lawson D. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1891-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Dose-response data were analyzed using a standard four parameter logistic equation and computer-assisted curve fitting. Data are presented as the mean ± S.D. CLM domains were isolated according to the detergent-free method of Song et al. (32Song S.K. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). This method has been used previously to demonstrate the interaction of p21ras with caveolin (32Song S.K. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar) and to confirm the localization of the novel protein flotillin within caveolae (35Bickel P.E.

In addition, this method avoids the use of Triton X-100, which has been shown to extract acylated proteins (32Song S.K. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 7211-7222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) from CLM. Caveolin, a 21-kDa integral membrane marker for caveolae, was reproducibly enriched in fraction 5 following density gradient centrifugation of A431 cell homogenates solubilized in sodium carbonate buffer (Fig. 1 A). The CLM fraction was visible as a light-scattering band at the interface of the 5 and 35% sucrose layers and contained within fraction 5. In common with the findings of other groups, this fraction was separated from the bulk of the cellular protein content, which remained in the 45% sucrose layer at the bottom of the ultracentrifuge tube. The CLM fraction was depleted in 5′-nucleotidase activity, a marker for the plasma membrane and NADPH-cytochrome c reductase activity, which is a marker for the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 1 B). These data are consistent with previous reports demonstrating that CLMs prepared in this way contain a small fraction of the total cellular protein and are separate from other cellular membranes (32Song S.K. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar, 37Bilderback T.R. Grigsby R.J. Dobrowsky R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10922-10927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The distribution of inositol phospholipids was assessed by density gradient centrifugation of an equilibrium [3H]inositol-labeled cell extract followed by TLC to identify the radiolabeled lipids in each gradient fraction. It was found that levels of [3H]PtdIns4P and [3H]PtdIns(4,5)P2 were greatest in fractions 4–6, which corresponded to the CLM fraction (Fig. 2). This region of the gradient contained 68.3 ± 14.6% (n = 3) of the total radiolabeled PtdIns, 61.9 ± 14% (n = 3) of the PtdIns4P, and 61 ± 11.3% (n = 3) of the cellular PtdIns(4,5)P2 pool. These data are in concordance with recent studies (18Pike L.J. Casey L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26453-26456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 28Hope H.R. Pike L.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 843-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), demonstrating that PtdIns, PtdIns4P, and PtdIns(4,5)P2 are present in CLM fractions, but the proportion of each phosphoinositide within CLM is reproducibly greater using the detergent-free conditions employed in this study. Liuet al. (21Liu J. Oh P. Horner T. Rogers R.A. Schnitzer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7211-7222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) also found that Triton X-100 was able to reduce the amount of PtdIns in CLM purified using detergent-free buffers. These results imply that phosphoinositides are highly compartmentalized within CLM domains. Furthermore, these data indicate that a mechanism exists whereby polyphosphoinositides are (a) synthesized elsewhere in the cell and then transported to CLM domains or (b) the enzymes responsible for inositol phospholipid synthesis are concentrated within CLM domains. The latter possibility was investigated by examining the distribution of PtdIns 4-kinase activity in the density gradient. PtdIns 4-kinase activity was found to be highly concentrated within CLM-containing fractions (Fig. 3 A). It was found that 60.1 ± 6.2% (n = 3) of the total PtdIns 4-kinase activity was present at the 5–35% sucrose interface. Note that these assays were carried out in the presence of a concentration of Triton X-100 that inhibits PtdIns 3-kinase activity. The co-localization of caveolin and PtdIns 4-kinase activity in a light density fraction was confirmed using a non-carbonate, detergent-free method for preparing CLMs (23Smart E.J. Ying Y.S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Using this technique, caveolin (Fig. 3 B) and PtdIns 4-kinase (Fig. 3 C) had very similar distributions. Adenosine sensitivity has been established as a criterion that can differentiate between type II and type III PtdIns 4-kinase activities (38Endemann G. Dunn S.N. Cantley L.C. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6845-6852Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Type II PtdIns 4-kinase activity is characteristically sensitive to adenosine inhibition in the micromolar range, whereas type III PtdIns 4-kinase activity is relatively insensitive to adenosine inhibition. It was found that the PtdIns 4-kinase activity associated with the CLM fraction was inhibited by adenosine with a K i of 107 μm(n = 3) and a Hill slope of 1 (data not shown). This result suggested that the PtdIns 4-kinase activity under investigation was a type II isozyme. These data are in concordance with other studies that have shown that the membrane-associated PtdIns 4-kinase activity in A431 cells is predominately a type II activity (39Pike M.C. Arndt C. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 1967-1973PubMed Google Scholar). Addition of EGF (100 nm) for 2 min to the CLM fraction did not induce any significant increase in PtdIns4P synthesis. However, addition of recombinant PITPα (1 nm) resulted in a 40–60% increase in PtdIns 4-kinase activity in the CLM fraction (data not shown). To immunoisolate caveolae under detergent-free conditions we used a method based on that described by Stan et al. (30Stan R.V. Roberts W.G. Predescu D. Ihida K. Saucan L. Ghitescu L. Palade G.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), with the exception that our initial CLM preparation was produced using the sodium carbonate-based fractionation method. This method utilizes antibody-coated magnetic beads to isolate caveolae from CLM preparations. Under these conditions, caveolin was immunoprecipitated from CLMs (Fig. 4 A), whereas no caveolin was immunoprecipitated by the magnetic Dynabeads alone, indicating the specificity of the immunoprecipitation reaction (Fig. 4 A). Furthermore, immunoblotting with an anti-caveolin monoclonal antibody carried out on control and immunoprecipitated samples indicated that 70–100% of the caveolin was cleared from the CLM fraction using the polyclonal anti-caveolin antiserum. The antiserum used in these experiments recognized the intracellular amino terminus of caveolin, indicating that the vast majority of the vesicles (produced by sonication) in the CLM fraction were in an intracellular side-out orientation. Electron microscopy was employed to further characterize both the putative caveolae immunoisolated on Dynabeads and the CLM fraction. The CLM fraction was found to be composed of a heterogeneous mix of vesicles (Fig. 4 A) composed of large size vesicles > 100 nm in diameter (22% of vesicles in CLM), interspersed with smaller electron lucent vesicles 50–100 nm of vesicles in diameter (33% of CLM vesicles) and a population of more electron-dense 50–100 nm vesicles (45% of CLM vesicles) wide.

The bioactivity of IGF-I is modulated by a group of high affinity, specific binding proteins (IGF-binding proteins; IGFBPs) that are present in the interstitial fluid. Previously, we have reported that porcine VSMCs synthesize and secrete IGF-I and several forms of IGFBPs, including IGFBP-2, IGFBP-4, and IGFBP-5. In this study, we examined the role of autocrine/paracrine secreted IGF-I in controlling the expression of IGFBP-4 and IGFBP-5 as well as the effects of these IGFBPs in modulating the cellular replication response to IGF-I. The concentrations of IGFBP-4 in the conditioned medium increased significantly from <50 ng/ml to 742 ± 105 ng/ml. This increase was associated with a decrease in the activity of an IGF-I-regulated IGFBP-4 protease. In contrast, the synthesis of IGFBP-5 was inversely correlated with culture density, and its concentration decreased from 792 ± 91 to 44 ± 14 ng/ml. IGFBP-5 mRNA in sparse cultures was 3-fold higher compared with those in confluent cultures. This culture density-dependent change in IGFBP-5 mRNA correlated closely with endogenous IGF-I levels. Since treatment of VSMC with exogenous IGF-I increased IGFBP-5 mRNA levels, we neutralized the effect of endogenously secreted IGF-I with an anti-IGF-I antibody to determine if it would alter IGFBP-5 mRNA abundance. This resulted in a 4.4-fold decrease in IGFBP-5 mRNA levels. When added together with IGF-I, exogenous IGFBP-4 inhibited IGF-I-induced DNA synthesis in a concentration-dependent manner. IGFBP-5, on the other hand, potentiated the effect of IGF-I. Therefore, IGFBP-4 and IGFBP-5 appear to be differentially regulated by autocrine/paracrine IGF-I through distinct mechanisms. These two proteins, in turn, play opposing roles in modulating IGF-I action in stimulating VSMC proliferation.

These increases temporally precede an increase in VSMC proliferation.In vitro, IGF-I acts synergistically with other growth factors to stimulate DNA synthesis (4Clemmons D.R. Van Wyk J.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 1914-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Cultured VSMCs have been shown to express IGF-I mRNA and secrete IGF-I (5Clemmons D.R. Circ. Res. 1985; 56: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 6Bornfeldt K.E. Arnqvist H.L. Norstedt G. J.

Specific inhibition of the endogenously produced IGF-I, using a neutralizing antibody, resulted in decreased cell proliferation, which indicates that IGF-I acts as an autocrine growth regulator in VSMCs (4Clemmons D.R. Van Wyk J.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 1914-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The IGF-I receptor, which mediates the biological actions of the IGFs, is expressed in VSMCs. Selective inhibition of the receptors by antisense targeting results in marked reduction of VSMC proliferation (8Du J. Delafontaine P. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 963-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that IGF-I is a very potent regulator of VSMC migration, and this action is mediated by the IGF-I receptor (9Bornfeldt K.E. Raines E.W. Nakano T. Graves L.M. Krebs E.G. Ross R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1266-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 10Gockerman A. Prevette T. Jones J.I. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4168-4173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been reported that IGF-I also plays a crucial role in regulating VSMC apoptosis (11Harrington E.A. Bennett M.R. Fanidi A. Evan G.I. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3186-3295Google Scholar, 12Bennett M.R. Evan G.I. Schwartz S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2266-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). These findings provide strong evidence to support the concept that IGF-I is an autocrine/paracrine factor that regulates VSMC proliferation, apoptosis, and migration.The pericellular bioactivity of IGF-I in a defined tissue is not only dependent on IGF-I and its receptors but is also influenced by a group of high affinity specific binding proteins (IGFBPs) that are present in the local environment. We have previously shown that porcine VSMCs secrete three IGFBPs: IGFBP-2, IGFBP-4, and IGFBP-5, with IGFBP-2 being the predominant form (13Cohick W. Gockerman A. Clemmons D.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 157: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 14Duan C. Hawes S.B. Prevette T. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4280-4288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Similarly, IGFBP-2, IGFBP-4, and IGFBP-5 have been reported to be synthesized in rat and human VSMCs (14Duan C. Hawes S.B. Prevette T. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4280-4288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 15Giannella-Neto D. Kamyar A. Sharifi B. Pirola C.J. Kupfer J. Rosenfeld R.G. Forrester J.S. Fagin J.A.

A recent study indicated that IGFBP-6 is secreted in human VSMCs (18Boes M. Booth B.A. Dake B.L. Moser D.R. Bar R.S. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5357-5363Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Although these IGFBPs are believed to play a role in modulating the biological actions of IGF-I in VSMCs, their specific role and their interactions with the autocrine/paracrine secreted IGF-I remain to be defined. To further elucidate the roles of specific forms of IGFBPs that are synthesized by VSMCs, we studied the expression and biological effects of IGFBP-4 and IGFBP-5 in porcine VSMCs. The results of the present study indicate that the extracellular fluid concentrations of these two molecules are differentially regulated by the autocrine/paracrine IGF-I through distinct mechanisms. Furthermore, IGFBP-4 and IGFBP-5 exhibited opposing effects in modulating the IGF-I-actions in this cell type.DISCUSSIONPorcine VSMCs have been previously shown to synthesize and secrete three forms of IGFBPs including IGFBP-2, IGFBP-4, and IGFBP-5 (13Cohick W. Gockerman A. Clemmons D.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 157: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 14Duan C. Hawes S.B. Prevette T. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4280-4288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The results of this study indicate that IGFBP-4 and IGFBP-5 are differentially regulated by the autocrine/paracrine secretion of IGF-I. IGF-I decreases IGFBP-4 concentrations by activating its proteolytic cleavage, whereas it increases IGFBP-5 by stimulating gene expression. IGFBP-4 and IGFBP-5, in turn, play opposing roles in modulating IGF-I action. IGFBP-4 inhibits IGF-I-stimulated DNA synthesis, whereas IGFBP-5 has potentiating effects. These results indicate an IGF-I-regulated autocrine loop is present and plays an important role in regulating cell proliferation in porcine VSMCs.In rat aortic VSMCs, the basal IGFBP-3 levels were higher, while IGFBP-2 levels were lower in confluent cultures as compared with subconfluent cultures (17Kamyar A. Pirola C.J. Wang H.-W. Sharifi B. Mohan S. Forrester J.S. Fagin J.A. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 576-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The biosynthesis and proteolytic cleavage of IGFBP-4 were higher in confluent as compared with sparse cultures. As a result, the accumulated IGFBP-4 levels remained unchanged (17Kamyar A. Pirola C.J. Wang H.-W. Sharifi B. Mohan S. Forrester J.S. Fagin J.A. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 576-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In the porcine VSMC cultures, the accumulated IGFBP-4 protein levels increased significantly when cultures reached confluence. This increase in IGFBP-4 protein levels is not associated with any increase in IGFBP-4 mRNA levels, suggesting that it is not due to alteration in IGFBP-4 biosynthesis. Porcine VSMCs have been shown to secrete a protease(s) that degrades IGFBP-4 (13Cohick W. Gockerman A. Clemmons D.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 157: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 21Parker A. Gockerman A. Busby W.H. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2470-2476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme(s) is a calcium-dependent serine protease with an estimated molecular size of 48 kDa (21Parker A. Gockerman A. Busby W.H. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2470-2476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although minimal proteolytic activity can be detected in the absence of IGF-I or IGF-II, when either of these growth factors is present the rate of proteolysis is greatly accelerated (13Cohick W. Gockerman A. Clemmons D.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 157: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 21Parker A. Gockerman A. Busby W.H. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2470-2476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A major decrease in the IGFBP-4 protease activity was detected when cells reached confluence, suggesting that the increased IGFBP-4 level associated with confluence is probably due to the decreased IGF-I-dependent proteolysis.A novel observation made in this study is the culture density-dependent expression of IGFBP-5. In contrast to IGFBP-4, the accumulated IGFBP-5 levels were higher in sparse, proliferating cultures. When cells reached confluence, the IGFBP-5 levels declined to nearly undetectable levels. Because porcine VSMCs secrete abundant protease activity that degrades IGFBP-5 (14Duan C. Hawes S.B. Prevette T. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4280-4288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), we examined whether the change in IGFBP-5 might be regulated by variations in the IGFBP-5 protease. This appears unlikely, since there was no substantial change in IGFBP-5 protease activity when low and high density cultures were compared. Instead, an increase in IGFBP-5 mRNA levels was detected by Northern blot analysis, suggesting that the change in IGFBP-5 is probably due to an increase in the synthesis of this protein.The inverse correlation between IGFBP-5 abundance and culture density mimics that of the endogenous IGF-I reported previously (5Clemmons D.R. Circ. Res. 1985; 56: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Previously we have shown that the addition of IGF-I to VSMC cultures significantly increases the IGFBP-5 concentrations. This increase in IGFBP-5 is primarily due to an increase in its synthesis (14Duan C. Hawes S.B. Prevette T. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4280-4288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In light of the close correlation between endogenous IGF-I and IGFBP-5 concentrations and the fact that exogenously added IGF-I stimulates IGFBP-5 synthesis, we investigated whether the change in IGFBP-5 might be regulated by variations in the endogenous IGF-I. Neutralization of the endogenous IGF-I with an anti-IGF-I antibody clearly suppressed the IGFBP-5 mRNA expression to the levels of the confluent cultures. Therefore, the endogenous IGF-I, whose expression is also inversely correlated with the culture density (5Clemmons D.R. Circ. Res. 1985; 56: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), may play an important role in determining the relative abundance of IGFBP-4 and IGFBP-5.The underlying molecular mechanism(s) that regulates culture density/confluence-dependent expression of the IGF-I gene is unclear. There are several examples of cell density-dependent expression of other proteins/genes in VSMCs. The levels of type III collagen and fibronectin mRNA have been shown to be increased in confluent, quiescent VSMCs (22Liau G. Chan L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10315-10320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In mouse BC3H1 cells, a cell line derived from cerebrovascular VSMCs, the smooth muscle cell α-actin gene is maximally induced in confluent cultures (23Strauch A.R. Reeser J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8345-8355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A “cell density-responsive element” has been identified in the promoter region of this gene (24Min B. Foster D.N. Strauch A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16667-16675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further effort is needed to determine if a similar cell density-responsive element is present and functional in the IGF-1 gene promoter.The results of this study demonstrate that IGFBP-4 inhibits, while IGFBP-5 potentiates, IGF-I-stimulated VSMC proliferation under identical culture conditions and that both effects could be demonstrated using concentrations of IGFBP-4 and -5 that were within the range of those endogenously produced by sparse (IGFBP-5) or confluent (IGFBP-4) VSMC cultures. The inhibitory effect of IGFBP-4 on IGF-stimulated cell proliferation is not unique to VSMCs. IGFBP-4 has been consistently shown to be an inhibitory IGFBP in many other cell types (25Jones I.J. Clemmons D.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 3-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A previous study, however, failed to show such an effect in cultured porcine VSMCs. Identical concentrations of IGFBP-4, however, inhibited the effect of IGF-I on fibroblast growth. This is probably due to the presence of IGFBP-4 protease activity in VSMC cultures. When a limited amount of IGFBP-4 is added, it is degraded rapidly, and this probably explains why low concentrations of IGFBP-4 did not inhibit IGF-I action (13Cohick W. Gockerman A. Clemmons D.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 157: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). When higher concentrations of IGFBP-4 were tested (e.g. >0.5 μg/ml), some intact protein could be detected, and an inhibitory effect was noted.In contrast to the inhibitory effect of IGFBP-4, IGFBP-5 has been shown to be capable of both inhibiting and potentiating the IGF-I actions in other cell types (26Jones I.J. Gockerman A. Busby W.H. Clemmons D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 27Andress D.L. Birnbaum R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22467-22472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Andress D.L. Loop S.M. Zapf J. Kiefer M.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 29Mohan S. Nakao Y. Honda Y. Landale E. Leser U. Dony C. Lang K. Baylink D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20424-20431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In porcine VSMCs, IGFBP-5 potentiated the IGF-I-induced increase of DNA synthesis. Relatively high concentrations (0.5 μg/ml) and long incubation times (48 h) were required for its potentiation effect. When incubated for a relatively short time (24 h), we found that high concentrations of IGFBP-5 had a moderate inhibitory effect (data not shown). We examined the degradation of the exogenously added IGFBP-5 under these conditions. Almost all of the added IGFBP-5 was degraded after more than 48 h of incubation, but a substantial proportion of IGFBP-5 remained intact within the first 24 h of incubation. Therefore, the difference in the degree of IGFBP-5 proteolysis may explain the different results. Intact IGFBP-5 in the culture medium binds to IGF-I with a high affinity that is at least 10-fold greater than the IGF-I receptor (25Jones I.J. Clemmons D.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 3-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, when it is added to the culture medium it limits receptor association (30Imai Y. Busby W.H. Clark J.B. Horvitz G. Rees C. Clemmons D.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2596-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Under conditions in which long incubation times are used, most, if not all, of the added IGFBP-5 is degraded into a 21-kDa fragment. This fragment has very low affinity for IGF-I (14Duan C. Hawes S.B. Prevette T. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4280-4288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This switch in binding affinity results in the equilibrium favoring binding of IGF-I to its receptor. This hypothesis is supported by the recent observation that high concentrations of a mutant form of IGFBP-5 that is protease-resistant inhibits IGF-I actions in porcine VSMCs (30Imai Y. Busby W.H. Clark J.B. Horvitz G. Rees C. Clemmons D.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2596-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Alternatively, this potentiating effect of IGFBP-5 may be related to its capacity to bind to extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins (31Parker A. Clark J.B. Busby Jr., W.H. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13523-13529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Jones et al.(26Jones I.J. Gockerman A. Busby W.H. Clemmons D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) have shown that ECM-bound IGFBP-5 potentiates, while soluble IGFBP-5 added to the cultures inhibits, IGF-I-induced cell proliferation in human fibroblasts. The ECM-bound IGFBP-5 has an affinity for IGF-I that is 8-fold lower than the IGF-I receptor, thus permitting better equilibration. The ECM-associated IGFBP-5 is also resistant to proteolysis (31Parker A. Clark J.B. Busby Jr., W.H. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13523-13529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Therefore, the major function of the protease may be to limit the amount of intact IGFBP-5 in the conditioned medium while allowing the ECM-associated IGFBP-5 to accumulate.We propose, based on the findings of this and previous studies, a model to explain the potential mechanism by which members of the IGF family interact with each other to determine the cellular response in VSMCs (Fig. 9). The endogenous IGF-I, whose expression is inversely correlated with culture density, plays an central role in controlling IGFBP-4 and IGFBP-5 concentrations. In the sparse/proliferating cells, the IGF-I expression is high, and it increases IGFBP-5 concentrations by stimulating gene expression. It decreases IGFBP-4 concentrations through activating proteolysis. The relatively higher IGFBP-5 and lower IGFBP-4 levels in turn result in a greater mitogenic response to IGF-I. In the confluent/differentiated cells, the expression of IGF-I and therefore IGFBP-5 is low, and the intact IGFBP-4 level is increased due to the decreased IGF-dependent proteolysis. As a result, there is an attenuation of cellular response to IGF-I.Other investigators have reported a relationship between the confluence or differentiation state of various cell types and the relative abundance of IGFBPs. In human colon cancer CaCo2 cells, which express and secrete IGF-II and IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-4, proliferating cells express abundant IGF-II and low quantities of inhibitory IGFBP-4, while differentiated cells secrete abundant IGFBP-4 and virtually undetectable IGF-II (32Singh P. Dai B. Yallampalli U. Lu X. Schroy P.C. Endocrinology. 1995; 137: 1764-1774Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In MC3T3-E1 murine osteoblasts, IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-4 are produced at their highest concentrations in differentiated cells, while IGFBP-5 production is higher in proliferating cells (33Thrailkill K.M. Quarles L.D. Hagase H. Suzuki K. Serra D.M. Fowlkes J.L. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3527-3533Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar elevated expression associated with confluency was also noted for another inhibitor of IGFs, IGFBP-6, in keratinocytes and myoblasts (34Ewton D.Z. Florini J.R. J. Endocrinol. 1995; 144: 539-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 35Kato M. Ishizaki A. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Kyogoku M. Miyazono K. Heldin C-H. Funa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12373-12379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). During the differentiation of mouse C2 myoblasts in culture, proliferating cells express negligible amounts of IGFBP-5 (36Tollefsen S.E. Lajara R. McCusker R.H. Clemmons D.R. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13810-13817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37James P.L. Jones S.B. Busby Jr., W.H. Clemmons D.R. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22305-22312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In response to switching to a differentiation medium, myoblasts exit the cell cycle and commence along a differentiation pathway that is accompanied by an extensive induction of IGFBP-5. In this system, however, the levels of endogenous IGFs also increased during the differentiation. It would appear, therefore, the expression of IGFs and IGFBPs is coordinately regulated in response to changes in culture confluence/cell differentiation state in many cell types. Analysis of the mechanisms that control culture density/confluence-dependent changes in IGF-I and IGFBP expression may have important implications for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying cell growth and differentiation in VSMCs.

Specific inhibition of the endogenously produced IGF-I, using a neutralizing antibody, resulted in decreased cell proliferation, which indicates that IGF-I acts as an autocrine growth regulator in VSMCs (4Clemmons D.R. Van Wyk J.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 1914-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The IGF-I receptor, which mediates the biological actions of the IGFs, is expressed in VSMCs. Selective inhibition of the receptors by antisense targeting results in marked reduction of VSMC proliferation (8Du J. Delafontaine P. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 963-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that IGF-I is a very potent regulator of VSMC migration, and this action is mediated by the IGF-I receptor (9Bornfeldt K.E. Raines E.W. Nakano T. Graves L.M. Krebs E.G. Ross R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1266-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 10Gockerman A. Prevette T. Jones J.I. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4168-4173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been reported that IGF-I also plays a crucial role in regulating VSMC apoptosis (11Harrington E.A. Bennett M.R. Fanidi A. Evan G.I. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3186-3295Google Scholar, 12Bennett M.R. Evan G.I. Schwartz S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2266-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). These findings provide strong evidence to support the concept that IGF-I is an autocrine/paracrine factor that regulates VSMC proliferation, apoptosis, and migration. The pericellular bioactivity of IGF-I in a defined tissue is not only dependent on IGF-I and its receptors but is also influenced by a group of high affinity specific binding proteins (IGFBPs) that are present in the local environment. We have previously shown that porcine VSMCs secrete three IGFBPs: IGFBP-2, IGFBP-4, and IGFBP-5, with IGFBP-2 being the predominant form (13Cohick W. Gockerman A. Clemmons D.R. J. Cell.

In this study, we have made sequential Cys substitutions across both transmembrane helices and used disulfide cross-link formation to determine the oligomeric arrangement of the c subunits. Cross-link formation between single Cys substitutions in helix 1 provided initial limitations on how the subunits could be arranged.

F1F0 ATP synthases catalyze the formation of ATP utilizing the energy of a transmembrane H+electrochemical gradient, generated by electron transport complexes and other ion pumping systems. Closely related ATP synthases are found in the plasma membrane of eubacteria, the inner membrane of mitochondria, and the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts. The enzyme is a multisubunit complex with distinct extramembranous and transmembrane domains, termed F1 and F0, respectively. Ion movement through F0 is coupled to ATP synthesis/hydrolysis at sites in F1 (1Senior A.E. Physiol. Rev. 1988; 68: 177-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 2Fillingame R.H. Kurlwich T.A. The Bacteria. 12. Academic Press, Inc., New York1990: 345-391Google Scholar). The simplest F1 sectors, as found in Escherichia coli, consist of five subunits in an α3β3γδε stoichiometry. Homologous subunits are found in mitochondria and chloroplasts. A high resolution structure of a substantial part of bovine F1 shows the three α- and three β-subunits to alternate around a central core through which subunit γ extends and protrudes (3Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2734) Google Scholar). The structure fits well with the binding change mechanism proposed by Boyer and co-workers (4Boyer P.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 717-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1565) Google Scholar), where each of the three β-subunits alternates between the loose binding of ADP plus Pi, tight ADP plus Pibinding and ATP synthesis, and ATP release during catalytic turnover. Several recent studies now show that subunit γ rotates within the core of the hexagonally arranged α3β3complex to presumably drive the binding changes in each β-subunit (5Duncan T.M. Bulygin V.V.

The mechanism of coupling H+ translocation through F0 to γ subunit rotation is unknown.The E. coli F0 is the simplest type found in nature.

Electron microscopic studies suggest that the a and b subunits pack at the periphery of a complex of subunit c (10Birkenhäger R. Hoppert M. Deckers-Hebestreit G. Mayer F. Altendorf K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 58-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Subunit b, with a single transmembrane helix and larger cytoplasmic domain, is proposed to associate with subunit δ to make up a stator that binds and fixes the F1 α3β3 catalytic head group to F0 (11Lill H.

The most compelling evidence for a direct role of the side chain carboxyl in cation binding has come from work on the related Na+-translocating enzyme of Propiogenium modestum (16Kluge C. Dimroth P.

The coupling of proton movements to binding changes in F1 appears to occur by an interaction between the loop region of subunit c with subunits ε and γ (15Fillingame R.H. J. Exp.

Several models have been proposed whereby ATP synthesis in the F1 domain is coupled to proton movements through F0 via movements of subunit c relative to the multicopy subunit a (21Cox G.B. Jans D.A.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar).Information on the structural organization of F0 subunits is essential if we are to understand how H+ transport is coupled to ATP synthesis. In this study, Cys was substituted into subunit c in order to determine the arrangement of subunits by disulfide cross-linking. The cross-linking data support the structural model of monomeric subunit c as determined by NMR (24Girvin M.E. Fillingame R.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1635-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). 1Girvin, M. E., Rastogi, V. K., Abildgaard, F., Markley, J. L., and Fillingame, R. H. (1998) Biochemistry, in press. 1Girvin, M. E., Rastogi, V. K., Abildgaard, F., Markley, J. L., and Fillingame, R. H. (1998) Biochemistry, in press. A ringlike arrangement of 12 subunits c with helix 1 in the center and helix 2 at the periphery is indicated. The subunits interact with the front face of one subunit packed against the back face of the next subunit with the Asp61 carboxylate centered within a four-helix bundle between adjacent subunits c. The model provides insights and limitations into how H+ translocation can be coupled to the rotation and synthesis of ATP within F1.DISCUSSIONSingly and doubly Cys-substituted mutants of subunit c were generated here to determine by disulfide cross-link formation the arrangement of subunits in F0. The results confirm that subunit c is folded in a hairpin-like structure with two transmembrane helices. Double Cys substitutions that formed cross-linked multimers on oxidation but showed little or no homodimer formation as single Cys substitutions provide the most compelling evidence for a ringlike arrangement of subunits, as shown in Fig. 3 E. The defining double Cys substitutions include the A14C/M16C, M16C/G18C, and G18C/L19C pairs in helix 1 and the L70C/L72C pair in helix 2. Multimers formed by “diagonal” cross-linking between helix 1 and helix 2 define the orientation of helices with respect to each other and provide further evidence for a ringlike arrangement. The key double Cys substitutions that fall into this category are A14C/L72C and A21C/M65C. The cross-linking data fit remarkably well with the proposed NMR model of monomeric subunit c (24Girvin M.E. Fillingame R.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1635-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).1 In fact, the NMR model was used as a basis for predicting residues that were likely to cross-link in the experiments described above.The formation of cross-linked homodimers from single Cys substitutions in helix 2 conflict with the model shown in Fig. 3 E. Notably, the stretch of cross-linking is centered around Asp61. Cross-link formation may reflect structural flexibility in this region that is necessary to function, possibly a swiveling of helix 2 relative to helix 1 in events related to proton transport. As mentioned under “Results,” it also seems possible that Cys replacement of Gly or Ala residues, which are normally packed at the interface between helices in the monomer, may result in packing of the larger side chain at either side of the interface. If there is some breathing in the packing of helices, the position of the sulfhydryl may change from side-to-side by a dynamic equilibrium. Cys side chains packed on opposite sides of the interface would obviously be susceptible to disulfide bond formation. This could account for the cross-linked homodimers seen in the G58C and A62C mutants. We have also carried out cross-linking studies in the presence of aminoxid WS35, a detergent that was previously used to solubilize and reconstitute intact F1F0 (33Friedl P. Friedl C. Schairer H.U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 100: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The addition of detergent resulted in high yield homodimer formation with all mutant membranes exhibiting even minor cross-linking with oxidant alone and also cross-linking with membranes in some mutants where cross-linking was not observed in the absence of detergent. The structure of solubilized F0 must be somewhat different, i.e. more flexible than the structure in the lipid bilayer.The high yield, cross-linked homodimers that form in the single Cys substitutions of helix 1, V15C, I26C, and I30C, fall on one face of an α-helix in the NMR structure, i.e. on the face that lines the inner core of the ring shown in Fig. 3 E. The predominance of Gly and Ala in residues to either side of this face reduces the cross-sectional diameter throughout helix 1. For this reason, we depict helix 1 as being smaller in diameter than helix 2 in the schematic model (Fig. 3 E). In a ring type arrangement, this is expected from from geometric packing constraints. The side chains of the face protruding into the central core are in close proximity with those in the neighboring helix 1, and preliminary modeling indicates Cα–Cα distances of 9–10 Å, i.e. short enough to allow disulfide cross-link formation with only minor movements of helices. The opposing face of helix 2, i.e. the one positioned to the outside of the ring, is also hydrophobic with multiple branched chains. Residues in these two opposing faces are hydrophobic but not highly conserved (32Blair A. Ngo L. Park J. Paulsen I.T. Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 17-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), which is consistent with both surfaces being exposed to the lipid milieu of the membrane. In other membrane proteins, the surfaces involved in protein-protein contact show the greatest sequence conservation (34Rees D.C. Komiya H. Yeates T.O. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 607-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Met11, Val15, and Leu19 on the interior helical face are selectively labeled by 3-(trifluoromethyl)-3-(iodophenyl)diazirine, in addition to other selectively labeled residues elsewhere in the protein, which led to the suggestion that these residues were on one face of an α-helix that was exposed to the fatty acyl phase of the lipid bilayer (35Hoppe J. Brunner J. Jørgensen B.B. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5610-5616Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In the ring of subunit c suggested here, the diameter of the space in the central core is ≥25 Å, and it seems likely that lipid molecules will be present and account for the 3-(trifluoromethyl)-3-(iodophenyl)diazirine accessibility. Similar situations with centrally located lipid are seen with the bacteriorhodopsin trimer of the purple membrane (36Grigorieff N. Ceska T.A. Downing K.H. Baldwin J.M. Henderson R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 250: 393-421Crossref Scopus (868) Google Scholar) and presumed for the homooligomeric ring of the light-harvesting complex LH2 (37McDermott G. Prince S.M. Freer A.A. Hawthornthwaite-Lawless A.M. Papiz M.Z. Codgell R.J. Isaacs N.W. Nature. 1995; 374: 517-521Crossref Scopus (2474) Google Scholar). The arrangement proposed here correlates well with recent scanning force microscopy studies, where F0 appears as a ringlike structure surrounding a central dimple when viewed from the cytoplasmic side (38Takeyasu K. Omote H. Nettikadan S. Tokumasu F. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Futai M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 39Singh S. Turina P. Bustamante C.J. Keller D.J. Capaldi R.A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 397: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar).A variety of experiments support the idea that Asp61 inE. coli and equivalent residues in other species bind and release protons in the transport step coupled to ATP synthesis (15Fillingame R.H. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 217-224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,40Dimroth P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1318: 11-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The essential Asp61 in helix 2 of the E. coli protein can be moved to position 24 in helix 1 with retention of function (41Miller M.J. Oldenburg M. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4900-4904Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The NMR model of monomeric subunit c shows Ala24 of helix 1 in close proximity to Asp61 of helix 2, but the side chains point to opposite surfaces of the packed helices.1 How then is function retained in the Asp interchange mutant? In the model depicted here, the Ala24and Asp61 side chains are positioned within the center of a four-helix bundle formed by the front and back face of two adjacent monomers (Fig. 3 E). The interchange of the essential carboxyl from one position to another can be rationalized in such an arrangement. The model can also be used to rationalize the position of essential liganding residues in subunit c of the Na+-translocating F1F0 ATPases and a Li+ binding variant of the E. coliF1F0 ATPase. Kaim et al. (17Kaim G. Wehrle F. Gerike U. Dimroth P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9185-9194Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) have shown that residues Gln32, Glu65, and Ser66 are essential for Na+ binding in theP. modestum enzyme, i.e. residues at positions equivalent to residues 28, 61, and 62 in E. coli. The conserved residues in P. modestum(Gln, Glu, and Thr) have been identified at equivalent positions within the transmembrane helices of subunit c in the Na+-F1F0 ATPase ofAcetobacterium woodii (42Rahlfs S. Müller V. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 269-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In both enzymes, Pro is found at a position equivalent to Ala24 in E. coli. In the model depicted here, each of these side chains points toward the center of the four-helix bundle formed by neighboring subunits. The model also explains why VD61AI → AE61S(G/A) substitutions in E. coli subunit c enables Li+binding (18Zhang Y. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 87-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar); i.e. the Ser62 hydroxyl can serve as a liganded group opposite the Glu61 carboxyl.The F1F0 ATP synthases share many structural similarities with a family of so called vacuolar or V1V0 ATPases. The V1V0ATPases function as primary proton pumps to acidify intracellular organelles and extracellular spaces (43Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 44Harvey W.R. Wieczorek H. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 203-216PubMed Google Scholar). The subunit c of V1V0 H+-ATPases is approximately twice the size of its counterpart in the F1F0ATPases and appears to have evolved by duplication of a progenitor gene (45Mandel M. Moriyama Y. Hulmes J.D. Pan Y-C.E. Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5521-5524Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Four transmembrane helices are predicted. Helices 1 and 3 and helices 2 and 4 of this larger subunit c show homology with helices 1 and 2 of the subunit c of the F1F0 ATP synthases, respectively. Helices 1 and 3 of V-type subunit c show a striking enrichment and sequence conservation of Gly and Ala residues, similar to that seen in F-type subunit c. A model has been proposed for this multicopy subunit based on electron microscopy image analysis and chemical modification (46Finbow M.E. Eliopoulos E.E. Jackson P.J. Keen J.N. Meagher L. Thompson P. Jones P.C. Findlay J.B.C. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 47Holzenburg A. Jones P.C. Franklin T. Pali T. Heimburg T. Marsh D. Findlay J.B.C. Finbow M.E. Eur. J.

J. 1995; 312: 739-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In the model, six subunits c, each folding as a bundle of four α-helices, come together to form a hexameric complex with a central pore. The model does differ in critical respects from the one presented here. However, the prediction that helix 1 lines the pore of the oligomer (48Jones P.C. Harrison M.A. Kim Y.-I. Finbow M.E. Findlay J.B.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 739-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), based upon Cys substitution analysis and chemical modification, is borne out inE. coli subunit c model. It seems likely that the arrangement of the V-type subunit c will be like that proposed here, with helices 1 and 3 lining the inner ring and helices 2 and 4 lining the outer. The loss of the conserved carboxylate in the second helix of the V-type subunit c would effectively halve the number of proton binding sites. This loss would lower the H+/ATP ratio, allowing ATP-driven H+ pumping to generate greater electrochemical gradients while preserving the overall structural features of the complex (49Cross R.L. Taiz L. FEBS Lett. 1990; 259: 227-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Based on the precedent with the E. coli subunit c (41Miller M.J. Oldenburg M. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4900-4904Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), attempts have been made to generate a functional enzyme after exchange of the essential carboxyl from helix 4 to helix 3, but they have failed. 5N.

The model shown here suggests that an interchange between helix 4 and helix 1 is more likely to work, with the proton binding site at the center of a four-helix bundle and helix 4 packing close to helix 1. Finally, the model would predict that in the Na+-translocating V1V0 ATPase of Enterococcus hirae(50Kakinuma Y. Kakinuma S. Takase K. Konishi K. Igarashi K. Yamato I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 1063-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), the Na+-liganding groups should fall between helix 4 and helix 1. The Na+-liganding residue Gln32 inP. modestum appears to be replaced by Ser30 in a conserved Gly- and Ala-rich sequence (32Blair A. Ngo L. Park J. Paulsen I.T. Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 17-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).The arrangement of subunit c presented here provides insights and limitations on how proton movement can be coupled to ATP synthesis/hydrolysis. The coupling takes place by rotation of the γ-subunit within the core of the α3β3subunit (5Duncan T.M. Bulygin V.V. Zhou Y. Hutcheon M.L. Cross R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10964-10968Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 6Sabbert D. Engelbrecht S. Junge W. Nature. 1996; 381: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 7Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kiniosita Jr., K. Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1940) Google Scholar). This has led to proposals that the oligomeric ring of subunit c rotates past a static, peripherally located subunit a in the membrane sector (5Duncan T.M. Bulygin V.V. Zhou Y. Hutcheon M.L. Cross R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10964-10968Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 22Vik S.B. Antonio B.J. J. Biol.

Oster G. Nature. 1998; 391: 510-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). In the models, the proton-translocating carboxyl is located on the outside of the ring, and upon protonation it is envisioned as moving into the hydrocarbon region of the lipid bilayer. In the ring arrangement shown here, the proton or ion would be coordinated in the center of the four-helix bundle rather than being exposed directly to the lipid milieu. Subunit a would in some way be expected to cause an opening and closing of the four-helix bundle with resultant ion uptake and release. We should note that it is still unproven that the subunit c oligomer rotates in the membrane. Alternatively, others have suggested that the membrane sector may remain fixed relative to the α and β subunits in F1(15Fillingame R.H. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 217-224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Jones P.C. Harrison M.A. Kim Y.-I. Finbow M.E. Findlay J.B.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 739-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In such a model, only subunit γ and the associated subunit ε are predicted to move at the polar loop surface of subunit c. Conformational changes would be relayed from the site of ion binding/release to the polar loop of subunit c, and conformational changes in the polar loop then drive movement of the γε complex from loop to loop in a circular fashion. The key question obviously remaining is whether rotations take place within the membrane sector. F1F0 ATP synthases catalyze the formation of ATP utilizing the energy of a transmembrane H+electrochemical gradient, generated by electron transport complexes and other ion pumping systems. Closely related ATP synthases are found in the plasma membrane of eubacteria, the inner membrane of mitochondria, and the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts. The enzyme is a multisubunit complex with distinct extramembranous and transmembrane domains, termed F1 and F0, respectively. Ion movement through F0 is coupled to ATP synthesis/hydrolysis at sites in F1 (1Senior A.E. Physiol. Rev. 1988; 68: 177-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 2Fillingame R.H. Kurlwich T.A. The Bacteria. 12. Academic Press, Inc., New York1990: 345-391Google Scholar). The simplest F1 sectors, as found in Escherichia coli, consist of five subunits in an α3β3γδε stoichiometry. Homologous subunits are found in mitochondria and chloroplasts. A high resolution structure of a substantial part of bovine F1 shows the three α- and three β-subunits to alternate around a central core through which subunit γ extends and protrudes (3Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2734) Google Scholar). The structure fits well with the binding change mechanism proposed by Boyer and co-workers (4Boyer P.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 717-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1565) Google Scholar), where each of the three β-subunits alternates between the loose binding of ADP plus Pi, tight ADP plus Pibinding and ATP synthesis, and ATP release during catalytic turnover. Several recent studies now show that subunit γ rotates within the core of the hexagonally arranged α3β3complex to presumably drive the binding changes in each β-subunit (5Duncan T.M. Bulygin V.V.

Both subunit γ and ε appear to rotate as a unit (8Capaldi R.A. Aggeler R. Wilkens S. Grüber G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 397-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The mechanism of coupling H+ translocation through F0 to γ subunit rotation is unknown. The E. coli F0 is the simplest type found in nature. It consists of three subunits with a stoichiometry of a1b2c10 + 1 (9Foster D.L. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2009-2015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Electron microscopic studies suggest that the a and b subunits pack at the periphery of a complex of subunit c (10Birkenhäger R. Hoppert M. Deckers-Hebestreit G. Mayer F. Altendorf K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 58-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Subunit b, with a single transmembrane helix and larger cytoplasmic domain, is proposed to associate with subunit δ to make up a stator that binds and fixes the F1 α3β3 catalytic head group to F0 (11Lill H.

Subunit a is thought to fold through the membrane with five or six transmembrane helices and play a key role in the H+ transport (2Fillingame R.H. Kurlwich T.A. The Bacteria. 12.

Biomembr. 1996; 28: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Structural and genetic studies indicate that subunit c folds in the membrane as a hairpin of two hydrophobic α-helices connected by a polar loop on the F1 binding side of the membrane (2Fillingame R.H.

The most compelling evidence for a direct role of the side chain carboxyl in cation binding has come from work on the related Na+-translocating enzyme of Propiogenium modestum (16Kluge C. Dimroth P.

In chromaffin cells, Go is associated with secretory organelles, and its activation inhibits the ATP-dependent priming of exocytosis. By using permeabilized cells, we previously described that the control exerted by the granule-bound Go on exocytosis may be related to effects on the cortical actin network through a sequence possibly involving Rho. To provide further insight into the function of Rho in exocytosis, we focus here on its intracellular localization in chromaffin cells. By immunoreplica analysis, immunoprecipitation, and confocal immunofluorescence, we found that RhoA is specifically associated with the membrane of secretory chromaffin granules. Parallel subcellular fractionation experiments revealed the occurrence of a mastoparan-stimulated phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase activity in purified chromaffin granule membranes. This stimulatory effect of mastoparan was mimicked by GAP-43, an activator of the granule-associated Go, and specifically inhibited by antibodies against Gαo. In addition, Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme completely blocked the activation of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase by mastoparan. We propose that the control exerted by Go on peripheral actin and exocytosis is related to the activation of a downstream RhoA-dependent phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase associated with the membrane of secretory granules.

Studies on diverse secretory cell types have established a crucial role for GTP-binding proteins in the regulation of calcium-dependent exocytosis. Trimeric G proteins have been found associated with the membrane of various secretory granules (1Ahnert-Hilger G. Schäfer T. Spicher K. Grund C. Schultz G. Wiedenmann R. Eur. J.

Accordingly, the involvement of a plasma membrane-bound Gi3 protein in the late stages of exocytosis in mast cells has been demonstrated (4Aridor M. Rajmilevich G. Beaven M.A. Sagi-Eisenberg R. Science. 1993; 262: 1569-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Direct control of exocytosis by Gi and Goproteins has also been described in insulin-secreting cells (5Lang J. Nishimoto I.

Rab3 and the ADP-ribosylation factor 6 which are specifically localized on secretory vesicles (10Darchen F. Zahraoui A. Hammel F. Monteils M.P. Tavitian A. Scherman D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neuroreport. 1995; 6: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In addition, recent investigations led to the idea that Rho may be a component of the molecular machinery underlying regulated secretion (16Mariot P. O'Sullivan A.J. Brown A.M. Tatham P.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6476-6482Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 17Norman J.C. Price L.S. Ridley A.J. Koffer A. Mol. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 20564-20571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Rho belongs to the GTPase family consisting of Rho, Rac, and Cdc 42 proteins. This family has been implicated in a number of cellular functions requiring the reorganization of actin-based structures (21Takai Y. Sasaki T. Tanaka K. Nakanishi H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 227-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 22Machesky L.M. Hall A.

Sci. 1996; 21: 178-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In secretory cells, cytoskeletal rearrangements are a prerequisite for exocytosis since actin forms a cortical barrier that must be reorganized to enable docking and/or fusion of the secretory granules with the plasma membrane (24Sontag J.M. Aunis D. Bader M.F. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 46: 316-326PubMed Google Scholar, 25Burgoyne R.D. Morgan A. O'Sullivan A.J.

Neuron. 1995; 14: 353-363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Rho together with a trimeric G protein regulates the changes in the actin cytoskeleton observed in activated mast cells (17Norman J.C. Price L.S. Ridley A.J. Koffer A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1429-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 27Norman J.C. Proce L.S. Ridley A.J. Hall A. Koffer A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1005-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In chromaffin cells, we recently described that the secretory granule-associated Gocontrols the priming of exocytosis by modifying the cortical actin network through a sequence of events that eventually involves Rho (20Gasman S. Chasserot-Golaz S. Popoff M.R. Aunis D. Bader M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20564-20571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, Rho seems to be an integral component of the signaling pathway leading to the cytoskeletal redistribution necessary for secretion, although the mechanism by which Rho relates to the actin organization remains to be elucidated. To identify the partners of Rho signaling in calcium-evoked secretion, we examine here the intracellular distribution of Rho in chromaffin cells. By immunoreplica analysis and confocal immunofluorescence, we demonstrate that RhoA is a specific component of the membrane of secretory chromaffin granules. Furthermore, our data reveal that the phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) 1The abbreviations used are: PtdIns, phosphatidylinositol; gPtdIns-4-P, glycerophosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DTT, dithiothreitol; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; DβH, dopamine-β-hydroxylase; PtdInsP, phosphatidylinositol monophosphate; PtdInsP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; DTAF, dichlorotriazinyl aminofluorescein; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; CGA, chromogranin A. 1The abbreviations used are: PtdIns, phosphatidylinositol; gPtdIns-4-P, glycerophosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DTT, dithiothreitol; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; DβH, dopamine-β-hydroxylase; PtdInsP, phosphatidylinositol monophosphate; PtdInsP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; DTAF, dichlorotriazinyl aminofluorescein; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; CGA, chromogranin A. 4-kinase present on chromaffin granules (28Husebye E.S.

We propose that the granule-bound Go controls the peripheral actin cytoskeleton and exocytosis through an effector pathway involving the sequential participation of RhoA and PtdIns 4-kinase both located on the membrane of secretory chromaffin granules. Chromaffin cells were isolated from fresh bovine adrenal glands by retrograde perfusion with collagenase and purified on self-generating Percoll gradients (30Bader M.F. Trifaro J.M. Langley O.K. Thierse D. Aunis D. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 636-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Cells were suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and containing cytosine arabinoside (10 μm), fluorodeoxyuridine (10 μm), streptomycin (50 μg/ml), and penicillin (50 units/ml). Cells were cultured as monolayers on either 24 multiple 16-mm Costar plates (Cambridge, MA) at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/well or fibronectin-coated glass coverslips at a density of 2 × 105 cells or 100-mm Costar plates at a density of 5 × 106 cells/plate. Experiments were performed 3–7 days after plating. Cultured chromaffin cells (50 × 106cells) were washed with Locke's solution, rapidly frozen and thawed, and collected in 3.7 ml of buffer A containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 20 μg/ml pepstatin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 20 μg/ml RNase, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (total homogenate). Following 5 min incubation on ice, 2.5 ml of the homogenate was centrifuged for 45 min at 100,000 × g. The supernatant was saved (cytosol) and the pellet homogenized in 500 μl of buffer A (membrane-bound fraction). Plasma and chromaffin granule membranes were purified from bovine adrenal medulla as described previously (3Vitale N. Gensse M. Chasserot-Golaz S. Aunis D. Bader M.F. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 1275-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, adrenal medullary glands were homogenized in 0.32 m sucrose (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4) and then centrifuged at 800 × g for 15 min. After centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min, the pellet was resuspended in 0.32 m sucrose (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4), layered on a continuous sucrose density gradient (1–2.2 m sucrose, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4), and centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 ×g. Twelve 1-ml fractions were collected from top to bottom and analyzed for protein by the Bradford procedure. The distribution of dopamine-β-hydroxylase (DβH) and Na+/K+ATPase was estimated as described previously (31Aunis D. Miras-Portugal M.T. Mandel P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 2581-2589Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 32Ishii T. Takeyasu K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8881-8885Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Plasma membranes were purified from fractions 2 and 3, which contained the highest Na+/K+ ATPase activity. Chromaffin granule membranes were recovered from fractions 11 and 12, which contained the highest DβH activity. Fractions were diluted 10 times in TED buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT), and membranes were collected by centrifugation for 30 min at 100,000 × g. Membranes were suspended in TED buffer and stored at −20 °C. ADP-ribosylation with C. botulinum exoenzyme C3 ADP-ribosyltransferase (5 μg/ml) was performed with 15 μg of proteins in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mmthymidine, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 100 μm GTP, 0.5 μCi of [32P]NAD (0.15 μm) (30 Ci/mmol, 2 mCi/ml, NEN Life Science Products). The reaction was carried out for 30 min at 37 °C in a final volume of 120 μl. Proteins were then precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, centrifuged (15 min at 12,000 rpm), and dissolved in sample buffer for SDS-polyacrylamide gel separation. Labeled proteins were analyzed by autoradiography with a Bio-Imaging Analyzer FUJIX BAS1000 (Fuji, Tokyo, Japan). PtdIns kinase activity was detected as described by Husebye and Flatmark (28Husebye E.S. Flatmark T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 968: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Chromaffin granule membrane proteins (50 μg) were preincubated for 10 min in the presence or absence of the indicated concentrations of mastoparan in assay buffer containing 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2 in a final volume of 300 μl. The reaction was started by addition of 30 μl of the ATP solution containing 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 5 mm MgATP. After 2 min, the reaction was stopped by addition of 800 μl of chloroform, methanol, 12 m HCl (20/40/1, v/v/v). The chloroform phase was extracted, evaporated under vacuum, and then redissolved in 20 μl of chloroform/methanol (2/1, v/v). Phospholipids were separated on one-dimensional TLC oxalate-coated silica gel plates in chloroform, methanol, 4 m NH4OH (9/7/2, v/v/v). Labeled phospholipids were visualized with32P-imaging plates using the Bio-Imaging Analyzer FUJIX BAS1000. Labeled phospholipids were compared with standard lipids stained with iodine vapor. PtdIns kinase assays in the presence of LY294002 (Lilly) or quercetin (Sigma) were performed with a reduced concentration of MgATP (20 μm). Membranes were preincubated for 15 min in assay buffer containing either LY294002 (100 μm) or quercetin (100 μm) before incubation for 10 min in the presence or absence of mastoparan (20 μm). The reaction was subsequently started with [γ-32P]ATP. For definitive identification of the phosphatidylinositol monophosphates detected on the TLC plates, the radioactive spots were excised, deacylated (33Serunian L.A. Auger K.R. Cantley L.C. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 198: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and subjected to HPLC analysis using a 10-μm Partisil SAX ion-exchange column (Interchim, Montluçon, France). After sample injection, the column was equilibrated with water for 5 min, and32P-labeled glycerophosphatidylinositol monophosphates were separated using a 60-min linear gradient of 0–0.18 mammonium phosphate, pH 3.8 (33Serunian L.A. Auger K.R. Cantley L.C. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 198: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). A mixture of AMP and ADP was applied with the deacylated samples, and their 260-nm absorbance served to standardize elution times that were similar from one run to the next. Radioactivity was detected by assaying 200-μl eluate fractions.32P-Labeled glycerophosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (gPtdIns-4-P) standard was prepared by deacylation of [32P]PtdIns-4-P obtained by lipid extraction and TLC separation of 32P-labeled quiescent CHO cells as described (33Serunian L.A. Auger K.R. Cantley L.C. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 198: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The 32P-labeled glycerophosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (gPtdIns-3-P) standard was prepared by deacylation of [32P]PtdIns-3-P produced in vitro by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (p85) immunoprecipitated from CHO cells and incubated in the presence of PtdIns and [γ-32P]ATP (33Serunian L.A. Auger K.R. Cantley L.C. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 198: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The GTPase activity of purified chromaffin granule membranes was estimated according to the procedure previously described (3Vitale N. Gensse M. Chasserot-Golaz S. Aunis D. Bader M.F. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 1275-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 6Vitale N. Mukai H. Rouot B. Thierse D. Aunis D. Bader M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14715-14723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, granule membrane proteins (10 μg) were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C in 100 μl of 50 mmHEPES, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm MgCl2 in the presence of the indicated concentrations of mastoparan. The GTPase reaction was started by the addition of GTP at a final concentration of 0.8 μm with 1 nCi [γ-32P]GTP (NEN Life Science Products, 30 Ci/mmol) and stopped by the addition of 250 μl of cold 5% (w/v) Norit in phosphate buffer. After centrifugation, the32Pi in the supernatant was determined by32P Cerenkov counting. Non-enzymatic hydrolysis of [γ-32P]GTP during the assay was subtracted from all data. Assays were performed in triplicate. Chromaffin cells grown on fibronectin-coated glass coverslips were washed with Locke's solution and subsequently fixed for 15 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.12 msodium/potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, and for a further 10 min in fixative containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Following several rinses with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), cells were pretreated with 3% bovine serum albumin, 10% normal goat serum in PBS to reduce nonspecific staining. Cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with the primary antibodies in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin in a moist chamber. Cells were then washed with PBS and subsequently incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with the respective secondary antibodies diluted to 1:200 in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin. Finally, coverslips were extensively washed with PBS, rinsed with water, and mounted in Moviol 4–88 (Hoechst). Immunofluorescence staining was monitored with a Zeiss laser scanning microscope (LSM 410 invert) equipped with a planapo oil (63 ×) immersion lens (numerical aperture =1.4). DTAF emission was excited using the argon laser 488-nm line, whereas TRITC was excited using the helium/neon laser 543-nm line. The emission signals were filtered with a Zeiss 515–565-nm filter (DTAF emission) or with a long pass 595-nm filter (TRITC signal). Nonspecific fluorescence was assessed by incubating cells with the secondary fluorescent antibodies and measuring the average intensity value for each fluorochrome. This value was subtracted from all images. Chromaffin granule membrane proteins (250 μg) were subjected to ADP-ribosylation with recombinant C3 transferase. Granule membranes were subsequently immunoprecipitated with 30 μl of anti-DβH antiserum and 100 μl of ImmunoPure Immobilized protein A (Pierce) (10Darchen F. Zahraoui A. Hammel F. Monteils M.P. Tavitian A. Scherman D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5692-5696Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The beads were collected by centrifugation, and washed and bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. One-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed on 12% acrylamide gels in Tris glycine buffer (30Bader M.F. Trifaro J.M. Langley O.K. Thierse D. Aunis D. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 636-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose sheets at a constant current of 140 mA for 45 min. Blots were developed with secondary antibodies coupled to alkaline phosphatase (Bio-Rad). Immunoreactive bands were detected with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate (0.15 mg/ml) and nitro blue tetrazolium (0.3 mg/ml) in 40 mm sodium carbonate, pH 9.8, and 5 mm MgCl2. The rabbit polyclonal anti-DβH antiserum used for chromaffin granule membrane immunoprecipitation was prepared in our laboratory and its specificity demonstrated (24Sontag J.M. Aunis D. Bader M.F. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 46: 316-326PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal anti-bovine chromogranin A (CGA) antibodies (34Ehrhart M. Grube D. Bader M.F. Aunis D. Gratzl M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1986; 34: 1673-1682Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) were used at 1:5000 dilution. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against RhoA and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against RhoB (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, INC) were used at 1:10 dilution for immunocytochemical experiments and at 1:100 for immunodetection on nitrocellulose sheets. Donkey anti-rabbit IgGs conjugated to dichlorotriazinyl aminofluorescein (DTAF) were used at 1:200 dilution (Chemicon International Inc.). Goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to tetramethylrhodamine (TRITC) were used at 1:200 dilution (Chemicon International Inc.). Affinity purified antibodies against the COOH-terminal Gαo peptide (ANNLRGCGLY) or Gαi peptide (KNNLKDCGLF) were prepared as described previously (6Vitale N. Mukai H. Rouot B. Thierse D. Aunis D. Bader M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14715-14723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and their specificity against non-denaturated Gα protein was demonstrated. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Mastoparan was obtained from Sigma. Cytosolic and membrane-bound forms of GAP-43 were purified from bovine brain according to a previously published procedure (8Vitale N. Deloulme J.C. Thierse D. Aunis D. Bader M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30293-30298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).C. botulinum exoenzyme C3 ADP-ribosyltransferase (C3 transferase) prepared and purified as described (35Perelle S. Gibert M. Boquet P. Popoff M.R. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 5147-5156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was a generous gift of Dr. M. R. Popoff (Institut Pasteur, Paris). To investigate the intracellular distribution of Rho in chromaffin cells, we made use of the specific ADP-ribosylation reaction with C. botulinum C3 ADP-ribosyltransferase, in which [32P]ADP-ribose is incorporated on residue asparagine 41 of Rho (36Rubin E.J. Gill D.M. Boquet P. Popoff M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 37Aktories K. Braun U. Rosener S. Just I. Hall A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 158: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Plasma membranes, chromaffin granule membranes, and cytosolic proteins were prepared from bovine adrenal medulla by subcellular fractionation on sucrose density gradients, and the presence of substrates for C3 transferase was analyzed by gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. We found that C3 transferase consistently labeled a 21-kDa protein present in chromaffin granule membranes and to a smaller extent in the cytosol (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, the plasma membrane contained virtually no detectable ADP-ribosylated product when incubated with C3 transferase (Fig. 1 A). Control experiments performed in the absence of C3 transferase confirmed that the granule-associated 21-kDa protein was specifically labeled in a toxin-dependent fashion (Fig. 1 A). The specific association of the C3 substrate with chromaffin granule membranes was further substantiated by analyzing the distribution pattern of [32P]ADP-ribosylated proteins in fractions collected from a sucrose density gradient layered with a crude membrane preparation. As illustrated in Fig. 1 B, the radiolabeled 21-kDa protein was not evenly distributed throughout the sucrose gradient but showed a major peak in fractions 10–12. These fractions contained the chromaffin granule membranes as revealed by immunodetection with anti-DβH antibodies, a specific marker for chromaffin granules. We also used an immunoadsorption procedure to exclude the association of the 21-kDa C3 substrate with a contaminating organelle that may comigrate with chromaffin granules in the sucrose density gradients. Fig. 1 C shows that preincubation of purified granule membranes with anti-DβH antibodies followed by protein A-Sepharose addition resulted in the co-adsorption of the 21-kDa [32P]ADP-ribosylated protein, in agreement with the idea that secretory granule membranes do contain a specific protein substrate for C3 transferase. Since Rho and Rac are potential substrates of C3 transferase (37Aktories K. Braun U. Rosener S. Just I. Hall A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 158: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), we characterized further the granule-associated 21-kDa protein by immunodetection on nitrocellulose sheets. Fig. 2 illustrates a Western blot analysis of adrenal medullary plasma membranes, chromaffin granule membranes, and cytosolic proteins using anti-RhoA and anti-RhoB antibodies. RhoA was detected in the granule membrane fraction, displaying an apparent molecular mass of 21 kDa (Fig. 2 A). We also observed the presence of a substantial amount of RhoA in the cytosolic fraction but not in the plasma membrane (Fig. 2 A), in agreement with the results obtained by C3-induced ADP-ribosylation. In contrast, no specific immunosignal for RhoB was detectable among the three subcellular fractions (Fig. 2 B). To evaluate the portion of RhoA present in the cytosol, cultured chromaffin cells were collected, and the content of RhoA was estimated in three fractions defined as the total homogenate, the cytosol, and the membrane-bound compartment. By C3-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation and immunoreplica analysis using the anti-RhoA antibodies, we found that the cytoplasmic pool represented approximately 15–20% of the total RhoA present in chromaffin cells (Table I).Table IQuantitative analysis of the distribution of RhoA in chromaffin cellsTotal proteinC3 substrateRhoA immunoreactivitymgunitsunitsHomogenate8.85617 (100%)157 (100%)Cytosol4.19119 (19%)23 (14%)Membrane-bound3.15389 (63%)115 (73%)Cultured chromaffin cells (50 × 106 cells) were homogenized and processed to separate the cytosol from the membrane-bound compartment.

Values in parentheses correspond to the distribution of RhoA relative to the total amount detected in the cell homogenate. Similar results were obtained in two separate experiments. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of purified chromaffin granule membranes revealed the presence of two spots labeled with the anti-RhoA antibody. These two spots displayed only a different isoelectric point value (respectively, 6.2 and 6.5) but no difference in the apparent molecular mass (data not shown). Occasionally, the RhoA-labeled band present in chromaffin granule membranes could also be resolved into two components on monodimensional gels (Fig. 2 A). This observation may reflect some post-translational modification, such as phosphorylation. Consistent with this idea, studies in human lymphocytes (38Lang P. Gesbert F. Delespine-Carmagnat M. Stancou R. Pouchelet M. Bertoglio J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 510-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar) indicate that membrane-bound RhoA is a target for protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation, whereas cytosolic RhoA is protected from phosphorylation by its binding to the GDP dissociation inhibitor.

An important finding that is crucial to understanding Gβγ regulation of IKACh is that Gβγ activates homomultimeric GIRK4 (11Krapivinsky G. Gordon E. Wickman K. Velimirovic B. Krapivinsky L.

Science. 1996; 272: 1950-1953Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) channels. This implies that the GIRK4 subunit alone contains the necessary elements required for activation. In contrast to GIRK2 and GIRK4, GIRK1 subunits are not functionally expressed as homomultimers (23Hedin K.E. Lim N.F. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 1996; 16: 423-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 24Kennedy M.E. Nemec J. Clapham D.E.

Chem. 1997; 272: 10823-10830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and this fact limits conclusions that can be drawn about GIRK1 contributions to Gβγregulation. Initially, GIRK1 was thought to comprise the entire IKAChchannel (9Kubo Y. Reuveny E. Slesinger P.A. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1993; 364: 802-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 10Dascal N. Schreibmayer W. Lim N.F. Wang W. Chavkin C. DiMagno L. Labarca C. Kieffer B.L. Gaveriaux R.C. Trollinger D.

A. 1993; 90: 10235-10239Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), and initial studies on the mechanism of Gβγ activation of IKACh focused on GIRK1. Chimeric channels were constructed from GIRK1 and non-G protein-sensitive K+ channel inward rectifier (Kir) subunits to examine this problem. Results from the expression of these chimeras in Xenopus oocytes were used to conclude that the GIRK1 C-terminal and/or N-terminal cytoplasmic domains (18Kunkel M.T. Peralta E.G. Cell. 1995; 83: 443-449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 26Takao K. Yoshii M. Kanda A. Kokubun S. Nukada T.

Physiol. 1996; 40: 379-385Google Scholar) conferred Gβγ sensitivity on the channel complex. However, expression studies in Xenopus oocytes are complicated by the fact that GIRK1 forms a functional channel complex only by combining with an intrinsic oocyte GIRK4 homolog (XIR; Ref. 23Hedin K.E. Lim N.F. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 1996; 16: 423-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). It should be noted that chimeras containing structural elements that promote interaction with XIR can be confused with elements responsible for Gβγ regulation. Also, a consistent shortcoming of previous chimeric approaches has been the lack of direct biochemical determination of chimeric expression levels, plasma membrane targeting, and heterotetramer formation. Several biochemical studies attempted to identify a Gβγbinding site within channel subunits. These studies usually employed Gβγ binding to glutathioneS-transferase-fused GIRK1 fragments and demonstrated that Gβγ bound fusion proteins containing regions of GIRK1 cytoplasmic N-terminal and/or C-terminal domains (18Kunkel M.T. Peralta E.G. Cell. 1995; 83: 443-449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 19Huang C.L. Slesinger P.A. Casey P.J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

Here we localize Gβγ binding sites on the GIRK4 subunit of native cardiac IKACh using an in vitroGβγ binding assay and competition of binding with peptides derived from the subunit primary structure. We confirmed the functional significance of these binding sites using mutational analysis of regions implicated in Gβγ binding and functional expression of mutated subunits in mammalian cells. We identified a single GIRK4 cysteine residue important for Gβγ binding and demonstrated that Gβγbinding to GIRK4 is critical for channel activation. G proteins were isolated from bovine brain, separated into Gα and Gβγ subunits as described (29Sternweis P.C. Robishaw J. J. Biol.

Peptide N and C termini were carboxymethylated or α-amidated, respectively. For competitive binding experiments, peptides were dialyzed against H2O for 48 h, their concentration measured by spectrophotometry (optical density at 205 nm), and the peptides were transferred into the binding assay solution. Gβγ was preincubated with peptides for 20 min before incubation with the channel protein. Gβγ was labeled with 125I using the Bolton-Hunter reagent (NEN Life Science Products) as described (20Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Wickman K. Clapham D.E. J. Biol.

CHO and COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma) at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Cells were plated at 3 × 106 or 2 × 106 cells/100-mm dish, respectively, 1 day prior to transfection. For electrophysiology experiments in CHO or COS-7 cells, each 100-mm plate was transfected with 5 μg of plasmid DNA, (2 μg of each plasmid containing either wild type or mutant GIRK1 or GIRK4 cDNA and 1 μg of pGREEN lantern-GFP (Life Technologies, Inc.) using TransIT LT-1 lipid transfection reagent (PanVera Corp, Madison, WI). For biochemical and immunofluorescence detection experiments in COS-7 cells, cells were transfected with 5 μg each of plasmids containing wild type and/or mutant subunit using TransIT LT-1 reagent (PanVera Corp, Madison, WI). Deletion and point mutants of GIRK1 and GIRK4 and the extracellular epitope-tagged GIRK1-Flag construct were generated by oligo-mediated mutagenesis using the site elimination method (Transformer Mutagenesis, CLONTECH). The pCDNA3 vector carrying the coding region of either C-terminally tagged GIRK1 (GIRK1-AU5) or GIRK4 (GIRK4-AU1) was used as a template for mutagenesis. Mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. Mutant subunits were evaluated for expression levels, cellular localization, and subunit interaction after transient expression in COS-7 cells as described (24Kennedy M.E. Nemec J. Clapham D.E. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 831-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Triton X-100 was omitted in experiments designed to detect GIRK1-Flag cell surface expression. Transfected cells were visualized using an inverted fluorescence microscope to detect GFP expression. Electrophysiological recordings were performed from CHO-K1 and COS-7 cells using the patch clamp technique in the inside-out configuration. Pipette and bath solutions were identical and contained (in mm): 140 KCl, 5 EGTA, 10 HEPES-KOH, 2.0 MgCl2, pH 7.2. The resistance of the recording borosilicate glass pipettes was 2–4 megaohms. Single-channel currents were recorded at a holding potential of −80 mV using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Inc.). Data were filtered at 5 kHz, digitized at 20 kHz through a 1200 DigiData A-D converter using pClamp 6 software (Axon Instruments, Inc.), and stored on disk for off-line analysis. The channel opening probability was calculated using pClamp 6 software (Axon Instruments, Inc.) from 5-s segments of inside-out patch recordings (33Logothetis D.E. Kurachi Y. Galper J. Neer E. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1987; 325: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Changes in concentrations of Gβγ used in the dose-response experiments were achieved by transferring inside-out patches from the recording chamber to the Gβγ-containing solution. To find the GIRK subunit locus responsible for Gβγbinding to IKACh, we first studied in vitrobinding of purified Gβγ to purified cardiac IKACh. This approach included using peptides corresponding to stretches of the channel subunits in a competition binding assay. The cytoplasmic domains of GIRK4 and cytoplasmic domains of GIRK1 not strongly homologous to GIRK4, were screened by dividing them into contiguous nonoverlapping peptides of ∼20-amino acid length. Our strategy assumed that peptides that correspond to Gβγ-binding epitopes would interfere with the interaction of Gβγ with GIRK channel subunits. Not every region of the GIRK subunit was examined. Peptides corresponding to transmembrane domains of GIRK were not used because it seemed unlikely that Gβγ would interact with the channel's transmembrane domains. Also, we did not test amino acids 18–32 of GIRK4 because they comprise the epitope for the immunoprecipitating antibody, and would interfere with the binding assay. Finally, some synthesized peptides were insoluble and could not be evaluated. A summary of peptide influence on Gβγ binding is shown in Fig. 1. Almost all peptides tested at concentrations of 50–200 μm significantly inhibited Gβγ binding to purified IKACh. However, inhibition was not consistent, varying from batch to batch of peptide. After peptides were dialyzed against distilled water, most peptides did not inhibit binding at concentrations less than 200 μm, but all weakly inhibited binding at higher concentrations. The simplest interpretation of this result was that peptide sample impurities inhibited Gβγinteraction with the channel and that most of these impurities were removed by dialysis. All peptides we tested corresponding to the N terminus of both GIRK1 and GIRK4 were ineffective. Only four of the peptides tested against the C terminus inhibited in vitroGβγ binding to the channel in a concentration-dependent manner at concentrations significantly less than 200 μm (Fig. 2). The specificity of this inhibition was verified in experiments with scrambled and truncated peptides (Figs. 3,4, and 6).Figure 3GIRK1 amino acids 364–367 participate in Gβγ binding to IKACh but are not necessary for channel activation.

A peptide derived from adenylyl cyclase (QEHAQEPERQY) previously reported to inhibit Gβγactivation of IKACh (34Chen J. DeVivio M. Dingus J. Harry A. Li J. Sui J. Carty D.J. Blank J.L. Exton J.H.

C,single-channel currents recorded from inside-out patches of COS-7 cells expressing either heteromultimeric wild type GIRK1/GIRK4 channels or mutant GIRK1(Δ364–367)/GIRK4 channels, as indicated. Bath application of 20 nm Gβγ similarly activated both wild type (n = 6) and mutant (n = 4) channels. Jumps to +80 mV confirmed that the channel was inwardly rectifying.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 4Cysteine 216 of the GIRK4(209–225) inhibitory peptide is critical for inhibition of Gβγ binding to IKACh. A,comparison of the amino acid sequence of the GIRK4(209–225) peptide with homologous sequences from other inward rectifier K+channel subunits. Only 2 amino acids (Ala-202 and Trp-212) in the Gβγ-insensitive IRK1 differ from the corresponding region of the GIRK subunits shown. GIRK1 contained a unique Thr at position 210, which corresponded to Cys-216 in GIRK4. B, the GIRK1 peptide containing the unique Thr residue did not inhibit Gβγ binding in contrast to the GIRK4(209–225) peptide. The IRK1(202–218) peptide did inhibit Gβγ binding. GIRK1(203–219) peptide was 50 μm, whereas other peptides were 10 μm.

A, comparison of amino acids 226–245 of GIRK4 with homologous sequences from other inward rectifier K+ channel subunits. 5 amino acids of GIRK4 not conserved in IRK1 were evaluated for their potential importance for Gβγ binding (letters in bold attop). B, the IRK1 peptide homologous to the GIRK4(226–245) peptide did not inhibit Gβγ binding. This suggests that these 5 amino acids were crucial for the inhibitory potency of the GIRK4(226–245) peptide. The scrambled GIRK4(226–245) peptide did not inhibit Gβγ binding, demonstrating its specificity.

Gβγ-induced channel activity was completely abolished (n = 21 for COS-7 andn = 5 for CHO cells).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The GIRK1(364–383) peptide (Fig. 2) potently inhibited Gβγ binding to native IKACh. Truncation of only 4 amino acids from this peptide (amino acids 364–367; MLLM) resulted in its complete inactivation (Fig. 3 B), leading us to conclude that amino acids 364–367 in GIRK1 participated in Gβγ binding to IKACh. However, heteromultimeric channels containing the mutant GIRK1 subunit in which amino acids 364–367 had been deleted were activated by Gβγ indistinguishably from wild type GIRK1/GIRK4 channels (Fig. 3 C). Because the peptide competition result suggested that the MLLM sequence was critical for inhibition of Gβγ binding to the channel complex, and deletion of these amino acids from GIRK1 did not change channel activation, it is possible that GIRK1(364–383) inhibited IKACh activation by competition with a Gβγ-binding domain on GIRK4. Indeed GIRK1(364–383) significantly inhibited Gβγ binding to the recombinant GIRK4 subunit, which was expressed and purified from COS-7 cells. 6 of the 8 amino acids of the 268–275 stretch of GIRK4 were homologous to this region of GIRK1 (5/8 identical). Unfortunately we were not able to directly test this site for Gβγbinding using peptide blockade because the GIRK4 peptide derived from this area was insoluble. The region from GIRK1 (364–383) also contains a motif previously implicated in Gβγ activation of IKACh. Chen et al. (34Chen J. DeVivio M. Dingus J. Harry A. Li J. Sui J. Carty D.J. Blank J.L. Exton J.H. Stoffel R.H. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. Logothetis D.E. Hildebrandt J.D. Iynegar R. Science. 1995; 268: 1166-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) suggested that the putative Gβγ binding region (motif (Q/N)XXER) of adenylyl cyclase type 2 (AC2 (956–982); Fig. 3 A) had homology to GIRK1(378–382). Indeed, their experiments showed that AC2 (956–982) peptide blocked cardiac IKACh activation in excised inside-out patches. We assessed the functional role of GIRK1(378–382) by examination of whether AC2 (956–966) and homologous GIRK1(378–387) peptides inhibited Gβγ binding to IKACh but failed to detect any inhibition (Fig. 3 B). We also mutated and deleted the putative Gβγ binding motif NSKER (GIRK1 378–382) and coexpressed the mutant GIRK1 with GIRK4 in COS-7 cells but found no difference in activation by Gβγ (n = 4; data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2, the most potent inhibitor of Gβγbinding to IKACh was the GIRK4 (209–225) peptide. This peptide corresponded to the carboxyl-terminal region of GIRK4, lying just outside the second putative transmembrane domain (Fig. 1). GIRK4 (209–225) completely inhibited Gβγ binding at concentrations of 3–5 μm. Deletion of amino acids 209–225 of the GIRK4 subunit (mutant GIRK4(Δ209–225)) and expression with wild type GIRK1 abolished Gβγactivation (Fig. 5 C). However we failed to detect significant coimmunoprecipitation of GIRK1 with mutant GIRK4(Δ209–225) nor did GIRK4(Δ209–225) promote detectable cell surface localization of GIRK1 (Fig. 7) characteristic for wild type GIRK4 (24Kennedy M.E. Nemec J. Clapham D.E. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 831-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The simplest interpretation of these data is that the region 209–225 in GIRK4 is critical for both Gβγbinding and subunit interaction.Figure 7Immunolocalization and subunit interaction of GIRK1/GIRK4 subunits. Panels A,C, E, and G, immunofluorescence detection of wild type or mutant GIRK4 subunits expressed alone in COS-7 cells (Triton X-100 permeabilized cells; anti-AU1 monoclonal antibody); panels B, D, andF, mutant GIRK4 subunits promoted cell surface localization of the GIRK1-Flag epitope-tagged subunit when coexpressed in COS-7 cells (cells not permeabilized). In panels E andF the GIRK1 → IRK1 226–245 designation corresponds to the mutant GIRK4(N226K, S233H, K237Q, Q243I, and K245S) subunit.Panel H, coexpression of GIRK1 and the mutant GIRK4(Δ209–225) did not result in cell surface expression of the GIRK1-Flag epitope-tagged subunit. Immunolocalization experiments were performed at least twice. Panel I,coimmunoprecipitation of wild type GIRK1-AU5 subunits (middle panel) with anti-AU1 antibody directed against the wild type or mutant GIRK4-AU1 subunit. The GIRK4(Δ209–225) mutant protein displayed significantly lower levels of expression and coimmunoprecipitation of GIRK1 protein (right panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To refine the area responsible for the peptide inhibition, we compared the sequence of this peptide to homologous sequences of related Gβγ binding GIRK subunits, as well as to corresponding sequences of the Gβγ-insensitive IRK1 (Fig. 4 A). Comparative analysis suggested that residues Ser-209, Phe-219, or Asp-224 might be involved in the interaction with Gβγ. Mutated GIRK4 peptide (F219W) and homologous peptides derived from GIRK1(203–219) and IRK1(202–218) were then used to test the significance of these amino acids in Gβγbinding. Surprisingly, the IRK1(202–218) peptide inhibited Gβγ binding as well as the peptide GIRK4(209–225; Fig. 4 B). Also, the GIRK1-derived peptide, GIRK1(203–219), did not inhibit Gβγ binding at concentrations up to 50 μm (Fig. 4 B). Sequence comparison suggests that the substitution of Cys-216 in GIRK4 for Thr at position 210 in the homologous GIRK1 peptide might be responsible for the observed difference in potency of inhibition between GIRK4 and GIRK1 peptides. To test this possibility, the GIRK4 (C216T) mutant subunit was coexpressed in CHO cells with GIRK1. As for COS-7 cells, CHO cells do not contain endogenous GIRK-like proteins (tested with GIRK-specific antibodies; data not shown) and do not support functional expression of GIRK1(11). Heteromultimeric channels containing the GIRK4(C216T) mutant produced functionally active IKACh channels but with a greater than 50-fold lower EC50 for Gβγ(Fig. 5, A and C). The rightward shift in potency of Gβγ activation was not because of changes in either surface localization or heteromultimerization with GIRK1 (Fig. 7), confirming that Cys-216 in GIRK4 is important for binding of Gβγ to IKACh. A peptide designed from an adjacent region of GIRK4, GIRK4(226–245), was also found to significantly inhibit Gβγ binding to IKACh(Fig. 2). Again, sequence comparison between other Gβγ binding GIRK subunits and the homologous, but G protein-independent inward rectifier, IRK1, led us to evaluate 5 amino acids potentially participating in Gβγ binding (Fig. 6 A). An IRK1 peptide amino acids 219–238, homologous to GIRK4(226–245), did not inhibit Gβγ binding to IKACh. Mutation of these 5 amino acids in GIRK4 to the corresponding amino acids in IRK1 ablated Gβγ activation after coexpression of this mutant GIRK4 with GIRK1 (Fig. 6 B). These specific GIRK4 mutations did not influence assembly with GIRK1 or targeting to the plasma membrane (Fig. 7). These data support the hypothesis that the GIRK4(226–245) locus is also important for the Gβγ binding and activation. Finally, we tested a peptide derived from the GIRK1 region (220–239) homologous to GIRK4(226–245), which contained amino acids conserved in all GIRKs. The peptide inhibited Gβγ binding to IKACh (Fig. 2) with a dose response similar to GIRK4(226–245). This result was not surprising because this region is highly conserved between GIRK4 and GIRK1. We suggest that the GIRK1(220–239) peptide also inhibited Gβγ binding to the previously identified GIRK4(226–245). However, we cannot rule out the possibility that this region of GIRK1 is also important for interaction of channel with Gβγ. We have combined peptide competition and mutagenesis techniques to delineate domains within GIRK1 and GIRK4 that bind Gβγand play a role in Gβγ-mediated activation of GIRK1/GIRK4 channels. In summary, we have identified a single GIRK4 region (amino acids 209–245) that appears to be crucial for Gβγ binding. This region lies close to the putative second transmembrane domain of GIRK4. We have identified several peptides derived from both GIRK1 and GIRK4 that block Gβγ binding to immunopurified cardiac IKACh. In confirmation of these results, the mutation of regions that bound Gβγ also disrupted Gβγ-mediated channel activation. Deletion and point mutations in regions corresponding to blocking peptides from GIRK4 either completely disrupted or significantly reduced the potency of Gβγ in activating GIRK1/mutant GIRK4 channels measured in inside-out patches exposed to purified Gβγ subunits. Interestingly, deletion of GIRK1 amino acids corresponding to the peptide capable of inhibiting Gβγ binding to IKACh had no effect on Gβγ activation of GIRK1(Δ364–367)/GIRK4 channels. This result suggests that either the GIRK1 peptide inhibited binding to homologous sites on the GIRK4 subunit or that Gβγ binding to the GIRK1 site was not necessary for channel activation. The observation that amino acids 273–462 of GIRK1 bound Gβγ subunits (19Huang C.L. Slesinger P.A. Casey P.J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1133-1143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) supports our hypothesis that Gβγ binding to GIRK1 is not required for channel activation. We found that Cys-216 in GIRK4 is important for high affinity binding of Gβγ to the native channel. This same position is occupied by Thr in GIRK1. Because mutation of Cys-216 in GIRK4 to threonine dramatically reduced the potency of Gβγ, we suggest that Gβγ does not bind to this region of GIRK1. Combined with the known Gβγ-dependent activation of GIRK4 homomultimers, we suggest that GIRK4 plays a necessary role in the Gβγ-dependent activation of heteromultimeric IKACh. Huang et al. (19Huang C.L. Slesinger P.A. Casey P.J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1133-1143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) showed that a peptide corresponding to amino acids 434–462 of GIRK1 inhibited single channel activity in oocytes expressing GIRK1 and Gβγ or GIRK1/GIRK4 and Gβγ. In contrast, we found that peptides derived from this region of GIRK1 had no effect on Gβγ binding. Furthermore truncation of GIRK1 at amino acid 373 and coexpression with GIRK4 in COS-7 cells did not alter channel acitivation. 2M. E. Kennedy, unpublished data. Although Huanget al. (22Huang C.L. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) found a role for N-terminal cytoplasmic domain (34–86 in GIRK1) binding to Gβγ we could not confirm this result because peptides corresponding to these regions of GIRK1(67–83) or GIRK4(66–85) were insoluble and could not be tested in our binding assay. We found that some peptides, which did not influence Gβγ binding to the channel, nevertheless suppressed channel activation by Gβγ when applied to inside-out patches. A reasonable explanation of these results is that the peptides interacted with the channel itself and interfered with intersubunit interaction. Such an explanation is supported indirectly by noncompetitive inhibition of the GIRK1/XIR channel by a C-terminal GIRK1 peptide (35Luchian T. Dacal N. Dessauer C. Platzer D. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Screibmayer W. J. Physiol. 1997; 505.1: 13-22Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Similarly, the fact that an IRK1 peptide was also found to block Gβγ binding to IKACh does not imply that IRK1 has a Gβγ binding site, although this possibility cannot be excluded. In conclusion, Gβγ binding to IKAChchannels involves a region of the carboxyl tail of GIRK4 in close proximity to the putative second transmembrane domain, and binding of Gβγ to this region is critical for channel activation. Interestingly, these regions lie close to the putative pore domain of the tetrameric complex, perhaps providing an important clue as to why the weaver mouse GIRK2 pore mutant (a close relative of GIRK4) demonstrated loss of Gβγ sensitivity (16Navarro B. Kennedy M.E. Velimirovic B. Bhat D. Peterson A. Clapham D.E. Science. 1996; 272: 1950-1953Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Although we have shown that Gβγ binds to GIRK1, our attempts to demonstrate that this binding plays a role in Gβγ-induced channel activation were not successful. However, it is likely that a combined GIRK1/GIRK4 conformation determines the Gβγ binding site, and activation cannot be fully understood in the absence of detailed structural data."

In mammalian cells, MCM proteins are present in the nuclei in two different forms, one extractable by nonionic detergents and the other tightly associated with chromatin, which is resistant to such extraction. The level of mammalian MCM does not greatly vary during the cell cycle, but the chromatin-bound form gradually becomes dissociated with progression through the S phase (19Kimura H. Nozaki N.

It is now assumed that the bound form is associated with prereplicative chromatin and released at the time of replication; the soluble form existing abundantly in G2 nuclei is considered inactive and no longer capable of binding to chromatin. At least in budding yeast, the chromatin regions to which MCM7 binds during the G1 phase contain the replication origins (24Tanaka T. Knapp D. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1997; 90: 649-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). However, details of the mode of MCM-chromatin binding remain unclear. In budding yeast and the Xenopus egg extract system, it has been shown that MCM-chromatin binding is regulated through multiple mechanisms, while MCM binds to chromatin depending on CDC6 and the origin recognition complex (24Tanaka T.

However, there is so far no direct evidence as to whether these regulators for MCM also function in the mammalian somatic cell cycle. Whereas the MCM proteins share substantial homology, it has been suggested that each of the six is indispensable for DNA replication in budding yeast (2Gibson S.I. Surosky R.T. Tye B.-K. Mol. Cell.

Recently, we have established a procedure to isolate chromatin-bound and unbound complexes containing all six human MCM (hMCM) 1The abbreviations used are: hMCM, human MCM protein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; TX-100mCSK, modified CSK buffer containing Triton X-100. proteins by immunoprecipitation with anti-hMCM antibodies (41Fujita M. Kiyono T. Hayashi Y. Ishibashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10928-10935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, it remained to be elucidated whether there was any change in the complex formation profile during the cell cycle. In the present study, we therefore applied the immunoprecipitation procedure to synchronized HeLa cells. The results indicate that the six hMCM members may exist as heterohexameric complexes throughout the cell cycle. In addition, it was also found that, depending on the cell cycle and the states of chromatin association, hMCM4 and 2 proteins in the complexes variously change their phosphorylation states. Furthermore, we could show that cdc2 kinase plays a role in the G2/M phase hyperphosphorylation of mammalian MCM2 and 4 and in regulation of the MCM-chromatin association. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% fetal calf serum. The cells were synchronized at G2/M phase by treatment with 50 ng/ml nocodazole for 16–18 h. Cells arrested in early S phase were obtained by 2.5 mm hydroxyurea or 15 μmaphidicolin treatment for 18–20 h. G1 HeLa cells were obtained as follows. Cells in the log phase were first arrested in early S phase by aphidicolin treatment and then released. After 10–12 h, mitotic cells were collected by mitotic shake-off, replated, and cultured for a further 4–6 h. FM3A and FT210 cells (42Mineo C. Murakami Y. Ishimi Y. Hanaoka F. Yamada M. Exp. Cell Res. 1986; 167: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) were maintained at 32 °C in RPMI 1640 buffered with 25 mm Hepes and supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For synchronization experiments, the cells (5 × 105/ml) were first arrested in early S phase by 15 μm aphidicolin treatment for 16 h at 32 °C and then released to progress through S phase in the presence of 50 ng/ml nocodazole, either at 32 or 39 °C. To monitor the cell cycle, cells were stained with propidium iodide using a CycleTest kit (Becton Dickinson) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Cells (1 × 104) were analyzed with a FACScan (Becton Dickinson). If not stated otherwise, the buffer used for preparation of cell lysates and the immunoprecipitation procedure was modified CSK buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.1 mm ATP (0.1%TX-100mCSK; Ref. 41Fujita M. Kiyono T. Hayashi Y. Ishibashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10928-10935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Where necessary, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 200 μmNa3VO4, 10 mm NaF, and 0.2 μm calyculin A were added to the buffer as phosphatase inhibitors, and 1 μm staurosporine was added as a kinase inhibitor. The Triton X-100-extractable and nuclear pellet fractions were prepared as follows. HeLa cells cultured in 100-mm plates or FM3A or FT210 cells in 20 ml of culture were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed for 20 min on ice with 1 ml of ice-cold 0.1%TX-100mCSK, and subjected to low speed centrifugation. The supernatants were further clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 5 min to obtain Triton X-100-extractable fractions. Triton X-100-extracted nuclei were washed once with the buffer and either directly added to SDS-sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue) or digested with 1000 units/ml DNase I (10 units/μl, RNase-free, Boehringer Mannheim) in 1 ml of 0.1%TX-100mCSK containing 1 mm ATP at 25 °C for 30 min to obtain DNase I-released fractions (41Fujita M. Kiyono T. Hayashi Y. Ishibashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10928-10935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation with anti-hMCM7 (hCDC47) or anti-murine MCM3 (mMCM3) antibodies was performed as described previously (41Fujita M. Kiyono T. Hayashi Y. Ishibashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10928-10935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were boiled in SDS-sample buffer and subjected to 10% (acrylamide 10,bis-acrylamide 0.1) SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) followed by silver staining or immunoblotting. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (22Fujita M. Kiyono T. Hayashi Y. Ishibashi M. J. Biol.

The blots were then probed with peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Zymed) and visualized using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 25 μl of phosphatase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm MnCl2, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) or kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm ATP, 1 μm calyculin A, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated with 80 units of λ-phosphatase (New England Biolabs) for 30 min at 30 °C or 50 units of cdc2/cyclin B (New England Biolabs) for 60 min at 30 °C. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 2× SDS-sample buffer and processed for SDS-PAGE. FT210 cells (2.5 × 106) arrested in early S phase as described above were released in 2 ml of phosphate-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum and 50 ng/ml nocodazole either at 32 or 39 °C. After 8 h, 1 mCi [32P]orthophosphate was added, and the cells were further incubated for 2 h either at 32 °C or 39 °C. The Triton X-100-extractable fractions were prepared from the cells as described above with 0.1%TX-100mCSK containing phosphatase inhibitors and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-hMCM7 or anti-mMCM3 antibodies. In these experiments, the washing buffer was changed to 200 mm NaCl TET buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 200 mm NaCl) containing phosphatase inhibitors.32P radiography was performed with a Bio-Imaging analyzer BAS2000 (Fuji, Japan). Triton X-100-extractable fractions prepared from HeLa cells synchronized in G1, S, and G2/M phase, and DNase I-released fractions from G1 and S phase cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-hMCM7 antibodies, and the precipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining (Fig. 1) and to Western blotting with antibodies against each of the hMCMs (data not shown except for hMCM2 and 4 in Fig. 2; see also Ref 41Fujita M. Kiyono T. Hayashi Y. Ishibashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10928-10935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). All six hMCM proteins were detectable in the precipitates of all the fractions tested. On the other hand, the hMCM2 and 4 proteins variously changed their electrophoretic mobility depending on the cell cycle and the state of chromatin association. Because such changes in the mobility could be due to phosphorylation, we treated the immunoprecipitates with λ-phosphatase, by which hMCM2 and 4 showing aberrant mobility disappeared and the levels of p125 hMCM2 and p97 hMCM4 concomitantly increased. Mobility of the other hMCM proteins was not changed, and treatment of the precipitates with phosphatase buffer alone did not alter the mobility of any hMCM proteins (data not shown). As we reported previously (22Fujita M. Kiyono T. Hayashi Y. Ishibashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4349-4354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 41Fujita M. Kiyono T. Hayashi Y. Ishibashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10928-10935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), hMCM7 resolved into a doublet on SDS-PAGE, by an unknown mechanism. The results after λ-phosphatase treatment demonstrated that in all the fractions tested, anti-hMCM7 antibodies co-precipitated the other hMCMs with hMCM7 with roughly equivalent stoichiometry (Fig. 1). Therefore, we suggest that the six hMCM members may exist as heterohexameric complexes throughout cell cycle, whether bound to chromatin or not.Figure 2Cell cycle- and chromatin binding state-dependent phosphorylation of hMCM4 and 2 proteins in hMCM hexamers. The immunoprecipitates obtained with anti-hMCM7 antibodies as described in Fig. 1 were immunoblotted with anti-mMCM4 (A) or anti-XMCM2 (B) antibodies. Results from short exposure of blots with anti-mMCM4 are also shown in panel A to demonstrate hMCM4 doublet bands detected in soluble fractions from the G1 and S phase cells. PPase; λ-phosphatase treatment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As described above, the hMCM4 protein in the complexes was found to variously change its electrophoretic mobility depending on the cell cycle and the state of chromatin association (Figs. 1 and 2 A). In the G1 cells, most of the chromatin-bound hMCM4 migrated to the same position as that of dephosphorylated hMCM4, whereas most of the soluble hMCM4 displayed slower mobility. In the S phase cells, although the migration pattern of the soluble hMCM4 was unchanged compared with that in G1phase cells, the migration pattern of the chromatin-bound hMCM4 was obviously changed; the forms showing slower mobility were increased. In the G2/M phase cells, most of the hMCM4 displayed the slowest mobility (apparent molecular mass was ∼115 kDa). All of these extra bands disappeared with λ-phosphatase treatment. Although an unchanged mobility pattern does not always mean an unchanged phosphorylation state, these data suggest the following for the phosphorylation of hMCM4 in hMCM complexes: (1Main G.T. Sinha P. Tye B.-K. Genetics. 1984; 106: 365-385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in the G1phase, most of the chromatin-bound hMCM4 is in the underphosphorylated form (if not unphosphorylated) while most soluble hMCM4 is in the more phosphorylated form; (2Gibson S.I. Surosky R.T. Tye B.-K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5707-5720Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) during progression from G1 to S phase, although the phosphorylation state of the soluble hMCM4 is apparently unchanged, the chromatin-bound form becomes more extensively phosphorylated; and (3Yan H. Gibson S.I. Tye B.-K. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 944-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) most of the hMCM4 in G2/M phase is in the hyperphosphorylated form. The buffer used for these immunoprecipitation studies contained ATP to facilitate chromatin-complex binding and complex stability, and the chromatin-bound complexes were solubilized by incubation with DNase I at 25 °C (41Fujita M. Kiyono T. Hayashi Y. Ishibashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10928-10935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that the observed phosphorylation pattern of hMCM4 is modified in vitro. We therefore repeated the experiments in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors and a kinase inhibitor and in the absence of ATP, and we solubilized the bound complexes by salt extraction on ice. Although the hMCM heterohexameric complexes are partially disrupted under such conditions (41Fujita M. Kiyono T. Hayashi Y. Ishibashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10928-10935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), the same results for hMCM4 phosphorylation were obtained (data not shown). As previously reported (21Todorov I.T. Attaran A. Kearsey S.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1433-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), change in mobility because of phosphorylation during the cell cycle was also observed for hMCM2 in the complexes. In this case, phosphorylated forms displayed faster mobility on SDS-PAGE (Figs. 1 and 2 B). The changing pattern of the hMCM2 phosphorylation appeared to be essentially similar to that of hMCM4. As an initial step to analyze complex phosphorylation, we focused on the G2/M phase hyperphosphorylation of the MCM2 and 4 proteins, leading to their remarkable mobility shift. One possible candidate for the responsible kinase(s) is cdc2/cyclin B, which is maximally active in late G2/M phase. As shown in Fig. 3, it was found that recombinant cdc2/cyclin B phosphorylated in vitro the hMCM2 and hMCM4 in the hMCM complexes immunoprecipitated from S phase HeLa cells and promoted a shift in their mobility. The positions of the shifted bands were almost the same as those of hMCM2 and 4 in the G2/M phase (see also Figs. 1 C and 2). Mobility of the other hMCMs was not changed by the treatment. These data show that hMCM2 and hMCM4 proteins in the hMCM complexes are excellent substrates for cdc2/cyclin B in vitro. We examined the in vivo role of cdc2/cyclin B in G2/M hyperphosphorylation of mammalian MCM2 and 4 using murine cdc2 kinase temperature-sensitive mutant FT210 cells and their parental FM3A cells (42Mineo C.

Cells were arrested at early S phase by aphidicolin, and then released at a permissive (32 °C) or a nonpermissive temperature (39 °C) in the presence of nocodazole to prevent cells entering the next G1 phase. Analysis of the DNA content and the mitotic index showed that there were no obvious differences in cell cycle progression among FM3A cells, and FT210 cells cultured at a permissive temperature; approximately 70–80% of the cells were arrested in early S phase. 4 h after release, they were in mid S phase; at 8 h, they were in late S/G2 phase; and at 12 h, they were arrested in M phase (Fig. 4). However, when FT210 cells were cultured at a nonpermissive temperature, although they similarly reached late S/G2 phase 8 h after release, even at 12 h there were few mitotic cells (Fig. 4), in agreement with the previously reported G2-arrest phenotype (45Th'ng J.P.H.

First, the total cell lysates were immunoblotted with monoclonal antibody 4A4 specific for cdc2-phosphorylated vimentin (44Tsujimura K. Ogawara M. Takeuchi Y. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Ha M.H. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31097-31106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 5 A). The data showed cdc2 activation to occur around the G2 phase (8 h after release) and become maximum in the M phase (12 h after release) in FM3A cells, and FT210 cells cultured at a permissive temperature. However, in FT210 cells cultured at a nonpermissive temperature, virtually no activation of cdc2 was detected, as expected. Then the Triton X-100-extractable and the nuclear fractions were immunoblotted with anti-mMCM4 antibodies (Fig. 5 B). In addition to the main band of mMCM4, the antibodies also recognized two bands showing different mobility in FM3A cells, and FT210 cells cultured at a permissive temperature; one was observed in the chromatin-bound form in the S phase cells and displayed slower mobility, and the other was observed in the soluble form in the G2/M phase cells and displayed the slowest mobility. Both of these two bands disappeared with phosphatase treatment, and the former was undetectable in G1 phase cells (data not shown). These data show that mMCM4 also has at least two counterparts of the isoforms because of phosphorylation observed for hMCM4, the S phase- and chromatin-bound form-specific phosphorylated form and the hyperphosphorylated form in the G2/M phase.

We have studied the kinetic parameters of the C5 convertase of the alternative pathway of complement, either bound to a zymosan surface or in its monomeric soluble form. C5 convertase enzymatic activity was measured as a function of C5 concentration by quantitating production of C5b,6 under physiological conditions of temperature, pH, and ionic strength. The C5 convertases appeared to follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics and exhibited similar catalytic rate constants (k cat). However, the surface-bound enzyme, ZymC3b,Bb had aK m (1.4 μm) that was 17 times lower than that of the soluble monomeric form of the enzyme, C3b,Bb (K m = 24 μm). Thek cat for the cell-bound enzyme, ZymC3b,Bb was 0.0048 s−1 and that for soluble C3b,Bb was 0.0110 s−1. Both forms of the enzyme had a low turnover number atV max (0.23 to 0.68 C5/min/enzyme). Substituting Mg2+ for Ni2+ did not alter the kinetic parameters but lowered the half-life of the enzyme by 5–7-fold. The kinetic data presented demonstrate that the fluid phase C5 convertase, C3b,Bb, can cleave C5 without the aid of a second C3b molecule. The results also show that the greater enzymatic activity previously observed for the surface-bound C5 convertases is not due to higher catalytic efficiency but is solely due to higher affinity for the substrate C5.

C5 convertases are serine proteases that cleave C5, the fifth component of complement. The cleavage of C5 is the last enzymatic step in the complement activation cascade resulting in the formation of two biologically important fragments, C5a and C5b. 1The abbreviations used are: C3b and C5b, the proteolytically activated form of C3 and C5, respectively; Ec, chicken erythrocytes; VBS, Veronal-buffered saline; GVB, gelatin-containing veronal-buffered saline; C3b,Bb, free form of the C5 convertase; ZymC3b, C3b bound to zymosan particles; ZymC3b,Bb, surface-bound C5 convertase; RIA, radioimmunoassay. 1The abbreviations used are: C3b and C5b, the proteolytically activated form of C3 and C5, respectively; Ec, chicken erythrocytes; VBS, Veronal-buffered saline; GVB, gelatin-containing veronal-buffered saline; C3b,Bb, free form of the C5 convertase; ZymC3b, C3b bound to zymosan particles; ZymC3b,Bb, surface-bound C5 convertase; RIA, radioimmunoassay. Both fragments play vital roles in killing microorganisms. C5a, the smaller fragment, is a potent chemotactic and spasmogenic anaphylatoxin. It mediates inflammatory responses by stimulating neutrophils and phagocytes. C5b, the larger fragment, initiates the formation of the membrane attack complex (C5b-9) which results in the lysis of bacteria and other pathogens. Although complement has important functions in host defense, it also contributes to the pathology in many inflammatory diseases (1Rother K. Rother K. Till G.O. Hänsch G.M. The Complement System. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1998: 462-471Google Scholar), in xenotransplant rejection (2Dalmasso A.P. Rother K. Till G.O. Hänsch G.M. The Complement System.

Toxicol. 1994; 34: 17-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This has prompted a search for inhibitors that can control activation of C5. Specific inhibition of C5 activation would preserve the immune clearance and opsonization functions of complement which depend on C3b, but it would prevent the generation of both C5a and C5b-9.

In their most common forms the enzymes appear to be made up of a C3 convertase and an additional C3b or C4b molecule (13Daha M.R. Fearon D.T. Austen K.F. J.

Matsumoto M. Yasuda R. Levine R.P. Kitamura H. Seya T. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 927-932PubMed Google Scholar). The C3 convertases are themselves bimolecular complexes. In the classical pathway the C3 convertase (C4b, C2a) consists of C2a, the proteolytic subunit, noncovalently bound to C4b. In the alternative pathway the C3 convertase has a similar structure with Bb, the proteolytic unit, noncovalently bound to a C3b molecule. Additional C3b molecules that are needed to allow efficient C5 cleavage by these C3 convertases are produced by the activation of C3 by the C3 convertases themselves (C4b, C2a, or C3b,Bb). The result of C3 activation is the covalent attachment of numerous C3b molecules within a few hundred angstroms of the C3 convertase. Originally it was thought that attachment of C3b molecules around the C3 convertase was sufficient to generate C5 convertase activity. Vogt et al. (19Vogt W. Schmidt G. Von Buttlar B. Dieminger L. Immunology. 1978; 34: 29-40PubMed Google Scholar) revealed that the role of the additional C3b was to bind the substrate C5. Later a more defined structure was proposed in which the additional C3b binds covalently to a specific site on the C4b or C3b subunit of the C3 convertase resulting in the formation of the complexes C3b, C4b, C2a, or C3b2,Bb (16Takata Y.

However, other forms of the enzyme have been shown to be capable of activating C5. Cobra venom factor forms a C5 convertase (CVF,Bb) that contains no additional C3b and is not cell-bound (22Vogel C.W. Müller-Eberhard H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7707-7711Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 23DiScipio R.G. Smith C.A. Müller-Eberhard H.J. Hugli T.E. J. Biol.

The fluid phase alternative pathway C3 convertase (C3b,Bb) has been reported to cleave C5 in the presence of additional free or cell-bound C3b (19Vogt W. Schmidt G. Von Buttlar B. Dieminger L. Immunology. 1978; 34: 29-40PubMed Google Scholar, 25Isenman D.E. Podack E.R. Cooper N.R. J. Immunol. 1980; 124: 326-331PubMed Google Scholar). A covalent dimer of C4b that involves no C3b has been reported to express C5 convertase activity when complexed to C2a (18Masaki T. Matsumoto M. Yasuda R. Levine R.P. Kitamura H. Seya T. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 927-932PubMed Google Scholar, 26Kitamura H. Tsuboi M. Nagaki K. Immunology. 1986; 58: 459-465PubMed Google Scholar). A number of studies have examined the affinity of C5 for the non-enzymatic subunits C3b or C4b in the fluid phase or on surfaces (16Takata Y. Kinoshita T. Kozono H. Takeda J. Tanaka E. Hong K. Inoue K. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 1494-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 17Kinoshita T. Takata Y. Kozono H. Takeda J. Hong K. Inoue K.

In contrast, by examining the K m of the enzyme we have measured the interaction of C5 with only those C3b molecules that are part of functional C5 convertases.Despite the amount of work directed toward discovering the subunit structure of the C5 convertase and the physiological consequences of C5 activation, no study has ever reported the enzymatic properties of the C5 convertase itself. In planning this study, we believed that a kinetic analysis of the C5 convertase would advance our understanding of the mechanism of action of this enzyme and that it might also reveal the functional role of the additional C3b molecule. The data show that the fluid phase monomeric C5 convertase is able to cleave C5 without a second C3b and that its catalytic rate is similar to that of the surface-bound C5 convertase. The surface-bound enzyme was found to have a 17-fold lower K m for C5 than the fluid phase C5 convertase. This increased affinity would lead to a proportional increase in the rate of C5 activation at physiological C5 concentrations. The catalytic rate of the natural surface-bound C5 convertase determined in this study indicates that the cleavage of C5 is one of the slowest enzymatic reactions known. This is most apparent in the turnover number which is one C5 molecule cleaved per 4 min per enzyme at V max.DISCUSSIONStudies of the C5 convertase have been difficult because in its most active form the enzyme is assembled as a multimeric complex on the surface of biological organisms. The complexity of the surface-bound enzyme led us to re-examine the ability of monomeric C3b to form a fluid phase C5 convertase. Although this enzyme is known as a C3 convertase, not a C5 convertase, C3b,Bb was found to cleave C5. A comparison of its C5 convertase activity (Table I) with the published C3 convertase parameters (41Pangburn M.K. Müller-Eberhard H.J. Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 723-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) revealed that at plasma concentrations of C3 and C5, and in the absence of control factors, this C3/C5 convertase would cleave approximately 9000 C3 for each C5 cleaved. Nevertheless, this weak C5 convertase activity was found to be significant and similar to that of the more biologically relevant surface-bound enzyme.The use of monomeric C3b to form a more structurally defined C5 convertase was valuable for comparison with the surface-bound C5 convertase in which C3b was deposited in clusters. Determination of enzyme concentration was straightforward for the homogeneous fluid phase C3b but more difficult with ZymC3b. The concentration of surface-bound C5 convertase was estimated by measuring the number of Bb molecules bound (Fig. 2). The C3b concentration on zymosan was also measured by a less accurate but independent method utilizing factor H and radiolabeled C3b binding (34Pangburn M.K. Müller-Eberhard H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 2416-2420Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) and was found to be similar within the errors of these methods. In the fluid phase, every C3b was considered to form a C5 convertase, and saturating concentrations of factors B and D were used in all assays. Purified C3b was determined to be greater than 95% active in assays examining cleavage by factors H and I (not shown) and was electrophoretically and chromatographically homogeneous. For these reasons we are confident that the measured C5 convertase concentration accurately reflects the true concentration of the enzyme. Any error in these determinations would inversely affect the k cat values reported here, but theK m values would not be affected.The alternative pathway C5 convertase is an unstable complex due to the rapid dissociation of its catalytic subunit, Bb. It has an extremely short half-life (t½ = 1.5 min, Fig. 1 B). Substituting Ni2+ for Mg2+stabilized the enzyme by 5–7-fold. Nevertheless, enzyme decay had the potential to significantly affect the assays. To overcome this difficulty preliminary experiments were done to determine the concentrations of factors B and D that would continuously replace the decaying Bb subunit of the enzyme. Fig. 1 C shows that these concentrations were sufficient to maintain a constant level of enzyme throughout an assay. Other assays showed that no higher level of enzyme could be attained by increasing factors B and D further. An additional factor that could have affected the assays was the decay accelerating activity of trace concentrations of factor H. It was found that as little as 10 ng of factor H/ml in the assays caused a significant change in activity. As a result, all purified proteins were passed over anti-H-Sepharose in order to reduce the final concentration of factor H in the assays to less than 1/250,000 of the concentration in plasma.Measurement of the kinetic constants of the fluid phase and surface-bound C5 convertases revealed that the major difference between the two forms of the enzyme was not in the catalytic rates of the enzyme but in the affinity for the substrate, C5 (Table I). The naturally occurring surface-bound C5 convertase had a 17-fold higher affinity for C5 than its free form as indicated by theirK m values presented in Table I (1.4 μmfor surface-bound and 24 μm for the soluble form of the enzyme). It may be pointed out that the two forms of the C5 convertase have identical catalytic subunits, Bb, that decay at similar rates. It was therefore not surprising to find that the two forms of the enzyme had catalytic rates that were approximately 2-fold apart.Although no other studies have examined the interaction of C5 convertase with its substrate C5, several groups have measured the binding affinity of C5 for C3b and have reported binding constants (K d) that vary from 0.005 to 2.1 μm(16Takata Y.

The highest affinity (0.005 μm) reported has been for the binding of C5 to C3b molecules deposited in clusters on sheep erythrocytes (16Takata Y. Kinoshita T. Kozono H. Takeda J. Tanaka E. Hong K. Inoue K. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 1494-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 17Kinoshita T. Takata Y. Kozono H. Takeda J. Hong K. Inoue K. J Immunol. 1988; 141: 3895-3901PubMed Google Scholar). Although K dand K m are not always comparable, our measurements of the K m for the surface-bound C5 convertase (ZymC3b,Bb) indicate that the majority of the enzymes have affinities for C5 that are 2 orders of magnitude weaker than the highest reported affinity. Binding constants reported by two other groups are in better agreement with our findings. DiScipio (27Discipio R.G. Biochem. J. 1981; 199: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 40Discipio R.G. Biochem. J. 1981; 199: 485-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) has described aK d of 0.18 μm for C5 binding to C3b on zymosan, and Isenman et al. (25Isenman D.E. Podack E.R. Cooper N.R. J. Immunol. 1980; 124: 326-331PubMed Google Scholar) have reported aK d of 2.1 μm for C5 and free C3b. These binding constants were all determined at physiological ionic strength and indicate that surface-bound C3b has a 12-fold greater affinity for C5 than does soluble monomeric C3b. These results are in agreement with our findings of a 17-fold difference in theK m values of these two forms of the C5 convertases. An explanation for the difference between surface-bound and free C3b was provided by Hong and co-workers (17Kinoshita T. Takata Y. Kozono H. Takeda J. Hong K. Inoue K. J Immunol. 1988; 141: 3895-3901PubMed Google Scholar, 42Hong K. Kinoshita T. Pramoonjago P. Kim Y.U. Seya T. Inoue K. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 1868-1873PubMed Google Scholar) and Kinoshita and co-workers (16Takata Y. Kinoshita T. Kozono H. Takeda J. Tanaka E. Hong K. Inoue K. J. Exp.

Presumably the low K mvalue obtained for the surface-bound C5 convertase in this study was due to C3b-C3b complexes on the surface of zymosan, but nothing in this study allows us to draw any conclusions about the structures of surface-bound C5 convertases.The effect of increasing C3b concentration on the activity of the free form of the C5 convertase (Fig. 6) suggests that a soluble monomeric C5 convertase can cleave a C5 bound to it without the help of a second C3b. Our data are in excellent agreement with the straight line shown in Fig. 6 that represents the reaction mechanism for an enzyme-substrate complex involving one C3b (Reaction 1). These findings are in contrast to the conclusion reached by Isenman et al.(25Isenman D.E. Podack E.R. Cooper N.R. J. Immunol. 1980; 124: 326-331PubMed Google Scholar) that an extra C3b is required for C5 cleavage by a fluid phase enzyme. In their study it is possible that the supplemental C3b formed sufficient additional fluid phase enzyme to cleave enough C5 to be detected on SDS gels. Other workers (14Medicus R.G. Schreiber R.D.

Med. 1974; 139: 44-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) also had difficulty in measuring the C5 cleaving activity of the fluid phase enzyme. An explanation for this could be our observation that the fluid phase C3/C5 convertase cleaves only one C5 for every 9000 C3 cleaved at physiological concentrations of C3 and C5.The normal plasma concentration of C5 (70 μg/ml, 0.37 μm) is only one-third the K m reported for the surface-bound C5 convertase (1.24 μm). This suggests that under physiological conditions the surface-bound C5 convertase will function at only one-fifth its maximum velocity (V max). However, many human cells synthesize the complement components C5-C9 (44Hetland G. Johnson E. Aasebo U. Scand. J. Immunol. 1986; 24: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 45Rothman B.L. Contrino J. Merrow M. Despins A. Kennedy T. Kreutzer D.L. Immunopharmacol. Immunotoxicol. 1994; 16: 525-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Thus, C5 concentrations at the local site of injury or near stimulated immune cells may be considerably higher than the plasma concentration of C5. Because the surface-bound C5 convertase operates at one-fifth itsV max with normal C5 concentrations, there exists the potential for a 5-fold increase in the rate of C5 activation if local C5 concentrations increase.The natural, surface-bound C5 convertase exhibited an extremely low turnover number of 0.23 C5/min/enzyme at 37 °C (Table I). This turnover number of the enzyme is about 5 orders of magnitude slower than that of a typical enzyme such as ribonuclease A which has a turnover number of 8.4 × 104/min (46Santoro S.W. Joyce G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4262-4266Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). The rate of catalysis of the convertase is approximately 10-fold less than that of the catalytic RNA enzymes called ribozymes which cleave RNA. These enzymes have turnover numbers of about 2/min (46Santoro S.W. Joyce G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4262-4266Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). The catalytic rate of the C5 convertase also falls within the range of DNA enzymes that cleave RNA (turnover numbers from 3.4 to 0.03/min) (46Santoro S.W. Joyce G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4262-4266Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar) and engineered enzymes such as catalytic antibodies (turnover numbers from 5 to 0.0003/min) (47Barbas III, C.F. Heine A. Zhong G. Hoffmann T. Gramatikova S. Björnestedt R. List B. Anderson J. Stura E.A. Wilson I.A. Lerner R.A. Science. 1997; 278: 2085-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). This makes the C5 convertase one of the slowest natural protein enzymes reported. Apparently, the biological function of complement is well served by this level of activity which has been preserved during the evolution of the complement system.The C3 convertase activity of the fluid phase enzyme C3b,Bb is well established, and its kinetic properties have been characterized (41Pangburn M.K. Müller-Eberhard H.J. Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 723-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Now that we have demonstrated the ability of this fluid phase C3 convertase to cleave C5, the kinetic properties of the enzyme both as a C5 and a C3 convertase can be compared. As discussed earlier the fluid phase C3 convertase can cleave about 9000 C3 molecules for every C5 under physiological conditions. The surface-bound enzyme would be approximately 10 times more active at plasma concentrations of C3 and C5. The resulting ratio is within 5-fold of that found experimentally using model activators and serum (48Bhakdi S. Fassbender W. Hugo F. Carreno M.-P. Berstecher C. Malasit P. Kazatchkine M.D. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 3117-3122PubMed Google Scholar). The biological relevance for this 900-fold difference in cleavage of C3 versus C5 on surfaces could be that a very large number of C3b molecules are required for opsonization of biological particles, although apparently many fewer C5b molecules are sufficient for cytolysis of pathogenic organisms. Likewise, C5a, the second product of the C5 convertase, is a potent biological effector at extremely small concentrations, whereas higher levels of production of the anaphylatoxin may cause unwanted systemic responses. C5 convertases are serine proteases that cleave C5, the fifth component of complement. The cleavage of C5 is the last enzymatic step in the complement activation cascade resulting in the formation of two biologically important fragments, C5a and C5b. 1The abbreviations used are: C3b and C5b, the proteolytically activated form of C3 and C5, respectively; Ec, chicken erythrocytes; VBS, Veronal-buffered saline; GVB, gelatin-containing veronal-buffered saline; C3b,Bb, free form of the C5 convertase; ZymC3b, C3b bound to zymosan particles; ZymC3b,Bb, surface-bound C5 convertase; RIA, radioimmunoassay. 1The abbreviations used are: C3b and C5b, the proteolytically activated form of C3 and C5, respectively; Ec, chicken erythrocytes; VBS, Veronal-buffered saline; GVB, gelatin-containing veronal-buffered saline; C3b,Bb, free form of the C5 convertase; ZymC3b, C3b bound to zymosan particles; ZymC3b,Bb, surface-bound C5 convertase; RIA, radioimmunoassay. Both fragments play vital roles in killing microorganisms. C5a, the smaller fragment, is a potent chemotactic and spasmogenic anaphylatoxin. It mediates inflammatory responses by stimulating neutrophils and phagocytes. C5b, the larger fragment, initiates the formation of the membrane attack complex (C5b-9) which results in the lysis of bacteria and other pathogens. Although complement has important functions in host defense, it also contributes to the pathology in many inflammatory diseases (1Rother K. Rother K. Till G.O. Hänsch G.M. The Complement System. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1998: 462-471Google Scholar), in xenotransplant rejection (2Dalmasso A.P. Rother K. Till G.O. Hänsch G.M. The Complement System.

Toxicol. 1994; 34: 17-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This has prompted a search for inhibitors that can control activation of C5. Specific inhibition of C5 activation would preserve the immune clearance and opsonization functions of complement which depend on C3b, but it would prevent the generation of both C5a and C5b-9.

We mapped the transcriptional repression domains to the 200 amino acid repeat regions common to all human and mouse family members. We also demonstrate that wild type IFI 16 can repress transcription of a reporter gene containing the minimal promoter region of the human cytomegalovirus UL54 gene.

IFI 16 mRNA and protein are absent from myeloid leukemia cells lines such as HL-60, K562, and U937, but are strongly induced by IFN 2The abbreviations used are: IFN, interferon; pRb, retinoblastoma protein; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; CMV, cytomegalovirus; HCMV, human cytomegalovirus; IR1, inverted repeat 1; bp, base pair(s). α and γ, retinoic acid, and Me2SO, agents that drive these cells to differentiate along the myeloid lineage (2Dawson M.J.

IFI 16 belongs to a family of homologous IFN-inducible human and mouse proteins known as the HIN-200 family (hemopoietic IFN-inducibleNuclear/200-amino acid repeat), each composed of at least one common 200-amino acid motif of unknown function (4Dawson M.J.

The related members of this family identified thus far include human MNDA (myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen) (5Duhl D.M. Gaczynski M. Olinski R. Briggs R.C. J. Cell.

Biochemical characterization of IFI 16 showed it to be localized to the nucleus and indicated that the amino-terminal 159 amino acids were necessary and sufficient to bind double-stranded DNA under physiological conditions (3Dawson M.J. Trapani J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 152-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar); however, the sequence specificity of this interaction has not been determined to date. Similarly, the related proteins, MNDA (5Duhl D.M. Gaczynski M. Olinski R. Briggs R.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 141: 148-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), p202 (9Choubey D. Lengyel P. J.

Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1333-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) can also bind DNA and are detected in the nucleus. The tightly regulated hemopoietic expression of IFI 16, coupled with its biochemical features, led to the hypothesis that IFI 16 may have a role in transcription regulation. This postulate was subsequently strengthened by the findings that p202 could interact with the transcriptional regulatory proteins p53 (11Datta B. Li B. Choubey D. Nallur G. Lengyel P. J. Biol.

Biol. 1996; 16: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Binding of p202 to p53, E2F, or AP-1 family members impairs sequence-specific DNA binding by these transcription factors, resulting in a loss of transcriptional activity (11Datta B. Li B. Choubey D.

However, no evidence exists for an “active” role in transcription regulation by any members of the HIN-200 family. The biochemical characteristics of IFI 16, its lineage-specific expression in hemopoietic cells, and induction in response to factors that drive cellular differentiation suggest a possible role in myelopoiesis. The expression and/or activation of certain transcription factors has been shown to induce the maturation of different hemopoietic lineages (15Pevney L. Simon M.C. Robertson E. Klein W.H. Tsai S.-F.

Cell. 1994; 79: 143-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). For example, expression of the transcription factor GATA-1 is necessary for erythroid development (15Pevney L. Simon M.C. Robertson E. Klein W.H. Tsai S.-F. D'Agati V. Orki S.H. Costanini F. Nature. 1991; 349: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar), whereas PU.1 and Ikaros have been shown to be required for myelopoiesis (16Scott E.W. Simon M.C. Anastasi J. Singh H. Science. 1994; 265: 1573-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar) and T and B cell commitment (17Georgopoulos K. Bigby M. Wang J.-H. Molnar A. Wu P. Winandy S. Sharpe A. Cell. 1994; 79: 143-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar), respectively. It is also clear, however, that lineage- and stage-specific transcription factors can function in combination to direct accurate hemopoietic development (18Ness S.A. Engel J.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 718-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 19Kowentz-Leutz E. Twamley G. Ansieau S. Leutz A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2781-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Whether IFI 16 is necessary and/or sufficient to regulate hemopoietic differentiation in a manner similar to factors such as GATA-1 or PU.1 remains unclear, but as a first step we set out to determine a possible role for IFI 16 in transcriptional regulation. We chose to study the putative transcription modulating activity of IFI 16 in two systems. First, we expressed IFI 16 as a fusion protein with the yeast GAL4 DNA binding domain to direct IFI 16 to promoters containing consensus GAL4 DNA elements. We demonstrate that IFI 16 can function as a transcriptional repressor even when positioned approximately 1 kilobase pair downstream from the site of transcription initiation. The strength of repression by IFI 16 was illustrated in that binding to just one GAL4 site upstream of the promoter resulted in substantial activity. Significantly, we mapped the repression activity to either of the two 200-amino acid regions within IFI 16. These domains are common to all human and mouse family members, and thus it is possible that transcriptional repression may be a function of other related proteins. Second, we examined whether IFI 16 plays a role in regulating expression of the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) DNA polymerase (UL54) gene. The minimal UL54 promoter contains a novel 8-bp inverted repeat element (IR1) that is capable of binding cellular proteins necessary for activation of UL54 by the viral immediate-early transcription factors IE72 and IE86 (20Kerry J.A. Priddy M.A. Stenberg R.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4167-4176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent analysis showed that the transcription factor SP1, and IFI 16, can be copurified by DNA affinity chromatography using the region of the UL54 promoter containing the IR1 (21Luu P. Flores O. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6683-6691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore tested for the effect of IFI 16 expression on a reporter gene containing the wild type UL54 minimal promoter. We showed that recruitment of wild type IFI 16 to the UL54 minimal promoter also results in transcriptional repression, indicating that the repression function of IFI 16 is not confined to the GAL4-IFI 16 fusion protein. This study is the first to assign a molecular function to any of the human members of this gene family and provides impetus to further examine the transcriptional regulatory function(s) and cellular differentiation properties of these molecules. pGAL4-tk-CAT and ptk-CAT were described previously (22Shi Y. Seto E. Chang L.S. Shenk T. Cell. 1991; 67: 377-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). pGAL4-IFI 16 was constructed by cloning full-length human IFI 16 cDNA in-frame into the pSG424 vector (23Ma J. Ptashne M. Cell. 1987; 50: 137-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), which expresses the GAL4 (amino acids 1–147) DNA binding domain. pGAL4-IFI 16 1–125 was produced by digesting IFI 16 cDNA with BamHI andSacI and subcloning into the pSG424 vector digested withBamHI and SacI. Plasmids pGAL4 IFI 16 1–201, 1–401, 1–518, 191–729, 191–400, and 509–729 were generated by polymerase chain reaction using the IFI 16 forward primer and appropriate reverse primers indicated below. Amplified DNA was digested with BamHI and KpnI and subcloned into theBamHI and KpnI sites of pSG424. The identities of all constructs were confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequence analysis. The p5×GAL4UAS−760, p5×GAL4UAS+1000, 3×GAL4-tk-CAT, and 1×GAL4-tk-CAT reporter constructs were described previously (24Madden S.L. Cook D.M. Rauscher F.J.I. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1713-1720PubMed Google Scholar). The pCMV-IFI 16 expression plasmid was constructed by cloning full-length IFI 16 cDNA into the pRcCMV vector (Invitrogen), and the pPolCAT and pIRMCAT reporter plasmids were described previously (20Kerry J.A. Priddy M.A. Stenberg R.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4167-4176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sequences for oligonucleotides were as follows: IFI 16 forward primer, 5′-CCGGATCCTTATGTCTGTAAAGATG-3′; 201 reverse primer, 5′-GGGTACCTTCGAGAACATTTCTTCT-3′; 401 reverse primer, GGGTTACCGCTCTTGGGGTCATTGT-3′; 518 reverse primer, 5′-GGGTACCTGGGCACTGTCTTCTA-3′; 729 reverse primer, 5′- GGGTACCATCGTCAATGACATCCAG-3′; 191 forward primer, 5′-CCGGATCCAGGTAACTCCCAGAAGAA-3′; 509 forward primer, 5′-CCGGATCCCAAGACTGAAGACTGAA-3′. HeLa or 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. The cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (22Shi Y. Seto E. Chang L.S. Shenk T. Cell. 1991; 67: 377-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). The total amount of DNA was adjusted with the plasmid pSP72 to be identical for each transfection. Cells were harvested 48 h after addition of the precipitate. All transfection assays were carried out with at least two independent DNA preparations and were repeated between three and five times. Whole cell extracts were prepared from transfected cells. CAT activity was assayed as described (22Shi Y. Seto E. Chang L.S. Shenk T. Cell. 1991; 67: 377-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar) and quantitated with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Appropriate amounts of cell extracts were used to measure CAT activity to ensure that the assays were performed within linear range. Nuclear lysates were prepared from cells transfected with various GAL4-IFI 16 effector plasmids by the Dignam method (25Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by electrophoresis through a 10% polyacrylamide gel, transferred onto Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and probed with monoclonal anti-GAL4 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Blots were incubated with a 1:10,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-mouse antibody (Dako, Carpinteria, CA), and immunoreactive proteins were visualized by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire UK). Earlier characterization of IFI 16 showed that this protein is specifically expressed in the nucleus and the amino-terminal 159 amino acids of IFI 16 could bind double-stranded DNA. These properties are characteristics of transcription factors, and thus we sought to determine a possible transcriptional regulatory role for IFI 16. Full-length IFI 16 was fused to the yeast GAL4 DNA binding domain (amino acids 1–147). This truncated form of GAL4 can bind with high affinity to the GAL4 consensus DNA sequence but has little or no effect on transcription (23Ma J. Ptashne M. Cell. 1987; 50: 137-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). GAL4-IFI 16 and the GAL4-tk-CAT reporter plasmid, containing five copies of the GAL4 binding site arranged in tandem approximately 150 bp upstream of the CAT reporter gene, were cotransfected into HeLa cells, and the effect on CAT expression was determined. Expression of GAL4-IFI 16 resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in CAT expression with a maximal 5-fold decrease in CAT activity observed after transfection with 3 μg of GAL4-IFI 16 (Fig. 1, lanes 1–3). As a specificity control, GAL4 alone was cotransfected with GAL4-tk-CAT, and this resulted in a slight increase in CAT activity (Fig. 1, lanes 4 and 5). Thus, IFI 16 could efficiently repress CAT activity when bound upstream of the reporter gene. Cotransfection of GAL4-IFI 16 with the reporter plasmid tk-CAT, which is devoid of GAL4 binding elements, did not result in any change in CAT activity (Fig. 1,lanes 6 and 7). Similarly, expression of GAL4 did not effect CAT expression from the tk-CAT reporter plasmid (Fig. 1,lane 8). Similar results were also observed in human 293 cells and murine NIH 3T3 cells (data not shown), indicating that repression by IFI 16 was not cell type- or species-dependent. We have shown that GAL4-IFI 16 can repress transcription of a reporter gene when the GAL4 binding sites are positioned approximately 150 bp upstream of the cap site (Fig. 1). To determine whether GAL4-IFI 16 could function as a repressor when bound at a distance from the thymidine kinase promoter, reporter constructs containing GAL4 sites 760 bp upstream of the cap site (5×GAL4UAS−760) and 1000 bp downstream of the cap site (5×GAL4UAS+1000) were used. GAL4-IFI 16 could repress transcription of a reporter gene when the GAL4 binding sites were positioned 760 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site (Fig. 2). This repression was dose-dependent and reached a maximum of approximately 5-fold repression upon cotransfection of 3 μg of GAL4-IFI 16 plasmid with the 5×GAL4UAS−760 reporter plasmid (Fig. 2,lanes 1–3). No effect on this reporter plasmid was seen upon expression of GAL4 DNA binding domain alone (Fig. 2, lanes 4 and 5). Thus, IFI 16 can function as a transcriptional repressor when positioned at least 760 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site. Similarly, GAL4-IFI 16 also repressed CAT expression when the GAL4 binding sites were positioned 1000 bp downstream of the transcription start site (Fig. 2, lanes 6–8). Cotransfection of 1–3 μg of GAL4-IFI 16 with the 5×GAL4UAS+1000 reporter plasmid caused a similar decrease in CAT activity as was seen with the GAL4-tk-CAT and 5×GAL4UAS−760 reporter plasmids. Repression by GAL4-IFI 16 was dependent on the GAL4-IFI 16 fusion protein being positioned at the thymidine kinase promoter, because an effect on a reporter construct without GAL4 binding sites was not observed (data not shown). Many transcriptional activators function synergistically when bound to multiple sites within a given promoter (26Pascal E. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1646-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). To analyze possible synergistic repression by GAL4-IFI 16, the CAT reporter plasmids 5×GAL4-tk-CAT, 3×GAL4-tk-CAT, and 1×GAL4-tk-CAT containing 5, 3, and 1 GAL4 binding elements, respectively, approximately 150 bp upstream of the CAT gene were used. As shown in Fig. 1, GAL4-IFI 16 could significantly decrease CAT activity from a reporter plasmid containing five GAL4 sites (Fig. 3,lanes 1–3). GAL4-IFI 16 similarly repressed CAT expression from the 3×GAL4-tk-CAT reporter in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3, lanes 5–7). Significant repression by GAL4-IFI 16 on a plasmid containing only one GAL4 binding element was still observed, although 2-fold less than when five or three GAL4 binding sites were present in the reporter plasmid (Fig. 3, lanes 9–11). Thus GAL4-IFI 16 can still significantly repress transcription when only one GAL4 binding site is present in the promoter region upstream of CAT and does not appear to function in a synergistic manner. To determine whether a specific region of IFI 16 was responsible for the observed repression function of GAL4-IFI 16, we produced COOH- and NH2-terminal deletion mutants of IFI 16 fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain and assayed for repression activity using the GAL4-tk-CAT and tk-CAT reporter plasmids (Fig. 4 A). As shown previously, full-length IFI 16 fused to GAL4 caused a dose-dependent decrease in CAT activity with a maximal 5-fold decrease observed upon transfection of 3 μg of GAL4-IFI 16 (Fig. 4 B, lanes 2 and 3). To determine the contribution of the carboxyl terminus of IFI 16 to its repression function, deletion mutants were constructed by polymerase chain reaction. Cotransfection of GAL4-IFI 16(1–125) and GAL4-IFI 16(1–201) containing the IFI 16 amino-terminal 125 and 201 amino acids, respectively, did not significantly affect CAT expression (Fig. 4 B, lanes 4–7). However GAL4-IFI 16 fusion proteins containing the 200-amino acid A repeat (GAL4-IFI 16(1–401)) or the 200-amino acid A repeat plus the hinge region (GAL4-IFI 16(1–518)) could clearly function as transcriptional repressors (Fig. 4 B, lanes 8–11). Both of these fusion proteins mediated similar repression at the highest concentration of transfected effector plasmid to that seen with full-length IFI 16. To assess the effect of removing the amino-terminal DNA binding domain of IFI 16, constructs containing the A and B 200-amino acid repeats separated by the hinge domain (191–729), the A repeat only (191–400), or the B repeat only (509–729) were used in transfection studies. As shown in Fig. 4 C, either the A (lanes 5 and6) or B (lanes 7 and 8) repeat of IFI 16 is capable of active repression when fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain. Surprisingly, when both the A and B repeats separated by the hinge region were fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain, no transcriptional repression was observed (Fig. 4 C,lanes 3 and 4). The repression activities of GAL4-IFI 16(1–729), GAL4-IFI 16(1–401), GAL4 or IFI 16(1–518), GAL4-IFI 16(191–400), and GAL4-IFI 16(509–729) were dependent on the fusion proteins being targeted to the promoter region of the GAL4-tk-CAT reporter plasmid, as no effect was observed on the tk-CAT reporter (data not shown). Expression of the IFI 16 deletion mutants fused to GAL4 was determined by Western blot of nuclear lysates from cells transfected with the different effector plasmids. All eight fusion proteins were expressed in the nucleus at similar levels as determined by Western analyses, with an anti-GAL4 monoclonal antibody (Fig. 4 D). These data therefore indicate that IFI 16, like many transcription factors, contains physically distinct DNA binding and transcriptional regulatory domains. To determine whether wild type IFI 16 can also repress transcription, we used the pPolCAT reporter plasmid containing the minimal promoter region of the HCMV DNA polymerase (UL54) gene (20Kerry J.A. Priddy M.A. Stenberg R.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4167-4176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) found to bind IFI 16 (21Luu P. Flores O. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6683-6691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The HCMV DNA polymerase promoter contains a novel 8-bp inverted repeat 1 element (IR1), and mutation of the wild type IR1 element abrogates UL54 promoter activity and abolishes binding of cellular protein(s) to the IR1 (20Kerry J.A. Priddy M.A. Stenberg R.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4167-4176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Luu P. Flores O. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6683-6691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cotransfection of the IFI 16 expression plasmid with pPOLCAT in 293 cells resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in CAT activity (Fig. 5 A,lanes 2 and 3), whereas cotransfection with the empty CMV expression vector had no effect (Fig. 5 A,lanes 4 and 5). We also tested for the effect of IFI 16 on the pIRMCAT reporter plasmid, which contains a 4-bp functional mutation in the IR1 (20Kerry J.A. Priddy M.A. Stenberg R.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4167-4176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cotransfection of CMV-IFI 16 or CMV alone with pIRMCAT resulted in little or no change CAT activity (Fig. 5 B), indicating that a functional IR1 element is necessary for transcriptional repression by IFI 16. IFI 16 is a well characterized member of the HIN-200 family of proteins, but up until now the molecular function(s) of this molecule were unknown. Some of the physical characteristics of IFI 16, such as its induction by α and γ IFN, its strong nuclear localization, and its ability to bind to DNA through its amino terminus hinted at a possible role in transcription regulation. In light of the circumstantial evidence indicating a possible role of IFI 16 in transcription, and because it had been shown that the related mouse protein, p202, could modulate the activity of known transcription factors (11Datta B. Li B. Choubey D. Nallur G. Lengyel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27544-27555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 12Choubey D. Lengyel P. J. Biol.

Biol. 1996; 16: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), we set out to analyze the gene regulation effect of IFI 16. We initially used the GAL4 model system, utilizing the heterologous GAL4 DNA binding domain fused to IFI 16 as an effector protein and GAL4-tk-CAT or tk-CAT reporter plasmids. This region of GAL4 is transcriptionally inert, being neither capable of activating nor repressing transcription. GAL4-IFI 16 could strongly repress transcription of a reporter gene in a dose-dependent manner, and this repression effect was dependent on IFI 16 being tethered to DNA within the promoter region. The strength of IFI 16-mediated transcriptional repression was demonstrated in two separate experiments. First, IFI 16 could specifically repress transcription when bound approximately 760 bp upstream or 1000 bp downstream from the transcription start site. The extent of repression was similar to that seen when IFI 16 was bound only 150 bp upstream of the transcription start site. This is in contrast to the transcriptional repressor WT1, which in the same system shows greatly decreased repression activity when positioned further upstream or downstream of the CAT reporter gene (24Madden S.L. Cook D.M. Rauscher F.J.I. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1713-1720PubMed Google Scholar). Second, GAL4-IFI 16 could significantly repress transcription when only a single GAL4 binding element was present in the promoter region. As GAL4 binds DNA as a dimer, this indicates that as few as two IFI 16 molecules positioned at a given promoter are sufficient to negatively regulate gene transcription. As with many transcriptional activators, proteins capable of repressing transcription are often modular proteins with distinct regions capable of binding DNA, interacting with other cellular and viral proteins, and actively repressing transcription (27Hanna-Rose W. Hansen U. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 229-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Proteins that actively repress are, by definition, thought not to act by competing with transcriptional activators for access to a particular DNA element, but function by direct interaction with components of the basal transcription machinery or transcriptional activators (27Hanna-Rose W. Hansen U. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 229-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). As such, these proteins should be able to function as transcriptional repressors when fused to a heterologous DNA binding domain and brought to a promoter that contains the appropriate consensus DNA site. IFI 16 joins a growing list of proteins capable of active repression. Some of these proteins such as YY1 (22Shi Y. Seto E. Chang L.S. Shenk T. Cell. 1991; 67: 377-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar) and WT1 (28Rauscher III, F. Morris J.F. Tournay O.E. Cook D.M. Curran T. Science. 1990; 250: 1259-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) are capable of binding DNA in a sequence-specific manner, whereas others such as mSin3A and mSin3B (29Schreiber-Augs N. Chin L. Chen K. Torres R. Rao G. Guida P. Skoultchi A. DePinho R.A. Cell. 1995; 80: 777-786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 30Ayer D.E. Lawrence Q.A. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1995; 80: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) and the yeast Tup 1/SSn6 (31Keleher C.A. Redd M.J. Schultz J. Carlson M. Johnson A.D. Cell. 1992; 68: 709-719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar) proteins interact with DNA-binding proteins and are thereby brought to a particular promoter. IFI 16 can bind to double-stranded DNA and could be eluted by similar salt elution protocols as those used for known sequence-specific transcription factors (3Dawson M.J. Trapani J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 152-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar); however, specific DNA elements that can bind IFI 16 have yet to be identified and are currently under investigation. Recently it was shown that SP1 and IFI 16 can be copurified by DNA affinity chromatography using a region of the HCMV DNA polymerase (UL54) promoter necessary for gene activation by the HCMV immediate-early proteins IE72 and IE86 (21Luu P. Flores O. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6683-6691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cotransfection of full-length IFI 16 and a CAT reporter gene containing the minimal wild type UL54 promoter results in repression by IFI 16, indicating that the repression results seen with GAL4-IFI 16 may also hold true when wild type IFI 16 is bound to DNA. It is presently unknown whether IFI 16 and SP1 physically interact. However, it has been shown that a wild type IR1 element within the minimal UL54 promoter is necessary for both SP1 binding (21Luu P. Flores O. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6683-6691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and IFI 16-mediated transcriptional repression as shown herein. In addition, activation of the UL54 promoter by HCMV immediate-early proteins requires binding of cellular proteins to the IR1 (20Kerry J.A. Priddy M.A. Stenberg R.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4167-4176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Luu P. Flores O. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6683-6691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but IE-86 does not interact with DNA-bound SP1 (21Luu P. Flores O. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6683-6691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible, therefore, that IE86 and/or IE72 can interact with IFI 16 or a complex consisting of IFI 16 and SP1 bound to the IR1 to activate the UL54 promoter. Studies to address this hypothesis are currently under way. As with p202, IFI 16 can also bind to the transcriptional regulatory proteins p53 and pRb, both in vitro and in vivo, 3R. W. Johnstone and J. A. Trapani, manuscript in preparation. and might therefore also modulate the transcriptional activities of these and other gene regulatory proteins. The effect of IFI 16 binding to p53 and pRb is currently under investigation; however, both p53 and Rb are themselves capable of active repression (1Magnaghi-Jaulin L. Groisman R. Naguibneva I. Robin P. Le Villain J.P. Troalen F. Trouche D. Harel-Bellan A. Nature. 1998; 391: 601-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar, 32Weintraub S.J. Chow K.N. Luo R.X. Zhang S.H. He S. Dean D.C.

Nature. 1998; 391: 587-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar), giving rise to the possibility that the mechanism of repression by IFI 16 may involve corepressors such as p53 and/or Rb. To determine the region(s) of IFI 16 capable of actively repressing transcription, we performed deletion mutagenesis and fused the truncated portions of IFI 16 to GAL4. Consistent with IFI 16 being an active repressor, the amino-terminal, DNA binding region was incapable of affecting transcription when fused to GAL4. However a larger protein that also contained the first of the 200-amino acid repeat regions common to this family of proteins was capable of repressing transcription to a similar degree as seen with full-length IFI 16. This indicates that a repression domain of IFI 16 could reside within this 200-amino acid repeat. Expression of the A or B 200-amino acid repeat of IFI 16 fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain was sufficient to induce transcriptional repression. However, expression of the carboxyl-terminal 539 amino acids (containing the A repeat, the B repeat, and the hinge region) fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain did not result in transcriptional repression. This unexpected result could not be explained by poor expression or nuclear localization as GAL4-IFI 16(191–729) was expressed to a similar degree as the other fusion proteins used in this study. It is possible that removal of the amino-terminal 190 amino acids results in a conformational change deleterious for IFI 16's transcriptional repression function. Thus, repression by IFI 16 may be dependent on the conformation of the protein. This may be important given our recent findings that at least three different IFI 16 protein isoforms exist because of alternative RNA splicing. 4R. W. Johnstone and J. A. Trapani, unpublished observations. The splice variants encode proteins with a longer or shorter hinge region, thereby changing the distance between the A and B 200-amino acid repeats and possibly changing the conformation of the molecule. The biological significance of the transcriptional repression function of IFI 16 is still unknown. However its proposed role in hemopoiesis and our recent finding that IFI 16 can suppress cell growth4 may indicate that IFI 16 could act in a similar manner to other transcription factors such as GATA-1 and PU.1, which control cell growth and differentiation by regulating key cellular genes (15Pevney L. Simon M.C. Robertson E. Klein W.H. Tsai S.-F. D'Agati V. Orki S.H. Costanini F. Nature. 1991; 349: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar, 16Scott E.W. Simon M.C. Anastasi J. Singh H. Science. 1994; 265: 1573-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar). In addition, the exciting finding that IFI 16 may regulate HCMV DNA polymerase expression leads to the hypothesis that IFI 16 may play a key role in HCMV infection. Clearly, the cellular genes whose expression may be regulated by IFI 16 need to be identified. This study is the first to show a molecular function for a human member of the HIN-200 family of proteins. Studies on the related murine protein p202 have shown it capable of modulating the transcriptional activities of well defined transcription factors such as E2F, p53, c-Jun, and c-Fos by inhibiting binding to their consensus DNA elements (11Datta B.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2781-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). However, p202 can also inhibit transcriptional activation by NFκB without any effect of the ability of NFκB to bind DNA (14Min W. Ghosh S. Lengyel P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Thus, ranscriptional repression may be a property of other HIN-200 family members, and studies to address this are currently being undertaken. We thank Dr. Y. Shi and Dr. F Rauscher III for useful reagents and Drs. M. J. Smyth and S. M. Russell for helpful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2057763577,"The light-harvesting chlorophyll a/bprotein CP24, a minor subunit of the photosystem II antenna system, is a major violaxanthin-binding protein involved in the regulation of excited state concentration of chlorophyll a. This subunit is poorly characterized due to the difficulty in isolation and instability during purification procedures. We have used an alternative approach in order to gain information on the properties of this protein; the Lhcb6 cDNA has been overexpressed in bacteria in order to obtain the CP24 apoprotein, which was then reconstituted in vitro with xanthophylls, chlorophylla, and chlorophyll b, yielding a pigment-protein complex with properties essentially identical to the native protein extracted from maize thylakoids. Although all carotenoids were supplied during refolding, the recombinant holoprotein exhibited high selectivity in xanthophyll binding by coordinating violaxanthin and lutein but not neoxanthin or β-carotene. Each monomer bound a total of 10 chlorophyll a plus chlorophyllb and two xanthophyll molecules. Moreover, the protein could be refolded in the presence of different chlorophylla to chlorophyll b ratios for yielding a family of recombinant proteins with different chlorophyll a/bratios but still binding the same total number of porphyrins. A peculiar feature of CP24 was its refolding capability in the absence of lutein, contrary to the case of other homologous proteins, thus showing higher plasticity in xanthophyll binding. These characteristics of CP24 are discussed with respect to its role in binding zeaxanthin in high light stress conditions. The spectroscopic analysis of a recombinant CP24 complex binding eight chlorophyll b molecules and a single chlorophylla molecule by Gaussian deconvolution allowed the identification of four subbands peaking at wavelengths of 638, 645, 653, and 659 nm, which have an increased amplitude with respect to the native complex and therefore identify the chlorophyll babsorption in the antenna protein environment. Gaussian subbands at wavelengths 666, 673, 679, and 686 nm are depleted in the high chlorophyll b complex, thus suggesting they derive from chlorophyll a."

The neural and body wall tissue each express single major Hb components for which the amino acid sequences have been deduced from cDNA and genomic DNA. These 109-residue globins form the smallest stable Hbs known. The globin genes have three exons and two introns with splice sites in the highly conserved positions of most globin genes. Alignment of the sequences with those of other globins indicates that the A, B, and H helices are about one-half the typical length.

The neural and body wall Hbsin situ are half-saturated with O2 at 2.9 and 4.1 torr, respectively. The Hill coefficient for the neural Hb in situ, ∼2.9, suggests that the neural Hb self-associates in the deoxy state at least to tetramers at the 2–3 mm (heme) concentration estimated in the cells. The Hb must dissociate upon oxygenation and dilution because the weight-average molecular mass of the HbO2 in vitro is only about 18 kDa at 2–3 μm heme concentration.

Many nemertean worms express intracellular Hbs in red blood cells, body wall muscle tissue, and neural tissue. We report here the amino acid sequences, gene structure, and oxygen equilibria in situ for both the body wall and the neural tissue Hbs of the marine nemertean,Cerebratulus lacteus. We also propose a role of the neural hemoglobin as an oxygen store. We have used the amino acid sequences of the globins in maximum parsimony analyses to address possible phylogenetic relationships. These Hbs are very small, yet stable, unlike the artificially truncated mini-Mbs (20De Sanctis G. Falcioni G. Giardina B. Ascoli F. Brunori M. J. Mol.

Eighty-four specimens of C. lacteus were purchased from the Department of Marine Resources, Marine Biological Laboratories, Woods Hole, MA, and maintained at 4 °C in the laboratory in 0.45 μm of filtered seawater. Animals used for oxygen-binding experiments were kept a maximum of 2 weeks. Tissue samples needed for protein, RNA, and DNA experiments were dissected from animals within 72 h of delivery, immediately frozen in a dry ice/ethanol bath, and stored at −80 °C. Tissues were prepared for microscopy by relaxing the animals in MgCl2 isotonic to seawater and fixing the head and trunk segments in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 200 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, made isotonic (0.58m) by addition of NaCl. Segments were postfixed in 1.0% osmium tetroxide in the same buffer, dehydrated in an ethanol series, and embedded in Epon 812 resin. Ultrathin sections were stained with methylene blue and examined by light microscopy. Hb-containing tissues were ground in liquid N2, then transferred to 50 mm Tris acetate, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, at 0 °C, followed by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. Brain and lateral nerve tissue extracts are referred to as neural Hb, and body wall muscle extracts are referred to as body wall Hb. Tissue extracts were stored at 0 °C if used immediately or refrozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C. Hbs were purified first by size-exclusion chromatography with G-75-SF Sephadex (Sigma) in a column (12 × 450 mm) equilibrated at 4 °C with 50 mm Tris acetate, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.4 (measured at room temperature). Hb-containing fractions from this column were pooled, dialyzed against 10 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, and concentrated. The Hb was further purified by HPLC anion-exchange chromatography on a Synchropak AX300 column (4.6 × 250 mm), (SynChrom, Inc., Lafayette, IN), initially equilibrated with 10 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, at room temperature. Hbs were eluted from the column with a linear gradient from 0 to 50% of 10 mm Tris acetate, 500 mm sodium acetate, pH 8.0, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Hb fractions, identified by absorbance at 415 nm, were pooled, dialyzed against 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and lyophilized. These Hb samples were resuspended in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water and further purified by RP-HPLC on a Synchropak RP300 C-18 column (4.6 × 250 mm) equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water at room temperature. Globins were eluted by establishing a series of linear gradients from 0 to 80% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 70 min at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. Neural tissue extracts from four animals were analyzed on a size-exclusion column, TSK-30 (4.6 × 300 mm, Bio-Rad), on an LDC Milton Roy CCM automated HPLC system. Extracts and molecular size standards (Sigma, catalog number MW-GF-70) were run at room temperature on the column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, over 15 min at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The standards were bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, β-lactoglobulin, horse heart myoglobin, and cytochrome c. Protein standards and Hb samples were monitored at 235 and 415 nm, respectively. Purified globins were hydrolyzed in 6 n HCl, sealedin vacuo in glass tubes, and hydrolyzed at 110 °C for 24 or 72 h. Amino acid compositions were determined with a Beckman model 121MB analyzer. Amino-terminal sequences of the globins were determined with a model 477A protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Inc.). Both instruments are at the University of Texas Microanalysis Facility. Neural tissue was ground in liquid N2 and dissolved in a solution containing 3 m LiCl, 6 m urea, and 0.2% sodium dodecyl sulfate at 0 °C. Brain homogenate was extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1 v/v/v), and the RNA was precipitated with ethanol and resuspended in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated, sterile, deionized distilled water and stored at −80 °C. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from the total RNA by oligo(dT) affinity chromatography and reverse-transcribed using Moloney-murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). This was followed by extraction with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol, ethanol precipitation of the cDNA, resuspension in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water, and storage at −80 °C. The cDNA was used as a template to amplify globin cDNA in the polymerase chain reaction (PCRTM, Hoffmann-La Roche). Primers were oligo(dT) and a redundant oligonucleotide based on the NH2-terminal residues of the globin (VNWAAV = 5′-GTXAA(T/C)TGGGCXGCXGT-3′). The reaction conditions were 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3 at 25 °C), 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 μg/μl bovine serum albumin, 0.25 μm oligo(dT), 1 μm redundant primer, 200 μm dNTPs, and 2.5 units of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer) in a volume of 100 μl. Reactants were heated to 98 °C for 2 min prior to the addition of enzyme, and amplification was performed for 30 cycles (94 °C, 1.5 min; 45 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 1.5 min (cycles 1–10), and then 2.5 min (cycles 11–30)). PCR products were cloned into the pCR-1000 vector (TA Cloning System, Invitrogen, San Diego). A genomic DNA library was constructed in the Lambda Dash II vector (Stratagene) from BamHI-restricted, size-selected genomic DNA that came from the sperm of a single animal. The library was screened with a 345-bp AccI fragment from the neural globin cDNA PCR product (see “Results”). A genomic clone containing a 25-kb insert that hybridized to the globin cDNA probe was isolated from the library, and several enzyme restriction fragments were subcloned into the SmaI site of pBluescript (Stratagene) for sequencing. Fig. 1 shows the positions of the various clones used to determine the organization and sequence of the genes for neural and body wall globins. The 6-kb HpaI clone (HpaI-6) contained 5.1 kb of a body wall globin gene that was truncated in the first intron of the gene and lacked exon I. Other clones (SphI-7, 7 kb; ClaI-3, 3 kb; andClaI-7, 7 kb) provided additional sequence information (see Fig. 1). The missing exon I region was isolated from genomic DNA by the use of two PCR amplification protocols. The first utilized a redundant primer within exon I and a non-redundant primer from within intron I of the body wall globin gene to amplify the intervening sequence from a template of XhoI-digested genomic DNA yielding fragment TA9 (see Fig. 1). The reaction mixture consisted of 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.8 at 25 °C), 10 mm KCl, 10 mm(NH4)2SO4, 2 mmMgSO4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2.4 μm redundant primer, 0.2 μm non-redundant primer, 400 μmdNTPs, and 2.5 units of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase. The region from intron I into the region 5′ to exon I of the body wall globin gene was amplified in a second PCR reaction using a set of two nested primers from intron I and two primers from the PCR in vitro Single Site Amplification and Cloning System (catalog number TAK R015, Panvera Corp., Madison, WI) in a reaction mix given by the manufacturer.HindIII-digested genomic DNA was used as the template for the reaction which yielded fragment p1-3 (see Fig. 1). All PCR products were subcloned into pUC19 or pCRTMII vector (TA cloning system, Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) for sequencing performed by the dideoxy method using Sequenase 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). A second screening of the genomic DNA library, using the 581-bp cDNA for neural globin, yielded a clone containing an HpaI digestion fragment of 4.5 kb that contained the complete sequence of the neural globin gene except for the first two codons of exon 1 and the adjoining 5′ upstream sequence (clone p42, see Fig. 1). The missing region was obtained with the PCRin vitro Single Site Amplification and Cloning System with a pair of non-redundant, nested primers located in the region of exon 2 and a sample of PstI-digested genomic DNA yielding fragment pP8 (see Fig. 1). A second pair of non-redundant, nested primers from the exon 3 sequence was used to amplify exon 3 and intron 2 of the neuronal globin gene from a sample of XbaI-digested genomic DNA yielding fragment p4-7 (see Fig. 1). The PCR products and fragment p42 were cloned and sequenced as described above. Amino acid sequences of globins were obtained from the literature. Sequences of 22 globins from vertebrate and invertebrate animals (including Cerebratulus), bacteria, protists, algae, plants, and fungi were aligned by eye in a series of steps as follows. First, the 84 conserved residue positions identified by Kapp et al. (23Kapp O.H. Moens L. Vanfleteren J. Trotman C.N.A. Suzuki T. Vinogradov S.N. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2179-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) as shared by all members of the globin family were used for a core alignment that included the conserved CD1 Phe and F8 His. The template of Vinogradov et al. (24Vinogradov S.N. Walz D.A. Pohajdak B. Moens L. Kapp O.H. Suzuki T. Trotman C.N.A. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1993; 106: 1-2Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar) was used to facilitate the identification of conserved hydrophilic or hydrophobic residues at external and internal locations, respectively. This template is a version of template I of Bashford et al.(25Bashford D. Chothia C. Lesk A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 199-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) extended to include invertebrates. This core comprises the shared parts of helices A, B, C, E, F, G, and H. The second step was to fill in the interhelical regions by using known x-ray structures of individual globins where possible (10 out of 22 globins). The helical regions, as identified in the x-ray analyses, were aligned with a minimum number of insertions or deletions in order to maintain the overall tertiary structure. Gaps were confined almost entirely to the loops between helices. Finally, the external/buried/internal classification for individual residues of Fermi and Perutz (26Fermi G. Perutz M.F. Phillips D.C. Richards F.M. Atlas of Molecular Structures 2: Haemoglobin and Myoglobin. Clarendon Press, Oxford1981: 26Google Scholar), originally developed for vertebrate myoglobins and hemoglobins, was taken as an additional template. This template includes both helical and interhelical regions, unlike those of Bashford and Vinogradov (24Vinogradov S.N. Walz D.A. Pohajdak B. Moens L. Kapp O.H. Suzuki T. Trotman C.N.A. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1993; 106: 1-2Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar,25Bashford D. Chothia C. Lesk A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 199-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar), which carry only helical information. The Fermi template helps to identify and preserve the chemical patterns such as the arrangement of polar and non-polar amino acids in interhelical loops. All interhelical regions were expanded just enough to accommodate the longest sequence in these regions. The resulting alignment needed a total of 179 positions for the 22 globins with ∼110 positions common to a majority of sequences. The aligned sequences were analyzed for relationships by employing the maximum parsimony method. All programs involved in this analysis are part of the PHYLIP Program Package, version 3.5, of Felsenstein (27Felsenstein J. PHYLIP, version 3.5. Dept. of Genetics, Univ. of Washington, Seattle1993Google Scholar). The original sequences were bootstrapped either 100 or 1,000 times using the program SEQBOOT (28Felsenstein J. Evolution. 1985; 39: 783-791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The replicate data sets so obtained were analyzed by the program PROTPARS which calculated a corresponding number of unrooted parsimony trees with the use of both the global rearrangement option and the option for a randomized input order of sequences. Finally, the CONSENSE program was used to generate a single majority-rule consensus tree from that population of 100 or 1,000 parsimony trees, with calculated bootstrap support values at each node. The human α-globin sequence was taken as outgroup for rooting the tree because the monophyly of vertebrate myoglobins and hemoglobins is established. The oxygen binding properties of the neural and body wall Hbs were determined in situ by thin layer microspectrophotometry at 15 °C (29Colacino J.M. Kraus D.W. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1984; 79: 363-369Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 30Vandergon T.L. Colacino J.M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1989; 94: 31-39Google Scholar). Hb solutions for in vitro experiments were prepared by homogenizing tissues on ice in 50 mm Tris buffers at various pH values followed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min to remove cellular debris. Tissue for in situ experiments was prepared by cutting a piece of the brain or body wall muscle and rinsing it in a solution of 0.45 μm of filtered seawater at 0 °C buffered with 50 mm Tris at the appropriate pH and containing 20 mm KCN to inhibit cellular respiration. Thin sections were removed from the pieces with a razor blade and placed in a fresh buffer at 0 °C. All oxygen binding experiments were performed at 15 °C. All pH measurements were made at room temperature. Absorbance data from 12 wavelength (nm) pairs (410/420, 425, 430, 435, 440; 415/425, 430, 435, 440; 420/430, 435; 425/435) were used in a two-wavelength method for determining fractional saturation values. The tissue slice pathlength, measured optically, varied between 80 and 240 μm. Mean absorbance changes were 0.050 and 0.183 at 415 and 430 nm, respectively. Between 5 and 7 experiments were performed under each set of conditions. Typically, 40–60 data points were averaged for each of 6 oxygen pressures in each experiment. The combined data for the experiments under each set of conditions were fitted by nonlinear least squares (31Bevington P.R. Data Reduction and Error Analysis for the Physical Sciences. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1969Google Scholar) directly to the Hill equation, y = KPn/(1 + KPn) to estimate n and P 50 (= nth root of K−1). Comparison of the absorption spectra before and after an experiment suggests that Met-Hb formation during an experiment is no more than about 5%. Examination of C. lacteusneural ganglia and lateral nerve cords in fresh tissue shows that the cells surrounding axon bundles are uniformly bright red (HCin Fig. 2, A andB). Microspectrophotometry of this tissue gives the characteristic spectrum of HbO2, which is not detectable within the axonal bundles (AX), although some Hb-containing cells appear to have processes that enter the axonal bundles. Cells within the body wall also express Hb, but at differing concentrations, being most concentrated in the trunk region surrounding the gonadal sacs where it may aid in the delivery of oxygen to the developing gametes. The concentration of Hb in the neural ganglia of the brain was estimated by dissecting out the brains from two animals and analyzing the entire extracts by size-exclusion HPLC. Integration of the absorption peaks at 415 nm yielded 1.1 and 1.7 nmol of Hb for the two extracts. We assumed a millimolar extinction coefficient of 131 at 415 nm, the value for human HbO2 (32Van Assendelft O.W. Spectrophotometry of Haemoglobin Derivatives. 1970; (Royal VanGorcum, Assen): 57Google Scholar). The volume of the brain shown in Fig. 2 A would be completely contained within a sphere of radius 600 μm and volume 0.9 μl. This, then, provides an upper limit to the brain volume and provides a minimal concentration of 1.2–1.9 mm. The actual concentration must be substantially higher because the volume of 0.9 μl includes parts of the foregut, rhynchocoel, and the axonal tissue itself, none of which have Hb. We conclude that the concentration is at least 2–3 mm and could be significantly higher. This estimate is comparable to the 2.1–2.8 mm values for myoglobin found in the muscles of seals, porpoises, and tuna (33Andersen H.T. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 46: 212-243Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 34Blessing M.H. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1971; 41: 475-480Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 35Wittenberg B.A. Wittenberg J.B. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1990; 19: 217-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). A single major globin protein fraction was isolated from neural tissue extracts in a three-step chromatographic procedure (Fig. 3, A–C). The body wall Hb also gave a single major peak in the first two chromatographic steps, but RP-HPLC of the Hb fraction showed several minor peaks (Fig. 3 D), raising the possibility of additional Hbs in this tissue. NH2-terminal sequences of neural and body wall globins were determined (43 and 45 residues, respectively) and found to share 79% amino acid sequence identity (Fig. 4). The first eight residues of both globins are identical (VNWAAVVD), allowing us to construct a redundant oligonucleotide primer directed at both globin genes (see “Experimental Procedures”). Use of this primer and oligo(dT) permitted the amplification and cloning of a 581-bp cDNA fragment that encodes the complete sequence of a globin from the neural tissue (Fig. 5). Five clones were completely sequenced and found to be identical in the coding region, but they possessed some differences in the 3′ non-coding region. The amino acid sequence determined by direct sequencing was DFY at residues 9–11 but was EL-STOP in the PCR-generated cDNA clones (Figs. 4 and 5). We conclude that the EL-STOP sequence is the result of errors in amplification and/or cloning because the neural globin genomic DNA sequence (Fig. 6) matches the direct determination of residues 1–42. An additional difference is that the cDNA sequence has Leu at position 56, whereas the genomic DNA gives Ile for this position.Figure 4Comparison of C. lacteus globin sequences. The underlined sequences were determined both by direct sequence analysis and from cDNA (neural) or genomic DNA (neural and body wall). Boxed residues 9–11 (neural) were not correct in the cDNA (see text) but were obtained both by direct sequencing and from genomic DNA. Vertical bars mark the differences between the two globins.

This sequence matches the first 45 NH2-terminal residues determined directly (Fig. 4). The gene contains three exons separated by two introns. Intron 1 separates exons 1 and 2, splitting a Glu codon (residue 13) corresponding to position B12 in both neural and body wall globins. Intron 2 separates exons 2 and 3 between codons for His-80 (G6) and Asn-81 (G7) in neural globin and Thr-80 (G6) and His-81 (G7) in body wall globin. The positions of the 5′ and 3′ splice junctions are identical in both genes (Figs. 6 and 7) and match those found for typical globins (36Hardison R.C. Selander R.K. Clark A.G. Whittam T.S. Evolution at the Molecular Level. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1991: 272-333Google Scholar). The two globin sequences are 78% identical and are clearly derived by duplication of an ancestral gene. The amino acid compositions of neural and body wall globins are compared in Table I with those deduced from DNA. The agreement is within 5–7% for the neural globin except for Cys and Trp, which are partially destroyed by acid hydrolysis, and Val. The low Val value presumably results from difficulty in cleaving the Val-Val bond between residues 6 and 7. The analysis of body wall globin shows greater deviations with unexplained high Ser and low Ala values.Table IAmino acid composition of C. lacteus globinsAmino acidNeural globin composition (n = 3)Body wall globin composition (n = 4)Aspartic acid13.9 (13)11.1 (11)Glutamic acid6.2 (6)6.0 (6)Serine6.1 (6)6.0 (4)Glycine12.5 (12)9.2 (10)Histidine6.0 (6)3.4 (4)Arginine1.9 (2)3.6 (3)Threonine1.9 (2)5.1 (5)Alanine21.8 (21)20.7 (26)Proline2.7 (2)4.4 (3)Tyrosine3.8 (4)3.5 (4)Valine4.2 (6)7.1 (9)Half-cystine1.2 (2)1.9 (2)Isoleucine2.9 (3)3.2 (3)Leucine8.5 (9)6.5 (7)Phenylalanine4.8 (5)5.4 (6)Lysine9.2 (9)5.4 (5)Tryptophan0.4 (1)0.4an = 2 for this number.

https://openalex.org/W2062690889,"Progressive renal diseases lead to prolonged glomerular hypertension, which induces the proliferation of mesangial cells. This proliferation is thought to be involved in the development of renal injury. Here we investigate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation and cell proliferation in mesangial cells under conditions of high pressure. After pressure-load, the phosphorylation level of MAPK (at Tyr-204) increases rapidly with a peak at 1 min, although the amount of MAPK remains almost constant during pressure-load. To confirm the activation of MAPK, we carried out an immunoprecipitation-kinase assay. MAPK activity during pressure-load shows kinetics similar to that of the tyrosine phosphorylation. In contrast, c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) phosphorylation falls below basal levels in response to high pressure. Immunocytochemical observations show phosphorylated MAPK in the nucleus at 10 min. The expression of c-Fos, a nuclear transcription factor, is induced by high pressure, and the induction is significantly inhibited by PD98059 (50 μm), an upstream MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor of MAPK. The expression of the c-Jun that is induced by JNK1 activation remains unchanged during pressure-load. MAPK phosphorylation and cell proliferation by applied pressure are significantly inhibited by genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor in a dose-dependent manner, but not by protein kinase C inhibitors, chelerythrine and GF109203X. Genistein also blocks pressure-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins with molecular masses of 35, 53, and 180 kDa. To clarify the physiological role in MAPK activation under high pressure conditions, we transfected antisense MAPK DNA into mesangial cells. The antisense DNA (2 μm) inhibited MAPK expression by 80% compared with expression in the presence of sense or scrambled DNA, and significantly blocked pressure-induced cell proliferation. Treatment of cells with MEK inhibitor also produced a similar result. MEK inhibitor strongly suppresses DNA synthesis induced by pressure-load. Cyclin D1 expression is significantly increased under high pressure conditions, and the increase is blocked by treatment with MEK inhibitor. These findings show that pressure-load, a novel activator of MAPK, induces the activation of tyrosine kinases, and enhances the proliferation of mesangial cells, probably through cyclin D1 expression. Progressive renal diseases lead to prolonged glomerular hypertension, which induces the proliferation of mesangial cells.

Mesangial cells in glomeruli are located under a fenestrated capillary endothelium and are exposed to hydrostatic pressure necessary to sustain normal filtration (1Kriz W. Elger M. Mundel P.

This indicates that MAPK serves as an important regulator of transcriptional activity related to proliferation. Recently, Lavoie et al. (27Lavoie J.N. L'Allemain G. Brunet A. Muller R. Pouyssegur J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 20608-20616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar) reported that cyclin D1 expression, which is one of the earliest cell cycle-related events to occur during the G0/G1 to S phase transition, is regulated positively by MAPK. Therefore, increasing interest has been paid to the role of MAPK in the cell cycle (28Takeda T. Toda T. Kominami K. Kohnosu A. Yanagida M. Jones N.

We recently showed that pressure enhances G1/S progression and promotes the rate of DNA synthesis in mesangial cells (31Kawata Y. Fujii Z. Sakumura T. Kitano M. Suzuki N. Matsuzaki M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1401: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, MAPK activation and its physiological effects in glomerular hypertension are presently unknown. We investigated MAPK activation and cell proliferation in mesangial cells using a pressure-loading apparatus. We show here that applied pressure is a novel activator of MAPK. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MAPK activation plays a role in pressure-induced proliferation, probably via cyclin D1 expression. Anti-phospho-MAPK antibody (Tyr-204), anti-phospho-Elk-1 (Ser-383) antibody, Elk-1 fusion protein, and PD98059 (MEK inhibitor) were bought from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Anti-phospho-JNK1 antibody (Thr-183 and Tyr-185), anti-JNK1 antibody, anti-MAPK antibody, anti-c-Fos antibody, anti-cyclin D1 antibody, peptide substrate of myelin basic protein (APRTPGGRR), and protein A/G-agarose were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-c-Jun antibody and anti-phospho-tyrosine antibody were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Anti-rabbit and anti-mouse immunoglobulin G antibodies coupled to peroxidase were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). Anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G antibody-linked fluorescein isothiocyanate was from Amersham International plc (Buckinghamshire, UK). The enhanced chemiluminescence reaction assay kit and PKC assay kit were from Pierce. Cell growth was estimated with a cell counting kit (Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan), which is a modified MTT assay kit using WST-1. Genistein, chelerythrine, and GF109203X were from Calbiochem-Novabiochem International (San Diego, CA). All other chemicals were commercially available. Rat mesangial cells were isolated as described previously (31Kawata Y. Fujii Z. Sakumura T. Kitano M. Suzuki N. Matsuzaki M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1401: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 32Harper P.A. Robinson J.M. Hoover R.L. Wright T.C. Karnovsky M.J. Kidney Int. 1984; 26: 875-880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Mesangial cells were plated at a density of 5 × 105 cells/dish in 100-mm culture dishes. After incubation in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium for 72 h, the cells were placed for the indicated times under high pressure conditions at 37 °C. High pressure conditions were applied using a pressure-loading apparatus allowing for several levels of air pressure under constant O2 and CO2 concentration and temperature as described previously (31Kawata Y. Fujii Z. Sakumura T. Kitano M. Suzuki N. Matsuzaki M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1401: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For each time period, cells were collected with a rubber policeman and used for biochemical analyses. The collected cells were lysed with lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmβ-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, leupeptin (1 μg/ml), 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride). The cellular extracts and molecular mass standards were electrophoresed in 12.5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels in the presence of SDS and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (0.45 μm, Millipore, Bedford, MA) in the case of phospho-MAPK and phospho-Elk-1, or nitrocellulose membranes for other proteins. The blots were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% (w/v) Tween 20, and incubated with antibody. After the blots were washed, the antigens were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescent detection reagents. The levels of MAPK phosphorylation were determined from the immunoblots by densitometric analysis and were corrected for amounts of MAPK protein. MAPK activity was determined as described previously (23Mizukami Y. Yoshida K. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 785-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were lysed in lysis buffer and clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein content was normalized, and the lysates were incubated with anti-phospho-MAPK antibody followed by protein A/G-agarose. The complexes were washed twice in lysis buffer and twice in kinase buffer (25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mmMgCl2). Kinase reactions were carried out by resuspending the complexes in 50 μl of kinase buffer containing 100 μm ATP and 1 μg of Elk-1, and incubating for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction products were electrophoresed in SDS-polyacrylamide (12.5%) gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and probed with anti-phospho-Elk-1 antibody. As another method, after cell lysates were incubated with anti-MAPK antibody, MAPK activity was measured by incubating cell extracts for 10 min at 30 °C with 1 mm peptide substrate containing the sequence of myelin basic protein phosphorylated by MAPK (APRTPGGRR) in buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 40 μmATP, 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 2 mm protein kinase inhibitor peptide, 0.5 mm EGTA). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.6% HCl, 1 mm ATP, and 1% bovine serum albumin, and the mixture was centrifuged at 3000 ×g for 5 min. The supernatant was spotted onto 1.0 × 1.0-cm squares of P81 paper (Whatman), which was washed five times for 10 min each time with 0.5% phosphoric acid, rinsed once with ethanol, dried, and counted by the Cerenkov technique (33Saunier B. Tournier C. Jacquemin C. Pierre M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3693-3697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). PKC activity was measured with a colorimetric PKC assay kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mesangial cells were seeded in a Chamber Slide (Lab-Tek, Nunc Inc., Naperville, IL) at a density of 3 × 104 cells/well. The cells were subjected to 70 mm Hg high pressure for 10 min and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate- buffered saline (PBS) for 15 min at 4 °C. Following fixation, the cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min and blocked with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) in PBS for 30 min. The cells were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with antibody against phospho-MAPK at 1:100 dilution in PBS containing 0.1% sheep serum albumin, washed with PBS, and incubated for an additional hour at room temperature with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G antibody at 1:100 dilution in PBS. The cells were viewed with a fluorescence microscope (Axioplan 2, Carl Zeiss Co., Heidelberg, Germany). Oligonucleotide transfection was determined as described previously (34Sale E.M. Atkinson P.G. Sale G.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 674-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Briefly, the phosphorothioate oligonucleotide with the sequence 5′-GCC GCC GCC GCC GCC AT-3′ was synthesized as an antisense DNA. Control phosphorothioate oligonucleotides were synthesized with the following sequences: 5′-ATG GCG GCG GCG GCG GC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CGC GCG CTC GCG CAC CC-3′ (scrambled). The cells (typically 80% confluent in 24-well dishes) were washed three times with PBS. Appropriate dilutions of oligonucleotides in 200 μl of serum-free RPMI 1640 including liposomes (Tfx-50, Promega Co.) were preincubated at room temperature for 15 min. The cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2. At the end of the incubation period, 1 ml of medium containing 10% FCS was added. After incubating for 48 h, the cells were reseeded in 96-well dishes, and incubated with serum-free medium for 24 h after washing with 500 μl of PBS. After a further 24 h the medium was replaced with medium containing 0.5% FCS. After incubation under high pressure conditions, cell number was estimated by WST-1 assay. The densitometric measurements were done with plate analyzer (ETY3A, Toyo Sokki Co., Kanagawa, Japan). DNA synthesis was estimated with an immunocytochemical assay kit using monoclonal anti-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) antibody to detect BrdUrd incorporation into cellular DNA (RPN 20, Amersham International). Briefly, growing cells were seeded in chamber slides at a density of 3 × 104/well (0.81 cm2/well). The cells were incubated with serum-free medium for 24 h and then incubated with 0.5% FCS, RPMI 1640 medium under high pressure conditions. After 24 or 48 h, BrdUrd was added to each sample for 30 min, and the cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde after washing with PBS. After incubation with anti-BrdUrd antibody for 60 min and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin G antibody for 30 min, BrdUrd incorporation was visualized with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride as a substrate according to the manufacturer's instructions. BrdUrd-positive cells and total cells (200–300 cells) in 10 fields that were selected randomly in each sample were counted, and the proportion of positive cells to total cells was calculated. MAPK is activated through the phosphorylation of Thr-202 and Tyr-204 by MEK (13Nishida E. Gotoh Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 128-131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar, 35Crews C.M. Alessandrini A. Erikson R.L.

Nature. 1988; 334: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). We initially examined the phosphorylation of MAPK in mesangial cells under high pressure conditions by immunoblotting with an antibody that recognizes phosphorylation at Tyr-204 in MAPK. In pressure-treated cells, their level of MAPK phosphorylation was significantly increased at 1 min after pressure-load as compared with untreated cells (Fig. 1, A and C). The amount of MAPK remained almost constant throughout pressure-load (Fig. 1 B). To confirm MAPK activation by high pressure, we examined MAPK activity by an immunoprecipitation kinase assay using Elk-1 as a substrate. MAPK activity rose rapidly after pressure-load with almost the same kinetics as MAPK phosphorylation (Fig. 2, A and B). To further confirm MAPK activation by high pressure, we carried out another kinase assay using myelin basic protein as described under “Experimental Procedures.” MAPK activity with MAPK immunoprecipitates and myelin basic protein peptide, significantly increased (6-fold) with similar kinetics to MAPK phosphorylation and MAPK activity using Elk-1 as a substrate (data not shown). When mesangial cells were exposed to high pressure (30, 50, 70, or 90 mm Hg) or to atmospheric pressure (0 mm Hg), the level of MAPK phosphorylation increased in a pressure-dependent manner (Fig. 3, A and C). The amount of MAPK remained almost constant in each lane (Fig. 3 B). These findings show that MAPK is activated by tyrosine phosphorylation in mesangial cells under high pressure conditions. It is known that JNK1, a member of the MAPK superfamily, is activated by phosphorylation by SEK1 in response to various stresses (38Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A.

Nature. 1994; 372: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). We measured the level of JNK1 phosphorylation necessary for activation by immunoblotting with an anti-phospho-JNK1 antibody. As shown in Fig. 4 A, JNK1 was already phosphorylated under the control conditions, and the level of phosphorylation was rather lower during pressure-load, although the amount of JNK1 remained almost unchanged during pressure-load (Fig. 4 B). These results indicate that JNK1 phosphorylation decreases during pressure-load.Figure 2MAPK activity in rat mesangial cells under high pressure conditions. Cell extracts (600 μg of protein) were prepared from mesangial cells exposed to 70 mm Hg high pressure for the indicated times and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-phospho-MAPK antibody followed by protein A/G-agarose. The complexes were incubated with 100 μm ATP and 1.0 μg of Elk-1, and subjected to immunoblotting with anti-phospho-Elk-1 antibody (A).

A representative immunoblot from three independent experiments is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To investigate upstream kinases in the pressure-induced MAPK activation, we examined the MAPK phosphorylation in the presence of inhibitors for PKC and tyrosine kinases. Genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, inhibited pressure-induced MAPK phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5, A and C). However, chelerythrine and GF109203X, PKC inhibitors, did not affect MAPK phosphorylation (Fig. 5, A and C). The amount of MAPK was almost constant in each lane (Fig. 5 B). Furthermore, to confirm the effect of genistein, we examined tyrosine phosphorylation with immunoblotting using anti-phospho-tyrosine antibody. Applied pressure induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins with molecular masses of 35, 53, and 180 kDa, and the tyrosine phosphorylation was inhibited by genistein (Fig. 5 D) in a dose-dependent manner (0.1–10 μm). PKC inhibitors had no effects on the pressure-induced tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 5 D). Genistein also inhibited pressure-induced cell proliferation, whereas PKC inhibitors had no effect (data not shown). PKC activity was weakly increased by applied pressure, the activity of which was blocked by PKC inhibitors, but not by 10 μm genistein (data not shown). These findings suggest that tyrosine kinases are involved in the pressure-induced MAPK activation. MAPK substrates are present in various subcellular fractions (21Lenormand P. Sardet C. Pages G. L'Allemain G. Brunet A. Pouyssegur J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 22Gonzalez F.A. Seth A. Raden D.L. Bowman D.S. Fay F.S. Davis R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1089-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). To examine the physiological effect of MAPK under high pressure conditions, we observed the subcellular localization of MAPK by immunocytochemical staining using an anti-phospho-MAPK antibody. Immunocytochemical observations showed the phosphorylated MAPK to be present mainly in the cytoplasm 1 min after pressure-load (data not shown), and the nuclear staining was significantly increased after 10 min of pressure-load (Fig. 6,C and D). The staining was not observed under control conditions (atmospheric pressure) (Fig. 6, A andB) and was inhibited by preincubating the primary antibody with activated MAPK (data not shown). These findings suggest that MAPK has a physiological effect on the nucleus. It is known that MAPK in the nucleus can phosphorylate Elk-1 (24Janknecht R. Ernst W.H. Pingoud V. Nordheim A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5097-5104Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar), a transcription factor, and that this phosphorylation subsequently leads to an increase in the expression of c-Fos (42Gille H. Sharrocks A.D. Shaw P.E. Nature. 1992; 358: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). We examined the expression of c-Fos under high pressure conditions by immunoblotting and found it to be significantly increased for 12 h after pressure-load (Fig. 7, A andB). This increase was inhibited by treatment with 50 μm MEK inhibitor (Fig. 8,A and B). In addition, antisense DNA against MAPK, as described below, also inhibits pressure-induced c-Fos expression (data not shown). On the other hand, the expression of c-Jun, a nuclear transcription factor that is induced by JNK activation, remained almost unchanged under 70 mm Hg pressure for up to 48 h (Fig. 9). These observations demonstrate that applied pressure induces the expression of c-Fos via the activation of MAPK.Figure 8Effect of MEK inhibitor on c-Fos expression in mesangial cells under high pressure conditions. Cell extracts (40 μg of protein) were prepared from the mesangial cells exposed to 70 mm Hg high pressure for 24 h in the presence or absence of MEK inhibitor (50 μm PD98059) and subjected to immunoblotting with anti-c-Fos antibody (A).

We examined whether tyrosine 221, which has been shown to be phosphorylated by c-Abl, was phosphorylated also by other tyrosine kinases, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor. For this purpose, we developed an antibody that specifically recognizes Tyr221-phosphorylated CrkII, and we demonstrated that CrkII was phosphorylated on Tyr221 upon EGF stimulation. When NRK cells were stimulated with EGF, the tyrosine-phosphorylated CrkII was detected at the periphery of the cells, where ruffling is prominent, suggesting that signaling to CrkII may be involved in EGF-dependent cytoskeletal reorganization. The EGF-dependent phosphorylation of CrkII was also detected in a c-Abl-deficient cell line. Moreover, recombinant CrkII protein was phosphorylated in vitro by EGF receptor. These results strongly suggest that EGF receptor directly phosphorylates CrkII. Mutational analysis revealed that the src homology 2 domain was essential for the phosphorylation of CrkII by EGF receptor but not by c-Abl, arguing that these kinases phosphorylate CrkII by different phosphorylation mechanisms. Finally, we found that the CrkII protein phosphorylated upon EGF stimulation did not bind to the phosphotyrosine-containing peptide and that CrkII initiated dissociation from EGF receptor within 3 min even with the sustained tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF receptor. This result implicated phosphorylation of Tyr221 in the negative regulation of the src homology 2-mediated binding of CrkII to EGF receptor.

The cellular homologs of v-Crk have been identified in man, mouse, rat, and frog, suggesting its fundamental role for eukaryotic cell activity. Recent reports have implicated Crk in mitogenic signaling, cell adhesion, and apoptosis (reviewed in Ref. 2Matsuda M. Kurata T. Cell.

CrkI consists of the SH2 and SH3 domains, whereas CrkII has an additional SH3 domain at the carboxyl terminus. The SH2 domain of Crk has been shown to bind to phosphotyrosine-containing proteins of 70, 120, and 130 kDa in v-Crk-transformed cells (1Mayer B.J. Hamaguchi M. Hanafusa H.

Apart from these major binding proteins, Abl family tyrosine kinases and Sos, a guanine nucleotide exchange protein for Ras, are also known to bind to SH3(N) (18Wang B.L. Mysliwiec T. Feller S.M.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar).A peculiar feature of CrkII is that unlike other adaptor proteins such as Grb2 and Nck, CrkII itself is phosphorylated on tyrosine. c-Abl, which binds to SH3(N) of CrkI and CrkII, phosphorylates both CrkI and CrkII (20Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 22Ren R. Ye Z. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). In CrkII, tyrosine 221, which is absent in CrkI, is the site of phosphorylation by c-Abl. It has been proposed that the SH2 domain of CrkII binds intramolecularly to the phosphorylated Tyr221 and that it inhibits the intermolecular interactions mediated by both the SH2 and SH3 domains of CrkII (20Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Consistent with this proposal, interaction of the phosphorylated Tyr221 and the SH2 domains has been demonstrated by NMR spectroscopic analysis (23Rosen M.K. Yamazaki T. Gish G.D. Kay C.M. Pawson T. Kay L.E. Nature. 1995; 374: 477-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been shown that the intramolecular binding of the SH2 domain and phosphorylated Tyr221 induces a conformational change in the SH2 domain, which uncovers an SH3 binding motif in an extended DE loop of the Crk SH2 domain. This observation has attributed another function to the binding between SH2 and phosphorylated Tyr221 (24Anafi M. Rosen M.K. Gish G.D. Kay L.E. Pawson T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21365-21374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).CrkII is phosphorylated on tyrosine upon many types of stimulation (2Matsuda M. Kurata T. Cell. Signalling. 1996; 8: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Growth factors such as EGF, nerve growth factor, insulin-like growth factor-I, and sphingosin 1-phosphate induce tyrosine phosphorylation of CrkII (25Beitner-Johnson D. Le Roith D. J. Biol.

However, it has not been known whether, under these circumstances, CrkII is phosphorylated also on Tyr221 and by c-Abl. In addition, the role of tyrosine phosphorylation of CrkII in these signaling pathways is not clear. To address these questions, we have developed an antibody that specifically recognizes the CrkII protein phosphorylated on Tyr221, and we found that the EGF receptor directly phosphorylates CrkII on Tyr221. Furthermore, we observed that the phosphorylation of Tyr221 of CrkII correlated with its dissociation from the EGF receptor, implicating the phosphorylation of Tyr221 in the negative feedback of binding to the EGF receptor.DISCUSSIONWe have shown that EGF induces phosphorylation of CrkII on Tyr221 by using anti-phospho-CrkII antibody and the CrkII-Y221F mutant. The EGF-dependent phosphorylation of Tyr221 was detected even in a mouse cell line lacking Abl, which was originally reported to phosphorylate CrkII on Tyr221 (20Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). A c-Abl-related tyrosine kinase, Arg, also binds to SH3(N) of CrkII (18Wang B.L. Mysliwiec T. Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. Kruh G.D. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1379-1385PubMed Google Scholar). However, the CrkII-associated tyrosine kinase activity was diminished remarkably in the Abl-deficient cell line (20Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), suggesting that Arg does not play a significant role in the phsophorylation of CrkII in these Abl-deficient cells. Further evidence that Abl family kinases are not involved in the Tyr221phosphorylation of CrkII upon EGF stimulation was obtained by mutational analysis. The mutation of the SH3(N) of CrkII strongly decreased the phosphorylation of CrkII by c-Abl but not by EGF stimulation. These observations argue that the EGF receptor itself phosphorylates CrkII upon EGF stimulation.It has been reported that most of the CrkII protein is tyrosine-phosphorylated in HeLa cells (20Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). We found, by using the anti-phospho-CrkII antibody, that CrkII was phosphorylated on Tyr221 in v-Src-transformed but not in v-Crk-transformed or nontransformed 3Y1 cells at a detectable level. In NIH 3T3 cells also, most of the CrkII protein was not phosphorylated on Tyr221without stimulation. We have further screened various human cell lines and found that CrkII phosphorylated on Tyr221 never exceeds 50% of the total CrkII. 2Y. Hashimoto and M. Matsuda, unpublished results. Therefore, in most cell lines, Tyr221 is not phosphorylated in the major fraction of CrkII.The tyrosine phosphorylation site of CrkII serves as a high-affinity binding site to the SH2 domain of CrkII itself (20Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Although both intramolecular and intermolecular binding could be mediated by this phosphotyrosine-SH2 interaction, our results indicate that the intramolecular binding was formed predominantly upon EGF stimulation. This is consistent with a previous report claiming that CrkII phosphorylated by Abl does not bind to the phosphotyrosine-containing peptides (20Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Thus, phosphorylation of Tyr221 of CrkII appears to regulate negatively the SH2-mediated intermolecular binding of CrkII, irrespective of which tyrosine kinase phosphorylates CrkII. This observation is particularly important because many groups have reported the tyrosine phosphorylation of CrkII or of CrkL, another adaptor protein closely related to CrkII, upon various types of stimulation (28Blakesley V.A. Beitner-Johnson D. Van Brocklyn J.R. Rani S. Shen-Orr Z. Stannard B.S. Spiegel S. LeRoith D. J. Biol.

A similar negative feedback mechanism is known for Grb2, although, in this example, phosphorylation is not on the Grb2 itself nor on tyrosine (37Chen D. Waters S.B. Holt K.H. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6328-6332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 38Holt K.H. Waters S.B. Okada S. Yamauchi K. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. Motto D.G. Koretzky G.A. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8300-8306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Stimulation by EGF or insulin resulted in the dissociation of Grb2 from Sos, an SH3-bound guanine nucleotide exchange protein for Ras. Phosphorylation of Sos by MAP kinase, which is activated through Ras, disrupts the binding of Sos to the SH3 domains of Grb2.Dissociation of the SH2-containing molecules from tyrosine kinases may have a positive role in signal transduction. STAT family proteins, which are SH2-containing transcription factors, become tyrosine-phosphorylated upon the stimulation of various cytokines (39Darnell J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3343) Google Scholar). The tyrosine phosphorylation induces the dissociation of STAT family proteins from JAK tyrosine kinases and drives them into the nucleus. We expected a similar translocation of the tyrosine-phosphorylated CrkII protein, because CrkII was detected not only in the cytoplasm but also in the nucleus of COS1 cells (40Matsuda M. Nagata S. Tanaka S. Nagashima K. Kurata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4441-4446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the CrkII protein detected by anti-phospho-CrkII antibody was concentrated mostly at the periphery of the cells and never in the nucleus. This observation implicates tyrosine phosphorylation of CrkII primarily in the negative regulation of signaling from tyrosine kinases. Crk, isolated originally as an oncogene product of the CT10 chicken retrovirus, belongs to the adaptor proteins that consist mostly of the Src homology 2 (SH2) 1The abbreviations used are: SH2, src homology 2; SH3, src homology 3; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, EGF receptor; SH3(N), amino-terminal SH3 domain; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 1The abbreviations used are: SH2, src homology 2; SH3, src homology 3; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, EGF receptor; SH3(N), amino-terminal SH3 domain; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.and SH3 domains (1Mayer B.J. Hamaguchi M. Hanafusa H. Nature. 1988; 332: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). The cellular homologs of v-Crk have been identified in man, mouse, rat, and frog, suggesting its fundamental role for eukaryotic cell activity. Recent reports have implicated Crk in mitogenic signaling, cell adhesion, and apoptosis (reviewed in Ref. 2Matsuda M. Kurata T. Cell. Signalling. 1996; 8: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The mammalian crk gene is translated into two isoforms, designated CrkI and CrkII (3Matsuda M. Tanaka S. Nagata S. Kojima A. Kurata T. Shibuya M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3482-3489Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). CrkI consists of the SH2 and SH3 domains, whereas CrkII has an additional SH3 domain at the carboxyl terminus. The SH2 domain of Crk has been shown to bind to phosphotyrosine-containing proteins of 70, 120, and 130 kDa in v-Crk-transformed cells (1Mayer B.J. Hamaguchi M. Hanafusa H. Nature. 1988; 332: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 4Matsuda M. Mayer B.J. Fukui Y. Hanafusa H. Science. 1990; 248: 1537-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The 70- and 130-kDa proteins have been identified as paxillin and p130cas, respectively (5Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Reichman C. Shoelson S.E. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell.

Apart from these major binding proteins, Abl family tyrosine kinases and Sos, a guanine nucleotide exchange protein for Ras, are also known to bind to SH3(N) (18Wang B.L. Mysliwiec T. Feller S.M.

A peculiar feature of CrkII is that unlike other adaptor proteins such as Grb2 and Nck, CrkII itself is phosphorylated on tyrosine. c-Abl, which binds to SH3(N) of CrkI and CrkII, phosphorylates both CrkI and CrkII (20Feller S.M.

In CrkII, tyrosine 221, which is absent in CrkI, is the site of phosphorylation by c-Abl. It has been proposed that the SH2 domain of CrkII binds intramolecularly to the phosphorylated Tyr221 and that it inhibits the intermolecular interactions mediated by both the SH2 and SH3 domains of CrkII (20Feller S.M.

However, it has not been known whether, under these circumstances, CrkII is phosphorylated also on Tyr221 and by c-Abl. In addition, the role of tyrosine phosphorylation of CrkII in these signaling pathways is not clear. To address these questions, we have developed an antibody that specifically recognizes the CrkII protein phosphorylated on Tyr221, and we found that the EGF receptor directly phosphorylates CrkII on Tyr221. Furthermore, we observed that the phosphorylation of Tyr221 of CrkII correlated with its dissociation from the EGF receptor, implicating the phosphorylation of Tyr221 in the negative feedback of binding to the EGF receptor. DISCUSSIONWe have shown that EGF induces phosphorylation of CrkII on Tyr221 by using anti-phospho-CrkII antibody and the CrkII-Y221F mutant. The EGF-dependent phosphorylation of Tyr221 was detected even in a mouse cell line lacking Abl, which was originally reported to phosphorylate CrkII on Tyr221 (20Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). A c-Abl-related tyrosine kinase, Arg, also binds to SH3(N) of CrkII (18Wang B.L. Mysliwiec T. Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. Kruh G.D. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1379-1385PubMed Google Scholar). However, the CrkII-associated tyrosine kinase activity was diminished remarkably in the Abl-deficient cell line (20Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), suggesting that Arg does not play a significant role in the phsophorylation of CrkII in these Abl-deficient cells. Further evidence that Abl family kinases are not involved in the Tyr221phosphorylation of CrkII upon EGF stimulation was obtained by mutational analysis. The mutation of the SH3(N) of CrkII strongly decreased the phosphorylation of CrkII by c-Abl but not by EGF stimulation. These observations argue that the EGF receptor itself phosphorylates CrkII upon EGF stimulation.It has been reported that most of the CrkII protein is tyrosine-phosphorylated in HeLa cells (20Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). We found, by using the anti-phospho-CrkII antibody, that CrkII was phosphorylated on Tyr221 in v-Src-transformed but not in v-Crk-transformed or nontransformed 3Y1 cells at a detectable level.

We have further screened various human cell lines and found that CrkII phosphorylated on Tyr221 never exceeds 50% of the total CrkII. 2Y. Hashimoto and M. Matsuda, unpublished results. Therefore, in most cell lines, Tyr221 is not phosphorylated in the major fraction of CrkII.The tyrosine phosphorylation site of CrkII serves as a high-affinity binding site to the SH2 domain of CrkII itself (20Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Although both intramolecular and intermolecular binding could be mediated by this phosphotyrosine-SH2 interaction, our results indicate that the intramolecular binding was formed predominantly upon EGF stimulation. This is consistent with a previous report claiming that CrkII phosphorylated by Abl does not bind to the phosphotyrosine-containing peptides (20Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Thus, phosphorylation of Tyr221 of CrkII appears to regulate negatively the SH2-mediated intermolecular binding of CrkII, irrespective of which tyrosine kinase phosphorylates CrkII. This observation is particularly important because many groups have reported the tyrosine phosphorylation of CrkII or of CrkL, another adaptor protein closely related to CrkII, upon various types of stimulation (28Blakesley V.A.

A similar negative feedback mechanism is known for Grb2, although, in this example, phosphorylation is not on the Grb2 itself nor on tyrosine (37Chen D. Waters S.B. Holt K.H. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6328-6332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 38Holt K.H. Waters S.B. Okada S. Yamauchi K. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. Motto D.G. Koretzky G.A.

Stimulation by EGF or insulin resulted in the dissociation of Grb2 from Sos, an SH3-bound guanine nucleotide exchange protein for Ras. Phosphorylation of Sos by MAP kinase, which is activated through Ras, disrupts the binding of Sos to the SH3 domains of Grb2.Dissociation of the SH2-containing molecules from tyrosine kinases may have a positive role in signal transduction. STAT family proteins, which are SH2-containing transcription factors, become tyrosine-phosphorylated upon the stimulation of various cytokines (39Darnell J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3343) Google Scholar). The tyrosine phosphorylation induces the dissociation of STAT family proteins from JAK tyrosine kinases and drives them into the nucleus. We expected a similar translocation of the tyrosine-phosphorylated CrkII protein, because CrkII was detected not only in the cytoplasm but also in the nucleus of COS1 cells (40Matsuda M. Nagata S. Tanaka S. Nagashima K. Kurata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4441-4446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the CrkII protein detected by anti-phospho-CrkII antibody was concentrated mostly at the periphery of the cells and never in the nucleus. This observation implicates tyrosine phosphorylation of CrkII primarily in the negative regulation of signaling from tyrosine kinases. We have shown that EGF induces phosphorylation of CrkII on Tyr221 by using anti-phospho-CrkII antibody and the CrkII-Y221F mutant. The EGF-dependent phosphorylation of Tyr221 was detected even in a mouse cell line lacking Abl, which was originally reported to phosphorylate CrkII on Tyr221 (20Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). A c-Abl-related tyrosine kinase, Arg, also binds to SH3(N) of CrkII (18Wang B.L. Mysliwiec T. Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. Kruh G.D. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1379-1385PubMed Google Scholar). However, the CrkII-associated tyrosine kinase activity was diminished remarkably in the Abl-deficient cell line (20Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), suggesting that Arg does not play a significant role in the phsophorylation of CrkII in these Abl-deficient cells. Further evidence that Abl family kinases are not involved in the Tyr221phosphorylation of CrkII upon EGF stimulation was obtained by mutational analysis. The mutation of the SH3(N) of CrkII strongly decreased the phosphorylation of CrkII by c-Abl but not by EGF stimulation. These observations argue that the EGF receptor itself phosphorylates CrkII upon EGF stimulation. It has been reported that most of the CrkII protein is tyrosine-phosphorylated in HeLa cells (20Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). We found, by using the anti-phospho-CrkII antibody, that CrkII was phosphorylated on Tyr221 in v-Src-transformed but not in v-Crk-transformed or nontransformed 3Y1 cells at a detectable level. In NIH 3T3 cells also, most of the CrkII protein was not phosphorylated on Tyr221without stimulation. We have further screened various human cell lines and found that CrkII phosphorylated on Tyr221 never exceeds 50% of the total CrkII. 2Y. Hashimoto and M. Matsuda, unpublished results. Therefore, in most cell lines, Tyr221 is not phosphorylated in the major fraction of CrkII. The tyrosine phosphorylation site of CrkII serves as a high-affinity binding site to the SH2 domain of CrkII itself (20Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Although both intramolecular and intermolecular binding could be mediated by this phosphotyrosine-SH2 interaction, our results indicate that the intramolecular binding was formed predominantly upon EGF stimulation. This is consistent with a previous report claiming that CrkII phosphorylated by Abl does not bind to the phosphotyrosine-containing peptides (20Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Thus, phosphorylation of Tyr221 of CrkII appears to regulate negatively the SH2-mediated intermolecular binding of CrkII, irrespective of which tyrosine kinase phosphorylates CrkII. This observation is particularly important because many groups have reported the tyrosine phosphorylation of CrkII or of CrkL, another adaptor protein closely related to CrkII, upon various types of stimulation (28Blakesley V.A.

BMPs transduce their effects through binding to two different types of serine/threonine kinase receptors, type I and type II. Signaling by these receptors is mediated by the recently identified Smad proteins. Despite the rapid progress in understanding of the signaling mechanism downstream of BMP receptors, the target genes of BMPs are poorly understood in mammals. Here we identified a novel gene, termedBMP/OP-responsive gene (BORG), in C2C12 mouse myoblast cell line which trans-differentiates into osteoblastic cells in response to BMPs. Expression of BORG was dramatically induced in C2C12 cells by the treatment with BMP-2 or OP-1 within 2 h and peaked at 12–24 h, whereas transforming growth factor-β had a minimal effect. BMP-dependent expression of BORG was also detected in other cell types which are known to respond to BMPs, suggesting that BORG is a common target gene of BMPs. Cloning and sequence analysis of BORG cDNA and the genomic clones revealed that, unexpectedly, the transcript of BORG lacks any extensive open reading frames and contains a cluster of multiple interspersed repetitive sequences in its middle part. The unusual structural features suggested that BORG may function as a noncoding RNA, although it is spliced and polyadenylated as authentic protein-coding mRNAs. Together with the observation that transfection of antisense oligonucleotides of BORG partially inhibited BMP-induced differentiation in C2C12 cells, it is possible that a new class of RNA molecules may have certain roles in the differentiation process induced by BMPs.

For instance, null mutation in the BMP-2 gene leads to defects in amnion/chorion and cardiac development (9Zhang H. Bradley A.

In Xenopusembryos, Smad5 is also able to mediate BMP signaling (25Suzuki A. Chang C. Yingling J.M. Wang X.-F. Hemmati- Brivanlou A. Dev. Biol. 1997; 184: 402-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In activin signaling, Smad2 interacts with the activin-response element ofMix.2, an immediate early activin-response gene, in concert with FAST-1, a novel member of the winged-helix family of putative transcription factor (26Chen X. Rubock M.J. Whitman M. Nature. 1996; 383: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar), whereas DNA-binding partners of Smad1 or Smad5 have yet been unknown in BMP signaling. Certain Smads have been shown to directly bind to DNAs (27Yingling J.M. Datto M.B. Wong C. Frederick J.P. Liberati N.T. Wang X.-F. Mol. Cell.

In order to elucidate how the Smad proteins and other transcription factors function in mediating BMP signals, and whether the signaling pathways not using the Smad proteins are also involved in BMP signaling, it is necessary to identify and analyze the genes directly induced by BMPs.

The mammalian counterparts of these genes may function as direct target genes of BMPs; however, little is known to date in mammals about the BMP-responsive genes except for TGF-β-inducible early gene (TIEG), a putative zinc finger protein which is induced by BMP-2 as well as TGF-β (39Subramaniam M.

In the present study, we report the isolation of a novel gene, termedBMP/OP-responsive gene (BORG), of which expression was regulated by either BMP-2 or OP-1 in BMP-responsive cells. Interestingly, it lacks any extensive open reading frames (ORFs) and contains a cluster of multiple interspersed repetitive sequences in its middle part. A possibility that BORG may function as a noncoding RNA in the BMP-induced differentiation process is discussed. Mouse muscle myoblast C2C12 cells (40Blau H.M. Chiu C.-P. Webster C. Cell. 1983; 32: 1171-1180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar) and mouse embryo fibroblast C3H10T1/2 clone 8 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. ST2 mouse bone marrow stromal cells were obtained from the RIKEN Cell Bank (Tsukuba, Japan). C2C12 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Nissui) containing 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin). When the C2C12 cells were treated with BMP-2, OP-1, or TGF-β, medium was replaced by DMEM containing 5% FBS and antibiotics. C3H10T1/2 cells and ST2 cells were maintained in basal medium Eagle's with Earle's salts (Life Technologies, Inc.) and RPMI 1640 (Nissui), respectively, in the presence of 10% FBS and antibiotics. Total RNA was isolated from the cells by using Isogen (Wako), and poly(A)+ RNA was purified by binding to Oligotex-dT30 Super (Takara Biomedicals) as described by the manufacturer's instructions. C2C12 cells were cultured in DMEM containing 15% FBS to reach confluency; the serum was reduced to 5%, and the cells were allowed to grow in the presence or absence of 300 ng/ml OP-1 for additional 2 h. Poly(A)+ RNA was extracted from the cells, and subjected to digestion with DNase I (MessageClean kit, GenHunter) for 30 min at 37 °C to remove residual contaminated DNA fragments. Poly(A)+ RNA was further purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and precipitated with ethanol. The differential display method (41Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4675) Google Scholar) was performed by using an RNAimage kit (GenHunter). Briefly, 0.2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA purified as above was reverse transcribed in a 20-μl reaction containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 37.6 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μm dNTPs, and 20 μm anchored oligo-dT primer, H-T11M (5′-AAGC(T11)(G/A/C)-3′), for 5 min at 65 °C and for 60 min at 37 °C, followed by 5 min at 75 °C. Murine Moloney leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (100 units) was added after 10 min incubation at 37 °C. PCR reaction was performed in a 20-μl reaction containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.001% gelatin, 2 μm dNTPs, 0.2 μm arbitrary 13-mer (H-AP-1 to -80), 0.2 μm H-T11M, 2 μl of reverse transcription mixture, 1 μl of [α-35S]dATP (1200 Ci/mmol, Amersham), and 1 unit of Taq polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim). PCR conditions were 40 cycles of 94 °C (15 s), 40 °C (2 min), and 72 °C (30 s), followed by 5 min at 72 °C using a Perkin-Elmer 9600 thermocycler. The amplified products were separated on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried and exposed to an autoradiography film (Hyperfilm MP, Amersham). Differentially expressed products were cut out from the gel, extracted with H2O, and reamplified by the same set of primers under the same condition except for the use of 20 μm dNTPs. The secondary amplified products were separated side by side with the primary PCR products on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried and exposed to a film; the secondary amplified product was cut out from the gel, extracted with H2O, subcloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega), sequenced, and used as a probe for Northern blot analysis. Two μg of poly(A)+ RNA was denatured, separated on a 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gel, and blotted onto a nylon filter (Hybond-N, Amersham) with 20 × SSC (1 × SSC is 15 mm sodium citrate, 150 mmNaCl). Subcloned cDNA fragments from differential display and cDNAs for rat osteocalcin and glyceraldehydephosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (gifts of Dr. S. Oida) were labeled with 32P by a Ready-To-Go DNA Labeling Kit (Pharmacia). Hybridization was performed at 43 °C overnight with labeled probe in 5 × SSPE (1 × SSPE is 180 mm NaCl, 10 mmNa2HPO4·7H2O, 1 mmEDTA), 50% formamide, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, 20 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. The filters were washed twice in 2 × SSPE, 0.1% SDS at 43 °C for 15 min, once in 1 × SSPE, 0.1% SDS at 43 °C for 30 min, and once in 0.1 × SSPE, 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 15 min, followed by the analysis using a Fuji BAS 2000 Bio-Imaging Analyzer (Fuji Photo Film). One μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed into single strand cDNA using Superscript Preamplification System (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described by the manufacturer's instructions. PCR was performed in a 50-μl reaction containing 1 × PCR reaction buffer (Boehringer Mannheim), 200 μm dNTPs, 0.2 μm B-S4 primer (5′-TAATGGGACAGCCTAGTAGG-3′), 0.2 μm B-AS4 primer (5′-TCCGTGTAAGAAAGCTGGCC-3′), 1 μl of single strand cDNA solution, and 2.5 units of Taqpolymerase (Boehringer Mannheim). PCR conditions were 94 °C (5 min), 25 cycles of 94 °C (30 s), 55 °C (30 s), and 72 °C (30 s), followed by 10 min at 72 °C. A second round of PCR was performed with 2 μl of the first reaction as a template in the same reaction mixture except for the use of the internal primers, B-SN (5′-CAGCGGCCGCTAACTTGAGTATGTGG) and B-ASX1 (5′-CACTCGAGCTGACTATGATTTGTC-3′) instead of B-S4 and B-AS4. The second PCR conditions were 94 °C (1 min), 15 cycles of 94 °C (30 s), 55 °C (30 s), and 72 °C (30 s), followed by 10 min at 72 °C. Specificity of the PCR products was confirmed by digestion withEcoRI and EcoRV. Primers for the mouse or rat GAPDH (CLONTECH) were also used as loading controls for the RT-PCR procedure. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′-RACE) was performed using a Marathon cDNA Amplification Kit (CLONTECH). Using 1 μg of poly(A)+RNA isolated from OP-1-treated C2C12 cells, a library of adapter-ligated double strand cDNA was constructed as described by the manufacturer's instruction. For the initial attempt to obtain a full-length cDNA of BORG, two sequential antisense primers, B-AS1 (5′-ATCCAAGGTGAGGCCTAGTTCAC-3′) and B-AS2 (5′-CAAGGTGGCCTCAGTGTGGATGC-3′), were designed from the sequence of the cDNA fragment obtained by the differential display. To isolate the 5′-end of BORG cDNA, B-AS6 (5′-ACGGCTGCTGGGATTTAAAC-3′) and B-ASPE (5′-GTGGTAGCTGATCTTGATTGTCAAGCTTGTTGCCC-3′) were designed from the sequence of the 5′-region of the mouse C2C12 cDNA library clone, clone P69 (see below). PCR reaction was performed in a 50-μl reaction containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.2, 14 mm(NH4)2SO4, 1.75 mmMgCl2, 200 μm dNTPs, 0.2 μmB-AS1 primer, 0.2 μm adapter primer 1 (AP1,CLONTECH), 0.5 μl of adapter-ligated double strand cDNA solution, 2.5 units of Taq/Pwo DNA polymerase mixture (Expand Long Template PCR system, Boehringer Mannheim), and 0.3 μg of TaqStart Antibody (CLONTECH). PCR conditions were 94 °C (1 min), followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C (30 s) and 68 °C (4 min). A second round of PCR was performed with 0.5 μl of the first reaction as a template in the same reaction mixture except for the use of B-AS2 primer and nested adapter primer 2 (AP2, CLONTECH) instead of B-AS1 and AP1. The second PCR conditions were 94 °C (1 min), followed by 20 cycles of 94 °C (30 s) and 68 °C (4 min). The PCR product was subcloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega), sequenced, and used as a probe for cDNA library screening. Using poly(A)+ RNA isolated from OP-1-treated C2C12 cells, an oligo(dT)-primed cDNA library with 1 × 106 independent clones was prepared by Uni-ZAP XR/Gigapack II Gold Cloning kit (Stratagene). The unamplified cDNA library was plated and lifted onto nylon filters (Hybond-N, Amersham), and immobilized by UV cross-linking. The duplicate filters were probed with the 32P-labeled 5′-RACE product at 65 °C overnight in the hybridization buffer containing 5 × SSPE, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, 20 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. The filters were washed at 65 °C twice in 2 × SSPE, 0.1% SDS for 15 min, once in 1 × SSPE, 0.1% SDS for 30 min, and once in 0.1 × SSPE, 0.1% SDS for 15 min, followed by autoradiography. The positive clones were isolated and rescued into pBluescript SK(−). Nucleotide sequencing was performed on both strands. One million clones of a 129SV mouse genomic library (Stratagene) were screened with the full-length BORG cDNA as a probe as described above. Phage DNA was isolated from the positive clones and subjected to digestion with appropriate restriction enzymes to generate a physical map. The digested DNA was also probed with various portions of BORG cDNA to determine their location in the genome of BORG. Fragments that hybridized with the probes were subcloned into pBluescript SK(+) for nucleotide sequencing. Antisense oligonucleotides at nucleotide positions from 902 to 921 of BORG cDNA (Fig. 5) were designed to hybridize to BORG RNA. Nucleotide sequences are: antisense, 5′-CCAGGCCACATACTCAAGTT-3′; sense, 5′-AACTTGAGTATGTGGCCTGG-3′. Both were synthesized as phosphorothionate oligonucleotides and high pressure liquid chromatography-purified by Greiner Japan (42Wagner R.W. Nature. 1994; 372: 333-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). For transfection, 5 μm of each oligonucleotide was mixed with 2 μl/ml Tfx-50 (Promega) in DMEM containing 5% FBS, and added to C2C12 cells in the presence or absence of 300 ng/ml BMP-2. Total RNA extraction followed by RT-PCR for detecting the expression of BORG was done 6 h after the transfection as described above. Alkaline phosphatase activity was measured 36 h after the transfection as described previously (43Nishitoh H. Ichijo H. Kimura M. Matsumoto T. Makishima F. Yamaguchi A. Yamashita H. Enomoto S. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21345-21352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). To identify a novel target gene of BMPs, we first examined the OP-1 responsiveness in a mouse myoblast cell line C2C12, which was reported to trans-differentiate into osteoblastic cells in response to BMP-2 (44Katagiri T. Yamaguchi A. Komaki M. Abe E. Takahashi N. Ikeda T. Rosen V. Wozney J.M. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Suda T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1755-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). C2C12 cells were found to start to express osteocalcin mRNA (see below), as well as alkaline phosphatase activity (data not shown), representative markers for osteoblastic phenotype, by 24 h after the treatment with 300 ng/ml OP-1. In contrast, C2C12 cells not treated with OP-1 did not undergo such osteoblastic changes (data not shown), suggesting that C2C12 cells provide a useful system for the differential screening of OP-1-induced gene expression. We applied an mRNA differential display method (41Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4675) Google Scholar) by using poly(A)+RNA obtained from OP-1-treated or -untreated C2C12 cells. The C2C12 cells were maintained in DMEM containing 15% FBS. When the cells reached confluency, the serum was reduced, and the cells were allowed to grow in the presence or absence of 300 ng/ml OP-1 for an additional 2 h. Thereafter, poly(A)+ RNA was extracted, reverse transcribed into first strand cDNA and applied to the PCR-based differential screening using various combinations of arbitrary primers. Differentially expressed products (exemplified in Fig. 1 A) which were observed only in the OP-1-treated material were cut out from the gel, reamplified by the same sets of the primers, and subcloned into plasmid vectors. DNA sequencing of the two differentially displayed clones as shown in Fig. 1 A revealed that they encoded the same gene product with overlapping sequences. When one of the clones, named DD-10, was used as a probe for Northern blot analysis, a major transcript of approximately 3 kilobases was found to be increased in the OP-1-treated material (Fig. 1 B), which confirmed that DD-10 corresponded to an OP-1-induced transcript in C2C12 cells. Together with the following induction data by BMP-2 (see below), the gene for this transcript was denoted BORG. A time course experiment by Northern blot analysis revealed that the expression of BORG was induced as early as 3 h after the addition of OP-1, peaked at 12–24 h, and decreased after 48 h (Figs. 2 and3). While very weak expression of BORG was observed 3–12 h after the reduction of serum even without OP-1 (Fig. 2, OP-1(−) and Fig. 3, control), the extent of expression was much less compared with that observed in OP-1-treated cells. These results strongly suggested that OP-1 specifically induced BORG expression in C2C12 cells. When the same filter was reprobed with osteocalcin cDNA, osteocalcin mRNA was found to be induced 24–48 h after the treatment with OP-1 (Fig. 2), indicating that the expression of BORG precedes osteocalcin induction by OP-1 in C2C12 cells.Figure 3Effects of OP-1, BMP-2, and TGF-β on expression of BORG RNA in C2C12 cells. Confluent C2C12 cells were incubated with DMEM containing 5% FBS in the absence (control) or presence of 300 ng/ml OP-1, 300 ng/ml BMP-2, or 25 ng/ml TGF-β for the indicated time. Poly(A)+ RNA (2 μg) extracted from the cells was applied to Northern blot analysis using BORG PCR fragment clone DD-10 as a probe. The amount of mRNAs was verified by rehybridizing the filters with GAPDH probe (data not shown). Radioactive signals were quantitated on a Fuji BAS2000 Bio-Imaging Analyzer and plotted to give a graphical representation of the results. The amount of each transcript was calculated as relative activity against the background signal and normalized by RNA loading on the gels. Relative changes were calculated by standardizing the 0-h time point as a basal level.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To investigate the ability of other members of TGF-β superfamily to induce BORG expression, we treated C2C12 cells with BMP-2 or TGF-β. BORG was strongly induced by BMP-2 after 12–24 h and decreased after 48 h with a time course similar to OP-1 (Fig. 3). BORG was weakly induced in response to TGF-β; however, TGF-β-induced expression of BORG peaked at 3 h after the treatment and decreased thereafter. Taking the fact into account that TGF-β-induced expression of BORG was weak and transient, it is likely that BORG is a relatively specific target gene for OP-1 and BMP-2 but not TGF-β. To examine whether BMP-induced expression of BORG was a cell-type specific event in C2C12 cells, we tested the expression of BORG by RT-PCR in other cell lines that are known to respond to BMPs. In ST2 mouse bone marrow stromal cells (45Yamaguchi A. Ishizuya T. Kintou N. Wada Y. Katagiri T. Wozney J.M. Rosen V. Yoshiki S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 366-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) and C3H10T1/2 mouse embryo fibroblast (46Katagiri T. Yamaguchi A. Ikeda T. Yoshiki S. Wozney J.M. Rosen V. Wang E.A. Tanaka H. Omura S. Suda T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 172: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), BORG was found to be induced within 1 h after the treatment with BMP-2 (Fig. 4), suggesting that BORG is a common target gene of BMPs in BMP-responsive cells. To obtain a full-length cDNA for BORG, we applied 5′-RACE to poly(A)+ RNA isolated from OP-1-treated C2C12 cells by using two nested antisense primers designed from the sequence of the original PCR clone, DD-10. Specifically amplified products were subcloned into plasmid vectors, and two independent clones were sequenced. These clones encoded overlapping PCR products of 2,528 and 2,455 bp long, but a few nucleotides of these clones were different from each other in the overlapping region probably due to misincorporation of deoxynucleotides during the PCR procedure (data not shown). Next, a cDNA library was constructed using poly(A)+ RNA isolated from OP-1-treated C2C12 cells and probed with the longer 5′-RACE product (2,528 bp). Several overlapping clones were obtained, and a clone, termed P69, yielded a 2,840-bp nucleotide sequence with a polyadenylation signal, AATAAA, followed by a poly(A) tail. The majority of the other clones were found to encode the partial sequence of P69. A few clones, whose inserts were longer than that of P69, appeared to encode premature transcripts since they contained additional intron-like sequences (data not shown). To determine the 5′-end sequence of BORG RNA, we again applied 5′-RACE using two sequential antisense primers designed in the 5′-region of P69 and the cDNA templates used in the initial 5′-RACE. Sequencing of the specifically amplified products yielded an additional six nucleotides at the 5′-end of the cDNA. Thus, the combined nucleotide sequence of the 5′-RACE product and P69 was a putative full-length cDNA for BORG, containing a pol"
https://openalex.org/W2011775975,"The CCAAT-binding activator NF-Y is formed by three evolutionary conserved subunits, two of which contain putative histone-like domains. We investigated NF-Y binding to all CCAAT boxes of globin promoters in direct binding, competition, and supershift electrophoretic mobility shift assay; we found that the alpha, zeta, and proximal gamma CCAAT boxes of human and the prosimian Galago bind avidly, and distal gamma CCAAT boxes have intermediate affinity, whereas the epsilon and beta sequences bind NF-Y very poorly. We developed an efficient in vitro transcription system from erythroid K562 cells and established that both the distal and the proximal CCAAT boxes are important for optimal gamma-globin promoter activity. Surprisingly, NF-Y binding to a mutated distal CCAAT box (a C to T at position -114) is remarkably increased upon occupancy of the high affinity proximal element, located 27 base pairs away. Shortening the distance between the two CCAAT boxes progressively prevents simultaneous CCAAT binding, indicating that NF-Y interacts in a mutually exclusive way with CCAAT boxes closer than 24 base pairs apart. A combination of circular permutation and phasing analysis proved that (i) NF-Y-induced angles of the two gamma-globin CCAAT boxes have similar amplitudes; (ii) occupancy of the two CCAAT boxes leads to compensatory distortions; (iii) the two NF-Y bends are spatially oriented with combined twisting angles of about 100 degrees. Interestingly, such distortions are reminiscent of core histone-DNA interactions. We conclude that NF-Y binding imposes a high level of functionally important coordinate organization to the gamma-globin promoter."

The Na+:HCO3−cotransporter activity was assayed as the Na+ and HCO3−dependent pHi recovery from intracellular acidosis with the use of the pH-sensitive dye 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein. In acid-loaded cells and in the presence of amiloride (to block Na+/H+ exchange), switching to a Na+-containing solution (115 mm) resulted in rapid pHi recovery only in the presence of HCO3−. This recovery was completely abolished by 300 μm 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid. Replacing the Na+ with Li+ (115 mm) caused significant HCO3−-dependent, DIDS-sensitive pHi recovery from intracellular acidosis, with Li+ showing lower affinity than Na+. Potassium (K+) had no affinity for the Na+:HCO3− cotransporter. The Na+-dependent HCO3−cotransport was abolished in the presence of 0.2 mmharmaline. The Na+:HCO3− cotransporter could also function in Na+:OH− cotransport mode, although only at high external pH (7.8).

The purpose of the current study was to examine the functional properties of the human kidney NBC. Accordingly, cultured HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected with the NBC-1 cDNA and studied. HEK-293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin-G and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cultured cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. The medium was replaced every other day. Cultured HEK-293 cells were plated on coverslips and transfected at 60% of confluence with 8 μg of the full-length human NBC-1 cDNA construct (in the cloning/expression vector pCMV.SPORT1) by calcium phosphate-DNA coprecipitation (20Graham F.L. Van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (6492) Google Scholar). Cells were assayed 44–52 h after transfection. Changes in intracellular pH (pHi) were monitored using the acetoxymethyl ester of the pH-sensitive fluorescent dye 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF-AM) as described (21Soleimani M.

HEK-293 cells were grown to confluence on coverslips and incubated in the presence of 5 μm BCECF in a Na+-free solution consisting of 115 mmtetramethylammonium-Cl and 25 mm KHCO3, pH 7.4 (solution A, Table I). pHi was measured in a thermostatically controlled holding chamber (37 °C) in a Delta Scan dual excitation spectrofluorometer (Photon Technology International, South Brunswick, NJ). The monolayer was then perfused with the appropriate solutions (Table I). The fluorescence ratio at excitation wavelengths of 500 and 450 nm was utilized to determine intracellular pH values in the experimental groups by comparison with the calibration curve that was generated by KCl/nigericin technique. The fluorescence emission was recorded at 525 nm. The Na+:HCO3− cotransporter activity was determined as the initial rate of the DIDS-sensitive, Na+-dependent pHi recovery (dpHi/dt, pH/min) in a HCO3−-containing solution following an acid load induced by NH3/NH4+ withdrawal. The experiments were performed in the presence of 1 mmamiloride to block the Na+/H+ exchanger activity. The experiments were repeated in the absence of HCO3− and CO2and bubbled with O2 to determine whether NBC can mediate Na+:OH− (hydroxyl) cotransport. The dpHi/dt was calculated by fitting to a linear equation the first 2 min of the time course of intracellular pH recovery.

Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. BCECF-AM was from Molecular Probes Inc. Nigericin, DIDS, amiloride, and other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Results are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical significance between experimental groups was determined by Student's t test or by one-way analysis of variance. In the first series of experiments, cells were incubated and loaded with BCECF in Na+-free solution (solution A, TableI), exposed to NH4+ for 10 min (solution B, Table I), and acid-loaded by switching to an NH4+-free solution (solution A, TableI). The base-line pHi in sodium-free solution was 7.11 ± 0.02. In the presence of 1 mm amiloride (to block Na+/H+ exchange), switching to a Na+ (115 mm) and HCO3−-containing solution (solution C, Table I) resulted in rapid pHi recovery from acidosis in transfected cells (Fig. 1 A), which was completely inhibited by 300 μm DIDS. The rate of pHi recovery was 0.190 ± 0.013 pH/min in transfected cells (n = 5). This recovery was HCO3−-dependent, as shown by lack of significant pHi recovery in the absence of HCO3− (solution D, Table I) (Fig. 1 B). In HCO3−-free solution, pHi recovery was 0.015 ± 0.003 pH/min in transfected cells (p < 0.001 versusHCO3−-containing solution,n = 5). Nontransfected cells showed little Na+-dependent HCO3− cotransport (Fig. 1 C) with pHi recovery of 0.017 ± 0.002 pH/min (p < 0.001 versus transfected cells,n = 5). NBC activity in transfected cells was also measured in the efflux mode. As shown in Fig. 2, switching the cells from a Na+ and HCO3−-containing medium (solution C, Table I) to a Na+-free solution (solution A, Table I) resulted in rapid cell acidification, 2For the Na+:HCO3− cotransporter to work in the efflux mode, the cells were loaded with a high sodium-containing solution (140 mm) for 30 min as compared with regular solution (Table I, solution A), which has 115 mm sodium. Although the difference between the sodium concentrations in the two solutions is only 25 mm, we observe that NBC can function in the efflux mode only at higher Na+ concentration, indicating that incubation with high Na+ solution increases intracellular Na+ and therefore allows for the Na+:HCO3− cotransporter to function in the efflux mode. with ΔpH of 0.27 pH unit (n = 3). This cell acidification was reversible, with pHi returning to base line upon switching back to the Na+-containing solution (solution A, Table I) (Fig. 2 A), with ΔpH of 0.31 pH unit (n = 3). The pHi recovery back to base line was completely inhibited in the presence of 300 μm DIDS (Fig. 2 A) (n = 3). Neither cell acidification nor pHirecovery were observed in the absence of HCO3− (Fig. 2 B), indicating the dependence of the transporter on Na+ and HCO3−. Taken together with Fig. 1, these studies indicate that the cloned cDNA encodes a Na+:HCO3−cotransporter. The ability of NBC to mediate Li+:HCO3− cotransport was next tested. As shown in Fig. 3 A, exposing the cells to a Li+-containing solution (solution E, Table I) caused significant recovery from intracellular acidosis. Switching from the Li+-containing solution to the Na+-containing solution (solution A, Table I) further increased the rate of pHi recovery (Fig. 3 A). At comparable acidic pHi (nadir pH of 6.282 ± 0.039 and 6.32 ± 0.027 for Li+ and Na+ experiments, respectively,p > 0.05, n = 4) the rate of pHi recovery caused by Na+ was 4-fold higher then Li+ (Fig. 3, A and B) (pHirecovery was 0.185 ± 0.003 pH/min in the presence of Na+ and 0.045 ± 0.003 in the presence of Li+, p < 0.001, n = 4 for each group). The Li+-dependent HCO3− cotransport was completely inhibited in the presence of 300 μm DIDS (Fig. 3 C) and was not detected in nontransfected cells (Fig. 3 D). These results indicate that Li+ can substitute for Na+ on NBC, with Li+ showing lower rates in mediating HCO3−transport. This is in contrast to the proximal tubule luminal NHE, where Li+ has much stronger affinity than Na+(1Mahnensmith R.L. Aronson P.S. Cir. Res. 1985; 56: 773-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). The purpose of the next series of experiments was to examine the interaction of harmaline with NBC. As indicated in Fig. 4, the presence of 0.2 mm harmaline completely blocked the Na+-dependent pHi recovery in HCO3−-containing media (the experiments were performed in the presence of 1 mm amiloride to block Na+/H+ exchange). The inhibition by harmaline was reversible as shown by recovery from cell acidosis upon switching to a harmaline-free solution (Fig. 4). pHi recovery from acidosis was 0.184 ± 0.005 pH/min in the absence of harmaline and 0.007 ± 0.002 in the presence of harmaline (p < 0.001, n = 4 for each group). pHi recovery upon removal of harmaline was 0.178 ± 0.006 pH/min (n= 4). NBC in rabbit kidney cortex is absolutely dependent on HCO3−(24Soleimani M. Aronson P.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and does not demonstrate any affinity for OH− whereas in colon it can also accept OH− (25Rajendran V.M. Oesterlin M. Binder H.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1379-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To examine the interaction of human kidney NBC with OH−, cells were transfected and assayed for pHi recovery from an acid load in the presence of varying pHo and the absence of HCO3−. As shown in Fig. 5 A, in the absence of HCO3− and at pHo 7.4, transfected cells showed little recovery from an acid load, indicating that at normal pH, NBC-1 has very low affinity for OH−(pHi recovery from acidosis was 0.020 ± 0.004 pH/min in the absence of HCO3− (p< 0.001 versusHCO3−-containing solution,n = 5 for each group). Increasing the inward OH− gradient by increasing the external pH to 7.8 caused significant Na+-dependent pHi recovery from an acid load (0.085 ± 0.005, p < 0.001versus pHo 7.4, n = 5) that was abolished in the presence of DIDS (Fig. 5 B). These results are consistent with the operation of NBC on Na+:OH− cotransport mode. These results further indicate that the human kidney NBC predominantly carries HCO3− at physiologic pH (Fig. 5 A versus Fig. 1 A), but can accept OH− under certain conditions. Nontransfected cells demonstrated little pHi recovery at pHo 7.4, but showed moderate DIDS-sensitive pHi recovery from acidosis at pHo 7.8 (Fig. 5, C and D), with the pHi recovery at 0.023 ± 0.003 pH/min (n = 4). To examine the Na+-dependent pHirecovery at pHo 7.8 further, transfected cells were acidified and then switched to a Na+-free solution at pHo7.8. The rate of Na+-independent pHi recovery at pHo 7.8 was 0.027 ± 0.004 (Fig. 5 D). These experiments were performed in Cl−-free solution (Table I); however, the possibility that Na+-independent pHirecovery (Fig. 5 E) is mediated via either Cl−:OH− exchange (or OH−conductance) cannot be excluded, as this process was inhibited by DIDS. When cells were switched to a Na+-containing solution at pHo 7.8 (Fig. 5 E), the rate of pHi recovery increased to 0.11 ± 0.007 pH/min (p < 0.009versus Na+-free pHo 7.8 solution,n = 5 for each group), consistent with Na+:OH− cotransport. Interaction of potassium (K+) with the cloned NBC. A K+-dependent HCO3− cotransport has been described in the kidney (26Leviel F. Borensztein P. Houllier P. Paillard M. Bichara M. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 869-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and squid giant axons (27Hogan E.M. Cohen M.A. Boron W.F. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 106: 821-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The purpose of the next series of experiments was to determine whether K+ can substitute for Na+ on NBC. As shown in Fig. 6, exposing the cells to a Na+-free, K+-containing solution (solution F, Table I) causes minimal recovery from intracellular acidosis, whereas exposing the cells to a Na+-containing solution (solution C, Table I) resulted in rapid recovery from cell acidosis (Fig. 6), indicating that NBC-1 does not function in K+:HCO3− cotransport mode. In HCO3−-containing solution, pHi recovery from acidosis was 0.210 ± 0.006 pH/min in the presence of Na+ and 0.015 ± 0.008 in the presence of K+ (p < 0.001, n = 4 for each group). The results of current experiments indicate that the cloned human kidney Na+:HCO3−cotransporter (NBC-1) accepts Na+ and HCO3− and is inhibited by DIDS (Figs. 1and 2). The results further indicate that Li+ can substitute for Na+ on NBC-1, with Li+ showing decreased capacity to mediate HCO3−-dependent pHirecovery compared with Na+ (Fig. 3). NBC-1 is inhibited by DIDS and harmaline (Fig. 4) and can accept OH− in place of HCO3−, with HCO3− showing much higher affinity than OH− (Fig. 5). NBC does not function in K+:HCO3− cotransport mode (Fig. 6). We recently cloned the human kidney NBC-1 (18Burnham C.E. Amlal H. Wang Z. Shull G.E. Soleimani M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19111-19114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Based on the deduced amino acid sequence, the cDNA encodes a protein with a molecular mass of ∼116 kDa. Northern blot analysis reveals that NBC-1 encodes a 7.6-kilobase mRNA that is highly expressed in kidney and pancreas, with lower levels of expression in the brain (18Burnham C.E. Amlal H. Wang Z. Shull G.E. Soleimani M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19111-19114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). NBC-1 mRNA was not detected in the liver, lung, and heart (18Burnham C.E. Amlal H. Wang Z. Shull G.E. Soleimani M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19111-19114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) despite functional studies indicating the presence of Na+:HCO3− cotransport in these tissues. These results strongly suggest that the Na+:HCO3− cotransport in these latter tissues might be another isoform from this family. The human kidney NBC cDNA is highly homologous with the amphibian kidney NBC and shares striking similarities at both structural and functional levels with that cotransporter (19Romero M.F. Hediger M.A. Boulpaep E.L. Boron W.F. Nature. 1997; 387: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). We have cloned rat NBC-1 and examined its mRNA distribution in different tissues as well as various nephron segments (28Burnham C.E. Flagella M. Wang Z. Amlal H. Shull G.E. Soleimani M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Rat NBC-1 is highly expressed in kidney and brain but shows low levels of expression in stomach and colon (28Burnham C.E. Flagella M. Wang Z. Amlal H. Shull G.E. Soleimani M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Nephron segment distribution studies revealed that NBC-1 is predominantly expressed in proximal tubules (28Burnham C.E. Flagella M. Wang Z. Amlal H. Shull G.E. Soleimani M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The results in Fig. 1 demonstrate that the Na+:HCO3− cotransport does not mediate complete pHi recovery from acidosis to baseline values in the presence of amiloride. Whereas in the absence of amiloride, intracellular pHi returns to base-line values (data not shown), further studies are needed to determine whether NHE activity is indeed essential for complete pHi recovery from acidosis. The results of Fig. 3 demonstrate the interaction of Li+with NBC and indicate that the human kidney NBC can accept Li+ in place of Na+, with Li+:HCO3− cotransport demonstrating lower transport rate than Na+:HCO3− cotransport (Fig. 3). This is very similar to the NBC in basolateral membranes of rabbit kidney proximal tubule (11Soleimani M. Aronson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18302-18308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Soleimani M. Lesoine G.A. Bergman J.A. Aronson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8706-8710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is opposite to the luminal NHE, which has much higher affinity for Li+ than Na+(1Mahnensmith R.L. Aronson P.S. Cir. Res. 1985; 56: 773-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). The human kidney NBC was completely inhibited in the presence of harmaline (Fig. 4) and DIDS (Fig. 1), indicating that it has an inhibitory profile similar to the mammalian NBC in basolateral membranes of rat or rabbit kidney proximal tubule (11Soleimani M. Aronson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18302-18308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Grassl S.M. Holohan P.D. Ross C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2682-2687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Harmaline is known to inhibit the rabbit kidney proximal tubule NBC by binding to the Na+ site (11Soleimani M. Aronson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18302-18308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas DIDS binds to the HCO3− site (5Boron W.F. Boulpaep E.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1983; 81: 53-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 6Preisig P.A. Alpern R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: F751-F756PubMed Google Scholar, 7Boron W.F. Boulpaep E.L. Kidney Int. 1989; 36: 392-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 8Aronson P.S. Soleimani M. Grassl S.M. Semin. Nephrol. 1991; 11: 28-36PubMed Google Scholar). This latter conclusion is based on the fact that DIDS inhibits both Na+-dependent as well as Na+-independent HCO3−transporters. The anion exchanger AE1 (band-3) in red blood cells can mediate the transport of Na+ and HCO3−via ion pair (Na+:CO32−) (31Becker B.F. Duhm J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1978; 282: 149-168Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 32Funder J. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1980; 108: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 33Wieth J.O. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1970; 79: 76-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). According to this mechanism, the positive charge of the Na+ ion is being shielded by a CO32− (31Becker B.F. Duhm J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1978; 282: 149-168Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar), allowing the cotransport to be mediated as an anion via AE1. In support of the ion pair functioning as an anion, we find that cation inhibitors do not inhibit the transport of Na+ via band-3 (31Becker B.F. Duhm J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1978; 282: 149-168Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). NBC was cloned based on homology to anion exchanger isoforms (18Burnham C.E. Amlal H. Wang Z. Shull G.E. Soleimani M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19111-19114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that the Na+:CO32− ion pair may be the actual substrate for transport on this protein. The results of the experiments in Figs. 3 and 4, however, argue against Na+:CO32− ion pair as the substrate. The first argument against ion pair formation concerns the relative affinities of Na+ and Li+. The association constant of Li+ for ion pair formation with CO32− is 4-fold greater than of Na+ (32Funder J. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1980; 108: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), consistent with Li+ having higher affinity than Na+ for transport via red cell band-3 (33Wieth J.O. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1970; 79: 76-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The results of Fig. 3 indicate that the ability of Li+ to mediate HCO3− transport via NBC is significantly lower than Na+. This difference is opposite to that for ion pair formation with CO32−. The other argument against ion pair formation is inhibition of NBC by alkaloid harmaline (Fig. 4). Harmaline is an organic cation known to compete at the Na+site of several Na+-coupled transport systems in kidney proximal tubules such as the Na+/H+ exchanger and the Na+/glucose cotransporter. Although we have not studied the kinetics of NBC inhibition by harmaline, we suggest that based on similarities with the renal basolateral Na+:HCO3− cotransporter in rabbit and rat kidney (11Soleimani M. Aronson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18302-18308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Grassl S.M. Holohan P.D. Ross C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2682-2687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), harmaline inhibits the cloned human NBC by interaction with the Na+ site. These results, in conjunction with the results of Li+ studies, strongly argue that Na+ directly interacts at a distinct site on the NBC rather than via ion pair formation with CO32−. The human kidney NBC accepts OH− in place of HCO3−, with OH−demonstrating much lower Na+-dependent transport rates than HCO3− (Fig. 5). These results are in agreement with functional studies in rabbit colon, indicating lower affinity of NBC for OH− (25Rajendran V.M. Oesterlin M. Binder H.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1379-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The rabbit kidney NBC on the other hand shows absolute dependence on HCO3− and does not demonstrate any affinity for OH− (24Soleimani M. Aronson P.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It is worth mentioning that functional studies in rabbit kidney cortex were performed at physiologic pH (pHo 7.4) (24Soleimani M. Aronson P.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). As such, the affinity of rabbit kidney cotransporter for OH− at external pH values similar to current experiments (i.e. pHo 7.8) remains unknown. Kidney NBC functions in an outwardly directed mode under physiologic conditions (5Boron W.F. Boulpaep E.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1983; 81: 53-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 6Preisig P.A. Alpern R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: F751-F756PubMed Google Scholar, 7Boron W.F. Boulpaep E.L. Kidney Int. 1989; 36: 392-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 8Aronson P.S. Soleimani M. Grassl S.M. Semin. Nephrol. 1991; 11: 28-36PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in trans-vectorial transport of HCO3− from lumen to blood. As such, the physiologic role of the Na+:OH− cotransport mode remains speculative, as carbonic anhydrase activity in the kidney proximal tubule cells couples the CO2 with OH−to generate HCO3−, thereby diminishing the concentration of intracellular OH−. We propose that the physiologic significance of Na+:OH−cotransport mode may be in the colon, where secretion of acid into the lumen via NHE-3 may not lead to the reabsorption of HCO3−, as the luminal [HCO3−] is negligible (34Christopher N.L. Bayles T.M. Gastroenterology. 1971; 60: 845-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), but rather results in generation of intracellular OH−. The Na+:OH− cotransporter will then exit the cell across the basolateral membrane, thereby regulating cell pH. In conclusion, based on functional properties (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6) and nephron segment distribution studies (28Burnham C.E. Flagella M. Wang Z. Amlal H. Shull G.E. Soleimani M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), we propose that NBC-1 is the kidney proximal tubule Na+:HCO3−cotransporter. The technical assistance of Holli Shumaker is greatly appreciated."

When Chinese hamster ovary cells were transfected with a cloned plasmid with an inserted cDNA fragment encoding the entire reading frame, the expressed protein was released into the growth medium as an active form of DNase II. DNase II is an acid hydrolase located subcellularly in lysosomes (1de Duve C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 137: 391-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 2Liao T.-H. Liao W.-C. Chang H.-C.

Anim. (Tokyo). 1995; 44: 169-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), it has not been cited for association with lysosomal storage diseases (6Neufeld E.F. Annu. Rev.

However, recent studies have shown that DNase II may be involved in apoptosis in Chinese hamster ovary cells (8Barry M.A. Eastman A. Arch. Biochem.

Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 483-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar). For the biosynthesis of DNase II, which might help us understand more about apoptosis, information is lacking. However, to investigate the biosynthesis of DNase II, knowledge of its protein and cDNA structures is essential. To date only the overall subunit structure of DNase II, which is a noncovalently linked α·β heterodimer, is understood (12Liao T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10708-10713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and little is known about the gene organization of the two subunits. Herein we report the primary structure determination of DNase II and its cDNA nucleotide sequence. These should provide the molecular and genetic bases for future studies on its involvement in apoptosis and other physiological functions.DISCUSSIONThe open reading frame of the DNase II cDNA (Fig. 9) can be translated into a 364-amino acid polypeptide chain. As illustrated in Fig. 11, a putative transmembrane peptide at the NH2 terminus, two small connecting peptides between α1 and β and between β and α2, and a peptide at the COOH terminus are evidently removed from the nascent chain to form mature DNase II. Thus, all three chains of DNase II are coded by the same cDNA in the sequence α1, β, and α2. Removal of the putative transmembrane peptide is a cotranslational event, but removal of the other three small peptides probably occurs within lysosomes after protein folding.

J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10708-10713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, whether the unprocessed polypeptide is active or not is unknown. Thus, DNase II activity in the growth medium of transfected cells could be caused by one complete chain with no internal cleavages. As to where and when the addition and modification of carbohydrate side chains occur, DNase II probably follows the same dogma of glycosylation as do other lysosomal enzymes (27Kukuruzinska M.A. Bergh M.L.E. Jackson B.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 915-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar).A regulation system for translocation of lysosomal enzymes has been suggested (28Suzuki Y. Jpn. J. Clin. Med. 1995; 53: 2887-2891PubMed Google Scholar), and in the absence of such a system many lysosomal enzymes are secreted excessively into the extracellular compartment. This regulation system normally maintains a constant concentration of endogenous DNase II within lysosomes. However, when expression of DNase II in transfected cells is turned on, apparently any excessive amount of DNase II is secreted into the extracellular compartment, accounting for the activities detected in the growth medium. In lower eukaryotes, such as Tetrahymena, lysosomal enzymes are released into the surrounding medium for nutritional purposes and are not merely a consequence of exocytosis of secondary lysosomes (29Florin-Chritensen M. Florin-Chritensen J. Tiedtke A. Rasmussen L. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 48: 1-4PubMed Google Scholar). Whether the presence of DNase II activity in the growth medium of transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells as shown in Fig. 10 is a response to intoxication or is part of an exocrine function remains to be determined. However, it is possible that because of low transfection efficiency (about 10%) only the transfected cells lysed, and as a result their soluble intercellular contents including DNase II are mixed with the growth medium.The homology search shows that three human cDNA sequences (GenBank accession numbers AA075967, H12842, and AA224257) are highly homologous with the cDNA sequence of porcine spleen DNase II. 2While this manuscript was being reviewed, a paper describing cloning of the cDNA encoding human DNase II appeared (30Yasuda T.

The functions of these cDNA sequence-coding proteins are not known. Perhaps these sequences are parts of the cDNA of human DNase II. Also, the porcine DNase II cDNA sequence is similar to that of a cDNA ofCaenorhabditis elegans (GenBank accession number L11247) encoding a protein of unknown function. DNase II is an acid hydrolase located subcellularly in lysosomes (1de Duve C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 137: 391-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 2Liao T.-H. Liao W.-C. Chang H.-C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1007: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and has been shown to be reversibly associated with the lysosomal membrane (3Chang H.-C. Liao T.-H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 280: 320-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The enzyme hydrolyzes DNA to 3′-phosphoryl oligonucleotides in the absence of metal ions under acidic conditions (4Bernardi G. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 3rd Ed. 4. Academic Press, New York1971: 271-287Google Scholar). Although DNase II activity can be detected in a variety of animal tissues and body fluids (5Koizumi T Exp. Anim. (Tokyo). 1995; 44: 169-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), it has not been cited for association with lysosomal storage diseases (6Neufeld E.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 257-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) or cancer (7Boyer M.J. Tannock I.F. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 60: 269-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, recent studies have shown that DNase II may be involved in apoptosis in Chinese hamster ovary cells (8Barry M.A. Eastman A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 440-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), in lens cell differentiation (9Torriglia A. Chaudun E. Chany-Fournier F. Jeanny J.-C. Courtois Y. Counis M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28579-28585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and in aging of rat brain (10Nakamura Y. Takeda M. Suzuki H. Morita H. Tada K. Hariguchi S. Nishimura T. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1989; 50: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Much of our understanding of the biogenesis of lysosomes comes from biosynthetic studies of lysosomal enzymes in which phosphorylation of mannose residues is responsible for the targeting (11Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 483-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar). For the biosynthesis of DNase II, which might help us understand more about apoptosis, information is lacking. However, to investigate the biosynthesis of DNase II, knowledge of its protein and cDNA structures is essential. To date only the overall subunit structure of DNase II, which is a noncovalently linked α·β heterodimer, is understood (12Liao T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10708-10713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and little is known about the gene organization of the two subunits. Herein we report the primary structure determination of DNase II and its cDNA nucleotide sequence. These should provide the molecular and genetic bases for future studies on its involvement in apoptosis and other physiological functions. DISCUSSIONThe open reading frame of the DNase II cDNA (Fig. 9) can be translated into a 364-amino acid polypeptide chain. As illustrated in Fig. 11, a putative transmembrane peptide at the NH2 terminus, two small connecting peptides between α1 and β and between β and α2, and a peptide at the COOH terminus are evidently removed from the nascent chain to form mature DNase II. Thus, all three chains of DNase II are coded by the same cDNA in the sequence α1, β, and α2. Removal of the putative transmembrane peptide is a cotranslational event, but removal of the other three small peptides probably occurs within lysosomes after protein folding. This type of in vivo proteolytic processing, quite common for lysosomal enzymes, has been described in the maturation of cathepsin D (22Beyer B.M. Dunn B.M. J. Biol.

Partial agonist activity of OHT can be observed in vitro in endometrial carcinoma cells like Ishikawa. Here, we have compared several anti-estrogens (including extensively characterized OHT and pure anti-estrogens such as ICI164,384 and RU58,668, which are devoid of uterotrophic activity) for their capacity to stimulate promoters containing estrogen response elements (EREs) or AP1-binding sites (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response elements, TREs), the two types of DNA motifs known to mediate transcriptional stimulation by estrogen receptors. Assays were performed in Ishikawa cells either by transient transfection or by using cell lines with stably propagated reporter vectors. In transient transfection experiments, none of the anti-estrogens displayed agonist activity on the promoters tested. In contrast, significant transcriptional stimulation was observed with low concentrations of OHT and RU39,411 in Ishikawa cells stably propagating reporter constructs containing a minimal ERE3-TATA promoter. In addition, micromolar concentrations of OHT, but not of RU39,411, stimulated stably propagated AP1-responsive reporter constructs. No transcriptional stimulation of ERE- or TRE-containing promoters was observed with the pure anti-estrogens ICI164,384 and RU58,668. These results indicate that the presence of estrogen response elements in promoters is sufficient to mediate cell-specific agonism of anti-estrogens at the transcriptional level, and that stimulation of AP1 activity may be restricted to a subset of anti-estrogens possessing agonist activity on EREs. In addition, our results suggest that transient transfections do not fully recapitulatein vivo conditions required to observe agonist activity of anti-estrogens.

When bound to DNA the ER stimulates transcription via two transcription activation domains, AF-1 and AF-2 (1Tora L. White J. Brou C. Tasset D. Webster N. Scheer E. Chambon P.

Binding of E2 to the ER is thought to induce a conformational change in the hormone binding domain, stimulating its transactivation properties. Different types of synthetic compounds have been developed that are capable of antagonizing ER action in reproductive tissues and, in particular, of blocking estradiol stimulation of cellular growth in breast and uterine tissues. These anti-estrogens act by competing with E2 for binding to the ER and block ER-mediated activation of transcription when co-administered with hormone (9Katzenellenbogen B.S. Montano M.M. Le Goff P.

However, tamoxifen, one of the most widely used anti-estrogens in breast cancer treatment (10Jordan V.C. Breast Cancer Res.

To better understand the mechanisms of tissue-specific estrogenic activity of anti-estrogens, we compared transcriptional activation of ERE-containing reporter constructs by full or partial anti-estrogens in the estrogen-dependent breast carcinoma cell line MCF7 and in the endometrial carcinoma cell line Ishikawa. We also assessed whether anti-estrogens may regulate transcription of target genes through AP1-binding sites (TPA response elements, TREs) rather than, or as well as, through EREs. Indeed, estrogenic stimulation of promoters containing TRE sites has been documented (19Gaub M.P. Bellard M. Scheuer I. Chambon P. Sassone-Corsi P.

Assays used for investigating the contribution of EREs or TREs in transcriptional stimulation by anti-estrogens with partial agonist activity included, in addition to transient transfection assays in MCF7 or Ishikawa cells, direct hormonal stimulation of reporter vectors stably propagated as episomes in these cell lines. The latter assay was selected because of increasing evidence for mechanistic links between transcriptional stimulation and reorganization of chromatin structure. Comparison of the two types of assays and implications for the mechanism of cell-specific agonism by tamoxifen are discussed. 17β-Estradiol (E2) was purchased from Sigma; RU58,668 (RUf) and RU39,411 (RUp) were generous gifts from Dr. D.

ERE3-tk-CAT was constructed by insertion of three copies of double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the 15-bpXenopus vitellogenin A2 ERE sequence (25Klein-Hitpass L. Ryffel G.U. Heitlinger E. Cato A.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 647-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) flanked byHindIII and XbaI sites between theHindIII and XbaI sites of pBLCAT8+. ERE3-TATA-CAT was constructed in several steps from GRE5-CAT (26Mader S. White J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5603-5607Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). First, theBglII site upstream of the CAT gene in GRE5-CAT was deleted by filling-in with Klenow, creating GRE5-CAT[-BglII]. A fragment containing the ERE3-TATA promoter was then excised from the vector ERE3-pAL10 (27Ponglikitmongkol M. White J.H. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2221-2231Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) by digestion with Asp-718, end-filling with Klenow fragment, and digestion with BamHI; this fragment was inserted into GRE5-CAT[-BglII] which had been digested with SacI, treated with Klenow fragment, and then digested with BamHI to remove the GRE5-TATA promoter. By taking advantage of the unique XhoI and BglII sites upstream and downstream from the three EREs, respectively, these motifs were removed and replaced by multimerized oligonucleotides containing a consensus TPA response element (TRE, Fig. 1 A), creating TRE2-TATA-CAT and TRE6-TATA-CAT. ERE3-TATA-CAT/EBV, TRE2-TATA-CAT/EBV, and TRE6-TATA-CAT/EBV were obtained by removal of XbaI fragments containing the whole minimal promoter-CAT gene transcriptional unit from the parental vectors and insertion into GRE5-CAT/EBV also digested by XbaI (28White J.H. McCuaig K.A. Mader S. Bio/Technology. 1994; 12: 1003-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). MCF7 and Ishikawa cells were grown in α-minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10 and 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), respectively, and switched to phenol red-free (29Berthois Y. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2496-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar) DMEM supplemented with 5% charcoal-treated FBS 72 h before plating for transient transfections. Cells were divided into 10-cm plates (1.5 million cells/plate) and transfected using the calcium-phosphate coprecipitation method (30Banerji J. Rusconi S. Schaffner W. Cell. 1981; 27: 299-308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar) with 15 μg of DNA (1 μg of expression vector where applicable, 2 μg of CAT reporter vector, 2 μg of internal standard vector RSV-LacZ, and Bluescribe M13+ to 15 μg). After 20 h, medium was changed twice to remove precipitate, and hormones were added for a further 24 h (as indicated in figure legends). Cells were harvested by scraping in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline 1×, followed by centrifugation at 2,500 rpm for 10 min. Extracts were prepared by three cycles of freeze-thawing in 0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and standardized for β-galactosidase activity. CAT activity was determined by incubation of protein samples for 1 h with 0.25 μCi of [3H]chloramphenicol and N-butyryl-CoA (0.2 mg/ml), followed by extraction with xylene, and liquid scintillation counting (31Seed B. Sheen J.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). To test for regulation of progesterone receptor expression, cells maintained in phenol red-free medium supplemented with charcoal-treated serum were further incubated for 5 days in the absence or presence of estradiol or of anti-estrogens. Medium was changed every 2nd day, and hormones were added every day. On day 5, cells were plated (1.8 million cells in 10-cm dishes) and transfected in duplicate with 2 μg of GRE5-TATA-CAT plasmid (26Mader S. White J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5603-5607Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), 1 μg of internal control RSV-LacZ, and Bluescribe M13+ as carrier DNA (total 15 μg). Progesterone was added 1 day later, after removal of calcium-phosphate precipitates by two consecutive washes. Cells were harvested 24 h later, and CAT activity was assayed as described above. All CAT assays were reproduced a minimum of three times. COS-1 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS. Cells were plated at a confluency of 1.5 × 106 cells/10-cm plate and transfected with 15 μg of pSG5 or pSG5-HEG0 expression vectors. Cells were harvested 36 h later, and extracts were prepared in gel retardation buffer 4× (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 400 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 2 mm dithiothreitol, supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture) by three cycles of freeze-thawing on ice. For gel retardation assays, extracts were incubated with 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) in gel retardation buffer 1× for 20 min on ice, followed by further incubation in the presence of hormone (10−8mE2 or 10−7m anti-estrogens) and of labeled ERE (20,000 cpm) for 1 h on ice, and then for 30 min at room temperature. Complexes were then resolved by 5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (120 V, 4 °C for 4 h). Ishikawa or MCF7 cells were transfected with 15 μg of ERE3-TATA-CAT/EBV, TRE2-TATA-CAT/EBV, or TRE6-TATA-CAT/EBV (10-cm plates, 1.5 million cells). Forty eight hours after transfection, cells were passaged into 15-cm plates using medium containing 150 μg/ml hygromycin B and maintained in this medium for about 2 weeks until disappearance of all cells in control non-transfected plates (28White J.H. McCuaig K.A. Mader S. Bio/Technology. 1994; 12: 1003-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Surviving cells in each 15-cm plate were then pooled, propagated, and tested for estrogen or TPA induction of CAT activity. Different pools of cells carrying the same reporter plasmid were found to behave similarly. For generation of stable cell lines containing non-episomal TRE-based reporter vectors, Ishikawa cells were cotransfected with 15 μg of TRE6-TATA-CAT vectors and 1.5 μg of neomycin resistance gene expression vector Rc/RSV (Invitrogen). 48 h after transfection, cells were trypsinized and replated into selection medium (α-minimum Eagle's medium containing 5% FBS and 1 mg/ml G418). Two weeks later, individual clones were selected, expanded, and tested for stimulation of CAT activity by incubation with TPA (100 ng/ml) for 24 h. Established cell lines were subsequently maintained in medium containing half the concentration of antibiotic used for selection. For hormonal treatment, cells were preincubated for 72 h in medium without phenol red, supplemented with charcoal-treated serum. Incubation with estrogen or anti-estrogens was then carried out for 24 h except when indicated otherwise. Ishikawa-ERE3/EBV cells maintained in phenol red-free DMEM, 5% charcoal-treated FBS were incubated with E2 (25 nm), OHT (100 nm), or ethanol for 8 h before harvesting and isolation of total RNA by CsCl gradient centrifugation. 3 μg of total RNA were precipitated, resuspended in 6 μl of 1× DNase I digestion buffer (Promega) containing 0.5 units of DNase I, incubated for 15 min at 37 °C and for 10 min at 75 °C, and then transferred on ice. DNase I-treated RNAs (2 μl) were reversed-transcribed using Superscript II RNase H reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 0.5 μm random hexamer in a 20-μl final volume of RT buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol supplemented with 0.5 mmdNTPs) at 37 °C for 1 h, followed by 75 °C for 10 min. Aliquots of resulting cDNAs (2 μl) were amplified by PCR usingTaq DNA polymerase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a 50-μl final volume of 1× Taq buffer supplemented with 0.2 mm dNTPs and 0.5 μm forward and reverse CAT or β-actin primers as follows: CAT forward, 5′-CCGCCTGATGAATGCTCATCCG-3′, and CAT reverse, 5′-GCATTCTGCCGACATGGAAGCC-3′; β-actin forward, 5′-GCTGTGCTATCCCTGTACGC-3′, and β-actin reverse, 5′-GCCATGGTGATGACCGGC-3′. 24 cycles of PCR (95 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 25 s) were performed for amplification of β-actin cDNAs and 28 cycles were performed (95 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 30 s) for amplification of CAT sequences, followed by a final elongation step (72 °C for 10 min). The amplified products were then resolved on a 1.5% agarose gel. Partial anti-estrogens such as hydroxytamoxifen are thought to induce a specific conformation of the estrogen receptor, which differs from both those of unliganded and estrogen-liganded ER. As a result, interaction between ER and estrogen or OHT differentially affects electrophoretic mobilities of ER·ERE complexes in gel shift assays. Full anti-estrogens like ICI164,384 induce yet another conformation, resulting in a migration that is closer to that of unliganded ER (32Metzger D. Berry M. Ali S. Chambon P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 579-591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We used a gel shift assay to examine ER conformational changes induced by two other anti-estrogens, RU39,411 (RUp) and RU58,668 (RUf), which are both 11-β derivatives of estradiol and were previously reported to behave as partial and full anti-estrogens, respectively (18Van de Velde P. Nique F. Bouchoux F. Brémaud J. Hameau M.-C. Lucas D. Moratille C. Viet S. Philibert D. Teutsch G. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 48: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 33Jin L. Borras M. Lacroix M. Legros N. Leclercq G. Steroids. 1995; 60: 512-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Extracts from COS-1 cells transiently transfected with an expression vector for wild-type estrogen receptor (pSG5-HEG0) were incubated with estrogen, anti-estrogens, or vehicle together with a labeled consensus estrogen response element. ER-containing complexes were then separated from free probe by 5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A specific complex could be detected in the absence of ligand (Fig. 2, 2nd lane). Indeed, this complex was absent when using extracts from cells transfected with the parental expression vector pSG5 (Fig. 2, 1st lane) or when HEG0-containing extracts were incubated with a glucocorticoid-response element instead of an ERE (data not shown). Estrogen treatment of the cellular extracts increased the electrophoretic mobility of the ER·ERE complex (Fig. 2, E2, arrow 3). OHT treatment, on the other hand, resulted in a slower migrating complex (Fig. 2,OHT, arrow 1), and RUp treatment generated a complex migrating at a position similar to that of OHT (Fig. 2, RUp, arrow 1). Complexes between ER and the anti-estrogen RUf migrated at a position intermediary between those of ER·E2 and ER·OHT (Fig. 2, RUf, arrow 2), and indistinguishable from that of the ER·ICI164,384 complexes (Fig. 2, ICI, arrow 2). Similar results were obtained using the ER mutant HE0, except that complexes were only observed in the presence of estrogen or of the various anti-estrogens and not in the absence of ligand (data not shown), consistent with the destabilizing effect of the G400V mutation on unbound ER (34Tora L. Mullick A. Metzger D. Ponglikitmongkol M. Park I. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1981-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 35Aumais J.P. Lee H.S. Lin R. White J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12229-12235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the electrophoretic mobilities of ER liganded with RUp or RUf are consistent with their identification as partial and full anti-estrogens, respectively. Hydroxytamoxifen was previously reported to induce expression of the estrogen target gene human progesterone receptor in Ishikawa cells (15Jamil A. Croxtall J.D. White J.O. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 6: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 16Schwartz L.B. Krey L. Demopoulos R. Goldstein S.R. Nachtigall L.E. Mittal K. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1997; 176: 129-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We decided to investigate whether RUp, which similarly affects ER migration in gel shift assays, can also induce expression of PR in Ishikawa and MCF7 cells. Cells were pretreated with estrogen or anti-estrogens prior to transient transfection with GRE5-TATA-CAT/EBV (Fig. 1), followed by addition of progesterone for 24 h (see “Experimental Procedures”). No stimulation of CAT activity by progesterone could be observed in extracts of cells in the absence of treatment with estrogen or anti-estrogens (Fig. 3 A, lane 2). In cells treated with estrogen or with the ER agonist moxestrol, the 11β-methoxy derivative of ethynyl estradiol (36Salmon J. Coussediere D. Cousty C. Raynaud J.P. J. Steroid Biochem. 1983; 18: 565-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 37Raynaud J.P. Martin P.M. Bouton M.M. Ojasoo T. Cancer Res. 1978; 38: 3044-3050PubMed Google Scholar), CAT activity was induced over 20-fold in the presence of progesterone (Fig. 3 A, lanes 4 and 12). In cells pretreated with OHT, progesterone-induced CAT expression levels were 12% of those obtained with estrogen pretreatment (Fig. 3 A, lane 6). The anti-estrogen RUp induced PR expression to comparable levels (Fig. 3 A, lane 10), whereas no stimulation could be detected following incubation with RUf (Fig. 3 A, lane 8). Contrary to what was observed with Ishikawa cells, none of the anti-estrogens assayed detectably stimulated PR transcriptional activity in MCF7 cells using this assay (Fig. 3 B, compare lanes 5–10 tolanes 1 and 2). These observations confirm that partial agonist activity of anti-estrogens on expression levels of endogenous estrogen target genes can be observed in Ishikawa cells (15Jamil A. Croxtall J.D. White J.O. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 6: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar,16Schwartz L.B. Krey L. Demopoulos R. Goldstein S.R. Nachtigall L.E. Mittal K. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1997; 176: 129-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In order to analyze the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation by anti-estrogens with partial agonist activity in Ishikawa cells, we examined whether synthetic estrogen-responsive promoters can be stimulated by these anti-estrogens in transient transfection assays (Fig. 4). Three estrogen-sensitive reporter recombinants, ERE3-TATA-CAT/EBV, ERE3-tk-CAT, or Vit-tk-CAT (Fig. 1), were transiently transfected into Ishikawa cells in the absence of cotransfected estrogen receptor expression vector (Fig. 4 A). Anti-estrogens did not detectably stimulate CAT expression from ERE3-TATA-CAT/EBV (Fig. 4 A, lanes 3–6), ERE3-tk-CAT (Fig. 4 A, lanes 10–13), or Vit-tk-CAT (Fig. 4 A, lanes 17–20) under conditions where estradiol stimulated these reporter constructs 35-, 10-, and 25-fold, respectively (Fig. 4 A, lanes 2, 9, and 16). Similar results were obtained when CAT assays were repeated with 10 times more extract than in Fig. 4 A to confirm that none of the anti-estrogens tested stimulated CAT activity higher than vehicle (data not shown). Cotransfection of an expression vector for wild-type ER (pSG5-HEG0) along with ERE3-TATA-CAT/EBV, ERE3-tk-CAT, or Vit-tk-CAT resulted in increased background levels in the absence of hormonal treatment (Fig. 4 B, lanes 1, 8, and 15). Treatment with anti-estrogens did not increase CAT expression levels compared with vehicle alone (Fig. 4 B, lanes 3–6, 10–13, and17-20), although CAT levels in the presence of OHT or RUp were slightly higher than with other anti-estrogens. Background CAT expression in the absence of hormonal treatment could result from binding of residual estrogens in media, which would be competed out by incubation with anti-estrogens. Alternatively, unliganded ER may be a weak transcriptional activator under the conditions of this assay. Results similar to those observed in Ishikawa cells were obtained by transient transfection of MCF7 cells (data not shown). In both cell lines, the concentrations of anti-estrogens used (100 nm) were sufficient to totally repress stimulation by 1 nmestrogen, demonstrating that estrogen receptors are fully saturated by these anti-estrogens under the conditions used to assay for agonist activity (data not shown). In conclusion, agonist activity of anti-estrogens could not be detected in transient transfection assays of ERE-containing reporter vectors either in Ishikawa or in MCF7 cells. The failure to detect significant transcriptional activation by OHT or other anti-estrogens in transient transfections raised the possibility that in vivo conditions required for agonist activity of OHT are not fully reconstituted in this assay. Therefore, we established Ishikawa and MCF7 cell lines stably propagating the ERE3-TATA-CAT/EBV episomal plasmids, selecting pools of transfected cells by addition of hygromycin B in cell culture medium (see “Experimental Procedures”; note that for brevity cell lines stably propagating ERE3-TATA-CAT/EBV episomal plasmids will be indicated by the suffix -ERE3/EBV). Stimulation with estrogen (25 nm, 24 h) of Ishikawa-ERE3/EBV cells led to a marked stimulation of CAT expression levels (∼17-fold, Fig. 5 A, lane 2). No stimulation was observed with the pure anti-estrogens RUf or ICI (100 nm, Fig. 5 A, lanes 5 and6). In contrast, OHT and RUp stimulated CAT activity to ∼22 and 30% of the levels obtained with estrogen, respectively (Fig. 5 A, lane 3 and 4). These results were obtained with different pools of Ishikawa-ERE3/EBV cells generated by two independent rounds of selection. On the other hand, neither the partial anti-estrogens OHT and RUp nor the full anti-estrogens ICI or RUf stimulated CAT expression more than background in MCF7-ERE3/EBV cells; note, however, that the fold stimulation by estrogen was lower in stably transfected MCF7 cells than in Ishikawa-derived cell lines (Fig. 5 B, lanes 1–7). Agonist activity of OHT was dose-dependent, and stimulation of CAT activity could be detected with concentrations as low as 1 nm, whereas ICI or RUf did not induce levels of CAT activity above basal levels at any of the concentrations tested (Fig. 5 C). Note that none of the anti-estrogens were capable of inducing CAT expression in a cell line derived from Ishikawa cells by stable transfection of an episomal vector containing five glucocorticoid response elements (GRE5) instead of three EREs (GRE5-TATA-CAT/EBV, Ref. 28White J"

Electron microscopic observation revealed that these provacuoles were surrounded by a single membrane. We detected inner (cytoplasmic) membrane proteins in the provacuolar membrane but not outer membrane proteins. Biochemical analyses revealed that the provacuoles consist of everted cytoplasmic membranes. We applied the patch clamp method to the giant provacuoles. We have succeeded in measuring current that represents inward movement of H+because of respiration and to ATP hydrolysis by the FoF1-ATPase. Such current was inhibited by inhibitors of the respiratory chain or FoF1-ATPase.

Such current was inhibited by inhibitors of the respiratory chain or FoF1-ATPase. This method is applicable for analyses of ion channels, ion pumps, or ion transporters in E. coli or other microorganisms. The patch clamp technique is an excellent method to measure ion movement across cell membranes as current (1Hamil O.P. Mary A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15149) Google Scholar). An extremely small glass pipette (about 1 μm in diameter) is attached to the membranes, and activity of ion translocating proteins (ion channels, ion pumps, or ion transporters) is directly measured. So far, however, this important method has been mainly utilized for studies on animal or plant cells but scarcely for bacterial cells (2Sukharev S.I. Blount P. Martinac B. Kung C. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 633-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Bacterial cells are usually too small to be measured by this method. Escherichia coli, a Gram-negative bacterium, is the best characterized organism from both biochemical and genetical points of view. Ion pumps and ion transporters in E. coli are biochemically well characterized. Many mutant E. coli cells are available. Thus, genetical manipulations are very easy with this microorganism. Therefore, development of a patch clamp method applicable to E. coli membranes must be extremely valuable. Cells of E. coli are surrounded by an outer membrane and an inner membrane (cytoplasmic membrane) separated by a peptidoglycan layer and a periplasmic space. All of the major ion pumps and ion transporters such as the respiratory chain, FoF1-ATPase, various ion transporters, and ion-coupled solute transporters are located in the cytoplasmic membrane. To measure ion translocation via such ion pumps or transporters of the cytoplasmic membrane, we have to overcome the following three hurdles: 1) we have to prepare giant vesicles, the diameter of which must be at least 10 μm (this is important to get high success rate and accuracy of measurement), 2) the pipette must be directly accessible to the cytoplasmic membrane, and 3) the substrates or effectors of the ion pumps or transporters must be easily accessible to the active site of the proteins and easily removable from the system. It would be essential to prepare giant protoplasts to overcome the first two hurdles. Many attempts have been made by many research groups to prepare giant bacterial cells or giant protoplasts. So far, however, no giant protoplasts surrounded by cytoplasmic membranes and suitable for patch clamp analysis have been prepared. Giant cells that were large enough for the patch clamp analysis have been prepared from cephalexin-induced filaments (3Ruthe H.-J. Adler J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 819: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) or from an osmotic-sensitive mutant (4Buechner M. Delcour A.H. Martinac B. Adler J. Kung C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1024: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, such cells were not protoplasts surrounded only by the cytoplasmic membrane. Attempts have been made to prepare giant protoplasts from such giant cells (or spheroplasts) by osmotic shock or by treating them with lysozyme (5Cui C. Smith D.O. Adler J. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 144: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 6Kubalski A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1238: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). It is not clear whether the respiratory chain components and FoF1-ATPase (H+-translocating ATPase) are present in the membrane of such preparations, and therefore origin of the membrane is not clear. On the other hand, large protoplasts have been prepared from a penicillin-resistant mutant (7Eda T. Kanda Y. Kimura S. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 127: 1564-1567Crossref Google Scholar, 8Onoda T. Oshima A. Nakano S. Matsuno A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1987; 133: 527-534PubMed Google Scholar). Those protoplasts were still too small to apply for the patch clamp method. Thus, these preparations were not suitable for the measurement of ion translocation via proteins of the cytoplasmic membrane by the patch clamp method. Recently we have succeeded in developing a unique method, named the spheroplast incubation method, for the preparation of extremely large giant protoplasts (10–30 μm in diameter). This method was derived from an early observation by Kusaka (9Kusaka I. J. Bacteriol. 1967; 96: 884-888Crossref Google Scholar) that large protoplasts are formed after prolonged incubation of spheroplasts formed by treating cells ofBacillus megaterium with lysozyme in the presence of both penicillin G, an inhibitor of peptidoglycan synthesis, and an osmo-protectant. We have applied this method to many Gram-negative and -positive bacteria and succeeded in the formation of giant protoplasts from these types of cells. It is very difficult to overcome the third hurdle. The principal ion pumps in E. coli cells are the respiratory chain and the FoF1-ATPase. Ion movement through these ion pumps can be measured only with the whole cell recording mode of the patch clamp method because of their lower efficiency of ion transport compared with ion channels. Moreover, for the whole cell recording mode, it is not easy to perfuse a buffer inside a cell through a microelectrode pipette (10Matsuda H. Noma A. J. Physiol. 1984; 357: 553-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). A substrate of the respiratory chain, NADH, and a substrate of the FoF1-ATPase, ATP, are accessible only from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Thus, giant protoplasts with a right-side-out orientation are not suitable for measurement of H+ translocation because of the respiratory chain or the FoF1-ATPase. If we can prepare everted giant membrane vesicles, this hurdle will be overcome. Although several methods for the preparation of everted membrane vesicles from E. coli cells are available, the size of the vesicles is much smaller than the original cells (11Rosen B.P. Tsuchiya T. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 56: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 12Yamada H. Tokuda H. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1723-1728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Formation of vacuole-like structures in E. coli cells has been reported from two groups. Lederberg and Clair reported that vacuole-like structures appeared in cells after incubation in the presence of penicillin G, which resulted in cell lysis (13Lederberg J. Clair J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1957; 75: 143-160Crossref Google Scholar). Buechneret al. observed vacuole-like structures in osmotic-sensitive mutant cells by ultra thin section electron microscopy (4Buechner M. Delcour A.H. Martinac B. Adler J. Kung C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1024: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). No ribosomes were observed in the vacuole-like structures. Both types of vacuole-like structures were about 3 μm. Unfortunately, further analysis of these vacuole-like structures has not been done. During the course of our studies on the giant protoplasts, we found that extremely large vacuole-type structures (10–20 μm in diameter) were formed in the giant protoplasts. Here we report the preparation of the giant protoplasts and the giant vacuole-like structures (provacuoles) from E. coli cells. We investigated the properties of the giant provacuoles and measured H+ translocation via the respiratory chain (or by the FoF1-ATPase) using the patch clamp method by applying the whole cell recording mode. These methods could be applied for the direct measurement of ion translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane of E. coli and other bacteria.

The cells were harvested in the late exponential phase of growth and suspended in the same volume of SP buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 400 mm sucrose). Lysozyme (200 μg/ml) was added to the cell suspension, and the suspension was shaken at 30 °C for 10 min at 45 rpm. After this treatment, the cells were harvested and resuspended in the same volume of the GP medium consisting of 2.75% trypticase soy broth (without dextrose) (BBL Co.), 10 mm MgSO4, and 200 mm sucrose. A1400 volume of this suspension was diluted into the GP medium containing 0.7 units/ml of DNase I (TaKaRa Co.) and 800 μg/ml of penicillin G (potassium salt) (Banyu Pharmaceutical Co.) and shaken at 30 °C for 24 h at 30 rpm. Cells of strain K002 or K003 were made gigantic in this medium. However, for the preparation of the giant protoplasts from strain C600, the modified GP medium (50 mmKCl was added, and the sucrose concentration was 300 mm) was used. The C600 cells were shaken for 12 h (instead of 24 h) in the medium. Plasmids pMAL-pCm and pMAL-cCm were constructed by inserting the BsaAI fragment, which carried the chloramphenicol resistance gene into the uniqueScaI site of pMAL-p2 and pMAL-c2 (New England Biolabs. Co.), respectively. pMAL-c2 is identical to pMAL-p2 (possessingmalE-lacZα fused gene) except for deletion of the region for MalE (the structural gene for the maltose binding protein (MBP)) signal peptide. A plasmid pGFP (CLONTECH Co.) was doubly digested withEcoRI and HindIII, and the resulting fragment containing the gene for green fluorescence protein (GFP) was blunted and ligated to the XmnI site of the pMAL-pCm or the pMAL-cCm. The plasmids constructed were designated as pMAL-pCm-GFP and pMAL-cCm-GFP. Expression of malE gene carried on the plasmids is under the control of tac promoter, so that the protein was induced with IPTG. Giant protoplasts (induced with IPTG when necessary) were harvested by centrifugation at 1,600 × g. The pellet was suspended with Burst buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm sucrose, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 17.5 units/ml of DNase I. The suspension was shaken at 30 °C for 20–30 min (45 rpm). After centrifugation at 1,600 × g, the pellet was resuspended in a small volume of Burst buffer containing 20% Percoll (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The suspension was placed in a centrifuge tube onto which an equal volume of Burst buffer was overlaid. Percoll density gradient centrifugation was carried out at 400 × g for 30 min. Provacuoles were found in the interfacial layer. The giant provacuoles were washed twice with the Burst buffer and used for further analyses. Membranes of the provacuoles and intraprovacuolar materials were separated as follows. The giant provacuoles were frozen rapidly in liquid N2 and thawed on ice. The provacuoles were completely disrupted by this procedure. After ultracentrifugation at 130,000 × gfor 1 h, the pellet (membrane fraction) and the supernatant (intraprovacuolar materials) were recovered. The membrane fraction was washed with Burst buffer and resuspended in the same buffer. All centrifugations were carried out at 4 °C. The fractions (membranes and intravacuolar materials) were used for detection of MBP. For DAPI staining, the giant protoplasts were prepared from cells of E. coli K002. DAPI (final concentration, 1 μM) was added to the suspension of giant protoplasts and incubated at 30 °C for 2–3 h. When necessary, the giant provacuoles were isolated from the protoplasts. Fluorescent micrographs of the protoplasts and the provacuoles were taken with excitation at 350 nm and emission at 430–450 nm. For detection of GFP, the giant protoplasts were prepared from cells of E. coliC600/pMAL-pCm-GFP or C600/pMAL cCm-GFP. IPTG was added to the medium at 0.1 mm and incubated for 2–3 h. The fluorescent micrographs were taken by confocal laser scanning microscopy (TCS4D, Leica Co.) with excitation at 488 nm and emission at 530 nm. Electron micrographs were taken as described previously (15Tsuruoka T. Ito M. Tomioka S. Hirata A. Matsuhashi M. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 5229-5235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Intact cells of E. coli K002 were harvested and suspended in a buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm PMSF. The cells were disrupted by sonication. After removal of unbroken cells by low speed centrifugation, the supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Membrane fractions were recovered in the pellet. The membrane fraction was washed with a buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 2 mm EDTA. Membrane fraction from the giant protoplasts was prepared as follows. The giant protoplasts were collected by centrifugation and suspended in a buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm PMSF, and 280 units/ml of DNase I. The giant protoplasts were completely disrupted by sonication. Unbroken protoplasts were removed by low speed centrifugation. The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellet was washed as described above. The membrane fractions were resuspended in a buffer consisting of 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 0.25% Sarcosyl and incubated at 20 °C for 20 min. Outer membrane proteins were not solubilized and could be obtained as pellets after centrifugation. The pellets were washed with a buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 5 mmMgCl2 and resuspended in the same buffer. The giant protoplasts were washed twice with a stabilizing buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 300 mm sucrose, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mmPMSF, and 17.5 units/ml DNase I and resuspended in the same buffer. Giant provacuoles, the provacuolar membranes, and intraprovacuolar materials were prepared as described above. One-fourth volume of 50% tetrachloroacetic acid was added to the samples and mixed vigorously. After centrifugation at 8,500 × g, the pellets were washed first with acetone and thereafter with diethylether and suspended in a certain volume of the Burst buffer. These fractions were separated electrophoretically in a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. Anti-MBP antiserum and purified MBP were purchased from NEB Co. For detection of the antigen-antibody complex, the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used. For detection of SecY, proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Anti-SecY antiserum and the ECL system were used to detect the SecY. Anti-SecY antiserum and purified SecY protein were generous gifts from Dr. H. Tokuda (University of Tokyo). For detection of cytochrome bo, bd, and F1-ATPase, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Anti-bd antiserum was a generous gift from Dr. H. Matsuzawa (University of Tokyo). Anti-F1-ATPase antiserum was a generous gift from Dr. M. Futai (Institute of Scientific Industrial Research, Osaka University). Measurement of H+ pumping activity was carried out by the quinacrine fluorescence quenching method (16Kuroda T. Shimamoto T. Inaba K. Tsuda M. Tsuchiya T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 1030-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Provacuoles (20 μg of protein) were added to 2 ml of the assay buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 20 mm KCl, and 30 mm sucrose) containing 1 μM quinacrine hydrochloride. After preincubation for 5 min at 25 °C, NADH or ATP was added. After fluorescence quenching had occurred, KCN or DCCD was added as an inhibitor of the respiratory chain or FoF1-ATPase. Giant protoplasts were harvested by centrifugation at 740 × g and gently suspended in a small volume of the same medium as that used for cell growth. The giant protoplasts were put on a glass chamber and washed with GPW buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mmMgCl2, and 200 mm sucrose). The GPW buffer was replaced with the Burst buffer containing 210 units/ml of DNase I. After a few minutes, the giant provacuoles were washed again with Burst buffer. The chamber was filled carefully with Burst buffer. The patch pipettes (Drummond Scientific Co.) were pulled to a diameter with a resistance of 12.5–25 MΩ (when measured in Burst buffer) using a puller machine (model PC 10, Narishige) and then heat-polished (model MF-90, Narishige). The electrode was gently touched to a giant provacuole with a mild suction (about 200 mmH2O), producing an instantaneous seal of about 10 GΩ. Thereafter the suction was stopped. A tiny hole was made in the membrane of the giant vacuole with a ZAP pulse (duration time 3 ms, rising period 10 μs, amplitude 0.8 V). After that, the resistance was 0.5–1 GΩ. All substrates in the assay buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mmMgCl2, 20 mm KCl, and 30 mmsucrose) were added through tandem six-way bulbs (GL Sciences Inc.). The Patch amplifier used was CEZ-2400 (NIHON KOHDEN). A positive current represents positive charges moving from exterior to interior of the provacuole. All recordings were made using the standard patch clamp technique at 23 °C (1Hamil O.P. Mary A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15149) Google Scholar). An electron micrograph of a giant protoplast and a vacuole-like structure formed in the protoplast are shown in Fig. 1 A. The diameter of the giant protoplast in the figure is about 13 μm and that of the vacuole-like structure is about 10 μm. The original E. coli cell (1 × 2 μm) is shown in Fig. 1 B. The membranes of the giant protoplast (indicated by an arrowhead) and that of the giant vacuole-like structure (indicated by an arrow) are shown in Fig. 1 C. Compared with membranes of the original cell shown in Fig. 1 D, which consist of two membrane structures (two arrows indicating outer membrane and inner membrane, respectively), both of the membranes of the giant protoplast and the giant vacuole-like structure consist of single membrane (Fig. 1 C). We took many electron micrographs of the giant protoplasts and the giant vacuole-like structures and obtained the same results. Thus, we conclude that both the giant protoplasts and the giant vacuole-like structures are surrounded by single membrane. It should be noted that most giant protoplasts contained several vacuole-like structures in one protoplast, as will be shown below. No ribosome-like structures are present inside the giant vacuole-like structures (Fig. 1, A and C). We stained the giant protoplasts and the giant vacuole-like structures with DAPI, which stacks between DNA double strands, and investigated whether DNA exists in the vacuole-like structures (Fig. 2). Our results clearly indicate that there is no detectable DNA in the vacuole-like structures (Fig. 2 C). However, DNA is present in the cytoplasm of the giant cells (Fig. 2 C). Because the vacuole-like structures do not contain ribosomes, DNA, and any other electron-dense materials, we henceforth refer to the vacuole-like structures as “provacuoles.”Figure 2DIC images and fluorescence micrographs of giant protoplasts and giant provacuoles.

D, fluorescence image of the giant provacuoles shown in B stained with DAPI. DAPI (final concentration, 1 μM) was added to suspension of giant protoplasts or provacuoles and incubated at 30 °C for 2–3 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Microscopic observations revealed that the giant protoplasts are not very stable. Larger giant protoplasts were more unstable compared with smaller ones. We sometimes observed that larger giant protoplasts lysed during the microscopic observations, and provacuoles were released to the medium. Unlike the instability observed for the giant protoplasts, the provacuoles were stable. Thus, it seemed possible that the provacuoles could be isolated. The giant protoplasts were lysed by osmotic shock (lowering the osmolarity). The provacuoles were then separated by Percoll density gradient centrifugation. A differential interference contrast (DIC) micrograph of the isolated giant provacuoles is shown in Fig. 2 B. Size of the giant provacuoles ranged from 2 to 15 μm. The provacuoles could not be stained with DAPI (Fig. 2 D), indicating that DNA was not present in the provacuoles. In any case, we succeeded in isolating the provacuoles. We analyzed membrane proteins of the provacuoles to determine whether the provacuole membrane is derived from the cytoplasmic membrane, the outer membrane, or both. As shown in Fig. 3, although major outer membrane proteins OmpC/F and OmpA were detected in the Sarcosyl-insoluble fraction of whole membranes of intact cells (Fig. 3, lane 3), they were not detected in the Sarcosyl-insoluble fraction of the whole provacuolar membranes (Fig. 3, lane 6). Almost all of the membrane proteins of the provacuoles were solubilized by Sarcosyl. Absolutely no protein band was detected in the Sarcosyl-insoluble fraction from the isolated provacuoles (data not shown). It has been reported that most cytoplasmic membrane proteins, but not outer membrane proteins, were solubilized by Sarcosyl (17Filip C. Fletcher G. Wulff J.L. Earhart C.F. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 115: 717-722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we believe that the membrane of the provacuoles was from cytoplasmic membrane. Some difference in the membrane protein patterns was observed between the cytoplasmic membrane of intact cells, giant protoplasts, and provacuoles. This suggests that membrane of the vacuoles is very similar but not completely identical with the cytoplasmic membrane. We tested whether some of the major membrane transport systems, such as the Sec protein secretion machinery, the respiratory chain, and the FoF1-ATPase, exist in the membranes of the provacuoles by immunoblot analysis (Western blotting). SecY is a major component of the Sec complex (18Brundage E. Hendrick J.P. Schiebel E. Driessen A.J.M. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 62: 649-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 19Akimaru J. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Mizushima S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6546-6549Crossref Scopus (171) Google Scholar). We detected two protein bands that reacted with anti-SecY antibody in both the protoplasts and the provacuolar membranes (Fig. 4 A, lanes 1 and2). The band corresponding to the SecY in the protoplasts was very faint, suggesting that the relative amount of the SecY in the protoplasts is small compared with total proteins in the protoplasts. On the other hand, the SecY was clearly detected in the provacuolar membranes, suggesting that the relative amount of SecY compared with other membrane proteins in the provacuolar membranes is enough. The band with lower molecular weight shown in the figure (Fig. 4 A, lanes 1 and 2) is a nonspecific one. The α and β subunits of the FoF1-ATPase complex, the major subunits of the complex, were present in the provacuolar membranes prepared fromE. coli strain K002, a wild type cell with respect to the FoF1-ATPase (Fig. 4 B, lane 1). On the other hand, only faint bands corresponding to the α and β subunits were detected with the provacuolar membranes from strain K003, an FoF1-ATPase negative mutant (Fig. 4 B, lane 2). We detected both subunit 1 of the cytochrome bd complex (Fig. 4 C) and subunit 1 of the cytochrome bo complex (Fig. 4 D) from the terminal oxidase of the respiratory chain in the provacuolar membranes. The amount of the bd and the bo in E. coli cells is greatly affected by the growth phases (20Minagawa J. Nakamura H. Yamato I. Mogi T. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11198-11203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The bo complex is prominent at the early exponential phase of growth. The bd complex is prominent at late exponential phase. Under the growth conditions in our experiments, the bd was the major terminal oxidase. The amount of bd in the provacuolar membranes was roughly 10 times larger than that of bo in K002. We also checked the amount of bd and bo in the provacuolar membranes from K003, a FoF1-ATPase negative mutant. Again, bd was present in the provacuolar membranes in larger amounts than bo. However, the amount of bo was larger than that in the provacuolar membranes of K002 (Fig. 4 D). Thus, all of the major transporters in the cytoplasmic membranes tested were present in the provacuolar membranes. Therefore, we conclude that the provacuolar membranes are very similar to the cytoplasmic membranes of intact cells. We tested the activity and direction of protein transport via the Sec system in the provacuolar membranes. MBP is a component of the maltose transport system and is located in the periplasmic space of intact E. coli cells. This protein is synthesized by ribosomes in the cytoplasm and excreted to the periplasm through the Sec secretion machinery. A signal peptide at the NH2 terminus of MBP is necessary for the secretion to occur. We constructed a plasmid encoding a fusion protein between MBP and GFP. The GFP portion was attached to the COOH terminus of the MBP. Thus, location of the fused MBP in the cells could easily be detected because of the green fluorescence emitted by GFP. We constructed two types of plasmids that should produce two types of fusion proteins, one possessing no signal peptide (pMAL-cCm-GFP) and the other possessing the signal peptide(pMAL-pCm-GFP). The fusion protein with no signal peptide was detected in the cytoplasm of the giant protoplasts (Fig. 5,A and C). MBP could not be excreted from the cytoplasm without the signal. When the signal peptide is present, the fused MBP was detected mainly inside the provacuoles of the giant protoplasts (Fig. 5, B andD). Faint fluorescent signals were detected in the cytoplasm. This means that the Sec system is functional in the membranes of the provacuoles and that the direction of the secretion (protein transport) is from cytoplasm to the interior of the provacuoles. This indicates that the provacuolar membranes have an everted orientation compared with the cytoplasmic membranes. We then tested whether the MBP in the provacuoles is in the mature (processed) form or immature (unprocessed) form by immunoblot analysis. We used a plasmid pMAL-pCm encoding a fusion protein MBP-LacZα (α fragment of β-galactosidase). Expression of the fusion protein from the plasmid gene is under tac promoter. No protein of the giant protoplasts from uninduced cells reacted with antibody against the MBP (Fig. 6, lane 1). Contrary to what was expected, we detected four protein bands that reacted with the antibody in the giant protoplasts prepared from cells induced with IPTG (a gratuitous inducer of the tac promoter) (Fig. 6, lane 2). Among the four, the first two protein bands (top of the gel) corresponded to proteins that reacted with antiserum against LacZα (data not shown). The fourth protein band (the lowest molecular weight) corresponded to the mature MBP (Fig. 6,lane 8). Two dense protein bands (the second and the fourth) were observed in culture medium of the giant protoplasts (Fig. 6, lane 3). Thus, we believe that the first and second bands (in lane 2) correspond to premature and mature MBP-LacZα, respectively. On the other hand, we believe the third and the fourth bands (in lane 2) correspond to premature and mature MBP, respectively, both of which were derived from the fusion protein. Mature MBP-LacZα and mature MBP are present in the culture medium. Mature MBP is present in the provacuoles. The absence of mature MBP-LacZα in the provacuoles suggests that the LacZα portion of the fusion protein was cleaved by some unidentified protease. In any case, it is clear that protein-processing secretion machinery is present in the provacuolar membranes. We confirmed that the provacuoles are everted (orientation is inside-out compared with the cytoplasmic membranes) by measuring direction of H+ transport bec"
https://openalex.org/W2072887324,"The x-ray crystal structure of the N-lobe of human serum transferrin has shown that there is a hydrogen bond network, the so-called “second shell,” around the transferrin iron binding site. Tyrosine at position 85 and glutamic acid at position 83 are two nonliganding residues in this network in the human serum transferrin N-lobe (hTF/2N). Mutation of each of these two amino acids has a profound effect on the metal binding properties of hTF/2N. When Tyr-85 is mutated to phenylalanine, iron release from the resulting mutant Y85F is much more facile than from the parent protein. Elimination of the hydrogen bond between Tyr-85 and Lys-296 appears to interfere with the “di-lysine (Lys-206–Lys-296) trigger,” which affects the iron binding stability of the protein. Surprisingly, mutation of Glu-83 to alanine leads to the absence of one of the normal iron binding ligands; introduction of a monovalent anion is able to restore the normal first coordination sphere. The missing ligand appears to be His-249, as revealed by comparison of the metal binding behaviors of mutants H249Q and E83A and structural analysis. Glu-83 has a strong H bond linkage with His-249 in apo-hTF/2N, which helps to hold the His-249 in the proper position for iron binding. Disabling Glu-83 by mutation to an alanine seriously disturbs the H bond network, allowing His-249 to move away. A monovalent anion can help reestablish the normal network by providing a negative charge near the position of Glu-83 to reach charge balance, so that ligand His-249 is available again for iron binding.

To date all of the mutations have been to residues in the N-lobe of human transferrin (hTF/2N), because the N-lobe and the numerous single point mutants are produced in high yield in our mammalian expression system.

Mutations at other residues may also have an effect, more or less, depending on the environment of these residues. As pointed out by Baker et al. (23Baker H.M. Anderson B.F. Brodie A.M. Shongwe M.S.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9007-9013Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), so-called second shell effects can influence the metal binding properties of the protein and may account for the differences between the N- and C-lobe noted above. The second shell residues in hTF/2N include Gly-65, Glu-83, Tyr-85, Arg-124, Ser-248, Lys-206, and Lys-296, which form a hydrogen bond network around the metal binding site (see Fig. 1) (6MacGillivray R.T.

It is proposed that the “open-closed” conformation of the protein may be modulated by the di-lysine linkage under the different pH conditions encountered in the uptake and release of transferrin by cells. Mutation of any of the amino acids in the second shell might be predicted to have an influence on iron binding and has been demonstrated previously. For example, compared with those for wild-type hTF/2N, the thermodynamic stability of mutant G65R (19Lin L.-N. Mason A.B. Woodworth R.C. Brandts J.F. Biochem.

Although the rate of iron release from mutant K206R is not very different from that of wild-type hTF/2N (21Zak O. Aisen P. Crawley J.B. Joannou C.L. Patel K.J. Rafiq M. Evans R.W.

Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1993; 106B: 203-218Google Scholar). They are linked together by hydrogen bonds, and both are part of the second shell network in hTF/2N (Fig. 1). Because of the structural importance of Tyr-85 and Glu-83, we undertook a study of the effect these amino acid residues exert on the metal binding site and therefore produced the mutants, Y85F and E83A. Although neither of these side chains is ligated directly to the metal center, these mutants show considerably weaker metal binding ability. In the present report, the unique properties of these two mutant proteins are described, and the roles of these particular residues, Tyr-85 and Glu-83, in metal binding and release are examined. Transferrins are a family of iron-binding proteins that provide transport of iron from plasma to cells and buffer the iron level in plasma (1Harris D.C. Aisen P. Loehr T.M.

The full-length transferrin molecule (∼80 kDa) has two structurally similar iron binding sites distributed into two halves termed the N- and C-lobes, linked by a short peptide.

We have employed recombinant DNA techniques to address the specific role a particular residue plays in the metal binding properties of transferrin. To date all of the mutations have been to residues in the N-lobe of human transferrin (hTF/2N), because the N-lobe and the numerous single point mutants are produced in high yield in our mammalian expression system. In contrast the recombinant C-lobe has proved to be difficult to produce, and the yield has been very low (15Mason A.B. Tam B.M. Woodworth R.C. Oliver R.W.A. Green B.N. Lin L.-N. Brandts J.F.

https://openalex.org/W2096067529,"Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is a neuromodulator expressed with great anatomical specificity throughout the nervous system. Cell-specific expression of the VIP gene is mediated by a tissue specifier element (TSE) located within a 2.7-kilobase (kb) region between −5.2 and −2.5 kb upstream from the transcription start site, and requires an intact promoter proximal VIP-CRE (cyclic AMP-responsive element) (Hahm, S. H., and Eiden, L. E. (1997) <i>J. Neurochem.</i> 67, 1872–1881). We now report that the TSE comprises a 425-base pair domain located between −4.7 and −4.2 kb containing two AT-rich octamer-like sequences. The 425-base pair TSE is sufficient to provide full cell-specific regulation of the VIP gene, when fused to the 5′ proximal 1.55 kb of the VIP gene. Mutational analysis and gel shift assays of these octamer-like sequences indicate that the binding of proteins related to the ubiquitously expressed POU-homeodomain proteins Oct-1 and/or Oct-2 to these octamer-like sequences plays a central role for the function of the TSE. The TSE interacts with three additional discrete domains besides the cAMP response element, which are located within the proximal 1.55 kb of the VIP gene, to provide cell-specific expression. An upstream domain from −1.55 to −1.37 kb contains E-boxes and MEF2-like motifs, and deletion of this domain results in complete abrogation of cell-specific transcriptional activity. The region from −1.37 to −1.28 kb contains a STAT motif, and further removal of this domain allows the upstream TSE to act as an enhancer in both SH-EP and HeLa cells. The sequence from −1.28 to −0.9 kb containing a non-canonical AP-1 binding sequence (Symes, A., Gearan, T., Eby, J., and Fink, J. S. (1997) <i>J. Biol. Chem.</i>272, 9648–9654), is absolutely required for TSE-dependent cellspecific expression of the VIP gene. Thus, five discrete domains of the VIP gene provide a combination of enhancer and repressor activities, each completely contingent on VIP gene context, that together result in cell-specific transcription of the VIP gene."

The strain expressing this mutant Fe protein is able to grow under nitrogen-fixing conditions. This contrasts with an A. vinelandii strain described previously which is unable to grow under nitrogen-fixing conditions and which expresses an Fe protein variant that has an alanine to serine mutation at position 157. The A157S Fe protein was unable to support substrate reduction by nitrogenase because of an inability to undergo a required MgATP-induced conformational change. Although the A157G strain grows at 55% of the rate of the wild-type strain, purified A157G Fe protein is only able to support substrate reduction in in vitro assays at a rate that is approximately 20% of the rate supported by the wild-type Fe protein. Electron paramagnetic resonance, circular dichroism spectroscopies, and enzymatic activity data indicate that the A157G Fe protein adopts the correct conformation upon the binding of MgATP. However, kinetic studies using chelation show that this protein undergoes the conformational change more slowly than the wild-type protein. Thus, this mutant has lower activity because of an impaired ability to undergo this conformational change. Comparison of two available x-ray crystal structures of the native Fe protein alone and complexed with the MoFe protein has provided us with a model to explain the change in activity in alanine 157 mutants. Steric interactions with the side chain of residue 157 influence the protein's ability to undergo the initial MgATP-induced conformational change. In the case of the A157G mutant, however, once the correct conformation is attained, the protein can participate in all subsequent reactions including complex formation, electron transfer, and MgATP hydrolysis.

The two identical subunits are encoded by the nifHgene and are bridged by a single [4Fe-4S] cluster to form a ∼60-kDa holoprotein that has two binding sites for MgATP (for recent reviews, see Refs. 6Howard J.B. Rees D.C. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2965-2982Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar and 11Burgess B.K. Lowe D.J. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2983-3011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1408) Google Scholar). Although the binding site for the terminal phosphate of MgATP is approximately 20 Å from the [4Fe-4S] cluster (9Georgiadis M.M. Komiya H. Chakrabarti P. Woo D. Kornuc J.J. Rees D.C. Science. 1992; 257: 1653-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar), the binding of MgATP to the Fe protein causes a large conformational change that affects many of the properties of that cluster (11Burgess B.K. Lowe D.J. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2983-3011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1408) Google Scholar). After this conformational change the Fe protein is able to bind productively to its physiological redox partner, the MoFe protein of nitrogenase. That protein is an ∼240-kDa tetramer composed of two α and two β subunits encoded by the nifD andnifK genes, respectively (6Howard J.B. Rees D.C. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2965-2982Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar, 12Kim J. Rees D.C. Nature. 1992; 360: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). The MoFe holoprotein has two distinct types of metal clusters. The P-clusters are [8Fe-7S] clusters that are believed to accept electrons from the Fe protein (13Peters J.W. Stowell M.H.B. Soltis S.M. Finnegan M.G. Johnson M.K. Rees D.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1181-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). The other type of metal cluster in the MoFe protein is called the iron-molybdenum cofactor (FeMo cofactor) and is a [Mo-7Fe-9S-homocitrate] cluster that appears to accept electrons from the P-cluster and transfer them to dinitrogen (11Burgess B.K. Lowe D.J. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2983-3011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1408) Google Scholar, 12Kim J. Rees D.C. Nature. 1992; 360: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 13Peters J.W.

Rees D.C. Science. 1993; 260: 792-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Although the Fe protein alone can bind MgATP, MgATP hydrolysis only occurs after the Fe protein binds to the MoFe protein. How the energy released by MgATP hydrolysis is utilized by the Fe protein·MoFe protein complex is currently not understood. However, the fact that the Fe protein is the only known reductant that can reduce the MoFe protein in such a way that the latter can reduce dinitrogen is no doubt related to the energy transduction step.There are currently two possible explanations for the fact that, unlike other proteins that bind nucleotides and undergo conformational changes, the Fe protein is a dimer. The dominant hypothesis, which is based on kinetic studies with dithionite as an electron donor (17Thorneley R.N.F. Lowe D.J. Biochem. J. 1983; 215: 393-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), suggests that the enzyme somehow needs to couple the hydrolysis of two molecules of MgATP to the transfer of a single electron from the Fe protein to the MoFe protein (11Burgess B.K. Lowe D.J. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2983-3011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1408) Google Scholar). Recent work with other electron donors has shown that the [4Fe-4S] cluster of the Fe protein can be reduced by two electrons to an all ferrous state (18Watt G.D. Reddy K.R.N. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1994; 53: 281-294Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 19Angove H.C. Yoo S.J. Burgess B.K. Münck E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 8730-8731Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This leaves open a second possibility that the Fe protein is a dimer because it can bind two molecules of its physiological electron donor, flavodoxin, in order to accept two electrons into a single [4Fe-4S] cluster. Regardless of which scenario is correct, the binding of two molecules of MgATP causes a large conformational change that affects a single [4Fe-4S] cluster. Although the structure of the Fe protein with MgATP bound has not been reported, there is substantial evidence from x-ray scattering experiments (20Chen L. Gavini N. Tsuruta H. Eliezer D. Burgess B.K. Doniach S. Hodgson K.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3290-3294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the structure of an Fe protein·ADP·AlF4−·MoFe protein complex (10Schindelin H. Kisker C. Schlessman J.L. Howard J.B. Rees D.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), and mutagenesis experiments (21Seefeldt L.C. Morgan T.V. Dean D.R.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4766-4775Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) that the conformational change involves interactions between the two subunits of the Fe protein.Our earlier mutagenesis experiments have identified a highly conserved region of the Fe protein around Ala-157 which is located at the subunit interface and appears to be critical for the MgATP-induced conformational change (26Gavini N. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21179-21186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This region is not present in other nucleotide-binding proteins or in any other protein whose sequence is in the data base. X-ray crystallographic analysis of the Fe protein alone (9Georgiadis M.M. Komiya H. Chakrabarti P. Woo D. Kornuc J.J. Rees D.C. Science. 1992; 257: 1653-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar) and in the Fe protein·ADP·AlF4−·MoFe protein complex (10Schindelin H. Kisker C. Schlessman J.L. Howard J.B. Rees D.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar) reveals that this region is part of helix α5 located at the subunit interface which extends from residue 151 to 176. This helix moves substantially when the free Fe protein structure is compared with the structure of the Fe protein in the complex. Our previous studies have shown that mutation of Ala-157 to Ser results in a protein that can still bind MgATP normally but is unable to undergo the MgATP-induced conformational change. To understand how the mutation of this residue can prevent the MgATP-induced conformational change, we have begun to mutate this and neighboring conserved residues. The mutation of Ala-157 to residues larger than Ala leads to completely inactive protein. Here we report the construction and characterization of an A157G Fe protein that is active.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESUnless otherwise noted, all chemicals and reagents were obtained from Fisher Scientific, Baxter Scientific, or Sigma.Construction and Expression of the Variant Azotobacter vinelandii StrainA fragment of the A. vinelandii chromosome containing the entire nifH and nifD genes as well as part of the nifK gene was cloned into the bacteriophage M13mp18. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the Mutagene mutagenesis kit, version 2, from Bio-Rad. The oligonucleotide used for mutagenesis was purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA. The oligonucleotide was 29 bases long and was complementary to the region surrounding the Ala-157 codon. The oligonucleotide was degenerate at the Ala-157 codon, allowing the production of several Fe protein mutants at this position. After mutagenesis, bacteriophage containing mutated nifH genes were selected through DNA sequencing using the Sequenase II sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Double-stranded DNA was isolated from these phage using a Qiagen kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). This DNA was then transformed back into two A. vinelandii strains, the wild-type Trans strain and the ΔnifH strain DJ54 using a published method (27Page W.J. von Tigerstrom M. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 139: 1058-1061Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, the chromosomal copy of the gene is replaced with the mutated gene through homologous recombination, allowing production of variant Fe protein in its native background, under the control of its native promoter. The recombination of the mutated nifH gene containing the Ala to Gly mutation into the bacterial chromosome of the DJ54 strain resulted in a strain that was able to grow under nitrogen-fixing conditions. All subsequent work was done on this DJ54-derived strain.Cell Growth and Protein PurificationThe A157G A. vinelandii strain was grown in 180-liter batches in a 250-liter New Brunswick fermenter in Burke's minimal medium under ammonium acetate-limiting derepressing conditions. Ammonium acetate was added to the medium to a final concentration of 2 mm, such that the ammonia was exhausted during mid-log phase. The decrease in ammonia concentration was monitored both by observing the growth rate of the culture as measured by cell density and through the use of Sigma ammonia color reagent. After the consumption of the ammonia, the culture was grown for an additional 3 h. The cells were then harvested using a flow-through centrifugal harvester (Cepa, Germany). The cell paste was washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and was kept on dry ice until needed. After the initial preparation of crude extract, all subsequent procedures, with the exception of the measurement of the circular dichroism spectra, were performed in the presence of 2 mm sodium dithionite. The variant Fe protein was purified as described previously (28Burgess B.K. Jacobs D.B. Stiefel E.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 614: 196-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) with some slight modifications. Between 0.5 and 1.0 kg of cell paste was thawed in 1.4 volumes of 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and degassed thoroughly. Sodium dithionite was added to give a final concentration of 2 mm, and the cells were then broken by passing them through a Gaulin cell homogenizer two or three times at 6,000 p.s.i. to make a crude extract. The crude extract was then made 10 μg/ml with both DNase and RNase, degassed for an additional 2 h, ultracentrifuged for 80 min at 31,000 rpm in a Beckman Ti 45 fixed-angle rotor, and then loaded onto a 5 × 25-cm DEAE-cellulose (Whatman) ion-exchange column. Throughout the purification procedure the protein was monitored by absorbance at 405 nm. The Fe protein was eluted with a linear 0.1–0.5 m NaCl gradient. The Fe-containing fraction was loaded onto a 2.5 × 100-cm Ultrogel AcA34 (ICF, France) gel filtration column and eluted with 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 m NaCl. The Fe protein-containing fraction was then loaded onto a 1.5 × 10-cm Q-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column and eluted with a linear 0.1–0.5 m NaCl gradient. The eluate was then loaded onto a 1.5 × 10-cm DEAE-cellulose column and concentrated by elution in the reverse direction using 0.5 m NaCl. The purified Fe protein was analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and its concentration was determined using the Biuret method (29Gornall A.G. Bardawill C.J. David M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1949; 177: 751-766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).SpectroscopyFor spectroscopic experiments, all samples were made in a Vacuum Atmospheres dry box under argon. For EPR, the samples were 2 mm in sodium dithionite. The spectra were recorded on a Bruker ESP 300 EZ spectrophotometer equipped with an Oxford Instruments ESR-9002 liquid helium continuous flow cryostat. For CD experiments, the [4Fe-4S] cluster was oxidized by one of two methods. In one case, a degassed solution of 20 mm indigo disulfonate (MC/B, Norwood, OH) was added to the protein until a blue color remained. The protein was incubated in the dye longer than 15 min and was then separated from the dye by passage over a 1 × 10-cm Sephadex G-25 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column. The other method consists of oxidizing the protein by passage over a specially prepared column as described previously (30Ashby G.A. Thorneley R.N.F. Biochem. J. 1987; 246: 455-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The column (1 × 10 cm) consists of, from top to bottom, 5 cm of indigo disulfonate dye bound to AG 1-X8 (Bio-Rad) and 5 cm of P6DG (Bio-Rad). The protein was loaded onto the top of the column and was allowed to incubate longer than 15 min. It was then eluted with 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The CD spectra were obtained using a Jasco J720 spectropolarimeter. Ultraviolet/visible spectra were recorded on a Hewlett Packard 8452/A diode array spectrophotometer.Activity AssaysEnzyme activity was determined by measuring both hydrogen evolution under an argon atmosphere and ethylene production under an atmosphere of 10% acetylene and 90% argon. Assays were performed by incubating the Fe and MoFe proteins together at 30 °C in the presence of a reaction mixture and 20 mmsodium dithionite for 3–10 min in calibrated stoppered vials. Reaction mixture consists of 250 mmTES, 1The abbreviation used is: TES,N-tris[hydroxymethyl] methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid. pH 7.4, 100 mm ATP, 250 mm MgCl2, 300 mm creatine phosphate, and 500 units/ml creatine phosphokinase. 0.6 ml of the reaction mix and 0.3 ml of 250 mm TES, pH 7.4, were degassed in calibrated vials. 0.1 ml of a 200 mm sodium dithionite solution was then added. The ratio of Fe protein to MoFe protein used was 0.5:1, and the total protein concentration was 0.5 mg. The reaction was initiated by the addition of Fe protein. After incubation, the reaction was killed by the addition of 100 μl of 30% trichloroacetic acid. The amount of product evolved was determined on a Varian 3700 gas chromatograph using either a flame ionization detector (ethylene production) or a thermal conductivity detector (hydrogen evolution). The crude extract ethylene production assay was carried out as above except that the reaction was initiated by the addition of 0.1 ml of either wild-type or A157G crude extract to a calibrated vial containing degassed reaction mix, water, and 20 mm sodium dithionite. The total protein concentration used in the crude extract activity assay was determined using the Biuret method (29Gornall A.G. Bardawill C.J. David M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1949; 177: 751-766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was found to be 45.2 and 36.6 mg/ml for the wild-type and A157G crude extracts, respectively. The ATP/2e− ratio was determined by performing a standard hydrogen evolution assay in the absence of creatine phosphate and creatine phosphokinase and then determining the amount of ADP generated over the course of the assay. The assays were incubated for increasing amounts of time. Times were selected such that the rate of hydrogen evolution was linear with respect to time so as to avoid complications resulting from inhibition of the assay by the formation of ADP. ADP concentrations were determined using a high performance liquid chromatography method (24Seefeldt L.C. Mortenson L.E. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 31Wehr C.T. Nucleic Acid Constituents by High Performance Liquid Chromatography. Varian Associates Inc., Palo Alto, CA1980Google Scholar). An aliquot of the liquid from the killed activity assay was centrifuged to remove precipitated protein. The nucleotide concentration of a portion of this was measured by loading it onto a Supelco LC-18-T C18 reversed phase column and eluting with 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0. Nucleotides were detected using a Waters 486 tunable absorbance detector at 259 nm. An extinction coefficient of 15,400 m−1cm−1 was used to determine the concentration of nucleotide.Chelation AssayThe chelation assay followed published methods (21Seefeldt L.C. Morgan T.V. Dean D.R. Mortenson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6680-6688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Walker G.A. Mortenson L.E. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2382-2388Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Chelation was performed by degassing a solution of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 6.25 mmα,α′-dipyridyl in a stoppered quartz cuvette. Fe protein was added to a concentration of 0.8 mg/ml and the spectrophotometer blanked. The chelation reaction was started by the addition of MgATP to a final concentration of 5 mm ATP and 10 mmMgCl2. The progress of the reaction was followed by monitoring the absorbance of the solution at 520 nm. The ability of the Fe protein to interact with the wild-type MoFe protein was assessed by performing the chelation assay in the presence of MoFe protein (1.29 mg/ml) (25Ryle M.J. Seefeldt L.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4766-4775Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 32Walker G.A. Mortenson L.E. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2382-2388Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In this case, a regenerating system was used to prevent the accumulation of ADP. The regenerating system used consisted of 6 mm creatine phosphate and 0.125 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase. The Fe protein of nitrogenase is one example of a large family of proteins (e.g. H-ras p21, recA, myosin) that have energy transduction mechanisms involving switching between conformational states upon nucleotide binding or hydrolysis (1Koonin E.V.

Comparisons of the sequences and structures of this family of proteins have revealed two highly conserved regions that are involved in nucleotide interactions. One region, which is called the Walker A motif or the phosphate-binding loop (P-loop), contains residues 9–16 of the Fe protein and includes residues that are involved in both phosphate binding and stabilization of the leaving group (5Howard J.B. Rees D.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 235-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 6Howard J.B. Rees D.C. Chem.

Nature. 1997; 387: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The second region, which in the Fe protein extends from residues 125 to 132, includes a highly conserved Asp-X-X-Gly Walker B motif and corresponds to the switch II region in the G-protein family (5Howard J.B.

https://openalex.org/W2078662881,"We previously reported (Previs, S. F., Fernandez, C. A., Yang, D., Soloviev, M. V., David, F., and Brunengraber, H. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 19806–19815) that glucose made in isolated livers from starved rats perfused with physiological concentrations of lactate, pyruvate, and either [2-13C]- or [U-13C3]glycerol had a mass isotopomer distribution incompatible with glucose being made from a homogeneously labeled pool of triose phosphates. Similar data were obtained in live rats infused with [U-13C3]glycerol. We ascribed the labeling heterogeneity to major decreases in glycerol concentration and enrichment across the liver. We concluded that [13C]glycerol is unsuitable for tracing the contribution of gluconeogenesis to total glucose production. We now report isotopic heterogeneity of gluconeogenesis in hepatocytes, even when all cells are in contact with identical concentrations and enrichments of gluconeogenic substrates. Total rat hepatocytes were incubated with concentrations of glycerol, lactate, and pyruvate that were kept constant by substrate infusions. To modulate competition between substrates, the (glycerol)/(lactate + pyruvate) infusion ratio ranged from 0.23 to 3.60. Metabolic and isotopic steady states were achieved in all cases. The apparent contribution of gluconeogenesis to glucose production (f) was calculated from the mass isotopomer distribution of glucose. When all substrates were13C-labeled, f was 97%, as expected in glycogen-deprived hepatocytes. As the infusion ratio ([13C]glycerol)/(lactate + pyruvate) increased,f increased from 73% to 94%. In contrast, as the infusion ratio (glycerol)/([13C]lactate + [13C]pyruvate) increased, f decreased from 93% to 76%. In all cases, f increased with the rate of supply of the substrate that was labeled. Variations in fshow that the 13C labeling of triose phosphates was not equal in all hepatocytes, even when exposed to the same substrate concentrations and enrichments. We also showed that zonation of glycerol kinase activity is minor in rat liver. We conclude that zonation of other processes than glycerol phosphorylation contributes to the heterogeneity of triose phosphate labeling from glycerol in rat liver. We previously reported (Previs, S. F., Fernandez, C. A., Yang, D., Soloviev, M. V., David, F., and Brunengraber, H. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 19806–19815) that glucose made in isolated livers from starved rats perfused with physiological concentrations of lactate, pyruvate, and either [2-13C]- or [U-13C3]glycerol had a mass isotopomer distribution incompatible with glucose being made from a homogeneously labeled pool of triose phosphates. Similar data were obtained in live rats infused with [U-13C3]glycerol. We ascribed the labeling heterogeneity to major decreases in glycerol concentration and enrichment across the liver. We concluded that [13C]glycerol is unsuitable for tracing the contribution of gluconeogenesis to total glucose production. We now report isotopic heterogeneity of gluconeogenesis in hepatocytes, even when all cells are in contact with identical concentrations and enrichments of gluconeogenic substrates. Total rat hepatocytes were incubated with concentrations of glycerol, lactate, and pyruvate that were kept constant by substrate infusions. To modulate competition between substrates, the (glycerol)/(lactate + pyruvate) infusion ratio ranged from 0.23 to 3.60. Metabolic and isotopic steady states were achieved in all cases. The apparent contribution of gluconeogenesis to glucose production (f) was calculated from the mass isotopomer distribution of glucose. When all substrates were13C-labeled, f was 97%, as expected in glycogen-deprived hepatocytes. As the infusion ratio ([13C]glycerol)/(lactate + pyruvate) increased,f increased from 73% to 94%. In contrast, as the infusion ratio (glycerol)/([13C]lactate + [13C]pyruvate) increased, f decreased from 93% to 76%. In all cases, f increased with the rate of supply of the substrate that was labeled. Variations in fshow that the 13C labeling of triose phosphates was not equal in all hepatocytes, even when exposed to the same substrate concentrations and enrichments. We also showed that zonation of glycerol kinase activity is minor in rat liver. We conclude that zonation of other processes than glycerol phosphorylation contributes to the heterogeneity of triose phosphate labeling from glycerol in rat liver. When a polymer is synthesized from a monomeric compound labeled with a stable isotope (13C, 2H,15N, or 18O), the mass isotopomer distribution (MID) 1The abbreviations are: MID, mass isotopomer distribution; GNG, gluconeogenesis; MIDA, mass isotopomer distribution analysis; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. 1The abbreviations are: MID, mass isotopomer distribution; GNG, gluconeogenesis; MIDA, mass isotopomer distribution analysis; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. of the polymer, measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, is a unique function of the isotopic enrichment (p) of the precursor subunit (1Lee W.-N.P.

Conversely, computation of the MID of the polymer yields the enrichment of the monomer.Mass isotopomer distribution analysis (MIDA) was proposed (2Hellerstein M.K. Neese R. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: E988-E1001PubMed Google Scholar) as a method for estimating the fractional synthesis rate of various biopolymers (fatty acids, cholesterol, glucose) synthesized in vivo and in vitro in the presence of 13C tracers that label the appropriate monomer (acetyl-CoA or triose phosphates). Computation of the MID of the biopolymer yields both the fractional synthetic rate and the enrichment of the monomeric precursor. A variant of MIDA, isotopomer spectral analysis, was presented by Kelleher et al. (4Kelleher J.K. Kharroubi A.T. Aldaghlas T.A. Shambat I.B. Kennedy K.A. Holleran A.L. Masterson T.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: E384-E395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The validity of MIDA and isotopomer spectral analysis requires that two parameters be constant in all cells making the polymer, namely the fractional synthetic rate and the enrichment of the monomeric precursor. When the enrichment of the precursor is not constant, computation of the MID of the polymer yields erroneous values for the enrichment of the monomeric precursor and for the fractional synthesis. In fact, the calculated fractional synthesis is not the integrated average of this parameter. This is because the precursor enrichment appears in the equations for the amount of each isotopomer 2In the context of this report, the word “isotopomer” refers to “mass isotopomer.” Positional isotopomers are not considered here. 2In the context of this report, the word “isotopomer” refers to “mass isotopomer.” Positional isotopomers are not considered here. as a nonlinear parameter.

Thus, MIDA of glucose labeled from13C-labeled precursors was proposed to estimate the contribution of gluconeogenesis (GNG) to total glucose production (f) (2Hellerstein M.K. Neese R. Am. J.

Calculations of f would not be subject to artifacts of isotopic exchange which affects calculations of GNG from the amount of 13C tracers incorporated into glucose (9Kelleher J.K. Am. J.

However, the main underlying assumption of MIDA is that the triose phosphate pool(s) of all gluconeogenic cells must be at about the same enrichment. To the extent that the triose phosphates are not equally labeled, fis underestimated.Investigations of GNG have been conducted in which MIDA was applied for determining f. Some investigators have concluded that MIDA does provide a reliable estimation of f during the infusion of [13C]glycerol (5Neese R.A. Schwartz J.M. Faix D. Turner S.M. Letscher A. Vu D.

However, we demonstrated previously that the use of [13C] glycerol and MIDA is limited for estimatingf (11Previs S.F. Fernandez C.A. Yang D. Soloviev M.V. David F. Brunengraber H. J. Biol.

Brunengraber H. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: E18-E26PubMed Google Scholar). We concluded that the major mechanisms responsible for our observations were (i) a gradient of glycerol concentration and (ii) a gradient of the 13C enrichment of glycerol across the liver (11Previs S.F.

Brunengraber H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: E1110-E1117PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, most likely, triose phosphates were not equally labeled from [13C]glycerol in all hepatocytes. Therefore, the assumption of a triose phosphate pool of homogeneous enrichment is probably not valid for all conditions. Indeed, Péroni et al. (15Péroni O. Large V. Diraison F. Beylot M. Metabolism. 1997; 46: 1358-1363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) infused [2-13C]glycerol to 2-day-starved diabetic rats with undetectable liver glycogen and calculated an impossibly lowf of 43%.In an attempt to further test our hypothesis, i.e. thatf was underestimated due to heterogeneous triose phosphate labeling induced by substrate gradients across the liver, hepatocytes from 48-h fasted rats were incubated in a medium that contained glycerol, lactate and pyruvate. Under these conditions, GNG should account for 100% of glucose production. The substrates were maintained at steady state concentrations by constant infusions following loading boluses. The substrate infusion ratio glycerol/(lactate + pyruvate) was varied to simulate gluconeogenic conditions favoring either glycerol or (lactate + pyruvate). Glycerol, lactate, and pyruvate were present in all experiments; however, the source of 13C was alternated in different experiments (either glycerol or (lactate + pyruvate)). Both singly 13C- and U-13C3-labeled substrates were tested. This design guaranteed that all cells had equal exposure to all substrates and 13C labeling. Our data show that calculations of f via MIDA are limited by variations in the relative contribution of glycerol versus lactate + pyruvate to triose phosphates in gluconeogenic hepatocytes. This finding is true whether one uses singly 13C- or uniformly13C3-labeled tracers. In addition, we found minimal zonation of hepatic glycerokinase activity in 48-h fasted rats.RESULTSSteady state concentrations of lactate, pyruvate, and glycerol were achieved under all conditions tested. As an example, Fig. 1 shows these concentrations under the conditions of row 3 of Table I. Glucose production was linear (r = 0.99; Fig. 1 and last column of Table I). In control flasks incubated without any substrates, concentrations of glycerol, lactate, pyruvate, and glucose were very low (bottom row of Table I). Thus, our incubation conditions allow to keep hepatocytes under physiological concentrations of substrates without having to resort to perifusion techniques (25McMenamy R.H. Kleineke J. Roil W. Soling H.D. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).Table I (right column) shows that the production of glucose, expressed as a percent of the maximum possible production from the infused substrates, increased as the substrate infusion ratio glycerol/(lactate + pyruvate) increased. At a low infusion ratio, when lactate/pyruvate is the dominant gluconeogenic precursor, a fraction of the substrate must be oxidized in the citric acid cycle to provide energy for glucose production (6 ATP per glucose formed from lactate). Similar partial oxidation of lactate has been reported in kidney slices synthesizing glucose (26Weidemann M.J. Krebs H.A. Biochem. J. 1969; 112: 149-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In contrast, when glycerol is the dominant gluconeogenic substrate, the yield of glucose production is much higher because the conversion of glycerol to glucose generates ATP (4 or 2 ATP per glucose formed from glycerol, depending on whether the conversion of α-glycerophosphate to dihydroxyacetone phosphate involves reduction of NAD+ or FAD).Isotopic steady state of glucose labeling was reached within the first 5 min of the incubation. As an example, Fig. 2 shows parameter f, which is the apparent contribution of GNG to glucose production under the conditions of row 3 of Table I. Under these conditions, when all the substrates were U-13C3-labeled, fwas 97%, as expected in glycogen-depleted hepatocytes. However, when glycerol was U-13C3-labeled and lactate and pyruvate were unlabeled, f was 93%. Additionally, when lactate and pyruvate were U-13C3-labeled and glycerol was unlabeled, f was 78%. In the case when lactate and pyruvate were U-13C3-labeled, the first point, obtained at 5 min during the incubation, is slightly lower than the average of the other points (i.e. 71% versus78%). This does not significantly impact on the calculation off from glucose obtained at 45 min during the incubation. This is because (i) the f calculated at 5 min (i.e. 71%) is within 91% of the final f(i.e. 78%) and (ii) the amount of glucose produced after only 5 min represents less than 10% of the total glucose produced during the incubation. Similar isotopic steady states were maintained using the other substrate infusion ratios (data not shown).Figure 2Isotopic steady state achieved during the hepatocyte incubations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The enrichment of glycerol, lactate and pyruvate was measured in samples obtained at the end of the incubation. When glycerol and [3-13C]lactate + [3-13C]pyruvate were infused, the glycerol pool actually became 13C-labeled during the incubation. As the substrate infusion ratio (glycerol)/([3-13C]lactate + [3-13C]pyruvate) increased from 0.23 to 0.61, 1.4, and 3.6, the enrichment of glycerol at 40 min was 12 ± 3%, 5 ± 2%, 3 ± 1%, and 1 ± 1%, respectively. When [2-13C]glycerol and (lactate + pyruvate) were infused, labeling of the (lactate + pyruvate) pool (4 ± 2%) was observed only at the highest substrate infusion ratio ([2-13C]glycerol)/(lactate + pyruvate) of 3.60.Fig. 3 shows f calculated in all protocols that used U-13C3-labeled substrates. When all substrates were uniformly 13C-labeled,f was 97%, as expected in glycogen-deprived hepatocytes. As the infusion ratio ([U-13C3]glycerol)/(lactate + pyruvate) increased, f increased from 73% to 94%. In contrast, as the infusion ratio (glycerol)/([U-13C3]lactate + [U-13C3]pyruvate) increased, fdecreased from 93% to 76%. In all cases, f increased with the rate of supply of the substrate that was labeled.Figure 3Apparent contribution of GNG (f) in experiments with U-13C3-labeled substrates. f was calculated from the mass isotopomer distribution of glucose isolated at the end of experiments conducted with the substrate combinations and infusion ratios indicated.

In all cases, triose phosphate equilibration increased with the rate of supply of the substrate that was labeled.Figure 5Triose phosphate equilibration calculated from either [2-13C]glycerol and lactate + pyruvate or glycerol and [3-13C]lactate + [3-13C]pyruvate at the different substrate infusion ratios.

After measurement of the MID of each pool, seven increasing dilutions of the [13C]glucose (up to 20-fold) were made by adding increasing amounts of a solution of unlabeled glucose. Then, after purification on resins, the MID of the diluted glucose samples were measured, converted to f values that were compared with f values calculated using the unlabeled glucose dilution factor. The regression slopes of the seven points of each comparison ranged from 0.965 to 0.99, withr2 > 0.99. Thus, we are confident of the precision and linearity of our measurements of the MID of glucose, whether labeled from singly or uniformly 13C-labeled substrates.To test whether low values of f obtained in previousin vivo and perfused rat liver experiments with [13C]glycerol (11Previs S.F.

Table II shows, for livers of 2-day-starved rats, the total activity and zonal distribution of glutamine synthetase, lactate dehydrogenase, and glycerol kinase. Data for zonation of glutamine synthetase and lactate dehydrogenase, as well as total activity of glycerol kinase, are in agreement with published reports (27Jungermann K. Kietzmann T. Annu. Rev.

Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14452-14463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) as an effective and reliable method for estimating f, the contribution of GNG to total glucose production. Glucose can be considered as a dimer of triose phosphates, the 13C enrichment of which should be very similar under most conditions. Neese et al. showed, with mathematical simulations, that a lack of perfect equilibration between the enrichments of the triose phosphates has minor impact on calculations of f, unless the ratio of enrichments of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate is greater than 1.6 or smaller than 0.65. Thus, MIDA should be applicable to studies of GNG provided that (i) f has the same value in all gluconeogenic cells, and (ii) that the enrichment of triose phosphates is the same in all these cells.These two conditions may not always be fulfilled because of the metabolic zonation of the liver lobule. When we infused [U-13C3]glycerol or [U-13C3]lactate to 2-day-starved rats (11Previs S.F. Fernandez C.A. Yang D. Soloviev M.V. David F. Brunengraber H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19806-19815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), the MID of plasma glucose yielded f values of 75% and 97%, respectively. The value of f obtained with [U-13C3]lactate was expected inasmuch as the liver of these rats was glycogen-depleted, and GNG was the only source of glucose. However, the low values of f measured with [U-13C3]glycerol were unexpected. Similar low values of f had been measured in 60-h-fasted humans infused with [U-13C3]glycerol (12Landau B.R. Fernandez C.A. Previs S.F. Ekberg K. Chandramouli V. Wahren J. Kalhan S.C. Brunengraber H. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: E18-E26PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, in overnight-fasted monkeys, in whom one expects some contribution of glycogenolysis to glucose production, [U-13C3]glycerol and [U-13C3]lactate yielded f values of 48% and 80%, respectively (11Previs S.F.

The low f calculated with [U-13C3]glycerol suggested that, with this tracer, the enrichment of triose phosphates across the liver lobule was not constant. This could result from zonation of glycerol kinase or from a substantial decrease in glycerol concentration across the liver lobule. We found no data on the zonation of glycerol kinase in the literature. We showed that the concentration of glycerol decreases up to 4-fold across the liver of dogs (13Previs S.F. Martin S.K.

Biochemical studies reveal two binding sites per molecule for both effectors, tyrosine or tryptophan. A single binding site is built up by helix 8 and helices 4 and 5 of two different subunits. The binding sites have been analyzed in the active enzyme by site directed mutagenesis of critical codons of the coding gene, ARO7. Gly-141 and Ser-142, which both reside on helix 8, are involved in the binding of tyrosine or tryptophan presumably by interacting specifically with the amino- and carboxylate-groups of these amino acid effectors. Interaction with Thr-145 of helix 8 is required for a strong tyrosine binding to the allosteric site. Replacement of Arg-75, which connects helices 4 and 5 or of Arg-76, which is part of helix 5 by alanine residues, resulted in unregulated enzymes. These two residues are bonded to the carboxylate group and phenolic hydroxyl group of tyrosine, respectively, but do not interact with tryptophan by hydrogen bonding in the crystal structures. Phenylalanine, which has low binding affinity slightly activated the chorismate mutase. A T145V mutant chorismate mutase, however, showed increased activation by phenylalanine. Our results support a mechanism by which tyrosine contracts the allosteric site by interacting with its phenolic hydroxyl group. Tryptophan works in an inverse way by opening the allosteric site through the steric size of its side chain. Tyrosine and tryptophan are the regulators of the dimeric yeast chorismate mutase.

Tryptophan works in an inverse way by opening the allosteric site through the steric size of its side chain. Chorismate is the last common precursor of the amino acids tyrosine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan. Chorismate mutase (EC5.4.99.5) catalyzes the intramolecular rearrangement of chorismate to prephenate, which is the first committed step in the biosynthesis of phenylalanine and tyrosine (1Haslam E. The Shikimate Pathway. Butterworth & Co., London, UK1974Google Scholar) (for a review, see Ref. 2Braus G.H. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 349-370Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This reaction is the only example of a pericyclic reaction in primary metabolism and has been studied in detail (for reviews see Refs. 3Lee A.Y. Stewart J.D. Clardy J. Ganem B. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 195-203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar and4Ganem B. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1996; 35: 936-945Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The enzyme competes for a common substrate with anthranilate synthase (EC 4.1.3.27), which catalyzes the first step of the tryptophan-specific branch. The chorismate mutase ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae is a key regulatory element in the aromatic amino acid biosynthesis pathway and is activated by tryptophan and inhibited by tyrosine (5Schmidheini T. Sperisen P. Paravicini G. Hütter R. Braus G. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1245-1253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Schmidheini T. Mösch H.-U. Evans J.N.S. Braus G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3660-3668Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This antagonism plays an important role in maintaining a balanced biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids in the cell. The yeast chorismate mutase holoenzyme is composed of two 30-kDa subunits encoded by the ARO7 gene (6Schmidheini T. Mösch H.-U. Evans J.N.S. Braus G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3660-3668Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and serves as simple model for an allosteric enzyme. Phenylalanine is not an inhibitor of yeast chorismate mutase. This is in contrast to the homologous plastidic chorismate mutase from Arabidopsis thaliana, which is inhibited by both amino acids, tyrosine and phenylalanine (7Eberhard J. Raesecke H.-R. Schmid J. Amrhein N. FEBS Lett. 1993; 334: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Besides the heterotropic ligand induced effects, yeast chorismate mutase exhibits homotropic cooperative interactions for substrate binding (6Schmidheini T. Mösch H.-U. Evans J.N.S. Braus G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3660-3668Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Both kinetic properties of the enzyme can be rationalized in terms of a transition from a conformation having a low affinity for chorismate, the T (tense) state, to a conformation with high affinity for the substrate, the R (relaxed) state (8Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6105) Google Scholar). According to this two-state model, homotropic and heterotropic interactions proceed by the same transition. The influence of the allosteric regulators is best explained by local conformational changes induced by their competitive binding to the regulatory sites, therefore stabilizing either of the two states or inducing a conformational change of the overall enzyme structure. The crystal structures of a mutant enzyme (T226I), which is locked in the activated state (resolution of 2.2 Å) and of a tyrosine-bound wild-type enzyme (resolution of 2.8 Å) have been described (6Schmidheini T. Mösch H.-U. Evans J.N.S. Braus G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3660-3668Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 9Xue Y. Lipscomb W.N. Graf R. Schnappauf G. Braus G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Schnappauf G. Braus G. Lipscomb W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3330-3334Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The crystallographic structure determined by x-ray diffraction of the mutant enzyme showed that two tryptophan molecules were copurified and bound at the dimer interface. The three-dimensional structure of the wild-type enzyme cocrystallized with tyrosine showed two tyrosine molecules at those sites where tryptophan binds to the mutant enzyme (Fig. 1, A and B) (11Sträter N. Hakansson K. Schnappauf G. Braus G. Lipscomb W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3330-3334Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In addition two crystal structures of chorismate mutase in complex with a transition state analogue and with either the allosteric activator tryptophan (3.0 Å resolution) or the allosteric inhibitor tyrosine (2.8 Å) bound to the regulatory site were determined (12Sträter N. Schnappauf G. Braus G. Lipscomb W.N. Structure. 1997; 5: 1437-1452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Superposition of these two structures showed significant differences between their regulatory sites, whereas their catalytic domains superimposed closely. These results suggest that the regulatory and the catalytic domains could acquire different conformations independently of each other. In all crystallographic structures of yeast chorismate mutase characterized so far both effectors bind at a cleft, which is formed by helices 4 and 5 of one subunit and helix 8 of the other subunit (Fig. 1, A and B). To examine the model suggested by the structural studies we applied site-directed mutagenesis of ARO7 to investigate the effects of various amino acid replacements at the putative tryptophan and tyrosine binding sites. The wild-type and mutant enzymes were overexpressed in yeast using recombinant DNA technology and then purified for binding and activity assays. We found that tryptophan and tyrosine regulate the yeast chorismate mutase through binding to common residues at the dimer interface of the enzyme. Chorismic acid as barium salt was purchased from Sigma. Ethylamino-Sepharose was prepared following the protocol for activation of Sepharose CL-4B (13Dimroth P. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 125: 530-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and by coupling of the ligand, ethylamino-HCl, to the activated matrix. Protein solutions were concentrated by using stirred cells (volumes of 180 and 10 ml) with PM-10 ultrafiltration membranes from Amicon (Danvers, MA). The Mini 2D SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis system and the Bradford protein assay solution for determination of protein concentrations originated from Bio-Rad. Vent polymerase (Biolabs, Schwalbach, Germany) was used for polymerase chain reactions. All other chemicals were supplied by FLUKA (Buchs, Switzerland) or Sigma. The S. cerevisiae strain RH1242 (MATα, aro7, leu2–2) with the genetic background of the laboratory strain X2180–1B (MATα, gal2, SUC2, mal, CUP1) was used for expression of the chorismate mutase enzymes. Derivatives of plasmid pME605 (10Graf R. Dubaquié Y. Braus G.H. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1645-1648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used as overexpression system. Yeast transformation was carried out by the LiAc method (14Ito H. Jukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MV minimal medium for the cultivation of yeasts was described earlier (15Miozzari G. Niederberger P. Hütter R. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 48-59Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A polymerase chain reaction-based method was used for site-directed mutagenesis of ARO7 (16Giebel L.B. Spritz R.A. Nucl. Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4947Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reaction-generated DNA fragments were sequenced (17Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52497) Google Scholar) to confirm the presence of the mutation and to rule out any second-site mutations. Yeast cells were grown at 30 °C in 10-liter rotatory fermentors under aeration. Cells were harvested in mid-log phase at an A 546 of 4–6, washed twice with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, and stored in 1 ml of buffer/g of wet cells at −20 °C in the presence of protease inhibitors (0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 1 mmdl-dithiothreitol). For purification, 80–110 g of cells were thawed and run three times through a French pressure cell (18,000 p.s.i.). Cell debris was sedimented by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 20 min. The enzyme was purified as described previously (6Schmidheini T. Mösch H.-U. Evans J.N.S. Braus G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3660-3668Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to the equilibration buffer for the ethylamino-Sepharose column, dialysis was used to desalt protein extracts, and chorismate mutase was applied to a second MonoQ column (HR 5/5). Chorismate mutase was detected by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206602) Google Scholar) and by enzyme assays. Measurements of protein concentrations were performed using the Bradford assay (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214351) Google Scholar). Chorismate mutase activity was measured as described previously (5Schmidheini T. Sperisen P. Paravicini G. Hütter R. Braus G. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1245-1253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. The enzymatic conversion is stopped after 1 min by addition of HCl, and the product of the enzymatic reaction, prephenate, is converted to phenylpyruvate through a chemical reaction. Enzymatic activity is measured spectrophotometrically determining the concentration of phenylpyruvate. Since absorbance of phenylpyruvate is temperature dependent due to a keto-enol equilibrium, the assay was standardized by keeping enzymatic reactions at 30 °C and equilibrating the spectrophotometer cell to the same temperature. Reaction volumes of 250 μl containing 100 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mmdithiothreitol, optionally 0.1 mm tyrosine, 0.1 mm phenylalanine or 0.01 mm tryptophan, chorismate mutase enzyme, and chorismate in a range from 0.25 to 10 mm were used. The reaction was started by adding the mix of all ingredients to the prewarmed chorismate solution. Reaction was stopped by adding 250 μl of 1 m HCl. After an incubation time of 10 min, 4 ml of 1 m NaOH were added, andA 320 was measured against H2O. To exclude absorbance caused by the uncatalyzed rearrangement of chorismate, blanks of increasing chorismate concentrations without enzyme were prepared and absorbance was measured. These blank absorbances were subtracted from optical densities measured for enzyme activities. A calibration curve was drawn using different known phenylpyruvate concentrations that were treated the same way as the enzyme reactions. The molar extinction coefficient at 30 °C was determined as 13095 m−1cm−1. The collected data were transformed to international units (μmol/min) per mg of enzyme. The maximum velocity V max, the Hill-coefficient n H, and the substrate concentration at half maximal velocity [S]0.5 orK m were determined using a computer program which was applying the Quasi-Newton method (Davidon-Fletcher-Powell algorithm) to fit optimal curves to the data (20Fletcher R. Powell M.J.D. Computer Journal. 1963; 6: 163-168Crossref Google Scholar). To draw substrate saturation curves, the data were fitted either to the Michaelis-Menten equation (v = V max [S] (K m + [S])−1) or to the Hill equation (v = V max[S]n ([S]n + S′)−1), where S′(1/n) = S0.5. Eadie-Hofstee plots (v[S]−1 versus v) were drawn to decide to which equation a set of kinetic data had to be applied. Enzyme kinetics without cooperativity result in a linear curve, whereas even small degrees of cooperativity result in concave curvatures of the kinetic data (20Fletcher R. Powell M.J.D. Computer Journal. 1963; 6: 163-168Crossref Google Scholar). Hill plots (log(v(V max − v)−1) versus log [S]) were used to calculate Hill coefficients. The resultingV max values were transformed to catalytic constants (k cat = V max M r E 0−1 (60 s)−1; substrate turnover per enzyme dimer). The numerical values turned out to be identical due to the use of 60,000 as molecular weight for chorismate mutase. The binding of tyrosine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan to chorismate mutase was assayed with an equilibrium dialysis apparatus with 200 μl of half cell volumes and Spectra/Por membrane discs with a molecular cut-off of 12,000–14,000 Da (Spectrum, Houston, Texas). Protein samples were dialyzed overnight in 20 mm Tris-HCl to remove glycerol and adjusted to a concentration of 25 μm in a final volume of 100 μl. Ligand concentrations were 100 μm for tyrosine, 50 μm for tryptophan, and 100–400 μm for phenylalanine with a concentration of approximately 100,000 cpm/100 μl of l-[U-14C]tyrosine,l-[side chain-3-14C]tryptophan, andl-[U-14C]phenylalanine. The specific molar activity of ligand solution was calculated from its concentration corrected to the added 14C-labeled compound and from its activity determined by counting unequilibrated samples. 100 μl of protein and ligand solution were allowed to equilibrate for 3 h at 30 °C. Samples from each compartment were subjected to scintillation counting, and the final protein concentrations of the protein-containing half-cell were determined. No membrane leakage for the protein was observed. Additionally, control experiments without protein were performed, in which equilibria generally were achieved after 3 h. Free ligand concentrations were determined from the activity in the enzyme-free compartment, bound ligand concentrations from the activity difference between the two compartments. All data obtained were standardized to the G141S mutant enzyme which showed no detectable effector binding activity. Fig. 2 A shows typical substrate saturation plots of the wild-type chorismate mutase. The enzyme shows cooperativity with respect to the substrate. The sigmoidal substrate saturation curve is markedly depressed upon addition of the inhibitor tyrosine and S0.5 is shifted to a higher value (Table I). The enzyme is strongly activated by the addition of tryptophan with a K m of 0.4 mm. The saturation by the substrate is noncooperative, and the enzyme follows hyperbolic substrate kinetics. The principal heterotropic effect of the regulatory amino acids to the catalytic center is a change in substrate affinity since similar values fork cat were determined. We performed equilibrium dialysis experiments choosing effector concentrations of 100 and 50 μm for tyrosine and tryptophan, respectively, in the unequilibrated samples. This corresponds to a ratio of protein to ligand of 1:4 and 1:2, respectively. Assuming two binding sites per enzyme dimer for each effector, we calculated the fractional saturation of each mutant chorismate mutase under these conditions (Fig. 3). Values of 77 and 83% saturation for the binding of tyrosine and tryptophan, respectively, to yeast chorismate mutase were measured.Table IKinetic parameters of wild-type and mutant chorismate mutasesProteinInhibited (100 μmtyrosine)UnligandedActivated(10 μm tryptophan)(100 μm phenylalanine)k catK m, S0.5n Hk catK m, S0.5n Hk catK m, S0.5n Hk catK m, S0.5n Hs−1mms−1mms−1mms−1mmWild-type38711.8aValues had uncertainty intervals of more than 10% according to the fitting procedure.1.43603.81.63480.41.0bHyperbolic saturation was indicated by linearity of the Eadie-Hofstee plots.3202.31.6R75A—cDash indicates the flatness of the substrate saturation curves did not allow any reliable calculation of the data.—————3444.21.7———R76A3876.2aValues had uncertainty intervals of more than 10% according to the fitting procedure.1.64869.3aValues had uncertainty intervals of more than 10% according to the fitting procedure.1.351210.0aValues had uncertainty intervals of more than 10% according to the fitting procedure.1.365314.8aValues had uncertainty intervals of more than 10% according to the fitting procedure.1.2G141S2282.01.1bHyperbolic saturation was indicated by linearity of the Eadie-Hofstee plots.2071.71.3bHyperbolic saturation was indicated by linearity of the Eadie-Hofstee plots.2402.51.1bHyperbolic saturation was indicated by linearity of the Eadie-Hofstee plots.2342.11.2bHyperbolic saturation was indicated by linearity of the Eadie-Hofstee plots.S142A2915.61.63234.01.53132.91.83444.61.4T145V3185.31.84024.81.63870.61.23191.51.7Values for k cat, K m, S0.5were determined by fitting initial velocity data to equations describing hyperbolic or cooperative saturation, respectively.

Open table in a new tab Figure 3Effector binding of wild-type and mutant chorismate mutases. Binding of tryptophan and tyrosine at fixed free ligand concentrations was determined by equilibrium dialysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” One hundred percent saturation corresponds to two ligand molecules bound per enzyme dimer, whereas zero percent saturation corresponds to the data obtained for the G141S mutant enzyme. Each experiment was performed at least three times. The standard deviation did not exceed 25% except for the R75A and the R76A mutant enzymes for which values were close to the detection limit.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Values for k cat, K m, S0.5were determined by fitting initial velocity data to equations describing hyperbolic or cooperative saturation, respectively. Hill coefficients (n H) were calculated from Hill plots by linear regression. Phenylalanine was also tested for an effect on chorismate mutase activity and activated the enzyme in vitro as indicated by a reduction of the S0.5 value. Binding of phenylalanine to the enzyme at concentrations as high as 400 μm could not be detected, presumably because it is too weak to be detected by the binding assay. Hence the tyrosine hydroxyl group, which lacks the phenylalanine molecule is important for strong binding as well as inhibition of yeast chorismate mutase. X-ray data suggested that two tyrosine or two tryptophan molecules bind at the same sites at the interface of the dimeric yeast chorismate mutase. A schematical drawing of the computer graphics model derived from the crystals is shown in Fig. 1 B (9Xue Y. Lipscomb W.N. Graf R. Schnappauf G. Braus G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10814-10818Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 11Sträter N. Hakansson K. Schnappauf G. Braus G. Lipscomb W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3330-3334Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). According to this model tyrosine and tryptophan are similarly orientated at the interface of the enzyme. The carboxylate groups of both amino acid effectors interact with the backbone of the enzyme at Gly-141 and Ser-142. The amino groups bind to Ser-142. The side chain of Arg-75 interacts with the carboxylate group of tyrosine but not with tryptophan. The side chain of tyrosine interacts with both subunits by hydrogen bonding to Arg-76 and Thr-145. We mutated these putative effector binding sites by site-directed mutagenesis of the ARO7 gene. All mutant aro7alleles complemented the tyrosine and phenylalanine auxotrophy of anaro7 minus strain. The mutant enzymes, which were named R75A, R76A, G141S, S142A, and T145V according to their replacements, were purified to homogeneity. We investigated the effects of the amino acid replacements on regulation of the enzymes and on binding of tyrosine and tryptophan, respectively. The curves for the substrate saturation experiments are shown in Fig. 2. The numerical values fork cat, K m or S0.5and n H are given in Table I. X-ray data suggested that the carboxylate groups of both effectors, tyrosine and tryptophan, are located in the co-crystals close to Gly-141 of helix 8 and interact with the main chain NH group of Gly-141. If Gly-141 is part of the allosteric site, computer graphics modeling suggested that a serine at position Gly-141 should prevent binding of both amino acid effectors. Correspondingly, we found that all characteristic homotropic and heterotropic effects exhibited by the wild-type chorismate mutase were eliminated when Gly-141 is substituted by serine (Fig. 2 B). The enzyme is unresponsive to tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine and has characteristics of a Michaelis-Menten enzyme. TheK m value is reduced compared with the unliganded wild-type chorismate mutase. Amino acid binding experiments indicated that the enzyme is unable to bind any of the effectors (Fig. 3). These results suggest that the enzyme is not subject to heterotropic effects, because the amino acid effectors are unable to bind to the enzyme and demonstrate that the position of tyrosine and tryptophan in the co-crystals corresponds to the allosteric site of yeast chorismate mutase. Tyrosine and tryptophan share a common site for their allosteric binding at the interface of the dimeric yeast chorismate mutase, where they act as inhibitor and activator, respectively. The x-ray structure suggests that the carboxylate groups of both effectors, tyrosine and tryptophan, are bonded to the backbone NH group of Ser-142. Furthermore, the side chain hydroxyl group of Ser-142 seems to be hydrogen bonded to the amino groups of both effectors. Replacement of Ser-142 with an alanine should remove the interactions of the serine side chain with the regulatory amino acids. The substrate saturation curves are given in Fig. 2 C. The enzyme shows heterotropic response toward tyrosine and tryptophan, but the changes in substrate affinity upon the addition of tyrosine and tryptophan are not as pronounced as those for wild-type chorismate mutase (Table I). This is due to a reduced binding for both effectors, tyrosine and tryptophan (Fig. 3). Interaction with the serine hydroxyl group is therefore equally important for binding of the inhibitor as well as the activator to yeast chorismate mutase. It is not essential for the mechanistic process of action of both amino acid effectors on enzyme activity. The curve for the enzyme in the presence of phenylalanine shows no significant difference to unliganded chorismate mutase. In the x-ray structures, Thr-145 of helix 8 is hydrogen bonded to the phenolic hydroxyl-group of the inhibitor tyrosine, yet it does not interact with the bound tryptophan. We replaced Thr-145 by a valine to prevent interaction with tyrosine. A valine at this position should make the allosteric binding pocket more hydrophobic, and might even allow enhanced binding of phenylalanine in a conformation that is used by tyrosine in the wild-type enzyme. The capability of this mutant enzyme to respond to tyrosine is reduced to a narrower range of regulation, which is mirrored by a moderate increase of the S0.5 value (Fig. 2 D; Table I). Thr-145 is obviously important for the strong binding of tyrosine to the wild-type enzyme, since T45V shows only approximately 35% of the binding capacity of the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 3). Activation of T145V chorismate mutase by phenylalanine is enhanced compared with the wild-type enzyme. Nevertheless binding of phenylalanine to the enzyme was too weak to be detected with the binding assay. Activation of the T145V mutant enzyme by tryptophan is the same as of the wild-type enzyme and binding of tryptophan is preserved (Fig. 3). These data indicate that Thr-145 is neither involved in tryptophan binding nor involved in the mechanism of activation. Yet, it is important for the binding of tyrosine to the allosteric site and the inhibition of yeast chorismate mutase. Arg-75 and Arg-76 are required for inhibition by tyrosine and activation by tryptophan. Arg-76 is part of helix 5 and Arg-75 is part of the interconnection between helices 4 and 5. These elements were assumed to constitute the second part of the effector binding site opposite to helix 8 of the other monomer. In the x-ray structure of the co-crystals the side chain of Arg-75 interacts with the carboxylate group of tyrosine and Arg-76 is hydrogen-bonded to the hydroxyl group of the inhibitor. Binding of tryptophan does not result in ionic contacts or hydrogen bonding according to the co-crystals. When Arg-75 and Arg-76 are replaced by an alanine, the two enzymes show a dramatically reduced response toward any effector amino acid (Fig. 2,E and F). The R75A mutant enzyme displays only residual activation by tryptophan, although the binding assay shows no tryptophan binding (Fig. 3). The flatness of the curves for R75A chorismate mutase did not allow any reliable calculation of the calalytic parameters, only the kinetic parameters for the tryptophan-activated enzyme could be evaluated. The enzyme still showed homotropic cooperative interactions toward the substrate. Substrate affinity is largely reduced, and even for the tryptophan-activated enzyme it is still lower than for the wild-type enzyme without effectors. The R76A mutant enzyme is totally unresponsive toward tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine. Sigmoidal curvature was determined for all curves. The S0.5 values are increased compared with wild-type chorismate mutase (Table I). No significant binding of the effector amino acids could be detected (Fig. 3). Residues Arg-75 and Arg-76 seem to be required for the binding of both, tyrosine and tryptophan and play an essential role in the allosteric process of regulation of yeast chorismate mutase. Long range effects play an important role in the biological properties of allosterically regulated enzymes. An allosteric domain includes a regulatory site for binding of small effector molecules. The signal “binding of an effector” has to be transduced to the catalytic site and has to change the structure of this site in a manner which is reflected by the change in catalytic parameters. The simple organization of yeast chorismate mutase composed of only two subunits with exclusively helical structural elements and no β-sheet elements, offers an attractive model system for the study of allosteric regulation of proteins. The crystallographic structures of activated and inhibited yeast chorismate mutase offer an ideal guide for the design of site-directed mutagenesis studies on the allosteric control of the enzyme. Crystal structure studies indicated that the two binding sites of the allosteric domain are located at the interface of the dimeric enzyme and that each binding site is defined by specific amino acid residues of both monomers. To corroborate these structural studies on a molecular level, we have replaced five amino acid residues located adjacent to two tyrosine or tryptophan molecules in the corresponding crystal structures. All replacements had an effect on the regulation of yeast chorismate mutase. Replacements of Gly-141, Arg-75, and Arg-76 resulted in unregulated enzymes that are not able to bind any of the amino acid effectors. Replacement of Ser-142 resulted in an enzyme with reduced binding capacity for the effectors. These results lead to the conclusion that regulation of the activity of yeast chorismate mutase by tyrosine and tryptophan, the two allosteric regulators, is achieved by binding to the same sites. In contrast, Thr-145 interacts specifically with the inhibitor tyrosine, and changes in this residue do not affect activation of yeast chorismate mutase by tryptophan. Thr-145 presumably interacts with the phenolic hydroxyl group of tyrosine and contributes to part of the binding of the inhibitor to the allosteric site. We therefore conclude that inhibition of chorismate mutase involves amino acid residues, which are not of functional importance for activation. In the homologous plastidic chorismate mutase from A. thaliana, a valine is located at a position corresponding to Thr-145 in yeast chorismate mutase (7Eberhard J. Raesecke H.-R. Schmid J. Amrhein N. FEBS Lett. 1993; 334: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The plant enzyme is inhibited by tyrosine and by phenylalanine. A T145V replacement in yeast chorismate mutase leads to an enhanced response toward phenylalanine, but the effect is still activation. The residues which are part of the regulatory binding site reside on three different helices, helices 4 and 5 of one monomer and helix 8 of the other monomer. The location of the regulatory binding site at the dimer interface of yeast chorismate and the involvement of functional residues from both subunits indicates that dimer formation is required for effector binding and allosteric regulation. The involvement of the same subunit interfaces in the action of tyrosine and tryptophan is consistent with the proposed mechanism of heterotropic interaction, which implies that tyrosine and tryptophan act in reverse ways by either contracting or opening the helix bundle of the allosteric domain. Tyrosine interacts with all residues described here by hydrogen bonding and inhibits the enzyme by pulling the two subunits together through hydrogen-bonds to each subunit. Therefore the enzyme subunits in the T state structure might be constrained by strong bonds that propagate and change the structure needed for substrate binding at the catalytic site. The tyrosine hydroxyl group is specifically required for inhibition of the chorismate mutase because phenylalanine lacking only this group is not an inhibitor of the enzyme. The hydroxyl group interacts with two amino acid residues located in both monomers. The hydrogen bond to Arg-76 is especially important since disruption of this interaction abolishes tyrosine inhibition. Hydrogen bonding of Thr-145 to the tyrosine hydroxyl group is important for the strong binding of tyrosine to the allosteric site. A T145V mutation which disrupts this interaction still results in the transmission of a reduced signal “binding of tyrosine” to the active site. Interaction of Arg-76 with the tyrosine hydroxyl group presumably triggers this remaining intramolecular signal transduction activity between the allosteric and catalytic site. Activation of yeast chorismate mutase is achieved because tryptophan pushes the two subunits apart by the steric size of its side chain. Arg-75 and Arg-76 do not have polar contacts to the tryptophan molecule in the crystal structure. However, replacements of Arg-75 as well as Arg-76 to alanine resulted in enzymes that are not activated by tryptophan, because these enzymes are unable to bind tryptophan, and demonstrate the importance of helices 4 and 5 in the process of allosteric activation. Comparison of the T and R state crystal structures shows that the side chain of Arg-75 changes conformation resulting in an interaction with the carboxylate group of tyrosine but not with tryptophan. Arg-76 interacts by hydrogen bonding with the phenolic group of tyrosine, but not with tryptophan. In the activated structure Arg-76 is very close to the bound tryptophan, suggesting strong van der Waals interactions between protein and effector, which might trigger activation by tryptophan. If activation is caused by an increase in the distance between residues of both subunits, the distance in wild-type yeast chorismate mutase in the absence of effectors could represent a third structure between that found for the T and R state structures. Tyrosine and tryptophan might directly influence the proportion of the T and R states by the involvment of an “induced fit” promoted by effector binding. Another possibility is the existence a preexisting T-R equilibrium. Tyrosine and tryptophan would simply act by stabilizing either of the two states suitable for binding and therefore shifting the equilibrium. No mutant enzyme of the allosteric site could be found which was still binding tyrosine or tryptophan but no more responding toward the effectors. One might speculate that binding of the effectors to the enzyme might just be appropriate if the enzyme is able to exist in the activated and inhibited structures. Binding of tyrosine or tryptophan would trigger an allosteric transition, which then results in optimal binding of the effectors.

https://openalex.org/W2037301661,"DNA sequences that arrest transcription by either eukaryotic RNA polymerase II or <i>Escherichia coli</i> RNA polymerase have been identified previously. Elongation factors SII and GreB are RNA polymerase-binding proteins that enable readthrough of arrest sites by these enzymes, respectively. This functional similarity has led to general models of elongation applicable to both eukaryotic and prokaryotic enzymes. Here we have transcribed with phage and bacterial RNA polymerases, a human DNA sequence previously defined as an arrest site for RNA polymerase II. The phage and bacterial enzymes both respond efficiently to the arrest signal <i>in vitro</i> at limiting levels of nucleoside triphosphates. The <i>E. coli</i>polymerase remains in a template-engaged complex for many hours, can be isolated, and is potentially active. The enzyme displays a relatively slow first-order loss of elongation competence as it dwells at the arrest site. Bacterial RNA polymerase arrested at the human site is reactivated by GreB in the same way that RNA polymerase II arrested at this site is stimulated by SII. Very efficient readthrough can be achieved by phage, bacterial, and eukaryotic RNA polymerases in the absence of elongation factors if 5-Br-UTP is substituted for UTP. These findings provide additional and direct evidence for functional similarity between prokaryotic and eukaryotic transcription elongation and readthrough mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1966354131,"HML/SE is a cytokine-dependent cell line established from childhood acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor or stem cell factor (SCF) alone could stimulate proliferation of HML/SE cells, however interleukin-3, interleukin-6, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and thrombopoietin could not. Although erythropoietin (EPO) alone stimulated neither proliferation nor differentiation of HML/SE cells, it did stimulate proliferation of HML/SE cells and production of hemoglobin in the presence of SCF. SCF activated the human EPO receptor promoter and induced EPO receptor gene expression. Given these results, we speculate that HML/SE cells acquired responsiveness to EPO via the EPO receptor induced by SCF. Mutation analysis of putative transcription factor binding sites in the human EPO receptor promoter suggested that Sp1, rather than the GATA-1 binding site, contributed to the induction of the hEPOR gene. Although it is well documented that hematopoietic stem cells and primitive progenitors require both an early-acting cytokine and a lineage-specific cytokine to differentiate to a certain lineage, related mechanisms are not well understood.

HML/SE may serve as an excellent model system to analyze functions of early-acting cytokine SCF and lineage-specific cytokine EPO related to proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells. Proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells are modulated by cytokines such as interleukin-3 (IL-3), 1The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; EPO, erythropoietin; EPOR, EPO receptor; h, human; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; mAb, monoclonal antibody; G3PDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; SCF, stem cell factor; TPO, thrombopoietin; GM-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; G-CSF, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor; CFU-E, colony-forming unit erythroid; BFU-E, burst-forming unit erythroid. granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), stem cell factor (SCF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), erythropoietin (EPO) (1Metcalf D.

Blood. 1995; 86: 419-431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hematopoietic cytokines can be classified into lineage-nonspecific early-acting cytokines and lineage-specific late-acting cytokines by biological activities and target cells (1Metcalf D. Blood. 1993; 82: 3515-3523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cytokines such as SCF, IL-3, and GM-CSF belong to the former group and EPO, G-CSF, and TPO belong to the latter group. Several studies indicated that hematopoietic stem cells required both groups of these cytokines to differentiate and maturate to the certain lineages in vitro. Early-acting cytokines can effectively interact with late-acting cytokines in the production of more mature cells (4Sonoda Y. Yang Y.C. Wong G.G. Clark S.C. Ogawa M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.A. 1988; 85: 4360-4364Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In both humans and mice, hematopoietic progenitors lose their responsiveness to IL-3 as they differentiate (4Sonoda Y. Yang Y.C.

In erythropoiesis, erythroid progenitors lose their responsiveness to SCF and acquire responsiveness to EPO during differentiation (6Sawada K. Krantz S.B. Dai C.H. Koury S.T. Horn S.T. Glick A.D.

Haematol. 1995; 91: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The expression patterns of cytokine receptors throughout hematopoiesis are not abundantly documented. The down-regulation of early-acting cytokine receptors and up-regulation of lineage-specific late-acting cytokine receptors may possibly occur as hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells differentiate. Attempts to clarify the mechanism of these processes are hindered as the numbers of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells in various sources such as peripheral blood, bone marrow and cord blood are limited. Although several human cell lines had been established, one that requires both early-acting and lineage-specific late-acting cytokines and is suitable to elucidate these problems has apparently not been documented. Here, we demonstrate that the early-acting cytokine SCF induces the receptor gene of the lineage-specific cytokine EPO and consequent acquisition of responsiveness to EPO. We used a human hematopoietic stem cell-like line, HML/SE, established from childhood acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. Recombinant human (h) EPO, hGM-CSF, hIL-3, and hTPO were provided by Kirin Brewery (Tokyo, Japan), recombinant hSCF and hG-CSF were from Amgen Inc. (Thousand Oaks, CA), and recombinant hIL-6 was from Tosoh Co. (Kanagawa, Japan). Mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for hCD2, hCD3, hCD4, hCD13, hCD14, hCD19, hCD33, hCD34, hCD38, and hCD45RO conjugated with phycoerythrin and anti-hCD8 and hCD45RA mAbs conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate were from Becton Dickinson (San Jose, CA). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-hCD41b and HLA-DR mAbs were from Nichirei, (Tokyo, Japan). Anti-hCD117 mAb conjugated with phycoerythrin was from Immunotech (Marseille, France). Purified mAbs for hCD130 and h-glycophorin A were from PharMingen (San Diego, CA) and Immunotech, respectively. The preparation of anti-hCD126 mAb has been described elsewhere (8Tajima S. Tsuji K. Ebihara Y. Sui X. Tanaka R. Muraoka K. Yoshida M. Yamada K. Yasukawa K. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Nakahata T. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1357-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Anti-h-hemoglobin α mAb for immunohistochemical staining was from Cosmo Bio (Tokyo, Japan). HML was originally established from mononuclear cells in peripheral blood obtained from a patient with childhood acute megakaryoblastic leukemia and 21-trisomy (9Ma F. Koike K. Higuchi T.

Haematol. 1998; 100: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). HML/SE is one of the subclones of HML. The cells were cloned as follows; cells were cultured in semisolid culture containing 100 units/ml hIL-3, 10 ng/ml hGM-CSF, and 2 units/ml hEPO. On day 14, individual colonies were transferred to liquid cultures in the α-medium (Flow Laboratories, Rockville, MD) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma), with hIL-3, hGM-CSF, and hEPO at the same concentration as semisolid cultures. After 1 month, the clones were expanded in the presence of 10 ng/ml hGM-CSF alone. Here, we used one of these subclones of HML, designated HML/SE, which was maintained stably in the presence of hGM-CSF for over 1 year. HML/SE cells were maintained in suspension in α-medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.05 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10 ng/ml hGM-CSF. Passages were performed approximately every 3–4 days, diluting the cells four or five times. Every 10 days, dead cells were removed by Ficoll-Hypaque (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) centrifugation. Cell proliferation was estimated by a colorimetric assay using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (Sigma) as described (10Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46884) Google Scholar, 11Watanabe S. Kondo M. Takatsu K. Sugamura K. Arai K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 126-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). For long term growth assay, the number of live cells were counted by trypan blue dye exclusion test. Flow cytometric analysis was done as described (11Watanabe S. Kondo M. Takatsu K. Sugamura K. Arai K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 126-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Immunostaining with the alkaline phosphatase/anti-alkaline phosphatase method, using anti-h-hemoglobin α mAb was done as described (12Okumura N. Tsuji K. Nakahata T. Blood. 1992; 80: 642-650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Sui X. Tsuji K. Tajima S. Tanaka R. Muraoka K. Ebihara Y. Ikebuchi K. Yasukawa K. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Nakahata T. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 837-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Messenger RNAs (mRNAs) were isolated from HML/SE cells cultured under various conditions using a QuickPrep Micro mRNA purification kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The same amount (1 μg) of each mRNA was electrophoresed on agarose formaldehyde gels and transferred to nylon membranes (Boehringer Mannheim). Hybridizations were done in Quick Hyb solution (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using cDNA fragment of hβ-globin, hEPO receptor (generous gift from Dr. H. Nakauchi, University of Tsukuba, Japan), hGATA-1 and -2 (generous gifts from Dr. M. Yamamoto, University of Tsukuba, Japan), or G3PDH (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) as probes. The probe for hβ-globin was cloned by RT-PCR (31–471) from normal human erythroid cells, and the sequence was verified using an ABI PRISM 310 genetic analyzer (Perkin-Elmer, Foster City, CA). The membranes were visualized using a BAS2000 image analyzer (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). Human EPO receptor (hEPOR) 5′ flanking sequence (−197 to −1) containing both GATA and Sp1 binding sites was cloned by PCR from human genomic DNA (14Noguchi C.T. Bae K.S. Chin K. Wada Y. Schechter A.N. Hankins W.D. Blood. 1991; 78: 2548-2556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Chin K. Oda N. Shen K. Noguchi C.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3041-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The PCR products were subcloned into pCR2.1 TA-cloning vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), and the sequence was verified. The plasmid for the luciferase assay, pEPOR-W, was constructed using XhoI and HindIII restriction enzyme sites within both pCR2.1 and pGL3-Basic luciferase vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Mutants of pEPOR-W containing a mutation of the GATA site (pEPOR-ΔG), the Sp1 binding site (pEPOR-ΔS), and mutations of both GATA and Sp1 sites (pEPOR-ΔGΔS) were constructed by PCR mutagenesis using pEPOR-W in which AGATAA was replaced with AGTTAA (for GATA mutation) and GGGCGG with GGGAAA (for Sp1 mutation), respectively (16Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar, 17Zon L.I. Youssoufian H. Mather C. Lodish H.F. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10638-10641Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). HML/SE cells (3 × 106) were transfected by electroporation with 15 μg of either pGL3-Basic as a control or pEPOR-W, -ΔG, -ΔS, or -ΔGΔS, as described (18Watanabe S. Ishida S. Koike K. Arai K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 627-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) but with minor modifications. Briefly, cells were electroshocked using 975 microfarads at 200 V by a Gene Pulser electroporation apparatus (Bio-Rad), divided into two aliquots, and cultured with 10 ng/ml hGM-CSF and 100 ng/ml hSCF, respectively. For luminescence assay, the substrate was automatically injected into the sample in the luminometer (TD-20/20, Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA). Luciferase activities were normalized by protein concentration, which was estimated using the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). We first examined by flow cytometric analysis the phenotype of HML/SE cells maintained in the presence of hGM-CSF (Table I). Most HML/SE cells highly expressed myeloid markers such as CD13 and a megakaryocyte-specific antigen CD41b, often the basis of a diagnosis of acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. They also weakly expressed an erythroid-specific marker, glycophorin A, on their surface. These results are taken to mean that HML/SE is a multi-potent cell line that has the potential to differentiate toward three lineages: myeloid, erythroid, and megakaryocytic.Table IExpression of surface antigen on HML/SE cellsCD2CD3CD4CD8CD13CD14CD19CD33CD34CD38−−+++−++++++−+++−−CD41bCD45RACD45ROCD117CD126CD130HLA-DRGlycophorin A+++++++++−++++++ Open table in a new tab We next analyzed proliferation of HML/SE cells in the presence of various cytokines. Cells maintained in the presence of hGM-CSF were washed three times with factor-free α-medium, and started to culture at a density of 1 × 104/ml in the presence of indicated cytokines. Examination of viable cells was made by trypan blue dye exclusion test every 24 h. As shown in Fig. 1 A, HML/SE cells proliferated in the presence of hGM-CSF and hSCF alone stimulated proliferation, albeit to a lesser extent than seen with hGM-CSF. When these cytokines were removed from the culture, all the HML/SE cells died within 72 h. Neither hEPO nor hIL-6 alone stimulated proliferation of HML/SE within 72 h. Proliferation of HML/SE in the presence of hIL-3, hG-CSF, and hTPO was not observed within 72 h (data not shown). When we continued to examine proliferation of HML/SE cells until day 10 (Fig. 1B), the cells continued to proliferate in the presence of either hGM-CSF or hSCF, but not in the presence of hIL-6, hEPO, hG-CSF, and hTPO (data not shown). It is well documented that hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells require stimulation of the combination of two or more cytokines to proliferate and differentiate. We next investigated the synergistic action of early-acting cytokines SCF and GM-CSF, which can stimulate proliferation of this cell line alone, and lineage-specific cytokines EPO, G-CSF, and TPO on proliferation of HML/SE cells. The cells maintained in the presence of hGM-CSF were washed three times with factor-free α-medium, and started to culture at a density of 1 × 104/ml in the presence of 10 ng/ml hGM-CSF or 100 ng/ml hSCF, with or without 2 units/ml hEPO. The culture was continued to day 10, as described under “Materials and Methods.” In combination with hEPO and hGM-CSF, the cell number increased at almost the same rate as seen in the presence of hGM-CSF alone (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, in combination with hEPO and hSCF, the cell number increased more rapidly than in the presence of SCF alone (Fig. 2 A). We further analyzed effects of various concentrations of hEPO on HML/SE cells, using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Addition of either hGM-CSF or hSCF alone stimulated proliferation of HML/SE, in a dose-dependent manner, but hEPO alone failed to do so, at any concentration used (Fig. 2 B). When SCF was present in the medium, EPO stimulated proliferation of HML/SE cells, in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2 C). We also examined the proliferation response of HML/SE cells in combination with hGM-CSF or hSCF and either one of hG-CSF or hTPO. No additional effect of hG-CSF and hTPO was observed in the presence of hGM-CSF or hSCF (data not shown). Because a synergistic action between SCF and EPO on proliferation of HML/SE cells occurred, we further examined synergistic actions of early-acting cytokines and lineage-specific cytokines on differentiation of HML/SE cells. In combination with hGM-CSF and hEPO, expression of an erythroid-specific surface antigen glycophorin A did not increase (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, with 10 days of culture in combination with hSCF and hEPO, more than 50% of HML/SE cells markedly expressed glycophorin A on their surface (Fig. 3 A), and β-globin mRNA markedly increased in comparison with hGM-CSF plus hEPO or hSCF alone (Fig. 3 B). As induction of β-globin mRNA was detected in case of a combination of hSCF and hEPO, we examined the production of hemoglobin, at the protein level. Hemoglobin production was evident in cells cultured with hSCF plus hEPO, as determined immunohistochemically (Fig. 3 C, d), but was not detectable in cells cultured with hGM-CSF (Fig. 3 C, b), hGM-CSF plus hEPO, or hSCF alone (data not shown). In addition, the cells had erythroid features such as condensed nucleus and a basophilic cytoplasm (Fig. 3 C, b) compared with cells maintained in the presence of hGM-CSF (Fig. 3 C, a) and the cell pellet was reddish (data not shown), suggesting that EPO signaling led to erythroid differentiation in the presence of SCF. When HML/SE cells were maintained in the presence of hGM-CSF, almost all highly expressed CD13, a myeloid-specific surface antigen. We then asked if G-CSF would induce HML/SE cells to a more mature stage of myeloid differentiation. However, more mature myeloids were not observed in the presence of hG-CSF, with either hGM-CSF or hSCF, as determined by histochemical staining (data not shown). As most HML/SE cells also expressed CD41b, a megakaryocytic lineage-specific marker on their surface, it seemed important to determine if HML/SE cells would differentiate to more mature megakaryocytic cells by TPO. However, hTPO alone stimulated neither proliferation nor differentiation of HML/SE (data not shown). In combination with hTPO and either hSCF or hGM-CSF, the intensity of expression of CD41b was almost the same as that in the presence of hSCF or hGM-CSF alone, and morphological changes were not observed with histochemical staining (data not shown), even in the presence of human platelet poor plasma instead of fetal bovine serum and/or low concentration of oxygen (5%). In the presence of SCF, HML/SE cells seemed to acquire responsiveness to EPO; therefore, we investigated whether the expression of the EPOR had been changed by SCF. In general, it is difficult to detect EPOR protein due to the low expression of endogenous EPOR on the cell surface. We then examined changes of hEPOR mRNA expression. The mRNA expression of hEPOR was analyzed by Northern blotting using 1 μg of purified mRNAs extracted from HML/SE cells cultured for 10 days in the presence of hGM-CSF, hSCF, hSCF plus hEPO, and hGM-CSF plus hEPO, respectively. When HML/SE cells were maintained in the presence of hGM-CSF alone, the expression of hEPOR mRNA was hardly detectable (Fig. 4 A). With addition of hEPO, the amount of hEPOR mRNA did not increase (Fig. 4 A). In the presence of hSCF alone, the expression of hEPOR mRNA increased (Fig. 4 A), and in combination with hEPO, the hEPOR mRNA level was dramatically increased (Fig. 4 A). As it appeared that SCF transcriptionally activated the EPOR gene, we examined the time course of hEPOR mRNA changes; hEPOR mRNA in HML/SE cells increased time-dependently in the presence of hSCF (Fig. 4 B). As described above, SCF induced EPOR mRNA. To clarify the mechanism of EPOR gene induction by SCF, we investigated whether SCF activated the EPOR promoter by transient system. We cloned hEPOR promoter region containing both GATA and Sp1 binding sites from human genomic DNA, and the cloned fragment was fused with luciferase coding region as described under “Materials and Methods.” HML/SE cells (3 × 106) were transfected with 15 μg of either pGL3-Basic or pEPOR-W, divided into two aliquots and cultured with 10 ng/ml hGM-CSF and 100 ng/ml hSCF, respectively. After 72 h, the cells were lysed and luminescence was measured. GM-CSF did not activate the hEPOR promoter; however, SCF did activate it 10-fold more compared with the sample transfected with the luciferase vector lacking the hEPOR promoter (Fig. 5 A). Because the EPOR promoter we used contains putative GATA and Sp1 binding sites, we next investigated whether these sites contributed to the activation of the hEPOR promoter by SCF using pEPOR-W mutants lacking the GATA and/or Sp1 binding site. Luciferase activity of the hEPOR promoter containing a mutation of the GATA binding site (pEPOR-ΔG) induced by SCF was higher than that observed with the intact promoter. On the other hand, when the cells were transfected with pEPOR-ΔS, containing a mutation of the Sp1 binding site, luciferase activity was dramatically reduced. As expected, only background luciferase activity was observed with pEPOR-ΔGΔS (both GATA and Sp1 mutated) (Fig. 5 A). We also examined both GATA-1 and GATA-2 mRNA expression levels of the HML/SE cultured in the presence of either GM-CSF or SCF by Northern blotting analysis. As shown in Fig. 5 B, neither the level of GATA-1 nor GATA-2 was changed by the addition of SCF. These results support the idea that Sp1 rather than GATA plays a role in the induction of the hEPOR promoter by SCF. We obtained evidence of induction of the receptor gene of the lineage-specific cytokine EPO by the early-acting cytokine SCF and the consequent acquisition of responsiveness to EPO in HML/SE, a human leukemic cell line. Modulation of the process of hematopoietic differentiation by a series of early-acting hematopoietic cytokines, including SCF, IL-3, GM-CSF, and lineage-specific hematopoietic cytokines such as EPO, G-CSF, and TPO has been proposed (2Ogawa M. Blood. 1993; 81: 2844-2853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Multi-potent progenitor cells must interact with an appropriate combination of both groups of these hematopoietic cytokines in order to proliferate and to progress to the next stage of differentiation. In erythropoiesis, both the early-acting cytokines and the lineage-specific cytokine EPO are required (19Migliaccio A.R. Vannucchi A.M. Migliaccio G. Int. J. Hematol. 1996; 64: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The importance of SCF in erythroid cell development is demonstrated by the severe macrocytic anemia in Sl/Sl and W/W mice, which are mutated at the loci encoding SCF and its receptor c-Kit, respectively (20Russel E.S. Adv. Genet. 1979; 20: 357-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). Reduced levels of CFU-E in these mice (21Nocka K. Majumder S. Chabot B. Ray P. Cervone M. Bernstein A. Besmer P. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 816-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) means that generation of CFU-E from pluri-potent stem cell is largely dependent on SCF. Studies on knock-out of EPO or EPOR showed that generation of committed erythroid BFU-E and CFU-E progenitors did not require EPO or EPOR (22Wu H. Liu X. Jaenisch R. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1995; 83: 59-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). It was also reported that most purified BFU-E were insensitive to EPO and had a very low number of EPOR on their surface, but the number of EPOR did increase and acquired responsiveness to EPO when differentiated to CFU-E (6Sawada K. Krantz S.B. Dai C.H. Koury S.T. Horn S.T. Glick A.D. Civin C.I. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 142: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). EPO alone could stimulate neither proliferation nor differentiation to erythroid, and both SCF and EPO were indispensable for erythroid proliferation and differentiation of HML/SE cells. These results suggest that HML/SE cells consist of very early stage progenitors that have not acquired responsiveness to EPO as the number of EPOR is scanty. Other cell lines reported to proliferate and differentiate to erythroid in the presence of EPO alone such as F36, UT-7, MTAT, and TF-1, seem to have already expressed EPOR and consequently acquired responsiveness to EPO (23Chiba S. Takaku F. Tange T. Shibuya K. Misawa C. Sasaki K. Miyagawa K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Blood. 1991; 78: 2261-2268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Komatsu N. Nakauchi H. Miwa A. Ishihara T. Eguchi M. Moroi M. Okada M. Sato Y. Wada H. Yawata Y. Suda T. Miura Y. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 341-348PubMed Google Scholar, 25Minegishi N. Minegishi M. Tsuchiya S. Fujie H. Nagai T. Hayashi N. Yamamoto M.

Takaku F J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 140: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Thus, HML/SE cells seem to have a unique feature corresponding to normal progenitors that are more immature than CFU-E. It may be that early-acting cytokines SCF up-regulate EPOR of BFU-E level progenitors and consequently give rise to CFU-E with acquired responsiveness to EPO. Lack of this mechanism may result in reduced levels of CFU-E in Sl/Sl and W/W mice. The physical interaction between c-Kit and EPOR has been reported (27Wu H. Klingmuller U. Besmer P. Lodish H.F. Nature. 1995; 377: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The binding of SCF to its receptor c-Kit may cause trans-phosphorylation of EPOR and result in transduction of differentiation signal. We propose another mechanism to explain the co-operation between SCF and EPO. Because EPOR mRNA was much more increased by SCF plus EPO than by SCF alone, EPO signaling seems to lead to further erythroid differentiation by positive feedback regulation. It was reported that the EPOR gene was trans-activated by transcription factor GATA-1 (15Chin K. Oda N. Shen K. Noguchi C.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3041-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar,17Zon L.I. Youssoufian H. Mather C. Lodish H.F. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3843-3848Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and that GATA-1 expression was stimulated by EPO (28Chiba T. Ikawa Y. Todokoro K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3843-3848Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 29Dalyot N. Fibach E. Ronchi A. Rachmilewitz E.A. Ottolenghi S. Oppenheim A.

Biochem. 1995; 230: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). GATA-1 has been also reported to trans-activate other erythroid-specific genes such as globin and GATA-1 itself (31Weiss M.J. Orkin S.H. Exp. Hematol. 1995; 23: 99-107PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of SCF and EPO, as well as EPO in normal erythroid, erythroid-specific genes such as globin and EPOR were induced in HML/SE cells. In contrast, in the presence of SCF alone, only induction of the EPOR gene was observed. We found that SCF activated the hEPOR promoter, determined using a luciferase vector inserted the hEPOR promoter containing the GATA binding site. However, activation of the hEPOR promoter by SCF was not affected by a GATA binding site mutation and SCF did not increase mRNA expression levels of either GATA-1 or GATA-2, which is assumed to be involved in the induction of EPOR mRNA (32Weiss M.J. Keller G. Orkin S.H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1184-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that neither GATA-1 nor GATA-2 participate in the induction of the hEPOR gene by SCF. Abrogation of hEPOR promoter activation by SCF through a mutation of the Sp1 binding site suggests a role for Sp1 in hEPOR promoter activation by SCF. Because other erythroid-related genes are reported to be regulated by GATA-1, it can be speculated that specific induction of the EPOR gene by SCF is achieved by Sp1. We thank I.

https://openalex.org/W1986353200,"Activating transcription factor 1 (ATF1) and cAMP-responsive element (CRE)-binding protein (CREB) activate transcription through CREs located in the promoters of cellular and viral genes. We previously described a monoclonal antibody (mAb41.4) that prevents ATF1 binding to DNA and reduces CRE-driven promoter activity in vitro (Orten, D. J., Strawhecker, J. M., Sanderson, S. D., Huang, D., Prytowsky, M. B., and Hinrichs, S. H. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 32254–32263). A single chain Fv (scFv) fragment from the mAb41.4-expressing hybridoma was generated to provide a means to investigate transcription factor function via intracellular expression of the scFv fragment. The affinity of scFv4 (subgroup: VLκ-III, VH miscellaneous) for ATF1 was similar to that of the parental mAb and the Fab fragment, but it demonstrated greater inhibitory activity and reacted with CREB. scFv4 disrupted the binding of both ATF1 and CREB in electrophoretic mobility shift assays and reduced expression of CRE-driven expression in vitro. Transient expression of scFv had no effect on the non-CRE-containing adenovirus major late promoter. The proliferating cell nuclear antigen promoter, containing two CREs, was significantly more sensitive to inhibition by scFv than the cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter, containing five CREs. Cotransfection of either ATF1 or CREB in the presence of scFv restored basal levels of expression. The intracellular expression of scFv provides a unique means to investigate the roles of the transcription factors ATF1 and CREB.

Members of the CREB/ATF family bind to cAMP-responsive elements (CREs) within the promoter and enhancer sequences of many genes. ATF1, CREB, and the cAMP-responsive element modulator protein (CREM) constitute the CREB/ATF subfamily within the bZIP superfamily, which is defined by their ability to heterodimerize with each other but not with members of other subfamilies (1Meyer T.E. Habener J.F. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 269-290PubMed Google Scholar). ATF1, CREB, and CREM have similar structure and are highly homologous at the amino acid sequence level, especially within the bZIP region. Despite these similarities, members of the CREB multigene subfamily have distinct biological activity.ATF1, CREB, and CREM may act as either positive or negative regulators of transcription. Through alternative mRNA splicing, numerous isoforms of ATF1, CREB, and CREM can be expressed that possess differing transcriptional regulatory activities (2Lee K.A. Masson N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1174: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 3Lemaigre F.P. Ace C.I. Green M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2907-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Each protein or isoform also possesses differing patterns of phosphorylation, and the specific patterns contribute to their activity as regulators of transcription (1Meyer T.E. Habener J.F. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 269-290PubMed Google Scholar). CREB and CREM have been shown to play pivotal roles in basal and hormone-regulated transcription and differentiation; the role of ATF1 is less well defined. ATF1 homodimers appear to be weaker transcriptional activators than either CREB or certain forms of CREM since ATF1-mediated activation is enhanced by heterodimerization with either CREB or CREM (2Lee K.A. Masson N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1174: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The overexpression of ATF1 has recently been correlated with the neoplastic phenotype of lymphoma (4Hsueh Y.-P. Lai M.-Z. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5675-5683PubMed Google Scholar) and the continuous proliferation of lymphocytes. Cell cycle progression in T cells stimulated by interleukin-2 has been shown to be regulated by ATF1 and CREB, and transgenic mice expressing a dominant-negative form of CREB are defective in thymocyte proliferation and interleukin-2 production (5Feuerstein N. Huang D. Hinrichs S.H. Orten D.J. Aiyar N. Prystowsky M.B. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 68-79PubMed Google Scholar, 6Barton K. Muthusamy N. Chanyangam M. Fischer C. Clendenin C. Leiden J.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar).To investigate the functional role of ATF1, we previously generated a panel of anti-ATF1 monoclonal antibodies (7Orten D.J.

One antibody (mAb41.4; hereafter mAb4) was found to inhibit the binding of DNA by ATF1 and to inhibit ATF1-induced transcriptional activation (7Orten D.J. Strawhecker J.M. Sanderson S.D. Huang D. Prystowsky M.B. Hinrichs S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32254-32263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fab4, the Fab fragment of mAb4, retained the inhibitory properties of the parental antibody (Ab) (8Gilchrist C.A. Orten D.J. Bosilevac J.M. Sanderson D.S. Hinrichs S.H. Antibodies Immunoconj. Radiopharmacol. 1995; 8: 281-298Google Scholar). To investigate the cellular role of ATF1, we utilized current advances in the engineering of antibodies that have made possible the cloning of small single chain Fv (scFv) fragments. scFv fragments contain the antigen-binding variable domains of the light and heavy chains connected by a peptide spacer (9Raag R. Whitlow M. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 10Davies J. Riechmann L. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 475-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 11Winter G. Milstein C. Nature. 1991; 349: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). When constructed in this manner, a single RNA transcript can be expressed and translated into an active protein that has the potential to interfere with the activity of targeted intracellular proteins. Intracellular scFv fragments have been successfully employed to decrease the expression of ErbB-2 (12Grim J. Deshane J. Feng M. Lieber A. Kay M. Curiel D.T. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol.

We therefore cloned scFv4 of mAb4 and present here its characterization and its functional effect on intracellular gene expression.DISCUSSIONAlthough studied extensively, the cellular roles of ATF1 and CREB have not been fully determined. CREB is an important mediator of cAMP-activated transcription, whereas ATF1 activates transcription in some cell lines (41Rehfuss R.P. Walton K.M. Loriaux M.M. Goodman R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18431-18434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and represses transcription in others (3Lemaigre F.P. Ace C.I. Green M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2907-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To elucidate the roles of transcription factors, investigators have attempted to knock out the activity of the transcription factors. In studies with ATF1 and CREB, activity has been reduced in vitro with an ATF1-sequestering CRE oligonucleotide (42Hai T.W. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Green M.R. Cell. 1988; 54: 1043-1051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) andin vivo through the generation and study of transgenic and mutant mice (6Barton K. Muthusamy N. Chanyangam M. Fischer C. Clendenin C. Leiden J.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 43Hummler E. Cole T.J. Blendy J. Ganss R. Aguzzi A. Schmid W. Beermann F. Shcutz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5647-5651Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 44Bourtchuladze R. Frenguelli B. Blendy J. Cioffi D. Schutz G. Silva A.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 59-68Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar). Other investigators have used intracellularly expressed scFv fragments as modified gene knockout systems (12Grim J. Deshane J. Feng M. Lieber A. Kay M. Curiel D.T. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 15: 348-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 13Graus-Porta D. Beerli R.R. Hynes N.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1182-1191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The recent success in the application of these modified knockout systems led us to evaluate the inhibitory activity of the scFv fragment derived from mAb4.The ATF1 binding activity of mAb4 was maintained by scFv in ELISA (displaying a similar affinity for ATF1). In EMSA, scFv inhibited the formation of ATF1·CRE complexes, as had occurred with the mAb, and also inhibited the formation of CREB·CRE complexes, similar to the effect of the Fab fragment. Previous studies in our laboratory demonstrated that both mAb4 and Fab4 inhibited transcript production from the PCNA promoter (7Orten D.J. Strawhecker J.M. Sanderson S.D. Huang D. Prystowsky M.B. Hinrichs S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32254-32263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Gilchrist C.A. Orten D.J. Bosilevac J.M. Sanderson D.S. Hinrichs S.H. Antibodies Immunoconj. Radiopharmacol. 1995; 8: 281-298Google Scholar). The inhibition of ATF1·CRE and CREB·CRE complexes in EMSA correlated with reduction of expression from the CRE-containing promoters in in vitro transcription assays. The cell transfection experiments confirmed the inhibitory effect of scFv on CRE-containing promoters. Therefore, the EMSA andin vitro transcription studies were predictive of the effect of scFv in cells, but the specific level of inhibition was different in each assay.The mAb interfered solely with ATF1, whereas the Fab fragment possessed additional reactivity for CREB as observed by EMSA and in vitro transcription from the CMV-IE promoter. The scFv fragment maintained reactivity for CREB, but the affinity was lower for CREB than for ATF1. Although the scFv fragment has an apparent lower affinity for CREB than for ATF1, it has greater inhibitory activity than either the Fab fragment or mAb in vitro and maintains this activity in cells. The apparent difference in the relative reactivities of the scFv construct and its parental mAb for the two transcription factors could derive, in principle, from several factors that are still to be determined. First, structural constraints in the antigen-binding site may be imposed by the covalent linkage of the VL and VH domains via the 15-residue linker (Gly4-Ser)3) or by the order of the two domains (the VL C terminus linked to the VH N terminusversus the VH C terminus linked to the VL N terminus as in this study). Although scFv constructs generally retain the activity of the parental antibodies, the length and composition of the linker (35Pantoliano M.W. Bird R.E. Johnson S. Asel E.D. Dodd S.W. Wood J.F. Hardman K. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10117-10125Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 45Owens R.J. Young R.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1993; 168: 149-165Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar), as well as the assembly order of the VL and VH domains, have been reported to influence the antigen binding affinity and avidity in certain cases (36Tsumoto K. Nakaoki Y. Ueda Y. Ogasahara K. Yutani K. Watanabe K. Kumagai I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 546-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 45Owens R.J. Young R.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1993; 168: 149-165Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Second, an increased ability of scFv to diffuse into small spaces, due to the smaller size of the former molecule (27 kDaversus 150 kDa for the mAb), may increase the accessibility of the antigenic epitope within the transcription factor-DNA complex. The tertiary structure of CREB may be such that certain domains are accessible by the small scFv fragment, but not by the large intact antibody. Third, aggregation reactions are known to occur in certain Fv preparations (46Whitow M. Fipula D. Rollence M.L. Feng S.-L. Wood J.F. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 1017-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 47Desplanque D. King D.J. Lawson A.D. Mountain A. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 1027-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), which may alter the avidity of the binding for the two transcription factors. Significant intermolecular noncovalent interactions between the variable domains present in different scFv molecules could potentially occur at the scFv concentrations employed in our experiments (0.3–3 μm), depending on the affinity constant for noncovalent VL·VH complexations. Fourth, the presence of unusual residues in our scFv fragment may indicate that non-somatic mutations are responsible for the additional activity. The scFv fragment is notable for the lack of a CDR3 in its VH domain. The CDR3 deletion in our scFv fragment most likely arose from a somatic event since nucleotide sequencing of multiple isolated clones indicated the occurrence of this deletion, and examination of the sequence data revealed a frameshift occurring at this point in the VH domain. In consideration of the above issues, we propose that scFv binds to ATF1 or CREB and limits transcription factor interaction with the CRE. Interference with the binding of ATF1 or CREB to the CRE is believed to prevent the recruitment of transcriptional machinery and subsequent gene expression. Although the reactivity of scFv for both ATF1 and CREB is a useful property, further affinity maturation toward either transcription factor may allow specific inhibition of biological activity.Multiple approaches were taken to demonstrate that the activity of scFv was specific for the CRE-binding proteins, ATF1 and CREB. The adenovirus major late promoter was chosen because it contains only a TATA box and a pair of MAZ and Sp1 elements (38Song B. Young C.S. Virology. 1997; 235: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 39Parks C.L. Shenk T. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9600-9607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Horwitz M.S. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Fields Virology. 2nd Ed. 2. Raven Press, Philadelphia1996: 1679-1721Google Scholar). No CRE or CRE-like sequences are present in the AdML promoter. Additionally, adding back ATF1 or CREB to the intracellular scFv system reversed the effects of scFv upon the PCNA promoter.In our transfection studies, scFv showed a greater inhibitory effect on the PCNA promoter than the CMV-IE promoter, with 56 and 25% decreases in the promoter activities, respectively. The PCNA construct encompasses −182 to +143 of the promoter and contains single Ap2, Oct, and Sp1 elements as well as a tandem CRE. These two CREs have been shown to contribute the major activity of this promoter and are primarily activated by ATF1 (24Huang D. Shipman A.P. Orten D.J. Hinrichs S.H. Prytowski M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4233-4243Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The CMV promoter we used contained region −760 to +75 of the major IE promoter, and five 19-base pair repeat elements with a CRE at each of their cores are located in this region. In addition to CREs, the CMV-IE promoter contains other binding sites for transcription factors, including NF-κB, Ap1, Sp1, C/EBP, and NF1. The presence of these additional binding sites for other transcriptional activators most likely accounts for the decreased effect of scFv upon the CMV-IE promoter as compared with the PCNA promoter. The relative strengths of ATF1 and CREB as activators of the CRE (48Flint K.J. Jones N.C. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 2019-2026PubMed Google Scholar) and the intracellular ratios of ATF1 to CREB may also contribute to the observed effects. Whether the difference in activation will correlate with a physiologic change in cell viability or activity is yet to be determined. However, due to its ability to interfere with the activity of ATF1 and CREB, the scFv fragment is a useful tool for novel studies of CRE-mediated cellular differentiation, tumorigenesis, and viral pathogenesis.

ATF1, CREB, and the cAMP-responsive element modulator protein (CREM) constitute the CREB/ATF subfamily within the bZIP superfamily, which is defined by their ability to heterodimerize with each other but not with members of other subfamilies (1Meyer T.E. Habener J.F. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 269-290PubMed Google Scholar). ATF1, CREB, and CREM have similar structure and are highly homologous at the amino acid sequence level, especially within the bZIP region. Despite these similarities, members of the CREB multigene subfamily have distinct biological activity. ATF1, CREB, and CREM may act as either positive or negative regulators of transcription. Through alternative mRNA splicing, numerous isoforms of ATF1, CREB, and CREM can be expressed that possess differing transcriptional regulatory activities (2Lee K.A. Masson N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1174: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 3Lemaigre F.P. Ace C.I. Green M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2907-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Each protein or isoform also possesses differing patterns of phosphorylation, and the specific patterns contribute to their activity as regulators of transcription (1Meyer T.E. Habener J.F. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 269-290PubMed Google Scholar). CREB and CREM have been shown to play pivotal roles in basal and hormone-regulated transcription and differentiation; the role of ATF1 is less well defined. ATF1 homodimers appear to be weaker transcriptional activators than either CREB or certain forms of CREM since ATF1-mediated activation is enhanced by heterodimerization with either CREB or CREM (2Lee K.A. Masson N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1174: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The overexpression of ATF1 has recently been correlated with the neoplastic phenotype of lymphoma (4Hsueh Y.-P. Lai M.-Z. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5675-5683PubMed Google Scholar) and the continuous proliferation of lymphocytes. Cell cycle progression in T cells stimulated by interleukin-2 has been shown to be regulated by ATF1 and CREB, and transgenic mice expressing a dominant-negative form of CREB are defective in thymocyte proliferation and interleukin-2 production (5Feuerstein N. Huang D. Hinrichs S.H. Orten D.J. Aiyar N. Prystowsky M.B. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 68-79PubMed Google Scholar, 6Barton K. Muthusamy N. Chanyangam M. Fischer C. Clendenin C. Leiden J.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). To investigate the functional role of ATF1, we previously generated a panel of anti-ATF1 monoclonal antibodies (7Orten D.J.

One antibody (mAb41.4; hereafter mAb4) was found to inhibit the binding of DNA by ATF1 and to inhibit ATF1-induced transcriptional activation (7Orten D.J. Strawhecker J.M. Sanderson S.D. Huang D. Prystowsky M.B. Hinrichs S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32254-32263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fab4, the Fab fragment of mAb4, retained the inhibitory properties of the parental antibody (Ab) (8Gilchrist C.A. Orten D.J. Bosilevac J.M. Sanderson D.S. Hinrichs S.H. Antibodies Immunoconj. Radiopharmacol. 1995; 8: 281-298Google Scholar). To investigate the cellular role of ATF1, we utilized current advances in the engineering of antibodies that have made possible the cloning of small single chain Fv (scFv) fragments. scFv fragments contain the antigen-binding variable domains of the light and heavy chains connected by a peptide spacer (9Raag R. Whitlow M. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 10Davies J. Riechmann L. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 475-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 11Winter G. Milstein C. Nature. 1991; 349: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). When constructed in this manner, a single RNA transcript can be expressed and translated into an active protein that has the potential to interfere with the activity of targeted intracellular proteins. Intracellular scFv fragments have been successfully employed to decrease the expression of ErbB-2 (12Grim J. Deshane J. Feng M. Lieber A. Kay M. Curiel D.T. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 15: 348-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 13Graus-Porta D. Beerli R.R. Hynes N.E. Mol. Cell.

We therefore cloned scFv4 of mAb4 and present here its characterization and its functional effect on intracellular gene expression. DISCUSSIONAlthough studied extensively, the cellular roles of ATF1 and CREB have not been fully determined. CREB is an important mediator of cAMP-activated transcription, whereas ATF1 activates transcription in some cell lines (41Rehfuss R.P. Walton K.M. Loriaux M.M. Goodman R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18431-18434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and represses transcription in others (3Lemaigre F.P. Ace C.I. Green M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2907-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To elucidate the roles of transcription factors, investigators have attempted to knock out the activity of the transcription factors. In studies with ATF1 and CREB, activity has been reduced in vitro with an ATF1-sequestering CRE oligonucleotide (42Hai T.W. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Green M.R. Cell. 1988; 54: 1043-1051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) andin vivo through the generation and study of transgenic and mutant mice (6Barton K. Muthusamy N. Chanyangam M. Fischer C. Clendenin C. Leiden J.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 43Hummler E. Cole T.J. Blendy J. Ganss R. Aguzzi A. Schmid W. Beermann F. Shcutz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5647-5651Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 44Bourtchuladze R. Frenguelli B. Blendy J. Cioffi D. Schutz G. Silva A.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 59-68Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar). Other investigators have used intracellularly expressed scFv fragments as modified gene knockout systems (12Grim J. Deshane J. Feng M. Lieber A. Kay M. Curiel D.T. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 15: 348-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 13Graus-Porta D. Beerli R.R. Hynes N.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1182-1191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The recent success in the application of these modified knockout systems led us to evaluate the inhibitory activity of the scFv fragment derived from mAb4.The ATF1 binding activity of mAb4 was maintained by scFv in ELISA (displaying a similar affinity for ATF1). In EMSA, scFv inhibited the formation of ATF1·CRE complexes, as had occurred with the mAb, and also inhibited the formation of CREB·CRE complexes, similar to the effect of the Fab fragment. Previous studies in our laboratory demonstrated that both mAb4 and Fab4 inhibited transcript production from the PCNA promoter (7Orten D.J. Strawhecker J.M. Sanderson S.D. Huang D. Prystowsky M.B. Hinrichs S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32254-32263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Gilchrist C.A. Orten D.J. Bosilevac J.M. Sanderson D.S. Hinrichs S.H. Antibodies Immunoconj. Radiopharmacol. 1995; 8: 281-298Google Scholar). The inhibition of ATF1·CRE and CREB·CRE complexes in EMSA correlated with reduction of expression from the CRE-containing promoters in in vitro transcription assays. The cell transfection experiments confirmed the inhibitory effect of scFv on CRE-containing promoters. Therefore, the EMSA andin vitro transcription studies were predictive of the effect of scFv in cells, but the specific level of inhibition was different in each assay.The mAb interfered solely with ATF1, whereas the Fab fragment possessed additional reactivity for CREB as observed by EMSA and in vitro transcription from the CMV-IE promoter. The scFv fragment maintained reactivity for CREB, but the affinity was lower for CREB than for ATF1. Although the scFv fragment has an apparent lower affinity for CREB than for ATF1, it has greater inhibitory activity than either the Fab fragment or mAb in vitro and maintains this activity in cells. The apparent difference in the relative reactivities of the scFv construct and its parental mAb for the two transcription factors could derive, in principle, from several factors that are still to be determined. First, structural constraints in the antigen-binding site may be imposed by the covalent linkage of the VL and VH domains via the 15-residue linker (Gly4-Ser)3) or by the order of the two domains (the VL C terminus linked to the VH N terminusversus the VH C terminus linked to the VL N terminus as in this study). Although scFv constructs generally retain the activity of the parental antibodies, the length and composition of the linker (35Pantoliano M.W. Bird R.E. Johnson S. Asel E.D. Dodd S.W. Wood J.F. Hardman K. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10117-10125Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 45Owens R.J. Young R.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1993; 168: 149-165Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar), as well as the assembly order of the VL and VH domains, have been reported to influence the antigen binding affinity and avidity in certain cases (36Tsumoto K. Nakaoki Y. Ueda Y. Ogasahara K. Yutani K. Watanabe K. Kumagai I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 546-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 45Owens R.J. Young R.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1993; 168: 149-165Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Second, an increased ability of scFv to diffuse into small spaces, due to the smaller size of the former molecule (27 kDaversus 150 kDa for the mAb), may increase the accessibility of the antigenic epitope within the transcription factor-DNA complex. The tertiary structure of CREB may be such that certain domains are accessible by the small scFv fragment, but not by the large intact antibody. Third, aggregation reactions are known to occur in certain Fv preparations (46Whitow M. Fipula D. Rollence M.L. Feng S.-L. Wood J.F. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 1017-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 47Desplanque D. King D.J. Lawson A.D. Mountain A. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 1027-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), which may alter the avidity of the binding for the two transcription factors. Significant intermolecular noncovalent interactions between the variable domains present in different scFv molecules could potentially occur at the scFv concentrations employed in our experiments (0.3–3 μm), depending on the affinity constant for noncovalent VL·VH complexations. Fourth, the presence of unusual residues in our scFv fragment may indicate that non-somatic mutations are responsible for the additional activity. The scFv fragment is notable for the lack of a CDR3 in its VH domain. The CDR3 deletion in our scFv fragment most likely arose from a somatic event since nucleotide sequencing of multiple isolated clones indicated the occurrence of this deletion, and examination of the sequence data revealed a frameshift occurring at this point in the VH domain. In consideration of the above issues, we propose that scFv binds to ATF1 or CREB and limits transcription factor interaction with the CRE. Interference with the binding of ATF1 or CREB to the CRE is believed to prevent the recruitment of transcriptional machinery and subsequent gene expression. Although the reactivity of scFv for both ATF1 and CREB is a useful property, further affinity maturation toward either transcription factor may allow specific inhibition of biological activity.Multiple approaches were taken to demonstrate that the activity of scFv was specific for the CRE-binding proteins, ATF1 and CREB. The adenovirus major late promoter was chosen because it contains only a TATA box and a pair of MAZ and Sp1 elements (38Song B. Young C.S. Virology. 1997; 235: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 39Parks C.L. Shenk T. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9600-9607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Horwitz M.S. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Fields Virology. 2nd Ed. 2. Raven Press, Philadelphia1996: 1679-1721Google Scholar). No CRE or CRE-like sequences are present in the AdML promoter. Additionally, adding back ATF1 or CREB to the intracellular scFv system reversed the effects of scFv upon the PCNA promoter.In our transfection studies, scFv showed a greater inhibitory effect on the PCNA promoter than the CMV-IE promoter, with 56 and 25% decreases in the promoter activities, respectively. The PCNA construct encompasses −182 to +143 of the promoter and contains single Ap2, Oct, and Sp1 elements as well as a tandem CRE. These two CREs have been shown to contribute the major activity of this promoter and are primarily activated by ATF1 (24Huang D. Shipman A.P. Orten D.J. Hinrichs S.H. Prytowski M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4233-4243Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The CMV promoter we used contained region −760 to +75 of the major IE promoter, and five 19-base pair repeat elements with a CRE at each of their cores are located in this region. In addition to CREs, the CMV-IE promoter contains other binding sites for transcription factors, including NF-κB, Ap1, Sp1, C/EBP, and NF1. The presence of these additional binding sites for other transcriptional activators most likely accounts for the decreased effect of scFv upon the CMV-IE promoter as compared with the PCNA promoter. The relative strengths of ATF1 and CREB as activators of the CRE (48Flint K.J. Jones N.C. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 2019-2026PubMed Google Scholar) and the intracellular ratios of ATF1 to CREB may also contribute to the observed effects. Whether the difference in activation will correlate with a physiologic change in cell viability or activity is yet to be determined. However, due to its ability to interfere with the activity of ATF1 and CREB, the scFv fragment is a useful tool for novel studies of CRE-mediated cellular differentiation, tumorigenesis, and viral pathogenesis. Although studied extensively, the cellular roles of ATF1 and CREB have not been fully determined. CREB is an important mediator of cAMP-activated transcription, whereas ATF1 activates transcription in some cell lines (41Rehfuss R.P. Walton K.M. Loriaux M.M. Goodman R.H. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1989872325,"RNA polymerase III transcription is down-regulated when F9 embryonal carcinoma cells differentiate into parietal endoderm. This reflects a decrease in the activity of TFIIIB, a multisubunit complex that is required for all class III gene expression. Two essential components of TFIIIB are the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and an associated polypeptide called BRF that is specific to this complex. The abundance of both TBP and BRF decreases during F9 cell differentiation. Whereas the amount of TBP assembled into TFIIIB is down-regulated, this is not the case for all TBP-containing complexes. BRF levels show a more dramatic decline that appears sufficient to account for the overall change in transcriptional activity. Developmental regulation of a specific class of genes may therefore be achieved through changes in the availability of a TBP-associated factor."

Using a Chinese hamster ovary cell expression library, we have shown that this antigen corresponds to the autosomal Fragile-X-related gene FXR1. The deduced amino acid sequence from the hamster cDNA is 97, 98, and 58% homologous to the human, mouse, and Xenopus laevis FXR1 genes, respectively. Expression of the hamster cDNA clone in Escherichia coli and antibody production indicates unequivocally the location of the FXR1 protein in the cytoplasm of hamster cells. Affinity chromatography followed by immunofluorescence microscopy analysis and immunoblots demonstrated the presence of autoimmune IgGs to FXR1 in the scleroderma patient. Immunolabeling studies in Jurkat cells, induced to apoptosis by anti-Fas/APO1 serum, indicated that the FXR1 antigens were clearly displaced from their original cytoplasmic location to several punctuated foci, resembling the bleb-like membranous structures characteristic of cells at certain stages of apoptosis. This phenomenon could be part of a putative mechanism in which the FXR1 protein is presented as a target for the autoimmune response in humans.

Immunolabeling studies in Jurkat cells, induced to apoptosis by anti-Fas/APO1 serum, indicated that the FXR1 antigens were clearly displaced from their original cytoplasmic location to several punctuated foci, resembling the bleb-like membranous structures characteristic of cells at certain stages of apoptosis. This phenomenon could be part of a putative mechanism in which the FXR1 protein is presented as a target for the autoimmune response in humans. Human autoimmune sera have proven to be remarkably powerful investigative tools for cell and molecular biologists. In addition to allowing the identification of many cellular proteins, human autoantibodies have also been used to study the details of several intracellular events. One example has been the elucidation of the mechanisms involved in the processing of heterogenous nuclear RNA to mRNA (1Steitz J.A. Sci. Am. 1988; 258: 56-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Thus, autoantibodies to ribonucleoprotein particles have been observed in many patients suffering rheumatoid diseases (2White B. Curr. Opin. Rheumatol. 1995; 7: 541-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 3Tan E.M. Adv. Immunol. 1982; 33: 167-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar, 4Tan E.M. Adv. Immunol. 1989; 44: 93-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar). Among others, these include anti-RNP directed against U1RNP (5Lerner M.R. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5495-5499Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar), anti-Sm directed against U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6 RNPs (6Lerner E.A. Lerner M.R. Janeway C.A. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2737-2741Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar), anti-Ro/SS-A directed against Y-RNPs (7Lerner M.R. Steitz J.A Cell. 1981; 25: 298-300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and anti/La/SS-B directed against several cellular RNPs (8Mattiolo M. Reichlin M. Arthritis Rheum. 1974; 17: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). These autoantigens are particularly prominent in disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), scleroderma or systemic sclerosis (SSc), 1The abbreviations used are: SSc, systemic sclerosis; IF, immunofluorescence; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. and mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) (9Conrad K. Tan E.M. Humbel R.-L. Shoenfeld Y. Clin. Exp. Rheum. 1997; 15: 457-465PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of a variety of adhesion molecules is increased on fibroblasts and endothelial cells in SSc patients, as are circulating levels of the same molecules. In some cases, genetic factors influence the repertory of autoantigens to which the host loses tolerance (10Whyte J. Artlett C. Harvey G. Stephens C.O. Welsh K. Black C. Maddison D.J. McHugh N.J. J. Autoimmun. 1994; 7: 509-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). When Hep-2 cells are used as substrate, virtually every patient with scleroderma (95–97%) will have a positive test result for antinuclear and/or antinucleolar antibody (ANAs) in indirect immunofluorescence (IF) (11Bernstein R.M. Steigerwald J.C. Tan E.M. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1982; 48: 43-48PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, nucleolar IF has been suggested as a diagnostic possibility for SSc since antibodies that target this region of the cell are unusual in the other connective tissue diseases (3Tan E.M. Adv. Immunol. 1982; 33: 167-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). In an attempt to characterize scleroderma autoantigens, we have screened sera that produced nucleolar staining by immunofluorescence from a large number of patients suffering autoimmune diseases. Here we describe the identification and molecular characterization of a hamster cDNA for a novel autoantigen that turned out to be FXR1, an autosomal homolog of FMR1. Mutations and CGG expansions in the FMR1 gene are associated with Fragile-X syndrome. Immunological studies presented reveal that the behavior of the FXR1 protein in cells undergoing apoptosis suggests a putative way for this protein to be implicated in the human autoimmune response (12Casiano C.A. Martin S.J. Green D.R. Tan E.M. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 765-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Restriction enzymes were obtained from Promega and Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All radionucleotides were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All tissue culture reagents were from Life Technologies, Inc. Oligonucleotides were obtained from Eurogentec, Belgium. Antibodies were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. λ ZAP II hamster expression library was obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). CNBr-activated Sepharose was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All other chemicals were of the highest grade available and obtained from Sigma. Immunofluorescence was carried out on CHO, HeLa, and Jurkat cells using formaldehyde fixation and a brief Triton X-100 lysis as described (13Valdivia M.M. Brinkley B.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 101: 1124-1134Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-FXR1 sera was generated as indicated below and used at a dilution of 1:500 in PBS. In some cases, affinity purified human autoimmune IgGs was used as a primary serum. Detection of the primary antibodies was with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies made in goat and used at 1:100 dilution in PBS. Coverslips were counterstained with Hoechst 33528 for DNA, mounted in PBS:glycerol 1:9 (v/v), and observed in a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence microscope equipped with a 1:63 immersion oil objective. 3 × 105 plaques of λ ZAP hamster cDNA library were screened to obtain FXR1 cDNAs using a human autoimmune serum named JC. Three positives clones sequenced were shown to be highly homologous to the human FXR1 gene (14Siomi M.C. Siomi H. Sauer W. Srinivasan S. Nussbaum R. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2401-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Since no initial clones contained the entire open reading frame encoding FXR1, a 5′-RACE approach was used as described. All plasmids and cDNA fragments were manipulated using standard techniques (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.53-1.82Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of overlapping clones was verified by DNA sequencing (16Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52746) Google Scholar). An N-terminal region (residues 1–222) of the hamster FXR1 cDNA was expressed by the pET-3a system in Escherichia coli using an NdeI-site at the 5′ end and aBamHI-site at the 3′ end included in the polymerase chain reaction primers used for cloning. The expressed protein (34 kDa) was analyzed by SDS gel electrophoresis, isolated from inclusion bodies after cell sonication, and used as immunogen for polyclonal antibodies production in rabbits. Western blots were performed with recombinant truncated FXR1 and CHO whole cell extracts with both human autoimmune serum JC (diluted 1:200) and rabbit anti-FXR1 sera (diluted 1:500). Detection of the primary antibodies was with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies used at 1:2000 dilution in PBS. Development of the blot membranes was with 4-chloro-1-naphthol. The FXR1 expressed polypeptide was bound to CNBr-activated Sepharose according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The resin was washed with PBS and equilibrated with PBS containing 0.5 mm NaCl (final concentration). 3 ml of human autoimmune serum JC containing anti FXR1 IgGs were loaded into the affinity column (resin volume was 1.5 ml), washed extensively with PBS-NaCl buffer, and eluted with 0.2 m glycine, pH 2.5. Aliquots of 250 μl were collected and equilibrated immediately with 1m Tris, pH 8.0. IgGs were confirmed in the eluate by SDS-gel electrophoresis and used for immunofluorescence microscopy and Western blot analysis without further treatment. Total RNA from CHO culture cells was extracted using the acid guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol-chloroform extraction method (17Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63225) Google Scholar). RNA samples were separated by electrophoresis in formaldehyde, 1% agarose in MOPS buffer. Northern blotting (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.53-1.82Google Scholar) was carried out using a polymerase chain reaction fragment obtained from the largest clone of the hamster FXR1 cDNA, representing nucleotides 1–666. We have used a human autoantibody from a scleroderma patient to screen a CHO cDNA expression library and have isolated clones corresponding to the hamster FXR1 gene. The largest CHO FXR1 cDNA characterized is 2141 nucleotides long, encoding a 621 amino acid chain (Fig. 1). A 5′-untranslated sequence region CGG repeat was not found in the sequenced clone. This characteristic CGG repeat was described before as part of the human FMR1 cDNA (18Fu Y.-H. Kuhl D.P. Pizzuti A. Pieretti M. Sutcliffe J.S. Richards S. Verkerk J.M.H. Holden J.J. Fenwick R.G.

Bioessays. 1995; 11: 941-947Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Overall, we found a 97, 98, and 58% homology of amino acid sequence between hamster FXR1 and human, mouse, and frog FXR1 genes, respectively (Fig. 2).Figure 2Alignment of hamster (CG) FXR1 amino acid sequence with human (HS), mouse (MM), and Xenopus laevis(XL) FXR1 proteins. Identical amino acids are shaded. The frog protein contains 29 extra residues not found in the three mammalian species (gap). Major amino acid residue variants are found in three of the proteins at the C-terminal tail. Note that the sequence of the mouse FXR1 gene represented is a shorter form of the gene (21Coy J.F. Sedlacek Z. Bächner D. Hameister H. Joos S. Lichter P. Delius H. Poustka A. Hum. Mol.

Cell. 1991; 67: 1047-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1773) Google Scholar). The hamster FXR1 gene also contains an arginine-rich sequence similar to arginine-rich motifs found in several proteins including HIV Rev (20Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar) as described previously for other FXR1 genes. Major differences in amino acid sequences between the hamster and FXR1 genes from other species are found at the very end of the C-terminal region (residues 590–618). It has to be mentioned that the sequence of the mouse FXR1 gene available represents a shorter form of this gene (21Coy J.F. Sedlacek Z. Bächner D. Hameister H. Joos S. Lichter P. Delius H. Poustka A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 2209-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The hamster cDNA was used in a Northern blot analysis with total RNA from CHO cells (Fig. 3). A prominent transcript of about 2.3 kilobases was detected, which correlates well with that described in HeLa cells (14Siomi M.C. Siomi H. Sauer W. Srinivasan S. Nussbaum R. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2401-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). However, our blot result does not rule out the possibility of additional FXR1 transcripts with close sizes in CHO cells, as was shown previously for human and mouse tissues, where two FXR1 messengers of 2.4 and 2.2 kilobases were identified as a result of an alternative splicing (14Siomi M.C. Siomi H. Sauer W. Srinivasan S. Nussbaum R. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2401-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar,21Coy J.F. Sedlacek Z. Bächner D. Hameister H. Joos S. Lichter P. Delius H. Poustka A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 2209-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The hamster FXR1 cDNA was further used to express the N terminus of the molecule in E. coli, and the expressed polypeptide was purified to a high concentration from inclusion bodies. Two polyclonal sera were generated against recombinant FXR1 protein and used in apoptosis studies (see below). We present immunological evidence that the human autoimmune serum JC used in the screening of the λ ZAP library reacts with the expressed hamster FXR1 antigen (Fig. 4 A, center panel). Data included in the same figure also show the blotting with a polyclonal serum generated against the recombinant N-terminal region of expressed hamster FXR1 (Fig. 4 B, right panel). Furthermore, this recombinant truncated FXR1 protein was used to make an affinity column to isolate human specific anti-FXR1 immunoglobulins. It is important to state that FXR1 does not appear to be the major autoantigen found in the serum JC. This was demonstrated by immunoblots in CHO whole cell extracts using human serum JC (Fig. 4 B, center panel, lane 1), anti-FXR1 affinity purified human immunoglobulins (Fig. 4 B, center panel, lane 2), and polyclonal serum to hamster FXR1 (Fig. 4 B, right panel, lane 1). These results clearly indicate that: (i) a 70-kDa protein corresponding to the hamster FXR1 antigen is recognized by the human autoantibody, and ii) it is not the major autoantigen of the human serum JC. Another protein of 55 kDa is the autoantigen most probably responsible for the predominant nucleolar staining observed by IF with the whole human autoantibody JC (data not shown). Furthermore, immunofluorescence microscopy of culture cells with affinity-purified human anti-FXR1 IgGs revealed a punctate cytoplasm staining in CHO (Fig. 5 b) and HeLa cells (Fig. 5 f). This IF staining was similar to that observed using rabbit antibodies to the recombinant FXR1 hamster protein generated in vitro (Fig. 5, d andh). Eventually, some weak nuclear staining was observed with the rabbit anti-FXR1 sera. Double IF staining demonstrated unambiguously that the serum from patient JC contains antibodies that co-localized with the serum anti-FXR1 generated in rabbits (data not shown). It has been suggested that some mechanistic correlation may exist between the autoimmune phenomenon and apoptosis (12Casiano C.A. Martin S.J. Green D.R. Tan E.M. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 765-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). It was proposed that the selective protein cleavage associated with apoptosis may enhance the immunogenicity of autoantigens by revealing immunocryptic epitopes that are not efficiently generated during antigen processing (22Casciola-Rosen L.A. Anhalt G.J. Rosen A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1625-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). In order to determine the behavior of the FXR1 protein in cells undergoing apoptosis in vitro, we did immunofluorescence studies of FXR1 localization in Jurkat cells treated with anti-Fas/APO-1 serum (23Nagata S. Golstein P. Science. 1995; 267: 1449-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (3979) Google Scholar). The IF results in Fig. 6 with anti-FXR1 serum showed the re-distribution of the FXR1 cytoplasmic antigen to certain specific foci on apoptotic cells. These foci resembled those bleb-like structures observed during the apoptosis phenomenon (12Casiano C.A. Martin S.J. Green D.R. Tan E.M. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 765-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 22Casciola-Rosen L.A. Anhalt G.J. Rosen A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1625-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). In this report, we have identified and described a new human autoantigen in a patient with scleroderma, by cloning the gene from a CHO cDNA expression library. The cDNA revealed an amino acid sequence homologous to the human autosomal gene FXR1, a gene related to the FMR1 protein responsible for the Fragile-X syndrome in humans (24Siomi H. Siomi M.C. Nussbaum R.L. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1993; 74: 291-298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 25Ashley Jr., C.T. Wilkinson K.D. Reines D. Warren S.T.

Cell. 1991; 65: 905-914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2942) Google Scholar). This syndrome is the most common inherited form of mental retardation. The human, mouse, and frog cDNAs for FXR1 have been previously sequenced (14Siomi M.C. Siomi H. Sauer W. Srinivasan S. Nussbaum R. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2401-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 21Coy J.F. Sedlacek Z. Bächner D. Hameister H. Joos S. Lichter P. Delius H. Poustka A. Hum. Mol.

EMBO J. 1995; 21: 5358-5366Crossref Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The major differences in amino acid sequences we have found between hamster and the other FXR1 cDNAs isolated are in the final 30 amino acid residues of the C-terminal region. This region as described for the FMR and FXR protein family is produced by alternative splicing and introduces potential functional differences between the gene products. These proteins have similar RNA binding activities in vitro, and both are located in the cytoplasm being the RNA 60 S, the putative binding site for FXR1, as demonstrated by biochemical fractionation in vitro (28Siomi M.C. Zhang Y. Siomi H. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3825-3832Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). However, some previous evidence from other groups, and our own IF analysis, do not rule out an additional nuclear binding site for the FXR1 antigen during the cell cycle. By expressing the hamster FXR1 cDNA and the production of specific anti-FXR1 antibodies, we demonstrated the autoimmune nature of the FXR1 gene product in a patient suffering from scleroderma. As one of the group of related systemic rheumatic diseases, scleroderma is characterized by a high level of circulating autoantibodies, especially to nuclear antigens (4Tan E.M. Adv. Immunol. 1989; 44: 93-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar, 29Peng S.L. Fatenejad A. Craft J. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 276-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The observation that FXR1 protein is a human autoantigen raises questions of possible association between FXR1 (and possibly FMR1) and autoimmune responses in humans. Activation of the immune system is a consistent early event in SSc, and some autoantibodies may be generated in SSc patients through the antigen processing of complexes involved in gene transcription. The generation of autoantibodies and subsequent tissue deposition of immune complexes is thought to trigger the pathogenic consequences of systemic autoimmune disease. The origin of autoimmune diseases is not yet known but several hypotheses have been put forward and clues have been found (30Sinha A.A. Lopez M.T. McDevitt H.O. Science. 1990; 2: 1380-1388Crossref Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Our IF staining results indicated that the FXR1 antigen behaves like other human nuclear autoantigens analyzed (12Casiano C.A. Martin S.J. Green D.R. Tan E.M. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 765-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). It moves from its original cytoplasmic binding site associated with ribosomes to more punctuated foci. These new locations resemble the typical bleb-like membrane organelles found in apoptotic cells. Although the significance of this change of location and the putative cleavage of FXR1 during apoptosis requires more specific studies, the re-distribution of the FXR1 antigen in apoptosis follows a pattern that could contribute to the nature of the autoimmune response (12Casiano C.A. Martin S.J. Green D.R. Tan E.M. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 765-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 22Casciola-Rosen L.A. Anhalt G.J. Rosen A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1625-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). If this is the case for FXR1, it would be interesting to pursue more extensive studies to gain a better understanding of the nature of the autoimmune response to a gene related to a genetic disorder such as the Fragile-X syndrome. With that in mind, studies to identify the human autoepitope(s) in the FXR1 protein are underway. We thank the members of Servicio de Inmunologı́a of Hospital Puerta del Mar of Cádiz for assistance with the apoptosis studies and Royston Snart for language advice during elaboration of the manuscript."

STAT4 becomes activated when cells are treated with interleukin-12, a key cytokine regulator of cell-mediated immunity.

Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4948) Google Scholar). JAK-STAT signaling commences when cytokine binding induces receptor dimerization, which brings cytoplasmic, receptor-associated JAKs into apposition and enables them to self-activate by reciprocal transphosphorylation. The activated kinases phosphorylate a distal tyrosine on the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor, which can then be recognized by the SH2 domain of a specific STAT protein. Upon association with the receptor, a tyrosine residue near the carboxyl terminus of the STAT protein is phosphorylated by the JAK kinase. Now activated, the STAT protein can form homo- or heterodimers in which the phosphotyrosine of one partner binds to the SH2 domain of the other. The STAT dimers then migrate to the nucleus, where they participate in transcriptional activation by binding to specific DNA sequences, termed interferon-γ activation sequence (GAS) elements.Thus far, only seven different STATs and four JAK family members have been identified (2Darnell J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3345) Google Scholar), which raises the question of how transcriptional specificity is achieved in cytokine signal transduction: that is, how can a relatively small number of JAKs and STATs elicit distinct responses to a much larger number of cytokines and growth factors, particularly when all but one of the STATs appear to bind preferentially to the same DNA sequence (2Darnell J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3345) Google Scholar). Recently, Xu et al. (5Xu X. Sun Y.-L. Hoey T. Science. 1996; 273: 794-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) characterized authentic binding sites for STATs 1, 4, 5, and 6 within the first intron of the interferon-γ (IFN-γ) gene by DNase I footprinting. Remarkably, these experiments revealed that rather than binding to the same sites, as might have been expected, STATs 1, 4, and 5 each bound to a distinct pattern of adjacent sites, none of which bears a close resemblance to the high-affinity, consensus sequence identified by the random selection method. Instead, these binding sites consist of tandem arrays of imperfect GAS elements that are separated by 10 base pairs or about one turn of the helix in B-form DNA. The binding of STAT4 to these tandem sites is cooperative in nature; simultaneous occupancy of multiple sites is required to achieve a stable association with the DNA. The amino-terminal 124 residues of STAT4 are essential for cooperative binding to these adjacent low-affinity sites, but not for its ability to be phosphorylated, to dimerize, or to bind to, a single high-affinity site (5Xu X. Sun Y.-L. Hoey T. Science. 1996; 273: 794-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Xu et al. (5Xu X. Sun Y.-L. Hoey T. Science. 1996; 273: 794-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) proposed that this cooperativity results from a direct interaction between the amino-terminal domains of STAT dimers bound to adjacent sites on DNA. A similar result has been obtained with STAT1 (6Vinkemeier U. Cohen S.L. Moarefi I. Chait B.T. Kuriyan J. Darnell J.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5616-5626Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), and it seems likely that the other STATs also use their amino-terminal domains for cooperative binding (2Darnell J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3345) Google Scholar).STAT4 is activated in response to interleukin-12 (IL-12), which plays a primary role in the development of T helper 1 (TH1) cells and in the induction of organ-specific autoimmune diseases (7Seder R.A. Kelsall B.L. Jankovic D. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2745-2748PubMed Google Scholar, 8Trembleau S. Germann T. Gately M.K. Adorini L. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 383-386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Cooperative binding of STAT4 dimers to adjacent low-affinity GAS sites is required for transcriptional activation of IFN-γ (5Xu X. Sun Y.-L. Hoey T. Science. 1996; 273: 794-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), which is thought to mediate many of the effects of IL-12 (9Trinchieri G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 251-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (2217) Google Scholar). Therefore, a small molecule that can bind to the amino-terminal domain of STAT4 and prevent its self-association might be an effective immunosuppressant. To facilitate the discovery of such a therapeutic agent, we have undertaken an effort to determine the three-dimensional structure of this domain in solution and elucidate the molecular details of its self-association. To this end, we have overproduced the amino-terminal domain of human STAT4 (hSTAT4(1–124)) in Escherichia coliand purified it to homogeneity. Furthermore, we have characterized this fragment of STAT4 by circular dichroism (CD) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques and report that it has a well ordered conformation in solution that is amenable to structure determination.DISCUSSIONAlthough it is not required for binding to single, high-affinity GAS sites, the amino-terminal domain of STAT4 is essential for cooperative binding to tandem arrays of low affinity sites within the IFN-γ gene and for the stimulation of its transcription in response to IL-12 (5Xu X. Sun Y.-L. Hoey T. Science. 1996; 273: 794-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Like IFN-γ, many genes probably will utilize tandem arrays of low-affinity sites for activation. If so, then the amino-terminal domains of the STATs may be attractive targets for therapeutic agents that seek to attenuate cytokine signal transduction.The experiments reported here indicate that hSTAT4(1–124) has a well ordered conformation in solution that is amenable to structure determination by heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. Furthermore, they reveal that hSTAT4(1–124) forms a stable, symmetric homodimer at high micromolar concentrations. The existence of a dimeric form of hSTAT4(1–124) is consistent with current models of transcriptional activation, which postulate that cooperative binding of STATs to adjacent low affinity GAS sites involves a physical interaction between their amino-terminal domains (2Darnell J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3345) Google Scholar, 5Xu X. Sun Y.-L. Hoey T. Science. 1996; 273: 794-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 6Vinkemeier U. Cohen S.L. Moarefi I. Chait B.T. Kuriyan J. Darnell J.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5616-5626Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar).But does the hSTAT4(1–124) dimer that we observe in solution at high micromolar concentrations have any physiological relevance? It has not been possible to detect a similar interaction between the amino-terminal domains of native (i.e. full-length) STATs in solution (22Vinkemeier U. Moarefi I. Darnell J.E. Kuriyan J. Science. 1998; 279: 1048-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Rather, such an association is evident only when pairs of STAT dimers are bound cooperatively to adjacent sites on DNA (5Xu X. Sun Y.-L. Hoey T. Science. 1996; 273: 794-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 6Vinkemeier U. Cohen S.L. Moarefi I. Chait B.T. Kuriyan J. Darnell J.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5616-5626Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). It is not known whether the failure to detect this interaction in the absence of DNA is because of its inherently weak nature or whether the higher order structural organization of the STATs somehow precludes an intermolecular association between amino-terminal domains in solution. Because of its unusually low exctinction coefficient, it will be difficult to determine the equilibrium dissociation constant for the hSTAT4(1–124) dimer. Using the technique of dynamic light scattering, however, we have been able to show that hSTAT4(1–124) is unquestionably dimeric at 10 μm, the lowest concentration at which we can obtain reliable data with our instrument (data not shown). Thus, the actual dissociation constant is probably on the order of 1 μm or less. This value is several orders of magnitude lower than the protein concentration in the NMR experiments and not much greater than what is generally regarded as a physiologically meaningful concentration for an intracellular protein. Besides, in the presence of DNA, which forms a bridge between two pairs of STAT dimers, the local concentration of the amino-terminal domains is probably much greater than 10 μm. For these reasons, we do not believe that the hSTAT4(1–124) dimer is merely an artifact that arises at unnaturally high protein concentrations.If, as we expect, the structure of the hSTAT4(1–124) dimer is physiologically relevant, then this information could be exploited to design compounds that will bind to the monomeric form of the amino-terminal domain and prevent its self-association. In this regard, it is interesting to note that almost all of the amino acid side chains that compose the dimer interface in the crystal structure of murine STAT4(1–124) are not conserved among the different STATs (22Vinkemeier U. Moarefi I. Darnell J.E. Kuriyan J. Science. 1998; 279: 1048-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). This suggests that it should be possible to develop compounds of this type with high specificity for a particular STAT. Cytokines mediate communication between cells in the immune system by binding to specific receptors and stimulating the transcription of distinct sets of genes.

Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4948) Google Scholar). JAK-STAT signaling commences when cytokine binding induces receptor dimerization, which brings cytoplasmic, receptor-associated JAKs into apposition and enables them to self-activate by reciprocal transphosphorylation. The activated kinases phosphorylate a distal tyrosine on the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor, which can then be recognized by the SH2 domain of a specific STAT protein. Upon association with the receptor, a tyrosine residue near the carboxyl terminus of the STAT protein is phosphorylated by the JAK kinase. Now activated, the STAT protein can form homo- or heterodimers in which the phosphotyrosine of one partner binds to the SH2 domain of the other. The STAT dimers then migrate to the nucleus, where they participate in transcriptional activation by binding to specific DNA sequences, termed interferon-γ activation sequence (GAS) elements. Thus far, only seven different STATs and four JAK family members have been identified (2Darnell J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3345) Google Scholar), which raises the question of how transcriptional specificity is achieved in cytokine signal transduction: that is, how can a relatively small number of JAKs and STATs elicit distinct responses to a much larger number of cytokines and growth factors, particularly when all but one of the STATs appear to bind preferentially to the same DNA sequence (2Darnell J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3345) Google Scholar). Recently, Xu et al. (5Xu X. Sun Y.-L. Hoey T. Science. 1996; 273: 794-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) characterized authentic binding sites for STATs 1, 4, 5, and 6 within the first intron of the interferon-γ (IFN-γ) gene by DNase I footprinting. Remarkably, these experiments revealed that rather than binding to the same sites, as might have been expected, STATs 1, 4, and 5 each bound to a distinct pattern of adjacent sites, none of which bears a close resemblance to the high-affinity, consensus sequence identified by the random selection method. Instead, these binding sites consist of tandem arrays of imperfect GAS elements that are separated by 10 base pairs or about one turn of the helix in B-form DNA. The binding of STAT4 to these tandem sites is cooperative in nature; simultaneous occupancy of multiple sites is required to achieve a stable association with the DNA.

The reason for this temperature sensitivity was thought to be that the melibiose transporter (MelB) of W3133 cells was temperature-sensitive. A mutant W3133-2 has been isolated as a temperature-resistant strain that can utilize melibiose between 37 and 42 °C. However, we found that the melibiose transporter of the W3133-2 was still temperature-sensitive.

Furthermore, we found that the nucleotide sequence of coding region of the melB structural gene (the second gene of the melibiose operon) of W3133-2 was exactly the same as that of W3133. Activity of α-galactosidase (product of the first gene, melA, of the melibiose operon) of W3133 cells grown at 40 °C was very low, although that of W3133-2 cells grown at 40 °C was high. These observations suggested that expression of the melibiose operon in W3133 is also temperature-sensitive. In fact, we found that the expression in W3133 cells was temperature-sensitive, while that in W3133-2 cells was temperature-resistant, by analyzing mRNA levels using the Northern blot method. Furthermore, we identified mutations in the promoter region of the melibiose operon of W3133-2 that resulted in the elongation of an 18 nucleotide inverted repeat sequence to a 28-nucleotide repeat sequence present immediately upstream of the −35 region.

For utilization of melibiose by Escherichia coli, both the melibiose transporter and α-galactosidase are necessary. The melibiose transporter mediates uptake of melibiose into cells. The α-galactosidase catalyzes cleavage of melibiose into galactose and glucose, which are metabolized via the glycolysis pathway. Genes encoding these two proteins, melA (α-galactosidase) andmelB (melibiose transporter), constitute structural genes in the melibiose operon (1Schmitt R. J. Bacteriol. 1968; 96: 462-471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Levinthal M. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 105: 1047-1052Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Hanatani M. Yazyu H. Shiota-Niiya S. Moriyama Y. Kanazawa H. Futai M. Tsuchiya T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1807-1812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The melibiose operon is inducible by either melibiose or garactinol (4Prestidge L.S. Pardee A.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 100: 591-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), or melibiitol (2Levinthal M. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 105: 1047-1052Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A regulatory gene for the melibiose operon, melR, is located in a region upstream of the melAB genes in the opposite orientation (5Webster C. Kaempsell K. Booth I. Busby S. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 59: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The MelR is an activator necessary for expression of themelAB genes. An inducer such as melibiose is required to activate MelR (6Webster C. Gardner L. Busby S. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 83: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The melibiose transporter in E. coli was first reported as the TMG 1The abbreviations used are: TMG, methyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; MOPS, morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. permease II, because this transport system was found to be the second transport system for TMG (4Prestidge L.S. Pardee A.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 100: 591-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The first TMG transport system (TMG permease I) is known as the lactose transporter LacY (7Kennedy E.P. Beckwith J.R. Zipser D. The Lactose Operon. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1970: 49-92Google Scholar). LacY is also able to transport melibiose (7Kennedy E.P. Beckwith J.R. Zipser D. The Lactose Operon. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1970: 49-92Google Scholar). Therefore there are two transport systems for melibiose in E. coli cells. One of the unique properties of the melibiose transporter in E. coli K12 and its derivatives is that it is a temperature-sensitive system (4Prestidge L.S. Pardee A.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 100: 591-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). When cells are grown at 30 °C, the melibiose transporter is active, but if cells are grown at 37 °C or above, the transporter is inactive. We have previously shown that the melibiose transporter, but not α-galactosidase, was irreversibly inactivated by incubation at 37 °C (8Tsuchiya T. Lopilato J. Wilson T.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1978; 42: 45-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It is necessary to use a LacY-defective mutant to investigate the melibiose transporter. E. coli W3133 is a derivative of K12 and lacks the lactose transporter (9Lopilato J. Tsuchiya T. Wilson T.H. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 147-156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The melibiose transporter of W3133 is temperature-sensitive (9Lopilato J. Tsuchiya T. Wilson T.H. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 147-156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A mutant W3133-2 was isolated as a temperature-resistant strain derived from W3133 (9Lopilato J. Tsuchiya T. Wilson T.H. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 147-156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although cells of W3133 showed either very poor growth or no growth on melibiose as a sole source of carbon at 37 °C, cells of W3133-2 showed normal growth at this temperature (9Lopilato J. Tsuchiya T. Wilson T.H. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 147-156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or even at 40 °C. 2E. Tamai, T. Mizushima, and T. Tsuchiya, unpublished results. Furthermore, cells of W3133 grown and induced at 37 °C showed either little or no activity of the melibiose transporter. Cells of W3133-2 grown and induced at the same temperature showed high activity (9Lopilato J. Tsuchiya T. Wilson T.H. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 147-156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it seemed very clear that the melibiose transporter of W3133 cells is temperature-sensitive and that of W3133-2 cells is temperature-resistant. We have cloned and sequenced the melBgene of E. coli. The amino acid sequence of this melibiose transporter protein has been deduced from melB (10Yazyu H. Shiota-Niiya S. Shimamoto T. Kanazawa H. Futai M. Tsuchiya T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4320-4326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus it became possible to identify the substituted amino acid residue(s) in the melibiose transporter of the temperature-resistant W3133-2. However, we found no mutation in the nucleotide sequence of themelB gene from the mutant strain (W3133-2).2These results suggest that the reason for the temperature-resistant growth of W3133-2 cells on melibiose is not due to changes in the primary structure of the melibiose transporter but in other factor(s) of W3133-2. Here we report that gene expression of the melibiose operon in the parental strain is temperature-sensitive and that in the mutant strain is temperature-resistant. We found mutations in the promoter region of the melibiose operon of the mutant. E. coli W3133, a derivative of K12, is a lactose-deleted (ΔlacZY) strain containing the wild type melibiose utilization system (9Lopilato J. Tsuchiya T. Wilson T.H. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 147-156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells of W3133 are unable to grow on melibiose as a sole source of carbon at 37 °C or above. A mutant called W3133-2, a derivative of W3133, was isolated as a temperature-resistant strain with regard to melibiose utilization and can grow on melibiose at 37 °C (9Lopilato J. Tsuchiya T. Wilson T.H. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 147-156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli DW1 (ΔlacZY, ΔmelAB) (11Wilson D.M. Wilson T.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 904: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) was used as a host for cloning of the melibiose operon from chromosomal DNA of W3133 and W3133-2. Cells of W3133 and W3133-2 were first grown in the LB medium (12Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 440Google Scholar) at 37 °C, diluted 200-fold into a modified Tanaka medium (13Tanaka S. Lerner S.A. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1967; 93: 642-648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Na+ salts were replaced with K+ salts) supplemented with 1% tryptone, 0.0001% thiamine, and 10 mm melibiose (an inducer of the melibiose operon) and shaken at 30, 34, 37, 40, or 42 °C under aerobic conditions. Cells were harvested at logarithmic phase of growth. For measurement of the growth on melibiose, cells were first grown in the modified Tanaka medium supplemented with 10 mmmelibiose at 30 °C, diluted 200-fold into fresh medium, and shaken at various temperatures under aerobic conditions. Cell growth was monitored turbidimetrically at 650 nm. TMG uptake was measured as described previously (9Lopilato J. Tsuchiya T. Wilson T.H. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 147-156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modification using [methyl-14C]TMG as a substrate. To test the effect of temperature on the transport activity, cells suspended in the modified Tanaka medium containing 10 μg/ml chloramphenicol were incubated at 30, 37, 40, or 42 °C for the indicated time. The transport assays were performed in the modified Tanaka medium containing 20 mm potassium lactate, 20 mm NaCl, 10 μg/ml chloramphenicol, cells (0.15 mg of protein/ml), and 0.1 mm [14C]TMG at 25 °C. α-Galactosidase activity was measured as described previously (14Burstein C. Kepes A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 230: 52-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) usingp-nitrophenyl-α-d-galactopyranoside as a substrate. Total cellular RNA was prepared fromE. coli cells by the method of Aiba et al. (15Aiba H. Adhya S. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11905-11910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RNA was denatured with formaldehyde and then electophoresed on 1% agarose, 2 mformaldehyde gel with constant recirculation of a buffer solution (20 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 7.0, 5 mmCH3COONa, 1 mm EDTA). rRNA in the gel was visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. Total RNA in the gel was transferred to a nylon membrane, Hybond-N (Amersham Corp.), overnight by the capillary transfer method as suggested by the manufacturer, and then hybridization was performed as described previously (16Ohtani K. Sakurai H. Oh E. Iwata E. Tsuchiya T. Tsuda M. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 605-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The DNA probe was synthesized and labeled with [α-32P]CTP using the MultiprimeTM DNA labeling system (Amersham Corp.) with a melB-specific primer (5′-AGGCGATAGAAACGGAAG-3′) and aBamHI fragment derived from the melB gene as the template. The synthesized labeled DNA probe covers 80% of themelB gene. The filter was washed twice with 2× SSPE (180 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2PO4and 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.7) containing 0.5% SDS at 70 °C, once with SSPE containing 0.5% SDS at 70 °C, and once with 10-fold diluted SSPE containing 0.5% SDS at room temperature. The filter was air-dried and exposed to an imaging plate (Fuji Film Co.) to determine the amount of melAB mRNA and to x-ray film (Fuji Film Co.) at −70 °C with an intensifying screen to visualize themelAB mRNA. The amount of melAB mRNA was determined by densitometric scanning using BAS 2000 (Fuji Film Co.). Chromosomal DNA was prepared from W3133 cells or W3133-2 cells as described elsewhere (17Berns K.I. Thomas Jr., C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 11: 476-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The DNA was digested with the restriction endonuclease EcoRI. The digested fragments were ligated to pBR322 which had been digested withEcoRI and treated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase using a ligation kit (TaKaRa Co.). After the ligation, competent cells ofE. coli DW1 (ΔmelAB) were transformed with the hybrid plasmids. Transformants that grew on agar (1.5%) plates containing the modified Tanaka medium, 10 mm melibiose and 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin were picked. Candidate plasmids were digested with several restriction endonucleases to test whether the plasmids carry the melibiose operon. The plasmid carrying the EcoRI fragment containing the melibiose operon from W3133 was designated as pBM3133 and that from W3133-2 as pBM3133-2. For sequencing, DNA fragments from the cloned region were subcloned into pBluescript II KS(+). The subcloned fragments were sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method (18Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52766) Google Scholar). A DNA sequencer (ABI PRISMTM 310) and a DNA sequencing kit (dRhodemine terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction) (Perkin-Elmer) were used. [methyl-14C]TMG (60 mCi/mmol) was purchased from NEN Life Science Products or American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc. [α-32P]CTP was from ICN Inc. All other chemicals were reagent grade and obtained from commercial sources. The melibiose transport system is the sole uptake system for melibiose (and TMG) in E. coli W3133 and W3133-2 (9Lopilato J. Tsuchiya T. Wilson T.H. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 147-156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). W3133 cells were unable to grow on melibiose at 37 °C or above, although cells were able to grow on other carbon sources such as glucose or amino acid mixtures at 42 °C. However, W3133-2 cells were able to grow on melibiose at 42 °C (data not shown). As reported previously (9Lopilato J. Tsuchiya T. Wilson T.H. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 147-156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), both types of cells grew well on melibiose at 30 °C. W3133 cells were able to grow on melibiose at 35 °C. However, 37 °C is an unreliable temperature for the measurement of growth of W3133 cells on melibiose. On some occasions the cells grew and at other occasions they did not. W3133 cells were unable to grow on melibiose at 40 °C. Thus, 40 °C instead of 37 °C is a convenient temperature for investigation of the temperature sensitivity and resistance of the melibiose utilization system of W3133 and W3133-2. Fig. 1 shows that activity of the melibiose transporter (TMG uptake) in W3133 cells was very low when cells were grown at 37 °C or above. Although the activity was fairly high when cells were grown at 30 °C. The activity of the melibiose transporter in W3133-2 was high when cells were grown at 30–34 °C, moderate when grown at 37–40 °C, and very low when grown at 42 °C. These results suggest that the melibiose transporter in W3133-2 cells are still temperature-sensitive to a certain extent. To compare temperature sensitivity of the melibiose transporter between W3133 cells and W3133-2 cells, we tested the effect of temperature on activity of the melibiose transporter. Fig. 2 shows decay lines of TMG transport activity when cells were incubated at 30, 37, or 40 °C. Surprisingly, W3133 cells and W3133-2 cells showed the same decay lines at 37 °C. The half-life of the melibiose transport activity in the two strains was exactly the same, 35 min. This half-life is very similar to that we reported previously with another strain (GN22) derived from K12 (8Tsuchiya T. Lopilato J. Wilson T.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1978; 42: 45-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). When cells were incubated at 40 °C, again the activity decay lines were not distinguishable between W3133 and W3133-2. The half-life was 17 min. We also tested heat inactivation at 42 °C and obtained very similar decay profiles to that obtained at 40 °C in both strains (data not shown). No decrease of the transport activity was observed with both W3133 and W3133-2 when cells were incubated at 30 °C (Fig. 2). Thus, it became clear that there is no difference in the temperature sensitivity of the melibiose transport protein between W3133 cells and W3133-2 cells. Previously we reported the nucleotide sequence of the melBgene and the deduced amino acid sequence of the melibiose transporter (10Yazyu H. Shiota-Niiya S. Shimamoto T. Kanazawa H. Futai M. Tsuchiya T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4320-4326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it became possible to identify substitution of amino acid residue(s) in the melibiose transporter in mutant cells. We cloned and sequenced the melB gene from W3133 and from W3133-2 and found that there was no difference in the nucleotide sequence in theirmelB structural genes.2 Thus, we conclude that the primary structure of the melibiose transport protein in the two strains is identical. Thus, the question arose why W3133-2 cells, but not W3133 cells, were able to utilize melibiose at 40 or 42 °C. As we reported previously, the W3133-2 cells showed partially constitutive expression of the melibiose operon, although expression in the parental W3133 cells was completely inducible (9Lopilato J. Tsuchiya T. Wilson T.H. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 147-156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This indicates that there is a difference in the expression of the operon between the parent and the mutant, and suggests that the reason for temperature sensitivity is the expression of the melibiose operon. We therefore tested the effect of temperature on gene expression of the melibiose operon with the two strains. We have shown previously that α-galactosidase of E. coli was not temperature-sensitive (8Tsuchiya T. Lopilato J. Wilson T.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1978; 42: 45-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus, the level of α-galactosidase activity reflects the level of expression of the melibiose operon. We measured α-galactosidase activity in cells grown at various temperatures. In the experiments, melibiose was added to the growth medium to fully induce the operon. The α-galactosidase activity in W3133 cells grown at 30 °C was high, moderate in cells grown at 37 °C, and very low in cells grown at 40 or 42 °C (Fig. 3). The activity in W3133-2 cells was much higher than that in W3133 cells (Fig. 3). The enzyme activity in W3133-2 cells was very high even if cells were grown at 40 or 42 °C. These results support the idea that expression of the melibiose operon in W3133 cells is temperature-sensitive while that in W3133-2 cells is not. We tested this possibility by Northern blot analysis. The probe used was a BamHI fragment derived from the melB gene, which is located downstream from the melA gene (3Hanatani M. Yazyu H. Shiota-Niiya S. Moriyama Y. Kanazawa H. Futai M. Tsuchiya T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1807-1812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Yazyu H. Shiota-Niiya S. Shimamoto T. Kanazawa H. Futai M. Tsuchiya T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4320-4326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore the mRNA detected in our assay is melABmRNA (19Shimamoto T. Noguchi K. Kuroda M. Tsuda M. Tsuchiya T. J. Biochem. 1994; 115: 1185-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The mRNA level in W3133-2 cells induced with melibiose was about two times higher than that in W3133 cells when grown at 30 °C (Fig. 4). The ratio of the mRNA level in W3133-2 cells to that of W3133-2 cells grown at 30 °C was comparable to the ratio of the α-galactosidase activity of these cells (Table I). The levels of mRNA in both W3133-2 and W3133 increased when cells were grown at 37 °C, and the level in W3133-2 was 2.7 times higher than that in W3133. As expected, we detected a faint band of the melABmRNA with W3133 cells grown at 40 °C, although a dense band was detected with W3133-2 cells (Fig. 4). The mRNA level in W3133-2 cells was 7.9 times higher than that in W3133 cells. A very low level of melAB mRNA was detected in W3133 cells grown at 42 °C, but a considerable level of the mRNA was detected in W3133-2 cells. The ratio of the mRNA level in W3133-2 cells to that of W3133 cells is comparable to the ratio of the α-galactosidase activity in these cells for all temperatures tested except at 42 °C (Table I). The experiments were repeated four times and very similar results were obtained. Thus, levels of α-galactosidase activity accurately reflect the levels of melAB mRNA at 30–40 °C. The reason why the mRNA level is very low at 42 °C irrespective of the relatively high α-galactosidase activity is not yet clear. In any case, our results indicate that expression of the melibiose operon in W3133 cells is temperature-sensitive while that in W3133-2 cells is fairly temperature-resistant.Table IRatios of gene expression between W3133 and W3133-2 at various temperaturesTemperaturesRatiosaRatios were calculated from data from Figs. 3 and 4.

Open table in a new tab The temperature-sensitive expression of the melibiose operon in W3133 cells and the temperature-resistant expression in W3133-2 cells suggested that mutation(s) may be present in the regulatory gene (melR) for the operon or in the promoter region of themelAB genes. We cloned the entire melibiose operon from both W3133 and W3133-2 cells. Plasmids carrying the melibiose operon were introduced into cells of E. coli DW1, which contains a deletion through the melA and melB genes (11Wilson D.M. Wilson T.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 904: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The melAB mRNA was not detected with uninduced cells of DW1 harboring the plasmid pBM3133 carrying the melibiose operon from W3133 (Fig. 5). However, we detected dense band of melAB mRNA with uninduced DW1 cells harboring a plasmid pBM3133-2 carrying the melibiose operon from W3133-2 (Fig. 5). A faint mRNA band was detected in DW1/pBM3133 cells induced with melibiose at 40 °C and a more dense band was detected with melibiose-induced cells of DW1/pBM3133-2 (Fig. 5). Thus, mutation(s) responsible for the temperature-resistant expression of the melibiose operon in W3133-2 must be present in the cloned region. Again, the melibiose operon derived from W3133-2 was partially constitutive. Therefore mutation(s) responsible for the partial constitutive phenotype must be also in the cloned region. We sequenced the entire melibiose region. We found no difference in the nucleotide sequence of the melR coding region, in the promoter region for the melR gene, and in themelA to melB region. Instead, we found a replacement of 5 consecutive nucleotides in the promoter region for themelAB genes (Fig. 6). The transcription initiation site for the melAB genes in Fig. 6has been reported (5Webster C. Kaempsell K. Booth I. Busby S. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 59: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The translation initiation site for themelA gene was confirmed by amino acid sequencing of the NH2 terminus of purified α-galactosidase (20Nagao Y. Nakada T. Imoto M. Shimamoto T. Sakai S. Tsuda M. Tsuchiya T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 151: 236-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The sequence of the melAB promoter region from W3133 was identical with that from E. coli CS520 (3Hanatani M. Yazyu H. Shiota-Niiya S. Moriyama Y. Kanazawa H. Futai M. Tsuchiya T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1807-1812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Clarke L. Carbon J. Cell. 1976; 9: 91-99Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar), a derivative of K12, of which we were the first to report the promoter region sequence (22Shimamoto T. Yazyu H. Futai M. Tsuchiya T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 121: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). There is one long inverted repeat and several short inverted repeats in the promoter region (22Shimamoto T. Yazyu H. Futai M. Tsuchiya T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 121: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The replacement is immediately downstream from the long inverted repeat which has been reported as one of the binding sites for MelR (23Williams J. Michan C. Webster C. Busby S. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 757-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 24Keen J. Williams J. Busby S. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and lies between the long inverted repeat and the short inverted repeat (Fig. 6). The cause of the temperature sensitivity of the melibiose utilization system in E. coli K12 and its derivatives has long been thought to be that the melibiose transporter is temperature-sensitive (4Prestidge L.S. Pardee A.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 100: 591-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 8Tsuchiya T. Lopilato J. Wilson T.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1978; 42: 45-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 9Lopilato J. Tsuchiya T. Wilson T.H. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 147-156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that expression of the melibiose operon, in addition to the melibiose transporter, in E. coli W3133 (a derivative of K12) was temperature-sensitive. We identified a replacement of 5 consecutive nucleotides in the promoter region of the melibiose operon from the mutant strain. The 5 replaced nucleotides were located just between a long inverted repeat (18 nucleotides) and the following a short inverted repeat (5 nucleotides). In short, the replacement resulted in appearance of a huge inverted repeat (28 nucleotides). It has been reported that the original long inverted repeat is the site for binding of MelR (23Williams J. Michan C. Webster C. Busby S. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 757-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 24Keen J. Williams J. Busby S. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that complex of MelR and melibiose (an inducer) can bind to the huge inverted repeat region even if the temperature is 40–42 °C. On the other hand, perhaps the MelR-inducer complex is unable to bind to the original inverted repeat (18 nucleotides repeat) at such high temperatures, although the complex can bind at lower temperature such as 30 °C. Although it is not clear whether the stem-loop structure of DNA is really formed in vivo, a stem structure formed with a 28-nucleotide repeat would be more stable than that formed with a 18-nucleotide repeat at 40 or 42 °C. Also it may be possible that the 18-nucleotide inverted repeat forms a stem structure at 30 °C but not at 40 °C. Although we do not have direct evidence forin vivo formation of the stem-loop structure, our results are consistent with the idea that MelR binds to the hypothetical stem structure and formation of the stem structure is temperature-sensitive. In any case, the temperature sensitivity and resistance of gene expression due to the alteration of the structure (sequence) in the promoter region of the melibiose operon of E. coli (but not due to the regulatory protein) is a very unique case. Usually protein is responsible for temperature-sensitive cellular processes (25Alberts B. Bray D. Lewis J. Raff M. Roberts K. Watson J.D. Molecular Biology of the Cell. Garland Publishing Inc., New York1983: 611-671Google Scholar). The melibiose operon in the parental W3133 cells or other K12-derived cells is inducible. An inducer such as melibiose is necessary for this induction (4Prestidge L.S. Pardee A.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 100: 591-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The melibiose operon in the mutant W3133-2 cells, however, is partially constitutive (9Lopilato J. Tsuchiya T. Wilson T.H. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 147-156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it seems that the MelR can bind to the 28-nucleotide inverted repeat structure, but not to the 18-nucleotide inverted repeat structure, to some extent without the inducer. In the presence of inducer, perhaps the MelR-inducer complex can bind to the longer inverted repeat easily in W3133-2 cells and perhaps transcription increases even at 30 °C compared with W3133 cells. Therefore, it seems likely that the induction level in W3133-2 cells is higher than that in W3133 cells. The melibiose transport proteins in both W3133 and W3133-2 cells are equally temperature-sensitive (equally inactivated at 40 °C). Nevertheless, cells of W3133-2 are able to grow on melibiose at 40 °C and cells of W3133 are not. One possible explanation for this is as follows. Perhaps the rate of production of the melibiose transporter exceeds the rate of inactivation of the protein in W3133-2 cells at 40 °C. The efficient production of the melibiose transporter protein would be due to elevated mRNA synthesis in this strain. On the other hand, the rate of the protein inactivation exceeds the rate of the protein production in W3133 cells at 40 °C. The half-lives of the melibiose transporter inactivation rates were 35 min at 37 °C and 17 min at 40 °C. Thus, the production rate of the melibiose transport protein must exceed the inactivation rate for cells to grow on melibiose at such temperatures. We thank Dr. Manuel F. Varela of Eastern New Mexico University for critically reading the manuscript."
