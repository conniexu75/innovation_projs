https://openalex.org/W2961217357,"Diverse genetic, epigenetic, and developmental programs drive glioblastoma, an incurable and poorly understood tumor, but their precise characterization remains challenging. Here, we use an integrative approach spanning single-cell RNA-sequencing of 28 tumors, bulk genetic and expression analysis of 401 specimens from the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), functional approaches, and single-cell lineage tracing to derive a unified model of cellular states and genetic diversity in glioblastoma. We find that malignant cells in glioblastoma exist in four main cellular states that recapitulate distinct neural cell types, are influenced by the tumor microenvironment, and exhibit plasticity. The relative frequency of cells in each state varies between glioblastoma samples and is influenced by copy number amplifications of the CDK4, EGFR, and PDGFRA loci and by mutations in the NF1 locus, which each favor a defined state. Our work provides a blueprint for glioblastoma, integrating the malignant cell programs, their plasticity, and their modulation by genetic drivers."

Here, we performed a bacterial transposon screen and identified a T3SS effector SopF that potently blocked Salmonella autophagy. SopF was a general xenophagy inhibitor without affecting canonical autophagy. S. Typhimurium ΔsopF resembled S. flexneri ΔvirAΔicsB with the majority of intracellular bacteria targeted by autophagy, permitting a CRISPR screen that identified host V-ATPase as an essential factor. Upon bacteria-caused vacuolar damage, the V-ATPase recruited ATG16L1 onto bacteria-containing vacuole, which was blocked by SopF. Mammalian ATG16L1 bears a WD40 domain required for interacting with the V-ATPase. Inhibiting autophagy by SopF promoted S. Typhimurium proliferation in vivo. SopF targeted Gln124 of ATP6V0C in the V-ATPase for ADP-ribosylation. Mutation of Gln124 also blocked xenophagy, but not canonical autophagy. Thus, the discovery of SopF reveals the V-ATPase-ATG16L1 axis that critically mediates autophagic recognition of intracellular pathogen.

Autophagy is a catabolic process for lysosomal degradation of cytosolic components in eukaryotes. More than 30 autophagy-related (ATG) genes are identified, and most of them are conserved from yeast to mammals (Kuballa et al., 2012Kuballa P. Nolte W.M. Castoreno A.B. Xavier R.J. Autophagy and the immune system.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2012; 30: 611-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Among the ATGs, microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3, i.e., Atg8 in yeast), critical for autophagosome membrane formation, is commonly used as an autophagy marker (Klionsky et al., 2016Klionsky D.J. Abdelmohsen K. Abe A. Abedin M.J. Abeliovich H. Acevedo Arozena A. Adachi H. Adams C.M. Adams P.D. Adeli K. et al.Guidelines for the use and interpretation of assays for monitoring autophagy (3rd edition).Autophagy. 2016; 12: 1-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (3982) Google Scholar). In autophagy, cytoplasmic LC3 (LC3-I) is modified at its C-terminal glycine with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (LC3-II) by one of the two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems encoded by the ATGs (Kabeya et al., 2000Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. LC3, a mammalian homologue of yeast Apg8p, is localized in autophagosome membranes after processing.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5433) Google Scholar). Canonical autophagy senses nutrient deprivation and acts in a non-selective manner. Selective autophagy targets specific cargos, such as damaged organelles, protein aggregates, and intracellular pathogens (Svenning and Johansen, 2013Svenning S. Johansen T. Selective autophagy.Essays Biochem. 2013; 55: 79-92Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Autophagy induced by invading pathogens, termed xenophagy (Bauckman et al., 2015Bauckman K.A. Owusu-Boaitey N. Mysorekar I.U. Selective autophagy: xenophagy.Methods. 2015; 75: 120-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), is first noted with group A Streptococcus (GAS) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis variant bovis BCG by virtue of their residing in the LC3-decorated compartments (Gutierrez et al., 2004Gutierrez M.G.

Many other bacteria, including Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium), Shigella flexneri, Burkholderia pseudomallei, and Listeria monocytogenes, are also targeted by autophagy (Birmingham et al., 2006Birmingham C.L. Smith A.C. Bakowski M.A. Yoshimori T.

Autophagy limits Listeria monocytogenes intracellular growth in the early phase of primary infection.Autophagy. 2007; 3: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Consistent with xenophagy being an important host defense per se, bacterial pathogen has evolved strategies to escape from or paralyze the autophagy system (Huang and Brumell, 2014Huang J. Brumell J.H. Bacteria-autophagy interplay: a battle for survival.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2014; 12: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). For example, Legionella pneumophila uses a type IV secretion system effector RavZ to cleave PE-modified LC3 (Choy et al., 2012Choy A. Dancourt J. Mugo B. O’Connor T.J. Isberg R.R. Melia T.J. Roy C.R. The Legionella effector RavZ inhibits host autophagy through irreversible Atg8 deconjugation.Science. 2012; 338: 1072-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). S. flexneri encode two type III secretion system (T3SS) effectors, VirA and IcsB, that counteract autophagic recognition indirectly by interfering with host membrane trafficking or modulating endosomal escape of S. flexneri (Dong et al., 2012Dong N. Zhu Y. Lu Q. Hu L. Zheng Y. Shao F.

Microbiol. 2018; 3: 996-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). How does autophagy recognize invading bacteria? A prevailing view is that a group of adaptors like NDP52, p62, and OPTN, featuring an LC3-interacting motif and a ubiquitin-binding domain, recruit the autophagy machinery to intracellular bacteria (Huang and Brumell, 2014Huang J. Brumell J.H. Bacteria-autophagy interplay: a battle for survival.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2014; 12: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, Stolz et al., 2014Stolz A. Ernst A. Dikic I. Cargo recognition and trafficking in selective autophagy.Nat. Cell Biol. 2014; 16: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). In this model, ubiquitin-coated bacteria are recognized by the adaptors for being targeted by LC3-marked autophagosomes (Mostowy et al., 2011Mostowy S. Sancho-Shimizu V. Hamon M.A. Simeone R. Brosch R. Johansen T. Cossart P. p62 and NDP52 proteins target intracytosolic Shigella and Listeria to different autophagy pathways.J. Biol.

Immunol. 2009; 183: 5909-5916Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Another school of thought suggests that bacteria-residing vacuoles or damaged vacuolar membranes are targeted by the adaptors (Fujita et al., 2013Fujita N. Morita E. Itoh T. Tanaka A. Nakaoka M. Osada Y. Umemoto T. Saitoh T. Nakatogawa H. Kobayashi S. et al.Recruitment of the autophagic machinery to endosomes during infection is mediated by ubiquitin.J. Cell Biol. 2013; 203: 115-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, Thurston et al., 2012Thurston T.L. Wandel M.P. von Muhlinen N. Foeglein A. Randow F. Galectin 8 targets damaged vesicles for autophagy to defend cells against bacterial invasion.Nature. 2012; 482: 414-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). However, neither the ubiquitinated proteins (on the bacteria or vacuolar membrane) nor the responsible ubiquitin ligase are established. Some studies show that LC3 is dispensable for recruiting certain ATGs to the bacteria, and targeting LC3 to autophagosome membrane is determined by the ATG16L1 complex (Fujita et al., 2008Fujita N. Itoh T. Omori H. Fukuda M. Noda T. Yoshimori T. The Atg16L complex specifies the site of LC3 lipidation for membrane biogenesis in autophagy.Mol. Biol.

The LC3 recruitment mechanism is separate from Atg9L1-dependent membrane formation in the autophagic response against Salmonella.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2011; 22: 2290-2300Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). These understandings are largely obtained in the S. Typhimurium model. However, only about 20% intracellular S. Typhimurium is decorated with LC3 within 1 h of infection, which declines to 5%–10% after 2 h of infection (Birmingham et al., 2006Birmingham C.L. Smith A.C. Bakowski M.A. Yoshimori T. Brumell J.H. Autophagy controls Salmonella infection in response to damage to the Salmonella-containing vacuole.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 11374-11383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). The reason why only a small fraction of wild-type (WT) S. Typhimurium is targeted by autophagy is unclear, and this narrow assay window prevents thorough elucidation of the mechanism underlying autophagic recognition of intracellular bacteria. Here, we identified a Salmonella T3SS effector, SopF, that potently blocked bacterial autophagy. Removal of sopF from S. Typhimurium led to about 80% intracellular bacteria being targeted by autophagy. We identified the V-ATPase-ATG16L1 axis that initiated xenophagy upon bacteria-induced vacuolar damage. SopF specifically ADP-ribosylated Gln124 of ATP6V0C in the V-ATPase to block its recruiting of ATG16L1. Our findings suggest that the V-ATPase-ATG16L1 axis critically mediates autophagic recognition of intracellular pathogen. We explored whether an unbiased genetic screen could provide insights into the weak autophagy induced by S. Typhimurium—only ∼10% of S. Typhimurium was targeted by EGFP-LC3B (hereafter GFP-LC3) at 2 h after infection in HeLa cells (Figures 1A and 1B ). The Himar1 transposon that showed expected random genomic insertions (Figure S1A) (Lampe et al., 1998Lampe D.J. Grant T.E. Robertson H.M. Factors affecting transposition of the Himar1 mariner transposon in vitro.Genetics. 1998; 149: 179-187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to generate a mutant library of S. Typhimurium. Each mutant was used to infect 293A cells stably expressing GFP-LC3, and fluorescent cell images recorded at 2 h post infection were visually screened for evidently increased bacterial autophagy (relative to WT bacteria). Out of 23,000 mutants screened, only one mutant (366-C7) (Figure S1B) showed increased GFP-LC3 decoration to about 80% (Figures 1A and 1B). LC3-II level in 366-C7-infected cells, compared to that in WT S. Typhimurium-infected cells, also markedly increased (Figure 1C). The transposon in 366-C7 was inserted into SL1344_1177 encoding a 374-residue protein with no recognizable domain (Figure 1D). While our study was progressing, a quantitative secretome profiling also identified this protein and named SopF (Cheng et al., 2017Cheng S. Wang L. Liu Q. Qi L. Yu K. Wang Z. Wu M. Liu Y. Fu J.

Proteomics. 2017; 16: 2219-2228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Expression of sopF in 366-C7 reversed the levels of GFP-LC3 decoration and LC3-II to those in WT S. Typhimurium-infected cells (Figures 1A–1C). ΔsopF recapitulated the phenotype of 366-C7 (Figures 1A–1C). SopF also blocked the recruitment of other LC3B paralogs, including LC3A, LC3C, and GABARAP (Figure S1C).Figure S1Transposon Screen Identifies S.

Chem. 2006; 281: 11374-11383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar), about 20% of WT S. Typhimurium were decorated with GFP-LC3 within 40 min of infection, which then decreased to the basal level (Figures 1E and S1D). ΔsopF increased GFP-LC3 decoration to about 60% at 20 min post infection, which rose to about 80% at 60 min and remained stable afterward for at least 3 h. Overexpression of SopF in ΔsopF abolished the autophagic response over the period of observation (Figures 1E and S1D). SopF inhibition of bacterial autophagy was also observed in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (Figure S1E), in which overexpression of SopF only reduced the level of GFP-LC3 decoration to 20%, suggesting an auxiliary SopF-insensitive pathway in MEFs. SopF is conserved in different Salmonella species/subspecies including S. enterica serovar Typhi and S. bongori. We noticed a partial sopF sequence (premature stop after residue 108) in S. enterica subsp. arizonae, an inhabitant of reptiles with occasional infections in human (Figure S1F). Interestingly, infecting HeLa cells with S. arizonae, compared with S. Typhimurium, caused much stronger autophagy, which was blocked by ectopic expression of SopF (Figure S1F). As introduced earlier, S. flexneri ΔvirAΔicsB induced robust autophagy due to loss of the two inhibitory effectors (Campbell-Valois et al., 2015Campbell-Valois F.X. Sachse M. Sansonetti P.J. Parsot C. Escape of Actively Secreting Shigella flexneri from ATG8/LC3-Positive Vacuoles Formed during Cell-To-Cell Spread Is Facilitated by IcsB and VirA.MBio. 2015; 6Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and we found that expression of SopF in S. flexneri ΔvirAΔicsB also blocked GFP-LC3 decoration of the bacteria (Figure S1G). S. Typhimurium has two T3SSs, encoded by the Salmonella pathogenicity islands 1 and 2 (SPI-1 and -2), that inject dozens of effectors into host cells to facilitate bacterial invasion and survival in the host (LaRock et al., 2015LaRock D.L. Chaudhary A. Miller S.I. Salmonellae interactions with host processes.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2015; 13: 191-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The recent study suggests that SopF is secreted into host cells by the T3SS (Cheng et al., 2017Cheng S. Wang L. Liu Q. Qi L. Yu K. Wang Z. Wu M. Liu Y. Fu J. Hu M. et al.Identification of a Novel Salmonella Type III Effector by Quantitative Secretome Profiling.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2017; 16: 2219-2228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Using the TEM1 (β-lactamase) translocation assay (Charpentier and Oswald, 2004Charpentier X. Oswald E. Identification of the secretion and translocation domain of the enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli effector Cif, using TEM-1 beta-lactamase as a new fluorescence-based reporter.J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5486-5495Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), we found that the SopF-TEM1 fusion protein was efficiently secreted into HeLa cells from WT S. Typhimurium and its SPI-2-deficient ΔsseB mutant, but not the SPI-1-deficient ΔsipD strain (Figure 1F). We then examined the localization of SPI-1-delivered SopF using the signal-amplified SunTag imaging assay (Li et al., 2017Li P. Jiang W. Yu Q. Liu W. Zhou P. Li J. Xu J. Xu B. Wang F. Shao F. Ubiquitination and degradation of GBPs by a Shigella effector to suppress host defence.Nature. 2017; 551: 378-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, Tanenbaum et al., 2014Tanenbaum M.E.

A protein-tagging system for signal amplification in gene expression and fluorescence imaging.Cell. 2014; 159: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). GFP-fused single-chain anti-SunTag antibody (scFv-GCN4-GFP) was diffused in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus of uninfected cells, or cells infected with S. Typhimurium harboring a non-tagged SopF, but depleted from the nucleus upon infection with S. Typhimurium expressing 24× SunTag-fused SopF (Figure 1G). This shows a cytoplasmic localization of SopF in infected host cells. We found that the presence or absence of sopF had little effect on the number of S. Typhimurium recovered after 1 h of infection in HeLa cells (Figure S2A), suggesting that SopF is not involved in Salmonella entry into host cells. Following invasion, the S. Typhimurium-residing vacuole sequentially becomes positive for the early endosome marker Rab5, the late endosome marker Rab7, and the lysosome marker LAMP2. At the late stage, a faction of the vacuoles is labeled by the damaged-endosome marker Galectin-3 (Gal3). The vacuole also recruits the interferon-induced guanylate binding protein 1 (GBP1) and is decorated with ubiquitin or ubiquitin chains. Despite careful examinations, we observed no differences in Rab5, Rab7, LAMP2, Gal3, GBP1, and ubiquitin labeling of sopF-positive and sopF-negative S. Typhimurium in infected HeLa cells (Figures S2B and S2C). Thus, SopF does not affect the trafficking, damage, and ubiquitin coating, as well as the maturation, of Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCVs). Supporting this, localization of SCV-associated T3SS effectors, including SopB (Patel et al., 2009Patel J.C. Hueffer K. Lam T.T. Galán J.E. Diversification of a Salmonella virulence protein function by ubiquitin-dependent differential localization.Cell. 2009; 137: 283-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), SopD2 (Schroeder et al., 2010Schroeder N. Henry T. de Chastellier C. Zhao W. Guilhon A.A. Gorvel J.P. Méresse S.

Microbiol. 2016; 18: 949-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), was unaffected by deletion of sopF from the bacteria (Figures S2D and S2E). NDP52 plays a role in WT S. Typhimurium-induced autophagy (Thurston et al., 2009Thurston T.L. Ryzhakov G. Bloor S. von Muhlinen N. Randow F. The TBK1 adaptor and autophagy receptor NDP52 restricts the proliferation of ubiquitin-coated bacteria.Nat.

Typhimurium ΔsopF, as well as S. flexneri ΔvirAΔicsB, showed a similar level of GFP-LC3 decoration in NDP52 (CALCOCO2)-deficient and proficient cells (Figure S2F). Consistent with its action as an effector, expression of SopF in 293A cells blocked GFP-LC3 decoration of S. Typhimurium ΔsopF or S. flexneri ΔvirAΔicsB (Figures 2A and 2B ). Autophagy induced by other bacteria, including L. monocytogenes, B. thailandensis ΔbopA, and Yersinia enterocolitica ΔHOPEM (devoid of five T3SS effectors), was also abolished by ectopically expressed SopF (Figures 2A, 2B, and S3A).

https://openalex.org/W2964016456,"Evolved resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-targeted therapies remains a major clinical challenge. In epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutant non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), failure of EGFR TKIs can result from both genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of acquired drug resistance. Widespread reports of histologic and gene expression changes consistent with an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) have been associated with initially surviving drug-tolerant persister cells, which can seed bona fide genetic mechanisms of resistance to EGFR TKIs. While therapeutic approaches targeting fully resistant cells, such as those harboring an EGFRT790M mutation, have been developed, a clinical strategy for preventing the emergence of persister cells remains elusive. Using mesenchymal cell lines derived from biopsies of patients who progressed on EGFR TKI as surrogates for persister populations, we performed whole-genome CRISPR screening and identified fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) as the top target promoting survival of mesenchymal EGFR mutant cancers. Although numerous previous reports of FGFR signaling contributing to EGFR TKI resistance in vitro exist, the data have not yet been sufficiently compelling to instigate a clinical trial testing this hypothesis, nor has the role of FGFR in promoting the survival of persister cells been elucidated. In this study, we find that combining EGFR and FGFR inhibitors inhibited the survival and expansion of EGFR mutant drug-tolerant cells over long time periods, preventing the development of fully resistant cancers in multiple vitro models and in vivo. These results suggest that dual EGFR and FGFR blockade may be a promising clinical strategy for both preventing and overcoming EMT-associated acquired drug resistance and provide motivation for the clinical study of combined EGFR and FGFR inhibition in EGFR-mutated NSCLCs."
https://openalex.org/W2960539136,"Lightly stroking the lips or gently poking some skin regions can evoke mechanical itch in healthy human subjects. Sensitization of mechanical itch and persistent spontaneous itch are intractable symptoms in chronic itch patients. However, the underlying neural circuits are not well defined. We identified a subpopulation of excitatory interneurons expressing Urocortin 3::Cre (Ucn3+) in the dorsal spinal cord as a central node in the pathway that transmits acute mechanical itch and mechanical itch sensitization as well as persistent spontaneous itch under chronic itch conditions. This population receives peripheral inputs from Toll-like receptor 5-positive (TLR5+) Aβ low-threshold mechanoreceptors and is directly innervated by inhibitory interneurons expressing neuropeptide Y::Cre (NPY+) in the dorsal spinal cord. Reduced synaptic inhibition and increased intrinsic excitability of Ucn3+ neurons lead to chronic itch sensitization. Our study sheds new light on the neural basis of chronic itch and unveils novel avenues for developing mechanism-specific therapeutic advancements."
https://openalex.org/W2963596885,"Popularity of brachycephalic (flat-faced) dog breeds is increasing internationally despite well-documented intrinsic health and welfare problems associated with their conformation. Given this apparent paradox, greater understanding of the expectations and reality for brachycephalic dog owners and factors driving the dog-owner bond are needed. This study reports a large-scale online survey with valid responses from 2168 owners of brachycephalic dogs (Pugs: n = 789, median age of dogs 2.5 years; French Bulldog: n = 741, median age 2.0 years; Bulldogs: n = 638, median age 2.5 years). The most common owner-reported disorders in their dogs were allergies, corneal ulcers, skin fold infections and Brachycephalic Obstructive Airway Syndrome (BOAS). One-fifth (19.9%) of owners reported that their dog had undergone at least one conformation-related surgery, 36.5% of dogs were reported with a problem with heat regulation, and 17.9% with problems breathing. Despite awareness of their dog’s health issues, 70.9% owners considered their dog to be in very good health or the best health possible. Paradoxically, just 6.8% of owners considered their dog to be less healthy than average for their breed. Dog owner-relationships were extremely strong across all three breeds. Emotional closeness to their dog was highest for owners of Pugs, female owners, and owners with no children in the household. Ownership of brachycephalic dog breeds is a complex phenomenon, characterised by extremely strong dog-owner relationships and unrealistic perceptions of good health set against high levels of disease in relatively young dogs. Perceptual errors in owner beliefs appear to exist between brachycephalic owner perspectives of their own dog’s health versus the health of the rest of their breed, which may be fuelled by cognitive dissonance processes. These novel data improve our understanding of the cognitive processes and relationships that facilitate the rising popularity of breeds that paradoxically are affected by high levels of conformation-related morbidity."
https://openalex.org/W2963265488,"Overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) in breast cancer patients is associated with increased incidence of breast cancer brain metastases (BCBM), but the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain unclear. Here, to identify brain-predominant genes critical for the establishment of BCBM, we conducted an in silico screening analysis and identified that increased levels of fatty acid-binding protein 7 (FABP7) correlate with a lower survival and higher incidence of brain metastases in breast cancer patients. We validated these findings using HER2+ BCBM cells compared with parental breast cancer cells. Importantly, through knockdown and overexpression assays, we characterized the role of FABP7 in the BCBM process in vitro and in vivo. Our results uncover a key role of FABP7 in metabolic reprogramming of HER2 + breast cancer cells, supporting a glycolytic phenotype and storage of lipid droplets that enable their adaptation and survival in the brain microenvironment. In addition, FABP7 is shown to be required for upregulation of key metastatic genes and pathways, such as integrins-Src and VEGFA, and for the growth of HER2+ breast cancer cells in the brain microenvironment in vivo. Together, our results support FABP7 as a potential target for the treatment of HER2+ BCBM."
https://openalex.org/W2963740719,"The peptide hormone adropin regulates energy metabolism in skeletal muscle and plays important roles in the regulation of metabolic homeostasis. Besides muscle, the liver has an essential role in regulating glucose homeostasis. Previous studies have reported that treatment of diet-induced obese (DIO) male mice with adropin34–76 (the putative secreted domain) reduces fasting blood glucose independently of body weight changes, suggesting that adropin suppresses glucose production in the liver. Here, we explored the molecular mechanisms underlying adropin’s effects on hepatic glucose metabolism in DIO mice. Male DIO B6 mice maintained on a high-fat diet received five intraperitoneal injections of adropin34–76 (450 nmol/kg/injection) over a 48-h period. We found that adropin34–76 enhances major intracellular signaling activities in the liver that are involved in insulin-mediated regulation of glucose homeostasis. Moreover, treatment with adropin34–76 alleviated endoplasmic reticulum stress responses and reduced activity of c-Jun N-terminal kinase in the liver, explaining the enhanced activities of hepatic insulin signaling pathways observed with adropin34–76 treatment. Furthermore, adropin34–76 suppressed cAMP activated protein kinase A (PKA) activities, resulting in reduced phosphorylation of inositol trisphosphate receptor, which mediates endoplasmic reticulum calcium efflux, and of cAMP-responsive element–binding protein, a key transcription factor in hepatic regulation of glucose metabolism. Adropin34–76 directly affected liver metabolism, decreasing glucose production and reducing PKA-mediated phosphorylation in primary mouse hepatocytes in vitro.

Among them, obesity-associated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress leads to cellular insulin resistance in part by activating c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), the activation of which plays a prominent role in impairing the insulin intracellular signaling pathway (11.Dara L.

https://openalex.org/W2963587839,"In social contexts, the dynamic nature of others' emotions places unique demands on attention and emotion regulation. Mindfulness, characterized by heightened and receptive moment-to-moment attending, may be well-suited to meet these demands. In particular, mindfulness may support more effective cognitive control in social situations via efficient deployment of top-down attention. To test this, a randomized controlled study examined effects of mindfulness training (MT) on behavioral and neural (event-related potentials [ERPs]) responses during an emotional go/no-go task that tested cognitive control in the context of emotional facial expressions that tend to elicit approach or avoidance behavior. Participants (N = 66) were randomly assigned to four brief (20 min) MT sessions or to structurally equivalent book learning control sessions. Relative to the control group, MT led to improved discrimination of facial expressions, as indexed by d-prime, as well as more efficient cognitive control, as indexed by response time and accuracy, and particularly for those evidencing poorer discrimination and cognitive control at baseline. MT also produced better conflict monitoring of behavioral goal-prepotent response tendencies, as indexed by larger No-Go N200 ERP amplitudes, and particularly so for those with smaller No-Go amplitude at baseline. Overall, findings are consistent with MT's potential to enhance deployment of early top-down attention to better meet the unique cognitive and emotional demands of socioemotional contexts, particularly for those with greater opportunity for change. Findings also suggest that early top-down attention deployment could be a cognitive mechanism correspondent to the present-oriented attention commonly used to explain regulatory benefits of mindfulness more broadly."
https://openalex.org/W2963429680,"The study of regional trends in the rural-urban fertility gradient helps us to understand the pace of completion of the fertility transition and the geography of urban growth in the global South. We question whether the hypothesized inverted U-shaped evolution in rural excess fertility is confirmed in four developing regions, and investigate the underlying fertility dynamics by place of residence. Using multiple surveys for 60 developing countries, we analyze long-term rural and urban trends in cohort fertility. The regional comparison is controlled for the international heterogeneity in the stages attained in the fertility transition and the context of urbanization. We found a clearly inverted U-shaped trend in the rural-urban fertility gradient in Latin America, the Middle East and Northern Africa. In Asia, rural excess fertility remained limited. In sub-Saharan Africa it increased monotonically until the most recent cohorts. These differences stem from variations in the urban-to-rural diffusion of the onset of fertility transition and, in sub-Saharan Africa, from a slower pace of decline in rural areas."
https://openalex.org/W2962935082,"Aims/Hypothesis Early recognition of those at high risk for diabetes as well as diabetes itself can permit preventive management, but many Americans with diabetes are undiagnosed. We sought to determine whether routinely available outpatient random plasma glucose (RPG) would be useful to facilitate the diagnosis of diabetes. Methods Retrospective cohort study of 942,446 U.S. Veterans without diagnosed diabetes, ≥3 RPG in a baseline year, and ≥1 primary care visit/year during 5-year follow-up. The primary outcome was incident diabetes (defined by diagnostic codes and outpatient prescription of a diabetes drug). Results Over 5 years, 94,599 were diagnosed with diabetes [DIAB] while 847,847 were not [NONDIAB]. Baseline demographics of DIAB and NONDIAB were clinically similar, except DIAB had higher BMI (32 vs. 28 kg/m2) and RPG (150 vs. 107 mg/dl), and were more likely to have Black race (18% vs. 15%), all p<0.001. ROC area for prediction of DIAB diagnosis within 1 year by demographic factors was 0.701, and 0.708 with addition of SBP, non-HDL cholesterol, and smoking. These were significantly less than that for prediction by baseline RPG alone (≥2 RPGs at/above a given level, ROC 0.878, p<0.001), which improved slightly when other factors were added (ROC 0.900, p<0.001). Having ≥2 RPGs ≥115 mg/dl had specificity 77% and sensitivity 87%, and ≥2 RPGs ≥130 mg/dl had specificity 93% and sensitivity 59%. For predicting diagnosis within 3 and 5 years by RPG alone, ROC was reduced but remained substantial (ROC 0.839 and 0.803, respectively). Conclusions RPG levels below the diabetes “diagnostic” range (≥200 mg/dl) provide good discrimination for follow-up diagnosis. Use of such levels–obtained opportunistically, during outpatient visits–could signal the need for further testing, allow preventive intervention in high risk individuals before onset of disease, and lead to earlier identification of diabetes."

Previous studies have indicated that GH74 xyloglucanases differ in backbone cleavage regiospecificities and can adopt three distinct hydrolytic modes of action: exo, endo-dissociative, and endo-processive. To improve functional predictions within GH74, here we coupled in-depth biochemical characterization of 17 recombinant proteins with structural biology–based investigations in the context of a comprehensive molecular phylogeny, including all previously characterized family members. Elucidation of four new GH74 tertiary structures, as well as one distantly related dual seven-bladed β-propeller protein from a marine bacterium, highlighted key structure–function relationships along protein evolutionary trajectories. We could define five phylogenetic groups, which delineated the mode of action and the regiospecificity of GH74 members.

Terrestrial plants harbor ∼80% of the biomass on Earth, some 450 gigatons of carbon, in the form of lignocellulose (cell walls comprised of cellulose, matrix glycans, lignin, and other polymers) (1.Bar-On Y.M. Phillips R. Milo R. The biomass distribution on Earth.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2018; 115 (29784790): 6506-651110.1073/pnas.1711842115Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar). Although terrestrial biomass represents an attractive renewable resource for the production of fuels, chemicals, and materials for human consumption, the controlled degradation of lignocellulose, whether (thermo)chemical or enzymatic, is hindered by its heterogeneous composition and complex organization (2.Himmel M.E.

Notably, XyGs are secreted by roots of diverse plant species and are therefore likely to actively influence rhizobiota (5.Galloway A.F. Pedersen M.J. Merry B. Marcus S.E. Blacker J. Benning L.G.

XyGs are also found as storage polysaccharides comprising ∼50% of the mass of some seeds (e.g. tamarind and nasturtium) and therefore represent important agricultural by-products with applications in the food, biomaterial, and medical sectors (6.Mishra A.

XyGs have a β-1,4–linked glucosyl backbone (“G” unit), some of which are decorated with an α-(1,6)-d-xylosyl residue (together comprising an “X” unit; nomenclature according to Ref. 8.Tuomivaara S.T.

Endo-xyloglucanases, which cleave the XyG backbone, are found in glycoside hydrolase (GH) families GH5, GH9, GH12, GH16, GH44, and GH74 (11.Attia M.A. Brumer H.

GH74 is further distinguished from these other poly-specific families by a nearly singular specificity for XyG (13.Lombard V. Golaconda Ramulu H. Drula E. Coutinho P.M. Henrissat B. The carbohydrate-active enzymes database (CAZy) in 2013.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 (24270786): D490-D49510.1093/nar/gkt1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (4138) Google Scholar). The first GH74 enzyme to be biochemically characterized, from Aspergillus aculeatus, was described in 1989 as an “avicelase” (Avicel® is a brand of microcrystalline cellulose) (14.Arai M. Sakamoto R. Murao S. Different action by two avicelases from Aspergillus aculeatus.Agric. Biol. Chem. 1989; 53 (10.1080/00021369.1989.10869470): 1411-1412Google Scholar). As a result, GH74 is sometimes myopically referred to as a cellulase family, and its members are often annotated as such in (meta)genomics studies (15.López-Mondéjar R. Zühlke D. Becher D. Riedel K.

GH74 members present subtle structural variation and modes of action, which have been reviewed recently (41.Matsuzawa T. Yaoi K. GH74 xyloglucanases: structures and modes of activity.Trends Glycosci.

Briefly, backbone hydrolysis can occur either in the middle of the polysaccharide chain (endo-xyloglucanases, EC 3.2.1.151) or at the chain end (exo-xyloglucanases, EC 3.2.1.150). Endo-xyloglucanases can be further delineated into endo-dissociative enzymes, which hydrolyze the backbone and immediately release both new chain ends, and endo-processive enzymes, which perform multiple hydrolytic events, releasing short oligosaccharides before disengaging.

To unify disparate studies on GH74 members and resolve gaps in our current understanding of the distribution of the distinct modes of action in the family, molecular phylogeny was coupled with detailed enzymology to elucidate the substrate specificity, backbone cleavage regiospecificity, and processivity of 17 recombinant GH74 proteins in the present study. The determination of crystal structures of four GH74s and one distantly related dual seven-bladed β-propeller protein, together with analysis of existing GH74 structures, highlighted key structure–activity relationships across this family. Overall, this study refines our understanding of catalysis in GH74 and reveals the evolutionary trajectory of this enzyme family from dissociative toward processive modes of action. A molecular phylogeny using isolated GH74 catalytic modules from the CAZy database (13.Lombard V. Golaconda Ramulu H. Drula E. Coutinho P.M. Henrissat B.

In addition, two proteins (GenBank accession numbers AFV00434 and AFV00474) encoded in the Simiduia agarivorans genome, which are distantly related to GH74 enzymes based on hydrophobic cluster analysis (HCA) (48.Henrissat B.

Thirty candidates were selected across the phylogenetic tree, of which 17 proteins were successfully recombinantly produced and purified (Fig. 1). Proteins were first screened for activity on a range of substrates, including polysaccharides and pNP substrates. The recombinant AFV00434 and AFV00474 proteins from S. agarivorans were not active on the range of substrates tested, including XyG (data not shown). All other recombinant GH74 modules showed a strict preference for tamarind XyG. No endo-mannanase activity toward konjac glucomannan, no endo-xylanase activity toward wheat flour arabinoxylan and beechwood xylan, and no endo-glucanase activity using CM-cellulose were observed. Endo-glucanase activity on HE-cellulose and on barley β-glucan was generally estimated to be less than 1% compared with xyloglucanase activity (data not shown). As such, we did not perform further biochemical characterization on these substrates. Overall, these results, together with previous studies (16.Attia M. Stepper J. Davies G.J. Brumer H.

https://openalex.org/W2963322578,"The classification of high-resolution satellite images is an open research problem for computer vision research community. In last few decades, the Bag of Visual Word (BoVW) model has been used for the classification of satellite images. In BoVW model, an orderless histogram of visual words without any spatial information is used as image signature. The performance of BoVW model suffers due to this orderless nature and addition of spatial clues are reported beneficial for scene and geographical classification of images. Most of the image representations that can compute image spatial information as are not invariant to rotations. A rotation invariant image representation is considered as one of the main requirement for satellite image classification. This paper presents a novel approach that computes the spatial clues for the histograms of BoVW model that is robust to the image rotations. The spatial clues are calculated by computing the histograms of orthogonal vectors. This is achieved by calculating the magnitude of orthogonal vectors between Pairs of Identical Visual Words (PIVW) relative to the geometric center of an image. The comparative analysis is performed with recently proposed research to obtain the best spatial feature representation for the satellite imagery. We evaluated the proposed research for image classification using three standard image benchmarks of remote sensing. The results and comparisons conducted to evaluate this research show that the proposed approach performs better in terms of classification accuracy for a variety of datasets based on satellite images."
https://openalex.org/W2964106507,"Spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) plays a major role in inflammation and in adaptive immune responses and could therefore contribute to the neuroinflammation observed in various neurodegenerative diseases. Indeed, previously we have reported that SYK also regulates β-amyloid (Aβ) production and hyperphosphorylation of Tau protein involved in these diseases. Moreover, SYK hyperactivation occurs in a subset of activated microglia, in dystrophic neurites surrounding Aβ deposits, and in neurons affected by Tau pathology both in individuals with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and in AD mouse models. SYK activation increases Tau phosphorylation and accumulation, suggesting that SYK could be an attractive target for treating AD. However, the mechanism by which SYK affects Tau pathology is not clear. In this study, using cell biology and biochemical approaches, along with immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting, quantitative RT-PCR, and ELISAs, we found that SYK inhibition increases autophagic Tau degradation without impacting Tau production. Using neuron-like SH-SY5Y cells, we demonstrate that SYK acts upstream of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and that pharmacological inhibition or knockdown of SYK decreases mTOR pathway activation and increases autophagic Tau degradation. Interestingly, chronic SYK inhibition in a tauopathy mouse model profoundly reduced Tau accumulation, neuroinflammation, neuronal and synaptic loss, and also reversed defective autophagy. Our results further suggest that the SYK up-regulation observed in the brains of individuals with AD contributes to defective autophagic clearance leading to the accumulation of pathogenic Tau species. These findings further highlight SYK as a therapeutic target for the treatment of tauopathies and other neurodegenerative proteinopathies associated with defective autophagic clearance.

https://openalex.org/W2963476908,"The effect of stroke topography on the recovery of hemiparetic upper limb (HUL) function is unclear due to limitations in previous studies–examination of lesion effects only in one point of time, or grouping together patients with left and right hemispheric damage (LHD, RHD), or disregard to different lesion impact on proximal and distal operations. Here we used voxel-based lesion symptom mapping (VLSM) to investigate the impact of stroke topography on HUL function taking into consideration the effects of (a) assessment time (subacute, chronic phases), (b) side of damaged hemisphere (left, right), (c) HUL part (proximal, distal). HUL function was examined in 3 groups of patients—Subacute (n = 130), Chronic (n = 66), and Delta (n = 49; patients examined both in the subacute and chronic phases)–using the proximal and distal sub-divisions of the Fugl-Meyer (FM) and the Box and Blocks (B&B) tests. HUL function following LHD tended to be affected in the subacute phase mainly by damage to white matter tracts, the putamen and the insula. In the chronic phase, a similar pattern was shown for B&B performance, whereas FM performance was affected by damage only to the white matter tracts. HUL function following RHD was affected in both phases, mainly by damage to the basal ganglia, white matter tracts and the insula, along with a restricted effect of damage to other cortical structures. In the chronic phase HUL function following RHD was affected also by damage to the thalamus. In the small Delta groups the following trends were found: In LHD patients, delayed motor recovery, captured by the B&B test, was affected by damage to the sensory-motor cortex, white matter association fibers and parts of the perisilvian cortex. In the RHD patients of the Delta group, delayed motor recovery was affected by damage to white matter projection fibers. Proximal and distal HUL functions examined in LHD patients (both in the subacute and chronic phases) tended to be affected by similar structures—mainly white matter projection tracts. In RHD patients, a distinction between proximal and distal HUL functions was found in the subacute but not in the chronic phase, with proximal and distal HUL functions affected by similar subcortical and cortical structures, except for an additional impact of damage to the superior temporal cortex and the retro-lenticular internal capsule only on proximal HUL function. The current study suggests the existence of important differences between the functional neuroanatomy underlying motor recovery following left and right hemisphere damage. A trend for different lesion effects was shown for residual proximal and distal HUL motor control. The study corroborates earlier findings showing an effect of the time after stroke onset (subacute, chronic) on the results of VLSM analyses. Further studies with larger sample size are required for the validation of these results."
https://openalex.org/W2963985556,"For understanding the structural characteristics and the proteome of Perna shell, the microstructure, polymorph, and protein composition of the adult Perna viridis shell were investigated. The P. viridis shell have two distinct mineral layers, myostracum and nacre, with the same calcium carbonate polymorph of aragonite, determined by scanning electron microscope, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and x-ray crystalline diffraction. Using Illumina sequencing, the mantle transcriptome of P. viridis was investigated and a total of 69,859 unigenes was generated. Using a combined proteomic/transcriptomic approach, a total of 378 shell proteins from P. viridis shell were identified, in which, 132 shell proteins identified with more than two matched unique peptides. Of the 132 shell proteins, 69 are exclusive to the nacre, 12 to the myostracum, and 51 are shared by both. The Myosin-tail domain containing proteins, Filament-like proteins, and Chitin-binding domain containing proteins represent the most abundant molecules. In addition, the shell matrix proteins (SMPs) containing biomineralization-related domains, such as Kunitz, A2M, WAP, EF-hand, PDZ, VWA, Collagen domain, and low complexity regions with abundant certain amino acids, were also identified from P. viridis shell. Collagenase and chitinase degradation can significantly change the morphology of the shell, indicating the important roles of collagen and chitin in the shell formation and the muscle-shell attachment. Our results present for the first time the proteome of P. viridis shell and increase the knowledge of SMPs in this genus."
https://openalex.org/W2963860959,"Background Hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C (HCV) virus co-infections in HIV are alarming during pregnancy due to the risk of vertical transmission and the eventual adverse effects on neonates. This study was conducted to ascertain the sero-prevalence of HIV/HBV and HIV/HCV co-infections, evaluate the effect of the co-infections on the immunological and virological characteristics and assess the association between some demographic and lifestyle characteristics and risk of HBV, HCV, HIV/HBV and HIV/HCV co-infections among pregnant women living in the Brong-Ahafo Region of Ghana. Methods This comparative cross-sectional study was conducted at the anti-retroviral therapy (ART) clinics of the St. Elizabeth Hospital and the Holy Family Hospital, Brong-Ahafo Region, Ghana. A total of 248 consecutive consenting pregnant Ghanaian women, 148 diagnosed with HIV [HIV (+)] and 100 who were HIV negative [HIV (-)], were recruited. Validated questionnaire was used to obtain demographic and lifestyle data. Venous blood samples were obtained and HCV status, HBV profile, CD4+ T cell count, and HIV-1 RNA load were determined. Results The sero-prevalence of HIV (+) /HBV, HIV (+) /HCV, HIV (-)/HBV, and HIV (-)/HCV infections were 22 (14.9%), 6 (4.1%), 10 (10.0%), and 12 (12.0%) respectively. HIV-1 viral load was not significantly different between HIV/HBV, HIV/HCV co-infection and HIV mono-infection. However, CD4+ T lymphocyte count (364 vs 512 vs 514 cells/μl; p = 0.0009) was significantly lower in HIV/HBV co-infection compared to HIV/HCV and HIV mono-infection respectively. There was no significant association between demographic and lifestyle characteristics and risk of HBV and HCV infections in HIV positive and negative subjects except for late diagnosis of HIV and history of sharing razors blades and pins, where increased odds of HIV (+) /HBV and HIV (-)/HBV infection were observed. Conclusions The prevalence of HIV (+)/HBV (14.9%), HIV (+)/HCV (4.1%), HIV (-)/HBV (10.0%), and HIV (-)/HCV (12.0%) are high among pregnant women in the Brong Ahafo Region of Ghana. HIV/HBV is associated with reduced CD4+ T lymphocyte count but not HIV-1 viral load. Early diagnosis of HIV and intensification of routine antenatal HBV and HCV are essential to abate the risk of maternal to child transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2964228591,"Adiponectin is the most abundant circulating adipokine, and it has insulin-sensitizing and anti-inflammatory properties. Although it has been speculated that kidney function decline associated with elevated adiponectin is attributable to decreased renal clearance and compensatory responses to adiponectin resistance, it is unclear how elevated adiponectin affects clinical outcomes in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients and whether the effects are the same as those in the general population. Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine whether the association between serum adiponectin levels and clinical outcomes in non-diabetic CKD patients is independent of adiposity and metabolic syndrome. We enrolled 196 non-diabetic CKD patients with eGFR ranging between 10 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, these patients were divided into two groups based on the presence of metabolic syndrome. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality or renal events (renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy [RRT] or 50% reduction in eGFR). During the mean follow-up period of 5 years, 48 (24.5%) incident cases of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) were observed, and 33 (16.8%) deaths occurred. The mean eGFR was 29.8 ± 12.8 mL/min/1.73m2. The baseline median adiponectin concentration in the cohort was 29.4(interquartile range, 13.3–108.7) μg/ml. Adiponectin levels were inversely related to body mass index (BMI) (r = −0.29; P < 0.001) and waist circumference (r = −0.35; P < 0.001). In the fully adjusted Cox regression model, the hazard ratios (HRs) were 2.08 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08–4.02; P = 0.03) for RRT and 1.66 (95% CI, 1.03–2.65; P = 0.04) for composite renal outcome. The risks remained consistent within different subgroups. However, no association was observed with mortality risk. In conclusion, higher adiponectin levels are associated with a higher risk of ESRD independent of conventional risk factors, BMI, and metabolic syndrome components."
https://openalex.org/W2964054295,"Tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (WRS) is a cytosolic aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase essential for protein synthesis. WRS is also one of a growing number of intracellular proteins that are attributed distinct noncanonical “moonlighting” functions in the extracellular milieu. Moonlighting aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases regulate processes such as inflammation, but how these multifunctional enzymes are themselves regulated remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that WRS is secreted from human macrophages, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells in response to the proinflammatory cytokine interferon γ (IFNγ). WRS signaled primarily through Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) in macrophages, leading to phosphorylation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB with associated loss of NF-κB inhibitor α (IκB-α) protein. This signaling initiated secretion of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and CXCL8 (IL8) from macrophages. We also demonstrated that WRS is a potent monocyte chemoattractant. Of note, WRS increased matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity in the conditioned medium of macrophages in a TNFα-dependent manner. Using purified recombinant proteins and LC-MS/MS to identify proteolytic cleavage sites, we demonstrated that multiple MMPs, but primarily macrophage MMP7 and neutrophil MMP8, cleave secreted WRS at several sites. Loss of the WHEP domain following cleavage at Met48 generated a WRS proteoform that also results from alternative splicing, designated Δ1–47 WRS. The MMP-cleaved WRS lacked TLR signaling and proinflammatory activities. Thus, our results suggest that moonlighting WRS promotes IFNγ proinflammatory activities, and these responses can be dampened by MMPs.

Here, we report the effects of IFNγ on WRS expression and secretion from macrophages as well as proteolytic processing of WRS by MMPs. We describe how cleavage of the N terminus of WRS to the Δ1–47 WRS proteoform by MMP7 and MMP8 abrogates its proinflammatory functions, aligning with other well-documented anti-inflammatory activities of MMPs. To investigate potential inflammatory roles of WRS, we profiled the secretion of WRS in response to cytokine stimulation of macrophages. THP1 monocytes were differentiated to a macrophage-like phenotype (THP1 M0) using phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). After treatment with IFNγ (20 ng/ml), TNFα (40 ng/ml), or IL4 (40 ng/ml), we collected cytosolic, membrane, and conditioned medium fractions. Immunoblot analysis using antibodies recognizing the N or C terminus of WRS (αN-WRS and αC-WRS, respectively) showed that only the proinflammatory IFNγ increased cytosolic WRS levels (N = 3; Fig. 1A). IFNγ also increased WRS in the cell membrane and conditioned medium fractions, indicating that WRS translocated to the plasma membrane and was secreted to the medium upon IFNγ stimulation and M1 macrophage polarization (Fig. 1A). Several lower-molecular-weight proteoforms of WRS were identified in the cytosol and conditioned medium following IFNγ stimulation. Predominant detection by the αC-WRS antibody revealed that these were N-terminally truncated. The effect on WRS was IFNγ-selective as neither IL4, TNFα (Fig. 1A), IFNα, nor IFNβ (N = 3; Fig. S1A) had any effect on WRS protein levels or secretion. The absence of tubulin in the conditioned media supported secretion of WRS rather than cell lysis, and the absence of the plasma membrane protein Na+/K+-ATPase in the cytosolic fractions confirmed the fidelity of cell fractionation. We isolated human monocytes from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of three healthy human subjects. Monocytes were differentiated into primary M0 macrophages using monocyte colony-stimulating factor and then cultured with IFNγ (20 ng/ml) or IL4 (40 ng/ml) to induce polarization to proinflammatory M1- or M2-type macrophages, respectively. Polarization was confirmed using the M1 marker indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase and M2 marker transglutaminase 2 (Fig. 1B). Immunoblot analysis of cell lysates showed that, as with the THP1-derived macrophages, full-length WRS and additional smaller WRS proteoforms were markedly increased only in response to IFNγ. This included a form migrating like Δ1–47 WRS that was only detected by the αC-WRS antibody. Again, the absence of tubulin in the conditioned culture medium confirmed that there was little, if any, nonspecific release of cytoplasmic proteins by cell lysis. A time-dependent increase in WRS expression and secretion up to 48 h occurred in response to 20 ng/ml IFNγ in THP1 M0 cells, endothelial cells (N = 3; Fig. 1, C and D), and BJ human skin fibroblasts (N = 2; Fig. 1E), again with no change in tubulin protein. WRS secretion depended on IFNγ concentration, with 10 ng/ml IFNγ inducing maximal WRS secretion (N = 3; Fig. S1B). The secreted proteoforms detected by each antibody were consistent in size among cell types (αN-WRS, ∼41, 39, and 32 kDa; αC-WRS, ∼48 and 36 kDa), a"
https://openalex.org/W2962755356,"Although the biological systems in the human body are affected by the earth’s gravity, information about the underlying molecular mechanisms is limited. For example, apoptotic signaling is enhanced in cancer cells subjected to microgravity. We reasoned that signaling regulated by p53 may be involved because of its role in apoptosis. Therefore, we aimed to clarify the molecular mechanisms of modified cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (CDDP)-sensitivity under simulated microgravity by focusing on p53-related cell death mechanisms. Immunoblotting analyses indicated that, under microgravity, CDDP-induced ATM/p53 signaling increased and caspase-3 was cleaved earlier. However, microgravity decreased the levels of expression of p53 targets BAX and CDKN1A. Interestingly, microgravity increased the PTEN, DRAM1, and PRKAA1 mRNA levels. However, microgravity decreased the levels of mTOR and increased the LC3-II/I ratio, suggesting the activation of autophagy. The CDDP-induced cleavage of caspase-3 was increased during the early phase in Group MG (+), and cleaved caspase-3 was detected even in Group MG (+) with constitutive expression of a mutant type of p53 (hereafter, “+” indicates CDDP treatment). These results interestingly indicate that microgravity altered CDDP sensitivity through activation of caspase-3 by p53-independent mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2963394745,"Knee osteoarthritis (OA) worsens health-related quality of life (HRQoL) but the symptom pathway varies from person to person. We aimed to identify groups of people with knee OA or at its increased risk whose HRQoL changed similarly. Our secondary aim was to evaluate if patient-related characteristics, incidence of knee replacement (KR) and prevalence of pain medication use differed between the identified HRQoL trajectory groups.Eight-year follow-up data of 3053 persons with mild knee OA or at increased risk were obtained from the public Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) database. Group-based trajectory modeling was used to identify patterns of experiencing a decrease of ≥10 points (Minimal Important Change, MIC) in the Quality of Life subscale of the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score compared to baseline. Multinomial logistic regression, Cox regression and generalized estimating equation models were used to study secondary aims.Four HRQoL trajectory groups were identified. Persons in the 'no change' group (62.9%) experienced no worsening in HRQoL. 'Rapidly' (9.5%) and 'slowly' worsening (17.1%) groups displayed an increasing probability of experiencing the MIC in HRQoL. The fourth group (10.4%) had 'improving' HRQoL. Female gender, higher body mass index, smoking, knee pain, and lower income at baseline were associated with belonging to the 'rapidly worsening' group. People in 'rapidly' (hazard ratio (HR) 6.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.6-10.7) and 'slowly' worsening (HR 3.4, 95% CI 2.0-5.9) groups had an increased risk of requiring knee replacement. Pain medication was more rarely used in the 'no change' than in the other groups.HRQoL worsening was associated with several risk factors; surgical and pharmacological interventions were more common in the poorer HRQoL trajectory groups indicating that HRQoL does reflect the need for OA treatment. These findings may have implications for targeting interventions to specific knee OA patient groups."
https://openalex.org/W2963210330,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a chloride channel normally expressed at the surface of epithelial cells. The most frequent mutation, resulting in Phe-508 deletion, causes CFTR misfolding and its premature degradation. Low temperature or pharmacological correctors can partly rescue the Phe508del-CFTR processing defect and enhance trafficking of this channel variant to the plasma membrane (PM). Nevertheless, the rescued channels have an increased endocytosis rate, being quickly removed from the PM by the peripheral protein quality-control pathway. We previously reported that rescued Phe508del-CFTR (rPhe508del) can be retained at the cell surface by stimulating signaling pathways that coax the adaptor molecule ezrin (EZR) to tether rPhe508del-Na+/H+-exchange regulatory factor-1 complexes to the actin cytoskeleton, thereby averting the rapid internalization of this channel variant. However, the molecular basis for why rPhe508del fails to recruit active EZR to the PM remains elusive. Here, using a proteomics approach, we characterized and compared the core components of wt-CFTR– or rPhe508del-containing macromolecular complexes at the surface of human bronchial epithelial cells. We identified calpain 1 (CAPN1) as an exclusive rPhe508del interactor that prevents active EZR recruitment, impairs rPhe508del anchoring to actin, and reduces its stability in the PM. We show that either CAPN1 down-regulation or its chemical inhibition dramatically improves the functional rescue of Phe508del-CFTR in airway cells. These observations suggest that CAPN1 constitutes an appealing target for pharmacological intervention, as part of CF combination therapies restoring Phe508del-CFTR function.

Indeed, we and others have shown that the PM stability of chemical chaperone-rPhe508del-CFTR is still dramatically inferior to that of WT (wt)-CFTR, because of its targeting by the peripheral protein quality control and its deficient anchoring to the actin cytoskeleton (10.Swiatecka-Urban A.

Previously, we demonstrated that the anchoring of rescued channels to the actin cytoskeleton can be enhanced by promoting the PDZ-mediated interaction of Phe508del-CFTR with the Na+/H+ exchange regulatory factor-1 (NHERF1) and the actin-binding adaptor protein ezrin (EZR) (28.Moniz S.

Signal. 2015; 8 (25990958): ra4810.1126/scisignal.aaa1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We have also shown that the mechanism behind this PM stabilization lies on a conformational change in NHERF1, triggered by EZR activation through RAC1 signaling, which is then able to bind and stabilize misfolded CFTR at the PM (29.Loureiro C.A. Matos A.M. Dias-Alves Â. Pereira J.F. Uliyakina I. Barros P. Amaral M.D. Matos P.

This strongly indicated that the protein interactions of wt- and rPhe508del-CFTR at the cell surface can constitute major determinants of CFTR stability and retention at the PM. Over the last years, a growing number of proteins have been reported to interact with PM CFTR, possibly participating in the assembly of large macromolecular complexes (32.Li C. Naren A.P. CFTR chloride channel in the apical compartments: spatiotemporal coupling to its interacting partners.Integr. Biol.

Most interactions occur through the N terminus, the regulatory domain, or the C-terminal tail of CFTR, either directly or mediated through various PDZ domain-containing proteins (32.Li C. Naren A.P.

These dynamic interactions impact on channel function, as well as on its processing and localization within cells (32.Li C. Naren A.P.

Furthermore, it has been established that mutant and nonmutant CFTR show considerable differences in their whole cell interactomes, and thus these differential protein interactions may contribute to the defects observed in Phe508del-CFTR processing and function (36.Pankow S. Bamberger C. Calzolari D. Martínez-Bartolomé S. Lavallée-Adam M. Balch W.E. Yates 3rd, J.R.

Hence, although several CFTR interactor partners are known (33.Li C. Naren A.P. Macromolecular complexes of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator and its interacting partners.Pharmacol.

Okiyoneda T. Peripheral protein quality control as a novel drug target for CFTR stabilizer.Front. Pharmacol. 2018; 9 (30319426): 110010.3389/fphar.2018.01100Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and how these differences could contribute to the defective function and stability of the rescued mutant channels. Here we propose to address these questions by identifying the core components of the CFTR PM molecular complexes in human airway cells expressing wt- or Phe508del-CFTR. For this, we developed an immunoprecipitation (IP) method that selectively captures the CFTR-containing macromolecular complexes at the PM. Our data reveal significant differences between the PM interactors of wt and rPhe508del-CFTR and allowed us to identify calpain 1 (CAPN1) protease as a key player in reducing Phe508del-CFTR actin anchoring and PM stability, thus contributing to the decreased cell surface retention of this rescued mutated channel. We first determined whether wt-CFTR and rPhe508del-CFTR have different PM protein interactors that could contribute to their distinct cell surface stabilities. For that, we developed an IP protocol that allows to biochemically capture PM CFTR-selective interactomes. Briefly, using a cell line model (mCherry–FLAG–CFTR CFBE cells (39.Botelho H.M. Uliyakina I. Awatade N.T. Proença M.C. Tischer C. Sirianant L. Kunzelmann K. Pepperkok R. Amaral M.D. Protein traffic disorders: an effective high-throughput fluorescence microscopy pipeline for drug discovery.Sci. Rep. 2015; 5 (25762484): 903810.1038/srep09038Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar)) that stably expresses mCherry-fused CFTR protein with a FLAG epitope tag inserted at the fourth extracellular loop, we were able to exclusively label CFTR proteins at the PM by incubating cells at 4 °C with an anti-FLAG antibody (Ab) without permeabilization. We then used dithiobis (succinimidyl propionate) (short spacer) and Succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate (long spacer) cross-linkers to reversibly bind, at 4 °C, both the Ab (extracellularly) and the intracellular proteins associated with CFTR at the PM (Fig. 1, A and B). The same protocol was applied in parallel to CFBE cells expressing either wt- or Phe508del–mCherry–FLAG–CFTR, the latter rescued either by low temperature (26 °C) or by VX-809 treatment (Fig. 1C and “Experimental procedures”). As part of the optimization process, we scaled up the number of cells in the Phe508del-CFTR experiments, so that the total amount of rescued CFTR (band C) in the IP was roughly equivalent to that of wt-CFTR (Fig. 1D). To control the experiment for background IP contaminants we used, for wt-CFTR, cell extracts incubated with G-protein agarose beads but without the anti-FLAG Ab. For Phe508del-CFTR IPs, lysates from cells incubated at 37 °C (that have none to residual levels of band C at the PM) were considered the most reliable control for proteins co-IPed with rPhe508del-CFTR (Fig. 1C). The recovered proteins were first analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by MS-compatible silver staining (40.Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Mass spectrometric sequencing of proteins from silver-stained polyacrylamide gels.Anal. Chem. 1996; 68 (8779443): 850-85810.1021/ac950914hCrossref PubMed Scopus (7816) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Noticeably, a distinct band profile was observed for each condition, suggestive of different co-precipitate compositions (Fig. 2). These profiles were reproducible between experimental replicates, and therefore, the whole samples of three individual assays were sent to MS analysis. Qualitative nano-LC MS/MS analysis of our samples generated a set of data in which each MS spectra protein hit was characterized by a protein confidence score (PCS) given by the SCIEX proprietary ProteinPilotTM software. For PCS > 1.3, the confidence in the identification of that particular peptide is equal or higher than 95%. Given that all the experiments were performed in triplicate, we created an algorithm to generate a combined confidence score (CCS), producing five additional integrated confidence levels for the proteins detected among the different replicates: level 5 proteins are detected with PCS ≥ 1.3 in more than one replicate and not in the controls; level 4 proteins are detected in one replicate with a PCS ≥ 1.3 and not in the controls; level 3 proteins are detected in more replicates than in controls with an average PCS higher than their respective controls; level 2 proteins are detected in one replicate with a PCS ≤ 1.3 and not in the controls; and level 1 are proteins detected in the same number of replicates and controls, with an average replicate PCS higher than the average PCS in the corresponding controls. Altogether, we detected 481 wt-CFTR PM putative protein interactors and 631 and 660 Phe508del-CFTR PM putative interactors, respectively, rescued by pharmacological and"
https://openalex.org/W2962772305,"The potential of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 to act as a plant-growth promoter or as a bioremediator of toxic compounds can be affected by desiccation. In the present work, the bacterial survival ratio (BSR) in response to air desiccation was evaluated for P. putida KT2440 in the presence of different protectors. The BSR in the presence of nonreducing disaccharides, such as trehalose, was high after 15 days of desiccation stress (occurring at 30°C and 50% relative humidity), whereas in the absence of a protector the bacterial counts diminished to nondetectable numbers (ca 2.8 log CFU/mL). The LIVE/DEAD staining method showed that bacteria protected with trehalose maintained increased numbers of green cells after desiccation while cells without protection were all observed to be red. This indicated that nonprotected bacteria had compromised membrane integrity. However, when nonprotected bacteria subjected to 18 days of desiccation stress were rehydrated for a short time with maize root exudates or for 48 h with water (prolonged rehydration), the bacterial counts were as high as that observed for those not subjected to desiccation stress, suggesting that the cells entered the viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state under desiccation and that they returned to a culturable state after those means of rehydration. Interestingly an increase in the green color intensity of cells that returned to a culturable state was observed using LIVE/DEAD staining method, indicating an improvement in their membrane integrity. Cellular activity in the VBNC state was determined. A GFP-tagged P. putida strain expressing GFP constitutively was subjected to desiccation. After 12 days of desiccation, the GFP-tagged strain lost culturability, but it exhibited active GFP expression, which in turn made the cells green. Furthermore, the expression of 16S rRNA, rpoN (housekeeping), mutL, mutS (encoding proteins from the mismatch repair complex), and oprH (encoding an outer membrane protein) were examined by RT-PCR. All evaluated genes were expressed by both types of cells, culturable and nonculturable, indicating active molecular processes during the VBNC state."
https://openalex.org/W2963154029,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a neuropsychiatric disorder that arises from a complex interaction of environmental and genetic factors. Despite numerous pharmacological and behavioral interventions, approximately 10% of patients remain refractory. High-frequency deep brain stimulation (HF-DBS) has shown promising results for treatment-refractory OCD. We report the follow-up result of up to 6 years of 4 treatment-refractory OCD patients treated by HF-DBS. Targets of stimulation were the anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC) in two cases, and the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in the remaining cohort. The clinical profiles were quantified by the Yale-Brown obsessive-compulsive scale (Y-BOCS). Highly significant reductions in Y-BOCS scores were obtained from all patients during the follow-up period. A greater that 90% reduction in Y-BOCS, observed in the most successful case, was achieved with NAc HF-DBS. Y-BOCS scores in the other patients consistently achieved over 50% reductions in OCD symptoms. FDG-PET imaging indicated post-surgical reductions in metabolism, in not only targeted limbic networks, but also other frontal cortical and subcortical regions, suggesting that large-scale network modulation and inhibitions are associated with functional recovery in OCD. This study demonstrates that HF-DBS targeted to the ALIC and NAc is a safe and effective method for ameliorating intractable, treatment-refractory OCD symptoms. The NAc appeared to be the superior target for symptom reduction, and local inhibition of NAc activity and reduced frontal metabolism are key therapeutic indications."
https://openalex.org/W2963656424,"Our current study is to identify clinical significance of minichromosome maintenance (MCM) gene expression in Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD) using genome-wide RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) dataset and bioinformatics analysis tools. The biological function and potential process for function of the MCM1-10 were identified by multiple bioinformatics analysis tools. Clinical significance and molecular mechanism of the MCM1-10 were investigated by the RNA-seq dataset of LUAD from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Functional assessment substantiated involvement of MCM1-10 in cell cycle progression and DNA replication, and co-expressed with each other. We also observed that the MCM1-10 were dysregulation in LUAD tumor tissues, and may be have diagnostic implications in LUAD. Prognosis analysis in TCGA and KM plotter cohorts suggest that high abundance of MCM5, MCM8 and MCM4 notably correlated to poor LUAD overall survival. Mechanistic exploration of MCM4, MCM5, and MCM8 by gene set enrichment analysis suggests that these genes may influence the LUAD prognosis by regulating the cell cycle, DNA replication and other multiple biological processes and pathways. In comclusion, our study suggests that MCM1-10 can serve as diagnostic biomarkers for LUAD patients. Of them, MCM4, MCM5, and MCM8 may act as potential prognostic indicators for LUAD."
https://openalex.org/W2964330171,"Unlike most bivalve shellfishes, giant clams (tridacnines) harbor symbiotic microalgae (zooxanthellae) in their fleshy bodies. Zooxanthellae are not maternally inherited by tridacnine offspring, hence, the larvae must acquire zooxanthellae from external sources, although such algal populations or sources in the environment are currently unknown. It is well known that giant clams expel fecal pellets that contain viable zooxanthellae cells, but whether these cells are infectious or just an expelled overpopulation from the giant clams has not been investigated. In this study, we observed the ultrastructural and photosynthetic competencies of zooxanthellae in the fecal pellets of Tridacna crocea and further tested the ability of these cells to infect T. squamosa juveniles. The ultrastructure of the zooxanthellae cells showed that the cells were intact and had not undergone digestion. Additionally, these zooxanthellae cells showed a maximum quantum yield of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) as high as those retained in the mantle of the giant clam. Under the assumption that feces might provide symbionts to the larvae of other giant clams, fecal pellets from Tridacna squamosa and T. crocea were given to artificially hatched 1-day-old T. squamosa larvae. On the 9th day, 15-34% of the larvae provided with the fecal pellets took up zooxanthellae in their stomach, and on the 14th day, zooxanthellae cells reached the larval margin, indicating the establishment of symbiosis. The rate reaching this stage was highest, ca. 5.3%, in the larvae given whole (nonhomogenized) pellets from T. crocea. The composition of zooxanthellae genera contained in the larvae were similar to those in the fecal pellets, although the abundance ratios were significantly different. This study is the first to demonstrate the potential of giant clam fecal pellets as symbiont vectors to giant clam larvae. These results also demonstrate the possibility that fecal pellets are a source of zooxanthellae in coral reefs."
https://openalex.org/W2957441786,"Gamma oscillations (30-55 Hz) are hypothesized to temporally coordinate sensory encoding, enabling perception. However, fast spiking interneurons (FS), key gamma generators, can be highly sensory responsive, as is the gamma band local field potential (LFP). How can FS-mediated gamma act as an impartial temporal reference for sensory encoding, when the sensory drive itself presumably perturbs the pre-established rhythm? Combining tetrode recording in SI barrel cortex with controlled psychophysics, we found a unique FS subtype that was not sensory responsive and spiked regularly at gamma range intervals (gamma regular nonsensory FS [grnsFS]). Successful detection was predicted by a further increase in gamma regular spiking of grnsFS, persisting from before to after sensory onset. In contrast, broadband LFP power, including gamma, negatively predicted detection and did not cohere with gamma band spiking by grnsFS. These results suggest that a distinct FS subtype mediates perceptually relevant oscillations, independent of the LFP and sensory drive."

https://openalex.org/W2963292015,"Tubulin-binding TOG domains are found arrayed in a number of proteins that regulate microtubule dynamics. While much is known about the structure and function of TOG domains from the XMAP215 microtubule polymerase family, less in known about the TOG domain array found in animal CLASP family members. The animal CLASP TOG array promotes microtubule pause, potentiates rescue, and limits catastrophe. How structurally distinct the TOG domains of animal CLASP are from one another, from XMAP215 family TOG domains, and whether a specific order of structurally distinct TOG domains in the TOG array is conserved across animal CLASP family members is poorly understood. We present the x-ray crystal structures of Homo sapiens (H.s.) CLASP1 TOG1 and TOG2. The structures of H.s. CLASP1 TOG1 and TOG2 are distinct from each other and from the previously determined structure of Mus musculus (M.m.) CLASP2 TOG3. Comparative analyses of CLASP family TOG domain structures determined to date across species and paralogs supports a conserved CLASP TOG array paradigm in which structurally distinct TOG domains are arrayed in a specific order. H.s. CLASP1 TOG1 bears structural similarity to the free-tubulin binding TOG domains of the XMAP215 family but lacks many of the key tubulin-binding determinants found in XMAP215 family TOG domains. This aligns with studies that report that animal CLASP family TOG1 domains cannot bind free tubulin or microtubules. In contrast, animal CLASP family TOG2 and TOG3 domains have reported microtubule-binding activity but are structurally distinct from the free-tubulin binding TOG domains of the XMAP215 family. H.s. CLASP1 TOG2 has a convex architecture, predicted to engage a hyper-curved tubulin state that may underlie its ability to limit microtubule catastrophe and promote rescue. M.m. CLASP2 TOG3 has unique structural elements in the C-terminal half of its α-solenoid domain that our modeling studies implicate in binding to laterally-associated tubulin subunits in the microtubule lattice in a mode similar to, yet distinct from those predicted for the XMAP215 family TOG4 domain. The potential ability of the animal CLASP family TOG3 domain to engage lateral tubulin subunits may underlie the microtubule rescue activity ascribed to the domain. These findings highlight the structural diversity of TOG domains within the CLASP family TOG array and provide a molecular foundation for understanding CLASP-dependent effects on microtubule dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2963076994,"Genomics and genome screening are proving central to the study of cancer. However, a good appreciation of the protein structures coded by cancer genes is also invaluable, especially for the understanding of functions, for assessing ligandability of potential targets, and for designing new drugs. To complement the wealth of information on the genetics of cancer in COSMIC, the most comprehensive database for cancer somatic mutations available, structural information obtained experimentally has been brought together recently in COSMIC-3D. Even where structural information is available for a gene in the Cancer Gene Census, a list of genes in COSMIC with substantial evidence supporting their impacts in cancer, this information is quite often for a single domain in a larger protein or for a single protomer in a multiprotein assembly. Here, we show that over 60% of the genes included in the Cancer Gene Census are predicted to possess multiple domains. Many are also multicomponent and membrane-associated molecular assemblies, with mutations recorded in COSMIC affecting such assemblies. However, only 469 of the gene products have a structure represented in the PDB, and of these only 87 structures have 90–100% coverage over the sequence and 69 have less than 10% coverage. As a first step to bridging gaps in our knowledge in the many cases where individual protein structures and domains are lacking, we discuss our attempts of protein structure modelling using our pipeline and investigating the effects of mutations using two of our in-house methods (SDM2 and mCSM) and identifying potential driver mutations. This allows us to begin to understand the effects of mutations not only on protein stability but also on protein-protein, protein-ligand and protein-nucleic acid interactions. In addition, we consider ways to combine the structural information with the wealth of mutation data available in COSMIC. We discuss the impacts of COSMIC missense mutations on protein structure in order to identify and assess the molecular consequences of cancer-driving mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2963840265,"The epidemiology of human Salmonella enterica infections in Guadeloupe (French West Indies) appears to be specific, with a higher prevalence of the subspecies enterica serovars Panama and Arechavaleta (Panama and Arechavaleta) than in other regions. A study was performed in Guadeloupe to identify the reservoir of Salmonella serovars by comparing their distribution in warm- and cold-blooded animals and in humans living in Guadeloupe and mainland France. Furthermore, a case-control study was conducted in 2012-2013 to identify the main epidemiologic risk factors for S. enterica infection among children under 15 years of age. Between June 2011 and December 2014, feces from 426 reptiles (322 anoles, 69 iguanas and 35 geckos) and 50 frogs distributed throughout Guadeloupe and nearby islands were investigated. The frequency of S. enterica carriage was 15.0% (n = 64) in reptiles but varied by species. The only significant risk factor for S. enterica infection was a more frequent presence of frogs in the houses of cases than in those of controls (P = 0.042); however, isolates were not collected. Panama and Arechavaleta were the two serovars most often recovered between 2005 and 2014 from humans living in Guadeloupe (24.5% (n = 174) and 11.5% (n = 82), respectively), which is in contrast to the low prevalence in mainland France (0.4%). Their presence at low frequencies in wild reptiles (4.6% (n = 3) and 3.1% (n = 2), respectively) and pigs (7.5% (n = 5) and 1.5% (n = 1), respectively) suggests a broad host range, and humans may be infected by indirect or direct contact with animals. These serovars are probably poorly adapted to humans and therefore cause more severe infections. The unusual subspecies houtenae serovar 43:z4,z32:- was a major subspecies in wild reptiles (24.6%, n = 16) and humans (9.4%, n = 67) but was not recovered from warm-blooded animals, suggesting that reptiles plays a key role in human infection."
https://openalex.org/W2963449524,"p53 is well-known for its tumour-suppressive activity. However, in the past decade it became clear that p53 is also involved in other processes including stem cell proliferation, differentiation and animal development. To investigate the role of p53 in early embryonic development, we targeted p53 by CRISPR/Cas9 to make a p53 knock-out zebrafish (Danio rerio). Our data show developmental and behavioural effects in p53-deficient zebrafish embryos and larvae. Specifically, we found that early development of zebrafish was clearly delayed in the absence of p53. However, after 1 day (1 dpf), the p53-deficient embryos appeared to recover, as evidenced by a similar level of pigmentation at 26 hpf, similar size of the eye at 4 dpf and only a minor difference in body size at 4 dpf compared to p53 wild-type siblings. The recovery of development after 1 dpf in p53-deficient embryos could be due to a compensatory mechanism involving other p53 family members. p63 and p73 were found over-expressed with respect to wild-type siblings. However, despite this adaptation, the hatching time remained delayed in p53-/- zebrafish. In addition to differences in development, p53-null zebrafish embryos also showed differences in behaviour. We observed an overall reduced activity and a reduced travel distance under non-stressed conditions and after exposing the larvae to vibration. We also observed a longer latency until the larvae started to move after touching with a needle. Overall, these data indicate that p53 is involved in early development and locomotion activities."

Mean temperature and humidity levels were similar in both the cities. The number of influenza cases rose with decrease in precipitation and temperature in Islamabad during 2012-16, although the same cannot be said about humidity. The relationship between meteorological parameters and influenza incidence was not pronounced in case of Multan. The forecasted values in both the cities showed a significant peak during the month of January.The influenza surveillance system gave a better understanding of the disease trend and could accurately forecast influenza activity in Pakistan."
https://openalex.org/W2962755269,"Loc1 and Puf6, which are localized predominantly to the nucleus, are required for the localization and translational repression of the ASH1 mRNA in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. During its transport to the daughter cell, the ASH1 mRNA is translationally repressed via associations with She2, Loc1, and Puf6. Here, we investigated the roles of Loc1 and Puf6 in the translation of mRNAs other than that encoding ASH1. In loc1 or puf6 deletion strains, expression of the mating-specific transcription factor, Ste12, was significantly increased at the post-transcriptional level. These phenotypes required the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of STE12, which carries the putative Puf6-binding sequences. The RNA helicase, Dhh1, which is a known positive regulator for the translation of STE12 mRNA, was found to be functionally connected with Loc1 and Puf6 in the context of Ste12 expression. Our results collectively show that the phosphorylation of the N-terminal Thr16 residue of Dhh1 affects the protein interactions of Dhh1 with Loc1 or Puf6, and consequently regulates Ste12 expression."

https://openalex.org/W2950295232,"Context Over 20 years of conflict in the DRC, North and South Kivu have experienced cycles of stability and conflict, resulting in a compromised health system and poor sexual and reproductive health outcomes. Modern contraceptive use is low (7.5%) and maternal mortality is high (846 deaths per 100,000 live births). Program partners have supported the Ministry of Health (MOH) in North and South Kivu to provide good quality contraceptive services in public health facilities since 2011. Methods Cross-sectional population-based surveys were conducted in the program areas using a two-stage cluster sampling design to ensure representation in each of six rural health zones. Using MOH population estimates for villages in the catchment areas of supported health facilities, 25 clusters in each zone were selected using probability proportional to size. Within each cluster, 22 households were systematically selected, and one woman of reproductive age (15–49 years) was randomly selected from all eligible women in each household. Results Modern contraceptive prevalence among women in union ranged from 8.4% to 26.7% in the six health zones; current use of long-acting or permanent method (LAPM) ranged from 2.5% to 19.8%. The majority of women (58.9% to 90.2%) reported receiving their current method for the first time at a health facility supported by the program partners. Over half of women in four health zones reported wanting to continue their method for five years or longer. Conclusion Current modern contraceptive use and LAPM use were high in these six health zones compared to DRC Demographic and Health Survey data nationally and provincially. These results were accomplished across all six health zones despite their varied socio-demographic characteristics and different experiences of conflict and displacement. These findings demonstrate that women in these conflict-affected areas want contraception and will choose to use it when good quality services are available to them."

The subjects performed tasks under four conditions: (1) right hand up (R-Up), (2) left hand up (L-Up), (3) right hand down (R-Down), and (4) left hand down (L-Down). The peak amplitude of oxy-Hb was significantly larger at the contralateral than ipsilateral hemisphere in the premotor area (PM) under the R-Up condition, and no significant differences were observed between contra- and ipsilateral hemispheres under the L-Up condition. In addition, the peak amplitude was more negative at the contra- than ipsilateral hemisphere in the PM under the R-Down condition, while the peak amplitude was significantly more negative at the ipsi- than contralateral hemisphere in the PM under the L-Down condition.

https://openalex.org/W2963800485,"Several proteins linked to familial Parkinson disease have been associated with mitochondrial (dys-)function and have been described to reside within mitochondria. The putative mitochondrial and sub-mitochondrial localization of these proteins remains disputed, however, potentially due to conflicting results obtained by diverging technical approaches. Using the high-resolution poly-ADP-ribose assisted protein localization assay that also allows for detection of low level and even partial mitochondrial matrix localization, we demonstrate here that DJ-1, but not LRRK2 or α-synuclein, resides in the mitochondrial matrix. The localization of the proteins was not changed in cellular stress models of Parkinson disease and, in case of α-synuclein, not affected by pathological mutations. Our results verify the ability of DJ-1 to carry out its role also from within mitochondria and suggest that LRRK2 and α-synuclein may interact with and affect mitochondria from outside the mitochondrial matrix."
https://openalex.org/W2962677296,"Lysine methylation of cellular proteins is catalyzed by dozens of lysine methyltransferases (KMTs), occurs in thousands of different histone and nonhistone proteins, and regulates diverse biological processes. Dysregulation of KMT-mediated lysine methylations underlies many human diseases. A key unanswered question is how proteins, nonhistone proteins in particular, are specifically methylated by each KMT. Here, using several biochemical approaches, including analytical gel filtration chromatography, isothermal titration calorimetry, and in vitro methylation assays, we discovered that SET domain–containing 7 histone lysine methyltransferase (SETD7), a KMT capable of methylating both histone and nonhistone proteins, uses its N-terminal membrane occupation and recognition nexus (MORN) repeats to dock its substrates and subsequently juxtapose their Lys methylation motif for efficient and specific methylation by the catalytic SET domain. Such docking site–mediated methylation mechanism rationalizes binding and methylation of previously known substrates and predicts new SETD7 substrates. Our findings further suggest that other KMTs may also use docking-mediated substrate recognition mechanisms to achieve their catalytic specificity and efficiency."

Furthermore, we conducted post hoc analyses of other important brain metabolites to understand better the cellular and physiological determinants for changes in NAA levels.We acquired proton (1H) magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) data on a 3 Tesla (3T), GE Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanner in 41 patients (39.9±10.4 years, 22 males) with PDD at two time points: before the start and at the end of a 10-week, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the antidepressant medication duloxetine. Patients were randomized such that 21 patients received the active medication and 20 patients received placebo during the 10 week period of the trial. In addition, we acquire 1H MRSI data once in 29 healthy controls (37.7±11.2 years, 17 males).Patients had significantly higher baseline concentrations of NAA across white matter (WM) pathways and subcortical gray matter, and in direct proportion to the severity of depressive symptoms. NAA concentrations declined in duloxetine-treated patients over the duration of the trial in the direction toward healthy values, whereas concentrations increased in placebo-treated patients, deviating even further away from healthy values. Changes in NAA concentration did not mediate medication effects on reducing symptom severity, however; instead, changes in symptom severity partially mediated the effects of medication on NAA concentration, especially in the caudate and putamen.These findings, taken together, suggest that PDD is not a direct consequence of elevated NAA concentrations, but that a more fundamental pathophysiological process likely causes PDD and determines the severity of its symptoms. The findings also suggest that although duloxetine normalized NAA concentrations in patients, it did so by modulating the severity of depressive symptoms. Medication presumably reduced depressive symptoms through other, as yet unidentified, brain processes.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00360724."

We compared the impact of ART regimens that include dolutegravir (DTG), raltegravir (RAL), efavirenz (EFV), or darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r), in treatment naïve men who have sex with men (MSM) on the probability of HIV-1 sexual transmission events (HIV-TE). Setting Mathematical model. Methods We used discrete event simulation modeling to estimate HIV-TE during the first 8 weeks after initiation of ART. HIV-1 RNA decay in men was modeled from the databases of three clinical trials: Single (DTG vs. EFV), Spring-2 (DTG vs. RAL) and Flamingo (DTG vs. DRV/r). Results All regimens substantially reduced the number of HIV-TE compared to no treatment. DTG led to fewer HIV-TE than its comparator in each of the three trials: 22.72% fewer transmissions than EFV; 0.52% fewer transmissions than RAL; and 38.67% fewer transmissions than DRV/r. The number of patients needed to treat with DTG to prevent one transmission event instead of comparator was 48 vs EFV, 2,194 vs RAL, and 31 vs DRV/r. Conclusion Unsurprisingly, this mathematical model showed that all regimens reduced HIV-TE compared to no treatment. The results also suggest that that initial use of INSTIs, by virtue of their superior viral decay kinetics, have the potential to reduce HIV-1 horizontal transmission following initiation of ART in naïve MSM.

https://openalex.org/W2964019337,"There is increasing evidence that childhood socioeconomic position and childhood adversities influence adult health. However, the potential contribution of these factors to disability retirement is poorly understood. This study aimed to examine the associations between childhood adversities, parental education and disability retirement.Data on parental education and childhood adversities were derived from the Helsinki Health Study baseline survey, conducted in 2000-02 among 40- to 60-year old employees of the City of Helsinki, Finland. Data on disability retirement and their diagnoses were obtained from the Finnish Centre of Pensions and followed until the end of 2016. The analyses included 5992 employees. The associations of parental education and childhood adversities with disability retirement due to any cause, musculoskeletal diseases and mental disorders were analysed using Cox regression analysis.Low parental education was associated with an increased risk of disability retirement due to any cause (maternal education: HR 1.74, 95% CI 1.16-2.62; paternal education: 1.86, 1.38-2.51) and due to musculoskeletal diseases (maternal education: 4.44, 1.66-11.92; paternal education: 3.81, 2.02-7.17). However, adjustment for own education mainly abolished the associations. Economic difficulties in the childhood family, parental alcohol problems and having been bullied at school or by peers increased the risk of disability retirement due to all studied diagnostic groups, whereas parental death or divorce had no effect. Childhood illness (1.53, 1.20-1.95) and parental mental illness (1.68, 1.28-2.20) were associated with disability retirement due to any cause and due to mental disorders (1.65, 1.05-2.59; 3.60, 2.46-5.26). The associations between childhood adversities and disability retirement remained after adjustment for own education, whereas working conditions, and weight and health behaviours somewhat attenuated the associations.Parental education and childhood adversities contributed to disability retirement even in midlife. Policy actions investing in children's well-being might promote work ability in midlife."
https://openalex.org/W2964214839,"To evaluate the effect of pancreatic ductal cells on experimental human islet transplantation.Isolated islets were additionally purified by handpicking. Ductal cells were purified by magnetic cell sorting and then clustered into ductal pancreatospheres (DPS). Islets, DPS, and islets + DPS (100 islets + 75 DPS, or 100 islets + 200 DPS) were cultured and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, β-cell apoptosis, and gene expression was determined. Islets and islets + DPS preparations (800 islets + 600 DPS) were transplanted to streptozotocin-treated immunodeficient mice and glycemia, graft morphometry, and gene expression were determined.Insulin stimulation index was higher in islets than in islets co-cultured with DPS (5.59 ± 0.93 vs 4.02 ± 0.46; p<0.05). IL1B and CXCL11 expression was higher in 100 islets + 200 DPS than in islets (p<0.01), and IL-1β was detected in supernatants collected from DPS and islets + DPS preparations, but not in islets. Hyperglycemia developed in 33% and 67% of mice transplanted with islets or with islets + DPS respectively. β-cell mass was 26% lower in islets + DPS than in islets grafts (p>0.05), and the ratio β-/endocrine non-β-cell mass was lower in islets + DPS grafts (islets: 2.05 ± 0.18, islets + DPS: 1.35 ± 0.15; p<0.01). IL1B and IL1RN expression was significantly higher in islets + DPS grafts.Islet preparations enriched with ductal cells have a lower insulin stimulation index in vitro and achieved a worse metabolic outcome after transplantation. Inflammation may mediate the deleterious effects of ductal cells on islet cells."
https://openalex.org/W2964324319,"Light-induced endocytosis of rhodopsin in the retina is critical for preventing photoreceptor hyperactivity and for the survival of photoreceptor cells. In Drosophila, this process is mediated by arrestin1 (Arr1). Because Arr1 lacks a clathrin-binding domain required for receptor internalization and the C-terminal sequence that interacts with the β-subunit of the clathrin adaptor protein AP2, the mechanism of how Arr1 mediates endocytosis of the major rhodopsin Rh1 is unclear. Here, using several approaches, including Arr binding and pulldown assays, immunofluorescence techniques, and EM imaging, we found that Drosophila metallophosphoesterase (dMPPE) is involved in light-induced rhodopsin endocytosis. We observed that the photoreceptor cells of a dmppe mutant exhibit impaired light-induced rhodopsin endocytosis and that this impairment is independent of dMPPE phosphoesterase activity. Furthermore, dMPPE directly interacted with Arr1 and promoted the association of Arr1 with AP2. Of note, genetic dmppe deletion largely prevented retinal degeneration in norpA (encoding phospholipase C) mutants, which were reported previously to contribute to retinal degeneration, by suppressing Rh1 endocytosis. Our findings demonstrate that Arr1 interacts with AP2 and that dMPPE functions as a critical regulator in Rh1 endocytosis and retinal degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2963886809,"Although cellular and molecular mechanisms during the course of bone healing have been thoroughly investigated, the regulation of gene expression by microRNA during bone regeneration is still poorly understood. We hypothesized that nonunion formation is associated with different microRNA expression patterns and that target proteins of these microRNAs are differently expressed in callus tissue of nonunions compared to physiologically healing bones. In a well-established femoral osteotomy model in CD-1 mice osteotomies were induced which result either in healing or in nonunion formation. MicroRNA and target protein expression was evaluated by microarray, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qrt-PCR) and Western blot. Microarray analyses demonstrated 44 microRNAs to be relevant for nonunion formation compared to physiological bone healing. In nonunions qrt-PCR could validate a higher expression of microRNA-140-3p and microRNA-140-5p. This was associated with a reduced expression of Dnpep and stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1α, which are both known to be target proteins of microRNA-140 and also to be involved in the process of bone healing. These data suggest that an increased expression of microRNA-140-3p and microRNA-140-5p markedly contributes to the development of nonunions, most probably by affecting bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 function during the early stage of healing due to a reduced SDF-1α expression."
https://openalex.org/W2964169434,"High-energy freshwater environments such as rapids and waterfalls in the Upper-Paraná Atlantic Forest are home to highly endemic minute freshwater snails of the genus Acrorbis. Only one species, Acrorbis petricola, is currently included within this genus, whose geographical distribution is restricted to three known populations, one in Brazil and the other two in Argentina. Because of habitat specificity and limited geographical distribution, the species is considered vulnerable in Argentina and endangered in Brazil. In this work, we identify five new populations of A. petricola in southern Upper-Paraná Atlantic Forest, exclusively found on waterfalls from the Misiones Province, Argentina. Based on these populations and on specimens of one of the two historical populations from the Misiones Province, we explored the morphological features of shells and reproductive system of specimens from each location and provide the first molecular data on the species. We used DNA sequences from cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and 16S-rRNA genes to investigate the molecular diversity, genetic distances and genealogical relationships among populations. We verified the existence of intra- and interpopulation morphological variability, with the greatest variation being found in spire, spiral sculpture, penis sheath, flagella, prostatic diverticula and bursa copulatrix. We found interpopulation genetic diversity, with no intrapopulation variation, and identified six geographically structured genetic lineages with maximum genetic distances of up to 2.3%. Different combinations of morphological characters with the same genetic background within each locality were observed. The finding of new populations genetically differentiated not only broadens the known distribution of the species, but also illustrates that waterfall environments in the Atlantic Forest harbour a hidden diversity of Acrorbis that still remains to be discovered. This scenario suggests a complex evolutionary history that needs to be unveiled and taken into account for future development of conservation strategies in this endemic genus."
https://openalex.org/W2964259944,"Increase in mortality involving poisoning, particularly by narcotics, is known to have been one of the factors that affected life expectancy in the US during the last two decades, especially for white Americans and Native Americans. However, the contribution of medicaments other than narcotics to mortality in different racial/age groups is less studied.We regressed annual rates of mortality involving poisoning by medicaments but not narcotics/psychodysleptics (ICD-10 codes T36-39.xx or T41-50.8 but not T40.xx present as either underlying or contributing causes of death), as well as annual rates of mortality for certain subcategories of the above, including mortality involving poisoning by psychotropic drugs but not narcotics/psychodysleptics (ICD-10 codes T43.xx but not T40.xx present as either underlying or contributing causes of death) in different age/racial groups for both the 2000-2011 period and the 2011-2017 period against calendar year.Annual numbers of deaths involving poisoning by medicaments but not narcotics/psychodysleptics grew from 4,332 between 2000-2001 to 11,401 between 2016-2017, with the growth in the rates of those deaths being higher for the 2011-2017 period compared to the 2000-2011 period. The largest increases in the rates of mortality involving poisoning by medicaments but not narcotics/psychodysleptics were in non-elderly Non-Hispanic Native Americans, followed by Non-Hispanic whites. Most of those increases came from increases in the rates of mortality involving poisoning by psychotropic medications; the latter rates grew for the period of 2015-2017 vs. 2000-2002 by factors ranging from 2.75 for ages 35-44y to 5.37 for ages 55-64y.There were major increases in mortality involving poisoning by non-narcotic, particularly psychotropic medicaments, especially in non-elderly non-Hispanic whites and Native Americans. Our results support the need for a comprehensive evaluation of the effect of psychotropic medications on health-related outcomes, including mortality for causes other than poisoning, and the impact of medication misuse."

https://openalex.org/W2964023563,"The presence of vomit, blood, or other foreign liquid materials in the upper airway is a major obstacle in difficult tracheal intubations (TIs) especially in prehospital care. However, the usefulness of video laryngoscopes (VLs) in these situations has not been investigated. The objective of this study was to compare the Airway Scope (AWS) and the Macintosh laryngoscope (ML) for their performance in TIs performed by emergency medical technicians (EMTs) using mannequin models with liquids in the airway. Rice gruel and mock blood were used to fill the upper airways of mannequins to create mock vomit and hematemesis models, respectively. TIs were performed by certified EMTs after visualizing the glottis using an AWS with an 18-Fr suction catheter and a ML with an 18-Fr suction catheter. TIs with AWS and ML were performed in random order in a comparative crossover trial. The TI success rate was evaluated based on the following: (a) the time taken from laryngoscope insertion into the oral cavity to glottis visualization, tracheal tube passage through the glottis, until the initiation of ventilation and (b) the subjective level of difficulty, which was assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS). TIs in vomiting and hematemesis scenarios were performed by 25 and 26 EMTs, respectively. The TI success rates for these scenarios were 100% with both AWS and ML. The median time required until successful ventilation was significantly shorter with AWS than with ML in both the vomiting (42 vs. 58 s) and hematemesis models (33 vs. 39 s), respectively. In the hematemesis scenarios, difficulty assessed using a VAS was lower with AWS than with ML (13 vs. 38 in median), respectively. Compared to the ML, the AWS was capable of faster and easier TIs, in a simulated model of liquid foreign material in the upper airway."
