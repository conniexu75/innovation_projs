Weiberg et al. (p. 118 ; see the Perspective by Baulcombe ) have now found that small RNAs (sRNAs) of the fungus Botrytis cinerea can play a similar role. After fungal infection of tomato or Arabidopsis leaves, the plant cells contained a suite of fungal-derived sRNAs. Three sRNAs were found to bind to the plant's own Argonaute protein, thereby silencing the plant's fungal defense genes."
https://openalex.org/W2158259619,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic itch and inflammatory disorder of the skin that affects one in ten people. Patients suffering from severe AD eventually progress to develop asthma and allergic rhinitis, in a process known as the ""atopic march."" Signaling between epithelial cells and innate immune cells via the cytokine thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is thought to drive AD and the atopic march. Here, we report that epithelial cells directly communicate to cutaneous sensory neurons via TSLP to promote itch. We identify the ORAI1/NFAT calcium signaling pathway as an essential regulator of TSLP release from keratinocytes, the primary epithelial cells of the skin. TSLP then acts directly on a subset of TRPA1-positive sensory neurons to trigger robust itch behaviors. Our results support a model whereby calcium-dependent TSLP release by keratinocytes activates both primary afferent neurons and immune cells to promote inflammatory responses in the skin and airways."

It is clear that papers that have been cited frequently tend to accumulate more citations. It is also clear that, with time, even the most novel paper loses its currency. Some papers, however, seem to have an inherent “fitness” that can be interpreted as a community's response to the research. Wang et al. (p. 127 ; see the Perspective by Evans ) developed a mechanistic model to predict citation history. The model links a paper's ultimate impact, represented by the total number of citations the paper will ever receive, to a single measurable parameter inferred from its early citation history. The model was used to identify factors that influence a journal's impact factor."

(p. 108 ) now show that coral reef sponges are part of a highly efficient recycling pathway for dissolved organic matter (DOM), converting it, via rapid sponge-cell turnover, into cellular detritus that becomes food for reef consumers. DOM transfer through the sponge loop approaches the gross primary production rates required for the entire coral reef ecosystem."

Using a consistent database of cortico-cortical connectivity, generated from hemisphere-wide, retrograde tracing experiments in the macaque, we analyzed interareal weights and distances to reveal an important organizational principle of brain connectivity. Using appropriate graph theoretical measures, we show that although very dense (66%), the interareal network has strong structural specificity. Connection weights exhibit a heavy-tailed lognormal distribution spanning five orders of magnitude and conform to a distance rule reflecting exponential decay with interareal separation. A single-parameter random graph model based on this rule predicts numerous features of the cortical network: (1) the existence of a network core and the distribution of cliques, (2) global and local binary properties, (3) global and local weight-based communication efficiencies modeled as network conductance, and (4) overall wire-length minimization. These findings underscore the importance of distance and weight-based heterogeneity in cortical architecture and processing.

These findings underscore the importance of distance and weight-based heterogeneity in cortical architecture and processing. A characteristic feature of the cerebral cortex is its modular organization. Sensory, motor, and cognitive systems are organized as constellations of distinct areas, each within a well-defined region or lobe. Analyses of the functional specificities of individual areas and of their cooperative and competitive interactions mediated by numerous interareal pathways have provided profound insights concerning the role of the cortex in higher functions (Mountcastle, 1998Mountcastle V.B.

Anatomical tract-tracing methods permit the analysis of cortical connectivity at much higher resolution than is currently possible with in vivo brain imaging techniques (Bakker et al., 2012Bakker R.

Nevertheless, many fundamental aspects of cortical circuitry remain poorly understood (Bohland et al., 2009Bohland J.W. Wu C. Barbas H. Bokil H. Bota M. Breiter H.C. Cline H.T. Doyle J.C. Freed P.J.

The future of the human connectome.Neuroimage. 2012; 62: 1299-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Our current understanding of cortical connectivity owes much to the seminal work of Sporns and coworkers who conceptualized interareal neuroanatomy in terms of graph theory (Sporns et al., 2000Sporns O. Tononi G. Edelman G.M. Theoretical neuroanatomy: relating anatomical and functional connectivity in graphs and cortical connection matrices.Cereb. Cortex. 2000; 10: 127-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). The fundamental motivation is that the analyses of the network properties of complex systems can provide insights into the computations that they carry out (Barabasi and Albert, 1999Barabasi A.L.

Investigation of the cortical graph has made important progress, showing for instance that the brain exhibits a remarkable economy in its organization (Bullmore and Sporns, 2012Bullmore E. Sporns O.

MIT Press, Cambridge2011Google Scholar). Further, studies using subgraphs with low densities suggest that cortical networks are structurally heterogeneous, exhibiting a highly connected core region (high centrality) that may provide an important integrative capacity to the cortex (Harriger et al., 2012Harriger L. van den Heuvel M.P. Sporns O. Rich club organization of macaque cerebral cortex and its role in network communication.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e46497Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, Modha and Singh, 2010Modha D.S.

High-cost, high-capacity backbone for global brain communication.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 11372-11377Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). The data sets used in early investigations of the structural organization of the cortical network at the single-cell level largely relied on data that were based on binary (yes/no) assessments of connectivity and were collated across numerous experimental studies. While this approach has been highly productive, it has inherent limitations due to inconsistencies between laboratories as well as the use of incomplete and nonquantitative data (Kennedy et al., 2013Kennedy H. Knoblauch K. Toroczkai Z. Why data coherence and quality is critical for understanding interareal cortical networks.Neuroimage. 2013; 80: 37-45https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.1004.1031Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study set out to establish a consistent database of interareal connectivity using sensitive retrograde tracers in order to determine the weighted connectivity of the inputs to 29 areas in an atlas of 91 cortical areas (Markov et al., 2012Markov N.T. Ercsey-Ravasz M.M. Ribeiro Gomes A.R. Lamy C. Magrou L. Vezoli J. Misery P. Falchier A. Quilodran R. Gariel M.A. et al.A weighted and directed interareal connectivity matrix for macaque cerebral cortex.Cereb. Cortex. 2012; (Published online September 25, 2012)https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhs1270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This large-scale anatomical investigation of the macaque cortex provided a weighted and directed connectivity matrix in which the 29 injected areas are linked by 1,615 interareal pathways. Over one-third of these pathways had not been reported in previous studies. While a single injection only provides information about the inputs to a given area, the set of 29 injections provides a complete assessment of the inputs and outputs within the subgraph of 29 areas (G29x29). Such edge-complete subgraphs of a large network are expected to possess many of the properties of the network from which they are extracted. In particular, because the 29 injections are widely distributed within the full set of 91 cortical areas, it is expected that the properties of the G29x29 subgraph are representative of the full interareal network (FIN). Note that this is not typically the case for subgraphs based on edge-incomplete data. Analysis of the G29x29 subgraph revealed a number of unexpected network properties (Markov et al., 2013Markov N.T. Ercsey-Ravasz M.M. Lamy C. Ribeiro Gomes A.R. Magrou L. Misery P. Giroud P. Barone P. Dehay C. Toroczkai Z. et al.The role of long-range connections on the specificity of the macaque interareal cortical network.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 5187-5192Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Foremost, the cortical graph has a much higher density (66% of the connections that can exist do exist) than expected from previous work on collated databases. If connections were homogenously spread across the cortex, such a high density would preclude significant binary specificity within the graph. However, the probability of a connection existing between any two given areas declines sharply with distance (Markov et al., 2013Markov N.T. Ercsey-Ravasz M.M. Lamy C. Ribeiro Gomes A.R. Magrou L. Misery P. Giroud P. Barone P. Dehay C. Toroczkai Z. et al.The role of long-range connections on the specificity of the macaque interareal cortical network.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 5187-5192Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This explains the observed specificity of long-range between-lobe connections, which is directly related to the spatial embedding of the network. By contrast, within-lobe connections were shown to exhibit low binary specificity, since nearly all the possible connections actually occur (i.e., densities approach 100%). These results suggest that the cortico-cortical connections within the constellation of areas of a particular lobe or region achieve their specificity mainly via the heterogeneity of their weights (Markov et al., 2011Markov N.T. Misery P. Falchier A. Lamy C. Vezoli J. Quilodran R. Gariel M.A. Giroud P. Ercsey-Ravasz M. Pilaz L.J. et al.Weight consistency specifies regularities of macaque cortical networks.Cereb.

Cortex. 2012; (Published online September 25, 2012)https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhs1270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Contrary to some virtual networks such as the world-wide web, the cortical network is a spatially embedded physical network. It is constructed under evolutionary pressure acting on physical parameters, such as wire length and overall network volume, that impose constraints on its architecture. Such evolutionary pressure could mean that wire length minimization will impose constraints on network connectedness with increasing brain size (Ringo, 1991Ringo J.L. Neuronal interconnection as a function of brain size.Brain Behav. Evol. 1991; 38: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Indeed, there is evidence that the structure and function of cortical networks optimize resources and satisfy constraint minimization at multiple scales, thereby influencing diverse aspects of cortical architecture including arealization and cortical folding (Chklovskii and Koulakov, 2004Chklovskii D.B.

A tension-based theory of morphogenesis and compact wiring in the central nervous system.Nature. 1997; 385: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). In order to quantitatively assess the role of wire minimization on the cortical architecture, we estimated the numbers of wires (i.e., number of cells projecting onto an injection site yielding the strength or weight of connection) between areas and the distance of projections (see Experimental Procedures). As noted above, interareal distances play an important role in defining certain aspects of the specificity of the cortical graph, meaning that its embedded nature (i.e., its spatial organization) must be taken into consideration. However, given the high density of the G29x29 graph, appropriate graph theoretic approaches must also be used. Three features of the data concerning weight and distance have governed our approach: first, the weights of the pathways span five orders of magnitude; second, weights are distributed in a lognormal fashion; and third, interareal distances are normally distributed (Markov et al., 2011Markov N.T. Misery P. Falchier A. Lamy C. Vezoli J. Quilodran R. Gariel M.A. Giroud P. Ercsey-Ravasz M. Pilaz L.J. et al.Weight consistency specifies regularities of macaque cortical networks.Cereb.

USA. 2013; 110: 5187-5192Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Here, we examine how multiple aspects of our data interact to predict important features of cortical organization and, by implication, the information theoretical function therein. We demonstrate that important graph theoretical characteristics of the cortical network, as well as its previously reported specificity (Markov et al., 2013Markov N.T. Ercsey-Ravasz M.M. Lamy C. Ribeiro Gomes A.R. Magrou L. Misery P. Giroud P. Barone P. Dehay C. Toroczkai Z. et al.The role of long-range connections on the specificity of the macaque interareal cortical network.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 5187-5192Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and core-periphery structure (Harriger et al., 2012Harriger L. van den Heuvel M.P. Sporns O. Rich club organization of macaque cerebral cortex and its role in network communication.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e46497Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, Modha and Singh, 2010Modha D.S. Singh R. Network architecture of the long-distance pathways in the macaque brain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 13485-13490Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), can be formulated in terms of a wiring economy principle (quantified as an exponential distance rule) with the help of a single-parameter network model. This unique, physical parameter expresses the decline in the probability of axonal projection as a function of distance and is extracted from anatomical data. The implications of these findings are considered in the Discussion. Connection weights were derived from a connectivity matrix based on interareal connection strengths in the macaque (Markov et al., 2012Markov N.T. Ercsey-Ravasz M.M. Ribeiro Gomes A.R. Lamy C. Magrou L. Vezoli J. Misery P. Falchier A. Quilodran R. Gariel M.A. et al.A weighted and directed interareal connectivity matrix for macaque cerebral cortex.Cereb. Cortex. 2012; (Published online September 25, 2012)https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhs1270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The weight of a projection from a source area to a given target area (the area injected) is defined by the fraction of labeled neurons (FLN) expressed as the ratio between the number of labeled neurons in that source area over the total number of labeled cortical neurons extrinsic to the injected area. Distances were measured as the length of the shortest trajectory interconnecting areas via the white matter, approximating the axonal distance (see Supplemental Information available online). The projections between the NF = 91 areas comprise the full interareal network (FIN), which is a directed, weighted, spatially embedded graph G91x91 on 91 nodes. The FLN fij of a link projecting from area i to area j represents the weight of that projection (later parameterized as wij=−logfij, for a conductance-type analysis). The n = 29 injections have identified a total of E = 1,615 edges of G91x91, forming the currently known subgraph G29x91 of FIN. The 29 × 29 directed graph G29x29 includes only the injected areas and their interconnections, and therefore it has full connectivity information within this set. Accordingly, G29x29 is an edge-complete subgraph of the FIN. Given that injected areas are evenly distributed across the cortex, the statistical properties of G29x29 are likely to be representative of the FIN. The G29x29 subgraph has M = 536 (binary) links out of the maximum possible of N(N − 1) = 812; it is a very dense graph with a density (ρ=M/[N(N−1)]) of 66% (Markov et al., 2012Markov N.T. Ercsey-Ravasz M.M. Ribeiro Gomes A.R. Lamy C. Magrou L. Vezoli J. Misery P. Falchier A. Quilodran R.

Cortex. 2012; (Published online September 25, 2012)https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhs1270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For each injected area, the distribution of FLNs (incoming link weights) is lognormal (Markov et al., 2011Markov N.T. Misery P. Falchier A. Lamy C. Vezoli J. Quilodran R. Gariel M.A. Giroud P. Ercsey-Ravasz M. Pilaz L.J. et al.Weight consistency specifies regularities of macaque cortical networks.Cereb.

Cortex. 2012; (Published online September 25, 2012)https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhs1270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Figure 1A shows that the pooled distribution of FLN values for all the 29 injections also has a lognormal distribution, hence exhibiting a heavy tail (Figure 1B). Here we show that the FLN decays exponentially as a function of projection distance. This allows formulation of a global distance rule as a principle of allocation of resources in the cortex. Figure 2A shows the log(FLN) values for all 1,615 projections of G29x91 as a function of interareal projection length. In spite of the variability in the data, there is a clear decay trend (red, linear fit) with increasing distance. However, the FLNs group neuronal counts via the injected areas, thus providing a binning by areas. Projections at longer distances come at a metabolic cost for individual neurons. To better express this cost principle as a global (area-independent) property, Figure 2B shows a histogram for all retrogradely labeled neurons found from the 29 injections (a total of 6,494,974) as function of the projection distance between cortical areas. This exhibits an exponential decay that we refer to as the “exponential distance rule” (EDR). Accordingly, p(d) can be interpreted as the probability of a projection length d, irrespectively of the areas involved. Based on Figure 2B, we express this principle as:p(d)=cexp(−λd)(1) where c is a normalization constant and λ=λd=0.188mm−1 (obtained from least-squares fitting, Figure 2B). The blue line in Figure 2A corresponds to Equation (1) with λ=λd, indicating that it is a good approximation for the linear decay trend (red line with λfij=0.150mm−1 in Figure 2A) of the log(FLN) values as well. Since the fraction of labeled neurons fij can be interpreted as the probability of a neuronal projection from i to j, the agreement in Figure 2A shows that, on average, we can approximate the FLN values with their distance-dependent projection probabilities, i.e., fij≈p(dij)=ce−λdij, where dij is the distance between the areas. From this, the distance between two areas can on average be expressed in terms of the corresponding log(FLN) values (natural log) as:dij≈−1λlogfij+1λlogc.(2) Figure 2Projection Length Distributions in the Macaque CortexShow full caption(A) FLN values (log fij) for all 1,615 projections as a function of projection length (dij) estimated through the white matter.

(C) Distribution of interareal distances in G29x91 matrix, a purely geometrical property, is best approximated by a Gaussian (mean 〈d〉=μ=26.57mm; SD σ=10.11mm). The distribution of the interareal distances (i.e., the fraction of area pairs separated by distance d) conforms to a Gaussian (see Figure 2C), i.e.,q(d)=1σ2πexp[−12σ2(d−μ)2],(3) with μ=26.57mm and σ=10.11mm. Note that Equation (3) expresses a geometrical property of the cortex, the distribution of areal separations, and is not related to neuronal counts or densities. Substituting the distance variable in Equation (3) with its expression in terms of log(FLN)s from Equation (2), gives an approximation to the fraction of ordered area pairs that have a given log(FLN) value, i.e., an approximation to the log(FLN) distribution:P(log(f))=q(d(f))=λγ2πexp[−12γ2(logf−ν)2](4) with γ=σλ and ν=μλ−logc. This is indeed a Gaussian, consistent with the experimental observation that the FLN distribution is a lognormal. Note that this derivation captures only the lognormal form, as we have replaced distances in Equation (3) by an expression of the FLNs that holds only on average, Equation (2). Accordingly, the width of the Gaussian distribution in Figure 1A (data) is wider than that of Equation (4), due to fluctuations around the average. Because the G29x29 graph is a densely connected network, one might expect there to be little structural specificity on the binary level (nodes connected or not). However, G29x29 is actually a special graph even at the binary level. This specificity follows directly from the EDR (decreasing probability of projection with distance principle), acting as a physical constraint and the spatial embedding of the cortex acting as a geometrical constraint. To explore further the role of distance in the structural properties of the cortical network, we generated two random graph models using different distance rules. One obeys the observed exponential distance rule (1) (EDR graphs), the other a constant distance rule p(d)=const, in which the probability of a projection having a distance d is a constant (CDR graphs). The CDR model can be considered a special case of EDR with λ = 0. To construct the model graphs, we first chose a connection length d according to the distance rule p(d). We next pick uniformly at random (to avoid biases, following Jaynes’ maximum entropy principle; Jaynes, 1957Jaynes E.T. Information theory and statistical mechanics.Phys. Rev. 1957; 106: 620-630Crossref Scopus (8070) Google Scholar) an area pair (i,j) from the set of area pairs in the 29 × 29 matrix of measured distances, whose separation is in the same distance bin as d, then insert a connection in the graph directed from j to i. Multiple connections from j to i are allowed, thus generating the projection’s weight; the process is halted after accumulating M = 536 binary connections (i.e., the number of connections in the G29x29). To compare graph theoretical properties between the model and the cortical graph G29x29, we generated 1,000 random realizations of each model graph, averaged the measured quantity over these realizations, and compared this average to the same measure on G29x29. Previous studies of collated data had suggested that connections between cortical areas are dominated by reciprocally interconnected pathways (Felleman and Van Essen, 1991Felleman D.J. Van Essen D.C.

Noncoding regions under very strong negative selection included binding sites of some chromatin and general transcription factors (TFs) and core motifs of some important TF families. Positive selection in TF binding sites tended to occur in network hub promoters.

Here we show, using an isogenic human embryonic stem cell model of RTT, that MECP2 mutant neurons display key molecular and cellular features of this disorder. Unbiased global gene expression analyses demonstrate that MECP2 functions as a global activator in neurons but not in neural precursors. Decreased transcription in neurons was coupled with a significant reduction in nascent protein synthesis and lack of MECP2 was manifested as a severe defect in the activity of the AKT/mTOR pathway. Lack of MECP2 also leads to impaired mitochondrial function in mutant neurons. Activation of AKT/mTOR signaling by exogenous growth factors or by depletion of PTEN boosted protein synthesis and ameliorated disease phenotypes in mutant neurons. Our findings indicate a vital function for MECP2 in maintaining active gene transcription in human neuronal cells."
https://openalex.org/W2087531974,"GABAergic cortical interneurons have important roles in the computations of neural circuits, but their developmental origin in primates is controversial. Here the authors characterize neural stem cell and progenitor cell organization in the developing human ganglionic eminences and reveal that, just as in rodents, they give rise to a majority of cortical GABAergic neurons. GABAergic cortical interneurons underlie the complexity of neural circuits and are particularly numerous and diverse in humans. In rodents, cortical interneurons originate in the subpallial ganglionic eminences, but their developmental origins in humans are controversial. We characterized the developing human ganglionic eminences and found that the subventricular zone (SVZ) expanded massively during the early second trimester, becoming densely populated with neural stem cells and intermediate progenitor cells. In contrast with the cortex, most stem cells in the ganglionic eminence SVZ did not maintain radial fibers or orientation. The medial ganglionic eminence exhibited unique patterns of progenitor cell organization and clustering, and markers revealed that the caudal ganglionic eminence generated a greater proportion of cortical interneurons in humans than in rodents. On the basis of labeling of newborn neurons in slice culture and mapping of proliferating interneuron progenitors, we conclude that the vast majority of human cortical interneurons are produced in the ganglionic eminences, including an enormous contribution from non-epithelial SVZ stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W2011796667,"Sox2(+) adult mouse pituitary cells can self-renew and terminally differentiate in vitro, but their physiological role in vivo and possible contribution to oncogenesis remain largely unknown. Using genetic lineage tracing, we show here that the Sox2(+) cell compartment of both the embryonic and adult pituitary contains stem/progenitor cells that are able to differentiate into all hormone-producing lineages and contribute to organ homeostasis during postnatal life. In addition, we show that targeted expression of oncogenic β-catenin in Sox2(+) cells gives rise to pituitary tumors, but, unexpectedly, the tumor mass is not derived from the Sox2(+) mutation-sustaining cells, suggesting a paracrine role of Sox2(+) cells in pituitary oncogenesis. Our data therefore provide in vivo evidence of a role for Sox2(+) stem/progenitor cells in long-term physiological maintenance of the adult pituitary, and highlight an unexpected non-cell-autonomous role for these cells in the induction of pituitary tumors."

We report a strategy to respecify lineage-restricted CD34(+)CD45(+) myeloid precursors derived from hPSCs into multilineage progenitors that can be expanded in vitro and engrafted in vivo. HOXA9, ERG, and RORA conferred self-renewal and multilineage potential in vitro and maintained primitive CD34(+)CD38(-) cells. Screening cells via transplantation revealed that two additional factors, SOX4 and MYB, conferred engraftment. Progenitors specified with all five factors gave rise to reproducible short-term engraftment with myeloid and erythroid lineages. Erythroid precursors underwent hemoglobin switching in vivo, silencing embryonic and activating adult globin expression. Our combinatorial screening approach establishes a strategy for obtaining transcription-factor-mediated engraftment of blood progenitors from human pluripotent cells."
https://openalex.org/W2058183189,"Delaying clinical disease onset would greatly reduce neurodegenerative disease burden, but the mechanisms influencing early preclinical progression are poorly understood. Here, we show that in mouse models of familial motoneuron (MN) disease, SOD1 mutants specifically render vulnerable MNs dependent on endogenous neuroprotection signaling involving excitability and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). The most vulnerable low-excitability FF MNs already exhibited evidence of pathology and endogenous neuroprotection recruitment early postnatally. Enhancing MN excitability promoted MN neuroprotection and reversed misfolded SOD1 (misfSOD1) accumulation and MN pathology, whereas reducing MN excitability augmented misfSOD1 accumulation and accelerated disease. Inhibiting metabotropic cholinergic signaling onto MNs reduced ER stress, but enhanced misfSOD1 accumulation and prevented mTOR activation in alpha-MNs. Modulating excitability and/or alpha-MN mTOR activity had comparable effects on the progression rates of motor dysfunction, denervation, and death. Therefore, excitability and mTOR are key endogenous neuroprotection mechanisms in motoneurons to counteract clinically important disease progression in ALS."

https://openalex.org/W2071110654,"The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) is essential in mammalian mitosis to ensure the equal segregation of sister chromatids. The SAC generates a mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC) to prevent the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) from targeting key mitotic regulators for destruction until all of the chromosomes have attached to the mitotic apparatus. A single unattached kinetochore can delay anaphase for several hours, but how it is able to block the APC/C throughout the cell is not understood. Present concepts of the SAC posit that either it exhibits an all-or-nothing response or there is a minimum threshold sufficient to block the APC/C (ref. 7). Here, we have used gene targeting to measure SAC activity, and find that it does not have an all-or-nothing response. Instead, the strength of the SAC depends on the amount of MAD2 recruited to kinetochores and on the amount of MCC formed. Furthermore, we show that different drugs activate the SAC to different extents, which may be relevant to their efficacy in chemotherapy."

https://openalex.org/W2033771177,"Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) are exposed to low levels of oxygen in the bone marrow niche, and hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are the main regulators of cellular responses to oxygen variation. Recent studies using conditional knockout mouse models have unveiled a major role for HIF-1α in the maintenance of murine HSCs; however, the role of HIF-2α is still unclear. Here, we show that knockdown of HIF-2α, and to a much lesser extent HIF-1α, impedes the long-term repopulating ability of human CD34(+) umbilical cord blood cells. HIF-2α-deficient HSPCs display increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which subsequently stimulates endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and triggers apoptosis by activation of the unfolded-protein-response (UPR) pathway. HIF-2α deregulation also significantly decreased engraftment ability of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Overall, our data demonstrate a key role for HIF-2α in the maintenance of human HSPCs and in the survival of primary AML cells."

https://openalex.org/W2028511996,"The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) arrests cells in metaphase until all chromosomes are attached to the spindle. Dick and Gerlich used laser microsurgery to detach individual chromosomes, revealing that the SAC does not have a switch-like response — instead, SAC strength depends on the number of unattached chromosomes. The mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) delays anaphase onset until all chromosomes have attached to both spindle poles1,2. Here, we investigated SAC signalling kinetics in response to acute detachment of individual chromosomes using laser microsurgery. Most detached chromosomes delayed anaphase until they had realigned to the metaphase plate. A substantial fraction of cells, however, entered anaphase in the presence of unaligned chromosomes. We identify two mechanisms by which cells can bypass the SAC: first, single unattached chromosomes inhibit the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) less efficiently than a full complement of unattached chromosomes; second, because of the relatively slow kinetics of re-imposing APC/C inhibition during metaphase, cells were unresponsive to chromosome detachment up to several minutes before anaphase onset. Our study defines when cells irreversibly commit to enter anaphase and shows that the SAC signal strength correlates with the number of unattached chromosomes. Detailed knowledge about SAC signalling kinetics is important for understanding the emergence of aneuploidy and the response of cancer cells to chemotherapeutics targeting the mitotic spindle."
https://openalex.org/W2071297128,"Helicobacter pylori infection is the major risk factor for gastric adenocarcinoma. The link with gastric adenocarcinoma is partly due to the H. pylori CagA oncoprotein. CagA is responsible for a particular cell phenotype in vitro, the ‘hummingbird’ phenotype, that corresponds to an elongation of the cells, mimicking an epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT participates in the carcinogenesis process, and is involved in the generation of cancer stem cells (CSCs). However, its involvement in gastric carcinogenesis has yet not been studied. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the role of H. pylori in EMT and in the emergence of gastric CSCs. For this purpose, gastric epithelial cells were cocultured with a cagA-positive H. pylori strain or its isogenic-deleted mutants or were transfected with CagA expression vectors. Study of the expression of epithelial and mesenchymal markers showed that H. pylori, via CagA, is responsible for an EMT phenotype associated with an increase in mesenchymal markers as well as CD44 expression, a known gastric CSC marker. Moreover, infection led to an increased ability to migrate, to invade and to form tumorspheres. Cell sorting experiments showed that only the CD44high cells induced by H. pylori infection displayed the mesenchymal phenotype and CSC properties in vitro, and had higher tumorigenic properties than CD44low cells in xenografted mice. Immunohistochemistry analyses on human and mouse gastric mucosa tissue samples confirmed a high expression of CD44 and mesenchymal markers in H. pylori-infected cases, and in gastric dysplasia and carcinoma. All of these data suggest that H. pylori, via CagA, unveils CSC-like properties by induction of EMT-like changes in gastric epithelial cells."

Our results highlight the pituitary as a model for exploring how physiological changes influence stem cell behavior and suggest that manipulation of endogenous pituitary stem cells is a potential therapeutic strategy for pituitary deficiencies. Throughout the life of an animal, organ-specific differentiated cell types are renewed. This can be achieved by cell division, as shown by hepatocytes in the liver, and/or by differentiation from a pool of undifferentiated multipotent progenitors or stem cells, such as the gastrointestinal epithelium. While adult progenitors or stem cells are being found in an increasing number of organs, their participation in tissue homeostasis varies according to rates of cell turnover and the ability of differentiated cell types to self-renew. One central goal of regenerative medicine is to be able to instruct resident tissue stem cells to repair a deficient organ. It is therefore crucial to know how organ-specific tissue stem cells function under normal physiological situations and also whether it is possible to stimulate their regenerative potential. The pituitary is an endocrine gland involved in maintaining body homeostasis and controlling physiological processes such as reproductive maturation and function. It does so by secreting hormones under control of the hypothalamus, which acts to centralize peripheral information. The pituitary is an organ with a low cell turnover where differentiated endocrine cells are able to divide, but they do so rarely (Levy, 2002Levy A. Physiological implications of pituitary trophic activity.J. Endocrinol. 2002; 174: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Physiological situations evolve during life: growth is crucial in juvenile animals, later, sexual maturation occurs, and, in the female, pregnancy and lactation can take place. All these processes are controlled by specific hormonal outputs from the pituitary, which must constantly modulate its hormonal secretions appropriately. This adaptability can be achieved in different ways, such as by modifying levels and/or temporal patterns of hormonal synthesis and secretion, but it has also been proposed that a population of adult progenitor/stem cells is involved. Recently, several labs have characterized (likely overlapping) populations of such cells (for review see Rizzoti, 2010Rizzoti K. Adult pituitary progenitors/stem cells: from in vitro characterization to in vivo function.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2010; 32: 2053-2062Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The ability to control the activity of these progenitors in vivo, or to use them in regenerative or cell transplant therapies, could be used to manipulate physiological states or to treat congenital or acquired pituitary hormone deficiencies, which are associated with significant morbidity. This could also alleviate both the side-effects and cost of current hormone replacement and substitution therapies (for review see Castinetti et al., 2011Castinetti F. Davis S.W. Brue T. Camper S.A. Pituitary stem cell update and potential implications for treating hypopituitarism.Endocr. Rev. 2011; 32: 453-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We showed that pituitary progenitors express the SRY-related HMG box transcription factors SOX2 and SOX9 (Fauquier et al., 2008Fauquier T. Rizzoti K. Dattani M. Lovell-Badge R. Robinson I.C. SOX2-expressing progenitor cells generate all of the major cell types in the adult mouse pituitary gland.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 2907-2912Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). These belong to different subfamilies, SOXB1 and SOXE, and are therefore likely to regulate different sets of target genes. Both proteins have pleiotropic roles during organogenesis but also in different adult stem cell populations (for review see Sarkar and Hochedlinger, 2013Sarkar A. Hochedlinger K. The sox family of transcription factors: versatile regulators of stem and progenitor cell fate.Cell Stem Cell. 2013; 12: 15-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). During pituitary development, SOX2 is expressed initially in all cells of Rathke’s Pouch (RP), an outpocketing of the oral ectoderm that gives rise to the anterior and intermediate pituitary (Fauquier et al., 2008Fauquier T. Rizzoti K. Dattani M. Lovell-Badge R. Robinson I.C. SOX2-expressing progenitor cells generate all of the major cell types in the adult mouse pituitary gland.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 2907-2912Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), where it is required for progenitor proliferation (Jayakody et al., 2012Jayakody S.A. Andoniadou C.L. Gaston-Massuet C.

Invest. 2012; 122: 3635-3646Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar and our unpublished data), while SOX9 is expressed later, after the first and main wave of embryonic progenitor cell cycle exit (Davis et al., 2011Davis S.W. Mortensen A.H. Camper S.A. Birthdating studies reshape models for pituitary gland cell specification.Dev. Biol. 2011; 352: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, Fauquier et al., 2008Fauquier T. Rizzoti K. Dattani M. Lovell-Badge R. Robinson I.C.

Expression of both proteins is downregulated upon endocrine differentiation. This pattern is still present in the adult where SOX2;SOX9-double-positive cells form the epithelium lining the pituitary cleft, the remnant of RP lumen, proposed as a pituitary stem cell niche, and are also scattered in the pituitary parenchyma (for review see Rizzoti, 2010Rizzoti K. Adult pituitary progenitors/stem cells: from in vitro characterization to in vivo function.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2010; 32: 2053-2062Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In vitro, pituitary spheres initially express SOX2, then SOX9, and can give rise to endocrine cells (Fauquier et al., 2008Fauquier T. Rizzoti K. Dattani M. Lovell-Badge R. Robinson I.C. SOX2-expressing progenitor cells generate all of the major cell types in the adult mouse pituitary gland.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 2907-2912Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In vivo, it has been suggested that SOX2+ve cells could generate new endocrine cells in experimental endocrine cell elimination models, where limited regeneration was observed (Fu et al., 2012Fu Q. Gremeaux L. Luque R.M. Liekens D. Chen J. Buch T. Waisman A. Kineman R. Vankelecom H.

Vankelecom H. Regenerative capacity of the adult pituitary: multiple mechanisms of lactotrope restoration after transgenic ablation.Stem Cells Dev. 2012; 21: 3245-3257Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), although these studies were correlative and did not involve fate-mapping. In this study, we demonstrate that SOX2- and SOX9-positive progenitors are the sphere-forming cells in vitro and, from lineage analysis, demonstrate that they give rise to endocrine cells in vivo, both in the embryo and postnatally. Long-term maintenance of progenitor identity suggests that SOX2- and SOX9-expressing cells are tissue stem cells, although these give rise to differentiated progeny infrequently in unchallenged adult animals. However, in situations where the pituitary is known to show plasticity, we show that adult pituitary stem cells can make a significant contribution to the pool of new endocrine cells generated in response to physiological demand. This represents a first step toward the use of pituitary stem cells to modulate endocrine output and treat deficits. We initially checked that the targeted alleles Sox2EGFP and Sox9iresGFP recapitulated SOX2 and SOX9 expression patterns, respectively, in the pituitary (Figures 1A and 1B ). We isolated SOX2-positive cells by FACS after dissociation of pituitaries from Sox2EGFP/+ mice (Ellis et al., 2004Ellis P. Fagan B.M. Magness S.T. Hutton S. Taranova O. Hayashi S. McMahon A. Rao M.

Neurosci. 2004; 26: 148-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar) (Figure 1C). We plated the EGFP-positive fraction and, in parallel, an equivalent number of pituitary EGFP-negative cells in sphere forming conditions. After 1 week in culture, only the EGFP-positive, SOX2-positive fraction contained pituispheres from which hormone-positive endocrine cells could be further differentiated (Figure 1G) (Andoniadou et al., 2012Andoniadou C.L. Gaston-Massuet C. Reddy R. Schneider R.P. Blasco M.A. Le Tissier P. Jacques T.S. Pevny L.H. Dattani M.T. Martinez-Barbera J.P. Identification of novel pathways involved in the pathogenesis of human adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma.Acta Neuropathol. 2012; 124: 259-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We also isolated SOX9-positive cells using Sox9iresGFP/iresGFP mice (Figure 1D) (Furuyama et al., 2011Furuyama K. Kawaguchi Y. Akiyama H. Horiguchi M. Kodama S. Kuhara T. Hosokawa S. Elbahrawy A. Soeda T. Koizumi M. et al.Continuous cell supply from a Sox9-expressing progenitor zone in adult liver, exocrine pancreas and intestine.Nat. Genet. 2011; 43: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Upon being plated, the GFP-positive fraction contained pituispheres that gave rise to endocrine cells (Figure 1F). A very small number of GFP+ve spheres was observed when the entire GFP-negative fraction was plated from either Sox2EGFP/+ or Sox9iresGFP/iresGFP mice (0.0035%, n = 2). It is most likely that these originate from cells that were not sorted appropriately. However, as we proposed previously, the spheres in the latter could come from SOX2+ve;SOX9−ve cells (Fauquier et al., 2008Fauquier T. Rizzoti K. Dattani M. Lovell-Badge R. Robinson I.C. SOX2-expressing progenitor cells generate all of the major cell types in the adult mouse pituitary gland.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 2907-2912Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Similarly the spheres in the SOX2-EGFP−ve fraction could come from SOX9+ve;SOX2−ve cells (Figure S1 available online). Our previous results (Fauquier et al., 2008Fauquier T. Rizzoti K. Dattani M. Lovell-Badge R. Robinson I.C. SOX2-expressing progenitor cells generate all of the major cell types in the adult mouse pituitary gland.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 2907-2912Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) showed that SOX9 only appeared after a few days in sphere cultures. This is in apparent contrast with the sphere-forming ability of the SOX9-IRES-GFP-positive fraction. We therefore further examined spheres derived from the latter, finding that SOX9 was downregulated, while GFP persists during early sphere formation, only to resume after 6–7 days (Figure S1). In conclusion, both SOX2- and SOX9-positive cells from the adult pituitary have sphere-forming ability, but during their initial formation the expression of the two proteins appears to recapitulate their embryonic pattern. During embryogenesis, SOX2 is expressed throughout RP at least from 10.5 days post coitum (dpc), while SOX9 starts to be faintly expressed in a few cells at 12.5 dpc and is then upregulated from 14.5 dpc until adulthood, when both proteins clearly colocalize (Figure S2 and Fauquier et al., 2008Fauquier T. Rizzoti K. Dattani M. Lovell-Badge R. Robinson I.C. SOX2-expressing progenitor cells generate all of the major cell types in the adult mouse pituitary gland.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 2907-2912Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In order to investigate the differentiation potential of these progenitors in vivo, we used Sox2CreERT2 (Arnold et al., 2011Arnold K. Sarkar A. Yram M.A. Polo J.M. Bronson R. Sengupta S. Seandel M. Geijsen N. Hochedlinger K.

Kawaguchi Y. Akiyama H. Horiguchi M. Kodama S. Kuhara T. Hosokawa S. Elbahrawy A. Soeda T. Koizumi M. et al.Continuous cell supply from a Sox9-expressing progenitor zone in adult liver, exocrine pancreas and intestine.Nat. Genet. 2011; 43: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). These were bred into mice carrying the Cre-reporter R26REYFP. Cre activity was induced with 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (4-OHT) in embryos at several stages and pituitaries harvested at 18.5 dpc, toward the end of gestation. When we induce Cre activity at 9.5 and 10.5 dpc or 11.5 and 12.5 dpc in Sox2CreERT2/+;R26REYFP/+ embryos, before or at the start of endocrine differentiation (Davis et al., 2011Davis S.W. Mortensen A.H. Camper S.A. Birthdating studies reshape models for pituitary gland cell specification.Dev. Biol. 2011; 352: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), we observe EYFP-positive cells in all endocrine lineages at the end of gestation (Figures 2A–2F). More precisely, when induction is performed at 11.5 and 12.5 dpc, 56% of EYFP+ve cells in the anterior lobe (excluding those in the cleft) are Pit-1 positive (representing somatrotrophs, lactotrophs, and thyrotrophs and their immediate progenitors), while 9% are adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) positive corticotrophs (Figure 2F, Table 1, and Table S1). We also observe luteinizing hormone (LH)- and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)-positive gonadotrophs within the SOX2 lineage, but because gonadotroph repartition is not homogenous in the gland (Budry et al., 2011Budry L. Lafont C. El Yandouzi T. Chauvet N. Conéjero G. Drouin J. Mollard P. Related pituitary cell lineages develop into interdigitated 3D cell networks.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 12515-12520Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), we cannot count the proportion of EYFP+ve cells that become gonadotrophs. Some EYFP+ve cells express SOX2 (16%, in the anterior lobe); moreover, the cleft also contains a significant proportion of EYFP+ve cells (but note that these are not included in the quantitative analysis). These cells are all hormone-negative, showing that not all progenitors differentiate and/or reflecting symmetric or asymmetric self-renewal divisions (Figure 2F). About 20% of EYFP-positive cells did not costain with Pit-1, ACTH, or SOX2. These are likely to be differentiating progenitors (for the gonadotroph and corticotroph lineages), gonadotrophs, and probably Pit-1-independent thyrotrophs.Table 1Lineage Tracing QuantificationNumber of EYFP+ve Cells CountedEYFP;∗SOX (Percent)EYFP;Pit-1 (Percent)EYFP;ACTH (Percent)Embryonic lineage tracingSOX2-CreERT2, induced at 11.5 and 12.5 dpc, harvested 18.5 dpc2426, n = 316, SD = 1.755.4, SD = 9.69.3, SD = 2.9SOX2-CreERT2, induced at 13.5 dpc, harvested 18.5 dpc684, n = 437, SD = 10EYFP;Pit-1-ACTH (Percent)SOX9-CreERT2, induced at 11.5 and 12.5 dpc, harvested 18.5 dpc677, n = 737, SD = 9.641.4, SD = 3.8EYFP;LH (Percent)EYFP;ACTH (Percent)EYFP;PRL (Percent)Postnatal lineage tracingSOX2-CreERT2, induced at P0/P2, harvested at 4 weeks4106, n = 435, SD = 3.239, SD = 5.63.2, SD = 0.70.9, SD = 1.2SOX2-CreERT2, induced at P0/P2, harvested at 8 weeks987, n = 242, SD = 2.56.7, SD = 0.2SOX9-CreERT2, induced at P0/P2, harvested at 4 weeks1897, n = 849, SD = 8.434, SD = 4.30.9 (n = 1)7, SD = 7.3EYFP;SOX9;SOX2+ve (Percent) within EYFP;SOX9EYFP;SOX9;SOX2−ve (Percent) within EYFP;SOX9EYFP;Pit-1 (Percent)Adult lineage tracingSOX9-CreERT2, induced at 8 weeks, harvested at 6 to 12 months436, n = 587, SD = 9.899, SD = 0.2 (n = 2)1.15, SD = 0.2 (n = 2)2 (n = 1)Double or triple immunofluorescence was performed for EYFP and progenitor or endocrine markers.

We next used the Sox9ires-CreERT2/+ animals and noticed an obvious reduction in recombination efficiency compared to Sox2CreERT2 (Figure S2). While it is clear that there are many more SOX2- than SOX9-positive cells at early stages (12.5 dpc), even when induction is performed later (13.5 dpc), when both proteins are coexpressed, or in the adult (see below), Sox2-CreERT2 is more efficient. This may reflect low expression levels of SOX9 compared to SOX2 in the pituitary or a difference in expression or activity of the CreERT2 cassette. Moreover, because CreERT2 replaces the SOX2 open reading frame (ORF) in Sox2CreERT2/+ animals (Arnold et al., 2011Arnold K. Sarkar A. Yram M.A. Polo J.M. Bronson R. Sengupta S. Seandel M. Geijsen N. Hochedlinger K. Sox2(+) adult stem and progenitor cells are important for tissue regeneration and survival of mice.Cell Stem Cell. 2011; 9: 317-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar), one copy of Sox2 is missing. This is known to affect pituitary development and function (Kelberman et al., 2006Kelberman D. Rizzoti K. Avilion A. Bitner-Glindzicz M. Cianfarani S. Collins J. Chong W.K. Kirk J.M. Achermann J.C. Ross R. et al.Mutations within Sox2/SOX2 are associated with abnormalities in the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis in mice and humans.J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 2442-2455PubMed Google Scholar). Although the phenotype is mild and affects all hormonal cell types, this may also account for some quantitative differences seen between the two Cre drivers. In contrast, CreERT2 was inserted following an IRES into the Sox9 3′UTR because SOX9 heterozygosity is lethal (Soeda et al., 2010Soeda T. Deng J.M. de Crombrugghe B. Behringer R.R. Nakamura T. Akiyama H. Sox9-expressing precursors are the cellular origin of the cruciate ligament of the knee joint and the limb tendons.Genesis. 2010; 48: 635-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Translation following an IRES is often less efficient compared to that initiated from the endogenous transcript. Nevertheless, the lower recombination efficiency is beneficial for clonal analysis and SOX9-IRES-CreERT2 appears to be an ideal tool to perform lineage tracing in the pituitary. When we induce Cre activity in Sox9ires-CreERT2/+;R26REYFP/+ embryos at 11.5 and 12.5 dpc, we also observe EYFP-positive cells in all lineages (Figures 2G–2L, Table 1, and Table S1). More precisely, we mainly observe EYFP-positive cells in the Pit-1 lineage and in some rare corticotrophs (together representing 41% of the EYFP+ve cells). We very rarely observe EYFP+ve gonadotrophs. This is likely explained by both the lower recombination efficiency and the fact that LH- and FSH-positive cells represent a relatively small population. Finally, a significant percentage of EYFP+ve cells still express SOX9 at 18.5 dpc (36%). Again a proportion of cells (about 20%) are not costained by Pit-1, ACTH, or SOX9. Comparing the two lineage tracing methods, there is a significant reduction in differentiated progeny when using Sox9 rather than Sox2 to drive CreERT2 (41.4% versus 64.7% Pit-1/ACTH cells) and a corresponding increase in progenitors (36.8% versus 16%, respectively). It is very likely that EYFP+ve cells observed with the former are induced later than with the latter, as SOX2 is already strongly expressed at 11.5 dpc, while SOX9 expression only becomes significant at 14.5 dpc. Progenitor cell cycle exit in the pituitary has been shown to occur for all endocrine populations mainly between 11.5 and 13.5 dpc (Davis et al., 2011Davis S.W. Mortensen A.H. Camper S.A. Birthdating studies reshape models for pituitary gland cell specification.Dev. Biol. 2011; 352: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Therefore lineage tracing performed at the end, and/or after this phase, as would happen with Sox9ires-CreERT2, should give rise to fewer differentiated progeny, and, in consequence, increased retention of the lineage marker in progenitors. To verify this hypothesis, we gave 4-OHT to Sox2CreERT2/+;R26REYFP/+ embryos at 13.5 dpc, and observed a higher percentage of EYFP;SOX2 double-positive cells (37%, Figure 2M, Table 1, and Table S1), comparable to that obtained with Sox9ires-CreERT2. Taken together, these results show that SOX2- and SOX9-positive precursors differentiate into endocrine cells in the developing pituitary, and moreover, that they are in agreement with birth-dating data showing that progenitors differentiate more efficiently before 13.5 dpc (Davis et al., 2011Davis S.W. Mortensen A.H. Camper S.A. Birthdating studies reshape models for pituitary gland cell specification.Dev. Biol. 2011; 352: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). When Cre activity is induced in Sox2CreERT2/+;R26REYFP/+ embryos before 13.5 dpc, at a time prior to the onset of SOX9 expression, a greater proportion of progenitors differentiate compared to its later induction, after SOX9 is upregulated and when Cre activity can first be induced in Sox9ires-CreERT2/+;R26REYFP/+embryos (Figure 2N). It has been proposed that embryonic and adult progenitors derive from distinct cell populations, because lineage tracing using a NestinCre transgene only gave rise to significant endocrine progeny postnatally (Gleiberman et al., 2008Gleiberman A.S. Michurina T. Encinas J.M. Roig J.L. Krasnov P. Balordi F. Fishell G. Rosenfeld M.G. Enikolopov G. Genetic approaches identify adult pituitary stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 6332-6337Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we induced Cre activity in Sox2CreERT2/+;R26REYFP/+ (13.5 dpc) and Sox9ires-CreERT2/+;R26REYFP/+ (11.5 dpc) embryos and harvested pituitaries from newborns and adults. Most of the labeled cell progeny had differentiated (data not shown), but we were able to detect, in both sets of samples, EYFP;SOX2;SOX9-triple-positive cells (Figures 2K and 2L). More precisely, in both Sox2CreERT2/+;R26REYFP/+ (n = 2, SD = 1.5; 8 and 17 weeks) and Sox9ires-CreERT2/+;R26REYFP/+ (n = 3, SD = 2.5; 8 to 26 weeks) pituitaries, an average of 3% of EYFP-positive cells remained SOX2- and SOX9-positive, respectively, in the anterior lobe (excluding the cleft). Therefore, in agreement with recent data for other SOX2+ve progenitors in various adult epithelial tissues (Arnold et al., 2011Arnold K. Sarkar A. Yram M.A. Polo J.M. Bronson R. Sengupta S. Seandel M. Geijsen N. Hochedlinger K. Sox2(+) adult stem and progenitor cells are important for tissue regeneration and survival of mice.Cell Stem Cell. 2011; 9: 317-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar), a proportion of embryonic SOX2;SOX9-positive progenitors remain undifferentiated and maintain their identity until adulthood. The murine pituitary is characterized by a phase of rapid growth postnatally to reach its adult size. Differentiated endocrine cells are known to proliferate during this phase (Kominami et al., 2003Kominami R. Yasutaka S. Taniguchi Y. Shinohara H. Proliferating cells in the rat anterior pituitary during the postnatal period: immunoelectron microscopic observations using monoclonal anti-bromodeoxyuridine antibody.Histochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 120: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We decided to study the contribution of SOX2+ve and SOX9+ve cells during this period by inducing Cre activity in newborns and analyzing pituitaries at 4 weeks (Figure 3). As observed in embryos, recombination is much less efficient in Sox9ires-CreERT2/+;R26REYFP/+ versus Sox2CreERT2/+;R26REYFP/+ animals. While we routinely counted more than 200 EYFP+ve cells/animal/hormone for Sox2CreERT2/+;R26REYFP/+ samples, for Sox9ires-CreERT2/+;R26REYFP/+ we typically were only able to count 50 to 100 cells (Table 1 and Table S1). Using Sox2CreERT2, we mainly observed colocalization of EYFP with LH+ve (and FSH, data not shown) gonadotrophs (39%, Table 1). ACTH+ve;EYFP+ve cells were detected at a lower frequency (3.2%), and while EYFP+ve lactotrophs, somatotrophs, and thyrotrophs were present, they were rare (<1%). A large proportion of EYFP+ve cells were SOX2+ve (35%), suggesting that they were the products of self-renewal divisions (Figures 3A–3F). In 8-week-old animals, a similar percentage of EYFP;LH- and EYFP;ACTH-double-positive cells are still present (Table 1 and Table S1). A proportion of EYFP+ve cells (about 20%, as estimated from double staining, and confirmed in one animal by triple EYFP;SOX2;ACTH-LH staining, data not shown) appears to be negative for both SOX2 and LH;ACTH. These cells comprise a small percentage of prolactin (PRL)-, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)-, and growth hormone (GH)-positive cells as well as others that are presumably differentiating and not yet expressing hormones. Using Sox9ires-CreERT2, we also detected EYFP mainly in LH+ve (and FSH+ve) gonadotrophs (34%) (Table 1, Table S1, and data not shown) and in some lactotrophs. In one animal where recombination was particularly efficient, we were able to detect a few GH+ve;EYFP+ve and ACTH+ve;EYFP+ve cells. A significant percentage of the EYFP+ve cells still expressed SOX9 (50%), higher than that observed with Sox2CreERT2 (Figures 3G–3L). The percentage of EYFP+ve gonadotrophs remained high in 8-week-old animals (24%; n = 2, SD = 9.8, 1 female and 1 male). A proportion of EYFP+ve cells were not identified, but these were less frequent compared to those seen in Sox2CreERT2 lineage tracing experiments. With triple staining (EYFP;SOX9;LH-PRL, n = 3), about 10% of EYFP+ve cells were not identified (Figure 3L). We suspected that the prominent differentiation toward gonadotroph fate at these stages could be due to the estrogen (E2) receptor modulator tamoxifen. We therefore counted gonadotrophs in tamoxifen- versus oil-treated animals and observed many more in the former (Figure S3), which provides an explanation for the high percentage of LH-positive cells in the progeny of both SOX2- and SOX9-positive progenitors. In summary, SOX2+ve and SOX9+ve progenitors can differentiate into all endocrine cell lineages postnatally. Despite the fact that"

For the best-studied case, ocular dominance plasticity in primary visual cortex in response to monocular deprivation (MD), the maturation of inhibition is necessary and sufficient. How does inhibition open the CP? We present a theory: the transition from pre-CP to CP plasticity arises because inhibition preferentially suppresses responses to spontaneous relative to visually driven input activity, switching learning cues from internal to external sources. This differs from previous proposals in (1) arguing that the CP can open without changes in plasticity mechanisms when activity patterns become more sensitive to sensory experience through circuit development, and (2) explaining not simply a transition from no plasticity to plasticity, but a change in outcome of MD-induced plasticity from pre-CP to CP. More broadly, hierarchical organization of sensory-motor pathways may develop through a cascade of CPs induced as circuit maturation progresses from ""lower"" to ""higher"" cortical areas."

Chem. 2000; 275: 41369-41376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This binding domain can compete with full-length eIF4G for binding to eIF3, implying that this region is indeed sufficient for binding eIF3 (11Korneeva N.L. Lamphear B.J. Hennigan F.L. Rhoads R.E. Mutually cooperative binding of eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF) 3 and eIF4A to human eIF4G-1.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41369-41376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The importance of this interaction for translation has been investigated by in vitro and in vivo translation assays using an eIF4G construct containing a quadruple alanine mutation in the eIF3 binding domain (17Hinton T.M. Coldwell M.J. Carpenter G.A. Morley S.J. Pain V.M. Functional analysis of individual binding activities of the scaffold protein eIF4G.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1695-1708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This study showed that the mutant is less active in stimulating translation in a protease treated in vitro reticulocyte lysate system (17Hinton T.M. Coldwell M.J. Carpenter G.A. Morley S.J. Pain V.M. Functional analysis of individual binding activities of the scaffold protein eIF4G.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1695-1708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In contrast, there is little difference between the ability of this mutant eIF4G protein to stimulate translation in vivo compared with wild type eIF4G (17Hinton T.M. Coldwell M.J. Carpenter G.A. Morley S.J. Pain V.M. Functional analysis of individual binding activities of the scaffold protein eIF4G.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1695-1708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It is difficult to interpret the full effect of this particular mutation on translation since no quantitative binding data has been generated to determine its effect on the affinity between eIF4G and eIF3. Nevertheless, these data may imply that a substantial amount of redundancy exists between initiation factor interactions. Therefore, it is reasonable to believe that no single interaction is essential for mRNA recruitment to the 40S subunit. Because of its large molecular mass and complexity, it has been difficult to identify the exact binding site of eIF4G on the eIF3 complex. Human eIF3 possesses an anthropomorphic five-lobed structure that contains 13 non-identical subunits that range in size from ∼25 kDa to 170 kDa (18Damoc E. Fraser C.S. Zhou M. Videler H. Mayeur G.L.

It has been shown that eIF4G makes a direct interaction with the eIF3e subunit within the context of the eIF3 complex (23LeFebvre A.K. Korneeva N.L. Trutschl M. Cvek U. Duzan R.D. Bradley C.A. Hershey J.W. Rhoads R.E. Translation initiation factor eIF4G-1 binds to eIF3 through the eIF3e subunit.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22917-22932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To determine this, an affinity tagged minimum eIF3 binding region of eIF4G was used as bait to fish out eIF3 subunit fragments from a partially proteolyzed eIF3 complex. One limitation of this approach is that it does not rule out the possibility that other eIF3 subunits may be important in stabilizing the interaction with eIF4G when eIF3 is not proteolyzed. Here, we have employed an anisotropy assay to quantitatively show that human eIF4G binds to eIF3 independently of eIF4A. To further characterize the eIF4G-binding surface in eIF3, we have employed two different cross-linking approaches that utilize a minimum binding domain in eIF4G and intact purified eIF3. Our data reveal that three subunits of eIF3 (eIF3c, -d, and -e) form a binding surface for eIF4G. We further show that the previously identified eIF3-binding domain in eIF4G is comprised of two distinct subdomains that interact with these eIF3 subunits. Finally, we use an eIF4G-dependent reticulocyte lysate system to show that both of these subdomains are required to stimulate translation initiation in vitro. The numbering of eIF4G constructs used in this work is based on UniProt entry Q04637, although our constructs contain a glutamine insertion between residues 696 and 697 that corresponds to an isoform no longer included in this database. Recombinant eIF4G constructs shown in Fig. 1 contain an N-terminal 6X-HIS-MBP tag (eIF4G711–1104) or 6×-HIS tag (eIF4G1011–1104) and C-terminal FLAG tag. Additionally, 6 native cysteine residues are mutated to alanine in eIF4G711–1104 to prevent interference during labeling. A single cysteine mutation is incorporated into both constructs at S1041 for site-specific modification. These mutations do not affect eIF3 or eIF4A binding in either construct (data not shown). The eIF4G constructs used in the boxB tethered assay are N-terminally tagged with 6×-HIS and the 22 amino acid sequence of the bacteriophage λ transcription anti-terminator protein N (λ) that binds the boxB RNA hairpin (14De Gregorio E.

For expression, eIF4G constructs in pET28c are transformed into BL-21(DE3) Escherichia coli cells. Typically, 2–4 liters of BL-21(DE3) cells are grown to an OD of 0.4–0.6 in LB media, and induced with 0.5 μg/ml isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 3–5 h at 30 °C. Cells are centrifuged at 4 °C for 20 min at 4000 × g, suspended in buffer A (Buffer A: 20 mm Hepes pH 7.5, 400 mm KCl, 5 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, 10 mm BME) and then lysed using a microfluidizer as described previously (5Özes A.R.

The eluted protein is incubated with TEV protease to remove MBP during overnight dialysis at 4 °C in buffer B (buffer B: 20 mm Hepes pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT). Further purification is achieved using Mono S (10/10) (eIF4G1011–1104 and λ-eIF4G), or HiTrap Heparin HP (eIF4G711–1104 and λ-eIF4G) columns (GE Healthcare), as previously described (5Özes A.R.

For each of these constructs, we purified ∼1 mg protein per liter of culture. HeLa cell cytosolic extracts were a kind gift from Dr. Robert Tjian (University of California, Berkeley). Human eIF3 is purified as previously described from HeLa cytosolic extracts (18Damoc E. Fraser C.S. Zhou M. Videler H. Mayeur G.L. Hershey J.W. Doudna J.A. Robinson C.V. Leary J.A.

Human eIF4G711–1104 is modified with fluorescein-5-malemide and eIF4G1011–1104 is modified with the photoactivatable cross-linker Sulfo-NHS-Diazirine (SDA) (Thermo Scientific) for fluorescence polarization and cross-linking assays, respectively. All eIF4G proteins are first dialyzed for 2 h at 4 °C into buffer C (buffer C: 20 Hepes, 300 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm TCEP). eIF4G (∼35 μm) is then incubated with a 20-fold molar excess of fluorescein-5-malemide or SDA at room temperature for 30 min. Excess modification compounds are removed by dialysis or by purifying labeled proteins using HiTrap Heparin HP or SP-Sepharose columns (GE Healthcare). EZ view Red Anti-FLAG M2 Affinity Gel (30 μl)(Sigma-Aldrich) is washed twice in 500 μl of buffer D (buffer D: 20 mm Hepes pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.5 mm DTT). Resin is then incubated with 10 μg of recombinant eIF4G for at least 1 h in 50 μl of buffer D, washed twice in 100 μl buffer E (buffer E: 20 mm Hepes pH 7.5, 200 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm DTT, and 0.5% TritonX-100) and once in 100 μl of buffer D. Human eIF4A (10 μg) or eIF3 (10 μg) is diluted in 30 μl of buffer D then added and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The resin is then washed four times in 75 μl of buffer E. Bound proteins are eluted by incubating the resin in 20 μl, 250 ng/μl FLAG peptide in buffer D for 1 h at 4 °C. Coimmuniprecipitated proteins are separated by SDS-PAGE then stained with Coomassie Blue or analyzed by immunoblotting with specific antiserum, as indicated in the figures. Fluorescence polarization is measured in a Victor X5 Multilabel Plate Reader (Perkin Elmer), similar to previously published studies (25Maag D. Lorsch J.R.

Each binding reaction is set up in buffer D and allowed to reach equilibrium at 30 °C for 5 min prior to fluorescence polarization measurements. Reactions contained 10 nm eIF4G-Fl, an eIF3 concentration in the range of 0–1.5 μm, and were conducted in the presence or absence of 1 μm eIF4A, which is a saturating amount based on previously published affinity data (28Korneeva N.L.

The figures show representative experiments. The transcription template for the BoxB tethered assay is a derivative of our previously described template, and was purchased from GenScript (10Feoktistova K. Tuvshintogs E. Do A. Fraser C.S.

The 5′-UTR, which is located between XhoI and HindIII restriction sites (underlined), has been replaced with the human beta globin 5′-UTR sequence as follows: CTCGAGACATTTGCTTCTGACACAACTGTGTTCACTAGCAACCTCAAACAGACACCAAGCTT. The template is transcribed in vitro and purified using phenol-chloroform extraction following standard protocols. Functional assays are carried out in 20-μl reactions containing 65% nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate, 20 μm amino acid mixture minus leucine (Promega), 20 μm amino acid mixture minus methionine (Promega), 0.8 units/μl Recombinant RNasin Ribonuclease Inhibitor (Promega), 45 mm potassium chloride, 115 mm potassium acetate, 1.7 mm magnesium acetate, 0.5 μm uncapped RNA template, and 1 μm λ-eIF4G. Reactions are incubated at 30 °C for 30 min prior to luminescence measurement for 10 s on the Victor X5 Multilabel Plate Reader (Perkin Elmer) by addition of Renilla luciferase substrate (Promega), as described previously (10Feoktistova K. Tuvshintogs E. Do A. Fraser C.S. Human eIF4E promotes mRNA restructuring by stimulating eIF4A helicase activity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The benzophenone cross-linker, in the form of p-Benzoylphenylalanine (Bpa; BaChem), is incorporated into recombinant eIF4G1011–1104 using the pEVOL plasmid that was kindly provided by Dr. Peter Schultz (The Scripps Research Institute) (29Young T.S. Ahmad I. Yin J.A. Schultz P.G. An enhanced system for unnatural amino acid mutagenesis in E. coli.J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 395: 361-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Single amber codon (TAG) mutations are introduced throughout the length of eIF4G1011–1104 through PCR site-directed mutagenesis at intervals of ∼10 amino acids. Amino acid substitutions are designated in the text by the single letter code for the endogenous residue, followed by the residue number and an “X” to indicate the amber mutant codon and location of Bpa incorporation. eIF4G amber mutant plasmids are cotransformed into BL-21(DE3) E. coli cells with pEVOL, which contains the orthogonal tRNA and tRNA synthetase pair required for Bpa incorporation at amber stop codons (29Young T.S.

Cells are grown to A600 = 0.4–0.6, and protein expression is induced with 0.5 μg/ml IPTG, 0.02 mm arabinose, and 0.2 mm Bpa for 4 h at 30 °C or overnight at 16 °C. eIF4G-Bpa proteins are purified in the same way as unmodified eIF4G1011–1104. All amber mutants are expressed either as a mix of full-length eIF4G1011–1104 (with Bpa incorporation) and truncations of this construct (due to termination at the amber stop codon), or only the truncation product. These are successfully separated using ion exchange chromatography, as described for the unmodified protein. Only 6 amber mutant sites of the 10 cloned resulted in expressible full-length constructs. Successful sites expressed and purified include: M1011X, R1031X, S1041X, S1061X, K1071X, and W1093X. When Bpa is omitted from the expression media, only truncated forms of eIF4G1011–1104 are expressed. For each eIF4G-Bpa construct expressed, we purified ∼200–600 μg of protein per liter of culture. Cross-linking reactions are typically carried out in 20 μl incubations in clear, thin-wall PCR tubes. Each reaction contains 2.5 μm eIF4G1011–1104-SDA and 0.5 μm eIF3 or 2.5 μm eIF4G1011–1104-Bpa and 0.25 μm eIF3 in buffer D, unless otherwise stated. Following preincubation at 30 °C for 5 min, cross-linking is carried out using the 365 nm UV light from a AlphaImager HP gel imaging device (Cell Biosciences) for 5 min at room temperature, except in time course studies where the UV exposure time is as indicated. Cross-linked products are separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with antiserum as indicated. Cross-linked products are transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore) using a Mini Trans-Blot Cell or the Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer System (Bio-Rad). Blots are incubated with primary antibodies diluted in TBST for 1.5 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Primary antibodies used in this study include: mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma-Aldrich), rabbit anti-eIF3b (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-28857), rabbit anti-eIF3c (produced by Christopher Fraser), mouse anti-eIF3c (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-74507), mouse anti-eIF3d (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-271515), rabbit anti-eIF3l (Abcam, PAB17471), mouse anti-eIF3e (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-74505), and rabbit anti-eIF3f (Abcam ab74568). Blots are washed three times for 10 min each in TBST, followed by 1-hour incubation at room temperature with appropriate secondary antibodies. Secondary antibodies are HRP-conjugated (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in cross-linking time course and competition experiments (Fig. 2) or fluorescently labeled with DyLight 800 or DyLight 680 (Thermo Scientific) in all other experiments. Blots are visualized using a Storm 860 Imager (Molecular Dynamics) for HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies or the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor) for fluorescent secondary antibodies. To quantitatively determine if eIF4G binding to eIF3 is regulated by eIF4A in the absence of the 40S ribosomal subunit, we optimized an anisotropy-based equilibrium-binding assay that utilizes highly purified components. To this end, we generated a FLAG-tagged recombinant eIF4G truncation spanning amino acids 711 to 1104 (eIF4G711–1104), which includes the central eIF4A and eIF3 binding sites (Fig. 1A). To fluorescently modify this eIF4G truncation, we genetically encoded a single cysteine (S1041C) into the protein so that it can be site-specifically modified with fluorescein. To verify that this single cysteine eIF4G construct binds to eIF4A and eIF3 we employed a coimmunoprecipitation assay, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Both eIF4A and eIF3 interact specifically with the FLAG-tagged eIF4G711–1104 truncation (Fig. 1, B and D). Removal of the eIF3 binding domain (eIF4G711–1001) does not prevent eIF4A binding, but completely abolishes eIF3 binding (Fig. 1, B and D). Consistent with this and previous data (11Korneeva N.L.

https://openalex.org/W2080010608,"Perturbations of cell surface synapse-organizing proteins, particularly α-neurexins, contribute to neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. From an unbiased screen, we identify calsyntenin-3 (alcadein-β) as a synapse-organizing protein unique in binding and recruiting α-neurexins, but not β-neurexins. Calsyntenin-3 is present in many pyramidal neurons throughout cortex and hippocampus but is most highly expressed in interneurons. The transmembrane form of calsyntenin-3 can trigger excitatory and inhibitory presynapse differentiation in contacting axons. However, calsyntenin-3-shed ectodomain, which represents about half the calsyntenin-3 pool in brain, suppresses the ability of multiple α-neurexin partners including neuroligin 2 and LRRTM2 to induce presynapse differentiation. Clstn3−/− mice show reductions in excitatory and inhibitory synapse density by confocal and electron microscopy and corresponding deficits in synaptic transmission. These results identify calsyntenin-3 as an α-neurexin-specific binding partner required for normal functional GABAergic and glutamatergic synapse development."

Although it has also been shown to modulate the fine-tuning of locomotion (Kahsai et al., 2010Kahsai L. Martin J.R. Winther A.M. Neuropeptides in the Drosophila central complex in modulation of locomotor behavior.J. Exp. Biol. 2010; 213: 2256-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), a role for sNPF in sleep has not been identified. In a screen to test the role of different peptidergic neurons in the adult brain, we identified sNPF-expressing neurons as potently sleep promoting. We found that the s-LNv clock neurons are part of this sNPF-expressing sleep-promoting circuit, and the wake-promoting l-LNvs are a postsynaptic target. sNPF has very different effects on feeding circuits, suggesting that the role of sNPF in feeding is more indirect and unrelated to its acute sleep-promoting effects. To test the role of different subsets of adult brain peptidergic neurons in sleep (Figure 1A), we used the warmth-activated dTRPA1 cation channel to acutely activate nine different peptidergic neuron classes (Hamada et al., 2008Hamada F.N. Rosenzweig M. Kang K. Pulver S.R. Ghezzi A. Jegla T.J. Garrity P.A. An internal thermal sensor controlling temperature preference in Drosophila.Nature. 2008; 454: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). Because environmental light affects Drosophila sleep behaviors (Shang et al., 2011Shang Y. Haynes P. Pírez N. Harrington K.I. Guo F. Pollack J. Hong P. Griffith L.C. Rosbash M. Imaging analysis of clock neurons reveals light buffers the wake-promoting effect of dopamine.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), we assayed activation under both light-dark (LD) and dark-dark (DD) conditions. To our surprise, most peptidergic neurons, including those that express NPF, do not affect sleep under either condition (Figure 1A). Neurons expressing DMS or DILP only affect sleep in LD conditions, and neurons expressing SIFa or CCAP only in DD conditions. This context-dependence may indicate that these neurons only affect sleep indirectly by changing other internal physiological states. The only condition-independent cell group was the short-form NPY-like peptide sNPF, which led to a dramatic increase in quiescence in both LD and DD conditions (Figures 1A and 1B). High-resolution computer video tracking confirmed the results obtained with the DAM system (Donelson et al., 2012Donelson N.C. Kim E.Z. Slawson J.B. Vecsey C.G. Huber R. Griffith L.C. High-resolution positional tracking for long-term analysis of Drosophila sleep and locomotion using the “tracker” program.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e37250Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar; Figure S6 available online). Upon inactivation of dTRPA1 at 21°C, these effects were rapidly reversed, and the mean duration of quiescent episodes decreased (Figure 1B; Figure S6B). Remarkably, flies slept even less after reversal of dTRPA1 activation, i.e., they manifested negative sleep rebound (Figure 1B, purple arrow; Figure S6B green arrows), suggesting that the observed quiescence is really sleep and that this state can be homeostatically regulated in both directions (Hendricks et al., 2000Hendricks J.C. Finn S.M. Panckeri K.A. Chavkin J. Williams J.A. Sehgal A. Pack A.I. Rest in Drosophila is a sleep-like state.Neuron. 2000; 25: 129-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar, Shaw et al., 2000Shaw P.J. Cirelli C. Greenspan R.J. Tononi G. Correlates of sleep and waking in Drosophila melanogaster.Science. 2000; 287: 1834-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). Importantly, excess quiescence is not due to a loss of ability to engage in locomotor activity. Quantitative analysis of single fly behavior showed similar or even slightly higher locomotor activity during periods when flies were awake (Figure 1C; Figure S6B). We also directly tested locomotion within 2 hr after the temperature shift by tapping vials and assaying negative geotaxis behavior. Although at this time point sNPFGAL4:dTRPA1 flies already showed increased quiescence due to activation of sNPF-expressing neurons, they still rapidly climbed to the top of the vials when stimulated (Movie S1). However, most flies were not responsive to the initial tap compared with controls 3 days after the shift (data not shown). Consistent with an increased sensory/arousal threshold, these flies required several taps but then climbed with a similar speed (Movie S2). Moreover, flies with activated sNPF neurons still exhibited spontaneous circadian-related locomotor activity in both LD and DD conditions (Figure 1B, green arrows; see Figure S1 for locomotor analyses). This indicates that the locomotor circuitry is intact because it can be accessed by the circadian clock. Finally, release from dTRPA1 activation reversed the increased locomotor activity observed during waking periods (Figure S6B, blue arrows). This indicates that the negative sleep rebound is not due to an increased intensity of locomotor activity. To investigate if the activity of sNPF neurons is required to maintain normal sleep, we silenced these neurons by coexpressing the Kir2.1 potassium channel (Nitabach et al., 2002Nitabach M.N. Blau J. Holmes T.C. Electrical silencing of Drosophila pacemaker neurons stops the free-running circadian clock.Cell. 2002; 109: 485-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). To restrict the silencing to adults, tubulin-GAL80ts was used to block expression of UAS-kir2.1 until adulthood (McGuire et al., 2003McGuire S.E. Le P.T. Osborn A.J. Matsumoto K. Davis R.L. Spatiotemporal rescue of memory dysfunction in Drosophila.Science. 2003; 302: 1765-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). After a temperature shift to release the GAL80 block, sleep levels and the mean duration of sleep bouts during the daytime were significantly reduced (Figure 2A). In contrast, control flies manifested a temperature-driven increase in daytime sleep. Given the potency with which the sNPF-expressing neurons promote sleep, their activity should be regulated if they are part of normal sleep-promoting circuits. Because GABAergic neurons can function in wake promotion by GABAA-mediated suppression of sleep-promoting regions (Y.S. and M.R., unpublished data; P. Haynes and L.C.G., unpublished data; Hassani et al., 2009Hassani O.K. Lee M.G. Henny P. Jones B.E. Discharge profiles of identified GABAergic in comparison to cholinergic and putative glutamatergic basal forebrain neurons across the sleep-wake cycle.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 11828-11840Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), we knocked down the Rdl GABAA receptor in sNPF neurons. This indeed led to significant increases in both daytime and total sleep time as well as to longer sleep bouts, suggesting that sNPF neuron activation is normally attenuated by GABAA signaling (Figure 2B). To determine if the sleep-promoting function of these neurons is due to the release of sNPF itself, we examined sNPFc00448 mutant flies, which have a more than 50% reduction of sNPF mRNA (Lee et al., 2008Lee K.S. Kwon O.Y. Lee J.H. Kwon K. Min K.J. Jung S.A. Kim A.K. You K.H. Tatar M. Yu K. Drosophila short neuropeptide F signalling regulates growth by ERK-mediated insulin signalling.Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 468-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). These flies showed significant reductions of both daytime and nighttime sleep (Figure 2C). Sleep was also fragmented because the mean duration of sleep bouts was reduced by more than 50% (Figure 2C). Sleep was sensitive to gene dosage because heterozygous flies had intermediate phenotypes compared to control and homozygous flies (Figure 2C), although statistical significance for the gene dosage effect was only reached in the case of nighttime sleep. Sleep was also assayed in animals with an adult-specific knockdown of sNPF mRNA in adult brains. Both total sleep and nighttime sleep were significantly reduced (Figure 2D). Daytime sleep was also more fragmented, although the amount of daytime sleep was unaffected (Figure 2D). While the dTrpA1 activation strategy cannot rule out a role for a cotransmitter, these two independent methods of reducing sNPF levels also support a sleep-promoting function for the sNPF peptide in the adult fly. To test the idea that sNPF neuron activation might affect the sleep homeostat and therefore interfere with the effects of mechanical sleep deprivation (SD), we activated these neurons during traditional mechanical SD. The SD protocol was standard, with the exception that sNPFGAL4:dTRPA1 and control strains were heated to 27°C during the 12 hr of deprivation to activate sNPF neurons and then returned to 21°C after the deprivation, at the end of the night (Figure 3). During the mechanical SD, the sNPFGAL4:dTRPA1 strain appeared indistinguishable from the control strains, i.e., it manifested no sleep during these 12 hr as expected. This reflects true locomotor arousal because DAM data from unconscious or dead flies can be distinguished from live moving animals (Figure S2). Remarkably, however, this strain produced much less sleep rebound or recovery sleep after the deprivation than the control strains upon the return to 21°C. This can be seen both in comparisons of recovery day sleep levels of SD flies to non-SD flies (Figure 3B) and by comparison of the sleep of SD flies on the recovery day to their own pre-SD day sleep levels (Figure 3C). We conclude that activation of sNPF neurons during mechanical SD caused at least a partial sleep-like state, which was invisible with standard locomotor activity monitoring but could be interpreted by the sleep homeostat as genuine sleep. Another possibility is that sNPF provides a direct signal to the homeostat to indicate that sleep has occurred. sNPFGAL4 drives strong expression in many brain regions, including the MB, the PI and the FSB in the CC (Johard et al., 2008Johard H.A. Enell L.E. Gustafsson E. Trifilieff P. Veenstra J.A. Nässel D.R. Intrinsic neurons of Drosophila mushroom bodies express short neuropeptide F: relations to extrinsic neurons expressing different neurotransmitters.J. Comp. Neurol. 2008; 507: 1479-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We used multiple strategies to test the involvement of the MB because it is a previously identified sleep-promoting region (Joiner et al., 2006Joiner W.J. Crocker A. White B.H. Sehgal A. Sleep in Drosophila is regulated by adult mushroom bodies.Nature. 2006; 441: 757-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, Pitman et al., 2006Pitman J.L. McGill J.J. Keegan K.P. Allada R. A dynamic role for the mushroom bodies in promoting sleep in Drosophila.Nature. 2006; 441: 753-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) Addition of a MB-GAL80 transgene blocked the expression of dTRPA1 in the MB without affecting the sleep-promoting effect of sNPFGAL4:dTRPA1 flies (Figures S3B and S3E). The converse experiment, activation of just the MB-specific subset of sNPF-GAL4 cells using an intersectional strategy (Shang et al., 2008Shang Y. Griffith L.C. Rosbash M. Light-arousal and circadian photoreception circuits intersect at the large PDF cells of the Drosophila brain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 19587-19594Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), also did not produce a sleep phenotype (Figure S3E). Although the PI has also been shown to be involved in sleep (Crocker et al., 2010Crocker A. Shahidullah M. Levitan I.B. Sehgal A.

Neurosci. 2007; 10: 1160-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), direct activation of subsets of the PI did not significantly increase total sleep in a state-independent manner (Figure 1A: DILP2-, CRZ-, SIFa-, and DMS-GAL4). Additionally, subdivision of the sNPF-GAL4 pattern with different GAL80s demonstrated no correlation of the sleep phenotype with PI or MB expression (Figures S3C–S3E). Therefore, most sleep-promoting sNPF neurons likely reside outside these two regions. We then assayed PDF-expressing clock neurons. The 8 PDF+ small ventral lateral neurons (s-LNvs) are labeled by sNPF-GAL4 and have recently been shown to express sNPF (Johard et al., 2009Johard H.A. Yoishii T. Dircksen H. Cusumano P. Rouyer F. Helfrich-Förster C. Nässel D.R. Peptidergic clock neurons in Drosophila: ion transport peptide and short neuropeptide F in subsets of dorsal and ventral lateral neurons.J. Comp. Neurol. 2009; 516: 59-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Moreover, sNPF mRNA is one of the most strongly cycling transcripts in the s-LNvs (Kula-Eversole et al., 2010Kula-Eversole E. Nagoshi E. Shang Y. Rodriguez J. Allada R. Rosbash M. Surprising gene expression patterns within and between PDF-containing circadian neurons in Drosophila.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 13497-13502Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). As the 10 neighboring cells, the PDF+ wake-promoting large ventral lateral neurons (l-LNvs), express little or no sNPF (Johard et al., 2009Johard H.A. Yoishii T. Dircksen H. Cusumano P. Rouyer F. Helfrich-Förster C. Nässel D.R. Peptidergic clock neurons in Drosophila: ion transport peptide and short neuropeptide F in subsets of dorsal and ventral lateral neurons.J. Comp.

USA. 2010; 107: 13497-13502Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), RNAi knockdown of sNPF using pdf-GAL4 should be specific for s-LNvs. Two independently generated RNAi lines against sNPF produced small but significant decreases in nighttime sleep without affecting daytime sleep (Figure 4A). Nighttime sleep bout length was also ∼10%–50% shorter than control strains (Figure 4A). Therefore, sNPF within s-LNvs promotes normal nighttime sleep. The wake-promoting l-LNvs express sNPFR (Kula-Eversole et al., 2010Kula-Eversole E. Nagoshi E. Shang Y. Rodriguez J. Allada R. Rosbash M.

Biol. 2008; 18: R84-R93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Because c929GAL4 expresses in the l-LNvs (and in multiple other peptidergic cells) but not in the s-LNvs (Shang et al., 2008Shang Y. Griffith L.C. Rosbash M. Light-arousal and circadian photoreception circuits intersect at the large PDF cells of the Drosophila brain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 19587-19594Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), we used c929GAL4, tubulin-GAL80ts and UAS-sNPFR-DN to downregulate sNPF signaling (Lee et al., 2008Lee K.S. Kwon O.Y. Lee J.H. Kwon K. Min K.J. Jung S.A. Kim A.K. You K.H. Tatar M. Yu K. Drosophila short neuropeptide F signalling regulates growth by ERK-mediated insulin signalling.Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 468-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) in adult cells. tubulin-GAL80ts ;c929GAL4:UAS-sNPFR-DN flies had no detectable change in total sleep time or mean duration of sleep episodes at 21°C. After shifting to 30°C for 3 days, however, flies exhibited notable nighttime sleep fragmentation compared with parental controls (Figure 4B; for quantitative data, see Figure 4C). The effect on sleep consolidation was fully reversible after shifting back to 21°C (Figure 4B). Remarkably, addition of the pdf-GAL80 transgene to flies carrying c929GAL4 and UAS-sNPFR-DN strongly blocked the effects of UAS-sNPFR-DN (Figure 4D), indicating that most if not all of the sNPF effect on sleep from the diverse peptidergic neurons labeled by the c929GAL4 driver is due to the l-LNvs. We used functional imaging to address the cellular mechanisms by which sNPF affects neuronal function. Flies carrying pdf-GAL4:UAS-EPAC express the FRET-based cAMP reporter in both l-LNvs and s-LNvs (Shang et al., 2011Shang Y. Haynes P. Pírez N. Harrington K.I. Guo F. Pollack J. Hong P. Griffith L.C. Rosbash M. Imaging analysis of clock neurons reveals light buffers the wake-promoting effect of dopamine.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Because we previously showed that the l-LNvs receive synaptic inputs from dopaminergic neurons, with bath application of 100 μM DA evoking a dramatic increase in cAMP (Shang et al., 2011Shang Y. Haynes P. Pírez N. Harrington K.I. Guo F. Pollack J. Hong P. Griffith L.C. Rosbash M. Imaging analysis of clock neurons reveals light buffers the wake-promoting effect of dopamine.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), we used subsaturating concentrations of DA and coapplication sNPF. Twenty micromoles of DA with 20 or 80 μM sNPF suppressed cAMP responses in the l-LNvs compared with application of 20 μM DA alone (Figure S4A). Although these data suggest that the balance between sNPF and DA signaling in the l-LNvs affects nighttime sleep consolidation, the effect of sNPF did not always reach statistical significance. Moreover, sNPF alone did not alter FRET (Figure S4B). To address the mechanism by which sNPF regulates neuronal function in a more general way, we assayed the electrophysiological effects of the sNPF via its receptor, sNPFR in larval central neurons. The OK371-GAL4 driver was combined with UAS-sNPFR to ectopically express sNPFR in larval motor neurons. Perfusion of 20 μM sNPF reduced the firing response to current injection (Figure 5A; ANOVA, F(1,15) = 10.504, p = 0.005). The shift in the input-output function of the neuron was associated with a significant (p = 0.002) hyperpolarization in resting membrane potential, typically occurring within 1-2 min of treatment onset (Figure 5C). Vehicle had no effect (Figures 5B and 5D) and effects were completely dependent on expression of the sNPFR (C.G.V. et al., unpublished data). Taken together with the strong sleep-promoting effect of sNPF firing, hyperpolarization and inhibition of firing may be the general response to sNPF. This is consistent with the fact that NPY, the mammalian analog of sNPF, is primarily inhibitory (van den Pol, 2012van den Pol A.N. Neuropeptide transmission in brain circuits.Neuron. 2012; 76: 98-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The inhibitory nature of sNPF action in nonfeeding neurons contrasts sharply with its published role in feeding pathways. For example, sNPF enhances the responsiveness of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), which promotes foraging (Root et al., 2011Root C.M. Ko K.I. Jafari A. Wang J.W. Presynaptic facilitation by neuropeptide signaling mediates odor-driven food search.Cell. 2011; 145: 133-144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), and sNPF has been shown to directly activate cyclase in the neuronal BG2-c6 Drosophila cell line (Hong et al., 2012Hong S.H. Lee K.S. Kwak S.J. Kim A.K. Bai H. Jung M.S. Kwon O.Y. Song W.J. Tatar M. Yu K.

We therefore examined the effect of sNPF on DILP cells, which respond to octopamine (OA) and have functions in feeding as well as sleep (Crocker et al., 2010Crocker A. Shahidullah M. Levitan I.B.

https://openalex.org/W2598933423,"Increased microRNA-10b (miR-10b) expression in the cancer cells in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a marker of disease aggressiveness. In the present study, we determined that plasma miR-10b levels are significantly increased in PDAC patients by comparison with normal controls. By gene profiling, we identified potential targets downregulated by miR-10b, including Tat-interacting protein 30 (TIP30). Immunoblotting and luciferase reporter assays confirmed that TIP30 was a direct miR-10b target. Downregulation of TIP30 by miR-10b or siRNA-mediated silencing of TIP30 enhanced epidermal growth factor (EGF)-dependent invasion. The actions of miR-10b were abrogated by expressing a modified TIP30 cDNA resistant to miR-10b. EGF-induced EGF receptor (EGFR) tyrosine phosphorylation and extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation were enhanced by miR-10b, and these effects were mimicked by TIP30 silencing. The actions of EGF in the presence of miR-10b were blocked by EGFR kinase inhibition with erlotinib and by dual inhibition of PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase) and MEK. Moreover, miR-10b, EGF and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) combined to markedly increase cell invasion, and this effect was blocked by the combination of erlotinib and SB505124, a type I TGF-β receptor inhibitor. miR-10b also enhanced the stimulatory effects of EGF and TGF-β on cell migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and decreased the expression of RAP2A, EPHB2, KLF4 and NF1. Moreover, miR-10b overexpression accelerated pancreatic cancer cell (PCC) proliferation and tumor growth in an orthotopic model. Thus, plasma miR-10b levels may serve as a diagnostic marker in PDAC, whereas intra-tumoral miR-10b promotes PCC proliferation and invasion by suppressing TIP30, which enhances EGFR signaling, facilitates EGF-TGF-β cross-talk and enhances the expression of EMT-promoting genes, whereas decreasing the expression of several metastasis-suppressing genes. Therefore, therapeutic targeting of miR-10b in PDAC may interrupt growth-promoting deleterious EGF-TGF-β interactions and antagonize the metastatic process at various levels."
https://openalex.org/W2002978772,"Repeated cocaine exposure triggers adaptations in layer 5/6 glutamatergic neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) that promote behavioral sensitization and drug-seeking behavior. While suppression of metabotropic inhibitory signaling has been implicated in these behaviors, underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here, we show that Girk/K(IR)3 channels mediate most of the GABA(B) receptor (GABA(B)R)-dependent inhibition of layer 5/6 pyramidal neurons in the mPFC and that repeated cocaine suppresses this pathway. This adaptation was selective for GABA(B)R-dependent Girk signaling in layer 5/6 pyramidal neurons of the prelimbic cortex (PrLC) and involved a D₁/₅ dopamine receptor- and phosphorylation-dependent internalization of GABA(B)R and Girk channels. Persistent suppression of Girk signaling in layer 5/6 of the dorsal mPFC enhanced cocaine-induced locomotor activity and occluded behavioral sensitization. Thus, the cocaine-induced suppression of GABA(B)R-Girk signaling in layer 5/6 pyramidal neurons of the prelimbic cortex appears to represent an early adaptation critical for promoting addiction-related behavior."
https://openalex.org/W1976378620,"Two Are Not Necessarily Better Than One Gene duplication is one of the major drivers of the evolution of gene and protein networks. However, specific examples of how genes change to maintain two paralogous gene copies within an organism are relatively rare. Baker et al. (p. 104 ) examined the functional divergence of the paralogs Mcm1 and Arg80, MADS-box transcription factors in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae . The partitioning of ancestral functions in a fungal transcription factor appeared to be affected by competitive interference between the newly formed gene duplicates. Thus, in yeast, gene duplication has created a selective conflict between the paralogs, which appear to have driven the evolution of a novel protein function."
https://openalex.org/W2033591860,"A novel experience induces the Arc/Arg3.1 gene as well as plasticity of CA1 neural networks. To understand how these are linked, we briefly exposed GFP reporter mice of Arc transcription to a novel environment. Excitatory synaptic function of CA1 neurons with recent in vivo Arc induction (ArcGFP+) was similar to neighboring noninduced neurons. However, in response to group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) activation, ArcGFP+ neurons preferentially displayed long-term synaptic depression (mGluR-LTD) and robust increases in dendritic Arc protein. mGluR-LTD in ArcGFP+ neurons required rapid protein synthesis and Arc, suggesting that dendritic translation of Arc underlies the priming of mGluR-LTD. In support of this idea, novelty exposure increased Arc messenger RNA in CA1 dendrites and promoted mGluR-induced translation of Arc in hippocampal synaptoneurosomes. Repeated experience suppressed synaptic transmission onto ArcGFP+ neurons and occluded mGluR-LTD ex vivo. mGluR-LTD priming in neurons with similar Arc activation history may contribute to encoding a novel environment."
https://openalex.org/W2092110793,"The p53 tumor suppressor protein is a major sensor of cellular stresses, and upon stabilization, activates or represses many genes that control cell fate decisions. While the mechanism of p53-mediated transactivation is well established, several mechanisms have been proposed for p53-mediated repression. Here, we demonstrate that the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 is both necessary and sufficient for the downregulation of known p53-repression targets, including survivin, CDC25C, and CDC25B in response to p53 induction. These same targets are similarly repressed in response to p16 overexpression, implicating the involvement of the shared downstream retinoblastoma (RB)-E2F pathway. We further show that in response to either p53 or p21 induction, E2F4 complexes are specifically recruited onto the promoters of these p53-repression targets. Moreover, abrogation of E2F4 recruitment via the inactivation of RB pocket proteins, but not by RB loss of function alone, prevents the repression of these genes. Finally, our results indicate that E2F4 promoter occupancy is globally associated with p53-repression targets, but not with p53 activation targets, implicating E2F4 complexes as effectors of p21-dependent p53-mediated repression."
https://openalex.org/W2057989198,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a debilitating chronic inflammatory disorder of the intestine. The interactions between enteric bacteria and genetic susceptibilities are major contributors of IBD etiology. Although genetic variants with loss or gain of NOD2 functions have been linked to IBD susceptibility, the mechanisms coordinating NOD2 downstream signaling, especially in macrophages, during IBD pathogenesis are not precisely identified. Here, studies utilizing the murine dextran sodium sulfate model of colitis revealed the crucial roles for inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) in regulating pathophysiology of IBDs. Importantly, stimulation of NOD2 failed to activate Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling in iNOS null macrophages, implicating NO mediated cross-talk between NOD2 and SHH signaling. NOD2 signaling up-regulated the expression of a NO-responsive microRNA, miR-146a, that targeted NUMB gene and alleviated the suppression of SHH signaling. In vivo and ex vivo studies confirmed the important roles for miR-146a in amplifying inflammatory responses. Collectively, we have identified new roles for miR-146a that established novel cross-talk between NOD2-SHH signaling during gut inflammation. Potential implications of these observations in therapeutics could increase the possibility of defining and developing better regimes to treat IBD pathophysiology."
https://openalex.org/W2092200047,"Disruption of microRNA (miRNA) expression patterns is now being recognized as a hallmark of human cancer. The causes of these altered profiles are diverse, and, among them, we found the existence of defects in the miRNA processing machinery. However, little is known about how these alterations affect the biology of the underlying tumors. Herein, we show that colorectal cancer cells with an impairment in DICER1, a major miRNA biogenesis gene, undergo enrichment of tumor stemness features and an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. These phenotypes are associated with the downregulation of miRNAs, such as miR-34a, miR-126 and those of the miR-200 family, that target critical coding genes in these pathways. Most importantly, DICER1 impairment also induces the acquisition of a greater capacity for tumor initiation and metastasis, two properties associated with cancer stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W1986369801,"Drosophila endocytosis-defective cells develop tumour overgrowths in the imaginal discs. We have analysed the tumorigenic potential of cells mutant for Rab5, a gene involved in endocytosis. We found that while a compartment entirely made by Rab5 mutant cells can grow indefinitely, clones of Rab5 cells surrounded by normal cells are eliminated by cell competition. However, when a group of about 400 cells are simultaneously made mutant for Rab5, they form an overgrowing tumour: mutant cells in the periphery are eliminated, but those inside survive and continue proliferating because they are beyond the range of cell competition. These results identify group protection as a mechanism to evade the tumour-suppressing function of cell competition in Drosophila. Furthermore, we find that the growth of the tumour depends to a large extent on the presence of apoptosis inside the tumour: cells doubly mutant for Rab5 and the proapoptotic gene dronc do not form overgrowing tumours. These results suggest that the apoptosis caused by cell competition acts as a tumour-stimulating factor, bringing about high levels of Jun N-terminal kinase and subsequently Wg/Dpp signalling and high proliferation levels in the growing tumour. We conclude that under these circumstances cell competition facilitates the progression of the tumour, thus reversing its normal antitumour role."

https://openalex.org/W2032079414,"Although epidemiological and preclinical studies have shown the preventative effects of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on breast cancer, inconsistencies still remain in the data and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we identified mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, which plays an essential role in cell proliferation and breast tumorigenesis, as a target of n-3 PUFAs. In breast cancer cell lines, n-3 PUFAs rapidly and efficiently suppress both mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTORC2 and their downstream signaling, and subsequently inhibit cell proliferation and angiogenesis while promoting apoptosis. Further study indicates that stabilization of the mTOR-raptor complex by n-3 PUFAs may contribute to their inhibitory effect on mTORC1. Importantly, four complementary and well-controlled animal models were utilized to identify the role and molecular target of n-3 PUFAs in the prevention of breast carcinogenesis and progression, namely: (1) chemically induced mammary tumor rats with a high dietary intake of n-3 PUFAs; (2) nude mice implanted with mammary tumor cell lines stably expressing fat-1, a desaturase that catalyzes the conversion of n-6 to n-3 PUFAs and produces n-3 PUFAs endogenously; (3) fat-1 transgenic severe combined immune deficiency mice implanted with breast tumor cells; and (4) the fat-1 transgenic mouse mammary tumor virus-polyoma virus middle T oncogene double-hybrid mice, a model of aggressive breast cancer. In summary, dietary and endogenous n-3 PUFAs abrogate the activity of mTORC1/2 pathways in vitro and in vivo and prevent breast carcinogenesis, tumor growth and metastasis. Taken together, our findings convincingly clarify the causal relationship between n-3 PUFAs and breast cancer prevention and establish mTORC1/2 as a target of n-3 PUFAs."

Rapid, excitatory synaptic communication that occurs in vertebrate brains, as well as in most other nervous systems, is primarily mediated by the neurotransmitter glutamate. The strength of this communication is dependent on the number of AMPA class ionotropic glutamate receptors, as well as on their functional properties. Synaptic strength is plastic, and nervous system activity can change the number and properties of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) (Anggono and Huganir, 2012Anggono V. Huganir R.L.

Cornichon was first identified in Drosophila, where the Cni protein binds to the EGF-like ligand Gurken, thus acting as a cargo receptor for recruitment of Gurken into COPII vesicles. In the absence of Cni, export from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and secretion of ligand are disrupted (Bökel et al., 2006Bökel C. Dass S. Wilsch-Bräuninger M. Roth S.

More recently, affinity purification of native AMPARs from rat brain followed by mass spectroscopy analysis identified CNIH-2 and CNIH-3 as AMPAR-interacting proteins. When coexpressed with AMPAR subunits in heterologous cells, these proteins slowed the kinetics of receptor desensitization and deactivation and increased surface expression (Coombs et al., 2012Coombs I.D.

USA. 2010; 107: 16315-16319Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have revealed additional complexities. While CNIH-2 was found at the cell surface of hippocampal neurons, it did not reach the surface of cerebellar Purkinje neurons in stargazer mice, which lack the γ-2 TARP (Gill et al., 2011Gill M.B. Kato A.S. Roberts M.F. Yu H. Wang H. Tomita S. Bredt D.S. Cornichon-2 modulates AMPA receptor-transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory protein assembly to dictate gating and pharmacology.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 6928-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Studies in HeLa cells found that overexpression of CNIH-2 altered the glycosylation pattern of the GluA2 AMPAR subunit, suggesting that CNIH-2 regulates AMPAR maturation in the ER, which may affect AMPAR function at synapses (Harmel et al., 2012Harmel N. Cokic B. Zolles G. Berkefeld H. Mauric V. Fakler B. Stein V. Klöcker N. AMPA receptors commandeer an ancient cargo exporter for use as an auxiliary subunit for signaling.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e30681Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). While studies in various heterologous cells have provided important insights into CNIH-2 function, these cells might express different proteins and use different trafficking pathways than those present in neurons. Consequently, studies to date have not fully resolved whether CNIHs primarily have a forward trafficking role in neurons, whether they are also recruited away from the ER-Golgi early secretory pathway to function at synapses, or whether they function as auxiliary proteins at synapses to modify the functional properties of AMPARs. Clearly, a deeper understanding of the contribution of CNIHs to nervous system function and behavior would benefit from in vivo studies. Genetic-based studies of cornichon function in neurons are a challenge in vertebrates, which express four cornichon homologs with possible redundant functions. In contrast, only one cornichon homolog is found in the C. elegans genome. The study of synaptic signaling in the simple, well-defined nervous system of C. elegans has provided new insights into AMPAR function and behaviors regulated by glutamatergic signaling (de Bono and Maricq, 2005de Bono M. Maricq A.V. Neuronal substrates of complex behaviors in C. elegans.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 28: 451-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In C. elegans, the GLR-1 AMPAR subunit is required for fast glutamate-gated current in specialized command interneurons that control the switch between forward and backward movement; thus, reversal frequency is disrupted in glr-1 loss-of-function or gain-of-function mutants (Hart et al., 1995Hart A.C.

Compared to wild-type, we found increased anterograde transport of GLR-1 in cni-1 mutants, with corresponding increases in synaptic GLR-1 expression and GLR-1-mediated currents. In contrast, trafficking and current were reduced with overexpression of CNI-1, the yeast homolog (Evr14p), or vertebrate CNIH-2. Reconstitution experiments revealed that cornichon proteins have evolutionarily conserved roles in limiting the export of AMPARs and modifying receptor function, thus contributing to the regulation of neuronal excitability. Analysis of the C. elegans genome for genes that encode proteins with significant identity to members of the vertebrate cornichon family identified only one candidate homolog (T09E8.3; http://www.wormbase.org), which had significant identity to vertebrate and invertebrate corichon proteins as well as to the yeast protein Erv14p (Figures S1A and S1C available online). Analysis of the primary amino acid sequence predicted three transmembrane domains (TMDs), as well as the topological arrangement of intra- and extracellular regions found in previously described cornichon proteins (Figure S1C). Invertebrate cornichon proteins as well as vertebrate CNIH-1 and CNIH-4 lack the signature 16 amino acid region found in the first extracellular domain of vertebrate CNIH-2 and CNIH-3. The T09E8.3 gene was originally named cnih-2 (Zhang et al., 2012Zhang D. Isack N.R. Glodowski D.R. Liu J. Chen C.C. Xu X.Z. Grant B.D. Rongo C. RAB-6.2 and the retromer regulate glutamate receptor recycling through a retrograde pathway.J. Cell Biol. 2012; 196: 85-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar); but because the protein lacks the signature region, a consensus decision was made to rename the gene cni-1 (C. Rongo, personal communication). An available deletion mutation in cni-1 removes over half of the coding region and disrupts the 3′ UTR signal required for polyadenylation (Figure S1B). C. elegans regulates the frequency of turning and reversals to mediate avoidance and attraction behaviors and to aid in the exploration of their environs by restricting or expanding the search area (Hills et al., 2004Hills T.

SOL-1 is a CUB-domain protein required for GLR-1 glutamate receptor function in C. elegans.Nature. 2004; 427: 451-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In contrast, transgenic “lurcher” worms that express a gain-of-function mutation in GLR-1 have an increased reversal frequency (Zheng et al., 1999Zheng Y. Brockie P.J. Mellem J.E. Madsen D.M. Maricq A.V. Neuronal control of locomotion in C. elegans is modified by a dominant mutation in the GLR-1 ionotropic glutamate receptor.Neuron. 1999; 24: 347-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Thus, reversal frequency provides a behavioral readout of the strength of AMPAR-mediated synaptic signaling. We found that the average forward time in cni-1 mutants was considerably shorter than in wild-type, with a corresponding increase in the frequency of reversals (Figure 1A). This increase suggested that the strength of AMPAR-mediated signaling was increased in cni-1 mutants. In contrast, we did not observe phenotypes associated with loss of GLR-1-mediated signaling, such as altered avoidance responses to tactile or osmotic stimuli (Figure S2), nor did the cni-1 mutation suppress the behavioral defects of glr-1 mutants (Figure 1A and Figure S2A). To further address whether the increased reversal frequency observed in cni-1 mutants was dependent on glutamatergic signaling, we examined relevant single and double mutants (Figure 1A). Double mutants with cni-1 and eat-4, which encodes the vesicular glutamate transporter, were indistinguishable from eat-4 mutants alone, indicating that the hyperreversal behavior in cni-1 mutants was dependent on glutamatergic neurotransmission. We next asked whether the hyperreversal behavior was dependent on the GLR-1 AMPAR. Compared to wild-type, reversal frequency was decreased in glr-1 mutants (Brockie et al., 2001bBrockie P.J. Mellem J.E. Hills T. Madsen D.M. Maricq A.V. The C. elegans glutamate receptor subunit NMR-1 is required for slow NMDA-activated currents that regulate reversal frequency during locomotion.Neuron. 2001; 31: 617-630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), and the glr-1 mutation suppressed the hyperreversal phenotype of cni-1 mutants (Figure 1A). These results indicate that the effects of cni-1 on reversal behavior primarily depend on AMPAR-mediated synaptic signaling. In support of this hypothesis, we found that the cni-1 reversal phenotype was also dependent on AMPAR auxiliary proteins. Thus, reversals were suppressed in the double mutants sol-1; cni-1 and stg-2; cni-1 (Figure 1A). To evaluate the contributions of CNI-1 to AMPAR-mediated currents, we turned to in vivo patch-clamp electrophysiological analysis. Compared to wild-type, the amplitude of the glutamate-gated and GLR-1-dependent current in the AVA command interneurons was significantly increased in cni-1 mutants (Figures 1B and 1C). We found the same relative increase when we used the partial agonist kainate and there was no apparent difference in the efficacy of the two agonists (Figure S3A). In contrast, overexpression of CNI-1 in AVA dramatically reduced the amplitude of the glutamate-gated current. In these transgenic worms, the amount of CNI-1 expressed from the multicopy transgene is predicted to be much greater than that from the endogenous cni-1 gene. We next asked whether currents were also modified in transgenic cni-1 mutants that overexpressed the related vertebrate CNIH-2 or yeast Erv14p cornichon proteins. We found dramatically reduced currents in these transgenic worms, consistent with an evolutionarily conserved role for cornichon proteins (Figures 1B and 1C). We also evaluated whether NMDA receptors (NMDARs) were dependent on CNI-1. Peak NMDA-gated currents were increased in cni-1 mutants and reduced with overexpression of either CNI-1 or CNIH-2 (Figures S3B and S3C). In contrast to what we observed for AMPARs, overexpression of CNI-1 or CNIH-2 caused much smaller changes in NMDA-gated current. These effects are not likely secondary to changes in GLR-1 given that NMDAR-mediated currents in glr-1 mutants are indistinguishable from those in wild-type worms (Brockie et al., 2001bBrockie P.J.

SOL-1 is a CUB-domain protein required for GLR-1 glutamate receptor function in C. elegans.Nature. 2004; 427: 451-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These results, together with our behavioral data, demonstrate that CNI-1’s most prominent role in AVA appears to be the regulation of AMPARs. Our findings are consistent with an earlier study in yeast demonstrating that Erv14p regulates multiple classes of proteins (Herzig et al., 2012Herzig Y. Sharpe H.J. Elbaz Y. Munro S. Schuldiner M. A systematic approach to pair secretory cargo receptors with their cargo suggests a mechanism for cargo selection by Erv14.PLoS Biol. 2012; 10: e1001329Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The increased current that we observed in cni-1 mutants might be secondary to an increase in the number of synaptic AMPARs. To evaluate whether the number of receptors at synapses is modified in cni-1 mutants, we used confocal microscopy to image transgenic strains that expressed a functional GLR-1::GFP fusion protein. Consistent with our earlier behavioral and electrophysiological data, we found that the fluorescence intensity of GLR-1::GFP was greater in transgenic cni-1 mutants and reduced with overexpression of CNI-1, CNIH-2, or Erv14p (Figures 2A and 2B ). We obtained similar results with overexpression of CNI-1 in transgenic wild-type worms (Figure S4A). To address whether the surface expression of GLR-1 was modified by the mutation in cni-1, we tagged GLR-1 with the pH-sensitive reporter superecliptic phluorin (SEP). The fluorescence of SEP is quenched by the relatively acidic pH of intracellular vesicles but exhibits greatly enhanced fluorescence at extracellular pH, thus distinguishing intracellular proteins from those at the surface (Miesenböck et al., 1998Miesenböck G.

https://openalex.org/W2128731166,"Refinement of mammalian neural circuits involves substantial experience-dependent synapse elimination. Using in vivo two-photon imaging, we found that experience-dependent elimination of postsynaptic dendritic spines in the cortex was accelerated in ephrin-A2 knockout (KO) mice, resulting in fewer adolescent spines integrated into adult circuits. Such increased spine removal in ephrin-A2 KOs depended on activation of glutamate receptors, as blockade of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors eliminated the difference in spine loss between wild-type and KO mice. We also showed that ephrin-A2 in the cortex colocalized with glial glutamate transporters, which were significantly downregulated in ephrin-A2 KOs. Consistently, glial glutamate transport was reduced in ephrin-A2 KOs, resulting in an accumulation of synaptic glutamate. Finally, inhibition of glial glutamate uptake promoted spine elimination in wild-type mice, resembling the phenotype of ephrin-A2 KOs. Together, our results suggest that ephrin-A2 regulates experience-dependent, NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic pruning through glial glutamate transport during maturation of the mouse cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2032519445,"Krüppel-like factor 8 (KLF8) is a transcriptional factor critical for metastatic progression of breast cancer. Epithelial stromal interaction 1 (EPSTI1), a recently identified stromal fibroblast-induced gene in non-invasive breast cancer cells is highly overexpressed in invasive breast carcinomas. The function and regulation of EPSTI1, however, remain largely unknown. In this paper, we report a novel KLF8 to EPSTI1 signaling pathway in breast cancer. Using various expression analyses, we revealed a high co-overexpression of KLF8 and EPSTI1 in invasive human breast cancer cells and patient tumors. Ectopic overexpression of KLF8 in the non-invasive MCF-10A cells induced the EPSTI1 expression, whereas KLF8 knockdown from the invasive, MDA-MB-231 cells decreased the EPSTI1 expression. Promoter activation and binding analyses indicated that KLF8 promoted the EPSTI1 expression by directly acting on the EPSTI1 gene promoter. EPSTI1 knockdown dramatically reduced the KLF8-promoted MCF-10A cell invasion, and ectopic expression of EPSTI1 in the non-invasive MCF-7 cells is sufficient to induce the cell invasion. Experiments using nude mice demonstrated that the ectopic EPSTI1 granted the MCF-7 cells capability of both invasive growth in the breasts and metastasis to the lungs. Using co-immunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometry, we discovered that EPSTI1 interacts with the valosin-containing protein (VCP), resulting in the degradation of IκBα and subsequent activation of NF-κB in the nucleus. These findings suggest a novel KLF8 to EPSTI1 to VCP to NF-κB signaling mechanism potentially critical for breast cancer invasion and metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2070919286,"In an effort to identify novel biallelically inactivated tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) in sporadic invasive and preinvasive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) genomes, we applied a comprehensive integrated multiple ‘omics’ approach to investigate patient-matched, paired NSCLC tumor and non-malignant parenchymal tissues. By surveying lung tumor genomes for genes concomitantly inactivated within individual tumors by multiple mechanisms, and by the frequency of disruption in tumors across multiple cohorts, we have identified a putative lung cancer TSG, Eyes Absent 4 (EYA4). EYA4 is frequently and concomitantly deleted, hypermethylated and underexpressed in multiple independent lung tumor data sets, in both major NSCLC subtypes and in the earliest stages of lung cancer. We found that decreased EYA4 expression is not only associated with poor survival in sporadic lung cancers but also that EYA4 single-nucleotide polymorphisms are associated with increased familial cancer risk, consistent with EYA4s proximity to the previously reported lung cancer susceptibility locus on 6q. Functionally, we found that EYA4 displays TSG-like properties with a role in modulating apoptosis and DNA repair. Cross-examination of EYA4 expression across multiple tumor types suggests a cell-type-specific tumorigenic role for EYA4, consistent with a tumor suppressor function in cancers of epithelial origin. This work shows a clear role for EYA4 as a putative TSG in NSCLC."
https://openalex.org/W2043471500,"Metastasis suppressors comprise a growing class of genes whose downregulation triggers metastatic progression. In contrast to tumor suppressors, metastasis suppressors are rarely mutated or deleted, and little is known regarding the mechanisms by which their expression is downregulated. Here, we demonstrate that the metastasis suppressor, NM23-H1, is degraded by lysosomal cysteine cathepsins (L,B), which directly cleave NM23-H1. In addition, activation of c-Abl and Arg oncoproteins induces NM23-H1 degradation in invasive cancer cells by increasing cysteine cathepsin transcription and activation. Moreover, c-Abl activates cathepsins by promoting endosome maturation, which facilitates trafficking of NM23-H1 to the lysosome where it is degraded. Importantly, the invasion- and metastasis-promoting activity of c-Abl/Arg is dependent on their ability to induce NM23-H1 degradation, and the pathway is clinically relevant as c-Abl/Arg activity and NM23-H1 expression are inversely correlated in primary breast cancers and melanomas. Thus, we demonstrate a novel mechanism by which cathepsin expression is upregulated in cancer cells (via Abl kinases). We also identify a novel role for intracellular cathepsins in invasion and metastasis (degradation of a metastasis suppressor). Finally, we identify novel crosstalk between oncogenic and metastasis suppressor pathways, thereby providing mechanistic insight into the process of NM23-H1 loss, which may pave the way for new strategies to restore NM23-H1 expression and block metastatic progression."
https://openalex.org/W2076991180,"Sustained synaptic transmission requires vesicle recycling and refilling with transmitter, two processes considered to proceed independently. Contrary to this assumption, we show here that depletion of cytosolic transmitter at GABAergic synapses reversibly reduces the number of recycling vesicles. Using paired recordings in hippocampal cultures, we show that repetitive activity causes two phases of reduction of the postsynaptic response. The first involves the classical depletion of the readily releasable and recycling pools, while the second reflects impairment of vesicle filling as GABA is consumed, since it can only be reversed by uptake of GABA or its precursors, glutamate or glutamine. Surprisingly, this second phase is associated with reduced quantal release, a faster depression rate and lower FM5-95 labeling, suggesting that the size of the cycling vesicular pool is regulated by cytosolic transmitter availability. Regulation of vesicular cycling may represent a general mechanism of presynaptic plasticity, matching synaptic release to transmitter supply."
https://openalex.org/W2065318262,"Development of specific inhibitors of allergy has had limited success, in part, owing to a lack of experimental models that reflect the complexity of allergen-IgE interactions. We designed a heterotetravalent allergen (HtTA) system, which reflects epitope heterogeneity, polyclonal response and number of immunodominant epitopes observed in natural allergens, thereby providing a physiologically relevant experimental model to study mast cell degranulation. The HtTA design revealed the importance of weak-affinity epitopes in allergy, particularly when presented with high-affinity epitopes. The effect of selective inhibition of weak-affinity epitope-IgE interactions was investigated with heterobivalent inhibitors (HBIs) designed to simultaneously target the antigen- and nucleotide-binding sites on the IgE Fab. HBI demonstrated enhanced avidity for the target IgE and was a potent inhibitor of degranulation in vitro and in vivo. These results demonstrate that partial inhibition of allergen-IgE interactions was sufficient to prevent mast cell degranulation, thus establishing the therapeutic potential of the HBI design."
https://openalex.org/W2031054678,"Local recurrent networks in neocortex are critical nodes for sensory processing, but their regulation by experience is much less understood than for long-distance (translaminar or cross-columnar) projections. We studied local L2/3 recurrent networks in rat somatosensory cortex during deprivation-induced whisker map plasticity, by expressing channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in L2/3 pyramidal cells and measuring light-evoked synaptic currents in ex vivo S1 slices. In columns with intact whiskers, brief light impulses evoked recurrent excitation and supralinear inhibition. Deprived columns showed modestly reduced excitation and profoundly reduced inhibition, providing a circuit locus for disinhibition of whisker-evoked responses observed in L2/3 in vivo. Slower light ramps elicited sustained gamma frequency oscillations, which were nearly abolished in deprived columns. Reduction in gamma power was also observed in spontaneous LFP oscillations in L2/3 of deprived columns in vivo. Thus, L2/3 recurrent networks are a powerful site for homeostatic modulation of excitation-inhibition balance and regulation of gamma oscillations."
https://openalex.org/W2083519984,"Uniquely among known ribozymes, the glmS ribozyme-riboswitch requires a small-molecule coenzyme, glucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcN6P). Although consistent with its gene-regulatory function, the use of GlcN6P is unexpected because all of the other characterized self-cleaving ribozymes use RNA functional groups or divalent cations for catalysis. To determine what active site features make this ribozyme reliant on GlcN6P and to evaluate whether it might have evolved from a coenzyme-independent ancestor, we isolated a GlcN6P-independent variant through in vitro selection. Three active site mutations suffice to generate a highly reactive RNA that adopts the wild-type fold but uses divalent cations for catalysis and is insensitive to GlcN6P. Biochemical and crystallographic comparisons of wild-type and mutant ribozymes show that a handful of functional groups fine-tune the RNA to be either coenzyme or cation dependent. These results indicate that a few mutations can confer new biochemical activities on structured RNAs. Thus, families of structurally related ribozymes with divergent function may exist."

https://openalex.org/W2071176521,"The cannabinoid (CB1) receptor is a member of the rhodopsin-like G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. The human CB1 receptor, which is among the most expressed receptors in the brain, has been implicated in several disease states, including drug addiction, anxiety, depression, obesity, and chronic pain. Different classes of CB1 agonists evoke signaling pathways through the activation of specific subtypes of G proteins. The molecular basis of CB1 receptor coupling to its cognate G protein is unknown. As a first step toward understanding CB1 receptor-mediated G protein signaling, we have constructed a ternary complex structural model of the CB1 receptor and Gi heterotrimer (CB1-Gi), guided by the x-ray structure of β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) in complex with Gs (β2AR-Gs), through 824-ns duration molecular dynamics simulations in a fully hydrated 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine bilayer environment. We identified a group of residues at the juxtamembrane regions of the intracellular loops 2 and 3 (IC2 and IC3) of the CB1 receptor, including Ile-218(3.54), Tyr-224(IC2), Asp-338(6.30), Arg-340(6.32), Leu-341(6.33), and Thr-344(6.36), as potential key contacts with the extreme C-terminal helix α5 of Gαi. Ala mutations of these residues at the receptor-Gi interface resulted in little G protein coupling activity, consistent with the present model of the CB1-Gi complex, which suggests tight interactions between CB1 and the extreme C-terminal helix α5 of Gαi. The model also suggests that unique conformational changes in the extreme C-terminal helix α5 of Gα play a crucial role in the receptor-mediated G protein activation."

https://openalex.org/W2019363307,"In mammalian cells, metabolic and environmental stress increases the phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translational initiation factor, eIF2α, and attenuates global protein synthesis. Subsequent transcriptional activation of GADD34 assembles an eIF2α phosphatase that feeds back to restore mRNA translation. Active proteasomal degradation of GADD34 protein then reestablishes the sensitivity of cells to subsequent bouts of stress. Mass spectrometry established GADD34 phosphorylation on multiple serines, threonines, and tyrosines. Phosphorylation at tyrosine 262 enhanced the rate of the GADD34 protein turnover. Substrate-trapping studies identified TC-PTP (PTPN2) as a potential GADD34 phosphatase, recognizing phosphotyrosine 262. Reduced GADD34 protein levels in TC-PTP-null MEFs following ER stress emphasized the importance of TC-PTP in determining the cellular levels of GADD34 protein. The susceptibility of TC-PTP-null MEFs to ER stress-induced apoptosis was significantly ameliorated by ectopic expression of GADD34. The data suggested that GADD34 phosphorylation on tyrosine 262 modulates endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling and cell fate."
