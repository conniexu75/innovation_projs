Recent studies have reported that the phosphatidylinositol 3-OH-kinase-Akt pathway inhibits p53-mediated transcription and apoptosis, although the underlying mechanisms have yet to be determined. Mdm2, a ubiquitin ligase for p53, plays a central role in regulation of the stability of p53 and serves as a good substrate for Akt. In this study, we find that expression of Akt reduces the protein levels of p53, at least in part by enhancing the degradation of p53. Both Akt expression and serum treatment induced phosphorylation of Mdm2 at Ser186. Akt-mediated phosphorylation of Mdm2 at Ser186 had little effect on the subcellular localization of Mdm2. However, both Akt expression and serum treatment increased Mdm2 ubiquitination of p53. The serum-induced increase in p53 ubiquitination was blocked by LY294002, a phosphatidylinositol 3-OH-kinase inhibitor. Moreover, when Ser186 was replaced by Ala, Mdm2 became resistant to Akt enhancement of p53 ubiquitination and degradation. Collectively, these results suggest that Akt enhances the ubiquitination-promoting function of Mdm2 by phosphorylation of Ser186, which results in reduction of p53 protein. This study may shed light on the mechanisms by which Akt promotes survival, proliferation, and tumorigenesis. p53 plays a key role in DNA damage-induced apoptosis.

For instance, Ras activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway confers protection from apoptosis in fibroblasts in response to DNA damage or oncogenic Myc (3Sklar M.D. Science. 1988; 239: 645-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 4Kauffmann-Zeh A.

In this respect, the PI3K-Akt pathway-mediated survival contributes to the ability of Ras to function as an oncogene (1Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E.

The tumor suppressor p53 plays a key role in the induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in response to a variety of genotoxic stresses and to the activation of some oncogenes such as Myc, thereby preventing the propagation of damaged cells (14Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6673) Google Scholar, 15Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2984-2991Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). p53 function is controlled by several mechanisms, including the regulation of p53 protein stability. Central to this process is Mdm2 (murine double minute), a ubiquitin ligase that targets p53 for ubiquitination and allows export of p53 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where p53 degradation by proteasomes takes place (16Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3629) Google Scholar, 17Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H.

Under normal circumstances, p53 is maintained at very low levels by continuous ubiquitination and degradation. Activation of p53 in response to cellular stresses is mediated partly by inhibition of Mdm2 and rapid stabilization of p53 protein (22Woods D.B. Vousden K.H. Exp. Cell. Res. 2001; 264: 56-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The deregulated activation of mitogenic signals, caused by the oncogenic activation of Ras or Myc for example, leads to the activation of p53, which provides a mechanism to prevent the abnormal proliferation associated with tumor development (23Zindy F. Eischen C.M. Randle D.H. Kamijo T. Cleveland J.L. Sherr C.J. Roussel M.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2424-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar, 24Vousden K.H. Cell. 2000; 103: 691-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). However, this activation of p53 by mitogenic signals must be suppressed during normal cell proliferation to prevent p53 from inducing cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. Therefore, it appears reasonable to assume that mitogenic signals elicit both p53-activating and -inactivating signals. Recent studies have indeed shown that Ras can inhibit or activate p53, depending on the cellular contexts and the duration of Ras activation (24Vousden K.H. Cell. 2000; 103: 691-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar, 25Ries S. Biederer C. Woods D. Shifman O. Shirasawa S. Sasazuki T. McMahon M. Oren M. McCormick F. Cell. 2000; 103: 321-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The Raf-MEK-MAPK pathway has been shown to mediate Ras activation of p53 (26Lin A.W. Barradas M. Stone J.C. van Aelst L. Serrano M. Lowe S.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3008-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar), most likely through induction of p19ARF, which in turn inactivates Mdm2. The PI3K-Akt pathway has recently been reported to inhibit the transcriptional activity of p53 and reduce the pro-apoptotic functions of p53 (27Sabbatini P. McCormick F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24263-24269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar,28Yamaguchi A. Tamatani M. Matsuzaki H. Namikawa K. Kiyama H. Vitek M.P. Mitsuda N. Tohyama M. J. Biol.

Therefore, it is possible that the PI3K-Akt pathway opposes the MAPK pathway in activation of p53. However, it has yet to be determined how Akt suppresses p53. Here we show that Akt does not affect the mRNA levels of p53 but promotes ubiquitination and degradation of p53 protein. We confirmed very recent studies showing that Mdm2 serves as a good substrate for Akt (29Mayo L.D. Donner D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11598-11603Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar, 30Zhou B.P. Liao Y. Xia W. Zou Y. Spohn B. Hung M.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 973-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). Although they have shown that Akt promotes nuclear translocation of Mdm2, we could not detect any effect of Akt on Mdm2 subcellular localization. Instead, we found that Akt facilitates the functions of Mdm2 to promote p53 ubiquitination by phosphorylation of Ser186. These findings may explain how mitogenic signal and Ras inhibit p53 during normal cell proliferation and may also provide a mechanism by which Akt promotes survival. Human p53 cDNA, human Mdm2 cDNA, and p53-responsive luciferase reporter plasmid (PG13-Luc) are kind gifts from Dr. B. Vogelstein. FLAG-tagged and HA-tagged p53 cDNA were cloned into the KpnI-BamHI sites of pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) (FLAG-p53 and HA-p53). Mdm2 mutant S186A was generated by QuikChange (Stratagene) by utilizing primers 5′-CGCCACAAAGCTGATAGTATTTCCC-3′ and 5′-GGGAAATACTATCAGCTTTGTGGCG-3′. Mdm2 mutant S166A/S186A was generated by utilizing primers 5′-GGAGAGCAATTGCTGAGACAGAAG-3′ and 5′-CTTCTGTCTCAGCAATTGCTCTCC-3′ to mutate Ser166 into Ala of S186A Mdm2. FLAG-tagged wild type (WT), S186A, and S166A/S186A Mdm2 were cloned into theKpnI-XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1(+). For bacterial expression, WT and S186A Mdm2 were cloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences). Human WT Akt and a constitutively active (CA) Akt were kindly provided by Dr. D. Alessi and Dr. R. Roth (31Kohn A.D. Barthel A. Kovacina K.S. Boge A. Wallach B. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Scott P.H. Lawrence J.C., Jr. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11937-11943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), respectively. A kinase-negative (KN) Akt was made by mutating Lys179 into Ala as described (12Masuyama N. Oishi K. Mori Y. Ueno T. Takahama Y. Gotoh Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32799-32805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). A dominant-negative Akt (3A Akt) was made by mutating Lys179, Thr308, and Ser473 into Ala. CA Akt, WT Akt, KN Akt, and 3A Akt were cloned into BamHI site of pcDNA3.1(+). FLAG-tagged ubiquitin was cloned into theKpnI-BamHI sites of pcDNA3.1(+). The antibodies used in this study include polyclonal anti-HA antibody Y-11 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), monoclonal anti-α-tubulin antibody DM 1A (Sigma), monoclonal anti-topoisomerase II α antibody 8D2 (Medical & Biological Laboratories), monoclonal anti-MEK1 antibody 25 (Transduction Laboratories), monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody M2 (Sigma), polyclonal anti-Akt antibody (Cell Signaling), monoclonal anti-p53 antibody DO7 (Oncogene), and monoclonal anti-Mdm2 antibody IF2 (Calbiochem). To generate anti-Ser(P)186 Mdm2, a phosphopeptide corresponding to the amino acid sequence of human Mdm2 178–193 (CRQRKRHKpSDSISLSF) was synthesized and coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Sawady Technology). This antigen was injected into Japanese White rabbits, from which serum was collected approximately every 2 weeks. The serum was affinity purified by passing over a thiopropyl-Sepharose 6B column (Amersham Biosciences) coupled with a synthetic peptide of the sequence CRQRKRHKpSDSISLSF, and the bound antibodies were eluted. The elutes containing phosphopeptide-specific antibodies were then passed through a column coupled with the unphosphorylated peptide (i.e. CRQRKRHKSDSISLSF) to deplete antibodies that react with unphosphorylated Mdm2. MCF-7, Saos-2, and 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing penicillin-streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine serum. For MCF-7 and Saos-2 cells, transfection was carried out by using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen) in 6-well plates or 10-cm dishes with 5 × 105 cells/dish and 3 × 106 cells/dish, respectively. For 6-well plates, the cells were transfected with 1–3 μg of total DNA together with 6 μl of LipofectAMINE Plus reagent and 4 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent/well. For 10-cm dishes, the cells were transfected with 4–6 μg of total DNA together with 20 μl of LipofectAMINE Plus reagent and 30 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent/dish. For 293T cells, transfection was carried out by using FuGENE6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 6-cm dishes (2 × 106 cells, 5 μg of total DNA, and 12 μl of FuGENE6 transfection reagent/dish). For luciferase assay for p53 transcriptional activity, the cells were transfected with PG13-Luc together with various constructs and a β-galactosidase expression plasmid. The β-galactosidase expression was driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter, and used for a standard to normalize transfection efficiency. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were assessed 24 h after transfection. Total RNA was isolated from MCF-7 cells using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and transcribed using ReverTra Ace (Toyobo) with oligo(dT) primers, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The aliquots of cDNA corresponding to 100 ng of total RNA were used for PCR amplification in a 50-μl solution containing 1× KOD Dash buffer (Toyobo), 0.2 mm dNTPs, 1.25 units of KOD Dash (Toyobo), and 0.4 μm of each primer performed with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences DNA thermal cycler. The primers used to amplify p53 were 5′-TCTGGGACAGCCAAGTCTGT-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGAGTCTTCCAGTGTGATGA-3′ (reverse). The primers for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were 5′-CATTGACCTCAACTACATGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTGCCCACAGCCTTGGCAGC-3′ (reverse). The PCR parameters consisted of an initial cycle of 95 °C for 30 s followed by 28 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 10 s, and 74 °C for 20 s and final extension for 1 min at 74 °C. The amplified PCR products were analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. The products of constitutively expressed glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA served as a control. All of the products were assayed in the linear range of the RT-PCR amplification process. MCF-7 cells were transfected with FLAG-p53 (0.1 μg) and the indicated amounts of either CA Akt or KN Akt for 22 h or treated with LY294002 (10 μm) for 5 h and then treated with 80 μg/ml of cycloheximide for 0, 30, 60, 90, or 120 min as indicated. The cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-FLAG antibody or anti-p53 antibody, and the relative intensity of each band was estimated using densitometry. For bacterial expression of Mdm2, BL21-Gold (DE3) cells (Stratagene) were transformed with Mdm2 pGEX-6P-1, cultured in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml of ampicillin, and induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mm) for 5 h. The cells were harvested, resuspended in a sonication buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and lysed by sonication. Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1%, and the lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The crude lysate was filtered (0.45-μm pore size; Millipore, Bedford, MA) and loaded onto a 2-ml Glutathione-SepharoseTM 4B (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated with 5 volumes of PBS. The column was washed with 10 volumes of Cleavage Buffer (Amersham Biosciences). The glutathione-Sepharose was mixed with PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated at 4 °C for 12 h, and Mdm2 was eluted. Mdm2 was dialyzed against a dialysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1% (v/v) aprotinin. Recombinant active Akt and kinase-negative Akt were prepared as described previously (32Laine J. Kunstle G. Obata T. Sha M. Noguchi M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 395-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 33Obata T. Yaffe M.B. Leparc G.G. Piro E.T. Maegawa H. Kashiwagi A. Kikkawa R. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36108-36115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Recombinant Akt was incubated with substrates (1 μg of recombinant Mdm2 protein) in 15 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 100 μm ATP, and 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (2 μCi) (Amersham Biosciences). The reaction was stopped by the addition of Laemmli's sample buffer. The samples were subsequently resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. The phosphorylation reaction was also carried out without radiolabeled ATP, and the samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-Ser(P)186 Mdm2 antibody. The cells grown on coverslips were fixed for 10 min in PBS containing 3.7% formaldehyde. The fixed coverslips were permeabilized in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min, washed twice in PBS (5 min), and incubated in a blocking buffer (PBS containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin) for 30 min. The cells were then incubated in the blocking buffer containing the primary antibody for 1 h and washed three times in PBS (5 min) before incubation with the appropriate fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody plus Hoechst 33258 (Molecular Probes, Inc.) for a further 30 min. The cells were washed three times in PBS (5 min) and washed in water. The stained cells were mounted on glass slides and examined under a fluorescent microscope (Nikon). The cells were trypsinized, rinsed with PBS, and collected by centrifugation. The cells were then suspended in 300 μl of a hypotonic buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaCl, and 0.005% Nonidet P-40) and placed on ice for 15 min. The cells were then homogenized and spun at 500 × g for 5 min before the supernatant (cytoplasmic fraction) was collected. The remaining pellet was washed with 300 μl of the hypotonic buffer, resuspended in 100 μl of radioimmune precipitation buffer (2 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 1.0% deoxycholate, and 0.025% SDS), sonicated, and spun at 15,000 ×g for 15 min to remove debris and collect the supernatant (nuclear fraction). We confirmed the separation of the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions by Western blotting of MEK1 (a cytoplasmic marker) (34Fukuda M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1901-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) and topoisomerase II α (a nuclear marker) (21Geyer R.K., Yu, Z.K. Maki C.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), respectively. The cells were rinsed with PBS and scraped into 400 μl of radioimmune precipitation buffer. The cells were then sonicated and spun at 15,000 × g for 15 min to remove cellular debris. The supernatants were used as cell lysates. For immunoprecipitation, the cell lysates were incubated with antibody for 1 h on ice and then with protein A-Sepharose (AmershamBiosciences) beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with radioimmune precipitation buffer and then eluted in Laemmli's SDS sample buffer. The elutes were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. The cells were transfected with HA-p53 and FLAG-tagged ubiquitin together with various constructs. The cells were exposed to β-lactone (5 μm) (Calbiochem) for 2 h before the preparation of cell lysates to inhibit proteasome-mediated degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody. Immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. For detection of p53, the blot was probed with anti-p53 antibody. For detection of ubiquitinated p53, the blot was probed with anti-FLAG antibody or anti-p53 antibody. Akt has been shown to suppress p53-dependent apoptosis triggered by hypoxia (28Yamaguchi A. Tamatani M. Matsuzaki H. Namikawa K. Kiyama H. Vitek M.P. Mitsuda N. Tohyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5256-5264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), etoposide, γ-irradiation (data not shown), or ectopic expression of p53 (Ref. 28Yamaguchi A.

Chem. 2001; 276: 5256-5264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar and data not shown). Previous reports have shown that Akt is capable of inhibiting the transcriptional activity of p53 (28Yamaguchi A. Tamatani M. Matsuzaki H. Namikawa K. Kiyama H. Vitek M.P. Mitsuda N. Tohyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5256-5264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 29Mayo L.D. Donner D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11598-11603Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). We confirmed that expression of active Akt reduced the transcriptional activity of a p53 reporter plasmid in MCF-7 cells (Fig.1A). However, the underlying mechanisms of Akt inhibition of p53 remain unclear. To dissect the mechanisms by which Akt inhibits the transcriptional activity of p53, we first investigated whether Akt expression has any effect on the protein and mRNA levels of p53. To examine this, we transfected MCF-7 cells with Akt constructs (the transfection efficiency was about 70%). The amounts of endogenous p53 protein were markedly reduced by expression of active Akt (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the mRNA levels of p53 detected by RT-PCR were unchanged by expression of active Akt (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that Akt reduces the levels of p53 protein but not p53 mRNA in MCF-7 cells. Because it is well established that the level of p53 protein is regulated largely by stability, we then asked whether the stability of p53 was affected by Akt. FLAG-tagged p53 was ectopically expressed in MCF-7 cells along with an Akt plasmid. Titration of the amount of co-transfected Akt plasmid showed that increasing amounts of active Akt correlated with decreased levels of p53 protein (Fig. 1D). The stability of p53 protein was then assessed by the addition of cycloheximide, a translational inhibitor. Two hours of cycloheximide treatment decreased p53 protein by 40% in control cells, whereas the same treatment decreased p53 protein by 80% in active Akt-expressing cells (Fig. 2A), indicating that the degradation rate of p53 protein was greater in active Akt-expressing cells. The amounts of p53 protein were then estimated by densitometry. As shown in Fig. 2B, p53 decayed faster when active Akt was expressed. The degradation enhanced by Akt was blocked by treatment with MG132, a proteasome inhibitor (data not shown). When MCF-7 cells were treated with LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, the stability of endogenous p53 protein increased (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that the PI3K-Akt pathway accelerates p53 degradation. We asked whether Akt might regulate p53 stability by a direct phosphorylation of p53. We found that immunoprecipitated active Akt was not able to phosphorylate p53 in vitro (data not shown), suggesting an indirect regulation of p53 by Akt. The major way in which p53 is degraded is by Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination. Mdm2 is phosphorylated at multiple sites in vivo (35Hay T.J. Meek D.W.

Interestingly, analysis of human Mdm2 sequence revealed two sites (Ser166 and Ser186) that conform to the consensus site phosphorylated by Akt (RXRXX(S/T)), and recent studies have shown that Mdm2 can be phosphorylated by Akt at these sitesin vitro and in insulin-like growth factor-1-treated cells (29Mayo L.D. Donner D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11598-11603Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar, 30Zhou B.P. Liao Y. Xia W. Zou Y. Spohn B. Hung M.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 973-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). The first site (Ser166) is not conserved across species; however the second site (Ser186) is conserved among species as far as we know, suggesting its possible functional importance. We confirmed that active Akt, but not kinase-negative Akt, was capable of inducing Mdm2 phosphorylation in vitro (Fig.3A). To further examine whether Akt phosphorylates Mdm2 at Ser186, we generated a polyclonal antibody that specifically recognizes phosphorylated Ser186 of Mdm2. Upon Western blot analysis, this antibody detected Mdm2 that had been phosphorylated by Akt in vitro(Fig. 3B). The specificity of this antibody was confirmed by its failure to recognize the Mdm2 mutant in which Ser186was mutated into Ala (S186A Mdm2) (Fig. 3B). By the use of anti-Ser(P)186 Mdm2 antibody, we found that serum stimulation increased Ser186 phosphorylation (Fig. 3C). The increase in Ser186phosphorylation was blocked by LY294002, suggesting that PI3K is required for serum induction of Ser186 phosphorylation (Fig. 3C). We also found that active Akt expression was sufficient for inducing Ser186 phosphorylation of Mdm2in vivo. In addition, expression of kinase-negative Akt blocked the serum induction of Ser186 phosphorylation (Fig.3D). These results strongly support the possibility that the PI3K-Akt pathway mediates Mdm2 phosphorylation at Ser186in vivo. We next asked whether Akt phosphorylation of Mdm2 at Ser186has any impact on Mdm2. We first examined whether Akt regulates the stability of Mdm2 protein. Western blot analysis indicated that expression of active Akt did not affect the levels of ectopically expressed Mdm2 (Fig. 4A). In addition, the levels of wild type and S186A mutant of Mdm2 were almost the same when expressed in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 4B). Therefore, Ser186 phosphorylation does not appear to alter the stability of Mdm2 protein. Because Ser186 is located close to the nuclear localization sequence and nuclear export signal of Mdm2 (residues 178–185 and 191–199, respectively), we asked whether Akt phosphorylation of Mdm2 alters its subcellular localization. In MCF-7 cells, endogenous Mdm2 was localized mainly in the nucleus and slightly in the cytoplasm (Fig.5A). In subcellular fractionation experiments, more than 90% of Mdm2 was found in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 5B). Serum and LY294002 treatment did not change the amounts of Mdm2 protein in the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions (Fig. 5B). The localization of Mdm2 did not change upon serum or LY294002 treatment in immunostaining experiments either (Fig. 5A). Expression of active Akt did not induce nuclear translocation of Mdm2 as shown in Fig. 5 (B–D). Furthermore, we found that expression of a dominant-negative Akt (3A Akt) did not change the localization of endogenous Mdm2 in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 5C). Importantly, the localization of S186A Mdm2 as well as S166A/S186A Mdm2 was mainly in the nucleus, indistinguishable from that of wild type Mdm2 when expressed in Saos-2 cells (Fig.5D). Therefore, we conclude that Akt does not induce nuclear translocation of Mdm2 in our system, in apparent contradiction to the previous reports (29Mayo L.D. Donner D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11598-11603Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar, 30Zhou B.P. Liao Y. Xia W. Zou Y. Spohn B. Hung M.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 973-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar) (see “Discussion”). We then tested the possibility that Ser186 phosphorylation regulates the function of Mdm2. Mdm2 is known to promote p53 degradation by facilitating ubiquitination (19Fuchs S.Y. Adler V. Buschmann T., Wu, X. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2543-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Because serum treatment increased Ser186phosphorylation (Fig. 3C), we examined the ability of Mdm2 to promote ubiquitination of p53 in the presence or absence of serum. To detect ubiquitination of p53, MCF-7 cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged ubiquitin and HA-tagged p53 and treated with a proteasome inhibitor for 2 h. p53 was immunoprecipitated and subjected to Western blot analysis with both anti-FLAG antibody and anti-p53 antibody to visualize the ubiquitination of p53. As shown in Fig.6 (A and B), serum treatment markedly enhanced the ubiquitination-inducing effect of Mdm2. This enhancement of p53 ubiquitination was reduced by LY294002 treatment (Fig. 6B), suggesting that serum enhancement of p53 ubiquitination is PI3K-dependent. We examined whether Akt is sufficient to e"

Intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) express low levels of TLR4 and MD-2 and are lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-unresponsive. We hypothesized that immune-mediated signals regulate the expression of TLR4 and MD-2 in IEC. Expression of TLR4 and MD-2 was examined in normal colonic epithelial cells or intestinal epithelial cell lines. The effect of the cytokines interferon (IFN)-γ, IFN-α, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) on TLR4 and MD-2 expression was examined by reverse transcription-PCR and Western blot. NF-κB transcriptional activation and interleukin-8 secretion were used as measures of LPS responsiveness. Native colonic epithelial cells and IEC lines express a low level of TLR4 and MD-2 mRNA.

Pre-incubation with IFN-γ and/or TNF-α sensitizes IEC to LPS-dependent interleukin-8 secretion.

Despite the density of commensal bacteria and their products, the intestinal mucosa maintains a controlled state of inflammation. By contrast, invasive or toxin-producing pathogenic bacteria elicit acute inflammation and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by intestinal epithelial cells and lamina propria mononuclear cells (3Kim J.M.

Commensal gut bacteria include both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms (2Naidu A.S. Bidlack W.R. Clemens R.A. Crit. Rev. Food Sci. Nutr. 1999; 39: 13-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). The cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria contains LPS, a potent pro-inflammatory pathogen-associated molecular pattern responsible for the systemic manifestations of septic shock (12Aderem A. Ulevitch R.J. Nature. 2000; 406: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2624) Google Scholar). The response to LPS is mediated by its interaction with toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in conjunction with secreted MD-2 and soluble or membrane-bound CD14 and transduced via the IL-1 receptor signaling complex to activate NF-κB and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion (13da Silva Correia J.

We and others have previously described that intestinal epithelial cells are unresponsive to purified, protein-free LPS as measured by NF-κB activation and IL-8 secretion (17Abreu M.T. Vora P.

Gastroenterol. Nutr. 2001; 32: 449-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). To determine the reason for LPS unresponsiveness, we assayed for the presence of TLR4 and its co-receptor MD-2 and found that intestinal epithelial cells express low levels of TLR4 and MD-2 (17Abreu M.T. Vora P. Faure E. Thomas L.S. Arnold E.T. Arditi M. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1609-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Expression of both TLR4 and MD-2 restores the ability of intestinal epithelial cells to respond to LPS, suggesting that the intracellular signaling pathway leading to NF-κB is intact in these cells. These in vitro model systems are consistent with findings in normal adult human colonic biopsies, small intestinal resections, and fetal intestinal epithelial cells, which have demonstrated low TLR4 expression by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR (18Naik S. Kelly E.J. Meijer L. Pettersson S. Sanderson I.R. J. Pediatr. Gastroenterol. Nutr. 2001; 32: 449-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 19Cario E. Podolsky D.K. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 7010-7017Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). These studies did not examine the expression of the MD-2 co-receptor, which is required for LPS responsiveness, nor did they measure TLR4 function. Little is known about the regulation of TLR4 or MD-2 expression. Whereas normal intestinal epithelial cells express low levels of TLR4, colonic biopsies from patients with inflammatory bowel disease have increased TLR4 expression (19Cario E. Podolsky D.K. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 7010-7017Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). The pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β can increase the level of TLR4 expression in a human fetal small intestinal epithelial cell line (18Naik S. Kelly E.J. Meijer L. Pettersson S. Sanderson I.R. J. Pediatr. Gastroenterol. Nutr. 2001; 32: 449-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and interferon-consensus sequences have been identified in the TLR4 promoter (20Rehli M. Poltorak A. Schwarzfischer L. Krause S.W. Andreesen R. Beutler B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9773-9781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). These data support the hypothesis that dysregulated expression of TLRs in response to cytokines may contribute to the pathogenesis of idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease and inappropriate responsiveness to commensal bacteria. Because of its intimate contact with commensal bacterial products as well as potential pathogens, the intestinal epithelium must carefully regulate expression of pattern recognition receptors to avoid persistent activation. In the current study, we have examined the role of T cell-derived cytokines on the regulation of TLR4 and MD-2 expression. We have additionally cloned the promoter for MD-2. Our data demonstrate that MD-2 expression and transcriptional activity are positively regulated by interferon (IFN)-γ, whereas TLR4 expression is regulated by IFN-α. Expression of a STAT inhibitor, SOCS3, blocks IFN-γ-mediated increase in MD-2 promoter activity. The results of these studies have important implications for the understanding of host-microbial interactions in the gut.

The oligonucleotide primer sequences for MD-2 were kindly provided by Dr. Jesse C. Chow (Esai Research Institute, Wilmington, MA). GAPDH primers were obtained from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA) and used as per manufacturer's instructions. The TLR2, TLR4, and MD-2 RT-PCR fragments were purified and sequenced to confirm the identity of the fragments. To quantify the level of mRNA expression, RT-PCR products run on a 1% ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel were analyzed on an AlphaImager 2000 densitometer (Alpha Innotech Corp.). AlphaEase software (Alpha Innotech Corp.) was used to compare density of products when corrected for intensity of GAPDH or β-actin expression and -fold induction of expression over unstimulated cells (Table I).Table IRT-PCR primer sequences and PCR conditionsGeneForward primerReverse primerConditionsSize of productbpTLR4 (short)GCTTCTTGCTGGCTGCATAAGAAATGGAGGCACCCCTTC32 cycles at 94 °C for 45 s, 60 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 60 s150MD-2 (short)GCAGAGCTCTGAAGGGAGAGACTGGTTGGTGTAGGATGACATCC32 cycles at 94 °C for 45 s, 60 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 60 s150β-ActinGGCTACAGCTTCACCACCACGGCCAGACAGCAGTGTGTTGGC35 cycles at 94 °C for 45 s, 58 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 60 s300TLR4TGGATACGTTTCCTTATAAGGAAATGGAGGCACCCCTTC38 cycles at 95 °C for 45 s, 54 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 1 min548MD-2GAAGCTCAGAAGCAGTATTGGGTCGGTTGGTGTAGGATGACAAACTCC35 cycles at 94 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 45 s422 Open table in a new tab For TLR4 Western blots, T84 cells were lysed in IP lysis buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 250 mm NaCl, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1:100 Protease Inhibitor Set III (Calbiochem). Protein concentration was determined using a colorimetric assay Bio-Rad DC protein assay. A total of 55 μg of protein was analyzed on a 10% Tris-HCl polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and stained with Ponceau S to verify equal protein loading. Membranes were blocked in 5% milk, 0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline for 2–3 h at 4 °C, incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-human TLR4 antibody (Santa Cruz) (1:250) followed by a 1-h incubation at room temperature with anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (1:2000), developed by Lumiglo (Cell Signaling), and exposed to radiographic film. For human IL-8 ELISA, 10,000 cells/well were plated in 96-well plates. Cells were treated with 50 ng/ml LPS, 40 ng/ml IFN-γ, or 20 ng/ml TNF-α for 18 h and supernatants harvested for measurement of IL-8. IL-8 ELISA (BD PharMingen) were performed as per manufacturer's instructions. Fold increase in IL-8 production was derived by calculating the difference between cytokine-stimulated IL-8 production and cytokine-stimulated plus LPS-mediated IL-8 production. This difference was then divided by LPS-dependent IL-8 production alone. Frozen sections derived from human intestinal resections were obtained under the auspices of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center IRB 1465. The tissue used for this study included uninvolved areas of intestine from patients with inflammatory bowel disease or colon cancer. Slides were gently fixed in 100% ethanol followed by a light hematoxylin and eosin staining. An Arcturus laser capture microscope was used to microdissect the tissue. Briefly, intestinal epithelial cells were identified based on appearance and location, microdissected, and captured on a microcentrifuge cap. Lamina propria was separately microdissected and captured from each intestinal specimen. Photo documentation was obtained before and after dissection. Total RNA was made by incubating cells at −80 °C overnight in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1000 units/ml RNase inhibitor. After lysis and centrifugation, total RNA was followed directly by reverse transcription using random hexamers and Superscript II (Invitrogen). The cDNA generated was amplified as described above, with the exception that 38 cycles were used for amplification. Student's t tests, standard deviation, and standard errors were performed using the statistics package within Microsoft Excel. p values were considered statistically significant when <0.05. We have described our findings in three intestinal epithelial cell lines with respect to the expression and function of TLR4 and MD-2 (17Abreu M.T. Vora P. Faure E. Thomas L.S. Arnold E.T. Arditi M. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1609-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Our finding of low TLR4 expression by intestinal epithelial cells is corroborated by a recent study demonstrating that intestinal epithelial cells from normal human intestinal biopsies express low levels of TLR4 by immunohistochemistry (19Cario E. Podolsky D.K. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 7010-7017Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). To assess the level of MD-2 expression by primary human intestinal epithelial cells, we utilized laser capture microscopy to microdissect intestinal epithelial cells and separate these from lamina propria cells from five distinct colonic resections (Fig. 1 A). Using RT-PCR to examine the expression of TLR4 and MD-2, we found that both colonic epithelial cells and lamina propria-derived cells express a low level of TLR4 (Fig. 1 B). By contrast, our data demonstrate that MD-2 is not expressed in normal colonic epithelial cells but is found in some samples of lamina propria-derived cells (Fig. 1 B). These data support the hypothesis that the intestinal epithelium normally down-regulates expression of TLR4 and MD-2. TLR4 and MD-2 expression is low in intestinal epithelial cells compared with human dermal endothelial cells. IFN-γ has recently been shown to stimulate TLR4 expression in endothelial cells (35Faure E. Thomas L., Xu, H. Medvedev A. Equils O. Arditi M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 2018-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) and HL-60 monocytic cells (36Mita Y. Dobashi K. Nakazawa T. Mori M. Br. J.

Podolsky D.K. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 7010-7017Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). Because inflammatory bowel disease is associated with increased mucosal production of the Th1 cytokines IFN-γ and TNF-α, we hypothesized that these cytokines regulated expression of TLR4 and its co-receptor MD-2 in intestinal epithelial cells (39Papadakis K.A. Targan S.R. Gastroenterology. 2000; 119: 1148-1157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 40Plevy S.E. Landers C.J. Prehn J. Carramanzana N.M. Deem R.L. Shealy D. Targan S.R. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 6276-6282PubMed Google Scholar). We tested this hypothesis by exposing T84, a crypt-like intestinal epithelial cell line (41Madara J.L. Dharmsathaphorn K. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 2124-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), and HT-29 cells, a colonocyte-like intestinal epithelial cell line, to the cytokines IFN-γ, TNF-α, or a combination of the two and evaluated expression of messenger RNA for TLR4 and MD-2 by RT-PCR (Fig. 2 A). With respect to TLR4 expression (Fig. 2 A, top panels), IFN-γ and TNF-α modestly increased TLR4 expression, which was highest at 24 h in HT-29 cells and 6 h in T84 cells. MD-2 expression by contrast (Fig. 2 A, middle panels) was primarily regulated by IFN-γ in both IEC lines. IL-1β, which potently induces IL-8 secretion by CaCo-2 cells, had no effect on TLR4 expression (data not shown). Expression of TLR4 protein was subsequently evaluated by Western blotting in T84 cells (Fig. 2 C). As expected, resting T84 cells do not have detectable TLR4 protein. TNF-α treatment of T84 cells permits a low level of TLR4 detection. In summary, Th1 cytokines differentially regulate the expression of TLR4 and MD-2 in intestinal epithelial cells in vitro. The relative absence of TLR4 protein expression suggests that mRNA expression may not be directly correlated with protein expression.

https://openalex.org/W2079589567,"Astrocytes play a key role in the pathogenesis of ammonia-induced neurotoxicity and hepatic encephalopathy. As shown here, ammonia induces protein tyrosine nitration in cultured rat astrocytes, which is sensitive to the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist MK-801. A similar pattern of nitrated proteins is produced by NMDA. Ammonia-induced tyrosine nitration depends on a rise in [Ca2+]i, IkB degradation, and NO synthase (iNOS) induction, which are prevented by MK-801 and the intracellular Ca2+ chelator 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA-AM). Moreover, the increase in tyrosine nitration is blunted by L-NMMA, 1400W, uric acid, Cu, Zn-superoxide dismutase/catalase treatment, and methionine-sulfoximine, which indicate the involvement of reactive nitrogen intermediates and intracellular glutamine accumulation. Such reactive nitrogen intermediates additionally mediate ammonia-induced phosphorylation of the MAP-kinases Erk-1/Erk-2 and p38MAPK. Among the proteins, which are tyrosine -nitrated by ammonia, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor, Erk-1, and glutamine synthetase are identified. Ammonia-induced nitration of glutamine synthetase is associated with a loss of enzymatic activity. Astroglial protein tyrosine nitration is found in brains from rats after acute ammonia-intoxication or after portacaval anastomosis, indicating the in vivo relevance of the present findings. The production of reactive nitrogen intermediates and protein tyrosine nitration may alter astrocyte function and contribute to ammonia neurotoxicity."

One level of regulation appears to be the synthesis and hydrolysis of IAA conjugates, which function in both the permanent inactivation and temporary storage of auxin. Similar to free IAA, certain IAA-amino acid conjugates inhibit root elongation. We have tested the ability of 19 IAA-l-amino acid conjugates to inhibit Arabidopsis seedling root growth. We have also determined the ability of purified glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusions of four ArabidopsisIAA-amino acid hydrolases (ILR1, IAR3, ILL1, and ILL2) to release free IAA by cleaving these conjugates. Each hydrolase cleaves a subset of IAA-amino acid conjugates in vitro, and GST-ILR1, GST-IAR3, and GST-ILL2 have Km values that suggest physiological relevance. In vivo inhibition of root elongation correlates with in vitro hydrolysis rates for each conjugate, suggesting that the identified hydrolases generate the bioactivity of the conjugates.

Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) 1The abbreviations used are: IAAindole-3-acetic acidPNSplant nutrient medium plus sucroseGSTglutathione S-transferaseHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatography is the most abundant naturally occurring auxin in plants. IAA acts in virtually every aspect of plant development from embryogenesis to senescence (1Davies P.J. Davies P.J. Plant Hormones. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 1-38Crossref Google Scholar). IAA can occur either as the hormonally active free acid or in bound forms in which the carboxyl group is conjugated to sugars via ester linkages or to amino acids or peptides via amide linkages (reviewed in Ref. 2Cohen J.D. Bandurski R.S. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1982; 33: 403-430Crossref Google Scholar). Certain IAA conjugates have auxin activity in bioassays and in tissue culture (reviewed in Ref. 3Bartel B. LeClere S. Magidin M. Zolman B.K. J. Plant Growth Regul. 2001; 20: 198-216Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar), but the functions of endogenous auxin conjugates remain poorly understood. Conjugates have been proposed to have roles in storing, transporting, and compartmentalizing auxins, as well as in detoxifying excess IAA and protecting the free acid against peroxidative degradation (2Cohen J.D. Bandurski R.S. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1982; 33: 403-430Crossref Google Scholar). indole-3-acetic acid plant nutrient medium plus sucrose glutathione S-transferase high pressure liquid chromatography Certain IAA conjugates can be enzymatically hydrolyzed, producing free IAA. IAA-Ala is hydrolyzed by extracts of Chinese cabbage (4Ludwig-Müller J. Epstein E. Hilgenberg W. Physiol. Plant. 1996; 97: 627-634Crossref Google Scholar), by pea stem segments (5Hangarter R.P. Good N.E. Plant Physiol. 1981; 68: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and by purified GST-IAR3 enzyme (6Davies R.T. Goetz D.H. Lasswell J. Anderson M.N. Bartel B. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). This hydrolysis correlates with IAA-Ala activity in bioassays. For example, the curvature generated by IAA-Ala applied to bean stem sections is directly related to the measured amount of IAA released from IAA-Ala (7Bialek K. Meudt W.J. Cohen J.D. Plant Physiol. 1983; 73: 130-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Similarly, IAA-Leu, IAA-Phe, IAA-glucose, and IAA-myo-inositol are active in bioassays and are hydrolyzed by plant extracts and/or purified enzymes (4Ludwig-Müller J. Epstein E. Hilgenberg W. Physiol. Plant. 1996; 97: 627-634Crossref Google Scholar, 6Davies R.T. Goetz D.H. Lasswell J. Anderson M.N. Bartel B.

Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1990: 93-106Google Scholar). Hydrolyzable conjugates probably provide a readily accessible storage form of IAA. For example, IAA conjugates stored in seeds are rapidly hydrolyzed following imbibition to yield the IAA necessary for germination (11Bialek K. Cohen J.D. Plant Physiol. 1992; 100: 2002-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar,12Epstein E. Cohen J.D. Bandurski R.S. Plant Physiol. 1980; 65: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In contrast, other conjugates such as IAA-Asp can be intermediates in the oxidative degradation of IAA and are not hydrolyzed in vivo (13Östin A. Kowalyczk M. Bhalerao R. Sandberg G. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 14Östin A. Moritz T. Sandberg G. Biol. Mass Spectrom. 1992; 21: 292-298Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Although the plant enzymes that synthesize IAA-amino acid conjugates have not been identified, IAA levels apparently regulate which conjugates are formed. For example, the auxin-overproducing mutant sur2 accumulates more IAA-Asp than wild type (15Barlier I. Kowalczyk M. Marchant A. Ljung K. Bhalerao R. Bennett M. Sandberg G. Bellini C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14819-14824Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) but synthesizes less of the hydrolyzable IAA-Leu (8Bartel B. Fink G.R. Science. 1995; 268: 1745-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) from applied IAA (15Barlier I. Kowalczyk M. Marchant A. Ljung K. Bhalerao R. Bennett M. Sandberg G. Bellini C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14819-14824Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Certain IAA-amino acid conjugates have activities that are only partially explained by hydrolysis (to release IAA), suggesting that conjugates may have hydrolysis-independent functions. For example, pretreating tomato cell cultures with IAA-Ala inhibits IAA-induced shoot growth and root initiation, suggesting that IAA and some conjugates may compete for a binding site(s) (16Magnus V. Hangarter R.P. Good N.E. J. Plant Growth Regul. 1992; 11: 67-75Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Several conjugates have been identified and quantified in plants, including IAA-myo-inositol, IAA-glucose, and a large ester-linked cellulosic glucan conjugate in maize (17Piskornik A. Bandurski R.S. Plant Physiol. 1972; 50: 176-182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); IAA-Asp and IAA-Glu in soybean (18Cohen J.D. Plant Physiol. 1982; 70: 749-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 19Epstein E.

Plant genes involved in synthesizing ester-linked IAA conjugates and hydrolyzing amide-linked IAA conjugates have been identified.Iaglu from maize (24Szerszen J.B. Szczyglowski K. Bandurski R.S.

ILR1 and IAR3 encode IAA-amino acid hydrolases that were identified through mutant screens in Arabidopsis. ilr1 and iar3 mutant plants are less sensitive than wild type to IAA-Leu and IAA-Ala, respectively (6Davies R.T.

Science. 1995; 268: 1745-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), and the ILR1 and IAR3 proteins are 46% identical to each other. Five additional Arabidopsis amidohydrolase-like genes have been identified based on homology (Fig. 1). ILL1 and ILL2 (8Bartel B. Fink G.R. Science. 1995; 268: 1745-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) are 87% identical to each other, ∼57% identical to IAR3, and ∼44% identical to ILR1. ILL3 is 42–48% identical to other hydrolases, and ILL5 is an apparent pseudogene most similar to IAR3 (6Davies R.T. Goetz D.H. Lasswell J. Anderson M.N. Bartel B. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). A genomic sequence recently deposited in GenBankTM (GR1; GenBankTMaccession number CAA09330) potentially encodes a protein that we refer to as ILL6 (cDNA GenBankTM accession number AY065996) that is 45–48% identical to the other hydrolases. All of the Arabidopsis amidohydrolase-like proteins contain N-terminal sequences predicted to target insertion into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and all except ILL3 and ILL6/GR1 encode C-terminal putative ER retention signals, suggesting that most family members localize to the ER lumen (6Davies R.T. Goetz D.H. Lasswell J. Anderson M.N. Bartel B. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 8Bartel B. Fink G.R. Science. 1995; 268: 1745-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Although these Arabidopsis hydrolases lack close homologs in non-plant eukaryotes, they resemble (19–34% identical) microbial hydrolases (Fig. 1) that accept diverse substrates, including IAA-Asp (26Chou J.-C. Mulbry W.W. Cohen J.D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1988; 259: 172-178Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar), acetylated amino acids (27Sakanyan V. Desmarez L. Legrain C. Charlier D. Mett I. Kochikyan A.

Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2396-2402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One measure of IAA-amino acid conjugate activity is the ability of certain conjugates to inhibit Arabidopsis root elongation (6Davies R.T. Goetz D.H. Lasswell J. Anderson M.N. Bartel B. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 8Bartel B. Fink G.R. Science. 1995; 268: 1745-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 30Campanella J.J.

Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 2395-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Because the profile of endogenous IAA conjugates is still incomplete for Arabidopsis and most other plants, we wished to determine which IAA-amino acid conjugates display auxin-like activity in this bioassay and to determine whether auxin activity correlates with the ability of purified amidohydrolases to cleave these conjugates. Here we describe the synthesis of 13 IAA-l-amino acid conjugates and compare the activities of 19 IAA-l-amino acid conjugates on wild type and mutant Arabidopsis root elongation. We also describe purification of GST fusions of the amidohydrolases ILR1, IAR3, ILL1, and ILL2 and compare the in vitro enzymatic activity of these hydrolases, including rates of hydrolysis, pH optima, cofactor requirements, and kinetics. IAA-Ala, IAA-Asp, IAA-Ile, IAA-Leu, IAA-Phe, and IAA-Val were purchased from Aldrich; other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. The remaining conjugates were synthesized by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCI)-activated condensation (32De Napoli L. Evidente A. Piccialli G. Santacroce C. Iacobellis N.S. Phytochemistry. 1993; 33: 13-16Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar) of IAA and l-amino acid esters, followed by base saponification to remove ester-protecting groups and yield IAA-amino acid conjugates. Protected l-amino acids used were methyl esters for Gly, His, Met, Pro, Ser, Trp, Thr, and Tyr; dimethyl esters for cystine and Glu; t-butyl esters for Asn and Gln; Nε-CBz ester for Lys; and N G,N G-di-CBz ester for Arg. IAA, the protected amino acid ester, triethylamine, and DCCI were dissolved in methylene chloride and incubated at room temperature with stirring. When TLC monitoring determined that reactions had gone to completion, they were quenched by adding water to a final concentration of 10%. Dicyclohexylurea was removed by gravity filtration, reactions were dried in vacuo, and products were dissolved in 10% methanol in chloroform. The protected IAA conjugates were then purified on a silica gel column using a solvent system of 10% methanol in chloroform. Pure fractions were combined, dried in vacuo, and dissolved in methanol. Conjugates were deprotected by KOH saponification at room temperature, except for IAA-Pro, which was deprotected in formic acid at 37 °C. Because IAA-Arg did not readily deprotect but yielded an array of products, the synthesis of this conjugate was abandoned. Deprotected conjugates were purified on a silica gel column using a solvent system of 50% 2-butanone, 30% ethyl acetate, 10% ethanol, and 10% water (33Ehmann A. J. Chromatogr. 1977; 132: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Fractions containing the pure amino acid conjugate were combined and dried in vacuo to give a crystalline powder. Conjugates were assayed for purity by TLC and HPLC (model 1100 series binary pump; Hewlett Packard, Wilmington, DE) and found to be ∼99% pure (free of IAA). To obtain purity of >99.9% for bioassays, conjugates were further purified by reverse phase HPLC on a Phenomenex Prodigy 10μ ODS preparative 250 × 21.20-mm column in a solvent system of 50% methanol in 1% acetic acid with a flow rate of 4 ml/min. Pure fractions were collected using a Foxy® Jr. fraction collector (ISCO, Lincoln, NE), combined, dried in vacuo, and stored at −20 °C. Before use, conjugates were dissolved in 50 or 100% ethanol to a stock concentration of 20 to 100 mm, depending on solubility. Conjugates, from 20 to 100 mm stocks in 50 or 100% ethanol, were added to plant nutrient medium including 0.5% sucrose (PNS) (34Haughn G.W. Somerville C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1986; 204: 430-434Crossref Scopus (483) Google Scholar) solidified with 0.6% agar. Arabidopsis seeds from the Wassilewskija accession (wild type), ilr1–1 (8Bartel B. Fink G.R. Science. 1995; 268: 1745-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), iar3–2 (6Davies R.T. Goetz D.H. Lasswell J. Anderson M.N. Bartel B. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), and ilr1–1 iar3–2 were surface-sterilized and plated on PNS medium containing 40 μm IAA-amino acid. Plates were incubated at 22 °C under yellow long-pass filters (35Hangarter R.P. Peterson M.D. Good N.E. Plant Physiol. 1980; 65: 761-767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with constant illumination (25–45 μE m−2 s−2). After 8 days, plants were removed from the agar, primary root lengths were measured, and the average root length was calculated. The amidohydrolases (without the predicted N-terminal signal sequences) were expressed in Escherichia coli as fusions to the C terminus of GST. pGEX-ILR1 was made by introducing an NdeI site at codons 22–23 in the ILR1 cDNA (8Bartel B. Fink G.R. Science. 1995; 268: 1745-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and subcloning the NdeI-EcoRI fragment into pGEX-KTO (6Davies R.T. Goetz D.H. Lasswell J. Anderson M.N. Bartel B. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) cut with the same enzymes. pGEX-ILL1 and pGEX-ILL2 encode GST fused to the ILL1 or ILL2 cDNAs (8Bartel B. Fink G.R. Science. 1995; 268: 1745-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) at codon 23 or 25, respectively. pGEX-IAR3 was previously described (6Davies R.T. Goetz D.H. Lasswell J. Anderson M.N. Bartel B. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). For protein expression, single colonies from freshly transformed BL21 (DE3) E. coli cells were inoculated into 100 ml of Luria broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and grown for 6–8 h at 37 °C. Cultures were allowed to cool to room temperature, induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 50 μm and grown overnight with shaking at 18 °C. Proteins were purified as described (6Davies R.T. Goetz D.H. Lasswell J. Anderson M.N. Bartel B. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and stored at −80 °C until analysis. Proteins were quantified using SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining next to bovine serum albumin standards of known concentration. To assess whether the GST fusion proteins were similarly folded, buffer was exchanged into 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, and proteins were concentrated to ∼0.4 mg/ml using Microcon YM-30 centrifugal filter devices (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Circular dichroism spectra were collected on an AVIV model 62A DS circular dichroism spectrometer. For preliminary activity assays, reactions contained 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mm IAA-amino acid, and between 2 and 20 ng/μl GST fusion protein. Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 16–24 h. To determine whether any IAA was released from the conjugate, reaction products were separated by TLC in ethyl acetate/2-butanone/ethanol/water (5:3:1:1) (36Percival F.W. Bandurski R.S. Plant Physiol. 1976; 58: 60-67Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), then stained with Van Urk-Salkowski reagent to visualize indolic compounds (33Ehmann A. J. Chromatogr. 1977; 132: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Under these conditions GST-ILR1, GST-IAR3, GST-ILL1, and GST-ILL2 released IAA from one or more conjugates. To quantify hydrolysis, GST fusion proteins were diluted in 100 μl of hydrolysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5 for GST-ILR1 and GST-ILL1 or pH 8.0 for GST-ILL2 and GST-IAR3), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mm IAA-amino acid) to a final concentration of 15 ng/μl for GST-IAR3 and GST-ILL2, 10 ng/μl for GST-ILR1, 100 ng/μl for GST-ILL1, and 10 ng/μl for GST. All assays were performed at room temperature. At each time point, 15 μl of the reaction was stopped by dilution in 135 μl of methanol with 1% acetic acid and stored at −20 °C until HPLC analysis. For GST-ILR1 and GST-ILL1, time points were taken at 1, 3, 5, and 20 h for all conjugates. For GST-ILL2, time points were taken at 15, 30, 45, and 60 min. For GST-IAR3, time points were taken at 2, 3, and 5 h for IAA-Ala, -Asp, -Gly, -Ser, and -Thr; 4, 6, and 24 h for IAA-Phe, -Ile, -Leu, and -Trp; 2, 4, and 7 h for IAA-Glu, -His, -Lys, -Asn, and -Gln; and 2, 5, and 7 h for IAA-Cys, -Met, -Pro, -Val and -Tyr. The percentage of IAA released from each conjugate was determined using HPLC. Following centrifugation to pellet insoluble material, 100 μl of each sample was injected on a Phenomenex Ultracarb 5μ ODS30 50 × 4.6-mm reverse phase column. Flow rate was either 2 or 3 ml/min. The solvent system was 1% acetic acid in 20% methanol for IAA-Ala, -Asp, -Gly, -Ser, -Thr, -Glu, -His, -Lys, -Asn, and -Gln; 1% acetic acid in 50% methanol for IAA-Phe, -Ile, -Leu, and -Trp; a gradient from 20 to 100% methanol over 30 min with 1% acetic acid throughout for IAA-Cys, -Met, -Pro, -Val and -Tyr; or a gradient from 15 to 100% methanol over 25 min for Km, metal cofactor, and pH experiments. Rates were calculated as nanomoles of IAA released per minute per milligram of fusion protein for each time point. For pH optimization, all reactions contained 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 1 mm IAA-Ala plus either 50 mm HEPES (pH 6.5, 7.0, or 7.5) or 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5, 8.0, or 8.5). Protein concentrations for the purified enzymes were the same as for the rate determination, and reaction volumes were 50 μl. For GST-ILR1, GST-IAR3, and GST-ILL1, reactions were stopped as described above at 2.5 h. For GST-ILL2, reactions were stopped at 10 min. Released IAA was measured by HPLC as described above. For cofactor optimization, reactions contained 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmIAA-Ala, and either 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, for GST-ILL1 or 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, for GST-ILL2 and GST-IAR3. For GST-ILR1, reactions contained 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmIAA-Phe, and 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5. Metal cofactors or EDTA was added to a 1 mm final concentration from 10 mm stocks in water of ZnSO4, CuSO4, MnCl2, CoCl2, CaCl2, MgCl2, or EDTA. Reactions were stopped as described above at 10 or 20 min for GST-ILL2 and at 2.5 or 4 h for the other proteins. IAA released was quantified by HPLC as described above. Purified GST fusions of each amidohydrolase were incubated with varying concentrations of IAA-Ala or IAA-Leu, and the reaction rate was determined at each concentration. IAA-Ala concentrations were 1, 30, 60, 100, and 600 μmand 1 mm. IAA-Leu concentrations were 1, 30, 60, 100, 300, and 600 μm for GST-ILR1 and GST-ILL2, and 1, 30, 60, 100, and 600 μm and 1 mm for GST-IAR3 and GST-ILL1. Protein concentrations were 1 ng/μl for GST-ILL2, 5 ng/μl for GST-IAR3 and GST-ILR1, and 10 ng/μl for GST-ILL1. Reaction times were 5, 16, and 20 min for GST-ILL2; 3 and 5 h for GST-IAR3; 5 h for GST-ILL1; 60 and 90 min for GST-ILR1 with IAA-Leu; and 3 h for GST-ILR1 with IAA-Ala. pH was 7.5 for GST-ILR1 and GST-ILL1 and 8.0 for GST-ILL2 and GST-IAR3. All reactions contained 1 mm MnCl2 and 1 mm dithiothreitol.Vmax and Km values were calculated using Igor Pro v. 3.16b software (Wavemetrics, Inc., Lake Oswego, OR). To systematically analyze the Arabidopsis amidohydrolase family, we first synthesized and purified 13 IAA-amino acid conjugates that are not commercially available (see “Experimental Procedures”). Wild type, ilr1, iar3, and ilr1 iar3 seedlings were then grown on medium containing 40 μm IAA-amino acid conjugate for 8 days, and mean root lengths were compared with lengths on unsupplemented medium (Fig. 2). In addition to the previously reported IAA-Ala, -Leu, and -Phe (6Davies R.T. Goetz D.H. Lasswell J. Anderson M.N. Bartel B. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 8Bartel B. Fink G.R. Science. 1995; 268: 1745-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), IAA-l-amino acid conjugates that efficiently inhibited wild type root elongation include IAA-Asn, -Gln, -Glu, -Gly, -Met, -Ser, -Thr and -Tyr, all of which inhibited root elongation by greater than fifty percent at 40 μm. In contrast, other conjugates did not efficiently inhibit root elongation, such as IAA-Asp, -Cys, -His, -Ile, -Lys, -Pro, -Trp, and -Val, which inhibited elongation by less than fifty percent at 40 μm. As previously shown with IAA-Ala, IAA-Leu, and IAA-Phe (6Davies R.T. Goetz D.H. Lasswell J. Anderson M.N. Bartel B. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), the hydrolase mutants ilr1–1 and iar3–2 were less sensitive to the inhibitory effects of many bioactive conjugates, and the double mutant ilr1–1 iar3–2 was less sensitive to all of the bioactive conjugates (Fig. 2). This suggests that at least part of the auxin activity of these conjugates requires hydrolysis to release free IAA. Inactive conjugates might either be poor substrates of the hydrolases or enter plant cells inefficiently. To distinguish between these possibilities, we examined the in vitro substrate specificities of the amidohydrolases. Extracts from E. coli expressing ILR1 acquire the ability to hydrolyze IAA-Phe and IAA-Leu (8Bartel B. Fink G.R. Science. 1995; 268: 1745-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), and a purified GST-IAR3 fusion hydrolyzes IAA-Ala (6Davies R.T. Goetz D.H. Lasswell J. Anderson M.N. Bartel B. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). To extend this analysis to include kinetic parameters, additional conjugates, and additional enzymes, we expressed four of the Arabidopsis amidohydrolases as fusions to GST and purified the recombinant proteins (see “Experimental Procedures”). Circular dichroism spectroscopy suggested that all four purified fusion proteins were similarly folded (data not shown). In addition to GST-ILR1 and GST-IAR3, GST-ILL1 and GST-ILL2 hydrolyzed a subset of the IAA-amino acid conjugates. We therefore undertook a systematic comparison of GST-ILR1, GST-IAR3, GST-ILL1, and GST-ILL2 with the 19 IAA-amino acid conjugates. For pH optimization, purified GST-hydrolase fusions were incubated with IAA-Ala in HEPES- or Tris-buffered reactions, and the rate of hydrolysis for each was determined by HPLC quantification of IAA released from the conjugate (see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Table I, GST-ILL2, like GST-IAR3 (6Davies R.T. Goetz D.H. Lasswell J. Anderson M.N. Bartel B. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), was most active at pH 8, whereas GST-ILR1 and GST-ILL1 were more active at pH 7.5. All the hydrolases preferred Tris buffer to HEPES. For metal ion cofactor analysis, GST-hydrolase fusions were incubated with IAA-Ala or IAA-Phe in Tris-buffered reactions with ZnSO4, CuSO4, MnCl2, CoCl2, CaCl2, MgCl2, or EDTA, and hydrolysis rates were calculated. As shown in Table II, all hydrolases preferred manganese as a cofactor, and ILR1 could also utilize copper. Cobalt supported some activity with all hydrolases but precipitated out of solution in the presence of dithiothreitol and is therefore not shown.Table IpH dependence of Arabidopsis amidohydrolasesBuffer (pH)Hydrolase activityGST-ILR1GST-IAR3GST-ILL1GST-ILL2GSTnmol IAA released from IAA-Ala/min/mgHEPES (6.5)4.46.92.0290< 1.0HEPES (7.0)10265.6660< 1.0HEPES (7.5)13387.9600< 1.0Tris (7.5)1463201,900< 1.0Tris (8.0)< 1.01-aThe detection limit was 1.0 nmol/min/mg.75142,200< 1.0Tris (8.5)< 1.0191.81,200< 1.01-a The detection limit was 1.0 nmol/min/mg.

Open table in a new tab To compare the substrate specificities of the enzymes, purified GST fusions of each amidohydrolase were incubated with each of 19 IAA-l-amino acid conjugates. The amount of IAA liberated from the conjugate was measured by HPLC at three or more time points, and the average hydrolysis rates are shown in Table III. Similarly purified and incubated GST did not detectably hydrolyze any of the conjugates (data not shown). All four hydrolases cleaved several IAA-amino acid conjugates, including IAA-Ala. IAA-Phe was the best substrate of GST-ILR1, whereas GST-ILL2 and GST-IAR3 cleaved IAA-Ala most efficiently. GST-ILL1 hydrolysis was restricted to IAA-Ala, IAA-Asn, and IAA-Tyr, which were all cleaved at similar rates. Interestingly, GST-ILL2 hydrolyzed its preferred substrate, IAA-Ala, at least 60-fold faster than any of the other hydrolases. Although they hydrolyze more slowly, ILR1 and IAR3 clearly contribute to in vivo IAA-amino acid conjugate hydrolysis, because loss-of-function mutations in these enzymes confer resistance to exogenous conjugates (Fig. 2) (6Davies R.T.

https://openalex.org/W1562490776,"We have developed synthetic hydrogel extracellular matrix (ECM) analogues that can be used to study mechanisms involved in cell migration, such as receptor-ligand interactions and proteolysis. The biomimetic hydrogels consist of bioinert polyethylene glycol diacrylate derivatives with proteolytically degradable peptide sequences included in the backbone of the polymer and adhesive peptide sequences grafted to the network. Hydrogels have been developed that degrade as cells secrete proteolytic enzymes. Adhesive peptide sequences grafted to the hydrogel provide ligands that can interact with receptors on the cell surface to mediate adhesion and spreading. In this study, we have characterized the effects of adhesive ligand density on fibroblast migration through collagenase-degradable and plasmin-degradable hydrogels and on smooth muscle cell migration through elastase-degradable hydrogels. In all three cases, we found that cell migration has a biphasic dependence on adhesion ligand concentration, with optimal migration at intermediate ligand levels. Furthermore, both adhesive and proteolytically degradable sequences were required for cell migration to occur. These synthetic ECM analogues may be useful for 3-D mechanistic studies of many aspects of cell migration"

To elucidate the mechanism for CXCR4 activation, a constitutively active mutant (CAM) was derived by coupling the receptor to the pheromone response pathway in yeast. Conversion of Asn-119 to Ser or Ala, but not Asp or Lys, conferred autonomous CXCR4 signaling in yeast and mammalian cells. SDF-1 induced signaling in variants with substitution of Asn-119 to Ser, Ala, or Asp, but not Lys. These variants had similar cell surface expression and binding affinity for SDF-1. CXCR4-CAMs were constitutively phosphorylated and present in cytosolic inclusions. Analysis of antagonists revealed that exposure to AMD3100 or ALX40-4C induced G protein activation by CXCR4 wild type, which was greater in the CAM, whereas T140 decreased autonomous signaling. The affinity of AMD3100 and ALX40-4C binding to CAMs was less than to wild type, providing evidence of a conformational shift. These results illustrate the importance of transmembrane helix 3 in CXCR4 signaling. Insight into the mechanism for CXCR4 antagonists will allow for the development of a new generation of agents that lack partial agonist activity that may induce toxicities, as observed for AMD3100.

Binding of AMD3100 to CXCR4 has been reported to involve residues in transmembrane helix (TM) 4 and extracellular loop 3 (14Gerlach L.O. Skerlj R.T. Bridger G.J. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol.

The importance of CXCR4 as a potential molecular target in HIV-1 infection and breast cancer provides a strong rationale for characterizing the mechanism of the action of CXCR4 antagonists and development of second generation antagonists with more favorable pharmacological properties.Here we have adopted a Saccharomyces cerevisiae expression system to couple CXCR4 signaling to growth in the absence of histidine (17Klein C. Paul J.I. Sauve K. Schmidt M.M. Arcangeli L. Ransom J. Trueheart J. Manfredi J.P. Broach J.R. Murphy A.J. Nat.

The amino acid substitution that conferred this phenotype involved Asn-119, which is located in TM3, and further mutagenesis revealed substitutions that stabilized inactive or active receptor conformations in yeast and mammalian cells. Characterization of CXCR4 antagonists revealed that T140 is an inverse agonist and that AMD3100 and ALX40-4C are weak partial agonists. Whereas binding studies failed to reveal evidence of changes in extracellular domains in active or inactive variants, the decreased affinity of CAMs for AMD3100 and ALX40-4C signifies a conformational shift, most likely in the hydrophobic core of CXCR4. Variants with autonomous signaling were chronically phosphorylated and internalized. These findings illustrate the importance of TM3 conformation in the rearrangement in the hydrophobic core of CXCR4 that leads to Gα subunit activation and provide insight into the clinical effects of AMD3100. Utilization of GPCR CAMs in pharmaceutical screening provides an efficient and powerful approach for identification of novel antagonists.DISCUSSIONHere we demonstrate that Asn-119 plays a critical role in the mechanism of CXCR4 signaling through its regulation of TM3 conformation. Conversion of Asn-119 to Ser or Ala was found to drive the conformational equilibrium of CXCR4 to the active state, manifested by autonomous signaling. In contrast, substitution of Lys for Asn-119 induced a conformation of TM3 that favors the inactive state, rendering CXCR4 unresponsive to SDF-1 binding, rendering CXCR4 unresponsive to SDF-1 without affecting the binding. The autonomous coupling of the CXCR4-CAMs to Gi/oα subunits was augmented by SDF binding, consistent with stabilization of an optimal active conformation. AMD3100 and ALX40-4C were also found to increase the signaling of CXCR4-CAMs and, to a lesser extent, that of CXCR4-WT, indicating that they are weak partial agonists. In contrast, T140 was found to be an inverse agonist that reversed the conformational equilibrium induced by activating mutations to stabilize the inactive form. Although there was no evidence for altered architecture of CXCR4 extracellular domains, significant decreases in the affinity of AMD3100 and ALX40-4C binding provided objective evidence for a conformational shift in the hydrophobic core of the receptor.The availability of CXCR4-CAMs should provide a powerful tool for high throughput screening for antagonists. Agents that inhibit the WT receptor may increase or reduce the signaling of CAMs, depending on whether the mechanism of action is that of a weak partial agonist, such as AMD3100 and ALX40-4C, or an inverse agonist, such as T140. The effects of AMD3100 and ALX40-4C on CXCR4 signaling were amplified in the CAMs despite a significant decrease in the affinity, presumably because the threshold for receptor activation was diminished in the variants.Engagement of GPCR by ligand results in a conformational shift of the hydrophobic core and cytoplasmic domains to a state permissive for the formation of a high affinity ternary complex with Gα subunits (20Ghanouni P. Steenhuis J.J. Farrens D.L. Kobilka B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5997-6002Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). It is predicted that Asn-119 is located midway between the extracellular and cytoplasmic interfaces of the TM3 helix of CXCR4 and is oriented toward the center of the hydrophobic core based on comparison with the rhodopsin crystal structure (21Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A., Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (4991) Google Scholar). The N(L/F)YSS motif is highly conserved in TM3 of receptors for CXC chemokines and may play a critical role as a switch that maintains the dynamic conformational equilibrium that regulates coupling to Gα subunits. AMD3100 binding has been reported to involve Asp-171, which is predicted to reside in TM4 (14Gerlach L.O. Skerlj R.T. Bridger G.J. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14153-14160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). This supports the interpretation that the binding pocket for this partial agonist involves regions in the hydrophobic core. Thus the decrease in binding affinity of CAMs reflects a conformational shift in this region of CXCR4. The absence of alterations in SDF-1, T140, and 12G5 binding by the CAMs provides evidence that TM3 has sufficient intrinsic flexibility to permit significant internal rearrangement of the hydrophobic core without altering the architecture of extracellular domains.Constitutively active variants of several GPCR have been described, either as a natural occurrence or as the product of genetic manipulations (22Ren Q.

The GPCR encoded by the KSHV (KSHV-GPCR) is genetically related to the chemokine receptor family (30Cesarman E. Nador R.G. Bai F. Bohenzky R.A. Russo J.J. Moore P.S. Chang Y. Knowles D.M. J.

This receptor displays ligand-independent, constitutive activity that is mediated by the phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C signaling pathway (33Arvanitakis L. Geras-Raaka E. Varma A. Gershengorn M.C. Cesarman E. Nature. 1997; 385: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). The KSHV-GPCR binds multiple chemokines that may serve as agonists (34Gershengorn M.C. Geras-Raaka E. Varma A. Clark-Lewis I. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1469-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) or inverse agonists (35Geras-Raaka E. Varma A., Ho, H. Clark-Lewis I. Gershengorn M.C. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 405-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The precise mechanism for the autonomous activity of this receptor is unclear, because it differs significantly from even the most closely related genomically encoded receptor at the level of primary structure. It has been shown that charged residues at the interface of TM3 (Arg-143) and TM2 (Asp-83) with the adjacent cytoplasmic interhelical loops influence the constitutive activity of this receptor (36Ho H.H. Ganeshalingam N. Rosenhouse-Dantsker A. Osman R. Gershengorn M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1376-1382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Whereas CXCR4-CAM signaling in CHO cells was sensitive to pertussis toxin, KSHV-GPCR signaling in endothelial cells involves multiple pathways, including pertussis toxin-sensitive and -insensitive mechanisms (37Couty J.P.

Chem. 2001; 276: 33805-33811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).The CXCR4-CAMs demonstrate evidence of chronic desensitization, as has been observed in autonomously active variants of multiple GPCR (23Pei G. Samama P. Lohse M. Wang M. Codina J. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2699-2702Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar,25Westphal R.S. Backstrom J.R. Sanders-Bush E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 200-205PubMed Google Scholar), that involves receptor phosphorylation and internalization. CXCR4 mutants with truncation of phosphorylation sites in the C-terminal tail have been shown to exhibit increased signaling responses, indicative of loss of negative regulatory control mechanisms (19Haribabu B. Richardson R.M. Fisher I. Sozzani S. Peiper S.C. Horuk R. Ali H. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28726-28731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The finding that CXCR4-CAMs were constitutively phosphorylated provides additional evidence that the cytoplasmic aspect of these receptor variants mimics the active conformation induced by ligand binding, which is recognized by GPCR kinases. Whereas CXCR4 has been shown to be a substrate for protein kinase C (19Haribabu B. Richardson R.M. Fisher I. Sozzani S. Peiper S.C. Horuk R. Ali H. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28726-28731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), the unresponsive CXCR4(N119K) variant appeared to have decreased phosphorylation following ligand stimulation or exposure to phorbol ester. These findings support the interpretation that the architecture of the cytoplasmic aspect of the nonactivated receptor may be poorly recognized by GPCR kinases. The localization of CXCR4-CAMs to perinuclear structures suggests that these receptors are actively internalized in the absence of SDF-1 engagement, although the formal possibility that this distribution is due to disruption of intracellular trafficking cannot be fully excluded. However, CXCR4-CAMs were targeted to the cell surface at levels similar to that of the WT receptor, although a portion may be incompletely trafficked. A transient decrease in cytosolic free calcium levels occurred following exposure of CXCR4-CAM transfectants to T140, indicating a switch of the receptor to the inactive conformation.AMD3100, ALX40-4C, and T22/T140 have been reported to antagonize the activation of CXCR4 by SDF-1 and to block infection by X4 strains of HIV-1 in vitro (10Schols D.

Whereas AMD3100 and ALX40-4C stimulated the signaling of the CXCR4-CAM in yeast and mammalian systems, T140 inhibited the autonomous coupling to Gα subunits in both. The maximum response of CXCR4-WT induced by high concentrations of AMD3100 or ALX40-4C was less than observed with SDF-1; thus these agents are weak partial agonists. Because T140 functions as an inverse agonist, it is likely that it interacts with CXCR4 through a mechanism distinct from that employed by the partial agonists. The evidence that coreceptor signaling by gp120 plays a critical role in viral replication (38Arthos J. Rubbert A. Rabin R.L. Cicala C. Machado E. Wildt K. Hanbach M. Steenbeke T.D. Swofford R. Farber J.M. Fauci A.S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6418-6424Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) raises the possibility that the weak partial CXCR4 agonist activity of AMD3100 and ALX40-4C could influence the infection of target cells by R5 viruses or stimulate replication during latencyin vivo. This partial agonist activity would clearly preclude the use of these agents as antagonists of metastatic behavior in mammary carcinoma, because stimulation of CXCR4 on the surface of tumor cells could increase dissemination. Patients receiving AMD3100 experienced cardiac conduction abnormalities, either because of the weak partial agonist activity for CXCR4 or because of cross-reactivity with another GPCR. The ability of AMD3100 to stimulate mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells (16Liles W.C. Broxmeyer H.E. Rodger E. Hubel K. Cooper S. Hangoc G. Bridger G.J. Henson G.W. Calandra G. Dale D.C. Blood. 2001; 98 (abstr.): 737Google Scholar) mimics the effects of SDF-1. T140 was found to suppress this process in mice (39Petit I. Szyper K., M. Nagler A. Lahav M. Peled A. Liabler L. Ponomaryov T. Taichman R.S. Aranzana-Seisdedos F. Fujii N. Sandbank J. Gazitt Y. Zipori D. Lapidot T. Blood. 2001; 98 (Abstr. 3372): 811Crossref Scopus (210) Google Scholar), as expected for an inverse agonist. The ability to discriminate between the biologic properties of T140 and those of AMD3100 and ALX40-4C illustrates the utility of CAMs in the characterization of GPCR antagonists. This should provide a powerful approach to the development of a new generation of agents to block CXCR4 involvement in AIDS and the metastatic behavior of malignant tumors.

The importance of CXCR4 as a potential molecular target in HIV-1 infection and breast cancer provides a strong rationale for characterizing the mechanism of the action of CXCR4 antagonists and development of second generation antagonists with more favorable pharmacological properties. Here we have adopted a Saccharomyces cerevisiae expression system to couple CXCR4 signaling to growth in the absence of histidine (17Klein C. Paul J.I. Sauve K. Schmidt M.M. Arcangeli L. Ransom J.

The amino acid substitution that conferred this phenotype involved Asn-119, which is located in TM3, and further mutagenesis revealed substitutions that stabilized inactive or active receptor conformations in yeast and mammalian cells. Characterization of CXCR4 antagonists revealed that T140 is an inverse agonist and that AMD3100 and ALX40-4C are weak partial agonists. Whereas binding studies failed to reveal evidence of changes in extracellular domains in active or inactive variants, the decreased affinity of CAMs for AMD3100 and ALX40-4C signifies a conformational shift, most likely in the hydrophobic core of CXCR4. Variants with autonomous signaling were chronically phosphorylated and internalized. These findings illustrate the importance of TM3 conformation in the rearrangement in the hydrophobic core of CXCR4 that leads to Gα subunit activation and provide insight into the clinical effects of AMD3100. Utilization of GPCR CAMs in pharmaceutical screening provides an efficient and powerful approach for identification of novel antagonists. DISCUSSIONHere we demonstrate that Asn-119 plays a critical role in the mechanism of CXCR4 signaling through its regulation of TM3 conformation. Conversion of Asn-119 to Ser or Ala was found to drive the conformational equilibrium of CXCR4 to the active state, manifested by autonomous signaling. In contrast, substitution of Lys for Asn-119 induced a conformation of TM3 that favors the inactive state, rendering CXCR4 unresponsive to SDF-1 binding, rendering CXCR4 unresponsive to SDF-1 without affecting the binding.

https://openalex.org/W1978464139,"The causes of mass extinctions and the nature of biological selectivity at extinction events are central questions in palaeobiology. It has long been recognized, however, that the amount of sedimentary rock available for sampling may bias perceptions of biodiversity and estimates of taxonomic rates of evolution. This problem has been particularly noted with respect to the principal mass extinctions. Here we use a new compilation of the amount of exposed marine sedimentary rock to predict how the observed fossil record of extinction would appear if the time series of true extinction rates were in fact smooth. Many features of the highly variable record of apparent extinction rates within marine animals can be predicted on the basis of temporal variation in the amount of exposed rock. Although this result is consistent with the possibility that a common geological cause determines both true extinction rates and the amount of exposed rock, it also supports the hypothesis that much of the observed short-term volatility in extinction rates is an artefact of variability in the stratigraphic record."

Type III enzymes are structurally similar to PI 3-kinases and are sensitive to PI 3-kinase inhibitors.

Here we characterize a new member of this family, the type IIβ enzyme that has been identified in the NCBI data base based on its homology to the first-cloned type IIα enzyme. The type IIβ enzyme has a primary transcript size of ∼3.8 kb and shows wide tissue distribution. It contains an open reading frame of 1.4 kb, encoding a protein of ∼54 kDa. Sequence comparison reveals a high degree of similarity to the type IIα enzyme within the C-terminal catalytic domain but significantly lower homology within the N-terminal region. Expression of both enzyme yields increased PI 4-kinase activity that is associated with the microsomal membrane fractions and is significantly lower for the type IIβ than the type IIα form. Both enzymes use PI as their primary substrate and have no detectable activity on PI monophosphates.

Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar, 6Majerus P.W. Kisseleva M.V. Norris F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10669-10672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). This together with the recognition and characterization of several molecular motifs that interact with inositides to regulate a large number of signaling molecules has contributed to our changing perception of how inositides contribute to cellular signaling. In light of such localized functions, the importance of PI(4)P formation has to be reevaluated. It can now be safely assumed that PI(4)P serves not only as a synthetic intermediate in PI(4,5)P2 synthesis but also as a regulatory molecule on its own right. phosphatidylinositol phosphatidylinositol monophosphate PI 4-phosphate 5)P2, PI 4,5-bisphosphate PI 4-kinase early endosomal autoantigen enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) hemagglutinin phosphate-buffered saline PI 4-kinase (PI4K) enzyme activities have long been described in several tissues and have been classified as either type II or type III activities based on the catalytic properties of the enzyme (7Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 11147-11156Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 8Pike L.J. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 692-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 9Balla T. Biochim.

Balla T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3587-3594Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) predicted a similarity between the catalytic domains of the type III enzymes and the PI3K enzymes. This has been proven by cloning of the type III PI4Ks (9Balla T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 69-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 11Gehrmann T. Heilmayer L.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 357-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), of which two forms have been identified, a larger 200–220-kDa α-form and a smaller 110-kDa β-form, which are homologues of the yeast Stt4 and Pik1 proteins, respectively (9Balla T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 69-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Several elegant studies indicate that Pik1 and Stt4 serve non-redundant functions in yeast (12Flanagan C.A.

Cell. 2000; 11: 2673-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 17Pramanik A. Garcia E. Ospina R. Powell M. Martinez M. Alejo W. McCoy J. Moore C.W. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1997; 43: 1007-1018PubMed Google Scholar). Most recently, it has also been shown that the PI(4)P pool produced by Stt4 but not by Pik1 is dephosphorylated by the inositide phosphatase, Sac1, and this lipid pool determines vacuole morphology and is functionally linked to the actin cytoskeleton (18Foti M. Audhya A. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 128: 2396-2411Crossref Scopus (184) Google Scholar). These studies are consistent with the existence of multiple functional pools of PI(4)P and tight control of their synthesis and degradation by distinct kinases and phosphatases. In contrast to the significant progress in the field of type III PI4Ks, relatively little is known about the functions of the type II PI4Ks. Several biochemical studies demonstrate the presence of type II PI4K activity in a number of membrane compartments and organelles and indicate that the enzyme regulates PI(4)P synthesis related to several cellular processes, most notably to secretion (19Martin T.F.J. Loyet K.M. Barry V.A. Kowalchik J.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 1137-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, the molecular identities of the type II enzymes have been only recently revealed. The enzyme has been cloned based on purification of the protein from secretory granules (20Barylko B. Gerber S.H. Binns D.D. Grichine N. Khvotchev M. Sudhof T.C. Albanesi J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7705-7708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and from detergent-insoluble membrane fractions, also termed rafts (21Minogue S. Anderson J.S. Waugh M.G. dosSantos M. Corless S. Cramer R. Hsuan J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16635-16640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The latter study also indicates the existence of homologues of the cloned enzyme identified in the EST data base and is termed the cloned enzyme type IIα, indicating that it was the first member of a family of enzymes. In the present study, we have characterized the human type IIβ PI4K enzyme and compared its features to the human type IIα protein. We found significant differences in the tissue distribution and catalytic activities of the two proteins. We also demonstrate that both enzymes associate with the endosomal vesicular compartment in several cell types and is involved in the regulation of endosomal membrane traffic in mammalian cells. The EST clone from the I.M.A.G.E. Consortium (image.llnl.gov) (IMAGE clone ID 2905670, dbEST ID 5108611) encoding human PI4K type IIα was obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). The EST from Research Genetics (AL527283, dbEST ID 7860272) encoding human PI4K type IIβ was purchased from Invitrogen. The coding sequences of the two proteins were subcloned into the pcDNA3.1 plasmid for mammalian expression and in vitro translation or into the pEGFP-N1 plasmid to create the GFP-fused forms of the proteins. Epitope-tagged versions of the enzymes were created from the GFP fusion constructs by replacing the entire GFP sequence with the sequence coding for the HA epitope. To create a catalytically inactive enzyme, the conserved aspartate residue within the catalytic DRG sequence (Asp-308 in type IIα and Asp-304 in type IIβ) has been mutated to alanine by the QuikChange mutagenesis kit of Stratagene. To search for longer 5′ sequences, the type IIβ form was also amplified from Marathon Ready cDNA of human leukemia, K-562. Although longer forms have not been found, a shorter variant of the type IIβ enzyme has been isolated, and this was also subcloned into the pcDNA 3.1 and pEGFP-N1 plasmids. The TNT T7 Coupled Transcription/Translation System was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). [γ-32P]ATP (3000–6000 Ci/mmol) and [35S]methionine were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. ATP, adenosine, and wortmannin were obtained from Sigma. Phosphatidylinositol was purchased from Fluka (Ronkonkoma, NY), and phosphatidylinositol phosphates were from Echelon Research Laboratories (Salt Lake City, UT). The primary antibodies against early endosomal autoantigen (EEA1) and gm130 were obtained from BD Biosciences. The Alexa-595 and Alexa-488 secondary antibodies were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The monoclonal anti-HA antibody was purchased from Covance, and the polyclonal anti-HA antibody was from Alpha Diagnostics (San Antonio, TX). Human 12-lane multiple tissue and cancer cell line Northern blots (CLONTECH) containing poly(A)+-selected RNA were hybridized at 65 °C with the radiolabeled cDNA fragment using standard hybridization procedures (Amersham Biosciences). The 1.5-kbp EcoRI fragment containing the non-coding region of the type IIβ enzyme was used as a probe to detect the transcript for the type IIβ enzyme. For the type IIα enzyme, either a 500-bp PCR product coding for the unique N-terminal sequence or the full-length cDNA insert was used as a probe for hybridization. The cDNA fragments were labeled with the Prime-It RmT random primer labeling kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Membranes were washed twice for 15 min in 2× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 msodium citrate) with 0.1% SDS at room temperature followed by a 30-min wash in 0.1× SSC with 0.1% SDS at 60 °C. One microgram of supercoiled DNA plasmid was transcribed in vitro and then translated in the presence of [35S]methionine with the TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. For immunostaining, COS-7 cells were grown on coverslips and fixed in 2% formaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4, for 10 min at room temperature. After three washes with PBS (5 min each), fixed cells were incubated in blocking solution (10% FBS in PBS) for 10 min to decrease nonspecific binding of the antibodies. This blocking solution was complemented with 0.2% saponin for diluting the primary antibody (anti-EEA1 and anti-gm130, 1:250), and cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After 3 washes, cells were incubated in the same buffer with a fluorescent secondary antibody (1:1000) for 1 h at room temperature. After a final washing step (3 × 5 min with blocking solution), the cells were rinsed with PBS, air-dried, and mounted on glass slides using Aqua PolyMount mounting medium (Polysciences, Inc.). Cells were then analyzed by confocal microscopy using an inverted Zeiss LSM-410 confocal microscope. COS-7 cells cultured on 10-cm culture dishes were transfected with the respective HA-tagged PI 4-kinase constructs (or with GFP as control) for 48 h. Cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin), and the lysates were cleared by centrifugation (14,000 × g, 15 min). After pre-clearing with 100 μl (1:1 slurry) of protein G-agarose for 30 min, 10 μg of monoclonal anti-HA antibody (MMS 101R, from Berkeley Antibody Co.) was added to the lysates, and the samples were incubated on a rotating platform at 4 °C for 2 h. The antibody was then collected on protein G-agarose beads (50 μl), and the complex was washed 3 times with 1 ml of lysis buffer before a final wash in the PI kinase buffer. The enzyme was then analyzed by Western blotting, or its activity was assayed on the beads as described below. The activity of PI 4-kinase was measured as incorporation of radioactivity from [γ-32P]ATP into organic solvent-extractable material as described previously (22Nakanishi S. Catt K.J. Balla T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5317-5321Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The standard reaction mixture for PI 4-kinase (50-μl final volume) contained 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm PI, 0.4% Triton X-100, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (lipid kinase buffer), 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP, and the enzyme. All assay components except [γ-32P]ATP were preincubated with or without inhibitors for 10 min at room temperature. Reactions were started by the addition of [γ-32P]ATP and terminated after 10 min by the addition of 3 ml of CHCl3, CH3OH, 37% HCl (200:100:0.75 (v/v/v)). The organic solvent phase was separated from [γ-32P]ATP as described elsewhere (10Downing G.J. Kim S. Nakanishi S. Catt K.J. Balla T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3587-3594Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and after evaporation, its activity was determined in a liquid scintillation counter. The identity of the lipid product was assessed by TLC analysis and by further phosphorylation with a recombinant type I PIP 5-kinase (kindly provided by Drs. Jolanta Vidugiriene and Thomas F. Martin). The substrate specificity of the enzymes was measured with lipids spotted on nitrocellulose or SAM2® (Promega) membranes. 1–10 μg of lipid was spotted onto the membranes from a chloroform solution with or without phosphatidylserine. Dried membranes were incubated with the enzymes in the same buffer used for the kinase assays (except that it lacked PI, see above) in the presence of 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP in a wet chamber for 1 h. Reactions were stopped with 50 mm EDTA, and the membranes were washed 3 times with 2 m NaCl followed by 3 washes in 2 m NaCl, 1% phosphoric acid and finally rinsed twice with distilled water. Phosphorylation of the lipids on the membrane was assessed by phosphorimaging analysis (PhosphorImager, Molecular Dynamics). COS-7 cells were seeded on 12-well plates (50,000 cells/well) and cultured for 2 days before transfection with LipofectAMINE 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were washed with PBS and incubated in 400 μl of permeabilization medium containing 110 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA, 0.05% bovine serum albumin, 15 μg/ml digitonin, 0.3 mm ATP, 12.5 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP, and the various stimuli. Incubations were carried out at 37 °C for 10 min, and reactions were terminated with perchloric acid (5% final). Inositol lipids were extracted and separated by TLC as described previously (23Balla T. Baukal A.J. Guillemette G. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4083-4091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and their radioactivity was quantitated by phosphorimaging. A search of the data base for homologues of the recently published type II PI4K revealed a protein sequence with significant homology with the type II PI4K enzyme (NCBI: 8922869). The nucleotide sequence for this polypeptide (XM003573) contained an overlapping segment with another nucleotide entry in the GenBankTM (AK023186), providing a total transcript length of 3469 bp. An EST containing the full putative coding sequence (AL527283) was obtained, and its sequencing has confirmed the identity of the full cDNA sequence deduced from the two GenBankTM sequences. This long transcript contains an open reading frame of 1503 bp (Fig. 1 A). During our characterization of this sequence, Minogue et al. (21Minogue S. Anderson J.S. Waugh M.G. dosSantos M. Corless S. Cramer R. Hsuan J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16635-16640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) reported the cloning of type IIα PI4K and also identified another protein sequence in the data base that was termed type IIβ and which is identical to the protein characterized in the present report. Therefore, we refer to this protein as the type IIβ PI 4-kinase. Fig. 1 B shows the sequence homology between the type IIα and type IIβ enzymes. A high degree of identity and similarity is found throughout the amino acid sequence, with only the N-terminal regions more unique. Because the transcript does not contain an in-frame stop codon preceding the putative translation start-site that conforms to a Kozak sequence, we searched for possible sequences extending in the 5′ direction using Marathon-Ready cDNA from various human tissues and cells. These efforts did not find any longer 5′ sequence but repeatedly identified a shorter transcript that lacks 235 bp in the N-terminal coding sequence, yielding a 96-amino acid shorter, N-terminal-truncated variant protein. This shorter form, which we termed type IIβΔ, could be an alternatively spliced form, although the lack of typical splice donor and acceptor sequences around the variant sequence (which lies within the first exon) makes this questionable. Given the sequence repeat around the “spliced-out sequence” in the short variant, it is possible that this is not a natural product but an artifact generated during cDNA synthesis (Fig. 1 A). This question was not further pursued in the present study, but the short variant protein has proven to be useful to provide information about the role of the N-terminal sequence in the localization of the protein (see below). Northern analysis was performed on human tissue mRNA blots using probes based on the non-coding region of the type IIβ and either the unique N-terminal or the full sequence of the type IIα enzyme. As shown in Fig. 2, a primary transcript size of ∼3.8 kb was observed for both probes specific for the respective mRNAs and an additional weaker signal at ∼4.3 kb in the case of type IIβ enzyme. Both transcripts showed a relatively uniform distribution between the tissues represented on the blots with only a few notable differences. These were the prominent abundance of type IIβ but not type IIα mRNA in liver and the relatively low level of type IIβ mRNA in the brain and peripheral leukocytes. A weaker signal was repeatedly observed with two distinct probes specific for the type IIα enzyme sequence. Probes based on the N-terminal short splice variant sequence of type IIβΔ failed to produce a detectable signal (not shown). The coding sequences of the three proteins (type IIα, type IIβ, and type IIβΔ) were subcloned into the mammalian expression plasmid, pcDNA3.1. Proteins were first expressed in an in vitro translation reaction to reveal the sizes of the expressed proteins. As shown in Fig. 3 A, type IIα, type IIβ, and type IIβΔ were all efficiently translated to yield proteins consistent with their expected molecular sizes. Importantly, the size of the in vitro translated type IIβ was the same regardless of the presence or absence of the large 3′-untranslated region, confirming the correct identification of the stop codon based on the nucleotide sequence. When the enzymes were expressed in COS-7 cells, a large increase was observed in the PI4K activity of the cell lysates when cells expressed PI4K type IIα but only a moderate increase when the type IIβ protein was expressed (Fig. 3 B). For a comparison, the two forms of the wortmannin-sensitive type III PI 4-kinases were also expressed in these studies. Most of the overexpressed type II activity was found to be membrane-associated and was solubilized with Triton X-100, as typically found for type II PI 4-kinases (Fig. 3 B). However, some of the type II enzyme was also associated with the Triton-insoluble fraction and was also detectable in the 20,000 × g supernatant. In the latter fraction, however, most of the type II enzymes (unlike the type IIIβ form) was not cytosolic and was associated with the light membranes essentially as described in (20Barylko B. Gerber S.H. Binns D.D. Grichine N. Khvotchev M. Sudhof T.C. Albanesi J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7705-7708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 C). The effect of overexpression of the type II enzymes on the phosphorylation of endogenous PI was also examined in permeabilized COS-7 cells. Expression of the type IIα enzyme caused an average 2.5-fold increase in 32P-labeling of PI(4)P, whereas the type IIβ enzyme caused only about a 20% increase, consistent with its significantly lower PI 4-kinase activity compared with that of α-form (Fig. 4 B). Even the more active type IIα enzyme evoked only a moderate increase in the labeling of PI(4,5)P2. This effect was more pronounced in the presence of 10 μm wortmannin, when the endogenous type III PI 4-kinases were inhibited (Fig. 4 A).Figure 4Effect of overexpression of PI4K type IIβ and type IIα on phosphorylation of endogenous lipid substrate in permeabilized COS-7 cells. Cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids (pEGFP was used for control) for 24 h before analysis of [32P]phosphate incorporation into various phospholipids from [γ-32P]ATP after permeabilization with digitonin.Panel A shows the results of a representative TLC analysis, and panel B shows the summary of quantitative data from 4 similar experiments performed in duplicate. Wortmannin (10 μm) was added 10 min before permeabilization to inhibit endogenous type III PI 4-kinases.PIP2, phosphatidylinositol biphosphate;PA, phosphatidic acid.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate whether the different activities of the α- and β-forms of the type II enzymes could be caused by their different optimum assay conditions, we examined the detergent sensitivities of the two enzymes. These experiments showed an identical activation of both enzymes with Triton X-100 in the same concentration range (not shown). When HA epitope-tagged forms of the enzymes were expressed in COS-7 cells and their expression levels were analyzed by Western blot analysis, a significantly lower level of expression of the type IIβ form was observed (Fig. 5 A). Therefore, we performed immunoprecipitation and compared the activity of equal amounts of the two enzymes based on quantitation of the Western analysis. These measurements showed that the type IIβ enzyme was about 30% as active as the type IIα form (Fig. 5 B). The reaction products of both enzymes were run together with PI(4)P on TLC analysis and could be converted to PI(4,5)P2 by a recombinant type I PIP kinase, indicating that both enzymes are bona fide PI 4-kinases (Fig. 5 C). We also examined whether the type IIβ form can use alternative inositide substrates. However, neither enzyme could use any of the phosphorylated derivatives of PI as substrate in vitro under our experimental conditions (not shown). Comparison of the sensitivities of the two proteins to various inhibitors revealed their complete resistance to the PI 3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin (not shown), and a slightly higher sensitivity of the type IIβ enzyme to phenylarsine oxide but not to adenosine (Fig. 6). It is worth noting that both enzymes were significantly more resistant to phenylarsine oxide than either of the two type III PI4K enzymes, as already reported for the type IIα enzyme (20Barylko B. Gerber S.H. Binns D.D. Grichine N. Khvotchev M. Sudhof T.C. Albanesi J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7705-7708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). These data suggested that the lower PI 4-kinase activity of the β-form is not due to completely different catalytic properties or substrate specificity of the two enzymes. To investigate the intracellular distribution of the two isoforms of type II PI4Ks, GFP-tagged as well as epitope-tagged versions of the proteins were created by fusing the enhanced GFP protein (or the HA epitope) to the C termini of the enzymes. These constructs were expressed in COS-7 and HEK 293 cells to observe the distribution of the expressed proteins. The GFP-tagged enzymes were catalytically active, but their activities were only about 50% of their untagged counterparts (data not shown). The cellular distribution of the proteins in live COS-7 cells is shown in Fig. 7. Consistent with their tight membrane association, both type IIα and type IIβ forms were present in intracellular membranes, primarily in small vesicular structures scattered throughout the cytoplasm. Interestingly, the distribution and sizes of the vesicles positive for the type IIα enzyme were clearly dependent on the level of protein expression. Cells that expressed high levels of the protein contained larger vesicles that were concentrated mostly in the juxtanuclear compartment (Fig. 7,A–C). Higher expression levels of the type IIβ protein also caused the appearance of larger vesicles, but juxtanuclear accumulation of these enlarged vesicles was not as obvious as that of the type IIα enzyme (Fig. 7, D–F). Plasma membrane localization was less pronounced in the case of the type IIβ enzyme, and more of this protein was present in the cytoplasm (Fig. 7 D). The shorter, type IIβΔ enzyme, on the other hand, failed to show membrane localization and was mostly present in the cytoplasm (Fig 7, G–I). This result indicated that the N-terminal 96-amino acid sequence is necessary to target the protein to its specific membrane location. Immuno-cytochemical analysis of the epitope-tagged enzymes in fixed cells showed a distribution that was indistinguishable from that of the GFP-fused forms. Moreover, simultaneous detection of the GFP-tagged and epitope-tagged versions of the same expressed enzymes showed clear co-localization for both"
https://openalex.org/W2020163483,"To become insulin independent, patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus require transplantation of at least two donor pancreata because of massive beta-cell loss in the early post-transplantation period. Many studies describing the introduction of new immunosuppressive protocols have shown that this loss is due to not only immunological events but also nonimmunological factors. To test to what extent hypoxia may contribute to early graft loss, we analyzed the occurrence of apoptotic events and the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), a heterodimeric transcription factor consisting of an oxygen-dependent alpha subunit and a constitutive beta subunit. Histological analysis of human and rat islets revealed nuclear pyknosis as early as 6 h after hypoxic exposure (1% O2). Moreover, immunoreactivity to activated caspase-3 was observed in the core region of isolated human islets. Of note, both of these markers of apoptosis topographically overlap with HIF-1alpha immunoreactivity. HIF-1alpha mRNA was detected in islets from human and rat as well as in several murine beta-cell lines. When exposed to hypoxia, mouse insulinoma cells (MIN6) had an increased HIF-1alpha protein level, whereas its mRNA level did not alter. In conclusion, our data provide convincing evidence that reduced oxygenation is an important cause of beta-cell loss and suggest that HIF-1alpha protein level is an indicator for hypoxic regions undergoing apoptotic cell death. These observations suggest that gene expression under the control of HIF-1 represents a potential therapeutic tool for improving engraftment of transplanted islets."
https://openalex.org/W2004190331,"Cytokines macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) and the receptor activator of NFκB ligand (RANKL) induce differentiation of bone marrow hematopoietic precursor cells into bone-resorbing osteoclasts without the requirement for stromal cells of mesenchymal origin. We used this recently described mouse cell system and oligonucleotide microarrays representing about 9,400 different genes to analyze gene expression in hematopoietic cells undergoing differentiation to osteoclasts. The ability of microarrays to detect the genes of interest was validated by showing expression and expected regulation of several osteoclast marker genes. In total 750 known transcripts were up-regulated by ≥2-fold, and 91% of them at an early time in culture, suggesting that almost the whole differentiation program is defined already in pre-osteoclasts. As expected, M-CSF alone induced the receptor for RANKL (RANK), but also, unexpectedly, other RANK/NFκB pathway components (TRAF2A, PI3-kinase, MEKK3, RIPK1), providing a molecular explanation for the synergy of M-CSF and RANKL. Furthermore, interleukins, interferons, and their receptors (IL-1α, IL-18, IFN-β, IL-11Rα2, IL-6/11R gp130, IFNγR) were induced by M-CSF. Although interleukins are thought to regulate osteoclasts via modulation of M-CSF and RANKL expression in stromal cells, we showed that a mix of IL-1, IL-6, and IL-11 directly increased the activity of osteoclasts by 8.5-fold. RANKL induced about 70 novel target genes, including chemokines and growth factors (RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted), PDGFα, IGF1), histamine, and α1A-adrenergic receptors, and three waves of distinct receptors, transcription factors, and signaling molecules. In conclusion, M-CSF induced genes necessary for a direct response to RANKL and interleukins, while RANKL directed a three-stage differentiation program and induced genes for interaction with osteoblasts and immune and nerve cells. Thus, global gene expression suggests a more dynamic role of osteoclasts in bone physiology than previously anticipated.

Although interleukins are thought to regulate osteoclasts via modulation of M-CSF and RANKL expression in stromal cells, we showed that a mix of IL-1, IL-6, and IL-11 directly increased the activity of osteoclasts by 8.5-fold. RANKL induced about 70 novel target genes, including chemokines and growth factors (RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted), PDGFα, IGF1), histamine, and α1A-adrenergic receptors, and three waves of distinct receptors, transcription factors, and signaling molecules. In conclusion, M-CSF induced genes necessary for a direct response to RANKL and interleukins, while RANKL directed a three-stage differentiation program and induced genes for interaction with osteoblasts and immune and nerve cells. Thus, global gene expression suggests a more dynamic role of osteoclasts in bone physiology than previously anticipated. macrophage-colony stimulating factor glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase interferon interleukin phospholipase D receptor activator of NFκB receptor activator of NFκB ligand reverse transcription TATA box-binding protein tumor necrosis factor tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase platelet-derived growth factor insulin-like growth factor Bone is a dynamic tissue that is constantly remodeled, i.e. degraded and renewed. These two processes are accomplished by two main types of bone cells: bone-forming osteoblasts, of mesenchymal origin, and bone-resorbing osteoclasts, of hematopoietic origin (1Baron R. Favus M.J. Primer on the Metabolic Bone Diseases and Disorders of Mineral Metabolism. 4th Ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia1999: 3-10Google Scholar). Understanding the generation and activation of these two cell types will help to unravel many processes involved in bone metabolism and remodeling. This knowledge may be used to develop novel, better treatments for osteoporosis, a disease prevalent in old age and characterized by bone loss and high risk of fractures. Osteoclast generation (osteoclastogenesis) is a multi-step process that can be reproduced in vitro. The in vitroosteoclastogenesis systems used to comprise mixtures of stromal or osteoblastic cells together with osteoclast precursors from bone marrow (2Suda T. Jimi E. Nakamura I. Takahashi N. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 282: 223-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 3David J.P. Neff L. Chen Y. Rincon M. Horne W.C. Baron R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 1730-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In such systems, stromal/osteoblastic cells are usually stimulated by 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 to produce factors that support osteoclast formation. More recently, autonomous mouse osteoclastogenesis systems have been developed using bone marrow cells cultured with soluble forms of the cytokines M-CSF1(macrophage-colony stimulating factor) and a soluble form of RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand) (4Lacey D.L.

These two cytokines are now recognized as the major factors contributed by stromal cells/osteoblasts for support of osteoclastogenesis (reviewed in Ref. 6Takahashi N. Udagawa N. Suda T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Therefore, their addition to the culture medium overcomes the need for stromal cells. M-CSF, a homodimeric cytokine of the colony-stimulating factor family, is well known for its ability to stimulate proliferation and subsequent differentiation of cells of the macrophage/osteoclast lineage (Ref. 7Tanaka S.

The recently identified cytokine RANKL, also named ODF, OPGL, or TRANCE (4Lacey D.L. Timms E. Tan H.L. Kelley M.J. Dunstan C.R. Burgess T. Elliott R. Colombero A. Elliott G. Scully S. Hsu H.

A. 1998; 95: 3597-3602Crossref PubMed Scopus (3592) Google Scholar), is a member of the family of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-like transmembrane or soluble cytokines, which usually act as trimers. RANKL has been identified and characterized as a long sought after factor stimulating osteoclast development (10Khosla S. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 5050-5055Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). Expression of the receptor for M-CSF (c-Fms) is a crucial feature of an osteoclast precursor. The addition of M-CSF to osteoclast precursors induces the expression of the receptor for RANKL (RANK), which together with cell adherence allows differentiation to proceed (11Arai F. Miyamoto T. Ohneda O. Inada T. Sudo T. Brasel K. Miyata T. Anderson D.M. Suda T. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1741-1754Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 12Miyamoto T. Arai F. Ohneda O. Takagi K. Anderson D.M. Suda T. Blood. 2000; 96: 4335-4343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The main features of intracellular signaling by c-Fms and RANK have been elucidated: c-Fms is a transmembrane tyrosine-specific protein kinase receptor, whose intracellular signaling involves Src and mitogen-activated protein kinase Erk activation (13Insogna K.L. Sahni M. Grey A.B. Tanaka S. Horne W.C. Neff L. Mitnick M. Levy J.B. Baron R. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2476-2485Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 14Csar X.F. Wilson N.J. McMahon K.-A.

RANK is a member of the TNF receptor superfamily (15Li J. Sarosi I. Yan X.Q. Morony S. Capparelli C. Tan H.L. McCabe S. Elliott R. Scully S. Van G. Kaufman S. Juan S.C. Sun Y. Tarpley J. Martin L.

A. 2000; 97: 1566-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar), and, like other family members, signals to the activation of the transcription factors NFκB and, through the kinase Jnk, c-Jun (Ref. 16Jimi E. Akiyama S. Tsurukai T. Okahashi N. Kobayashi K. Udagawa N. Nishihara T. Takahashi N. Suda T. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 434-442PubMed Google Scholar and reviewed in Ref. 6Takahashi N. Udagawa N. Suda T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Thus, the present knowledge on signaling by M-CSF and RANKL does not distinguish them from the other family members. The question remained open on how these two cytokines can drive such a complex and a specific process, such as the formation of strongly adherent, large, multinucleated bone-resorbing cells from a non-adherent, heterogeneous population of small bone marrow cells. Therefore, to better understand the process of osteoclastogenesis at the molecular level, we have analyzed gene expression patterns induced by M-CSF and RANKL during mouse osteoclast differentiation, using oligonucleotide microarrays representing about 9,400 mouse genes. The patterns of gene induction and their identity provide a basis for further molecular examination of osteoclast formation. Cytokine-driven stromal cell-free mouse osteoclastogenesis was done as described by Shevdeet al. (5Shevde N.K. Bendixen A.C. Dienger K.M. Pike J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7829-7834Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Briefly, bone marrow was collected from about 20 5-week-old male mice (C57BL, MA612, TIF/SPF). The cells were plated on 10-cm tissue culture dishes at 2 × 108 cells/dish, in 20 ml of medium with 10% fetal calf serum, and incubated overnight. Next day, only non-adherent cells were collected, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (without Ca2+ and Mg2+), and purified by centrifugation over Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Biosciences). For TRAP staining and pit assays, isolated non-adherent bone marrow cells were plated on 48-well plates at 1 × 105 cells/well in 1 ml, without or with dentine slices, respectively. For RNA extraction, about 8 × 106 isolated non-adherent bone marrow cells were plated in a 10-cm dish. The following cytokines (all from R & D Systems, Abingdon, UK) were added: 10 ng/ml recombinant mouse M-CSF, 30 ng/ml recombinant mouse His-RANKL (catalog no. 462-TR) and 2.5 μg/ml anti-His antibodies (for RANKL cross-linking). The cultures were maintained typically for up to 11 days and re-fed twice weekly by medium semi-depletion. The absence of stromal cells in this culture system stems from the isolation of non-adherent cell population after 1-day incubation in medium with fetal calf serum, after which stromal cells are separated as an adherent population. Furthermore, no stromal cell layer is formed during culturing, and the system was not stimulated with the active form of vitamin D3, which acts via stromal cells (data not shown). RNA was extracted from the total population of unstimulated non-adherent cells (day 0) or from the adherent cell population after 1, 3, or 6 days of stimulation with the cytokines (day 1, 3, and 6). Both M-CSF alone and M-CSF plus RANKL induced adhesion of a subpopulation of non-adherent bone marrow cells already after 1 day of treatment. This allowed the selection of cells of monocyte-macrophage/osteoclast lineages. Practically no cells became adherent in medium containing 10% fetal calf serum without the cytokines. TRAP staining of adherent cultures was done with a kit from Sigma (Buchs, Switzerland) exactly according to manufacturer's instruction (procedure no. 386). The stained cells developed red color of different intensity. Pit assay with dentine slices was done as described previously (3David J.P. Neff L. Chen Y. Rincon M. Horne W.C. Baron R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 1730-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and pits were stained with toluidine blue. The cells were plated on the dentine slices from the beginning of the culture. Microphotography was done with the camera Nikon FM2 and film Kodak Gold Ultra 400. The microscope for cell culture photographs was Zeiss Axiovert 100 and for bone slices Leitz Laborlux S. The quantitative image analysis for the pit area was done with the Leica Qwin Image Processing and Analysis Software. Cells have been harvested in a guanidinium isothiocyanate-containing buffer and total RNA has been extracted, treated with DNase I, and purified according to the manufacturer's instructions (RNeasy mini kit, Qiagen). This PCR method was used to quantify the expression of marker genes prior to microarray analysis, as well as to confirm the regulation of some genes identified by microarray analysis. First strand complementary DNA was synthesized according to standard protocols. Briefly, for each sample, 10 units of RNase inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics) and 100 ng of random hexanucleotides (Amersham Biosciences) were added to 1 μg of DNase I-treated total cellular RNA. The samples were subjected to a denaturation step of 5 min at 65 °C, chilled on ice, and filled to 20 μl with a nuclease-free solution containing another 10 units of RNase inhibitor, 2.5 mm concentration of each dNTP, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 60 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mmdithiothreitol. The mixture was supplemented (cDNA) or not (RT−) with 20 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Stratagene). Subsequently, the samples were incubated for 2 h at 42 °C, then 5 min at 95 °C, diluted 5-fold with nuclease-free water, and stored at −80 °C until use. One μl of these diluted cDNA or RT(−) controls was subjected to PCR amplifications, carried out in a final volume of 25 μl. The PCR reaction mixture contained 100 μm concentration of each dNTP, 1 μCi of [α-32P]dATP, 1 μmconcentration of each primer, and 1.25 units of “hot start” thermostable DNA polymerase and corresponding reaction buffer (FastStart Taq, Roche Diagnostics). The amplification protocol consisted of an initial step of 5 min at 95 °C, 12–34 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 57/60 °C (all genes at 57 °C, except c-fms, at 60 °C) for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min 20 s. The amplification was terminated following a final incubation step at 72 °C for 10 min. Aliquots of PCR products, supplemented with a loading buffer (final concentrations: 5% glycerol, 10 mm EDTA, 0.01% SDS, 0.025% xylene cyanol and bromphenol blue dyes), were fractionated on 8% polyacrylamide gels. The gels were vacuum-dried, exposed to phosphor-storage screens (Molecular Dynamics), and imaged by a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The signals on images were quantified by the ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). The primers (forward and reverse, given in the 5′ to 3′ orientation) and the number of cycles used in PCR are listed below. For each gene, a cycle curve experiment was performed and the optimal number of PCR cycles was chosen according to its position in the middle of the linear range of amplification: c-fms gene, primers AGCTCTCAGTACTTCAGGGC (forward) and CAAAGGCACCGGCTCCTAGA (reverse), 25 cycles; receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK) gene, primers TTTGTGGAATTGGGTCAATGAT (forward) and ACCTCGCTGACCAGTGTGAA (reverse), 26 cycles; tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) gene, primers GACGATGGGCGCTGACTTCA (forward) and GCGCTTGGAGATCTTAGAGT (reverse), 26 cycles; cathepsin K (CathK) gene, primers ACGGAGGCATCGACTCTGAA (forward) and GATGCCAAGCTTGCGTCGAT (reverse), 28 cycles; calcitonin receptor (CalcR) gene, primers GACAACTGCTGGCTGAGTG (forward) and GAAGCAGTAGATAGTCGCCA (reverse), 34 cycles; c-src gene, primers CCAGGCTGAGGAGTGGTACT (forward) and CAGCTTGCGGATCTTGTAGT (reverse), 29 cycles; integrin β3 (ITGβ3) gene, primers ATTGAGTTCCCAGTCAGTGAG (forward) and GACAGGTCCATCAAGTAGTAG (reverse), 30 cycles; TATA box-binding protein (TBP) gene, primers AGTGAAGAACAATCCAGACTA (forward) and CCAGGAAATAATTCTGGCTCAT (reverse), 26 cycles; glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene, CTGCACCACCAACTGCTTAG (forward) and AGATCCACGACGGACACATT (reverse), 19 cycles; 18 S ribosomal subunit RNA (18S) gene, primers CCTGGATACCGCAGCTAGGA (forward) and GCGGCGCAATACGAATGCCCC (reverse), 12 cycles; histamine receptor H2 (H2R) gene, primers CTGCCATTTACCAGTTGTCC (forward) and CTTTGCACTTGAAGGTGTCAT (reverse), 34 cycles; circadian locomoter output cycles kaput (CLOCK) gene, primers ATCTGCTGGAAAGTGACTCAT (forward) and ATTTGGTTCTTCAACAGTACAC (reverse), 29 cycles; LIM domain cysteine rich protein 1 (CSRP) gene, primers GCAGGCACGCTGAGCACA (forward) and CATCGGAAGCAGGACTTATG (reverse), 31 cycles. The data described are derived from six independent primary culture preparations that contained various treatments or controls and were analyzed on 13 microarrays. Except for RNA from day 0 control, total RNA from each sample was extracted separately and analyzed by microarray individually. Due to low yields, the RNA from day 0 was a pool from three independent cultures. For treatment with M-CSF alone, samples were from two (day 1) or one determination (days 3 and 6). Treatment with M-CSF and RANKL comprised two (day 1) or three (days 3 and 6) determinations. The data are represented in several analysis groups (A–G) to show experimental variability, time course of gene changes, and different modes of data normalization (relative to day 0 or, for M-CSF plus RANKL, relative to time-matched treatment with M-CSF alone). We have assessed gene expression patterns of ∼9,400 genes during primary mouse osteoclasts differentiation (∼5,700 functionally characterized genes and ∼3,700 expressed sequence tag clusters) using microarrays consisting of coated glass slides on which series of oligonucleotide probes have been synthesized in situ(Affymetrix GeneChip® Murine Genome U74A arrays). Biotin-labeled cRNA probes were generated from each sample to be analyzed, starting from 5 μg of DNase I-treated total cellular RNA prepared as described above. The cRNA probes were individually hybridized on the arrays and the signals were detected according to the manufacturer's instructions (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The hybridization data were analyzed using the software provided by Affymetrix (MAS4.0) and the software Expressionist 3.0 (GeneData, Basel, Switzerland). Hierarchical and nonhierarchical (SOM, self-organizing maps) clustering of up-regulated genes was performed using the latter software, to group the genes, or sort genes in a given functional group, according to patterns of expression. Genes were considered as expressed, if they were classified as P (present) (and not M (marginal) or A (absent)) at least at one time point in a time course analysis group. The genes presented in detail were all detected with gene-specific probe sets and not with sets that could recognize gene families. Expression levels below 20 units were brought to 20, since discrimination below this value cannot be performed with confidence, and fold regulation factors (fold induction or repression) were clamped to 10-fold. Genes were selected as regulated by a given treatment if their expression deviated more than 2-fold from the corresponding control. This threshold reflected 2 S.E. (standard error of the mean) intervals around the mean relative levels of all 7545 (day 3) or 6895 (day 6) expressed genes in cells treated with M-CSF and RANKL (S.E. = 0.43 and 0.50, respectively, for day 3 and day 6, n = 3 for each). In addition to this statistical criterion, the biological data indicated that 2-fold was a meaningful difference, since osteoclast-specific genes (RANK, Mitf and Atp6i) were also induced to a similar degree (see the “Results” and Fig. 1). As several determinations were available, the criteria for gene selection were extended to include 2-fold regulation in both (day 1) or in two out of three experiments (days 3 and 6). When calculating average expression from several experiments, the median value was used preferentially, if the samples number allowed it (n = 3). For duplicate samples, the mean value was calculated. This technique was used to confirm the expression patterns of some genes identified by microarrays analysis. Briefly, 1 μl of cDNAs or RT(−), obtained as described in previous sections, served as a template in PCR reactions performed in a final volume of 50 μl. Specific primer pairs were designed for the genes of interest and for GAPDH, which was used as an internal control for normalization. The SyBr Green PCR Core Reagents system (PerkinElmer Applied Biosystems) was used for real-time monitoring of target sequence amplification by the ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System (PerkinElmer Applied Biosystems). The amplification program comprised an initial step of 10 min at 95 °C and up to 40 cycles consisting of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s and annealing/extension at 60 °C for 1 min. Negative controls were included in each PCR series, with RT(−) in place of a cDNA sample. The primers (forward and reverse, given in the 5′ to 3′ orientation) are listed: PDGF-α gene, CCACATCGGCCAACTTCC (forward) and ACAACAGCCAGTGCAGCG (reverse);ScyA5/RANTES gene, TCCAATCTTGCAGTCGTGTTTG (forward) and TTGAACCCA- CTTCTTCTCTGGGT (reverse). Isolated non-adherent mouse bone marrow mononuclear cells cultured in vitro in the presence of M-CSF and RANKL became adherent after 1 day and exhibited phenotypic features of osteoclasts after 3–11 days. The cells were adherent, positive for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining, often multinucleated, and they acquired a bone-resorbing activity in the pit assay (Fig. 1a). M-CSF alone induced formation of adherent, weakly TRAP-positive cells with no bone resorptive activity (Fig. 1a), while in the absence both factors, no adherent cells were detected after 1 to 8 days (data not shown). Further analysis included unstimulated non-adherent mononuclear cell population (day 0), and M-CSF alone or M-CSF plus RANKL-stimulated adherent cultures (days 1, 3, and 6). Within 3–6 days of culture with M-CSF and RANKL, messenger ribonucleic acids (mRNAs) for seven known osteoclast markers were up-regulated in the adherent cell population: c-fms, RANK(encoding receptors for M-CSF and RANKL), integrin β3 (ITGB3), calcitonin receptor (CalcR), TRAP, cathepsin K (CathK), and c-src(Fig. 1b). Although, as expected, M-CSF alone could not induce a full osteoclast phenotype, it could time-dependently induce three markers of the osteoclast lineage (c-fms, RANK, and ITGB3, Fig.1b). There was also a weak induction of TRAP and c-src, mainly at day 6 (Fig. 1b). RANKL was added in the presence of M-CSF, which is necessary to prime the responsiveness to RANKL by inducing its receptor RANK (reviewed in Ref.6Takahashi N. Udagawa N. Suda T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar; Fig. 1b). RANKL induced another four osteoclast markers (CalcR, TRAP, CathK, and c-src, Fig. 1b) above levels at day 1 and above time-matched M-CSF controls. The mRNA levels of housekeeping genes were similar in all conditions (Fig. 1b). We concluded that this mouse osteoclastogenesis system generates cells with cellular, functional and molecular features of osteoclasts. M-CSF and RANKL complement each other by inducing different sets of OC markers. To explore genome-wide gene expression patterns during mouse osteoclastogenesis, we extracted RNA at days 0, 1, 3, and 6 of thein vitro culture and analyzed them using oligonucleotide microarrays representing about 9,400 distinct mouse genes (Affymetrix GeneChip microarrays). The amounts of RNA required for microarray analysis and the yields that can be obtained from primary mouse osteoclastogenesis cultures are such that not all treatments can be done in each experiment. Therefore, we performed six primary cultures containing different combinations of treatments and analyzed them on 13 microarrays. This permitted the analysis of technical reliability, and of biological variability for the most important treatments, as treatments with M-CSF plus RANKL at days 3 and 6 were analyzed three times each from independent samples. Controls and day 1-treated groups were, respectively, from one and two replicates (details under “Experimental Procedures”). The data shown represent either all replicates (Figs. 2 and 4), the average of several experiments (Fig. 3, left panels), or a single experiment (Fig. 3, right panels).FIG. 4Expression profiles for genes preferentially induced by RANKL.

Metallothioneins, which are small, cysteine-rich, metal-binding proteins, play an important role in these processes. In addition, the transcription of their cognate genes is activated in response to metal exposure. The zinc finger transcription factor MTF-1 plays a central role in the metal-inducible transcriptional activation of metallothionein and other genes involved in metal homeostasis and cellular stress response. Here we report that the phosphorylation of MTF-1 plays a critical role in its activation by zinc and cadmium. Inhibitor studies indicate that multiple kinases and signal transduction cascades, including those mediated by protein kinase C, tyrosine kinase, and casein kinase II, are essential for zinc- and cadmium-inducible transcriptional activation. In addition, calcium signaling is also involved in regulating metal-activated transcription. In contrast, cAMP-dependent protein kinase may not be directly involved in the metal response. Contrary to what has been reported for other transcription factors, inhibition of transcriptional activation does not impair the binding of MTF-1 to DNA, suggesting that phosphorylation is not regulating DNA binding. Elevated phosphorylation of MTF-1 is observed under condition of protein kinase C inhibition, suggesting that specific dephosphorylation of this transcription factor contributes to its activation.

The precise physiological function of MT has not been fully elucidated. However, proposed roles include (a) participation in maintaining the homeostasis of essential transition metals; (b) sequestration of toxic metals, such as cadmium and mercury; and (c) protection against intracellular oxidative damage (1Hamer D.H.

MREs contain a 7-bp core sequence (TGCRCNC) and are present in multiple copies in the promoter/enhancer regions of almost all metal-inducible MTs (13Searle P.F. Stuart G.W. Palmiter R.D. Mol. Cell.

Inducible transcription is mediated by a variety of other regulatory elements located in promoter/enhancer regions of MT genes, which include glucocorticoid response elements, cAMP response elements, AP-1 elements, and antioxidant response elements (1Hamer D.H.

MTF-1 is an evolutionarily conserved protein that specifically binds to MREs and has been characterized in several species including human, mouse, pufferfish (Fugu rubripes), zebrafish (Danio rerio), trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), and Drosophila (17Radtke F.

MTF-1 contains six zinc finger domains and several trans-activation domains: acidic-rich, proline-rich, and serine/threonine-rich (17Radtke F. Heuchel R. Georgiev O. Hergersberg M. Gariglio M. Dembic Z. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1355-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Deletion analysis of MTF-1 suggests that interactions among all of the domains are required for metal-inducible transcription (23Radtke F. Georgiev O. Muller H.P. Brugnera E. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2277-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar).Two models have been proposed to describe how the interaction among MREs, MTF-1, and zinc activates MT transcription. The first proposes that MTF-1 acts as a zinc sensor that cannot bind to DNA in the absence of metal (18Heuchel R. Radtke F. Georgiev O. Stark G. Aguet M. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2870-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 24Bittel D.C. Smirnova I.V. Andrews G.K. J. Biol.

Agarwal A. Giedroc D.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11152-11161Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). As cells accumulate zinc, the metal binds in the finger domains, causing a conformational change in the protein and subsequent binding to the MRE. When MT levels are sufficient, it chelates the metal from the zinc fingers; now, MTF-1 can no longer bind to the MREs and transcription ceases.An alternative model hypothesizes the existence of a zinc-sensitive inhibitor, which complexes with MTF-1 rendering it inactive (28Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1219-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). As cellular zinc levels increase, the metal binds to the inhibitor releasing it from MTF-1, allowing the transcription factor to bind to the MRE to activate transcription. When MT levels are sufficient, the zinc is removed from the inhibitor, allowing it once again to bind to MTF-1 thereby inhibiting transcription.Typically, zinc is used as the inducer when the interactions among MREs, MTF-1, and MT transcription are investigated. There is a paucity of information regarding the molecular mechanism of MT transcriptional activation by other transition metals and environmental stressors. A combination of mutational and transcriptional analyses clearly show that cadmium activation of MT transcription is dependent on MTF-1 and MREs (18Heuchel R. Radtke F. Georgiev O. Stark G. Aguet M. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2870-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 29Datta P.K. Jacob S.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). MTF-1 binding to MREs and the activation of MT transcription is also induced by oxidative stress (25Andrews G.K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 30Dalton T.P., Li, Q. Bittel D. Liang L. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26233-26241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Although the current models can account for the regulation of MT transcription by zinc, they do not adequately explain the control of MTF-1 activity by non-zinc stressors.We propose a model in which the regulation of MT transcription, via the MTF-1/MRE interaction, is controlled by several signal transduction cascades that affect MTF-1 phosphorylation. It has been reported previously that the level of MTF-1 phosphorylation is modified following exposure to cadmium or zinc in vivo (31Adams T.K. Freedman J.H. Centeno J.A. Collery P. Vermet G. Finkelman R.B. Gibb H. Etienne J.-C. Metal Ions in Biology and Medicine. 6. John Libbey Eurotext, Montrouge, France2000: 694-697Google Scholar, 32LaRochelle O. Gagné V. Charron J. Soh J.-W. Séguin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41879-41888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of MTF-1 may be affected by one or more metal- or stress-responsive signal transduction pathways. This model is based on several observations. First, protein motif analysis (PROSITE) (33Hofmann K. Bucher P. Falquet L. Bairoch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar) of MTF-1 indicates the presence of several evolutionarily conserved, potential phosphorylation sites. As many as 11 PKC sites, 13 casein kinase II sites, and 1 tyrosine kinase site are predicted in the four characterized MTF-1s from different species. Second, exposure of cells to activators of signal transduction cascades causes an increase in the steady-state level of MT mRNAs (5Kelly E.J. Sandgren E.P. Brinster R.L. Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10045-10050Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 7Garrett S.H. Xiong X. Arizono K. Brady F.O. Int. J.

Simpkins C.O. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2000; 165: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Similarly, addition of signal transduction inhibitors attenuates or abolishes metal-inducible MT mRNA expression (35Yu C.W. Chen J.H. Lin L.Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Finally, many of the effectors that induce MT transcription, metals (zinc, cadmium, mercury, arsenic, chromium) as well as other environmental stressors (oxidative stress, radiation), modulate the activity of intracellular signal transduction cascades (36Beyersmann D. Hechtenberg S. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1997; 144: 247-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 37Stohs S.J. Bagchi D. Hassoun E. Bagchi M. J. Environ. Pathol. Toxicol. Oncol. 2000; 19: 201-213PubMed Google Scholar, 38Whisler R.L. Goyette M.A. Grants I.S. Newhouse Y.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 39Karin M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 851: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar).In this report, we show that MTF-1 is phosphorylated in vivo on serine and tyrosine residues, and that the level of phosphorylation is affected by metal exposure and kinase inhibitors. In addition, several signal transduction cascades have been identified that modulate cadmium- and zinc-inducible MTF-1/MRE-mediated activation of MT transcription.DISCUSSIONIt is well documented that metal-activated MT transcription is mediated primarily through the MRE-binding transcription factor MTF-1. Although this protein was discovered almost a decade ago, the mechanism by which metals activate transcription via MRE/MTF-1 interactions is still largely unresolved. Previous studies indicate that metal-inducible transcription requires several processes: nuclear translocation, DNA binding, and transcriptional activation. Here we report that activation of MT transcription via the MRE is dependent on interactions with several signal transduction pathways and a change in the level of MTF-1 phosphorylation.The initial examination of MTF-1 activity demonstrated that transcription depends on the binding of this factor to the MRE (17Radtke F. Heuchel R. Georgiev O. Hergersberg M. Gariglio M. Dembic Z. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1355-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The binding of MTF-1 to MREs requires the occupancy of zinc finger 1 with zinc (24Bittel D.C. Smirnova I.V. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37194-37201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These observations lead to the hypothesis that the biological activity of MTF-1 may be homologous to that of the yeast transcription factors ACE-1 and AMT-1, which function as copper sensors, binding metal to activate transcription (46Winge D.R. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 58: 165-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The sensor model of MTF-1, however, cannot explain the activation of MTF-1/MRE-mediated transcription by other metals or stressors. Occupancy of the zinc fingers by other transition metals even inhibits MTF-1-binding to DNA in vitro (47Bittel D. Dalton T. Samson S.L. Gedamu L. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7127-7133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Thus, zinc is required for the formation of zinc fingers and DNA binding. DNA binding, however, is not synonymous with transcriptional activation. This is supported by the observations that metal-inducible, MTF-1/MRE-mediated transcription is completely blocked with PKC and casein kinase II inhibitors (Figs. 2 and 3), but these agents do not inhibit MTF-1 binding to DNA (Fig. 6).Recent reports identified a second component in the activation of mammalian MT transcription: the metal- and stress-inducible translocation of MTF-1 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (42Saydam N. Georgiev O. Nakano M.Y. Greber U.F. Schaffner W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25487-25495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 48Smirnova I.V. Bittel D.C. Ravindra R. Jiang H. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9377-9384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Our studies demonstrate that, following metal exposure, the phosphorylated form of MTF-1 accumulates in the nucleus (Fig. 1). It is reasonable to hypothesize that modifications of specific residues could control nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation. It has been reported that, in response to IL-12 induction, STAT-4 is phosphorylated at both tyrosine and serine residues, which leads to its activation and nuclear translocation (49Athie M.V. Flotow H. Hilyard K.L. Cantrell D.A. Eur. J. Immun. 2000; 30: 1425-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The unique tyrosine kinase phosphorylation site in human MTF-1, Tyr140, is contiguous with the MTF-1 nuclear localization sequence 133KRKEVKR139(42Saydam N. Georgiev O. Nakano M.Y. Greber U.F. Schaffner W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25487-25495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of this residue may contribute to the regulation of MTF-1 nuclear transport. It should be noted that the location of the unique, putative tyrosine phosphorylation site that is contiguous with nuclear localization sequence is conserved in vertebrate MTF-1 proteins.The binding of MTF-1 to DNA is highly correlated with transcriptional activation; however, a mechanistic link has not been described. Results presented in this report and previous studies indicate that DNA binding can be disparate from transcriptional activation (32LaRochelle O. Gagné V. Charron J. Soh J.-W. Séguin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41879-41888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 42Saydam N. Georgiev O. Nakano M.Y. Greber U.F. Schaffner W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25487-25495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). It has been clearly demonstrated that, under conditions where MT transcription is inhibited, DNA binding still occurs. Furthermore, the binding of MTF-1 to MREs increases. This increase may be caused by a change in the affinity of MTF-1 for DNA following a change in the level of phosphorylation. It may also be the result of an increase in concentration of nuclear-MTF-1 caused by either a higher level of nuclear transport or de novo synthesis of MTF-1.The observations that (a) MTF-1 is phosphorylated, (b) its level of phosphorylation increases in response to metal exposure, and (c) several kinase inhibitors block or attenuate metal-inducible MT transcription support a model in which transcriptional activation via the MTF-1/MRE interaction is controlled by several signal transduction pathways that ultimately affect the level of MTF-1 phosphorylation. A codicil to this hypothesis is that the interaction among several signaling pathways may “fine-tune” the basal and inducible activity of MTF-1.In the presence of the PKC inhibitor H-7, the level of MTF-1 phosphorylation increases (Fig. 7). This is surprising at first glance, because H7, staurosporine, and BIM-I are potent inhibitors of metal-inducible MT transcription (Fig. 2). Although contradictory, these results are consistent with a model in which metal-activated transcription is controlled by a change in the phosphorylation pattern of MTF-1 that also involves dephosphorylation. A dephosphorylation activation mechanism is not without precedence. A similar mechanism is responsible for activating the binding of c-jun to the AP-1 promoter elements. The ability of c-Jun to bind DNA is a result of the activation of a phosphatase by PKC, which dephosphorylates residues adjacent to the DNA-binding domain, subsequently allowing AP-1 binding (50Boyle W.J. Smeal T. Defize L.H.K. Angel P. Woodgett J.R. Karin M. Hunter T. Cell. 1991; 64: 537-584Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (848) Google Scholar). Although c-Jun is dephosphorylated prior to DNA binding, it must remain phosphorylated at serine 63 and 73 to maintain proper function (51Kallunki T., Su, B. Tsigelny I. Sluss H.K. Derijard B. Moore G. Davis R. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2996-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 52Pulverer B.J. Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Nikolakaki E. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1991; 353: 670-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar). A similar requirement could explain why serine residues in MTF-1 remain phosphorylated in the presence of zinc and cadmium.In the dephosphorylation model, only transcriptional activation of MTF-1 is controlled by the removal of specific phosphorylated residues. The total level of MTF-1 phosphorylation may be greater following exposure to metals or stress, as shown in Fig. 1; however, specific residues are dephosphorylated to activate transcription. The dephosphorylation of MTF-1 is performed by a “MTF-1 phosphatase,” whose activity may be controlled by upstream regulatory proteins.The inhibitor studies indicate that metal-activated MT transcription via MTF-1/MRE interactions is controlled by signal transduction pathways that involve PKC, casein kinase II, tyrosine kinase, and calcium. The activation of the signal transduction pathways associated with these kinases by metals and other environmental stressors has been well documented (36Beyersmann D. Hechtenberg S. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1997; 144: 247-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 53Pfundt R. van Vlijmen-Willems I. Bergers M. Wingens M. Cloin W. Schalkwijk J. J.

Chem. 1656; 275: 16569-16573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The activity of casein kinase II is also affected by environmental stressors. In response to oxidative stress, casein kinase II translocates to the nucleus, and the enzymatic activity of the kinase increases (54Sayed M. Kim S.O. Salh B.S. Issinger O.G. Pelech S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1656; 275: 16569-16573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 55Gerber D.A. Souquere-Besse S. Puvion F. Dubois M.F. Bensaude O. Cochet C. J. Biol.

The stress-inducible increase in heme oxygenase-1 transcription is dependent, in part, on the activity of tyrosine kinase (56Masuya Y. Hioki K. Tokunaga R. Taketani S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 124: 628-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).The ability of PKC inhibitors and activators to affect the steady-state levels of MT mRNA, and the results presented in this report indicate that the MAP kinase signaling pathway directly regulates MT transcription, through MTF-1/MRE interactions. Transition metals and oxidative stress have been shown to modulate the activity of several members of the MAP kinase signaling cascade (57Stohs S.J. Bagchi D. Hassoun E. Bagchi M. J. Environ. Pathol. Toxicol. Oncol. 2001; 20: 77-88Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 58Ding W. Templeton D.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 718-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Recently, c-Jun N-terminal kinase has been shown to contribute to the regulation of metal-inducible MTF-1 transcriptional activation (32LaRochelle O. Gagné V. Charron J. Soh J.-W. Séguin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41879-41888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In addition, p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 are also involved in controlling metal-inducible transcription. 2J. H. Freedman and W. Schaffner, unpublished observation.The observation that multiple signal transduction pathways contribute to the ability of MTF-1 to regulate MT transcription provides an explanation to the observation that deletion of various regions in MTF-1 affects its ability to activate transcription. However, no single domain could be assigned as the “metal-activation” domain (23Radtke F. Georgiev O. Muller H.P. Brugnera E. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2277-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Because potential targets of the various signal transduction pathways are located throughout the protein, it is likely that changing the phosphorylation status of several of these residues would control metal-activated transcription.Exposure to metals, organic chemicals, physical stress (heat, cold, radiation), intracellular damage, and physiologic agents (hormones, second messengers) causes an increase the steady-state level of MT mRNA (6Durnam D.M.

The observation that multiple signal transduction pathways ultimately converge at MTF-1, to activate MT transcription, provides a mechanistic link between exposure to structurally unrelated stressors and the activation of MT transcription. Potentially any stressor that can activate an MTF-1-regulating signal transduction pathway could increase MT transcription. Furthermore, agents that activate parallel signal transduction pathways that converge with PKC, casein kinase II, and tyrosine kinase-regulated pathways will affect MT transcription.Although originally isolated as the transcription factor that controls MT expression, MTF-1 has been shown to be essential for normal liver development (64Gunes C.

Recently, several non-MT genes have been identified that contain MREs in their upstream regulatory region and the level of expression of which is affected by the loss of MTF-1 (65Lichtlen P. Wang Y. Belser T. Georgiev O. Certa U. Sack R. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1514-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Several of these genes have roles in mediating the stress response; however, for others, intracellular stress has not reported to affect their expression. These observations suggest that MTF-1 may be a more general transcription factor, and not limited to controlling stress response genes. The ability of several signal transduction pathways to affect MTF-1 activity may contribute to its activity in regulating liver development and non-stress response genes.A detailed"

As RAD51 is implicated in BRCA1- and BRCA2-mediated tumor suppression as well as cellular viability, we have begun a functional analysis of a defined RAD51 mutation in mammalian cells. By using a dominant negative approach, we generated a mouse embryonic stem cell line that expresses an ATP hydrolysis-defective RAD51 protein, hRAD51-K133R, at comparable levels to the endogenous wild-type RAD51 protein, whose expression is retained in these cells. We found that these cells have increased sensitivity to the DNA-damaging agents mitomycin C and ionizing radiation and also exhibit a decreased rate of spontaneous sister-chromatid exchange. By using a reporter for the repair of a single chromosomal double-strand break, we also found that expression of the hRAD51-K133R protein specifically inhibits homology-directed double-strand break repair. Furthermore, expression of a BRC repeat from BRCA2, a peptide inhibitor of an early step necessary for strand exchange, exacerbates the inhibition of homology-directed repair in the hRAD51-K133R expressing cell line. Thus, ATP hydrolysis by RAD51 has a key role in various types of DNA repair in mammalian cells.

Thus, ATP hydrolysis by RAD51 has a key role in various types of DNA repair in mammalian cells. The accurate repair of DNA damage, such as a chromosomal double-strand break (DSB), 1The abbreviations used are: DSBdouble-strand breakHDRhomology-directed repairNHEJnon-homologous end-joiningSSAsingle-stranded annealingMMSmethylmethane sulfonateMMCmitomycin CSCEsister-chromatid exchangeIRionizing radiationGFPgreen fluorescent proteinPBSphosphate-buffered salineESembryonic stemGygrey is essential to prevent chromosomal alterations and the loss of genetic information. DSBs can be formed by oxygen free radicals, topoisomerase failure, radiation treatment, and possibly most commonly, DNA replication. Repair of DSBs in mammalian cells, as in other organisms (1Pâques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), occurs by multiple pathways (2Liang F. Han M. Romanienko P.J. Jasin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5172-5177Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 3Jasin M. Nickoloff J.A. Hoekstra M.F. DNA Damage and Repair. 3. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2001: 207-235Google Scholar). One pathway of DSB repair involves homologous recombination in which a homologous sequence templates repair by gene conversion after strand invasion of a broken end, and thus can be termed homology-directed repair (HDR). The sister chromatid is by far the preferred template for HDR in mammalian cells (4Johnson R.D. Jasin M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 196-201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two other pathways for repair are non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), which results in deletions or insertions at a DSB, and single-stranded annealing (SSA), which involves the annealing of complementary strands at or near the DSB site. Various components of DSB repair pathways are known to be essential for cellular viability, embryonic development, and tumor suppression in mammalian cells (5Pierce A.J. Stark J. Araujo F.D. Moynahan M.E. Berwick M. Jasin M. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: S52-S59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Therefore, characterizing the roles of such components in mammalian cells is essential for an understanding of how cells maintain genomic integrity. double-strand break homology-directed repair non-homologous end-joining single-stranded annealing methylmethane sulfonate mitomycin C sister-chromatid exchange ionizing radiation green fluorescent protein phosphate-buffered saline embryonic stem grey Insight into mechanisms of HDR has come in large part from analysis of genes of the RAD52 epistasis group in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which includes genes important for meiotic and mitotic recombination and cellular resistance to DNA-damaging agents such as methylmethane sulfonate (MMS) and x-rays (1Pâques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and for which mammalian homologues have been identified (6Thompson L.H. Schild D.

One of these genes,RAD51 (8Morita T. Yoshimura Y. Yamamoto A. Murata K. Mori M. Yamamoto H. Matsushiro A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6577-6580Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 9Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Matsuda Y. Ushio N. Ikeo K. Ogawa T. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 239-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), encodes the homologue of the RecA protein which is pivotal for homologous recombination in Escherichia coli (10Kowalczykowski S.C. Dixon D.A. Eggleston A.K. Lauder S.D. Rehrauer W.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 401-465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Cox M.M. Prog Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 63: 311-366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Like RecA, RAD51 forms helical nucleoprotein filaments on DNA in an ATP-dependent manner (12Yu X. Jacobs S.A. West S.C. Ogawa T. Egelman E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8419-8424Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 13Benson F.E. Stasiak A. West S.C.

These filaments catalyze DNA strand exchange, an early step in homologous recombination pathways (15Baumann P. West S.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 247-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Although RecA in E. coli and its counterpart Rad51 in S. cerevisiae are dispensable for viability of these organisms, disruption of the RAD51 gene in vertebrate cells leads to increased numbers of chromosome aberrations in the absence of DNA-damaging agents, including chromosome breaks, and cellular and embryonic lethality (16Sonoda E. Sasaki M.S. Buerstedde J.M. Bezzubova O. Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Takata M. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Takeda S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 598-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar, 17Lim D.-S. Hasty P. Mol.

Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6236-6240Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). These phenotypes imply that RAD51 plays an important role in the repair of spontaneously arising DNA damage in vertebrate cells. As strand breaks can arise during DNA replication, vertebrate RAD51 may catalyze strand exchange-mediated replication fork restart, as has been proposed for RecA in E. coli (19Robu M.E. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8211-8218Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 20Cox M.M. Goodman M.F. Kreuzer K.N. Sherratt D.J. Sandler S.J. Marians K.J. Nature. 2000; 404: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). Besides being essential for cell viability, RAD51 has also been implicated in the tumor suppression functions of BRCA1 and BRCA2 (21Scully R. Livingston D.M. Nature. 2000; 408: 429-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). RAD51 binds directly to regions of the BRCA2 protein and, together with BRCA1, interacts in nuclear foci. Importantly, cell lines containing mutations in Brca1 or Brca2 are defective in HDR (22Moynahan M.E. Cui T.Y. Jasin M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4842-4850PubMed Google Scholar, 23Moynahan M.E.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4704-4716Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). However, mammalian cell lines carrying defined mutations within Rad51 have not as yet been examined for recombination phenotypes. To begin to understand the role of RAD51 in mammalian cells, we sought to characterize the DNA repair functions of the mammalian RAD51 protein. In this report, we have examined two mutants of human RAD51, hRAD51-K133A and hRAD51-K133R, that are defective for ATP binding and ATP hydrolysis, respectively (26Morrison C. Shinohara A. Sonoda E. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Takata M. Weichselbaum R.R. Takeda S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6891-6897Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Overexpression of hRAD51-K133R, but not hRAD51-K133A, has been shown previously (26Morrison C. Shinohara A. Sonoda E. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Takata M. Weichselbaum R.R. Takeda S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6891-6897Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) to complement a RAD51 null allele in hyper-recombinagenic chicken DT40 cells, with the only reported phenotype being a decreased frequency of gene targeting. By using a dominant negative approach, we generated mouse ES cell lines that express hRAD51-K133R at comparable levels to endogenous RAD51, whose expression is retained in these cells, although we have not obtained cell lines that similarly express the hRAD51-K133A protein. We found that cells expressing hRAD51-K133R exhibit hypersensitivity both to the cross-linking agent mitomycin C (MMC) and to ionizing radiation (IR), a decrease in spontaneous sister-chromatid exchange (SCE), and a defect in HDR of an induced chromosomal DSB. Moreover, expression of a peptide inhibitor of RAD51 nucleoprotein filament formation, derived from BRCA2, exacerbates the HDR defect in this line. These results indicate that ATP hydrolysis by mammalian RAD51 has a key role during homologous recombination and DNA repair. Generation of the E14-DRGFP cell line in which the DR-GFP reporter was targeted to the hprt locus has been described previously (27Pierce A.J., Hu, P. Han M. Ellis N. Jasin M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3237-3242Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 28Pierce A.J. Johnson R.D. Thompson L.H. Jasin M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2633-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). To generate cell lines expressing hRAD51-WT, hRAD51-K133R, and hRAD51-K133A, cDNAs for these human RAD51 genes (26Morrison C. Shinohara A. Sonoda E. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Takata M. Weichselbaum R.R. Takeda S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6891-6897Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) were cut with BamHI and SalI and cloned into a modified form of pCAGGS (29Miyazaki J. Takaki S. Araki K. Tashiro F. Tominaga A. Takatsu K. Yamamura K. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 79: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), pCAGGS-BSKX-H3/Not, which expresses cDNAs from a human cytomegalovirus enhancer/chicken β-actin promoter. The vector pCAGGS-BSKX-H3/Not contains a polylinker (BglII-SmaI-KpnI-XhoI) inserted between the XhoI and BglII sites of pCAGGS, such that the orientation of the BglII and XhoI sites is reversed, compared with pCAGGS, and a NotI linker inserted into the Hin dIII site just downstream. Expression cassettes were inserted as SalI/NotI fragments into the Pim1 locus gene-targeting vector p59.N/RV at unique SalI/NotI sites, which are downstream of the hygromycin resistance gene coding sequence fused to Pim1 exon 4 (30te Riele H. Maandag E.R. Clarke A. Hooper M. Berns A. Nature. 1990; 348: 649-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The p59.N/RV vector is a version of p59 that has a NotI linker inserted at the unique SmaI site just downstream of the SalI site and also contains EcoRV sites on both ends of the genomic fragment, allowing for linearization of the targeting vector with EcoRV. Each of these linearized vectors (70 μg) was electroporated into E14-DRGFP cells (5 × 106 ES cells suspended in 650 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) in a 0.4-cm cuvette) by pulsing the cells at 800 V, 3 microfarads. Hygromycin selection was applied 48 h later at 110 μg/ml. After 10 days, surviving colonies were isolated and analyzed for targeting to Pim1 as described previously (30te Riele H. Maandag E.R. Clarke A. Hooper M. Berns A. Nature. 1990; 348: 649-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). To construct the BRC3 expression vector, the coding sequence for amino acids 1415–1483 of BRCA2 was PCR-amplified from a human BRCA2 cDNA using primers flanking this sequence. The PCR primers generated a stop codon at the 3′ end and restriction endonuclease sites at both ends of the PCR product (EcoRI and BbsI sites at the 5′ end; BglII site at the 3′ end). A PCR product for mBRC3 was created the same way, except that the 5′ primer contained the Phe1428–Lys1434 deletion mutation (31Davies A.A. Masson J.Y. McIlwraith M.J. Stasiak A.Z. Stasiak A. Venkitaraman A.R. West S.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 273-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). PCR products were digested with EcoRI and BglII and cloned into these sites of the pCAGGS expression vector. Subsequently, an EcoRI/BbsI fragment encoding a start methionine followed by three copies of a nuclear localization signal (32Rouet P. Smih F. Jasin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6064-6068Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar) was cloned in-frame, upstream of the BRC repeats. The BRC3 and mBRC3 sequences containing the nuclear localization signal were verified by the Sloan-Kettering Institute Core Facility. To measure the repair of an I-SceI-generated DSB, 50 μg of the I-SceI expression vector pCBASce (33Richardson C. Moynahan M.E. Jasin M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3831-3842Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) was mixed with 5 × 106ES cells suspended in 650 μl of PBS in a 0.4-cm cuvette, followed by pulsing the cells at 250 V, 950 microfarads. In experiments with the BRC repeat, 70 μg of the BRC3 or mBRC3 expression vectors were additionally added. To determine the amount of HDR, the percentage of cells that were GFP-positive was quantitated by flow cytometric analysis 7 days after electroporation on a Becton Dickinson FACScan, as described previously (28Pierce A.J. Johnson R.D. Thompson L.H. Jasin M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2633-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). To determine the percentage I-SceI site loss for each electroporation (27Pierce A.J., Hu, P. Han M. Ellis N. Jasin M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3237-3242Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), genomic DNA was isolated 7 days after transfection. 2 μg of genomic DNA was used as the template for PCR with primers at 200 nm in a reaction volume of 50 μl. The primer sequences were DRGFP1 5′ AGGGCGGGGTTCGGCTTCTGG and DRGFP2 5′ CCTTCGGGCATGGCGGACTTGA. PCRs were performed using the Roche Molecular Biochemicals GC-rich PCR System in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences GeneAmp PCR System 9600. Amplification was for a total of 35 cycles, the first 10 cycles using a 1-min elongation time and the final 25 cycles using a 2-min elongation time. Following amplification, PCR products were purified using an Amersham Biosciences GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit. PCR products were digested with I-SceI for 20 h with 10 units of I-SceI (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and separated on a 1.5% agarose gel. The gel was stained with ethidium bromide, and the ethidium signals for the I-SceI-resistant and I-SceI-cleaved band were quantified using a Bio-Rad Chemidoc 2000 system with rolling disc background subtraction. Cells (5 × 106) suspended in 100 μl of PBS and mixed with an equal volume of protein extraction buffer (34Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar) were heated at 100 °C for 10 min and subsequently spun for 10 min. 5 μl of this protein extract was separated on two 12% SDS-PAGE gels; one was stained with Coomassie Blue to confirm equal loading, and the other was transferred to Polyscreen polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The membrane was probed with anti-RAD51 IgG goat antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated mouse anti-goat secondary antibodies (Pierce), and immunoblot signals were detected using ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). MMC and IR survival assays were performed as described previously (22Moynahan M.E. Cui T.Y. Jasin M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4842-4850PubMed Google Scholar, 35Essers J. Hendriks R.W. Swagemakers S.M. Troelstra C. de Wit J. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H. Kanaar R. Cell. 1997; 89: 195-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). For MMC treatment, 2 × 105 cells for each line were exposed to various doses of MMC for 4 h and washed three times with PBS. Cells were trypsinized, counted, and then plated at various concentrations for 7–10 days of cell growth. For IR treatment, 2 × 105 cells, in solution, were exposed to various doses of IR by varying the duration of exposure to a 137Cs source. Cells were diluted and plated at various concentrations for 7–10 days of cell growth. For both the MMC and IR experiments, clonogenic survival was determined for a given concentration of cells that were plated by dividing the number of colonies on each treated plate by the number of colonies on each untreated plate. Subconfluent ES cells cultured on 100-mm plates were incubated with bromodeoxyuridine (Sigma) at 10 μm for 48 h. Colcemid (Invitrogen) was then added at a final concentration of 0.15 μg/ml for 1 h after which time cells were harvested for metaphase preparation. Slides were aged for 3 days and stained with 10−4m 33258 Hoechst (Sigma) for 10 min. After washing in water, slides were mounted and then placed under a 120-watt Plant Lite (General Electric, Inc.) at a distance of 10 cm for 2 h. Slides were then washed and stained in 2% Giemsa (LabChem, Inc.) in Gurr's buffer (Bio/Medical Specialties, Inc.) for 15 min and then washed again and examined under an Olympus microscope mounted with a Sony CCD camera. Metaphases that showed no more than 5 undifferentially stained chromosomes were selected for counting SCEs. Statistical analysis was performed using the Student's two-tailed t test. To begin to identify the activities of mammalian RAD51 that are involved in DNA repair, we attempted to generate cell lines that express mutant forms of the protein. Considering that mutant RAD51 may not be able to support cellular viability in the absence of the wild-type protein, we took a dominant negative approach, expressing mutant forms of the protein exogenously, while maintaining expression of the endogenous wild-type protein. In this manner, we could take advantage of homotypic interactions of RAD51, such that mutant forms of the protein would have the potential to form mixed nucleoprotein filaments with the endogenous protein and thereby interfere with the function of the wild-type RAD51 without completely abolishing its activity (36Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Ogawa T. Cell. 1992; 69: 457-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar, 37Donovan J.W. Milne G.T. Weaver D.T.

Biol. 1996; 16: 4782-4789Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In these experiments, we attempted to generate mouse cell lines that exogenously express two mutant forms of human RAD51, which is 99% identical to mouse RAD51 (9Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Matsuda Y. Ushio N. Ikeo K. Ogawa T. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 239-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar): hRAD51-K133A, which is defective for ATP binding, and hRAD51-K133R which is competent for ATP binding but is defective for ATP hydrolysis (26Morrison C. Shinohara A. Sonoda E. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Takata M. Weichselbaum R.R. Takeda S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6891-6897Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In parallel, we developed cell lines that exogenously express hRAD51-WT for comparison. To generate these cell lines, we gene-targeted the RAD51 expression cassettes to a specific chromosomal locus in the wild-type mouse ES cell line E14-DRGFP (parental), which contains a substrate for the quantification of HDR of a chromosomal DSB (27Pierce A.J., Hu, P. Han M. Ellis N. Jasin M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3237-3242Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 28Pierce A.J. Johnson R.D. Thompson L.H. Jasin M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2633-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). To this end, each RAD51 expression cassette was cloned into a Pim1 genomic fragment containing a linked promoterless hygromycin gene (Fig. 1A), which allows efficient selection of gene-targeted clones (30te Riele H. Maandag E.R. Clarke A. Hooper M. Berns A. Nature. 1990; 348: 649-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 33Richardson C. Moynahan M.E. Jasin M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3831-3842Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The RAD51-targeting vectors, hRAD51-WT, hRAD51-K133R, and hRAD51-K133A, were introduced into the parental cell line by electroporation, and stably integrated clones were selected using hygromycin. In these experiments, the frequency of hygromycin-resistant clones was ∼8-fold higher for the hRAD51-WT vector (2 × 10−6) than for the hRAD51-K133R vector (1.5 × 10−7), whereas no clones were found with the hRAD51-K133A vector (<1 × 10−8). The inability to generate viable clones with the hRAD51-K133A expression vector is consistent with similar findings in chicken DT40 cells (26Morrison C. Shinohara A. Sonoda E. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Takata M. Weichselbaum R.R. Takeda S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6891-6897Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and suggests that its expression is lethal. Subsequently, these hygromycin-resistant clones were analyzed by Southern blotting to identify clones that had correctly integrated the vector at the Pim1 locus. From this analysis, 6 of the 8 clones derived from the hRAD51-WT vector and 7 of 13 clones derived from the hRAD51-K133R vector were found to have undergone targeted integration (Fig. 1B, data not shown). These targeted clones were used for subsequent experiments to analyze the effects of wild-type and mutant RAD51 expression. Initially, multiple independently targeted clones were examined and found to behave similarly in the assays described below, such that one clone each for hRAD51-WT and hRAD51-K133R was chosen for detailed analysis. We refer to these cell lines as hRAD51-WT or hRAD51-K133R expressing cell lines, to indicate that they are exogenously expressing these RAD51 proteins in conjunction with the endogenous wild-type protein. Expression of RAD51 protein in the targeted clones was analyzed by Western blotting of total protein using an antibody that recognizes both human and mouse RAD51. Targeted clones from both the hRAD51-WT and hRAD51-K133R expression vectors exhibit elevated levels of total RAD51 compared with the parental line, by ∼4- and 2-fold, respectively (Fig. 1C). The 2-fold increase in total RAD51 in the hRAD51-K133R expressing ES cell line compared with the parental line suggests that the mutant protein accounts for approximately half of the RAD51 in these cells. It is unclear what accounts for the somewhat higher amount of RAD51 in the hRAD51-WT expressing line relative to the hRAD51-K133R expressing line, although it is possible, for example, that the wild-type protein is somewhat more stable than the mutant protein. In summary, therefore, viable cell lines were generated that exogenously express moderate levels of both the hRAD51-WT and hRAD51-K133R proteins, together with the endogenous wild-type protein, whereas no viable cell lines were identified that express the hRAD51-K133A protein. Because moderate expression of the hRAD51-K133R protein, in otherwise wild-type cells, is not lethal, we could examine the impact of RAD51 with impaired ATP hydrolysis on the repair of different DNA lesions. As a first step, we compared the effects of the DNA-damaging agents MMC and IR on the relative viability of the parental and RAD51 expressing lines. We tested these agents because vertebrate cell lines deficient for homologous recombination have been found to be extremely hypersensitive to MMC, which produces interstrand cross-links, while having relatively less hypersensitivity to IR, which produces strand breaks and other types of lesions (22Moynahan M.E. Cui T.Y. Jasin M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4842-4850PubMed Google Scholar, 39Liu N. Lamerdin J.E. Tebbs R.S. Schild D. Tucker J.D. Shen M.R. Brookman K.W. Siciliano M.J. Walter C.A. Fan W. Narayana L.S.

To test whether mammalian cells expressing hRAD51-K133R are hypersensitive to these agents, the parental cell line and the hRAD51-WT- and hRAD51-K133R expressing lines were tested for clonogenic survival following brief exposure to varying concentrations of MMC or doses of IR. In both cases, clonogenic survival of untreated cells was established as 100% survival for each cell line. In the MMC experiments, the survival of the parental line and hRAD51-WT expressing line was not compromised by exposure to 0.1 μmMMC, whereas the hRAD51-K133R expressing line showed a mild sensitivity at this concentration (52% survival) (Fig. 2A). At a higher concentration of 0.6 μm MMC, the parental line and the hRAD51-WT expressing line exhibited mild sensitivity (46 and 38% survival, respectively), whereas the hRAD51-K133R expressing line showed a marked sensitivity at this concentration (10.5% survival). In the IR experiments, the survival of the parental line was not compromised by exposure to 2 Gy, whereas the hRAD51-K133R expressing line showed a mild sensitivity at this dose (53% survival) (Fig. 2B). Exposure of cells to 4 Gy resulted in mild sensitivity of the parental line and hRAD51-WT expressing line (35 and 40% survival, respectively), whereas the hRAD51-K133R expressing line showed a marked sensitivity at this dose (10% survival) (Fig. 2B). In addition, a Rad54−/− mouse ES cell line was included in these experiments to compare the IR sensitivity of the hRAD51-K133R expressing ES cell line (35Essers J. Hendriks R.W. Swagemakers S.M. Troelstra C. de Wit J. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H. Kanaar R. Cell. 1997; 89: 195-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these two cell lines showed similar degrees of sensitivity at these and higher doses (Fig. 2B). Thus, cells expressing the hRAD51-K133R protein at levels similar to the endogenous wild-type protein exhibit an increased sensitivity to both MMC and IR and thus are defective for the repair of some types of DNA damage. Although damage induced by MMC or IR may be repaired by homologous recombination, sensitivity to these agents does not provide a direct measure of recombination. To begin to analyze the efficiency of homologous recombination in the hRAD51-K133R expressing cell line, we investigated the spontaneous rate of SCE, an apparent indicator of homologous recombination (41Sonoda E. Sasaki M.S. Morrison C. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Takata M. Takeda S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5166-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), in this line and the parental line. Spontaneous SCEs were visualized cytologically in metaphase spreads following differential labeling of newly replicated chromatids with 5-bromodeoxyuridine. By using this method, the number of spontaneous SCEs per metaphase, normalized to the total number of chromosomes observed in each metaphase, was determined for metaphases from the two cell lines. In these experiments, the hRAD51-K133R expressing cell line exhibited a lower average number of SCEs per metaphase (5.25 ± 2.2) than the parental line (8.6 ± 4.3). There was also a statistically significant difference (p < 0.001) between the two cell lines in the distribution of SCEs per metaphase (Fig. 3). For example, the percentage of metaphases with 10 or more SCEs was 2.4% for the hRAD51-K133R expressing cell line compared with 35% for the parental line. Thus, expression of the hRAD51-K133R protein in otherwise wild-type cells leads to a red"
https://openalex.org/W2123603132,"Phytanic acid, a metabolite of the chlorophyll molecule, is part of the human diet and is present in normal human serum at low micromolar concentrations. It was previously shown to be a ligand of the 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) a. PPAR agonists are widely used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Here, we report that phytanic acid is not only a transactivator of PPARa, but it also acts via PPARb and PPARg in CV-1 cells that have been cotransfected with the respective full-length receptor and an acyl-CoA oxidase-PPAR-responsive element-luciferase construct. We observed that, in contrast to other fatty acids, phytanic acid at physiological concentrations enhances uptake of 2-deoxy-D-glucose in rat primary hepatocytes. This result could be explained by the increase in mRNA expression of glucose transporters-1 and -2 and glucokinase, as determined by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Compared with the PPARg-specific agonist ciglitazone, phytanic acid exerts only minor effects on the differentiation of C3H10T1/2 cells into mature adipocytes. These results clearly demonstrate that phytanic acid acts via different PPAR isoforms to modulate expression of genes involved in glucose metabolism, thus suggesting a potential role of phytanic acid in the management of insulin resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2151841735,"The homeostatic regulation that controls total thymocyte and peripheral T-cell numbers is not clearly understood. We describe here a direct hormonal influence of endogenous levels of glucocorticoids (GCs) on thymocyte and peripheral T-cell homeostasis independent of indirect systemic effects of GCs. The results were obtained by generating transgenic mice with an altered GC sensitivity targeted to thymocytes and peripheral T cells by increasing or decreasing glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression specifically in thymocytes and peripheral T cells. A twofold increase in GC sensitivity resulted in a major decrease in thymocyte number, affecting all subpopulations, although single-positive CD8+ cells were less influenced. In the thymus, this was due to increased apoptosis in the organ, whereas proliferation of thymocyte populations was unaffected. In the periphery, a pronounced reduction in T-cell number was seen, demonstrating an effect of endogenous GCs also on T-cell homeostasis. The effects were confirmed in transgenic mice with reduced GR expression, which showed increased thymocyte and T-cell numbers. Thus, our data demonstrate that physiological GC levels are directly involved in controlling the size of both thymocyte and T-cell pools."
https://openalex.org/W2150922369,"Vascular endothelial cell growth inhibitor (VEGI), a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family, is an endothelial cell-specific inhibitor of angiogenesis. Overexpression by cancer cells of a secretable VEGI fusion protein resulted in abrogation of xenograft tumor progression, but overexpression of full-length VEGI was completely without effect. This finding indicates that secretion is essential for VEGI action. Here we report the identification of two new VEGI isoforms consisting of 251 and 192 amino acid residues. Both isoforms show endothelial cell-specific expression and share a C-terminal 151-residue segment with the previously described VEGI, which comprises 174 residues. The isoforms are generated from a 17 kb human gene by alternative splicing. Their expression is regulated in parallel by inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and interferon-gamma. VEGI-251, the most abundant isoform, contains a putative secretion signal. VEGI protein is detected in conditioned media of endothelial cells and VEGI-251-transfected mammalian cells. Overexpression of VEGI-251 in endothelial cells causes dose-dependent cell death. VEGI-251-transfected cancer cells form xenograft tumors of reduced growth rate and microvessel density compared with tumors of empty vector transfectants. These findings support the view that endothelial cell-secreted VEGI may function as an autocrine inhibitor of angiogenesis and a naturally existing modulator of vascular homeostasis."

Thus, modulation of cell adhesion potentially affects diverse aspects of cell behavior. One adhesion modulatory signal comes from a family of extracellular matrix proteins, termed matricellular proteins, which primarily stimulate anti-adhesive signals.

However, a feature of these matricellular proteins is that they reduce cellular adhesiveness to a state of intermediate cell adhesion (3Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 785-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). This entails disassembly of focal adhesions, characterized by unbundling of actin stress fibers and selective depletion of certain focal adhesion proteins, including vinculin and α-actinin (3Murphy-Ullrich J.E.

However, in the intermediate adhesive state, integrins remain clustered and cell spreading is not appreciably altered (3Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 785-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). The functional significance of this adhesive state has yet to be defined, but it is reasonable to suggest that cells in this state have altered tensional forces. Current data suggest that focal adhesion disassembly can modulate the migratory capacity of the cell, affect cellular apoptosis, and induce alterations in gene expression (3Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 785-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Despite the potential physiologic implications of cellular de-adhesion, very little is currently known about the cell surface receptors and intracellular signaling pathways that propagate focal adhesion disassembly in response to the matricellular proteins. thrombospondin assay dilution buffer extracellular signal-regulated kinase pertussis toxin G protein-coupled receptor calreticulin mouse embryonic fibroblasts bovine aortic endothelial integrin-associated protein phosphoinositide 3-kinase endoplasmic reticulum c-Jun N-terminal kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase epidermal growth factor Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium fetal bovine serum myelin basic protein 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid polyvinylidene difluoride horseradish peroxidase smooth muscle cell phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate interference reflection microscopy low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein thrombospondin assay dilution buffer extracellular signal-regulated kinase pertussis toxin G protein-coupled receptor calreticulin mouse embryonic fibroblasts bovine aortic endothelial integrin-associated protein phosphoinositide 3-kinase endoplasmic reticulum c-Jun N-terminal kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase epidermal growth factor Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium fetal bovine serum myelin basic protein 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid polyvinylidene difluoride horseradish peroxidase smooth muscle cell phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate interference reflection microscopy low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein Thrombospondin (TSP) is a large (180 kDa), homotrimeric, multidomain extracellular matrix glycoprotein. TSP binds several receptors on the cell surface, including heparan sulfate proteoglycans, calreticulin (CRT), CD36, integrin-associated protein (IAP), as well as the α3β1 and αvβ3 integrins, making TSP's role in physiology and pathophysiology complex (7Bornstein P.

The sequence in TSP responsible for inducing focal adhesion disassembly has been mapped to a 19-amino acid sequence in the N-terminal heparin-binding domain of TSP, termed the hep I sequence, because it lies within the first heparin-binding sequence of this domain (9Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Gurusiddappa S. Frazier W.A. Höök M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26784-26789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Early work on the signaling of TSP-mediated focal adhesion disassembly illustrated that basal levels of PKG were required for this process (10Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Pallero M.A. Boerth N. Greenwood J.A.

More recent work showed that TSP and hep I induce focal adhesion disassembly by binding to cell surface CRT and activating PI3K (11Greenwood J.A. Pallero M.A. Theibert A.B. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J.

Although best known as an ER resident chaperone protein, CRT localizes to other cellular compartments, such as the cytosol and on the cell surface (13Michalak M. Corbett E.F. Mesaeli N. Nakamura K.

In addition to TSP, cell surface CRT propagates cellular responses to fibrinogen and glycosylated laminin, suggesting this surface form of CRT has a functional role as a cell surface receptor (14Gray A.J.

Although CRT is not a transmembrane protein, there is evidence that cell surface CRT engages intracellular signaling pathways. Cho et al. (16Cho J.-H. Homma K. Kanegasaki S. Natori S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 878-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar,17Cho J.-H. Homma K.J. Kanegasaki S. Natori S. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2001; 6: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) reported that cell surface CRT transmits the effects of an anti-microbial peptide on neutrophils and monocytes. The effects of this anti-microbial peptide are sensitive to pertussis toxin (PTX), a selective inhibitor of the Gi subclass of heterotrimeric G proteins, suggesting that CRT may act in conjunction with a G protein-coupled receptor to propagate intracellular signals. Pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins are logical targets for the TSP-mediated focal adhesion disassembly response through CRT, because PTX-sensitive G proteins have previously been shown to stimulate focal adhesion and stress fiber disassembly in response to urokinase-type plasminogen activator and fibroblast-derived motility factor (18Degryse B. Resnati M. Rabbani S.A. Villa A. Fazioli F. Blasi F. Blood. 1999; 94: 649-662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Sugiura T. Shirasuna K. Hayashido Y. Sakai T. Matsuya T. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 68: 774-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Two of the most common pathways stimulated downstream of PTX-sensitive G proteins are the PI3K and ERK signaling pathways (20Pierce K.L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1532-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 21Sotsios Y. Ward S.G. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 177: 217-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Although PI3K is known to play a role in regulating cell adhesion by TSP, little is known about ERK's role in TSP signaling. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 comprise the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family of proteins (22Pearson G. Robinson F. Beers Gibson T. Xu B.E. Karandikar M. Berman K. Cobb M.H. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 153-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (3528) Google Scholar). ERK is activated by diverse stimuli and has been implicated in a wide range of cellular functions, including proliferation, migration, and survival (23Tibbles L.A. Woodgett J.R. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1230-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Although the role of adhesion in regulation of the ERK pathway has been widely studied, little is known concerning the effect of ERK signaling on adhesion itself. Signaling through the ERK pathway stimulates a decrease in integrin affinity, suggesting a negative feedback loop on cell adhesion (24Hughes P.E. Renshaw M.W. Pfaff M. Forsyth J. Keivens V.M. Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1997; 88: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). In addition, ERK has been shown to play a role in EGF-mediated focal adhesion disassembly, as well as focal adhesion disassembly induced by oncogenic Ras (25Xie H. Pallero M.A. Gupta K. Chang P.

In these current studies, we characterize the role of PTX-sensitive G proteins and the ERK pathway in TSP-mediated focal adhesion disassembly. We show that TSP induces Gi-dependent PI3K and ERK activation, both of which are required for TSP-mediated focal adhesion disassembly. Furthermore, these data report, for the first time, the ability of cell surface CRT to mediate ERK activation.

Growth conditions were the same as described for BAE cells. Focal adhesion assays were performed as previously described (6Reuveni H. Geiger T. Geiger B. Levitzki A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1179-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, BAE and MEF cells were grown overnight on glass coverslips in DMEM with 10% FBS. After overnight incubation, cells were ∼70% to 80% confluent. Cells were then washed once with serum-free DMEM and incubated in serum-free DMEM for 30 min. Cells were then treated with either DMEM, hep I (1 μm), or TSP (10 μg/ml = 78 nmmonomer), fixed with 3% glutaraldehyde, and examined using a Zeiss Axiovert 10 equipped for interference reflection microscopy. Cells were scored as either positive or negative for the presence of focal adhesions, with cells containing at least five focal adhesions considered positive. At least 300 cells were evaluated for each condition. To prepare whole cell lysates from BAE and MEF cells grown in six-well plates, medium was removed from cells and 100 μl of SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% w/v SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% w/v bromphenol blue) was added to each well. Following lysis is SDS sample buffer, lysates were harvested with cell scrapers and collected in Eppendorf tubes. Lysates were sonicated for 15 s to shear DNA and lower viscosity. Lysates were then boiled, centrifuged, and frozen at −20 °C until gel electrophoresis was performed. Medium was removed, and 1 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin) was added. Cells were scrapped, collected in Eppendorf tubes, and pre-cleared by centrifugation. Supernatants were incubated with PY20 (10 μg/ml) antibodies for 2 h on ice. Protein A-Sepharose was added for 1 h at 4 °C with shaking. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and twice in kinase buffer (10 mmHEPES, pH 7.2, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.8 mm Na3VO4, and 30 mmNaCl). Lipids were prepared by adding 400 μl of kinase buffer with 3.5 mm dithiothreitol to a pre-dried equal mixture of PIP2 and phosphatidylserine, to achieve a final 1.5 μm concentration of each lipid. Kinase buffer was removed from immunoprecipitates, and 20 μl of lipids was added to each tube and incubated for exactly 10 min at 37 °C. Next, 20 μl of reaction buffer (kinase buffer containing 17.5 μm ATP, 25 μCi of [32P]ATP/sample, and 17.5 mmMgCl2) was added to each tube and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 160 μl of a 1:1 methanol/chloroform solution. Lipids were extracted by adding 80 μl of HCl to each tube and centrifuging to separate the phases. The lower phase was removed and lipids were separated by TLC on Silica Gel 60 plates pre-coated with 1% potassium oxalate. The plates were developed in chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (40:15:13:12:7), exposed for autoradiography, and quantified using Scanalytic's One-Dscan version 1.31. BAE cells were grown to near confluence and treated with hep I (1 μm) for various time points. Cells were then harvested by addition of lysis buffer (with 25 mm NaF and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Anti-MAPK 1/2 antibodies were preincubated with Protein A-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C and washed three times with lysis buffer prior to use. Cell lysates were incubated with the anti-MAPK conjugated beads for 2 h and washed three times with lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitates were then washed two times with assay dilution buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Buffer was removed, and immunoprecipitates were sequentially given 10 μl of inhibitor mixture (20 μm protein kinase C inhibitor peptide, 2 μm protein kinase A inhibitor peptide, 20 μm compound R24571 in ADB), 10 μl of substrate mixture (2 mg/ml dephosphorylated myelin basic protein (MBP) in ADB), and 10 μl of magnesium/ATP mixture (500 μm ATP and 75 mm MgCl2 in ADB). Tubes were vortexed, and reaction was allowed to proceed for 20 min at 30 °C with agitation. Reaction was stopped by addition of 8 μl of 6× sample buffer. Samples were analyzed for phosphorylated MBP by immunoblotting. Samples were separated by gel electrophoresis using 12% SDS-PAGE gels for ERK and 15% SDS-PAGE gels for MBP and transferred to PVDF membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat milk and immunoblotted with either 1:1000 anti-ERK antibodies, 1:1000 anti-phospho-ERK antibodies, or 1:1000 anti-phospho-MBP antibodies overnight. HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was used at a 1:5000 dilution for 1 h. Bands were visualized by incubating antibody-labeled membranes with PerkinElmer Life Sciences chemiluminescence reagent and exposing for autoradiography. Bands were quantified using Scanalytic's One-Dscan version 1.31, and phospho-ERK levels were normalized to levels of total ERK protein. Statistical analysis was performed using unpaired Student's t test, and p < 0.05 or p < 0.01 (indicated) was considered significant. We previously characterized a role for cell surface CRT in TSP/hep I-mediated focal adhesion disassembly and PI3K activation, suggesting that CRT is acting as a receptor for the hep I sequence of TSP (12Goicoechea S. Orr A.W. Pallero M.A. Eggleton P. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36358-36368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). However, CRT is not a transmembrane protein and most likely associates with a transmembrane protein to generate an intracellular signal. Because cell surface CRT has been shown to signal through a G protein-dependent mechanism in neutrophils and monocytes (16Cho J.-H. Homma K. Kanegasaki S. Natori S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 878-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 17Cho J.-H. Homma K.J. Kanegasaki S. Natori S. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2001; 6: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), we sought to determine what role heterotrimeric G proteins might play in TSP-induced focal adhesion disassembly. Pertussis toxin catalyzes the ADP-ribosylation and inactivation of the Gi/o subclass of heterotrimeric G proteins (29McKenzie F.R. Kelly E.C. Unson C.G. Spiegel A.M. Milligan G. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To determine if pertussis-toxin sensitive G proteins are involved in TSP/hep I-mediated focal adhesion disassembly, we observed the effect of pertussis toxin (25 ng/ml for 12 h) pretreatment on TSP and hep I-mediated focal adhesion disassembly. Pretreatment of BAE cells with pertussis toxin blocked the ability of both TSP and hep I to stimulate a decrease in the percentage of focal adhesion-positive cells as measured by IRM (Fig. 1A). Pertussis toxin did not affect the basal level of focal adhesion-positive cells. The active sequence (TNfnIIIA-D) of tenascin-C (27Aukhil I. Joshi P. Yan Y. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2542-2553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), another matricellular protein, retained the ability to induce focal adhesion disassembly in the pertussis toxin-treated cells (Fig. 1B), suggesting the effect of pertussis toxin is specific for TSP. In addition, pertussis toxin inactivated by boiling did not inhibit TSP/hep I-mediated focal adhesion disassembly (data not shown). Cholera toxin, which activates the Gs subclass of heterotrimeric G proteins, had no affect on focal adhesion disassembly in response to hep I, suggesting that TSP signals focal adhesion disassembly specifically through the Gi/o subclass of heterotrimeric G proteins (data not shown). Since activation of PI3K by TSP/hep I was shown to be essential for focal adhesion disassembly (11Greenwood J.A. Pallero M.A. Theibert A.B. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1755-1763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), we also sought to determine whether pertussis toxin could inhibit the ability of TSP/hep I to activate PI3K. BAE cells were serum-deprived in the presence or absence of 25 ng/ml PTX for 12 h, stimulated with hep I, TSP, or a modified hep I peptide, and the resulting PI3K activity was assessed. Although pertussis toxin slightly raised the basal level of PI3K activity, pertussis toxin treatment significantly inhibited the ability of both TSP and hep I to stimulate PI3K activation (Fig. 2). A modified form of the hep I peptide, with the essential lysines at positions 24 and 32 converted to alanine residues, did not stimulate PI3K activation under either condition. Pertussis toxin does not generally affect PI3K activity, because insulin stimulated PI3K activation was not inhibited by pertussis toxin (data not shown). These data provide evidence for the involvement of heterotrimeric G proteins in TSP/hep I-mediated focal adhesion disassembly. BAE cells contain only two known pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins, Gαi2 and Gαi3 (30Jo H. Sipos K., Go, Y.-M. Law R. Rong J. McDonald J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1395-1401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). To further characterize the involvement of these proteins in TSP and hep I-mediated focal adhesion disassembly, we employed a membrane-permeable peptide approach to specifically block signaling through Gαi2, Gαi3, and their associated Gβγ subunits. The C-terminal 10 amino acids from the Gα subunits have previously been demonstrated to specifically block the G protein-receptor interaction (31Taylor J.M. Neubig R.R. Cell. Signal. 1994; 6: 841-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thus, the C-terminal 10 amino acids from Gαi2 and Gαi3 were produced coupled to the membrane-permeable sequence from Kaposi fibroblast growth factor. This approach has proven successful in blocking G protein signaling, delivering the inhibitory peptides into every cell type tested to date (32Chang M. Zhang L. Tam J.P. Sanders-Bush E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7021-7029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 33Chang, M. S. S., Tam, J. P., and Sanders-Bush, E. (2000)Science's STKE, www.stke.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2000/47/p11Google Scholar). In addition, a Gβγ-sequestering 28-amino acid peptide from the C terminus of phosducin-like protein, a known Gβγ signaling inhibitor, was also produced and coupled to the membrane-permeable sequence (32Chang M. Zhang L. Tam J.P. Sanders-Bush E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7021-7029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 33Chang, M. S. S., Tam, J. P., and Sanders-Bush, E. (2000)Science's STKE, www.stke.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2000/47/p11Google Scholar). BAE cells were incubated for 1 h with the various peptides (1 μm), treated with DMEM or hep I for 30 min, and the percentage of focal adhesion-positive cells was assessed by interference reflection microscopy. Pretreatment with both the Gαi2 and the Gβγ inhibitory peptides was able to inhibit hep I-mediated focal adhesion disassembly (Fig. 3). Interestingly, the Gαi3inhibitory peptide was not able to block this effect, although its functional sequence differs from that of the Gαi2inhibitory peptide in only 2 of the 10 amino acids. The membrane-permeable sequence alone had no effect on hep I-induced focal adhesion disassembly, suggesting that the effect is specific for the G protein-inhibitory sequence. Pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins have been shown to stimulate activation of the ERK signaling pathway in response to a variety of agonists (20Pierce K.L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J.

Because CheW can bind to CheA and to Tar, it is thought to serve as an adapter protein in this complex. The functional importance of CheW binding interactions, however, has not been investigated. To better define the role of CheW and its binding interactions, we performed biochemical characterization of six mutant variants of CheW. We examined the ability of the purified mutant CheW proteins to bind to CheA and Tar, to promote formation of active ternary complexes, and to support chemotaxis in vivo. Our results indicate that mutations which eliminate CheW binding to Tar (V36M) or to CheA (G57D) result in a complete inability to form active ternary complexes in vitro and render the CheW protein incapable of mediating chemotaxis in vivo. The in vivo signaling pathway can, however, tolerate moderate changes in CheW-Tar and CheW-CheA affinities observed with several of the mutants (G133E, G41D, and 154ocr).

In this system, a well defined signal transduction pathway mediates communication between cell-surface receptor proteins and the flagellar motors, and this control allows the cell to migrate up gradients of chemoattractants or down gradients of chemorepellents.

Phosphorylated CheA, in turn, directs activation of CheY by donating its phosphoryl group to it, and phospho-CheY then diffuses to the flagellar motors where it promotes clockwise flagellar rotation, an event that causes the cell to change its swimming direction (11Hess J.F.

Binding of a chemoattractant molecule to the periplasmic domain of an MCP results in decreased CheA autokinase activity, reducing the intracellular pool of phospho-CheY and the probability of a change in swimming direction (7Borkovich K.A.

Phospho-CheA also directs activation of CheB, a methylesterase, in a similar manner; phospho-CheB removes methyl ester groups from the MCPs, a modification that contributes to sensory adaptation in the chemotaxis system (6Hess J.F.

Understanding how the MCPs regulate the autokinase activity of CheA is, therefore, central to understanding the mechanisms of signal transduction and sensory adaptation in this system. The magnitude of this regulation is impressive; the autokinase activity of MCP-coupled stimulated CheA is ∼100-fold higher than that of uncoupled CheA and ∼500-fold higher than that of MCP-coupled inhibited CheA (7Borkovich K.A.

MCP-mediated regulation of CheA activity (in response to binding of attractants/repellents to the MCPs) is thought to occur within this complex (7Borkovich K.A. Kaplan N. Hess J.F. Simon M.I. Proc.

Parkinson J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8703-8707Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Considerable progress has been made toward defining the composition and activities of the complex(es) formed by mixtures of CheW, CheA, and MCPs. Formation of a ternary complex was first demonstrated by thein vitro binding experiments of Gegner et al.(24Gegner J.A. Graham D.R. Roth A.F. Dahlquist F.W. Cell. 1992; 70: 975-982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), and subsequent electron microscopy studies supported the existence of such complexes in intact cells (25Maddock J.R. Shapiro L. Science. 1993; 259: 1717-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 28Lybarger S.R. Maddock J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5527-5529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Initial in vitro experiments indicated a stoichiometry of 2:2:2 for the MCP·CheW·CheA complex (i.e. one receptor dimer and two CheW molecules bound per CheA dimer) and suggested that this complex was stable, forming and dissociating over a time course of many minutes (20Surette M.G. Stock J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17966-17973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 24Gegner J.A. Graham D.R. Roth A.F. Dahlquist F.W. Cell. 1992; 70: 975-982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). However, more recent experiments indicate that several distinct ternary complexes are possible, including a 14:3:2 complex with very high CheA autokinase activity and a 2:2:2 complex in which the autokinase activity is very low (21Liu Y. Levit M. Lurz R. Surette M.G. Stock J.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7231-7240Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 22Levit M.N. Liu Y. Stock J.B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6651-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent experiments suggest that the active ternary complex might be a dynamic assembly, forming and dissociating on a time scale comparable with that required for signal propagation by the chemotaxis signaling pathway (21Liu Y. Levit M. Lurz R. Surette M.G. Stock J.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7231-7240Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 22Levit M.N. Liu Y. Stock J.B.

CheW might play a role in defining these dynamics, as suggested by the observation that addition of “extra CheW” to preformed ternary complexes causes rapid disassembly of the 14:3:2 complex (21Liu Y. Levit M. Lurz R. Surette M.G. Stock J.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7231-7240Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 22Levit M.N. Liu Y. Stock J.B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6651-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The results presented above give rise to numerous questions about the role of CheW in chemotaxis signal transduction. How does it promote ternary complex formation? How does it mediate regulation of CheA within the ternary complex(es)? However, the detailed biochemical role of CheW remains obscure, in large part because it is one of the least studied components of the chemotaxis system. To date, only one survey of cheW mutants has been published (30Liu J. Parkinson J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4941-4951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the only defined biochemical activities of CheW are its abilities to bind to MCPs and CheA. Analysis of genetic suppressors by Liu and Parkinson (30Liu J. Parkinson J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4941-4951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) established the in vivo importance of CheW-MCP interactions, and subsequent work by Gegner et al. (24Gegner J.A. Graham D.R. Roth A.F. Dahlquist F.W. Cell. 1992; 70: 975-982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) demonstrated the existence of a CheW·MCP complex of moderate affinity (K d ∼10 μm). In vivoevidence of CheW·CheA complexes came from immunoprecipitation studies by McNally and Matsumura (8McNally D. Matsumura P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6269-6273Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and subsequent work demonstrated binding of purified preparations of CheW to CheA with a K d of 15 ± 2 μm and a binding stoichiometry of 1:1 (31Gegner J.A. Dahlquist F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 750-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The binding activities of CheW have led to the idea that CheW serves as an adapter protein; its role is to tether CheA to the MCPs and thereby enable appropriate modulation of CheA autokinase activity by the associated MCPs (24Gegner J.A. Graham D.R. Roth A.F. Dahlquist F.W. Cell. 1992; 70: 975-982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In its simplest form, this “adapter model” predicts that cheW missense mutations that alter CheW activity in vivo should have a corresponding effect on the affinity of the protein for CheA and/or MCPs. Here we report our characterization of the altered binding properties of six mutant versions of CheW that were identified by virtue of their altered abilities to support chemotaxis in vivo under a variety of different conditions. Our results provide the first direct experimental support for the hypothesis that CheW binding interactions with MCPs and CheA are indeed important for its in vivo function. However, these results also suggest that the role of CheW may be more complex than simply tethering CheA to the MCPs; close-to-normal affinities for CheA and MCPs do not guarantee that CheW will function correctlyin vivo. Fluorescein-5-maleimide was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR), stored at −20 °C in the dark, and used under minimal lighting conditions. Polyethylene glycol 12,000 (PEG12,000) was purchased from Fluka and Sigma. All other chemicals were purchased from standard sources and were of reagent grade. All bacterial strains used in this work are derivatives ofE. coli K12. Strains RP437 (32Parkinson J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 135: 45-53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and RP3098 (Δ(flhA-flhD) (33Smith R.A. Parkinson J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3388-3399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) was used for swarm assays, whereas strain RP3098, lacking all chemotaxis genes, was used for purification of most of the proteins in this study. E. coli strain BL21 (λDE3) (36Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Duberndorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar) was used for production of (His)6-LZ-Tarc and CheY. Plasmid pCW (31Gegner J.A. Dahlquist F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 750-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) containing the wild type cheW gene under control of the tac promoter was modified to generate plasmid pCnoW (lacking cheW gene but otherwise identical to pCW) and plasmid pCE (engineered to attach Met-(His)6-Cys to the N-terminal end of CheW). To make pCnoW, aStyI-XbaI piece of pCW was excised, and theStyI and XbaI overhangs were ligated. This deletion removed codons 24–167 of cheW. To create pCE, an oligonucleotide ((CATCAC)3TGCGAATTC) was inserted at the NdeI site located at the cheWstart codon in pCW. This oligonucleotide added coding sequences for a Met-(His)6-Cys extension at the N-terminal end of CheW and introduced an EcoRI site upstream of the new, engineeredcheW start codon. Wild type cheW and mutantcheW alleles were PCR-amplified from appropriate pCW vectors using primers that generated EcoRI and SalI sites upstream and downstream, respectively, of the cheW coding sequence. These PCR products were digested with EcoRI andSalI and ligated into corresponding sites of pCE. The vector for overexpression of (His)6-LZ-Tarc(pDE:LZ-Tarc) was created by ligating the GCN4-Tarc coding sequence of pGCN4-pR (19Cochran A.G. Kim P.S. Science. 1996; 271: 1113-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) into pET14b. Plasmid pAR1:tar, encoding full-length Tar, was used to prepare membrane vesicles containing overproduced levels of E. coliTar. Plasmids pAR1:cheA and pT7:cheY (37Stewart R.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2030-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) were used for overexpression of CheA and CheY, respectively. All plasmids created in the course of this work were verified by dideoxy sequencing (performed at the University of Maryland Center for Agricultural Biotechnology). cheW mutants (except 154ocr) were obtained by random hydroxylamine mutagenesis of plasmid-encoded cheW following a procedure reported previously (5Mutoh N. Oosawa K. Simon M.I. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 992-998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Swarm assays (38Wolfe A.J. Berg H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6973-6977Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) were used to screen transformants of ΔcheW strain D392 for mutantcheW alleles. Wild type CheW and mutant CheW proteins were purified from theE. coli strain RP3098 transformed with plasmid pCE:cheW. CheW overexpression was induced by addition of 1 mm IPTG to cells in early exponential phase. 4 h after induction, cells were harvested by centrifugation. Cell pellets were resuspended in phosphate buffer (0.05 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) with 1 mm imidazole, 0.3 m NaCl, and 2 μm 2-mercaptoethanol) and processed to produce protein extracts as described in the protocol of Hess et al. (11Hess J.F. Oosawa K. Kaplan N. Simon M.I. Cell. 1988; 53: 79-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) for CheA preparation. Extracts were then loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen Inc., Santa Clarita, CA) chromatography column. After washes with 1 and 20 mmimidazole in phosphate buffer, protein was eluted from the column with 140 mm imidazole in phosphate buffer. Collected protein was dialyzed against TEGDP buffer, pH 7.5 (50 mm Tris, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and loaded onto a DEAE column (Whatman). CheW was eluted from this column with a 0 to 0.3 m NaCl gradient in TEGDP buffer. Fractions containing CheW were identified by SDS-PAGE, concentrated to ∼200 μm using a Centrifugal Filter Device (Millipore), and dialyzed against TEGDP buffer before storage at −80 °C. (His)6-LZ-Tarc was purified from BL21(λDE3) cells carrying plasmid pDE:LZ-Tarc. Cells were grown at 30 °C in Luria Broth containing 100 μg ml−1ampicillin until the culture reached early exponential phase and then induced with 125 μm IPTG. 3 h later cells were harvested by centrifugation. Cell pellets were resuspended in phosphate buffer, and protein extracts were produced as described above. Extracts were loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column. After washing this column with 50 mm imidazole in phosphate buffer, we eluted (His)6-LZ-Tarc with 100 mmand 350 mm imidazole in phosphate buffer. Fractions containing (His)6-LZ-Tarc were then pooled and concentrated to ∼200 μm using a Centrifugal Filter Device before dialysis against TEGDP buffer and storage at −80 °C. Inner membrane vesicles containing Tar and control vesicles lacking receptors were prepared from E. coli strain RP3098 carrying pAR1:tar and pCnoW, respectively, according to the procedure of Osborne and Munson (39Osborne M.J. Munson R. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 642-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) as modified by Gegner et al. (24Gegner J.A. Graham D.R. Roth A.F. Dahlquist F.W. Cell. 1992; 70: 975-982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Membrane vesicles were stored in TEND buffer, pH 7.5 (50 mm Tris, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1 m NaCl, and 0.5 mmdithiothreitol), at −20 °C. CheA and CheY were purified from RP3098/pAR1:cheA and BL21/pT7:cheY, respectively, using previously published procedures (40Wolfe A.J. Stewart R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1518-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The concentrations of purified proteins were estimated spectrophotometrically using calculated extinction coefficients (41Gill S. Hippel P.H. v. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar) ((His)6-Cys-CheW, ε280 = 6,085m−1 cm−1; CheA, ε280 = 16,300 m−1cm−1; CheY, ε280 = 8,250m−1 cm−1; LZ-Tarc, ε280 = 8,480 m−1cm−1) and by staining of protein bands on SDS-PAGE (for membrane vesicles). Fresh transformants of strain D392 carrying pCW (encoding wild type or mutant CheW) were stabbed into the center of tryptone swarm plates (38Wolfe A.J. Berg H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6973-6977Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 42Adler J. Science. 1966; 153: 708-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar) containing 0.3% Difco BactoAgar in tryptone broth (1% tryptone, 0.5% NaCl), 100 μg ml−1 ampicillin, and 0–50 μm IPTG. The diameter of the outermost ring of the resulting swarm colonies was measured after incubating the plates in a humid incubator at 30 °C. Wild type CheW and mutant CheW proteins (modified with a (His)6-Cys tag), 200 μm, were spin-dialyzed against 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, using Bio-Gel P-6 columns (Bio-Rad) and then treated with 2 mmfluorescein-5-maleimide for 30 min at 25 °C. Labeled protein (F*-CheW) was then spin-dialyzed against TEGD buffer (TEGDP buffer without phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) to remove the fluorescein that was not covalently attached to CheW. The labeled proteins were then stored at −20 °C. Fluorescence anisotropy experiments were carried out using a Jobin Yvon-Spex Fluoromax-2 Spectrofluorometer. Samples were maintained at 25 °C in a thermostated cuvette holder. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 492 and 517 nm, respectively, and the monochromators were set to give slit widths of 5 nm. A solution of F*-CheW (0.8 μm) was prepared in TEND buffer containing 10% (w/v) PEG12,000 and then passed through a 0.45-μm filter. Aliquots of 110 μm CheA were added to a 1.25-ml sample of filtered F*-CheW solution in a cuvette. After each addition, fluorescence anisotropy was measured and subsequently plotted as a function of CheA concentration. The resulting binding isotherm was fitted using Equation 1 to determine the dissociation constant for CheW-CheA interaction (K d CheA),(A−Ao)/(Af−Ao)=[CheA]/([CheA]+KdCheA)Equation 1 In Equation 1 (A −A o )/(A f − A o ) is the fraction of the total anisotropy change observed for a particular sample in a titration series; A o is the initial anisotropy of F*-CheW before addition of CheA;A f is a maximum anisotropy observed at saturation; and [CheA] is the concentration of free CheA in solution (equivalent to total [CheA] in these experiments because of the low concentrations of CheW and the relatively weak affinity of the CheW-CheA interaction). The best fit of Equation 1 to the CheW-CheA binding isotherm in the presence of PEG12,000 yielded aK d CheA value of 6.0 ± 0.2 μm.

Inner membrane vesicles containing Tar (final concentration 0–20 μm) or lacking receptors were incubated with F*-CheW (final concentration 2 μm) in TEND buffer containing 1 mg/ml BSA (to minimize nonspecific association of CheW with the membranes). These incubations were carried out in the dark for 10 min at 25 °C with gentle agitation. These membrane-protein mixtures were then subjected to centrifugation for 1 min at 13,500 rpm in a Hermle (Labnet) microcentrifuge to sediment the membranes and F*-CheW bound to the Tar in the membranes. An aliquot of the resulting supernatant was then diluted into TEND buffer, and the resulting fluorescence intensity was measured (Jobin Yvon-Spex Fluoromax-2 Spectrofluorometer with the excitation and emission wavelengths set as described above).

https://openalex.org/W2069063077,"The oxidative stress response operates by inducing the expression of genes that counteract the stress. We show here that the oxidative stress-responsive transcription factor Bach2 is a generic inhibitor of gene expression directed by the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response element, the Maf recognition element, and the antioxidant-responsive element. The Bach2-enhanced green fluorescent protein bicistronic retrovirus was used to monitor the fate of Bach2-expressing cells at the single cell level. Bach2 exerted an inhibitory effect on NIH3T3 cell proliferation and caused massive apoptosis upon mild oxidative stress in both NIH3T3 and Raji B-lymphoid cells. Interestingly, Bach1, a highly homologous protein, could not induce cell death, demonstrating the specificity for the apoptosis induction. Although both oxidative stress and leptomycin B, an inhibitor of nuclear export, induce nuclear accumulation of Bach2, the leptomycin B-induced nuclear accumulation of Bach2 was not sufficient to elicit apoptosis. Upon oxidative stress, Bach2 formed nuclear foci that associated with promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies. Our results suggest that Bach2 constitutes a cell lineage-specific system that couples oxidative stress and cell death and that inhibition of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response element, the Maf recognition element, and the antioxidant-responsive element upon oxidative stress may be critical determinants for apoptosis.

In addition, ROS have been shown to act as intracellular second messengers for certain cytokines and growth factors (1Ohba M. Shibanuma M. Kuroki T. Nose K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 2Irani K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Sollott S.J. Der C.J. Fearon E.R. Sundaresan M. Finkel T. Goldschimidt-Clermont P.J.

Several observations suggest that ROS may mediate apoptosis. Apoptosis also appears to be induced by p53 in part by the transcriptional induction of redox-related genes that supposedly lead to increased levels of ROS (4Polyak K. Xia Y. Zweler J.L. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1997; 389: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2246) Google Scholar). Although the importance of ROS in the execution of apoptosis is still controversial, they are likely to be involved as second messengers in the apoptotic signal transduction pathway. For example, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 is activated by hydrogen peroxide to induce apoptosis (5Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Fujii M. Takeda K. Tobiume K. Sawada Y. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2596-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (2092) Google Scholar). However, the specific molecular targets of ROS in apoptosis signaling are still largely unknown, leaving the mechanisms responsible for ROS-induced cell death unclear.

Karin M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2390-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar). Originally, four different subclasses of basic leucine zipper (bZip) dimers were identified (i.e. AP-1, ATF/cAMP response element-binding protein, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein, and Maf) based upon the DNA sequences they bind (7van Dam H. Castellazzi M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2453-2464Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Dimers of the oncoprotein, v-Maf, and its related factors bind to Maf recognition elements or MARE (8Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 700-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Kataoka K. Igarashi K. Itoh K. Fujiwara K.T. Noda M. Yamamoto M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2180-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Because MARE embeds a 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) response element (TRE), it is also a binding site for the Jun and Fos family members (8Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 700-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the small Maf proteins (i.e. MafF, MafG, and MafK) bind to versions of MARE and activate transcription by forming heterodimers with the CNC (Cap'n'Color) family of bZip proteins including the hematopoietic transcription factor NF-E2 p45 and its related factors Nrf1, Nrf2, and Nrf3 (10Andrews N.C.

In a yin-yang scenario typical in biological systems, transcription activators are often opposed by repressors that target the same DNA elements. This is also the case for the Maf-CNC system. Like NF-E2 p45 and others, Bach1 and Bach2 form heterodimers with the small Maf proteins to bind to MARE. However, the resulting heterodimers repress MARE-dependent transcription (16Oyake T. Itoh K. Motohashi H. Hayashi N. Hoshino H. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6083-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Furthermore, homodimers of the small Maf and small Maf/Fos heterodimers also function as repressors (9Kataoka K. Igarashi K. Itoh K. Fujiwara K.T. Noda M. Yamamoto M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2180-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 17Igarashi K. Itoh K. Motohashi H. Hayashi N. Matuzaki Y. Nakauchi H. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. J. Biol.

Thus, there appears to be a complex transcriptional antagonism regulating MARE-dependent gene expression and its cross-talk with the TRE-dependent system. The presence of a vast number of combinations of MARE-binding factors, including those both positive and negative, suggests that MARE is involved in various biological processes and that deregulation of MARE-mediated gene expression underlies cell transformation by Maf and AP-1 oncoproteins. One clue to understanding the biological function of MARE is its close resemblance to the antioxidant-responsive element, ARE. Cells protect themselves against ROS with various defensive mechanisms including compounds such as glutathione and metallothioneins and detoxifying enzymes like glutathione S-transferase and heme oxygenase 1. The inducible expression of these genes is mediated at least in part by ARE. When compared with other AP-1-binding DNA sequences, ARE is related most closely to MARE (8Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 700-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Rushmore T.H. King R.G. Paulson K.E. Pickett C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Conversely, MARE confers oxidative stress inducibility upon reporter genes in transfection assays, suggesting that MARE is endowed with an ARE-like activity (22Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y.

Oxidative stress regulates subcellular localization of Bach2 through an oxidative stress-sensitive conditional nuclear export (23Hoshino H. Kobayashi A. Yoshida M. Kudo N. Oyake T. Motohashi H. Hayashi N. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15370-15376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), suggesting a role for Bach2 as a biological switch that processes and transduces oxidative stress into the nucleus. In cultured cells, Bach2 is localized in the cytoplasm through its C-terminal evolutionarily conserved cytoplasmic localization signal (CLS). The CLS directs leptomycin B-sensitive and Crm1/Exportin1-dependent nuclear export. However, CLS is distinct from the conventional leucine-rich class of nuclear export signal in that oxidative stress aborts the CLS activity and induces nuclear accumulation of Bach2 (23Hoshino H.

Regulation of transcription factor localization is a key aspect of many signal transduction pathways. Considering its regulation, Bach2 appears to play an important role in the oxidative stress response in mammalian cells. To understand the biological function of Bach2 in the oxidative stress response, we first asked whether Bach2 is a specific repressor of MARE or a generic repressor of TRE, MARE, and ARE. We carried out Bach2 overexpression studies and examined its effect and dynamics at the level of a single cell during oxidative stress. Finally, we show dynamic interaction of Bach2 with promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies. Retroviral vectors were constructed using the MSCV/IRES-EGFP vector. FLAG epitope-tagged Bach2, Bach2ΔBTB, Bach2ΔZip, and Bach1 cDNAs were constructed as follows. An expression plasmid pcDNA3.1FLAG for FLAG fusion proteins was constructed by inserting FLAG-coding cDNA between the NotI and BamHI sites of pcDNA3.1B (Invitrogen). The FLAG cDNA was 5′-GGCGGCCGCTCTAGACCATGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGGGATCC-3′ (the NotI and BamHI sites are underlined). An entire open reading frame of mouse Bach2 cDNA (16Oyake T. Itoh K. Motohashi H. Hayashi N. Hoshino H. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6083-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) was isolated by PCR and inserted into the BamHI site of pcDNA3.1BFLAG, resulting in pcDNAFLAGBach2. The primers possessing BamHI site at each 5′ end, were 5′-GTTAAGGATCCATGTCTGTGGATGAGAGACCT-3′ and 5′-GTTAAGGATCCCTAGGCATAATCTTTCCTGGG-3′ (initiation and stop codons are underlined). A 2.5-kilobase pair NotI and Hin dIII fragment was isolated from the pcDNAFLAGBach2, filled in, and inserted into the HpaI site of MSCV/IRES-EGFP (28Kume A., Xu, R. Ueda Y. Urabe M. Ozawa K. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1193-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To construct Bach2ΔBTBFLAG, the EcoRI-BamHI fragment was isolated from Bach2 cDNA, filled in, and cloned into the blunt-ended KpnI site of pcDNA3.1FLAG, resulting in pF-ΔBTBB2. A filled-in NotI and Hin dIII fragment of pF-ΔBTBB2 was cloned into the HpaI site of MSCV/IRES-EGFP. To construct the Bach2ΔZip retrovirus vector, NotI and PmeI fragments were isolated from the Bach2ΔZip expression vector (29Muto A. Hoshino H. Madisen L. Yanai N. Obinata M. Karasuyama H. Hayashi N. Nakauchi H. Yamamoto M. Groudine M. Igarashi K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5734-5743Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), filled in, and cloned into the HpaI site of MSCV/IRES-EGFP. The PCR-created mouse Bach1 cDNA fragment (16Oyake T. Itoh K. Motohashi H. Hayashi N. Hoshino H. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6083-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) was inserted into the BamHI and Hin dIII site of pcDNA3.1FLAG, generating pF-Bach1. The primers (5′-GTTAAGAATGATCAATGTCTGTGAGTGAGAGT-3′ and 5′-GTTAAGAAGCTTTTACTCGTCAGTAGTGCACTT-3′) contained the BclI and Hin dIII sites, respectively, and were amplified between the initiation and stop codons of Bach1. A 2.5-kilobase pair filled-in NotI and Hin dIII fragment of pF-Bach1 was inserted into the HpaI site of MSCV/IRES-EGFP. To generate chimeric cDNAs of Bach1 and Bach2, portions of the respective cDNAs were isolated by PCR and ligated into pcDNA3.1BFLAG. The primers used to generate B1B2A were: 5′-GTTAAGAATGATCAATGTCTGTGAGTGAGAGT-3′ and 5′-GCAGCAGGTACCCAGGCTAATCACACAAGC-3′ containing the BclI and KpnI sites, respectively (for Bach1 amplification) and 5′-GCAGCAGGTACCAATTCCAGTGACGAGTCT-3′ and 5′-GCAGCAAAGCTTCTAGGCATAATCTTTCCT-3′ containing the KpnI and Hin dIII sites, respectively (for Bach2). Amplified DNA were digested with BclI and KpnI or KpnI and Hin dIII and were inserted between the BamHI and Hin dIII sites of pcDNA3.1BFLAG, resulting in pcDNAFLAGB1B2(A). The primers used to generate B2B1B were: 5′-GTTAAGGATCCATGTCTGTGGATGAGAAGCCT-3′ and 5′-GCAGCAGGATCCGTAAGACTGCTCACATTT-3′ containing the BamHI site (for Bach2) and 5′-GCAGCAGGATCCGACTCTGAGACGGACACG-3′ and 5′-GTTAAGAAGCTTTTACTCGTCAGTAGTGCACTT-3′ containing the BamHI and Hin dIII sites, respectively (for Bach1). Amplified DNA were digested with BamHI or BamHI and Hin dIII and were inserted between the BamHI and Hin dIII sites of pcDNA3.1BFLAG, resulting in pcDNAFLAGB2B1(B). pcDNAFLAGB1B2(C) was constructed by substituting the EcoRI-Hin dIII fragment of pcDNAFLAGB1B2(A) with a Bach2 cDNA amplified with a primer set of 5′-GCAGCAGAATTCGAAGAGGAGGAAGAAGAG-3′ and 5′-GCAGCAAAGCTTCTAGGCATAATCTTTCCT-3′ containing EcoRI and Hin dIII sites, respectively. To generate retrovirus vectors, NotI-Hin dIII DNAs were isolated from these chimeric cDNA plasmids and bluntly inserted into the HpaI site of the MSCV/IRES-EGFP vector. The reporter plasmids are based on a TATA box-luciferase reporter plasmid and were described previously (8Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 700-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Igarashi K. Kataoka K. Itoh K. Hayashi N. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M.

The MARE reporter 1 possesses three copies of the palindromic MARE, whereas reporter 23 possesses mutated MARE, retaining functional TRE, and thus allows binding of Jun/Fos dimers but not Maf dimers (8Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 700-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ARE reporter was described previously (30Kataoka K. Handa H. Nishizawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34074-34081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Transfection reporter assays were carried out as described previously (23Hoshino H. Kobayashi A.

Three independent experiments, carried out in duplicate, were performed, and the results are averaged and diagrammed with the standard errors. Phoenix Ecotropic packaging cells were provided by Dr. G. P. Nolan. The packaging cells and NIH3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nissui) with 10% fetal bovine serum (JRH BioSciences), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Bach2-overexpressing and control Raji clones were described previously (31Sasaki S. Ito E. Toki T. Maekawa T. Kanezaki R. Umenai T. Muto A. Nagai H. Kinoshita T. Yamamoto M. Inazawa J. Taketo M.M. Nakahata T. Igarashi K. Yokoyama M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3739-3749Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The cells were treated with diethyl maleate (DEM) or H2O2 (WAKO-jyunyaku) at the indicated concentrations. Phenix Ecotropic packaging cells were transfected with each retroviral vector construct using FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and the viral supernatants were harvested 2 days after transfection. For infection, retroviral-containing supernatants with 4 μg/ml Polybrane were added to NIH3T3 cells. After 3 h of incubation in a 5% CO2 incubator, fresh culture medium was added. Two days post infection, infected NIH3T3 cells were harvested and passaged. Whole cell extracts were prepared from transduced NIH3T3 cells or transfected QT6 cells, separated on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore), and processed for reaction with antibodies as described previously (29Muto A. Hoshino H. Madisen L. Yanai N. Obinata M. Karasuyama H. Hayashi N. Nakauchi H. Yamamoto M. Groudine M. Igarashi K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5734-5743Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). All of the antibody reactions were performed in Tris-buffered saline (0.15 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) with 5% skim milk and 0.05% Tween 20. Detection of peroxidase activity was performed with an ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). NIH3T3 cells were collected using Trypsin-EDTA (Sigma) treatment, and the cells were stained with 2.5 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) in PBS. The cells were sorted using a fluorescence cell sorter (FACScalibur; Becton Dickinson). The collected data were analyzed by CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson). To detect the cell surface phospholipid phosphatidylserine, NIH3T3 cells were stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated annexin V (PharMingen) in annexin binding buffer (PharMingen) for 15 min at room temperature without any fixation. Transfected 293T cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 1× PBS. Thereafter cells were permeablized with 0.1% SDS, 0.5% Triton X-100, PBS for 10 min. For the detection of PML and Bach2, fixed cells were incubated with rabbit anti-Bach2 antiserum (F69-2; Ref.16) and mouse anti-PML (Santa Cruz) diluted at 1:500 and 1:200, respectively, in 1% bovine serum albumin, 1× PBS. Cy3-conjugated sheep anti-mouse (Jackson ImmunoResearch Lab.), fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Tago), and Cy3-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory), diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin, 1× PBS, were used as secondary antibodies. All of the antibody incubations were performed at 37 °C for 30 min. The nuclei were stained with 10 μm Hoechst 33342. The images were taken with a Leica epifluorescence microscope equipped with a charge-coupled device camera controlled by QFluoro software (Leica). Adobe Photoshop was used for presentation of the images. To understand the repertoires of genes that are regulated by Bach2, we first examined the effects of Bach2 upon TRE, MARE, or ARE reporters in co-transfection assays using NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 1). Bach2 repressed MARE-dependent reporter gene expression (palindromic MARE reporter 1 and NF-E2-type MARE from the chicken β-globin gene) as well as the TRE reporter (reporter 23). In addition, the ARE reporter that possesses three copies of ARE of GST-Ya gene (30Kataoka K. Handa H. Nishizawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34074-34081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) was also efficiently inhibited. In contrast, Bach2 had no effect on the reporter plasmid carrying mutated MARE sequences (reporter 17), verifying its sequence specificity. The oxidative stressor DEM that depletes glutathione induced MARE- and ARE-dependent expression but not TRE-dependent expression, suggesting a functional distinction among the related enhancers. Co-expression of Bach2 efficiently inhibited the induction of MARE and ARE by DEM. These results indicate that Bach2 inhibits the related enhancers TRE, MARE, and ARE as well as the induction of the latter two elements upon oxidative stress. Bach2 most likely binds to MARE and ARE along with the small Maf protein in transfected cells (16Oyake T. Itoh K. Motohashi H. Hayashi N. Hoshino H. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6083-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). On the other hand, because Bach2 binds to TRE as a homodimer in vitro (16Oyake T. Itoh K. Motohashi H. Hayashi N. Hoshino H. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6083-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar), its homodimer may repress TRE. The above results suggest Bach2 as a generic inhibitor of TRE-related enhancers. To evaluate the effect of Bach2 expression on cellular function at the level of a single cell, we employed a bicistronic retroviral system possessing the encephalomyocarditis virus-derived IRES and the EGFP with a murine stem cell virus backbone (28Kume A., Xu, R. Ueda Y. Urabe M. Ozawa K. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1193-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Virus-infected cells can be monitored individually without selecting clonal stable cell lines. This is important when one is to analyze the effects of toxic gene products. The structures of retroviral vectors used in this study are depicted in Fig. 2 A. The wild-type Bach2 cDNA and its derivatives were placed upstream of the IRES-EGFP. Some of the cDNAs were tagged with a FLAG epitope-coding sequence to monitor their expression. Bach2ΔBTB lacked the BTB domain that is specific to Bach1 and Bach2 among the NF-E2-related factors. The BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-a-brac) domain is found in more than 100 human proteins (32International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium, Nature 409, 2001, 860–921Google Scholar) and mediates oligomer formation (33Bardwell V.J.

Bach2ΔZip lacked the leucine zipper region that mediates dimerization with small Maf family factors and is thus essential for DNA binding. To compare their biological functions, we also constructed a FLAG-Bach1 retrovirus. To verify their expression, we prepared extracts from infected NIH3T3 cells and performed immunoblot analyses using an anti-Bach2 monoclonal antibody (Fig. 2 B) or anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 2 C and see below). The epitope of the anti-Bach2 antibody resides just upstream of the basic region. 2A. Muto, S. Tashiro, and K. Igarashi, unpublished observation. The retroviruses expressed antigens of expected sizes and at similar levels (Fig. 2 B). Activation of TRE- and MARE-dependent transcription appears to lead to transformation (8Kataoka K. Noda M.

Because Bach2 represses both TRE- and MARE-dependent transcription, it is possible that Bach2 is a negative regulator of cell proliferation. To test this possibility, we infected NIH3T3 cells with the retroviruses and monitored changes in the relative numbers of infected and uninfected cells (i.e.EGFP-positive and -negative cells) in each cell culture using a FACS. Four days after infection, more than 50% of the cells were EGFP-positive. Thereafter, levels of Bach2-expressing cells were remarkably reduced as determined by the ratios of EGFP-positive cells (Fig. 3 A). Diminution of Bach2-expressing cells was very rapid, and the numbers were reduced to 1.6% by day 14 post-infection (Fig. 3 B). The disappearance of Bach2-expressing cells was confirmed by immunoblot analyses of cell extracts with the anti-Bach2 antiserum (Fig. 3 C). Four days after infection, the cells expressed Bach2 abundantly. However, by day 12 post-infection, there were no detectable levels of Bach2 being expressed. The relative numbers of Bach2ΔBTB-expressing cells also decreased after infection. However, the kinetics for reduction was slower than that for cells expressing the full-length Bach2 (Fig. 3 B). In addition, a significant fraction of cells was still EGFP-positive at 14 days post-infection. The ratios of Bach2ΔZip-expressing cells did not change (Fig. 3, A and B). Because these Bach2 derivatives are expressed at similar levels (Fig. 2 B), the differences in their inhibit"

We show in the reductive half-reaction of pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) reductase that NADPH binds to form an enzyme-NADPH charge transfer intermediate prior to hydride transfer from the nicotinamide coenzyme to FMN. In the oxidative half-reaction, the two-electron-reduced enzyme reacts with several substrates including nitroester explosives (glycerol trinitrate and PETN), nitroaromatic explosives (trinitrotoluene (TNT) and picric acid), and α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds (2-cyclohexenone). Oxidation of the flavin by the nitroaromatic substrate TNT is kinetically indistinguishable from formation of its hydride-Meisenheimer complex, consistent with a mechanism involving direct nucleophilic attack by hydride from the flavin N5 atom at the electron-deficient aromatic nucleus of the substrate. The crystal structures of complexes of the oxidized enzyme bound to picric acid and TNT are consistent with direct hydride transfer from the reduced flavin to nitroaromatic substrates. The mode of binding the inhibitor 2,4-dinitrophenol (2,4-DNP) is similar to that observed with picric acid and TNT. In this position, however, the aromatic nucleus is not activated for hydride transfer from the flavin N5 atom, thus accounting for the lack of reactivity with 2,4-DNP. Our work with PETN reductase establishes further a close relationship to the Old Yellow Enzyme family of proteins but at the same time highlights important differences compared with the reactivity of Old Yellow Enzyme.

Bioremediation is an attractive means of decontaminating such sites (1Hooker B.S. Skeen R.S. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 428Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), which has led to a search for enzymes capable of degrading high explosive compounds. We previously isolated a strain of Enterobacter cloacae (strain PB2) on the basis of its ability to utilize nitrate ester explosives such as pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN)1 and glycerol trinitrate (GTN) as a sole nitrogen source (2Binks P.R. French C.E. Nicklin S. Bruce N.C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 1214-1219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ability ofE. cloacae PB2 to utilize nitrate esters as a nitrogen source is conferred by the NADPH-dependent flavoenzyme PETN reductase (3French C.E. Nicklin S. Bruce N.C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6623-6627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of the cloned gene encoding PETN reductase has established a close evolutionary relationship with the flavoenzyme Old Yellow Enzyme (OYE) (4Saito K. Thiele D.J. Davio M. Lockridge O. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20720-20724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and related enzymes such as bacterial morphinone reductase (5French C.E. Bruce N.C. Biochem.

Some steroids act as substrates, whereas others are inhibitors of both PETN reductase and OYE.

The enzyme is a conventional 8-fold β/α barrel protein that contains a single FMN redox center and that overall resembles the structure of OYE (15Fox K.M. Karplus P.A. Structure. 1994; 2: 1089-1105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). However, the mode of steroid binding to oxidized enzyme differs from that seen with OYE in that the reactive olefinic bond in the steroid is not positioned over the flavin N5 (14Barna T. Khan H. Bruce N. Barsukov I. Scrutton N. Moody P. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 433-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Reactions performed with “A-side” deuterated nicotinamide cofactor have shown that in two-electron-reduced PETN reductase the steroid is “flipped” compared with the mode of binding to oxidized enzyme (14Barna T. Khan H. Bruce N. Barsukov I. Scrutton N. Moody P. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 433-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In this flipped binding mode the reactive olefinic bond is aligned with the flavin N5 atom in a geometry that is compatible with hydride transfer to the steroid substrate. Deuterium labeling methods have enabled us to assign the reactive olefinic bond as the C-1–C-2 bond in 1,4-androstadiene-3,17-dione and prednisone, to elucidate the stereochemistry of bond reduction, and to propose a mechanism for the reduction of cyclic enones (14Barna T. Khan H. Bruce N. Barsukov I. Scrutton N. Moody P. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 433-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Our work on the stereochemistry of olefinic bond reduction by PETN reductase again establishes a close relationship with OYE. Vaz et al. (16Vaz A.D. Chakraborty S. Massey V. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4246-4256Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) have shown that reduction of α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds by OYE proceeds by hydride transfer from the flavin N5 to the β carbon followed by proton uptake at the α carbon, a finding that is consistent with our more recent determination of the stereochemistry of bond reduction catalyzed by PETN reductase. In this paper we report a detailed kinetic analysis of the reaction of PETN reductase with NADPH and the substrate 2-cyclohexenone, which is used widely as a “generic” substrate of the OYE family of enzymes. We also report studies of enzyme oxidation by nitroester substrates (GTN and PETN) and the nitroaromatic explosives TNT and picric acid. The structures of PETN reductase complexed with picric acid, TNT, 2-cyclohexenone, and the inhibitor 2,4-dinitrophenol (2,4-DNP) are also presented, and they provide atomic insight into the mechanism of nitroaromatic reduction and the reduction of α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. Complex bacteriological media were from Unipath, and all media were prepared as described by Sambrooket al. (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Mimetic Orange 2 affinity chromatography resin was from Affinity Chromatography Ltd. Q-Sepharose resin was fromAmersham Biosciences. PETN reductase was prepared fromEscherichia coli JM109/pONR1 and purified as described (3French C.E. Nicklin S. Bruce N.C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6623-6627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but we also incorporated a final chromatographic step using Q-Sepharose (14Barna T. Khan H. Bruce N. Barsukov I. Scrutton N. Moody P. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 433-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). NADPH, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glucose 6-phosphate, benzyl viologen, methyl viologen, 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthaquinone, phenazine methosulfate, and 2,4-DNP were from Sigma. 2-Cyclohexenone was from Acros Organics. Dr. S. Nicklin (United Kingdom Defense and Evaluation Research Agency) supplied TNT, GTN, PETN, and picric acid. The following extinction coefficients were used to calculate the concentration of substrates and enzyme: NADPH (ε340 = 6.22 × 103m−1cm−1); PETN reductase (ε464 = 11.3 × 103m−1 cm−1); and 2-cyclohexenone (ε232 = 11.0 × 103m−1 cm−1). Stock solutions of TNT (600 mm) were made up in acetone. Dilutions were then made into potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and the acetone concentration was maintained at 1% (v/v). The presence of acetone in buffers at 1% (v/v) was shown not to affect enzyme activity. Redox titrations were performed within a Belle Technology glove box under a nitrogen atmosphere (oxygen maintained at <5 ppm) in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Anaerobic titration buffer was prepared by flushing freshly prepared buffer with oxygen-free nitrogen. PETN reductase admitted to the glove box was deoxygenated by passing through a Bio-Rad 10DG column, with final dilution of the eluted protein to give a concentration of ∼60 μm. Solutions of benzyl viologen, methyl viologen, 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthaquinone, and phenazine methosulfate were added to final concentrations of 0.5 μmas redox mediators for the titrations. Absorption spectra (300–750 nm) were recorded on a Varian (Cary 50 probe) UV-visible spectrophotometer, and the electrochemical potential was monitored using a Hanna instruments pH/voltmeter coupled to a Russell platinum/calomel electrode. The electrode was calibrated using the Fe(II)/Fe(III)-EDTA couple (+108 mV) as a standard. The enzyme solution was titrated electrochemically using sodium dithionite as reductant and potassium ferricyanide as oxidant, as described by Dutton (18Dutton P. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 54: 411-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). After the addition of each aliquot of reductant and after allowing equilibration to occur (stabilization of the observed potential), the spectrum was recorded, and the potential was noted. The process was repeated at several (typically ∼40) different potentials. In this way, a set of spectra representing reductive and oxidative titrations was obtained. Small corrections were made for any drift in the base line by correcting the absorbance at 750 nm to 0. The observed potentials were corrected to those for the standard hydrogen electrode (platinum/calomel + 244 mV). Data manipulation and analysis were performed using Origin software (Microcal). The absorbance values at wavelengths of 468 nm (close to the oxidized flavin maximum) were plotted against potential. The data were fitted using Equation 1, which represents a concerted two-electron redox process derived by extension to the Nernst equation and the Beer-Lambert Law, as described previously (18Dutton P. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 54: 411-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). A468=(a+b10(E12−E)/29.5)1+10(E12−E)/29.5(Eq. 1) where A468 is the absorbance value at 468 nm at the electrode potential E, and a and b are the absorbance values of the fully oxidized and reduced enzyme, respectively, at 468 nm. In using Equation 1 to fit the absorbance potential data, the variables were unconstrained, and regression analysis provided values in close agreement with those of the initial estimates. Throughout the titration the enzyme remained soluble, and corrections for turbidity were not required. Rapid reaction kinetic experiments were performed using an Applied Photophysics SF.17MV stopped-flow spectrophotometer contained within an anaerobic glove box (Belle Technology). Time-dependent reductions of PETN reductase with NADPH were performed by rapid scanning stopped-flow spectroscopy using a photodiode array detector and X-SCAN software (Applied Photophysics). Spectral deconvolution was performed by global analysis and numerical integration methods using PROKIN software (Applied Photophysics). For single wavelength studies, the data collected at 464 and 560 nm were analyzed using nonlinear least squares regression analysis on an Acorn Risc PC microcomputer using Spectrakinetics software (Applied Photophysics). The experiments were performed by mixing PETN reductase in the appropriate buffer with an equal volume of NADPH in the same buffer at the desired concentration. For studies of the oxidative half-reaction, PETN reductase was titrated with sodium dithionite to the two-electron level and then mixed with 2-cyclohexenone. In reductive and oxidative reactions, the concentration of substrate was always at least 10-fold greater than that of enzyme, thereby ensuring pseudo-first order conditions. For each substrate concentration, at least five replica measurements were collected and averaged. Transients were generally recorded at 5 °C to maximize data capture for fast reaction rates. For slow oxidizing substrates (i.e. TNT and 2-cyclohexenone), transients were recorded at 25 °C. Observed rate constants for flavin absorption changes accompanying (i) mixing of oxidized PETN reductase with NADPH or (ii) oxidation of reduced PETN reductase by oxidizing substrates were obtained from fits of the data to a single exponential expression. Reductive transients at 464 nm are strictly biphasic (see “Results”), but the fast first phase (charge transfer formation) contributes only a very small absorption change, making analysis using a biphasic expression inappropriate. For this reason fitting using a single exponential expression was used, and analysis was performed on the kinetic transient in which the signal for the first 20 ms after the mixing event was truncated. In the reductive half-reaction, transients at 560 nm were analyzed using the following equation. A600=kobs1kobs2−kobs1C(e−kobs1t−e−kobs2t)+b(Eq. 2) where kobs 1 and kobs 2 are observed rate constants for the formation and decay of an oxidized enzyme-NADPH charge transfer species, respectively, C is the amplitude term, and b is an off-set value. The observed rates for the oxidative half-reaction were fitted using the rapid equilibrium formalism of Strickland et al. (Ref. 19Strickland S. Palmer G. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4048-4052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and Equation 3) for the kinetic scheme (Equation 4). kobs=k3[S]Kd+[S](Eq. 3) A+B⇌k2k1C⇌k4k3D(Eq. 4) In Equation 4, A is two-electron-reduced PETN reductase, B is oxidizing substrate, C is the reduced enzyme-substrate complex, and D is the oxidized enzyme-product complex. The lack of an ordinate intercept in plots ofkobs against substrate concentration indicates that substrate reduction is essentially irreversible (i.e. k4 = ∼0). PETN reductase was titrated with stock solutions of picric acid, 2,4-DNP, and TNT in 50 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Spectroscopic titrations were performed using a Jasco double-beam V-550 spectrophotometer. Spectral changes resulting from the addition of ligand to PETN reductase indicated a 1:1 binding stoichiometry and the isosbestic points observed during the titration indicated a single step process. Absorption changes (ΔA) at 518 nm were plotted against ligand concentration. The data were fitted using Equation 5 to obtain dissociation constants (Kd) for the enzyme-ligand complex. ΔA=ΔAmax2ET(LT+ET+Kd)−(LT+ET+Kd)2−(4LTET)0.5(Eq. 5) where ΔAmax is the maximum absorption change at 518 nm, LT is the total ligand concentration, and ET is the total enzyme concentration. Multiple turnover studies were performed under anaerobic conditions, and the reaction progress was monitored by absorption spectroscopy. The reaction mix (total volume, 1 ml) comprised 0.2 μm PETN reductase, 30 μmNADPH, and 100 μm TNT contained in 50 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and the reactions were performed at 25 °C. An NADPH-generating system comprising 10 mmglucose 6-phosphate and 1 unit of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase was also included in the reaction mix. UV-visible spectra were recorded using a Jasco V530 spectrophotometer contained within a Belle Technology anaerobic glove box. Crystals of PETN reductase-ligand complexes were prepared by cocrystallization in the manner described previously for PETN reductase-steroid complexes (14Barna T. Khan H. Bruce N. Barsukov I. Scrutton N. Moody P. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 433-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The crystals have space group P212121 with one molecule/asymmetric unit. The data were measured and reduced with the HKL suite (20Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar), and electron density maps were calculated using the CCP4 suite (21Collaborative Computational ProjectActa Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar) and displayed using XtalView (22McRee D. J. Mol. Graphics. 1992; 10: 44-46Crossref Google Scholar). Refinement was carried out with CNS (23Brunger A. Adams P. Clore G. DeLano W. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N. Read R. Rice L. Simonson T. Warren G.

The observed spectral changes indicated the lack of turbidity during the course of titration, and no hysteretic effects were observed. Spectra recorded at similar potentials in the reductive and oxidative phases of the titration were essentially identical. Representative spectra for the reductive phase are shown in Fig. 1, and a plot of the absorbance at 468 nm versus potential is shown in the inset of Fig. 1. Evidence for population of a semiquinone species during reductive and oxidative titrations was not obtained. A good fit of the data to Equation 1 was observed. The spectral changes accompanying reduction of PETN reductase contrast with those seen for the photoreduction of OYE in which the anionic red semiquinone is populated (24Massey V. Hemmerich P. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) but are similar to comparable titrations performed with bacterial morphinone reductase (25Craig D.H. Barna T. Moody P.C. Bruce N.C. Chapman S.K. Munro A.W. Scrutton N.S. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Equation 1 describes a concerted two-electron reduction of the enzyme and fitting the spectroelectrochemical data for PETN reductase produced a value forE12 of −193 ± 5 mV. The spectral changes accompanying reduction of PETN reductase by a stoichiometric concentration β-NADPH are illustrated in Fig.2A. Our previous studies with deuterated NADPD (A-side) have indicated that hydride transfer is from the A-side of the nicotinamide ring, consistent with the known stereospecificity of OYE (26Massey V. Schopfer L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1215-1222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the spectral changes accompanying flavin reduction by numerical integration methods using a two-step model (A → B → C) revealed the presence of three enzyme forms. A is oxidized PETN reductase, B is an enzyme-NADPH charge transfer intermediate characterized by a long wavelength absorption (550–700 nm), and C is PETN reductase containing the dihydroflavin form of FMN. Residual absorption at ∼460 nm indicates that reduction of the flavin is not complete, suggesting that hydride transfer is reversible. Reversibility will depend on the redox potentials of the FMN and NADPH in the enzyme-NADPH charge transfer complex, and these may differ from the potentials of NADPH in solution (−320 mV) and unliganded PETN reductase (−193 mV). The kinetic scheme and observed spectral changes are similar to those described previously for OYE (26Massey V. Schopfer L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1215-1222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and bacterial morphinone reductase (27Craig D.H. Moody P.C.E. Bruce N.C. Scrutton N.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7598-7607Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and is shown as a series of reversible reactions in Scheme 1. Eox+NADPH⇌k−1k1EoxNADPH⇌k−2k2EredNADP+⇌k−3k3Ered+NADP+SCHEME 1 The observed rate constants for the formation and decay of the enzyme-NADPH charge transfer complex and hydride transfer from NADPH to FMN were obtained by performing rapid mixing experiments of PETN reductase with NADPH using single wavelength detection. The large absorption changes at 464 nm are suitable for monitoring flavin reduction (i.e. step B → C), and a typical reaction transient is shown (Fig.3A). Charge transfer formation and decay were monitored at 560 nm (Fig. 3B). The rate of charge transfer decay (560 nm) is identical to the rate of flavin reduction (464 nm), indicating that decay of the enzyme-NADPH charge transfer complex is a direct consequence of flavin reduction. Formation of the charge transfer complex is not readily observed at 464 nm, because of the small accompanying absorption change and relatively large absorption change for flavin reduction at the same wavelength. However, a small deviation from the fit to a single exponential expression is seen in the very early time domain of the transient (up to ∼20 ms after mixing; not shown), which is likely attributed to formation of the NADPH-enzyme charge transfer complex. Formation of the charge transfer species is more readily observed at 560 nm (i.e. the “up” phase of the kinetic transient) (Fig.3B). Equation 2 describes the early phase of the kinetic transient reasonably well, but there is a small deviation from the fit, perhaps suggesting that more than one discrete charge transfer species accumulates in the early time domain (Fig. 3B, inset). Similar deviations (but more pronounced) have been seen with our work on the nicotinamide-dependent flavoprotein human cytochrome P-450 reductase (28Gutierrez A. Lian L.Y. Wolf C.R. Scrutton N.S. Roberts G.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1964-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).FIG. 3Kinetic transients observed for the reductive half-reaction of PETN reductase. A, transient observed at 464 nm; B, transient observed at 560 nm. Theinset in B illustrates the same reaction recorded over 12 ms fitted to Equation 2. The conditions were: 50 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0; the reactions were performed using 20 μm PETN reductase and 200 μm NADPH at 5 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The dependence of the observed rates for formation of the charge transfer species and flavin reduction (i.e. charge transfer decay) on NADPH concentration is illustrated in Fig.4. Consistent with our kinetic scheme for the reductive half-reaction, the rate of formation of the charge transfer species shows a linear dependence on NADPH concentration. The second order rate constant for formation of the charge transfer complex is 0.95 × 106 ± 0.02 × 106m−1 s−1. For Scheme 1, the value of the positive intercept of the ordinate axis (32 ± 7 s−1) approximates to k2 +k−1. Additionally, the observed rate of flavin reduction (∼12 s−1) measured at 464 nm is independent of NADPH concentration (Fig. 4). An approximate value of 20 s−1 for k−1 can therefore be estimated that gives rise to a value of about 20 μm for the enzyme-NADPH dissociation constant. Given that the rates of flavin reduction were measured at NADPH concentrations of 100 μmand above, this would account for the lack of apparent dependence of the flavin reduction rate on NADPH concentration (Fig. 4). In studies performed with estrogen-binding protein (29Buckman J. Miller S.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10521-10531Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) and OYE (26Massey V. Schopfer L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1215-1222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an additional intermediate has been proposed prior to formation of the charge transfer complex. Incorporation of such an intermediate into Scheme 1 for PETN reductase would still be consistent with the observed kinetic behavior, but in the absence of direct evidence for such an intermediate, we have omitted to show the presence of a pre-charge transfer species in the catalytic scheme. PETN reductase uses a number of oxidizing substrates including 2-cyclohexenone, the nitroesters GTN and PETN, nitroaromatics picric acid, and TNT. 2-Cyclohexenone is a common oxidizing substrate for the OYE family of enzymes (8Williams R.E. Rathbone D. Bruce N.C. Scrutton N.S. Moody P.C.E. Nicklin S. Ghisla S. Kroneck P. Macheroux P. Sund H. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Rudolf Weber, Berlin1999: 663-666Google Scholar). Studies of the oxidative half-reaction with 2-cyclohexenone were initiated by mixing two-electron-reduced PETN reductase, generated by titration with sodium dithionite, with substrate. Analysis of multiple wavelength data indicated that oxidation occurred without the development of visible charge transfer intermediates or product release steps (not shown). The data were best described using a single-step model (A →B) in which A is two-electron-reduced enzyme and B is oxidized enzyme. The rate of flavin oxidation was investigated as a function of 2-cyclohexenone concentration in single wavelength studies at 464 nm (Fig.5A). Observed rates were hyperbolically dependent on 2-cyclohexenone concentration, and the kinetic parameters were determined by fitting the data to Equa"

Thus, the induction of chaperone expression by these proteins could explain their prion-curing effects. heat shock element stress response element There are several proteins in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which, similar to mammalian prions, can undergo autocatalytic conformational rearrangement. This process can last stably for many cellular generations, resulting in some cases in heritable phenotypes (1Wickner R.B. Taylor K.L. Edskes H.K. Maddelein M.L. Moriyama H. Roberts B.T. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 130: 310-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The most studied of the yeast prion proteins is the translation termination factor Sup35 (eRF3), which is related to the [PSI +] determinant. The prion state of Sup35 is characterized by its aggregation and partial inactivation, which causes the nonsense-suppressor [PSI +] phenotype (2Patino M.M. Liu J.J. Glover J.R. Lindquist S. Science. 1996; 273: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 3Paushkin S.V. Kushnirov V.V. Smirnov V.N. Ter-Avanesyan M.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3127-3134Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Different [PSI +] isolates (“strains”) may vary in the efficiency of suppression, which presumably reflects different structures of Sup35 aggregates. The [PSI +] strains with strong suppression (“strong”) are highly stable, the strains with weak suppression (“weak”) show decreased mitotic stability (4Derkatch I.L. Chernoff Y.O. Kushnirov V.V.

Ter-Avanesyan M.D. Yeast. 2001; 18: 489-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Studies of the yeast prions confirmed that they reproduce the basic properties of their mammalian prototype and also show profound similarities to another related phenomenon, amyloids. In particular, purified Sup35 formed amyloid fibers in vitro (6Glover J.R. Kowal A.S. Schirmer E.C. Patino M.M. Liu J.J. Lindquist S. Cell. 1997; 89: 811-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Therefore, Sup35 could be used as a convenient model for studying the basic features of both the prion and amyloid phenomena, and it is likely that the cellular factors interfering with the propagation of yeast prions are similar to those that can interfere with the prion or amyloid formation in animals. Although in vitro Sup35 alone is sufficient for its conformational rearrangement, in vivo some cellular proteins can participate in this process and modulate its efficiency. The most important of them is the Hsp104 chaperone, which is strictly required for the [PSI +] propagation, although its excess interferes with [PSI +] (7Chernoff Y.O. Lindquist S.L. Ono B. Inge-Vechtomov S.G. Liebman S.W. Science. 1995; 268: 880-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). The chaperones of the Hsp70 family showed weaker effects; the overexpression of Ssb1 cured weak [PSI +] strains (8Chacinska A. Szczesniak B. Kochneva-Pervukhova N.V. Kushnirov V.V.

Wegrzyn R.D. Lindquist S.L. Chernoff Y.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1325-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Mutational alterations of Hsp104 and Ssa1 could also cause [PSI +] elimination (7Chernoff Y.O. Lindquist S.L. Ono B. Inge-Vechtomov S.G. Liebman S.W.

Construction of heterologous [PSI +] ([PSI +PS]) provided a sensitive instrument for identification of novel factors involved in the prion propagation. [PSI +PS] is based on a hybrid Sup35, in which the native prion domain was replaced with its analog from the yeast Pichia methanolica (12Kushnirov V.V. Kochneva-Pervukhova N.V. Chechenova M.B. Frolova N.S. Ter-Avanesyan M.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 324-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Compared with [PSI +], [PSI +PS] showed increased sensitivity to overexpression of the Hsp70 chaperones Ssa1 and Ssb1 and the Hsp40 chaperone Ydj1 but decreased sensitivity to the excess Hsp104 (9Kushnirov V.V. Kryndushkin D.S. Boguta M. Smirnov V.N. Ter- Avanesyan M.D. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1443-1446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The [PSI +PS] curing by chaperones showed remarkable prion strain specificity. The chaperones ranked differently by their curing efficiency for each prion strain. This finding supports the existence of different prion structures corresponding to prion strains and differential sensitivity of these structures to curing mechanisms associated with different chaperones. Thus, the sets of chaperones able to cure a given prion may differ for different prions and prion strains. [URE3] prion was cured by overproduced Ydj1 but was insensitive to excess Hsp104 (13Moriyama H. Edskes H.K. Wickner R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8916-8922Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Recent studies of [RNQ+ ] showed that it depends on another chaperone of the Hsp40 family, Sis1, which has not been found among the factors curing [PSI +] (14Sondheimer N. Lopez N. Craig E.A. Lindquist S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2435-2442Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Deletion of the inessential glycine- and phenylalanine-rich region of Sis1 abolished propagation of this prion. It should be noted that all mentioned chaperones are considered to be related functionally. Hsp70 and Hsp40 represent eukaryotic homologues of the bacterial chaperone system DnaK-DnaJ, and Ydj1 and Sis1 are presumed to be partners for Ssa1 (15Lu Z. Cyr D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27824-27830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In vitro, Ssa1 and Ydj1 cooperated with Hsp104 to reactivate the aggregates of heat-denatured luciferase, with each of the chaperones being essential for this process (16Glover J.R. Lindquist S. Cell. 1998; 94: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). To find additional factors that can influence the prion propagation in yeast and presumably in other organisms we decided to use the potential of the [PSI +PS] system to perform a systematic screen for the genes that cure [PSI +PS] when overexpressed. The search revealed genes coding for two chaperones of the Hsp40 family, Sis1 and previously uncharacterized Ynl077w, Sti1 chaperone, transcriptional factors Sfl1 and Ssn8, and acidic ribosomal protein Rpp0. The following yeast strains were used: 5V-H19 (MATa ade2–1 SUQ5 ura3–52 leu2–3,112 can1–100 [psi −]), PS-5V-H19 (obtained from 5V-H19 by replacing SUP35 for the chimericalSUP35-PS allele), and their derivatives carrying independently isolated [PSI +] variants, weak and strong determinants ([PSI +W] and [PSI +S]) in 5V-H19 and strong [PSI +PS-1] and [PSI +PS-2] variants in PS-5V-H19 (12Kushnirov V.V. Kochneva-Pervukhova N.V. Chechenova M.B. Frolova N.S. Ter-Avanesyan M.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 324-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Strain 1A-H74 (MATα ade2–1 SUQ5 ura3–52 leu2–3,112 his3 SUP35-PS[PSI +PS-1]) was derived from a cross between strains PS-5V-H19 [PSI +PS-1] and 4V-H73 [psi −] (12Kushnirov V.V. Kochneva-Pervukhova N.V. Chechenova M.B. Frolova N.S. Ter-Avanesyan M.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 324-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Yeast were grown at 30 °C in rich (YPD) or synthetic (SC) media. Standard genetic methods were used (17Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). DNA transformation of lithium acetate-treated yeast cells was performed as described (18Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Willems A.R. Woods R.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1704) Google Scholar). To determine the [PSI +] loss, four transformants with each plasmid were grown on 5-fluoroorotic acid medium (17Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar) to induce the plasmid loss and then cloned on YPD medium. The loss of [PSI +] or [PSI +PS] was scored as a ratio of red- and white-colored colonies. At least 100 clones of each transformant were counted (300 or more for cases of less than 1% loss frequency). To test the invasive growth, cells were grown on YPD for 3 days and washed off the agar surface, and the plates were incubated for 1 more day. Digestion of plasmid and yeast chromosomal DNA by restriction enzymes, electrophoresis of DNA fragments, and cloning inEscherichia coli were performed as described (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Yeast genomic libraries based on the multicopy URA3 vectors YEplac195 and pRS426 were used (20Urakov V.N. Valouev I.A. Lewitin E.I. Paushkin S.V. Kosorukov V.S. Kushnirov V.V. Smirnov V.N. Ter-Avanesyan M.D. BMC Mol. Biol. 2001; 2: 9Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 21Lorenz M.C. Heitman J. Genetics. 1998; 150: 1443-1457PubMed Google Scholar). From the library plasmids isolated in the screen, the following genomic fragments containing single open reading frames responsible for the prion-curing effects were cloned into the YEplac195 vector (22Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene. 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2521) Google Scholar): for SIS1, the 3.4-kb KpnI-BamHI fragment; forYNL077w, 3.2-kb EcoRI-BglII; forSTI1, 2.6-kb AvrII-NsiI; forSFL1, 3.7-kb KpnI-Eco72I; forSSN8, 2.6-kb Eco72I-PstI; and forRPP0, the 2.2-kb XmaIII fragment. Centromeric YCp111-SSA4pro-lacZ plasmid was obtained in two steps. TheSSA4 promoter was amplified by PCR with oligonucleotides AGGTCAATCCGGTAGATGTG and GGCGTCGTTCTATTACCTTG and cloned into the SmaI site of YIp366 (23Myers A.M. Tzagoloff A. Kinney D.M. Lusty C.J. Gene. 1986; 45: 299-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) immediately upstream of the lacZ gene. Then, the 4.2-kbBsrGI fragment of this plasmid containing theSSA4 promoter-lacZ fusion was inserted into theAcc65I site of YCplac111 (22Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene. 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2521) Google Scholar). Integrative SUP35promoter-lacZ fusion construct was made by cloning the 1.2-kb PvuII-PstI fragment of pEMBLyex-SUP35 (24Ter-Avanesyan M.D. Kushnirov V.V. Dagkesamanskaya A.R. Didichenko S.A. Chernoff Y.O. Inge-Vechtomov S.G. Smirnov V.N. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) into the SmaI and PstI sites of YIp366. For genomic integration, this plasmid was cut with SnaBI. The pUKC1600 plasmid containing the lacZ gene under the control of HSP104 promoter (25Ferreira P.C. Ness F. Edwards S.R. Cox B.S. Tuite M.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1357-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) was a kind gift of F. Ness. The 4.5-kb NruI-HindIII fragment of pUKC1600 containing the HSP104-lacZ construct was inserted into the EheI- and HindIII-digested vector YCplac111 to generate the YCp111-HSP104-lacZ plasmid. The integrative HSE1-lacZ and STRE-lacZ fusion constructs based on pLS9 (26Sarokin L. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 2521-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) were a kind gift of H. Ruis. The 2.3-kb PstI-Eco47III fragments of each construct encompassing the promoters and a part oflacZ were ligated with the 7.4-kbPstI-Eco47III fragment of the YCp111-SSA4-lacZ plasmid, resulting in the centromeric YCp111-HSE-lacZ and YCp111-STRE-lacZ plasmids used here. The disruption cassette forSSN8 was constructed as follows. The 2.3-kbPstI-EcoRI fragment of YEplac195-SSN8 was inserted into the corresponding polylinker sites of pBC KS+ (Stratagene), forming the pBC-SSN8 plasmid. Then, the 1.2-kbPvuII-SmaI fragment of pJJ244 (27Jones J.S. Prakash L. Yeast. 1990; 6: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), containing the disruption marker URA3, was inserted inside the coding region of the SSN8 gene by BglII andSphI sites blunted with Klenow, forming thessn8::URA3 cassette. The KpnI fragment from this cassette was used to disrupt the genomic SSN8locus. Gene disruption was verified by Southern hybridization (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For this, a 2.3-kb KpnI probe from thessn8::URA3 cassette was hybridized with genomic DNA double digested with StuI and ScaI. For the SFL1 disruption, a 1.2-kbPvuII-SmaI fragment of pJJ244 was inserted into the YEplac195-SFL1 plasmid in place of the internal BsaBI fragment of SFL1, forming thesfl1::URA3 cassette. TheNheI-SpeI fragment from this cassette was used to disrupt the genomic SFL1 locus. The disruption was confirmed by Southern hybridization of 2.5 kb of NheI-SpeI probe from sfl1::URA3 cassette with genomic DNA digested with EcoRV. Yeast cultures were grown in liquid YPD medium or in a medium selective for plasmid marker to an A 600 of 1.5. The cells were harvested, washed in water, and lysed by glass beads in buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min. To equalize the protein concentration in samples, the concentration was determined according to Ref. 28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216357) Google Scholar, where required. To analyze the distribution of Rpp0, cells were treated with 0.1 mg/ml cycloheximide for 15 min before harvesting and then broken by glass beads in Buffer A, supplemented with 0.2 mg/ml cycloheximide and 10 mm MgCl2. The extracts were fractionated by centrifugation through a 7–40% sucrose gradient. Distribution of ribosomal RNA in the fractions was analyzed using 0.8% agarose electrophoresis with ethidium bromide. The presence of Rpp0 was revealed by Western blotting using a polyclonal antibody against Rpp0 (kind gift of J.-P. G. Ballesta). For Western blotting, proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels according to Ref. 29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207200) Google Scholar and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose sheets. Bound antibody was detected using the Amersham Biosciences ECL system. β-Galactosidase activity was measured as described (30Casadaban M.J. Martinez-Arias A. Shapira S.K. Chou J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 100: 293-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar) except that the cells were permeabilized by subjecting them to two freeze/thawing cycles using liquid nitrogen and a water bath at 37 °C. ThePvuII-HindIII fragment, encoding Sfl1 without the first 29 amino acids, was inserted into the Ecl136II (SacI) and HindIII sites of pET-30a (Novagen) to generate pET30a-SFL1 encoding His6-Sfl1 fusion. E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLysE (Novagen) transformed with this plasmid was grown to an A 600 of 0.5 at 30 °C and then Sfl1 expression was induced by addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to 1 mmfor 20 h at 17 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 2500 × g, resuspended in 3 ml of TBS buffer (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8) with 0.2% Triton X-100, and subjected to two freeze/thawing cycles. Then DNase I was added to a final concentration of 150 μg/ml, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. The cell suspension was incubated on ice for 20 min and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris. The His6-Sfl1 protein was purified from the supernatant using 0.3 ml of TALON resin (CLONTECH) according to the instructions from the manufacturer. The purity of the protein was confirmed by electrophoresis with Coomassie Blue staining. Mobility shift assays were performed as described (31Lowndes N.F. Johnson A.L. Johnston L.H. Nature. 1991; 350: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). To create labeled HSE and STRE DNA fragments, oligonucleotides 5′-gtccttctaGAAGCTTC and 5′-ctgtccccTTACGTAA, respectively, were self-annealed by the complementary region (capital letters), and the non-complementary region (lowercase letters) was filled in with Klenow in the presence of [32P]α-dATP. The His6-Sfl1 protein or yeast lysates were incubated with 1 ng (1 × 105 cpm) of the labeled HSE or STRE fragments for 20 min at room temperature in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 7 mmMgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg of poly(dI-dC) nonspecific competitor DNA. Protein·DNA complexes were resolved by electrophoresis in a 4.5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel at 70 V in 0.5× TBE buffer (89 mm Tris base, 89 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA) for 1.5 h. The gel was dried on filter paper (1 h, 80 °C) and exposed to x-ray film overnight at −70 °C. The strain 5V-H19 and its derivative, PS-5V-H19, were used in this work. Both strains carry the ade2–1 UAA nonsense mutation and the SUQ5(SUP16) UAA nonsense suppressor but differ from each other by the SUP35 gene. The original strain carries the wild-typeSUP35 gene allowing maintenance of the conventional [PSI +], whereas its derivative possesses the hybrid allele of this gene, SUP35-PS, necessary for propagation of [PSI +PS] (12Kushnirov V.V. Kochneva-Pervukhova N.V. Chechenova M.B. Frolova N.S. Ter-Avanesyan M.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 324-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar).SUQ5 suppresses ade2–1 only in combination with [PSI +] or [PSI +PS], which results in adenine prototrophy and white colonies. The cells lacking these determinants require adenine and form red colonies. The strain PS-5V-H19 [PSI +PS-1] was transformed with two S. cerevisiae genomic libraries based on the multicopy plasmids YEplac195 and pRS426. A total of about 300,000 transformants were screened. Expression of plasmid-encoded factors interfering with the [PSI +PS] maintenance should either cure [PSI +PS] or slow down the prion conversion, causing increased levels of soluble Sup35. Transformants with such plasmids should have red, red sectored, or pink colonies, in contrast to white colonies of other transformants. About 500 such transformants were selected and refined by cloning. To discriminate the antisuppression and [PSI +PS] curing from spontaneous [PSI +PS] loss, two clones of each transformant were crossed to a tester 1A-H74 [PSI +PS-1] strain. In this test, the transformants that had lost [PSI +PS-1] spontaneously should produce white [PSI +PS] diploids. Such transformants were discarded. Fifty transformants produced red or pink color in diploids and were used for plasmid DNA isolation. The plasmids were used to transform the PS-5V-H19 [PSI +PS-1] strain, and 24 of them yielded red, red sectored, or pink transformants (Fig.1 A). These plasmids were sequenced from the ends of genomic inserts, and the inserts were identified by comparison of the sequences with the yeast genome at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/. Because the inserts usually contained several genes, the genes affecting [PSI +PS] were identified by deletion analysis. The following genes were found: SIS1 (six clones, two independent plasmids), YNL077w (three clones, one independent plasmid), STI1 (one clone, one independent plasmid), SFL1 (two clones, one independent plasmid),SSN8 (three clones, one independent plasmid),RPP0 (three clones, one independent plasmid),SUP35 (six clones, three independent plasmid). TheSUP35 gene product, Sup35, causes antisuppression, but not [PSI +PS] loss, because Sup35 does not aggregate in [PSI +PS] cells and does not interfere with Sup35PS prion aggregation (12Kushnirov V.V. Kochneva-Pervukhova N.V. Chechenova M.B. Frolova N.S. Ter-Avanesyan M.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 324-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). TheYNL077w gene encodes a previously uncharacterized protein of the Hsp40 (DnaJ) family designated hereafter as Apj1 (anti-prion DnaJ). The other genes encode Hsp40 chaperone Sis1, chaperone Sti1, transcriptional factors Sfl1 and Ssn8, and acidic ribosomal protein Rpp0. The effects of overproduction of these proteins, antisuppression and prion loss, were characterized for the independently isolated strains of hybrid and conventional [PSI +] (TableI). These effects did not correlate. For [PSI +PS-1], only excess Sis1 showed significant antisuppression, whereas excess Rpp0 caused the highest prion loss but low antisuppression. It should be noted that, as it was observed previously (9Kushnirov V.V. Kryndushkin D.S. Boguta M. Smirnov V.N. Ter- Avanesyan M.D. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1443-1446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), the relative efficiency of chaperones in prion curing varied depending on the [PSI +] strain and the origin of Sup35 prion domain. The antisuppressor effect of excess Sis1 was mediated by an increase in the levels of soluble Sup35PS (Fig. 1 C), which indicates that Sis1 interfered with the prion conversion.Table IEffects of the anti-prion factors[PSI +] strainEffectOverproduced proteinsSis1Apj1Ydj1Sti1Sfl1pSsn8pRpp0Control[PSI + PS-1]Antisuppression++++++++−Sectored loss−−+−−−++−% Loss139121230.2250.1[PSI + PS-2]Antisuppression+++−++−−Sectored loss−−−−−−−−% Loss102252.252.40.20[PSI + S]Antisuppression−−−−++−−Sectored loss−−−−−−−−% Loss 0.30.10.20350.10[PSI + W]Antisuppression−−−+++−−Sectored loss−−−−+−−−% Loss 0.90.50.51.81530.40.3The effects were determined for the transformants of indicated [PSI +] strains overproducing described proteins.

Although all previously described prion-curing factors represent chaperones, the Sfl1 and Ssn8 proteins belong to a different class, being involved in transcriptional regulation. Sfl1 is a homologue of Hsf1, a key transcriptional factor controlling the heat shock response. Ssn8 represents a human cyclin C homologue that belongs to the transcriptional mediator complex (32Li Y. Bjorklund S. Jiang Y.W. Kim Y.J. Lane W.S. Stillman D.J. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10864-10868Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Ssn8 and Sfl1 interact physically and cooperate in regulation of the SUC2 gene expression (33Song W. Carlson M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5757-5765Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To further characterize the effects of Sfl1 and Ssn8, the chromosomal SFL1 and SSN8 genes were disrupted by insertion of the URA3 gene in the strain PS-5V-H19 [PSI +PS-1]. The clones with disrupted SSN8 showed markedly reduced growth rate. This growth reduction was [PSI +PS]-dependent, because the growth rate returned to normal after passages on GuHCl-containing medium or after transformation with the centromeric pRG416-SUP35C plasmid encoding Sup35 without the prion domain. The growth inhibition could be because of accelerated prion formation. In this case we would observe decreased levels of soluble Sup35PS in the PS-5V-H19 [PSI +PS]ssn8::URA3 strain compared with [PSI +PS]. However, we could not confirm this opportunity, because the soluble Sup35PS levels in these strains were extremely low and difficult to compare. On the other hand, the SSN8 disruption affected translation, because in the PS-5V-H19 [psi −] background it showed 2-fold increased levels of nonsense readthrough compared with [psi −] (data not shown). Such an increase did not allow the suppression of ade2–1 and did not affect growth of the [psi −] strain, but it is likely that, in combination with [PSI +PS], which itself is a strong suppressor, it could be detrimental. In addition, the cells of bothsfl1::URA3 andssn8::URA3 disruptants were distinguished by increased flocculence and invasive growth (Fig.2). These phenotypes were observed earlier for the sfl1 disruptants (34Robertson L.S. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13783-13787Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), and the flocculence was observed in ssn8 mutants (35Carlson M. Osmond B.C. Neigeborn L. Botstein D. Genetics. 1984; 107: 19-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the invasive growth of the ssn8 disruptants is a novel finding. Transcriptional response to heat shock is mediated by binding of Hsf1 to the HSE typical of heat-inducible promoters (36Piper P. Hohmann S. Mager W.H. Yeast Stress Responses. R. G. Landes Company, New York1997Google Scholar). The similarity of Sfl1 to Hsf1 suggests that Sfl1 could also bind to HSE and direct the expression of heat shock-related proteins. Such a possibility was studied by mobility shift assay. HSE was synthesized as an oligonucleotide duplex of 25 base pairs. Purified Sfl1 was obtained via E. coliexpression as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Labeled HSE was incubated with Sfl1 or yeast lysates differing in the levels of Sfl1 and run on a gel (Fig. 3). HSE showed an efficient binding to pure Sfl1, which suggests that Sfl1 can prime the HSE-dependent transcription. HSE also bound some components of yeast lysates, and the amount of such complexes correlated with the Sfl1 levels. This suggests that Sfl1 was a component of these complexes, together with some other proteins, because the mobility of the complexes was lower than that of the pure Sfl1·HSE complex. The amount of the HSE·protein complexes in the lysates lacking Sfl1 was reduced greatly respective to the wild-type lysates. This suggests that under the experimental conditions Sfl1 was a major protein bound to HSE. In contrast, pure Sfl1 did not bind to STRE, another DNA element typical of many heat- and stress-inducible promoters (36Piper P. Hohmann S. Mager W.H. Yeast Stress Responses. R. G. Landes Company, New York1997Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the amount of protein bound to STRE in the lysates depe"

Many of the 5-HT functions are mediated via G protein-coupled receptors that are coupled to multiple heterotrimeric G proteins, including Gs, Gi, and Gq subfamilies (Martin, G. R., Eglen, R. M., Hamblin, M. W., Hoyer, D., and Yocca, F. (1998)Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 19, 2–4). Here we show for the first time that the 5-hydroxytryptamine 4(a) receptor (5-HT4(a)) is coupled not only to heterotrimeric Gs but also to G13 protein, as assessed both by biochemical and functional assays. Using reconstitution of 5-HT4(a) receptor with different G proteins in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf.9) cells, we have proved that agonist stimulation of receptor-induced guanosine 5′-(3-O-thio)triphosphate binding to Gα13protein. We then determined that expression of 5-HT4(a)receptor in mammalian cells induced constitutive- as well as agonist-promoted activation of a transcription factor, serum response element, through the activation of Gα13 and RhoA. Finally, we have determined that expression of 5-HT4(a)receptor in neuroblastoma × glioma NIE-115 cells cause RhoA-dependent neurite retraction and cell rounding under basal conditions and after agonist stimulation. These data suggest that by activating 5-HT4(a) receptor-G13 pathway, serotonin plays a prominent role in regulating neuronal architecture in addition to its classical role in neurotransmission.

These data suggest that by activating 5-HT4(a) receptor-G13 pathway, serotonin plays a prominent role in regulating neuronal architecture in addition to its classical role in neurotransmission. 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT 1The abbreviations used are: 5-HT5-hydroxytryptamine or serotonin5-HT4(a)mouse 5-hydroxytryptamine 4(a) receptorBIMU8(endo-N-8-methyl-8-azabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-3-yl)-2,3-dehydro-2-oxo-3-(prop-2-yl)-1 H-benzimid-azole-1-carboxamideSREserum response elementp115 RhoGEFRho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factorPTXpertussis toxinRGSregulators of G protein signalingSf.9S. frugiperda cellsGTPγSguanosine 5′-(3-O-thio)triphosphateAKAPprotein kinase A-anchoring proteinTCFtertiary complex factorLucluciferaseβ-Galβ-galactosidase or serotonin) is a neuromodulator involved in a wide range of physiological functions via activation of a large family of receptors. With the exception of the 5-HT3 receptor, which is a cation channel, all other 5-HT receptors are members of the superfamily of seven transmembrane-spanning G protein-coupled receptors that are coupled to multiple heterotrimeric G proteins. The 5-HT4 receptor is expressed in a variety of tissues, including brain, gastrointestinal tract, and heart (2Eglen R.M. Wong E.H.F. Dumuis A. Bockaert J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 391-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In the mammalian brain, the 5-HT4receptor contributes to the control of dopamine secretion and regulates learning and long term memory (3Bonhomme N. Cador M. Stinus L., Le Moal M. Spampinato U. Brain Res. 1995; 675: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 4Marchetti-Gauthier E. Roman F.S. Dumuis A. Bockaert J. Soumireu-Mourat B. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Furthermore, 5-HT4receptors are thought to be involved in various central and peripheral disorders, including neurodegenerative disease (5Wong E.H. Reynolds G.P. Bonhaus D.W. Hsu S. Eglen R.M. Behav. Brain Res. 1996; 73: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Therefore, understanding of the signaling pathways regulated by 5-HT4receptor could provide novel insight into physiological and pathophysiological processes in which 5-HT4 receptor is involved. The wide distribution of 5-HT4 receptors is paralleled by the existence of many 5-HT4-splicing variants. In mouse, four 5-HT4 receptor isoforms, 5-HT4(a), 5-HT4(b), 5-HT4(e), and 5-HT4(f), have been cloned (6Claysen S. Sebben M. Becamel C. Bockaert J. A. D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 910-920PubMed Google Scholar). 5-hydroxytryptamine or serotonin mouse 5-hydroxytryptamine 4(a) receptor (endo-N-8-methyl-8-azabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-3-yl)-2,3-dehydro-2-oxo-3-(prop-2-yl)-1 H-benzimid-azole-1-carboxamide serum response element Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor pertussis toxin regulators of G protein signaling S. frugiperda cells guanosine 5′-(3-O-thio)triphosphate protein kinase A-anchoring protein tertiary complex factor luciferase β-galactosidase G13 protein, one of the heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins), regulates diverse and complex cellular responses by transducing signals from the cell surface by activating multiple signaling pathways. Prominent downstream effectors in G13-mediated signaling are members of the Rho family of small GTPases (Rac, Cdc42, and Rho). RhoA, the founding member of the Rho subfamily, has been shown to play a critical role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton required for neurite retraction (7Moolenaar W.H. Kranenburg O. Postma F.R.

Chem. 1998; 273: 28700-28707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In neuronal cells, activation of G12/13-coupled receptors causes RhoA-dependent formation of a cortical shell of F-actin that mediates cytoskeletal contraction, which is thought to underlie growth cone collapse, retraction of developing neurites, and rounding of the cell body (10Kranenburg O. Poland M. Gebbink M. Oomen L. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2417-2427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Kranenburg O. Poland M. van Horck F.P. Drechsel D. Hall A. Moolenaar W.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1851-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor, p115 RhoGEF, has been also shown to directly interact with Gα13 protein (12Hart M.J. Jiang X. Kozasa T. Roscoe W. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Strenweis P.C. Bollag G. Science. 1998; 280: 2112-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar, 13Kozasa T. Jiang X. Hart M.J. Sternweis P.M. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Bollag G. Strenweis P.C. Science. 1998; 280: 2109-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Most recent studies show that Gα13 protein also interacts with and regulates the function of the ERM (ezrin/radixin/moesin) family of proteins (14Vaiskunaite R. Adarichev V. Furthmayr H. Kozasa T. Gudkov A. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26206-26212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). ERM proteins function as cross-linkers between the actin cytoskeleton and the plasma membrane to regulate the organization of cortical actin (15Tsukita S. Yonemura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34507-34510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Another novel and functionally important partner of Gα13 is a protein kinase A-anchoring protein, AKAP110, which is expressed in distinct locations including granule neurons of cerebellum (16Niu J. Vaiskunaite R. Carr D. Kozasa T. Dulin N. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1-5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The AKAP proteins are characterized by a functional “anchoring domain,” which binds to RII (regulatory subunit of protein kinase AII), and a “targeting domain,” which directs the subcellular localization of the protein kinase A-AKAP complex through its association with structural proteins, membranes, or cellular organelles (17Scott J.D. Dell'Acqua M.L. Fraser I.D.C. Tavalin S.J. Lester L.B. Adv. Pharmacol. 2000; 274: 175-207Google Scholar). Although a principal function of AKAPs is to target PKA, some AKAPs can simultaneously bind more than one signaling molecule with different actions, such as kinases and phosphatases (17Scott J.D. Dell'Acqua M.L. Fraser I.D.C. Tavalin S.J. Lester L.B. Adv. Pharmacol. 2000; 274: 175-207Google Scholar). Thus AKAPs serve as scaffold proteins that either prevent cross-talk among related signaling pathways or facilitate signal transduction by preforming multimolecular complexes that can be rapidly activated by incoming signals. It is likely that the diversity of signaling proteins that can interact with Gα13 is a molecular basis for the complex cell functions regulated by Gα13. The molecular interactions that occur between the receptor and G proteins are fundamental to the transduction of signals into specific cellular responses. Using the baculovirus expression system, we have recently provided direct biochemical evidence of the coupling between 5-HT4(a) receptors and Gαs (18Ponimaskin E.G. Heine M. Joubert L. Sebben M. Bickmeyer U. Richter D.W. Dumuis A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 277: 2534-2546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrate the coupling between 5-HT4(a)receptor and Gα13 by measuring directly the activation of G proteins introduced into Sf.9 cells. We then verified that the expression of 5-HT4(a) receptor in mammalian cells induced constitutive activation of an serum response element (SRE) transcription factor, and this response involves activation of Gα13 and RhoA. In addition, we show that expression of 5-HT4(a) receptor in the mouse NIE-115 neuronal cell line causes basal as well as agonist-promoted cell rounding, suggesting that serotonin could regulate neuronal morphology by activation of RhoA through 5-HT4(a) receptor-Gα13 signaling pathway. SRE.L luciferase reporter plasmid was provided by Paul Sternweis. Myc-tagged Gγ2 and Gβ1subunits were provided by Janet Robishaw. N19RhoA was obtained from the Guthrie Research Institute. The RGS domain of p115 RhoGEF was provided by Tohru Kozasa. Wild type Gαs, Gαi2, Gαq, transducin, and RGS4 were provided by Henry Bourne. [35S]GTPγS (1300 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Enzymes used in molecular cloning were obtained from New England Biolabs (Germany). 5-HT, lysophosphatidic acid, and protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads were obtained from Sigma. Myo[3H]inositol was from Amersham Biosciences. BIMU8 was kindly provided by Boehringer Ingelheim (Germany).

Rho antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Gαi, Gαs, Gα13, and Gαq antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The polyclonal antiserum AS9459, raised against the C-terminal peptide of m5-HT4(a) receptor as well as Gα12antibody AS1905 were described previously (19Ponimaskin E.G. Schmidt M.F. Heine M. Bickmeyer U. Richter D.W. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 20Ponimaskin E. Harteneck C. Schultz G. Schmidt M.F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The construction of recombinant baculovirus coding for the murine 5-HT4(a) receptor has been described previously (19Ponimaskin E.G. Schmidt M.F. Heine M. Bickmeyer U. Richter D.W. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For the expression in NIE-115 cells, the murine 5-HT4(a) cDNA was cleaved from pFastBac plasmid (Invitrogen) with XbaI and Hin dIII endonucleases to yield the 1.1-kb fragment containing the entire coding sequence. The fragment was treated with T4 DNA polymerase to create the blunt ends and then ligated to the PmeI site in the multiple cloning site of the pTracer-CMV2 donor plasmid (Invitrogen). The 5-HT4(a) mutants with the substitution of serine for cysteine 328/329, 346, 386, 328/329 + 346, 328/329 + 386, and 346 + 386 were performed in pFastBac/5-HT4(a) plasmid using an oligonucleotide containing the mutation(s) corresponding to the above substitutions by standard PCR protocols using the overlap extension technique. The recombinant baculoviruses encoding for 5-HT4(a) mutants were constructed, purified, and amplified as described previously (21Veit M. Nurnberg B. Spicher K. Harteneck C. Ponimaskin E. Schultz G. Schmidt M.F. FEBS Lett. 1994; 14: 160-164Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). All mutants were verified by double-stranded dideoxy DNA sequencing at the level of the final plasmid. Agonist-promoted binding of [35S]GTPγS to different G proteins induced by stimulation of 5-HT4(a)receptor was performed according to the method described previously (22Ponimaskin E. Behn H. Adarichev V. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Offermanns S. Schmidt M.F. FEBS Lett. 2000; 28: 173-177Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, membranes from Sf.9 cells expressing the 5-HT4(a) receptor or thrombin PAR1 receptor and Gα subunits of Gi2, Gs, Gq, G12, and G13 together with Gβ1γ2 subunits were resuspended in 55 μl of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, containing 2 mmEDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 1 μm GDP. After adding [35S]GTPγS (1300 Ci/mmol) to a final concentration of 30 nm, samples were incubated for 5 min at 30 °C in the absence or presence of BIMU8. The reaction was terminated by adding 600 μl of 50 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.5, containing 20 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 200 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μm GDP, and 100 μm GTP and incubating on ice for 30 min. The samples were incubated for 20 min with 150 μl of a 10% suspension of Pansorbin cells (Calbiochem) preincubated with non-immune serum to remove nonspecific bound proteins. Samples were agitated for 1 h at 4 °C with 5–10 μl of appropriate Gα subunit-directed antiserum preincubated with 100 μl of 10% suspension of protein A-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times and boiled in 0.5 ml of 0.5% SDS, and radioactivity was measured by scintillation spectrometry. SRE-mediated gene expression was determined by SRE.L reporter system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Briefly, NIH3T3 cells at 90% confluency grown on 24-well plates were transfected with the following plasmids (per well): 50 ng of pSRE.L (for SRE-dependent gene expression), 50 ng of pCMV-β-Gal (transfection efficiency control plasmid), and 100 ng of the indicated plasmid, balanced with pCMV vector alone. The day before the experiment, cells were serum-starved in 0.2% calf serum overnight. The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in protein extraction reagent, and the cleared lysates were assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity using the corresponding assay kits (Promega, Madison, WI). To account for differences in the transfection efficiency, luciferase activity of each sample was normalized to β-galactosidase activity and expressed as percent of the maximal response to Gα subunit stimulation. The activity of β-galactosidase was relatively constant. pGEX-2T containing rhotekin-Rho binding domain was provided by Dr. M. A. Schwartz (Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). Bacterial-expressed glutathione S-transferase-rhotekin-Rho binding domain protein was purified from isopropyl-1-thio-d-galactopyranozide (1Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar mm)-induced DH5 cells previously transformed with the appropriate plasmid. Confluent NIH3T3 cells (100-mm dishes) were transfected with 5 μg of the 5HT4(a) receptor or the constitutively active mutant of Gα13, Gα13Q226L, for 48 h. Cells were serum-starved 24 h before the experiment. Cells were quickly washed with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 2 min, and equal volumes of cell lysates were incubated with glutathione S-transferase-rhotekin-Rho binding domain beads (15 μg) at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed 3 times with wash buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and bound Rho was eluted by boiling each sample in Laemmli sample buffer. Samples eluted from the beads and the total cell lysate were then electrophoresed on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, blocked with 5% nonfat milk, and analyzed by Western blotting using a polyclonal anti-Rho-A antibody. The amount of rhotekin-Rho binding domain-bound Rho was normalized to the total amount of Rho in cell lysates for quantitation of Rho activity in different samples using scanning densitometry. NIE-115 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C under 5% CO2. For transient transfection, cells were seeded at low density (5 × 105) into 35-mm dishes and transfected with 1 μg of pTracer or pTracer/5-HT4(a)-wild type using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). At 14–16 h post-transfection, the cells were washed and incubated for 24–36 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium to induce morphological differentiation. In some experiments, 1 μg of Myc-tagged dominant-negative RhoA, N19RhoA, was cotransfected into the cells. Agonist-induced changes in shape were monitored using the LSM510 (Zeiss) confocal microscope with appropriate green fluorescence protein filter setting. Experiments were performed at 37 °C in bicarbonate/CO2-buffered Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cells were either scored rounded, flattened, or flattened with neurites the length of at least twice the cell body diameter (“neurite-bearing”). For each transfection, the percentage of rounded, flattened, and neurite-bearing cells was calculated from at least 400 green cells counted. The experiments were performed in duplicate per transfection, and morphologies were scored without prior knowledge of the dish identities. An average percentage was calculated from at least three independent experiments. Inositol phosphate accumulation was determined as described earlier (23Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Conklin B.R. Gilbert R.L. Hooley R. Bourne H.R. Barber D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4721-4724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, NIH3T3 cells were seeded onto 24-well plates and transfected with the indicated constructs. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were labeled with myo[3H]inositol (2 μCi/ml) for 24 h. They were then washed once with HEPES-buffered Dulbecco's modified medium containing 5 mm LiCl. Total inositol phosphate accumulation was assayed using Dowex columns, and results were expressed as counts/min of [3H]inositol phosphate (103) divided by the sum of the counts/min in both the [3H]inositol phosphate and [3H]inositol fractions. Because Sf.9 cells have virtually no background expression of most mammalian receptors, co-expression of receptor and G protein in insect cells followed by measurements of agonist-promoted binding of [35S]GTPγS to the Gα subunit provides a useful experimental approach for assessing the selectivity of receptor-G protein coupling (24Barr A.J. Brass L.F. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2223-2229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Coupling of 5-HT4(a) receptor and G proteins was evaluated by a [35S]GTPγS binding assay, which determines the GDP-GTP exchange on the Gα subunit. Membranes from Sf.9 cells co-infected with combinations of baculoviruses encoding mammalian G protein subunits (α with Gβ1γ2 in all cases) and 5-HT4(a) receptor were incubated in the presence of [35S]GTPγS. Thereafter, Gα-specific affinity-purified antibodies were used to immunoprecipitate Gα subunits from the detergent extracts. The amount of [35S]GTPγS in the immunoprecipitates was used as a measure of Gα subunit activation. Using this system we found that 5-HT4(a) receptor is coupled to the Gα13 subunit. Fig. 1 shows a set of experiments in which Sf.9 cell membranes containing Gαi2, Gαs, Gα13, Gα12, and Gαq were analyzed for [35S]GTPγS binding. Western blotting analysis confirmed co-expression of the 5-HT4(a) receptor with Gα subunits (data not shown). To determine whether receptor activation could increase GTPγS binding by a specific Gα subunit, cells were incubated with [35S]GTPγS in the presence or in the absence of BIMU8, a specific 5-HT4(a) receptor agonist (2Eglen R.M. Wong E.H.F. Dumuis A. Bockaert J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 391-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Agonist stimulation of 5-HT4(a) receptor did not promote the GTPγS binding to Gαi2, Gα12, and Gαq subunits; however, it significantly enhanced GTPγS binding to Gαs and Gα13 subunits (Fig. 1 A). Omission of the receptor from the assay demonstrated that Gαs or Gα13 alone did not bind [35S]GTPγS (data not shown). Activation of Gαs by a 5-HT4(a)receptor was consistent with our recently reported data (18Ponimaskin E.G. Heine M. Joubert L. Sebben M. Bickmeyer U. Richter D.W. Dumuis A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 277: 2534-2546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Activation of Gα13 by a 5-HT4(a) receptor was a novel observation that required further investigation. In control experiments we co-expressed thrombin receptor PAR1 beside the different G protein α-subunits. Activation of PAR1 with thrombin resulted in a significant increase of [35S]GTPγS incorporation in Gq, G12, and G13(Fig. 1 B). These results confirm our previous data (20Ponimaskin E. Harteneck C. Schultz G. Schmidt M.F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 22Ponimaskin E. Behn H. Adarichev V. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Offermanns S. Schmidt M.F. FEBS Lett. 2000; 28: 173-177Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and demonstrate that both Gq and G12 can be activated in the presence of suitable receptor. Because Gα13 subunit regulates gene expression by transcriptional activation of distinct transcriptional control elements such as SRE (25Fromm C. Coso O.A. Montaner S., Xu, N. Gutkind J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10098-10103Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 26Mao J. Yuan H. Xie W.,M.I.,S. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27118-27123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), we attempted to determine if 5-HT4(a) receptor could stimulate SRE activity. In SRE-mediated transcription of a luciferase reporter gene, an altered c-fos SRE, SRE.L, was placed in front of luciferase gene (27Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). SRE.L binds only to the transcription factor SRF and not to tertiary complex factor (TCF). NIH3T3 cells were transiently transfected with 5-HT4(a) receptor and SRE-driven luciferase reporter. NIH3T3 cells were chosen because the cell line was extensively characterized for Gα13-induced cell responses and also because this cell line does not contain SV40 large T antigen that can cause overexpression in transfected cells. To correct variations in transfection efficiency, an expression vector coding for β-galactosidase was co-transfected with the above constructs, and the expressed β -galactosidase activity was used for normalization of SRE luciferase data. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were serum-starved for an additional 16 h. Thereafter, cells were stimulated with the indicated concentrations of serotonin for an additional 6 h. Then, cells were collected, and induced SRE luciferase reporter activity was measured. Data showed that serotonin induced a dose-dependent SRE activation in the cells transfected with 5-HT4(a) receptor with an EC50 of ∼100 nm (Fig. 2 A). SRE activation was dependent on 5-HT4(a) receptor because serotonin did not induce SRE activation in the cells transfected only with SRE luciferase reporter (data not shown). We previously showed that 5-HT4(a) receptor undergoes dynamic palmitoylation and that receptor stimulation by agonists increases the rate of palmitate turnover (19Ponimaskin E.G. Schmidt M.F. Heine M. Bickmeyer U. Richter D.W. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Because palmitoylation of 5-HT4(a) receptor occurs on two different sites (Cys-328/Cys-329 and Cys-386) (18Ponimaskin E.G. Heine M. Joubert L. Sebben M. Bickmeyer U. Richter D.W. Dumuis A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 277: 2534-2546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we determined agonist-induced SRE activation by independent individual mutants. Data showed that stimulation of the wild type and all acylation-deficient mutants with 10 μm serotonin resulted in SRE activation (Fig. 2 B). Palmitoylation-deficient mutants were able to stimulate SRE as well as wild type receptor. Western blotting analysis showed that both wild type and mutant receptors were expressed at similar levels (Fig. 2 B), thus ruling out a possible difference in the protein expression. Agonist dose dependence of different receptor mutants was virtually superimposable with that of wild type receptor (data not shown), suggesting that potency of palmitoylation-deficient mutants of 5-HT4(a) receptor was also not affected. Because we have previously shown that 5-HT4(a) receptor constitutively activates adenylyl cyclase (18Ponimaskin E.G. Heine M. Joubert L. Sebben M. Bickmeyer U. Richter D.W. Dumuis A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 277: 2534-2546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we studied whether 5-HT4(a) receptor could activate SRE in an agonist-independent manner. Our data showed that expression of wild type 5-HT4(a) receptor induced an increase in SRE activity in a range from 2- to 12-fold above base line and correlated with the amount of input receptor cDNA (from 20 to 800 ng) (Fig. 3 A). We have also determined previously that 5-HT4(a) receptor possesses the constitutive activity that resulted in the agonist-independent cAMP accumulation and that C328S/C329S mutant stimulates cAMP accumulation more potently than its wild type counterpart (18Ponimaskin E.G. Heine M. Joubert L. Sebben M. Bickmeyer U. Richter D.W. Dumuis A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 277: 2534-2546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined whether constitutive activity of the palmitoylation-deficient mutants to induce SRE was influenced. Data showed that all 5-HT4(a) receptor mutants were able to stimulate SRE under basal conditions (Fig. 3 B). Interestingly, the potency of C328S/C329S mutant to stimulate SRE without agonist was slightly reduced, whereas C386S and C328S/C329S/C386S mutants consistently stimulated SRE to a higher degree (Fig. 3 B). Because our data showed that the stimulation of the 5-HT4(a) receptor resulted in the activation of Gαs and Gα13, we examined the identity of the G proteins that mediate the 5-HT4(a)-dependent activation of SRE. To determine whether 5-HT4(a) receptors also functionally couple to Gi/o proteins, we treated the transfected cells with pertussis toxin (PTX, 100 ng/ml for 24 h). This treatment did not reduce 5-HT4(a)-induced SRE activation (Fig. 4 A). PTX also did not affect the serotonin-induced SRE activation in the cells transfected with 5-HT4(a) receptor (Fig. 4 A). To test for the ability of PTX to inhibit Gi-mediated pathway, NIH3T3 cells were transfected with endothelin-1 receptor, ETa, which was coupled to Gq/11, G12/13, and Giheterotrimeric G proteins (26Mao J.

Atomic force microscopy was used to visualize the topography of lipid films containing varying amounts of native surfactant protein B (SP-B). These films were compared with films containing synthetic peptides based on the N terminus of human SP-B: monomeric mSP-B-(1–25) or dimeric dSP-B-(1–25). The formation of typical hexagonal network structures as well as the height of protrusions were shown to depend on the concentration of SP-B. Protrusions of bilayer height were formed from physiologically relevant concentrations of 0.2–0.4 mol % (4.5–8.5 wt %) SP-B upwards. Much higher concentrations of SP-B-(1–25) peptides were needed to obtain network structures, and protrusion heights were not equal to those found for films with native SP-B. A striking observation was that while protrusions formed in films of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC)/1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-(phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)) (DPPG) (80/20) had single bilayer thickness, those formed in DPPC/1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-(phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)) (80/20) had various heights of multilayers, whereas those seen in DPPC/1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine/DPPG (60/20/20) were mainly of bilayer height. For the first time direct observations by atomic force microscopy show (i) that a certain minimal concentration of SP-B is required for the formation of layered protrusions upon film compression, (ii) that protrusion height depends on whether the phospholipids contain an unsaturated fatty acyl chain, and (iii) that protrusion height also depends on whether the unsaturated acyl chain is present in phosphatidylcholine or in phosphatidylglycerol.

Its main function is to reduce the surface tension at the alveolar air/liquid interface, thus preventing the alveoli from collapsing at end-expiration and making breathing at minimal effort possible. This is achieved by the formation of a surface-active film that consists of a lipid monolayer highly enriched in 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC)1 and bilayer or multilayer structures (“surface-associated reservoir”) closely attached to the monolayer. From such multilayer structures surfactant material can be readily incorporated into the monolayer film upon inspiration. The existence of a layered film has recently been visualized in vitro by atomic force and fluorescence light microscopy (1Amrein M. von Nahmen A. Sieber M. Eur. Biophys.

Presently the majority of clinically used surfactants is derived from animals. In an effort to circumvent the possibility of zoonotic infections and to reduce the considerable costs of surfactant production, the use of surfactants containing artificial proteins and lipids is currently under consideration. With respect to the proteins, the hydrophobic surfactant protein B (SP-B) is known to fulfill a crucial role in the lung since respiratory distress is always observed in SP-B-deficient humans (13Tredano M. van Elburg R.M.

Clements J.A. White R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) and has a net positive charge that is thought to be essential for its interaction with negatively charged phospholipids such as phosphatidylglycerol (PG) (17Yu S.H. Possmayer F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1126: 26-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 18Pérez-Gil J. Casals C. Marsh D.

The SP-B amino acid sequence among mammals has been highly conserved (20Haagsman H.P. Diemel R.V. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. A. 2001; 129: 91-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Because of the importance of SP-B for proper surfactant activity, synthetic peptides based on its sequence have been developed: mSP-B-(1–25) is a monomeric synthetic peptide based on the N-terminal segment of human SP-B, while dSP-B-(1–25) is the dimeric form of mSP-B-(1–25) (Fig. 1). The structure and surface activity of these peptides have been investigated thoroughly both in vitro and in vivo. The conformation of mSP-B-(1–25) was found to be α-helical (21Gordon L.M. Lee K.Y.

In vivo experiments showed that SP-B-(1–25) peptides improved lung function in two animal models of surfactant deficiency (24Gupta M. Hernandez-Juviel J.M. Waring A.J. Bruni R. Walther F.J. Am. J.

J. 2000; 16: 1129-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). With respect to the lipids (discussed in Ref. 28Veldhuizen R.A. Nag K. Orgeig S. Possmayer F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1408: 90-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar), it has long been recognized that DPPC (40–50 wt % of the surfactant lipid pool) is responsible for keeping the surface tension near zero during expiration. Negatively charged PG (5–10 wt %) is likely to interact with the positive charges of SP-B. Lipids with unsaturated fatty acids are thought to be important for fluidizing the surfactant film. Various established methods, among which is captive bubble surfactometry, are available to obtain information on surfactant surface activity. In addition to these methods, growing interest has recently emerged in atomic force microscopy (AFM) (29Binnig G. Quate C.F. Gerber C. Phys. Rev. Lett. 1986; 56: 930-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (12523) Google Scholar), which yields information on surface topography, thereby providing new insight into the action of surfactant proteins and lipids during the breathing cycle. Although it has been found that upon compression material is squeezed out of the monolayer to form protrusions connected to the monolayer (1Amrein M. von Nahmen A. Sieber M. Eur. Biophys. J. 1997; 26: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 2Krol S. Ross M. Sieber M. Kunneke S. Galla H.-J. Janshoff A. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 904-918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), it is so far not clear which surfactant components determine the size and height of the protrusions. Therefore, in this study we used AFM to visualize the determinants for protrusion formation. For this purpose, we investigated monolayer films containing either bovine SP-B or an SP-B-(1–25) peptide in the fully saturated lipid system DPPC/1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-(phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)) (DPPG) (80/20, mol/mol) or in the partially unsaturated mixtures DPPC/1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-(phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)) (POPG) (80/20) or DPPC/1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC)/DPPG (60/20/20). DPPC, DPPG, POPC, and POPG were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL); chloroform (CHCl3) and methanol (MeOH) from Labscan (Dublin, Ireland) were high pressure liquid chromatography grade. Bovine SP-B obtained from lung lavage was isolated and characterized according to standard procedures (30Oosterlaken-Dijksterhuis M.A. Haagsman H.P. van Golde L.M.G. Demel R.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10965-10971Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was determined by fluorescamine assay (31Böhlen P. Stein S. Dairman W. Udenfriend S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1973; 155: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). Concentrations of phospholipids were determined according to Rouseret al. (32Rouser G. Fleischer S. Yamamoto A. Lipids. 1970; 5: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2874) Google Scholar). The monomeric peptide mSP-B-(1–25) was synthesized based on the N-terminal 25 amino acids of human SP-B with Cys-11 substituted for Ala (26Waring A.J. Taeusch H.W. Bruni R. Amirkhanian J.D. Fan B.R. Stevens R. Young J. Pept. Res. 1989; 2: 308-313PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The dimeric version of the peptide, dSP-B-(1–25), was obtained by linking two monomer peptides through their only remaining cysteine, Cys-8 (23Veldhuizen E.J.A. Waring A.J. Walther F.J. Batenburg J.J. van Golde L.M.G. Haagsman H.P. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 377-384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Surface pressure-area curves were obtained using a home-built Teflon trough with an operational area of 630 cm2. Surface tension was measured with a platinum Wilhelmy plate connected to a microbalance (Cahn2000, Ankersmit, Oosterhout, The Netherlands). Films, composed of DPPC/DPPG (80/20, molar percentages), DPPC/POPG (80/20), or DPPC/POPC/DPPG (60/20/20) plus varying amounts of bovine SP-B or one of the SP-B-(1–25) peptides, were formed by spreading aliquots in CHCl3/MeOH (1/1, v/v) onto the water subphase at 20 ± 3 °C. Usually an amount of 100 nmol of phospholipid was used for the preparation of a film. After the solvent had been allowed to evaporate for at least 5 min, films were compressed at a rate of 13.8% of the operational area/min (28.8 Å2/molecule of lipid·min) until film leakage occurred (usually at a surface tension of 10–15 mN/m). Repeated measurements gave identical diagrams. For Langmuir-Blodgett transfer, films were prepared on a home-built Teflon trough with an operational area of 66.5 cm2. Surface tension was measured as described above. Before film spreading, a freshly cleaved mica sheet was dipped vertically into a subphase of demineralized water at room temperature (20 ± 3 °C). Films, having the same composition as described for the surface pressure-area curves, were formed by spreading aliquots onto the subphase. Usually an amount of 50 nmol of phospholipid was used for the preparation of a film. The films were compressed at a rate of 8.6% of the operational area/min until a surface tension of 22 mN/m was reached. Subsequently the films were transferred onto a disc of mica (14 mm in diameter) at a rate of 2.0 mm/min at constant surface tension. For AFM measurements, transferred films were mounted on the J-type scanner (150- × 150-μm scan range) of a Nanoscope III Multimode microscope (Digital Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA) operating in contact mode in air. Scanning was performed using oxide-sharpened Si3N4 tips with a spring constant of 0.12 N/m. The force with which the tip scanned the sample was set such that it was as small as possible while the image was stable and clear, which was usually at a force of 15 nN. Samples were checked for possible tip-induced deformation by zooming out after a region had been scanned. Since scanning in tapping mode did not give better images compared with those obtained in contact mode, we used contact mode because of its ease of handling. The computer program SPSS, version 9.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) was used for statistical analysis by analysis of variance with Bonferroni's post-hoc test. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. Pressure-area isotherms were recorded to obtain information about the surface tension at which protrusion formation occurred. Lipid/protein monolayers were compressed by movement of a barrier in a Langmuir-Wilhelmy trough, which leads to a decrease in the area available to the film. Consequently film surface pressure (π) was increased, and film surface tension (γ) was lowered. The relationship between π and γ is given by the equation π = 72.5 − γ, where 72.5 mN/m represents the surface tension of pure water at 21 °C. A typical pressure-area isotherm of pure lipid monolayers is depicted in Fig. 2A. The isotherm of DPPC/DPPG (80/20) shows phase behavior similar to that of pure DPPC. When bovine SP-B was added to DPPC/DPPG (Fig.2B), two plateau regions were observed: the first at a surface pressure of ∼23 mN/m and a second one, which was much more pronounced, at π = 40 mN/m. These plateaus were seen most clearly at higher protein concentrations and are in line with data found for porcine SP-B (2Krol S. Ross M. Sieber M. Kunneke S. Galla H.-J. Janshoff A. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 904-918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). For monolayers containing 4 mol % SP-B the squeeze-out plateau was elongated, and the monolayer could be compressed to very low areas, indicating massive squeeze-out. No additional plateaus were observed above π = 48 mN/m until onset of film collapse (at approximately π = 59 mN/m in our experimental setup), indicating that no extra squeeze-out occurred. For mSP-B-(1–25)-containing monolayers, isotherms of films with 2 mol % or less peptide were identical to isotherms of DPPC/DPPG (Fig.2C). Furthermore, at increasing peptide concentrations no plateau like that observed at π = 40 mN/m for bovine SP-B was seen, but instead a region with a decreased slope was observed between surface pressures of 8 and 32 mN/m, comparable to the first faint plateau observed for bovine SP-B. The region with decreased slope was most clearly visible for monolayers containing as much as 20 mol % peptide. If protrusion formation occurs, it can be expected to be in this region. A similar region with decreased slope was seen for dSP-B-(1–25) peptide-containing monolayers (Fig. 2D). From Fig. 2 it is apparent that the compressibility of bovine SP-B-containing monolayers is considerably higher than that of monolayers containing SP-B-(1–25) peptides at the same concentration. Since squeeze-out had fully occurred above a surface tension of 24 mN/m (i.e. below a surface pressure of 48 mN/m), determinants for protrusion formation were studied using monolayers compressed beyond this plateau to a surface tension of 22 mN/m. Lipid/protein films, compressed to the desired surface tension, were deposited on mica, and the topography was subsequently visualized by atomic force microscopy. Fig. 3 shows the effect of surface tension on film structure using films of DPPC/DPPG/SP-B (80/20/4, mol/mol/mol). Films deposited at γ = 62 mN/m, i.e. when squeeze-out has not yet occurred, showed brighter islands (i.e. having a higher surface) surrounded by darker (i.e. lower) regions (Fig. 3A). According to other AFM studies (2Krol S. Ross M. Sieber M. Kunneke S. Galla H.-J. Janshoff A. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 904-918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 3Takamoto D.Y. Lipp M.M. von Nahmen A. Lee K.Y. Waring A.J. Zasadzinski J.A. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 153-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), the bright islands at this surface tension correspond to liquid-condensed phase, while the dark regions consist of liquid-expanded phase. The liquid-condensed domains showed dark spots (readily seen at higher magnification, Fig.3B), probably consisting of trapped liquid-expanded phase. Upon compression of the monolayer (i.e. decreasing the surface tension) the amount of liquid-condensed phase was increased (Fig. 3C). The difference in height between both lipid phases was found to be 1.2 ± 0.1 nm, which is similar to that found by others (2Krol S. Ross M. Sieber M. Kunneke S. Galla H.-J. Janshoff A. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 904-918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 3Takamoto D.Y. Lipp M.M. von Nahmen A. Lee K.Y. Waring A.J. Zasadzinski J.A. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 153-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Film topography altered dramatically when films were compressed through the second plateau region of the isotherm to a surface tension of 22 mN/m (Fig. 3D). At this surface tension protrusions were formed that appeared as bright mountains among dark valleys consisting of monolayer. The height of the protrusions was 4.1 ± 1.1 nm. It has been shown for the same lipid/protein mixture that while the protrusions consist of proteins as well as lipids in liquid-expanded phase, the lipid monolayer is in liquid-condensed phase (2Krol S. Ross M. Sieber M. Kunneke S. Galla H.-J. Janshoff A. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 904-918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To learn more about the origin and development of the protrusions, we made a concentration curve of bovine SP-B in DPPC/DPPG (80/20) films compressed to a surface tension of 22 mN/m (Figs. 4 and 5). Although indications for protrusion formation were observed even at very low SP-B concentration (0.02 mol %), protrusion height differed with statistical significance through the concentration curve: at very low concentration (0.02 mol %) heights were 0.5 ± 0.1 nm, at low to moderate concentration (0.1–0.2 mol %) heights were 2.0 ± 0.9 nm overall, and at moderate to high concentrations (0.4–8 mol %) heights were 4.1 ± 1.1 nm overall (see Table I for protrusion heights of individual concentrations). Furthermore, upon increasing the protein concentration the protrusion regions became connected and started forming networks of small circular domains (readily observed as white dots in Fig. 4E). The typical hexagonal shape of the cells of the networks is best seen at a physiologically relevant SP-B concentration of 0.2–0.4 mol %. Although AFM determinations in the x and ydirection are not as accurate as in the z direction, widths of samples scanned with the same tip can be roughly compared with each other. Protrusions were found to be disc-like in shape with a typical diameter of ∼35 nm that did not change over the range of SP-B concentrations studied. An interesting observation was the presence of large circles of protruded material captured inside a hexagonal cell most clearly seen in films containing 0.2 mol % SP-B (Fig.4C). The height of these protrusions was 0.7 ± 0.1 nm, suggesting that they represent domains with different lipid orientation. One can speculate that these large circles consist of lipids with extended acyl chains, which have an increased height compared with the lipids around the circles either because the lipids around the circles have tilted chains or because they are in a fluid state like the lipids in the networks. The large circles were not observed at high protein concentrations (2–8 mol %, Fig. 5) at which the monolayer domains were much smaller. Increasing the SP-B concentration led to a higher amount of protruded material until the monolayer had almost vanished, and mostly protruded material was seen (Fig. 5, E and F). Meanwhile the network structures lost their typical hexagonal appearance.

Open table in a new tab AFM images of films containing SP-B-(1–25) peptides differed dramatically from those containing bovine SP-B in the sense that (i) much higher peptide concentrations were needed to obtain the same kind of network structures and (ii) the height of the protrusions was considerably lower than that found for the native protein. Interestingly monomeric mSP-B-(1–25) and dimeric dSP-B-(1–25) were found to have similar film topography (compare Figs. 6 and 7). Although protrusions were visible at 2 mol % SP-B-(1–25) peptides (Figs. 6A and7A), the first indication for structured networks was seen at a peptide concentration of 8 mol % (Figs. 6B and7B). At an SP-B-(1–25) concentration as high as 20 mol %, hexagonal structures comparable to those of 0.4 mol % bovine SP-B were observed, although the size of the hexagonal cells were markedly larger in the case of dSP-B-(1–25) than in that of mSP-B-(1–25) or native SP-B (compare Fig. 7C with Figs. 6C and4D). The overall height of the protrusions was 2.7 ± 1.3 nm for films containing 2 or 8 mol % mSP-B-(1–25) or 2 mol % dSP-B-(1–25); see Table I for protrusion heights at individual c"
https://openalex.org/W2151295061,"Kv4.2 is a voltage-gated potassium channel that is critical in controlling the excitability of myocytes and neurons. Processes that influence trafficking and surface distribution patterns of Kv4.2 will affect its ability to contribute to cellular functions. The scaffolding/clustering protein PSD-95 regulates trafficking and distribution of several receptors and Shaker family Kv channels. We therefore investigated whether the C-terminal valine-serine-alanine-leucine (VSAL) of Kv4.2 is a novel binding motif for PSD-95. By using co-immunoprecipitation assays, we determined that full-length Kv4.2 and PSD-95 interact when co-expressed in mammalian cell lines. Mutation analysis in this heterologous expression system showed that the VSAL motif of Kv4.2 is necessary for PSD-95 binding. PSD-95 increased the surface expression of Kv4.2 protein and caused it to cluster, as shown by deconvolution microscopy and biotinylation assays. Deleting the C-terminal VSAL motif of Kv4.2 eliminated these effects, as did substituting a palmitoylation-deficient PSD-95 mutant. In addition to these effects of PSD-95 on Kv4.2 distribution, the channel itself promoted redistribution of PSD-95 to the cell surface in the heterologous expression system. This work represents the first evidence that a member of the Shal subfamily of Kv channels can bind to PSD-95, with functional consequences.

The influence that voltage-gated ion channels exert on the integrative physiology of excitable cells is determined by the inherent biophysical properties of the channels and their cell surface distribution. Kv4.2 is a fast transient (A-type) voltage-gated potassium (Kv) 1The abbreviations used are: Kvvoltage-gated K+ channelC-Kv4.2ECFP-tagged Kv4.2HEKhuman embryonic kidney cellstsA201human embryonic kidney cells expressing the large T antigenIPimmunoprecipitationPBSphosphate-buffered salineCHOChinese hamster ovaryGFPgreen fluorescent proteinVSALVal-Ser-Ala-LeuECFPenhanced cyan fluorescent proteinNMDAN-methyl-d-aspartic acid channel of the Shal subfamily that is found in heart and neurons (1Chandy K.G. Gutman G.A. North R.A. Ligand- and Voltage-gated Ion Channels. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1995: 1-71Google Scholar). In myocytes, Kv4.2 is a major component of the Ito current, which is crucial for recovery from the QT interval and for repolarization (2Xu H., Li, H. Nerbonne J.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 519: 11-21Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In neurons of the central nervous system, Kv4.2 is expressed primarily somatodendritically (3Maletic-Savatic M. Lenn N.J. Trimmer J.S. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3840-3851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Sheng M. Tsaur M.L. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1992; 9: 271-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), where its concentration at postsynaptic sites may affect the back propagation of action potentials (5Hoffman D.A. Magee J.C. Colbert C.M. Johnston D. Nature. 1997; 387: 869-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and may therefore modulate long term potentiation at synapses (6Adams J.P. Anderson A.E. Varga A.W. Dineley K.T. Cook R.G. Pfaffinger P.J. Sweatt J.D. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2277-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In contrast, Kv1.4, a Kv channel of the Shaker subfamily, is primarily expressed on axons (3Maletic-Savatic M. Lenn N.J. Trimmer J.S. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3840-3851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Sheng M. Tsaur M.L. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1992; 9: 271-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Its positioning along the axon and at presynaptic sites (7Zito K. Fetter R.D. Goodman C.S. Isacoff E.Y.

A. 1991; 88: 380-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). It is therefore crucial to understand the basis for the specialized distributions of Kv channels in order to fully understand their roles in neuronal excitability. The mechanisms that specify ion channel distributions are not well known and likely differ between those that determine localization in sub-domains of cells (e.g. axon, soma, and dendrite) versus lateral organization at the membrane, such as within channel clusters. voltage-gated K+ channel ECFP-tagged Kv4.2 human embryonic kidney cells human embryonic kidney cells expressing the large T antigen immunoprecipitation phosphate-buffered saline Chinese hamster ovary green fluorescent protein Val-Ser-Ala-Leu enhanced cyan fluorescent protein N-methyl-d-aspartic acid Post-synaptic density 95 (PSD-95) is a membrane-associated guanylate kinase that helps localize and cluster numerous proteins. Kv1.4 and other Kv1 members are among the best known examples of in vitro ion channel clustering by PSD-95, but this is the only subfamily of Kv channels known to interact with PSD-95 (12Kim E. Sheng M. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 993-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 13Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). PSD-95-mediated clustering has profound effects on the trafficking of Kv1 channels: it promotes surface expression (14Tiffany A.M. Manganas L.N. Kim E. Hsueh Y.P. Sheng M. Trimmer J.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 147-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and suppresses endocytosis (15Jugloff D.G. Khanna R. Schlichter L.C. Jones O.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1357-1364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Because clusters of PSD-95 with Kv1 channels are apparently immobile (16Li D. Takimoto K. Levitan E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11597-11602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), this interaction may contribute to the polarized surface distribution exhibited by many Kv1 channels. Although several PSD-95-binding motifs begin with a glutamate residue, such as Kv1.4 (ETDV) and Kv1.5 (ETDL), several Kv1 channels (e.g.Kv1.1, Kv1.2, and Kv1.3) associate with PSD-95 through an alternate binding motif in which the glutamate residue is replaced by a hydrophobic amino acid (17Fujita A. Kurachi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 269: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Kv4.2 has a C-terminal Val-Ser-Ala-Leu (VSAL) that is very similar to the hydrophobic amino acid (T/S)XV motif; thus, we asked whether Kv4.2 associates with PSD-95 and whether VSAL represents a binding motif. We show, through co-immunoprecipitation and mutational analysis, that Kv4.2 protein does bind to PSD-95 in a heterologous expression system and that this interaction requires the VSAL motif. The interaction had physiological consequences for both Kv4.2 and PSD-95 protein distributions. PSD-95 increased the surface expression of Kv4.2 protein and caused it to cluster, as shown by deconvolution microscopy and biotinylation assays, and these effects required both the VSAL motif in Kv4.2 and the palmitoylation motif in PSD-95. Conversely, interaction with Kv4.2 increased the surface expression of PSD-95. Thus, by affecting the amount and location of channel protein, the PSD-95 interaction with Kv4.2 could affect the integrated electrophysiological properties of neurons. Myc-tagged PSD-95 in the expression vector, pGW1-CMV, was a generous gift from Dr. Morgan Sheng (Harvard University, Boston, MA). C3,5S-PSD-95, the palmitoylation-deficient PSD-95 mutant in which the cysteine residues at positions 3 and 5 are replaced by serine residues, was described previously (15Jugloff D.G. Khanna R. Schlichter L.C. Jones O.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1357-1364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by ACGT Inc. (Toronto, Ontario, Canada). All chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. Kv4.2 constructs in mammalian expression vectors were prepared using PCR with first-strand cDNA synthesized from rat hippocampus as template (Fast Track, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). We first PCR-amplified a FLAG-tagged, wild-type cDNA (which we call Kv4.2) that included residues 1–630 (18Baldwin T.J. Tsaur M.L. Lopez G.A. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1991; 7: 471-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), using the primers 5′ ATGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGGCAGCCGGTGTTGCAGCATGG 3′ (forward; also encodes the FLAG epitope after the start codon) and 5′ TTACAAAGCAGACACCCTGAC 3′ (reverse). This was ligated into the multiple cloning site of pCRII (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and then excised with NsiI/XhoI for ligation into the PstI/XhoI sites of pSVK3 (Amersham Biosciences) and pBK-CMV (Stratagene). Expression of Kv4.2 in pBK-CMV was examined by immunoblotting. Then, to facilitate studies of channel localization using fluorescence microscopy, an N-terminal fusion of the wild-type Kv4.2 construct to enhanced cyan fluorescent protein, ECFP (C-Kv4.2), was prepared by excising the coding sequence from the pSKV3 clone with EagI and ligating it into the Bsp120 I site of pECFP–C1 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). By using C-Kv4.2 cDNA as the template, a Kv4.2 deletion mutant lacking the four C-terminal amino acids (VSAL) was prepared by Pfu(Stratagene) PCR using the primers 5′ TTTGAATTCTATGGCAGCCGGTGTTGCAGCATGG 3′ (forward, encodes an EcoRI site before the start codon) and 5′ TTTGGGCCCTTTTTACCTGACGATGTTTCCTCC 3′ (reverse, encodes an ApaI site after the stop codon). This cDNA was ligated into the EcoRI and ApaI sites of pcDNA3.1 or pECFP–C1 to produce the Kv4.2 deletion mutant (Kv4.2ΔVSAL) and the ECFP-tagged Kv4.2 deletion mutant (C-Kv4.2ΔVSAL). For patch clamp analysis, we used a full-length Kv4.2 clone in pBiG (CLONTECH) containing a Kozak consensus sequence before the start codon (generously provided by Dr. P. Backx, University of Toronto). From this clone, a Kv4.2 mutant lacking the VSAL motif was generated with Pfu PCR, using the forward primer 5′ TTTGAATTCTCCGCCATGGCAGCCGGTG 3′ (encodes an EcoRI site and Kozak consensus sequence before the start codon), and the same reverse primer was used to create the deletion mutant (above). The identities of all constructs used were verified through dideoxy sequencing (York University Sequencing Facility, and the University Health Network Research DNA Sequencing Facility, Toronto, Ontario, Canada). We used three cell lines for heterologous expression. HEK293T cells were formerly called tsA201 and are HEK293 cells that constitutively express the SV40 large T antigen to allow plasmid replication using the SV40 origin. Although they are apparently the same cells, we will follow the nomenclature used by the laboratories from which we obtained them. HEK293T cells (from Dr. D. Papazian, UCLA, CA) were maintained and transfected as described previously (19Khanna R. Myers M.P. Laine M. Papazian D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34028-34034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), but using only 0.5 μg of total DNA. This low amount of DNA was transfected because HEK293T cells were used for indirect immunofluorescence, and it was easier to discern surface versus subcellular staining when less protein was expressed. tsA201 cells (from Dr. P. Backx) were mainly used for biochemical studies, where it was advantageous to increase the amount of protein expressed. They were grown at 37 °C, 95% O2, 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified essential medium (University Health Network Sera and Media Services, Toronto) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 μg/ml penicillin, and 10 units/ml streptomycin (all supplements obtained from Invitrogen). The tsA201 cells were seeded at 4.5 × 105 cells/cm2 and then transfected the next day with 2.5–10 μg of total DNA, using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (20Kingston R.E. Chen C.A. Okayama H. Rose J.K. Ausubel F.M. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., Boston2001: 9.1.4-9.1.11Google Scholar). For fluorescence imaging, the cells were replated the following day on collagen- and poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips and used 36–48 h after transfection. For heterologous expression for electrophysiology experiments, we used CHO cells, which were maintained as described previously (21Khanna R. Chang M.C. Joiner W.J. Kaczmarek L.K. Schlichter L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14838-14849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). CHO cells were seeded at 2.07 × 105 cells/cm2and then transfected on the following day with 2 μg of total DNA plus 0.2 μg of pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH) using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The cells were replated the day after transfection on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips, and EGFP-positive cells were patch clamped 36–48 h after transfection, as described below. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings (15Jugloff D.G. Khanna R. Schlichter L.C. Jones O.T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 31598-31603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) were used to assess the functional expression of Kv4.2 (with Kozak sequence), Kv4.2ΔVSAL (with Kozak sequence), and C-Kv4.2 (ECFP-tagged) in transfected CHO cells. The pipette solution (300–310 mosm) contained (in mm) 140 KCl, 5 EGTA (potassium salt), 4 MgATP, 1 MgCl2, and 10 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.2 with KOH. The bath solution (310–320 mosm) contained 140 NaCl, 10 glucose, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, and 10 HEPES, adjusted with NaOH to pH 7.4. All recordings were made at room temperature. tsA201 cells were co-transfected with Myc-tagged PSD-95 and one of the Kv4.2 channel constructs, so that we could immunoprecipitate PSD-95-containing complexes from these cells with an antibody directed against Myc. The Kv4.2 antibody was not effective for immunoprecipitation; thus, the reverse experiment could not be done. The cells were lysed with 500 μl of Nonidet P-40 co-IP buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mmTris, pH 8.5, and 1 mm EDTA) supplemented with protease inhibitors (0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μm pepstatin A). The lysates were incubated with co-IP buffer for 20 min on ice and then clarified by centrifugation, and a small aliquot was reserved for direct immunoblotting. The remaining sample was pre-cleared by a 3-h incubation with protein A/G-agarose (Oncogene Science, Cambridge, MA), which was also used to capture antibody-protein complexes. The immunoprecipitates were boiled in 2× SDS gel-loading buffer prior to SDS-PAGE. A polyclonal antibody was prepared against a peptide (Vetrogen, London, Ontario, Canada) corresponding with residues 23–43 of Kv4.2 (GenBankTMaccession number S64320) with an additional C-terminal cysteine for coupling to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce). After confirming the identity of the peptide by amino acid analysis and mass spectroscopy, and cross-linking it to keyhole limpet hemocyanin with m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide ester (Pierce), the conjugated peptide was purified by dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and injected into New Zealand White rabbits (Division of Comparative Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada). Next, antisera were collected from the immunized rabbits and the IgG fraction enriched by protein A affinity chromatography (MAPS kit, Bio-Rad). This antibody has been extensively used to detect Kv4.2 in immunoblots of heart tissue (23Wickenden A.D. Jegla T.J. Kaprielian R. Backx P.H. Am. J.

Protein samples were prepared, electrophoresed, and transferred to nitrocellulose as described previously (26Jones O.T. Bernstein G.M. Jones E.J. Jugloff D.G. Law M. Wong W. Mills L.R. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6152-6164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The nitrocellulose membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the Kv4.2 polyclonal antibody at 1:1000. Immunoreactivity was detected by incubating the membrane with goat anti-rabbit conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Cedarlane Laboratories, Hornby, Ontario, Canada; 1:4000), followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). Quantification was done with a GS-670 imaging densitometer and Molecular Analyst 1.1 (Bio-Rad). Kv4.2 contains two putative extracellular lysine residues (18Baldwin T.J. Tsaur M.L. Lopez G.A. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1991; 7: 471-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar); thus, surface and intracellular channel protein can be differentiated using cell-impermeant biotinylating reagents that target lysine residues. Before transfection, tsA201 cells were plated on poly-l-lysine-treated (Sigma) 6-well plates. Biotinylation of cell-surface proteins was performed essentially as described previously (27Roquemore E.P. Banting G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2125-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), except that cells were biotinylated with 1.5 mg of sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin per 35-mm well (Pierce). Biotinylated cell membranes were incubated in 50 μl of SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mmEDTA) for 10 min at 65 °C. The cell extracts were then diluted with 4 volumes of Triton lysis buffer (1% Triton, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA) and incubated for a further 60 min on ice before pelleting insoluble materials. Biotinylated proteins were isolated and immunoblotted as described previously (28Kuryshev Y.A. Wible B.A. Gudz T.I. Ramirez A.N. Brown A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C290-C299Crossref Google Scholar), except that Neutravidin Ultralink (Pierce) was used to affinity purify the biotinylated proteins. To assess Kv4.2 protein localization and clustering, live tsA201 cells were washed with Dulbecco's PBS (139 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8.8 mmNa2HPO4, 1.48 mmKH2PO4) and mounted on glass slides. Cells were imaged using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 Imaging microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY) equipped with a digital camera (Zeiss AxioCam) and a 100× oil-immersion objective. Image stacks spanning the full z axis of the cell (with images spaced 200 nm apart) or spanning 0.5−2 μm (with images spaced 25 nm apart) were collected for each transfection condition. All z image stacks were deconvolved in AxioVision 4.0 (Carl Zeiss, Inc.) using the constrained iterative algorithm. Localization of Kv4.2 and PSD-95 proteins was assessed by indirect immunofluorescent detection of ECFP-tagged channels and Myc-tagged PSD-95 (29Hsueh Y.P. Sheng M. J. Biol.

Nonspecific binding was blocked with 3% heat-inactivated goat serum and 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Cells were then incubated with 1:2000 anti-GFP (Molecular Probes) (to detect ECFP-tagged channels) and/or 1:200 anti-Myc (to detect the tagged PSD-95) for 1 h at room temperature. This was followed by a 1-h incubation at room temperature with goat anti-rabbit conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (1:1000) and goat anti-mouse conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 (1:200) in 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS. The coverslips were mounted in Slowfade (Molecular Probes) and imaged as above. Images were overlaid in AxioVision 4.0. Student's t test was used to analyze electrophysiological and immunoblotting data. Percentages (from the biotinylation cell surface assay) were subjected to arcsin transformation to produce data with a normal distribution (30Zar J.H. Biostatistical Analysis.

Because tsA201 cells express an endogenous potassium current (31Zhu G. Zhang Y., Xu, H. Jiang C. J. Neurosci.

However, within 48 h after Kv4.2 cDNA was transiently transfected, K+currents appeared (Fig. 1 B), which were large, depolarization-activated, rapidly inactivating and similar to previously described (32Petersen K.R. Nerbonne J.M. Pfluegers Arch. 1999; 437: 381-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 33Bahring R. Boland L.M. Varghese A. Gebauer M. Pongs O. J. Physiol.

As demonstrated previously (34Jerng H.H. Covarrubias M. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 163-174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 35Nakamura T.Y. Pountney D.J. Ozaita A. Nandi S.

Cells co-transfected with Kv4.2 and PSD-95 produced currents with similar characteristics to cells expressing Kv4.2 alone (data not shown), with a comparable range of current densities (21–81 pA/pF, n = 7;p > 0.5). PSD-95 did not alter the inactivation kinetics (τfast = 19.2 ± 3.1 ms at +60 mV,p > 0.5; τslow = 296 ± 104 ms at +60 mV, p > 0.2) or the contribution of the fast component to inactivation (81 ± 2%, p > 0.2).Figure 1Heterologously expressed Kv4.2 forms functional channels. K+ currents in CHO cells were elicited by voltage clamp steps delivered at 10-mV increments from a holding potential of −70 mV (A, inset). Each voltage step was 300 ms long, with an inter-pulse interval of 20 s to allow recovery from inactivation. Representative traces are from mock-transfected cells (A), or cells transfected with Kv4.2 (with Kozak sequence) (B), Kv4.2ΔVSAL (with Kozak sequence) (C), or C-Kv4.2 (D). Kv4.2 and C-Kv4.2 are full-length and contain the VSAL motif but differ in the presence of an N-terminal ECFP tag on C-Kv4.2. This tag was added to assist in localizing Kv4.2 channels in living cells (see Fig. 5). Kv4.2ΔVSAL lacks the last four amino acids at the C terminus. The inset to B shows a Kv4.2-expressing cell before (pre-treatment) and 10 min after perfusing the bath with 20 μmquinidine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cells transfected with Kv4.2ΔVSAL expressed a current that resembled the wild-type current (Fig. 1 C) with a current density range of 4–56 pA/pF (n = 4), indicating that Kv4.2 channels lacking the C-terminal VSAL motif form functional channels on the cell surface. Deletion of the VSAL motif did not alter the time constants of inactivation (τfast = 24.0 ± 2.6 ms at +60 mV,p > 0.2; τslow = 441 ± 145 ms at +60 mV, p > 0.5) or the contribution of the fast component of inactivation (81 ± 9%; p > 0.5). Transfection of C-Kv4.2 (ECFP-tagged) into CHO cells produced K+ currents (Fig. 1 D) ranging from 6 to 90 pA/pF (n = 4); thus, adding the ECFP tag to the N terminus of Kv4.2 does not prevent formation of functional channels. One clear difference was that ECFP-tagged Kv4.2 inactivated more slowly than Kv4.2 current: only one inactivation time constant could be fit (τ = 224 ± 35 ms at +60 mV). This effect of ECFP is not surprising because the fast component of inactivation of Shal family K+ channels involves concerted actions of the N- and C-terminal domains (34Jerng H.H. Covarrubias M. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 163-174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), interactions that could be impeded by a bulky N-terminal tag. Similarly two proteins (KChIP and frequenin) were recently shown to bind to the N terminus of Kv4.2 and enhance the slow component of inactivation (35Nakamura T.Y. Pountney D.J. Ozaita A. Nandi S.

Kv4.2 channels are blocked by quinidine, which reduces the peak current and accelerates the apparent inactivation rate (37Yeola S.W. Snyders D.J. Cardiovasc. Res. 1997; 33: 540-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). An application of 20 μm quinidine reduced the peak Kv4.2 current from 1200 to 295 pA at +60 mV (75% reduction) and reduced the fast time constant of inactivation to 4.6 ms (Fig. 1 B, inset). The polyclonal anti-Kv4.2 antibody we made has been used in other studies (23Wickenden A.D. Jegla T.J. Kaprielian R. Backx P.H. Am. J.

The antibody recognized a single ∼70-kDa band in tsA201 cells that were transfected with the full-length channel (Fig. 2 A, lane 5). The size is consistent with both the predicted (71 kDa) and previously observed molecular weight of Kv4.2 (18Baldwin T.J. Tsaur M.L. Lopez G.A. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1991; 7: 471-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 36An W.F. Bowlby M.R. Betty M. Cao J. Ling H.P. Mendoza G. Hinson J.W. Mattsson K.I. Strassle B.W. Trimmer J.S.

Further evidence for antibody specificity is the lack of immunoreactive bands in lysates from mock-transfected cells or from cells expressing vector alone (lanes 1–4), which also means that the endogenous K+ channel (mentioned above) is not Kv4.2. Pre-incubating the antibody with the antigenic peptide eliminated all immunoreactive bands (lanes 9–12). We created several cDNA constru"
https://openalex.org/W2056079599,"Cell specialization is often governed by the spatial distribution of ion channels and receptors on the cell surface. So far, little is known about functional ion channel localization. This is due to a lack of satisfactory methods for investigating ion channels in an intact cell and simultaneously determining the channels' positions accurately. We have developed a novel high-resolution scanning patch-clamp technique that enables the study of ion channels, not only in small cells, such as sperm, but in submicrometer cellular structures, such as epithelial microvilli, fine neuronal dendrites, and, particularly, T-tubule openings of cardiac myocytes. In cardiac myocytes, as in most excitable cells, action potential propagation depends essentially on the properties of ion channels that are functionally and spatially coupled. We found that the L-type calcium and chloride channels are distributed and colocalized in the region of T-tubule openings, but not in other regions of the myocyte. In addition, chloride channels were found in narrowly defined regions of Z-grooves. This finding suggests a new synergism between these types of channels that may be relevant for action potential propagation along the T-tubule system and excitation-contraction coupling."
https://openalex.org/W2080958662,"Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-5 (IGFBP-5) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) are produced by human intestinal smooth muscle cells. Endogenous IGF-I stimulates growth and increases IGFBP-5 secretion. IGFBP-5 augments the effects of IGF-I by facilitating interaction of IGF-I with the IGF-I receptor tyrosine kinase. Andress (Andress, D. L. (1998) Am. J. Physiol. 274, E744–E750) and Berfield et al. (Berfield, A. K., Andress, D. L., and Abrass, C. K. (2000) Kidney Int. 57, 1991–2003) have shown that in osteoblasts and kidney mesangial cells, IGFBP-5 stimulates proliferation and filopodia formation independently of IGF-I, presumably by activating a distinct IGFBP-5 receptor serine kinase. The present study determined whether IGFBP-5 exerts direct effects on growth in human intestinal smooth muscle cells and identified the intracellular signaling pathways involved. IGFBP-5 caused a concentration-dependent increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation and an increase in IGF-I secretion that occurred independently of IGF-I and the IGF-I receptor tyrosine kinase.

IGFBP-5-stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation and IGF-I secretion were partly inhibited by SB203580 or U1026 and abolished by the combination of the two inhibitors or by expression of Ras(S17N). These data show that IGFBP-5 stimulates growth and IGF-I secretion in human intestinal smooth muscle cells by activation of p38 MAP kinase-dependent and Erk1/2-dependent pathways that are independent of IGF-I. A positive feedback mechanism therefore links IGFBP-5 and IGF-I secretion that reinforces their individual effects on growth.

Baserga R. Lab. Invest. 1995; 73: 311-331PubMed Google Scholar); transformation and maintenance of the transformed state also require IGF-I receptor activation in some cells (2Valentinis B. Baserga R. J. Clin. Pathol.: Mol. Pathol. 2001; 54: 133-137Crossref Scopus (296) Google Scholar); and IGF-I protects cells from apoptosis (3Parrizas M. Saltiel A.R. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 154-161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). The central role of IGF-I in the regulation of smooth muscle cell growth in both the normal and pathologic states is manifested by the hyperplasia of intestinal and vascular smooth muscle in transgenic animals overexpressing a human IGF-I cDNA (4Ohneda K. Ulshen M.H. Fuller C.R. D'Ercole A.J. Lund P.K. Gastroenterology. 1997; 112: 444-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 5Wang J. Niu W. Nikiforov Y. Naito S. Chernausek S. Witte D. LeRoith D. Strauch A. Fagin J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1425-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The effects of IGF-I are modulated by IGF-binding proteins. Six IGF-binding proteins (IGFBP-1–6) have been identified that can either augment the effects of IGF-I by facilitating the interaction of IGF-I with its cognate receptor or inhibit the effects of IGF-I by diminishing the interaction of IGF-I with its receptor (6Kelley K.M., Oh, Y. Gargosky S.E. Gucev Z. Matsumoto T. Hwa V., Ng, L. Simpson D.M. Rosenfeld R.G. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 28: 619-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). The presence and effect of each IGF binding protein, however, is both tissue- and species-specific.IGFBP-1, IGFBP-3, and IGFBP-5 indirectly influence cell growth by modulating the interaction of IGF-I with the IGF-I receptor and also directly influence cell growth by interacting with distinct cell surface receptors. IGFBP-1 interacts with the α5β1 integrin receptor expressed by placental cells and Chinese hamster ovary cells (7Jones J.I. Gockerman A. Busby W.H., Jr. Wright G. Clemmons D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10553-10557Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). IGFBP-3 interacts with the Type V TGF-β receptor expressed in T47D breast cancer cells and mink lung epithelial cells (8Fanayan S. Firth S.M. Butt A.J. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39146-39151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Recently, an IGFBP-5-specific receptor has been characterized in mouse osteoblasts and rat kidney mesangial cells (9Andress D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28289-28296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IGFBP-5 binds with high affinity to this ∼420-kDa membrane-bound receptor protein and elicits autophosphorylation of serine residues (10Andress D.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: E744-E750PubMed Google Scholar). One intracellular signaling pathway coupled to this receptor is the small G-protein, Cdc42, through which IGFBP-5-dependent mesangial cell filopodia formation is mediated (11Berfield A.K. Andress D.L. Abrass C.K. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 1991-2003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).Human intestinal smooth muscle cells produce IGF-I, and three IGF-binding proteins, IGFBP-3, IGFGBP-4 and IGFBP-5, each of which plays an autocrine role in the regulation of growth in human intestinal muscle cells (12Kuemmerle J.F. Teng B. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G975-G982PubMed Google Scholar, 13Bushman T.L. Kuemmerle J.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G1282-G1290PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of IGF-I to the IGF-I receptor tyrosine kinase activates distinct PI3-kinase-dependent and Erk1/2-dependent pathways that stimulate both proliferation and IGFBP-5 production (13Bushman T.L. Kuemmerle J.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G1282-G1290PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kuemmerle J.F. Bushman T.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G151-G158PubMed Google Scholar). IGF-I-dependent stimulation of growth in these cells is inhibited by the indirect actions of IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-4 and is augmented by the indirect actions of IGFBP-5 (12Kuemmerle J.F. Teng B. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G975-G982PubMed Google Scholar, 13Bushman T.L. Kuemmerle J.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G1282-G1290PubMed Google Scholar). IGF-I and IGFBP-5 expression is increased within the intestinal muscle layer in regions of active inflammation and stricturing in Crohn's disease and in models of experimental enterocolitis (15Zeeh J.M. Riley N.E. Hoffmann P. Reinshagen M. Goebell H. Gerken G. Eur. J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2001; 13: 851-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 16Zimmermann E.M., Li, L. Hou Y.T. Mohapatra N.K. Pucilowska J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: G1022-G1029Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is not known whether an IGFBP-5-specific receptor is expressed by human intestinal muscle cells or what role this receptor plays in the regulation of growth.This study shows that an IGFBP-5 receptor is present in human intestinal smooth muscle cells. Binding of IGFBP-5 to its cognate receptor activates both the p38 MAP kinase and Erk1/2 signaling cascades. Activation of these pathways by IGFBP-5 mediates jointly stimulation of growth and secretion of IGF-I. Thus, dual stimulatory pathways link IGF-I and IGFBP-5 secretion, reinforcing their individual abilities to stimulate growth of human intestinal muscle cells.DISCUSSIONThe present study provides the first evidence that IGFBP-5 has direct, IGF-I receptor-independent effects in normal human intestinal smooth muscle cells. The results show that in human intestinal smooth muscle cells, IGFBP-5 acting independently of the IGF-I receptor causes Ras-dependent activation of both p38 MAP kinase and Erk1/2, which jointly stimulate both muscle cell proliferation and IGF-I secretion. One explanation for the IGF-I-independent effects of IGFBP-5 on growth was provided by Andress and colleagues (9Andress D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28289-28296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Berfield A.K. Andress D.L. Abrass C.K. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 1991-2003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) whose work suggested first in murine bone cells and later in rat glomerular mesangial cells the presence of an ∼420-kDa IGFBP-5-specific receptor. In cultured neonatal mouse osteoblasts, the receptor undergoes autophosphorylation on serine residues in response to IGFBP-5 (10Andress D.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: E744-E750PubMed Google Scholar). In rat glomerular mesangial cells, IGFBP-5 mediates Cdc42-dependent reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and formation of filopodia (11Berfield A.K. Andress D.L. Abrass C.K. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 1991-2003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The evidence supporting the operation of IGFBP-5-dependent, IGF-I-independent effects in human intestinal smooth muscle cells can be summarized as follows. 1) Incubation of muscle cells with IGFBP-5 causes time- and concentration-dependent activation of both the p38 MAP kinase and the Erk1/2 signaling pathways. 2) Incubation of muscle cells with IGFBP-5 causes concentration-dependent stimulation of proliferation. 3) Incubation of muscle cells with IGFBP-5 does not elicit activation of PI3-kinase as would occur if IGF-I/IGF-I receptor activation were involved (14Kuemmerle J.F. Bushman T.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G151-G158PubMed Google Scholar). 4) Incubation of muscle cells with IGFBP-5 causes a p38 MAP kinase- and Erk1/2-dependent increase in IGF-I secretion. 5) In the presence of the IGF-I receptor antagonist, IGFBP-5 does not elicit IGF-I receptor phosphorylation.IGFBP-5 has been shown to stimulate [3H]thymidine incorporation in osteoblast and bone cells independently of IGF-I and the IGF-I receptor (27Andress D.L. Loop S.M. Zapf J. Kiefer M.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The mechanisms mediating the direct, proliferative effects of IGFBP-5 were not delineated. On the basis of the current study and previous work, two potential mechanisms have been identified. The first involves a membrane-bound, IGFBP-5-specific receptor first characterized by Andress in osteoblast cells (9Andress D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28289-28296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Andress D.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: E744-E750PubMed Google Scholar, 11Berfield A.K. Andress D.L. Abrass C.K. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 1991-2003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and the second involves nuclear transport of IGFBP-5 and direct nuclear effects mediated in the fashion of a ligand-dependent transcription factor. The latter mechanisms was identified in T47D breast cancer cells by Schedlich and colleagues (28Schedlich L.J., Le Page S.L. Firth S.M. Briggs L.J. Jans D.A. Baxter R.C. J. Biol.

The carboxyl terminus of IGFBP-5 (and IGFBP-3, which also possesses IGF-I-independent effects (30Cohen P. Lamson G. Okajima T. Rosenfeld R.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 380-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 31Oh Y. Muller H.L. Lamson G. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Biol.

This sequence has been shown to be required for the importin-β-dependent nuclear translocation of both IGFBP-5 and IGFBP-3 (8Fanayan S. Firth S.M. Butt A.J. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39146-39151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 29Schedlich L.J. Young T.F. Firth S.M. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18347-18352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Although this portion of IGFBP-5 also has been shown to participate in binding to the IGFBP-5 receptor, deletional studies have demonstrated that this sequence of the IGFBP-5 peptide is not required for activation of its cell surface receptor (27Andress D.L. Loop S.M. Zapf J. Kiefer M.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Nuclear transport of IGFBP-5 was not specifically addressed in the current study; however, the ability of the p38 and MKK1/2 inhibitors in combination to abolish both proliferation and IGF-I secretion in response to IGFBP-5 suggests that if nuclear transport of IGFBP-5 does occur in these cells, it is not required for IGFBP-5-stimulated proliferation or IGF-I secretion.The intracellular signaling cascades coupled to activation of the IGFBP-5 receptor are largely unknown but appear to begin following the autophosphorylation of serine residues of the receptor (10Andress D.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: E744-E750PubMed Google Scholar). In rat glomerular mesangial cells, activation of the IGFBP-5 receptor results in Cdc42-GTPase-activating protein aggregation, reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, and filopodia formation (11Berfield A.K. Andress D.L. Abrass C.K. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 1991-2003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Whether this signaling pathway is involved in the proliferative responses to IGFBP-5 is unknown. Growth factors utilize distinct small GTPases to mediate specific cytoskeletal reorganizations such as lamellipodium formation (mediated via Rac), stress fiber formation (mediated via Rho), or filopodia formation (mediated via Cdc42). The small G-proteins Rho and Cdc42 are expressed by intestinal smooth muscle cells and mediate neurotransmitter-induced contraction (32Murthy K.S. Zhou H. Grider J.R. Makhlouf G.M. Gastroenterology. 2001; 120: A201Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). In human intestinal smooth muscle and other muscle cell types, the proliferative effects of IGFBP-5 are mediated by the activation of distinct Raf-Erk1/2 and p38 MAP kinase pathways. In COS-7 and HeLa cells, the small GTPases Rac, Rho, and Cdc42 are requisite cofactors in Ras-dependent Raf activation and subsequent activation of Erk1/2 (33Li W. Chong H. Guan K.L. J. Biol.

These monomeric G-proteins have also been shown to play a role in the activation of MKK3/6 leading to p38 MAP kinase activation (36Lee S.H. Eom M. Lee S.J. Kim S. Park H.J. Park D. J. Biol.

It remains to be determined whether IGFBP-5-induced growth mediated by the Raf-Erk1/2 or p38 MAP kinase pathways involves the participation of the GTPases Rho, Rac, and Cdc42.Based on our previous work and the results of this current study we propose the following model whereby a positive feedback mechanism links IGF-I and IGFBP-5 (Fig 11). IGF-I, acting via its cognate receptor and facilitated by the presence of IGFBP-5, activates the PI3-kinase and Erk1/2 pathways that jointly mediate increased proliferation and secretion of IGFBP-5 (14Kuemmerle J.F. Bushman T.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G151-G158PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kuemmerle J.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: G710-G717PubMed Google Scholar). IGFBP-5, in turn, acting via its cognate receptor, activates the p38 MAP kinase and Erk1/2 pathways that jointly mediate increased proliferation and further secretion of IGF-I.The concomitant presence of IGF-I and IGFBP-5 and the resultant interplay between their signaling pathways may be important factors in mediating their individual effects. We and others (13Bushman T.L. Kuemmerle J.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G1282-G1290PubMed Google Scholar, 38Hou Y.T. Xin X.P., Li, L. Zimmerman E.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 422-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) have shown that IGFBP-5 protein levels are highly sensitive to protein synthesis inhibitors. Inhibition of RNA stabilizing factor translation by inhibitors such as cycloheximide leads to rapid IGFBP-5 mRNA degradation and results in IGFBP-5 levels falling rapidly to undetectable levels. The 3′-untranslated region of IGFBP-5 mRNA contains several adenosine-uridine-rich elements (38Hou Y.T. Xin X.P., Li, L. Zimmerman E.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 422-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), which confer instability to IGFBP-5 mRNA but can be stabilized by binding cytoplasmic proteins. Hou and colleagues (38Hou Y.T. Xin X.P., Li, L. Zimmerman E.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 422-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) have suggested that IGF-I might stimulate the production of AU-binding proteins that stabilize IGFBP-5 mRNA. In NIH 3T3 cells, the regulation of mRNA abundance is a dynamic process in which stabilizing and destabilizing AU-binding proteins compete (39Ming X.F. Stoecklin G., Lu, M. Looser R. Moroni C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5778-5789Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In these cells, PI3-kinase and p38 MAP kinase function by activating pathway specific stabilizing AU-binding proteins that regulate interleukin-3 mRNA levels (39Ming X.F. Stoecklin G., Lu, M. Looser R. Moroni C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5778-5789Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that in human intestinal muscle cells, IGF-I increases IGFBP-5 levels via Erk1/2-dependent and PI3-kinase-dependent mechanisms (17Kuemmerle J.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: G710-G717PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesize that the ability of IGF-I to increase IGFBP-5 mRNA levels in human intestinal muscle cells might reflect in part the ability of IGF-I-activated signaling intermediates, such as PI3-kinase, to act as stabilizing kinases for IGFBP-5 mRNA.The results of this study show that IGFBP-5 stimulates the secretion of IGF-I in intestinal muscle cells by activation of distinct p38 MAP kinase-dependent and Erk1/2-dependent pathways. The IGF-I gene has two alternative first exons that are spliced to a common block of exons that contain the mature peptide-containing sequence. In most tissues, IGF-I gene expression is regulated through activation of exon 1 (40Wang X. Yang Y. Adamo M.L. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1528-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Several potential regulators of IGF-I gene transcription are known to be downstream targets for p38 MAP kinase including members of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) and ATF/CREB family; downstream targets of Erk1/2 also include members of the ATF/CREB family and the AP-1 family (40Wang X.

The specific transcriptional regulators of the IGF-I gene in human intestinal smooth muscle remain to be determined.The positive feedback loop linking IGFBP-5 and IGF-I secretion may have clinical importance in the setting of intestinal inflammation,e.g. Crohn's disease. The presence of increased IGF-I and IGFBP-5 expression by intestinal smooth muscle cells in animal models of enterocolitis has been appreciated for a number of years (15Zeeh J.M. Riley N.E. Hoffmann P. Reinshagen M. Goebell H. Gerken G. Eur. J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2001; 13: 851-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and this observation has recently been extended to include Crohn's disease in humans (16Zimmermann E.M., Li, L. Hou Y.T. Mohapatra N.K. Pucilowska J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: G1022-G1029Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of both IGF-I and IGFBP-5 is increased in parallel in regions of active inflammation and stricture formation. In addition to muscle proliferation induced by IGFBP-5 and IGF-I, IGFBP-5 also stimulates collagen secretion (44Zimmermann E.M., Li, L. Hou Y.T. Cannon M. Christman G.M. Bitar K.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G875-G882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanisms responsible for initiating this response have yet to be fully elucidated, but the resulting muscle hyperplasia and extracellular matrix production may be responsible, in part, for luminal narrowing and stricture formation in the intestine.In summary, the present paper shows that IGFBP-5 exerts direct, IGF-I-receptor-independent effects in human intestinal smooth muscle cells. By jointly activating p38 MAP kinase and Erk1/2, IGFBP-5 stimulates both muscle cell proliferation and IGF-I secretion. A positive feedback mechanism linking IGFBP-5 and IGF-I secretion in these cells reinforces their individual ability to cause intestinal smooth muscle cell growth.

Baserga R. Lab. Invest. 1995; 73: 311-331PubMed Google Scholar); transformation and maintenance of the transformed state also require IGF-I receptor activation in some cells (2Valentinis B. Baserga R. J. Clin. Pathol.: Mol. Pathol. 2001; 54: 133-137Crossref Scopus (296) Google Scholar); and IGF-I protects cells from apoptosis (3Parrizas M. Saltiel A.R. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 154-161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). The central role of IGF-I in the regulation of smooth muscle cell growth in both the normal and pathologic states is manifested by the hyperplasia of intestinal and vascular smooth muscle in transgenic animals overexpressing a human IGF-I cDNA (4Ohneda K. Ulshen M.H. Fuller C.R. D'Ercole A.J. Lund P.K. Gastroenterology. 1997; 112: 444-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 5Wang J. Niu W. Nikiforov Y. Naito S.

Six IGF-binding proteins (IGFBP-1–6) have been identified that can either augment the effects of IGF-I by facilitating the interaction of IGF-I with its cognate receptor or inhibit the effects of IGF-I by diminishing the interaction of IGF-I with its receptor (6Kelley K.M., Oh, Y.

IGFBP-1 interacts with the α5β1 integrin receptor expressed by placental cells and Chinese hamster ovary cells (7Jones J.I. Gockerman A. Busby W.H., Jr. Wright G. Clemmons D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10553-10557Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). IGFBP-3 interacts with the Type V TGF-β receptor expressed in T47D breast cancer cells and mink lung epithelial cells (8Fanayan S. Firth S.M. Butt A.J. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39146-39151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Recently, an IGFBP-5-specific receptor has been characterized in mouse osteoblasts and rat kidney mesangial cells (9Andress D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28289-28296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IGFBP-5 binds with high affinity to this ∼420-kDa membrane-bound receptor protein and elicits autophosphorylation of serine residues (10Andress D.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: E744-E750PubMed Google Scholar). One intracellular signaling pathway coupled to this receptor is the small G-protein, Cdc42, through which IGFBP-5-dependent mesangial cell filopodia formation is mediated (11Berfield A.K. Andress D.L. Abrass C.K. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 1991-2003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Human intestinal smooth muscle cells produce IGF-I, and three IGF-binding proteins, IGFBP-3, IGFGBP-4 and IGFBP-5, each of which plays an autocrine role in the regulation of growth in human intestinal muscle cells (12Kuemmerle J.F. Teng B. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G975-G982PubMed Google Scholar, 13Bushman T.L. Kuemmerle J.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G1282-G1290PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of IGF-I to the IGF-I receptor tyrosine kinase activates distinct PI3-kinase-dependent and Erk1/2-dependent pathways that stimulate both proliferation and IGFBP-5 production (13Bushman T.L. Kuemmerle J.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G1282-G1290PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kuemmerle J.F. Bushman T.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G151-G158PubMed Google Scholar). IGF-I-dependent stimulation of growth in these cells is inhibited by the indirect actions of IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-4 and is augmented by the indirect actions of IGFBP-5 (12Kuemmerle J.F. Teng B. Am. J.

https://openalex.org/W2105328021,"Preeclampsia (PE) is a leading cause of maternal hypertension in pregnancy, fetal growth restriction, premature birth, and fetal and maternal mortality (1). Activation and dysfunction of the maternal and fetal endothelium in PE may be the consequence of increased oxidative stress associated with circulating lipid peroxides (2-4), and in cases of severe maternal hypertension, uterine and umbilical artery waveforms are abnormal (5). We have investigated PE-associated abnormalities in the regulation of intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) production (index of nitric oxide [NO]) in human fetal umbilical vein endothelial cells. Basal [Ca2+]i was slightly elevated in PE cells, whereas agonist-stimulated Ca2+ entry was reduced in cells from PE compared with normal term or age-matched preterm pregnancies. Furthermore, PE cells exhibited a decreased permeability to Ba2+ but an increased permeability to Mn2+ and Gd3+, suggesting that PE is associated with phenotypic alterations in fetal endothelial cation channel(s). Basal and histamine-stimulated cGMP levels were elevated in PE compared with preterm or normal cells, implying an increased NO production in PE. However, immunoblots for endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) revealed reduced eNOS expression in PE and preterm cells, with negligible changes in sGC levels. This study provides important and novel insights into abnormalities of fetal endothelial cells isolated from women with PE, reveal ing an altered cation membrane permeability and activity of eNOS-sGC pathway. As these changes are sustained in culture in vitro, this may reflect long-term ""programming"" of the fetal cardiovascular system."
https://openalex.org/W2147034491,"It is often assumed that bone mineral accretion should be optimized throughout childhood to maximize peak bone mass. In contrast, we hypothesized that bone mineral acquisition early in life would have little or no effect on adult bone mass because many areas of the juvenile skeleton are replaced in toto through skeletal growth. To test this hypothesis, we induced osteoporosis by administering dexamethasone to 5-week-old rabbits for 5 weeks and then allowed them to recover for 16 weeks. Tibial bone mineral density (ash weight/volume) was decreased in the dexamethasone-treated animals at the end of treatment but recovered completely. Bone structure in the femur was assessed by histomorphometry. Trabecular and cortical bone in the distal metaphysis was made osteoporotic by dexamethasone, but was then replaced through endochondral bone formation and recovered. Periosteal bone formation rate in the diaphysis was decreased during dexamethasone treatment but afterwards rebounded above controls and normalized cortical width. Our data suggest that bone mineral acquisition early in life has little effect on adult bone density because the juvenile bone is largely replaced through growth. If this concept generalizes, then interventions to maximize peak bone mass should be directed at adolescents rather than young children."

Administration of the two-chain 51-amino acid peptide hormone insulin is life sustaining for many of the 150 million diabetic patients in the world. Classical pancreatic extraction results in 10–15 mg of insulin per pancreas and the number of porcine or bovine pancreases to produce current requirements of insulin (in excess of 7 metric tons) is simply not available. Consequently, a substantial fraction of insulin is today produced by eukaryotic secretory expression in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Recently, second generation fast-acting genetically engineered insulin analogues have been engineered for improved diabetes therapy. This is exemplified by the clinically relevant fast-acting insulin, which features an amino acid substitution in position 28 of the B-chain from proline to aspartic acid and is used for treatment of diabetes mellitus (1Brange J. Ribel U. Hansen J.F. Dodson G. Hansen M.T. Havelund S. Melberg S.G. Norris F. Norris K. Snel L. Sørensen A.R. Voigt H.O. Nature. 1988; 333: 679-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar).

The A-chain is composed of a slightly extended A1 α-helix (C2–C3, A1–A9), a loop (A10–A13), and finally the A2 α-helix (A14–A20). Besides the classical phenol or m-cresol binding sites, one of the three dimers has two additional m-cresol molecules located in the monomer-monomer interface next to TyrB26 (Fig. 1). These two binding sites are essentially identical and composed by the hydrophobic residues TyrB26 and ValB12 from one monomer and LeuB15, TyrB16, CysB19, and PheB24 of the other monomer molecule (Fig. 1). It has been shown that folding stability is important for secretion efficiency (5Kjeldsen T. Balschmidt P. Diers I. Hach M. Kaarsholm N.C. Ludvigsen S. Biotechnol. Genet. Eng.

We hypothesized that the side chain of an aromatic amino acid localized in the mini-C-peptide will mimic the interactions provided by the m-cresol ligand shown in Fig. 1. Importantly, the interaction of this hydrophobic residue with the hydrophobic core of the molecule would be energetically favorable and presumably enhance the folding stability of the precursor. The precursor can be converted into the mature two-chain insulin aspart by in vitro enzymatic removal of the C-peptide, which restores full biological potential of the molecule. Introduction of an aromatic amino acid into the mini-C-peptide,e.g. EWK, did indeed increase the expression yield of the insulin aspart precursor (Table I). Tryptophan had the greatest positive influence (5-fold) on the expression yield, whereas phenylalanine and tyrosine increase the expression yield ∼3.5-fold (Table I). Mini-C-peptides with various amino acids in combination with the aromatic amino acid,e.g. LWK, enhanced the expression yield of the insulin aspart precursor (Table I). Interestingly, the position of the aromatic amino acid in the mini-C-peptide influenced the expression yield of the insulin aspart precursor. When the aromatic amino acid is in an N-terminal position to the lysine in the mini-C-peptide the secretion efficiency of the insulin aspart precursor is increased. Exchanging the sequence of the mini-C-peptide to WEK or shortening the mini-C-peptide to WK did not significantly increase the expression yield of the insulin aspart precursor. The significance of the position of tryptophan indicates that a specific molecular interaction mediates the increase in the secretion efficiency of the insulin aspart precursor.Table IYeast expression yield and folding stability of insulin precursorsInsulin precursor amino acid substitutionC-peptideRelative yieldCmidmAspB28AAK1.05.2AspB281.25.6AspB28EWK4.97.2AspB28EYK3.8NDAspB28EFK3.5NDAspB28LWK3.66.4GluB10, AspB28, HisA8, GluA145.37.0GluB10, AspB28, HisA8, GluA14EWK7.6>7.9The expression yield was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures” and normalized for comparison to the yield of the insulin aspart precursorAAK.

The insulin precursor comprising the first 29 amino acids of the insulin B-chain joined to the 21 amino acids of the insulin A-chain either by a C-peptide or directly as indicated and expressed in S. cerevisiae as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The effect of an aromatic acid in the mini-C-peptide (EWK) on the secretion of the insulin aspart precursor expressed in yeast was further investigated by pulse-chase analysis with a 2.5-min pulse with [35S]cysteine followed by 30 min of chase. The quantity of insulin aspart precursor with the EWK mini-C-peptide synthesized after the [35S]cysteine pulse is substantially larger than the quantity of precursor synthesized with the AAK mini-C-peptide (only the insulin aspart precursor is labeled) (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the quantity of the insulin aspart precursorEWK secreted to the culture supernatant after 30 min of chase was six times higher than with the AAK mini-C-peptide. Interestingly, a similar quantity of synthesized insulin aspart precursor was retained intracellularly in the vacuole independent of the mini-C-peptide. However, the insulin aspart precursorEWK was more efficiently secreted (Fig. 2). The secretion efficiency of the insulin aspart precursorEWK is illustrated by the ratio of secreted precursor increased from 10 to 50% (Fig. 2). To evaluate whether the improved secretion of insulin aspart precursors reflected improved folding, the precursors were purified and the in vitro folding stability determined. The in vitro folding stability of the precursors was assessed by titrations with the protein denaturant GdnHCl and detection by far-UV CD spectroscopy. The far-UV CD as a function of increasing concentrations of GdnHCl monitors the loss of secondary structure that accompanies protein unfolding. As shown in Fig. 3, the introduction of EWK and LWK mini-C-peptides strongly enhances the folding stability of the insulin aspart precursor. These data suggest that the in vitro folding stability is positively correlated with expression yield. To further investigate this correlation, additional amino acid substitutions, GluB10, HisA8, GluA14, were introduced to stabilize the α-helices of the insulin aspart precursor with and without the EWK mini-C-peptide (see Ref. 17Kaarsholm N.C. Norris K. Jørgensen R.J. Mikkelsen J. Ludvigsen S. Olsen H.B. Sørensen A.R. Havelund S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10773-10778Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar for design of helix capping). The helix-capping substitutions enhanced the folding stability and concomitantly increased the expression yield of the precursor 4.2-fold (Table I). Moreover, the combination of the EWK mini-C-peptide and these amino acid substitutions further improved the folding stability of the precursor, and the expression yield was increased 7.6-fold relative to the insulin aspart precursorAAK (Table I). Indeed, the combination of the EWK mini-peptide and the α-helix capping mutations results in an insulin species that remains essentially folded at 7 mGdnHCl. This corresponds to about a 200-fold shift in the forms in favor of the folded state in comparison with the insulin aspart precursorAAK species. Thus, the folding stability is a principal parameter in determining eukaryotic secretion efficiency. The previously described natural and synthetic C-peptides of insulin appear to offer little structural support or interaction with the remainder of the molecule. In contrast, the C-peptides described here have significant impact on the overall structure of the molecule by both intramolecular interaction and a direct contribution to the structural elements of the precursor. The activities of human insulin and insulin aspart are similar when determined by both metabolic potency (lipogenesis) and by receptor affinity (21Kurtzhals P. Schäffer L. Sørensen A. Kristensen C. Jonassen I. Schmid S. Trüb T. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 999-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). However, the single-chain insulin precursor has ∼0.1% activity of the two-chain mature molecules (22Markussen J. Jørgensen K.H. Sørensen A.R. Thim L. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1985; 26: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This has been interpreted that flexibility in the C terminus of the B-chain and a free N terminus of the A-chain are required for activity (22Markussen J. Jørgensen K.H. Sørensen A.R. Thim L. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1985; 26: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 23Nakagawa S.H. Tager H.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3204-3214Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The activity (lipogenesis) of the described single chain insulin aspart precursor featuring tryptophan in the C-peptide is further decreased 10-fold to ∼0.01% of human insulin. The low activity of this precursor is consistent with decreased flexibility in the C terminus of the B-chain and the N terminus of the A-chain because this region has been anchored by the tryptophan to the hydrophobic core of the molecule. Importantly, in vitro conversion of the insulin aspart precursors to the two-chain insulin aspart molecule restores full activity to the mature two-chain molecule (21Kurtzhals P. Schäffer L. Sørensen A. Kristensen C. Jonassen I. Schmid S. Trüb T. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 999-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). To assess the structural mechanism behind the concomitantly improved secretion and folding stability, the structure of the insulin aspart precursor was determined. The structure of the insulin aspart precursorEWK was determined by NMR spectroscopy based on two-dimensional proton NMR spectra at pH 8.0 and 1.0 mm. At these conditions the precursor does not dimerize or otherwise self-associate to any significant degree. Structure elucidation of the insulin aspart precursorEWK from NMR data agrees with other structures determined by similar methods (see supplementary table). The two-dimensional NOESY spectra of the insulin aspart precursorEWK are significantly different from similar spectra of the insulin aspart precursorAAK (data not shown). The structure of the insulin aspart precursorEWK (Fig. 4) shares secondary structural elements with other insulin structures (24Ludvigsen S. Roy M. Thøgersen H. Kaarsholm N.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7998-8006Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) including the extended structure from B1–B8, the α-helix B9–B19, a turn B20–B23, and a half-β-sheet structure from B24 to B27. However, the EWK mini-C-peptide and especially TrpC2 induce a number of distinct structural differences compared with all previously described insulin structures (Figs. 1 and 4). Importantly, TrpC2 is partly inserted into the binding site that is described above, which binds m- cresol/phenol in the insulin aspart precursorAAK (Fig. 1). The tryptophan side chain moiety packs against IleA2 and ValA3 as its helical neighbors to LeuB11, ValB12, and LeuB15 in the central B-chain helix and in the C-terminal part of the B-chain to TyrB26 and AspB28. Furthermore, TyrB26 together with AspB28 have been rearranged to open the m- cresol binding site to TrpC2 (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the insertion of the tryptophan into the hydrophobic core results in a re-orientation of the half-β-sheet structure from B24 to B27 and extension of the A1 α-helix of the A-chain (Fig. 4). The two-dimensional NOESY spectra of the insulin aspart precursorEWK show an extensive number of NOEs indicative of an α-helix from C2–A8. However, these NOEs are almost absent in the spectra of insulin aspart precursorAAK. Furthermore, the chemical shift values of α-protons assigned for residues of the insulin aspart precursorEWK in this region are on average shifted 0.35 up-field (lower ppm value) supporting that the residues of the EWK mini-C-peptide and the five first residues in the A-chain of the insulin aspart precursorEWK reside in an α-helical structure. Interestingly, the x-ray-derived structure of the insulin aspart precursorAAK also indicates an α-helix from C2–A8 (11Whittingham J.L. Edwards D.J. Antson A.A. Clarkson J.M. Dodson G.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11516-11523Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We conclude that the enhanced folding stability originates from the extended A-chain helix, which is anchored to the molecule by hydrophobic packing of the tryptophan side chain. Moreover, the half-β-sheet structure from B24 to B27 is moved further away from the center of the molecule compared with other insulin structures. The residues B28, B29, and C1 form a small ill defined coil structure, which is the starting point of the well defined α-helix from C2 to A8. This structural re-organization of the C-terminal part of the B-chain accommodates both the extension of the A1 α-helix and the insertion of the tryptophan residue side chain into the hydrophobic core of the molecule (Fig. 4). A novel aspect of the present studies is that structural improvement of molecular stability concomitantly enhances the efficiency whereby insulin traffics through the eukaryotic secretory pathway. Moreover, the enhanced folding stability was engineered by a hydrophobic interaction based on a specific phenol binding site in the core of the molecule. Furthermore, this intramolecular interaction introduces unique structural elements into the insulin molecule. Thus, the expressed molecule is not a mutant version of fast-acting insulin but a rational structurally adapted precursor that is readily converted into the native, two-chain structurally identical fast-acting insulin. Intriguingly, it was possible to further enhance the secretion efficiency in a synergistic manner by combing this novel stabilizing intramolecular interaction with more classical stabilization of the secondary structure elements. Interestingly, it has been shown that mutants of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor with impaired folding properties also were expressed inefficiently in yeast (9Kowalski J.M. Parekh R.N. Mao J.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1264-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This was interpreted that the thermodynamic stability can determine the efficiency of escape from ER, presumably because of degradation of inefficiently folded molecules. However, it has also been shown that insulin expressed in a sec18–1 mutant yeast strain, where the molecule cannot reach the Golgi complex, is not degraded, strongly indicating that insulin is not subjected to ER-associated degradation in yeast (25Zhang B-Y. Chang A. Kjeldsen T. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1187-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 27Laskowski R.A. Rullmann J.A.C. Macarthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol.

These actions are carried out by locally produced IGFs, which are supplemented by IGFs derived from the circulation. Partition of IGFs between the vascular and cellular interstitial compartments is determined in part by members of a family of high affinity IGF-binding proteins (1Delafontaine P. Cardiovasc.

IGFBPs modulate IGF-I and IGF-II bioavailability in part by competitive binding and sequestration and prevention of appropriate interaction with cell membrane receptors. In addition, some IGFBPs bind to components of the extracellular matrix (IGFBP-2, -3, and -5) or the cell membrane (IGFBP-1, -2, -3, and -5), thus providing a mechanism to concentrate IGFs within discrete tissue compartments (2Clemmons D.R.

These experiments clearly identify a 13-amino acid domain within the middle of the molecule as the principal site of cleavage. This region is largely conserved among mammalian species of this binding protein but is unique to IGFBP-4 among all IGFBP family members, offering a biochemical explanation for the apparent specificity of the IGFBP-4 proteases. This region is rich in basic amino acid residues that could be subject to tryptic-like cleavage. Attempts to further define which bonds within this domain are initially cleaved have produced somewhat discordant results. Some reports indicate residues 120/121 are most critical while others describe the 130/132 basic amino acids as the primary cleavage site (6Chernausek S.D. Smith C.E. Duffin K.L. Busby W.H. Wright G.

These differences could be caused by secondary site use by the protease, intraspecies differences, or more than one IGFBP-4 protease that attacks this highly charged domain. Our objective was to examine the role of IGFBP-4 proteolysis in vivo, using a mutant IGFBP-4 that would be largely insensitive to degradation by physiological IGFBP-4 proteases. We show that substitution of the seven basic residues in the midregion of IGFBP-4 by alanine renders the protein resistant to proteolysis in vitro and in vivo, without affecting its IGF binding affinity. When expressed at equivalent levels in smooth muscle cells of transgenic mice, protease-resistant IGFBP-4 results in greater growth inhibition than native IGFBP-4, supporting a role for IGFBP-4 proteolysis in the regulation of IGF-1 action. A cDNA construct encoding a mutant IGFBP-4 in which all seven basic residues between Lys-120 and Lys-132 were exchanged for Ala residues was produced by stepwise mutagenesis of a cDNA construct originally provided by S. Shimasaki et al. (30Shimasaki S. Uchiyama F. Shimonaka M. Ling N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1451-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) (Fig.1). The previously created K120A IGFBP-4 (6Chernausek S.D. Smith C.E. Duffin K.L. Busby W.H. Wright G. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11377-11382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) was mutated by PCR mutagenesis to K120A/H121A using the oligonucleotide 5′-ACTTTGGCCATAGCCGCCTGCAGGC-3′ and transferred to pcDNA 3.0 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) using previously described methodology (6Chernausek S.D.

Next the codon for residue Lys-124 was changed to Ala using the Chameleon double-stranded mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Inc.), employing the mutagenesis primer 5′-TATGGCCGCGGTGAGAGATGCGAGCAAGATGA-3′ that introduced a SacII restriction site. The final four residues were altered by generating a mutant PCR fragment that was cloned into the SacII and XbaI restriction sites of the aforementioned construct. The mutagenic oligonucleotide for this step was 5′-GGCTATGGCCGCGGTGGCAGATGCGAGCGCGATGGCGGTTGTGGGGACAC-3′. Fidelity of IGFBP-4.7A construct was verified by automated sequencing of the entire cDNA. This cDNA construct, IGFBP-4.7A, was ultimately expressed in vitro and in vivo for the experiments described. To analyze the properties of the mutant IGFBP-4.7A protein, we used B104ns cells, a subclone of the B104 rat neuroblastoma cell line with low expression levels of endogenous native IGFBP-4 as host for transfection experiments (14Orlowski C.C. Chernausek S.D. Akeson R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 139: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). IGFBP-4 proteins that contained C-terminal Myc-His tags were produced by stably transfecting B104ns cells with pcDNA 3.1 plasmids (Invitrogen) into which native and IGFBP-4.7A cDNAs had been cloned. Plasmid-bearing cells were grown to confluency in medium containing 800 ng/ml G418, and conditioned medium was collected, heated to inactivate endogenous proteases, and concentrated by Centricon-10 filters (Millipore, Bedford, MA). An aliquot of the conditioned medium was exposed to adult SMC medium for 24 and 40 h in buffer (50 mm Tris, 2 mm CaCl2, 50 μm ZnSO4, 0.002% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.5) containing 100 ng/ml IGF-1. Susceptibility to proteolysis was assessed following SDS-PAGE of the reaction mixture by immunoblot using an anti-Myc-specific antibody. The IGFBP-4.7A cDNA was cloned into the pcDNA3.1 expression plasmid, which was subsequently stably transfected into B104ns cells. The expressed protein had a 9-amino acid C-terminal extension in addition to the 7 mutated residues. Cells were maintained in G418 and expressed IGFBP-4.7A was purified using affinity chromatography. This preparation was compared with native IGFBP-4 isolated from B104ns medium as previously described (13Cheung P.T. Smith E.P. Shimasaki S. Ling N. Chernausek S.D. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 1006-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). 10 ng of the purified binding protein were then affinity cross-linked to125I-IGF-I using the bifunctional cross-linking agent disuccinimidyl suberate in the presence of graded amounts of unlabeled IGF-I, as described (13Cheung P.T. Smith E.P. Shimasaki S. Ling N. Chernausek S.D. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 1006-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The products of the competitive inhibition experiment were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the signal corresponding to IGFBP-4 was quantified by phosphorimaging. Mice with targeted overexpression of native IGFBP-4 in smooth muscle have been previously described (31Wang J. Niu W. Witte D.P. Chernausek S.D. Nikiforov Y.E. Clemens T.L. Sharifi B. Strauch A.R. Fagin J.A. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2605-2614Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We used an identical approach to target expression of IGFBP-4 7A selectively to smooth muscle cells. Briefly, the cDNA for the IGFBP-4 protease-resistant mutant was cloned downstream of the SMP8 fragment of the mouse SM α-actin gene promoter, as previously reported (31Wang J. Niu W. Witte D.P. Chernausek S.D. Nikiforov Y.E. Clemens T.L. Sharifi B. Strauch A.R. Fagin J.A. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2605-2614Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The SMP8-IGFBP-4.7A construct was released from Puc18 by digestion with KpnI and NotI and then gel-purified (31Wang J. Niu W. Witte D.P. Chernausek S.D. Nikiforov Y.E. Clemens T.L. Sharifi B. Strauch A.R. Fagin J.A. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2605-2614Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Male pronuclei of fertilized eggs from FVB-N mouse strains were microinjected with 2 pl of DNA at the transgenic mouse facility of the University of Cincinnati. Microinjected eggs were implanted into the oviduct of pseudopregnant female mice and carried to term. Positive founders were identified by Southern blotting and bred to wild-type FVB-N mice for propagation of the line. Mouse tail tips were cut at 3 weeks of age, and the transgene identified by Southern blotting of EcoR1-digested DNA hybridized with a rat IGFBP-4 cDNA probe labeled by random priming (Prime-It, Stratagene). The transgene was identified by the presence of a unique ∼3.0-kb band. Routine screening of established SMP8-BP-4 or SMP8-IGFBP-4.7A lines was performed by PCR of tail DNA using the following oligonucleotide primers: forward, 5′-CCTGTGACACTCCCGCTCTTTG-3′; reverse, 5′-AGGGCAGTGGATGGCTTCGTC-3′; endogenous c-Fos gene primers: forward, 5′-GGCTGGCCCTGTATTCCTGAT-3′; reverse, 5′-TCTTCTGACCCTTCCCTACTGAGC-3′. Amplification was performed under standard conditions using Redtaq polymerase (Sigma) with the following cycle parameters: initial hot-start denaturation, 95 °C, 5 min followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C, 1 min; 64 °C, 1 min; and 72 °C, 1 min. Five separate SMP8-IGFBP-4.7A lines were propagated and three of them selected for more extensive analysis. Expression levels and phenotypic changes in SMP8-IGFBP-4.7A mice were compared with those in the previously reported SMP8-IGFBP-4 lines 23942, 23928, 23926, and 23945 (31Wang J. Niu W. Witte D.P.

Transgene mRNA levels were determined by Northern blotting. Quantification was performed by phosphorimaging and adjusted to that of an appropriate internal standard. The same lines were then used for analysis of IGFBP-4 protein content by Western immunoblotting (31Wang J. Niu W. Witte D.P. Chernausek S.D. Nikiforov Y.E. Clemens T.L. Sharifi B. Strauch A.R.

Briefly, tissues were homogenized in PBS with 12 mm EDTA and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in a Polytron (model PT3000) at full speed on ice. Extracts were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, and the supernatant was further concentrated in a Centricon-3 device (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA). Aliquots of the concentrated extracts were taken for protein assay. The extracts were run on 10% Laemmli gels under reducing conditions. The blots were blocked with a Tris-buffered saline solution containing 0.05% Tween 20 and nonfat dry milk and incubated with either 1:5000 rabbit anti-rat IGFBP4 antibody (516.F) generated against residues 81–100 of the rodent sequence (6Chernausek S.D.

IGFBP-4 was visualized by standard ECL techniques as described (33Shirokawa J.M. Elisei R. Knauf J.A. Hara T. Wang J. Saavedra H.I. Fagin J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1725-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 34Chernausek S.D. Banach W. Clayton L. Stringer S.L. The Endocrine Society, 82nd Annual Meeting. Toronto, Canada, 2000: 240Google Scholar) and quantified by phosphorimager. SMP8-IGFBP-4.7A mice from line 39208 had equivalent levels of IGFBP-4 in smooth muscle rich tissues to age and sex-matched SMP8-IGFBP-4 mice from line 23942, and these were selected for analysis of organ weights. To compare the two transgenic lines, animals were sacrificed at 10 weeks of age as previously described (31Wang J. Niu W. Witte D.P. Chernausek S.D. Nikiforov Y.E. Clemens T.L. Sharifi B. Strauch A.R. Fagin J.A. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2605-2614Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Briefly, transgenic mice and their nontransgenic littermates were killed by CO2 asphyxiation. After obtaining body weight, blood was collected by cardiac puncture, and the serum was stored at −80 °C until use. Organs of interest were dissected, rinsed in ice-cold PBS, tissue-blotted, weighed, and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Contents of stomach and small intestine were flushed out with PBS before weighing. A section of the arterial vessel from the aortic arch to the level of femoral bifurcation was excised and placed in PBS. Adhering fat and connective tissue from the adventitia were scraped off under surgical microscope, and the vessel was cleansed with PBS to remove any residual blood. Tissues were weighed after blotting away excess fluid. We first explored the relative cleavage resistance of IGFBP-4 mutants with discrete substitutions across the putative protease recognition domain (amino acids 120–132). Purified alanine-substituted mutants IGFBP-4.K120A/H121A or IGFBP-4.K120A/H121A/K124A were only partially resistant to cleavage by protease activity from either osteoblast or smooth muscle cell-conditioned medium (not shown). We therefore developed an IGFBP-4 mutant in which all seven basic residues between Lys-120 and Lys-132 were substituted. As shown in Fig.2, concentrated aliquots of smooth muscle cell-conditioned medium efficiently cleaved purified Myc-tagged native rat IGFBP-4 but failed to degrade IGBP-4.7A in the presence of IGF-1. The goal of this study was to examine the contribution of IGFBP-4 degradation to IGF action in vivo. It was therefore important to demonstrate that the mutations introduced in the midregion of the molecule had not impaired IGF binding affinity. For this purpose, we purified IGFBP-4.7A and native IGFBP-4 from the conditioned medium of B104ns cells stably transfected with expression vectors for the respective binding protein. Equal amounts of native and mutant IGFBP-4 were then chemically cross-linked to 125I-IGF-1 in the presence of graded concentrations of unlabeled IGF-1. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and quantified by phosphorimager. Linear regression analysis showed comparable displacement of tracer by unlabeled ligand for both the wild-type and mutant forms of IGFBP-4, indicating that IGFBP-4.7A bound IGF normally (Fig. 3). To explore the function of the protease-resistant IGFBP-4 in vivo, we targeted its expression to smooth muscle cells of transgenic mice. We previously reported that targeted overexpression of native IGFBP-4 under the control of the SM α-actin gene promoter was associated with smooth muscle hypoplasia (31Wang J. Niu W. Witte D.P. Chernausek S.D. Nikiforov Y.E. Clemens T.L. Sharifi B. Strauch A.R. Fagin J.A. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2605-2614Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The same approach was used to target expression of IGFBP-4.7A to smooth muscle cells. As shown in Fig.4, tissue distribution of the IGFBP-4.7A mRNA transgene was restricted to smooth muscle cell-rich tissues such as the aorta, bladder, stomach, intestine, and spleen. This recapitulates the pattern of expression previously reported for the SMP8-IGFBP-4 mice (31Wang J. Niu W. Witte D.P. Chernausek S.D. Nikiforov Y.E. Clemens T.L. Sharifi B. Strauch A.R. Fagin J.A. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2605-2614Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and that of smooth muscle α-actin (31,32). Endogenous IGFBP-4 mRNA was maximal in the liver, spleen, and kidney. Expression of the IGFBP-4 transgenes (identified through their faster migration) did not affect endogenous IGFBP-4 mRNA abundance. Serum IGFBP-4 levels were not increased in either SMP8-IGFBP-4 or SMP8-IGFBP-4.7A mice as determined by Western ligand blotting, confirming that the products of the respective transgenes are largely confined to tissues of origin (not shown). If IGFBP-4.7A were resistant to endogenous proteases in vivo, then the tissues in which it is expressed should show greater accumulation of the protein relative to the abundance of the respective mRNA. To test this premise, we first quantified IGFBP-4 mRNA abundance in bladders from representative age- and sex-matched mice from four native IGFBP-4 and three IGFBP-4.7A transgenic lines, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5, transgenic IGFBP-4 mRNA was highly expressed in bladder of all lines tested and far exceeded abundance of the endogenous transcript. Notably, bladders from mice derived from the three lines expressing the protease-resistant mutant contained markedly higher levels of immunoreactive IGFBP-4 than the lines overexpressing the native form of the protein (Fig. 6). The IGFBP-4.7A immunoreactive band migrated significantly faster than native IGFBP-4, which was likely due to different interaction with the gel matrix. Altered electrophoretic mobility was not due to differences in glycosylation of the mutant protein as it persisted following digestion with N-glycanase (not shown).FIG. 6Western blot analysis of tissue extracts from bladders of IGFBP-4.7A and IGFBP-4 transgenic animals.Top panel, Western blots of bladder tissue extracts from the indicated transgenic lines incubated with a specific IGFBP-4 antiserum.NT, bladder extract from non-transgenic littermate;far left lane, 6 ng of recombinant hIGFBP-4. The same blot stripped and reprobed with extracellular-regulated kinase (Erk) antisera revealed equivalent loading of samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Fig. 7 depicts the relative IGFBP-4 protein and IGFBP-4 mRNA levels in quantitative terms. Bladder immunoreactive IGFBP-4/transgene mRNA ratios in all three SMP8-IGFBP-4.7A lines were significantly higher than in SMP8-IGFBP-4 mice, indicating that the IGFBP-4.7A protein was stabilized in vivo. Stabilization of IGFBP-4.7A was also apparent in aortic tissue of mice from these lines (not shown). We next explored whether IGFBP-4.7A exerted greater growth inhibitory effects than native IGFBP-4 when expressed at equivalent levels in smooth muscle cell-rich tissues. For this purpose, we studied SMP8-IGFBP-4 line 23942 and SMP8-IGBBP-4.7A line 39208, because they had comparable immunoreactive IGFBP-4 levels (Figs. 6 and 7). As previously reported, overexpression of native IGFBP-4 was associated with decreased wet weight of aorta, bladder, and stomach. Expression of comparable levels of the IGFBP-4 7A resulted in an even greater decrease of wet weight of the indicated tissues (Fig. 8A). There was no significant difference in total weight of the animals or weight of any other organ (data not shown). Overexpression of IGFBP-4.7A was also associated with a significant shortening of the small intestine, whereas native IGFBP-4 was without effect (Fig. 8B). These studies demonstrate that basic residues between amino acids 120 and 135 are critical for IGFBP-4 proteolysis and can be replaced by alanine without significantly affecting IGF-I binding affinity. Preservation of IGF-I binding would be anticipated because the primary binding domain for IGF-I in IGFBP-4 was demonstrated to reside within a hydrophobic motif in the distal part of the conserved N terminus of the protein (29Qin X. Strong D.D. Baylink D.J. Mohan S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23509-23516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 35Byun D. Mohan S. Baylink D.J. Qin X. J. Endocrinol. 2001; 169: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), in a similar region required for IGFBP-5 binding to IGF-I (36Zeslawski W. Beisel H.G. Kamionka M. Kalus W. Engh R.A. Huber R. Lang K. Holak T.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3638-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The decision to develop an IGFBP-4 mutant with multiple substitutions within the cleavage domain was based on evidence that mutants with more discrete replacements at the precise putative cleavage site(s) could still be degraded by IGFBP-4 protease(s) in the conditioned media of several cell types. Conover et al. (37Conover C.A. Durham S.K. Zapf J. Masiarz F.R. Kiefer M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4395-4400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) reported that the IGFBP-4 protease(s) secreted by human fibroblasts and osteoblasts cleaved hIGFBP-4 between Met-135 and Lys-136 (equivalent to Met-131/Lys-132 of rIGFBP-4) (37Conover C.A. Durham S.K. Zapf J. Masiarz F.R. Kiefer M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4395-4400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Discrete substitutions at these sites resulted in an IGFBP-4 mutant with normal binding affinity to IGFs, and a relative, but not absolute, resistance to proteolysis. By contrast, in a previous report one of us found the primary cleavage domain of IGFBP-4 to reside between Lys-120/His-121. However, alanine substitution of these two residues alone resulted in only partial resistance to proteolysis (6Chernausek S.D. Smith C.E. Duffin K.L. Busby W.H. Wright G. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11377-11382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) when B104 conditioned medium was the source of proteolytic activity. The extended domain involved in proteolytic degradation raises questions about the nature of the IGFBP-4 proteases produced by smooth muscle. PAPP-A has recently been found to cleave IGFBP-4 in an IGF-dependent manner (22Lawrence J.B. Oxvig C. Overgaard M.T. Sottrup-Jensen L. Gleich G.J. Hays L.G. Yates J.R. Conover C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3149-3153Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 38Overgaard M.T. Haaning J. Boldt H.B. Olsen I.M. Laursen L. Christiansen M. Gleich G.J. Sottrup-Jensen L. Conover C.A.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 504: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), it is thought to represent the dominant IGFBP-4 protease in most systems examined so far (17Conover C.A. Oxvig C.

Metab. 2001; 86: 847-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). PAPP-A is expressed in porcine vascular smooth muscle cells in culture, and immunoreactive PAPP-A increases in the medium following arterial injury in pigs (23Bayes-Genis A. Schwartz R.S. Lewis D.A. Overgaard M.T. Christiansen M. Oxvig C. Ashai K. Holmes D.R. Conover C.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in a recent human study, PAPP-A protein abundance is increased in unstable coronary plaques and is detected by immunoassay at higher concentrations in patients with either unstable angina or acute myocardial infarction (41Bayes-Genis A. Conover C.A. Overgaard M.T. Bailey K.R. Christiansen M. Holmes D.R., Jr. Virmani R. Oxvig C. Schwartz R.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 345: 1022-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). PAPP-A mRNA is also expressed in rodent vascular smooth muscle cells and in aortic tissue, and at least some of the IGFBP-4 protease activity detected in rat smooth muscle cell cultures is likely to be accounted for by PAPP-A (18Smith E.P. Kamyar A. Niu W. Wang J. Cercek B. Chernausek S.D. Fagin J.A. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4420-4427Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, porcine smooth muscle IGFBP-4 protease activity appears to cleave IGFBP-4 at a distinct site from PAPP-A and has a different inhibitor profile (24Rees C. Clemmons D.R. Horvitz G.D. Clarke J.B. Busby W.H. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4182-4188Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Because of this discrepancy, and the presence of an extended cleavage domain in our studies, it is possible that there is more than one protease acting either individually or sequentially on IGFBP-4 to achieve complete degradation of the protein. In accord with our previous report in which native IGFBP-4 was overexpressed under the control of the same SM α-actin promoter, the IGBP-4.7A mutant was expressed uniquely in smooth muscle-rich tissues (31Wang J. Niu W. Witte D.P. Chernausek S.D. Nikiforov Y.E. Clemens T.L. Sharifi B. Strauch A.R. Fagin J.A. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2605-2614Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). All IGFBP-4.7A-expressing lines had a higher ratio of immunoreactive IGFBP-4 to mRNA than their IGFBP-4 wild type-overexpressing counterparts. This points to a key post-translational step in the regulation of IGFBP-4 abundance in vivo, almost certainly through regulated proteolysis. This binding protein is also subject to significant pretranslational regulation in smooth muscle cells. Thus IGFBP-4 mRNA levels are regulated by PDGF (42Giannella-Neto D. Kamyar A. Sharifi B.

The evidence presented here indicates that IGFBP-4.7A results in greater growth inhibition than equivalent levels of wild type IGFBP-4 in vivo. These results support the concept that proteolysis of IGFBP-4 may be required for release of free IGF-I in smooth muscle and that the growth factor may be sequestered if the binding protein cannot be readily degraded. Despite the fact that IGFBP-4 consistently inhibits IGF action in many cell types in vitro, preliminary data on IGFBP-4-null mice indicate that, contrary to expectation, these animals have lower weight at birth (10–15%) (46Pintar J.E. Schuller A. Cerro J.A. Czick M. Grewal A. Green B. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1995; 6: 437-445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). One potential explanation is that the absence of IGFBP-4 diminishes tissue IGF storage capacity. This would predict that physiological levels of IGFBP-4 are required for normal growth, and that IGFs would be released through the action of PAPP-A and perhaps other IGFBP-4 proteases. When IGFBP-4 is selectively overexpressed in vivo tissue hypoplasia ensues due to ligand sequestration, because the degradation rate is exceeded by higher local production (31Wang J. Niu W. Witte D.P. Chernausek S.D. Nikiforov Y.E. Clemens T.L. Sharifi B. Strauch A.R. Fagin J.A. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2605-2614Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Our present results further support this concept, because expression of a protease-resistant mutant-binding protein resulted in even greater growth suppression in the targeted tissue environments. Recent studies examining the effects of local infusions of IGFBP-4 in bone also support this notion. Injection of a protease-resistant IGFBP-4, in which the sequence His-121 to Pro-141 was deleted, directly into the parietal bone was more potent than wild-type IGFBP-4 in inhibiting the anabolic actions of IGF-I (26Miyashi N. Qin X. Kasukawa Y. Richman C. Srivastava A.K. Baylink D.J. Mohan S. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 2641-2648Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). IGFBP-4 also appears to play a role in transport of IGF-I across the endothelial barrier, an effect that may require proteolysis of the binding protein (26Miyashi N. Qin X. Kasukawa Y. Richman C.

https://openalex.org/W2000039248,"We have investigated the ability of a receptor-mediated gene transfer strategy (cross-correction) to restore ganglioside metabolism in fibroblasts from Tay-Sachs (TS) patients in vitro. TS disease is a GM2 gangliosidosis attributed to the deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme beta-hexosaminidase A (HexA) (beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase, EC ). The hypothesis is that transduced cells overexpressing and secreting large amounts of the enzyme would lead to a measurable activity in defective cells via a secretion-recapture mechanism. We transduced NIH3T3 murine fibroblasts with the LalphaHexTN retroviral vector carrying the cDNA encoding for the human Hex alpha-subunit. The Hex activity in the medium from transduced cells was approximately 10-fold higher (up to 75 milliunits) than observed in non-transduced cells. TS cells were cultured for 72 h in the presence of the cell medium derived from the transduced NIH3T3 cells, and they were analyzed for the presence and catalytic activity of the enzyme. Although TS cells were able to efficiently uptake a large amount of the soluble enzyme, the enzyme failed to reach the lysosomes in a sufficient quantity to hydrolyze the GM2 ganglioside to GM3 ganglioside. Thus, our results showed that delivery of the therapeutic HexA was not sufficient to correct the phenotype of TS cells."

Tyrosine in the presence of ATP or ATPγS promotes the oligomerization of TyrR-(188–467) to a hexamer.

InEscherichia coli, it represses or activates the expression of at least eight unlinked operons in response to aromatic amino acid levels. TyrR binds to sites called TyrR boxes with the palindromic consensus sequence N2TGTAAAN6TTTACAN2 in the promoters of these operons, of which there are two classes. Strong boxes are very similar to the consensus sequence and bind TyrR in vitro in the absence of aromatic amino acids. Weak boxes have lower similarity to the consensus sequence and require an adjacent strong box, ATP, and tyrosine to bind TyrR. TyrR binding to weak boxes represses transcription. TyrR is a protein of 513 amino acids that is homodimeric at low protein concentrations in the absence of ligands. Amino acid sequence comparisons and limited proteolysis indicate that TyrR consists of three domains (3Morett E. Segovia L. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6067-6074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Cui J. Somerville R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5040-5047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain is similar to only one known protein, PhhR, which regulates phenylalanine hydroxylase and the phenol degradation pathway in Pseudomonas sp. (5Song J. Jensen R.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 497-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 6Ng L.C. Poh C.L. Shingler V. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1485-1490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain contains an ATP-independent aromatic amino acid binding site. The interaction of this domain with aromatic amino acids and RNA polymerase is thought to mediate transcriptional activation (7Wilson T.J. Argaet V.P. Howlett G.J. Davidson B.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 483-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar,8Yang J. Camakaris H. Pittard A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6372-6375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain contains a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif (1Pittard A.J. Davidson B.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1585-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 9Hwang J.S. Yang J. Pittard A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1051-1058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When cloned and expressed independently the N- and C-terminal domains were found to be dimeric (10Kwok T. The Domain Structure of the Regulatory Protein TyrR from Escherichia coli K12Ph.D. thesis. University of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia1998Google Scholar). The central domain is similar to the 230-amino acid conserved ATP-binding domains of the sigma 54 interaction family, which includes NtrC and NifA that are involved in nitrogen and nitrogenase regulation, respectively (Fig.1). Members of this protein family regulate genes transcribed by RNA polymerase holoenzyme associated with the alternative sigma factor, ς54 (1Pittard A.J. Davidson B.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1585-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 3Morett E. Segovia L. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6067-6074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, operons regulated by TyrR have promoters recognized by RNA polymerase holoenzyme associated with the major sigma factor, ς70. The central domain is also related to the large superfamily of AAA+ proteins that have wide-ranging functions based on a common ATPase structural module (11Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Ogura T. Wilkinson A.J. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 575-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). ATP enhances the affinity of the TyrR dimer for DNA (13Bailey M.F. Davidson B.E. Minton A.P. Sawyer W.H. Howlett G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 671-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It is also required for aromatic amino acids to bind to a second site within TyrR (7Wilson T.J. Argaet V.P. Howlett G.J. Davidson B.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 483-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). TyrR undergoes self-association from a dimer to a hexamer when tyrosine, the major effector of repression, binds to this ATP-dependent site (7Wilson T.J. Argaet V.P. Howlett G.J. Davidson B.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 483-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 14Wilson T.J. Maroudas P. Howlett G.J. Davidson B.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This ligand-induced oligomerization explains the co-operative binding of TyrR to the strong and weak boxes in operons that are repressed in response to tyrosine (14Wilson T.J. Maroudas P. Howlett G.J. Davidson B.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). ATP binding, aromatic amino acid binding, and self-association are therefore associated with tyrosine-mediated repression. In this study we isolated a soluble polypeptide encompassing the central domain of TyrR and investigated its ability to bind ATP, ATP analogues, and aromatic amino acids and to self-associate. We show that the central domain of TyrR uses functions common to AAA+ proteins to effect repression of gene transcription. Plasmid pMU1082 contains the E. coli tyrR gene cloned into pET-3a (15Argaet V.P. Wilson T.J. Davidson B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5171-5178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pMU1090 contains the E. coli tyrR gene excised from pMU1082 and inserted into the XbaI and BamHI sites of pET-11a (Novagen). Plasmid pMU5612, the plasmid used to express amino acids 188–467 of TyrR with a C-terminal affinity tag, was constructed using standard methods by inserting the appropriate DNA sequence amplified by the PCR from plasmid pMU1090 into theNdeI and XhoI sites of the vector pET-22b (Novagen). Plasmids pMU5610 and pMU5611, which express TyrR fragments from amino acids 193 to 432 with N- and C-terminal His6tags, respectively, were constructed by inserting DNA sequences PCR-amplified from pMU1090 into the NdeI andBamHI sites of the vectors pET-15b (Novagen) and pET-22b, respectively. E. coliBL21(DE3) carrying the plasmids pMU5612, pMU5610, or pMU5611 were grown in four 500-ml batches of 2× YT medium containing 200 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C in 2-liter flasks with rotary shaking. Protein expression was induced by addition of 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-d-galactopyranoside when the absorbance of the culture at 600 nm reached 0.6. Cells were harvested by centrifugation 2 h after induction. They were resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 5 mm imidazole at 4 °C, and lysed by sonication. The lysed cells were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C. The cell-free extract, supplemented with 10 mm MgCl2, was applied to a 5-ml column of TALON metal affinity resin (CLONTECH) equilibrated with lysis buffer. Unbound proteins were removed with several volumes of the lysis buffer, and the His6-tagged proteins were eluted in the same buffer containing 80 mm imidazole. The proteins were concentrated using 10-kDa molecular mass cut-off centrifugal concentrators and further purified by gel filtration at 4 °C using a AmershamBiosciences, Inc. HR 16/50 Superose 12 fast-protein liquid chromatography column run in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 1 mmDTT,1 1 mm EDTA. Thrombin cleavage of the N-terminal His6 tag of TyrR-(193–432) was carried out at 20 °C with 1 unit of thrombin/mg of protein in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 150 mmNaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2. The tagged central domain fragments encompassing amino acids 193–432 and 188–467 are referred to as TyrR-(193–432) and TyrR-(188–467), respectively. TyrR was purified as described previously, except that it was expressed from pMU1090 in E. coli BL21(DE3) instead of from pMU1082 inE. coli HMS174 (15Argaet V.P. Wilson T.J. Davidson B.E. J. Biol.

Microbiol. 1995; 17: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 12.5% polyacrylamide gels stained with Coomassie Blue R-250. Native protein concentrations were determined by absorbance. The previously determined extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 34,470 ×m−1 cm−1 (monomer) was used for TyrR (17Hagmar P. Bailey M. Tong G. Haralambidis J. Sawyer W.H. Davidson B.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1244: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Extinction coefficients of 14,440 ×m−1 cm−1 at 280 nm for both N- and C-terminal His6-tagged TyrR-(193–432) were calculated from the amino acid compositions using the program SEDNTERP (18Hayes, D. B., Laue, T., and Philo, J. (1999) SEDNTERP Sedimentation Interpretation Program, Version 1.03Google Scholar). The extinction coefficients for TyrR-(188–467) were experimentally determined as 17,420 × m−1cm−1 at 280 nm and as 6.12 × 103m−1 cm−1 at 290 nm using a method described previously (17Hagmar P. Bailey M. Tong G. Haralambidis J. Sawyer W.H. Davidson B.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1244: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The effect of tryptophan on the apparent molecular weight of TyrR-(188–467) was determined by gel filtration chromatography on Superose 12 in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, with or without 25 mm tryptophan and 200 μm ATP, by reference to a calibration curve obtained with proteins of known molecular weight. The elution volume of TyrR-(188–467) was determined by measuring the absorbance at 595 nm of 100-μl aliquots of 1-ml fractions with the protein assay (Bio-Rad) based on the method of Bradford (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216202) Google Scholar). Mass analysis was carried out using a Bruker Esquire 3000+ ion-trap mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics) equipped with an electrospray ionization source. Samples were prepared with 1 volume of 50% methanol/0.1% formic acid. Samples were introduced at 3 μl/min with a spray needle voltage of 4200 V, a capillary temperature of 350 °C, and nitrogen drying gas flow at 7 liters min−1. CD spectra were obtained with an AVIV 62DS CD spectrophotometer with a 400-μl 2-mm path-length quartz cell. The spectrum was measured from 190 to 250 nm in 0.5-nm intervals at 20 °C. Data were smoothed with a 3-point moving window. The secondary structure of TyrR-(188–467) was estimated using the CDSSTR program (20Johnson W.C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1999; 35: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Secondary structure was calculated by comparison with a reference set of 29 proteins. The ATPase activity was determined in 100-μl reactions containing 200 μm ATP, 2 nm[γ-32P]ATP (4000 Ci mmol−1), 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 9 μm TyrR or TyrR central domain polypeptides. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C. Samples of 1 μl were taken at 15-min intervals up to 1.8 h and applied to polyethyleneimine thin-layer chromatography plates (Merck). The TLC plates were dried before development in 0.5 m LiCl2, 1m CH3COOH. The relative quantities of resolved inorganic phosphate and ATP were determined using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). ATP binding was determined by flow dialysis (21Womack F.C. Colowick S.P. Methods Enzymol. 1973; 27: 464-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Experiments were carried out in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2 at 20 °C using a flow dialysis apparatus with 800-μl upper and lower chambers and a 2-cm2 diffusion area. 5-ml fractions were collected at a flow rate of 8 ml min−1. 2 nm[γ-33P]ATP (4000 Ci mmol−1) was added to the chamber containing 40 μl of TyrR or TyrR-(188–467) prior to titration by addition of successive 5- to 10-μl aliquots of unlabeled ATP (typically 1–10 mm). Transfer of ATP across the membrane was determined by scintillation counting. Fluorescence anisotropy measurements were carried out using a SPEX Fluorolog Tau-2 instrument as described previously (22Sawyer W.H. Chan R.Y. Eccleston J.F. Davidson B.E. Samat S.A. Yan Y. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5653-5661Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Fluorescence anisotropy measurements were made in the l-format with excitation and emission wavelengths of 560 and 600 nm, respectively. All experiments were carried out at 20 °C in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 5 mmMgCl2, with 20 nm rhodamine-ATP. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed in an Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman) using absorbance optics at 290 nm. Centrifuge cells in a Ti-60 rotor were fitted with two-channel or six-channel 12-mm path length centerpieces. ATPγS was used in place of ATP as described previously (14Wilson T.J. Maroudas P. Howlett G.J. Davidson B.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Centrifugation was carried out at 20 °C. Radial scans were performed at 1-h intervals. Equilibrium was normally attained after 14 h when successive scans were superimposable. A high speed experiment (40,000 rpm) was then performed to deplete protein to determine the baseline absorbance in each cell. Samples were prepared in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, and ligands were added as described below. Data analysis according to self-association models used the following general equation, ct,r=cP,r0eω22RTM(1−νρ)(r2−r02)+KP­N(cP,r0)neω22RTnM(1−νρ)(r2−r02)+BEquation 1 where c t,r is the total protein concentration at radius r in terms of extinction coefficient, cP,r0 is the concentration of protomer at the reference radiusr 0, ω is the angular velocity in radians/s, ρ is the density of the solution in g/ml (ρ = 1.007 (14Wilson T.J. Maroudas P. Howlett G.J. Davidson B.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar)), ν is the partial specific volume of the protein, R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, M is the molecular weight of the protomer, B is a baseline correction for absorbance due to the sample buffer, and n is the stoichiometry of the oligomer (23Howlett G.J. Davidson B.E. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 323: 231-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). K P-N is the association constant describing the protomer-oligomer equilibrium in terms of all the species and is defined as,KP­N=CN(cP)nEquation 2 where c N is the concentration of the oligomer and c P is the concentration of the protomer. The sedimentation equilibrium data were collected as absorbance data, and the resulting association constants were therefore in absorbance units. The molar association constants,K P-N(molar) given in the text were calculated from association constants in the absorbance form,K P-N(absorbance), according to equation,KP­N(molar)=KP­N(absorbance)(ɛ×l)n−1nEquation 3 where ε is the extinction coefficient at the wavelength of the experiment and l is the path length of the centrifuge cell (24Becerra S.P. Kumar A. Lewis M.S. Widen S.G. Abotts J. Karawya E.M. Hughes S.H. Shiloach J. Wilson S.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11707-11719Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Sedimentation data were analyzed using the program XLAEQ (Beckman), and non-linear least-squares curve fitting was performed with the program SigmaPlot (Jandel Scientific). Dynamic light scattering measurements were performed using an Autosizer 4700 light scattering spectrometer (Malvern Instruments) equipped with a 10-milliwatt Ar+ ion laser (488 nm). Measurements were performed at an angle of 90° and a temperature of 25 °C. 500-μl protein samples were prepared in 25 mmKH2PO4-K2HPO4, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and ligands as described in the text. TyrR-(188–467) concentrations were 40, 76, 255, and 715 μm in the absence of ligands. Data analysis was carried out as described previously (25Dunstan D.E. Stokes J. Macromolecules. 2000; 33: 193-198Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We purified two polypeptides containing the central domain as defined by amino acid sequence analysis and proteolysis. The polypeptide spanning amino acids 193 to 433 was purified with both N- and C-terminal His6 tags. Both polypeptides were less than 50% soluble. Gel filtration of the soluble protein revealed several species with molecular weights corresponding to monomer, dimer, trimer, and higher molecular weight oligomers (data not shown). The proportion of high molecular weight species increased during storage at 4 °C. None of the lower molecular weight species were observed when the higher molecular weight species were subject to gel filtration for a second time. This suggests that a soluble monomeric polypeptide was undergoing non-reversible aggregation rather than an equilibrium distribution between different oligomeric states. Removal of the N-terminal tag by thrombin cleavage increased precipitation. The purified polypeptides were also sensitive to proteolytic cleavage during purification. A polypeptide comprising amino acids 188 to 467 with a C-terminal tag was then produced. This was expressed with a yield of ∼60 mg of protein per liter of culture and did not undergo proteolytic degradation during purification. TyrR-(188–467) in 25 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmDTT remained soluble for at least 2 weeks at concentrations greater than 0.5 mm (16 mg/ml). Gel filtration revealed a single species. The identity of TyrR-(188–467) was confirmed by ion-trap mass spectrometry. The observed peak of 31,876 is identical to the mass of TyrR-(188–467) with the N-terminal methionine cleaved. Circular dichroism spectroscopy estimated the secondary structure to be 22% α-helix, 28% β-sheet, 50% remainder (data not shown). This may be compared to the 46% α-helix, 11% β−sheet, and 43% remainder predicted using the PHD method of secondary structure prediction (26Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2646) Google Scholar). The estimate of secondary structure from the CD data is limited by the lack of short wavelength data. TyrR possesses weak ATPase activity that is variously reported as being between 12 and 400 mmol of ATP mol−1 monomer min−1 (16Kwok T. Yang J. Pittard A.J. Wilson T.J. Davidson B.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 27Cui J., Ni, L. Somerville R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13023-13025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TyrR-(188–467) had a specific ATPase activity of 105 mmol of ATP mol−1 monomer min−1, ∼5-fold the value for TyrR, which was found in this study to be 20 mmol of ATP mol−1 monomer min−1. The TyrR polypeptides from amino acids 190 to 433 with both N- and C-terminal His6 tags were also assayed for ATPase activity. They both hydrolyze ATP at a similar rate to TyrR-(188–467), although this may not be comparable, because the proteins have multiple aggregating species. Flow dialysis showed that TyrR bound ATP with a half saturation value of 3.1 μm(Fig. 2). TyrR-(188–467) bound ATP with a half saturation value of 7.6 μm. The binding of the ATP analogue rhodamine-ATP was determined by measuring the increase of its fluorescence anisotropy on binding TyrR and TyrR-(188–467) (Fig.3). The dissociation constant of 0.28 μm determined for TyrR agrees with the value of 0.3 μm previously obtained using this technique (22Sawyer W.H. Chan R.Y. Eccleston J.F. Davidson B.E. Samat S.A. Yan Y. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5653-5661Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). TyrR-(188–467) bound to rhodamine-ATP with a dissociation constant of 1.4 μm. These analyses show that TyrR-(188–467) bound both ATP and rhodamine-ATP with 2- to 5-fold lower affinity than TyrR. These analyses also confirm that the concentration of ATP used in the ATP hydrolysis assay is likely to approach saturation, and the specific ATPase activity therefore represents maximal ATPase velocity. A previous study showed that the dissociation constant for ATP binding to TyrR was approximately the same as K m (28Maroudas P. Characterisation of the TyrR Protein from Escherichia coli: ATPase Activity and Interactions with DNAPh.D. thesis. University of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia1999Google Scholar). TyrR-(188–467) contains a single tryptophan at amino acid 412. The fluorescence emission intensity of TyrR-(188–467) at 350 nm was unchanged in the presence of either 200 μm ATP or 200 μm ATP/1 mm tyrosine.Figure 3Fluorescence anisotropy analysis of nucleotide binding to TyrR and TyrR-(188–467).

To determine what role the central domain plays in the association states of TyrR, the self-association of TyrR-(188–467) was investigated by sedimentation equilibrium analysis. Sedimentation equilibrium data obtained with 18 μm TyrR-(188–467) were well described by a model for a single homogeneous species with a molecular mass of 31-kDa (Fig.4). Data obtained in the presence of any one of 200 μm ATPγS, 25 mm phenylalanine, or 1 mm tyrosine were also well described by a model for a single homogeneous species, with molecular masses of 31, 32, and 33 kDa, respectively (Fig. 4). Attempts to fit these data to equilibrium models involving monomer and higher molecular weight species predicted extremely small proportions of higher molecular weight species. This analysis shows that the central domain is a monomer, in contrast to TyrR that is a dimer in a concentration-dependent equilibrium with a hexamer. Dynamic light scattering was employed to investigate the association states of TyrR-(188–467) at protein concentrations higher than can be used in ultracentrifugation (Fig.5). TyrR-(188–467) at protein concentrations of 40–715 μm was a single species with a hydrodynamic diameter of 5.3 ± 0.7 nm. A 475 μmsample of TyrR-(188–467) containing 1 mm ATPγS, 5 mm MgCl2 had a mean diameter of 5.2 nm.Figure 5Size distribution of TyrR-(188–467) determined by dynamic light scattering. 500 μmTyrR-(188–467) in the absence of ligands (solid line), 475 μm TyrR-(188–467) in the presence of 200 μm ATPγS (dotted line), and 357 μm TyrR-(188–467) in the presence of 200 μm ATPγS and 1 mm tyrosine (broken line).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the presence of 1 mm tyrosine and 200 μm ATPγS, the sedimentation profile of TyrR-(188–467) at concentrations of 8, 18, and 54 μm was consistent with a self-associating system (Fig. 6). Monomer-hexamer or monomer-dimer-hexamer models both fitted the data well, however, it was not possible to differentiate between these two models. The association constant was 3.5 × 1023m−5for a monomer-hexamer equilibrium. This association constant reflects TyrR-(188–467) being ∼50% hexameric at 50 μm. The association constants for the three-step model predicted very small amounts of dimeric intermediate. The association constants were:K M-D = 9.1 × 102m−1 and K D-H = 2.5 × 109m−2. Monomer-dimer, -trimer, -octamer, and dimer-tetramer, -hexamer models fitted poorly. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments carried out in the presence of 25 mm phenylalanine and 200 μm ATPγS also indicated a monomer-hexamer equilibrium (Fig. 6). Dynamic light scattering was also used to investigate the molecular size of TyrR-(188–467) at a high protein concentration (357 μm) in the presence of 1 mm tyrosine and 200 μm ATPγS (Fig. 5). Under these conditions TyrR-(188–467) was a single species with a hydrodynamic diameter of 9.6 nm compared with 5.3 nm in the absence of tyrosine. The near doubling of the monomer diameter is consistent with the formation of a species with a six to 7-fold increase in volume. Competition of tryptophan for tyrosine bound to the ATP-dependent aromatic amino acid binding site in TyrR suggested that tryptophan induced self-association (7Wilson T.J. Argaet V.P. Howlett G.J. Davidson B.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 483-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We used gel filtration chromatography to determine the effect of tryptophan on the association state of TyrR-(188–467), because tryptophan absorbance interferes with the detection of protein by UV absorbance in the ultracentrifuge. The presence of 25 mm tryptophan and 200 μm ATP changes the elution volume of TyrR-(188–467) from a value consistent with a monomer to one similar to that observed with 1 mm tyrosine and 200 μm ATP (data for tyrosine not shown) (Fig. 7). The concentration of tryptophan used was assumed to be saturating, because the dissociation constant for tryptophan to the ATP-dependent binding site in TyrR is 10 mm(7Wilson T.J. Argaet V.P. Howlett G.J. Davidson B.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 483-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To determine the affinity of TyrR-(188–467) for tyrosine, we investigated the effect of tyrosine concentration on self-association by equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation. At each tyrosine concentration, the data were fitted to an equation describing a monomer-hexamer model as described above (Fig.8). The half-maximal saturation value was determined to be 300 μm for TyrR-(188–467) compared with 250 μm for TyrR (14Wilson T.J. Maroudas P. Howlett G.J. Davidson B.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The central domain of TyrR links it both structurally and functionally with the large family of bacterial transcriptional regulators typified by NtrC and NifA (1Pittard A.J. Davidson B.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1585-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 3Morett E. Segovia L. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6067-6074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Current methods for recognizing protein sequence homologues using profile analysis show that it is also related to the AAA+ superfamily, which includes the established AAA family of proteins (11Neuwald A.F.

https://openalex.org/W2161761098,"A pharmacological approach to neoplasia by differentiation therapy relies on the availability of cytodifferentiating agents whose antitumor efficacy is usually assayed first on malignant cells in vitro. Using murine erythroleukemia cells (MELCs) as the model, we found that WEB-2086, a triazolobenzodiazepine-derived PAF antagonist originally developed as an anti-inflammatory drug, induces a dose-dependent inhibition of MELC growth and hemoglobin accumulation as a result of a true commitment to differentiation. MELCs treated for 5 days with 1 mM WEB-2086 show greater than or equal to 85% benzidine-positive cells, increased expression of alpha- and beta-globin genes, and down-regulation of c-Myb. This differentiation pattern, which does not involve histone H4 acetylation and is abrogated by the action of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, recalls the pattern induced by hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA). In addition to MELCs, human erythroleukemia K562 and HEL and myeloid HL60 cells are massively committed to maturation by WEB-2086 and, with some differences, by its analog, WEB-2170. This suggests that WEB-2086, structurally distant from other known inducers, might be a member of a new class of cytodifferentiation agents active on a broad range of transformed cells in vitro and useful, prospectively, for anticancer therapy due to their high tolerability in vivo."

Five cyclic peptides with two sequence motifs, six linear 7-mers, and five linear 12-mers with different sequence motifs were identified. Only phage displaying cyclic peptides were specifically captured by and were antigenic for 9-2-L379. Monoclonal antibody 9-2-L379 exhibited “apparent” binding affinities to the cyclic peptides between 11 and 184 nm, comparable with lipo-oligosaccharide. All cyclic peptides competed with the binding of 9-2-L379 to lipo-oligosaccharide with EC50 values in the range 10–105 μm, which correlated with their apparent binding affinities. Structural modifications of the cyclic peptides eliminated their ability to bind and compete with monoclonal antibody 9-2-L379. Mice (C3H/HeN) immunized with the cyclic peptide with optimal apparent binding affinity and EC50 of competition elicited cross-reactive antibodies to meningococcal lipo-oligosaccharide with end point dilution serum antibody titers of 3200. Cyclic peptides were converted to T-cell-dependent immunogens without disrupting these properties by C-terminal biotinylation and complexing with NeutrAvidin®.

The data indicate that constrained peptides can cross-react with a carbohydrate-specific antibody with greater specificity than linear peptides, and critical to this specificity is their structural conformation. Numerous studies have demonstrated that oligopeptides, identified from antigenic regions of antibody idiotype sequences or by direct binding to anti-carbohydrate antibodies, can elicit cross-reactive antibody responses to bacterial polysaccharides (1Charalambous B.M. Feavers I.M. J. Med. Microbiol. 2001; 50: 937-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Such peptides have been termed conformational mimics of bacterial carbohydrates.

Conformational peptide mimics were first identified from peptide sequences within the antigen-binding sites of anti-idiotypic antibodies (8Westerink M.A. Campagnari A.A.

However, many candidate conformational peptide mimics identified by these methods fail to elicit the required immunological cross-reactive responses (3Moe G.R. Tan S. Granoff D.M. FEMS Immunol. Med.

In this study more detailed characterization was undertaken of the specificity, binding affinity, and ability to compete with the binding of antibody to its nominal carbohydrate antigen to determine how well the peptides could mimic the LOS antigen prior to immunization experiments. lipooligosaccharide monoclonal antibody plaque-forming units enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay bovine serum albumin dithiothreitol phosphate-buffered saline lipopolysaccharide lipooligosaccharide monoclonal antibody plaque-forming units enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay bovine serum albumin dithiothreitol phosphate-buffered saline lipopolysaccharide Antigen-antibody interactions depend not only on chemical interactions between the antibody epitope and antigen but also on the conformation of the antigen, because it has to complement surface topology present on the complementarity-determining region of the antibody. Peptides with a constrained structure would therefore be more likely to depend on conformation as well as chemical interactions to bind to the antibody paratope and act as better conformational mimics that elicit a cross-reactive antibody response to the bacterial glycan structure, whereas the more flexible linear peptides may only adopt a shape on docking to the antibody. To test this hypothesis phage libraries displaying structurally constrained peptides were panned in addition to linear peptides by direct interaction with an antibody. The libraries express random peptides as N-terminal fusions to phage coat protein pIII, which favors the selection of high affinity peptides, as only one to five copies of the pIII protein are expressed on the surface. As an appropriate model to test our hypothesis, we chose the outer membrane lipo-oligosaccharide present on several serogroups, including group B, of the opportunistic pathogen N. meningitidis. In the absence of a comprehensive vaccine meningococcal group B disease remains a major global health problem, and any conformational mimics identified in this study may be potential vaccine candidates. Meningococcal LOS has been proposed as a vaccine candidate (12Gu X.X. Tsai C.-M. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 1873-1880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but its mimicry to human glycosphingolipids (13Preston A. Mandrell R.E. Gibson B.W. Apicella M.A. Crit. Rev.

Panning phage libraries with mAb 9-2-L379 specific for the LOS3,7,9 immunotype identified six linear 7-mers and 12-mers and five cyclic 7-mer peptides. Phage capture assays revealed that only the cyclic peptides were specific for mAb 9-2-L379 and were immunoreactive with this mAb. Data are presented that indicate the apparent binding affinities of mAb 9-2-L379 to the cyclic peptides are comparable with the apparent binding affinity of the nominal antigen, LOS, and that their ability to compete for the binding of LOS is related to their binding affinity. Data are also presented that suggest the structure of the cyclic peptides is critical to their ability to cross-react with mAb 9-2-L379 and inhibit its binding to LOS. Initial immunization data show that the cyclic peptide with optimal apparent binding and EC50 of competition elicited cross-reactive antibody responses to meningococcal LOS. Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma or BDH. Tryptone, yeast extract, and bacteriological agar were purchased from Oxoid. The coliphage libraries Ph.D 7 (linear 7-mer random peptides), Ph.D 12 (linear 12 mer peptides), and Ph.D C7C (cyclic 7-mer peptides) were purchased from New England Biolabs. All three libraries express random peptides as an N-terminal fusion to coliphage coat protein pIII. The monoclonal antibodies used in this study are 9-2-L379 (IgG2a) specific for lipo-oligosaccharide immunotype L3,7,9 and MN14C11.6 (IgG2a) specific for serosubtype P1.7 and MN4A8-B2 (immunotype L379). The ascites or hybridoma culture supernatants (supplied where necessary by the Large Scale Laboratory, National Institute of Medical Research, Mill Hill, UK) were dialyzed against three changes of 4 liters of 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 (phosphate buffer). mAbs were purified by protein G chromatography. The protein concentration of the dialyzed material was determined, after which it was stored in aliquots at −20 °C until required. The purity of the mAbs was confirmed by SDS-PAGE (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206663) Google Scholar), and the final antibody titer against LOS L3,7,9 was determined by ELISA (28Evans J.S. Maiden M.C.J. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). One hundred microliters of mAb 9-2-L379 diluted to a concentration of 50 μg ml−1 in coating buffer (100 mm NaHCO3, pH 8.6) was dispensed into the wells of 96-well microtiter plates (Nunc-ImmunoTM Plate MaxiSorpTM Surface). The plates were covered to prevent drying and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Wells were washed by three changes of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% v/v Tween 20, pH 7.5 (TBST). Two hundred microliters of BSA blocking buffer (coating buffer with 5 mg ml−1 bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma), pH 8.6) was added to each well and incubated for 60 min at room temperature. Wells were then washed 5 times with TBST. The coliphage library (1012 pfu ml−1) was suspended in 100 μl of TBST and dispensed into the wells coated with the panning antibody, mAb 9-2-L379, and incubated for 60 min at room temperature. Wells were either left uncoated or coated with an unrelated mAb as a negative control. They were washed 10 times with TBST prior to the addition of 100 μl of elution buffer (200 mm glycine HCl, pH 2.2) to each well and further incubation for 10 min at room temperature. The eluted coliphages were pipetted into sterile tubes containing 15 μl of neutralization buffer (1m Tris-HCl, pH 9.0). Five microliters of each eluate was titrated to determine the number of pfu recovered after each round of panning. The phage eluate was amplified by transfecting Escherichia coli cells according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the amplified phage suspension was stored at 4 °C. Two further rounds of panning were undertaken as before, except 1012 pfu ml−1 of the amplified phage stock prepared from the previous round was used instead of the initial coliphage library. The concentration of Tween 20 in the TBST was increased to 0.5% v/v for the subsequent washing steps. The third round phage eluate was titrated, mixed 1:1 with 40% (v/v) glycerol, and stored at −20 °C until required. The fourth round of panning was performed at 50, 5.0, and 0.5 μg ml−1 of the target antibody 9-2-L379 coating the microtiter plate wells. The plates used for titrating the phage eluates following the third and fourth rounds of panning were also used as a source of phage for nucleic acid sequencing. Plates used for picking individual phage plaques for sequencing were not incubated for longer than 18 h. Coliphage display libraries and phage captured by the mAbs were titrated according to the methods described by the manufacturer, New England Biolabs. The phage DNA was extracted following a protocol recommended by the manufacturer, and the nucleotide sequence was determined from a cycle sequence reaction using the −96 universal primer provided with the library and Big Dye terminators (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) resolved on an Applied Biosystems Prism 377 automated sequencer. Microtiter plate wells were coated overnight at 4 °C with 100 μl of mAb 9-2-L379, the unrelated anti-porin P1.7 mAb, MN14C11.6, or with BSA all diluted to 50 μg ml−1 in 100 mmNaHCO3, pH 8.6. Wells were washed 5 times with TBST buffer and then blocked with 3% (w/v) skimmed milk in TBST for 2 h at room temperature. Wells were washed 5 times with TBST, and 1010 phage particles of a specific test phage (1011 pfu ml−1 in TBST) were dispensed into wells containing the target antigens. The individual phage clones were amplified to >1012 pfu ml−1 and diluted to 1011 pfu ml−1 in TBST. Microtiter plates were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with gentle rocking. Unbound phage were washed off by 10 changes of TBST. The bound phage were incubated for 10 min at room temperature with 100 μl of 200 mm glycine HCl, pH 2.2. The phage were pipetted into sterile tubes containing 15 μl of neutralization buffer (1m Tris-HCl, pH 9.1). Five microliters of each phage eluent was titrated to determine the number of pfu recovered after capture. Each phage titration was performed in triplicate and expressed as the mean pfu ± S.D. For negative controls phage capture was performed on random clones picked from the relevant peptide phage display libraries (Table III).Table IIIConsensus phage clones and synthetic peptides used in this study3-a Peptides are displayed at the exposed N terminus of the coliphage minor coat protein glycoprotein III.3-b Random clone (RC) negative control.3-c Biocytin amide.3-d Acetylated N terminus.3-e Unmodified C terminus.

Peptides were synthesized using standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry, biotinylated by incorporation of biocytin amide, and cyclized by oxidation under controlled conditions to form an intramolecular disulfide bridge between the cysteine residues located at Cys2 and Cys10 (MedProbe, Oslo, Norway). The cyclic peptides were supplied after purification on high pressure liquid chromatography and determined to be >95% pure by mass spectrometry. The peptides were resuspended in PBS to a stock concentration of 10 mg ml−1and stored at −20 °C. For the determination of their binding affinity, peptides were immobilized to a biosensor cuvette coated with biotin and activated by addition of streptavidin. For peptide ELISAs microtiter plates were coated with avidin, streptavidin, or NeutrAvidin® prior to addition of the peptide. Twenty microliters of each peptide stock (10 mm) was mixed with an equal volume of 500 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) and allowed to incubate overnight at room temperature. The reduced peptides were then stored at –20 °C until required for use. Twenty microliters of each peptide stock (10 mm) was mixed with an equal volume of 200 mm sodium acetate and then 20 μl of acetic anhydride. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 h and then stored at –20 °C until required for use. Removal of the DTT or acetic anhydride from the peptides prior to storage was not necessary, because any traces of either reagent were removed during the thorough wash procedures after the peptides were immobilized to either the microtiter well or biosensor cuvette before the interaction with the mAb. Reacti-Bind Maleic Anhydride plates (Pierce) were coated with 10 μg ml−1 of the test peptides in carbonate buffer, pH 9.6, at 37 °C overnight. The plates were washed with 1× factor Xa cleavage buffer (Novagen, Inc) prior to the addition of 1 μg ml−1 factor Xa protease in 1× cleavage buffer. Samples were incubated at room temperature for 2 h; control samples had no protease added, but otherwise were treated identically. Samples were washed with PBS plus 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 7.2 (PBST), and then blocked with 3% (w/v) skimmed milk in PBST for 2 h at 37 °C. Samples were washed with PBST prior to ELISA as described below. 96-Well microtiter plates (Nunc-ImmunoTM Plate MaxiSorpTM Surface) were coated with NeutrAvidin® (Pierce) by adding to each well 100 μl of 5 μg ml−1 NeutrAvidin® solution in coating buffer (15 mm Na2CO3 and 35 mm NaHCO3 at pH 9.6) and incubating overnight at 4 °C covered or placed inside a humidified chamber to prevent drying. The wells were washed (all washes unless otherwise stated were performed 5 times with PBST) and then blocked with 200 μl per well of PBS with 3% (w/v) skimmed milk powder and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 7.2 (blocking buffer). After 30 min incubation at 37 °C, the wells were washed, and 100 μl of the biotinylated peptides diluted to 2 μg ml−1 in PBS was dispensed into each well and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. After washing 100 μl of the primary antibody, mAb 9-2-L379 diluted (1:2000–1:4000 according to the titer) in blocking buffer was added to each well and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. Wells were washed and 100 μl of the secondary goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, appropriately diluted in blocking buffer, was added and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. After washing 100 μl of TM Blue (Intergen Co.) was added to each well and allowed to develop for 5–10 min at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by adding 100 μl per well of 1 mH2SO4, and absorbance was measured at 450 nm. This assay was performed according to the protocol of Charalambous and Feavers (7Charalambous B.M. Feavers I.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 191: 45-50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Peptide-elicited cross-reactive antibody response against LOS was expressed as end point dilution antibody titers. mAb 9-2-L379 was diluted in blocking buffer (PBS with 3% (w/v) skimmed milk powder and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, pH7.2) so that when reacted against L3,7,9 LOS in an ELISA the absorbance values at 450 nm were between 0.75 and 1.0. The diluted mAb was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 0–62.5 μm biotinylated peptides. As a negative control an irrelevant peptide was picked at random (Table III) and incubated with the mAb. Microtiter wells were coated with 0.3 μg of LOS L3,7,9 conjugated to BSA diluted in coating buffer and incubated overnight at 4 °C without drying. Wells were washed, and 200 μl of the blocking buffer was added and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. After washing 100 μl of mAb 9-2-L379 incubated with various concentrations of the peptides was added per well. Following incubation for 60 min at 37 °C, the wells were washed, and 100-μl aliquots of the secondary antibody appropriately diluted in the blocking buffer were added. The amount of secondary antibody bound was determined as described previously. Inhibition data were fitted by non-linear regression analysis to the one-site competition equation: Y = bottom + (top − bottom)/(1 + 10( X −LogEC50)); where Y = percent maximum binding and X = log (peptide concentration) using software from GraphPad Prism® (GraphPad Software Inc.). Each determination was the mean ± S.D. of triplicate determinations. The real time binding kinetics of the anti-LOS L3,7,9 mAb, 9-2-L379, and other control mAbs to the consensus peptides were determined at 25 °C in PBST with a resonant mirror biosensor according to the manufacturer's instructions (Thermo Labsystems, formerly Affinity Sensors, Saxon Way, Barhill, Cambridge, UK). Biotinylated peptides were immobilized to biotin-coated biosensor cuvettes via a streptavidin bridge. Peptides that were previously treated with DTT or acetic anhydride were immobilized to the biosensor cuvette surface and then washed 10 times to remove all traces of these reactants. To ensure that similar levels of native and structurally modified peptides were immobilized to the biosensor cuvette, their interaction profiles as arc second response were monitored and compared. Because antibodies have two possible binding sites, only the initial monophasic part of the interaction profile was used to determine the on rate at each concentration of antibody from which the Ka was determined. The dissociation rate constant (Kd) was determined from the mean of the off rates at various concentrations of the interacting mAb diluted to zero concentration (25Charalambous B.M. Evans J. Feavers I.M. Maiden M.C. Clin. Diagn. Lab Immunol. 1999; 6: 838-843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To ensure that rebinding effects were negligible, only the off rates in the presence of excess bound mAb were included (26Nieba L. Krebber A. Pluckthun A. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 234: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Kinetic data were analyzed by curve fitting software (FASTfit version 2.01) and interaction profiles overlaid with the FASTplotTM software provided by Affinity Sensors. The binding affinity is expressed as the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD), calculated from the ratio of Kd /Ka. The validity of the biosensor data was tested to determine whether monophasic or biphasic kinetics were observed. A meaningful KD was obtained when monophasic or first-order kinetics are observed, but if bi-phasic or second-order kinetics are observed then an apparent KD is derived that represents the avidity of the bivalent antibody to the polyvalent surface. The total amount of antibody bound (arc second response) to the biosensor cuvette was plotted as a function of antibody concentration, with no presumptions on whether it is first- or second-order kinetics. From non-linear regression analysis of the saturation curves, we derived approximate KD values. The KD values from this plot were consistent with the KD values derived from the Ka and Kd values, indicating that the data are internally consistent with “pseudo” first-order kinetics (27Schuck P. Minton A.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 458-460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The C22 peptide (C22-bio, Table III) was complexed to NeutrAvidin® in a molar ratio of 10:1 (peptide:Neutravidin®) by prior mixing at 37 °C for 2 h. C3H/NeH mice were immunized with 20 μg of the complex in 50 μl of PBS mixed with an equal volume of either complete Freund's adjuvant, for the primary immunization, or incomplete Freund's adjuvant for the booster immunization 2 weeks after the primary. The control group of mice were immunized with 20 μg of NeutrAvidin® in 50 μl of PBS and mixed with equal volume complete Freund's adjuvant or incomplete Freund's adjuvant or immunized with 50 μl of PBS in either complete Freund's adjuvant or incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Mice were terminally bled 2 weeks after the booster injection, and the serum was aspirated from coagulated blood and frozen at −20 °C until assayed individually by ELISA for total IgG antibodies with meningococcal LOS as target antigen. Phage libraries displaying random linear 7-mer and 12-mer peptides and cyclic 7-mer peptides were panned by direct interaction with the anti-LOS L3,7,9 mAb 9-2-L379, and individual phage clones were picked following three or four rounds (Table I). To identify tight binders the fourth round of panning was performed with decreasing amounts of target antibody from 50 to 0.5 μg ml−1 to increase the competition for binding.Table IAmino acid sequence and frequency of phage clones following 3 and 4 rounds of panning against the anti-LOS L3,7,9 mAb 9–2-L379p3 indicates the N terminus of the coliphage minor coat protein glycoprotein III.1-a Invariant residues are underlined.1-b Consensus residues are highlighted.1-c Number of clones showing identical peptide sequence but not necessarily identical DNA sequences. mAb9–2-L379 target concentration.1-d 50 μg ml−1.1-e 5.0 μg ml−1.1-f 0.5 μg ml−1.

Higher consensus frequencies were observed with cyclic peptides compared with linear peptides. After four rounds of panning two cyclic peptide motifs were identified as follows: motif 1, SW XH(M/Q)PY, and motif 2, XT(L/I)GGYE. Motif 1 was represented by five peptides in the 3rd round and six peptides in the 4th round and was 59 and 97% of the total consensus peptides, respectively. Motif 2 was seen in three peptides (9%) in the third round and one peptide in the 4th round (6%). In contrast the linear libraries yielded different sequence motifs. The cyclic peptides have aromatic residues; motif 1 has a tryptophan at position 2 and a tyrosine at position 7, and motif 2 has only a tyrosine at position 6. Some of the linear peptides also contained aromatic residues (Table I). Because phage displaying the same cyclic peptide sequences could have arisen from either independent clones or from a single clone in earlier rounds and undergone mutation during subsequent rounds of panning, we compared the DNA sequences of the individual clones. Table II shows the amino acid and DNA sequences of individual phage clones encoding the two cyclic peptide motifs identified.Table IIAmino acid and DNA sequences of phage clones identified by panning against the anti-LOS L3,7,9 mAb 9–2-L379Amino acid sequenceDNA sequencePanning round (No. of clones)3rd4th2-a50 μg ml−1.4th2-b5 μg ml−1.4th2-c0.5 μg ml−1.Motif 1 SWLHQPY5′-AGT.TGG.CTG.CAT.CAG.CCT.TAT1211818T––.–––.–––.–––.–––.––G.–––1130 T G1100T––.–––.––T.–––.–––.––G.–––0020 SWFHMPYT––.–––.T––.–––.AT–.––G.–––3523 SWDHMPYT–G.–––.GAT.–––.AT–.––G.–––2620 SWVHMPY–––.–––.G–T.–––.AT–.–––.–––1100 SWMHMPYT––.–––.A––.–––.AT–.––G.–––1524 SWLHMPYTCG.–––.––T.–––.AT–.–––.–––0240Motif 2 NTIGGYEAAT.ACT.ATT.GGT.GGG.TAT.GAG1012 LTIGGYECT–.–––.–––.––G.–––.–––.–––1000 RTLGGYECGG.–––.T–G.–––.––T.–––.–––1000 TTLGGYE–C–.–––.C––.––G.–––.–––.–––0010The DNA sequences and the frequency of each sequence were determined after each round of panning.

https://openalex.org/W1967126430,"The interaction of a spin-labeled lysophosphatidylcholine analog with intact and bromelain-treated influenza viruses as well as with the bromelain-solubilized hemagglutinin ectodomain has been studied. The inhibition of fusion of influenza viruses with erythrocytes by the lysophosphatidylcholine analog was similar to that observed for non-labeled lysophosphatidylcholine. Only a weak interaction of the lysophosphatidylcholine analog with the hemagglutinin ectodomain was observed even upon triggering the conformational change of the ectodomain at a low pH. A significant interaction of spin-labeled lysophosphatidylcholine with the hemagglutinin ectodomain of intact viruses was observed neither at neutral nor at low pH, whereas a strong interaction of the lipid analog with the viral lipid bilayer was evident. We suggest that the high number of lipid binding sites of the virus bilayer and their affinity compete efficiently with binding sites of the hemagglutinin ectodomain. We conclude that the inhibition of influenza virus fusion by lysolipids is not mediated by binding to the hemagglutinin ectodomain, preventing its interaction with the target membrane. The results unambiguously argue for an inhibition mechanism based on the action of lysolipid inserted into the lipid bilayer."
