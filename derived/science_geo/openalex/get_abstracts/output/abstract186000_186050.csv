https://openalex.org/W2157810409,"Plk1 (Polo-like kinase 1), an evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine kinase, is crucially involved in multiple events during the M phase. Here we have identified a consensus phosphorylation sequence for Plk1, by testing the ability of systematically mutated peptides derived from human Cdc25C to serve as a substrate for Plk1. The obtained results show that a hydrophobic amino acid at position +1 carboxyl-terminal of phosphorylated Ser/Thr and an acidic amino acid at position –2 are important for optimal phosphorylation by Plk1. We have then found that Myt1, an inhibitory kinase for MPF, has a number of putative phosphorylation sites for Plk1 in its COOH-terminal portion. While wild-type Myt1 (Myt1-WT) served as a good substrate for Plk1 <i>in vitro</i>, a mutant Myt1 (Myt1-4A), in which the four putative phosphorylation sites are replaced by alanines, did not. In nocodazole-treated cells, Myt1-WT, but not Myt1-4A, displayed its mobility shift in gel electrophoresis, due to phosphorylation. These results suggest that Plk1 phosphorylates Myt1 during M phase. Thus, this study identifies a novel substrate for Plk1 by determining a consensus phosphorylation sequence by Plk1."
https://openalex.org/W2049247347,"The TRPV4 calcium-permeable channel was cloned from mouse kidney M-1 cells, and the effect of temperature modulation on channel gating/activation by physical and chemical signals was evaluated. A TRPV4 cDNA construct with a C-terminal V5 epitope was stably transfected into human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 and Chinese hamster ovary cells resulting in high levels of expression at the plasma membrane. Channel activation was assessed from changes in calcium influx (fura-2 fluorescence measurements) or whole cell currents (patch clamp analysis). At room temperature (22–24 °C), exposure of TRPV4-transfected cells to hypotonic medium (225 mOsm/liter) or a non-protein kinase C (PKC)-activating phorbol ester derivative, 4α-phorbol 12,13-decanoate (100 nm), induces modest channel activation, whereas phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (100 nm), a PKC-activating phorbol ester, and shear stress (3–20 dyne/cm2) had minimal or no effect on channel activation. In contrast, at elevated temperatures (37 °C) the channel was rapidly activated by all stimuli. Inhibition of PKC by calphostin C (50 nm) or staurosporine (500 nm) abolished phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced activation of the channel without affecting the response to other stimuli. Ruthenium red (1 μm) effectively blocked the channel activity by all stimuli. It is concluded that temperature is a critical modulator of TRPV4 channel gating, leading to activation of the channel by a diverse range of microenvironmental chemical and physical signals utilizing a least two transduction pathways, one PKC-dependent and one PKC-independent. The convergence of multiple signals and transduction pathways on the same channel indicate that the channel functions as a molecular integrator of microenvironmental chemical and physical signals.

The TRP calcium-permeable cation channels are a rapidly growing superfamily of channels expressed in a broad range of both excitable and nonexcitable cells. The channels, in general, are not voltage-activated but appear to be activated by a broad range of ligands and intracellular mediators (1Caterina M.J. Julius D. Annu. Rev.

The superfamily has been divided into three main subfamilies based on structural and functional similarities: TPRVC, the canonical TRP channels first identified in Drosophila; TRPV, the vanilloid subfamily named after its first member, the vanilloid receptor (or capsaicin receptor; renamed TRPV1); and TRPM, the melatonin subfamily named after its first member, melatonin (see Refs. 1Caterina M.J.

The TRPV subfamily has demonstrated a notable broad sensitivity to chemical and physical stimuli, particularly for TRPV1, which is activated by various noxious mediators, including heat, acid, and capsaicin (the hot ingredient of peppers), and by endogenous lipid mediators, such as diacylglycerol and anandamide (2Clapham D.E.

Initial evidence indicated that the channel may function as a mammalian osmoreceptor and hence may play a central role in osmoregulatory functions (16Liedtke W. Choe Y. Marti-Renom M.A. Bell A.M.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 485: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). However, the Caenorhabditis elegans homologue, OSM-9, has been shown to underlie a wide range of sensory functions, including olfactory, mechanosensory, and osmosensory processes (19Tobin D.

Further, in mouse, rat, human, and chicken, TRPV4 has been shown to be distributed in a broad range of tissues, including trachea, kidney, liver, heart, lung, testis, brain, and ear, implicating a potentially diverse range of sensitivities and functions for the mammalian channel. Although initial studies demonstrated that this channel may only be activated by hypotonicity (16Liedtke W. Choe Y. Marti-Renom M.A. Bell A.M. Denis C.S. Sali A. Hudspeth A.J. Friedman J.M. Heller S.

Chem. 2002; 277: 13569-13577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Early studies indicated that the mammalian TRPV4 channels appeared to have a much narrower range of sensitivities to mechanical and, possibly, chemical stimuli than their counterparts in C. elegans or the first member of the subfamily, TRPV1. However, subsequent studies have recently demonstrated that the mammalian TRPV4 channels may be sensitive to temperature, displaying a temperature-dependent activation between 30 and 43 °C (22Güler A.D. Lee H. Iida T Shimizu I. Tominaga M. Caterina M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6408-6414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Watanabe H. Vriens J Suh S.H. Benham C.D. Droogmans G. Nilius B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47044-47051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Because temperature is a dominant modulator of biological processes, it may be that temperature also serves to modulate the gating properties of the mammalian TRPV4 homologues to enhance its sensitivity to activation by microenvironmental physical/mechanical and chemical stimuli. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether temperature plays a critical role in modulating the sensitivity of the TRPV4 channel to microenvironmental chemical and physical stresses or stimuli. The TRPV4 channel was cloned from mouse M-1 kidney cells and expressed in heterologous expression systems. Elevation of the temperature from 22–24 to 37 °C was found to impart a critical sensitivity to this channel for chemical and physical stimuli, uncovering a diversity of gating signals. Indeed, at 37 °C the channel was found to be highly sensitive to osmotic stress, as shown by others, and to mechanical stress (shear stress). In addition, the channel was shown to be sensitive to phorbol ester derivatives but through two divergent transduction pathways, namely a PKC-dependent pathway and a PKC-independent pathway. Pharmacological characterization of the channel displayed potent blockage by ruthenium red but not by Gd3+ or La3+. Parts of this study have been presented in abstract form (24Goa X. Wu L. O'Neil R.G. FASEB J. 2003; 17: A1229Google Scholar). Cloning of the TRPV4 Channel—The full-length TRPV4 cDNA coding region was obtained using homology-based reverse transcription-PCR amplification procedures and designed primer sets (SuperScript III First Strand Synthesis System for reverse transcription-PCR; Invitrogen) from mRNA isolated (RNeasy kit; Qiagen) from mouse M-1 cells (American Type Tissue Culture). The full-length cDNA was ligated into the pcDNA3.1/V5-His vector (Invitrogen, Inc.) and fused with a 14-amino acid V5 epitope on the C-terminal end of the TRPV4 cDNA using the TOPO™ cloning technique (pcDNA3.1/V5-His TOPO™ TA expression kit; Invitrogen) to provide the pcDNA3.1/TRPV4-V5 plasmid. The recombinant pcDNA3.1/TRPV4-V5 plasmid was transformed into chemically competent TOP10 Escherichia coli cells using standard chemical transformation procedures. Up to 10 positive colonies were selected, and the plasmid DNA was isolated using the QIAprep® Spin miniprep kit (Qiagen). The plasmid DNA was analyzed by sequencing with designed sequencing primers (sequenced by SeqWright, Inc.) to verify the TRPV4 cDNA insert size and orientation. The full-length sequence was identical to that previously reported (17Strotmann R. Harteneck C. Nunnenmacher K. Schultz G. Plant T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar, 18Wissenbach U. Bödding M. Freichel M. Flockerzi V. FEBS Lett. 2000; 485: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and TRPV4 Expression—HEK 293 cells and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were used. HEK 293 cells were grown in standard Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium at 37 °C (with 2 mm l-glutamine), pH 7.4, and CHO cells were grown in modified Ham's F-12 medium at 37 °C, pH 7.4, containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma). The pcDNA3.1/TRPV4-V5 plasmid was initially transiently transfected into HEK 293 cells and CHO cells using the lipid-mediated LipofectAMINE™ 2000 kit (Invitrogen). Transfections using both positive controls, pcDNA3.1/V5-His vector containing a LacZα cDNA insert with the fused V5 epitope, and negative controls, without an insert, were performed to verify the cloning and transfection procedures. With transient transfections for 48–72 h, ∼30–60% of the HEK 293 cells and CHO cells were transfected based on immunohistochemical identification of the number of cells expressing the V5 epitope (see “Immunohistochemistry and Immunoblotting” below). To facilitate the study, stably transfected cells were established by selection of transfected cells with Geneticin (Invitrogen). The stable transfected cell lines were evaluated using immunohistochemical identification based on the expression of the V5 epitope and functional identification of cells positively responding (intracellular calcium change) to channel stimuli (e.g. hypotonic medium and 4α-PDD) as established by others (Refs. 16Liedtke W. Choe Y. Marti-Renom M.A. Bell A.M. Denis C.S. Sali A. Hudspeth A.J. Friedman J.M. Heller S.

Functional evaluation of TRPV4 activation, using known channel stimuli to activate the channel (e.g. hypotonic medium or 4α-PDD), likewise demonstrated cells expressing the channel. Immunohistochemistry and Immunoblotting—Immunohistochemical localization of expressed TRPV4 protein with the C-terminal V5 epitope was assessed using an anti-V5 antibody conjugated to FITC (anti-V5-FITC; Invitrogen). Briefly, the cells were grown on coverslips, washed with PBS, fixed in 100% methanol (room temperature) for 5 min, blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS, and then incubated with anti-V5-FITC antibody diluted (1:500) in 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS for 1 h. After washing with PBS, VectraShield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) was applied, the coverslip was placed on a glass slide, and the cells were visualized on a Nikon Diaphot epifluorescence microscope (FITC filter set) and digitally photographed. To provide further assessment of TRPV4 expression, immunoblotting of cell homogenates was performed as previously described (25Liu X. Zhang M.I.N. Peterson L.B. O'Neil R.G. FEBS Lett. 2003; 538: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), taking advantage of the C-terminal V5 epitope. Total protein aliquots (5–10 μg) were separated by 6% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto activated polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences). After transfer, the polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were blocked with Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 (0.05%) containing 5% nonfat milk for 1 h with gentle rocking. The anti-V5 antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (anti-V5-HRP; Invitrogen) was applied (1:1000) in blocking buffer for 1 h, then washed with Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 (0.05%), and visualized on ECL Hyperfilm using an ECL detection reagent chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). Measurement of Intracellular Calcium—The intracellular calcium levels ([Ca2+]i) were quantitatively monitored in cultured cells using the fura-2 fluorescence technique as described previously (26O'Neil R.G. Leng L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F120-F128PubMed Google Scholar, 27Zhang M.I.N. O'Neil R.G. Cell Calcium. 2001; 29: 263-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK and CHO cells grown on coverslips were loaded with fura-2 by incubation of the cells with 5–10 μm fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester in culture medium for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed with isotonic medium (ISO, see “Solutions and Chemicals” below) and incubated an additional 10–15 min to abolish compartmentalization of fura-2/AM in cells. The coverslips, with fura-2-loaded cells, were attached to the bottom of a custom designed perfusion chamber (1.5 ml) or a shear stress chamber (see below) as appropriate, and the chamber was attached to the microscope stage of our InCa Imaging Work station (Intracellular Imaging, Inc.). The temperatures were maintained by continuous flow through of heated bathing solutions or by exchange of preheated bathing solutions. The cells were bathed in either ISO or hypotonic (HYPO) medium as defined below (see “Solutions and Chemicals”). Typically 10–30 cells were simultaneously monitored on a coverslip, and the results were averaged for each experiment. Intracellular calcium was estimated from the fura-2 fluorescence by excitation at 340 and 380 nm and calculating the ratio of the emission intensities at 511 nm in the usual manner every 1–3 s. The fura-2 fluorescence ratios were converted to intracellular calcium activity ([Ca2+]i) as described by Grynkiewicz et al. (28Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). [Ca2+]i=βKd[(R-Rmin)/(Rmax-R)](Eq. 1) where R is the ratio at any time and β is the ratio of the fluorescence emission intensity at 380 nm excitation in Ca2+-depleting and Ca2+-saturating conditions. K d is the Ca2+ dissociation constant of fura-2 (K d = 220 nm). R min is the minimum ratio in Ca2+-depleting conditions (addition of 5 mm EGTA and 2 μm ionomycin), and R max is the maximum ratio in Ca2+-saturating conditions (2 μm ionomycin plus 5 mm Ca2+) determined under the conditions of the experiment. Shear Stress—For measurement of the effects of shear stress on TRPV4 channel activation, the cells grown on coverslips were attached to the bottom of a Flexcell Flow chamber (Flexcell International, Inc.), and the chamber was attached to the microscope stage of the InCa Imaging Work station as described above. Solution (ISO or HYPO) flow through the chamber was regulated by a peristaltic pump (0–75 ml/min) to generate shear stresses from 0 to 20 dyne/cm2 while simultaneously monitoring intracellular calcium levels in individual cells (typically 10–30 cells), and the results were averaged for each coverslip. Patch Clamp Current Measurements—The patch clamp technique in whole cell configuration was used for measurements of whole cell currents using an Axon Instruments Axopatch-1D voltage clamp (with Bessel filter, 2 kHz) interfaced to a Digidata 1322A data acquisition system using pClamp 8 software (Axon Instruments) as done previously (36Zhang M.I.N. O'Neil R.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 40: C1757-C1764Crossref Google Scholar). Patch pipette electrodes, fabricated with a Narashige PP-83 micropipette puller and MF-83 Microforge, had resistances of 2–4MΩ (see pipette solution below under “Solutions and Chemicals”). The reference electrode was a 3 m KCl agar bridge inserted into a continuously flowing bath solution downstream from the patch electrode. Series resistance was compensated electronically by 40–80%. The temperature of the electrophysiological bathing solution (see “Solutions and Chemicals” below) was maintained at 37 °C using a direct current-regulated in-line heating jacket (Warner Instruments) to warm the bathing solution as it entered the study chamber. Typically all current recording was done at a holding potential of -60 mV (sampling rate of 5 kHz, filtered at 2 kHz) with a voltage ramp protocol applied every 10 s as done by others (21Watanabe H. Davis J.B. Smart D. Jerman J.C. Smith G.D. Hayes P. Vriens J. cairns W. Wissenbach U. Prenen J. Flockerzi V. Droogmans G. Benham C.D. Nilius B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13569-13577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). The voltage ramp protocol was initiated by a voltage step to -100 mV for 20 ms, followed by a 400-ms ramp from -100 to +100 mV (sampling interval of 0.2 ms) and returning to the holding potential of -60 mV. Solutions and Chemicals—HEK 293 or CHO cells were washed and bathed in modified balanced salt solutions for all functional studies assessing intracellular calcium levels. Cells were either bathed in an ISO or HYPO as appropriate. The ISO contained 140 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm MgSO4, 3.3 mm NaHCO3, 2.0 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 5.5 mm glucose, pH 7.4, having an osmolarity of 300 mOsm/liter. The HYPO was identical, except the NaCl concentration was reduced to 100 mm, reducing the osmolarity to 225 mOsm/liter. For electrophysiogical studies measuring whole cell currents, the extracellular bathing medium was 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4. The patch pipette solution was 100 mm cesium aspartate, 20 mm CsCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 4 mm Na2ATP, 0.037 mm CaCl2, 5 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. PMA (Sigma), a PKC-activating phorbol ester, and 4 α-PDD (Sigma), a non-PKC-activating phorbol ester, were used at 100 nm (100 μm stock in Me2SO), and RR (Sigma), a channel blocker, was used at concentrations of 1–10 μm (10 mm stock in water). The drugs were diluted in medium and sonicated just before use. Cal C (Calbiochem), a relatively selective inhibitor of PKCs, and staurosporine (Sigma), a broad spectrum PKC inhibitor, were used at concentrations of 50 nm (0.1 mm stock in Me2SO) and either 50/500 nm (1 mm stock in Me2SO), respectively. All other chemicals were from Sigma unless otherwise noted. Statistics—Intracellular calcium levels were measured in individual cells for each experiment on a given coverslip, and the results were averaged to provide a single experimental run. Hence, for this study n is the number of experimental runs (i.e. number of coverslips). For electrophysiological studies, each current measurement was from a single cell. The pooled data are given as the means ± S.E. The significance differences between groups were tested with Student's paired or unpaired t test, as appropriate. p ≤ 0.05 was assumed to be significant. Expression of TRPV4—Expression of the TRPV4 protein in HEK 293 cells and CHO cells was readily detected with the anti-V5-FITC antibody. As shown Fig. 1 (A and D), in TRPV4-transfected cells (T-HEK and T-CHO), TRPV4 protein expression was readily detected within the cells. The channel was shown to be highly expressed in the perinuclear region of both the HEK 293 and CHO cells, reflecting expression in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus and in the plasma membrane. As evident in the figure, detection of protein expression via the V5 epitope construct in the present study permitted excellent assessment of protein localization at the plasma membrane. In the absence of transfection (HEK and CHO), binding of the anti-V5-FITC antibody was not evident, demonstrating little, or an absence of, expression of the TRPV4-V5 construct. The observed pattern of expression is consistent with the results noted by others where a TRPV4 construct was employed utilizing green fluorescent protein, a relatively large protein, attached to the C terminus as a fluorescent tag (17Strotmann R. Harteneck C. Nunnenmacher K. Schultz G. Plant T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar, 18Wissenbach U. Bödding M. Freichel M. Flockerzi V. FEBS Lett. 2000; 485: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The TRPV4 protein was also characterized by immunoblotting, again taking advantage of the V5 epitope construct and the anti-V5-HRP antibody for detection. As shown in Fig. 1 (C and F), a single protein band was detected in both transfected HEK 293 and CHO cells, whereas no bands were evident in nontransfected cells. The molecular mass of the band in both transfected HEK 293 and CHO cells was estimated to be near 100 kDa. Because this construct includes the fused C-terminal segment containing the V5 epitope and accessory domains, the actual TRPV4 protein size on immunoblots is near 95 kDa. Effect of Temperature on Basal Calcium Levels—The functional properties of the TRPV4 channel were assessed from measured changes in intracellular calcium levels, [Ca2+]i, following channel activation. Measurement of [Ca2+]i levels in these cells using the fura-2 fluorescent methods was uncomplicated in the present study because expression of the TRPV4 construct with the V5 epitope does not produce a fluorescence tag and hence does not interfere with the fura-2 (or fluo-3) signal, in contrast to that observed for the green fluorescent protein tag (29Berkova Z. Morris A.P. Estes M.K. Cell Calcium. 2003; 360: 1-14Google Scholar). Initial studies focused on the effect of changing the study temperature from room temperature (22–24 °C) to 37 °C without the addition of known channel activators. As shown in Fig. 2, at room temperature [Ca2+]i levels in nontransfected and TRPV4-transfected cells were low, averaging 35 ± 4 and 44 ± 4 nm for nontransfected and transfected HEK 293 cells, respectively, and 48 ± 14 and 58 ± 7 nm for nontransfected and transfected CHO cells, respectively. At 37 °C, [Ca2+]i levels were elevated for both nontransfected and transfected cells, averaging 82 ± 10 and 86 ± 12 nm for nontransfected and transfected HEK 293 cells, respectively, and 103 ± 6 and 108 ± 14 nm for nontransfected and transfected CHO cells, respectively. Hence, under the conditions of the present studies where cells were incubated at two different stable temperatures, transfection alone did not appear to result in a measurable change in the basal, steady-state [Ca2+]i levels, although considerable cell-to-cell variability was evident. In all subsequent experiments, the effect of temperature on TRPV4 activation was evaluated primarily in HEK 293 cells, with only a few confirmatory studies performed in CHO cells. Temperature-modulated Gating of TRPV4 by Phorbol Esters—It has been shown previously that phorbol ester derivatives, such as PMA and 4α-PDD, can activate TRPV4 by a PKC-independent mechanism (21Watanabe H.

Proteolytic degradation of Smad1 and Cbfa1 is proteasome-dependent, and intracellular concentrations of Smad1 and Cbfa1 are enhanced by inhibition of the 26 S proteasome. Smad1 degradation is mediated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Smurf1 (Smad ubiquitin regulatory factor 1), but the specific E3 ligase responsible for Cbfa1 degradation has not been identified. Because Cbfa1 interacts with Smad1, whose degradation is mediated by Smurf1, we examined the effect of Smurf1 on Cbfa1 degradation in osteoblast precursor cells. Smurf1 interacts directly with Cbfa1 and mediates Cbfa1 degradation in a ubiquitin- and proteasome-dependent manner. Because Smurf1 controls the intracellular concentrations of several key molecules in the bone formation cascade, we examined the effect of a mutant form of Smurf1 in osteoblasts and found that expression of mutant Smurf1 markedly enhanced osteoblas tdifferentiation. Smurf1 therefore appears to be an important regulatory factor in osteoblast differentiation and a potential molecular target for identification of bone anabolic agents.

Smurf1 therefore appears to be an important regulatory factor in osteoblast differentiation and a potential molecular target for identification of bone anabolic agents. Bone formation is regulated by a number of growth regulatory factors, key signal transduction molecules, and critical transcription factors. Important among these are the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), 1The abbreviations used are: BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; Cbfa1, Core-binding factor α1; Smad, Sma/Mother against decapentaplegic; Smurf1, Smad ubiquitin regulatory factor 1; PS1, proteasome inhibitor 1; SBE, Smad1 binding element; caBMPR-IB, constitutively active type IB BMP receptor; OC, osteocalcin; ALP, alkaline phosphatase; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; HA, hemagglutinin. which promote normal appositional bone growth and induce ectopic bone formation experimentally (1Wozney J.M.

BMP-2 and -4 act through a complex serine-threonine kinase receptor mechanism to activate the signal transduction molecules Smad1 and -5, which in turn activate downstream target genes with other transcription factors. The mechanism of action and regulation of BMP signaling molecules during osteoblast differentiation are not fully defined. Cbfa1 2Other names for Cbfa1/Runx2 are PEBP2αA, AML-3, and Osf-2. is a transcription factor that belongs to the runt-domain gene family and plays an essential role in osteoblast differentiation, bone development, and postnatal bone formation (2Ducy P.

BMPs may stimulate osteoblast differentiation by activating Cbfa1 through Smad1, as evidenced by reports that Smad1, the downstream effector of BMP signaling, directly interacts with Cbfa1 (7Hanai J.I.

The activities of signaling proteins and transcription factors are regulated at both the transcriptional and post-translational levels. Recent reports (8Zhu H. Kavsak P. Abdollah S. Wrana J. Thomsen G.H.A. Nature. 1999; 400: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 9Zhang Y. Chang C. Gehling D.J. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Derynck R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 28875-28879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) demonstrate that both Smad1 and Cbfa1 undergo ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation. Protein ubiquitination involves a cascade of enzymatic reactions catalyzed by the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme, the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, and the E3 ubiquitin ligases (11Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar), which play a crucial role in defining substrate specificity and subsequent protein degradation by the 26 S proteasomes. Smurf1 is a member of the Hect family of E3 ubiquitin ligases and has been found to interact with the BMP-activated Smad1 and -5, thereby triggering their ubiquitination and degradation (8Zhu H. Kavsak P. Abdollah S. Wrana J. Thomsen G.H.A. Nature. 1999; 400: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Hect domain proteins represent a major subclass of E3 ligases and contain a conserved cysteine located at the carboxylterminal of the Hect domain that is capable of forming a thioester bond with ubiquitin (8Zhu H. Kavsak P. Abdollah S. Wrana J. Thomsen G.H.A. Nature. 1999; 400: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 12Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). Another motif often found in the Hect family of E3 ligase is the WW domain, which contains two highly conserved tryptophans and a conserved proline in an ∼30-amino acid region (8Zhu H. Kavsak P. Abdollah S. Wrana J. Thomsen G.H.A. Nature. 1999; 400: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 13Rotin D. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 228: 115-133PubMed Google Scholar). The WW domains have a preference for binding to small proline-rich sequences, PPXY motifs, and different WW domains possess different substrate specificity. Although Cbfa1 has been reported to be degraded through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (10Tintut Y. Parhami F. Le V. Karsenty G. Demer L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28875-28879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), the specific E3 ubiquitin ligase for Cbfa1 has not been identified. In the present studies, we examined the relationship between Smad1, Cbfa1, and Smurf1 in osteoblast precursor cells. Smad1 interacts directly with Cbfa1 in these cells, and both Smad1 and Cbfa1 are required for BMP-2 signaling. The intracellular concentrations of both Smad1 and Cbfa1 are dependent on osteoblast proteasomal function. Smurf1 mediates Cbfa1 degradation in a ubiquitin proteasome-dependent manner and therefore is a powerful regulator of osteoblast differentiation. Expression Plasmids—Myc-tagged Smad1 expression plasmid was obtained from Dr. R. Nishimura (Department of Biochemistry, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan), and FLAG-tagged Smurf1 and mutant Smurf1 (C710A) cDNA plasmids in SK vector were obtained from Dr. G. Thomsen and cloned into pcDNA3 expression vector. Cbfa1 cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR based on mouse Cbfa1 cDNA sequences (GenBank™ accession number AF010284) using RNA extracted from 2T3 osteoblast precursor cells and then cloned into p3×FLAG-CMV vector (Sigma). The 6×OSE2-OC-pGL3 reporter construct was generated by PCR as described by Ducy et al. (2Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3647) Google Scholar). The constitutively active type IB BMP receptor (caBMPR-IB) expression plasmid was obtained from Dr. J. Wrana (Program in Molecular Biology and Cancer, Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Canada). The HA-ubiquitin expression plasmid was obtained from Dr. X. Cao (Department of Pathology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Alabama). Cell Culture and Transfections—C2C12 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and 2T3 osteoblast precursor cells were cultured in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 8% fetal calf serum. The cDNA expression plasmids were transiently transfected into these cells using LipofectAMINE Plus reagents (Invitrogen) in a 10-cm-diameter culture dish for immunoprecipitation assay, 6-well culture plates for Western blotting analysis, and 24-well plates for the luciferase assay. 5, 1, and 0.2 μg of expression plasmid were used for these transfections. After transfection (48 h), cells were lysed with lysis buffer. In proteasome inhibitor experiments, transfected cells were incubated with the proteasome inhibitors for 2, 6, or 24 h, the proteasome inhibitor was removed, and the cells were then cultured an additional 24 h. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Expression plasmids were transfected into C2C12 cells separately or together for immunoprecipitation. In Western analysis, the total amounts of transfected plasmids in each group were equalized by addition of empty vector cDNA. 48 h after transfection, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% doc, and 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5). For Western blotting, 0.1% SDS was included in the lysis buffer. The protease inhibitors aprotinin (10 μg/ml), leupeptin (10 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm) were added to the lysis buffer. Cell lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C at 10,000 × g and incubated with anti-Myc antibody for 4 h at 4 °C, followed by immunoprecipitation with protein G-agarose (Roche Applied Science) at 4 °C overnight. Immunoprecipitates were washed with lysis buffer five times, added to 1× reducing buffer containing 0.5 m β-mercaptoethanol, and boiled for 3 min. The immunoprecipitation and Western blotting samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, immunoblotted with anti-FLAG or anti-Myc antibody, and visualized with horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse IgG antibody (Amersham Biosciences) with an enhancement by ECL detection kits (Amersham Biosciences). A monoclonal antibody against human Smad1 and a polyclonal antibody against human Smurf1 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA. A polyclonal antibody against human Cbfa1 was purchased from Oncogene Research Product, Cambridge, MA. Luciferase Assay—Oligonucleotides containing 6 copies of Cbfa1 response element, OSE2, (6×OSE2) and 12 copies of Smad1 binding element (12×SBE) were synthesized in the DNA laboratory at The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. The oligonucleotides were cloned in front of the osteocalcin basal promoter (–155/+1), which was amplified by RT-PCR, and cloned in pGL3 vector. C2C12 and 2T3 cells were co-transfected with Cbfa1 expression plasmid and 6×OSE2-OC-pGL3 reporter plasmid in the presence or absence of Smurf1 or mutant Smurf1 expression plasmid. caBMPR-IB and Smad1 expression plasmids were co-transfected with 12×SBE-OC-luc or 12×SBE-SV40-luc in the presence or absence of mutant Cbfa1. Cell lysates were extracted 48 h later, and luciferase activity was measured and normalized by β-galactosidase activity. Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) Activity and Osteocalcin Production— C2C12 and 2T3 cells were plated into 6-well culture plates grown to 60% confluency, transfected transiently with Smurf1 or mutant Smurf1 expression plasmids using LipofectAMINE Plus reagents (Invitrogen), or treated with proteasome inhibitors. 48 h after transfection, the medium was collected; the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and cell lysates were extracted with 0.05% Triton X-100. ALP activity in cell lysates was measured using a Sigma ALP assay kit (Sigma), and osteocalcin in the medium was measured with a mouse osteocalcin immunoradiometric assay (IRMA) kit (Immutopics, Inc., San Clemente, CA). Calvarial Periosteal Bone Formation Assay—Proteasome inhibitor 1 (PS1) was injected subcutaneously over the parietal bone of the calvariae of 2-month-old ICR Swiss mice (14Chen D. Harris M.A. Rossini G. Dunstan C.R. Dallas S.L. Feng J.Q. Mundy G.R. Harris S.E. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1997; 60: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Mice received either vehicle (20 μl of phosphate-buffered saline) alone or PS1 (0.2, 1, and 5 mg/kg/day, daily for 5 days). Mice were sacrificed 14 days after commencing injections, and calvarial bones were removed. The bones were decalcified in 14% EDTA, bisected coronally midway between the coronal and lambdoid sutures, dehydrated through graded alcohols, and embedded in paraffin. Transverse 3-μm-thick sections were cut and stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin. Newly formed bone was identified histologically using an E400 microscope (Nikon Inc., Melville, NY) linked to a color video monitor (PVM-14M2MDU Trinitron, Sony Corp., Japan) and image capture techniques. Smurf1 Mediates Cbfa1 Degradation in Osteoblasts—Because Cbfa1 interacts with Smad1 protein (7Hanai J.I. Chen L.F. Kanno T. Ohtani-Fujita N. Kim W.Y. Guo W.-H. Imamura T. Ishidou Y. Fukuchi M.

Nature. 1999; 400: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of Smurf1 on Cbfa1 degradation in myoblast/osteoblast precursor C2C12 cells and osteoblast precursor 2T3 cells. FLAG-tagged Cbfa1 expression plasmid was co-transfected with different amounts of Smurf1 expression plasmid into C2C12 and 2T3 cells. Expression of Smurf1 greatly reduced steady-state levels of Cbfa1 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1a). Expression of an unrelated Hect domain E3 ligase, Itch, with Cbfa1 had no effect on the degradation of Cbfa1 (data not shown), suggesting that Smurf1-mediated Cbfa1 degradation is a specific effect of the ligase. To determine whether Smurf1 mediates endogenous Cbfa1 degradation, 2T3 cells were transfected with Smurf1 expression plasmid. Expression of endogenous Cbfa1 protein was detected by Western blot analysis using an antibody against human Cbfa1. Transfection of Smurf1 reduced Cbfa1 protein levels in 2T3 cells (Fig. 1b), suggesting that Smurf1 mediates degradation of endogenous Cbfa1 protein. To determine whether Smurf1-mediated degradation of Cbfa1 is ubiquitin-dependent, we co-transfected Smurf1, Cbfa1, and ubiquitin expression plasmids in C2C12 cells. After immunoprecipitating the Cbfa1 protein, a typical ubiquitinated Cbfa1 protein ladder was observed (Fig. 1c), indicating that Smurf1-mediated Cbfa1 degradation is ubiquitin-dependent. To examine whether Smurf1-mediated degradation of Cbfa1 is proteasome-dependent, we treated transfected C2C12 cells with 1 μm PS1 for 2 h. Expression of Smurf1 resulted in total degradation of Cbfa1, an effect completely abolished by treatment with PS1 (Fig. 1d). Similar results were obtained when another structurally different proteasome inhibitor, epoxomicin, was used (data not shown). These results demonstrate that Smurf1-mediated Cbfa1 degradation is proteasome-dependent. To determine whether Smurf1 physically interacts with Cbfa1, Cbfa1, and mutant Smurf1 (ΔSmurf1, C710A), expression plasmids were co-transfected into C2C12 cells. Because it is known that Smurf1 mediates the degradation of proteins with which it interacts (8Zhu H. Kavsak P. Abdollah S. Wrana J. Thomsen G.H.A. Nature. 1999; 400: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar), we attempted to stabilize the protein complex with Smurf1 using an expression plasmid of the catalytic point mutant of Smurf1 (ΔSmurf1) as described by Zhu et al. (8Zhu H. Kavsak P. Abdollah S. Wrana J. Thomsen G.H.A. Nature. 1999; 400: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Using epitope-tagged proteins in co-immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses, we found that Cbfa1 co-precipitates with ΔSmurf1 (Fig. 1e). A putative PY motif, presumably bound with the WW domain of Smurf1 protein, was found in the carboxyl-terminal of Cbfa1, suggesting that Smurf1 directly binds Cbfa1 and mediates its degradation. To determine whether Smurf1-mediated Cbfa1 degradation causes functional changes in Cbfa1, we examined the ability of Cbfa1 to activate a specific reporter gene, 6×OSE2-OC-Luc (15Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar), in C2C12 cells. A Cbfa1 expression plasmid and 6×OSE2-OC-Luc reporter construct were co-transfected into C2C12 cells in the presence and absence of Smurf1 or ΔSmurf1. Expression of Cbfa1 significantly increased activity of 6×OSE2-OC-Luc reporter, whereas co-transfection of Smurf1 with Cbfa1 significantly reduced Cbfa1-induced luciferase activity of this reporter gene. In contrast, co-transfection of ΔSmurf1, lacking in catalytic activity, had no significant effect on Cbfa1-induced luciferase activity of the reporter gene (Fig. 1f). These results demonstrate that Smurf1 mediates Cbfa1 degradation and leads to a decrease in Cbfa1 activity. That there was no significant effect of ΔSmurf1 on Cbfa1-induced luciferase activity of the reporter gene may be because activation of the reporter gene by expressed Cbfa1 had already plateaued. Because it has been reported that Cbfa1 degradation is cAMP-dependent in osteoblasts (10Tintut Y. Parhami F. Le V. Karsenty G. Demer L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28875-28879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), in the present studies we also treated C2C12 cells with forskolin, an agent that stimulates adenylyl cyclase and examined expression of endogenous Smurf1, Cbfa1 degradation, and the effect of ΔSmurf1 on forskolin-induced Cbfa1 degradation. Although forskolin treatment increased endogenous Smurf1 level only slightly (Fig. 2a), Cbfa1 protein level was significantly reduced by forskolin; this reduction was blocked in cells transfected with ΔSmurf1 (Fig. 2b). These results suggest that Smurf1 may be involved in the cAMP-induced Cbfa1 degradation. Smurf1 Mediates Smad1 Degradation in Osteoblasts—Although Smurf1 has been shown to mediate Smad1 degradation in COS cells transfected with a Smad1 expression plasmid, the effects of Smurf1 on Smad1 degradation in osteoblasts, and in particular degradation of endogenous Smad1 protein by proteasomal-dependent mechanism in osteoblasts, have not been examined. In the present studies, we confirmed the effect of Smurf1 on Smad1 degradation in osteoblast precursor cells and examined the regulatory roles of proteasome inhibitors on Smad1 protein. We first examined the effect of Smurf1 on steady-state protein levels of Smad1 in C2C12 and 2T3 cells and found that Smurf1 mediates Smad1 degradation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3a). The effect of Smurf1 on Smad1 degradation is ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent because the catalytic mutant of Smurf1 (C710A) had only minor effects on Smad1 degradation (Fig. 3b) and the proteasome inhibitor epoxomicin reversed the effect of Smurf1 on Smad1 degradation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3c). Similar effects were observed when other structurally different proteasome inhibitors such as PS1, lactacystin, and MG-132 were utilized (data not shown). To further determine the effects of proteasome inhibitors on the steady-state protein levels of endogenous Smad1, the C2C12 cells were treated with different proteasome inhibitors for 6 h. The treatment with proteasome inhibitors increased Smad1 levels 2– 6-fold (Fig. 3d), demonstrating that Smad1 is under Smurf1-mediated ubiquitin-proteasome regulation in osteoblasts. Cbfa1 Is Required for Activation of BMP-2 Signaling—Cbfa1 has been reported to interact with Smad1, but details of the transactivation mechanism of these two signaling molecules have not been clearly defined. Therefore, we examined whether Cbfa1 is specifically required for BMP signaling by first confirming the interaction of Cbfa1 with Smad1 in osteoblast precursor cells. Epitope-tagged Cbfa1 and Smad1 expression plasmids were co-transfected into C2C12 and 2T3 cells. Co-precipitation of Cbfa1 and Smad1 was detected in both cells (Fig. 4a). To determine the role of Cbfa1 in BMP signaling, we generated multiple copies of Smad1 response element (12×SBE) and cloned those upstream of an osteocalcin and a SV40 basal promoter. Treatment of BMP-2 or expression of caBMPR-IB stimulated luciferase activity of the 12×SBE-OC-Luc reporter but not the 12×SBE-SV40-Luc reporter (Fig. 4b). Because the osteocalcin basal promoter contains one copy of the Cbfa1 response element (OSE2), we next examined whether binding of Cbfa1 to this response element in the osteocalcin basal promoter is required for BMP-2 signaling. A mutant Cbfa1 (ΔCbfa1) expression plasmid was generated as described by Ducy et al. (5Ducy P. Starbuck M. Priemel M. Shen J. Pinero G. Geoffroy V. Amling M. Karsenty M. Gene Dev. 1999; 13: 1025-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar), and C2C12 cells were transfected with caBMPR-IB expression plasmid and the 12×SBE-OC-Luc reporter construct with or without ΔCbfa1. Expression of ΔCbfa1 completely blocked the effect of caBMPR-IB on the 12×SBE-OC-Luc reporter (Fig. 4c). caBMPR-IB or BMP-2 had only minor effects on the osteocalcin basal promoter (data not shown). To further define the role of Cbfa1 in BMP signaling, the OSE2 site in the osteocalcin basal promoter was mutated. The 12×SBE-OC-Luc reporter with OSE2 mutation (12×SBE-ΔOC) completely lost its response to BMP-2 or caBMPR-IB (Fig. 4d). These results suggest that Cbfa1 is required for BMP-2 and Smad1 to activate downstream target genes in osteoblasts. Function of Smurf1 in Osteoblast Differentiation—To examine the function of Smurf1 in osteoblast differentiation, a Smurf1 or ΔSmurf1 expression plasmid was transfected into C2C12 cells, and ALP activity and osteocalcin production were measured. Expression of Smurf1 significantly reduced ALP activity as well as osteocalcin production in C2C12 cells (data not shown). In contrast, transfection of ΔSmurf1 increased basal as well as BMP-2-induced ALP activity and osteocalcin production in these cells (Fig. 5, a and b). Similar results were obtained when the same expression plasmids were transfected into 2T3 cells (data not shown). These results suggest that Smurf1 mediates Cbfa1 and Smad1 degradation and inhibits function of Cbfa1 and Smad1. ΔSmurf1 acts in a dominant-negative fashion to inhibit the degradation of Cbfa1 and Smad1. To establish a correlation between Smurf1-mediated Smad1 degradation and osteoblast differentiation, we analyzed changes in endogenous Smad1 protein after C2C12 and 2T3 cells were transfected with mutant Smurf1 or treated with proteasome inhibitors. We found that proteasome inhibitors increase endogenous Smad1 levels 2– 6-fold (Fig. 3d). Transfection of ΔSmurf1 causes a 5-fold increase in protein levels of endogenous Smad1. Overexpression of Smad1 (6-fold higher than endogenous Smad1) significantly enhanced ALP activity and osteocalcin production in C2C12 cells (Fig. 5, a and b). These results suggest that enhanced Smad1 levels by ΔSmurf1 or proteasome inhibitors promote osteoblast differentiation. Proteasome Inhibitors Induce Osteoblast Differentiation and Bone Formation—To further determine the role of proteasome inhibitors in osteoblast function and bone formation, we examined the effects of PS1, a synthetic proteasome inhibitor, on ALP activity and the BMP signaling reporter in C2C12 cells and on periosteal bone formation in rodents in vivo. We found that in C2C12 cells, treatment with PS1 increased ALP activity (Fig. 6a) and luciferase activity of the 12×SBE-OC-Luc reporter (Fig. 6b) in a dose-dependent manner. Increasing concentrations of PS1 (0.2, 1, and 5 mg/kg/day) were injected daily for 5 days into subcutaneous tissues over the calvariae of mice. The mice were sacrificed 2 weeks after the injections, and calvariae were processed for histology. PS1 induced significant new bone formation (Fig. 6, c and d). Similar effects were also obtained when epoxomicin, a naturally occurring proteasome inhibitor, was administered in vivo (data not shown). Moreover, these proteasome inhibitors administered systemically stimulated bone formation in intact and ovariectomized mice (16Garrett I.R. Chen D. Gutierrez G. Zhao M. Harris S.E. Rossini G. Escobedo A. Kim K.B. Hu S. Crews C.M. Mundy G.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 1771-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that inhibition of Smurf1 and proteasome degradation can lead to increased osteoblast function and suggest that part of the mechanism of proteasome inhibitor on new bone formation may be due to regulation of intracellular protein levels of Cbfa1 and Smad1. We have demonstrated for the first time that 1) E3 ubiquitin ligase Smurf1 mediates Cbfa1 degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, 2) Cbfa1 is required for BMP-2 signaling, and 3) expression of mutant Smurf1 stimulates osteoblast differentiation. These findings suggest that Smurf1 plays an important role in osteoblast differentiation by regulating Cbfa1 and Smad1 function. Cbfa1 is a critical transcription factor in osteoblast differentiation and function (2Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3647) Google Scholar). BMPs have been shown to stimulate osteoblast differentiation in vitro and in vivo (1Wozney J.M. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1992; 32: 160-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar), in part by up-regulating Cbfa1 expression (2Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G.

Smad1 is a downstream mediator of BMP receptors and plays a central role in BMP receptor signaling (17Hoodless P.A. Haerry T. Abdollah S. Stapleton M. O'Connor M.B. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 489-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). In the present studies, we found that Cbfa1 is required to activate BMP-2 signaling. It has been reported (18Leboy P. Grasso-Knight G. D'Angelo M. Volk S.W. Lian J.V. Drissi H. Stein G.S. Adams S.L. J. Bone Jt. Surg. Am. Vol. 2001; 83: S15-S22PubMed Google Scholar, 19Chikazu D. Li X.

Res. 2002; 17: 1430-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) that Smad1 and Cbfa1 binding sites co-localize in the promoters of several bone-related genes. Taken together with our results, this suggests that Smad1 and Cbfa1 co-activate downstream target genes in osteoblasts. Expression of mutant Smurf1 inhibits forskolin-induced Cbfa1 degradation in C2C12 cells, suggesting that Smurf1 may be involved in Cbfa1 degradation induced by a cAMP-dependent protein kinase pathway. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) induces proteasomal degradation of protein substrates in osteoblasts (20Murray E.J.B. Bentley G.V. Grisanti M.S. Murray S.S. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 460-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and it has recently been reported that the anabolic effect of PTH requires Cbfa1-dependent signaling (21Krishnan V. Moore T.L. Ma Y.L. Helvering L.M. Frolik C.A. Valasek K.M. Ducy P. Geiser A.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 423-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). We speculate that PTH may induce Cbfa1 degradation via cAMP-dependent signaling and that Smurf1 is involved in this process. However, this remains to be determined. To maintain efficient signal transduction and gene activation, cells must precisely regulate levels of signaling proteins and transcription factors during cellular processes. Under physiological conditions, Smurf1 may mediate degradation of the Cbfa1-Smad1 protein complex, but further investigation is required for unequivocal proof. Because Smurf1 mediates degradation of two critical proteins in the BMP signaling pathway and overexpression of Smurf1 modulates osteoblast differentiation and function, we propose that Smurf1 plays an important role in bone formation in vivo. It has been shown that Smurf mutations in Drosophila lead to enhanced decapentaplegic (a homologue of BMP-2/4) signaling and downstream target gene expression (22Podos S.D. Hanson K.K. Wang Y. Ferguson E.L. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 567-578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Our findings suggest that Smurf1 may be a critical protein regulating Cbfa1 and Smad1 functions and, ultimately, osteoblast differentiation and bone formation.

We have found previously that perturbation of hyaluronan-tumor cell interaction by treatment with hyaluronan oligosaccharides suppresses the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt cell survival signaling pathway in cancer cells and reduces tumor growth in vivo. Here we find that these oligomers suppress both the MAP kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathways in multidrug resistant tumor cells and sensitize these cells to a variety of chemotherapeutic drugs. On the other hand, increased hyaluronan production induces resistance in drug-sensitive tumor cells. Likewise, increased expression of emmprin, which is a glycoprotein that is present on the surface of most malignant cancer cells and that stimulates hyaluronan production, also induces increased resistance. Thus, perturbation of hyaluronan signaling may provide a dual therapeutic role, since it has intrinsic suppressive effects on tumor growth as well as sensitizing cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents.

Multidrug resistance in cancer arises by several mechanisms, among which are activated repair and detoxifying systems, restricted access to or uptake of drugs due to cell adhesion barriers, or enhanced drug efflux via broad specificity, ATP-dependent pumps (1Gottesman M.M. Fojo T. Bates S.E. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 48-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (4443) Google Scholar). “Classical” multidrug resistance is usually due to enhanced drug export by ATP-dependent efflux pumps in the mdr, mrp, and related ABC transporter families. However, it has become increasingly apparent that alterations in cell survival and apoptotic signaling pathways are interconnected at many levels with multidrug resistance mechanisms in cancer cells and that drug resistance in patients may in some cases be overcome by therapeutic interventions that induce downstream events in apoptotic cascades (2Lowe S.W. Lin A.W. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 485-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1549) Google Scholar, 3Makin G. Dive C.

Hyaluronan is a very large, linear glycosaminoglycan composed of repeating disaccharides of glucuronic acid and N-acetylglucosamine. Although hyaluronan is distributed ubiquitously in vertebrate tissues, both in the embryo and in the adult, its organization with respect to cells is variable. In adult tissues such as the vitreous, synovial fluid and the dermis, it clearly plays an extracellular, structural role based on its unique hydrodynamic properties. However, during dynamic cellular events such as inflammation, wound repair, and tissue development, hyaluronan also interacts with cells and influences their behavior in a variety of ways (5Toole B.P. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 12: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 6Turley E.A. Noble P.W. Bourguignon L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4589-4592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). In this context hyaluronan binds cell surface receptors such as CD44 and RHAMM that transduce intracellular signals, thus influencing cellular form and function directly and instructively (6Turley E.A. Noble P.W. Bourguignon L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4589-4592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). In a recent study, we found that perturbation of hyaluronan-cell interactions in malignant cancer cells by treatment with hyaluronan oligosaccharides (∼1200–4000 Da) induces apoptosis under anchorage-independent conditions and reduces tumor growth in vivo (7Ghatak S. Misra S. Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38013-38020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Hyaluronan oligomers compete for endogenous polymeric hyaluronan, thus replacing high affinity, multivalent and cooperative interactions with low affinity, low valency receptor interactions (8Underhill C.B. Chi-Rosso G. Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8086-8091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Lesley J. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. Hyman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26967-26975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that these oligomers suppress the PI 3-kinase 1The abbreviations used are: PI 3-kinase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; BAD136, serine residue 136 of BAD; BAD112, serine residue 112 of BAD; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; BCNU, 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosurea; MAP, mitogen-activated protein.1The abbreviations used are: PI 3-kinase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; BAD136, serine residue 136 of BAD; BAD112, serine residue 112 of BAD; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; BCNU, 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosurea; MAP, mitogen-activated protein./Akt cell survival pathway, leading to proapoptotic events such as decreased phosphorylation of BAD and FKHR, increased PTEN expression, and increased caspase-3 activity (7Ghatak S. Misra S. Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38013-38020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Current evidence indicates that these effects are mainly due to disruption of hyaluronan-CD44 interactions (7Ghatak S. Misra S. Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38013-38020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), although it remains possible that interactions with other extracellular, cell surface or intracellular binding proteins are also involved. Nevertheless, since multidrug resistance is often dependent on cell survival signaling pathways, and since hyaluronan oligomers suppress at least part of these pathways, we postulated that hyaluronan oligomers might reverse drug resistance. Cell Culture—MCF-7/Adr drug-resistant human mammary carcinoma cells (obtained from Dr. K. Cowan, University of Nebraska) were grown in culture for 24 h in 24-well plates in RPMI 1640 medium containing Glutamax 1 plus 10% fetal bovine serum at 37o in 5% CO2. Various concentrations of chemotherapeutic agents were then added and the cells incubated for another 72 h, followed by a further 24 h in the presence or absence of 100 μg/ml hyaluronan oligomers. The oligomers were a highly purified, mixed population of three to eight repeating disaccharides in length (7Ghatak S. Misra S. Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38013-38020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested and the number of viable cells counted in a Coulter Counter. Recombinant Adenovirus Infection—MCF-7 cells were infected overnight with a recombinant murine Has2 adenovirus, human emmprin adenovirus, or control β-galactosidase adenovirus, which were constructed and used as described previously (10Li R. Huang L. Guo H. Toole B.P. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 186: 371-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 11Ward J. Huang L. Guo H. Ghatak S. Toole B.P. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 162: 1403-1409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). After changing the medium, the cells were treated as described in the text and legends. Assay of Hyaluronan—After infection with recombinant adenoviruses as above, the cells were washed and then incubated for a further 48 h. Hyaluronan was measured in the medium and cell layer by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-like method (12Kongtawelert P. Ghosh P. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 185: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We examined the effect of co-treatment with hyaluronan oligomers on drug resistance in an established system, i.e. MCF-7/Adr human mammary carcinoma cells that have been selected for resistance to doxorubicin (13Fairchild C.R. Ivy S.P. Kao-Shan C.S. Whang-Peng J. Rosen N. Israel M.A. Melera P.W. Cowan K.H. Goldsmith M.E. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 5141-5148PubMed Google Scholar). First, we compared the effect of hyaluronan oligomers on resistance to doxorubicin in the MCF-7/Adr cells versus the relatively drug-sensitive, parental MCF-7 cell line. We found that 100 μg/ml hyaluronan oligomers caused ∼55-fold sensitization of the MCF-7/Adr cells to the drug, but had little effect on the already sensitive MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1, A and B; Table I). We tested a range of concentrations of the oligomers and found that, whereas concentrations up to 250 μg/ml have little or no effect on cell survival when used alone, concentrations of 10 μg/ml or more have a highly significant effect on doxorubicin resistance (data not shown). We then tested the effect of hyaluronan oligomers on resistance of these cells to other drugs, i.e. whether they affect multidrug resistance. We found that the oligomers decreased resistance to taxol by ∼12-fold, to 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosurea (BCNU) by ∼78-fold and to vincristine by ∼10-fold (Table I). Again, the oligomers had little effect on the parental MCF-7 cells (Table I). In the case of taxol there was only 2–3-fold difference in resistance between the two cell types, yet only the MCF-7/Adr cells were affected significantly by the oligomers. It is not yet clear why the MCF-7 cells were not sensitized by the oligomers but this may be related to their endogenous levels of cell survival pathway activity. We also tested the hyaluronan oligomers in a different cell system, i.e. resistance of MDA-MB231 human mammary carcinoma cells to the folate analog, methotrexate (14Worm J. Kirkin A.F. Dzhandzhugazyan K.N. Guldberg P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39990-40000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We found that they decreased resistance in this system by 133-fold (Fig. 1C; Table I).Table IEffect of hyaluronan oligomers on IC50 valuesMCF-7/AdrMCF-7/Adr + o-HAMCF-7MCF-7 + o-HADoxorubicin2.200.040.030.04BCNU14.00.180.501.20Taxol0.700.060.250.25Vincristine0.200.020.030.03MDA-MB231MB231 + o-HAMCF-7MCF-7 + o-HAMethotrexate0.800.0060.020.02 Open table in a new tab If the hyaluronan oligomers sensitize multidrug-resistant cells by perturbing hyaluronan interactions, then increased hyaluronan production might be expected to cause increased resistance in drug-sensitive cells. Thus we stimulated hyaluronan production in the relatively drug-sensitive MCF-7 cells by infection with a recombinant adenovirus driving expression of HAS2, one of the enzymes that synthesize hyaluronan (15Weigel P.H. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13997-14000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). In three separate experiments, the Has2 adenovirus-infected cells were found to produce 2.5–4 times more hyaluronan than untreated cells or control cells infected with recombinant β-galactosidase adenovirus and the increased hyaluronan production induced a 10–12-fold increase in resistance to doxorubicin (Fig. 2A). This increase in resistance was reversed by continuous treatment with hyaluronan oligomers (Fig. 2B). Recently we found that emmprin, a member of the Ig superfamily that is enriched on the surface of most malignant cancer cells (16Biswas C. Zhang Y. DeCastro R. Guo H. Nakamura T. Kataoka H. Nabeshima K. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 434-439PubMed Google Scholar) and that promotes tumor progression (17Zucker S. Hymowitz M. Rollo E.E. Mann R. Conner C.E. Cao J. Foda H.D. Tompkins D.C. Toole B.P. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 158: 1921-1928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), also regulates hyaluronan production in tumor cells. 2E. Marieb, A. Zoltan-Jones, S. Misra, S. Ghatak, R. Li, and B. P. Toole, manuscript in preparation. Thus we infected MCF-7 cells with a recombinant emmprin adenovirus and found that these cells were ∼10-fold more resistant to doxorubicin treatment than controls (Fig. 2C). The effect of emmprin was reversed by treatment with hyaluronan oligomers, confirming that emmprin increases drug resistance via hyaluronan (Fig. 2D). In our previous work, we have found that hyaluronan oligomers suppress the PI 3-kinase/Akt cell survival pathway. However these studies were performed in different cells than those used here, i.e. HCT116 human colon carcinoma and TA3/St mouse mammary carcinoma cells (7Ghatak S. Misra S. Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38013-38020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Thus we tested the effects of the hyaluronan oligomers on this pathway in the MCF-7/Adr cells. As expected, we found that hyaluronan oligomers suppress phosphorylation of Akt and stimulate expression of PTEN in the presence of the various drugs, i.e. doxorubicin, taxol, vincristine (Fig. 3A), and BCNU (not shown). PI 3-kinase activity was also inhibited but there were no effects on total levels of Akt (not shown). These effects would be expected to lead to decreased phosphorylation of BAD at serine residue 136 (BAD136), the site of Akt-mediated phosphorylation. However, in MCF-7/Adr cells, as opposed to the cells used previously, we found very little phosphorylation of BAD136 in the presence or absence of the drugs or oligomers (not shown). Thus we examined the MAP kinase pathway, which also leads to BAD phosphorylation, in this case at serine 112 by Erk (18Bonni A. Brunet A. West A.E. Datta S.R. Takasu M.A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1358-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1656) Google Scholar, 19Mabuchi S. Ohmichi M. Kimura A. Hisamoto K. Hayakawa J. Nishio Y. Adachi K. Takahashi K. Arimoto-Ishida E. Nakatsuji Y.

Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1325-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We found strong phosphorylation of BAD112 in the MCF-7/Adr cells treated with the various drugs, implying that the MAP kinase pathway is more involved in phosphorylation of BAD than the PI 3-kinase pathway in these cells. We also found that BAD112 phosphorylation is inhibited by the hyaluronan oligomers (Fig. 3, A and B). In addition we found that the oligomers inhibit phosphorylation, but not total levels, of upstream components of this pathway, i.e. Erk (Fig. 3, A and B) and Raf-1 (not shown), in the presence of the various drugs. Since these experiments were done under anchorage-dependent culture conditions, we would expect the MAP kinase pathway to be activated by FAK (21Tamura M. Gu J. Tran H. Yamada K.M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1999; 91: 1820-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 22Almeida E.A. Ilic D. Han Q. Hauck C.R. Jin F. Kawakatsu H. Schlaepfer D.D. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 741-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Therefore we examined FAK phosphorylation in drug-treated MCF-7/Adr cells in the presence and absence of hyaluronan oligomers and found that the oligomers inhibit phosphorylation of FAK (Fig. 3A). Inhibition of p-Erk, p-BAD112, and p-FAK levels in these experiments varied from 50–90% depending on drug and oligomer dosage. Experiments were also performed with 50–1000 nm BCNU, and similar inhibition was observed (not shown). Since increased hyaluronan production causes enhanced drug resistance in MCF-7 cells, we also determined whether these pathways were stimulated in recombinant Has2 adenovirus-infected cells. As expected, we found that phosphorylation of Akt, Erk, BAD112, and FAK was increased in drug-treated, Has2 adenovirus-infected cells compared with controls (Fig. 3C), whereas PTEN expression was decreased (not shown). Similar results were obtained with emmprin adenovirus-infected cells. The experiments described above indicate that endogenous hyaluronan-tumor cell interactions are a crucial component of the regulation of multidrug resistance in cancer cells and that the most likely mechanism whereby hyaluronan acts is by stimulating the PI 3-kinase and MAP kinase cell survival pathways, leading to various anti-apoptotic consequences such as phosphorylation of BAD. Active, non-phosphorylated BAD interacts with prosurvival Bcl-2 family members and induces apoptosis (23Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3693) Google Scholar). BAD is inactivated by phosphorylation at serine 136 by Akt or at serine 112 by Erk, either of which leads to anti-apoptotic consequences that can result in increased drug resistance in tumor cells (18Bonni A. Brunet A. West A.E. Datta S.R. Takasu M.A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1358-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1656) Google Scholar, 19Mabuchi S. Ohmichi M. Kimura A. Hisamoto K. Hayakawa J.

Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1325-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In the MCF-7/Adr human mammary carcinoma cells used here, regulation of BAD phosphorylation is mediated mainly by Erk. However, in HCT116 human colon carcinoma and TA3/St mouse mammary carcinoma cells, phosphorylation of BAD by Akt is prominent (7Ghatak S. Misra S. Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38013-38020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In either case, treatment of the cells with hyaluronan oligomers is inhibitory. The idea that hyaluronan-cell interactions may be related to drug resistance is also supported by past data showing that hyaluronidase enhances the action of various chemotherapeutic agents, especially when used locally (24Baumgartner G. Gomar-Hoss C. Sakr L. Ulsperger E. Wogritsch C. Cancer Lett. 1998; 131: 85-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Of particular interest is the observation that dispersion of multicellular spheroids of EMT-6 mammary tumor cells with hyaluronidase reverses MDR1-based multidrug resistance (25St Croix B. Rak J.W.

The mechanistic effect of hyaluronidase in these systems is not understood but has been explained in terms of decreased cell adhesion (25St Croix B. Rak J.W. Kapitain S. Sheehan C. Graham C.H. Kerbel R.S. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1996; 88: 1285-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) or increased drug penetration (24Baumgartner G. Gomar-Hoss C. Sakr L. Ulsperger E. Wogritsch C. Cancer Lett. 1998; 131: 85-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 27Desoize B. Jardillier J. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 2000; 36: 193-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), rather than hyaluronan-specific effects on cell survival signaling. In earlier work we showed that calcium-independent aggregation of transformed cells is due to hyaluronan-mediated, multivalent cross-bridging of receptors on adjacent cells (5Toole B.P. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 12: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 28Underhill C.B. Toole B.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1981; 131: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Thus it is probable that hyaluronan-induced promotion of the PI 3-kinase/Akt or MAP kinase cell survival pathways is responsible for enhanced drug resistance in these spheroids, in addition to or instead of restricted drug access. Recent work shows that enhanced integrin signaling can also induce drug resistance (29Damiano J.S. Hazlehurst L.A. Dalton W.S. Leukemia. 2001; 15: 1232-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). We show here that perturbation of endogenous hyaluronan-induced signaling inhibits FAK phosphorylation, a central event in integrin signaling (21Tamura M. Gu J. Tran H. Yamada K.M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1999; 91: 1820-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 22Almeida E.A. Ilic D. Han Q. Hauck C.R. Jin F. Kawakatsu H. Schlaepfer D.D. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 741-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Also, we have shown that hyaluronan signaling is critical for anchorage-independent growth (7Ghatak S. Misra S. Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38013-38020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), a phenomenon that has previously been related to altered integrin signaling (21Tamura M. Gu J. Tran H. Yamada K.M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1999; 91: 1820-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 22Almeida E.A. Ilic D. Han Q. Hauck C.R. Jin F. Kawakatsu H. Schlaepfer D.D.

Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that hyaluronan-mediated signaling and integrin signaling play overlapping or interacting roles in these events. Our results not only document a role for hyaluronan in multidrug resistance, they also indicate that perturbation of hyaluronan interactions sensitizes resistant cells. Thus, such perturbations may provide a dual therapeutic role, since they have an intrinsic effect on tumor growth and metastasis (31Toole B.P. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 37R-42RCrossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 32Toole B.P. Hascall V.C. Am. J.

Despite the observations that homocysteine causes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and programmed cell death (PCD) in cultured human vascular endothelial cells, the cellular factors responsible for this effect and their relevance to atherogenesis have not been completely elucidated. We report here that homocysteine induces the expression of T-cell death-associated gene 51 (TDAG51), a member of the pleckstrin homology-related domain family, in cultured human vascular endothelial cells. This effect was observed for other ER stress-inducing agents, including dithiothreitol and tunicamycin. TDAG51 expression was attenuated in homozygous A/A mutant eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α mouse embryonic fibroblasts treated with homocysteine or tunicamycin, suggesting that ER stress-induced phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α is required for TDAG51 transcriptional activation. Transient overexpression of TDAG51 elicited significant changes in cell morphology, decreased cell adhesion, and promoted detachment-mediated PCD. In support of these in vitro findings, TDAG51 expression was increased and correlated with PCD in the atherosclerotic lesions from apoE–/– mice fed hyperhomocysteinemic diets, compared with mice fed a control diet. Collectively, these findings provide evidence that TDAG51 is induced by homocysteine, promotes detachment-mediated PCD, and contributes to the development of atherosclerosis observed in hyperhomocysteinemia. Hyperhomocysteinemia is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease and accelerates atherosclerosis in apoE–/– mice.

Collectively, these findings provide evidence that TDAG51 is induced by homocysteine, promotes detachment-mediated PCD, and contributes to the development of atherosclerosis observed in hyperhomocysteinemia. Numerous epidemiological studies have demonstrated that hyperhomocysteinemia is a strong and independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (1Boushey C.J. Beresford S.A.A. Omenn G.S.

A direct causal relationship between induction of hyperhomocysteinemia and accelerated atherosclerosis has been established in apoE–/– mice fed hyperhomocysteinemic diets (5Hofmann M.A. Lalla E. Lu Y. Gleason M.R. Wolf B.M. Tanji N. Ferran L.J. Kohl B. Rao V. Kisiel W. Stern D.M. Schmidt A.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 675-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 6Zhou J. Møller J.

These mice showed enhanced vascular inflammation, and atherosclerotic lesion area and complexity. Furthermore, dietary enrichment in vitamin cofactors essential for intracellular homocysteine metabolism attenuated the development of atherosclerosis (5Hofmann M.A. Lalla E. Lu Y. Gleason M.R. Wolf B.M. Tanji N. Ferran L.J. Kohl B. Rao V. Kisiel W. Stern D.M. Schmidt A.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 675-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Although diet-induced hyperhomocysteinemia accelerates early lesion development and enhances plaque fibrosis in apoE–/– mice, no difference in lesion size between control and hyperhomocysteinemic mice was observed after long term treatment (6Zhou J. Møller J. Danielsen C.C. Bentzon J. Ravn H.B. Austin R.C. Falk E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1470-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). These findings imply that hyperhomocysteinemia mediates the early stages of atherogenesis. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the proatherogenic effects of homocysteine. Because the thiol group of homocysteine readily undergoes autoxidation in plasma to generate reactive oxygen species, it has been suggested that homocysteine induces cell injury/dysfunction through a mechanism involving oxidative stress (4Welch G.N. Loscalzo J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 1042-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (1924) Google Scholar, 7Starkebaum G. Harlan J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 1370-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). This hypothesis, however, fails to explain why cysteine, which is present in plasma at much higher concentrations than homocysteine and is also readily autoxidized, does not cause cell injury and is not considered a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (8Jacobsen D.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1182-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 9Jacobsen D.W. Carmel R. Jacobsen D.W. Homocysteine in Heath and Disease. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK2001: 425-440Google Scholar). The observation that homocysteine decreases the expression of a wide range of antioxidant enzymes (10Outinen P.A. Sood S.K. Pfeifer S.I. Pamidi S. Podor T.J. Li J. Weitz J.I. Austin R.C. Blood. 1999; 94: 959-967Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and inhibits glutathione peroxidase activity (11Upchurch G.R. Welch G.N.

Given that homocysteine is generated intracellularly and can accumulate in cells (12Jakubowski H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1935-1942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Jacobsen (8Jacobsen D.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1182-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) has recently proposed the molecular target hypothesis, which states that homocysteine can interact and modulate the activity of both large (enzymes, receptors) and small molecular (nitric oxide, glutathione) targets, thereby altering specific cellular processes and pathways. Consistent with the molecular target hypothesis, we (10Outinen P.A. Sood S.K. Pfeifer S.I. Pamidi S. Podor T.J. Li J. Weitz J.I. Austin R.C.

Homocysteine-induced ER stress also increases lipid biosynthesis by activating the sterol regulatory element-binding proteins, thereby promoting hepatic steatosis in mice having diet-induced hyperhomocysteinemia (16Werstuck G.H. Lentz S.R. Dayal S. Hossain G.S. Sood S.K. Shi Y.Y. Zhou J. Maeda N. Krisans S.K. Malinow M.R. Austin R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 1263-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Recent studies have now shown that homocysteine induces programmed cell death (PCD) in cultured human vascular endothelial cells and that this effect involves activation of the UPR (17Cai Y. Zhang C. Nawa T. Aso T. Tanaka M. Oshiro S. Ichijo H. Kitajima S. Blood. 2000; 96: 2140-2148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Zhang C. Cai Y. Adachi M.T. Oshiro S. Aso T. Kaufman R.J. Kitajama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35867-35874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the activation of caspase-3 was shown to be essential for this process, a result consistent with the ability of homocysteine thiolactone, a cyclic thioester of homocysteine synthesized by specific aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (12Jakubowski H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1935-1942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), to induce PCD in HL-60 cells (19Huang R.F.S. Huang S.M. Lin B.S. Wei J.S. Liu T.-Z. Life Sci. 2001; 68: 2799-2811Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Although these studies provide in vitro evidence that homocysteine and its derivatives can promote PCD, further studies are required to identify the proapoptotic factors involved in this process as well as their in vivo relevance to the development of atherosclerosis. In this report, we demonstrate that homocysteine induces the expression of T-cell death-associated gene 51 (TDAG51), a member of the pleckstrin homology-related domain family (20Frank D. Mendelsohn C.L. Ciccone E. Svensson K. Ohlsson R. Tycko B. Mamm. Genome. 1999; 10: 1150-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 21Gomes I. Xiong W. Miki T. Rosner M.R. J.

Immunity. 1996; 4: 583-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Overexpression of TDAG51 caused changes in cell morphology, decreased cell adhesion, and promoted detachment-mediated PCD in cultured human vascular endothelial cells. In support of these in vitro findings, TDAG51 expression and PCD were increased and co-localized in the atherosclerotic lesions from apoE–/– mice having diet-induced hyperhomocysteinemia, compared with control mice. These studies provide novel evidence that TDAG51 is induced by homocysteine, promotes detachment-mediated PCD, and contributes to atherosclerotic lesion development observed in hyperhomocysteinemia. Cell Culture and Treatment Conditions—Primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC), and human aortic smooth muscle cells were purchased from Clonetics (San Diego, CA) and cultured in EGM-2 medium (Clonetics) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 50 ng/ml amphotericin, and a mixture of growth factors. Wild-type and homozygous A/A eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) mutant mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) derived from 14.5-day embryos were prepared and cultured as described previously (23Scheuner D. Song B. McEwen E. Liu C. Laybutt R. Gillespie P. Saunders T. Bonner-Weir S. Kaufman R.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1165-1176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar). dl-Homocysteine, l-homoserine, l-methionine, l-cysteine, l-homocystine, and dl-dithiothreitol (Sigma) were prepared in fresh medium, sterilized by filtration, and added to cell cultures at the indicated concentrations. Cell growth rates and adherence were monitored using a Z Series Coulter Counter. Cell death was assessed by measuring the release of lactate dehydrogenase into the medium using the Cytotoxicity Detection Kit (Roche Diagnostics). ApoE –/– Mice and Diets—Female apoE–/– mice, back-crossed 9–10 generations onto a C57BL/6 background, were obtained from Transgenic Alliance (Lyon, France) or Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). At 6 weeks of age, mice were divided into control group fed a low fat/vitamin-defined purified diet (Special Diet Services (Witham, UK) or Harlan Teklad (Madison, WI)) or hyperhomocysteinemic groups fed the same diet but supplemented with either 0.09% (w/v) dl-homocysteine in the drinking water or 1.4% (w/w) l-methionine in the diet. Mice were sacrificed after 4 or 18 weeks on the diets. Plasma Total Homocysteine and Lipids—Upon sacrifice, blood was withdrawn from the right ventricle into chilled EDTA-containing microtubes and centrifuged immediately. Plasma total homocysteine and lipids were measured from plasma as described previously (6Zhou J. Møller J. Danielsen C.C. Bentzon J. Ravn H.B. Austin R.C. Falk E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1470-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Atherosclerotic Lesion Analysis—After blood sampling, mice were flushed with ice-cold saline containing St. Thomas cardioplegic solution and heparin, perfusion-fixed (1× PBS containing 4% formaldehyde, pH 7.2), and immersed in fixative overnight. The heart containing the aortic root was removed, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned as described previously (6Zhou J. Møller J. Danielsen C.C. Bentzon J. Ravn H.B. Austin R.C. Falk E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1470-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Preparation of Total RNA, mRNA Differential Display, and Northern Blot Analysis—Isolation of total RNA, mRNA differential display, and identification of candidate cDNA fragments were performed as described previously (13Outinen P.A. Sood S.K. Liaw P.C.Y. Sarge K.D. Maeda N. Hirsh J. Ribau J. Podor T.J. Weitz J.I. Austin R.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Candidate cDNA fragments were subsequently amplified by PCR and used as probes on Northern blots. Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (10Outinen P.A. Sood S.K. Pfeifer S.I. Pamidi S. Podor T.J. Li J. Weitz J.I. Austin R.C. Blood. 1999; 94: 959-967Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Outinen P.A. Sood S.K. Liaw P.C.Y. Sarge K.D. Maeda N. Hirsh J. Ribau J. Podor T.J. Weitz J.I. Austin R.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). A multiple tissue Northern blot (2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA/lane) was purchased from Clontech Laboratories Inc., (Mississauga, ON). Specific cDNA probes for TDAG51 and GRP78 were radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP (specific activity >3000 Ci/mm; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using a random primed DNA labeling kit (Roche Diagnostics). To normalize for differences in RNA loading, blots were hybridized with a human actin or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probe. Cloning and Sequencing of cDNA Fragments—cDNA fragments were subcloned into T-ended pBluescript (KS) and sequenced by fluorescence-based double-stranded DNA sequencing (Institute for Molecular Biology (MOBIX), McMaster University). The cDNA sequences were analyzed and compared for similarity with those sequences available in the GenBank™ data base. cDNA Library Screening—A HUVEC cDNA library in λgt11 (Clontech) was screened using a radiolabeled EC-C3 cDNA probe (Fig. 1). Positive cDNA phage clones were plaque-purified, and the size of the cDNA inserts was determined by PCR using λgt11 forward and reverse primers (MOBIX). The largest cDNA inserts were excised from the λgt11 vector with EcoRI and subcloned into the EcoRI site of pBluescript II (KS). A HUVEC cDNA library in the bacterial vector pEAK12 (Edge Biosystems, Gaithersburg, MD) was screened with a radiolabeled 6-2 cDNA probe, and positive bacterial colonies were isolated. Plasmid DNA was isolated from 6-2-positive cells using the QIAEX miniprep kit (Qiagen Inc., Mississauga, ON, Canada), and the size of the inserts was determined by restriction analysis using NotI and HindIII. DNA sequencing and homology searches were done as described above. Construction of TDAG51 Expression Plasmids—The cDNA encoding the open reading frame of human TDAG51 was amplified by PCR using Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Mississauga, ON, Canada) and the expressed sequence tag cDNA clone, AI589460 (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA), as a template (Fig. 1). The forward primer AB19652 (5′-CTT AAG CTT CTT ATG CTG GGA GGA TGC TG-3′) contained a terminal HindIII restriction site (underlined) prior to the initiating ATG (boldface type). The reverse primer AB19653 (5′-GAA TTC TAG A TC AGG CAG AGT TGG AGG TGC T-3′) contained a terminal XbaI restriction site (underlined) adjacent to the termination codon (boldface type). Following PCR, the amplified TDAG51 cDNA was digested with HindIII and XbaI, and cloned in frame into the HindIII/XbaI sites of pEGFP-C1 (Clontech), generating a fusion protein of the mammalian codon-optimized enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) with TDAG51 linked to its C terminus (designated GFP-TDAG51). The TDAG51 cDNA was also cloned into the HindIII/XbaI sites of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) to express the native TDAG51 protein. Authenticity of these constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing (MOBIX). Transient Transfection of Cells—Transient transfections were performed with Superfect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, a routine transfection experiment involved the addition of plasmid DNA/Superfect transfection reagent mixture to cells in medium for 2–3 h, followed by the addition of complete medium for time periods up to 48 h. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and examined for expression of GFP or the GFP-TDAG51 fusion protein by epifluorescence microscopy using a Zeiss Axioskop 2 microscope. Images were captured using a CCD color video camera (Sony; Tokyo, Japan) and image analysis/archival software (Northern Exposure; Empix Inc., Mississauga, ON). Transfection efficiencies of ∼30% were routinely obtained. Subcellular Fractionation—Isolation of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions was performed using NE-PER™ nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). Cellular fractions were solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and stored at –20 °C. Antibodies—Anti-TDAG51 and anti-E2F-1 polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-catalase polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Calbiochem. Anti-PARP polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-KDEL, anti-GFP, anti-membrin, and anti-HSP60 monoclonal antibodies were purchased from StressGen (Victoria, BC, Canada). Anti-caspase-3/CPP32 and anti-focal adhesion kinase monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Mississauga, ON, Canada). The H4A3 monoclonal antibody was obtained from the University of Iowa. Immunoblot Analysis—Immunoblot analysis was performed on total cell lysates as described previously (10Outinen P.A. Sood S.K.

Total cellular proteins were solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Following incubation with the appropriate primary and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Affinity Biologicals, Hamilton, ON, Canada), membranes were developed using the Renaissance Western blot Chemiluminescence Reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Indirect Immunofluorescence—Indirect immunofluorescence was performed on cells and tissues as described previously (10Outinen P.A. Sood S.K. Pfeifer S.I. Pamidi S. Podor T.J. Li J. Weitz J.I. Austin R.C. Blood. 1999; 94: 959-967Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Werstuck G.H. Lentz S.R. Dayal S. Hossain G.S. Sood S.K. Shi Y.Y. Zhou J. Maeda N. Krisans S.K. Malinow M.R. Austin R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 1263-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Primary antibody binding sites were detected using either Alexa™ 488 or Alexa™ 594 donkey anti-goat IgG (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). A Carl Zeiss LSM510 laser-scanning confocal microscope was used to examine immunofluorescently labeled HUVEC and HAEC to localize endogenously expressed TDAG51 and determine its co-localization with catalase, GRP78, membrin, HSP60, H4A3, and/or focal adhesion kinase. Optical sectioning was performed throughout the depth of the cells at 1.5-μm intervals, providing adequate spacial resolution to determine protein localization within regions of the cell and co-localization with other marker proteins. TdT-mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) Assay—Cells transiently transfected with the pEGFP-C1 (designated GFP) or pEGFP-C1-TDAG51 (designated GFP-TDAG51) expression plasmids were fixed in 1× PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde, washed in 1× PBS, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. The TUNEL assay was performed using an in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Diagnostics). The 3′-nick ends were then labeled by incubating tetramethylrhodamine-dUTP with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. Fixed cells in which terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase was omitted served as a negative control. Paraffin-embedded tissue sections were deparaffinized, treated with 0.3% H2O2, and washed in 1× PBS. Sections were then incubated with proteinase K (20 μg/ml), washed in 1× PBS, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and rinsed with 1× PBS. TUNEL assay was performed as described above, and the 3′-nick ends were labeled by incubating fluorescence-dUTP with terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase. After TUNEL staining, tissue sections were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in 1× PBS, and indirect immunofluorescence for TDAG51 was performed. Sections without primary antibody served as a negative control. After rinsing with 1× PBS, sections were mounted onto coverslips using Prolong Antifade Kit (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). DNA Fragmentation Assay—HAEC were treated for 24 h in the absence or presence of various concentrations of homocysteine (0.05–10 mm), 0.5 mm methionine, 0.5 mm cysteine, or 0.5 mm homocystine. The cells (floating and adherent) were harvested by scraping, pelleted, and lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 8.0, on ice for 45 min. The nuclear pellet was collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 5 mm EDTA, 0.2 m NaCl, 0.2% SDS (w/v), and 0.2 mg/ml proteinase K, at 37 °C overnight. NaCl was added to a final concentration of 1.5 m, and the DNA was ethanol-precipitated and resuspended in Tris-EDTA, pH 8.0, containing 200 mg/ml DNase-free RNase A. Following incubation at 37 °C overnight, the DNA was separated on a 2% agarose gel and visualized under UV light after staining with ethidium bromide. Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as the means ± S.E. Significance of differences between control and treated groups was determined by one-way analysis of variance. If significant differences were detected, unpaired Student's t tests were performed. For all analyses, p values <0.05 were considered significant. TDAG51 Is a Homocysteine-inducible Gene—To identify candidate proapoptotic genes induced by homocysteine, RNA from control or homocysteine-treated HUVEC was subjected to mRNA differential display, as described previously (13Outinen P.A. Sood S.K. Liaw P.C.Y. Sarge K.D. Maeda N. Hirsh J. Ribau J. Podor T.J. Weitz J.I. Austin R.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Among a number of differentially expressed cDNA fragments, a 114-bp fragment (designated EC-C3) was up-regulated in HUVEC exposed to homocysteine (Fig. 1A). Northern blot hybridization experiments using EC-C3 as a probe identified a homocysteine-inducible transcript of ∼7.0 kb in HUVEC (Fig. 1B). Although sequence analysis demonstrated that EC-C3 contained a putative polyadenylation signal (AATAAA), it had no sequence similarity to any known human genes deposited in GenBank™. To obtain larger cDNA clones, HUVEC libraries in λgt11 and in bacteria were screened with EC-C3. A number of positive clones were identified and isolated (Fig. 1C), with the largest being ∼4.2 kb in size (pEAK25A7). Although no sequence similarity to any known human genes was observed, the 5′-end of pEAK25A7 showed significant sequence similarity to the 3′ end of several human expressed sequence tag clones (GenBank™ accession numbers AA995175, AI679493, AI795908, and AI693672). Identification of additional 5′ expressed sequence tag clones (GenBank™ accession numbers N21585 and AI589460) revealed homology to an open reading frame encoding TDAG51, a member of the pleckstrin homology-related domain family having proapoptotic characteristics (20Frank D.

Immunity. 1996; 4: 583-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the size of the TDAG51 mRNA transcript observed here (∼7.0 kb) is consistent with that reported for TDAG51 transcripts in adult human brain (24Reddy P.H. Stockburger E. Gillevet P. Tagle D.A. Genomics. 1997; 46: 174-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To further examine the effect of homocysteine on TDAG51 expression, Northern blot analysis was performed and revealed that the steady-state mRNA levels of TDAG51 were increased in HUVEC by homocysteine in both a time-dependent (Fig. 2A) and concentration-dependent (Fig. 2B) manner and correlated with an increase in the steady-state mRNA levels of GRP78, an ER-resident molecular chaperone responsive to ER stress. This effect was specific for homocysteine, because other structurally similar amino acids such as methionine, cysteine, and homoserine failed to induce TDAG51 expression (Fig. 2C). The ability of other ER stress agents such as tunicamycin and dithiothreitol (Fig. 2C) to increase the expression of TDAG51 supports a mechanism involving ER stress and UPR activation. This effect of homocysteine did not involve oxidative stress, because (i) the addition of catalase to the cell culture medium failed to inhibit TDAG51 expression in the presence of homocysteine, and (ii) hydrogen peroxide did not induce the expression of TDAG51 in HUVEC (data not shown). To determine whether the increase in the steady-state mRNA levels of TDAG51 corresponded to an increase in TDAG51 protein, HUVEC were cultured in the absence or presence of homocysteine, and total cell lysates were examined by immunoblot analysis using a polyclonal antibody directed against TDAG51 (Fig. 2D). TDAG51 protein was increased in HUVEC following exposure to homocysteine and correlated with an increase in GRP78 protein. Consistent with these findings, TDAG51 and GRP78 proteins were increased in HAEC in a dose-dependent (50 μm to 5 mm) manner following treatment with increasing concentrations of homocysteine for 18 h (Fig. 2E). The observation that TDAG51 and GRP78 protein levels were increased at physiological concentrations of 50–200 μm homocysteine suggests that HAEC are more sensitive to exogenous levels of homocysteine then are HUVEC (10Outinen P.A.

https://openalex.org/W2029175062,"We investigated the role of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response in intracellular Ca2+ regulation, MAPK activation, and cytoprotection in LLC-PK1 renal epithelial cells in an attempt to identify the mechanisms of protection afforded by ER stress. Cells preconditioned with trans-4,5-dihydroxy-1,2-dithiane, tunicamycin, thapsigargin, or A23187 expressed ER stress proteins and were resistant to subsequent H2O2-induced cell injury. In addition, ER stress preconditioning prevented the increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration that normally follows H2O2 exposure. Stable transfection of cells with antisense RNA targeted against GRP78 (pkASgrp78 cells) prevented GRP78 induction, disabled the ER stress response, sensitized cells to H2O2-induced injury, and prevented the development of tolerance to H2O2 that normally occurs with preconditioning. ERK and JNK were transiently (30–60 min) phosphorylated in response to H2O2. ER stress-preconditioned cells had more ERK and less JNK phosphorylation than control cells in response to H2O2 exposure. Preincubation with a specific inhibitor of JNK activation or adenoviral infection with a construct that encodes constitutively active MEK1, the upstream activator of ERKs, also protected cells against H2O2 toxicity. In contrast, the pkASgrp78 cells had less ERK and more JNK phosphorylation upon H2O2 exposure. Expression of constitutively active ERK also conferred protection on native as well as pkAS-grp78 cells. These results indicate that GRP78 plays an important role in the ER stress response and cytoprotection. ER stress preconditioning attenuates H2O2-induced cell injury in LLC-PK1 cells by preventing an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration, potentiating ERK activation, and decreasing JNK activation. Thus, the ER stress response modulates the balance between ERK and JNK signaling pathways to prevent cell death after oxidative injury.

Thus, the ER stress response modulates the balance between ERK and JNK signaling pathways to prevent cell death after oxidative injury. Furthermore, ERK activation is an important downstream effector mechanism for cellular protection by ER stress. When the kidney is rendered ischemic or is obstructed, it is protected against subsequent ischemia for at least 15 days from the time of the initial insult (1Park K.M. Chen A. Bonventre J.V. J. Biol.

The mechanisms of the protection afforded by prior ischemic stress are not known; however, many of the downstream signals that mediate ischemia/reperfusion injury have been well characterized. For example, reactive oxygen species (ROS) 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; [Ca2+]i, intracellular free Ca2+ concentration; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase; UPR, unfolded protein response; PKB, protein kinase B; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; DTTox, trans-4,5-dihydroxy-1,2-dithiane (oxidized dithiothreitol); LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; EBSS, Earle's balanced salt solution; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; ASK1, apoptosis signal-regulated kinase-1; FCS, fetal calf serum. are major mediators of ischemia/reperfusion injury (3Cutrn J.C.

Although cells contain antioxidant defenses that minimize susceptibility to ROS, ROS generation and oxidative stress often exceed the cell's antioxidant capacity (6Martindale J.L. Holbrook N.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 192: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1942) Google Scholar). Oxidative stress causes a rapid increase in intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in a number of cell types, including cells derived from the renal tubule (7Ueda N. Shah S.V. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: F214-D221PubMed Google Scholar, 8Wang H. Joseph J.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1222-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Increases in [Ca2+]i can result in enhanced Ca2+ influx into mitochondria, disrupting mitochondrial metabolism and leading to cell death (9Duchen M.R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 529: 57-68Crossref Scopus (948) Google Scholar, 10Ermak G. Davies K.J. Mol. Immunol. 2002; 38: 713-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Changes in [Ca2+]i also modulate gene transcription and proteases and nucleases that control cell apoptosis (9Duchen M.R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 529: 57-68Crossref Scopus (948) Google Scholar, 10Ermak G. Davies K.J. Mol. Immunol. 2002; 38: 713-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Recent investigations using renal epithelial cells indicate that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response can modulate both oxidative stress and [Ca2+]i after treatment with organic hydroperoxides and alkylating agents (11Liu H.

Miller E. van de Water B. Stevens J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12858-12862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Likewise, increased attention has been paid recently to the possibility that ER stress influences the pathophysiology of acute ischemia in the brain, heart, or kidney (13Bush K.T. Keller S.H. Nigam S.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 621-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 14Benjamin I.J. McMillan D.R. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 117-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar, 15Paschen W. Cell Calcium. 2001; 29: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Given the association between ROS, oxidative stress, and ischemic injury in the kidney, we investigated the association between the ER stress response and H2O2 in renal epithelial cells. ROS-induced cell injury has been attributed, in part, to the change in activation of intracellular signaling molecules, including mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). MAPKs, which include extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK), and p38 subfamilies, are important regulatory proteins that transduce various extracellular signals into intracellular events (16Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3218) Google Scholar, 17Mandlekar S. Kong A.N. Apoptosis. 2001; 6: 469-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The ERK, JNK/SAPK, and p38 subfamilies are all activated in response to oxidative injury. In 1996, Guyton et al. (18Guyton K.Z. Liu Y. Gorospe M. Xu Q. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4138-4142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar) implicated ERK activation as a survival factor following oxidant injury. Subsequent studies from a number of laboratories confirmed these findings in other cell types and with other injurious agents (19Ikeyama S. Kokkonen G. Shack S. Wang X.T. Holbrook N.J. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 20Wang X. Martindale J.L. Liu Y. Holbrook N.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). The influence of JNK activation on cell survival following oxidative stress remains complex and highly controversial (6Martindale J.L. Holbrook N.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 192: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1942) Google Scholar). Some studies have shown that JNK activation is correlated with cell death or apoptosis induced by agents that act, at least in part, via generation of ROS (21Chen Y.R. Tan T.H. Int. J. Oncol. 2000; 16: 651-662PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, ERK and JNK can have counteracting influences on cell survival during stress, including oxidant injury (18Guyton K.Z. Liu Y. Gorospe M. Xu Q. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4138-4142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar, 20Wang X. Martindale J.L. Liu Y. Holbrook N.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar); and the balance between JNK and ERK activation may determine cell fate after renal ischemia/reperfusion injury (1Park K.M. Chen A. Bonventre J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11870-11876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 22di Mari J.F. Davis R. Safirstein R.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F195-F203PubMed Google Scholar). We investigated the association between ER stress and JNK or ERK phosphorylation. The signals that activate the ER stress response are well characterized, as is the link between ER Ca2+ release and cell injury. The ER is involved in both Ca2+ signaling and posttranslational protein folding and maturation. Release of Ca2+ from the ER may contribute to the ischemia/reperfusion injury of the brain, heart, and kidney (15Paschen W. Cell Calcium. 2001; 29: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 23Kristian T. Siesjo B.K. Stroke. 1998; 29: 705-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar, 24Yamashita J. Itoh M. Kuro T. Kobayashi Y. Ogata M. Takaoka M. Matsumura Y. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 296: 412-419PubMed Google Scholar). The response of the ER to unfolded proteins, known as the unfolded protein response (UPR), is currently the best understood model of ER stress signaling. The UPR has been shown to modulate expression of ER chaperones, allowing the cell to tolerate the accumulation of unfolded proteins (15Paschen W. Cell Calcium. 2001; 29: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 25Sherman M.Y. Goldberg A.L. Neuron. 2001; 29: 15-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar, 26Kaufman R.J. Scheuner D. Schroder M. Shen X. Lee K. Liu C.Y. Arnold S.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

In mammalian cells, the UPR is activated by agents that prevent protein glycosylation (tunicamycin) and disulfide bond formation (DTTox) and by agents that deplete ER Ca2+ stores such as thapsigargin and the Ca2+ ionophore A23187. The UPR also regulates many genes that affect diverse aspects of cell physiology. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 381 of 6000 genes were found to participate in the UPR, including 208 genes for which some functional information is available (28Travers K.J. Patil C.K. Wodicka L. Lockhart D.J. Weissman J.S. Walter P. Cell. 2000; 101: 249-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar). Thus, the current view of the ER stress pathway has broadened from a pathway that simply regulates ER molecular chaperones to one that impacts many aspects of cell physiology (29Spear E. Ng D.T. Traffic. 2001; 2: 515-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It is not entirely clear, however, how ER stress protects cells. In particular, it is not known whether the cellular MAPK and Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) pathways are effectors of the ER stress response (30Urano F. Bertolotti A. Ron D. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3697-3702Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Ron D. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 1383-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Although the ER stress response has been implicated in the pathophysiology of ischemic injury (13Bush K.T. Keller S.H. Nigam S.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 621-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 14Benjamin I.J. McMillan D.R. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 117-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar, 15Paschen W.

Med. 2002; 12: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), the role of individual ER stress proteins has not been addressed. Glucose-regulated proteins are the prototypical ER chaperones induced by ER stress (33Lee A.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Induction of glucose-regulated proteins has been associated with protection against an increase in [Ca2+]i (11Liu H. Bowes III, R.C. van de Water B. Sillence C. Nagelkerke J.F. Stevens J.L. J. Biol.

Cell Calcium. 2001; 29: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and facilitation of protein folding (25Sherman M.Y. Goldberg A.L.

Overexpression, antisense, and ribozyme approaches in tissue culture systems have led to the conclusion that GRP78, GRP94, and Adapt78 protect cells against cell death (11Liu H.

Overexpression of the ER molecular chaperones also correlates with increased survival of renal epithelial cells subjected to ATP depletion (39Bush K.T. George S.K. Zhang P.L. Nigam S.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F211-F218PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, glucose-regulated proteins might also be involved in ER protection from ischemic injury. In this study, we investigated the effect of preconditioning the renal epithelial cell line LLC-PK1 with different inducers of ER stress to determine whether ER stress can protect against injury caused by H2O2, the prototypical ROS thought to contribute to ischemia/reperfusion injury. Our results demonstrate that ER stress and GRP78 protect epithelial cells against oxidative stress by preventing the increase in [Ca2+]i that normally follows H2O2 exposure. In naïve renal epithelial cells, H2O2 treatment activated both ERK1/2 and JNK phosphorylation. With prior ER stress, cells survived H2O2 challenge and had increased ERK1/2 relative to JNK phosphorylation. The results indicate that ERK1/2 activation is downstream of the ER stress response in the cell protective pathway. Accordingly, modulating the balance between JNK and ERK1/2 phosphorylation with inhibitors or genetic manipulations that alter upstream MAPK signaling shows that cell survival by ER stress preconditioning is linked to an increase in ERK1/2 and a decrease in JNK activation. These results place ERK as a distal mediator of the ER stress response in protection against oxidative injury and may be important for understanding how renal preconditioning affects mechanisms of ischemia/reperfusion injury in vivo. Materials—Fetal calf serum and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) were obtained from Invitrogen. The acetoxymethyl ester of Fura-2 (Fura-2/AM) and Pluronic F-127 were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). H2O2, tunicamycin, thapsigargin, and trans-4,5-dihydroxy-1,2-dithiane (DTTox) were obtained from Sigma. LY294002, U0126, and SP600125 (Calbiochem) were dissolved in Me2SO and stored as 10 mm (LY294002 and U0126) and 40 mm (SP600125) stock solutions. The anti-phospho-Akt antibody was obtained from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). The anti-total Akt and anti-total ERK antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The anti-GRP94 and anti-calreticulin antibodies were obtained from Stressgen Biotech Corp. (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). All other antibodies were purchased from New England Biolabs Inc.

Cell Cultures and Experimental Treatments—LLC-PK1 cells (a porcine renal epithelial cell line with proximal tubule epithelial characteristics) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). LLC-PK1 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. ER stress preconditioning was produced as described previously (11Liu H. Bowes III, R.C. van de Water B. Sillence C.

Briefly, confluent cells were treated with DTTox (10 mm) for 3 h and returned to complete medium for 12–16 h. Alternatively, cells pretreated for 12–16 h in complete medium containing tunicamycin (1.5 μg/ml), thapsigargin (0.3 μg/ml), or A23187 (7 μm) were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and returned to complete medium. To prevent the bias of pre-selection, cell injury was measured both immediately and 24 h after returning to complete medium. There was no significant difference in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release in cells with and without ER stress preconditioning at either time point (data not shown). Preconditioned and control cells were treated with 1 mm H2O2 for 15 min in Earle's balanced salt solution (EBSS) and allowed to recover in complete medium. Alternatively, preconditioned cells were serum-deprived for 3–4 h and then treated with 250 μm H2O2 by directly adding H2O2 to the medium without changing the medium to prevent an effect of medium change on signaling pathways during oxidative stress. The later protocol was used when activation of members of the MAPK family was determined to avoid serum stimulation upon refeeding. Specific inhibitors were added 1 h before H2O2 treatment. Cell injury was determined by LDH release as a percent of total LDH as described previously (11Liu H. Bowes III, R.C. van de Water B. Sillence C. Nagelkerke J.F. Stevens J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21751-21759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). In some experiments, the effect of altering expression of specific ER stress proteins was examined. LLC-PK1 cells expressing an antisense RNA targeted to GRP78 (pkASgrp78 cells) or overexpressing human calreticulin (pkCRT cells) as well as controls transfected with the same pcDNA3 plasmid (used to construct both cell lines) containing no insert (pkNEO cells) were established as described previously (11Liu H.

When the effects of ER stress on H2O2-induced cell injury and MAPK activation were tested using pkASgrp78 or pkCRT cells, three independent clones of both lines as well as three pkNEO lines were compared to avoid bias that might have occurred randomly through selection of individual clones. Measurement of Intracellular Free Calcium Concentration—[Ca2+]i was determined with the Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent dye Fura-2/AM according to Chen et al. (40Chen Q. Jones T.W. Stevens J.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 161: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) with modifications. Cells grown on coverslips coated with bovine collagen type I were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and loaded with 3 μm Fura-2/AM in EBSS. Pluronic F-127 (20%) at a 1:1000 (v/v) dilution was added to Fura-2/AM to facilitate cell loading. In addition, 2 mm probenecid was added to prevent intracellular compartment transport or extrusion of Fura-2-free acid. After incubation with Fura-2/AM for 1 h at 37 °C, cells were washed two to three times with EBSS in the presence of probenecid. The coverslips were positioned in a quartz cuvette, containing 2.5 ml of EBSS with probenecid, for fluorescence analysis using a Shimadzu RF-5000 spectrofluorophotometer. [Ca2+]i was calculated as equal to K d (224 nm) × (R – R min)/(R max – R) according to Grynkiewicz et al. (41Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Fluorescence emission was monitored at 505 nm. R is the ratio of the fluorescence at 340 nm excitation to that at 380 nm excitation. Construction of Recombinant Adenoviral Vectors—MEK1-DD, a constitutively active mutant of MAPK/ERK kinase-1 (MEK1), the upstream activator of ERK1/2, was created by PCR using primers to substitute serines 218 and 222 with aspartic acid residues as previously described (42Huang W. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8960-8963Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). This mutant has been shown to activate ERK1/2 when expressed in COS-7 cells as well as in NIH3T3 cells (42Huang W. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Hajjar R. Kyriakis J.M. Bonventre J.V. Rosenzweig A. Force T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1311-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Protein expression was confirmed by immunoblotting and by assay of ERK activity in mouse mesangial cells. 2G. Choukroun and J. V. Bonventre, manuscript in preparation. The recombinant adenovirus carrying the Escherichia coli LacZ gene (AdLacZ) encoding β-galactosidase was kindly provided by Dr. Roger Hajjar (Cardiovascular Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA). Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed in a solution containing 70 mm β-glycerophosphate (pH 7.2), 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors (2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 30 min. Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants (30–50 μg) were boiled in 1× sample buffer (500 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol) for 5 min and separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were electrotransferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and blotted with the indicated antibodies at 4 °C overnight in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat milk. Membranes were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies at room temperature for 45 min, and the signal was detected using chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences), followed by exposure to X-Omat AR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Blots were stripped and reblotted with the indicated antibodies to determine equal loading of samples. Stripping of the initial antibody probe was accomplished by submerging the membrane in buffer containing 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 20% SDS, and 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) at 55 °C for 50 min, followed by washing twice with Tris-buffered saline and 0.1% Tween 20 for 10 min each. Statistical Analyses—Student's t test was used to determine whether there was a significant difference between two groups (p < 0.05). When multiple means were compared, significance (p < 0.05) was determined by analysis of variance, followed by Fisher's protected least significant difference test. For analysis of variance, letter designations are used to indicate significant differences. Means with a common letter designation are not different, and those with a different letter designation are significantly different from all other means with different letter designations. StatView software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used as a statistical tool in this study. H 2 O 2 Increases [Ca2 + ] i prior to Injury to LLC-PK 1 Cells—To establish the temporal relationship between an increase in [Ca2+]i and cell injury in LLC-PK1 cells under oxidative stress, we examined [Ca2+]i at various times after H2O2 treatment. Cells were treated with 1 mm H2O2 for 15 min in EBSS and then returned to EBSS and loaded for 1 h with Fura-2/AM. An increase in [Ca2+]i was detected as early as 1 h after H2O2 treatment and reached a maximum at 2 h. In contrast, a significant amount of H2O2-induced cell death, as measured by LDH release, was not observed until 2 h and increased steadily through 4 h (Fig. 1). Thus, the increase in [Ca2+]i preceded significant cell injury in LLC-PK1 cells treated with H2O2. ER Stress Preconditioning Prevents H 2 O 2 -induced Cell Injury and Ca2 + Accumulation—We next examined the effect of prior ER stress on H2O2-induced cell injury. LLC-PK1 cells preconditioned with different ER stress inducers were protected against subsequent H2O2-induced cell injury at 4 h (Fig. 2A). Prior ER stress induced by DTTox, tunicamycin, thapsigargin, or A23187 prevented the rise in [Ca2+]i normally occurring 2 h after H2O2 treatment (Fig. 2B). To confirm the biological significance of the protection afforded by ER stress preconditioning, we assessed cell injury at later time points under two different conditions of H2O2 exposure. Under conditions of transient (Fig. 3, A and B) or continuous (C and D) H2O2 exposure, the protective effect afforded by previous ER stress persisted up to 24 h. Thus, ER stress preconditioning modified the magnitude of oxidant-induced cell injury and not just the kinetics of the process.Fig. 3Effect of ER stress preconditioning on the time course of H2O2-induced cell injury. LLC-PK1 cells pretreated with vehicle, tunicamycin (TUNIC; 1.5 μg/ml), or thapsigargin (THAPS; 0.3 μg/ml), for 16 h to induce ER stress, were treated with 0.5 or 1 mm H2O2 in EBSS for 15 min and then washed and returned to DMEM plus 10% FCS at time 0 (A and B). Alternatively, cells were washed and serum-deprived for 3 h before exposure to 125 or 250 μm H2O2 at time 0, with no subsequent medium change (C and D). At the various time points, cell injury was determined by measurement of LDH release. The data are the means ± S.E. of three independent measurements. Significant differences (*, p < 0.05) between tunicamycin or thapsigargin pretreatment versus vehicle pretreatment in each group (Gr) at various time points are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Blocking Expression of GRP78 Disrupts the Effect of ER Stress Preconditioning—Because prior ER stress prevented both the increase in [Ca2+]i and cell death after H2O2, we determined whether disruption of the ER stress response alters the sensitivity to oxidant injury and prevents adaptation.

https://openalex.org/W2132452209,"The inducible isoenzyme of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) generates nitric oxide (NO) in inflammatory diseases such as asthma. The prodrug L-N6-(1-iminoethyl)lysine 5-tetrazole amide (SC-51) is rapidly converted in vivo to the active metabolite L-N6-(1-iminoethyl)lysine (L-NIL). Initially, we performed in vitro experiments in human primary airway epithelial cells to demonstrate that L-NIL causes inhibition of iNOS. In a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial, SC-51 was administered as a single oral dose (20 or 200 mg) in separate cohorts of healthy volunteers (two groups of n=12) and mild asthmatic patients (two groups of n=12). SC-51 (200 mg) reduced exhaled breath NO levels to <2 ppb in both healthy volunteers (P<0.001) and mild asthmatics (P<0.001) within 15 min, representing >90% inhibition of baseline levels of NO in asthmatic patients, with the effects lasting at least 72 h. There were no significant effects on blood pressure, pulse rate, or respiratory function (FEV1). This study demonstrates that an inhibitor of iNOS produces marked inhibition of exhaled breath NO in normal and asthmatic subjects without producing the side effects observed following the systemic administration of non-selective NOS inhibitors, and thus provides support for the potential use of iNOS inhibitors to treat a range of inflammatory clinical disorders."

Infection by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) also blocks cellular proliferation at the G2 phase. The HIV-1 accessory gene vpr encodes a conserved 96-amino acid protein (Vpr) that is necessary and sufficient for the HIV-1-induced block of cellular proliferation. In the present study, we examined a recently identified DNA damage-signaling protein, the ATM- and Rad3-related protein, ATR, for its potential role in the induction of G2 arrest by Vpr. We show that inhibition of ATR by pharmacological inhibitors, by expression of the dominant-negative form of ATR, or by RNA interference inhibits Vpr-induced cell cycle arrest. As with DNA damage, activation of ATR by Vpr results in phosphorylation of Chk1. This study provides conclusive evidence of activation of the ATR-initiated DNA damage-signaling pathway by a viral gene product. These observations are important toward understanding how HIV infection promotes cell cycle disruption, cell death, and ultimately, CD4+ lymphocyte depletion.

These observations are important toward understanding how HIV infection promotes cell cycle disruption, cell death, and ultimately, CD4+ lymphocyte depletion. DNA damage-signaling pathways consist of a network of interacting and occasionally redundant signals that may lead to the inactivation of the Cdc2-cyclin B complex (1Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J.

A major point of regulation of the Cdc2-cyclin B cyclin complex is through inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdc2 on Tyr-15. Phosphorylation of the adjacent residue, Thr-14, also contributes to the inhibition of Cdc2 activity. Cdc25C is a dual specificity phosphatase that dephosphorylates Cdc2 on both Tyr-15 and Thr-14, leading to Cdc2 activation. Upon induction of the DNA damage checkpoint Cdc25C is inactivated through the actions of several kinases, including Chk1 and Chk2, which are under the control of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like proteins ATR and ATM. ATR and ATM respond to a variety of abnormal DNA structures and initiate a signaling cascade leading to a DNA damage checkpoint (6Westphal C.H. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 789-792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Their roles are partially redundant but with some important distinctions both with regard to substrate preference and the types of the DNA damage to which the kinases respond. In response to genotoxic stress, ATM is responsible for phosphorylation of the Chk2 protein kinase, whereas ATR phosphorylates Chk1. ATR is primarily responsible for enforcement of the cell cycle checkpoint activated in response to intra-S-phase genotoxic stress, as exemplified by stalled replication forks and topoisomerase inhibition (7Cliby W.A.

Both proteins are inhibited by methylxanthines, such as caffeine.

The G2 phase arrest and subsequent apoptosis may explain aspects of the CD4+ cell death in HIV infection. Early studies demonstrated that Vpr-induced G2 arrest is associated with inactivation of the cyclin-dependent kinase, Cdc2, by hyperphosphorylation and concomitant suppression of Cdc2-cyclin B kinase activity that is necessary for the G2 to M transition (21Re F. Braaten D. Franke E.K. Luban J. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6859-6864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22He J. Choe S. Walker R. Di Marzio P. Morgan D.O. Landau N.R. J.

In response to Vpr, the Cdc2-specific phosphatase, Cdc25C, is hyperphosphorylated in a pattern consistent with inactivation (21Re F. Braaten D. Franke E.K. Luban J. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6859-6864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Induction of G2 arrest by Vpr can be overcome by methylxanthines (27Zhu Y. Gelbard H.A. Roshal M. Pursell S. Jamieson B.D. Planelles V. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3791-3801Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 30Poon B. Jowett J.B. Stewart S.A. Armstrong R.W. Rishton G.M. Chen I.S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3961-3971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Together, the above observations have led to the suggestion that Vpr induces cell cycle arrest via a DNA damage-sensitive pathway (30Poon B. Jowett J.B. Stewart S.A. Armstrong R.W. Rishton G.M. Chen I.S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3961-3971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although the precise signaling pathway has remained elusive. A direct binding of Vpr to DNA has been reported (31Zhang S. Pointer D. Singer G. Feng Y. Park K. Zhao L.J. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 212: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However the possibility that Vpr activates DNA damage-dependent cellular pathways by directly causing alterations in the structure or the integrity of DNA has not been demonstrated. Bartz et al. (32Bartz S.R. Rogel M.E. Emerman M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2324-2331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that Vpr-induced G2 arrest is independent of ATM function. In addition, p53, which is associated with key aspects of the DNA damage response, is not necessary for the vpr-mediated cell cycle arrest or apoptosis (24Shostak L.D. Ludlow J. Fisk J. Pursell S. Rimel B.J. Nguyen D. Rosenblatt J.D. Planelles V. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 251: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In this work, we examined the potential involvement of the DNA damage-signaling pathway that is initiated by ATR in vpr-induced G2 arrest. Cell Lines—Human cervical cancer cell line HeLa and transformed human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 10% fetal bovine serum. Human SV40 transformed fibroblasts GM847/ATRkd (a generous gift of Dr. Cimprich, Stanford University and Dr. Handeli, University of Washington) and human osteosarcoma-derived U2OS ATRkd cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum with 400 μg/ml G418 and 200 μg/ml hygromycin B. Plasmids—We described the lentiviral vector, pHR-GFP, in a previous report (33Zhu Y. Feuer G. Day S.L. Wrzesinski S. Planelles V. Mol. Ther. 2001; 4: 375-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). pHR-VPR was derived by substituting the B7.1 cDNA in place of human T-cell lymphotrophic virus-I tax in the vector pHR′CMV/Tax1/eGFP (34Wrzesinski S.

This was accomplished by digesting pCMV-vpr (19Planelles V. Jowett J.B.M. Li Q.X. Xie Y. Hahn B. Chen I.S.Y. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2516-2524Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with NotI followed by Klenow treatment and further digestion with XhoI. We then ligated the vpr-containing band to pHR′CMV/Tax1/eGFP, which was previously digested with SalI, treated with Klenow, and further digested with XhoI. Viral Vector Production and Titration—Lentiviral vectors were produced by transient transfection of HEK293T cells. For defective lentivirus vector production, pHR-GFP and pHR-VPR plasmids were co-transfected with pCMVD8.2ΔVpr (35An D.S. Morizono K. Li Q.X. Mao S.H. Lu S. Chen I.S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 7671-7677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and pHCMV-VSVG (36Akkina R.K. Walton R.M. Chen M.L. Li Q.X. Planelles V. Chen I.S. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2581-2585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using calcium phosphate-mediated transfection (27Zhu Y. Gelbard H.A. Roshal M. Pursell S. Jamieson B.D. Planelles V. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3791-3801Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Virus supernatant was collected at 48, 72, and 96 h post-transfection. Harvested supernatants were cleared by centrifugation at 2,000 rpm and frozen at –80 °C. Vector titers were measured by infection of HeLa cells as described below followed by flow cytometric analysis of cells positive for the reporter molecule, green fluorescent protein (GFP). Vector titers were calculated as Titer = (F × C0/V) × D, where F is the frequency of GFP (+) cells by flow cytometry, C 0 is the total number of target cells at the time of infection, V is the volume of inoculum, and D is the virus dilution factor. Virus dilution factor used for titrations was D = 10. Total number of target cells at the time of infection was 106. Cell Cycle Analysis—Cells were infected with either pHR-VPR or pHR-GFP at a multiplicity of infection of 2.5 to achieve greater than a 90% infection rate was as measured by counting GFP-positive cells. Cells were detached with 2 mm EDTA, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 70% ethanol for over 18 h at –20 °C, then stained with propidium iodide solution for 30 min at 4 °C (20 μg/ml propidium iodide, 11.25 kunitz units/ml RNase A in phosphate-buffered saline). If <90% infection was achieved the cells were fixed in 0.25% paraformaldehyde for 1 h to preserve GFP fluorescence, and only the GFP-positive cells were gated to represent the infected fraction of the cells. Flow cytometric analysis was performed in an Epics Elite ESP (Coulter Corp., Hialeah, FL). Cell cycle analysis was performed using Multicycle AV software (Phoenix Flow Systems, San Diego, CA). All cell cycle experiments were performed at least three times, and typical results are shown. Drug Treatments—LY294002 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) was used at 50 μm. Caffeine (Sigma) was used at 2.5 mm. Doxorubicin (Sigma) was used at 4 μm. Taxol was used at 25 nm. UCN-01 (NSC 638850) was obtained from Developmental Therapeutics Program at the National Cancer Institute and used at 300 nm. Western Blot—HeLa cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (Cell Signaling Research, Beverly, MA). Protein concentration in the lysate was obtained using a modified Lowry method using Bio-Rad protein assay II kit, catalog number 500–002. 100 μg of protein were loaded onto a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline, 0.2% Tween 20, and 5% nonfat dry milk and probed with monoclonal antibodies directed against Chk1 (1:250 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or Chk1-S345-P (Cell Signaling Technology) followed by a horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:1000 dilution; Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were detected with the use of the enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce). All Western blots were performed at least three times, and results of a typical experiment are shown. Luciferase Assays—Transient transfections of U2OS-ATRkd cells for luciferase measurement were performed using electroporation as described previously (27Zhu Y. Gelbard H.A. Roshal M. Pursell S. Jamieson B.D. Planelles V. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3791-3801Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) using 5 μg of either pCMV-Vpr or 5 μg of pCMV-thy and 5 μg of LTRHIV-1-Luc (27Zhu Y. Gelbard H.A. Roshal M. Pursell S. Jamieson B.D. Planelles V. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3791-3801Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). After electroporation, cells were plated at a density of 1 × 106/10 cm dish. At 48 h after the transfection cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase activity with a commercially available luciferase assay kit (Promega Corp.) using a LumiCount microplate reader (Packard Instrument Co.). The luciferase assay was performed using the following settings: photomultiplier tube = 1,100 V; gain level = 5.0; read length = 0.5 s. Each experiment was performed in triplicate, and each measurement was the average of triplicate readings. Luciferase light units were normalized to 1 mg of protein content (Bio-Rad). RNAi-mediated Knockdown—RNAi-mediated knockdown of Chk1 was performed as described in (37Zhao H. Watkins J.L. Piwnica-Worms H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14795-14800Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). ATR RNAi-mediated knockdown was performed as described in Casper et al. (14Casper A.M. Nghiem P. Arlt M.F. Glover T.W. Cell. 2002; 111: 779-789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). The 19-nucleotide targets for short, interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are as follows: RNAi for ATR 9DS, 5′-AAC CTC CGT GAT GTT GCT TGA-3′ (RNAi2; catalog number P-002090; Dharmacon, Boulder, CO); Chk1, 5′-AAG CGT GCC GTA GAC TGT CCA-3′ (cat number P-002076; Dharmacon); control non-silencing RNAi, 5′-AAT TCT CCG AAC GTG TCA CGT-3′ (catalog number 80–1130; Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNAi transfection efficiency was estimated by the percentage of fluorescence-positive cells in the control transfections with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated oligonucleotide. The efficiency of oligonucleotide transfection was always equal or higher than 80%. ATR Function Is Required for Induction of Vpr-induced G 2 Arrest and Transactivation—To begin to probe the potential role of ATR in HIV-1 vpr-induced G2 arrest we first used the pharmacological inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like protein kinases, LY294002 (38Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Smith G.C. Divecha N. Lakin N.D. Jackson S.P. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 64: 91-104PubMed Google Scholar). HeLa cells were treated with either 50 μm LY294002 in Me2SO or with Me2SO alone and then infected with either of the lentivirus vectors, pHR-VPR or pHR-GFP (Fig. 1). These vectors encode either Vpr and GFP as a marker (pHR-Vpr) or GFP alone (pHR-GFP) and are packaged and titrated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Infection with pHR-Vpr, but not pHR-GFP, induces detectable G2 arrest at 24 h post-infection and maximal G2 arrest between 36 and 48 h when it reaches a plateau. 2M. Roshal, B. Kim, Y. Zhu, P. Nghiem, and V. Planelles, unpublished observations. We analyzed the cell cycle profiles of infected cells at 36 h after infection using flow cytometry (Fig. 2). The addition of LY294002 or caffeine (27Zhu Y. Gelbard H.A. Roshal M. Pursell S. Jamieson B.D. Planelles V. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3791-3801Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) largely alleviated the Vpr-induced G2 arrest. The addition of LY294002 or caffeine to pHR-GFP-transduced cells did not significantly affect their cell cycle profiles.Fig. 2Chemical inhibitors of ATM/ATR function block Vpr induced G2 arrest. HeLa cells were treated as indicated and infected with either pHR-VPR or pHR-GFP lentivirus vectors. Cell cycle profiles were analyzed by flow cytometry 36 h after infection.

DMSO, Me2SO.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In a previous study, Bartz et al. (32Bartz S.R. Rogel M.E. Emerman M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2324-2331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) tested whether ATM –/– (AT) cell lines were able to arrest in response to Vpr. Bartz et al. (32Bartz S.R. Rogel M.E. Emerman M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2324-2331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that AT cells transfected with vpr arrest in G2 with indistinguishable kinetics from ATM +/+ cells. The results obtained using inhibitors taken together with those using ATM –/– cells suggest that a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like protein other than ATM, presumably ATR, may be the mediator of Vpr-induced G2 arrest. Therefore, we decided to use more direct experiments to test the role of ATR. A kinase deficient ATR that carries an Asp-2475 to Ala mutation within the catalytic domain of the protein was previously described (15Cliby W.A. Roberts C.J. Cimprich K.A. Stringer C.M. Lamb J.R. Schreiber S.L. Friend S.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 16Nghiem P. Park P.K. Kim Y-s.Y. Desai B.N. Schreiber S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4428-4434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This ATR mutant, termed ATRkd (kinase-deficient), is defective in autophosphorylation and, when expressed in mammalian cells, acts as a dominant-negative regulator of wild-type ATR. U2OS7/ATRkd is a human osteosarcoma cell line that was stably transduced with a tetracycline-inducible ATRkd construct (16Nghiem P. Park P.K. Kim Y-s.Y. Desai B.N. Schreiber S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4428-4434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 40Nghiem P. Park P.K. Kim Y. Vaziri C. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9092-9097Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). We utilized the U2OS/ATRkd cells to further investigate the role of ATR in Vpr-induced G2 arrest (Fig. 3, panel A). Expression of ATRkd was induced by the addition of 2 μm doxycycline for 48 h. After doxycycline induction, the cells were infected with either pHR-VPR or pHR-GFP. Forty-eight hours after infection, we examined the cell cycle profiles of the infected cells. Uninduced U2OS/ATRkd cells displayed a normal cell cycle profile when not infected (Mock) or infected with pHR-GFP and displayed G2 arrest when infected with pHR-VPR. Therefore, U2OS/ATRkd cells, in the absence of ATRkd induction, are sensitive to the cytostatic effect of Vpr. After induction of ATRkd expression with doxycycline, mock-infected cells displayed a normal cell cycle profile. However, under induction conditions, U2OS/ATRkd cells were significantly less sensitive to Vpr-induced G2 arrest. To rule out the possibility that our observations may be specific to U2OS cells, we used an additional ATRkd-inducible cell line, GM847 (15Cliby W.A. Roberts C.J. Cimprich K.A. Stringer C.M. Lamb J.R. Schreiber S.L. Friend S.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Similar to U2OS/ATRkd cells, GM847-ATRkd cells also became resistant to Vpr-induced G2 arrest upon ATRkd expression (data not shown). U2OS cells contain wild-type p53 whereas GM847 cells are transformed with SV40 large T antigen, which blocks p53 function. Consistent with prior observations (24Shostak L.D. Ludlow J. Fisk J. Pursell S. Rimel B.J. Nguyen D. Rosenblatt J.D. Planelles V. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 251: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), the p53 status of the cells does not appear to influence Vpr-induced G2 arrest. Viruses typically manipulate the host cell biology to ultimately benefit their propagation. The ability of HIV-1 to induce G2 arrest through expression of vpr provides at least one known benefit to virus replication; that is, an increase in the transcriptional activity of the LTR. Numerous studies conclude that vpr acts as a moderate transactivator (26Goh W.C. Rogel M.E. Kinsey C.M. Michael S.F. Fultz P.N. Nowak M.A. Hahn B.H. Emerman M. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 27Zhu Y. Gelbard H.A. Roshal M. Pursell S. Jamieson B.D. Planelles V. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3791-3801Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 29Hrimech M. Yao X.J. Bachand F. Rougeau N. Cohen E.A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4101-4109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Connor R.I.

Virology. 2001; 289: 334-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The ability of Vpr to transactivate the viral promoter is related to the fact that the LTR has features of a G2-responsive promoter. For example, induction of G2 arrest with genotoxic agents provides a similar level of transactivation, as does vpr expression. Incubation of caffeine, a drug that alleviates DNA damage-dependent G2 arrest, abrogates vpr-induced transactivation. We reasoned that if activation of ATR is the cause of vpr-induced transactivation and is the relevant target of caffeine-mediated transactivation reduction, then expression of ATRkd should inhibit such transactivation. To test the previous hypothesis, U2OS/ATRkd cells were treated with either control medium or 2 μm doxycycline for 48 h to induce ATRkd (Fig. 3, panel B). These cells were then transfected with pLTRHIV-1-luciferase (a reporter construct in which luciferase is expressed under the control of the LTR) and either a vpr expression vector (pCMV-VPR) or a control expression vector expressing Thy-1 marker (pCMV-thy). Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were lysed, and the luciferase activity was measured and normalized to the protein content of the lysates. All values were normalized first to protein content and then to the transactivation value of the control plasmid transfected in the doxycycline-minus (uninduced) treatment (assigned a value of 1; Fig. 4, panel B). The presence of ATRkd was concomitant with abrogation of the ability of vpr to increase the LTR transactivation. Knockdown of ATR Leads to a Decrease in Vpr-induced G 2 Arrest—Although overexpression of ATRkd has been used to study ATR function, it remains formally possible that the presence of ATRkd, the dominant-negative mutant, affects the function of proteins other than ATR and, therefore, modulates other unsuspected checkpoint proteins. To induce inactivation of ATR by an independent method, we utilized RNAi. RNAi is a recently described mechanism utilized by eukaryotic cells to down-regulate the steady-state levels and/or the translation of specific mRNAs (43Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8186) Google Scholar, 44Lee R.C. Ambros V. Science. 2001; 294: 862-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (2339) Google Scholar, 45Reinhart B.J. Slack F.J. Basson M. Pasquinelli A.E. Bettinger J.C. Rougvie A.E. Horvitz H.R. Ruvkun G. Nature. 2000; 403: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (3801) Google Scholar). RNAi is accomplished by short (21–22 nucleotide) double-stranded RNA oligonucleotides (siRNAs) that are specific for the targeted mRNA. We targeted ATR by transfecting synthetic, duplex RNA oligonucleotides as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As controls we used an oligonucleotide duplex containing a nonspecific sequence and mock-transfection (no oligonucleotide). Detection of ATR protein by Western blot was performed on samples taken 72 h after the initial transfection (Fig. 4, panel A). Densitometry scanning demonstrated a relative ATR protein down-regulation of 70% when using 9DS (ATR-specific) RNAi duplex when compared with the mock transfection. The transfection with control, nonspecific siRNA did not change ATR protein levels. Transduction of Vpr in 9DS-transfected cells either 48 (data not shown) or 72 h after the RNAi transfection yielded a significantly attenuated G2 arrest when compared with either HeLa cells transfected with nonspecific sequence or untransfected cells (Fig. 4, panel B). To rule out the possibility that this observation is due to specific depletion of the G2 cells, we treated the ATR-transfected, Vpr-transduced cells with the M-phase-arresting drug, nocodazole. We reasoned that nocodazole would retain in M those cells that were allowed to leave G2 due to the ATR knockdown. However, if cells treated with ATR siRNA were dying in G2, treatment with nocodazole would not prevent such death. Treatment with nocodazole caused accumulation of the cells at the G2/M boundary. This observation demonstrates that in the absence of ATR function, Vpr-transduced cells are capable of entering mitosis. Vpr Induces Chk1 Phosphorylation—Chk1 is a direct target for ATR in response to DNA damage. When cells sense DNA damage, ATR phosphorylates Chk1 on Ser-345 resulting in increased Chk1 activity. We wished to ascertain whether Vpr-induced ATR activation would also result in phosphorylation of Chk1 on Ser-345. HeLa cells were infected with either pHR-VPR or pHR-GFP. Thirty-six hours post-infection, we analyzed the phosphorylation status of Chk1 by Western blot using a Ser-345-specific phospho-antibody (Fig. 5). Mock-infected (Fig. 5, panel A; lane 1) and pHR-GFP-infected (Fig. 5, panel A; lane 3) cells only revealed"
https://openalex.org/W2026894807,"Mixed lineage kinases (MLKs) are a family of serine/threonine kinases that function in the SAPK signaling cascade. MLKs activate JNK/SAPK in vivo by directly phosphorylating and activating the JNK kinase SEK-1 (MKK4 and -7). Importantly, the MLK member MLK3/SPRK has been shown recently to be a direct target of ceramide and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and to mediate the TNF-α and ceramide-induced JNK activation in Jurkat cells. Here we report that MLK3 can phosphorylate and activate MEK-1 directly in vitro and also can induce MEK phosphorylation on its activation sites in vivo in COS-7 cells. Surprisingly, this induction of MEK phosphorylation does not result in ERK activation in vivo. Rather, in cells expressing active MLK3, ERK becomes resistant to activation by growth factors and mitogens. This restriction in ERK activation requires MLK3 kinase activity, is independent of Raf activation, and is reversed by JNK pathway inhibition either at the level of SEK-1, JNK, or Jun. These results demonstrate that sustained JNK activation uncouples ERK activation from MEK in a manner requiring Jun-mediated gene transcription. This in turn points to the existence of a negative cross-talk relationship between the stress-activated JNK pathway and the mitogen-activated ERK pathway. Thus, our findings imply that some of the biological functions of JNK activators, such as TNF-α and ceramide, may be attributed to their ability to block cell responses to growth and survival factors acting through the ERK/MAPK pathway.

Although the tyrosine kinase activity of MLKs has not yet been reported, MLKs contain the tyrosine kinase signature motif, in addition to the serine/threonine kinase motif (for review see Ref. 5Gallo K.A.

These findings classified MLK family members as mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinases (MAPKKKs) in the stress-activated signaling cascade (for review see Refs. 5Gallo K.A. Johnson G.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar and 10Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). The validity of this classification is strongly substantiated by the recent identification of scaffold proteins that bind several members of the stress-activated protein kinase cascade (i.e. MLK, SEK-1, and JNK) and augment the signaling through the cascade (11Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Tournier C. Yasuda J. Davis R.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 12Yasuda J. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sharma M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell.

The identification of an upstream activator(s) of MLK family members turned out, however, to be a much more complicated task. Besides the signature kinase motif, MLK members contain a Cdc42/Rac-interactive binding domain, the presence of which pointed to the possibility that Cdc42 and Rac may be upstream regulators of MLKs (14Bock B.C. Vacratsis P.O. Qamirani E. Gallo K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14231-14241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 15Hehner S.P. Hofmann T.G. Ushmorov A. Dienz O.

Additional work is required to determine more conclusively the role of Cdc42 or Rac in MLK activation. A breakthrough in understanding MLK activation comes from two recent studies (16Stronach B. Perrimon N. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 377-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 17Sathyanarayana P. Barthwal M.K. Kundu C.N. Lane M.E. Bergmann A. Tzivion G. Rana A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1527-1533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) that used Drosophila MLK as a model. Together, these studies provide genetic and biochemical evidence positioning MLK as a critical JNK activator and define TNF-α and ceramide as potent natural activators of MLKs. These findings are in agreement with other studies (18Harris C.A. Deshmukh M. Tsui-Pierchala B. Maroney A.C. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 103-113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Mielke K. Herdegen T. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 20: 211-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 20Bodner A. Maroney A.C. Finn J.P. Ghadge G. Roos R. Miller R.J. J. Neurochem. 2002; 82: 1424-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) demonstrating a critical role of MLKs in JNK-mediated neuronal apoptosis. Besides SEK-1 (MKK4 and -7), no other MLK targets have been defined clearly (5Gallo K.A. Johnson G.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Few reports indicate that MLK members can activate the ERK/MAPK pathway, possibly through MEK-1 activation, and suggest an oncogenic potential of MLK (21Hartkamp J. Troppmair J. Rapp U.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2195-2202PubMed Google Scholar). However, the details of MEK activation and the oncogenic potential have not been determined. The various MAPK cascades (e.g. ERK1/2, JNK, p38, and ERK5) are often portrayed in the literature as linear cascades, and indications for cross-talk between the various cascades are limited (5Gallo K.A. Johnson G.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 10Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). In this respect, the present study examines the consequences of MLK3 overexpression on the ERK/MAPK pathway and its subsequent response to mitogenic stimuli. We find that MLK3 can phosphorylate and activate MEK-1 both in vitro and in vivo. MEK activation in vivo, however, is uncoupled from ERK activation. Moreover, in cells expressing active MLK3, ERK becomes resistant to activation by mitogens. This restriction in ERK activation involves the SEK-1-JNK-Jun cascade, as demonstrated by the ability of specific inhibitors of the pathway to reverse the blockage of ERK activation. Our results demonstrate negative cross-talk between the stress-activated MLK-SEK-JNK-Jun pathway and the ERK/MAPK pathway, and suggest that sustained activation of the JNK pathway can result in the attenuation of the mitogen-activated ERK pathway. cDNA Constructs, Antibodies, and Kinase Inhibitors—M2-FLAG-MLK3 and M2-FLAG-kinase-dead MLK3 (K144A) were in the pRK-5 mammalian expression vector (for construction details see Ref. 3Gallo K.A.

Phosphospecific antibodies for the active forms of ERK, MEK, and c-Jun and corresponding antibodies for the non-phosphorylated forms were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Antibodies against HA, Myc, and the EE epitope were produced from 12CA5, 9E10, and EE hybridoma cell lines, respectively. Anti-M2-FLAG epitope antibody was purchased from Sigma. JNK inhibitors, JNK inhibitor I (a cell-permeable peptide inhibitor), and JNK inhibitor II (an ATP competitive cell-permeable inhibitor) were from Calbiochem. The MLK inhibitor CEP-11004 was a kind gift from Cephalon. Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For transient expression of proteins, cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions (detailed in the figure legends). Details for cell stimulation and treatment with inhibitors are provided in the figure legends. Cell Extraction and Protein Purification—Cells were lysed for 30 min in ice-cold extraction buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Amersham Biosciences). For immunoprecipitation, cleared cell lysates were incubated at 4 °C for 90 min with the appropriate antibody precoupled to protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The beads were washed twice with extraction buffer, twice with extraction buffer containing 0.5 m LiCl, and twice with kinase assay buffer (40 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm dithiothreitol). Proteins were eluted directly in SDS sample buffer for Western blot analysis or were assayed for kinase activity, as indicated in the figure legend. Kinase Assays—Raf kinase activity was assayed as described previously (22Tzivion G. Luo Z. Avruch J. Nature. 1998; 394: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Briefly, following Myc immunoprecipitation, myc-Raf containing beads were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C in kinase assay buffer (100 μl final volume) supplemented with 100 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 0.3 μg of prokaryotic recombinant GST-MEK-1. Two micrograms of prokaryotic recombinant kinase inactive ERK (K52R) were added, and the samples were incubated for an additional 30 min. Samples were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. 32P incorporation into ERK was quantified by PhosphorImager (PI) analysis (Storm, Amersham Biosciences). Data are presented PI × 103. myc-Raf recovery was determined by Myc immunoblotting. For assessment of ERK kinase activity, following HA immunoprecipitation, HA-ERK containing beads were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C in kinase assay buffer (50 μl final volume) supplemented with 100 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 10 μg of myelin basic protein (MBP, Sigma). Samples were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. 32P incorporation into MBP was quantified by PhosphorImager analysis (data are presented PI unit × 103). ERK recovery was determined by immunoblotting with anti-HA or anti-ERK antibodies, as detailed in the figure legends. To assess MLK3 kinase activity and to determine the effect of MLK3 on the Raf-MEK-ERK-MBP cascade in vitro, the combination of proteins indicated in the figure legends was incubated for the indicated times at 30 °C in kinase assay buffer (100 μl final volume) supplemented with 100 μm ATP and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Samples were separated on 8.5% SDS-PAGE; samples containing MBP were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE. Separated proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes. Kinase activity was analyzed by autoradiography and PhosphorImaging. Phosphospecific antibodies recognizing the activated forms of ERK, MEK, and c-Jun were used for determining in vivo activation levels of ERK, MEK, and Jun, respectively. Expression of Active MLK3 in COS-7 Cells Attenuates ERK Activation by Growth Factors and Mitogens without Affecting Raf Activation—MLK3 functions as a MAPKKK in the stress-activated JNK pathway; however, a few reports suggest that MLK3 may also affect the ERK/MAPK pathway (21Hartkamp J. Troppmair J. Rapp U.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2195-2202PubMed Google Scholar, 29Parameswaran N. Hall C.S. Bock B.C. Sparks H.V. Gallo K.A. Spielman W.S. Mol. Cell.

Biochem. 2002; 12: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of MLK3 on the ERK/MAPK pathway, ERK-1 was co-expressed together with wild-type MLK3 or a kinase-dead MLK3 mutant, MLK3 (K144A), and the basal and mitogen-stimulated ERK-1 kinase activity was examined (Fig. 1, A and B). In serum-deprived COS-7 cells, expression of active MLK3 results in a slight, reproducible activation of basal ERK kinase activity and ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 1B, compare lane 1 with 6, Fig. 2E, compare lane 1 with 3, and Fig. 3, compare lane 1 with 3). This activation depends on MLK3 kinase activity, because it is not observed in cells expressing the kinase-dead MLK3 mutant. In contrast to basal ERK activation, MLK3 expression almost completely attenuates ERK activation in response to EGF and PMA (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 2 and 3 with lanes 6 and 7 and Fig. 1B, compare lane 2 with 7). This attenuation depends on MLK3 kinase activity, because ERK activation is not affected in cells expressing the kinase-dead MLK3 mutant (Fig. 1, A and B). Treatment of cells with the phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A fails to reverse the MLK3 effect on ERK activation (Fig. 1, A and B), indicating that activation of phosphatases sensitive to calyculin A were not responsible for the observed inhibition of ERK activation.Fig. 2MLK3 does not inhibit the Raf-MEK-ERK-MBP phosphorylation cascade in vitro, rather MLK3 activates MEK in vitro and induces MEK phosphorylation at its activation sites in vivo. A, 50 ng of active Raf-1, produced in sf9 cells by co-infection with active Ras and Src, was incubated in kinase assay buffer at 30 °C with either vehicle, 1 μg of wild-type, or kinase-dead MLK3, as indicated. Following a 15-min incubation, vehicle, 500 ng of recombinant GST-MEK-1, and 2 μg of kinase-dead recombinant GST-ERK-1 (kd) were added at the indicated combinations, and the incubation was continued for additional 15 min. The protein samples were separated on 8.5% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. Note that the samples in lanes 2 and 6–10 do not contain Raf. B, the experiment was conducted as in A, except that recombinant wild-type GST-ERK-1 was used instead of kinase-dead ERK-1. MBP was added after the second 15-min incubation, and the samples were incubated for an additional 10 min. Proteins were separated using 12% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. C, 2 μg of recombinant GST-MEK-1 was incubated in kinase buffer with vehicle or 1 μg of MLK3 for 15 min, followed by addition of recombinant kinase-dead GST-ERK-1. After an additional 15 min of incubation, protein samples were resolved on 8.5% SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes, and analyzed for kinase activity by autoradiography (top and middle panel) and immunoblotting with phospho-MEK antibody (bottom panel). D, COS-7 cells were transfected with 1.5 μg of pCDNAI vector expressing EE-tagged MEK-1 and either 3.5 μg of empty pRK-5 vector, pRK-5-MLK3, or pRK-5-MLK3 (kd). Cells were treated with 100 ng/ml EGF and lysed, and the EE-MEK was immunoprecipitated. Phosphorylation of EE-MEK was determined by immunoblotting with MEK activation site phosphospecific antibodies (top panel), and MEK recovery was determined by MEK immunoblotting (bottom panel). E, COS-7 cells were co-transfected with 1.5 μg of pMT2-HA-ERK-1 and either 3.5 μg of empty pRK-5 vector or pRK-5-MLK3, pRK-5-MLK3 (kd), or pCDNAI vector expressing active MEK-1 (MEK-1-DD). ERK-1 phosphorylation in HA immunoprecipitates was determined by immunoblotting with phosphospecific ERK antibodies (top panel), and HA-ERK recovery was determined by immunoblotting with ERK-1 antibody (bottom panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3Dominant negative SEK-1 reverses the effect of MLK3 on ERK activation. COS-7 cells were transfected with 1.5 μg of pMT2-HA-ERK-1 vector together with 1.5 μg of pRK-5 empty vector and 2 μg of pEBG empty vector (lanes 1 and 2), 1.5 μg of pRK-5-MLK3 and 2 μg of pEBG empty vector (lanes 3 and 4), 1.5 μg of pRK-5-MLK3 and 2 μg of pEBG-SEK-1-AL (dn, lanes 5 and 6), or 3.5 μg of pEBG-GST-Bxb-Raf (lanes 7 and 8). Twenty four hours after transfection, cells were deprived of serum for 18 h and treated with vehicle or 100 ng/ml EGF as indicated.

IP, immunoprecipitation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine whether the inhibition of ERK activation was due to an inhibition of Raf activation, Myc-tagged c-Raf-1 was co-expressed with the two MLK3 variants, and the kinase activity of Raf was measured in a coupled kinase assay (Fig. 1C). Expression of active or inactive MLK3 does not affect basal or mitogen-stimulated Raf kinase activity, suggesting that expression of active MLK3 uncouples the activation of ERK from Raf. MLK3 Does Not Inhibit the Raf-MEK-ERK-MBP Phosphorylation Cascade in Vitro, Rather MLK3 Functions as a Potent MEK Kinase, Both in Vitro and in Vivo—To examine whether MLK3 directly inhibits the kinase activities of Raf, MEK, or ERK, we tested the effect of MLK3 on the Raf-MEK-ERK phosphorylation cascade in vitro (Fig. 2, A and B). We find that under in vitro conditions, MLK3 does not affect the ability of Raf to phosphorylate MEK-1 or to activate MEK-1, and it does not affect the ability of MEK-1 to phosphorylate ERK-1 (Fig. 2A). In addition, MLK3 does not affect the ability of MEK-1 to activate ERK-1, and it does not affect ERK-1 kinase activity (Fig. 2B). In contrast to the inhibitory effect of MLK3 on the ERK pathway in vivo, our experiments show that in vitro, MLK3 phosphorylates MEK-1 and activates its kinase activity as potently as Raf (Fig. 2, A and B). These findings demonstrate that MLK3 can function as a MAPKKK also in the ERK/MAPK cascade. Because MEK-1-phosphospecific antibodies that recognize the doubly phosphorylated MEK-1 react with MEK-1 phosphorylated by MLK3 (Fig. 2C), we infer that MEK-1 sites phosphorylated by MLK3 are similar to the sites phosphorylated by Raf. MLK3 also induces MEK-1 phosphorylation in vivo, in a manner depending on its kinase activity (Fig. 2D); however, this does not translate to ERK activation (Fig. 2E). These results indicate that, in cells expressing active MLK3, there is an uncoupling of ERK and MEK kinase activities. Dominant Negative SEK-1 Reverses the Effect of MLK3 on ERK Activation—Because MLK3 apparently phosphorylates both MEK-1 and SEK-1, we wanted to determine which of these two MLK3-associated activities is responsible for inhibition of ERK-1 activation. To exclude the possibility that strong activation of MEK-1 and/or ERK-1 results in a feedback that blocks ERK-1 activation by mitogens, we examined the effects of the active forms of MEK-1 (MEK-1-DD, Fig. 2E , lanes 7 and 8) and Raf-1 (Bxb-Raf, Fig. 3, lanes 7 and 8) on ERK-1 activity. These experiments demonstrate that a constitutive activation of the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway does not result, by itself, in ERK inhibition. To examine the possibility that MLK3 attenuates ERK activation through activation of SEK-1, we co-expressed dominant negative SEK-1 (SEK-1-AL) and MLK3, and we assayed ERK activation induced by EGF (Fig. 3). Co-expression with SEK-1-AL completely reverses the effect of MLK3 on ERK activation (Fig. 3, A and B, compare lanes 3 and 4 with lanes 5 and 6). This reversal occurs without affecting MLK3 expression levels (Fig. 3C). Although this reversal is most likely due to inhibition of endogenous SEK-1 activity, it is important to note that SEK-1-AL may also inhibit MLK3 by out-competing other substrates. This possibility is addressed below by using inhibitors for SEK-1 effectors. JNK Inhibitors and the MLK3 Inhibitor CEP-11004 Reverse the Effect of MLK3 on ERK Activation—To determine which of the components of the JNK pathway are required for the MLK3-induced ERK inhibition, and to exclude the possibility that the SEK-1 dominant negative acts by merely inhibiting the MLK3 kinase activity, we tested the effect of two reportedly specific JNK inhibitors on the ability of MLK3 to inhibit ERK activation (Fig. 4, A and B). Incubation of MLK3-expressing COS-7 cells with two distinct JNK inhibitors (JNK inhibitor I, a cell-permeable peptide inhibitor, and JNK inhibitor II, an ATP competitive cell-permeable inhibitor) for 24 h prior to mitogenic stimulation completely reverses MLK3-induced ERK inhibition (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 5 and 6 with lanes 7–11; Fig. 4B, compare lanes 3 and 4 with lanes 9 and 10). This reversal happens without affecting basal ERK activity or the magnitude of ERK activation by EGF in cells that do not express MLK3 (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 1 and 2 with lanes 3 and 4). To support the notion that MLK3 kinase activity is required for MLK3-induced ERK inhibition, the MLK-specific inhibitor CEP-11004 (17Sathyanarayana P. Barthwal M.K. Kundu C.N. Lane M.E. Bergmann A.

Lett. 2002; 12: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) was used to block MLK3 kinase activity (Fig. 4B). CEP-11004 completely reverses MLK3-induced ERK inhibition, without affecting basal ERK activity (Fig. 4B, compare lanes 3 and 4 with lanes 7 and 8). In parallel experiments, the effects of the JNK inhibitors and CEP-11004 were examined on the ability of MLK3 to induce MEK phosphorylation (Fig. 4C). Because JNK peptide inhibitor I reverses ERK inhibition without affecting the ability of MLK3 to induce MEK-1 phosphorylation (Fig. 4, B and C , lane 9), we conclude that the inhibition in ERK activation is independent of MEK activation but requires JNK activity. In addition, these results demonstrate that MLK3-induced MEK phosphorylation is independent of the ability of MLK3 to activate JNK. MLK3-induced MEK phosphorylation, however, requires MLK3 kinase activity, because CEP-11004 blocks MLK3-induced MEK phosphorylation (Fig. 4C , lane 8). It is important to note that JNK inhibitor II appears not to specifically target JNK, because it inhibits both MLK3 autophosphorylation (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 5 and 6 with lanes 7–9) and MLK3-induced MEK phosphorylation (Fig. 4C, compare lanes 3 and 4 with lanes 7 and 8). c-Jun-mediated Gene Transcription Is Required for the Ability of MLK3 to Block ERK Activation—To examine whether JNK directly affects ERK activation or whether the MLK3-induced ERK inhibition requires c-Jun-mediated gene transcription, we co-expressed dominant negative forms of c-Jun with MLK3 and tested their effect on the MLK3-induced ERK inhibition (Fig. 5). Two forms of dominant negative c-Jun (23Brown P.H. Alani R. Preis L.H. Szabo E. Birrer M.J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 877-886PubMed Google Scholar, 24Brown P.H. Chen T.K. Birrer M.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 791-799PubMed Google Scholar, 25Brown P.H. Kim S.H. Wise S.C. Sabichi A.L. Birrer M.J. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 1013-1021PubMed Google Scholar), one lacking the amino-terminal transactivation domain (TAM-67) and the second impaired in its DNA binding (DBM-3), completely reversed MLK3-induced ERK inhibition (Fig. 5A, compare lanes 3–6 with lanes 9–12). This reversal happens without affecting MLK3 expression (Fig. 5B , bottom panel) or MLK3-induced Jun phosphorylation (Fig. 5B , top panel). In contrast, expression of wild-type c-Jun fails to reverse ERK inhibition and perhaps, if at all, enhances the ability of MLK3 to block ERK activation (Fig. 5A, compare lanes 3 and 4 with 7 and 8). These results demonstrate that c-Jun-mediated gene transcription is critical for the ability of MLK3 to attenuate ERK activation in response to EGF. Notably, expression of active MLK3 results in a significant increase of c-Jun phosphorylation on its activation sites (Fig. 5B, compare lanes 7, 8, 11, and 12 with lanes 15, 16, 19, and 20). This increased phosphorylation is observed on both wild-type and DBM-3 c-Jun but not on TAM-67 c-Jun lacking the transactivation amino-terminal part (Fig. 5B). Together, the results presented in Fig. 5 demonstrate that, even under conditions in which MLK3 is active and is able to activate the SEK-1-JNK-c-Jun pathway, inhibition of c-Jun reverses MLK3-induced MEK-ERK uncoupling. This indicates that MLK3 restricts ERK activation at a point downstream of c-Jun. Cellular response to environmental changes may be affected by variations in cell type, development, and extracellular conditions. The mechanisms underlying differential cellular responses are only partially understood and can be explained in certain cases by differential gene and protein expression patterns. The complex relationships between varying extracellular conditions and cellular response to a distinct stimulus only recently began to be elucidated at the mechanistic level, especially following the introduction of high throughput technologies in genomics and proteomics. A key question that remains unresolved is how a relatively small number of seemingly linear, intracellular signaling pathways can mediate a large variety of responses to a large variety of stimuli. Our results demonstrating a cross-talk relationship between the stress-activated MLK-SEK-1-stress-activated protein kinase/JNK-Jun pathway and the growth factor/MAPK/ERK pathway (Fig. 6) offer one more answer to this key question. Our results suggest that cells exposed to factors that induce sustained activation of MLK3 and the JNK-Jun pathway will be less responsive to growth factor-induced ERK activation. The recent finding that TNF-α and ceramide activate MLK3 (17Sathyanarayana P. Barthwal M.K. Kundu C.N. Lane M.E. Bergmann A. Tzivion G. Rana A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1527-1533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), together with the results presented in this paper, suggest that prolonged exposure to TNF-α or to other factors that result in ceramide generation, may render cells less responsive to growth factor-induced ERK activation. This in turn can result in altered cell cycle control, differentiation or cell growth, all cellular responses involving the ERK/MAPK pathway. Our results demonstrating that MLK3 phosphorylates and activates MEK suggest that under certain physiological conditions MLK3 may function as an activator of the ERK/MAPK pathway, serving as an alternative path to the Raf-mediated pathway (Fig. 6). In addition, these findings imply that short and long phase MLK3 activation may result in a different cellular response; whereas a short phase activation may lead to ERK activation, a long phase activation results in an opposite response. Also, although ERK activation may be mediated directly by MLK3, ERK inhibition is mediated indirectly and involves the ability of MLK3 to activate the JNK-Jun pathway and requires Jun-mediated gene transcription. These implications point to a mechanism in which treatment with the same agonist may result in a different cellular outcome, depending on the duration of the treatment. The MLK family of serine/threonine kinases consists of more than nine related members that may have isoform-specific functions (5Gallo K.A. Johnson G.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Knowledge of their physiological function comes mainly from biochemical studies that classify family members as MAPKKK in the stress-activated JNK pathway and from recent genetic studies in Drosophila, which confirm the biochemical studies and position the Drosophila single MLK isoform (d-MLK/slipper) upstream of JNK (16Stronach B. Perrimon N. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 377-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 17Sathyanarayana P. Barthwal M.K. Kundu C.N. Lane M.E. Bergmann A. Tzivion G. Rana A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1527-1533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The biological function of MLKs in mammalian systems may be, however, more complicated than the one identified in Drosophila. For example, in mammals, MLK isoforms are differentially expressed in different tissues and have some variability in their substrate specificity. In addition, differences in association with scaffold proteins have been reported (5Gallo K.A. Johnson G.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Our findings that MLK3 can activate both SEK-1 and MEK-1 make this picture even more complex. For example, hematopoietic cells that express high levels of MLK3 may respond to cytokines that induce ceramide formation, such as TNF-α, by ERK activation. On the other hand, cells that express little or no MLK3 would be unable to activate ERK under the same conditions. In addition, TNF-α may have a different effect on the same hematopoietic cell, depending on the duration of exposure. Our finding that the MLK3-induced attenuation of ERK activation depends on c-Jun-mediated gene transcription is in agreement with recent findings showing that stable cell lines expressing the constitutively active form of Jun (v-Jun) exhibit attenuated ERK activation (32Black E.J. Walker M. Clark W. MacLaren A. Gillespie D.A. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6540-6548Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In another model, activation of p38 by arsenite attenuates MEK activation by activating protein phosphatase 1 and 2A (33Westermarck J. Li S.P. Kallunki T. Han J. Kahari V.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2373-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The ability of MLK3 to activate the ERK/MAPK pathway and to induce a transformed phenotype in NIH 3T3 cells has also been reported (21Hartkamp J. Troppmair J. Rapp U.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2195-2202PubMed Google Scholar). This work suggested that this transformation is MEK-dependent; however, the role of JNK activation was not examined. Thus, it is possible that the transformed phenotype was a result of Jun activation, but the activity of the MEK-ERK pathway is required for cell survival and normal growth. An important question that remains unanswered is: What mediates the uncoupling of ERK from MEK? Obvious candidates are phosphatases, which can negatively regulate ERK activation. However, we were unable to detect elevated expression of MKP1–3 (potential ERK specific phosphatases) in cells expressing active MLK3 (data not shown). More detailed study will be required to determine whether elevated expression or activity of phosphatases underlies the observed MEK-ERK uncoupling. An additional key question remaining to be resolved is: What is the physiological role of the ability of MLK3 to activate MEK? This question can be addressed by developing MLK forms differentially impaired in their ability to activate MEK and SEK or by examining the effects of Raf- and MLK-specific inhibitors on ERK activation under various physiological conditions in different cell types. In summary, the results in this paper propose a new role for MLK family members in the regulation of the ERK/MAPK pathway both negative and positive. These two opposite effects are mediated by different functions of MLK3: 1) positive regulation through MLK3-mediated phosphorylation and activation of MEK, and (2Ing Y.L. Leung I.W. Heng H.H. Tsui L.C. Lassam N.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1745-1750PubMed Google Scholar) negative regulation through MLK3-induced activation of the SEK-1-JNK-Jun pathway that requires Jun-mediated gene transcription. The physiological consequences of the dual MLK3 potential remain to be uncovered. We thank Joseph Avruch and Kenneth M. Baker for helpful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2020745334,"The activation of matriptase requires proteolytic cleavage at a canonical activation motif that converts the enzyme from a one-chain zymogen to an active, two-chain protease. In this study, matriptase bearing a mutation in its catalytic triad was unable to undergo this activational cleavage, suggesting that the activating cleavage occurs via a transactivation mechanism where interaction between matriptase zymogen molecules leads to activation of the protease. Using additional point and deletion mutants, we showed that activation of matriptase requires proteolytic processing at Gly-149 in the SEA domain of the protease, glycosylation of the first CUB domain and the serine protease domain, and intact low density lipoprotein receptor class A domains. Its cognate inhibitor, hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor-1, may also participate in the activation of matriptase, based on the observation that matriptase activation did not occur when the protease was co-expressed with hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor-1 mutated in its low density lipoprotein receptor class A domain. These results suggest that besides matriptase catalytic activity, matriptase activation requires post-translational modification of the protease, intact noncatalytic domains, and its cognate inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W2159948606,"Endothelial damage is believed to play a key role in the development of both micro- and macrovascular disease in diabetes, and advanced glycation end products (AGEs) may contribute importantly to this. To determine whether glucose-derived AGEs can cause endothelial dysfunction, we examined the effects of albumin AGE-modified by glucose (AGE-Glu) both in vivo, after injection into rabbit femoral artery, and in vitro on rabbit aortic rings and cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Exposure of blood vessels to AGE-Glu, in vivo and in vitro, inhibited endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation, whereas unmodified albumin did not. In isolated rabbit aorta, this effect was reversible after AGE-Glu washout, and the response to the endothelium-independent vasodilator sodium nitroprusside was unaffected by AGE-Glu. In HUVEC, AGE-Glu inhibited endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity, and this was associated with a decrease in serine phosphorylation of this enzyme. Longer term (72 h) incubation decreased HUVEC viability. Use of specific antibodies demonstrated that these effects were mediated by N(epsilon)-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML), an important AGE found in vivo, and by the AGE-R1 receptor. Furthermore, these effects all occurred at CML concentrations similar to those found in the plasma of diabetic patients. These results suggest an important role of AGE in the pathogenesis of diabetic vasculopathy."
https://openalex.org/W1967824539,"Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), produced by commensal sulfate-reducing bacteria, is an environmental insult that potentially contributes to chronic intestinal epithelial disorders. We tested the hypothesis that exposure of nontransformed intestinal epithelial cells (IEC-18) to the reducing agent sodium hydrogen sulfide (NaHS) activates molecular pathways that underlie epithelial hyperplasia, a phenotype common to both ulcerative colitis (UC) and colorectal cancer. Exposure of IEC-18 cells to NaHS rapidly increased the NADPH/NADP ratio, reduced the intracellular redox environment, and inhibited mitochondrial respiratory activity. The addition of 0.2-5 mM NaHS for 4 h increased the IEC-18 proliferative cell fraction (P<0.05), as evidenced by analysis of the cell cycle and proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression, while apoptosis occurred only at the highest concentration of NaHS. Thirty minutes of NaHS exposure increased (P<0.05) c-Jun mRNA concentrations, consistent with the observed activation of mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK). Microarray analysis confirmed an increase (P<0.05) in MAPK-mediated proliferative activity, likely reflecting the reduced redox environment of NaHS-treated cells. These data identify functional pathways by which H2S may initiate epithelial dysregulation and thereby contribute to UC or colorectal cancer. Thus, it becomes crucial to understand how genetic background may affect epithelial responsiveness to this bacterial-derived environmental insult."

 Foulger and Natland
 argue that hotspot volcanism is not very hot and is a shallow-source by-product of plate tectonics. In a related Perspective,
 DePaolo and Manga
 argue that evidence for at least some hotspots being caused by deep plumes originating at the base of Earth9s mantle is strong, although direct evidence is still lacking because of the limited resolution of seismic studies."
https://openalex.org/W2140153733,"Identification of factors regulating cardiomyocyte survival and growth is important to understand the pathogenesis of congenital heart diseases. Little is known about the molecular mechanism of cardiac functions triggered by serotonin. The link between signaling circuitry of external stimuli and the mitochondrial apoptotic machinery is of wide interest in cardiac diseases. Using cultured cardiomyocytes and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)2B-receptor knockout mice as an animal model of dilated cardiomyopathy, for the first time we show that serotonin via the Gq-coupled 5-HT2B-receptor protect cardiomyocytes against serum deprivation-induced apoptosis as manifested by DNA fragmentation, nuclear chromatin condensation, and TUNEL labeling. Serotonin prevents cytochrome c release and caspase-9 and -3 activation after serum deprivation via cross-talks between phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 signaling pathways. Serotonin binding to 5-HT2B-receptor activates ERK kinases to inhibit Bax expression induced by serum deprivation. Serotonin via phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/Akt can activate NF-kappaB that is required for the regulation of the mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT-1). Parallel to these observations, ultrastructural analysis in the 5-HT2B-receptor knockout mice heart revealed pronounced mitochondrial defects in addition to altered mitochondrial enzyme activities (cytochrome oxidase and succinate dehydrogenase) and ANT-1 and Bax expressions. These findings identify 5-HT as a novel survival factor targeting mitochondria in cardiomyocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2027431982,"Amyloid-β (Aβ) is a major constituent of the neuritic plaque found in the brain of Alzheimer's disease patients, and a great deal of evidence suggests that the neuronal loss that is associated with the disease is a consequence of the actions of Aβ. In the past few years, it has become apparent that activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) mediates some of the effects of Aβ on cultured cells; in particular, the evidence suggests that Aβ-triggered JNK activation leads to cell death. In this study, we investigated the effect of intracerebroventricular injection of Aβ(1–40) on signaling events in the hippocampus and on long term potentiation in Schaffer collateral CA1 pyramidal cell synapses in vivo. We report that Aβ(1–40) induced activation of JNK in CA1 and that this was coupled with expression of the proapoptotic protein, Bax, cytosolic cytochrome c, poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, and Fas ligand expression in the hippocampus. These data indicate that Aβ(1–40) inhibited expression of long term potentiation, and this effect was abrogated by administration of the JNK inhibitor peptide, D-JNKI1. In parallel with these findings, we observed that Aβ-induced changes in caspase-3 activation and TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling staining in neuronal cultured cells were inhibited by D-JNKI1. We present evidence suggesting that interleukin (IL)-1β plays a significant role in mediating the effects of Aβ(1–40) because Aβ(1–40) increased hippocampal IL-1β and because several effects of Aβ(1–40) were inhibited by the caspase-1 inhibitor Ac-YVAD-CMK. On the basis of our findings, we propose that Aβ-induced changes in hippocampal plasticity are likely to be dependent upon IL-1β-triggered activation of JNK.

One of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) 1The abbreviations used are: AD, Alzheimer's disease; Aβ, amyloid-β; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; FasL, Fas ligand; IL, interleukin; LTP, long term potentiation; NBM, neurobasal medium; PARP, poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HFS, high frequency stimuli; EPSP, base-line excitatory postsynaptic potential; TUNEL, TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling; ANOVA, analysis of variance. is an accumulation of plaques consisting predominately of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide, which is processed from amyloid precursor protein by the action of β- and γ-secretase (1Yankner B.A. Neuron. 1996; 16: 921-932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). Neuronal cell loss is one feature of AD, and evidence from analysis of changes in cultured cells suggests that Aβ acts as the executioner. Thus, neuronal cultures exposed to Aβ demonstrate signs of apoptosis (2Anderson A.J. Su J.H. Cotman C.W. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1710-1719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Estus S.

Pathol. 1999; 155: 1459-1466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), and previous evidence from this laboratory has revealed that cultured cortical neurons exposed to Aβ(1–40) exhibited increased expression of the tumor suppressor p53; increased activation of caspase-3, a marker of apoptotic cell death; and increased TUNEL reactivity (5Fogarty M.P. Downer E.J. Campbell V.A. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 789-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The evidence is consistent with the idea that activation of the stress-activated protein kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) played a significant role, because depletion of JNK1 following exposure to antisense oligonucleotide prevented the effects of Aβ (5Fogarty M.P. Downer E.J. Campbell V.A. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 789-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Similarly, Morishima et al. (6Morishima Y. Gotoh Y. Zieg J. Barrett T. Takano H. Flavell R. Davis R.J. Shirasaki Y. Greenberg M.E. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7551-7560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that Aβ increased phosphorylation of JNK and c-Jun in cultured cortical neurons and that these changes were associated with expression of the death inducer Fas ligand (FasL). Others have reported findings that support a role for JNK activation in mediating at least certain effects of Aβ. For instance, Aβ-induced parallel increases in JNK activation and TUNEL reactivity in PC12 cells (7Jang J.-H. Surh Y.-J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 973: 228-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), whereas activation of JNK was shown to be localized to amyloid deposits in 7- and 12-month-old mice that overexpress amyloid precursor protein (8Savage M.J. Lin Y.-G. Ciallella J.R. Flood D.G. Scott R.W. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3376-3385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has emerged in several experimental models that increased JNK phosphorylation is associated with deficits in synaptic function; for instance, increased activation of JNK has been reported in the hippocampi of aged rats (9O'Donnell E. Vereker E. Lynch M.A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 10Lynch A.M. Lynch M.A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 15: 1779-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), rats exposed to whole body irradiation (11Lonergan P.E. Martin D.S.D. Horrobin D.F. Lynch M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20804-20811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and rats injected with the proinflammatory cytokine, interleukin (IL)-1β (12Vereker E. O'Donnell E. Lynch M.A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6811-6819Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or lipopolysaccharide (13Vereker E. Campbell V. Roche E. McEntee E. Lynch M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26252-26258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and in all cases glutamate release was decreased. In each of these experimental conditions, long term potentiation (LTP), a model of synaptic plasticity, was markedly impaired, and this impairment was coupled with an increased hippocampal concentration of IL-1β. A number of groups have reported that Aβ administration exerts an inhibitory effect on LTP. For instance, Aβ peptides (14Cullen W.K. Suh Y.H. Anwyl R. Rowan M.J. Neuroreport. 1997; 8: 3213-3217Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 15Freir D.B. Holscher C. Herron C.E. J.

Nature. 2002; 416: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (3721) Google Scholar) inhibited LTP in the CA1 region in vivo, and Aβ peptides also inhibit LTP in dentate gyrus and the CA1 in vitro (18Chen Q.S.

Similarly, a deficit in LTP was reported in aged mice that overexpress amyloid precursor protein and in which deposition of Aβ was observed (22Chapman P.F. White G.L. Jones M.W. Cooper-Blacketer D. Marshall V.J. Irizarry M. Younkin L. Good M.A. Bliss T.V.P. Hyman B. Younkin S.G. Hsiao K.K. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the signaling events induced by Aβ(1–40) that might explain its impact on LTP and report that activation of JNK is a pivotal event in Aβ-induced inhibition of LTP and in Aβ-induced cell death. Preparation of Aβ—Aβ(1–40) (BioSource International) was made up as a 1 mm stock solution in sterile water and allowed to aggregate for 48 h at 30 °C as described previously (5Fogarty M.P. Downer E.J. Campbell V.A. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 789-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For treatment of cortical neurons, aggregated Aβ(1–40) was diluted to a final concentration of 2 μm in prewarmed neurobasal medium (NBM; Invitrogen). For analysis of signaling events stimulated by Aβ, aggregated Aβ(1–40) at 37 °C was injected intracerebroventricularly (5 μl; 1nmol in sterile water). This Aβ preparation (and concentration) was adopted because it was shown to produce consistent, reliable, and reproducible results in a number of markers, suggesting that cell death occurred in cultured cells (5Fogarty M.P. Downer E.J. Campbell V.A. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 789-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Animals—Groups of young male Wistar rats (200–300 g; Bio Resources Unit, Trinity College, Dublin 2, Ireland), maintained at an ambient temperature of 22–23 °C under a 12 h light-dark schedule, were used in this experiment. The rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal administration of urethane (1.5 mg/kg) and were injected intracerebroventricularly with either sterile water (5 μl) or Aβ(1–40). 6 h post-injection, the rats were killed by decapitation, the brains were rapidly removed on ice, and area CA1 was dissected free. The tissue was cross-chopped (350 × 350 μm) and frozen in Krebs solution containing 10% Me2SO as previously described (23McGahon B. Lynch M.A. Neuroscience. 1996; 72: 847-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) until required for analysis. Analysis of JNK Phosphorylation, c-Jun Phosphorylation, Cytosolic Cytochrome c Expression, Bax Expression, FasL Expression, and PARP Cleavage—JNK phosphorylation, c-Jun phosphorylation, and expression of Bax, cytosolic cytochrome c, PARP, and FasL were analyzed in samples prepared from CA1 tissue using a method previously described (13Vereker E. Campbell V. Roche E. McEntee E. Lynch M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26252-26258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In the case of JNK, c-Jun, FasL, and PARP, tissue homogenates were diluted to equalize for protein concentration, and aliquots (100 μl, 2 mg/ml) were added to 100 μl of sample buffer (0.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 10% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.05% bromphenol blue (w/v)), boiled for 5 min, and loaded onto 10% SDS-PAGE gels. In the case of cytochrome c, cytosolic fraction was prepared by homogenizing slices of hippocampus in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin), incubating for 20 min on ice, and centrifuging (15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C). The supernatant (i.e. cytosolic fraction) was suspended in sample buffer to a final concentration of 300 μg/ml, boiled for 3 min, and loaded (6 μg/lane) onto 12% SDS-PAGE gels. The pellet (i.e. mitochondrial fraction) was resuspended in sample buffer to a final concentration of 300 μg/ml, boiled for 3 min, and loaded (6 μg/lane) onto 12% SDS-PAGE gels. Bax expression was assessed in the mitochondrial fraction. In all experiments the proteins were separated by application of 32 mA constant current for 25–30 min, transferred onto nitrocellulose strips (225 mA for 90 min), and immunoblotted with the appropriate antibody. For JNK phosphorylation, the proteins were immunoblotted with an antibody that specifically targets phosphorylated JNK (1:300 in Tris-buffered saline (TBS)-Tween (0.05% Tween 20) containing 0.1% BSA; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) for 2 h at room temperature. The blots were stripped and stained for total JNK. Nitrocellulose strips were probed with a mouse monoclonal IgG1 antibody (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) raised against a recombinant protein corresponding to amino acids 1–384 representing full-length JNK1 of human origin. To assess phosphorylation of c-Jun, we immunoblotted with a mouse monoclonal IgG1 antibody (1:400 in PBS-Tween (0.1% Tween 20) containing 2% nonfat dried milk) raised against the peptide corresponding to a short amino acid sequence of phosphorylated c-Jun of human origin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.). To assess cytoplasmic cytochrome c, a rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:250 in PBS-Tween containing 2% nonfat dried milk; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) raised against recombinant protein corresponding to amino acids 1–104 of cytochrome c was used. In the case of FasL, we immunoblotted with a rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:500 in TBS-Tween containing 1% BSA; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) raised against a peptide corresponding to a short amino acid sequence at the N terminus of FasL of human origin. Bax expression was assessed in the mitochondrial fraction using a mouse monoclonal IgG1 antibody (1:200 in TBS-Tween containing 1% BSA; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.). To assess the cleavage of PARP, we immunoblotted with an antibody (1:500 in PBS-Tween (0.1% Tween 20) containing 2% nonfat dried milk) raised against the epitope corresponding to amino acids 764–1014 of PARP of human origin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.). All of the nitrocellulose strips were reprobed for actin expression to ensure equal loading of protein on all SDS-PAGE gels. Actin expression was assessed using a mouse monoclonal IgG1 antibody (1:300 in PBS-Tween containing 2% nonfat dried milk) corresponding to an amino acid sequence mapping at the C terminus of actin of human origin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.). Immunoreactive bands were detected as follows: peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) and Supersignal chemiluminescence (Pierce) for JNK, c-Jun, Bax, and actin and peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) and Supersignal (Pierce) for cytochrome c, FasL, and PARP. Induction of LTP in CA1 in Vivo—Male Wistar rats (175–200 g; Biomedical Facility, University College, Dublin, Ireland) were anesthetized with urethane (1.5 mg/kg), placed in a stereotaxic frame, and assessed for LTP as described previously (16Freir D.B. Herron C.E. J. Neurophysiol. 2003; 89: 2917-2922Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Small holes were drilled in the skull to allow insertion of a guide cannula to facilitate intracerebroventricular injection and to allow insertion of the reference, stimulating, and recording electrodes. The recording electrode was positioned in the stratum radiatum of area CA1 (3 mm posterior and 2 mm lateral to bregma), and a bipolar stimulating electrode was placed in the Schaffer collateral/commissural pathway distal to the recording electrode (4 mm posterior and 3 mm lateral to bregma). The cannula was positioned above the lateral ventricle in the opposite hemisphere to that of the electrodes (1 mm posterior and 1.2 mm lateral to bregma). Test shocks (0.033 Hz) were delivered to the Schaffer collateral/commissural pathway, and base-line excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs), recorded at 35–40% of maximal response, were sampled for at least 30 min to allow the response to stabilize. Rats were then injected intracerebroventricularly with either Aβ(1–40) (1nmol in 5 μl), the membrane soluble JNK inhibitor D-JNKI1 (1 nmol in 5 μl), combined Aβ(1–40) and D-JNKI1 (1 nmol of each in 5 μl) or vehicle (5 μl sterile water); and base-line recordings were monitored for a further 60 min before delivery of a series of high frequency stimuli (HFS; 3 × 10 trains of 10 stimuli at 200Hz; intertrain interval, 20 s). Responses to test shock stimulation were recorded for a further 5 h post-HFS, and deep body temperature was maintained at 36.5 ± 0.5 °C using heating pads. Paired pulse facilitation with an interstimulus interval of 50 ms was also examined preinjection, 1 h post-injection of drug/vehicle (prior to HFS), and 5 h following HFS. Deep body temperature was maintained at 36.5 ± 0.5 °C using heating pads. Extracellular field potentials were amplified (×100), filtered at 5 kHz, digitized, and recorded using MacLab software. The EPSP slope was used to measure synaptic efficacy. EPSPs are expressed as percentages of the mean initial slope measured during the first 10 min of the base-line recording period. Analysis of IL-1β Concentration—IL-1β concentration was analyzed in homogenate prepared from CA1 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R & D Systems) and in supernatants prepared from cultured cells as described below. Antibody-coated (100 μl; final concentration, 1.0 μg/ml; diluted in PBS, pH 7.3; goat anti-rat IL-1β antibody) 96-well plates were incubated overnight at room temperature, washed several times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 300 μl of blocking buffer (PBS, pH 7.3, containing 5% sucrose, 1% BSA, and 0.05% NaN3), and washed. IL-1β standards (100 μl; 0–1000 pg/ml in PBS containing 1% BSA) or samples (homogenized in Krebs solution containing 2 mm CaCl2) were added, and incubation proceeded for 2 h at room temperature. Secondary antibody (100 μl; final concentration, 350 ng/ml in PBS containing 1% BSA and 2% normal goat serum; biotinylated goat anti-rat IL-1β antibody) was added and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The wells were washed, and detection agent (100 μl; horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin; 1:200 dilution in PBS containing 1% BSA) was added and incubated continued for 20 min at room temperature. Substrate solution (100 μl; 1:1 mixture of H2O2 and tetramethylbenzidine) was added and incubated at room temperature in the dark for 1 h, after which time the reaction was stopped using 50 μl of 1 m H2SO4. Absorbance was read at 450 nm, and the values were corrected for protein (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) and expressed as pg IL-1β/mg protein. Preparation of Cultured Cortical Neurons—Primary cortical neurons were isolated and prepared from 1-day-old Wistar rats (BioResources Unit, Trinity College, Dublin 2, Ireland) and maintained in NBM as previously described (5Fogarty M.P. Downer E.J. Campbell V.A. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 789-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The rats were decapitated, the cerebral cortices were dissected, and the meninges were removed. The cortices were incubated in PBS with trypsin (0.25 μg/ml) for 25 min at 37 °C. The cortical tissue was then triturated in PBS containing soy bean trypsin inhibitor (0.2 μg/ml) and DNase (0.2 mg/ml) and gently filtered through a sterile mesh filter (40 μm). The suspension was centrifuged at 2000 × g for 3 min at 20 °C, and the pellet was resuspended in warm NBM, supplemented with heat inactivated horse serum (10%), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 units/ml), and glutamax (2 mm). The suspended cells were plated at a density of 0.25 × 106 cells on circular 10-mm diameter coverslips, coated with poly-l-lysine (60 μg/ml), and incubated in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2:95% air at 37 °C for 2 h prior to being flooded with prewarmed NBM. After 48 h, 5 ng/ml cytosine-arabinofuranoside was added to the culture medium to suppress the proliferation of non-neuronal cells. The media were exchanged for fresh media every 3 days, and the cells were grown in culture for up to 7 days prior to treatment. In one set of experiments the neurons were incubated in the absence/presence of Aβ(1–40) (2 μm in NBM) for 72 h with or without caspase-1 inhibitor (100 nm in NBM; Ac-YVAD-CMK; Calbiochem) or D-JNKI1 (1 μm in NBM; Alexis Biochemicals). In the case of Aβ-treated neurones, the supernatant was removed at 20 h, and IL-1β concentration was assessed. At 72 h, the cells were rinsed in TBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in TBS for immunohistochemical assessment of JNK phosphorylation, caspase-3 activation, and DNA fragmentation. The cells were incubated in Aβ(1–40) (2 μm) for 18 h for analysis of changes in gene expression. In a second series of experiments, the neurons were incubated in the absence/presence of IL-1β (5 ng/ml in NBM) with or without D-JNKI1 (1 μm in NBM) for 18 h and harvested in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin) for assessment of c-Jun phosphorylation and FasL expression. Analysis of Bax mRNA and caspase-3 mRNA—Total RNA was extracted from cortical neurones using TRI reagent (Sigma). cDNA synthesis was performed on 1 μg of total RNA using oligo(dT) primer as per the manufacturer's instructions (Superscript reverse transcriptase; Invitrogen). The RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase I (Invitrogen) at 1 unit/μg of RNA for 15 min at 30 °C. Equal amounts of cDNA were used for PCR amplification for a total of 28 cycles. Primers were pretested through an increasing number of amplification cycles to obtain reverse transcriptase-PCR products in the exponential range. In the case of Bax mRNA expression following Aβ treatment primers used were as follows: rat Bax, sense 5′-GCAGAGAGGATGGCTGGGGAGA-3′, and antisense 5′-TCCAGACAAGCAGCCGCTCACG-3′ (25Ray S.K. Fidan M. Nowak M.W. Wilford G.G. Hogan E.L. Banik N.L. Brain Res. 2000; 852: 326-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar); rat β-actin, sense 5′-GAAATCGTGCGTGACATTAAAGAGAAGCT and antisense 5′-TCAGGAGGAGCAATGATGATCTTGA-3′. The cycling conditions were 95 °C for 5 min followed by cycles of 95 °C for 75 s, 52 °C for 75 s, and 72 °C for 90 s. A final extension step was carried out at 70 °C for 10 min. These primers generated Bax PCR products of 352 base pairs and β-actin PCR product of 360 base pairs. In the case of caspase-3 mRNA expression following treatment with Aβ(1–40) and Bax mRNA expression following treatment with IL-1β, multiplex PCR was performed using the Quantitative PCR Cytopress detection kit (Rat Apoptosis Set 2; BioSource International) generating caspase-3 PCR products of 320 base pairs, Bax PCR products of 352 base pairs and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase PCR product of 532 base pairs. The cycling conditions were 94 °C for 1 min and 58 °C for 2 min. A final extension step was carried out at 70 °C for 10 min. The PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels, photographed, and quantified using densitometry. The target genes were normalized to expression of β-actin or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase housekeeping genes. No observable change in β-actin or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA was observed in any of the treatment conditions TUNEL Staining—Apoptotic cell death was assessed using the DeadEnd colorimetric apoptosis detection system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cultured cortical neurones were prepared from neonatal rats as described above and maintained in NBM for 12 days before incubating in the absence/presence of Aβ(1–40) (1 μm in NBM) for 72 h with or without caspase-1 inhibitor (100 nm in NBM) or D-JNKI1 (1 μm in NBM). Biotinylated nucleotide was incorporated at 3′-OH DNA ends by incubating cells with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase for 30 min at 37 °C. The washed cells were incubated in horseradish peroxidase-labeled streptavidin and then incubated in diaminobenzidine chromogen solution, and TUNEL-positive cells were calculated as a proportion of the total cell number. Immunohistochemical Staining for Phosphorylated JNK and Activated Caspase-3—Cultured cortical neurones were prepared from neonatal rats as described previously (5Fogarty M.P. Downer E.J. Campbell V.A. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 789-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and maintained in NBM for 12 days before incubating in the absence/presence of Aβ(1–40) (1 μm in NBM) for 72 h with or without caspase-1 inhibitor (100 nm in NBM) or D-JNKI1 (1 μm in NBM). The cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in TBS, permeabilized in 0.1% Triton containing 0.2% proteinase K, washed in TBS, and refixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. The cells were incubated with 2.5% (v/v) normal goat serum (Vector Laboratories) in TBS. The blocking serum was removed, and the cells were incubated overnight with either antiactive p-JNK (1:200 in TBS containing 2.5% normal goat serum; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) or antiactive caspase-3 (1:250 in TBS containing 2.5% (v/v) normal goat serum; Promega) in a humidified chamber. The cells were washed in TBS and incubated in the dark for 2 h at room temperature in either fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG or IgM (1:100; Biosource) to immunolabel p-JNK or l-rhodamine-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (1: 100; Biosource) to immunolabel active caspase-3. The cells were washed in TBS, mounted with an aqueous mounting medium (Vectastain; Vector Laboratories), and sealed. The slides were examined under a Zeiss fluorescence microscope with the appropriate filter (fluorescein isothiocyanate: excitation, 495 nm, and emission, 525 nm; l-rhodamine: excitation, 540 and 574 nm, and emission, 602 nm). Statistical Analysis—The data are expressed as the means ± S.E. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to determine whether there were significant differences between conditions. When this analysis indicated significance (at the 0.05 level), post hoc Student Newmann-Keuls test analysis was used to determine which conditions were significantly different from each other. A repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare mean EPSP slopes at different time points in the electrophysiological experiments. When comparisons were being made between two treatments, an unpaired Student's t test for independent means was performed. Fig. 1a shows a sample immunoblot in which a marked increase in p-JNK was observed following intracerebroventricular injection of Aβ(1–40); assessment of the mean data obtained from densitometric analysis revealed a statistically significant increase in JNK phosphorylation induced by Aβ (p < 0.001; Student's t test for independent means; n = 5). In contrast to the change in JNK phosphorylation, total JNK expression was similar in Aβ-treated and control rats as demonstrated in the sample immunoblot and the mean data (Fig. 1b). The Aβ-induced increase in JNK phosphorylation was paralleled by the change in c-Jun phosphorylation; thus, the sample immunoblot shown in Fig. 1c and the mean data obtained from densitometric analysis indicated that Aβ(1–40) induced a marked increase in c-Jun phosphorylation (p < 0.05; Student's t test for independent means; n = 5). Protein loading was checked by reprobing immunoblots for actin, and the data indicate that its expression was similar in samples prepared from control and Aβ-treated rats. We argued that this Aβ-induced increase in JNK activation may contribute to the previously reported Aβ-induced inhibition of LTP (16Freir D.B. Herron C.E. J. Neurophysiol. 2003; 89: 2917-2922Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and to assess this, rats were injected intracerebroventricularly with Aβ(1–40) alone or in combination with the peptide inhibitor, D-JNKI1. Fig. 2a shows that, in control rats tetanic stimulation led to an immediate and persistent increase in EPSP slope (p < 0.001; ANOVA); treatment with D-JNKI1 (1nmol) did not significantly affect this change. In contrast, intracerebroventricular injection of Aβ(1–40) inhibited LTP (p < 0.001; ANOVA, Fig. 2b); the effect was observed immediately such that the mean percentage change in the EPSP slope in the 5 min immediately following tetanic stimulation was significantly reduced in Aβ-treated compared with control rats (p < 0.01; ANOVA; Fig. 3a). The Aβ-associated change persisted so that the mean percentage changes in EPSP slopes in the final 5-min period of each hour were also significantly reduced in Aβ-treated rats compared with control animals (***, p < 0.001 in all cases; ANOVA; Fig. 3, b–f). Co-injection of D-JNKI1 and Aβ(1–40) reversed the inhibitory effect of Aβ(1–40) (Fig. 2b), but this effect was not apparent until 2 h after tetanic stimulation (+++, p < 0.001; ANOVA; F"
https://openalex.org/W1992490895,"Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response to a blood-borne infection that is associated with an extremely high rate of morbidity and mortality. The present study investigates the role of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 in host responses to bacterial endotoxemia. After administration of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide, 50% of wild-type mice die within 96 h. COX-2 deficient mice displayed a dramatic improvement in survival with reduced leukocyte infiltration into critical organs (kidneys and lungs) and a blunted and delayed induction of the cytokine inducible genes nitric oxide synthase 2 and heme oxygenase-1. Translocation and activation of transcription factors important for signaling events during an inflammatory response, such as nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, were also markedly reduced. While the absence of COX-2 did not alter the induction of several pro-inflammatory cytokines in tissue macrophages, induction of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was exaggerated. Administration of IL-10 to wild-type mice reduced NF-kappaB activation. Taken together, our data suggest that COX-2 deficient mice are resistant to many of the detrimental consequences of endotoxemia. These beneficial effects occur, in part, by a compensatory increase in IL-10 that counterbalances the pro-inflammatory host response to endotoxemia."
https://openalex.org/W2132413449,"The Helicobacter pylori vacuolating cytotoxin gene, vacA, is naturally polymorphic, the two most diverse regions being the signal region (which can be type s1 or s2) and the mid region (m1 or m2). Previous work has shown which features of vacA make peptic ulcer and gastric cancer-associated type s1/m1 and s1/m2 strains toxic. vacA s2/m2 strains are associated with lower peptic ulcer and gastric cancer risk and are non-toxic. We now define the features of vacA that determine the non-toxicity of these strains. To do this, we deleted parts of vacA and constructed isogenic hybrid strains in which regions of vacA were exchanged between toxigenic and non-toxigenic strains. We showed that a naturally occurring 12-amino acid hydrophilic N-terminal extension found on s2 VacA blocks vacuolating activity as its removal (to make the strain s1-like) confers activity. The mid region of s2/m2 vacA does not cause the non-vacuolating phenotype, but if VacA is unblocked, it confers cell line specificity of vacuolation as in natural s1/m2 strains. Chromosomal replacement of vacA in a non-toxigenic strain with vacA from a toxigenic strain confers full vacuolating activity proving that this activity is entirely controlled by elements within vacA.

Research has focused on the most active form of VacA, but most H. pylori clinical isolates express less vacuolating or non-vacuolating forms (31Atherton J.C. Cao P. Peek R.M. Tummuru M.K.R. Blaser M.J. Cover T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17771-17777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar). The gene, vacA, is naturally polymorphic and differences are most marked in two areas: the signal region, encoding the signal peptide and the N terminus of the mature protein (which may be type s1 or s2) and the mid region, encoding part of the p58 domain (type m1 or m2) (31Atherton J.C.

Hawkey C.J. Atherton J.C. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1999; 37: 1203-1205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The vacA allelic type is associated with vacuolating activity in vitro: strains with s1/m1 vacA cause more extensive vacuolation in HeLa cells than those with s1/m2 vacA, and vacA s2/m2 strains are invariably non-vacuolating (31Atherton J.C.

The existence of stable polymorphisms affecting toxin function is of major biological interest; it may form a paradigm for varying functionality of proteins in other bacteria with high levels of genetic recombination in which mosaic genes are common. However, for H. pylori, vacA polymorphism is also potentially of major clinical importance: vacA s2/m2 strains are less frequently associated with both peptic ulceration and gastric carcinoma than vacA s1/m1 or s1/m2 strains (33Atherton J.C.

In this report, we define the determinants of non-toxicity in H. pylori with type s2/m2 vacA. Work by us and others on the most toxic s1/m1 type of vacA has guided our approach. We have previously shown that vacA transcription is higher for some toxic than for some non-toxic strains (39Forsyth M.H. Atherton J.C. Blaser M.J. Cover T.L. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 3088-3094Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We and others have also shown that the N terminus of mature s1/m1 VacA in toxic strains is one important determinant of toxicity and that adding an s2-like N-terminal extension blocks activity (21Ye D.

However, one cannot extrapolate from this to imply that the N terminus of natural s2/m2 strains is the cause of their non-toxicity, so we aimed to determine whether this was indeed the case. Naturally occurring vacA type s1/m1 strains cause vacuolation in a wider range of cell lines than s1/m2 strains (19Pagliaccia C. de Bernard M. Lupetti P. Ji X. Burroni D. Cover T.L. Papini E.

Finally, it is unclear whether elements outside vacA in s2/m2 strains contribute to non-toxicity, and we aimed to resolve this issue.

Such hybrids were constructed using plasmids pA153::cat and pCTB2::cat, containing the promoter and 5′ terminus of vacA, including the signal region, from strains Tx30a (vacA s2/m2; Tox–) and 60190 (vacA s1/m1; Tox+), respectively, together with the 3′ terminus of the upstream gene cysS with a chloramphenicol resistance marker (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; cat) inserted immediately downstream (see Table I). These pBluescript-derived plasmids act as suicide vectors in H. pylori, thus chromosomal recombinants were constructed by natural transformation, allelic exchange, and chloramphenicol rescue as previously described (41Letley D.P. Atherton J.C. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3278-3280Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). Transformation of pA153::cat and pCTB2::cat into their respective homologous strains resulted in the isolation of control strains Tx30a/CAT and 60190/CAT, containing the insertion of cat upstream of the vacA promoter. Transformation of Tx30a with pCTB2::cat and 60190 with pA153::cat gave rise to multiple hybrid strains. DNA extracted from single colonies (45Atherton J.C. Clayton C.L. Mobley H.L.T. Methods in Molecular Medicine, Helicobacter pylori Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1997: 133-145Google Scholar) was typed for vacA signal and mid region by allele-specific PCR, as previously described (31Atherton J.C. Cao P. Peek R.M. Tummuru M.K.R.

Only vacA type s1 recombinants were identified from the transformation of Tx30a with pCTB2::cat, and one was selected and termed Tx30a/P1S1. For the transformation of 60190 with pA153::cat, type s1 and s2 recombinants were identified and termed 60190/P2S1 and 60190/P2S2, respectively. The precise extent of recombination was determined for these mutants by nucleotide sequencing. pA153::cat and pCTB2::cat were similarly transformed into the toxigenic strain 84-183 (vacA s1/m1) to give hybrids 84-183/P2S2 and 84-183/P1S160190, respectively. Construction of vacA Mid Region Hybrid Strains—The effect of vacA mid region type was studied in a similar manner. Plasmids pNV5 and pNV2, containing 3′ terminal 3576 bp and 3587 bp of vacA with 1 kb and 1.5 kb of downstream sequence from strains Tx30a and 60190, respectively, with a kanamycin resistance marker (aminoglycoside phosphotransferase; aphA) inserted 0.5 kb 3′ to vacA, within the fecE gene, were introduced into strain Tx30a by natural transformation, allelic exchange, and kanamycin marker rescue. Recombinants were typed for vacA signal and mid region by allele-specific PCR (31Atherton J.C. Cao P. Peek R.M. Tummuru M.K.R. Blaser M.J. Cover T.L. J. Biol.

Similarly, transformation of strain 60190 with pNV2 and pNV5 created the control strain 60190/KAN and the hybrid strain 60190/M2 (vacA s1/m2), respectively. Tx30a/M1 was further transformed with pCTB2::cat to produce the hybrid strain Tx30a/P1S1M1 (vacA s1/m1). Site-directed Mutagenesis of vacA—The vacA mutant Tx30a/N1, containing an in-frame deletion of the region encoding the s2-specific N-terminal extension, was constructed by first deleting this 36-bp region from the cloned vacA fragment in plasmid pA153::cat using inverse PCR with primers NdelF (5′-GCTTTTTTCACAACCGTGATCATTCCAGCC-3′) and NdelR (5′-AGCCCCCAGTTCGGTGCCCATTAACACCC-3′), which bound to nucleotides 472–501 and 407–435 in the vacA sequence of Tx30a (31Atherton J.C.

Template DNA was removed by DpnI restriction endonuclease digestion (New England BioLabs (UK) Ltd.), and the PCR product was end-polished using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene Europe), 5′-phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase in the presence of 1 mm ATP, and blunt-end-religated. Following transformation into Escherichia coli strain DH5α, plasmid DNA was extracted, and the presence of the 36-bp deletion screened by PCR using primers VA1F and VA1R (31Atherton J.C. Cao P.

The vacA mutation was introduced into chromosomal vacA of H. pylori strain Tx30a by natural transformation, allelic exchange, and chloramphenicol marker rescue, and the presence of the vacA mutation was confirmed by PCR as before. Quantification of VacA—VacA production was quantified by antigen detection ELISA as previously described (47Cover T.L. Blaser M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10570-10575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, duplicate 48-h broth culture supernatant samples of each strain were adsorbed to a microtiter plate overnight at 4 °C, blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (Sigma), and bound antigen incubated with a 1:5,000 dilution of rabbit antiserum to either purified VacA from the type s1/m1 strain 60190 (Ab123) (47Cover T.L. Blaser M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10570-10575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or the recombinant VacA p58 fragment from either this strain (Ab929) (18Garner J.A. Cover T.L. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 4197-4203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or the m2 type strain Tx30a (Ab927), all kindly donated by Dr. T. L. Cover, Nashville, TN. For detection we used anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) then orthophenyldiamine/hydrogen peroxide. ELISA values were expressed as A 492 nm, corrected for bacterial density (A 600 nm). Detection of VacA by Immunoblotting—H. pylori broth culture supernatants or water extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose by electroblotting. Nitrocellulose blots were blocked in 5% (w/v) milk in PBS-Tween 20 (PBS-T) then incubated with rabbit anti-VacA antiserum (Ab123, 927, or 929) diluted 1:10,000. Blots were washed three times in PBS-T, incubated in anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate, washed six times in PBS-T, and visualized by ECL™ detection (Amersham Biosciences). Determination of VacA Activity—Water extracts were prepared by harvesting 48-h growth from a single plate into 1 ml of sterile distilled water, vortexing for 30 s, and incubating at room temperature for 20 min. Cells were removed by microcentrifugation, and the supernatant containing VacA was filter-sterilized. Vacuolating activity was determined using three different epithelial cell lines: HeLa, AGS (a human gastric adenocarcinoma cell line), and RK13 (a rabbit kidney cell line). Assays were performed by adhering 104 epithelial cells in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% FCS (both Invitrogen) to a microtiter plate overnight. The media was then replaced with fresh media containing 10 mm ammonium chloride, and a 5-fold dilution of water extract. Cells were incubated overnight and then visually assessed for vacuolation by light microscopy. The Type s2 Promoter/Signal Region of vacA Determines the Non-toxic Status of the Tox–Strain Tx30a—Our previous work had shown that vacA s1/m1 strains are usually toxic and vacA s2/m2 strains invariably non-toxic (31Atherton J.C. Cao P. Peek R.M. Tummuru M.K.R. Blaser M.J. Cover T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17771-17777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar). Our first aim was to define whether the promoter/signal region of a candidate non-toxic vacA s2/m2 strain, Tx30a, was directly responsible for its non-vacuolating phenotype. To do this, we used allelic exchange to replace the promoter and signal region of vacA on the Tx30a chromosome with that of strain 60190 (tox+; vacA s1/m1) to make an artificial hybrid s1/m2 vacA construct in a non-toxigenic strain background, which we called Tx30a/P1S1 (see “Materials and Methods” and Fig. 1). Nucleotide sequencing of this hybrid showed the crossover point to be between 588 and 763 in the Tx30a sequence (31Atherton J.C. Cao P. Peek R.M. Tummuru M.K.R. Blaser M.J. Cover T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17771-17777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar) and proved that the promoter region was identical to that in the s1/m1 strain 60190. To ensure that insertion of the chloramphenicol resistance marker (cat), used for the allelic exchange experiment, was not influencing VacA production or activity, we also constructed the control strain Tx30a/CAT with cat inserted between cysS and vacA (see “Materials and Methods”). Insertion of the chloramphenicol cassette in Tx30a did not affect VacA levels in broth culture supernatants, as determined by antigen detection ELISA, and all later comparisons used Tx30a/CAT as control. Replacement of the signal and promoter regions with those from 60190 increased VacA production as determined by ELISA using antiserum Ab927 (Tx30a/CAT mean VacA production 0.03 ± 0.01, n = 10, versus Tx30a/P1S1 mean 0.17 ± 0.05, n = 8, p < 0.005, t test). This finding was confirmed by immunoblot using the same antiserum (Fig. 2). As expected, water extracts of the non-toxigenic control strain, Tx30a/CAT, did not cause vacuolation of any of the three cell lines tested (Fig. 3A and Table II). However, Tx30a/P1S1 water extracts induced extensive cytoplasmic vacuolation of RK13 cells following overnight incubation (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, the vacuolating activity observed for this strain was cell line-specific, because the same water extracts were unable to induce vacuolation of HeLa and AGS cells (Table II). This is consistent with the described phenotype of a naturally occurring vacA s1/m2 strain (19Pagliaccia C. de Bernard M. Lupetti P. Ji X. Burroni D. Cover T.L. Papini E. Rappuoli R. Telford J.L. Reyrat J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10212-10217Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Thus, naturally occurring differences in vacA signal regions are directly responsible for VacA production and activity.Fig. 3Effect of Tx30a control and isogenic mutant water extracts on RK13 cells. RK13 cells were grown in 96-well microtiter plates for 24 h (104 cells/well) and then incubated overnight with 1/5 dilution of water extract of either strain Tx30a/CAT (A), Tx30a/P1S1 (B), Tx30a/N1 (C), Tx30a/M1 (D), or Tx30a/P1S1M1 (E).

We recently described de novo expression of Wt1 in myocardial blood vessels of ischemic rat hearts. The purpose of this study was to analyze the mechanism(s) of hypoxic/ischemic induction of Wt1. We show here that Wt1 mRNA and protein is up-regulated in the heart and kidneys of rats exposed to normobaric hypoxia (8% O2). Ectopic Wt1 immunoreactivity was detected in renal tubules of hypoxic rats, which also expressed the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 and contained significantly fewer TUNEL-positive cells than in normoxic kidneys. Wt1 expression was enhanced in the osteosarcoma line U-2OS and in Reh lymphoblast cells that were grown either at 1% O2 or in the presence of CoCl2 and desferrioxamine, respectively. The promoter of the Wt1 gene was capable of mediating expression of a luciferase reporter in response to hypoxia. We identified a hypoxia-responsive element in the Wt1 sequence that bound to hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) and was required for activation of the Wt1 promoter by CoCl2 and HIF-1. These findings demonstrate that Wt1 expression can be stimulated by hypoxia, which involves activation of the Wt1 promoter by HIF-1."
https://openalex.org/W2131173272,"Smooth muscle cell (SMC) rarefaction is involved in the development of several vascular pathologies. We suggest that the plasminogen activation system is a potential extracellular signal that can induce pericellular proteolysis and apoptosis of vascular SMCs. Using primary cultures of arterial SMCs, we show that plasmin generated from plasminogen on the cell surface induces cell retraction and fibronectin fragmentation, leading to detachment and morphological/biochemical changes characteristic of apoptosis (also called anoikis). The generation of cell-bound plasmin mediated by tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), constitutively expressed by VSMCs, requires binding of plasminogen to the cell surface and is inhibited by epsilon-aminocaproic acid (IC50=0.9+/-0.2 mM), a competitor of plasminogen binding to membrane glycoproteins. Conversely, addition of alpha2-antiplasmin, which blocks free plasmin in the cell supernatant, could not fully prevent anoikis. Finally, an MMP inhibitor failed to prevent VSMC anoikis, arguing for a direct involvement of plasmin in this phenomenon. Indeed, similar changes are induced by plasmin directly added to VSMCs or to arterial rings, ex-vivo. We show for the first time that pathological anoikis can be triggered by a process that requires functional assembly of the plasminogen activation system on the surface of VSMCs."
https://openalex.org/W2070809148,"G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) is a key modulator of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR). Altered expression of GRK2 has been described to occur during pathological conditions characterized by impaired GPCR signaling. We have reported recently that GRK2 is rapidly degraded by the proteasome pathway and that β-arrestin function and Src-mediated phosphorylation are involved in targeting GRK2 for proteolysis. In this report, we show that phosphorylation of GRK2 by MAPK also triggers GRK2 turnover by the proteasome pathway. Modulation of MAPK activation alters the degradation of transfected or endogenous GRK2, and a GRK2 mutant that mimics phosphorylation by MAPK shows an enhanced degradation rate, thus indicating a direct effect of MAPK on GRK2 turnover. Interestingly, MAPK-mediated modulation of wild-type GRK2 stability requires β-arrestin function and is facilitated by previous phosphorylation of GRK2 on tyrosine residues by c-Src. Consistent with an important physiological role, interfering with this GRK2 degradation process results in altered GPCR responsiveness. Our data suggest that both c-Src and MAPK-mediated phosphorylation would contribute to modulate GRK2 degradation, and put forward the existence of new feedback mechanisms connecting MAPK cascades and GPCR signaling.

Biol. 2002; 3: 639-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (2125) Google Scholar). Agonist-occupied receptors promote the activation and dissociation of heterotrimeric G proteins into α and βγ subunits, both of which regulate a wide variety of effector systems. In addition, agonist stimulation also leads to the deactivation of GPCR signaling (desensitization) by triggering receptor phosphorylation by specific G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) and binding of the cytosolic proteins β-arrestins to the phosphorylated receptor (3Carman C.V.

Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). GRK2 is a ubiquitous member of the GRK family, which has been shown to modulate a variety of GPCRs (5Aragay A.M. Ruiz-Gomez A. Penela P. Sarnago S. Elorza A. Jimenez-Sainz M.C. Mayor Jr., F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 6Lombardi M.S. Kavelaars A. Heijnen C.J. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 22: 141-163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The same regulatory molecules that contribute to receptor uncoupling from G proteins also regulate GPCR endocytosis, intracellular trafficking, and resensitization and participate in the modulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades by GPCR (7Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, β-arrestins mediate the recruitment of clathrin and β2-adaptin to allow for receptor internalization and also act as scaffold molecules by bridging receptors with signaling proteins such as c-Src, thus facilitating the activation of the ERK/MAPK cascade by GPCR (8Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J.

In addition, the isoforms of β-arrestins can directly interact with components of two different MAPK cascades bringing these molecules into close proximity with the receptor complex (10Luttrell L.M. Roudabush F.L. Choy E.W. Miller W.E. Field M.E. Pierce K.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2449-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar, 11McDonald P.H. Chow C.W.

On the other hand, GRK2 has been shown to interact with the ARF modulator GIT, with phosphatidylinositol 3′-OH kinase γ, and the G protein αq subunit (12Pao, C. S., and Benovic, J. L. (2002) Science's STKE http://www.stke.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2002/153/pe42, and references thereinGoogle Scholar) and to phosphorylate non-receptor substrates such as tubulin, synucleins, or phosducin (13Ruiz-Gomez A.

Chem. 2000; 275: 29724-29730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), thus also extending the cellular functions of GRK2 beyond GPCR desensitization. The key role that GRKs and β-arrestins play in GPCR signaling and modulation suggests that the overall activity of GPCRs would be strongly dependent on the cellular complement and functionality of these proteins. Consistent with this idea, the altered expression of GRK2 described in several pathological conditions such as hypertension (14Gros R. Benovic J.L. Tan C.M. Feldman R.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2087-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), congestive heart failure (15Ungerer M. Bohm M. Elce J.S. Erdmann E. Lohse M.J. Circulation. 1993; 87: 454-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar), or rheumatoid arthritis (6Lombardi M.S. Kavelaars A. Heijnen C.J. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 22: 141-163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has been correlated with impaired GPCR signaling in these situations. GRK2 activity and subcellular distribution are tightly regulated by interactions with Gβγ subunits, lipids, agonist-activated receptors, anchoring proteins and calmodulin, or phosphorylation by other kinases (reviewed in Refs. 16Penn R.B. Pronin A.N. Benovic J.L. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000; 10: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 17Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Mol.

On the other hand, the mechanisms that govern GRK2 cellular levels and that may explain its alterations in physiological and pathological conditions have begun to be addressed recently. In this regard, we have reported recently (19Penela P. Ruiz-Gomez A. Castano J.G. Mayor Jr., F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35238-35244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) that GRK2 is degraded by the proteasome pathway and that kinase turnover was enhanced upon GPCR stimulation. Moreover, we have shown that β-arrestin function and c-Src activity are involved in GRK2 proteolysis. Agonist-dependent binding of β-arrestin to GPCRs allows for the recruitment of c-Src, leading to phosphorylation of GRK2 on tyrosine residues and its targeting for degradation (20Penela P. Elorza A. Sarnago S. Mayor Jr., F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5129-5138Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, the occurrence of additional pathways that may control GRK2 stability was also suggested by some of our data (20Penela P. Elorza A. Sarnago S. Mayor Jr., F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5129-5138Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We and others (21Elorza A. Sarnago S. Mayor Jr., F. Mol.

In this report, we show that MAPK-mediated GRK2 phosphorylation triggers GRK2 degradation in a process that appears to be facilitated when GRK2 is previously tyrosine-phosphorylated. Our data indicate that both c-Src and MAPK pathways would contribute to modulate GRK2 protein stability by promoting proteasome-dependent GRK2 degradation, and put forward new functional regulatory relationships between MAPK cascades and GPCR signaling.

Protein A-Sepharose and isoproterenol were purchased from Sigma. [35S]Methionine and [35S]cysteine labeling mixture was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Hemagglutinin epitope constructs of dominant-negative mutant dnERK1 and the constitutively active mutants of Raf (Raf*), PKCζ (PKCζ*), and MEK (MEK*) were kindly provided by Dr. J. Moscat (Centro de Biología Molecular, Madrid, Spain). The cDNA of constitutively active Ras (H-Ras V-12) was obtained from Dr. M. Serrano (Centro Nacional de Biotecnología, Madrid, Spain). The source of other expression plasmids and materials was reported previously (19Penela P. Ruiz-Gomez A. Castano J.G. Mayor Jr., F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35238-35244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 20Penela P. Elorza A. Sarnago S. Mayor Jr., F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5129-5138Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). All other reagents were of the highest grade commercially available. Site-directed Mutagenesis of GRK2—Specific GRK2 mutation at serine 670 to aspartic acid (GRK2-S670D) was performed by using a “bridge” PCR method. Thus, this mutant was generated by sequentially using the external primers upstream (nucleotides 1755–1785) and downstream (nucleotides 2199–2220) of the mutation in combination with the mutant oligonucleotides 5′-CCGCGCGAGCCCGTCGTCGAGCTGAGCAAG-3′ and its pair 5′-GACGGGGTCGCGCGGCTTGTTCTTCATCTT-3′. The amplified product was subcloned into ApaI-XhoI sites in pcDNA3. The GRK2-S670A mutant was generated with the “Quick Change Site-directed mutagenesis kit” (Stratagene) using the following primers 5′-CCGCGCGCGCCCGTCGTGGAGCTGAGCAAG-3′ and its pair 5′-GAGGGGCGCGCGCGGCTTGTTCTTCATCTT-3′. Finally, the double mutants GRK2-Y13F/Y86F/Y92F-S670A and GRK2-Y13F/Y86F/Y92F-S670D were generated by digestion of the fragment containing the specific mutation at serine 670 with XbaI-XhoI and subsequent subcloning in the mutant GRK2-Y13F/Y86F/Y92F engineered previously as described (20Penela P. Elorza A. Sarnago S. Mayor Jr., F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5129-5138Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK-293 and COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Jurkat T cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. Plasmid DNA (5–10 μg) was transiently transfected by using the LipofectAMINE reagent as described (20Penela P. Elorza A. Sarnago S. Mayor Jr., F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5129-5138Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Empty vector was added as needed to keep the total amount of DNA transfected constant. Expression of wild-type and mutant proteins was analyzed by immunoblot with specific antibodies to confirm similar expression levels. Cell Treatment and Metabolic Labeling—Metabolic labeling and pulse-chase experiments were performed as described (20Penela P. Elorza A. Sarnago S. Mayor Jr., F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5129-5138Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In cells expressing β2AR, receptor activation was triggered by 10 μm isoproterenol during chase periods in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 1 mm ascorbic acid. When indicated, receptor activation was blocked with the antagonist betaxolol (10 μm; a gift from Synthelabo Reserche) added 30 min before labeling and maintained during chase periods. In some experiments, cells expressing transfected or endogenous β2ARs were chronically exposed to isoproterenol (10 μm) for 3–5 h, followed by extensive washing and incubation with medium for 30 min, and subsequently challenged with LPA 10 μm for 5 min. The MEK kinase inhibitors PD98059 (50 μm; Calbiochem) or UO126 (10 μm; Biomol) and the c-Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP2 (5 μm, Calbiochem) were added 90 min prior to metabolic labeling or cell lysis. In some experiments, endogenous CXCR4 receptors in Jurkat cells maintained in 1% serum for 18 h were activated with the chemokine SDF-1α (100 nm for 5 min, PeproTech). The proteasome inhibitors MG132 (10 μm; Biomol) and ALLN (50 μm; Sigma) were added 90 min before labeling and maintained during the chase period. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were washed and lysed in RIPA buffer, and cellular extracts were immunoprecipitated with the specific GRK2 polyclonal antibody AbFP1 as reported (20Penela P. Elorza A. Sarnago S. Mayor Jr., F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5129-5138Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were resolved in 10% SDS-PAGE and gels either subjected to fluorography (pulse-chase experiments) or transferred to nitrocellulose membranes to be probed with an anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (PY99-horseradish peroxidase; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and then reprobed after stripping with AbFP1. In some experiments, the presence of GRK2 phosphorylated on serine 670 in the immunoprecipitates was tested by using an specific anti-phosphoserine polyclonal antibody (pS670 anti-GRK2 antibody from BIOSOURCE International). MAPK activation was detected in cellular lysates by using a phospho-p42/p44 MAPK (Thr-202/Tyr-204) polyclonal antibody (1:500; New England Biolabs). The same blots were subsequently reprobed with a p42/p44 MAPK polyclonal antibody (Calbiochem) to normalize MAPK activation to whole MAPK protein levels. Lysate aliquots were taken to assess protein overexpression of the different wild-type and mutant constructs as described (20Penela P. Elorza A. Sarnago S. Mayor Jr., F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5129-5138Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). When indicated, actin expression was determined by using a polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Blots were developed using a chemiluminescent method (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Band density was quantitated by laser densitometric analysis. Based on previous reports (21Elorza A. Sarnago S. Mayor Jr., F. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 778-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 22Pitcher J.A. Tesmer J.J. Freeman J.L. Capel W.D. Stone W.C. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34531-34534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) that showed agonist-mediated association between GRK2 and MAPK as well as GRK2 phosphorylation by the latter kinase, we explored whether modulation of the ERK/MAPK pathway could have any effect on GRK2 degradation. To this end, basal and isoproterenol-stimulated GRK2 turnover was determined by pulse-chase experiments in HEK-293 cells under conditions that would impair MAPK activation. Fig. 1 shows that the enhanced GRK2 degradation induced by agonist was strongly inhibited in the presence of the MEK inhibitor UO126 or upon co-transfection of a dominant-negative ERK1 construct. These data indicated that MAPK activation is involved in agonist-induced GRK2 proteolysis. Interestingly, inhibition of MAPK activation also leads to a slower GRK2 turnover under unstimulated conditions, suggesting that even in the absence of β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) agonists, different endogenous GPCRs and/or the basal activity of overexpressed β2AR (20Penela P. Elorza A. Sarnago S. Mayor Jr., F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5129-5138Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) are modulating GRK2 stability through a mechanism also involving MAPK stimulation. Consistent with a role for basal β2AR activity in GRK2 turnover, the degradation of GRK2 in cells co-expressing β2AR was clearly delayed upon treatment with the antagonist betaxolol (93 ± 4.5% of GRK2 remaining after 1 h of chase with betaxolol versus 51 ± 10% without, data not shown). To explore further the involvement of MAPK in GRK2 degradation, we examined whether the expression of constitutively active upstream activators of the MAPK cascade would affect GRK2 turnover. HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected with GRK2 and a mutant construct of Raf (Raf*) lacking an NH2-terminal regulatory domain (23Heidecker G. Huleihel M. Cleveland J.L. Kolch W. Beck T.W. Lloyd P. Pawson T. Rapp U.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2503-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), thus promoting a robust MAPK activation without altering MAPK protein levels (data not shown). The sole expression of this mutant notably increases GRK2 degradation as assessed by pulse-chase experiments (31.6 ± 3.8% of kinase remaining after 1 h compared with 51 ± 10% in control conditions) (Fig. 2A). Moreover, the expression of an active PKCζ mutant (PKCζ*) that stimulates MAPK activity in a Raf-dependent manner (24Schonwasser D.C. Marais R.M. Marshall C.J. Parker P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 790-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar) also enhances the GRK2 degradation rate (32.5 ± 0.7% of kinase remaining after 1 h of chase) (Fig. 2B). Similar patterns of GRK2 decay were also detected by expressing a constitutively active Ras mutant (data not shown). The augmented component of GRK2 proteolysis promoted by Raf* in HEK-293 cells was completely abolished by co-expression of a dominant-negative ERK1 mutant (Fig. 2C), thereby confirming that the effect observed was mediated through MAPK. Overall, these results pointed to a role for MAPK stimulation in GRK2 turnover. In order to validate the potential biological significance of this regulatory mechanism, we analyzed the role of MAPK activity in the degradation of endogenous GRK2 in Jurkat T cells. We have reported previously (20Penela P. Elorza A. Sarnago S. Mayor Jr., F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5129-5138Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) that GRK2 was rapidly degraded by the proteasome pathway in these cells and that this process was enhanced by activation of the endogenous chemokine receptor CXCR4 and diminished by tyrosine kinase inhibitors. As shown in Fig. 3A, the presence of the MEK inhibitor PD098059, which strongly reduces MAPK activation (not shown), markedly impairs endogenous GRK2 degradation as assessed by pulse-chase experiments. Consistently, steady-state GRK2 levels detected by immunoblot analysis are increased in Jurkat cells in these conditions (Fig. 3B). Such increase is specific, because the amount of other cellular proteins remains unaltered (Fig. 3B, lower panel). The effect of MAPK on GRK2 degradation could be a consequence of the direct phosphorylation of GRK2 by MAPK or an indirect effect caused by MAPK-mediated phosphorylation of other proteins. In this regard, it has been reported previously that GRK2 is phosphorylated in vivo at the MAPK consensus phosphorylation site Ser-670 (22Pitcher J.A. Tesmer J.J. Freeman J.L. Capel W.D. Stone W.C. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34531-34534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). To address the potential role of direct MAPK phosphorylation of GRK2 on its degradation, we generated mutants at Ser-670 to both mimic MAPK phosphorylation (S670D) or to prevent it (S670A). As shown in Fig. 4, the turnover of the S670D mutant transiently expressed in HEK-293 cells was clearly increased as compared with wild-type GRK2, and its degradation rate was very similar to that observed for GRK2 upon receptor stimulation (19Penela P. Ruiz-Gomez A. Castano J.G. Mayor Jr., F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35238-35244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4) or in the presence of upstream activators of the MAPK pathway (30.5 ± 5.7% of GRK2-S670D protein remaining after 1 h of chase versus 32.5 ± 0.7% of wild-type protein in the presence of Raf*). Proteolysis of GRK2-S670D was blocked by specific inhibitors of the proteasome pathway (not shown) which also prevent degradation of wild-type GRK2 upon GPCR activation (19Penela P. Ruiz-Gomez A. Castano J.G. Mayor Jr., F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35238-35244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These data are consistent with the notion that receptor occupancy leads to MAPK activation and that direct phosphorylation of GRK2 by MAPK triggers its degradation. Surprisingly, basal degradation of the GRK2-S670A mutant was not significantly retarded when compared with that of wild-type GRK2 (Fig. 4) and takes place by the proteasome pathway, because specific inhibitors efficiently blocked proteolysis (not shown). However, the marked increase in wild-type GRK2 degradation that takes place in the presence of β-adrenergic agonists is not observed with the GRK2-S670A mutant (Fig. 4). These results suggested that GRK2 phosphorylation by MAPK plays a role in accelerating GRK2 degradation, although such covalent modification is not strictly required for proteasomal targeting of the kinase, pointing to the occurrence of alternative and independent pathways leading to GRK2 degradation. We next analyzed in more detail the mechanisms underlying GRK2-S670A turnover. GPCR can sequentially activate c-Src and MAPK, and GRK2 can be phosphorylated by both kinases in an agonist-dependent way. Since we have recently shown (20Penela P. Elorza A. Sarnago S. Mayor Jr., F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5129-5138Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) that c-Src-mediated phosphorylation is involved in GRK2 proteolysis, we explored the potential role of tyrosine phosphorylation on GRK2-S670A degradation. Thus, tyrosine residues critical for c-Src phosphorylation (20Penela P. Elorza A. Sarnago S. Mayor Jr., F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5129-5138Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) were mutated to phenylalanine in the GRK2-S670A construct. Interestingly, the turnover of this combined mutant was severely impaired as compared with GRK2-S670A or wild-type GRK2 (81.6 ± 5.5% of protein remaining after 1 h of chase) (Fig. 5A) and is more similar to the pattern described for the Y13F/Y86F/Y92F mutant (84 ± 6% of labeled protein remaining at 1 h of chase). These data indicate that when the potential modulation of GRK2 degradation by MAPK-phosphorylation is abolished, the proteolysis takes place through a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent mechanism, suggesting the involvement of different regulatory processes in GRK2 degradation. Interestingly, mutation of the residues critical for c-Src phosphorylation in the S670D mutant (GRK2-Y13F/Y86F/Y92F-S670D) has no effect on its turnover (Fig. 5B). Moreover, co-transfection with a catalytically inactive mutant of the kinase domain of c-Src (SH1-K D), which does block wild-type GRK2 degradation (20Penela P. Elorza A. Sarnago S. Mayor Jr., F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5129-5138Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), does not alter the rate of degradation of the GRK2-S670D mutant (Fig. 5B). These results would suggest that once GRK2 is phosphorylated by MAPK, its degradation could take place independently of Src activity. Overall, these data suggest that c-Src and MAPK-mediated phosphorylation target GRK2 to the proteasome pathway independently. Once GRK2 is phosphorylated by MAPK, it proceeds for degradation, and tyrosine phosphorylation is dispensable. If GRK2 cannot be phosphorylated by MAPK, proteolysis takes place through a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent pathway. In fact, both wild-type GRK2 and S670A mutant are efficiently tyrosine-phosphorylated upon β2AR stimulation (data not shown). However, some kind of functional relationship appears to occur between these two turnover mechanisms. Fig. 5C shows that the expression of constitutively active Raf does not increase the degradation rate of the Y13F/Y86F/Y92F GRK2 mutant nor does the presence of the MEK inhibitor PD98059 further retard the GRK2 Y13F/Y86F/Y92F turnover. These data suggest that, for wild-type GRK2, MAPK phosphorylation might be preferentially modulating the stability of the fraction of the GRK2 cellular pool previously phosphorylated on tyrosine residues. Experiments of stimulation of endogenous CXCR4 receptors in Jurkat cells are consistent with this sequential model. Activation of CXCR4 receptors leads to both Src and MAPK stimulation, although activation of the latter is not dependent on tyrosine kinase activity (data not shown). We observed that CXCR4 stimulation promotes the rapid phosphorylation of endogenous GRK2 on serine 670, as assessed with a specific antibody raised against this phosphorylated epitope (Fig. 5D). Interestingly, the phosphorylation of this MAPK site is not observed in the presence of the c-Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP2, although MAPK activation is not abrogated under these conditions. It is interesting to note that a given cellular context is needed for efficient phosphorylation-mediated regulation of GRK2 stability by MAPK. In this regard, we have reported previously (19Penela P. Ruiz-Gomez A. Castano J.G. Mayor Jr., F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35238-35244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) that the kinase-dead GRK2-K220R is barely degraded when expressed in cells. This is due to its inability to promote the recruitment of β-arrestin and associated molecules such as c-Src to the vicinity of the receptor, because β-arrestin overexpression can “rescue” GRK2-K220R turnover (20Penela P. Elorza A. Sarnago S. Mayor Jr., F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5129-5138Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Interestingly, overexpression of Raf* does not promote GRK2-K220R proteolysis (Fig. 6A), supporting the hypothesis that additional factors are required for MAPK-induced GRK2 turnover. Therefore, we explored whether co-transfection of β-arrestin1 with GRK2-K220R and Raf* had any effect on the degradation of this mutant. The presence of Raf* causes a clear additional increase in the turnover of GRK2-K220R promoted by β-arrestin overexpression (Fig. 6A, lower panel). In other experiments, HEK-293 cells were co-transfected with Raf* and wild-type GRK2 in the presence of different β-arrestin1 mutants (Fig. 6B). Expression of wild-type β-arrestin1 had no effect on the enhanced GRK2 degradation promoted by Raf*, indicating that endogenous β-arrestin levels in these cells are sufficient to support GRK2 degradation as demonstrated previously (20Penela P. Elorza A. Sarnago S. Mayor Jr., F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5129-5138Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). On the contrary, expression of β-arrestin-S412D (which is unable to recruit c-Src, Ref. 18Penela P. Ribas C. Mayor Jr., F Cell. Signal. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) blocked the degradation induced by Raf*, whereas β-arrestin-S412A (which binds efficiently to Src) has the same effect as wild-type β-arrestin. Overall, our results demonstrate that MAPK-mediated control of GRK2 turnover normally requires phosphorylation of GRK2 on tyrosine residues by c-Src and the involvement of β-arrestin as a protein adaptor. This is in agreement with the ability of β-arrestin to recruit c-Src (18Penela P. Ribas C. Mayor Jr., F Cell. Signal. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) and to assemble signaling complexes involving Raf and Erk (10Luttrell L.M. Roudabush F.L. Choy E.W. Miller W.E. Field M.E. Pierce K.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2449-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar), and possibly additional proteins needed to promote GRK2 degradation (see “Discussion”). The complex mechanisms of control of GRK2 stability suggest that such tight modulation could have a role in the regulation of GPCR signaling. Therefore, we explored whether modifications in GRK2 levels and turnover rate may alter subsequent cellular responses to GPCR agonists. In a first set of experiments, we found that chronic agonist challenge of endogenous βAR in HEK-293 cells clearly down-regulates endogenous GRK2 levels (0.56 ± 0.1 of cellular GRK2 complement after isoproterenol treatment as compared with control cells incubated with vehicle, Fig. 7A). Interestingly, MAPK activation in response to LPA was clearly enhanced in those cells with lower GRK2 le"

The mechanism of KAI1/CD82-mediated suppression of cancer metastasis remains to be established. In this study, we found that migration of the metastatic prostate cancer cell line Du145 was substantially inhibited when KAI1/CD82 was expressed. The expression of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Lyn, a Src family tyrosine kinase and substrate of FAK, was up-regulated at both RNA and protein levels upon KAI1/CD82 expression. The activation of FAK and Lyn, however, remained unchanged in Du145-KAI1/CD82 cells. As a downstream target of FAK-Lyn signaling, the p130CAS (Crk-associated substrate) protein was decreased upon the expression of KAI1/CD82. Consequently, less p130CAS-CrkII complex, which functions as a “molecular switch” in cell motility, was formed in Du145-KAI1/CD82 cells. To confirm that the p130CAS-CrkII complex is indeed important for the motility inhibition by KAI1/CD82, overexpression of p130CAS in Du145-KAI1/CD82 cells increased the formation of p130CAS-CrkII complex and largely reversed the KAI1/CD82-mediated inhibition of cell motility. Taken together, our studies indicate the following: 1) signaling of FAK-Lyn-p130CAS-CrkII pathway is altered in KAI1/CD82-expressing cells, and 2) p130CAS-CrkII coupling is required for KAI1/CD82-mediated suppression of cell motility.

Understanding the molecular determinants that govern cancer invasiveness and metastasis is fundamentally important for successfully diagnosing and treating metastatic cancers. KAI1/CD82 was rediscovered as a prostate cancer metastasis suppressor through genetic screening (1Dong J.-T. Lamb P.W. Rinker-Schaeffer C.W. Vukanovic J. Ichikawa T. Issacs J.T. Barrett J.C. Science. 1995; 268: 884-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). Reduced KAI1/CD82 expression is associated with malignant progression of human prostate cancer (2White A. Lamb P.W. Barrett J.C. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3143-3149Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Advanced prostate tumors show decreased KAI1/CD82 expression compared with normal prostate and benign prostatic hyperplasia, and the down-regulation usually does not involve mutation or allelic loss of KAI1/CD82 (3Dong J.-T.

Both Gleason grades and clinical stages of prostate cancers have an inverse correlation with the percentage of KAI1/CD82-positive cells (4Udea T. Ichikawa T. Tamura J. Mikata A. Akakura K. Akimoto S.

However, the mechanism by which KAI1/CD82 suppresses cancer invasiveness or metastasis remains unclear.KAI1/CD82 protein belongs to the tetraspanin or transmembrane 4 superfamily (TM4SF) 1The abbreviations used are: TM4SF, transmembrane 4 superfamily; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CAS, Crk-associated substrate; ECM, extracellular matrix; EGF, epidermal growth factor; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; FN, fibronectin; LN, laminin; mAb, monoclonal antibody; MFI, mean fluorescence intensity; pAb, polyclonal antibody; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; PI3-K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; pTyr, phosphorylated tyrosine; MAP, mitogenactivated protein; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; RIPA, radioimmune precipitation assay buffer; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate.1The abbreviations used are: TM4SF, transmembrane 4 superfamily; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CAS, Crk-associated substrate; ECM, extracellular matrix; EGF, epidermal growth factor; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; FN, fibronectin; LN, laminin; mAb, monoclonal antibody; MFI, mean fluorescence intensity; pAb, polyclonal antibody; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; PI3-K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; pTyr, phosphorylated tyrosine; MAP, mitogenactivated protein; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; RIPA, radioimmune precipitation assay buffer; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate. and contains four presumed transmembrane domains, a short N- and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (11 and 12 amino acids), a small intracellular loop (4 amino acids), and two extracellular loops (23 and 114 amino acids) (19Hemler M.E.

TM4SF proteins participate in many biological events ranging from cellular fusion, cell adhesion, and cell migration to cell proliferation, synapse formation, and neurite outgrowth (19Hemler M.E. J.

Morimoto C. Cell. Immunol. 1993; 152: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Like other TM4SF proteins, KAI1/CD82 has been implicated in regulating cell motility (19Hemler M.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1103-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 20Berditchevski F. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4143-4151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Kopczynski C.C. Davis G.W.

Also, the KAI1/CD82 protein in T cells behaves as a costimulatory molecule during T cell activation (23Lebel-Binay S. Lagaudriere-Gesbert C. Fradelizi D. Conjeaud H. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 101-110PubMed Google Scholar, 24Nojima Y. Hirose T. Tachibana K. Tanaka T. Shi L. Doshen J. Freeman G.J. Schlossman S.F. Morimoto C. Cell. Immunol. 1993; 152: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), indicating that KAI1/CD82 plays a role in signal transduction. Recent studies have revealed that KAI1/CD82 attenuates epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling by accelerating EGF receptor endocytosis through an interaction with the EGF receptor (25Odintsova E. Sugiura T. Berditchevski F. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1009-1012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), thereby confirming that KAI1/CD82 is functionally connected to the intracellular signaling machinery. Clustering KAI1/CD82 with its monoclonal antibody (mAb) induces cytoskeletal rearrangement and elongated cellular extension (26Lagaudriere-Gesbert C. Lebel-Binay S. Hubeau C. Fradelizi D. Conjeaud H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 4332-4344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Delaguillaumie A. Lagaudriere-Gesbert C. Popoff M.R. Conjeaud H. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 433-443Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This signaling event is dependent on the activities of protein kinase A, protein kinase C (PKC), and Rho small GTPases but independent of Src kinase activity (26Lagaudriere-Gesbert C. Lebel-Binay S. Hubeau C. Fradelizi D. Conjeaud H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 4332-4344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Delaguillaumie A. Lagaudriere-Gesbert C. Popoff M.R. Conjeaud H. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 433-443Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These studies suggest that KAI1/CD82 may directly initiate signaling events. Thus, how the KAI1/CD82-initiated or -mediated signaling intercepts the signaling required for cancer cell motility and invasiveness becomes an essential question.Recently, progress has been made in understanding the signaling pathways that control cell migration. For example, the signaling pathway that involves Shc, MEK, and MAP kinase ERKs determines random cell migration through regulating actin-myosin assembly and cell contraction (28Cheresh D.A. Leng J. Klemke R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1107-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 29Gu J.M. Tamura R. Pankov E.H. Danen J. Takino T. Matsumoto K. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 389-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Another pathway that involves FAK, Src, p130CAS, and CrkII determines directional persistence of cell migration by regulating actin reorganization, focal contacts, and membrane ruffling (28Cheresh D.A. Leng J. Klemke R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1107-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 29Gu J.M. Tamura R. Pankov E.H. Danen J. Takino T. Matsumoto K. Yamada K.M. J.

Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The small GTPases of the Rho family regulate multiple aspects of cell motility such as generation of lamellipodia, assembly of focal adhesion, retraction of tail, and formation of stress fiber by either directly acting on cytoskeleton reorganization or by cross-talking with the above signaling pathways (32Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5185) Google Scholar, 33Keely P. Parise L. Juliano R. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 101-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). For example, Rac GTPase activity is required to propagate the signals generated from the FAK-Src-p130CAS-CrkII pathway to the actin cytoskeleton (28Cheresh D.A. Leng J. Klemke R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1107-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K)-Akt/PKB pathway also plays an important role in the events of cell movement, such as cellular polarization during chemotaxis, by modulating FAK and Rho signaling pathways (34Chung C.Y. Funamoto S. Firtel R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 557-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 35Reiske H.R. Kao S.C. Cary L.A. Guan J.L. Lai J.F. Chen H.C. J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 24565-24574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar).In the FAK-Src-p130CAS-CrkII pathway, the association of p130CAS with CrkII induces cell migration and enhances invasiveness of carcinoma cells (30Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). The p130CAS-CrkII coupling depends on the interaction of the CrkII SH2 domain with phosphotyrosine residues present in the substrate domain of p130CAS (37O'Neill G.M. Fashena S.J. Golemis E.A. Trend. Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 111-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that p130CAS-CrkII coupling occurs through a tightly regulated balance of tyrosine phosphorylation of p130CAS by Src and/or FAK and dephosphorylation by phosphatases such as PTP-PEST (37O'Neill G.M. Fashena S.J. Golemis E.A. Trend. Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 111-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In a proposed model, p130CAS-CrkII coupling induces the CrkII SH2 domain to recruit DOCK180 to the cell membrane and to activate Rac1, thus causing the induction of membrane ruffling (28Cheresh D.A. Leng J. Klemke R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1107-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 30Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Therefore, the formation of p130CAS-CrkII complex provides a molecular switch leading to cell migration and invasion (30Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar).This study sought to identify the signaling pathway responsible for the KAI1/CD82-mediated suppression of cancer cell movement. Using Du145 metastatic prostate cancer cells as the experimental model, we demonstrated that the FAK-Src-p130CAS-CrkII pathway is crucial for the KAI1/CD82-mediated suppression of cell motility of Du145 cells. The signaling derived from KAI1/CD82 alters the levels of FAK and Lyn and attenuates the p130CAS-CrkII coupling. This finding illustrates an important signaling mechanism by which KAI1/CD82 suppresses cell motility.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies and Extracellular Matrix Proteins—The mAbs used in this study were human integrin α3 subunit mAb X8 (38Weitzman J.B. Pasqualini R. Takada Y. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8651-8657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), human integrin α5 subunit mAb PUJ-2 (39Pujades C. Teixido J. Bazzoni G. Hemler M.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 899-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and human CD82 mAb M104 (40Fukudome K. Furuse M. Imai T. Nishimura M. Takagi S. Hinuma Y. Yoshie O. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1394-1401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and 4F9 (24Nojima Y. Hirose T. Tachibana K. Tanaka T. Shi L. Doshen J. Freeman G.J. Schlossman S.F. Morimoto C. Cell. Immunol. 1993; 152: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A mouse IgG2 was used as a negative control antibody (Sigma). The mAb against FAK, p130CAS, CrkII, paxillin, Yes, RACK1, or PKCα was purchased from BD Transduction Laboratory (Lexington, KY), and the mAb against vinculin or tubulin β was from Sigma. The phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10 was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). The mAb against Src phosphotyrosine 416 was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA); this mAb cross-reacts with the corresponding phosphotyrosine residues of other Src family members such as Lyn and Yes. The mAb to phosphotyrosine 397 of FAK and the mAb to phosphotyrosine 577 of FAK were obtained from BIOSOURCE International (Camarillo, CA). The polyclonal antibody (pAb) against FAK, Lyn, Fyn, and c-Src were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma).The extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins used in this study were human plasma fibronectin (FN) (Invitrogen), mouse laminin (LN)-1 (Invitrogen), and rat LN-5 (Drs. Chris Stipp and Martin Hemler of the Dana Farber Cancer Institute).Cell Culture and Transfectants—Prostate cancer cell line Du145 was obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The full-length KAI1/CD82 cDNA was obtained from Dr. Christopher Class (German Cancer Research Center) and subcloned into a eukaryotic expression vector pCDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). Du145 cells were transfected with pCDNA3.1-KAI1/CD82 plasmid DNA using Superfectin (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and selected with G418 (Invitrogen) at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. Hundreds of G418-resistant clones were pooled, and the KAI1/CD82-positive ones were collected by flow cytometric cell sorting. The pooled Mock or KAI1/CD82-positive clones were the stable transfectants used in the following experiments. In some experiments, plasmid DNA of wild-type p130CAS (from Dr. R. Klemke, Scripps Research Institute) was transiently transfected into Du145-KAI1/CD82 and Du145-Mock cells using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) by following the manufacturer's protocol.Flow Cytometry—Du145 transfectant cells were incubated with negative control mAb, integrin mAbs, or specific TM4SF mAbs and then stained with FITC-conjugated goat-anti-mouse IgG as previously described (41Zhang X.A. Bontrager A.L. Bazzoni G. Kraeft S.-K. Stipp C.S. Chen L.B. Hemler M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 351-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The stained cells were analyzed using a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, Mountain View, CA). Fluorescence with negative control mAb was subtracted to give specific mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) units.Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Immunoprecipitations were carried out basically as previously described (42Zhang X.A. Bontrager A.L. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25005-25013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Briefly, an identical number of Du145 transfectant cells were lysed using RIPA lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.2% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm HEPES, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm sodium vanadate, and 2 mm sodium fluoride at 4 °C for 1 h. Lysates were precleared with a combination of protein A-Sepharose and protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) two times at 4 °C after removing the insoluble material by 14,000 × g centrifugation. Then the mAb-preabsorbed protein A-Sepharose and protein G-Sepharose beads were incubated with cell lysate overnight at 4 °C. The precipitates were washed with the lysis buffer three times, dissolved in Laemmli sample buffer, heated at 95 °C for 5 min, separated by SDS-PAGE, and then subjected to immunoblotting.Immunoblotting was also performed as previously described (42Zhang X.A. Bontrager A.L. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25005-25013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). For Western blotting of total cellular proteins, an equivalent number of cells were lysed using RIPA buffer, the protein concentrations of lysates were normalized, and then the lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE. After being transferred electrically, nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH) were sequentially blotted with primary antibody and horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-mouse or -rabbit IgG (Sigma) and then detected with chemiluminesence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). In some cases, immunoblots were stripped and reblotted with mAbs or pAbs according to the manufacturer's instruction.Cell Migration Assay—The cell motility assays were performed as described (43Zhang X.A. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) using modified Boyden chambers with Transwell membrane filter inserts in a 24-well tissue culture plate (Corning Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA). The Transwell filters were 6.5-mm in diameter, 8-μm pore size, 10-μm thick polycarbonate membrane. FN (10 μg/ml) or LN-5 (2 μg/ml) was coated on the lower surface of the Transwell inserts at 4 °C overnight and then blocked with 0.1% heat-inactivated bovine serum albumin (BSA) at 37 °C for 45 min before adding cells. Cells were serum-starved overnight and resuspended in serum-free DMEM medium containing 0.1% heat-inactivated BSA and then added to each insert or the top well. For haptotatic migration assays, the migration medium containing serum-free DMEM and 0.1% heat-inactivated BSA was added to the bottom wells of the chambers. For chemohaptotactic migration assays, the migration buffers put in the bottom wells contained either 1% fetal calf serum, EGF (100 ng/ml), or platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB (40 ng/ml) in addition to plain DMEM and 0.1% heat-inactivated BSA. After overnight incubation at 37 °C, the cells that had not migrated through the filter were removed with cotton swabs from the upper face of the filter, and cells that had migrated to the lower surface of the filters were fixed and stained with Diff-Quick (Baxter Healthcare Corp., McGraw Park, IL). The number of cells per field was counted under a light microscope at magnification ×40.Gene Expression Profile Analysis—Total RNA from Du145-Mock and Du145-CD82 cells was prepared using TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen) by following the manufacturer's instruction. RNA integrity was assessed by using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA). Poly(A)+-RNA was purified from total RNA with Oligotex latex beads (Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized using a T-7 linked oligo(dT) primer, and cRNA was then synthesized with biotinylated UTP and CTP. The labeled cRNA was then fragmented and hybridized onto Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 probe microarray set (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA), which represents over 33,000 known human genes and ESTs, by following Affymetrix protocols (44Lockhart D.J. Dong H. Byrne M.C. Follettie M.T. Gallo M.V. Chee M.S. Mittmann M. Wang C. Kobayashi M. Horton H. Brown E.L. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1675-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (2795) Google Scholar, 45Wodicka L. Dong H. Mittmann M. Ho M.H. Lockhart D.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 1359-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Arrays were scanned using a laser confocal scanner (Agilent).Raw data were analyzed using Affymetrix GeneChip software v.4.0 (for explanation of quantitative analysis, see 44Lockhart D.J. Dong H. Byrne M.C. Follettie M.T. Gallo M.V. Chee M.S. Mittmann M. Wang C. Kobayashi M. Horton H. Brown E.L. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1675-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (2795) Google Scholar). The probe set intensity (average intensity difference) was proportional to the abundance of the specific mRNA it represented and was calculated by comparing hybridization signal of the perfect match oligonucleotide to that of the mismatch oligonucleotide and averaged over a set of 20 specific oligonucleotide pairs for each gene. Total signal intensity of different probe arrays was scaled to the same value before comparison. Fold change was calculated using the Affymetrix GeneChip software by pairwise comparison of corresponding probe pairs from KAI1/CD82 and Mock probe arrays. To account for high noise at low signal intensities, genes for which the average difference values were below 100 throughout the experiment (in both KAI1/CD82 and Mock) were eliminated from the analysis. To avoid saturation effects at high signal intensities, genes with average differences larger than 10,000 throughout the experiment were also eliminated.RESULTSKAI1/CD82 Inhibits the Migration of Du145 Metastatic Prostate Carcinoma Cells—Consistent with previous observations (1Dong J.-T.

Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3143-3149Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), Du145, a metastatic prostate cancer cell line (46Stone K.R. Mickey D.D. Wunderli H. Mickey G.H. Paulson D.F. Int. J. Cancer. 1978; 21: 274-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar), barely expressed any KAI1/CD82 (Fig. 1). To investigate the effect of KAI1/CD82 expression on cell motility, the stable KAI1/CD82 transfectant of Du145 cell was established by pooling and sorting multiple KAI1/CD82-expressing clones with flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 1, the cell surface expression level of KAI1/CD82 in the Du145-KAI1/CD82 transfectant was much higher than that in the Du145-Mock transfectant. Integrin α3β1, a receptor of laminin 5, and integrin α5β1, a receptor of fibronectin, showed equivalent expression on both transfectants and served as positive controls (Fig. 1). Other TM4SF proteins such as CD81 and CD151 were also equivalently expressed on the cell surfaces of both transfectants, and their levels were not altered by the KAI1/CD82 expression in Du145 cells (data not shown).The Du145 transfectants were then tested for their directional motility on FN in a transwell haptotactic migration assay. As shown in Fig. 2A, the ability of Du145-KAI1/CD82 cells to migrate toward ECM was remarkably reduced compared with that of the Du145-Mock cells. The diminished haptotactic cell migration in Du145-KAI1/CD82 cells was observed on both FN- and LN5-coated substrata (Fig. 2A), indicating that Du145-KAI1/CD82 has general suppressive effects on cell migration mediated by both FN- and LM-binding integrins such as α5β1 and α3β1, respectively. Also, cell migration on LN1, a ligand for α6 integrins, was substantially diminished (data not shown).Fig. 2The KAI1/CD82 expression attenuates the migration of Du145 cells. A, KAI1/CD82 inhibits haptotactic cell migration on fibronectin and laminin. Haptotactic migration of the Du145 transfectants was measured using the transwell inserts coated with FN (20 μg/ml) or LN5 (2 μg/ml). The migration medium in top and bottom wells was DMEM containing 0.1% heat-inactivated BSA and antibiotics. Cells that migrated onto the lower surface were fixed, stained, and photographed. In each individual experiment, cells that migrated through the filters were counted from at least three randomly selected fields. Results were obtained from at least three individual experiments and represented as the cell migration index, which is the number of cells per a high power field. The bar graph represent means ± S.D. p < 0.001 on both FN and on LN5 between the Mock and KAI1/CD82 transfectants. B, KAI1/CD82 inhibits chemohaptotactic cell migration. Chemohaptotactic migration assays were carried out toward chemoattractants on FN (20 μg/ml)-coated filters in the medium of the bottom well. The chemoattractants in the medium of the bottom well were 1% fetal calf serum, EGF (100 ng/ml), or PDGF-BB (40 ng/ml). The results were obtained from three experiments (mean ± S.D.). p < 0.001 toward FCS, EGF, or PDGF between the Mock and KAI1/CD82 transfectants.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The defect in cell migration upon KAI1/CD82"
https://openalex.org/W2145683716,"The effects of estrogen and anti-estrogen are mediated through the estrogen receptors (ER) α and β, which function as ligand-induced transcriptional factors. Recently, one of the phthalate esters, n-butylbenzyl phthalate (BBP), has been shown to induce estrogen receptor-mediated responses. By using the truncated types of ER mutants, we revealed that activation function-1 (AF-1) activity was necessary for the BBP-dependent transactivation function of ERα. AF-1 is also known to be responsible for the partial agonistic activity of tamoxifen. Whereas tamoxifen exhibits an anti-estrogenic effect on proliferation of the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line, BBP showed an estrogenic effect on MCF-7 to stimulate proliferation. In vivo and in vitro binding assays revealed that whereas 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHT) induced binding of ERα to both an AF-1 coactivator complex (p68/p72 and p300) and corepressor complexes (N-CoR/SMRT), BBP selectively enhanced the binding to the AF-1 coactivators. We also showed that the transcriptional activity of OHT-bound ERα was modulated by the ratio between the AF-1 coactivator and corepressor complexes. Expression of a dominant-negative type of N-CoR inhibited the interaction between OHT-bound ERα and N-CoR/SMRT and enhanced the transcriptional activity of OHT-bound ERα. Furthermore, the cell growth of MCF-7 stably expressing the dominant-negative type of N-CoR was enhanced by the addition of OHT. These results indicated that fully activated AF-1 induces the stimulation of breast cancer growth and that the ratio between AF-1 coactivators and corepressors plays a key role to prevent proliferation of tumor by tamoxifen.

We also showed that the transcriptional activity of OHT-bound ERα was modulated by the ratio between the AF-1 coactivator and corepressor complexes. Expression of a dominant-negative type of N-CoR inhibited the interaction between OHT-bound ERα and N-CoR/SMRT and enhanced the transcriptional activity of OHT-bound ERα. Furthermore, the cell growth of MCF-7 stably expressing the dominant-negative type of N-CoR was enhanced by the addition of OHT. These results indicated that fully activated AF-1 induces the stimulation of breast cancer growth and that the ratio between AF-1 coactivators and corepressors plays a key role to prevent proliferation of tumor by tamoxifen.

Estrogen is known to stimulate hormone-dependent tumors such as endometrial cancer and breast cancer (37Pritchard K.I. Cancer (Phila.). 2000; 88: 3065-3072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it was suggested that some endocrine disrupters may also contribute to the development of hormone-dependent cancers (38Jobling S. Reynolds T. White R. Parker M.G. Sumpter J.P. Environ.

Several studies have demonstrated that many endocrine disrupters, such as butylbenzyl phthalate (BBP), a phthalate ester used as a plasticizer, are capable of interacting with estrogen receptors and induce estrogen receptor-mediated responses, suggesting that estrogenic or anti-estrogenic effects elicited by these substances may be receptor-mediated (38Jobling S.

For the endocrine therapy of these cancers, the development of inhibitory ligands for ERs has yielded important therapeutic treatments, including the use of tamoxifen (37Pritchard K.I.

However, most patients undergoing long-term treatment of breast cancer with tamoxifen eventually experience recurrence of tumor growth. One of the reasons for this treatment failure is the acquisition by the tumor of the ability to respond to tamoxifen as a stimulatory rather than inhibitory ligand (50van Leeuwen F.E. Benraadt J.

We reported previously (61Yamamoto Y. Wada O. Suzawa M. Yogiashi Y. Yano T. Kato S. Yanagisawa J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42684-42691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) that ERα(D351Y) exhibited reduced interaction with N-CoR and SMRT in the presence of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHT). These observations raised the possibility that OHT-dependent interaction between ERα and corepressor complexes may be essential for the anti-estrogenic effect of OHT and that abrogation of OHT-dependent binding of corepressors to ERα may convert OHT from antagonist to agonist to stimulate cancer growth. In this paper, we identified BBP as an agonist for AF-1 of ERα. Although BBP exhibited the same properties as tamoxifen in a transient transfection assay, BBP-occupied ERα did not bind to corepressors and enhanced the proliferation of the breast cancer cell line MCF-7. The transcriptional activity of OHT-occupied ERα was modulated by the ratio of the expression levels between AF-1 coactivators and corepressors. Moreover, MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines expressing the dominant-negative type of N-CoR exhibited a growth phenotype in the presence of OHT. These results indicate that activation of AF-1 induces the stimulation of breast cancer growth and that the ratio between AF-1 coactivators and corepressors plays a key role to prevent proliferation of tumor by tamoxifen.

C-terminal fragments of N-CoR and SMRT (including the NR interaction domains ID1 and ID2) were inserted into the pVP16 vector (Clontech) to generate VP-N-CoR, VP-SMRT, and pGEX-2T vector to GST-ID1-2 of N-CoR and SMRT and pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) for FLAG-N-CoR ID1-2. ERα mutation in amino acid replacement D351Y was introduced into full-length ERα and GAL-DEF plasmid by PCR-based point mutagenesis (Stratagene). Transfection, Luciferase Assay, Mammalian Two-hybrid Assay, and Repression Assay—293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Two days before transfection, medium was changed to phenol red-free DMEM containing 5% charcoal-stripped FBS. Transfection was performed with Lipofectin reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For luciferase assays, 250 ng of ERE3-tk-luc plasmid was cotransfected with 25 ng of ER expression vector (HEG0/ERGβ0) or mutants. For mammalian two-hybrid assays, 250 ng of ERE3-tk-luc or 17m5-luc vector was cotransfected with 250 ng of HEG0, GAL-DEF, or GAL-DEF(D351Y) in combination with 250 ng of indicated VP16-conjugated constructs and/or p300, p68, N-CoR, or N-CoR ID1-2 plasmids. For repression analysis, 1 μg of MH100-tk-luc vector was cotransfected with 250 ng of GAL-DEF. As a reference plasmid to normalize for transfection efficiency, either 5 ng of pRL-CMV vector (Promega) or 125 ng of pRSVβGAL vector was cotransfected in all experiments. Six hours after transfection, culture medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 0.2% FBS. At this time, either E2 (10 nm), OHT (100 nm), ICI182,780 (100 nm), ethanolic vehicle, or 5 ng/ml trichostatin A (TSA) was added, and cells were incubated for an additional 24 h. Preparation of cell extracts and luciferase assays were performed following the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). β-Galactosidase activity was measured to control the efficiency for each transfection. Individual transfections, each consisting of triplicate wells, were repeated at least three times. For establishing MCF-7 stable transfectant of N-CoR ID1-2, Lipofectin reagent was used for introduce pcDNA-ID1-2, and transfectants were selected by 500 μg/ml G418 (Sigma), and several clones were isolated. GST Pull-down Assay—For GST pull-down assays, bacterially expressed GST fusion proteins or GST bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) were incubated on ice with [35S]methionine-labeled proteins expressed by in vitro translation using the TnT-coupled transcription-translation system (Promega). After 1 h of incubation, free proteins were removed by washing the beads 5 times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% glycerol and protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Specifically bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by 6% SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, radiolabeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography. Coimmunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—293T cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids, lysed in TNE (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin) buffer, and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) or anti-ERα (Chemicon). Interacting proteins were separated by 6% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto polyvinylidine difluoride membranes (Millipore), and detected with anti-ERα, anti-p300 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-FLAG M2, or anti-V5 tag (Invitrogen), and secondary antibodies were conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. For detecting the expression of ERα and N-CoR ID1-2, isolated clones were lysed in TNE, and each lysate was detected by immunoblotting using anti-ER or anti-FLAG and secondary antibodies. Cell Proliferation Analysis—Two days before assay, MDA-MB-231 (ERα-negative) and MCF-7 (ERα-positive) cells were cultured in a 24-well plate in phenol red-free DMEM supplemented with 0.2% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum. As experimental medium, either E2 (10 nm), OHT (1 μm), BBP (1 μm), or ethanol vehicle was supplemented. Cells were harvested for the indicated times, and the number of viable cells was counted with hemocytometer. S-phase Entry Analysis—For S-phase entry analysis, NIH3T3 cells were cultured in phenol red-free DMEM supplemented with 5% charcoal-stripped FBS and seeded onto glass coverslips at 60–70% confluence. Transfection with 3 μg of wild-type or mutant ERα expression plasmid was performed by using Perfectin Reagent (Gene Therapy Systems) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Incubation medium was changed after 24 h into phenol red-free DMEM supplemented with 0.2% charcoal-stripped FBS. Cells were left in this medium for 24 h and then cultured with 100 μm 5-bromouridine 5′-triphosphate (BrdUrd) in the presence of either E2 (10 nm), BBP (1 μm), or OHT (1 μm) for an additional 24 h. After incubation, the cells were fixed for immunostaining. BBP Binds Ligand-binding Pocket of ERα and Induces the Transcriptional Activity of AF-1—It has been reported that BBP binds to ERα and enhances the transcriptional activity of ERα. To confirm the binding of BBP to ERs, we performed an in vitro competitive ligand binding assay to investigate the abilities of BBP to compete with E2 for binding to ERα and -β. E2 exhibited an IC50 of ∼1.0 nm to both ERs (Fig. 1B), which is within the range of previously reported IC50 values (40Zacharewski T.R. Meek M.D. Clemons J.H. Wu Z.F. Fielden M.R. Matthews J.B.

https://openalex.org/W2031543193,"Measurements of cellular Ca2+-calmodulin concentrations have suggested that competition for limiting calmodulin may couple calmodulin-dependent activities. Here we have directly tested this hypothesis. We have found that in endothelial cells the amount of calmodulin bound to nitric-oxide synthase and the catalytic activity of the enzyme both are increased ∼3-fold upon changes in the phosphorylation status of the enzyme. Quantitative immunoblotting indicates that the synthase can bind up to 25% of the total cellular calmodulin. Consistent with this, simultaneous determinations of the free Ca2+ and Ca2+-calmodulin concentrations in these cells performed using indo-1 and a fluorescent calmodulin biosensor (Kd = 2 nm) indicate that increased binding of calmodulin to the synthase is associated with substantial reductions in the Ca2+-calmodulin concentrations produced and an increase in the [Ca2+]50 for formation of the calmodulin-biosensor complex. The physiological significance of these effects is confirmed by a corresponding 40% reduction in calmodulin-dependent plasma membrane Ca2+ pump activity. An identical reduction in pump activity is produced by expression of a high affinity (Kd = 0.3 nm) calmodulin biosensor, and treatment to increase calmodulin binding to the synthase then has no further effect. This suggests that the observed reduction in pump activity is due specifically to reduced calmodulin availability. Increases in synthase activity thus appear to be coupled to decreases in the activities of other calmodulin targets through reductions in the size of a limiting pool of available calmodulin. This exemplifies what is likely to be a ubiquitous mechanism for coupling among diverse calmodulin-dependent activities.

Neuron. 1999; 22: 645-648Google Scholar). Measurements of the Ca2+-CaM concentrations produced in living cells (8Romoser V.A. Hinkle P.M. Persechini A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13270-13274Google Scholar, 9Persechini A. Cronk B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6827-6830Google Scholar) have suggested that the intracellular pool of CaM is limiting, i.e. the concentration of available CaM in the cell is less than the concentration of CaM-binding sites (9Persechini A. Cronk B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6827-6830Google Scholar, 10Teruel M.N. Chen W. Persechini A. Meyer T. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 86-94Google Scholar). This has led us to propose that competition for a limiting pool of CaM likely constitutes a pervasive mechanism for coupling among CaM-dependent activities (11Persechini A. Stemmer P.M. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2002; 12: 32-37Google Scholar). In this study we have directly tested this hypothesis and have found that in endothelial cells increases in the CaM binding ability of nitricoxide synthase (eNOS) are correlated with significant reductions in the free Ca2+-CaM concentrations produced and in CaM-dependent activity of the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump (PMCA). Cell Culture and Transfection—Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) were purchased from Coriell Institute for Medical Research (Camden, NJ; repository number AG04762A) and cultured in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were used between 6 and 10 passages. Cells were plated onto glass coverslips and grown until subconfluence for transfection. pcDNA3.1 vectors encoding CaM biosensors were then transfected into the cells using Targefect F-1 (Targeting System, Santee, CA). Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation—Subconfluent BAECs were stimulated with 1 μm ionomycin in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2 with or without pretreatment with 50 μm FSK and 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX). After 3 min, cells were lysed, and homogenates were processed as described elsewhere (12Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Dimmeler S. Kemp B.E. Busse R. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: E68-E75Google Scholar). Anti-eNOS antibody and anti-CaM antibodies were obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA); antibodies against phospho-Thr-497 and phospho-Ser-1179 (rabbit polyclonal IgG) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Blotting was performed as per the manufacturer's instructions. Measurement of NO Production—Subconfluent BAECs were washed with normal HEPES-buffered saline (NHBS, composition in mm: 141 NaCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgSO4, 5 KCl, 10 HEPES, and 10 glucose) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min in the presence or absence of 50 μm forskolin and 0.5 mm IBMX with either 100 μm l-NAME or 100 μm l-arginine. This medium was then removed, and cells were stimulated by the addition of 0.5 ml of a buffer containing 1 μm ionomycin, in addition to the above concentrations of l-NAME or l-arginine, and forskolin/IBMX. After 5 min, the supernatant was collected and treated to reduce nitrate to nitrite using a procedure involving catalysis with cadmium metal (Nitralyzer II, World Precision Instruments). Nitrite was then converted to NO and measured using an NO-specific electrode as described by the manufacturer (ISO-NOP MARK II, World Precision Instruments). Simultaneous Measurement of Free Ca2+ and Ca2+-CaM Concentrations—Biosensor ECFP and EYFP fluorescence was collected using 480/40M and 535/30M emission filters, while indo-1 fluorescence was collected using 405/30M and 485/25M filters (Chroma Technology, Brattleboro, VT). Alternating 340 (indo-1) and 435 (biosensor) excitation light was provided by a DeltaRAM rapid-switching monochromator (PTI International) coupled with a custom-made 410/30M-460LP microscope polychroic (Chroma Technology). There is no detectable spillover between indo-1 and biosensor channels in this system. Alternating indo-1 (405/485) and biosensor (480/535) emission ratios were determined at 1-s intervals. Subconfluent BAECs transiently expressing CaM biosensors were incubated with indo-1/AM (6 μm) and the specified pharmacological agents or equal volumes of vehicle control (Me2SO) for 30 min. Free Ca2+ concentration was estimated from indo-1 emission ratios using a 460 nmKd value determined in BAECs by comparison with the response of a CaM-based Ca2+ biosensor (9Persechini A. Cronk B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6827-6830Google Scholar). Free Ca2+-CaM concentrations were determined from biosensor emission ratios as described previously and are “effective” values for free (Ca2+)4-CaM, as they are calculated based on biosensor Kd values for this fully liganded CaM species (9Persechini A. Cronk B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6827-6830Google Scholar). Thermodynamic coupling effects and differences in the mechanisms controlling CaM-binding to different targets make it difficult to precisely define the CaM species in equilibrium with a CaM-biosensor complex under all conditions in the cell, hence we prefer the generic “Ca2+-CaM” designation. Nevertheless, calculated effective values are useful for comparative purposes, and as a means of evaluating, based on its affinity for (Ca2+)4-CaM, whether a given target is likely to compete successfully for CaM in the cell. Competitive Binding Assay for eNOS and BSCaM2—Equimolar BSCaM2 and eNOS in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, 3 mm BAPTA, 0.1 m KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4, were titrated with CaM until the maximal BSCaM2 fluorescence response was obtained. Titration data were fit to a quadratic equation for competitive binding to extract the Kd value for CaM binding to eNOS. For several reasons, we chose to use endothelial cells for our initial investigations of coupling among calmodulin target activities. First, eNOS is a CaM-binding protein of undisputed physiological importance (13Huang P.L. Huang Z. Mashimo H. Bloch K.D. Moskowitz M.A. Bevan J.A. Fishman M.C. Nature. 1995; 377: 239-242Google Scholar), whose catalytic activity is increased up to 20-fold by Ca2+-CaM (4Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 682-685Google Scholar). Second, CaM binding to eNOS can be manipulated experimentally, as it is known to be influenced by in vivo phosphorylation at one or more residues (14Fleming I. Busse R. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2003; 284: R1-R12Google Scholar). Thr-497 (Thr-495 in the human sequence) in the putative CaM-binding domain appears to be a particularly important determinant of CaM binding affinity. Dephosphorylation at this site is associated with a significantly increased CaM binding ability of eNOS, whereas phosphorylation occurs constitutively and is correlated with decreased binding (12Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Dimmeler S. Kemp B.E. Busse R. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: E68-E75Google Scholar, 14Fleming I. Busse R. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2003; 284: R1-R12Google Scholar). Conditions that cause Thr-497 dephosphorylation have generally been found to also produce phosphorylation at Ser-1179, so this site may also play a role in controlling CaM binding to the synthase (15Michell B.J. Chen Z. Tiganis T. Stapleton D. Katsis F. Power D.A. Sim A.T. Kemp B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17625-17628Google Scholar). The focus of this study is not on eNOS phosphorylation per se, but is instead on how physiologically relevant changes in the phosphorylation status of eNOS affect CaM availability in the endothelial cell. To increase CaM binding to eNOS in BAECs, we used combined treatment with FSK and IBMX, which has previously been shown to mimic, albeit in a more sustained manner, agonist-evoked Thr-497 dephosphorylation and Ser-1179 phosphorylation (15Michell B.J. Chen Z. Tiganis T. Stapleton D. Katsis F. Power D.A. Sim A.T. Kemp B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17625-17628Google Scholar). In our hands, FSK/IBMX treatment produces a ∼3-fold increase in the amount of CaM bound to eNOS in cell homogenates (Fig. 1A). Western blotting indicates a similar 2.3-fold decrease in Thr-497 phosphorylation, with a concomitant 2.5-fold increase in Ser-1179 phosphorylation. To verify that FSK/IBMX treatment increases CaM-dependent eNOS activity, NO production was measured. This activity is also increased ∼3-fold and is completely inhibited by the NOS inhibitor l-NAME (Fig. 1B). Changes in CaM availability are seen as changes in the apparent free Ca2+-CaM concentrations produced at comparable free Ca2+ concentrations. Therefore, we have simultaneously measured both free Ca2+ and free Ca2+-CaM concentrations produced in BAECs in single cells using indo-1 and CaM biosensors. We have previously developed fluorescence biosensors to monitor dynamic changes in Ca2+-CaM concentrations in living cells (8Romoser V.A. Hinkle P.M. Persechini A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13270-13274Google Scholar, 9Persechini A. Cronk B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6827-6830Google Scholar). In this study, the ability to simultaneously monitor free Ca2+ and free Ca2+-CaM has allowed us for the first time to precisely assess their relationship under different experimental conditions. Fig. 2, A and B, contain pseudo-color fluorescence ratio images of cells transiently expressing a 2 nmKd CaM biosensor (BSCaM2) and also loaded with indo-1. All the cells take up indo-1 (Fig. 2A), and generally ∼20% express BSCaM2 (Fig. 2B). Under control conditions, ionomycin rapidly increases the apparent free Ca2+-CaM concentration from below 0.1 to ∼8 nm (Fig. 2C). Pretreatment with FSK/IBMX causes a ∼3-fold reduction in the peak free Ca2+-CaM concentrations produced in response to ionomycin, with a slight increase in the peak free Ca2+ concentrations (Fig. 2D). Hence, the observed reduction in free Ca2+-CaM is due to reduced CaM availability, not a decrease in the free Ca2+ concentration. The mean Ca2+ concentration producing 50% of the peak BSCaM2 fractional response ([Ca2+]50 value) is increased from 295 ± 18 nm to 502 ± 84 nm (p < 0.05, n = 6) by FSK/IBMX treatment (Fig. 2E). Blocking eNOS activity with 100 μm l-NAME does not alter the effects of FSK/IBMX, indicating that increased NO production is not a contributing factor. To verify that changes in CaM availability could account for the observed changes in both maximal biosensor response and Ca2+ sensitivity, we have determined in vitro how formation of the CaM-BSCaM2 complex at a fixed CaM concentration is affected by increasing amounts of a CaM-binding peptide (nPEP) (16Persechini A. White H.D. Gansz K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 62-67Google Scholar) (Fig. 2F). At a low peptide concentration, the Ca2+ sensitivity of the biosensor response is reduced, followed at higher concentrations by decreases in both the Ca2+ sensitivity and magnitude of the response. Thus, changes in CaM availability are sufficient to explain the observed changes in both the magnitude and Ca2+ sensitivity of BSCaM2 response in BAECs (Fig. 2E). A potential difficulty with the results presented so far is that the biosensor may itself reduce CaM availability enough to exaggerate the effects of FSK/IBMX treatment. To address this potential problem, and to confirm the physiological significance of the observed changes in CaM availability, we have investigated the effect of FSK/IBMX and biosensor expression on PMCA activity. Among the major routes for cytosolic Ca2+ removal, only the PMCA has been shown to depend directly on Ca2+-CaM, which is bound with an apparent dissociation constant of 4 –10 nm and increases PMCA activity up to 10-fold (17Caride A.J. Elwess N.L. Verma A.K. Filoteo A.G. Enyedi A. Bajzer Z. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35227-35232Google Scholar). To determine PMCA activity we first inhibited the SERCA pump with thapsigargin and the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger by replacing Na+ in cell buffers with an equimolar amount of N-methyl-d-glucamine. l-NAME was also applied as a precaution against NO-dependent effects. Under these conditions PMCA activity is directly proportional to the Ca2+ extrusion rate (18Sedova M. Blatter L.A. Cell Calcium. 1999; 25: 333-343Google Scholar, 19Wang X. Reznick S. Li P. Liang W. van Breemen C. Cell Calcium. 2002; 31: 265-277Google Scholar). Since PMCA activity is itself Ca2+-dependent, extrusion rates were determined for cells grouped on the free Ca2+ concentration (300 – 600 nm) at the start of each extrusion time course (Fig. 3A). Relaxation times (τ) for Ca2+ extrusion from individual cells were then estimated by fitting the first 50 s of extrusion time courses to a mono-exponential (Fig. 3A). A similar approach has been used elsewhere to assess PMCA activity in endothelial cells (18Sedova M. Blatter L.A. Cell Calcium. 1999; 25: 333-343Google Scholar, 19Wang X. Reznick S. Li P. Liang W. van Breemen C. Cell Calcium. 2002; 31: 265-277Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 3, B and D, BSCaM2 expression does not alter PMCA activity, but FSK/IBMX treatment reduces it by ∼40% in both wild-type and BSCaM2-expressing BAECs. This effect may also partly explain the slight increase in peak free Ca2+ concentrations observed in cells treated with FSK/IBMX. We reasoned that if the effect of FSK/IBMX on PMCA activity is due specifically to reduced CaM availability, it should be reproduced by a CaM antagonist. We therefore expressed a CaM biosensor with a 0.3 nmKd for Ca2+-CaM (BSCaM0.3) in BAECs. This high affinity biosensor reduces PMCA activity to essentially the same extent as does FSK/IBMX treatment of wild-type BAECs (Fig. 3, C and D). Peak free Ca2+-CaM concentrations are reduced to ∼2 nm in cells expressing BSCaM0.3 (Fig. 4, A and B), compared with ∼8 nm in cells expressing BSCaM2. Most important, subsequent FSK/IBMX treatment has no further effect on PMCA activity (Fig. 3, C and D) or CaM availability (Fig. 4). Interestingly, FSK/IBMX treatment of cells expressing BSCaM2 also reduces free Ca2+-CaM to ∼2 nm (Fig. 2C), indicating that this is below what is needed for significant PMCA activation, and most likely accounting for the lack of any additional effect of FSK/IBMX in cells expressing BSCaM0.3. Consistent with this, published values for the apparent Kd value for CaM binding to the pump range from 4 to 10 nm (17Caride A.J. Elwess N.L. Verma A.K. Filoteo A.G. Enyedi A. Bajzer Z. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35227-35232Google Scholar). Although a reduction in the amount of CaM bound to the pump due to reduced CaM availability appears to adequately explain our results, other factors, notably phosphorylation, also can significantly affect PMCA activity (20Caroni P. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9371-9373Google Scholar, 21Bruce J.I. Yule D.I. Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48172-48181Google Scholar, 22James P.H. Pruschy M. Vorherr T.E. Penniston J.T. Carafoli E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4253-4258Google Scholar, 23Smallwood J.I. Gugi B. Rasmussen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2195-2202Google Scholar, 24Dean W.L. Chen D. Brandt P.C. Vanaman T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15113-15119Google Scholar). However, even allowing for such effects, our observations indicate that FSK/IBMX treatment affects PMCA activity in BAECs by reducing the free Ca2+-CaM concentrations that are produced. This confirms that the changes in CaM availability reported by BSCaM2 correspond with physiologically significant changes in the activities of CaM targets in endothelial cells. Increased CaM binding to eNOS is correlated with significant reductions in both the Ca2+ sensitivity and maximum level of BSCaM2 response. These changes represent coupling between increases in eNOS activity and decreases in the activities of other CaM targets, such as the PMCA. In this context, it should be emphasized that the response of BSCaM2 itself is also representative of a CaM target insofar as the response to a particular free Ca2+ concentration is concerned. A simple distributive mechanism is indicated, in which additional CaM is bound to the synthase at the expense of other CaM-binding proteins in the cell. Consistent with this model, quantitative immunoblotting indicates total eNOS and CaM concentrations in BAEC homogenates of 5.6 ± 0.6 and 25.9 ± 1.5 pmol/mg total protein, respectively (data not shown). Thus eNOS can bind up to 25% of total CaM in BAECs. Using a competitive binding assay we have determined an in vitro Kd value of 0.2 nm for the complex between unphosphorylated eNOS and (Ca2+)4-CaM. This value indicates a major role for eNOS in controlling CaM availability, since FSK/IBMX treatment reduces availability over a range in the free Ca2+-CaM concentrations that determines binding to targets with Kd values >1 nm, such as the PMCA and BSCaM2, but not over the lower concentration range that determines binding to those with subnanomolar dissociation constants close to that of eNOS, such as BSCaM0.3. CaM availability is a function of the affinities, Ca2+ sensitivities, and concentrations of all CaM-binding proteins in the cell. A high affinity CaM-binding protein, such as BSCaM0.3, sees a larger pool of available CaM than does a lower affinity protein. A CaM-target complex with high Ca2+ sensitivity sees a larger pool than does one with a lower sensitivity, because the former can interact with CaM under conditions where the latter cannot. In addition, all else being equal, an abundant CaM-binding protein will have a greater impact on CaM availability than one lower in abundance. The findings presented here demonstrate that signaling through CaM is shaped by the extensive network of cellular CaM-binding proteins and is therefore modulated by changes in their characteristics. Even allowing for the participation of other CaM-binding proteins in the response to FSK/IBMX, our results unequivocally demonstrate that such modulation occurs and that physiologically relevant changes in the CaM-binding characteristics of eNOS contribute to it. Phosphorylation-dependent regulation of CaM-binding is a common theme among CaM targets. It is now evident that this type of regulation can modulate CaM availability, broadly affecting the network of CaM targets and amplifying the effect of an initial regulatory phosphorylation or dephosphorylation event. From a practical standpoint, if signaling involving CaM is under study it is important to evaluate both free Ca2+ and CaM availability, reflected in biosensor occupancy or measured free Ca2+-CaM.

https://openalex.org/W2132461218,"Cell transplantation could be a potential therapy for heart damage. Skeletal myoblasts have been expected to be a good cell source for autologous transplantation; however, the safety and efficacy of their transplantation are still controversial. Recent studies have revealed that skeletal muscle possesses the stem cell population that is distinct from myoblasts. To elucidate whether skeletal muscle stem cells can transdifferentiate into cardiomyocytes, we cocultured skeletal muscle cells isolated from transgenic mice expressing green fluorescent protein with cardiomyocytes of neonatal rats. Skeletal muscle-derived cells expressed cardiac-specific proteins such as cardiac troponin T and atrial natriuretic peptide as well as cardiac-enriched transcription factors such as Nkx2E (formerly called Csx/Nkx2.5) and GATA4 by coculture with cardiomyocytes. Skeletal muscle-derived cells also expressed cadherin and connexin 43 at the junctions with neighboring cardiomyocytes. Cardiomyocyte-like action potentials were recorded from beating skeletal muscle-derived cells. Treatment of nifedipine or culture in Ca2+-free media suppressed contraction of cardiomyocytes and inhibited skeletal muscle cells to express cardiac-specific proteins. Cyclic stretch completely restored this inhibitory effect. These results suggest that some part of skeletal muscle cells can transdifferentiate into cardiomyocytes and that direct cell-to-cell contact and contraction of neighboring cardiomyocytes are important for the transdifferentiation."

https://openalex.org/W2150260147,"There is increasing evidence that both cell adhesion molecules and soluble factors are involved in tumor metastasis. We have found that endothelial cells secrete chemoattractants that can induce melanoma cell chemotaxis. Protein separation on an ion-exchange column shows the association of IL-8 with fractions that contain the chemoattractant activity. This activity is completely lost from the conditioned medium after immunoprecipitation with anti-IL-8 antibodies, indicating that IL-8 is the major melanoma chemoattractant secreted by endothelial cells. IL-877, the predominant endothelial IL-8 isoform that contains 77 amino acids, is found to be twice as potent as the more common 72-amino acid isoform IL-872. Antibody inhibition studies indicate that the chemotactic response of melanoma cells is mediated by the CXC-chemokine receptor CXCR1 and not by the more promiscuous CXCR2. When stimulated by tumor necrosis factor alpha, the nonresponsive WM35 melanoma cells synthesize a higher level of CXCR1 and become chemotactic toward interleukin (IL)-8. Pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin nullifies their chemotactic response, suggesting the involvement of G proteins. Antibodies against either IL-8 or CXCR1 inhibit melanoma transendothelial migration in a coculture assay by 30%. These results are consistent with a role for IL-8-induced chemotaxis in the transendothelial migration of melanoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W2132066310,"Programmed cell death involves a complex and interrelated cascade of cysteine proteases termed caspases that are synthesized as inactive zymogens, which are proteolytically processed to active enzymes. Caspase-8 is an initiator caspase that becomes activated when Fas death receptor-Fas ligand (FasL) coupling on the cell surface leads to coalescence of a ""death complex"" perpetuating the programmed cell death cascade. In this study, brain tissue samples removed from adult patients during the surgical management of severe intracranial hypertension after traumatic brain injury (TBI; n=17) were compared with postmortem control brain tissue samples (n=6). Caspase-8 mRNA was measured by semiquantitative reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction, and caspase-8 protein was examined by Western blot and immunocytochemistry. Fas and FasL were also examined using Western blot. Caspase-8 mRNA and protein were increased in TBI patients vs. controls, and caspase-8 protein was predominately expressed in neurons. Proteolysis of caspase-8 to 20-kDa fragments was seen only in TBI patients. Fas was also increased after TBI vs. control and was associated with relative levels of caspase-8, supporting formation of a death complex. These data identify additional steps in the programmed cell death cascade involving Fas death receptors and caspase-8 after TBI in humans."

We examined the participation of dopamine and D1 dopamine receptors in the genesis of postsynaptic neurodegeneration. Chronic treatment of human SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cells with dopamine or H2O2 increased NO production and accelerated cytotoxicity, as indexed by enhanced nitrite levels and cell death. The antioxidant sodium metabisulfite or SCH 23390, a D1 dopamine receptor-selective antagonist, partially blocked dopamine effects but together ablated dopamine-mediated cytotoxicity, indicating the participation of both autoxidation and D1 receptor stimulation. Direct activation of D1 dopamine receptors with SKF R-38393 caused cytotoxicity, which was refractory to sodium metabisulfite. Dopamine and SKF R-38393 induced overexpression of the nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms neuronal NOS, inducible NOS (iNOS), and endothelial NOS in a protein kinase A-dependent manner. Functional studies showed that ∼60% of total NOS activity was due to activation of iNOS. The NOS inhibitor N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester and genistein, wortmannin, or NF-κB SN50, inhibitors of protein tyrosine kinases phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and NF-κB, respectively, reduced nitrite production by dopamine and SKF R-38393 but were less effective in attenuating H2O2-mediated effects. In rat striatal neurons, dopamine and SKF R-38393, but not H2O2, accelerated cell death through increased expression of neuronal NOS and iNOS but not endothelial NOS.

Nucl. Med. Biol. 1998; 25: 721-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Moreover, striatonigral neurodegeneration was also observed in monkeys treated with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine or 3-nitropropionic acid (5Imam S.Z. el-Yazal J. Newport G.D.

Recent studies implicate the participation of both reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) in the pathophysiology of striatonigral neurodegeneration (5Imam S.Z. el-Yazal J.

Neurochem. 2002; 81: 122-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) through mechanisms that remain undefined. Because striatal neurons do not produce dopamine or express the dopamine transporter (DAT), the mechanism of dopamine-mediated neurotoxicity in such neurons occurs through extracellularly present dopamine in the synapse (9Calabresi P. Centonze D. Gubellini P. Marfia G.A. Pisani A. Sancesario G. Bernardi G. Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 61: 231-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 10Nagatsu T. J. Neural Transm. 2002; 109: 732-745Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Normally, dopamine released into the synapse is rapidly cleared and recycled by the DATs of presynaptic neurons. In 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-treated animals, MSA-P, and in methamphetamine-induced neurotoxicity, however, large amounts of dopamine accumulate extracellularly in the synapse, which upon spontaneous autoxidation, produces ROS and RNS (11Whitehead R.E. Ferrer J.V. Javitch J.A. Justice J.B. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1242-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Moreover, in METH addictive states, elevated synaptic levels of dopamine accumulate not only through blockage of DAT up-take activity but also by presynaptic depletion of dopamine from storage vesicles secondary to a blockage of the vesicular monamine transporter, with enhanced release of dopamine into the synapse, an effect also produced by MPP+ (1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium), the bioactive metabolite of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine. Synaptic dopamine stimulates its cognate D1 and D2 dopamine receptors, localized on postsynaptic neurons; prolonged stimulation of these receptors causes their desensitization (12Sibley D.R. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 288: 421-427Google Scholar, 13Sidhu A. Niznik H.B. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 2000; 18: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In addition to stimulation of adenylyl cyclase, activation of D1 dopamine receptors induces the expression of several early immediate genes, such as c-fos, c-jun, JunB, and zif-268 (14Steiner H. Kitai S.T. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5449-5460Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which in turn act as positive modulators of genes that promote ROS and RNS production when overexpressed, including NF-κB and NOS (15Yurochko A.D. Hwang E.S. Rasmussen L. Keay S. Pereira L. Huang E.S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5051-5059Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Rao K.M. J. Toxicol. Environ. Health B. Crit. Rev. 2000; 3: 27-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In particular, iNOS is capable of producing large amounts of nitric oxide (NO), which can rapidly reach cytotoxic levels (17Keinanen R. Vartiainen N. Koistinaho J. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 234: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 18Coleman J.W. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2002; 129: 4-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Although a link between D1 receptor stimulation and the generation of ROS or RNS has never been demonstrated, recent studies indicate that blockage of D1 dopamine receptors with selective antagonists has strong neuroprotective and anti-parkinsonian effects (19Andringa G. Lubbers L. Drukarch B. Stoof J.C. Cools A.R. Behav. Pharmacol. 1999; 10: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 20Andringa G. Stoof J.C. Cools A.R. Psychopharmacology (Berl). 1999; 146: 328-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), supporting the concept of co-participation of D1 receptors in the maintenance and/or pathogenesis of postsynaptic neurodegeneration and oxidative stress. To investigate the overall role of extracellular dopamine in degeneration of striatonigral neurons and of D1 dopamine receptors in particular, studies were conducted in both rat primary neuronal striatal cultures and in human SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cells. The latter was chosen as a postsynaptic striatal cell model system because it endogenously expresses the D1 dopamine receptor and contains the appropriate receptor-linked dopaminergic signaling machinery, a feature lacking in transfected cells (21Sidhu A. Fishman P.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 166: 574-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Moreover, the molecular properties of these cells, which include lack of expression of D2-like and D5 dopamine receptors (21Sidhu A. Fishman P.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 166: 574-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 22Sidhu A. J. Recept. Signal Transduct. Res. 1997; 17: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), the absence of DAT (23Pifl C. Giros B. Caron M.G. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 4246-4253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a hallmark protein of presynaptic nigrostriatal neuronal projections, and negligible tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) activity (24Nagatsu T. Ichinose H. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1999; 19: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), are reminiscent of D1 dopamine receptor-expressing striatal neurons. In this report we provide evidence to show that dopamine is a strong oxidant and that 50% of its potency is entirely attributable to the direct stimulation of D1 dopamine receptors and subsequent activation of specific signaling pathways that are modulated by these receptors. Dopamine caused a marked overexpression of NOS, primarily iNOS and nNOS, with concomitant increases in NO levels, oxidative stress, and cytotoxicity. These results highlight a previously unknown role of D1 dopamine receptors in neurodegeneration and provide a heuristic framework in which to view the mechanisms underlying, and treatment of, striatal neurodegeneration. Materials—Human SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Nu-serum was purchased from Collaborative Biomedical Products (Bedford, MA). RPMI 1640 medium without phenol red, dopamine, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), l-NAME, sodium metabisulfite (SMBS), indatraline (INDT), sodium nitrite, SKF R-38393, and SCH 23390 were purchased from Sigma. KT5720, wortmannin, genistein, mPKCi, NF-κB SN50, and 1400W were from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Co. Cell Culture, Drug Treatment, and Cell Viability—SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cells were grown in 12-well culture plates (seeding density 1.0 × 105/well) in RPMI 1640 medium without phenol red supplemented with 10% (v/v) Nu-serum, antibiotics and 2 mm l-glutamine in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 at 37 °C until 90% confluent. Cells were then serum-starved overnight with serum-free RPMI medium and incubated with drugs for 16 h. Control cells were treated with an equal concentration of solvent (0.2% H2O). After incubation, 0.3 ml of medium was removed to measure nitrite concentration. Cell viability in 12-well plates was evaluated by counting viable cells in a Neubauer cell using the trypan blue exclusion test whereby viable cells exposed to trypan blue for no more than 15 min exclude the dye, as described by the manufacturer's (Sigma) protocol. Values from each treatment were expressed as percentage of survival relative to control. Rat Primary Striatal Neuronal Cultures—Striata from 18-day-old rat embryos were isolated, and cells were dissociated by mechanical disruption, counted, and grown (600–800 cells seeded/mm2) in neurobasal medium supplemented with 2% (v/v) B-27 supplement and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol on glass cover-slips precoated with poly-l-ornithine (15% w/v in PBS; Sigma) and laminin (3 μg/ml in PBS; Sigma) for 6 days, as described by Brewer et al. (25Brewer G.J. Torricelli J.R. Evege E.K. Price P.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1883) Google Scholar). Neurons were exposed for 16 h to 5 μm dopamine, SKF R-38393, or H2O2 with or without pretreatment for 30 min with either 20 μm SMBS or 1 μm D1-selective antagonist SCH 23390. Control cells were treated with an equal concentration of solvent (0.2% H2O). Neuronal cell viability was measured by the trypan blue exclusion method. Nitrite and NOS Activity Measurements—NOS activity was measured by assessing nitrite levels, a stable byproduct of NO, by a modification of the method of Dawson et al. (26Dawson V.L. Brahmbhatt H.P. Mong J.A. Dawson T.M. Neuropharmacology. 1994; 33: 1425-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.3 ml of Griess reagent (1 part 0.1% naphthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride in H2O and 1 part 1% sulfanilamide in 5% H3PO4), and 0.3 ml of culture medium from treated cells (see above) were mixed. After 30 min of incubation at 45 °C, the absorbance at 550 nm was determined. The NO2- concentration was determined from a standard curve using NaNO2 at a range of 0–10 μm. Results were expressed as nm/1.0 × 105 cells or -fold increase in nitrite levels after drug treatment over distilled water-treated control. Cell viability was assessed by the trypan blue exclusion method. NOS activity was measured by estimating the conversion of [3H]arginine to [3H]citrulline with an enzyme assay kit from Calbiochem. Briefly, SK-N-MC cells were harvested and homogenized in homogenization buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm each, EDTA and EGTA). Cell extracts (5–10 μg of protein) were incubated with 16.13 μm [3H]arginine (Amersham Biosciences; 62 Ci/mmol) in reaction buffer for 30 min, and total NOS activity was measured as per the manufacturer's instruction. Cells that were not treated with SKF R-38393 were used as controls. To estimate iNOS activity, assays were conducted in the presence of 1 μm selective iNOS inhibitor 1400W, and the residual activity, presenting contribution by both eNOS and nNOS, was subtracted from total NOS activity, obtained in the absence of any inhibitor. Plasmids and Transfection—Human dopamine transporter (hDAT) cDNA construct (a gift from H. B. Niznik and F. Liu) was subcloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). SK-N-MC cells (60% confluent) were transiently transfected by the DEAE-dextran/chloroquine method as described by Pristupa et al. (27Pristupa Z.B. Wilson J.M. Hoffman B.J. Kish S.J. Niznik H.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 125-135PubMed Google Scholar) and Lee et al. (28Lee F.J. Pristupa Z.B. Ciliax B.J. Levey A.I. Niznik H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20885-20894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with Dulbecco's PBS and RPMI 1640, and the DNA/DEAE-dextran/medium mixture was added (2 μg of DNA/well). 100 μm chloroquine (Sigma) was added into the wells to increase the transfection efficiency. After 3 h of incubation at 37 °C and 5% CO2 with gentle swirling of the wells every 15 min, the cells were exposed to 10% Me2SO in Dulbecco's PBS for exactly 1 min, washed twice with RPMI 1640 plus 10% Nu-serum, and grown for further 48 h in RPMI plus 10% Nuserum. Mock-transfected cells were transfected with a pcDNA3.1 plasmid that lacked a DNA insert. [3H]Dopamine Uptake—[3H]DA uptake was measured as described by Lee et al. (28Lee F.J. Pristupa Z.B. Ciliax B.J. Levey A.I. Niznik H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20885-20894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 days after transfection, culture medium was removed, and wells were rinsed twice with 1 ml of uptake buffer (5 mm Tris, 7.5 mm HEPES, 120 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4,1mm ascorbic acid, 5 mm glucose, pH 7.1). Cells were incubated in triplicate with 20 nm [3H]dopamine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences NET-131; 31.6 Ci/mmol) in uptake buffer for 10 min at room temperature. Nonspecific uptake was defined in the presence of 10 μm DAT blocker indatraline. Wells were rinsed twice with 1 ml of uptake buffer, cells were counted using trypan blue, and radioactivity incorporated into cells was measured by liquid scintillation counting after protein hydrolysis in 1 ml of 0.1 n NaOH for 1 h at 37 °C. Protein Preparation and Immunoblot Analysis—Cell homogenates were prepared as previously described (29Kimura K. White B.H. Sidhu A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14672-14678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (30Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis was performed essentially as previously described (31Sidhu A. Kimura K. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Briefly, homogenate protein (50 μg/lane) was loaded onto 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred overnight to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Micron Separations Inc., Westboro, MA). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dried milk in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) followed by an overnight incubation at 4 °C with rabbit anti-nNOS, anti-iNOS, and anti-eNOS polyclonal antibodies (1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). After extensive washing, the blots were incubated for 2 h with horseradish peroxidase-linked donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000). Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) was carried out using Renaissance Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The blots were stripped and reprobed overnight with goat anti-actin monoclonal antibodies (1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by incubation for 2 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (1:5000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and ECL. Immunocytochemistry—Six-day-old rat primary striatal cultures were fixed with 3% (v/v) paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in Dulbecco's PBS, as described by Prou et al. (32Prou D. Gu W.J. Le Crom S. Vincent J.D. Salamero J. Vernier P. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3517-3527PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with primary rabbit polyclonal antisera (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) against either nNOS, iNOS, or eNOS for 12 h at 4 °C and for 2 h at room temperature with Alexa® Fluor® 568-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (1:500; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Cells were analyzed with a Nikon Eclipse E800 fluorescent microscope. Data Analysis—Results are expressed as the means ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. Within an experiment, each data point was determined in triplicate. All statistical analyses were performed using Instat Statistical Software (Graphpad, Sorrento Valley, CA). Statistical comparisons were performed with both one-factor analysis of variance and Scheffe's F test. Values of p < 0.05 or less were considered as statistically significant. Dopamine Enhances Free Radical Production and Cell Death—Because dopamine spontaneously autoxidizes to generate free radicals, its efficacy as an oxidant was compared with another oxidant, H2O2, which also undergoes spontaneous oxidation. SK-N-MC cells (90% confluence) were incubated for 16 h with increasing concentrations of either dopamine or H2O2, and free radical production was indexed by measuring nitrite levels, a stable byproduct of NO released into the growth medium (Fig. 1A). Although both compounds increased nitrite levels, dopamine-induced increase in nitrite production was 2-fold higher compared with H2O2. To assess if the dopamine effects were partly or entirely mediated via D1 dopamine receptors, we stimulated these receptors directly with increasing concentrations of the D1 receptor agonist, SKF R-38393. Similar to dopamine and H2O2, SKF R-38393 caused an increase in nitrite production that was comparable in magnitude to that obtained with H2O2 but was significantly (p < 0.01) less than that seen with dopamine (Fig. 1A). These data indicate that direct stimulation of D1 dopamine receptors induces production of NO. Because both dopamine and H2O2, but not SKF R-38393, are rapidly autoxidized, we measured the t ½ of nitrite production (Fig. 1B) and found there were no significant differences between dopamine (∼5 h) and H2O2 or SKF R-38393 (∼6 h), indicating that the higher levels of nitrite production induced by dopamine were not linked to different rates of autoxidation of dopamine and H2O2. NO is a physiologically relevant retrograde neurotransmitter and, as such, is not necessarily cytotoxic, except when produced in large amounts. It was, thus, essential to estimate whether such enhanced production of NO was associated with enhanced cytotoxicity toward the SK-N-MC cells. SK-N-MC cultures were exposed for 16 h with increasing doses of dopamine, H2O2, and SKF R-38393, and cell death was measured by trypan blue staining, whereby viable cells exclude the dye (Fig. 1C). The results show that at all doses tested, production of NO by these compounds accelerated cell death relative to untreated cells. Moreover, dopamine was persistently more cytotoxic than either H2O2 or SKF R-38393, consistent with its ability to produce larger amounts of NO than either of these two compounds. Dopamine Effects Are Extracellularly Mediated—Striatal degeneration is necessarily mediated by extracellular dopamine, since such neurons do not express TH and do not produce any dopamine. Therefore, it was important to show that the cytotoxic effects of dopamine on SK-N-MC cells were extracellularly mediated. We measured [3H]DA uptake in SK-N-MC cells transfected with the hDAT DNA and compared our findings to cells transfected with the pcDNA3.1 vector. In mock-transfected cells, there was no measurable uptake of [3H]dopamine, consistent with the absence of hDAT in these cells (Fig. 2A). In hDAT-transfected cells, there was a large increase in [3H]DA uptake (p < 0.001), which was completely blocked by 10 μm specific DAT blocker, INDT. In mock-transfected SK-N-MC cells challenged with 50 μm dopamine, the additional presence of INDT (10 μm) had no effect on either nitrite production (Fig. 2B) or cell viability (Fig. 2C), providing further evidence that dopamine was not taken up into these cells and that the observed toxicity of dopamine was entirely extracellularly mediated. Dopamine Effects Are Partially Mediated via D1 Dopamine Receptors—To further dissect the nature of dopamine-mediated production of nitrite and cell death, SK-N-MC cells were treated with dopamine in the absence or presence (200 μm) of the antioxidant SMBS, the D1-selective antagonist SCH 23390 (10 μm), or both. In the presence of SMBS, dopamine-induced nitrite production and cell death were significantly (p < 0.01) decreased by ∼50% (Fig. 3A). In the presence of both SCH 23390 and SMBS, these cytotoxic effects of dopamine were virtually abrogated. These data indicate that dopamine actions occur through two distinct pathways, one involving D1 dopamine receptors and the other due to its properties as an oxidant. We next conducted parallel studies using H2O2 and found that in the presence of SMBS both nitrite production and cell death were significantly (p < 0.01) reduced to near control levels (Fig. 3B). When these studies were performed in the presence of SCH 23390, the ability of H2O2 to increase nitrite production and cell death was completely unaffected. These data show that unlike dopamine, H2O2 mediates its effects solely as an oxidant and not through activation of the D1 dopamine receptor. Similar cytotoxicity studies were also conducted by directly stimulating D1 receptors with SKF R-38393 in the presence or absence of SMBS or SCH 23390. Unlike the results obtained with dopamine or H2O2, SMBS failed to modulate either SKF R-38393-induced nitrite production or cell death, consistent with lack of oxidation of this agonist. However, both SKF R-38393-generated nitrite production and cell death were blocked upon co-incubation of cells with SCH 23390 (Fig. 3C), confirming the direct participation of D1 dopamine receptors in the SKF R-38393-induced production of NO associated with enhanced cell death. D1 Dopamine Receptors Increase NOS Expression—To define the mechanisms by which D1 receptors and dopamine increase production of NO, we measured the expression levels of the three NOS isozymes. Both dopamine and H2O2 caused increased expression of nNOS, iNOS, and eNOS in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4, A, B, and C, respectively). At concentrations of 50 μm, dopamine elicited a small but significantly (p < 0.05) higher increase in nNOS expression than H2O2, and both compounds increased eNOS expression by equivalent amounts. The largest difference between these compounds (50 μm) was observed with iNOS, where dopamine induced a significantly (p < 0.01) higher (>2-fold) increase in expression of this enzyme compared with H2O2. Similarly, at a concentration of 100 μm, dopamine caused a significantly (p < 0.01) higher (∼2-fold) increase in iNOS expression relative to H2O2. When we concurrently examined the effects of SKF R-38393, we found significant increases in nNOS, iNOS, and eNOS protein levels at all concentrations of the agonist tested (Fig. 4D). Moreover, these increases in NOS expression were significantly (p < 0.05) reduced by SCH 23390, attesting to the ability of the D1 receptor to activate the NOS enzymes. We also verified the ability of the NOS inhibitor, l-NAME, to block the activation of NOS. In the presence of l-NAME (50 μm), dopamine-mediated nitrite production was reduced by ∼50% (Fig. 5A), with a comparable increase in cell viability compared with cells not treated with l-NAME (Fig. 5B). By contrast, H2O2-mediated effects were much less sensitive to l-NAME, and in the presence of this NOS inhibitor, nitrite levels were reduced by only 15%, accompanied by only a modest increase in cell viability (Fig. 5). The SKF R-38393 effects were almost completely blocked by l-NAME, with restoration of both nitrite levels and cell viability to near control levels (Fig. 5), suggesting that SKF R-38393 mediates its effects almost entirely through the activation of the NOS enzymes. By contrast, at least part of the effects elicited by dopamine and virtually all of that induced by H2O2 occur through mechanisms that do not require the participation of the NOS enzymes. Specific Dopaminergic-linked Signal Transduction Pathways Are Activated—The D1 dopamine receptor modulates several signal transduction pathways, including the activation of adenylyl cyclase (33Sidhu A. Mol. Neurobiol. 1998; 16: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), phospholipase C (34Undie A.S. Weinstock J. Sarau H.M. Friedman E. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 2045-2048Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), protein kinase C (35Yao L.P. Li X.X. Yu P.Y. Xu J. Asico L.D. Jose P.A.

To identify the signaling pathway participating in the cytotoxic response of D1 receptors, we treated cells with selective inhibitors of various kinases (Table I). The effects of both dopamine and SKF R-38393 proceeded in part through the activation of protein kinase A, a cAMP-dependent enzyme, consistent with the ability of the D1 dopamine receptor to increase, after activation, the intracellular steady-state levels of cAMP.

The third intracellular loops of the α2A, α2B, and α2C-AR subtypes interact with spinophilin, a multidomain protein that, like the three α2-AR subtypes, is enriched at the basolateral surface of MDCKII cells. The present studies provide evidence that α2-AR interaction with spinophilin contributes to cell surface stabilization of the receptor. We exploited the unique targeting profile of the α2B-AR subtype in MDCKII cells: random delivery to apical and basolateral surfaces with rapid (t ½ ≤ 60 min) apical versus slower (t ½ = 10–12 h) basolateral turnover. Apical delivery of a spinophilin subdomain containing the α2-AR-interacting region (Sp151–483) by fusion with apically targeted p75NTR extended the half-life of α2B-AR at the apical surface to ∼3.6 h and eliminated the rapid phase (0–60 min) of α2B-AR turnover on that surface. Furthermore, we examined α2B-AR turnover at the surface of mouse embryo fibroblasts derived from wild type (Sp+/+) or spinophilin knock-out (Sp–/–) mice. Two independent experimental approaches demonstrated that agonist-evoked internalization of HA-α2B-AR was accelerated in mouse embryo fibroblasts derived from Sp–/– mice. These findings are consistent with the interpretation that endogenous spinophilin contributes to the stabilization of α2B-AR and presumably all three α2-AR subtypes at the surface of target cells and may act as a scaffold that could link α2-ARs to proteins interacting with spinophilin via other domains."
https://openalex.org/W2068581379,"Among various molecular strategies by which prostate cancer cells evade apoptosis, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling represents a dominant survival pathway. However, different prostate cancer cell lines such as LNCaP and PC-3 display differential sensitivity to the apoptotic effect of PI3K inhibition in serum-free media, reflecting the heterogeneous nature of prostate cancer in apoptosis regulation. Whereas both cell lines are equally susceptible to LY294002-mediated Akt dephosphorylation, only LNCaP cells default to apoptosis, as evidenced by DNA fragmentation and cytochrome c release. In PC-3 cells, Akt deactivation does not lead to cytochrome c release, suggesting that the intermediary signaling pathway is short-circuited by an antiapoptotic factor. This study presents evidence that Bcl-xL overexpression provides a distinct survival mechanism that protects PC-3 cells from apoptotic signals emanating from PI3K inhibition. First, the Bcl-xL/BAD ratio in PC-3 cells is at least an order of magnitude greater than that of LNCaP cells. Second, ectopic expression of Bcl-xL protects LNCaP cells against LY294002-induced apoptosis. Third, antisense down-regulation of Bcl-xL sensitizes PC-3 cells to the apoptotic effect of LY294002. The physiological relevance of this Bcl-xL-mediated survival mechanism is further underscored by the protective effect of serum on LY294002-induced cell death in LNCaP cells, which is correlated with a multifold increase in Bcl-xL expression. In contrast to Bcl-xL, Bcl-2 expression levels are similar in both cells lines, and do not respond to serum stimulation, suggesting that Bcl-2 may not play a physiological role in antagonizing apoptosis signals pertinent to BAD activation in prostate cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2120163083,"Recent evidence suggests that insulin signaling through the insulin receptor A type (Ex11-), regulates insulin gene transcription. Because chronic hyperglycemia negatively affects insulin receptor function and regulates alternative splicing of the insulin receptor, we inquired whether chronic exposure of pancreatic beta-cells to high glucose results in alterations in insulin signaling due to changes in insulin receptor expression and relative abundance of its spliced isoforms. Our results demonstrate that the insulin receptor is localized in insulin secretory vescicles in human pancreatic beta-cells. Furthermore, we find that alterations in insulin expression and secretion caused by chronic exposure to high glucose are paralleled by decreased insulin receptor expression and increased relative abundance of the Ex11+ isoform in both human islets and RIN beta-cells. PDX-1 and HMGI(Y) transcription factors are down-regulated by high glucose. These changes are associated with defects in insulin signaling involving insulin receptor-associated PI 3-kinase/Akt/PHAS-I pathway in RIN beta-cells. Re-expression in RIN beta-cells chronically exposed to high glucose of the Ex11-, but not the Ex11+, isoform restored insulin mRNA expression. These data suggest that changes in early steps of insulin receptor signaling may play a role in determining beta-cell dysfunction caused by chronic hyperglycemia."
https://openalex.org/W2087851176,"Glucocorticoid (GC) insensitivity is a major clinical challenge in the treatment of many inflammatory diseases. It has been shown previously that GC insensitivity, in several inflammatory cell types, is due to an overabundance of the β isoform of the glucocorticoid receptor (GCRβ) relative to the ligand binding isoform, GCRα. GCRβ functions as a dominant inhibitor of GCRα action. A number of GCR isoforms are created from the same pre-mRNA transcript via alternative splicing, and the factor or factors that control alternative splicing of GCR pre-mRNA are of great importance. In the current study, we have identified the predominant alternative splicing factor present in human neutrophils, which is known to be exceptionally GC-insensitive. The predominant alternative splicing factor in neutrophils is SRp30c, which is one of several highly conserved serine-arginine-rich (SR) proteins that are involved in both constitutive and alternative splicing in eukaryotic cells. Inhibition of SRp30c expression with antisense oligonucleotide strongly inhibited expression of GCRβ and stimulated expression of GCRα.

The pharmacologic actions of GCs are mediated through intracellular receptors, the glucocorticoid receptors (GCR). There are two isoforms of GCR in human cells, GCRα and GCRβ, which are generated from a single gene via alternative splicing of the primary RNA transcript.

GCRβ is truncated at the C terminus, which corresponds to the ligand binding domain. Thus, GCRβ cannot bind GC. In addition, GCRβ does not transactivate GC-sensitive genes and functions as a dominant inhibitor of GCRα (8Oakley R.H. Jewell C.M. Yudt M.R. Bofetiado D.M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27857-27866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Previous studies suggest that GCRα:GCRβ heterodimer formation may account for the reduced effectiveness of GC action in cells overexpressing GCRβ (8Oakley R.H. Jewell C.M. Yudt M.R. Bofetiado D.M.

Recent experiments in our lab demonstrated that overexpression of human GCRβ by mouse hybridoma cells results in the development of GC insensitivity by these cells (9Hauk P.J. Goleva E. Strickland I.

Different cell types from the same individual can have very different ratios of GCRα to GCRβ. For example, freshly isolated peripheral blood neutrophils are GC-insensitive. Both the absolute level of GCRβ and the ratio of GCRβ to GCRα protein are much higher in neutrophils than in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from the same individuals (10Strickland I.

The ratio of GCRβ to GCRα can be altered by cytokine stimulation. After stimulation of neutrophils with IL-8, GCRβ mRNA levels increased remarkably, and GCRα mRNA decreased to undetectable levels. Similarly, exposure of PBMC to IL-2 and IL-4 resulted in increased GCRβ expression and development of steroid insensitivity (1Leung D.Y. Hamid Q. Vottero A. Szefler S.J. Surs W. Minshall E.

Therefore, the goal of this research has been to identify the factor or factors involved in determining whether exon 9α is joined to exon 8 to generate mRNA encoding GCRα or whether exon 8 is joined to exon 9β, resulting in mRNA encoding GCRβ. Pre-mRNA splicing is an essential step in eukaryotic gene expression. It is a multistep process including the accurate recognition of splice sites, excision of intronic sequences, and ligation of the 5′ and 3′ ends of the resulting fragments (15Jamison S.F. Pasman Z.

Cell. 1998; 92: 315-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). The major components of the spliceosome are small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles U1, U2, and U4/U6, and several proteins including a family of serine-arginine-rich proteins known as the SR proteins. SR proteins have a dual role in pre-mRNA splicing in vivo and in vitro (21Smith C.W. Valcarcel J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 381-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). They are involved in constitutive as well as alternative splicing. SR proteins have one or two N-terminal RNA recognition motifs and a C terminus rich in arginine/serine dipeptide repeats (the RS domain) (22Zuo P. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1356-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), which mediates protein interactions with other components of the splicing machinery. In the following experiments, we have identified the SR protein required for alternative splicing of the GCR primary RNA transcript into GCRβ mRNA Cell Isolation—Human neutrophils and PBMC were isolated from normal healthy individuals using a Percoll (Amersham Biosciences) (23Sala A.

The whole blood was centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 20 min, and then upper platelet-rich plasma layer was removed and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min. The platelet-poor plasma supernatant was aspirated from the platelet pellet. In the meantime, 5 ml of 6% (w/v) dextran (Amersham Biosciences) and saline was added to 50 ml to the cellular component. Erythrocytes were allowed to sediment for 30 min at room temperature, and the leukocyte-rich supernatant was collected. Then the leukocyte-rich supernatant was sedimented at 1000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the white blood cell pellet was resuspended with 2 ml of platelet-poor plasma. This was underlayed with 42% (w/v) Percoll followed by 51% (w/v) Percoll. After 5 min, the leukocytes were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 min. PBMC and neutrophils formed separate bands at the Percoll density interfaces and were collected. The purity of neutrophils isolated by this method was >95%, as determined by Wright-Giemsa staining. Stimulation of Neutrophils with IL-8 —Freshly separated neutrophils from normal individuals were cultured at a concentration of 1.0 × 106/ml in the presence and absence of IL-8 (0.5 μg/ml) (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN) for 2 h. Then cells were harvested, and proteins were extracted. Generation of Monoclonal Antibodies—Hybridomas CRL-2385 (ATCC, Manassas, VA), which produce monoclonal antibody against a conserved epitope on a subset of SR proteins, were cultured for 10 days, and then supernatants were collected (24Neugebauer K.M. Stolk J.A. Roth M.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 899-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Cell and nuclear lysates were prepared from neutrophils, PBMC, and the PLB-985 cell line. Cells were resuspended in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 1 mm EDTA, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μm pepstatin, and 1 μm leupeptin). After 30 min, cells were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were collected, and proteins were resolved by electrophoresis followed by electrophoretic transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) in Tris-glycine buffer. Membranes were blocked overnight with blocking buffer (5% milk, 10% 50 mm sodium phosphate, 3% 5 m NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) and then incubated with primary antibody to GCRβ (rabbit polyclonal antibody, ABR Affinity Bioreagents INC, Golden, CO), total GCR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and SR proteins (ATCC, CRL-2385) for 2 h, washed, and then incubated with secondary antibody, horseradish peroxidase protein A (Amersham Biosciences), for GCRβ and total GCR, horseradish peroxidase-rat anti-mouse IgG1 (Zymed Laboratories Inc., So. San Francisco, CA) for SR proteins for 1 h. Membranes were washed and developed with ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). PLB-985 Cell Differentiation—PLB-985 cells were stimulated with retinoic acid (Sigma) (25Tucker K.A. Lilly M.B. Heck Jr., L. Rado T.A. Blood. 1987; 70: 372-378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 14.9 μl of 6.7 mm retinoic acid were added to 100 ml of medium with 2.0 × 107 cells (final concentration of retinoic acid, 1 μm). Medium was changed on the third day. After 5 days, slides were made and stained with Diff Quick (Fisher) to evaluate nuclear morphology. Transfection of Antisense Oligonucleotides Using Electroporation— PLB-985 cells were washed once in Hanks' balanced salt solution. 5.0 × 106 cells were resuspended in 500 μl of RPMI with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (without antibiotics) and then transferred to electroporation cuvettes (Disposable Micro-Electroporation Chambers, Invitrogen). 10 μg of fluorescein-labeled antisense oligonucleotides (Midland Certified Reagent Co, Midland, TX) were added to 500 μl of RPMI/fetal calf serum in the cuvettes, mixed gently, and then incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Cells were permeabilized with a single pulse using the Invitrogen electroporation apparatus set to 800 ohms to 230 V. These conditions were defined as producing optimal permeabilization with minimal toxicity in preliminary experiments. The cells were incubated for 25–30 min at room temperature in the electroporation cuvettes and then transferred to flasks containing 25 ml of differentiation medium. Flow Cytometry—Flow cytometry was performed on a FACSCaliber instrument, and analysis used CELL QUEST Software(Becton Dickinson). Uptake studies were performed using purified oligonucleotides to ensure that only intact oligonucleotides were studied. 1 ml containing 1.0 × 106 cells was added into 5-ml FALCON tubes (BD Biosciences), and efficiency of uptake was checked by the flow cytometry. Cells positive for fluorescein were sorted within 12 h of electroporation and placed into cultures for differentiation. RNA Isolation and cDNA Preparation—Total RNA was isolated from fresh neutrophils, PBMC, and PLB-985 cells by using RNA-Bee (TELTEST, Friendswood, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription reactions used ∼2 μg of total RNA in 20 μl with 200 units of SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Plasmid Construction—Plasmids used to create standard curves for real-time PCR were generated as follows: SRp30a cDNA region spanning nucleotides 111–990 GenBank™ (NM_006924) was amplified with forward primer (5′-TTTTCGTCACCGCCATGTC-3′) and reverse primer (5′-CAATTCAACACTTTAGCCCA-3′) (all primers were designed using Macvector 6.5.3) (Accelrys), SRp30b region spanning nucleotides 194–630 (GenBank™ NM_003016) was amplified with forward primer (5′-GACCTCCCTCAAGGTGGACAAC-3′) and reverse primer (5′-ACCGAGATCGAGAACGAGTGC-3′), SRp30c cDNA region spanning nucleotides 312–986 (GenBank™ NM_003769) was amplified with forward primer (5′-CCAGGACTTATGGAGGTCGG-3′) and reverse primer (5′-AACCCCACAAAGACAGAACG-3′) using cDNA prepared from RNA extracted from fresh cells. The PCR products were cloned into the PGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Real-time PCR—An ABI7700 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with Taqman probe sets was used to quantify mRNA levels. Primers were designed to amplify segments of ∼200 bp to maximize efficiency. Primer sequences were as follows: SRp30a, forward primer, 5′-TTGAGTTCGAGGACCCGC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CGTAATCATAGCCGTCGCG-3′; Taqman probe, 6-fam-CGCGGAAGACGCGGTGTATGG-tam.

SRp30c, forward primer, 5′-TTTCCGAGTTCTTGTTTCAGGAC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CTCGCATGTGATCCTTCAGGT-3′; Taqman probe, 6-fam-CCTCCGTCAGGCAGCTGGCAG-tam. Each sample was tested in duplicate, and all PCR runs were performed three times. Each sequence was quantified relative to a standard curve of its cognate cloned cDNA sequence. SR Protein Levels in Neutrophils and PBMC—To identify candidate proteins for the GCR alternative splicing factors, we compared the complements of SR proteins in cell extracts from human neutrophils, which are rich in GCRβ, with extracts from PBMC, which have low levels of GCRβ. Western blot analysis of cell extracts was performed on 20 μg of nuclear extracts from neutrophils and PBMC separated from six normal donors. Both freshly isolated neutrophils and PBMC expressed SR proteins (Fig. 1). The blots were developed using chemiluminescence, and the intensity of each band was measured using a flatbed scanner and NIH Image 1.61. We compared SRp20, SRp30, SRp40, SRp55, and SRp75 levels in neutrophils and PBMC. However, neutrophils contained SR proteins predominantly in the 30-kDa range. Levels of SRp30 in neutrophils were significantly greater than in PBMC when data from the six individuals were pooled and averaged (3.3 ± 0.97 density units versus 1.3 ± 0.42 density units (mean ± S.E.); p = 0.02; t test). Ratios of SRp30 in neutrophils versus PBMC for the six donors ranged from ∼1 (donor three) to 6.7 (donor four). To identify the specific SRp30 species present in human neutrophils, we utilized real-time PCR and specific Taqman probe sets for SRp30a, SRp30b, and SRp30c. Fig. 2 shows that only mRNAs encoding SRp30a and SRp30c were present in the neutrophils. Levels of SRp30c mRNA were ∼23-fold higher (p = 0.03, t test for paired samples) than levels of SRp30a. This suggests that SRp30c is probably the predominant SR protein present in human neutrophils.Fig. 2Real-time PCR shows that SRp30c mRNA is significantly higher in neutrophils from four normal individuals as compared with SRp30a and SRp30b. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. and analyzed by two-tailed paired t test.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) SR Protein Levels in Neutrophils Stimulated with IL-8 —We have demonstrated previously that IL-8 enhances GC insensitivity in neutrophils by increasing synthesis of GCRβ relative to GCRα (10Strickland I. Kisich K. Hauk P.J. Vottero A. Chrousos G.P. Klemm D.J. Leung D.Y. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 585-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Therefore, we performed Western analysis on extracts from neutrophils that had been treated with IL-8 as compared with unstimulated neutrophils (Fig. 3A). Freshly isolated neutrophils were treated with IL-8 or medium only for 2 h. 20 μg of nuclear extracts from neutrophils separated from four normal donors was separated on SDS-PAGE gels. After transferring to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and staining with specific anti-SR monoclonal antibody, the blots were developed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and chemiluminescence. Densitometry of the films revealed that SRp30 levels increased significantly in neutrophils treated with IL-8 as compared with neutrophils incubated in medium only (62 ± 14 density units versus 32 ± 10 density units; p = 0.04) (Fig. 3B). Therefore, conditions that result in increased GCRβ levels in neutrophils also result in increased levels of SRp30 proteins in neutrophils. PLB-985 Cell Differentiation—To obtain functional evidence of the identity of the GCR alternative splicing factor, we initially attempted to specifically inhibit SRp30a and SRp30c expressions in neutrophils using antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotides. However, due to the brief viability of these cells in culture, we were unable to obtain reproducible results. Therefore, we employed a model of neutrophil-like differentiation using the PLB-985 cell line (25Tucker K.A. Lilly M.B. Heck Jr., L. Rado T.A. Blood. 1987; 70: 372-378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells of this line are capable of granulocytic maturation to become neutrophil-like in the presence of inducing agents such as retinoic acid. After exposure to retinoic acid, the cells become neutrophil-like. Fig. 4 illustrates the morphology of PLB-985 cells after 5 days of exposure to retinoic acid. GCRα and GCRβ Levels in PLB-985 Cells before and after Neutrophilic Differentiation—To measure the dynamics of GCR expression upon differentiation of PLB 985 cells, we performed Western blot analysis of GCR from lysates of cells prior to and after 5 days of retinoic acid exposure. Fig. 5 revealed that GCRα and GCRβ levels both increased upon exposure to retinoic acid relative to undifferentiated PLB-985 cells. However, densitometry revealed that GCRβ levels (5.2 ± 2.4 density units on day 0 versus 143.2 ± 18.2 density units on day five, p = 0.01) increased much more than GCRα (1.82 ± 0.55 density units on day 0 versus 18.03 ± 4.05 density units on day five, p = 0.04). This suggests that both synthesis of GCR primary transcript and alternative splicing are increased upon exposure to retinoic acid, but the direction of alternative splicing increased toward GCRβ. SR Protein Levels in Undifferentiated and Differentiated PLB-985 Cells—To examine our hypothesis that enhanced alternative splicing of GCR pre-mRNA is associated with enhanced expression of SR proteins in the 30-kDa range, we performed Western analysis on cell extracts prior to and after 5 days of exposure to retinoic acid. Densitometry of the film shown in Fig. 6A shows that SRp30 levels significantly increased after differentiation relative to undifferentiated cells. Fig. 6B shows the density units of SRp30 from three experiments before and after differentiation (1.08 ± 0.25 density units versus 77.47 ± 19.30 density units, p = 0.02). Real-time PCR revealed that upon differentiation, PLB-985 cells expressed increased levels of SRp30a, SRp30b, and SRp30c. The expression amounts for SRp30a and SRp30c were much higher than those found in primary neutrophils at 4.3 × 10-5 pmol/ng of 18 S and 3.24 × 10-4 pmol/ng of 18 S, respectively, whereas mRNA for SRp30b was present at ∼1.2 × 10-5 pmol/ng of 18 S (data not shown). Expression of SRp30b was in contrast to data obtained from primary neutrophils, which did not express SRp30b. Inhibition of SRp30c via Antisense Phosphorothioate Oligonucleotides Inhibits Alternative Splicing of GCR pre-mRNA— To determine which of the three SRp30 proteins present in PLB-985 cells were necessary for alternative splicing of the GCR pre-mRNA to generate GCRβ, each SRp30 protein was specifically targeted with antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotides. Electroporation of fluorescein-tagged antisense oligonucleotides for SRp30a, SRp30b, or SRp30c was performed as described, and the cells were sorted for the fluorescein-positive population. The transfected cells were then returned to cultures and exposed to retinoic acid for up to 5 days. Nuclear extracts were then prepared and separated by SDS-PAGE for Western analysis of GCRβ protein levels (Fig. 7). Fig. 7A is a representative Western blot showing that GCRβ levels were inhibited for up to 48 h with antisense oligonucleotide for SRp30c after transfection relative to control oligonucleotide. Fig. 7B shows the density units of GCRβ from three experiments transfected with antisense oligonucleotide for SRp30a, SRp30b, SRp30c, and control oligonucleotide. GCRβ levels were significantly inhibited at 24 h after transfection with antisense oligonucleotide for SRp30c as compared with control oligonucleotide (19.43 ± 11.98 density units versus 153.1 ± 15.4 density units, p = 0.003). As shown in Fig. 8, GCRα was simultaneously elevated following treatment of the cells with anti-SRp30c relative to cells treated with control oligonucleotide. In the cells transfected with antisense oligonucleotides for SRp30a or SRp30b, there was no effect on GCRβ levels relative to control oligonucleotide or untreated cells.Fig. 8Expression of GCRα in differentiated PLB cells transfected with control oligonucleotide and antisense oligonucleotide for SRp30c. Proteins were extracted from day 0 (prior to differentiation), day 1, day 2, and day 3 after differentiation. SRp30c antisense oligonucleotide significantly stimulated the expression of GCRα relative to control oligonucleotide. A representative blot from three experiments is shown in A, and the mean ± S.E. of three experiments is shown in B. *, GCRα levels are significantly stimulated in cells following treatment with antisense oligonucleotide for SRp30c compared with control oligonucleotide. p < 0.01.

It is a multistep process including the accurate recognition of splice sites, excision of intronic sequences, and ligation of the resulting fragments back into a single molecule. All of these steps are performed by a multimolecular complex of proteins and RNA known as the spliceosome (20Staley J.P. Guthrie C. Cell. 1998; 92: 315-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). Recognition of the 5′ and 3′ splice sites by the spliceosome requires several small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles, including U1, U2, and U4/U6 and the non-small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle proteins including the family of serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins (27Guthrie C.

https://openalex.org/W2099226119,"We have identified a functional cAMP-response element (CRE) in the human brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene promoter III and established that it participated in the modulation of BDNF expression in NT2/N neurons via downstream signaling from the D1 class of dopamine (DA) receptors. The up-regulation of BDNF expression, in turn, produced neuroprotective signals through receptor tyrosine kinase B (TrkB) and promoted cell survival under the conditions of oxygen and glucose deprivation. To our knowledge this is the first evidence showing the presence of a functional CRE in the human BDNF gene and the role of DA signaling in establishing transcriptional competence of CRE in post-mitotic NT2/N neurons. This ability of DA to regulate the expression of the BDNF survival factor has a profound significance for the nigrostriatal pathway, because it indicates the existence of a feedback loop between the neutrophin, which promotes both the maturation and survival of dopaminergic neurons, and the neurotransmitter, which the mature neurons ultimately produce and release.

Its biological activity is mediated by tyrosine kinase receptor B (TrkB) and its downstream signaling (1Barbacid M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 766: 442-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The gene is highly expressed and widely distributed in the central nervous system, and it plays a significant role in the maintenance of function and survival of neurons (for review, see Ref. 2Murer M.G. Yan Q. Raisman-Vozari R. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 63: 71-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Evidence accumulated in recent years suggests that BDNF is also involved in the modulation of synaptic activity in the adult brain, producing long lasting changes in synaptic structure and function (for reviews, see Refs. 3Jankowsky J.L.

There is a growing interest in BDNF as a potential therapeutic agent for neurodegenerative diseases, because its deficiency was found in brains of both Alzheimer's and Parkinson's patients (6Phillips H.S.

Science. 1995; 267: 1658-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar, 12Messaoudi E. Bardsen K. Srebro B. Bramham C.R. J.

Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 1998; 27: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). However, more recent data indicate that BDNF can also induce behavioral sensitization by causing an overexpression of dopamine D3 receptors and could, actually, contribute to the amplification of pathophysiologies associated with conditions such as epilepsy, drug addiction, schizophrenia, and Parkinson's disease (15Binder D.K. Croll S.D. Gall C.M. Scharfman H.E. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 47-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 16Guillin O. Diaz J. Carroll P. Griffon N. Schwartz J.C. Sokoloff P. Nature. 2001; 411: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Clearly, further work is required to resolve some of these potential side-effects. In contrast to a large body of work on the temporal and spatial patterns of BDNF expression in neurodevelopment and neurodegeneration, relatively little is known about the transcriptional regulation of the human BDNF gene. This is partially due to the fact that the genomic structure of the human gene has not yet been fully elucidated. The gene was first localized to chromosome11p13 and predicted to consist of multiple exons (17Maisonpierre P.C. Le Beau M.M. Espinosa III, R. Ip N.Y. Belluscio L. de la Monte S.M. Squinto S. Furth M.E. Yancopoulos G.D. Genomics. 1991; 10: 558-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), but the existence of multiple transcripts, derived from different exons, was demonstrated only recently by Aoyama et al. (18Aoyama M. Asai K. Shishikura T. Kawamoto T. Miyachi T. Yokoi T. Togari H. Wada Y. Kato T. Nakagawara A. Cancer Lett. 2001; 164: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) in human neuroblastoma cells. A more detailed transcript mapping of an 810-kb region of chromosome 11p13-14 further defined its genomic localization, although no additional information on the actual structure of the gene itself was presented (19Guillemot F. Auffray C. Devignes M.D. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 7: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The existence of multiple human BDNF transcripts (18Aoyama M. Asai K. Shishikura T. Kawamoto T. Miyachi T. Yokoi T. Togari H. Wada Y. Kato T. Nakagawara A. Cancer Lett. 2001; 164: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) is consistent with a genomic structure similar to that of the rat gene, which consists of four short 5′ exons, each controlled by a distinct promoter, and one 3′ exon encoding the mature BDNF protein (20Timmusk T.

Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 21: 206-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In the rat, the four promoters direct expression of the BDNF gene in a tissue-specific manner, i.e. promoters I and II are active preferentially in neurons, whereas promoters III and IV are active both in neurons and in a limited number of non-neuronal tissues such as lung and heart (20Timmusk T.

Thus far, only a limited characterization of a 3.2-kb genomic fragment of the human gene containing some structural elements of a promoter was reported (22Shintani A. Ono Y. Kaisho Y. Igarashi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 182: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Recently, two transcription factors, CREB and a calcium-responsive factor, were identified as positive regulators of the rat promoter III (23Shieh P.B. Hu S.C. Bobb K. Timmusk T. Ghosh A.

Chem. 1999; 274: 1078-1084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is still not known whether the regulatory machinery controlling the rat BDNF gene is conserved in humans. Several studies indicate a direct involvement of neurotransmitters such as glutamate, GABA, acetylcholine, serotonin, and dopamine in the transcriptional regulation of the BDNF gene (27Lindholm D. Castren E. Berzaghi M. Blochl A. Thoenen H. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 1362-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 28Marty S. Berninger B. Carroll P. Thoenen H.

Neuroreport. 2001; 12: 1175-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) but the molecular components involved in this regulation have not yet been revealed. However, because DA exerts its effects through G protein-coupled transmembrane receptors, of which the D1-like class can stimulate adenylyl cyclase and increase production of cyclic AMP (cAMP) which, in turn, activates the downstream protein kinase A (PKA) signaling, it is possible that these events are involved in the transcriptional response of BDNF gene to DA via the transcription factor CREB. In this study, we have derived the genomic structure of human BDNF gene from the Human Genome by a direct sequence and structure comparison with the rat gene and proceeded to characterize the molecular mechanisms of its transcriptional activation in Ntera2/D1 teratocarcimona (NT2) cells. The NT2 cells can be differentiated into post-mitotic NT2/N neurons by a treatment with retinoic acid (32Andrews P.W. Dev. Biol. 1984; 103: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar, 33Pleasure S.J. Page C. Lee V.M. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 1802-1815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have established the presence of CRE-like element in promoter III of the gene and examined the role of DA signaling in its regulation. Recently, it has been established that NT2/N neurons express functional DA receptors of both D1-like and D2-like classes and are responsive to dopamine (34Zigova T. Barroso L.F. Willing A.E.

The cells were differentiated into post-mitotic neurons (NT2/N) by the procedure described by Pleasure et al. (33Pleasure S.J. Page C. Lee V.M. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 1802-1815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, the cells were treated for 4 weeks with 10 μm all-trans-retinoic acid (RA, Sigma Cell Culture) followed by replating, for an additional 3 weeks with DNA synthesis inhibitors (1 μm cytosine-β-d-arabinofuranoside and 10 μm 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine, Sigma). Mouse Neuro-2a (N2a) neuroblastoma cells (ATCC CCL-131) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FCS (Wisent Inc.) and used for transfections at density of 50% confluence. Experimental Treatments—Both undifferentiated and post-mitotic NT2/N neurons were treated with 0.2 mm Bt2cAMP for up to 3 h and harvested for RNA and protein extractions as described below. Stimulation of D1 class DA receptors with SKF-81297 agonist was performed as follows. The NT2/N neurons were placed in fresh medium 10–12 h prior to the treatment, and 20 μm SKF-81297 (freshly prepared) was then added to the cultures for periods of time up to 3 h. We have shown previously that this concentration of SKF-81297 was the most effective in increasing the intracellular cAMP level (36Sodja C. Fang H. Dasgupta T. Ribecco M. Walker P.R. Sikorska M. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2002; 99: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In some experiments 10 μm of the PKA inhibitor H-89 (from a 10 mm stock in Me2SO) was added together with 20 μm SKF-81297 for up to 3 h. The cells were subsequently harvested for the RNA extraction. The cells were also subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) according to the following protocol. Post-mitotic NT2/N neurons, cultured in 12-well plates, were pretreated for 30 min with either 0.2 mm Bt2cAMP, 10 μm DA, or 20 μm SKF-81297. Subsequently, the cells were washed once with glucose-free DME medium, placed in glucose-free DME supplemented with 10% FCS and containing the same concentrations of Bt2cAMP, DA, or SKF-81297, and were exposed to 2 h of OGD as described below. In some experiments 2 μg/ml anti-TrkB antibody was added to the cultures for 1.5 h prior to the addition of Bt2cAMP and the OGD treatment. The cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in a Gas Pak 100 chamber containing Gas Pak Plus gas generator envelopes (BD Biosciences). The generator envelopes catalytically reduce the oxygen concentration while providing a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Control cells were subjected to the same 2-h OGD period but without any pretreatments. Cell viability was assessed at the end of the OGD treatment (0 time) and after a 24-h recovery period under normoxic conditions. At the same time points the cells were also harvested for RNA and protein extractions. Cell Viability Assays—The 5-carboxyfluorescein diacetate (CFDA) assay was used as an indicator of live cells and Hoechst 33342 dye staining to identify the dead cells. For the CFDA assay the cells were washed with PBS and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with 5 μg/ml 5-CFDA, AM (Sigma) in Earle's balanced salt solution (Sigma). Fluorescence was quantified using a CytoFluor™ 2300/2350 fluorescence measurement system (Millipore, Bedford, MA) with an excitation filter at 480/20 nm and an emission filter at 530/25 nm. For the Hoechst staining assay the cells were rinsed off the flasks with medium and pelleted by centrifugation. The collected cells were fixed in suspension with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS buffer (0.13 m NaCl, 5 mm Na2HPO4, 1.6 mm KH2PO4). The cell suspensions were drawn through 26-gauge needles to disperse them and were stained with 0.2 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 dye in PBS. An aliquot of each sample was mounted on glass slides, and these were viewed on an Olympus BX50 fluorescence microscope with an Olympus ×40, numerical aperture 1.0, Planapo oil immersion objective. RNA Extraction, RT-PCR, and Real-time Quantitative PCR—RNA was extracted with TriReagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH) and was reverse-transcribed into single-stranded cDNA with 400 units of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Bethesda, MD) using 0.3 μg of random primers (Invitrogen) in a 40-μl reaction containing 2 μg of total RNA. The cDNA reaction mixtures were diluted 5-fold, and ∼3 μl of diluted cDNA was used for each PCR amplification. Each 25-μl PCR reactions contained 1× reaction buffer (Invitrogen), 2 μm of primers, 0.2 mm dNTP, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Invitrogen). PCR amplification for both CREB and BDNF was carried out for 25 cycles and for β-actin for 19 cycles, which were in the linear range of amplification. Each cycle consisted of the following steps: 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. Total RNA in the samples was normalized to the amount of β-actin. The PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on agarose gels. Ethidium bromide-stained gels were photographed using the Ultra.Lum gel documentation system (Claremont, CA) and quantified, when applied, using Scion image software (Frederick, MD). Real-time Q-PCR was performed with 10 ng of cDNA, purified on a QIAquick Spin column (Qiagen, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) and quantified with an Oligreen® single-stranded DNA quantitation reagent kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), using the ABI GeneAmp 5700 sequence detection system (ABI, Foster City, CA) and Quantitect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen). PCR primers were the same as those used for RT-PCR and are listed in Table I. Thermal cycling was initiated with a 2-min incubation at 50 °C, followed by a first denaturation step of 15 min at 95 °C and then 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s (denaturing) and 60 °C for 1 min (annealing and extension). The real-time PCR amplification data were collected continuously and analyzed with the Sequence Detection System (ABI, Foster City, CA). The copy number of target sequences in the tested samples was inversely proportional to and, hence, can be deduced from the C T (the thresh-hold cycle) level at which a significant increase in fluorescence signal was first detected. The amount of amplified products of the treated samples was normalized to the untreated controls and was calculated using the term, 2–ΔCT.Table IList of primers used for PCRGeneSequencePCR product sizea58.bpCREBF:5′-ACCGTAACTCTAGTACAGCTGC-3′192 (α)bα, CREBα isoform.R:5′-ACTGACTCCTGTGAATCTTCAC-3′150 (δ)cδ, CREBδ isoform.BDNF (exon V)F1:5′-ATTGGCTGGCGATTCATAAG-3′255R1:5′-GTTTCCCTTCTGGTCATGGA-3′BDNF (exons III + V)F2:5′-GAGTATTACCTCCGCCATGC-3′382R2:5′-ATTCACGCTCTCCAGAGTCC-3′β-ActinF:5′-TCCGGAGACGGGGTCACCCA-3′78R:5′-GTCCAGACGCAGCAGGATGGCAT-3′a 58.b α, CREBα isoform.c δ, CREBδ isoform. Open table in a new tab Preparation of Protein Extracts—Cells were trypsinized, collected by centrifugation, washed once with PBS, and lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3OVO4, and 1× Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). The lysates were vortexed, incubated for 15 min on ice, centrifuged at 13,000 rpm (IEC/MicroMax) for 20 min, and the supernatants (total cell lysates) were used for further analysis. To prepare nuclear protein extracts, cells were lysed in 2 mm KH2PO4/KOH buffer, pH 6.55, containing 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm EGTA 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm DTT, 0.3% Triton X-100, and 1× Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche Diagnostics). Nuclei were collected by centrifugation and washed once with the cell lysis buffer, and nuclear proteins were extracted with 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.9, containing 25% v/v glycerol, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, and 1× Protease Inhibitor Cocktail. Western Blotting—Protein extracts (50 μg/lane) were boiled in Laemmli/SDS sample buffer (2× buffer: 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue) for 5 min, separated by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-PAGE, and electrotransferred onto Hybond-C extra membranes (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). The membranes were first incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies diluted 1:1000 v/v in TBST (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, and 5% instant skim milk powder) and for an additional hour at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (dilution 1:5000 v/v in TBST). The antigen-antibody complexes were visualized using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). The following antibodies were used: affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a C terminus peptide of human CREB-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); anti-phospho-CREB (anti-p-CREB), an affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a synthetic phosphopeptide corresponding to residues 123–136 of rat CREB coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY); affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal anti-BDNF antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—A 19-bp probe corresponding to the CRE-like element (boldface letters) of the human BDNF promoter III was synthesized as complementary oligonucleotide strands (5′-GACAGCGCACGTCAAGGCA-3′, 5′-GGTGCCTTGACGTGCGCTGT-3′). Complementary oligonucleotides containing mutated CRE were also applied (5′-GACAGCCAGCTGCAAGGCA-3′, 5′-GGTGCCTTGCAGCTGGCTGT-3′). The strands were annealed and labeled with [32P]dCTP using a nucleotide fill-in method catalyzed by the Klenow enzyme (Amersham Biosciences). The protein binding assay was carried out in a 30-μl reaction mixture containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 5 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 30 or 60 ng of poly(dI-dC), 3 μg of bovine serum albumin, 6 μg of nuclear protein extract, and about 2 ng of 32P-labeled probe (50–60,000 cpm/assay). The mixture was incubated for 20 min at room temperature, and the reaction was stopped by an addition of 1/10 volume of 10× sample loading buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 40% glycerol, and 0.2% bromphenol blue). In the competition assays, an excess (50×) of unlabeled probe was added to the reaction mixture 30 min prior to the addition of the labeled oligonucleotides. In the antibody supershift assays, reaction mixtures were preincubated for 30 min at room temperature with 1 μl of rabbit polyclonal anti-CREB antibody (Rockland Inc., Gilbertsville, PA) or 1 μl of anti-ATF1 antibody (F1–1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) prior to the addition of the labeled probe. DNA-protein complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on a non-denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel run in 50 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, and 300 mm glycine running buffer (pH 8.6–8.7) and were visualized by autoradiography on Kodak BioMax MS film. Plasmid Constructs—Genomic DNA prepared from NT2 cells was used as PCR template to amplify the 548-bp fragment of human BDNF promoter III with a forward primer, 5′-TCGAGCTCTATACGTGTGTTTGCTG-3′, and a reverse primer, 5′-ATCTCGAGCCTTTTCAGTCACTACT-3′. The fragment was cloned into pGL3-Basic luciferase reporter vector (Promega, Madison, WI) between SacI and XhoI sites to generate plasmid pGL3-PIII. The CRE mutation (pGL3-PIII_CREm) was introduced into PIII using the in vitro site-directed mutagenesis system GeneEditor™ (Promega, Madison, WI) with a primer, 5′-TATCATATGACAGCGACCTGCAAGGCACCGTGGAGC-3′, in which the CRE site was mutated (underlining indicates CRE-site changes). Both pGL3-PIII and pGL3-PIII_CREm plasmids were sequenced to assure the correctness. Cell Transfection and Luciferase Activity Assay—Transient transfections were carried out on neuroblastoma N2a cells using Lipofect-AMINE™ 2000 (Invitrogen Canada, Inc., Burlington). The transfection efficiency of NT2 cells was too low to obtain any meaningful data. Briefly, cells growing in 6-well plates were co-transfected with 5 μg of pGL3 reporter plasmid and 2 μg of pSV-β-Gal (Promega) per well following the manufacturer's protocols. Two hours after transfection, cells were placed in serum-free DME, and 24 h later they were treated with 0.2 mm Bt2cAMP for 2 h. The cells were then washed twice with cold Ca2+/Mg2+-free PBS and lysed with 500 μl/well of Glo lysis buffer (1×) (Promega). One hundred microliters of cell lysate was used for Bright-Glo™ luciferase assay system (Promega). The luciferase activity was measured using a luminescence counter (1450 MicroBeta Trilux, Wallac). Thirty microliters of cell lysate was used for analysis with the β-Galactosidase Enzyme Assay System (Promega). The activity of β-galactosidase was detected by absorption at 420 nm using a spectrometer (Spectra Max 340, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Data Analysis—Data were analyzed and plotted using Jandel Sigmaplot 2000 software. Genomic Structure of Human BDNF—We used two web-based programs, BLAT and the Human Genome Browser (both written by Jim Kent, University of California at Santa Cruz), to deduce the entire structure of the human BDNF gene. The BLAT search was performed with rat sequences GI557909, GI557910, GI557911, and GI557912 corresponding to exons I–IV, respectively (21Nakayama M. Gahara Y. Kitamura T. Ohara O. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 21: 206-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The search identified four DNA sequences on human chromosome 11 in the working draft of the genome (April 1, 2001 freeze) that shared similarities with the rat exons. The Human Genome Browser tool identified several BDNF mRNAs (X91251, X60201, and M61176) encoded by the fifth exon of the gene and positioned the four human chromosome 11 sequences 5′ upstream of the coding region (Fig. 1A). Subsequently, we included human sequences GI 14090245, GI 14090247, GI 14090249, GI 14090251, and GI 14090253, reported to contain different elements of the human BDNF gene (18Aoyama M. Asai K.

Cancer Lett. 2001; 164: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) in the BLAT search and the sequence alignment. The alignment confirmed the existence of five distinct exons, corresponding to the rat exons I–V. It is possible that the gene contained an additional exon IVi, as suggested by Aoyama et al. (18Aoyama M. Asai K. Shishikura T. Kawamoto T. Miyachi T. Yokoi T. Togari H. Wada Y. Kato T. Nakagawara A. Cancer Lett. 2001; 164: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and its presence is also noted in Fig. 1B. The overall structure of the human gene was very similar to that of the rat, although the entire gene spanned more than 64 kb (Fig. 1B). Identification of a CRE-like Sequence in Promoter III of the Human Gene—It is well known that the expression of the rat BDNF gene is directed by four distinct promoters of which the activation of promoter III involves CRE and CaRE1 elements activated by the transcription factors CREB and calcium-responsive factor (20Timmusk T.

Kitamura T. Ohara O. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 21: 206-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) to search against the human genome (Human Genome browser, April 1, 2001 freeze) and identified the corresponding human promoter III sequence. The two sequences were further aligned using the ClustalW program (www2.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw). As shown in Fig. 2, the alignment revealed that the human promoter III contained a CRE-like sequence, 5′-GCACGTCA-3′, located upstream from the exon III transcription initiation site. This element differed from the rat CRE by one nucleotide, 5′-TCACGTCA-3′ (boldface letter), and from the palindromic CRE consensus sequence of by two nucleotides, 5′-TGACGTCA-3′ (boldface letters) (37Montminy M.R.

https://openalex.org/W2008317198,"LAD II/CDG IIc is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by a decreased expression of fucosylated antigens on cell surfaces that results in leukocyte adhesion deficiency and severe neurological and developmental abnormalities. Its molecular basis has been identified as a defect in the transporter of GDP-l-fucose into the Golgi lumen, which reduces the availability of the substrate for fucosyltransferases. During metabolic radiolabeling experiments using [3H]fucose, LAD II fibroblasts incorporated significantly less radiolabel compared with control cells. However, fractionation and analysis of the different classes of glycans indicated that the decrease in [3H]fucose incorporation is not generalized and is mainly confined to terminal fucosylation of N-linked oligosaccharides. In contrast, the total levels of protein O-fucosylation, including that observed in Notch protein, were unaffected. This finding demonstrates that the decrease in GDP-l-fucose levels in the fibroblast Golgi caused by the LAD II defect does not impair bulk protein O-fucosylation, but severely affects the bulk addition of fucose as a terminal modification of N-linked glycans. These data suggest that the severe clinical abnormalities including neurological and developmental ones observed in at least some of the LAD II patients may be related to alteration in recognition systems involving terminal fucose modifications of N-glycans and not be due to a defective O-fucosylation of proteins such as Notch.

Fucosylated structures expressed on cell surfaces or secreted in biological fluids are involved in a variety of functions related to cell-to-cell adhesion and recognition processes. Alterations in the production of fucosylated glycoconjugates have been observed in development and differentiation, and in pathological conditions as well, including inflammation and tumor progression (1Staudacher E.

Fucose is present in both N-linked and mucin-type O-linked glycoproteins, where it is linked to the oligosaccharide chains as a terminal modification that is not further elongated (7Fukuda M.

Serum proteins, involved in blood clotting or clot dissolution, such as human factor VII, factor XII, uPA (urokinase-type plasminogen activator) and tPA (tissue type plasminogen activator), are modified by O-fucose as a simple monosaccharide at a specific consensus sequence within their EGF repeats (11Kentzer E.J.

The Notch receptor plays an essential role in numerous stages of development (26Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (4918) Google Scholar), and recent work has demonstrated that O-fucose is essential for Notch signaling. Reduction or elimination of the enzyme responsible for addition of O-fucose to proteins, protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 (O-FucT-1), causes strong Notch-like phenotypes in both Drosophila (27Okajima T. Irvine K.D. Cell. 2002; 111: 893-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) and mice (28Shi S. Stanley P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5234-5239Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). In addition, the presence of an O-fucose glycan is essential in the Notch receptor system for the Fringe-mediated modulation of Notch activation in vivo in both Drosophila and mammalian cells (20Moloney D.J. Panin V.M. Johnston S.H. Chen J. Shao L. Wilson R. Wang Y. Stanley P. Irvine K.D. Haltiwanger R.S. Vogt T.F. Nature. 2000; 406: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar, 21Bruckner K. Perez L. Clausen H. Cohen S. Nature. 2000; 406: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). The fact that a defect in O-fucosylation of Notch results in embryonic lethality in mice raised the question of whether Notch is properly O-fucosylated in LAD II/CDGS IIc patients. Recent work by Hofsteenge and co-workers (10Hofsteenge J.H. Huwiler K.G. Macek B. Hess D. Lawler J. Mosher D.F. Peter-Katalinic J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6485-6498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 29Gonzalez De Peredo A. Klein D. Macek B. Hess D. Peter-Katalinic J. Hofsteenge J. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2002; 1: 11-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that several extracellular matrix glycoproteins, including thrombospondin-1, F-spondin and properdin, are modified with O-fucose at a consensus site within TSRs. In contrast to EGF repeats, the O-fucose on TSRs exists as either the monosaccharide Fuc-O-Ser/Thr or the disaccharide Glc-Fuc-O-Ser/Thr. A similar modification (Glc-β1,3Fuc) has also been observed in CHO cells, where it represents a quite abundant form of glycosylation (30Moloney D.J. Haltiwanger R.S. Glycobiology. 1999; 4: 679-687Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Although the function of the O-fucose on TSRs is not yet known, it occurs in a predicted cell interaction domain, suggesting that the modification may play a role in regulating cellular interactions with the extracellular matrix (31Adams J.C. Tucker R.P. Develop. Dynamics. 2000; 218: 280-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The importance of fucose in modulating glycan functions is well demonstrated by the human genetic disease LAD II/CDGS IIc, which is characterized by the absent or reduced expression of fucosylated glycoconjugates on cell surfaces, including blood group H and Lewis antigens (32Etzioni A. Frydman M. Pollack M.D. Avidor I. Phillips M.L. Paulson J.C. Gershoni-Baruch R. New Engl. J. Med. 1992; 327: 1789-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Patients affected by this syndrome present with severe mental and growth retardation, facial and skeletal abnormalities and immunodeficiency characterized by recurrent bacterial infections. This latter finding has been related to a reduced leukocyte rolling on endothelial cells mediated by the selectins, which are unable to recognize their oligosaccharide ligands, impairing leukocyte recruitment into the inflamed tissues. Conversely, the specific causes that lead to the severe neurological, developmental, and morphologic defects need still to be clarified. The molecular basis of LAD II/CDGS IIc syndrome has been found in a defect in GDP-l-fucose import into the Golgi system (33Lubke T. Marquardt T. von Figura K. Korner C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25986-25989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 34Lubke T. Marquardt T. Etzioni A. Hartmann E. von Figura K. Korner C. Nat.

Res. 2001; 49: 537-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The decreased GDP-l-fucose availability for the fucosyltransferases within the Golgi lumen explains the lower fucose content in glycoconiugates. However, the fact that some fucosylated antigens are undetectable (i.e. H antigen, selectin ligands), while LAD II cells incorporate low, but detectable levels of fucose into macromolecules, suggested that not all fucose-containing glycans are comparably decreased (36Sturla L. Puglielli L. Tonetti M. Berninsone P. Hirschberg C.B. De Flora A. Etzioni A. Pediatr. Res. 2001; 49: 537-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was the characterization of the residual fucose-containing glycoconjugates in cultured fibroblasts from a LAD II patient of Arab origin, in order to determine how the decreased availability of GDP-l-fucose inside the Golgi can affect their type and composition. Both terminal fucosylation of N-linked glycans and protein O-fucosylation are clearly involved in development and differentiation processes. Identification of the class of glycans that is most heavily affected in LAD II patients should provide clues to the role of these forms of fucosylation in the severe developmental defects observed in these patients. Cell Lines and Metabolic Labeling—Fibroblasts of one LAD II patient of Middle Eastern origin (35Etzioni A. Sturla L. Antonellis A. Green E.D. Gershoni-Baruch R. Berninsone P.M. Hirschberg C.B. Tonetti M. Am. J. Med. Genet. 2002; 110: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and of two unrelated, age-matched controls were derived from dermal biopsies, using standard procedures. Informed consent for the study was obtained from patient and control parents. Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640/10% fetal calf serum/2 mm glutamine (Invitrogen). No differences in morphology, adhesion, and growth kinetic were observed between patient and control cells. For all experiments, confluent fibroblasts were split 1:1 and used between 7 and 21 passages. Cells (80–90% confluent) were incubated for 18 h in the presence of 50 μm [3H]fucose (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Milan, Italy, 3.2 TBq/mmmol; final specific activity 7.5 MBq/mmmol). Incubation with [3H]glucosamine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, 814 GBq/mmol), used for control experiments, was performed under identical conditions, with only the radiolabeled molecule at 74 Bq/ml; in these conditions, a great proportion of the label should be distributed in glycans (37Yurchenco P.D. Ceccarini C. Atkinson P.H. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 50: 175-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), but it is possible that a portion of the radiolabel could also be incorporated in non-carbohydrate molecules. Tunicamycin Treatment—Cells were grown in triplicate in 6-well plates and labeled for 18 h, using 50 μm [3H]fucose, as described above. Tunicamycin (0.5 μg/ml, from Sigma) was added together with the radiolabeled fucose. No toxicity, determined by MTT (3-(4,5 dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay, was observed in these incubation conditions. Incorporation of the radiolabel in macromolecules was determined after PTA (phosphotungstic acid)/HCl precipitation, as previously described (36Sturla L. Puglielli L. Tonetti M. Berninsone P. Hirschberg C.B. De Flora A. Etzioni A. Pediatr. Res. 2001; 49: 537-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was analyzed by DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). Cell Fractionation—Monolayers of labeled fibroblasts were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested by trypsinization, and washed again twice, to completely remove unbound radioactivity. Cell pellets were then sequentially extracted at room temperature, using CHCl3/CH3OH, to eliminate the lipidic fraction, as the described procedure (38Manzi A.E. Norgard-Summicht K.E. Argade S. Marth J.D. van Halbeek H. Varki A. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 669-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Pellets containing the glycoproteins were then solubilized by heating for 20 min at 100 °C in 1% SDS. The following steps followed the described procedure (39Lin A.I. Philipsberg G.A. Haltiwanger R.S. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 895-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), with slight modifications. A Sephadex G-50 column (30 × 1 cm, mobile phase 50 mmNH4+ formate + 0.1% SDS + 0.02% NaN3) was used to remove small contaminant molecules. Protein-containing fractions (designed total glycoproteins), to be submitted to analysis of N- and O-linked glycans, were pooled together, and the volume was reduced by lyophilization. Aliquots (1.5 mg) of the total glycoproteins were withdrawn in triplicate for fucose analysis. The remaining glycoproteins were then precipitated using 8 volumes of acetone at –20 °C for 18 h. The precipitates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min, and the resulting pellets were resuspended in 0.5 ml of 1% SDS, to be used for glycan fractionation. Determination of Total Fucose and [3H]Fucose-specific Activity in Total Glycoproteins—The aliquots of total glycoproteins set apart in triplicate before acetone precipitation (see above) were used for the determination of total bound fucose content by HPAEC-PAD analysis. Proteins were acetone-precipitated in 1.5-ml screw tubes as described above, and the resulting pellets were directly hydrolyzed in 0.2 ml of 2 m trifluoroacetic acid at 100 °C for 4 h. Samples were then dried in a SpeedVac (Savant) and passed over a 0.5 ml Dowex 50 (proton form) column to remove amino acids and peptides. Samples were then dried again and further purified through a Zip Tip (C18) (Millipore) to remove any residual peptide contaminants. Samples were then subjected to HPAEC-PAD analysis, which was performed on a Dionex DX300 equipped with a pulsed amperometric detector (Dionex Corp., Sunnyvale, CA) using a Dionex PA-1 column under standard conditions for monosaccharide analysis (40Hardy M.R. Townsend R.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 208-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Fractions (0.25 min) were collected and radioactivity eluting in correspondence to fucose was determined by scintillation counting. The ratio between cpm and fucose pmol was used to calculate [3H]fucose-specific activity. Release of N- and O-Linked Glycans from Total Glycoproteins—The solubilized proteins (6 mg) were treated with PNGase F (Roche Applied Science) as described (30Moloney D.J. Haltiwanger R.S. Glycobiology. 1999; 4: 679-687Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 39Lin A.I. Philipsberg G.A. Haltiwanger R.S. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 895-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The released oligosaccharides were then separated from PNGase F-resistant glycoproteins on a Sephadex G-50 column as described above. Fractions (1.0 ml) were collected, and aliquots were analyzed by scintillation counting. The PNGase F-resistant fractions were pooled, concentrated by lyophilization, and precipitated with acetone. The residual glycoproteins were then subjected to alkali-induced β-elimination to obtain O-glycan release (39Lin A.I. Philipsberg G.A. Haltiwanger R.S. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 895-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The released oligosaccharides were then subjected again to a Sephadex G-50 column and 1.0 ml fractions were collected for further analysis. Fractions corresponding to small oligosaccharides and monosaccharides were pooled and SDS was removed by KCl precipitation. Samples were then desalted on a Dowex 50 column, lyophilized, and residual boric acid was removed by repeated evaporation in the presence of methanol. The samples were then chromatographed on a Superdex peptide column, using water (0.5 ml/min) as mobile phase. Fractions (0.5 min) were collected and analyzed by scintillation counting. Individual peaks (monosaccharide and disaccharide) were analyzed by HPAEC analysis on an MA-1 column as described (40Hardy M.R. Townsend R.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 208-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Radioactivity in the eluted fractions was determined by scintillation counting and the retention time compared with that observed for unlabeled standards (Fucitol, Glcβ1,2Fucitol, Glcβ1,3Fucitol, Glcβ1,4Fucitol. Disaccharides generously provided by Dr. Khushi Matta, Roswell Park Cancer Center, Buffalo, NY). Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation of Notch1 Protein—Fibroblasts from LAD II patient and two controls were seeded into 10 cm-diameter culture dishes and were incubated for 24 h in the presence of [3H]fucose. Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting experiments were performed as described (18Moloney D.J. Shair L.H. Lu F.M. Xia J. Locke R. Matta K.L. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9604-96011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Briefly, after labeling cells were washed three times with cold Tris-buffered saline and lysed with the same buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitors. The lysate was incubated overnight with Notch1-specific rabbit polyclonal Na antibody (41Lu F.M. Lux S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8049-8057Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitated protein, untreated and treated with PNGase for 24 h (18Moloney D.J. Shair L.H. Lu F.M. Xia J. Locke R. Matta K.L. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9604-96011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), was analyzed by SDS-PAGE on a 4–12% gradient gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was analyzed by digital autoradiography using a Beta-imager 2000 instrument (Biospace, Paris, France). The radioactivity associated with individual proteins was determined with the specific Beta-Vision software provided by Biospace. Notch1 presence in fibroblasts lysates before and after immunoprecipitation was analyzed by Western blotting experiments using Na antibody. The lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis on a 7.5% gel and, after separation, the proteins were transferred onto a PVDF membrane. Detection was performed with the ECL Plus detection system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. LAD II Fibroblasts Incorporate Significantly Less [3H]Fucose into N-Glycans than Control Fibroblasts—To initially assess the consequences of a reduced uptake of GDP-l-fucose into the Golgi apparatus on fucosylated glycan composition in fibroblasts, cells were metabolically labeled with 50 μm [3H]fucose. As expected, uptake of [3H]fucose was significantly reduced in LAD II samples compared with controls (Fig. 1A). Tunicamycin treatment was able to reduce [3H]fucose incorporation in macromolecules. However, this tunicamycin-induced decrease of label uptake in glycoproteins was not comparable between the two samples, the LAD II cells being less affected than controls (Fig. 1A). No differences between LAD II and control cells were observed after labeling with [3H]glucosamine, either alone or in the presence of tunicamycin (Fig. 1B). These data suggested as a first approximation that the decrease in fucose incorporation in LAD II cells is not equally distributed in all glycan classes, but involves mainly the N-linked oligosaccharides, and it is not accompanied by a general alteration in glycoconjugate composition. To test this hypothesis, cells were incubated in the presence of [3H]fucose and subjected to fractionation, in order to isolate and analyze N- and O-linked glycans. Aliquots of the recovered total glycoproteins were then used to determine radioactivity incorporated in glycoproteins (Fig. 2A) or subjected to hydrolysis followed by HPAEC-PAD analysis to determine total amount of bound fucose (Fig. 2B) and fucose-specific activity (Fig. 2C). As already observed for tunicamycin experiments, total radioactivity and the amount of fucose incorporated in macromolecules were decreased in LAD II samples (Fig. 2, A and B). [3H]Fucose final specific activity, determined by HPAEC-PAD analysis after acid hydrolysis of total glycoproteins, was slightly different between control and LAD II (Fig. 2C), possibly due to a different contribution of the salvage pathway to the cytosolic GDP-l-fucose pool in the two samples. The specific activity of [3H]fucose on total glycoproteins was then used to estimate the picomoles of total fucose bound to glycoproteins and in the different glycan fractions. The profiles of elution from G-50 column of [3H]fucose-labeled total glycoproteins after PNGase F treatment to release N-linked oligosaccharides are reported in Fig. 3A. Radioactivity eluting in correspondence to the oligosaccharide peak was highly decreased in LAD II samples, while the PNGase-resistant fraction was comparable between LAD II and controls (Fig. 3A). No differences in the elution profile were observed between LAD II and controls when [3H]glucosamine was used as label (Fig. 3B). This strongly suggests that the reduction observed is specific for fucose, and it is not accompanied by significant differences in N-glycan composition. Fucose content, estimated using [3H]fucose-specific activity in the pooled fractions containing the N-linked oligosaccharides, was markedly reduced in LAD II cells, while the amount of protein-bound, PNGase-resistant fucose was less affected in patient samples (Fig. 3C). This finding was in accord with the previous data obtained with tunicamycin. LAD II and Control Fibroblasts Contain Similar Levels of O-Fucose Saccharides—Labeled proteins recovered from G-50 column were then subjected to alkali-induced β-elimination in the presence of NaBH4, in order to release O-linked oligosaccharides and, possibly, residual PNGase F-resistant N-linked oligosaccharides, and analyzed again with a Sephadex G-50 column. [3H]fucose-labeled material eluted in three main peaks, corresponding to residual proteins resistant to β-elimination, high/medium molecular weight oligosaccharides and small molecular weight oligosaccharides/monosaccharides, respectively (Fig. 4A). While a marked decrease of radioactivity was observed for the first two eluting peaks in LAD II, the peak corresponding to the small oligosaccharides and monosaccharides was comparable between LAD II and controls. Again, no differences between controls and LAD II were observed in [3H]glucosamine labeled samples (Fig. 4B). When the amount of fucose was estimated by using [3H]fucose-specific activity, it revealed an increase in the amount of fucosylated material corresponding to small oligosaccharides/monosaccharides from LAD II samples compared with control samples (Fig. 4C). To characterize the size and composition of the third peak, which is hypothesized to contain O-fucosylated species, the corresponding fractions were pooled and subjected to gel filtration analysis on a Superdex column. The profile of elution was comparable between controls and LAD II and showed two species, corresponding to disaccharides and to monosaccharides, respectively (Fig. 5, A and B). HPAEC analysis of the monosaccharide indicated the presence of fucitol, which is formed when O-fucose monosaccharide is released by β-elimination followed by NaBH4 reduction of the aldehyde group (not shown). HPAEC profiles from the fractions containing the disaccharide form are reported in Fig. 5, C and D and show that the disaccharide corresponds to Glc-β1,3-fucitol for both control and LAD II samples. O-Fucosylation of Notch1 Appears to Be Similar in LAD II and Control Fibroblasts—To specifically investigate whether O-fucosylation on the EGF repeats of Notch is affected in LAD II, fibroblasts were metabolically labeled with [3H]fucose and Notch was immunoprecipitated using the Na antibody (41Lu F.M. Lux S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8049-8057Google Scholar). The expression of Notch1 in lysates of control and LAD II fibroblasts was verified by Western blot experiments. A band migrating at ∼110 kDa was detected (Fig. 6A), consistent with the mass of the transmembrane/intracellular domain of Notch protein (42Blaumueller C.M. Qi H.L. Zagouras P. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Cell. 1997; 90: 281-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar), which is recognized by Na antibody (18Moloney D.J. Shair L.H. Lu F.M. Xia J. Locke R. Matta K.L.

https://openalex.org/W2032240991,"The MMP-11 proteinase, also known as stromelysin-3, probably plays an important role in human cancer because MMP-11 is frequently overexpressed in human tumors and MMP-11 levels affect tumorogenesis in mice. Unlike other MMPs, however, human MMP-11 does not cleave extracellular matrix proteins, such as collagen, laminin, fibronectin, and elastin. To help identify physiologic MMP-11 substrates, a phage display library was used to find peptide substrates for MMP-11. One class of peptides containing 26 members had the consensus sequence A(A/Q)(N/A)↓(L/Y)(T/V/M/R)(R/K), where ↓ denotes the cleavage site. This consensus sequence was similar to that for other MMPs, which also cleave peptides containing Ala in position 3, Ala in position 1, and Leu/Tyr in position 1′, but differed from most other MMP substrates in that proline was rarely found in position 3 and Asn was frequently found in position 1. A second class of peptides containing four members had the consensus sequence G(G/A)E↓LR. Although other MMPs also cleave peptides with these residues, other MMPs prefer proline at position 3 in this sequence. In vitro assays with MMP-11 and representative peptides from both classes yielded modest k cat/K m values relative to values found for other MMPs with their preferred peptide substrates. These reactions also showed that peptides with proline in position 3 were poor substrates for MMP-11. A structural basis for the lower k cat/K m values of human MMP-11, relative to other MMPs, and poor cleavage of position 3 proline substrates by MMP-11 is provided. Taken together, these findings explain why MMP-11 does not cleave most other MMP substrates and predict that MMP-11 has unique substrates that may contribute to human cancer.

MMP-11, also known as stromelysin-3, is one of more than 20 matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) 1The abbreviations used are: MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography.1The abbreviations used are: MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. (reviewed in Ref. 1Woessner J. Nagase H. Matrix Metalloproteinases and TIMPs. 1st ed. Oxford University Press, New York2000Google Scholar). The MMP-11 gene was originally identified by screening a breast cancer cDNA library for genes that were expressed at higher levels in invasive carcinomas than in breast fibroadenomas (2Basset P. Bellocq J. Wolf C. Stoll I. Hutin P. Limacher J. Podhajcer O. Chenard M. Rio M. Chambon P. Nature. 1990; 348: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). Additional work has shown that MMP-11 is usually overexpressed in many human carcinomas, including breast, non-small cell lung, and colorectal carcinomas, but is rarely expressed in normal tissue, including the normal tissue surrounding the tumor (3Rouyer N. Wolf C. Chenard M. Rio M. Chambon P. Bellocq J. Basset P. Inv. Metastasis. 1994; 14: 269-275PubMed Google Scholar, 4Kossakowska A. Huchcroft S. Urbanski S. Edwards D. Br. J.

In fact, adults only express MMP-11 in tumors and regenerating or healing tissues (reviewed in Ref. 6Basset P. Bellocq J. Lefebvre O. Noel A. Chenard M. Wolf C. Anglard P. Rio M. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hemotol. 1997; 26: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Furthermore, MMP-11 expression correlated with a shorter recurrence-free survival for breast cancer patients, providing further support for an important role for MMP-11 in breast cancer (5Tetu B. Brisson J. Lapointe H. Bernard P. Hum. Pathol. 1998; 29: 979-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 7Chenard M. O'Siorain L. Shering S. Rouyer N. Lutz Y. Wolf C. Baset P. Bellocq J. Duffy M.

Pathol. 1998; 152: 721-728PubMed Google Scholar).Experiments with mice or fibroblasts lacking MMP-11 also suggest that MMP-11 plays an important role in human cancer. First, mice lacking MMP-11 have a reduced incidence and size of tumors induced by 7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene compared with mice with a functional MMP-11 (9Masson R. Lefebvere O. Noel A. El Fahime M. Chenard M. Wendling C. Kebers F. Le Meur M. Dierich A. Foidart J. Basset P. Rio M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1535-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Second, MMP-11 null fibroblasts, unlike wild type fibroblasts, do not stimulate the implantation rate of MCF7 xenografts in nude mice (9Masson R. Lefebvere O. Noel A. El Fahime M. Chenard M. Wendling C. Kebers F. Le Meur M. Dierich A. Foidart J. Basset P. Rio M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1535-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Third, syngenic tumor cells had a higher rate of apoptosis when injected into MMP-11 null mice compared with wild type mice (10Boulay A. Masson R. Chenard M. El Fahime M. Cassard L. Bellocq G. Sautes-Fridman C. Basset P. Rio M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2189-2193PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, the frequent overexpression of MMP-11 in human tumors and the effect of MMP-11 levels on tumor formation in mice both suggest that MMP-11 plays an important role in human cancer.Relatively little is known about the physiologic substrates for MMP-11. In particular, human MMP-11, unlike most MMPs, does not readily cleave extracellular matrix components, such as collagen, laminin, fibronectin, or elastin (11Pei D. Majmudar G. Weiss S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25849-25855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Noel A. Santavicca M. Stoll I. L'Hoir C. Staub A. Murphy G. Rio M. Basset P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22866-22872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In vitro studies showed, however, that MMP-11 cleaves α1-proteinase inhibitor, α2-macroglobulin, and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1, although the physiologic significance of these reactions is unknown (11Pei D. Majmudar G. Weiss S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25849-25855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Manes S. Mira E. Barbacid M. Cipres A. Fernandez-Resa P. Buesa J. Merida I. Aracil M. Marquez G. Martinez C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25706-25712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). More importantly, recent experiments showed that MMP-11 mutants without proteolytic activity did not stimulate the implantation of MCF7 cells into nude mice (14Noel A. Boulay A. Kebers F. Kannan R. Hajitou A. Calberg-Bacq C. Basset P. Rio M. Foidart J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These studies strongly suggest that MMP-11 has proteolytic activity that is important for its role in cancer.In addition to the poor cleavage of extracellular matrix components, human MMP-11 differs from other MMPs in that it contains alanine at residue 235, whereas mouse MMP-11 and other MMPs contain proline at the corresponding residue (12Noel A. Santavicca M. Stoll I. L'Hoir C. Staub A. Murphy G. Rio M. Basset P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22866-22872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This alanine residue affects catalytic activity because the human protein MMP-11-A235P, but not MMP-11, readily cleaved laminin and type IV collagen. In fact, human MMP-11-A235P had activity similar to that of mouse MMP-11. It is unclear whether the alanine 235 to proline mutation in human MMP-11 affects catalytic activity, substrate dependence, or both.In this study, we used phage display libraries to select peptide substrates for human MMP-11. Preferred sequences for MMP-11 cleavage could identify physiologic substrates for MMP-11. Such substrates would be interesting because they are likely to be important for human cancer.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of Phage Display Library—A phage display library was constructed containing a random hexamer peptide sequence expressed between a hexahistidine tag and the mature gene III protein of M13. To construct this library, the following two oligonucleotides were annealed, elongated with the Klenow fragment in the presence of nucleotide triphosphates, and then digested with KpnI and BamHI (first and second underlined segments, respectively): 5′-gttcggtacctttctattctcactccgctcaccatcaccaccatcacggtgtggtagtggtggtagtgccaccgnnsnnsnnsnnsnnsnnsccgccgcctaggtgtag-5′, where n indicates equimolar a, t, c and g and s indicates equimolar c and g. The digested DNA fragment was then ligated with the vector M13PL9, which was similarly digested with KpnI and BamHI, and the ligation mixture was transformed into Escherichia coli strain K91 (thi/HfrC) yielding 4.4 × 108 independent transformants. The resulting phage mixture was amplified in K91 cells and concentrated by polyethyleneglycol precipitation to yield 4.7 × 1013 plaque-forming units/ml. The resulting phage expressed a protein containing: gene III leader sequence-Ala-His6-Gly2-Xaa6-Gly2-gene III mature protein.Construction of Control Phage Clones—Positive and negative control phage clones were constructed to help develop methods for library screening. A positive control phage was constructed with oligonucleotides that expressed the hexapeptide PLG↓LYA because this sequence is known to be a substrate for MMP-14. Two clones containing the hexapeptides MTQMIS or TALSPQ were isolated from the library that were not cleaved by MMP-14.Expression Vectors for MMP-14 and MMP-11—Fragments of human MMP-14 and MMP-11 that encoded the catalytic domains were inserted into vectors for expression in E. coli. For MMP-11, a DNA fragment encoding residues 98–272 was amplified by PCR from IMAGE clone 2425546 (Research Genetics, Birmingham, AL) with a 5′ oligonucleotide that contained NdeI and a 3′ oligonucleotide that contained BglII. The amplified DNA fragment was digested with NdeI and BglII and then ligated with pET3b (Novagen, Madison, WI) that was digested with NdeI and BglII. MMP-11 mutants with increased activity, MMP-11-A235P, or decreased activity, MMP-11-E216A, were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. DNA sequencing confirmed the authenticity of the preceding plasmids. For MMP-14, a vector that directed the expression of MMP-11 residues 111–298 was created as previously described (15Kannan R. Ruff M. Kochins J. Manly S. Stoll I. El Fahime M. Noel A. Foidart J. Rio M. Dive V. Basset P. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 16: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).Purification of MMP-14 and MMP-11 Catalytic Protein Fragments— Plasmids that expressed the catalytic regions of MMP-11 or MMP-14 were transformed into BL21pLysS (Novagen). Recombinant proteins were induced and purified based on published methods (15Kannan R. Ruff M. Kochins J. Manly S. Stoll I. El Fahime M. Noel A. Foidart J. Rio M. Dive V. Basset P. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 16: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, inclusion bodies were purified from E. coli that were induced to express the desired recombinant protein for 3 h at 37 °C. The purified inclusion bodies were dissolved in buffer with 8 m urea, diluted, and dialyzed against buffer with decreasing amounts of urea to facilitate refolding. Insoluble protein was then removed by centrifugation, and the resulting proteins were stored at –80 °C. The identity of the MMP-11 was confirmed by Western blotting with antibody SL305 (Oncogene Sci.). The concentration of the soluble protein was determined by comparison with bovine serum albumin following Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-poly-acrylamide gels.Screening the Phage Display Library with MMP-14, MMP-11, or MMP-11-A235P—0.1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing ∼109 phage was added to each well of a 96-well Reacti-Bind Metal Chelate Plate (Pierce), and the resulting plate was shaken gently overnight at room temperature. Unbound phage were removed by washing six times with 0.2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20. This procedure yielded ∼2–5% of the input phage bound to the plate based on titering phage that were eluted from the plate with 0.1 ml of 0.02 m EDTA for 10 min. To enrich for MMP-14 substrates, the bound phage were digested in 0.1 ml of 50 mm Hepes, 10 mm CaCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Brij 30, 10 nm MMP-14 (pH 7.5) for 6 h at 37 °C with gentle shaking. The resulting supernatants were then collected and amplified, and the enrichment cycle was repeated as above. Individual phage were cloned and analyzed as described under “Results.” Likewise, bound phage were digested in 0.1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 100 mm NaCl (pH 7.5) with either 500 nm MMP-11 or 180 nm MMP-11-A235P for 6 h at 37 °C with gentle shaking to enrich for MMP-11 and MMP-11-A355P substrates. The resulting supernatants were then collected and amplified, and the enrichment cycle was repeated three more times. Individual phage were cloned, amplified, and analyzed as described under “Results.” In some cases, the amount of phage released from the nickel plate was quantified by titering the reaction supernatant and/or phage eluted from the plate after a 10-min treatment with 0.1 ml of 0.02 m EDTA.Enzyme Assays with Peptides—2 ml of recombinant enzyme were dialyzed twice against 1 liter of 50 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 1 μm ZnCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol (pH 7.6) (reaction buffer plus β-mercaptoethanol) to remove amines that would react with fluorescamine. Peptides (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL) were dissolved in Me2SO at 10 mm. The peptide at concentrations ranging from 0.016 to 1 mm was diluted into reaction buffer for a final volume of 0.1 ml and equilibrated to 37 °C. Enzyme at concentrations from 1 to 65 nm was then added, and the reaction was continued for 1–20 h. To quantify the extent of hydrolysis, 0.05 ml of 200 mm potassium borate (pH 10.0) was added followed by 0.05 ml of 1 mg/ml fluorescamine in acetonitrile and gentle mixing. The fluorescent signal generated by the reaction of the fluorescamine with the primary amines created by enzymatic digestion of the peptides was measured using a plate reader with excitation and emission wavelengths of 390 and 490 nm, respectively. The molar amount of fluorescamine-peptide conjugate was determined using standards prepared from fluorescamine. These values were then used to calculate the amount of product formed (16Bantan-Polak T. Kassai M. Grant K. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 297: 128-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). k cat/K m was calculated from nonlinear regression analysis of Michaelis-Menten plots using Enzyme Kinetics software (Trinity Software).As indicated under “Results,” the digestion of some peptides was also monitored using reversed-phase HPLC separation. In these cases, the reaction was stopped with 10 mm EDTA, and the reaction products were separated using a C18 reversed-phase HPLC column and acetonitrile gradient. The peptide fragments were detected by their absorbance at 210 nm. The results obtained by the HPLC method were in excellent agreement with the results obtained with the fluorescamine method. Finally, analysis of the digestion of peptides MA15 and MA18 with either the wild type or the A235P mutant MMP11 was performed using a Waters Micromass ZQ mass spectrometer interfaced with a Shimadzu HPLC. Analysis was performed using either acetonitrile, water, 0.1 mm ammonium acetate or methanol, water, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid gradients as mobile phase on a C18 reversed-phase HPLC column using electrospray ionization(+/–) ionization.Gel-based Activity Assay for MMP-11 Cleavage of α1-Proteinase Inhibitor—MMP-11 α1-antitrypsin inhibitor cleavage activity was measured by incubating 5 μgof α1-proteinase inhibitor (Calbiochem 178251) in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 1 μm ZnCl2, 26 mm MMP-11 or MMP-11-A235P in a total volume of 0.05 ml at 37 °C for the indicated times. The reactions were stopped by adding 10 μl of 3 m β-mercaptoethanol, 10% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 25% glycerol. The reaction products (15 μl) were separated using an 18% Tris-HCl gel (Bio-Rad) and visualized with Coomassie Blue.RESULTSIdentification of MMP-14 Substrates Using Phage Display—A phage display library was constructed to identify peptide substrates for proteases. In this system, each phage expresses five copies of a hexahistidine peptide followed by a random hexapeptide on its surface. Proteolytic digestion within the hexapeptide removes the hexahistidine tag, thereby allowing separation of phage where the hexapeptide was cleaved from phage that were uncleaved.A screen for MMP-14 substrates was used to test this phage display system. A phage clone that contained a hexapeptide that was cleaved by MMP-14, PLG↓LYA, and two clones with hexapeptides that were not cleaved by MMP-14, MTQMIS and TALSPQ, were first used to develop methods for library screening. Based on these studies, conditions were identified where ∼75% of the positive control phage were released from the nickel plate, whereas less than 2% of the negative control phage were released from the nickel plate (see “Experimental Procedures” for details.) Using these conditions, two rounds of enrichment were performed with MMP-14. 52 random phage clones from this enriched pool were then individually digested with MMP-14 or buffer controls, and the fraction of the phage released by MMP-14 was determined. This analysis showed that 31 of 52 clones were released from nickel plates at levels equal to or greater than the level for the positive control phage. Some of these release rates are quantified in Table I. DNA from these 31 phage were sequenced, and the predicted hexapeptides were aligned (Table I). Based on this alignment, a consensus sequence of PL(G/P/A)↓L(R/M) was obtained (Table II). The individual peptide sequences and the consensus sequence were in excellent agreement with preceding identification of MMP-14 substrates using phage display and peptide methods (17Ohkubo S.

Hence, our studies substantiate the conclusions of other investigators and validate our phage display method for identifying peptide substrates.Table IPredicted peptide sequences selected by MMP-14 digestionPhage cloneaPhage clones isolated from screens using MMP-14.

Open table in a new tab Identification of MMP-11 Substrates Using Phage Display—A fragment of human MMP-11 containing residues 98–272 was expressed in E. coli. Two MMP-11 mutants were also expressed in E. coli to aid in the identification of MMP-11 substrates. One mutant, MMP-11-E216A, altered a residue required for catalytic function (14Noel A. Boulay A. Kebers F. Kannan R. Hajitou A. Calberg-Bacq C. Basset P. Rio M. Foidart J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), whereas a second mutant, MMP-11-A235P, had increased activity for cleavage of α1-proteinase inhibitor (12Noel A. Santavicca M. Stoll I. L'Hoir C. Staub A. Murphy G. Rio M. Basset P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22866-22872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). This analysis showed that both MMP-11 and MMP-11-A235P cleaved α1-proteinase inhibitor, yielding the expected products. Furthermore, MMP-11-A235P was about 10-fold more active than MMP-11, consistent with previous results (12Noel A. Santavicca M. Stoll I. L'Hoir C. Staub A. Murphy G. Rio M. Basset P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22866-22872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained using either β-casein, α2-macroglobulin, or insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 as a substrate (data not shown). The cleavage of α1-proteinase inhibitor was inhibited by AG3340, a broad spectrum MMP inhibitor (20Shalinsky D. Brekken J. Zou H. McDermott C. Forsyth P. Edwards D. Margosiak S. Bender S. Truitt G. Wood A. Varki N. Appelt K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 878: 236-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), with an IC50 of ∼6 nm (Fig. 1B). As previously described (14Noel A. Boulay A. Kebers F. Kannan R. Hajitou A. Calberg-Bacq C. Basset P. Rio M. Foidart J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), the active site mutant MMP-11-E216P was inactive in all of the assays tested (data not shown). Taken together, these findings are consistent with earlier findings and validate our MMP-11 preparations.MMP-11 and MMP-11-A235P were then used to enrich the phage display library for substrates. Unfortunately, neither the positive control phage clone for MMP-14 (PLG↓LYA) nor any of the phage clones selected with MMP-14 were good substrates for MMP-11 or MMP-11-A235P. In the absence of phage substrates to establish conditions for screening, enrichment conditions were chosen based on the published activity of MMP-11 and MMP-11-A235P (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Using these conditions, ∼25-fold more phage were released from the pool of phage that had undergone four rounds of enrichment than from the nascent phage library. 60 phage from both the MMP-11 and MMP-11-A235P enrichments were then individually cloned and tested for release from nickel plates by MMP-11, MMP11-A235P, or buffer controls. This analysis showed that 7 of 60 phage clones from the MMP-11 enrichment and 34 of 60 phage clones from the MMP-11-A235P enrichment were released from nickel plates at 100-fold or higher levels than the negative control clones. This analysis also showed that all phage released by MMP-11 could be released by MMP-11-A235P and vice versa. An additional test was performed to ensure that phage clones were released by MMP-11 instead of potentially contaminating E. coli proteases. Putative MMP-11 or MMP-11-A235 substrate phage were first digested with MMP-11-A235P either in the presence or absence of 0.1 μm AG3340, a broad spectrum MMP inhibitor. This analysis showed that the release of 32 of 41 phage clones selected with either MMP-11 or MMP-11-A235P was inhibited 95% or more by AG3340. DNA from these 32 phage clones were then sequenced, and the predicted hexapeptides were aligned (Table III). Three groups of peptide substrates for MMP11 were readily identifiable. Based on this alignment, the four clones from Group B had hexapeptides that shared the sequence G(G/A)E↓LR, whereas two clones had hexapeptide sequences that were represented by neither Group A nor Group B. The majority of peptides belong to Group A. Separate analysis of these 26 peptides belonging to Group A indicated that the hexapeptides were well represented by the consensus sequence A(A/Q)(N/A)↓(L/Y)(T/V/M/R)(R/K) (Table IV). As a final test that these phage were released by MMP-11, 13 phage clones were treated with either MMP-11 or MMP-11-E216A. This analysis showed that at least 100-fold more phage were released with MMP-11 than with MMP-11-E216A. Hence, this phage screen isolated two classes of hexapeptides and two unique hexapeptides outside these classes that were specifically released from nickel plates by both MMP-11 and MMP-11-A235P but not by MMP-11-E216A.Table IIIPredicted peptide sequences selected by MMP-11 digestionPhage cloneaPhage clones selected with MMP-11 or MMP-11A235P are designated as 11-x or 11AP-x, respectively.

Open table in a new tab Determination of Kinetic Parameters for MMP-11 Substrate Peptides—Several peptides were synthesized based on the hexapeptide sequences identified by phage display so that kinetic parameters could be determined and compared with known substrates. In particular, decapeptides were synthesized where the hexapeptide sequences identified by phage display were flanked by a pair of glycine residues at both the N and C termini as in the phage. The N terminus was blocked with an acetyl group to eliminate primary amines in the peptides. The peptides were then incubated with either MMP-14, MMP-11, MMP-11-A235P, or MMP11-E216A, and the extent of cleavage was determined using fluorescamine, which reacted with the primary amines created by peptide cleavage to generate fluorescent conjugates. Nonlinear regression analysis of Michaelis-Menten plots was used to determine K m and V max that were then used to calculate k cat/K m values (Table V). Although comparisons between the columns of Table V are subject to the vagaries of the percentages of active enzyme after refolding, certain conclusions are evident. For instance, peptide MA13, which contained the hexapeptide PLG↓LYA used for the positive control phage in the MMP-14 screen, was a good substrate for MMP-14 but was not cleaved at a detectable rate by MMP-11 or MMP-11 mutant proteins, as expected from the phage assays (Table V). MA15 and MA18 contained the hexapeptide"
https://openalex.org/W2122892693,"Activation of cyclic nucleotide-dependent signaling pathways leads to phosphorylation of the small heat shock-related protein, HSP20, on serine 16, and relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. In this study, we used an enhanced protein transduction domain (PTD) sequence to deliver HSP20 phosphopeptide analogs into porcine coronary artery. The transduction of phosphoHSP20 analogs led to dose-dependent relaxation of coronary artery smooth muscle. Peptides containing the protein transduction domain coupled to a random orientation of the same amino acids did not. Direct fluorescence microscopy of arterial rings incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-PTD or FITC-PTD-HSP20 peptides showed a diffuse peptide uptake. Mass spectrometric immunoassays (MSIAs) of smooth muscle homogenates were used to determine whether the phosphopeptide analogs affected the phosphorylation of endogenous HSP20. Treatment with the phosphodiesterase inhibitor papaverine led to a mass shift of 80 Da. However, there was no mass shift of HSP20 in muscles treated with phosphoHSP20 analogs. This suggests that the PTD-phosphoHSP20 peptide alone is sufficient to inhibit force maintenance and likely has a direct effect on the target of phosphorylated HSP20. These results suggest that transduction of phosphopeptide analogs of HSP20 directly alters physiological responses of intact muscles. The data also support a direct role for phosphorylated HSP20 in mediating vasorelaxation."

The enzymatic hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond involves two carboxylic acid residues, and their identification, together with the stereochemistry of the reaction, provides crucial information on the catalytic mechanism. Two catalytic mutants of a β-xylosidase from Geobacillus stearothermophilus T-6 were subjected to detailed kinetic analysis to verify their role in catalysis. The activity of the E335G mutant decreased ∼106-fold, and this activity was enhanced 103-fold in the presence of external nucleophiles such as formate and azide, resulting in a xylosyl-azide product with an opposite anomeric configuration. These results are consistent with Glu335 as the nucleophile in this retaining enzyme. The D495G mutant was subjected to detailed kinetic analysis using substrates bearing different leaving groups (pK a). The mutant exhibited 103-fold reduction in activity, and the Brønsted plot of log(k cat) versus pK a revealed that deglycosylation is the rate-limiting step, indicating that this step was reduced by 103-fold. The rates of the glycosylation step, as reflected by the specificity constant (k cat/K m), were similar to those of the wild type enzyme for hydrolysis of substrates requiring little protonic assistance (low pK a) but decreased 102-fold for those that require strong acid catalysis (high pK a). Furthermore, the pH dependence profile of the mutant enzyme revealed that acid catalysis is absent. Finally, the presence of azide significantly enhanced the mutant activity accompanied with the generation of a xylosyl-azide product with retained anomeric configuration. These results are consistent with Asp495 acting as the acid-base in XynB2. β-d-Xylosidases (EC 3.2.1.37) are exo-type glycoside hydrolases that hydrolyze short xylooligosaccharides to xylose units.

The rates of the glycosylation step, as reflected by the specificity constant (k cat/K m), were similar to those of the wild type enzyme for hydrolysis of substrates requiring little protonic assistance (low pK a) but decreased 102-fold for those that require strong acid catalysis (high pK a). Furthermore, the pH dependence profile of the mutant enzyme revealed that acid catalysis is absent. Finally, the presence of azide significantly enhanced the mutant activity accompanied with the generation of a xylosyl-azide product with retained anomeric configuration. These results are consistent with Asp495 acting as the acid-base in XynB2. β-d-Xylosidases (EC 3.2.1.37) are hemicellulases that hydrolyze short xylooligosaccharides into single xylose units. These enzymes are part of an array of glycoside hydrolases responsible for the complete degradation of xylan (1Shallom D. Shoham Y. Curr. Opin. Microbial. 2003; 6: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). This polymer is the major hemicellulosic polysaccharide in the plant cell wall representing up to 30–35% of the total dry mass (2Beg Q.K. Kapoor M. Mahajan L. Hoondal G.S. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 56: 326-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). Hemicellulases, together with cellulases, have a key role in the carbon cycle in nature, because they are responsible for the complete degradation of the plant biomass to soluble saccharides. These in turn can be used as carbon or energy sources for microorganisms and higher animals. Hemicellulases have attracted much attention in recent years because of their potential industrial uses in biobleaching of paper pulp (2Beg Q.K. Kapoor M. Mahajan L. Hoondal G.S. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 56: 326-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar, 3Suurnakki A. Tenkanen M. Buchert J. Viikari L. Adv. Biochem. Eng.

Biotechnol. 2002; 59: 618-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar), improvement of animal feedstock digestibility, and recently in the field of oligosaccharide and thioglycoside synthesis (5Mackenzie L.F. Wang Q. Warren R.A. Withers S.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 5583-5584Crossref Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 6Jahn M. Marles J. Warren R.A. Withers S.G. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2003; 42: 352-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The glycosidic bond is one of the most stable bonds in nature, with a half-life of over 5 million years (7Wolfenden R. Lu X. Young G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 6814-6815Crossref Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Glycoside hydrolases can accelerate the hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond by more than 1017-fold, making them the most efficient catalysts known. The enzymatic hydrolysis of the glycosidic bonds occurs via two major mechanisms, giving rise to either an overall retention or an inversion of the anomeric configuration. In both mechanisms, the hydrolysis usually requires two carboxylic acids, which are conserved within each glycoside hydrolase family, and proceeds through oxocarbenium ion-like transition states. Inverting glycosidases use a single displacement mechanism with the assistance of general acid and general base residues. Retaining glycosidases follow a two-step double displacement mechanism as shown in Fig. 1, involving two catalytic residues, one functioning as a nucleophile and the other functioning as an acid-base (8Davies G. Sinnott M.L. Withers S.G. Sinnott M.L. Comprehensive Biological Catalysis. Academic Press Ltd., London1998: 119-209Google Scholar). Identification of the key active site residues is of great importance because it provides crucial information regarding the enzymatic catalytic mechanism and allows rational protein design for novel applications, such as for enzymatic synthesis (5Mackenzie L.F. Wang Q. Warren R.A. Withers S.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 5583-5584Crossref Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Candidates for the catalytic residues are primarily identified by searching for conserved carboxylates (Glu or Asp) throughout multiple amino acid sequence alignment. These conserved residues are replaced to a noncarboxylic residue, and the generated mutants are subjected to detailed kinetic analysis using substrates bearing different leaving groups, azide rescue analysis, and pH dependence activity profiles of the mutants and the wild type. In some cases, identification can be accomplished by labeling the catalytic residues using mechanism-based inactivators and affinity labels (9Zechel D.L. Withers S.G. Poulter C.D. Comprehensive Natural Products Chemistry. Vol. 5. Elsevier, New York1999: 279-314Crossref Google Scholar). Based on amino acid sequence similarities, β-d-xylosidases are currently divided into families 3, 39, 43, 52, and 54 of glycoside hydrolases (10Henrissat B. Davies G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar, 11Henrissat B. Bairoch A. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 695-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar). These families together with all other glycoside hydrolase families can be readily accessed at the constantly updated web site afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/CAZY. Although the identities of the catalytic residues for most of these β-d-xylosidase families are already known (12Bravman T. Mechaly A. Shulami S. Belakhov V. Baasov T. Shoham G. Shoham Y.

Previously, we reported the cloning and purification of a β-xylosidase from Geobacillus stearothermophilus T-6 (XynB2) showing homology to family 52 glycoside hydrolases. Its stereochemical course of hydrolysis showed that the configuration of the anomeric carbon was retained, indicating that a retaining mechanism prevails in family 52 glycoside hydrolases (17Bravman T. Zolotnitsky G. Shulami S. Belakhov V. Solomon D. Baasov T. Shoham G. Shoham Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 495: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Because the β-xylosidase from G. stearothermophilus T-6 can be readily overexpressed and purified, it can serve as an excellent representative of family 52 glycoside hydrolases for the identification of the two key active site residues. This paper describes a detailed kinetic analysis of the putative acid-base and nucleophile mutants of XynB2, using substrates bearing different leaving groups, chemical rescue, and pH dependence profiles. The study provides for the first time unequivocal identification of the two catalytic residues of family 52 glycoside hydrolases. Substrates—The substrates 2,5-dinitrophenyl β-d-xylopyranoside, 3,4-dinitrophenyl β-d-xylopyranoside, 2,4,6-trichlorophenyl β-d-xylopyranoside, and m-nitrophenyl β-d-xylopyranoside were synthesized as described by Ziser et al. (18Ziser L. Setyawati I. Withers S.G. Carbohydr. Res. 1995; 274: 137-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). p-Nitrophenyl β-d-xylopyranoside, o-nitrophenyl β-d-xylopyranoside, and 4-methylumbelliferyl β-d-xylopyranoside were from Sigma. Mutagenesis, Protein Expression, and Purification—The xynB2 gene (GenBank™ accession number AJ305327) from G. stearothermophilus T-6 was cloned in the pET9d vector, overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3), and purified as previously reported (17Bravman T. Zolotnitsky G. Shulami S. Belakhov V. Solomon D. Baasov T. Shoham G. Shoham Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 495: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The mutagenic primers for the mutations were as follows (the mutated nucleotides are in bold type): D495G, 5′-GGAAATCACAACGTACGGGAGTTTGGATGTTTCTCTTGG-3′ and 5′-CCAAGAGAAACATCCAAACTCCCGTACGTTGTGATTTCC-3′; E335G, 5′-GCCGATTTGGGTCGTTAACGGCGGCGAGTACCGGATGATG-3′ and 5′-CATCATCCGGTACTCGCCGCCGTTAACGACCCAAATCGGC-3′; E335A, 5′-GCCGATTTGGGTCGTTAACGCCGGCGAGTACCGGATGATG-3′ and 5′-CATCATCCGGTACTCGCCGGCGTTAACGACCCAAATCGGC-3′; and E335Q, 5′-GCCGATTTGGGTCGTTAACCAGGGCGAGTACCGGATGATG-3′ and 5′-CATCATCCGGTACTCGCCCTGGTTAACGACCCAAATCGGC-3′. The mutagenic primers were designed to include the mutation and when possible a restriction site to allow easy identification of the mutation. All of the mutations were created by a double base pair substitution to avoid translational misincorporation during protein synthesis by the host cell. The mutated genes were sequenced to confirm that only the desired mutations were inserted, and the proteins were overexpressed and purified as described for the wild type. Kinetic Studies—Steady state kinetic studies were performed by following the absorbance changes in the UV-visible range, using an Ultrospec 2100 pro spectrophotometer (Amersham Biosciences) equipped with a temperature-stabilized water circulating bath. Initial hydrolysis rates were determined by incubating 500 μl of different substrate concentrations (ranging from 0.1 to 7 K m where applicable) in 100 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 40 °C within the spectrophotometer until thermal equilibration was achieved. The exact temperature inside the cuvette was verified using a thermocouple. The reactions were initiated by the addition of 100 μl of appropriately diluted enzyme, and the release of the phenol-derived product was monitored at the appropriate wavelength. For very low K m values, the initial rates were measured with special care. For highly reactive substrates, blank mixtures containing all of the reactants except the enzyme were used to correct for spontaneous hydrolysis of the substrates. Sodium azide and formate were added to the reaction mixtures where mentioned. The extinction coefficients used at pH 7.0 and 40 °C and the wavelength monitored for each substrate were as follows: 2,5-dinitrophenyl, 420 nm, Δ∈ = 3.68 mm–1 cm–1; 3,4-dinitrophenyl, 400 nm, Δ∈ = 11.15 mm–1 cm–1; 2,4,6-trichlorophenyl, 312 nm, Δ∈ = 3.97 mm–1 cm–1; 4-nitrophenyl, 420 nm, Δ∈ = 7.61 mm–1 cm–1; 2-nitrophenyl, 420 nm, Δ∈ = 1.91 mm–1 cm–1; 4-methylumbelliferyl, 355 nm, Δ∈ = 2.87 mm–1 cm–1; 3-nitrophenyl, 380 nm, Δ∈ = 0.455 mm–1 cm–1. The values of K m and k cat were determined by nonlinear regression analysis using the program GraFit 5.0 (19Leatherbarrow R.J. GraFit. 5 Ed. Erithacus Software Ltd., Horley, UK2001Google Scholar). pH dependence studies were carried at 40 °C with pNPX 1The abbreviations used are: pNPX, p-nitrophenyl β-d-xylopyranoside; 2,5-DNPX, 2,5-dinitrophenyl β-d-xylopyranoside; FTIR, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. as a substrate. Mixtures containing 600 μl of 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and different concentrations of substrate solutions in the appropriate buffer were prewarmed until the reaction was initiated by the addition of 200 μl of appropriately diluted enzyme. The buffers used were at a final concentration of 100 mm and were: citric acid-Na2HPO4 (pH 4.5–6.5), phosphate buffer (pH 6.0–8.0), and Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5–8.5). The pH range employed in this study included only pH values for which the enzyme was stable for at least 5 min. The reactions were monitored continuously at 40 °C, and upon completion the actual pH was measured to verify that the pH had not changed. The release of p-nitrophenol was monitored at 400 nm, and the mm extinction coefficients for p-nitrophenolate were determined at pH 4.63, 5.35, 6.02, 6.53, 6.93, 7.61, 8.0, 8.3, and 8.56 as follows: 1.43, 1.89, 4.45, 7.46, 11.2, 16.2, 17.0, 17.3, and 17.6 mm–1 cm–1, respectively. The pK a values assigned to the ionizable groups were determined using the program GraFit 5.0. Isolation and Analysis of Reaction Products in the Presence of Sodium Azide—The enzymatic reactions included 0.4 mg/ml of either XynB2-E335G or XynB2-D495G, 10 mm of 2,5-DNPX, and 1 m sodium azide in a final volume of 10 ml of 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The mixtures were incubated at 40 °C, and the reaction was monitored by TLC. TLC analysis was performed using precoated plates (Silica Gel 60 F254, 0.25 mm; Merck), and MeOH/CHCl3 1:4 as the running solvents. The spots were visualized by charring with a yellow solution containing 120 g of (NH4)Mo7O24·4H2Oand5gof(NH4)2Ce(NO3)6 in 800 ml of 10% H2SO4. After complete hydrolysis of the substrate (∼5 h), the mixtures were lyophilized, and the resulting solid was extracted with methanol (4 × 5 ml). The extracts were combined and evaporated to dryness. The crude material was purified by flash chromatography (MeOH:CHCl3, 1:9) on a silica gel (Merck; 63–200 mesh) column to yield the pure product as a white solid (40 mg). 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at an ambient temperature on a Bruker Avance 500 MHz spectrometer. The mass spectrum was obtained on a TSQ-70B mass spectrometer (Finnigan Mat) by negative chemical ionization in isobutane or on a Bruker Daltomics Apex-III (ICR-MS) by the method of electrospray ionization. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was recorded on a Bruker vector 22 spectrometer. Site-directed Mutagenesis—We have recently described the purification and stereochemical course of hydrolysis of a β-xylosidase (XynB2) from family 52 glycoside hydrolases (17Bravman T. Zolotnitsky G. Shulami S. Belakhov V. Solomon D. Baasov T. Shoham G. Shoham Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 495: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In that report we suggested that Glu337 and Glu413 are involved in catalysis. However, further examination of these mutants revealed that they are not catalytic residues. To identify the catalytic residues of XynB2, the amino acid sequences of family 52 glycosidases were aligned, and many conserved carboxylic residues were revealed. These were replaced via site-directed mutagenesis to glycine, and the generated mutants were screened for reduction in activity. During the course of the work, it was apparent that part of the mutants exhibited inconsistent behavior. As it turned out, inconsistency arose from two main reasons: (a) contaminations from translational misincorporation as was observed previously (20Shallom D. Belakhov V. Solomon D. Shoham G. Baasov T. Shoham Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43667-43673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and (b) contaminations from the purification procedure. To avoid these potential problems, all of the mutations were created by a double base pair substitution, and special care was taken during all of the purification procedures. Following systematic replacement of the conserved carboxylic residues in XynB2, two mutants, E335G and D495G, that reside in highly conserved regions were promising candidates for the catalytic pair. Therefore, these were overexpressed, purified, and subjected to extensive kinetic analysis as described below. Catalytic Properties of the Glu335 and Asp495 Mutants— Glu335 was replaced with Gly, Ala, or Gln, and the catalytic properties of the E335G, E335A, and E335Q mutants using pNPX and 2,5-DNPX as substrates were determined and summarized in Table I. The k cat values measured for the E335G, E335A, and E335Q mutants were all significantly reduced and are about 10–6-fold of wild type activity with both pNPX and 2,5-DNPX as substrates. The very low activity precluded reliable K m determination.Table Ikcat values for hydrolysis of aryl-β-d-xylosides by XynB2 and its Glu335 mutantsEnzymePhenol substituentkcats-1Wild type4-nitro18Wild type2,5-dinitro64E335G4-nitro2.0 × 10-5E335G2,5-dinitro7.5 × 10-4E335G2,5-dinitro + 1.4 M azide3.3 × 10-1E335G2,5-dinitro + 2.3 M formate6.7 × 10-1E335A4-nitro3.4 × 10-6E335A2,5-dinitro1.7 × 10-4E335A2,5-dinitro + 1.4 M azide5.6 × 10-3E335Q4-nitro8.1 × 10-5E335Q2,5-dinitro4.2 × 10-4E335Q2,5-dinitro + 1.4 M azide1.9 × 10-3 Open table in a new tab Similarly, Asp495 was replaced with Gly, and the kinetic constants of the D495G mutant were determined using different aryl β-d-xylopyranosides with different leaving groups (Table II and Fig. 2). The k cat values of the D495G mutant were 103-fold lower than for the wild type. For both the wild type enzyme and the D495G mutant, k cat values were invariant for hydrolysis of all of the substrates. Although the K m values of the wild type enzyme were roughly similar with all substrates, with the D495G mutant these values increased as the substrate reactivity decreased (increasing pK a). Consequently, the decrease in the specificity constant (k cat/K m) values for the D495G mutant was more pronounced, because the substrates are less reactive.Table IIKinetic parameters for hydrolysis of aryl-β-d-xylosides by XynB2 and by the D495G mutant in the absence and presence of 0.63 m azideAglyconepKaEnzymekcatKmk cat/Kms-1mMs-1 nM-12,5-Dinitrophenyl5.15wtawt, wild type.640.6795D495G0.0570.001734D495G + 0.63 M azide520.0539743,4-Dinitrophenyl5.36wt500.15330D495G0.0880.0003295D495G + 0.63 M azide270.0455942,4,6-Trichlorophenyl6.39wt610.8175D495G0.0630.00163D495G + 0.63 M azide210.181174-Nitrophenyl7.18wt180.13140D495G0.0390.00429.2D495G + 0.63 M azide0.420.019222-Nitrophenyl7.22wt730.4660D495G0.0670.003420D495G + 0.63 M azide2.20.03564-Methylumbelliferyl7.53wt800.35230D495G0.0550.0321.7D495G + 0.63 M azide0.20.121.63-Nitrophenyl8.39wt410.8747D495G0.0210.0610.34D495G + 0.63 M azide0.0260.0990.27a wt, wild type.

Withers S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 487-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In the presence of 1.4 m azide, k cat values increased by ∼4, 33, and 400 times for E335Q, E335A, and E335G mutants, respectively (Table I), indicating that the effect of azide decreases as the side chain is longer. The addition of 2.3 m formate resulted in a 103-fold increase of k cat for the E335G mutants (Table I). Both azide and formate accelerated the reaction in a concentration-dependent manner. The kinetic constants of hydrolysis of 2,5-DNPX by the D495G mutant in the presence of different concentrations of azide were measured and are plotted in Fig. 3. Both k cat and K m increased with increasing azide concentrations until leveling off at about 0.5 m azide. Consequently, the k cat/K m values remained unchanged. The effect of azide was also tested for the hydrolysis of substrates with different leaving groups at substrate saturating conditions (Fig. 4). All of the k cat values increased with increasing concentrations of azide until reaching a plateau. Finally, the kinetic constants for hydrolysis of various aryl β-d-xylopyranosides were determined in the presence of 0.63 m azide (Table II and Fig. 5).Fig. 4k cat values for hydrolysis of aryl β-d-xylopyranosides by XynB2-D495G in the presence of various concentration of sodium azide. ○, 2,5-DNPX; •, 3,4-dinitrophenyl β-d-xylopyranoside; □, 2,4,6-trichlorophenyl β-d-xylopyranoside; ▪, o-nitrophenyl β-d-xylopyranoside; ▵, pNPX.

TLC analysis of the reaction mixture containing E335G, 2,5-DNPX, and azide revealed the formation of a new product (R f = 0.5) distinct from xylopyranoside (R f = 0.18) and 2,5-DNPX (R f = 0.51). This new product was isolated and identified as α-d-xylopyranosyl azide, as determined by 1H NMR (Fig. 6a), 13C NMR, mass spectrometry, and FTIR: 1H NMR (500 MHz, CD3OD) δ 3.48 (m, 3H, H-2, H-3, H-5), 3.57 (t, 1H, J = 11.0 Hz, H-4), 3.70 (dd, 1H, J = 5.0, 12.0 Hz, H-5′), 5.24 (d, 1H, J = 2.5 Hz, H-1); 13C NMR (125.8 MHz, CD3OD) δ 65.4, 71.0, 73.3, 74.6, 91.6 (C-1); negative CIMS m/z 173.9 (M-H–, C5H9O4N3 requires 175.1); FTIR (mineral oil) ν 2116 cm–1 (N3). Likewise, TLC analysis of the reaction mixture containing D495G, 2,5-DNPX, and azide revealed the formation of a new product (R f = 0.42) distinct from xylopyranoside (R f = 0.18) and 2,5-DNPX (R f = 0.51). This new product was isolated and identified as β-d-xylopyranosyl azide, as determined by 1H NMR (Fig. 6b), 13C NMR, mass spectrometry, and FTIR: 1H NMR (500.1 MHz, CD3OD) δ 3.03 (t, 1H, J 2,3 = 9.0 Hz, H-2), 3.21 (t, 1H, J 5a,5b = 11.5 Hz, H-5a), 3.23 (t, 1H, J 3,4 = 9.0 Hz, H-3), 3.39 (ddd, 1H, J 4,5a = 9.5 Hz, J 4,5b = 5.5 Hz, H-4), 3.84 (dd, 1H, H-5b), 4.33 (d, 1H, J 1,2 = 8.1 Hz, H-1). 13C NMR (125.8 MHz, CD3OD) δ 69.0 (C-5), 70.8 (C-4), 74.7 (C-2), 78.1 (C-3), 92.7 (C-1); electrospray ionization m/z: 198.1 (M+ + Na, C5H9O4N3, requires 175.1); FTIR (mineral oil) ν 2116 cm–1 (N3). pH Dependence—The k cat values of the wild type enzyme and the D495G mutant for hydrolysis of pNPX were determined at different pH values in the range of 4.5–8.5 (Fig. 7). The pH activity profile of the wild type enzyme showed strong dependence upon pH changes with pK a values of <4 and 7.3. Conversely, no such dependence is observed for the mutant enzyme within these pH values. The activity of the mutant at pH levels lower than 4 could not be determined because the enzyme was insoluble. Glu335 Is the Catalytic Nucleophile—In retaining glycoside hydrolases, the nucleophilic residue is extremely important for carrying out efficient catalysis. The nucleophile attacks the anomeric carbon to form a covalent enzyme intermediate, which is sufficiently stable to permit the diffusion of the leaving group from the active site and subsequently the entrance of a water molecule. Furthermore, the nucleophile is important for maintaining the correct ionization state of the acid-base catalyst, and in some cases, for assistance in stabilizing the oxocarbenium ion-like transition state by creating strong hydrogen bond with the sugar 2-hydroxyl (22Zechel D.L. Withers S.G. Acc. Chem. Res. 2000; 33: 11-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, replacing the nucleophile with a noncarboxylic residue usually severely affects the enzymatic catalysis and in some cases leads to nondetectable activity (21Ly H.D. Withers S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 487-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The k cat values measured for the E335G, E335A, and E335Q mutants were all drastically reduced with activities of about 106-fold lower than the wild type for hydrolysis of both pNPX and 2,5-DNPX. This magnitude of decrease in activity is typical for nucleophile mutants and was also observed in other retaining glycoside hydrolases (21Ly H.D. Withers S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 487-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). However, the substantial decrease in the catalytic activity is insufficient for the unequivocal assignment of Glu335 as the catalytic nucleophile. There are several examples where single mutations in proposed catalytic residues of glycoside hydrolases resulted in reduced or undetectable activity (23Sierks M.R. Ford C. Reilly P.J. Svensson B.

In this procedure (Fig. 8a), the catalytic activities of the putative catalytic mutants are monitored in the presence of small nucleophilic anions, such as azide or formate. The small anion can enter the vacant place created by the elimination of the nucleophilic residue and attack the anomeric carbon of the sugar substrate to form a glycosyl-azide product (when azide is added) with inverted anomeric configuration. Rate acceleration of the mutant in the presence of external anions is a strong indication that the mutation is indeed in the catalytic residue. Although no rate enhancement was observed for the wild type enzyme, the hydrolysis rates of 2,5-DNPX by the E335G mutant significantly accelerated with increasing concentrations of azide and formate. The presence of 2.3 m formate increased k cat up to 103-fold, only 100 times lower from the wild type activity. Interestingly, in the presence of 1.4 m azide, the rate of hydrolysis by the E335G mutant was accelerated by about 4 × 102-fold, whereas hydrolysis by the E335A and E335Q mutants with the same azide concentration resulted in only 32- and 4-fold rate enhancement, respectively. Hence, as the length of the side chain increases, the vacant place is smaller, preventing azide facile penetration. Interestingly, formate had a greater effect on rate acceleration, although it exhibits lower nucleophilicity. This was also observed with the nucleophile-less mutants of the β-glucosidase from Agrobacterium faecalis (27Wang Q. Graham"
https://openalex.org/W2141931365,"We have cloned two mouse cDNAs encoding previously unidentified membrane-bound dipeptidases [membrane-bound dipeptidase-2 (MBD-2) and membrane-bound dipeptidase-3 (MBD-3)] from membrane-bound dipeptidase-1 (MBD-1) deficient mice (Habib, G.M., Shi, Z-Z., Cuevas, A.A., Guo, Q., Matzuk, M.M., and Lieberman, M.W. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95, 4859-4863). These enzymes are closely related to MBD-1 (EC 3.4.13.19), which is known to cleave leukotriene D4 (LTD4) and cystinyl-bis-glycine. MBD-2 cDNA is 56% identical to MBD-1 with a predicted amino acid identity of 33%. The MBD-3 and MBD-1 cDNAs share a 55% nucleotide identity and a 39% predicted amino acid sequence identity. All three genes are tightly linked on the same chromosome. Expression of MBD-2 and MBD-3 in Cos cells indicated that both are membrane-bound through a glycosylphosphatidyl-inositol linkage. MBD-2 cleaves leukotriene D4 (LTD4) but not cystinyl-bis-glycine, while MBD-3 cleaves cystinyl-bis-glycine but not LTD4. MBD-1 is expressed at highest levels in kidney, lung, and heart and is absent in spleen, while MBD-2 is expressed at highest levels in lung, heart, and testis and at somewhat lower levels in spleen. Of the tissues examined, MBD-3 expression was detected only in testis. Our identification of a second enzyme capable of cleaving LTD4 raises the possibility that clearance of LTD4 during asthma and in related inflammatory conditions may be mediated by more than one enzyme."

The MCM genes, including MCM1 and the family of related genes, MCM2, MCM3, MCM4, MCM5, MCM6, and MCM7, were originally identified as genes essential for minichromosome maintenance (1Maine G.T.

However, although all mcm mutants show defects in DNA replication, the molecular basis for their replication defects may be different. Mcm1 (3Passmore S. Elble R. Tye B.K.

Mcm1 also plays a direct role in DNA replication by binding to replication origins (21Chang V.K. Fitch M.J. Donato J.J. Christensen T.W. Merchant A.M. Tye B.-K. J. Biol.

A recent study showed that Mcm1 binds multiple sites flanking the minimal functional domains of replication origins in vitro. The association of Mcm1 with replication origins was also demonstrated in vivo by chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments. Thus, Mcm1 may regulate the process of DNA replication as well as the expression of DNA replication genes. Like Mcm1, the MCM2–7 family of proteins is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to human (2Tye B.K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 649-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Several studies suggest that these six proteins form the precursor complex of the hexameric helicase (22Ishimi Y. J. Biol.

However, the notion that the periodic synthesis of these proteins might limit DNA replication to once per cell cycle conflicts with their extreme abundance and constitutive presence in proliferating cells (31Dalton S.

A possible explanation for these contradictory properties is that the MCM2–7 proteins may perform other functions that involve separate pools of these proteins (2Tye B.K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 649-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is consistent with the observation that individual members of the MCM2–7 family may undergo various forms of post-translational modifications including phosphorylation (33Young M.

EMBO Rep. 2001; 21: 119-123Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Moreover, genome wide location studies indicate that individual members of the MCM2–7 family are localized not only at replication origins but also at nonorigin regions and that these proteins may not act in unity (38Wyrick J.J. Aparicio J.G. Chen T. Barnett J.D. Jennings E.G. Young R.A. Bell S.P. Aparicio O.M. Science. 2001; 294: 2357-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The possibility that Mcm1 may play an indirect role in DNA replication by regulating the expression of DNA replication genes has been investigated (18Mai B. Miles S. Breeden L.L. Mol. Cell.

However, we found that a cofactor of Mcm1 in this regulation is Mcm7, suggesting that Mcm7 may play a dual role in DNA replication by acting as part of the MCM helicase as well as temporally regulating its own expression. Plasmids and Strains—Plasmids used are: YCp101A (ARS1 CEN5 ADE3), YCp101 (ARS1 CEN5), YCp120 (ARS120 CEN5), and YCp121 (ARS121 CEN5); pSH18–34 (lexAop-lacZ). pYES.Mcm1-His6 was constructed by inserting the MCM1 ORF 1The abbreviations used are: ORF, open reading frame; GST, glutathione S-transferase; BSA, bovine serum albumin; SCB, Swi4/6 cell cycle box; chIP, Chromatin immunoprecipitation; ECB, early cell cycle box; HA, hemagglutinin; MCE, Mcm1 consensus element. into the pYES2.1 TOPO vector (Invitrogen) to create a galactose-inducible His6 C-terminal tagged Mcm1 fusion. pMCM1-GST was constructed as follows. The vector pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences) was first modified by filling in the ends of the BamHI-cut vector and adding a NdeI 8-mer linker to generate pGEX-2TN. The MCM1 gene was constructed with a NdeI site at the ATG start codon using site-directed mutagenesis. The construct was inserted as a NdeI-ClaI fragment into the pGEX-2TN plasmid at NdeI and SmaI. pMCM7-GST was constructed by cloning the MCM7 ORF in frame to GST within pGEX-2T. Yeast strains used are: YC1-1 (α mcm1-1 ade2 ade3 leu2 ura3 his4), DBY2029 (α ade2-1 lys2-801 leu2-3, 112, ura3-52 mcm7-1), DBY2055 (a ura3-52 his4-619), BY4743 (a α his3/his3 ura3/ura3 leu2/leu2), K7428 (a ura3 Δcdc20::LEU2 his3 GAL-CDC20::TRP1), mutant 23342 (BY4743 MCM7/mcm7::Kan) (Research Genetics), and EGY40 (a ura3 trp1 leu2 his3). RNA Methods—RNA was purified using the yeast heat-freeze protocol (40Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). 10 μg of total RNA was used for Northern blots (41Ausubel F.M. Brent T. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., Cambridge, MA1998Google Scholar). Radioactive probes were produced using the STRIP-EZ™ kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Quantitation of radioactive signals was performed on a Molecular Dynamics Storm 840 PhosphorImager, and quantitative analysis was performed using ImageQuant software. Protein Purification—Mcm1-His6 was purified from 500 ml of yeast culture induced for 5 h with 2% galactose. After 5 h of induction, cells were pelleted and Mcm1-His6 was purified using the Y-PER His6 purification kit according to the protocol from the manufacturer (Pierce). Peak fractions of Mcm1-His6 were pooled and dialyzed against 2 liters of minimal Mcm1 band shift buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 60 mm NaCl, 7 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA). GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysS (F′ ampT hsdS B (r –8, M –8) dcm gal (DE3) plysS CmR) using pMCM1-GST or pMCM7-GST. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced cells were pelleted and re-suspended in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were lysed by sonication using the Branson 250 sonicator. Clarified extracts were incubated with glutathione-S-Sepharose for 2–3 h at 4 °C, and the mixture was poured in disposable columns. Columns were washed three times with 10 bed volumes of phosphate-buffered saline before elution with reduced glutathione at a concentration of 2 mm. Eluted samples were pooled and dialyzed overnight against buffer 1 (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm zinc acetate, 10% glycerol, 60 mm NaCl, 7 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA). Concentrations of purified proteins are calibrated against known amounts of BSA in Coomassie-stained polyacrylamide gels. Band Shift Reactions—Purified proteins were mixed with radioactively labeled DNA in buffer 1 (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm zinc acetate, 10% glycerol, 60 mm NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 7 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA) in 15–30-μl volumes. 500 ng of poly(dI-dC) was added to each reaction. The binding reactions were incubated at room temperature for 20 min before electrophoresis in 5–6% 1× TBE, 5% glycerol polyacrylamide gels. Gels were dried onto 3-mm paper and either exposed to film or exposed to a PhosphorImager screen. DNase I Footprinting—DNase 1 footprinting was performed as described for the band shift reactions. Purified proteins and DNA were mixed in buffer 1 in a 0.2-ml volume for 20 min. A pre-calibrated amount of DNase I (Sigma) was added in a volume of 0.01 ml for 1 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by precipitation in a mixture of ethanol, 0.3 m sodium acetate, and 1 μg of linear acrylamide. Precipitate was washed with 70% ethanol, dried, and re-suspended in formamide buffer before loading onto a 6 m urea, 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gel. Formaldehyde Cross-linking Immunoprecipitation—Formaldehyde cross-linking was performed as described by Hecht et al. (42Hecht A. Strahl-Bolsinger S. Grunstein M. Nature. 1996; 383: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Strains were grown in complete medium in 10 mm phosphate buffer at pH 7.5, to A 600 of 0.6–1.0. Between 15 and 50 ml of cells were cross-linked and then immunoprecipitated with 1.0–2.5 μl of specific antibodies overnight at 4 °C on a shaker. All washing steps were performed in Bio-Rad microspin columns. The collected immune complexes were washed two times in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate), two times in lysis buffer with 0.5 m NaCl, two times in the final wash buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.25 m LiCl, 0.75% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA), and two times in TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA). Protein-DNA cross-links were reversed overnight at 65 °C. DNA samples were purified by the addition of five volumes of PB buffer and then passed through Qiagen PCR purification columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Purified DNA was eluted with 40 μl of TE. PCR Amplification—PCR was carried out using the following conditions: 2 times (94 °C for 2.0 min, 96 °C for 1.0 min, 54 °C for 4.0 min), 24 times (94 °C for 1.0 min, 54 °C for 1.5 min), and 1 time (70 °C for 5.0 min). 5 μCi of [α-32P]dATP was added to each PCR set up as a multiplex reaction. Each PCR contains the ATP11 primers (negative control) in addition to primer pairs for the MCM7, MCM5, CDC6 promoters or ARS305, respectively. The primer pair for ATP11 is directed at the coding region of the gene. The sizes of the PCR products for MCM7, MCM5, CDC6, ARS305, and ATP11 are 387, 226, 261, 280, and 412 bp, respectively. Quantitation of radioactive signals was performed on a Molecular Dynamics Storm 840 PhosphorImager, and quantitative analysis was performed using ImageQuant software. Unlike real-time PCR, time points with high signals may be underrepresented in magnitude because these values may have been generated beyond the exponential phase of the PCR reaction. Other Methods—Plasmid stability assay is described by Lei et al. (32Lei M. Kawasaki Y. Tye B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5081-5090Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Flow cytometric analysis was performed as described elsewhere (43Haase S.B. Lew D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 322-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase assays were performed as described elsewhere (44Kippert F. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 128: 201-206PubMed Google Scholar). Dosage Suppression of mcm1-1 by MCM7 and mcm7-1 by MCM1—To investigate the molecular basis of the minichromosome maintenance defect of the transcriptional activator Mcm1, we searched for dosage suppressors that alleviate the Mcm– defect of mcm1-1. MCM7 was identified as a dosage suppressor that stabilized minichromosomes in the mcm1-1 strain. 2S. DiTusa, M. Osman, and B. Tye, unpublished results. A tester plasmid YCp101A containing ARS1 is unstable in the mcm1-1 mutant (Fig. 1A). This minichromosome loss defect is complemented by MCM1 and partially suppressed by MCM7 carried on a high copy plasmid. Moreover, MCM1 on a high copy plasmid also partially suppresses the temperature-sensitive growth defect of mcm7-1 (Fig. 1B), which arrests growth at 37 °C in late S phase with almost two genome equivalents of DNA (data not shown). This partial suppression of mcm1-1 by MCM7 and mcm7-1 by MCM1 is not gene-specific. Previous work has shown that overexpression of CDC6 suppresses a mcm1 mutation (29McInerny C.J. Partridge J.F. Mikesell G.E. Creemer D.P. Breeden L.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1277-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). A high copy plasmid containing MCM1 also partially suppresses the temperature-sensitive defects of other mcm mutants such as mcm2-1 and mcm3-10, indicating that MCM1 dosage suppression is not specific to mcm7-1. There are two likely explanations for the partial dosage suppression of mutant phenotypes of mcm1-1 by MCM7 and mcm7-1 by MCM1 that may also explain the relationships between Mcm1 and other replication genes. First, Mcm1 regulates the expression of MCM7. Increasing the dosage of the regulator or the regulated product would increase the level of Mcm7. Second, dosage suppression may result from the stabilization of a complex formed between Mcm1 and Mcm7 by increased concentration of one of the interacting partners. An example is the suppression of the mating defects of matα1 and matα2 mutants by overexpression of Mcm1 (15Passmore S. Maine G.T. Elble R. Christ C. Tye B.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 593-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). To explore these possibilities, we compared the transcript levels of MCM7 in the mcm1-1 mutant and wild type strains (Fig. 1C, a). In parallel, we also compared the transcript level of MCM7 in the mcm7-1 strain (Fig. 1C, b). We found that the MCM7 transcripts are reproducibly reduced by approximately half in the mcm1-1 strain but increased by ∼2–4-fold in the mcm7-1 mutant (see also Fig. 4, B and C). The effect of mcm7-1 on MCM7 expression is unexpected, suggesting that Mcm7 may also be involved in the regulation of its own transcription. We also investigated the functional relationship between Mcm1 and Mcm7 in the mcm1-1 mcm7-1 double mutant. We found that mcm1-1 partially suppresses the growth defect of mcm7-1 at 34.5 °C, supporting the notion that these two mutations may exert compensatory effects (Fig. 1D). To investigate whether small changes in the transcript level of MCM7 would have a measurable effect on DNA replication, the stability of minichromosomes in diploids containing either one or two copies of MCM7 was examined. Northern blot analysis confirmed that there is a 2-fold difference in the transcript level corresponding to the number of copies of MCM7 in these two strains (data not shown). The stability of three different minichromosomes, each containing a different replication origin, was analyzed. Minichromosomes containing ARS1 and ARS120, but not ARS121, showed an increased loss rate in the diploid containing a single copy of MCM7, compared with the diploid containing two copies of MCM7 (Fig. 1E). This haploinsufficiency of MCM7 in the maintenance of minichromosomes containing selective ARSs is similar to that observed in a heterozygous MCM2/Δ diploid (32Lei M. Kawasaki Y. Tye B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5081-5090Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Although the MCM2–MCM7 genes are transcribed periodically, reaching a peak during M/G1 phase (13Spellman P. Sherlock G. Zhang M.Q. Iyer V.R. Anders K. Eisen M.B. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Futcher B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3273-3297Crossref PubMed Scopus (3925) Google Scholar, 28Hennessy K.M. Clark C.D. Botstein D. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2252-2263Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), their protein products are present constitutively at a constant level throughout the cell cycle (33Young M. Tye B.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1587-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To investigate whether reduced MCM7 transcript level or gene dose has an effect on the Mcm7p level in the mcm1-1 mutant and the MCM7/mcm7Δ diploid, Mcm7 protein levels in mutant and wild-type extracts were compared by Western blotting. There was no measurable difference in the Mcm7p level between the mcm1-1 mutant and parent strain (Fig. 1F). Similarly, no measurable difference in the Mcm7p level was observed in the MCM7/mcm7Δ and the MCM7/MCM7 diploid (Fig. 1G). These results suggest that small changes in the MCM7 transcript level and therefore the nascent Mcm7p pool may produce significant effects on the stability of plasmids carrying specific ARSs. However, the bulk of the cellular Mcm7 protein whose accumulation is independent of gene dose or periodic expression has little effect on plasmid stability. Mcm7 Stimulates Mcm1 Binding to the MCM7 Promoter— Although Mcm7 is not known to be a transcription factor or to bind DNA, Mcm1 has been shown to bind sequences upstream of the MCM7 promoter (18Mai B. Miles S. Breeden L.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 430-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To investigate whether Mcm7 binds either alone or together with Mcm1, a 60-bp DNA fragment upstream of the MCM7 promoter was used as the binding substrate in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Mcm1 tagged either with His6 (Fig. 2A, a) or with GST (b, lane 2), and Mcm7-GST proteins (Fig. 2A, b, lane 1) were purified to greater than 90% homogeneity. Full-length Mcm1 migrates anomalously with an apparent molecular mass of ∼42 kDa (3Passmore S. Elble R. Tye B.K. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 921-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The concentrations of purified proteins were calibrated against BSA in Coomassie-stained polyacrylamide gels. We found that Mcm1-GST and Mcm1-His6 can be used interchangeably to produce similar results. Mcm7 did not bind MCM7 promoter DNA (Fig. 2B, lane 2). However, Mcm1-His6 binds the DNA fragment to form multiple Mcm1-DNA complexes (Fig. 2, B (lane 1) and C (lane 6)) with the predominant species being the highest molecular mass complex and presumably the most stable complex. These multiple species of Mcm1-DNA complexes may result from the oligomerization of Mcm1 or the binding of Mcm1 to multiple sites at the MCM7 promoter or both. To investigate the effect of Mcm7 on the binding of Mcm1 to the MCM7 promoter, Mcm7 was titrated against 6 pmol of Mcm1 (Fig. 2C, lanes 1–5). At 0.4 pmol of Mcm7, a molar ratio of 1:15 for Mcm7:Mcm1, a higher molecular mass protein DNA complex is detected (lane 5, arrowhead). Increasing amounts of Mcm7 yielded increasing amounts of all of the Mcm1-DNA complexes but the highest molecular mass species in particular (lanes 1–4). To investigate whether this protein-DNA complex results from a specific interaction among Mcm1, Mcm7, and MCM7 promoter DNA, we carried out the binding reaction in the presence of a 50-fold excess of cold competitor DNA (Fig. 2D). Binding of Mcm1 to the MCM7 promoter DNA (lane 1) is unaffected by nonspecific competitors (lane 2) but completely competed out by specific competitor DNA (lane 3). Similarly, enhanced Mcm1 binding to the MCM7 promoter DNA in the presence of Mcm7 (lane 4) is unaffected by nonspecific competitors (lane 5) but completely competed out by specific competitor DNA (lane 6). These results suggest that the interaction between Mcm1 and Mcm7 is dependent on a specific sequence on the MCM7 promoter DNA. However, the mobility of the protein-DNA complex is indifferent to the presence of Mcm7, suggesting that Mcm7 may not associate with the Mcm1-DNA complex. We are unable to detect Mcm7 in the protein-DNA complex by mobility shift using Mcm7-specific antibodies (data not shown). To investigate whether the stimulatory effect of Mcm7 is specific for Mcm1, we examined the effect of Mcm7 on the binding of another transcription factor AP2 to its recognition sequence. AP2 binds specifically to the AP2 binding sequence (Fig. 2E, lane 2). Addition of 8 pmol of Mcm7 to the AP2-DNA complex had no stimulatory effect on the binding of AP2 to AP2 DNA. We also examined the effect of BSA on Mcm1 DNA binding. Under the condition in which neither Mcm1 (Fig. 2F, lane 3) nor Mcm7 (lane 2) alone shows significant binding to the MCM7 promoter, addition of 25 pmol of Mcm7 to Mcm1 stimulates Mcm1 binding (lane 4) but addition of 25 pmol of BSA to Mcm1 does not (lane 5). On prolonged exposure, BSA appears to promote some Mcm1 binding to produce a smear (lane 5) rather than specific bands (lane 4). These results together indicate that the stimulatory effect of Mcm7 for Mcm1 is specific. To investigate the nature of the interactions between Mcm1 and Mcm7 and the MCM7 promoter, DNase 1 footprinting analysis was carried out to identify the region protected by Mcm1 alone, Mcm7 alone, or Mcm1 and Mcm7 together at saturating concentrations. Mcm1 alone shows a footprint restricted to the two 16-bp palindromic ECBs of the MCM7 promoter that had been previously identified (Fig. 2G, a, lane 1, bar to the left) (18Mai B. Miles S. Breeden L.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 430-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Although Mcm7 alone does not bind MCM7 DNA in a mobility shift assay (Fig. 2F), at a saturating concentration, Mcm7 protects the AT-rich region between the two MCEs (Fig. 2G, a, lanes 2 and 3, bar to the right). When both Mcm1 and Mcm7 were added, the footprint corresponds to the combined footprints of Mcm1 and Mcm7 (a, lanes 4 and 5, bar to the right). Mcm7 appears to augment the Mcm1 footprint without extending the size of the footprint. The corresponding nucleotide sequences of these footprints are shown in Fig. 2G, b. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and DNase 1 footprints of Mcm1 and Mcm7 suggest that, although Mcm7 facilitates the binding of Mcm1 to DNA, Mcm7 may not be part of the stable complex. Mcm7 may facilitate Mcm1 binding by transient interactions with the DNA. Alternatively, Mcm7 may bind to the Mcm1-DNA complex but cannot survive electrophoresis. To identify the Mcm7 interacting site, mutations were introduced in the intervening sequence of the two MCEs. These mutations had no effect on either Mcm1 binding or Mcm7-stimulated Mcm1 binding (data not shown). In contrast, mutations within the MCEs either reduced or abolished Mcm1 binding (data not shown). In all, we did not identify mutations that affected Mcm7 stimulation but not Mcm1 binding. We have also investigated possible physical interactions between Mcm1 and Mcm7 in the absence of DNA. Two-hybrid analysis and co-immunoprecipitation experiments failed to detect interaction between these two proteins (data not shown). The MCM7 Promoter Region Is Not Associated with a Replication Origin—Mcm7 is a subunit of the hexameric complex that is associated with replication origins. To investigate whether the association of Mcm7 w"

This process presumably involves L4 interaction with the leader mRNA. Here, we report direct, specific, and independent binding of ribosomal protein L4 to the S10 mRNA leader in vitro. Most of the binding energy is contributed by a small hairpin structure within the leader region, but a 64-nucleotide sequence is required for the bona fide interaction.

Although the secondary structures of the mRNA and rRNA binding sites appear different, phosphorothioate footprinting of the L4-RNA complexes reveals close structural similarity in three dimensions.

In vitro binding of L4 induces structural changes of the S10 leader RNA, providing a first clue for how protein L4 may provoke transcription termination. Ribosomal proteins are encoded on the bacterial chromosomes in multigene operons that facilitate stoichiometric production of the more than 50 ribosomal proteins (r-proteins). 1The abbreviations used are: r-protein, ribosomal protein; nt, nucleotide(s); BSA, bovine serum albumin; L4EC, L4 from E. coli; E. coli numbering is used if not indicated otherwise.1The abbreviations used are: r-protein, ribosomal protein; nt, nucleotide(s); BSA, bovine serum albumin; L4EC, L4 from E. coli; E. coli numbering is used if not indicated otherwise.Expression of most of these operons is translationally regulated by a single regulatory r-protein encoded by a given polycistronic mRNA. This operon-specific autogenous control mechanism is elicited when repressor r-proteins are not consumed during the assembly of ribosomal subunits. In the absence of sufficient ribosomal RNA targets, the resulting excess of “free” repressor proteins bind to their own mRNAs and block translation of the polycistronic mRNA (reviewed in Refs. 1Zengel J.M. Lindahl L. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1994; 47: 331-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar and 2Keener J. Nomura M. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1417-1431Google Scholar). R-protein L4 from Escherichia coli specifically regulates the S10 operon, which codes for 11 r-proteins including L4 itself (3Zengel J.M. Mueckl D. Lindahl L. Cell. 1980; 21: 523-535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 4Yates J.L. Nomura M. Cell. 1980; 21: 517-522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). L4 is unique among the regulatory ribosomal proteins because it regulates not only translation but also transcription of the S10 operon mRNA. The latter form of regulation is accomplished by L4 stimulation of transcription termination at a terminator (attenuator) structure in the mRNA upstream of the initiation codon of the first gene of the operon (5Lindahl L. Archer R. Zengel J.M. Cell. 1983; 33: 241-248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Determinants necessary for L4-mediated autogenous control are contained within a 172-nucleotide 5′-untranslated region of the S10 operon mRNA. This region folds into six stem-loop structures termed helices HA, HB, HC, HD, HE, and HG (Fig. 1A) (6Shen P. Zengel J.M. Lindahl L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 8905-8924Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 7Allen T. Shen P. Samsel L. Liu R. Lindahl L. Zengel J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6124-6132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mRNA sequences necessary for L4-mediated transcription and translation control overlap, but are not identical (8Freedman L.P. Zengel J.M. Archer R.H. Lindahl L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6516-6520Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 9Zengel J.M. Lindahl L. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Helix HE and the unstructured sequence immediately downstream of this hairpin are necessary for translational control, whereas helices HD and HE are required for transcriptional control (8Freedman L.P. Zengel J.M. Archer R.H. Lindahl L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6516-6520Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 10Sha Y. Lindahl L. Zengel J.M. J. Mol.

L4-stimulated transcription termination occurs within the U cluster (nt 139–149) (9Zengel J.M. Lindahl L. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) in helix HE, which resembles a Rho-independent terminator. In vitro transcription experiments (10Sha Y. Lindahl L. Zengel J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 486-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 12Sha Y. Lindahl L. Zengel J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 474-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) suggest that the transcription attenuation process involves three ordered steps: (i) spontaneous pausing of the RNA polymerase at the attenuation site, (ii) NusA-mediated stabilization of the pause, and (iii) additional stabilization of the pause involving protein L4 that leads to transcription termination. Binding of a regulatory r-protein to specific targets in both rRNA and mRNA is fundamental to the autogenous control model (13Nomura M. Yates J.L. Dean D. Post L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 7084-7088Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The minimal rRNA target of L4, identified by serial selection of random E. coli rRNA fragments binding to L4 (14Stelzl U. Spahn C.M.T. Nierhaus K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4597-4602Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), is a four-helix junction composed of nucleotides 295–343 in Domain I of the 23 S rRNA. Binding of protein L4 to this RNA sequence generates a characteristic iodine cleavage pattern in the U321-loop of 23 S rRNA (15Stelzl U. Nierhaus K.H. RNA. 2001; 7: 598-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the same region of 23 S rRNA competes with the paused transcription complex for L4, eliminating the ability of the protein to stimulate transcription termination (16Zengel J.M. Lindahl L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2429-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These results show that binding of 23 S rRNA to L4 inactivates the regulatory capacity of the protein and suggest that the 23 S rRNA and mRNA binding sites for L4 might share certain critical features. However, mutations in protein L4 can distinguish its ability to regulate the expression of the S10 operon from its ability to be incorporated into the ribosome (17Li X. Lindahl L. Zengel J.M. RNA. 1996; 2: 24-37PubMed Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate direct binding of r-protein L4 to the S10 mRNA leader. Furthermore, we analyze the requirements in the RNA binding site for L4 binding. Footprinting results indicate structural changes of the leader RNA upon binding, and reveal structural similarities between the rRNA and mRNA L4 binding sites. A structure model for the L4-mRNA interaction is proposed. Protein Expression and Purification—Protein L4 from E. coli (L4EC) was purified from 50 S subunits as described (18Diedrich G. Burkhardt N. Nierhaus K.H. Protein Expr. Purif. 1997; 10: 42-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The clone of the full-length Thermus aquaticus L4 protein was a kind gift from Dr. Alexander Mankin (University of Illinois, Chicago, IL). Protein L4THD7 is a variant of T. aquaticus L4 with a deletion in which 46 amino acids (Thr46 to Lys91, corresponding to Thr43 to Arg88 in E. coli, Fig. 1B) were replaced with a single glycine. The gene was cloned into pET29b (Novagen), protein L4THD7 was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) and purified from the soluble cell extract via affinity chromatography on Ni2+-agarose (Qiagen). The histidine tag was cleaved off with thrombin and the resulting L4THD7 protein was further purified via ion exchange chromatography where it eluted from a Mono S column (Amersham Biosciences) at 270 mm KCl. The protein was >95% pure and did not exhibit RNase activity. In Vivo Regulatory Studies—The regulatory capacity of the T. aquaticus L4 proteins was determined as described (7Allen T. Shen P. Samsel L. Liu R. Lindahl L. Zengel J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6124-6132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A C-terminal 6-histidine tag (no thrombin cleavage site) was introduced into both L4TH (wt) and L4THD7 genes, and the genes were placed under control of an arabinose-inducible promoter in a pBAD18 derivative. The plasmids were introduced into E. coli K12 strain LL308 containing target plasmid pACYC-S10′/′lacZ or pACYC-ΔHD-S10′/′lacZ. Plasmid pACYC-S10′/′lacZ contains the entire E. coli S10 leader and proximal 54 codons of the S10 structural gene, fused in-frame with a lacZ gene (lacking the proximal 8 codons), and under control of the isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible trc promoter. This plasmid contains the regulatory signals necessary for both transcription and translation control of β-galactosidase synthesis by r-protein L4 (19Li X. Lindahl L. Sha Y. Zengel J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7046-7054Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pACYC-ΔHD-S10′/′lacZ is a derivative of pACYC-S10′/′lacZ that has a deletion of the S10 leader hairpin HD eliminating L4-mediated transcription control (11Zengel J.M. Lindahl L. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2383-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). S10 Leader mRNA Constructs—Plasmid pT724 (which encodes the entire S10 operon leader and proximal one and a half structural genes (6Shen P. Zengel J.M. Lindahl L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 8905-8924Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar)) was used as PCR template to amplify various parts of the S10 leader mRNA. The PCR products were cloned into the BamHI/EcoRI site of pSP65 (Promega). The 5′(+) primer introduced a T7 promotor, and the 3′(–) primer introduced a restriction site for linearization of the plasmid for run-off T7 RNA polymerase transcription (20Stelzl U. Spahn C.M.T. Nierhaus K.H. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 318: 251-268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We used constructs with transcription starts at four sites of the leader: (i) at HA with G1 as the first nucleotide, (ii) at HE with the start at GGG-C86, (iii) at HD with the start at GG-A62, and (iv) at HD with the start at GG-A64 (Fig. 1, green arrows). The two nucleotide differences in the latter two constructs had no effect on the experimental results reported. The 3′ termini of the RNA transcripts were generated by digestion of the templates with restriction enzymes SspI (after helix HC at U66), SnaBI (after HD at C86), BsaI (in the lower HE at C100), HpaI (C125 after the upper HE at C125), DraI (after HE at U147), or SmaI (after HG at C197) (Fig. 1A, red brackets). We also made a construct encoding a transcript with a hammerhead generating the C125 end. Nitrocellulose Filter Binding Assays—Nitrocellulose filtration assays, described in Ref. 20Stelzl U. Spahn C.M.T. Nierhaus K.H. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 318: 251-268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, were done in 300-μl reactions containing 20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5), 4 mm MgCl2, 4 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 200–400 mm NH4Cl, RNase-free BSA and tRNA bulk (as indicated). Binding data were fitted to single site hyperbolic curves (Fig. 1, upper panel). In competition assays, the L4 concentration was 0.67 μm and 32P-labeled RNA A–G (500–1500 dpm/pmol) was 0.33 μm. Under these conditions about 22 pmol of complex was collected on the nitrocellulose filter. Competitor (i.e. non-labeled) RNA was added to labeled RNA A–G before the refolding step. Competition data were fitted with the program Sigma Plot according to Equation 5 of Lin and Riggs (21Lin S.-Y. Riggs A.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 72: 671-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) solved for the fraction of labeled RNA bound (Fig. 1, middle and lower panel). Gel Shift Assays—A 15-μl sample of an RNA-protein complex containing 75 pmol of [32P]RNA and the indicated amount of protein L4 was prepared by incubating for 15 min at 37 °C (20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.4), 100 mm NH4Cl,4mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol) and then chilling on ice. The sample was loaded onto a buffered (20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.4), 100 mm NH4Cl, 4 mm MgCl2) 5% acrylamide/bisacrylamide (29/1) gel (0.75 × 130 × 170 mm). The gel was run at 110 V for2hat4 °Candthe electrode buffer was recirculated between the electrode chambers with a pump. The gels were dried and exposed on a phosphoimaging plate (Fuji) for quantification. Iodine Footprinting—The experiments were done as described previously for the complex of ribosomal RNA with protein L4 (15Stelzl U. Nierhaus K.H. RNA. 2001; 7: 598-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Phosphorothioated RNA was produced by including S p-[α-S]NTPs (PerkinElmer Life Sciences and Glen Research) in the T7 RNA polymerase transcription assay. The L4 concentration was 0.67 μm and that of 32P-labeled phosphorothioated RNA was 0.33 μm or vice versa (the yield of complex was identical in both experiments). As seen in some experiments, the mRNA fragments tend to break at C38-A39 and C63-A64 even in the absence of iodine, and at G80-A81 in the presence of L4THD7. However, in general control experiments carried out without addition of iodine did not result in cleavages. Binding of Protein L4EC to the S10 mRNA Leader RNA in Vitro—To analyze L4 interaction with the S10 leader, we modified the strategy previously used to demonstrate L4 binding to its target in Domain I of 23 S rRNA. Ribosomal protein L4EC was incubated with 32P-labeled S10 leader RNA, or, as a control, its known target in 23 S rRNA, and subjected to nitrocellulose filtration. The results in Fig. 2 (top panel) demonstrated that the full-length leader mRNA (A-G, 1–197C) bound r-protein L4 with an apparent K D of about 700 nm (in 4 mm MgCl2, 250 mm NH4Cl; binding was strongly dependent on the ionic condition). The affinity is in the same range as reported for the S4-α mRNA (22Schlax P.J. Xavier K.A. Gluick T.C. Draper D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38494-38501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and the S7-str mRNA interaction (23Robert F. Brakier-Gingras L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 677-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The interaction of L4 with the full-length S10 leader mRNA was about 4-fold weaker than with its cognate rRNA target in Domain I of 23 S rRNA (GG295–343CC; rRNA-DI, 53 nt) (14Stelzl U. Spahn C.M.T. Nierhaus K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4597-4602Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Control RNAs such as G600-C657 from Domain II of 23 S rRNA (rRNA-DII) did not bind, even though this part of the 23 S rRNA contains a site that cross-links to L4 in the intact ribosome (24Osswald M. Greuer B. Brimacombe R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6755-6760Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Other control RNAs, e.g. fragments of ribosomal RNA of various lengths (50 to 170 nt), also failed to bind r-protein L4 (data not shown). Likewise, the sequence comprising the first three helices from the beginning of the S10 leader sequence did not bind (Fig. 2 top, A–C, 1–66). This result suggests that the S10 leader contains one or more sites for L4 binding downstream of the HC hairpin. Because many highly positively charged ribosomal proteins, such as L4, bind with considerable strength to nonspecific RNAs (e.g. Refs. 25Serganov A.A. Masquida B. Westhof E. Cachia C. Portier C. Garber M. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. RNA. 1996; 2: 1124-1138PubMed Google Scholar and 26Gerstner R.B. Pak Y. Draper D.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7165-7173Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we tested the specificity of L4 binding to the S10 leader by competition experiments (Fig. 2, middle panel). As expected, non-radioactive S10 leader RNA (A–G) competes with binding of radioactive leader RNA. In contrast, addition of a 218-nt mRNA molecule that contains the interaction site for r-protein S15 in the translational regulation of the rpsO operon (27Philippe C. Portier C. Mougel M. Grunberg-Manago M. Ebel J.P. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) did not affect complex formation between the cognate S10 leader mRNA and L4. Thus, the affinity of L4 for the S10 leader mRNA is significantly higher than its affinity for a noncognate r-operon mRNA, indicating that the L4-S10 leader interaction is specific. On the other hand, the rRNA binding site of ribosomal protein L4 (RNA-DI) strongly competes with binding to the S10 leader mRNA (Fig. 2, middle). Not assuming allosteric effects, this observation is consistent with the hypothesis that the L4 binding sites on 23 S rRNA Domain I and the S10 leader share significant structural features. To define the binding site more precisely, we tested various S10 leader mRNA subdomains in the competition experiments (Fig. 2, bottom panel). Most intriguingly, the mRNA fragments that do not contain helix HD, such as A–C (66 nt), E (65 nt), and E–G (116 nt), do not inhibit complex formation, whereas the isolated helix HD (D, 27 nt) competes significantly. All other constructs containing HD (viz. A–D (86 nt), D–E (88 nt), and D–G (139 nt)) compete to the same extent as the full-length A–G (198 nt). Consistent with data indicating the importance of helix HD in L4-dependent transcription regulation (11Zengel J.M. Lindahl L. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2383-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 28Zengel J.M. Sha Y. Lindahl L. RNA. 2002; 8: 572-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), these experiments suggest that helix HD contributes the most to the specificity of L4 binding. T. aquaticus Protein L4 Actively Regulates E. coli S10 Operon Expression—Protein L4 from E. coli is not well suited for in vitro binding experiments, because (i) it has to be purified under denaturating conditions either from ribosomes or from inclusion bodies, (ii) it is relatively unstable, (iii) the solubility even in high salt buffers is very low (<50 μm), and (iv) it aggregates even at low concentrations. For example, in gel-shift experiments RNA-L4EC complexes form aggregates that remain for the most part in the gel pocket (not shown). To circumvent these problems we combined two strategies to develop a better behaved protein. First, because L4 proteins from many other eubacteria regulate the E. coli S10 operon (7Allen T. Shen P. Samsel L. Liu R. Lindahl L. Zengel J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6124-6132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Li X. Lindahl L. Sha Y. Zengel J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7046-7054Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we switched to L4 from T. aquaticus (L4TH), which is 34% identical and 50% similar to L4 from E. coli (Fig. 1B). Proteins from such thermophilic bacterial species have proven to be beneficial for other biochemical and biophysical experiments. Second, we deleted 46 amino acids that, in the ribosome, form an extension protruding into the core from a globular domain located on the surface of the ribosome (29Ban N. Nissen P. Hansen J. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. Science. 2000; 289: 905-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (2794) Google Scholar, 30Harms J. Schluenzen F. Zarivach R. Bashan A. Gat S. Agmon I. Bartels H. Franceschi F. Yonath A. Cell. 2001; 107: 679-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar) (cf. Figs. 1B and 4C). In free L4 protein (from Thermotoga maritima) the corresponding amino acids are not organized into a particular structure (31Worbs M. Huber R. Wahl M.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 807-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and hence might contribute to the aggregation problem. Indeed, the deletion of this region in E. coli L4 generates a protein that retains its capacity for regulating the S10 operon, but is more soluble than the full-length protein. 2J. M. Zengel and L. Lindahl, manuscript in preparation. Therefore, we constructed similar deletion derivatives of the T. aquaticus L4 and screened them for solubility and thermostability. A deletion between Gly45 and Pro92 of L4TH (corresponding to Gly42–Pro89 in L4EC) rendered the protein (called L4THD7) very soluble and stable. Before using L4THD7 for S10 mRNA binding studies we confirmed that the protein is active in inducing autogenous control in E. coli. First, E. coli cells carrying plasmids with either L4TH or L4THD7 under control of an arabinose-inducible promoter could not form colonies on plates containing arabinose, presumably because the induced T. aquaticus L4 proteins reduce expression of the 11 r-protein genes in the E. coli S10 operon, thereby blocking synthesis of ribosomes. Second, we analyzed the ability of the T. aquaticus L4 proteins to inhibit expression of S10′/′lacZ reporter genes. Induced synthesis of the full-length L4TH protein or the deletion protein (L4THD7) reduced about 3-fold the expression of an S10′/′lacZ gene downstream of the wild type S10 leader (Table I). This result demonstrates a substantial regulatory effect of the T. aquaticus L4 proteins, although the regulation is less than that of the native L4 protein. Moreover, a target plasmid containing a deletion of leader hairpin HD, which is required for E. coli L4-mediated transcription control, was much less responsive (Table I), suggesting that the L4TH proteins regulate transcription, and, like E. coli L4, require the HD hairpin. Taken together, these results show that L4THD7 is a valuable analogue of the E. coli L4 with respect to repression of the E. coli S10 operon and has the desired solubility characteristics. Highly purified protein L4THD7 was therefore used for further in vitro studies.Table IIn vivo analysis of autogenous regulation by T. aquaticus L4 in E. coliL4 proteinL4 regulation of S10L-S10′/′lacZL4 regulation of S10LΔHD-S10′/′lacZL4EC0.09 (±0.02)0.54 (±0.02)L4TH0.31 (±0.03)0.71 (±0.06)L4THD70.41 (±0.07)0.81 (±0.06) Open table in a new tab RNA Determinants for L4 Binding—To determine a minimal binding site in the S10 leader mRNA, RNA leader fragments were assayed for binding to L4THD7 in gel shift assays (Fig. 3). S10 leader mRNA fragment D (GG62–86) does not bind to protein L4 in the gel shift experiment, and there is almost no binding to the D-loE fragment (GG64–100). The presence of helix E appears to be more important in the band shift assays than apparent from the nitrocellulose filtration experiments (cf. Fig. 2, bottom), because a little binding activity is seen with the complete helix E stem-loop structure (E, GGG86–147). Nevertheless, the minimal mRNA that shows high affinity binding is D-upE (64 nt), comprising nucleotides GG64–125 (Fig. 3, top). The binding of the D-upE part to L4THD7 determined by nitrocellulose filter binding is shown in Fig. 1 for comparison (upper panel, black squares). Binding is about 2-fold weaker than binding of L4EC to the full-length mRNA fragment. Together with HD, the upper helix HE (nt 100–125) is strictly required for high affinity L4 interaction. The D-ΔupE mRNA fragment, which shortcuts helix HE by connecting C100 and G132 with a UUGC-tetraloop (Fig. 1A), does not bind (cf. D–E and D-ΔupE in Fig. 3, middle). The primary sequence requirements of the upper HE are not strict, because replacement of the upHE-loop with an U1A-loop (Fig. 1A) retains significant affinity for L4 (D-U1AupE in Fig. 3, middle). The gel shift experiments with the L4THD7 are in good agreement with the nitrocellulose filtrations where full-length L4EC has been used, although the apparent dissociation constants are higher. However, gel shift assays are known to generate apparent K D values up to 1 order of magnitude higher than filter binding assays (32Draper D.E. Deckman I.C. Vartikar J.V. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 164: 203-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Similar to the nitrocellulose competition experiments presented above, A–D and D–G bind to L4THD7 in the gel shift system (not shown). Furthermore, binding is stronger with the cognate ribosomal binding site (RNA-DI) and no binding can be detected with the dispensable A–C part of the S10 leader mRNA (Fig. 3, bottom). In summary, a minimal 64-nt fragment comprising HD, the ascending side of HE, and the upper HE helix is sufficient for high affinity binding of protein L4. L4-S10 Leader mRNA Contacts Monitored by Iodine Footprinting—Iodine cleavage of phosphorothioated RNA is a useful tool for examining in detail RNA-protein interactions (15Stelzl U. Nierhaus K.H. RNA. 2001; 7: 598-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 33Verma S. Eckstein F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 99-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 34Strobel S.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To execute such experiments one α-phosphorothioate nucleotide (A, C, G, or U) per 5′-32P-labeled transcript molecule, on average, was introduced to RNA via T7 in vitro transcription. The phosphorothioate S10 leader transcripts were used for two types of experiments. In an interference experiment, RNA-protein complexes were formed with phosphorothioate-containing RNA and isolated by binding to nitrocellulose filters. The RNA was then extracted, cleaved with iodine, and subjected to gel electrophoresis. A band that is weakened or missing on the gel indicates that the presence of a phosphorothioate moiety at the corresponding position impairs or prevents the formation of the RNA-protein complex. In a protection experiment, the RNA is cleaved in the complex preceding its isolation. A weakened or absent band in this experiment indicates that iodine does not have free access to the corresponding phosphorothioate in the backbone of the RNA, i.e. the position is protected from iodine cleavage. In this way protein interactions with the non-bridging Rp-oxygens of the RNA phosphate backbone can be mapped with atomic resolution. Full-length S10 leader A–G and the two S10 leader fragments A–D and D–G were probed in complex with protein L4EC. Additionally, protein L4THD7 has been footprinted in complex with the minimal D-upE mRNA fragment, resulting in a pattern similar to that obtained with protein L4EC on the larger fragments. Fig. 4A shows a section of the iodine cleavage pattern of the D–G region that contains all determinants necessary for transcription and translation control by L4. Taken together, all signals are located in helices HD and HE clearly monitoring the L4 binding site. Protein L4EC shows strong interference with 5′-phosphorothiolated U75, C76, C86, and to C94 (Fig. 4B, stars), and weaker interference at the positions C72, A73, G78, and A99. These same regions are also protected. Non-bridging Rp-oxygens 5′ to the following nucleotides are protected against iodine cleavage in the complex with L4EC: U66, G67 (note: not shown in Fig. 4A), U69, and A74 in the 5′-strand of helix HD; in A81/85, C86-U88, A90-G95, and U97-A99 starting from HD extending to the 5′ strand of lower helix HE and, finally, C111, C115, U117, U124, and G132 (not shown) in the upper helix HE (Fig. 4B, dots). The signals cover almost every phosphate in the backbone of the 5′ part of loHE up to C100. This extensive protection could either be due to direct protein contact in this region or to structural changes induced by L4 binding to the HD region (see “Discussion”). However, the footprint in the loop of helix HD displays very characteristic protein-RNA contacts. Interestingly, the two interference sites 5′ and 3′ to U75 (Fig. 4B, red stars) are strongly reminiscent of the footprinting pattern of rRNA-DI in complex with L4, where O to S substitutions 5′ and 3′ to U321 abolish the binding of L4 (14Stelzl U. Spahn C.M.T. Nierhaus K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4597-4602Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4B, inset). The three phosphates 5′ to A74 and A320 and G78 and A324 are protected in the mRNA and the rRNA, respectively (Fig. 4B, red dots). Although the secondary structures are different, these data raise the intriguing possibility that helix HD of the S10 leader is a close three-dimensional mimic of the rRNA binding site (U321-loop, Fig. 4B). Mutational Analysis of the HD Loop—Because the footprinting data suggested direct L4 binding to the loop of hairpin HD, and because the pattern was strongly reminiscent of the interaction of L4 with its rRNA target, we analyzed the sequence requirements for L4 interaction with hairpin HD in more detail.

Previous studies have suggested that this selective PKCθ recruitment may operate via a Vav-regulated, cytoskeletal-dependent mechanism, independent of the classical phospholipase C/diacylglycerol pathway. Here, we demonstrate that, together with tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCθ in the regulatory domain, binding of phospholipase C-dependent diacylglycerol is required for PKCθ recruitment to the T cell synapse.

Bromley S.K. Sumen C. Davis M.M. Shaw A.S. Allen P.M. Dustin M.L. Science. 1999; 285: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2529) Google Scholar) governs lymphocyte responsiveness. The molecular signaling complex formed at the cell-cell contact site triggers a cascade of biochemical events, culminating in cell proliferation and the execution of T cell effector functions (2Kane L.P. Lin J. Weiss A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). An important consequence of T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation is phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1) activation. This enzyme is recruited to the membrane by adaptor proteins and is also activated directly by tyrosine phosphorylation (3Finco T.S. Kadlecek T. Zhang W. Samelson L.E. Weiss A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 617-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 4Secrist J.P. Karnitz L. Abraham R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12135-12139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activated enzyme hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate to inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate, which stimulates Ca2+ release from intracellular stores and to diacylglycerol (DAG). The importance of Ca2+ and DAG in T cell activation was demonstrated several years ago, when it was shown that a combination of Ca2+ ionophore and phorbol esters, which function as DAG analogues, could mimic TCR signals, leading to full T cell activation (5Truneh A. Albert F. Golstein P. Schmitt-Verhulst A.M. Nature. 1985; 313: 318-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). The relevance of PLC-γ1 in TCR signals was further highlighted by the impaired TCR activation in PLC-γ1-deficient cell lines (6Irvin B.J. Williams B.L. Nilson A.E. Maynor H.O. Abraham R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9149-9161Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Similarly, mutations in the T cell adapter LAT, which prevents PLC-γ1 recruitment and activation (3Finco T.S. Kadlecek T. Zhang W. Samelson L.E. Weiss A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 617-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), abrogate expression of several T cell activation-associated genes, including interleukin-2 (IL-2) (7Crabtree G.R. Science. 1989; 243: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). PLC-γ1-dependent Ca2+ elevation activates the phosphatase calcineurin, leading to dephosphorylation of the transcription factor NF-AT (8Clipstone N.A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 357: 695-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1470) Google Scholar). The exact role of PLC-γ-generated DAG nonetheless remains a matter of controversy. According to conventional models of TCR signaling, cell responses to increased DAG are due to protein kinase C (PKC) activation (9Alberola-lla J. Takaki S. Kerner J.D. Perlmutter R.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 125-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The recent discovery of RasGRP, a Ras guanine exchange factor containing a DAG-binding C1-like domain, has nevertheless established a direct link between TCR-mediated PLC-γ1 activation and the Ras-extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway (10Ebinu J.O. Stang S.L. Teixeira C. Bottorff D.A. Hooton J. Blumberg P.M. Barry M. Bleakley R.C. Ostergaard H.L. Stone J.C. Blood. 2000; 95: 3199-3203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Is well established that DAG generation is responsible for membrane translocation and activation of classical and novel PKC family members (11Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4219) Google Scholar, 12Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). T lymphocytes express several classical and novel PKC isoforms, although only the novel isoform PKCθ is selectively recruited to the immunological synapse (13Monks C.R. Kupfer R.F. Tamir H. Barlow I. Kupfer A. Nature. 1997; 385: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Analysis of PKCθ knockout mice showed the importance of this isoform in regulating TCR-derived signals and demonstrated the requirement for PKCθ in activating the downstream elements AP-1, NF-κB, and IL-2 in T cells (14Sun Z. Arendt C.W. Ellmeier W. Schaeffer E.M. Sunshine M.J. Gandhi L. Annes J. Petrzilka D. Kupfer A. Schwartzberg P.L. Littman D.R. Nature. 2000; 404: 402-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). There is thus great interest in dissecting the mechanism underlying selective PKCθ recruitment to TCR contact sites during antigen stimulation. Recent experiments suggested that PKCθ recruitment to the cell membrane is mediated by Vav/Rac activation through a PLC-γ-independent mechanism that involves cytoskeletal reorganization (15Bi K. Tanaka Y. Coudronniere N. Sugie K. Hong S. van Stipdonk M.J. Altman A. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 556-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 16Cao Y. Janssen E.M. Duncan A.W. Altman A.

Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, analysis of Vav1-deficient mice showed that during T cell activation, this exchange factor for Rac acts as an upstream regulator of PLC-γ1 (20Reynolds L.F. Smyth L.A. Norton T. Freshney N. Downward J. Kioussis D. Tybulewicz V.L. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 1103-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). According to these results, PLC-mediated DAG generation would be a direct consequence of Vav-dependent cytoskeletal reorganization, making it difficult to assess the specific contribution of DAG generation among Vav-regulated signals. Here we used several approaches to evaluate the exact contribution of PLC-γ-dependent DAG generation in the control of TCR-mediated PKCθ recruitment and activation. We used pharmacological inhibitors, PKCθ mutants, and expression of constitutive active or transdominant negative forms of DGKα, which acts as a negative modulator of DAG levels, to show that tyrosine phosphorylation of and DAG binding to PKCθ are indispensable for selective PKCθ recruitment to the immunological synapse in T lymphocytes. Reagents—Antibodies used included anti-PKCθ (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-human CD69, phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-human CD25, purified anti-human CD3 and CD28 (PharMingen, San Diego, CA), anti-phosphotyrosine (clone 4G10; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), and horseradish peroxidase-goat anti-mouse IgG (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). Polystyrene 15-μm microspheres were purchased from Polysciences, Inc. (Warrington, PA); the ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences) was used according to manufacturer's instructions. U73122, U73343, calphostin, rottlerin, and PP2 were purchased from Calbiochem; phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu), carbachol, bisindolylmaleimide I hydrochloride, and poly-l-lysine were from Sigma. Recombinant Plasmids—The plasmid encoding EGFP-PKCθ under a pEF promoter was generated by excising PKCθ from the PKCθ-EGFP construct (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) with XhoI and SacII (this end was blunted). The 2.1-kb fragment encoding the PKCθ cDNA was subcloned in the pEGFP-Bos vector (pEGFP-PKCθ) at the EGFP C terminus. To generate mutant constructs, Tyr90 was replaced by Phe or Asp using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene and appropriate oligonucleotides. The kinase-dead and membrane-targeted versions of DGKα fused to EGFP have been described (21Sanjuan M.A. Jones D.R. Izquierdo M. Merida I. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfection—The JHM1–2.2 cell line was generated by stable transfection of the human muscarinic subtype 1 receptor in the Jurkat leukemic human T cell line (22Desai D.M. Newton M.E. Kadlecek T. Weiss A. Nature. 1990; 348: 66-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Jurkat and JHM1–2.2 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 10 mm Hepes, and 100 μg/ml each penicillin and streptomycin (complete medium). Cells in exponential growth were electroporated with 20 μgof DNA constructs using a Gene Pulser (270 V, 975 microfarads; Bio-Rad). Cells were immediately transferred to 30 ml of complete medium and assayed after 24 h. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Jurkat T cells (2 × 106) were seeded on 6-well plates precoated with a 1:1 mixture of anti-CD3/CD28 antibody (final concentration 10 μg/ml each) in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8. After 15 min, cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2 mm EDTA, 200 μm Na3VO4, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm NaPP, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and cleared by centrifugation. Protein lysates (200 μg) were incubated with the indicated antibodies (2 μg, 1 h, 4 °C) followed by protein A-Sepharose (1 h, 4 °C). Immunoprecipitated complexes were washed, and proteins were separated in SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, incubated with the indicated antibody, and developed using the ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Blood Collection and Lymphocyte Purification—Blood was drawn from healthy volunteers. Buffy coat (40 ml) was overlaid on a Ficoll-Hypaque gradient (1:2) and centrifuged, and the lymphocyte-containing interface band was collected and washed with serum-free RPMI 1640 medium. The cell pellet was suspended in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal calf serum, and cells were counted in a Neubauer hemocytometer. Anti-CD3/CD28 Stimulation and Immunofluorescence—Cells were harvested 24–36 h after electroporation. For anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation, slides were precoated with a 1:1 mixture of anti-CD3/CD28 antibody (final concentration 10 μg/ml each) in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8. Lymphocytes were plated onto slides and examined by confocal microscopy after 15 min. For pharmacological inhibition, cells were pretreated (30 min) with inhibitors before plating onto anti-CD3/CD28-coated slides. For stimulation with antibody-coated microspheres, antibodies were adsorbed to microspheres by mixing 0.5 μg of antibody in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.5 × 106 microspheres (final volume 1 ml) and incubating (1.5 h, room temperature) with continuous mixing; 1.5 ml of 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS was added, and mixing continued (30 min). Microspheres were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline. For stimulation, 106 transfected cells were mixed with antibody-coated beads at a 2:1 cell/bead ratio and plated on chambered slides. A time series of images was captured by confocal microscopy. Analysis of Cell Surface CD69 or CD25 Expression—Cells were plated in anti-CD3/CD28-coated 6-well plates. Cell surface CD69 or CD25 expression was analyzed 20 h later using phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-human CD69 or phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-human CD25 monoclonal antibody. Immunofluorescence intensity of cells was determined by flow cytometry (EPICS-XL; Beckman Coulter). For inhibitor treatment, cells were incubated with vehicle or inhibitors for 30 min and then plated as above. For analysis of CD69 expression in transfected cells, cells were seeded 24 h after transfection onto anti-CD3/CD28-coated plates, and CD69 expression was analyzed after 6 or 20 h, gating for green fluorescent protein-positive and -negative cells. Calcium Determination—Cells were cultured in complete medium, harvested, centrifuged (5 min, 20,000 × g), and then resuspended in 1 ml of complete medium at 106 cells/ml. Fluo-3AM (10 μl) was added to 106 cells (6 μm) and mixed (37 °C, 25 min). Cells were washed twice and resuspended (5 × 105 cells/ml) in complete medium containing 2 mm CaCl2 and incubated (37 °C, 5 min), and fluorescence intensity was measured by flow cytometry following anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation. PKCθ is the only PKC isoform recruited to the immunological synapse after TCR stimulation, suggesting that its activation mechanism differs from that of the other isoforms. To assess the changes in subcellular PKCθ location following TCR stimulation in intact T cells, we generated an EGFP-PKCθ construct. When transiently transfected Jurkat cells were stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28-coated polystyrene beads, this construct translocated to the cell-bead contact zone (Fig. 1A), as described for the endogenous PKCθ. To analyze the specificity of the PKCθ recruitment mechanism in response to TCR engagement, protein translocation was evaluated in JHM1–2.2, a Jurkat subcell line stably transfected with the human muscarinic type I receptor. Carbachol stimulation of these cells induces DAG-dependent activation signals through PLC-β activation (22Desai D.M. Newton M.E. Kadlecek T. Weiss A. Nature. 1990; 348: 66-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). As in the parental Jurkat line, PKCθ translocated to the membrane when these cells were stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28-coated beads (not shown) or with immobilized anti-CD3/CD28 antibody (Fig. 1B, upper panel). Under these conditions, some perinuclear localization was also seen. Cell treatment with the Src-like kinase-specific inhibitor PP2 (23Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.-S. Brissette W.H.

Translocation was also observed after carbachol stimulation, but, in this case, PP2 treatment did not prevent membrane localization of the EGFP-PKCθ construct (Fig. 1B, lower panel). CD69 is a lymphocyte activation marker; its expression is DAG-mediated and correlates with PKCθ activation (17Villalba M. Coudronniere N. Deckert M. Teixeiro E. Mas P. Altman A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 151-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 24Isakov N. Altman A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 761-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). We thus analyzed PKCθ activation by measuring CD69 expression. Cell surface CD69 expression increased in response to both TCR and human muscarinic type I receptor stimulation (Fig. 1C). As for EGFP-PKCθ membrane translocation, PP2 treatment of cells prevented CD69 expression in response to anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation but did not affect CD69 induction after carbachol stimulation. This validates the use of CD69 expression as an indicator of PKCθ translocation. To assess the contribution of DAG generation to PKCθ translocation, EGFP-PKCθ translocation was determined in intact Jurkat cells following treatment with various pharmacological inhibitors known to interfere with DAG-based signals. Treatment with the PLC-γ inhibitor U73122 prevented EGFP-PKCθ translocation to the membrane, indicating that PLC-γ-dependent DAG generation is essential for membrane localization (Fig. 2A). The addition of calphostin C, which competes with PKCs for the DAG binding site, also impeded EGFP-PKCθ membrane translocation after TCR engagement (Fig. 2A). Finally, treatment with the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I hydrochloride (25Way K.J. Chou E. King G.L. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 181-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) did not affect PKCθ translocation (Fig. 2A), indicating that activity of other PKC isoforms is not involved in PKCθ translocation. Although translocation to the plasma membrane is blocked by U73122 and calphostin C, EGFP-PKCθ appears to remain associated to internal membranes (Fig. 2A). In response to TCR triggering, PKCθ is tyrosine-phosphorylated and can be detected in anti-Tyr(P) immunopellets (26Liu Y. Witte S. Liu Y.C. Doyle M. Elly C. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3603-3609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Inhibition of PLC-γ activation did not alter the amount of PKCθ immunoprecipitated by anti-Tyr(P) after TCR stimulation (Fig. 2B). PLC-γ inhibition thus blocks PKCθ translocation, without affecting Lck-mediated PKCθ Tyr phosphorylation or its recruitment to Tyr-phosphorylated protein complexes. To correlate PKCθ membrane translocation with its biological activity, we examined CD69 expression after PLC-γ inhibition. Following U73122 treatment, CD69 expression was severely impaired, to an extent similar to that seen after PP2 inhibition (Fig. 2C). To demonstrate that DAG-dependent PKCθ activation is a physiological mechanism in the lymphocyte immune response and is not cell line-specific, similar experiments were performed using peripheral blood lymphocytes (Fig. 3A). Both blockade of PLC-γ activation and treatment with the PKCθ-specific inhibitor rottlerin (25Way K.J. Chou E. King G.L. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 181-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) block CD69 up-regulation. This supports the finding that PLC-γ-mediated DAG production also controls CD69 expression in human lymphocytes via PKCθ activation. PKCθ regulates lymphocyte activation through expression of the transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1 and subsequent induction of the IL-2 and CD25 genes (14Sun Z. Arendt C.W. Ellmeier W. Schaeffer E.M. Sunshine M.J. Gandhi L. Annes J. Petrzilka D. Kupfer A. Schwartzberg P.L. Littman D.R. Nature. 2000; 404: 402-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar, 24Isakov N. Altman A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 761-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 27Lin X. O'Mahony A. Mu Y. Geleziunas R. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2933-2940Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 28Coudronniere N. Villalba M. Englund N. Altman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3394-3399PubMed Google Scholar). Specific inhibition of PLC-γ or PKCθ diminished surface CD25 expression and impaired lymphocyte progression to later activation stages (Fig. 3B). It has been proposed that PKCθ Tyr90 is the phosphorylatable residue in response to TCR activation (26Liu Y. Witte S. Liu Y.C. Doyle M. Elly C. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3603-3609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To assess the specific contribution of Tyr phosphorylation in TCR-elicited PKCθ translocation, two EGFP-PKCθ mutants were prepared. In one, Tyr90 was replaced by Phe, preventing protein phosphorylation; in the other, Tyr90 was replaced with Asp, which mimics the negative charge of phosphorylated Tyr, simulating phosphorylation at this residue. When analyzed by confocal microscopy, the EGFP-PKCθ(Y90F) protein did not translocate to the membrane after TCR stimulation (Fig. 4A). The EGFP-PKCθ(Y90D) mutant was found in cytosol in unstimulated cells, and translocation was observed only after TCR engagement (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, PP2 inhibition of the Lck pathway or U73122 inhibition of DAG generation also blocked EGFP-PKCθ(Y90D) translocation following stimulation. Earlier studies ruled out DAG requirement for PKCθ translocation, based on the observation that this protein is found at the membrane after TCR stimulation in a PLC-γ1-deficient Jurkat subcell line (19Villalba M. Bi K. Hu J. Altman Y. Bushway P. Reits E. Neefjes J. Baier G. Abraham R.T. Altman A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). As these authors showed by fractionation analysis, we observed that PKCθ translocated to the plasma membrane when immobilized anti-CD3/CD28 was used as a stimulus (Fig. 5). Western blot analysis of the two PLC-γ isoforms known to be present in T lymphocytes showed that, whereas PLC-γ1 was absent in these cells, PLC-γ2 was present at high levels. Analysis after TCR stimulation demonstrated that, although to a lower extent than in parental Jurkat cells, Ca2+ levels were increased in these PLC-γ1-deficient cells. We confirmed that this Ca2+ increase was PLC-γ-dependent, since it was blocked by U73122 treatment (Fig. 5). TCR-induced Ca2+ release was not blocked by the physiologically inactive analog U73343 (not shown). In T lymphocytes, clearance of PLC-generated DAG is regulated by DGKα, which converts this lipid to PA (21Sanjuan M.A. Jones D.R. Izquierdo M. Merida I. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). To correlate PKCθ activation with DAG clearance, we determined CD69 expression in Jurkat cells transiently transfected with a catalytically inactive DGKα form (DGKαkd) known to induce higher, sustained DAG levels in response to TCR activation (29Jones D.R. Sanjuan M.A. Stone J.C. Merida I. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 595-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In basal conditions, CD69 expression was up-regulated in transfected compared with untransfected cells (Fig. 6A). After TCR stimulation, CD69 expression was markedly elevated in cells expressing DGKαkd, correlating with the increased DAG generation in these cells. Pharmacological inhibition of PLC-γ and Lck returned CD69 expression to basal levels, indicating that the CD69 increase in DGKαkd-expressing cells was due to attenuation of endogenous DGK activity and not to further regulation. We next measured CD69 expression in Jurkat cells transiently transfected with a constitutively active DGKα construct (Myr-EGFP-DGKα). Myr-EGFP-DGKα locates at the plasma membrane, attenuating receptor-regulated responses by phosphorylating PLC-γ-generated DAG (21Sanjuan M.A. Jones D.R. Izquierdo M. Merida I. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Accordingly, in Myr-EGFP-DGKα-transfected cells, cell surface CD69 expression was down-modulated compared with untransfected cells (Fig. 6B). To confirm the role of DGKα as a negative modulator of PKCθ relocalization, we studied TCR-induced endogenous PKCθ translocation in Myr-EGFP-DGK-transfected Jurkat cells. Endogenous PKCθ translocation to the membrane was detected by confocal microscopy following TCR triggering or after the addition of the DAG analog PDBu to the cells (Fig. 6C). In TCR-stimulated Myr-EGFP-DGK-expressing cells, PKCθ translocation from cytosol to the membrane was impaired (Fig. 6D). Myr-EGFP-DGK expression did not affect PDBu-induced membrane translocation of PKCθ, showing that only TCR-induced signals were affected. PKCθ translocation to the T cell synapse, which is formed when a major histocompatibility complex-bound peptide in APC contacts specific T cells, is crucial for subsequent T cell activation (13Monks C.R. Kupfer R.F. Tamir H. Barlow I. Kupfer A. Nature. 1997; 385: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Following TCR/CD28 costimulation, PKCθ activates IKKβ, leading to NF-κB activation; this effect is T cell-specific, since PKCθ does not activate NF-κB efficiently in nonlymphoid cells (28Coudronniere N. Villalba M. Englund N. Altman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3394-3399PubMed Google Scholar). In mature primary T cells, the NF-κB cascade is the major and physiologically most important target of PKCθ in the TCR/CD28 costimulatory pathway leading to IL-2 production. Receptor-induced PKC translocation to membranes is a complex process that involves protein phosphorylation, protein-lipid, and protein-protein interactions (30Ohmori S. Shirai Y. Sakai N. Fujii M. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Saito N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5263-5271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Parekh D.B. Ziegler W. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 496-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Here we used several biochemical and genetic approaches to show that TCR-mediated PKCθ translocation to the cell membrane requires an integrated two-step signal involving PKCθ Tyr phosphorylation as well as DAG generation at the plasma membrane. The use of JHM1–2.2, a Jurkat-derived T lymphoid cell line stably transfected with the human muscarinic type I receptor, demonstrates that, through activation of distinct PLC isoforms, both TCR and G protein-coupled receptors can induce PKCθ translocation. Nonetheless, experiments using the Lck inhibitor PP2 indicate that Src tyrosine kinase-imposed regulation is restricted to TCR-induced PKCθ translocation, which implies receptor-dependent selective pathways. Activation of the Src tyrosine kinases p56Lck and p59Fyn is a very early event in the TCR-triggered signaling cascade (2Kane L.P. Lin J. Weiss A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Cell treatment with PP2 thus affects the phosphorylation/activation of several molecules including different types of adapters and signaling mediators, among them PLCγ-1. When DAG generation pathways are disrupted, PKCθ translocation is blocked, even when PKCθ can be precipitated with anti-Tyr(P) antibody. This lack of membrane association is reflected by an abrogated CD69 response, indicating that PKCθ translocation requires an integrated signaling mechanism in which Tyr phosphorylation and DAG generation are essential for subcellular relocation of the protein. The experiments in peripheral blood lymphocytes demonstrate that PKCθ function is similar in human and in murine lymphocytes. Blockade of PKCθ activity results in a reduction in IL-2Rα chain, preventing correct assembly of the heterotrimeric high affinity IL-2R. PKCθ-deficient mice show a severe defect in TCR/CD28-induced AP-1 and NF-κB activation (14Sun Z. Arendt C.W. Ellmeier W. Schaeffer E.M. Sunshine M.J. Gandhi L. Annes J. Petrzilka D. Kupfer A. Schwartzberg P.L. Littman D.R. Nature. 2000; 404: 402-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). The IL-2 gene promoter has consensus binding sites for these transcription factors; thus, neither IL-2 nor the IL-2Rα chain (CD25) is efficiently induced in PKCθ–/– mice, resulting in diminished T cell proliferative responses (14Sun Z. Arendt C.W. Ellmeier W. Schaeffer E.M. Sunshine M.J. Gandhi L. Annes J. Petrzilka D. Kupfer A. Schwartzberg P.L. Littman D.R. Nature. 2000; 404: 402-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). Accordingly, high IL-2 concentrations can restore lymphocyte activation and proliferation in PKCθ–/– mice (14Sun Z. Arendt C.W. Ellmeier W. Schaeffer E.M. Sunshine M.J. Gandhi L. Annes J. Petrzilka D. Kupfer A. Schwartzberg P.L. Littman D.R. Nature. 2000; 404: 402-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar, 32Werlen G. Jacinto E. Xia Y. Karin M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3101-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Previous studies suggested that phosphorylation on Tyr90 in PKCθ was a direct consequence of TCR stimulation (26Liu Y. Witte S. Liu Y.C. Doyle M. Elly C. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3603-3609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Here we confirm the importance of phosphorylation at this residue, showing that substitution of Tyr90 by Phe prevents anti-CD3/CD28-induced PKCθ translocation to the plasma membrane. Tyr90 is not located within a consensus binding sequence for Src homology 2 domains (33Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2379) Google Scholar), suggesting that Tyr90 phosphorylation may induce a conformational change. This could allow PKCθ binding to DAG by exposing the C1 domains. Tyr90 mutation would thus prevent PKCθ translocation by rendering PKCθ(Y90F) unable to interact with DAG. Studies with the Asp90 mutant, which mimics Tyr90 phosphorylation, indicate that phosphorylation of this residue, albeit necessary, is not sufficient for TCR-induced PKCθ translocation and that an accessory signal is required. The disruption of anti-CD3/CD28-induced PKCθ translocation following pharmacological inhibition of PLC-γ suggests that PLC-γ-mediated DAG generation constitutes this additional membrane targeting signal. Pharmacological inhibition of PLC-γ blocked PKCθ membrane translocation but did not alter its Tyr phosphorylation or its recruitment to Tyr-phosphorylated protein complexes. Under these conditions, PKCθ appears to be associated to internal membranes rather than being returned to cytosol. Other DAG-regulated proteins were shown to translocate to internal localizations through protein-protein interactions; thus, β-COP, a Golgi protein, acts as a cellular receptor for PKCϵ (34Lehel C. Olah Z. Jakab G. Anderson W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1406-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), whereas the β2 chimerin-interacting protein Tmp21 is found in the Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum (35Wang H. Kazanietz M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4541-4550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). By inducing a conformational change in the absence of membrane DAG generation, Tyr phosphorylation might thus allow PKCθ association with cytoskeletal and/or internal membrane-associated proteins. PLCγ-dependent DAG generation would thus be necessary to ensure correct PKCθ association with the membrane after Tyr phosphorylation. It is important to note that if the absence of DAG caused PKCθ to remain bound to a cytoskeletal or particulate fraction, a fractionation assay would not distinguish this localization from association with the plasma membrane. This may clarify the previously reported PKCθ association to the particulate fraction in the absence of PLCγ-1 activation (19Villalba M. Bi K. Hu J. Altman Y. Bushway P. Reits E. Neefjes J. Baier G. Abraham R.T. Altman A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The DAG generation requirement for TCR-induced PKCθ membrane recruitment is further confirmed by the use of both constitutive active and transdominant negative DGKα forms. This lipid kinase phosphorylates DAG to PA, acting as a negative modulator of DAG-regulated signals (21Sanjuan M.A. Jones D.R. Izquierdo M. Merida I. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The mutants used here are known to modify existing DAG levels without affecting DAG generation and showed the negative role of DGKα in RasGRP-induced Ras activation (29Jones D.R. Sanjuan M.A. Stone J.C. Merida I. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 595-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). As previously demonstrated for RasGRP, we show that plasma membrane PKCθ localization is also negatively regulated by DGKα, confirming the role of this lipid kinase as a modulator of the intensity and duration of TCR-derived signals. It was recently reported that selective PKCθ recruitment to the TCR engagement site may operate via a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent, PLC-γ/DAG-independent mechanism (19Villalba M. Bi K. Hu J. Altman Y. Bushway P. Reits E. Neefjes J. Baier G. Abraham R.T. Altman A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). These authors used PLC-γ1-deficient Jurkat cells to show PKCθ translocation to the membrane. A model was suggested in which phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase acting upstream of the Vav/Rac pathway would regulate PKCθ translocation via cytoskeletal rearrangement (15Bi K. Tanaka Y. Coudronniere N. Sugie K. Hong S. van Stipdonk M.J. Altman A. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 556-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 17Villalba M. Coudronniere N. Deckert M. Teixeiro E. Mas P. Altman A.

Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The Vav/Rac pathway reorganizes the T cell actin cytoskeleton and facilitates TCR capping (36Fischer K.D. Kong Y.Y. Nishina H. Tedford K. Marengere L.E. Kozieradzki I. Sasaki T. Starr M. Chan G. Gardener S. Nghiem M.P. Bouchard D. Barbacid M. Bernstein A. Penninger J.M. Curr.

Biol. 1998; 8: 563-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PKCθ may bind to a cytoskeletal or scaffold protein associated with the immunological synapse. We nonetheless found high PLC-γ2 levels in these cells and found that the TCR-dependent Ca2+ elevation was U73122-sensitive, indicating TCR-dependent activation of this PLC isoform. The data thus suggest that PLC-γ isoforms may have an overlapping role in lymphocytes and that these PLC-γ1-deficient cells cannot be used to rule out a DAG requirement in PKCθ translocation. The phenotype analysis of Vav–/– mice showed disruption of PLC-γ activation, demonstrating that PLC-γ is one of the main effectors of Vav activation (20Reynolds L.F. Smyth L.A. Norton T. Freshney N. Downward J. Kioussis D. Tybulewicz V.L. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 1103-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Together, these data suggest that Vav-induced, PKCθ-mediated lymphocyte activation requires PLC-γ for PKCθ translocation. Experiments are currently under way to analyze the functional relationship between the Lck/PLC-γ and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Vav pathways in spatio-temporal regulation of PKCθ translocation. DAG generation during T cell activation is a key step in Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway initiation through RasGRP translocation (29Jones D.R. Sanjuan M.A. Stone J.C. Merida I. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 595-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Here we report the essential role of DAG in PKCθ membrane localization. Altogether, these conclusions allow us to suggest that PLC-γ-mediated DAG generation at the T cell synapse has an essential role in the polarized recruitment of signaling molecules during T cell activation. Whereas Tyr phosphorylation of adaptors and cytoskeletal reorganization ensure relocation of signaling proteins to the T cell synapse, the local increase in DAG levels at the membrane is an essential step to allow rapid recruitment of C1-containing proteins to the proximity of the TCR. A model can be envisaged (Fig. 7) in which Lck-triggered phosphorylation of several effectors, together with Vav/Rac-induced dynamic cytoskeletal reorganization, activates PLC-γ1 to increase local DAG levels. Simultaneously, Tyr phosphorylation of PKCθ promotes a conformational change, exposing its C1-DAG-binding domains that anchor the protein to the membrane. Fine control of PKC activation requires that the elevation in DAG levels be rapid and transient. This is regulated by DGKα translocation to the membrane, where the lipid kinase decreases membrane DAG levels by phosphorylating DAG to PA, dissociating PKCθ, and terminating the signal. DAG generation at the site of the immunological synapse allows the spatio-temporal protein relocalization that ensures signal transmission during a T cell response. We thank Dr. A.

https://openalex.org/W2033376607,"We have recently demonstrated that amino acid region 323–331 of factor Va heavy chain (9 amino acids, AP4′) contains a binding site for factor Xa (Kalafatis, M., and Beck, D. O. (2002) Biochemistry 41, 12715–12728). To ascertain which amino acids within this region are important for the effector and receptor properties of the cofactor with respect to factor Xa, we have synthesized three overlapping peptides (5 amino acids each) spanning the amino acid region 323–331 and tested them for their effect on prothrombinase complex assembly and function. Peptide containing amino acids 323EYFIA327 alone was found to increase the catalytic efficiency of factor Xa but had no effect on the fluorescent anisotropy of active site-labeled factor Xa (human factor Xa labeled in the active site with Oregon Green 488; [OG488]-EGR-hXa). In contrast, peptide containing the sequence 327AAEEV331 was found to interact with [OG488]-EGR-hXa with half-maximal saturation reached at ∼150 μm, but it was unable to produce a cofactor effect on factor Xa. Peptide 325FIAAE329 inhibited prothrombinase activity and was able to partially decrease the fluorescent anisotropy of [OG488]-EGR-hXa but could not increase the catalytic efficiency of factor Xa with respect to prothrombin. A control peptide with the sequence FFFIA did not increase the catalytic efficiency of factor Xa, whereas a peptide with the sequence AAEMI was impaired in its capability to interact with [OG488]-EGR-hXa. Two mutant recombinant factor Va molecules (Glu323 → Phe/Tyr324 → Phe, factor VaFF; Glu330 → Met/Val331 → Ile, factor VaMI) showed impaired cofactor activity when used at limiting cofactor concentration, whereas the quadruple mutant (Glu323 → Phe/Tyr324 → Phe and Glu330 → Met/Val331 → Ile, factor VaFF/MI) had no cofactor activity under similar experimental conditions. Our data demonstrate that amino acid residues Glu323, Tyr324, Glu330, and Val331 of factor Va heavy chain are critical for expression of factor Va cofactor activity. We have recently demonstrated that amino acid region 323–331 of factor Va heavy chain (9 amino acids, AP4′) contains a binding site for factor Xa (Kalafatis, M., and Beck, D. O.

The maintenance of hemostasis is a complex event requiring the controlled interaction of proteases, zymogens, cofactors, and inhibitors on surfaces provided by platelets and endothelial cells, culminating in timely α-thrombin formation at the site of a vascular injury. The enzymatic complex prothrombinase, which activates prothrombin, is required for normal blood clotting and is composed of the enzyme, factor Xa, and the protein cofactor, factor Va, associated on a cell surface in the presence of divalent metal ions (1Mann K.G. Kalafatis M. Blood. 2003; 101: 20-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 2Kalafatis M. Egan J.O. van't Veer C. Cawthern K.M. Mann K.G. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1997; 7: 241-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Whereas factor Xa possesses the enzymatic capability to activate prothrombin, the incorporation of factor Va into prothrombinase and its interaction with factor Xa increase the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme by 5 orders of magnitude as compared with factor Xa alone (3Nesheim M.E. Taswell J.B. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10952-10962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The increase in the catalytic efficiency of prothrombinase as compared with factor Xa alone is believed to arise from a 100-fold decrease in the K m and a 3000-fold increase in the k cat of the enzyme (4Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3708-3718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Krishnaswamy S. Jones K.C. Mann K.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 27441-27450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The decrease in the K m of the reaction appears to be the result of the interaction of the complex with the cell surface, resulting in higher local concentration of substrate. The increase in the k cat of prothrombinase is attributed to the binding of factor Va to factor Xa. The bulk of the data generated suggest that incorporation of factor Va into prothrombinase and its interaction with factor Xa and prothrombin do not have any significant effect on the catalytic site of the enzyme (8Krishnaswamy S. Walker R.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3319-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 9Wilkens M. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol.

The accumulated data suggest that binding of factor Va to factor Xa induces a conformational transition in the structure of the enzyme exposing a prothrombin-binding exosite on the enzyme, resulting in more efficient catalysis. However, the cofactor itself may also represent a portion of the exosite for prothrombin. Evidence for a direct interaction of factor Va with prothrombin has been repetitively provided (11Guinto E.R.

Human factor V circulates in plasma as a single chain glycoprotein of M r 330,000 consisting of multiple domains A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2, at a concentration of ∼20 nm (15Suzuki K. Dahlbäck B. Stenflo J. J.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6800-6804Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The factor V gene is 80 kb in length and contains 24 introns, whereas the mRNA is 6.9 kb long (19Cripe L.D. Moore K.D. Kane W.H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3777-3785Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Single chain factor V does not appear to interact with factor Xa and to have cofactor activity. Factor V is cleaved sequentially by α-thrombin at Arg709, Arg1018, and Arg1545 to produce the active cofactor, factor Va, that consists of a heavy chain (M r 105,000) and a light chain (M r 74,000). The heavy chain derives from the NH2-terminal part of factor V (A1-A2 domains, residues 1–709), whereas the light chain represents the COOH-terminal end of the procofactor (A3-C1-C2 domains, residues 1546–2196) (17Jenny R.J. Pittman D.D. Toole J.J. Kriz R.W. Aldape R.A. Hewick R.M. Kaufman R.J. Mann K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4846-4850Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The heavy and light chains are noncovalently associated via divalent metal ions (20Krishnaswamy S. Russel G.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3160-3168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of the procofactor by α-thrombin is required for expression of its cofactor activity (i.e. interaction with factor Xa and prothrombin). Both chains of the cofactor are required for the high affinity interaction with factor Xa (21Tucker M.M. Foster W.B. Katzmann J.A. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1210-1214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Annamalai A.E. Rao A.K. Chiu H.C. Wang D. Dutt-Roy A.K. Walsh P.N. Colman R.W.

The data accumulated thus far indicate that the binding of factor Va and/or factor Xa to the lipid bilayer most likely results in conformational changes in one or both proteins that contribute to aspects of the factor Va-factor Xa interaction. Factor Va and factor Xa interact stoichiometrically in the presence and absence of phospholipids. In the absence of phospholipids, the K d for the interaction is 0.8 μm and is dependent upon the presence of Ca2+ ions (24Pryzdial E.L.G. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8969-8977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon binding of both proteins to lipids, the K d of the interaction decreases by ∼1000-fold to 1 nm (4Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3708-3718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Krishnaswamy S. Jones K.C. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3823-3834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that multiple points of contact between the two proteins are exposed, resulting in the tighter interaction. Because of the physiological concentration of the two proteins in plasma, the only physiologically relevant K d for the interaction between the two proteins is the K d observed in the presence of a membrane surface. Factor Va is inactivated by activated protein C (APC), 1The abbreviations used are: APC, activated protein C; DFP, diisopropyl fluorophosphate; OPD, o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride; PS, l-α-phosphatidylserine; PC, l-α-phosphatidylcholine; PCPS, small unilamellar phospholipids vesicles composed of 75% PC and 25% PS (w/w); DAPA, dansylarginine-N-(3-ethyl-1,5-pentanediyl)amide; EGR-hXa, glutamylglycinylarginyl chloromethyl ketone active site-blocked human factor Xa; [OG488]-EGR-hXa, human factor Xa labeled in the active site with Oregon Green 488; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(s); factor VaFF, recombinant human factor Va with the mutations Glu323 → Phe/Tyr324 → Phe; factor VaMI, recombinant human factor Va with the mutations Glu330 → Met/Val331 → Ile; factor VaFF/MI, quadruple mutant, recombinant human factor Va with the mutations Glu323 → Phe/Tyr324 → Phe and Glu330 → Met/Val331 → I; mOD, 10–3 OD.1The abbreviations used are: APC, activated protein C; DFP, diisopropyl fluorophosphate; OPD, o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride; PS, l-α-phosphatidylserine; PC, l-α-phosphatidylcholine; PCPS, small unilamellar phospholipids vesicles composed of 75% PC and 25% PS (w/w); DAPA, dansylarginine-N-(3-ethyl-1,5-pentanediyl)amide; EGR-hXa, glutamylglycinylarginyl chloromethyl ketone active site-blocked human factor Xa; [OG488]-EGR-hXa, human factor Xa labeled in the active site with Oregon Green 488; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(s); factor VaFF, recombinant human factor Va with the mutations Glu323 → Phe/Tyr324 → Phe; factor VaMI, recombinant human factor Va with the mutations Glu330 → Met/Val331 → Ile; factor VaFF/MI, quadruple mutant, recombinant human factor Va with the mutations Glu323 → Phe/Tyr324 → Phe and Glu330 → Met/Val331 → I; mOD, 10–3 OD. following cleavage at Arg506, Arg306, and Arg679 only in the presence of a membrane surface (25Kalafatis M.

Chem. 1994; 269: 31869-31880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cleavage of factor Va by APC at Arg506 results in a 10-fold decrease in the affinity of the molecule for factor Xa and is required for efficient cleavage at Arg306 (25Kalafatis M. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27246-27257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Kalafatis M. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 20678-20683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Subsequent cleavage at Arg306, which is lipid-dependent and is the inactivating cleavage site, completely abolishes the ability of the cofactor to interact with factor Xa because of the dissociation of the heavy chain fragments from the light chain, hence eliminating the factor Vafactor Xa interaction (27Mann K.G. Hockin M.F. Begin K.J. Kalafatis M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20678-20683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Thus, whereas activation of factor V by α-thrombin allows for proper interaction of factor Va with factor Xa, APC inhibits this interaction by eliminating the binding site(s) of the cofactor for the enzyme. These combined data suggest that the regulation of normal hemostasis and control of thrombosis is exerted following the activation and inactivation processes of the cofactor, which ultimately and explicitly control its interaction with factor Xa. As a consequence, a complete understanding of prothrombinase assembly and function, which is a prototype for most membrane-bound complexes contributing to the blood clotting processes, necessitates the identification of the distinct amino acids from each protein responsible for their interaction as well as a complete understanding of the macromolecular interactions that occur between them. We have shown that a synthetic peptide containing a sequence of amino acids from the middle portion of factor Va heavy chain (amino acid residues 307–348; N42R) (every peptide is identified by the first and last amino acids, with the number of residues composing the peptide in the middle) inhibits factor Va cofactor activity (28Kalafatis M. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18614-18623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated, using overlapping peptides, that a nonapeptide from N42R containing amino acid sequence 323–331 of factor Va (AP4′), is the active inhibitory portion of N42R and represents a direct binding site for factor Xa (29Kalafatis M. Beck D.O. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12715-12728Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Both peptides, N42R and AP4′, also produced a “cofactor” effect on factor Xa, increasing the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme by 21- and 4-fold, respectively, as compared with factor Xa alone (29Kalafatis M. Beck D.O. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12715-12728Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The present study was undertaken to identify the amino acid residues within AP4′ that are responsible for its biological activities.

Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10709-10718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), were from Hematologic Technologies Inc. (Essex Junction, VT). The cDNA for factor V was purchased from American Type Tissue Collection (ATCC number 40515 pMT2-V; American Type Culture Collection; Manassas, VA). The sequence of this cDNA molecule is identical to the cDNA published by Jenny et al. (17Jenny R.J. Pittman D.D. Toole J.J. Kriz R.W. Aldape R.A. Hewick R.M. Kaufman R.J. Mann K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad.

All restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), and all other molecular biology and tissue culture reagents and media were from Invitrogen or as indicated. The two monoclonal antibodies to human factor V (against the heavy and light chains of the cofactor, i.e. αHFVHC 17 and αHFVLC 9) were provided by Dr. Kenneth G. Mann (Department of Biochemistry, College of Medicine, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT). These antibodies have been thoroughly characterized (31Kalafatis M. Bertina R.M. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. J.

Overlapping peptides from the region 323–331 of factor V were synthesized in the analytical facility of Dr. Satya Yadav at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation (Cleveland, OH), purified by high performance liquid chromatography, and characterized by mass spectrometry as described (29Kalafatis M. Beck D.O. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12715-12728Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Human factor V was purified as previously described using the monoclonal antibody αHFV 1 coupled to Sepharose (35Nesheim M.E. Katzmann J.A. Tracy P.B. Mann K.G.

Factor Va was obtained as recently described using heparin-Sepharose (29Kalafatis M. Beck D.O. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12715-12728Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Prior to use, factor Va was concentrated using Centricon (M r 30,000 cut-off YM-30; Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and stored on ice at 4 °C. Because of the instability of the active cofactor following prolonged storage on ice at 4 °C, factor Va preparations were made as needed and in small quantities. The quality of each preparation was assessed prior to use by measuring the activity of the factor Va molecule systematically by a clotting assay using factor V-deficient plasma and standardized to the percentage of control (35Nesheim M.E. Katzmann J.A. Tracy P.B. Mann K.G. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 80: 243-275Google Scholar). Phospholipid vesicles composed of 75% PC and 25% PS (referred to as PCPS vesicles throughout) were prepared as previously described (37Barenholz Y. Gibbs D. Litmann B.J. Goll J. Thompson T. Carlson D. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2806-2910Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). The concentration of the phospholipid vesicles was determined by phosphorous assay as described (38Gomori G. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1942; 27: 955-960Google Scholar) and is given as the concentration of inorganic phosphate. Assay Measuring Thrombin Formation—The formation of thrombin was analyzed using the fluorescent thrombin inhibitor DAPA as described (25Kalafatis M. Mann K.G. J. Biol.

The buffer used in all cases was composed of 20 mm Hepes, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4 (HBS(Ca2+), “assay buffer”). The final concentration of factor Va in the mixture was 4 nm, with factor Xa at 10 nm. Under these conditions, the rate of thrombin formation is linearly related to the amount of active cofactor (factor Va). The initial rate of thrombin formation (nm IIa/min) was calculated as described (25Kalafatis M. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27246-27257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Kalafatis M. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol.

The concentration of peptide given in each figure is the final concentration of the peptide in the assay mixture. All data were initially analyzed and stored using the software FL WinLab (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) provided by the manufacturer and further analyzed and plotted with the software Prizm (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Fluorescence Anisotropy Measurements—Fluorescence anisotropy of [OG488]-EGR-hXa was measured using a PerkinElmer LS-50B Luminescence Spectrometer in L format as recently described (29Kalafatis M. Beck D.O. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12715-12728Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Anisotropy measurements were performed in a quartz cuvette under constant stirring (low) with λex = 490 nm and λem = 520 nm with a long pass filter (Schott KV-520) in the emission beam. At each addition, anisotropy was measured for 20 s and averaging eight successive readings. In all cases, the total addition of peptide did not exceed 10% of the volume of the reaction. The concentration of peptide given in each graph is the final concentration of the peptide in the assay mixture. All data were initially analyzed and stored using the software FL WinLab (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and further analyzed and plotted with the software Prizm (GraphPad). Some of the data were also plotted using DeltaGraph (DeltaPoint, Monterey, CA). Mutagenesis and Transient Expression of Recombinant Factor V Molecules—The complete 6.909-kb-long cDNA sequence for factor V containing a leader sequence (from 91 to 174 bp) that encodes the signal peptide was inserted into the mammalian expression vector pMT2 at SalI sites. Mutant molecules were designed by keeping in mind that in order to positively identify the amino acids responsible for the effector and receptor properties of factor Va, we have to express recombinant factor V molecules with these specific amino acids mutated in such a manner that the entire conformation of the recombinant factor V molecules possesses a tertiary conformation as close as possible to the wild type factor Va molecule. For these reasons, we have made three conservative and one nonconservative mutation. As conservative substitutions, phenylalanine was substituted for a tyrosine in order to test the function of the hydroxyl present on the later amino acid. Methionine has a similar core structure as glutamic acid; however, the carboxyl group of the latter is replaced by a thioether group in the former. Although valine and isoleucine are both hydrophobic in nature, the structure of the side chain of the latter is significantly different from the structure of the side chain of the former. Finally, we have previously observed that the presence of a glutamic acid at position 323 was a prerequisite for optimum inhibitory potential of AP4′ (29Kalafatis M. Beck D.O. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12715-12728Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We have thus performed a nonconservative mutation by replacing the carboxyl group of glutamic acid with a phenyl group found in phenylalanine to eliminate any potential contribution of this hydrophilic amino acid to the interaction with factor Xa. PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis was used for constructing the factor V mutants (i.e. pMT2-FV (Glu323 → Phe/Tyr324 → Phe, factor VFF), pMT2-FV (Glu330 → Met/Val331 → Ile, factor VMI), and pMT2-FV (Glu323 → Phe, Tyr324 → Phe, Glu330 → Met, Val331 → Ile, factor ValFF/MI)). The mutagenic primers for the mutant Glu323 → Phe/Tyr324 → Phe were 5′-GAAGAGGTGGTTCTTCTTCATTGCTGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCAGCAATGAAGAAGGAACCACCTCTTC-3′ (antisense), whereas for the mutant Glu330 → Met/Val331 → Ile the primers were 5′-CATTGCTGCAGAGATGATCATTTGGGACTATGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCATAGTCCCAAATGATCATCTCTGCAGCAATG-3′ (antisense) (underlined letters indicate the mismatch). The outer PCR primers were 5′-ACATCCACTACCGCAATATGAC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCTCAGGCAGGAACAACACCATGA-3′ (antisense), corresponding to nucleotide positions 964–979 (upstream of a XcmI restriction site) and 1481–1504 (downstream of a Bsu361 site), respectively (according to Jenny et al. (17Jenny R.J. Pittman D.D. Toole J.J. Kriz R.W. Aldape R.A. Hewick R.M. Kaufman R.J. Mann K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4846-4850Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar); GenBank™ accession number M16967). Each site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by three-step PCRs. The first two PCRs were performed using the sense outer primer and antisense mutagenic primers or antisense outer primer and sense mutagenic primers. The complete DNA fragment removed from the pTM2-FV wild type sequence by digesting with SalI was used as a template for the PCR. The third reaction was performed using outer sense and antisense primers and the purified PCR products of the first two reactions as templates. All PCRs were performed with high fidelity Taq polymerase. PCRs were programmed as follows: denaturation at 94 °C for 15 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and extension at 68 °C for 1 min/kb in a GeneAmp PCR system 9700 DNA thermal cycler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The amplicons of each third reaction were ligated into the cloning plasmid vector pGEM-T, and the integrity of the constructs was verified following sequencing using an ABI Prism automatic DNA sequencer and the universal primers T7 and SP6 as well as other factor V sequence-specific primers as needed at the sequencing facility at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. The quadruple mutant pMT2-FV (E323F/Y324F/E330M/V331I) was made using the pGEM-T plasmid vector containing the DNA insert of factor VFF as template and the mutagenic primers used for factor VMI. The inserts (nucleotides 964–1504) were removed from the pGEMT-FV plasmid constructs (mutant fragments) following digestion with XcmI and Bsu361 restriction enzymes. Following purification of the inserts from the agarose gel, the factor V inserts that possess the mutations (nucleotide positions 964–1504) were religated into pMT2-FV, in which the DNA fragment between the XcmI and Bsu361 restriction sites was removed. The ligated plasmids were transformed into JM109 bacterial competent cells. Positive ampicillin-resistant clones for pMT2-FV mutants were selected. The correct sequences and orientations of the inserts were established by DNA sequence analysis with factor V-specific primers. The wild-type pMT2-FV and mutant pMT2-FV plasmids were isolated from the bacterial culture by the QIAfilter plasmid Midi kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). Recombinant Factor V-Wild Type and Factor V Mutant Transfection into COS-7 Cells—COS-7 cells (ATTC) or COS-7L, (Invitrogen) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2"

https://openalex.org/W2055288426,"In our previous study we demonstrated that presenilin 1 (PS1) interacts with cytoplasmic linker protein 170/Restin (CLIP-170/Restin). Herein we show that disruption of the interaction of these proteins within neuronal cell-lines (SY5Y and N2a) can be accomplished by the transfection of vectors that drive the expression of peptide fragments corresponding to their binding domains (BDPs). Interestingly, the disruption of the PS1/CLIP-170 complex is associated with both decreased secretion of endogenous Abeta and decreased uptake of exogenous Abeta from the medium. BDP-expressing cells were also more resistant to surges of Abeta secretion induced by thapsigargin and ionomycin (that elevate intracellular calcium concentrations) and mutations in PS1 linked to familial Alzheimer's disease. Uptake of Abeta by SY5Y cells was amplified when preincubated with ApoE and was mediated through lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP). BDP-expressing cells or cells treated with PS1 anti-sense oligonucleotides were less capable of taking up Abeta from the medium compared with controls, indicating that the PS1/CLIP-170 interaction is involved and that PS1 cannot be substituted. In this study, we also mapped the minimum binding domains (mBDPs) of PS1 and CLIP-70 to regions corresponding to the N-terminal end of the large cytoplasmic loop of PS1 and the metal binding motif-containing C-terminal end of CLIP-170. Further, our data obtained from experiments involving in vitro taxol-polymerization of tubulin and confocal immunofluorescence suggest that PS1, via CLIP-170, may serve as an anchor to the microtubules for specific subcellular fractions containing amyloidogenic fragments. Interestingly, Notch is absent from this population of microtubule binding subcellular fractions and its cleavage was unaffected in cells transfected with the PS1-based BDP. This raises the possibility that the interaction of PS1 with CLIP-170 could provide the conceptual basis for anti-amyloidogenic therapeutic strategies with improved specificity. However, this approach may be hampered by a low efficiency, because it may also block Abeta clearance from the interstitial space of the CNS."

A genetic “one-hybrid” assay was used to define two distinct transactivation (TA) domains: in addition to a conserved TAD present in both isoforms, a second, novel TAD exists within the β-specific amino terminus. Pharmacologic inhibitors Gö6976 and rottlerin demonstrate that both conventional and novel protein kinase C (PKC) family members regulate endogenous mast cell NFAT activity, and NFAT2 TA. Overexpression of dominant active PKCθ (which has been implicated in immune receptor signaling) induces NFAT2.α/β TA. Mutations within the smallest PKCθ-responsive transactivation domain demonstrate that the PKCθ effect is at least partially indirect. Significantly, the β-specific domain confers greater ability to TA in response to treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin or lipopolysaccharide, and unique sensitivity to FcϵRI signaling. Accordingly, overexpression of NFAT2.β results in significantly greater NFAT- and interleukin-4 reporter activity than NFAT2.α. These results suggest that whereas NFAT2 isoforms may share redundant DNA-binding preferences, there are specialized functional consequences of their isoform-specific domains. Murine nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)2.α/β differ by 42 and 28 unique amino-terminal amino acids and are differentially expressed. Both isoforms share conserved domains that regulate DNA-binding and subcellular localization.

Olson E.N. Cell. 2002; 109: S67-S79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). NFAT was first characterized as an essential component of inducible IL-2 transcription in T cells (2Shaw J.P. Utz P.J. Durand D.B. Toole J.J. Emmel E.A. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1988; 241: 202-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), but is now known to denote a family of transcription factors that include four Ca2+-responsive NFAT family members (NFAT1–4) (1Crabtree G.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 2002; 109: S67-S79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar, 3Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar). NFAT family members are often expressed as multiple isoforms, and exhibit cell type-specific expression patterns (4Chuvpilo S. Avots A. Berberich-Siebelt F. Glockner J. Fischer C. Kerstan A. Escher C. Inashkina I. Hlubek F. Jankevics E. Brabletz T. Serfling E. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 7294-7301PubMed Google Scholar, 5Sherman M.A. Powell D.R. Weiss D.L. Brown M.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2820-2828PubMed Google Scholar). Although they function in a wide variety of cell types, their role in regulating the activation-dependent expression of many immunologic effector molecules (including: IL-2, IL-4, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interferon-γ, and CD95L) is best characterized (3Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar). Based largely on studies of activated T cells, it has been established that in addition to restricted patterns of expression, NFAT activity is controlled at several levels: subcellular localization, DNA binding, and transcriptional transactivation.The motifs that regulate the subcellular localization of NFAT, a latent cytoplasmic factor, are located within a conserved amino-terminal regulatory region, the NFAT-homology region. Upon cellular activation, a sustained Ca2+ flux activates the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin (Cn). Cn directly associates with NFAT molecules through recognition/docking sites, including the SPRIEIT sequence (NFAT1–4) and CnBP-B (NFAT2–4) (6Park S. Uesugi M. Verdine G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7130-7135Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 7Beals C.R. Clipstone N.A. Ho S.N. Crabtree G.R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 824-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Activated Cn dephosphorylates a conserved set of serine-proline repeats (SP boxes), which induces NFAT translocation to the nucleus (8Shibasaki F. Price E.R. Milan D. McKeon F. Nature. 1996; 382: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Kinases, including glycogen synthase kinase re-phosphorylate nuclear NFAT and promote its export back to the cytoplasm, thus regulating its access to DNA (9Beals C.R. Sheridan C.M. Turck C.W. Gardner P. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1930-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). NFAT molecules associate with DNA as monomers via a highly conserved domain, the Rel-homology domain (related to Rel-family transcription factors NFκB and Dorsal) (10Jain J. Burgeon E. Badalian T.M. Hogan P.G. Rao A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4138-4145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The Rel-homology domain consists of ∼300 amino acids and binds the consensus sequence: 5′-(A/T)GGAAAA-3′. NFAT activity often depends on association with AP-1 molecules. In these cases, AP-1 and NFAT bind co-operatively at composite DNA elements and activate transcription (11Nolan G.P. Cell. 1994; 77: 795-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 12Castigli E. Chatila T.A. Geha R.S. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3284-3290PubMed Google Scholar). The requirement for co-operative binding of NFAT and AP-1 family members has been one way to account for the dependence on both PMA (through the activation of a kinase cascade that includes MAP kinases and PKC family members) and ionomycin signals (that activate Cn) for expression of some NFAT-regulated genes (3Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar).Regions of the NFAT molecule that contribute to transcriptional transactivation have been identified within NFAT1, -2, and -4. NFAT1 transactivation activity is localized to amino acids 1–415 (13Luo C. Burgeon E. Rao A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), a region that includes the SPRIEIT sequence. Two transactivation domains (TADs) have been identified within the human NFAT2 molecule: TAD-A (amino acids 113–205) and TAD-B (amino acids 690–930 within the carboxyl terminus of NFAT2.C) (4Chuvpilo S. Avots A. Berberich-Siebelt F. Glockner J. Fischer C. Kerstan A. Escher C. Inashkina I. Hlubek F. Jankevics E. Brabletz T. Serfling E. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 7294-7301PubMed Google Scholar). In NFAT4, a carboxyl-terminal, isoform-specific region (amino acids 1030–1044) also contributes to transcriptional activation (14Imamura R. Masuda E.S. Naito Y. Imai S. Fujino T. Takano T. Arai K. Arai N. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3455-3463PubMed Google Scholar).Despite the conservation of DNA-binding and regulatory domains, the phenotypes of NFAT-null mice illustrate that some NFAT family members have specialized functions. For example, deletion of the NFAT1 gene results in dysregulated lymphoproliferation and a Th2-dominant cytokine response (15Kiani A. Viola J.P. Lichtman A.H. Rao A. Immunity. 1997; 7: 849-860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In contrast, NFAT2 –/– lymphocytes are defective in proliferation and production of Th2 cytokines (16Ranger A.M. Hodge M.R. Gravallese E.M. Oukka M. Davidson L. Alt F.W. de la Brousse F.C. Hoey T. Grusby M. Glimcher L.H. Immunity. 1998; 8: 125-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 17Yoshida H. Nishina H. Takimoto H. Marengere L.E. Wakeham A.C. Bouchard D.

Such phenotypes suggest that NFAT2 activity drives Th2 cytokine production and proliferation, and is modulated by the repressive action of NFAT1. NFAT2 also has an essential role in cardiac valve formation (18de la Pompa J.L. Timmerman L.A. Takimoto H. Yoshida H. Elia A.J. Samper E. Potter J. Wakeham A. Marengere L. Langille B.L. Crabtree G.R. Mak T.W. Nature. 1998; 392: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 19Ranger A.M. Grusby M.J. Hodge M.R. Gravallese E.M. de la Brousse F.C. Hoey T. Mickanin C. Baldwin H.S. Glimcher L.H. Nature. 1998; 392: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). These studies illustrate the conserved and essential role of NFAT gene products in development and expression of immunologic effector molecules, but also suggest functional specialization among family members. The mechanisms that underlie the ability of NFAT family members to regulate unique programs of gene expression remain undefined.The existence of multiple isoforms of NFAT1, -2, and -4 suggests that there is even more complexity in the regulation and function of NFAT family members. Strategies used to target NFAT genes for deletion result in the loss of expression of all isoforms derived from the targeted locus. Thus, the contribution of individual NFAT isoforms to unique patterns of gene expression has not yet been evaluated in vivo. We previously cloned two isoforms of NFAT2 from a murine mast cell cDNA library that differ only at their amino termini (5Sherman M.A. Powell D.R. Weiss D.L. Brown M.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2820-2828PubMed Google Scholar). NFAT2.α and NFAT2.β contain 42 and 28 unique amino acids, respectively. These two murine isoforms do not contain the alternative carboxyl termini that are described for human isoforms: NFAT2.A/B/C (20Chuvpilo S. Zimmer M. Kerstan A. Glockner J. Avots A. Escher C. Fischer C. Inashkina I. Jankevics E. Berberich-Siebelt F. Schmitt E. Serfling E. Immunity. 1999; 10: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, the amino termini are conserved: hNFAT2.A/B corresponds to mNFAT2.α, whereas hNFAT2.C has the mNFAT2.β amino terminus. Murine NFAT2.α is expressed predominantly in the spleen, whereas NFAT2.β is also expressed in the liver and kidney. In both T and mast cell lines, the expression of NFAT2.α is inducible, whereas NFAT2.β is constitutively expressed at low levels in T cells, and is up-regulated only in mast cells upon cell activation.Because the sequences that regulate DNA-binding and nuclear transport are identical in murine NFAT2.α and NFAT2.β, we hypothesized that the isoform-specific regions confer distinct abilities to transactivate transcription, perhaps allowing for cell- and signal-specific NFAT activities. In this study we used a genetic one-hybrid assay to identify transactivation domains (TADs) within NFAT2.α and NFAT2.β. Two regions act independently to confer transcriptional activation in response to PMA and ionomycin. Both conventional and novel PKCs regulate this activity. In addition, a novel acidic activation domain (Glu5-Asp19) within the β-specific amino terminus imparts NFAT2.β with greater ability to transactivate in response to a broad range of PMA and ionomycin concentrations. Significantly, it also provides NFAT2.β with the unique ability to respond to FcϵRI cross-linking. These data demonstrate that there is functional specialization among NFAT2 isoforms that is regulated at the level of transactivation in response to specific activation signals.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Cultures and Reagents—CFTL-15 mast cells were cultured as previously described (5Sherman M.A. Powell D.R. Weiss D.L. Brown M.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2820-2828PubMed Google Scholar) except 3.3 ng/ml recombinant murine IL-3 (BIOSOURCE Intl., Camarillo, CA) was substituted for WEHI3B supernatant. MC9 mast cells (21Musch M.W. Siegel M.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 16: 517-525Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar) (obtained from American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum and 30% WEHI3B supernatant. COS-1 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (4.5 g/liter glucose and 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Cells were stimulated with PMA (Sigma), ionomycin (Calbiochem), or LPS (Sigma). PMA and ionomycin concentrations (20 ng/ml and 1 μg/ml, respectively) were uniform with the exception of the PMA/ionomycin dose-response shown in Fig. 3B, which utilized five 10-fold dilutions from 0.2 μg/ml PMA and 10 μg/ml ionomycin. FcϵRI cross-linkage was achieved through IgE/α-IgE treatment, briefly: CFTL-15 mast cells were preincubated for 2 days in 0.5 μg/ml purified mouse IgE (BD Biosciences); 24 h after transfection, cells were resuspended in 200 μl of complete media with 5.0 μg/ml IgE at 4 °C for 30 min; cells were washed twice in serum-free RPMI to remove unbound IgE, and resuspended in 200 μl of complete media with 5.0 μg/ml rat α-mouse IgE (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL) at 37 °C for 45 min. Cells were transferred to 12-well plates in complete media until harvest (48 h post-transfection). PKC inhibitors Gö6976 and rottlerin (Calbiochem) were dissolved in Me2SO, and added to cells 30 min prior to PMA/ionomycin treatment.Transfections—5.0 × 106 CFTL-15 cells were electroporated in 0.5 ml of serum-free RPMI at 400 V and 425 μF in 0.4-cm gap cuvettes with a Gene-Pulser II (Bio-Rad). All CFTL-15 shocks contained 50 μg of salmon sperm DNA (Invitrogen). Samples were incubated for 10 min with DNA at room temperature prior to electroporation, and were allowed to recover on ice for 10 min post-electroporation.One-hybrid Constructs and CAT Assays—PCR-generated fragments of murine NFAT2.α and NFAT2.β were cloned in-frame into the Gal4 DBD expression construct, pM (Clontech). The isoform-specific regions are represented by α1–44 and β1–30. Single amino acid mutations were constructed with the QuikChange™ mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). CFTL-15 assays were performed with 0.001–10 μg of effector construct and 5 μg of G5CAT reporter construct (Clontech). Within an experiment, equal molar quantities of effector constructs were used. PKCθ expression constructs were the kind gift of A. Altmon (La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology).For overexpression analysis, NFAT2.α and NFAT2.β were cloned into the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen); 20 μg of the expression constructs were transiently transfected into CFTL-15 cells with 20 μgof either NFAT- or IL-4-CAT reporter constructs. Twenty-four hours post-electroporation, CFTL-15 cells were split into two to three samples and treated with PMA/ionomycin, or IgE/α-IgE. Forty-eight hours post-electroporation, CAT extracts were harvested by the Tris/EDTA/NaCl (TEN)/Triton X-100 method (22Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Chanda V.B. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2002: 9.7.5Google Scholar). CAT activity was measured in a scintillation:diffusion assay as previously described (23Tara D. Weiss D.L. Brown M.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 4592-4602PubMed Google Scholar). All CAT results are representative of at least three independent experiments. The NFAT reporter contains 3 tandem repeats of the IL-2 NFAT site upstream of the IL-2 promoter (–72 to +25) (24Boss V. Talpade D.J. Murphy T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10429-10432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The NFAT sites each contain the composite NFAT:AP-1 “NFAT-responsive element” (Fig. 4A). The NFAT reporter was the kind gift of T. J. Murphy (Emory University). The IL-4 reporter construct contains sequences corresponding to –797 to +5 base pairs of the murine IL-4 promoter and has been previously described (23Tara D. Weiss D.L. Brown M.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 4592-4602PubMed Google Scholar).Fig. 4NFAT activity in CFTL-15 mast cells is dependent on both conventional and novel PKCs.

Cells were resuspended in 200 μl of 1.2× Laemmli sample buffer (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar) on ice. Extracts were heated to 95 °C for 5 min, then either sonicated or passaged through a 22-gauge needle to disrupt chromatin. Extracts were then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. After gel electrophoresis, proteins were electroblotted to nitrocellulose for 20 min at 15 V in transfer buffer (48 mm Tris, 39 mm glycine, 20% methanol). Blots were blocked in 5% dry milk/TBST (0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies specific for either Gal4 DBD (clone RK5C1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or PKCθ (clone E-7, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added to the same solution for an additional hour. After 3 washes in TBST (5 min each), blots were treated with 1:10,000 dilutions of secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase in 5% dry milk/TBST (0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature.Reverse Transcriptase-PCR Analysis—RNA was harvested from 1.0 × 107 cells with RNA STAT-60 reagent (Tel-Test Inc., Friendswood, TX). 1.0 μg of DNase I-treated RNA was used as a template in a Superscript II™ (Invitrogen) first-strand synthesis reaction. PCR primers to detect PKCθ transcripts were: PKCθ forward, 5′-CTCGTCAAAGAGTATGTCGAATCA-3′ and PKCθ reverse, 5′-AATTCATTCAGTCCTTTGTGTCACTCA-3′.RESULTSTwo Distinct NFAT2 Transactivation Domains Function in Mast Cells—To examine the ability of murine NFAT2 isoforms to transactivate transcription, one-hybrid effector constructs (Fig. 1A) were used. These constructs express the Gal4 DBD fused to discrete regions of NFAT2, but exclude the NFAT Rel-homology domain. The Gal4 DBD (amino acids 1–147) contains a nuclear localization signal that targets one-hybrid proteins to the nucleus. As a result, these molecules localize exclusively to reporter cis-elements. Furthermore, transactivation measured in the assay is not a result of association with AP-1 family members (which make contacts within the NFAT Rel-homology domain). Effector constructs were co-transfected into mast cells with a reporter whose expression is regulated by five Gal4 cis-elements and a minimal E1b promoter. These experiments were performed in the non-transformed, IL-3-dependent mast cell line, CFTL-15. These cells express functional FcϵRI, and release a number of mast cell mediators when activated through this receptor including histamine, IL-4, IL-13, tumor necrosis factor α, and IL-6 (26Keegan A.D. Pierce J.H. Artrip J. Plaut M. Paul W.E. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3675-3682Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). 2M. Brown, unpublished data. They also express MMCP-4, a serine protease expressed by mature connective tissue mast cells (27Lunderius C. Xiang Z. Nilsson G. Hellman L. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 3396-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).Fig. 1Analysis of NFAT2 transactivation in mast cells.

Immunodetection of Gal4 fusion proteins was performed with α-Gal41–147 clone RK5C1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As shown in Fig. 1B, the “full-length” amino-terminal constructs, α1–429 and β1–415, as well as 31–415 (which excludes the isoform-specific domains) were active in this assay. β1–30 and 91–415 represent the smallest independent constructs that can transactivate. All active constructs possess both basal and stimulation responsive (20 ng/ml PMA and 1 μg/ml ionomycin) activity. The common region encompassing amino acids 91–415 includes the previously defined human NFAT2 transactivation domain (TAD-A, amino acids 113–205), whereas β1–30 represents a novel TA domain. Amino acids 30–90 and the carboxyl terminus (amino acids 550–704), regions shared by both NFAT2.α and NFAT2.β, as well as the isoform-specific region of NFAT2.α (amino acids α1–44), have no independent transactivation ability. α1–44 is inactive over a broad range of effector concentrations, conditions under which β1–30 demonstrates a concentration-dependent ability to transactivate (Fig. 1C).Regions that have no independent ability to transactivate can contribute to the activity of adjacent domains. For example, the basal and inducible activity of β1–90 is greater than that of β1–30, yet constructs containing amino acids 30–90 alone are inactive. Deletion of 30–90 from the 31–415 construct (represented by 91–415) has only a minimal affect on activity, indicating that this modulating influence is exerted primarily on the β1–30 transactivation domain.These differences in transactivation are not the result of significant variations in the inherent stability of the hybrid effector molecules or in their ability to be expressed. Whole cell lysates were isolated from COS-1 cells transiently transfected with one-hybrid effector constructs and subjected to Western blot analysis using Gal4-specific antibodies. A representative experiment is shown in Fig. 1D. Chimeric Gal4 proteins of the expected molecular weight are expressed in all transfectants. In addition, the expression levels appear uniform with the exception of β1–30 and β1–90. Whereas differences in NFAT2 isoform stability have not been reported, the acidic β-specific amino terminus may confer a shorter protein half-life on these constructs. This result also indicates that the levels of transactivation for these two constructs (Fig. 1B) may be underestimated by this assay. Therefore, we are unable to determine whether the overall ability of NFAT2.β to transactivate represents additive or synergistic contributions from the two distinct transactivation domains (91–415 and the β-specific domain).β1–30 Contains a Novel Acidic Activation Domain: Glu5-Asp19—The β-specific amino terminus is highly charged (pI = 2.9) and contains 7 acidic residues (Asp/Glu) interspersed by a number of hydrophobic residues including phenylalanine, a pattern conserved in many acidic activation domains (AAD) (28Triezenberg S.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). An alignment of the amino termini of human NFAT2.C and murine NFAT2.β (Fig. 2B) reveals a conserved unit of acidic/hydrophobic residues. We tested whether the acidic “core” of this domain, Glu5-Asp19 is able to transactivate transcription in mast cells. The results shown in Fig. 2A demonstrate that the activity of Glu5-Asp19 fully complements the ability of β1–30 to drive transcription, and respond to PMA/ionomycin. Thus, a novel 15-amino acid acidic activation domain exists within the β-specific amino terminus of NFAT2.Fig. 2NFAT2.β-specific amino terminus contains a conserved, 15-amino acid acidic activation domain: Glu5-Asp19. A, Glu5-Asp19 is able to complement the full TA ability of β1–30. One-hybrid assay was performed with the indicated quantities of effector constructs. Data are representative of three independent experiments. B, alignment of murine and human isoform-specific amino termini.

Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar), the influence of these signals on transactivation has not been well characterized. We examined the ability of either PMA or ionomycin treatment alone to induce transactivation of NFAT2.α and NFAT2.β. As shown in Fig. 3A, PMA treatment alone results in a modest increase in transactivation, suggesting that PMA-induced signals do contribute to transactivation. However, signals induced by ionomycin or PMA/ionomycin have the most significant affects on inducible activity. The addition of cyclosporin A inhibits PMA/ionomycin-induced transactivation (Fig. 3A). Because one-hybrid effector proteins are targeted to the nucleus via the Gal4 nuclear localization signal, this finding suggests that calcineurin participates in the regulation of both NFAT2 subcellular localization and transactivation.At the fixed doses of PMA and ionomycin used in these assays, β1–415 consistently transactivates better than α1–429 (Figs. 1B and 3A). It is possible that the isoform-specific regions confer differential ability to activate transcription in response to varying activation signal strength. For example, NFAT2.α may respond equivalently to NFAT2.β only at high signal strengths. To test this possibility, transfected cells were treated with increasing concentrations of PMA and ionomycin. As shown in Fig. 3B, the absolute level of transactivation differs between the two isoforms over the entire activator concentration range. However, both isoforms demonstrate inducible transactivation at the same PMA/ionomycin concentrations, indicating that there is no qualitative transactivation difference in response to signal strength.Endogenous Mast Cell NFAT Activity Is Influenced by Both Novel and Conventional PKCs—Several Ser/Thr kinases have been demonstrated to regulate NFAT transactivation, including: CaMK IV, Cot-1, PIM-1, and PKCζ (29Hama N.

Here, we report that mice transgenic for the homeodomain transcription factor Isl-1 develop profound caudal growth defects that resemble human sacral/caudal agenesis. Isl-1 is normally expressed in the pancreas and is required for pancreas development and endocrine cell differentiation. Aberrant regulation of this pancreatic transcription factor causes increased mesodermal cell death, and the severity of defects is dependent on transgene dosage. Together with the finding that mutation of the pancreatic transcription factor HLXB9 causes sacral agenesis, our results implicate pancreatic transcription factors in the pathogenesis of birth defects associated with diabetes."

When more is known about the mechanisms that govern these processes, human embryonic stem cells may be clinically useful in generating cell types that have been damaged or depleted by a variety of human diseases. The NIH is actively pursuing a variety of initiatives to promote this developing research field, while continuing and expanding its long-standing investment in adult stem cells and research."
