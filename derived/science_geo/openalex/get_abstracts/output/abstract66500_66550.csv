https://openalex.org/W2070952276,"The incidence of gross chromosomal abnormality was measured in a large (4500), relatively unbiased sample of New Haven infants born during 1 year. The frequency of infants with abnormal chromosomal constitutions was 0.5 percent. For mothers over age 34, 1.5 percent of newborns were chromosomally abnormal. Only one in four of these infants could have been detected by phenotypic criteria alone. Methods are discussed whereby this fraction of the newborn population might be detected and possibly reduced."

The lead aerosol concentration at San Diego is increasing at a rate of 5 percent per year. The isotopic composition of lead aerosols is similar to that of the lead additives isolated from gasoline, which are the largest contributors to atmospheric lead pollution."
https://openalex.org/W1596895992,"Abstract The mechanism for controlling the rapid rate of glycogenolysis in flight muscle of the blowfly, Phormia regina, was studied by isolating phosphorylase a and b from the muscle and determining the physical and kinetic properties of the purified enzymes and the relative amounts of the two forms of the enzymes in the muscle of the insect at rest and during flight. A method is described for the purification of phosphorylase a and b from flight muscle. Sedimentation velocity and disc gel electrophoresis studies indicate homogeneous preparations. The molecular weights of both phosphorylase b and a are about 100,000. p-Chloromercuribenzoate has no effect on the sedimentation coefficient. Amino acid analyses of the insect muscle enzyme show high contents of half-cystine and lysine and a low content of arginine, relative to the amounts of these residues found previously in mammalian muscle preparations. Other properties of the flight muscle enzyme, including pH optimum, stability, and pyridoxal phosphate content are described. The apparent Km of phosphorylase a and b for glycogen, Pi, or AMP has been determined at various concentrations of cosubstrate and activator. From these kinetic data, plus previously determined concentrations of metabolites in flight muscle, conditions in vivo were simulated. The level of glycogen in the muscle is sufficient to saturate the enzymes. The apparent Km of phosphorylase b for Pi, at 0.1 mm AMP, is about 100 mm, well above the concentration found in the muscle. The apparent Km for AMP, at 8 mm Pi, is about 1.0 mm, approximately 10-fold that in the muscle, at rest. ATP strongly inhibits phosphorylase b at low concentrations of AMP. The concentration of AMP in the muscle is 100-fold its apparent Km for phosphorylase a. The apparent Km for Pi at simulated conditions in vivo is 8 mm, approximately the concentration found in the muscle. ATP does not inhibit the a form of the enzyme. Thus, at the levels in vivo of substrates, activators, and inhibitors, phosphorylase a retains about 50% of its potential activity. The activity of phosphorylase b is too low to account for the rate of glycogenolysis during flight. The activity of phosphorylase a is adequate, if at least 50% of the total enzyme is in the a form. Measurements of the relative amounts of phosphorylase a and b at rest and during flight show that the conversion of the b to the a form is of this order of magnitude. It is concluded that in blowfly flight muscle the mechanism for controlling the intense rate of glycogenolysis concomitant with the initiation of flight is the conversion of phosphorylase b to phosphorylase a."
https://openalex.org/W1982584818,"The relative deuterium content was measured on 37 snow cores collected in April 1969 in the Sierra Nevada. The deuterium content varies inversely with altitude of collection (approximately 40 per mil per 1000 meters) but is unrelated to latitude. The altitude relationship is particularly well defined west of the crest of the range but is not well defined east of the crest. However, samples from east of the crest tend to be depleted by about 10 to 15 per mil relative to samples collected at the same elevation west of the crest. We propose that the deuterium content of snow cores, collected so as to include the total winter's precipitation, can be used as a climatic indicator to compare the climate of one winter with that of another."
https://openalex.org/W2029746534,An immunoassay was developed for determining the concentration of the protein moiety of the low-density lipoproteins of human plasma. The concentration of this protein in the plasma was variable; it was higher than normal on the average in patients with familial hyperbetalipoproteinemia (type II) and endogenous hyperlipemia (type IV) and lower than normal in patients with fat-induced (type I) and mixed (type V) hyperlipemia. Patients with endogenous hyperlipemia were separable by the immunoassay into those with normal and those with supernormal low-density lipoprotein protein concentration.

https://openalex.org/W1601492462,"In the presence of controls for site- and path-specific odors, observer and food-source scents, Nasanov gland and alarm odors, visual cues, wind, and general site taxis, recruited bees were able to locate the food source indicated by the dances of returning foragers in preference to a food source located at an equal distance in the opposite direction. This was true even when foragers were simultaneously dancing to indicate two different stations. Recruitment in the absence of dancing was very low, while in the absence of foraging it was virtually zero. Thus, under the experimental conditions used, the directional information contained in the dance appears to have been communicated from forager to recruit and subsequently used by the recruit."
https://openalex.org/W1844035883,"Abstract Biosynthetic l-threonine dehydratase (l-threonine hydrolyase, deaminating, EC 4.2.1.16) has been purified about 2500-fold from extracts of spinach leaves by ammonium sulfate fractionation, controlled heat treatment, and chromatography on triethylaminoethyl cellulose and hydroxylapatite. The feedback control and other properties of the purified enzyme are essentially the same as that of the native enzyme. Although the enzyme is active on both l-threonine and l-serine, the former is the preferred substrate. The ratio of the two activities remains about the same throughout purification. The activity of the purified enzyme is not stimulated by added pyridoxal phosphate which suggests that the coenzyme is rather tightly bound. Monovalent cations such as K+, NH4+, and Li+ stimulate the enzyme activity about 4- to 5-fold. The feedback inhibitor, l-isoleucine, protects the enzyme against inactivation at low temperatures. Analyses of Lineweaver-Burk plots show that the enzyme obeys Michaelis-Menten laws in the absence of l-isoleucine. However, in the presence of relatively low concentrations of the inhibitor the kinetics becomes sigmoidal. The kinetics is normalized by addition of l-valine. At low substrate concentrations (below 5 mm), l-valine activates the enzyme in the presence of l-isoleucine. The stimulatory effect of l-valine is, however, not observed at high substrate concentration. l-Valine reverses the l-isoleucine inhibition partially, the extent of reversion being dependent upon the concentration of l-isoleucine. Kinetic data suggest that the enzyme may have more than one binding site for l-isoleucine. Exposure of the purified enzyme to HgCl2 causes desensitization; i.e. the treated enzyme is less sensitive to feedback inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W1575099068,"Abstract The covalent binding of acetyl, malonyl, and hexanoyl groups to the pigeon liver fatty acid synthetase has been investigated. Performic acid oxidation of the acyl synthetases has revealed that the synthetase possesses two types of acyl binding sites, these being thiol and nonthiol in nature. From studies on radioactive peptic peptides obtained from 14C-acetyl synthetase and 14C-malonyl synthetase, it has been established that there are two thiol binding sites. One of these thiol sites is the sulfhydryl group of the 4'-phosphopantetheine moiety of the synthetase. Both acetyl and malonyl groups bind to this sulfhydryl group. The second thiol binding site is the sulfhydryl group of a cysteine residue. This sulfhydryl binds acetyl groups but not malonyl groups. The nonthiol binding site or sites has been tentatively identified as being the hydroxyl group of a serine residue. Prior treatment of the synthetase with high concentrations of N-ethylmaleimide inhibits all binding of acetyl and malonyl groups, while prior treatment with low concentrations of N-ethylmaleimide results in inhibition of thiol binding but has little effect on the nonthiol binding of these acyl groups. Prior treatment of the synthetase with iodoacetamide has no effect on the binding of acetyl and malonyl groups to the 4'-phosphopantetheine sulfhydryl but inhibits acetyl binding to the sulfhydryl of the cysteine residue. From these studies the order of acetyl binding to the synthetase appears to be binding first at the nonthiol site with successive transfers to the 4'-phosphopantetheine sulfhydryl and the cysteine sulfhydryl. The binding of malonyl groups follows the same sequence, except that malonyl groups are not transferred from the 4'-phosphopantetheine sulfhydryl to the cysteine sulfhydryl."

https://openalex.org/W1992258492,"Abstract Bacillus licheniformis 9259 has been shown to synthesize two C16 polyunsaturated fatty acids from endogenous or added palmitate at 20°, but not at 35°. Ready conversion of added palmitic acid labeled with 14C or 3H to these fatty acids by cultures of B. licheniformis incubated at 20° permitted the isolation of sufficient amounts of material for the determination of structure and label distribution by physical and chemical methods. The major polyunsaturated component was shown to be 5,10-hexadecadienoic acid while a minor component had the 7,10-double bond configuration. It was further shown that the biosynthesis of the major dienoic acid resulted from the cooperative action of two distinct desaturation systems. One system, which was present at both 35 and 20° desaturated palmitic acid to 10-hexadecenoic acid. A second system, active only at the lower temperature, resulted in the conversion of palmitic acid to 5-hexadecenoic acid. This system, which had previously been studied in Bacillus megaterium, is apparently not present at 35° but is rapidly induced at 20°. Utilizing 3H-labeled 10-hexadecenoic and 5-hexadecenoic acids which were prepared biosynthetically, it was possible to show that, at 20°, either substrate could serve as a precursor for the biosynthesis of 5,10-hexadecadienoic acid by B. licheniformis. Indeed, they were both more effective in this regard than palmitic acid added in similar concentrations. Although added palmitic acid is also converted to 7,10-hexadecadienoic acid at 20°, there was no evidence for the formation of the monoene, 7-hexadecenoic acid at either 35 or 20°. Presumably, the substrate for Δ7 desaturation is 10-hexadecenoic acid. The finding that B. licheniformis can carry out the conversion of palmitate to 5,10- and 7,10-hexadecadienoic acids apparently represents the first unequivocal indication of polyunsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis de novo in bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W1558970973,"Abstract Five sulfhydryl endopeptidases were purified to homogeneity from commercial preparations of Ficus glabrata latex. One of these corresponded to ficin isolated from the same source by Englund, King, Craig, and Walti (Biochemistry, 7, 163 (1968)). Each of these enzymes appeared to consist of a single polypeptide chain, of 25,000 to 26,000 molecular weight, with amino-terminal leucine. They displayed very similar specificity and kinetic properties towards the B chain of oxidized insulin, casein, and synthetic ester substrates. The enzymes showed differing retention behavior on cation exchangers, different mobilities in polyacrylamide gels, reproducible differences in amino acid composition, particularly in the content of arginine and tyrosine, and distinct peptide maps. The tryptic peptide maps strongly suggest that these enzymes share a high proportion of common regions in their amino acid sequences. They do not appear to arise by cleavage of a common precursor."
https://openalex.org/W1513848331,"Abstract Liganded hemoglobin is a stronger acid than ligand-free hemoglobin. The kinetics of the transformation between these states was studied in the pH range 6.9 to 9.0 in 0.3 m NaCl with a pH indicator (phenol red or m-cresol purple) to follow the pH changes accompanying flash photolysis of human carbon monoxide hemoglobin. At least three distinct processes involving protons were detected kinetically: a rapid uptake of H+ presumably reflecting the shift from the ligand-bound to ligand-free comformation, followed by a slower biphasic release of protons accompanying the dark reaction of CO and hemoglobin. The fast proton uptake occurred with a rate constant k = 8000 sec-1 (20°, pH 7.8), whereas the rate of the transition was greater both at pH 6.9 and 9.0 (k g 10,000 sec-1). The transition state parameters were also obtained: ΔH* = 11.2 ± 0.4 kcal per mole and ΔS* = -3.2 ± 1.5 e.u. The biphasic CO-binding and H+ release reactions following the flash were analyzed by treating the results as the sum of two simple exponential expressions; this procedure revealed that 27% of the reaction involving protons occurred at the higher rate. The rapidly reacting hemoglobin observed (50%) under these conditions (21 µm Hb, pH 7.6, 0.3 m NaCl, 60 µm CO, 25°) is attributed, on the basis of its dependence on carbon monoxide hemoglobin concentration, to the α1β1 dimer. The kinetic properties of both ligand binding and proton release were identical also at pH 6.95, 0.3 m NaCl, when carbon monoxide hemoglobin was subjected to flash photolysis in the presence of O2 (rate constant = 1850 sec-1). At pH 7.9, however, there was a distinct lag in release of hydrogen ions. The results are consistent with the recent structural interpretation of the Bohr effect (Perutz, M. F., Muirhead, H., Mazzarella, L., Crother, R. A., Greer, J., and Kilmartin, J. V., Nature, 222, 1240 (1969)), as well as the hypothesis that the α1β1 dimer is devoid of cooperative behavior."

Procedures are described for the complete resolution and partial purification of each of the aminoacyl transfer factors. One of the factors catalyzes a GTP and polyuridylic acid-dependent binding of phenylalanyl transfer RNA to ribosomes while the second factor facilitates the formation of peptidyl puromycin from nonenzymatically bound phenylalanyl-tRNA. Both of the factors catalyze a ribosome-dependent hydrolysis of GTP."
https://openalex.org/W1578613936,"The two components of nitrogenase of Clostridium pasteurianum, azoferredoxin and molybdoferredoxin, together with an electron donor, and energy source, and Mg++ are required for ATP-dependent H2 evolution and reductant-dependent ATP utilization. ATP is also utilized by this N2-fixing system without H2 evolution and without the need for an electron donor. For this activity there is still an absolute requirement for both azoferredoxin and molybdoferredoxin. The ratio of ATP utilized in the absence of reductant to that in the presence of reductant was approximately 1:3 at pH 6.6, whereas at pH 5.2 there was little difference between the two ATP-consuming activities. The ratio of ATP consumed to H2 evolved by the N2-fixing system at pH values between 6.0 and 7.6 varied between 3 and 8. At pH 6.6 a minimum ratio of 3 was obtained. No H2 was evolved in the absence of an electron donor even though ATP was consumed. When the amount of ATP used for each H2 evolved at all pH conditions was corrected for the amount of ATP used in the absence of the reductant, a constant ratio of 2 ATP per H2 evolved was obtained. The visible spectrum of molybdoferredoxin between 300 to 400 nm also changes with pH, suggesting that a certain form of the chromophore of molybdoferredoxin may be required for the reductant-dependent utilization of ATP."

https://openalex.org/W2017224247,"The synthesis and distribution of acetylcholine has been studied in the isolated synaptosome. Binding or contamination of [(14)C]acetylcholine in the synaptic vesicle fraction represents 1.5 percent of the total amount found in the synaptoplasm (synaptosomal cytoplasm). However, when the [(14)C]acetylcholine is derived solely by synthesis from labeled choline, then the labeled acetylcholine in the synaptic vesicle is 15 percent of the amount of acetylcholine synthesized in the synaptoplasm. The results suggest that the [(14)C]acetylcholine found in the vesicle fraction of synaptosomes incubated with labeled choline is due to vesicular synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1505399916,"Abstract Aspartokinase from the thermophilic bacterium Bacillus stearothermophilus has been partially purified and characterized. The enzyme has a temperature optimum near 55°, a pH optimum of 8.0, and requires both Mg++ and a monovalent cation for maximum activity. The enzyme is feedback inhibited by both lysine and threonine in a concerted manner and by each of the inhibitors individually. The sensitivity of the enzyme to the end products added individually or together decreases as the assay temperature is increased from 23 to 55°. This effect is most pronounced with respect to threonine inhibition. However, even at 55° the sensitivity of the enzyme to concerted feedback inhibition is comparable to that found at much lower temperatures for aspartokinases of mesophilic bacteria. Lysine and threonine singly or together act as noncompetitive inhibitors with respect to ATP and as mixed competitive-noncompetitive inhibitors with respect to aspartate at either 37 or 55°. Homotropic interactions could not be shown for either substrate in the presence or absence of the inhibitors. However, homotropic interactions with respect to threonine were observed as the assay temperature was increased. No such effect was shown for lysine over the same temperature range. The enzyme can be desensitized to feedback inhibition by a variety of treatments. With the exception of mercaptoethanol treatment, each desensitizing alteration results in decreased catalytic activity. These results suggest that regulatory sites for both lysine and threonine, in addition to the substrate sites, exist on the enzyme molecule."
