https://openalex.org/W92244565,"(Received for publication, September 6, 1962) Microsomes catalyze many mixed function oxidations and reductive syntheses. The enzymes involved appear to be tightly bound, and none has been successfully purified, with the exception of two systems which introduce electrons into micro- somal electron transport: DPNH-cytochrome"

After several conditioning sessions, the tone was progressively diminished to zero. The subject nevertheless continued to press the key whenever he emitted a thumb twitch, and he reported that he still heard the tone."

We have examined this possibility in several experimental contexts."

https://openalex.org/W2048165868,"LITTLE attention has been paid to the physiology of iron transfer through the mammary gland into milk, although a considerable amount of work has been done on absorption through the intestinal epithelium and on transfer from mother to fœtus through the placenta. Direct measurements of the iron content of milk have mostly been confined to man and dairy animals. The average concentration of iron is approximately 0.5 µg/ml. in both human and bovine milk1. This value is lower than the levels of plasma iron in the respective species. In rat milk, on the other hand, a mean iron concentration of 7 µg/ml., a figure which is higher than plasma iron values, was reported by Cox and Mueller2."

https://openalex.org/W1997805854,"The β-glucosides of coumarinic and o-coumaric acids were detected in extracts of cotyledons, exocarps, and seedling leaves of the tonka bean. The existence of these compounds and the presence of a β-glucosidase having specificity for coumarinyl glucoside suggest that the tonka bean synthesizes coumarin by a pathway similar to the one found in sweetclover"

https://openalex.org/W2036697326,"MOST of the radiobiological protection substances reported in the past are effective when they are administered during, or just before, irradiation, or when given in seriously toxic doses. Therefore, they are of little value for practical purposes except such a case as will be expected preliminarily in medical irradiation. The ideal radiobiological protection substance should give longer tolerance to radiation as in the case of an ideal agent against infectious disease—vaccine. Betz1 and Cronkite et al.2 have reported the change of the effects of whole-body pre-X-irradiation resulted in a reduced mortality rate in mice. But this previous irradiation should be avoided in consideration of cumulative genetic effect of radiation. We have adopted the inhalation of ozone of relatively low concentration as a previously administrative agent for radiation protection. Ozone is well known as radiomimetic3, but neither a leucopenia nor the existence of ozone was determined in the blood of the mice exposed in a relatively low concentration of ozone."

Although the strontium-90 content of hair is variable in these rats and appears to be subject to a variety of influences, determination of the radionuclide content of hair may offer a nondestructive method of estimating strontium-90 in bone."
https://openalex.org/W2077753663,"Three years ago a tone ending in unavoidable electric shock was periodically presented to pigeons while they pecked a key for food. When pecking was disrupted by tone, shock was disconnected and the training tone and tones of different frequencies were presented. At first all tones caused a reduction in the rate of pecking, but as testing proceeded the gradient narrowed. In our study, testing was resumed after a 2(1/2)-year interruption. Despite the interruption the tones still suppress behavior."

https://openalex.org/W2076565594,"KOSAKI et al.1–3 have recently reported the isolation of a new specific phospholipid, malignolipin, from malignant human and experimental tumours. They have described its role as a promoter of carcinogenesis4 and have claimed to have evolved a histological test for the identification of malignolipin5 and a diagnostic test for cancer6,7 based on the detection of this phospholipid in blood. Anti-malignolipin sera have been reported8 to reduce the viability of Yoshida sarcoma cells in vitro. These results await confirmation from other laboratories. The following therefore represents an attempt at isolating malignolipin from malignant tumours."

https://openalex.org/W2091608493,"IN conjunction with the microbiological transformation of steroids, small ring compounds were found to inhibit the breakdown of sterane structure. Since this phenomenon was encountered in the case of both fungi and bacteria1–4, the idea presented itself that this biochemical observation might be of more general validity. We therefore undertook to investigate the influence of 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (MNQ), found to be the most efficient by ourselves, on the effect of prednisolone in various pharmacological tests."

https://openalex.org/W2147540204,"WHILE engaged in the examination of metabolism and hydrolysis by soil bacteria of benzoic acid derivatives, amino-acids, and acylated amino-acids1–3, we have shown that there was a significant difference in strains of soil bacteria in their capability of metabolizing organic substances of different structures. We have now examined the metabolic activities of twenty-five strains of Escherichia coli standard O group on the following nineteen amino-acids to be used as a sole source of carbon: L-glutamic and DL-aspartic acids, DL-alanine, DL-serine, glycine, DL-valine, DL-leucine, L-isoleucine, DL-phenylalanine, L-tryptophan, DL-threonine, L-lysine, DL-methionine, L-cystine, L-arginine, L-histidine, L-tyrosine, L-proline, L-hydroxy-proline."
https://openalex.org/W1977290579,"IT has been observed in the past that somatic changes such as blister formation can be induced in hypnotized subjects by means of appropriate suggestion1,2. McDougall1 observed in several hypnotized subjects changes of surface temperature of 10° F (5.6° C) or more, produced after a few minutes of repeated suggestion of heat or coldness. It was thought, therefore, that skin temperature might rise following an illusory stimulus of heat in the heat illusion test2,3 with non-hypnotized subjects. Accordingly, the following experiment was carried out."
https://openalex.org/W2003273739,THE appearance of zones of opacity surrounding the growth of certain Staphylococci when cultured on nutrient agar containing human serum was reported by Christie and North1. They observed that: (a) the opacity occurred only with β-hæmolysin (hot–cold sheep hæmolysin) producing strains of bovine origin; (b) similar opacities occurred when an albumin fraction obtained by ammonium sulphate precipitation of the serum was substituted for whole serum in the medium. They believed that the opacity was produced as a result of denaturing of the albumin by the toxin released from the growing organism.
