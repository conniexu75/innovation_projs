Emilsson et al. investigated human serum proteins of more than 5000 Icelanders over the age of 65. The composition of blood serum includes a complex regulatory network of proteins that are globally coordinated across most or all tissues. The authors identified modules and functional groups associated with disease and health outcomes and were able to link genetic variants to complex diseases. Science , this issue p. 769"

Zhang et al. introduced a large strain in the material PbTiO 3 by growing it epitaxially in a composite with PbO. On the boundaries between the two materials, their normally different lattice constants were matched, giving rise to the strain. As a consequence, the films exhibited a very large electric polarization even in the absence of an electric field. The method may be applicable to generating other functional materials.

Sulfur is sometimes substituted for one of the phosphate oxygens during development of nucleotide-based drugs. Because of the geometry, this swap can lead to two different isomers. Knouse et al. report a pair of phosphorus reagents that conveniently produce either isomer selectively. This ability depended on the configuration of appended limonene substituents that are subsequently jettisoned. In addition to simplifying the route to sulfur-substituted oligonucleotides, these reagents will enable more precise studies of each isomer's distinct bioactivity. Science , this issue p. 1234"
https://openalex.org/W2886034460,"The cellular and mechanistic bases underlying endothelial regeneration of adult large vessels have proven challenging to study. Using a reproducible in vivo aortic endothelial injury model, we characterized cellular dynamics underlying the regenerative process through a combination of multi-color lineage tracing, parabiosis, and single-cell transcriptomics. We found that regeneration is a biphasic process driven by distinct populations arising from differentiated endothelial cells. The majority of cells immediately adjacent to the injury site re-enter the cell cycle during the initial damage response, with a second phase driven by a highly proliferative subpopulation. Endothelial regeneration requires activation of stress response genes including Atf3, and aged aortas compromised in their reparative capacity express less Atf3. Deletion of Atf3 reduced endothelial proliferation and compromised the regeneration. These findings provide important insights into cellular dynamics and mechanisms that drive responses to large vessel injury."

Too few stem cells, and the plant cannot grow. Too many, and growth runs amok. Zhou et al. analyzed the controls on stem cell proliferation.

In the so-called “strange metal” phase, these materials have resistivity that scales linearly with temperature, in contrast to the usual quadratic dependence of ordinary metals. Giraldo-Gallo et al. now find that at very high magnetic fields—up to 80 tesla—the resistivity of the thin films of a lanthanum-based cuprate scales linearly with magnetic field as well, again in contrast to the expected quadratic law. This dual linear dependence presents a challenge for theories of the normal state of the cuprates. Science , this issue p. 479"
https://openalex.org/W2885338433,"Alexander disease (AxD) is a leukodystrophy that primarily affects astrocytes and is caused by mutations in the astrocytic filament gene GFAP. While astrocytes are thought to have important roles in controlling myelination, AxD animal models do not recapitulate critical myelination phenotypes and it is therefore not clear how AxD astrocytes contribute to leukodystrophy. Here, we show that AxD patient iPSC-derived astrocytes recapitulate key features of AxD pathology such as GFAP aggregation. Moreover, AxD astrocytes inhibit proliferation of human iPSC-derived oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) in co-culture and reduce their myelination potential. CRISPR/Cas9-based correction of GFAP mutations reversed these phenotypes. Transcriptomic analyses of AxD astrocytes and postmortem brains identified CHI3L1 as a key mediator of AxD astrocyte-induced inhibition of OPC activity. Thus, this iPSC-based model of AxD not only recapitulates patient phenotypes not observed in animal models, but also reveals mechanisms underlying disease pathology and provides a platform for assessing therapeutic interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2885452802,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) form part of the host innate immune system, in which they act as sensors of microbial and endogenous danger signals. Upon TLR activation, the intracellular Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domains of TLR dimers initiate oligomerization of a multiprotein signaling platform comprising myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88) and members of the interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) family. Formation of this myddosome complex initiates signal transduction pathways, leading to the activation of transcription factors and the production of inflammatory cytokines. To date, little is known about the assembly and disassembly of the myddosome and about the mechanisms by which these complexes mediate multiple downstream signaling pathways. Here, we isolated myddosome complexes from whole-cell lysates of TLR-activated primary mouse macrophages and from IRAK reporter macrophages to examine the kinetics of myddosome assembly and disassembly. Using a selective inhibitor of IRAK4's kinase activity, we found that whereas TLR cytokine responses were ablated, myddosome formation was stabilized in the absence of IRAK4's kinase activity. Of note, IRAK4 inhibition had only a minimal effect on NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. In summary, our results indicate that IRAK4 has a critical scaffold function in myddosome formation and that its kinase activity is dispensable for myddosome assembly and activation of the NF-κB and MAPK pathways but is essential for MyD88-dependent production of inflammatory cytokines. Our findings suggest that the scaffold function of IRAK4 may be an attractive target for treating inflammatory and autoimmune diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2885209431,"During the evolution into castration or therapy resistance, prostate cancer cells reprogram the androgen responses to cope with the diminishing level of androgens, and undergo metabolic adaption to the nutritionally deprived and hypoxia conditions. AR (androgen receptor) and PKM2 (pyruvate kinase M2) have key roles in these processes. We report in this study, KDM8/JMJD5, a histone lysine demethylase/dioxygnase, exhibits a novel property as a dual coactivator of AR and PKM2 and as such, it is a potent inducer of castration and therapy resistance. Previously, we showed that KDM8 is involved in the regulation of cell cycle and tumor metabolism in breast cancer cells. Its role in prostate cancer has not been explored. Here, we show that KDM8's oncogenic properties in prostate cancer come from its direct interaction (1) with AR to affect androgen response and (2) with PKM2 to regulate tumor metabolism. The interaction with AR leads to the elevated expression of androgen response genes in androgen-deprived conditions. They include ANCCA/ATAD2 and EZH2, which are directly targeted by KDM8 and involved in sustaining the survival of the cells under hormone-deprived conditions. Notably, in enzalutamide-resistant cells, the expressions of both KDM8 and EZH2 are further elevated, so are neuroendocrine markers. Consequently, EZH2 inhibitors or KDM8 knockdown both resensitize the cells toward enzalutamide. In the cytosol, KDM8 associates with PKM2, the gatekeeper of pyruvate flux and translocates PKM2 into the nucleus, where the KDM8/PKM2 complex serves as a coactivator of HIF-1α to upregulate glycolytic genes. Using shRNA knockdown, we validate KDM8's functions as a regulator for both androgen-responsive and metabolic genes. KDM8 thus presents itself as an ideal therapeutic target for metabolic adaptation and castration-resistance of prostate cancer cells."

Furthermore, Flores has an extant population of pygmy humans, and H. floresiensis exhibited a diminutive adult size relative to other hominins. Tucci et al. examined genetic variation among 32 individuals, including 10 sequenced genomes, from a population of pygmies living close to the cave where H. floresiensis remains were discovered. These individuals exhibit signatures of polygenic selection explaining the short stature and have genomic content from both Neanderthals and Denisovans, but no additional archaic lineages. Thus, restricted height is under selection at this location and has evolved independently at least twice in hominins. Science , this issue p. 511"

This study describes a fast proteomic method by LC-Q-orbitrap-MS analysis with in-strip digestion and investigates the tear proteome of dry eye patients. Schirmer's strips were used for collection of tear fluid from patients. These strips were cut into pieces and directly digested with trypsin before mass spectrometry analysis. The data showed that more than 50 proteins were found in tear fluid from dry eye patients. Gene Ontology (GO) annotation showed that most of proteins were transfer/carrier proteins, hydrolyses, enzyme modulators and signaling molecules. Targeted proteomics strategy revealed that 18 proteins were differentially expressed in dry eye patients. Furthermore, it was showed that the common post-translational modification in tear proteins is deamidation of Asn."
https://openalex.org/W2886396477,"High-glucose (HG) levels and hyperglycemia associated with diabetes are known to cause neuronal damage. The detailed molecular mechanisms, however, remain to be elucidated. Here, we investigated the role of transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7) channels in HG-mediated endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) and injury of NS20Y neuronal cells. The cells were incubated in the absence or presence of HG for 48 h. We found that mRNA and protein levels of TRPM7 and of ERS-associated proteins, such as C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78), and inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS), increased in HG-treated cells, along with significantly increased TRPM7-associated currents in these cells. Similar results were obtained in cerebral cortical tissue from an insulin-deficiency model of diabetic mice. Moreover, HG treatment of cells activated ERS-associated proapoptotic caspase activity and induced cellular injury. Interestingly, a NOS inhibitor, l-NAME, suppressed the HG-induced increase of TRPM7 expression and cellular injury. siRNA-mediated TRPM7 knockdown or chemical inhibition of TRPM7 activity also suppressed HG-induced ERS and decreased cleaved caspase-12/caspase-3 levels and cell injury. Of note, TRPM7 overexpression increased ERS and cell injury independently of its kinase activity. Taken together, our findings suggest that TRPM7 channel activities play a key role in HG-associated ERS and cytotoxicity through an apoptosis-inducing signaling cascade involving HG, iNOS, TRPM7, ERS proteins, and caspases."
https://openalex.org/W2887344322,"The human intestinal microbiota contains a vast community of microorganisms increasingly studied using high-throughput DNA sequencing. Standardized protocols for storage and DNA extraction from fecal samples have been established mostly for bacterial microbiota analysis. Here, we investigated the impact of storage and DNA extraction on bacterial and fungal community structures detected concomitantly.Fecal samples from healthy adults were stored at -80°C as such or diluted in RNAlater® and subjected to 2 extraction protocols with mechanical lysis: the Powersoil® MoBio kit or the International Human Microbiota Standard (IHMS) Protocol Q. Libraries of the 12 samples targeting the V3-V4 16S and the ITS1 regions were prepared using Metabiote® (Genoscreen) and sequenced on GS-FLX-454. Sequencing data were analysed using SHAMAN (http://shaman.pasteur.fr/). The bacterial and fungal microbiota were compared in terms of diversity and relative abundance.We obtained 171869 and 199089 quality-controlled reads for 16S and ITS, respectively. All 16S reads were assigned to 41 bacterial genera; only 52% of ITS reads were assigned to 40 fungal genera/section. Rarefaction curves were satisfactory in 3/3 and 2/3 subjects for 16S and ITS, respectively. PCoA showed important inter-individual variability of intestinal microbiota largely overweighing the effect of storage or extraction. Storage in RNAlater® impacted (downward trend) the relative abundances of 7/41 bacterial and 6/40 fungal taxa, while extraction impacted randomly 18/41 bacterial taxa and 1/40 fungal taxon.Our results showed that RNAlater® moderately impacts bacterial or fungal community structures, while extraction significantly influences the bacterial composition. For combined bacterial and fungal intestinal microbiota analysis, immediate sample freezing should be preferred when feasible, but storage in RNAlater® remains an option under unfavourable conditions or for concomitant metatranscriptomic analysis; and extraction should rely on protocols validated for bacterial analysis, such as IHMS Protocol Q, and including a powerful mechanical lysis, essential for fungal extraction."
https://openalex.org/W2886979248,"Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) constitute a family of noncoding RNAs that are classically known as guide RNAs for processing and modification of ribosomal RNAs. Recently, it was discovered that snoRNAs can be further processed into sno-derived RNAs (sdRNAs), some of which are known to exhibit microRNA-like properties. SdRNAs have been implicated in human cancer; however, a systems-level sdRNA landscape in human cancers is lacking. Through integrative analysis of ~22 nt size-selected smRNA-seq datasets from 10,262 patient samples across 32 cancer types, we mapped a pan-cancer sdRNAome and interrogated its signatures in multiple clinically relevant features, particularly cancer immunity and clinical outcome. Aggregating sdRNA abundances by parental snoRNAs, these expression signatures alone are sufficient to distinguish patients with distinct cancer types. Interestingly, a large panel of sdRNAs are significantly correlated with features of the tumor-immune microenvironment, such as immunosuppressive markers, CD8+ T cell infiltration, cytolytic T cell activity, and tumor vasculature. A set of individual sdRNAs with tumor-immune signatures can also stratify patient survival. These findings implicate snoRNAs and their derivative sdRNAs as a class of prevalent noncoding molecular markers of human cancer immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2952312365,"The lifestyle and feeding habits of nematodes are highly diverse. Several species of Pristionchus (Nematoda: Diplogastridae), including Pristionchus pacificus, have been reported to be necromenic, i.e. to associate with beetles in their dauer diapause stage and wait until the death of their host to resume development and feed on microbes in the decomposing beetle corpse. We review the literature and suggest that the association of Pristionchus to beetles may be phoretic and not necessarily necromenic. The view that Pristionchus nematodes have a necromenic lifestyle is based on studies that have sought Pristionchus only by sampling live beetles. By surveying for nematode genera in different types of rotting vegetal matter, we found Pristionchus spp. at a similar high frequency as Caenorhabditis, often in large numbers and in feeding stages. Thus, these Pristionchus species may feed in decomposing vegetal matter. In addition, we report that one species of Panagrellus (Nematoda: Panagrolaimidae), Panagrellus redivivoides, is found in rotting fruits but not in rotting stems, with a likely association with Drosophila fruitflies. Based on our sampling and the observed distribution of feeding and dauer stages, we propose a life cycle for Pristionchus nematodes and Panagrellus redivivoides that is similar to that of C. elegans, whereby they feed on the microbial blooms on decomposing vegetal matter and are transported between food patches by coleopterans for Pristionchus spp., fruitflies for Panagrellus redivivoides and isopods and terrestrial molluscs for C. elegans."
https://openalex.org/W2887866357,"Human gait analysis provides valuable information regarding the way of walking of a given subject. Low-cost RGB-D cameras, such as the Microsoft Kinect, are able to estimate the 3-D position of several body joints without requiring the use of markers. This 3-D information can be used to perform objective gait analysis in an affordable, portable, and non-intrusive way. In this contribution, we present a system for fully automatic gait analysis using a single RGB-D camera, namely the second version of the Kinect. Our system does not require any manual intervention (except for starting/stopping the data acquisition), since it firstly recognizes whether the subject is walking or not, and identifies the different gait cycles only when walking is detected. For each gait cycle, it then computes several gait parameters, which can provide useful information in various contexts, such as sports, healthcare, and biometric identification. The activity recognition is performed by a predictive model that distinguishes between three activities (walking, standing and marching), and between two postures of the subject (facing the sensor, and facing away from it). The model was built using a multilayer perceptron algorithm and several measures extracted from 3-D joint data, achieving an overall accuracy and F1 score of 98%. For gait cycle detection, we implemented an algorithm that estimates the instants corresponding to left and right heel strikes, relying on the distance between ankles, and the velocity of left and right ankles. The algorithm achieved errors for heel strike instant and stride duration estimation of 15 ± 25 ms and 1 ± 29 ms (walking towards the sensor), and 12 ± 23 ms and 2 ± 24 ms (walking away from the sensor). Our gait cycle detection solution can be used with any other RGB-D camera that provides the 3-D position of the main body joints."

The prevalence of newly detected diabetes in pregnancy was similar among the different ethnic groups. The T2DM group was older (mean age in years was 34 ±5.7 vs 31.7±5.7 vs 29.7 ±5.7, p<0.001); and has a higher mean BMI (32.4±6.4 kg/m2 vs 31.7±6.2 kg/m2 vs 29.7± 6.2 kg/m2, p< 0.01) than the GDM and the non-DM groups, respectively. The frequency of pre-eclampsia, pre-term delivery, Caesarean-section, macrosomia, LGA and neonatal ICU admissions were significantly higher in the T2DM group compared to GDM and non-DM groups.Diabetes first detected in pregnancy is equally prevalent among the various ethnic groups residing in Qatar. Newly detected T2DM carries a higher risk of poor pregnancy outcomes; stressing the importance of proper classification of cases of newly detected diabetes in pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W2885265774,"Background First line chemotherapy is effective in 75 to 80% of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). We studied whether microRNA (miR) expression profiles can predict treatment outcome for first line fluoropyrimidine containing systemic therapy in patients with mCRC. Methods MiR expression levels were determined by next generation sequencing from snap frozen tumor samples of 88 patients with mCRC. Predictive miRs were selected with penalized logistic regression and posterior forward selection. The prediction co-efficients of the miRs were re-estimated and validated by real-time quantitative PCR in an independent cohort of 81 patients with mCRC. Results Expression levels of miR-17-5p, miR-20a-5p, miR-30a-5p, miR-92a-3p, miR-92b-3p and miR-98-5p in combination with age, tumor differentiation, adjuvant therapy and type of systemic treatment, were predictive for clinical benefit in the training cohort with an AUC of 0.78. In the validation cohort the addition of the six miR signature to the four clinicopathological factors demonstrated a significant increased AUC for predicting treatment response versus those with stable disease (SD) from 0.79 to 0.90. The increase for predicting treatment response versus progressive disease (PD) and for patients with SD versus those with PD was not significant. in the validation cohort. MiR-17-5p, miR-20a-5p and miR-92a-3p were significantly upregulated in patients with treatment response in both the training and validation cohorts. Conclusion A six miR expression signature was identified that predicted treatment response to fluoropyrimidine containing first line systemic treatment in patients with mCRC when combined with four clinicopathological factors. Independent validation demonstrated added predictive value of this miR-signature for predicting treatment response versus SD. However, added predicted value for separating patients with PD could not be validated. The clinical relevance of the identified miRs for predicting treatment response has to be further explored."

Although the suppressive effect of vitamin D/vitamin D receptor (VDR) signaling has been shown in the context of oral lichen planus (OLP), the molecular basis of its regulatory function remains poorly understood. Herein, we reported that miR-802 over-expression in OLP could aggravate apoptosis of oral keratinocytes by targeting B-cell lymphoma 2 mRNA. In addition, vitamin D/VDR signaling was able to suppress miR-802 expression in LPS-treated or activated CD4+ T cell-stimulated human oral keratinocytes by blocking NF-κB pathways, thereby inhibiting OLP apoptosis. Consistent with the results in vitro, we showed that miR-802 expression was enhanced in oral keratinocytes from VDR-/- mice, and an inverse correlation between VDR and miR-802 was found in human biopsy specimens of OLP.

https://openalex.org/W2887985575,"We evaluated the chemical coding of the myenteric plexus in the proximal and distal intestine of gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata), which represents one of the most farmed fish in the Mediterranean area. The presence of nitric oxide (NO), acetylcholine (ACh), serotonin (5-HT), calcitonin-gene-related peptide (CGRP), substance P (SP) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) containing neurons, was investigated in intestinal whole mount preparations of the longitudinal muscle with attached the myenteric plexus (LMMP) by means of immunohistochemical fluorescence staining. The main excitatory and inhibitory neurochemicals identified in intestinal smooth muscle were ACh, SP, 5HT, and NO, VIP, CGRP. Some neurons displayed morphological features of ascending and descending interneurons and of putative sensory neurons. The expression of these pathways in the two intestinal regions is largely superimposable, although some differences emerged, which may be relevant to the morphological properties of each region. The most important variances are the higher neuronal density and soma size in the proximal intestine, which may depend on the volume of the target tissue. Since in the fish gut the submucosal plexus is less developed, myenteric neurons substantially innervate also the submucosal and epithelial layers, which display a major thickness and surface in the proximal intestine. In addition, myenteric neurons containing ACh and SP, which mainly represent excitatory motor neurons and interneurons innervating the smooth muscle were more numerous in the distal intestine, possibly to sustain motility in the thicker smooth muscle coat. Overall, this study expands our knowledge of the intrinsic innervation that regulates intestinal secretion, absorption and motility in gilthead sea bream and provides useful background information for rational design of functional feeds aimed at improving fish gut health."
https://openalex.org/W2886603545,"Estimating the number of animals participating in a choral display may contribute reliable information on animal population estimates, particularly when environmental or behavioral factors restrict the possibility of visual surveys. Difficulties in providing a reliable estimate of the number of singers in a chorus are many (e.g., background noise masking, overlap). In this work, we contributed data on the vocal chorusing of the indri lemurs (Indri indri), which emit howling cries, known as songs, uttered by two to five individuals. We examined whether we could estimate the number of emitters in a chorus by screening the fundamental frequency in the spectrograms and the total duration of the songs, and the reliability of those methods when compared to the real chorus size. The spectrographic investigation appears to provide reliable information on the number of animals participating in the chorusing only when this number is limited to two or three singers. We also found that the Acoustic Complexity Index positively correlated with the real chorus size, showing that an automated analysis of the chorus may provide information about the number of singers. We can state that song duration shows a correlation with the number of emitters but also shows a remarkable variation that remains unexplained. The accuracy of the estimates can reflect the high variability in chorus size, which could be affected by group composition, season and context. In future research, a greater focus on analyzing frequency change occurring during these collective vocal displays should improve our ability to detect individuals and allow a finer tuning of the acoustic methods that may serve for monitoring chorusing mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2887298079,"Gefitinib and erlotinib are epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs). Although EGFR-TKIs are effective as anti-cancer drugs, cancer cells sometimes gain tolerance to the drugs. Previous studies suggested that the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)-signaling pathway could serve as compensation for the EGFR-signaling pathway inhibited by EGFR-TKIs. Our study further suggested that FGF2, a FGFR ligand, leaked out from naïve cells killed by gefitinib could initiate the FGFR-signaling pathway in surviving cells; i.e., altruistic survival may occur in naïve cells immediately after EGFR-TKI treatment. Altruistic survival may be temporal, and cells need to change their gene regulation toward gaining resistance to EGFR-TKIs. Changes in such gene regulation after EGFR-TKI treatment are poorly understood. In this study, we examined early events of such gene regulation changes in human adenocarcinoma PC-9 cells that are capable of changing their nature from susceptibility to resistance to EFGR-TKIs. Our study indicated that activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) occurred in the cells immediately after EGFR-TKI treatment and also by gene silencing against oncogenic EGFR; and, MG132 treatment for inhibiting NF-κB activation affected cell viability. Taken together, our findings (including the previous study) suggest that altruistic survival and NF-κB activation might be vital for initiating the acquisition of EGFR-TKI resistance."

However, AChE has been proposed to also have nonneuronal functions in different cell types. Here, we report that AChE is expressed in melanocytes and melanoma cells, and that the tetrameric (G4) form is the major AChE isoform in these cells. During melanogenesis of B16F10 murine melanoma cells, AChE levels decreased markedly. The differentiation of melanoma cells led to (i) an increase in melanin and tyrosinase, (ii) a change in intracellular cAMP levels, and (iii) a decrease in microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF). We hypothesized that the regulation of AChE during melanogenesis is mediated by two transcription factors: cAMP-response element–binding protein (CREB) and MITF. In melanoma cells, exogenous cAMP suppressed AChE expression and the promoter activity of the ACHE gene. This suppression was mediated by a cAMP-response element (CRE) located on the ACHE promoter, as mutation of CRE relieved the suppression. In melanoma, MITF overexpression induced ACHE transcription, and mutation of an E-box site in human ACHE promoter blocked this induction. An AChE inhibitor greatly enhanced acetylcholine-mediated responses of melanogenic gene expression levels in vitro; however, this enhancement was not observed in the presence of agonists of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor.

This basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper transcription factor MITF binds to E-box sequence in promoter region of genes coding for melanin synthesis, including tyrosinase (TYR), tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TRP1), and DOPA-chrome tautomerase (DCT).

Indeed, autocrine and paracrine acetylcholine (ACh) is required to sustain the viability of keratinocytes in vivo. In human melanocytes, muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR) on cell membrane regulate the concentration of intracellular free Ca2+ in response to ACh released by keratinocytes affecting skin pigmentation (9Grando S.A.

However, the expression profiles of other cholinergic molecules in skin-related cells and their effect in skin pigmentation have not been fully elucidated. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) (EC 3.1.1.7) is an enzyme hydrolyzing ACh into acetate and choline. It is located on postsynaptic membrane and plays an important role in terminating the ACh-mediated signal transmission. In mammals, mRNA splicing generates three known variants of AChE transcripts: read-through (AChER), hydrophobic (AChEH), and tailed (AChET) (12Rachinsky T.L. Camp S. Li Y. Ekström T.J. Newton M. Taylor P. Molecular cloning of mouse acetylcholinesterase: tissue distribution of alternatively spliced mRNA species.Neuron. 1990; 5 (10.1016/0896-6273(90)90168-F 2400605): 317-327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Through posttranslational modifications, AChER forms soluble monomers (G1), which are involved in response to psychological stress (13Meshorer E. Erb C. Gazit R. Pavlovsky L. Kaufer D. Friedman A.

AChEH is anchored via phosphatidylinositol to erythrocyte membranes as dimers (G2) (14Luk W.K. Chen V.P. Choi R.C. Tsim K.W.

AChET and collagen Q (ColQ) form an asymmetric enzyme at neuromuscular junctions (16Tsim K.W. Randall W.R. Barnard E.A.

The nonneuronal functions of AChE in various tissues have been proposed by different groups (20Soreq H. Seidman S. Acetylcholinesterase—new roles for an old actor.Nat. Rev.

AChE is expressed in bone tissue, osteoblast, and osteoblast-like cell lines. The expression of AChE is by Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway during osteoblastic differentiation, suggesting its function in bone formation (21Xu M.L. Bi C.W.C. Liu E.Y.L. Dong T.T.X. Tsim K.W.K.

The presence of AChE in epidermis was shown in patients suffering from vitiligo (22Iyengar B.

In this study, we found that AChET was the major variant constituting G4 AChE in melanocytes and melanoma; the activity and expression levels of AChE decreased during the melanogenesis progress; and ACh, the agonist of AChR, inhibited melanin production. The expression of AChE in B16F10 cells, Melan-A cells, human epidermal melanocytes (HEM), and rat dermal fibroblasts (RDF) was recognized by using anti-AChE antibody in immunostaining (Fig. 1A). AChE activities were measured in these cultures. In sucrose density gradient analysis, G4 was the major form of AChE being found in all tested cell types (Fig. 1B). The G1/G2 forms were at relatively low level. Immunofluorescence staining of mouse skin showed that AChE was highly expressed in melanocytes (indicated by TYR as marker) (Fig. 1C). The G1/G2 and G4 forms of AChE showed similar levels of activity in skin, which could be because of the presence of various cell types in skin, e.g. keratinocytes. The localization of AChE in plasma membrane of cultured B16F10 cells was shown (supplemental Fig. 1A). The mRNA encoding AChER, AChEH, and AChET were quantified by qPCR. Both B16F10 and Melan-A cells contained the most copies of AChET variant, at least 2-fold higher than that of AChER or AChEH (Fig. 1D). B16F10 murine melanoma cell is an in vitro model for the study of melanogenesis. During the melanogenesis, the amount of melanin in B16F10 cells increased; the plateau of melanin production, which was ∼2.5-fold of increase, was reached at about 4 days after culture (Fig. 2A). On the contrary, the enzymatic activity of AChE decreased at least by 50% during this process (Fig. 2A). The level of intracellular cAMP, a known regulator for melanogenesis, peaked on day 2 before dropping to the basal level (Fig. 2A). According to results from sucrose density gradient analysis, the G4 form was the major AChE form being regulated during melanogenesis (Fig. 2B). The promoter constructs pAChE-Luc and pCRE-Luc were transfected into cultured B16F10 cells, and the promoter-driven luciferase activities were decreased to a low level after 4 days of culture. The promoter activity of pCRE-Luc peaked on day 2, similar to that of cAMP level (Fig. 2C). The AChE and MITF mRNA levels decreased by ∼50% during melanogenesis (Fig. 2D). TYR mRNA peaked on day 3 of culture before a decline. The amount of AChE protein (∼60 kDa) decreased by ∼40% during melanogenesis (Fig. 2E), correlating to the trends in activity and mRNA levels. The amount of TYR protein (∼80 kDa) reached its plateau on day 3 of culture before a decline (Fig. 2E). MITF protein (∼60 kDa) level was markedly reduced by over 70% (Fig. 2E). To conclude, the expression of AChE, TYR, and MITF were in synchronization at both transcriptional and translational levels. The protein kinase A (PKA) and CREB phosphorylation also showed the similar tendencies that they reached their highest levels on day 2 before attenuation (Fig. 2, F and G). These data suggest that during melanogenesis, the regulation of AChE could be triggered by increased intracellular cAMP. Resembling phenomenon was reported during the formation of myotube (26Choi R.C. Siow N.L. Zhu S.Q. Tsim K.W. The cAMP-dependent protein kinase mediates the expression of AChE in chick myotubes.Neuroreport. 2000; 11 (10.1097/00001756-200003200-00029 10757523): 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The cAMP-dependent signaling is a dominant pathway in regulating melanogenesis (27D'Mello S.A. Finlay G.J. Baguley B.C. Askarian-Amiri M.E. Signaling pathways in melanogenesis.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2016; 17 (10.3390/ijms17071144 27428965): 1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of cAMP in AChE expression, cultured B16F10 cells were treated with Bt2-cAMP for 24 h. The Bt2-cAMP treatment reduced AChE activity in a dose-dependent manner; AChE activity decreased to around 60% after 1 mm Bt2-cAMP treatment (Fig. 3A). However, melanin amount increased by over 50% in response to the same Bt2-cAMP treatment (Fig. 3A). AChE mRNA production was suppressed after administration of 1 mm Bt2-cAMP whereas the mRNAs of TYR and MITF increased drastically in the presence of Bt2-cAMP (Fig. 3B). The protein levels of AChE, TYR, and MITF were determined in Bt2-cAMP–treated B16F10 cells after 12 h of Bt2-cAMP administration. TYR expression was transiently induced; AChE was down-regulated by ∼80%; and MITF protein expression was induced by ∼8-fold (Fig. 3C). The role of cAMP in regulating AChE expression was unfolded by measuring luciferase activities of cultured B16F10 cells transfected with plasmids coding fusion genes pAChE-Luc and pCRE-Luc. The suppression of pAChE-Luc activity in transfected B16F10 cells, induced by Bt2-cAMP, was rescued by a PKA inhibitor H89 at 10 μm (Fig. 4A). The suppression was not fully rescued, possibly because of incomplete blockage of PKA activity by H89. CRE site was identified in human ACHE gene (28Mutero A. Camp S. Taylor P. Promoter elements of the mouse acetylcholinesterase gene transcriptional regulation during muscle differentiation.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270 (10.1074/jbc.270.4.1866 7829523): 1866-1872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was conducted to generate a promoter construct pAChEΔCRE-Luc (Fig. 4B). B16F10 cells transfected with this mutant showed no observable response to Bt2-cAMP (Fig. 4C), suggesting an important role of CRE site in AChE regulation during melanogenesis. Similarly, the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin showed same effects as those of Bt2-cAMP in the activities of pCRE-Luc, pAChE-Luc, and pAChEΔCRE-Luc, as well as AChE activity (supplemental Fig. 1B). In summary, the expression of AChE was suppressed by cAMP through CRE-binding site in the promoter of ACHE. MITF is the master transcription factor of melanogenesis and development of melanocyte/melanoma. It acts through binding to E-box motifs consisting of a core hexa-nucleotide sequence CAXXTG (X can be A/T/C/G). E-box is identified in genes encoding TYR and its related protein TRP1 (29Hemesath T.J. Steingrímsson E. McGill G. Hansen M.J. Vaught J. Hodgkinson C.A. Arnheiter H. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Fisher D.E. Microphthalmia, a critical factor in melanocyte development, defines a discrete transcription factor family.Genes Dev. 1994; 8 (10.1101/gad.8.22.2770 7958932): 2770-2780Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Because the E-box motif CAGCTG was found between exons 1 and 2 of mammalian ACHE gene (28Mutero A. Camp S. Taylor P. Promoter elements of the mouse acetylcholinesterase gene transcriptional regulation during muscle differentiation.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270 (10.1074/jbc.270.4.1866 7829523): 1866-1872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that this motif serves as a binding site for MITF. To determine whether ACHE transcription is influenced by MITF, DNA construct encoding MITF was transiently transfected into cultured B16F10 cells to overexpress MITF. The resultant transcriptional expression of AChE and TYR increased by 50% (Fig. 5A). The protein level of AChE increased by over 70% (Fig. 5A). The internal control protein GAPDH showed no observable change. The binding of MITF to the ACHE gene was further monitored by ChIP assay. In MITF overexpression group, the DNA enrichment by immunoprecipitation with anti-MITF antibody was more than 4-fold, doubling the DNA enrichment in the control group (vehicle only) (Fig. 5B). This result implied that the binding of MITF to E-box motif in ACHE gene is associated to an up-regulation of AChE mRNA and protein. This E-box motif is highly conserved in mammalian species (Fig. 5C). To further confirm the binding of this E-box to MITF, the E-box of human AChE promoter was mutated in a luciferase plasmid pAChEΔE-box-Luc for further transfection in B16F10 cells (Fig. 5C). pAChEΔE-box-Luc did not show response in luciferase activity to MITF overexpression; whereas an induction was observed in the native pAChE-Luc construct (Fig. 5D). During the development of the melanocytes and melanoma cells, α-MSH is produced and activates MC1R (Gs protein couple receptor) thus increasing adenylyl cyclase activity. ACh functions as a ligand agonist of mAChR and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) (30Tiwari P. Dwivedi S. Singh M.P. Mishra R. Chandy A. Basic and modern concepts on cholinergic receptor: A review.Asian Pac. J. Trop. Dis. 2013; 3 (10.1016/S2222-1808(13)60094-8): 413-420Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). When activated, mAChR M2 and M4 subtypes coupled with Gi proteins inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity, leading to a decrease in cAMP level in cells (31Ashkenazi A. Winslow J.W. Peralta E.G. Peterson G.L. Schimerlik M.I. Capon D.J. Ramachandran J. An M2 muscarinic receptor subtype coupled to both adenylyl cyclase and phosphoinositide turnover.Science. 1987; 238 (10.1126/science.2823384 2823384): 672-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). To determine the role of ACh in melanogenesis, cultured B16F10 cells were treated with ACh, with or without AChE inhibitor BW284c51 for determination of melanin contents (Fig. 6A). Melanin production in B16F10 cells was slightly affected by ACh but was significantly reduced when treated with AChE inhibitor (BW284c51). This suggests that the surface AChE of melanocyte cells mediates the proposed ACh-melanogenesis signal-transduction pathway. To further confirm the inhibitory effect of ACh on melanogenesis, cultured B16F10 cells were transfected with pCRE-Luc, pTYR-Luc, and pMITF-Luc constructs before treatment of ACh, with or without BW284c51 (Fig. 6A). Correlating the response with melanin production, the luciferase activities downstream of CRE promoter, TYR promoter, and MITF promoter were significantly down-regulated by ACh, especially when BW284c51 was applied. The Western blotting result also indicated that the protein levels of MITF and TYR were reduced significantly in B16F10 cells, when the cultures were subjected to ACh administration and AChE inhibition (Fig. 6B). The level of pCRE-Luc activity did not change in either AChE-knockdown or AChE-overexpressing cells. Nonetheless, it was altered when the cells were cotreated with ACh and BW284c51 (Fig. 6C). In all cases, the applied AChE inhibitor did not fully reduce the expression of aforementioned markers, implying that part of these expressions might not be cholinergic dependent. The immunostaining of mAChR M2 and M4 subtypes showed in B16F10 cells were positive (Fig. 7A). Over 50% AChE was colocalized with M2 and/or M4 mAChRs. To investigate whether M2/M4 mAChRs mediate inhibition on melanin synthesis, muscarine (an mAChR agonist) and oxotremorine sesquifumarate (an M2/M4 mAChR–specific agonist), AF-DX 116 (an M2 mAChR antagonist), and PD 102807 (an M4 mAChR antagonist) were applied in B16F10 cells. Muscarine or oxotremorine sesquifumarate caused down-regulation of pCRE-Luc and pMITF-Luc activities by ∼30%, but the effect was insensitive to BW284c51 treatment (Fig. 7B). The oxotremorine sesquifumarate–suppressed pCRE-Luc/pMITF-Luc activities were counteracted by AF-DX 116 and/or PD 102807 (Fig. 7C). These results suggest that ACh could mediate melanogenesis through M2/M4 mAChRs. Roles of AChE in cell development of different tissues were extensively studied for years. In muscle myogenesis, the regulation of AChE has been proposed to be mediated by a cAMP/PKA-dependent signaling (19Liu E.Y. Xu M.L. Jin Y. Wu Q. Dong T.T. Tsim K.W.

This exploratory qualitative study includes a literature review in related disciplines and the results from ten focus group interviews. Based on the interviews, this study proposes four dimensions of HBV (i.e., superiority, self-development, individuality, and authenticity) and a hierarchical process among the antecedents (i.e., social comparison, social competition, and social norms), the pursuit of HBV, and the consequences (i.e., emotional, attitudinal, and behavioral aspects). Participants from each culture revealed a unique hierarchical process of HBV that reflects both cultural universality and specificity. The results of this study lead to new knowledge about East Asian women’s identities and perceptions of beauty. In addition, the proposed concept, HBV, can broaden the academic lens for beauty-related disciplines."
https://openalex.org/W2887945507,"During a post-encoding delay period, the ongoing consolidation of recently acquired memories can suffer interference if the delay period involves encoding of new memories, or sensory stimulation tasks. Interestingly, two recent independent studies suggest that (i) autobiographical thinking also interferes markedly with ongoing consolidation of recently learned wordlist material, while (ii) a 2-Back task might not interfere with ongoing consolidation, possibly due to the suppression of autobiographical thinking. In this study, we directly compare these conditions against a quiet wakeful rest baseline to test whether the promotion (via familiar sound-cues) or suppression (via a 2-Back task) of autobiographical thinking during the post-encoding delay period can affect consolidation of studied wordlists in a negative or a positive way, respectively. Our results successfully replicate previous studies and show a significant interference effect (as compared to the rest condition) when learning is followed by familiar sound-cues that promote autobiographical thinking, whereas no interference effect is observed when learning is followed by the 2-Back task. Results from a post-experimental experience-sampling questionnaire further show significant differences in the degree of autobiographical thinking reported during the three post-encoding periods: highest in the presence of sound-cues and lowest during the 2-Back task. In conclusion, our results suggest that varying levels of autobiographical thought during the post-encoding period may modulate episodic memory consolidation."
https://openalex.org/W2885616319,"Background To elucidate the characteristics of pneumonia in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and to assess whether pneumonia in RA patients differs from that in non-RA patients. Methods We retrospectively divided pneumonia patients into two groups, those with RA and those without RA, and compared the two groups. We evaluated the risk factors for mortality with univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results Among 1549 patients, 71 had RA. The RA patients with pneumonia were 71.0±8.9 years old, 54.9% were female, 40.9% had a smoking history, and 71.8% had underlying respiratory disease. Female sex, non-smoker, and respiratory comorbidities were statistically more frequent in the RA patients than non-RA patients. The most frequent causative microbial agents of pneumonia in the RA patients were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and influenza virus, whereas those of pneumonia in non-RA patients were S. pneumoniae, influenza virus, M. pneumoniae, Legionella spp., P. aeruginosa, H. influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Polymicrobial infection were identified as etiologies more frequently in the RA patients than non-RA patients. Although the severity of pneumonia did not differ between the two groups, mortality was statistically higher in the RA patients than non-RA patients. Multivariate analysis showed RA to be an independent risk factor for mortality. Conclusions P. aeruginosa, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, and polymicrobial infection were statistically more frequent etiologies of pneumonia in the RA patients than non-RA patients. RA itself was found to be an independent risk factor for mortality from pneumonia."
https://openalex.org/W2886888258,"Low plasma fibrinogen level is common after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Current substitution practice with fibrinogen concentrate generally follows a single measurement and cut-off values from the literature, whereas early postoperative endogenous fibrinogen kinetics is incompletely described and widely disregarded. The aim of this study was to determine the short-term recovery pattern of plasma fibrinogen after CPB weaning. Our hypothesis was that in the absence of surgical bleeding, CPB-induced hypofibrinogenemia would resolve spontaneously and predictably within a few hours. In a prospective, observational study of 26 patients undergoing conventional CPB (cCPB) or minimally invasive extracorporeal circulation (MiECC), Clauss fibrinogen level (C-FIB) was determined at 10 closely spaced time points after protamine administration. Primary endpoint was the time to recovery of post-CPB fibrinogen levels to ≥1.5 g/L. C-FIB reached its nadir after protamine administration corresponding to 62 ± 5% (mean ± SD) of the baseline level after cCPB and 68 ± 7% after MiECC (p = 0.027 vs. cCPB). C-FIB recovered spontaneously at a nearly constant rate of approximately 0.08 g/L per hour. In all patients, C-FIB was ≥1.5 g/L at 4 hours and ≥2.0 g/L at 13 hours after CPB weaning. Following cardiac surgery with CPB and in the absence of surgical bleeding, spontaneous recovery of normal endogenous fibrinogen levels can be expected at a rate of 0.08 g/L per hour. Administration of fibrinogen concentrate triggered solely by a single-point measurement of low plasma fibrinogen some time after CPB is not justified."
https://openalex.org/W2885363241,"Uremic vascular calcification is a regulated cell-mediated process wherein cells in the arterial wall transdifferentiate to actively calcifying cells resulting in a process resembling bone formation. Wnt signalling is established as a major driver for vessel formation and maturation and for embryonic bone formation, and disturbed Wnt signalling might play a role in vascular calcification. ICG-001 is a small molecule Wnt inhibitor that specifically targets the coactivator CREB binding protein (CBP)/β-catenin-mediated signalling. In the present investigation we examined the effect of ICG-001 on vascular calcification in uremic rats. Uremic vascular calcification was induced in adult male rats by 5/6-nephrectomy, high phosphate diet and alfacalcidol. The presence of uremic vascular calcification in the aorta was associated with induction of gene expression of the Wnt target gene and marker of proliferation, cyclinD1; the mediator of canonical Wnt signalling, β-catenin and the matricellular proteins, fibronectin and periostin. Furthermore, genes from fibrosis-related pathways, TGF-β and activin A, as well as factors related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition, snail1 and vimentin were induced. ICG-001 treatment had significant effects on gene expression in kidney and aorta from healthy rats. These effects were however limited in uremic rats, and treatment with ICG-001 did not reduce the Ca-content of the uremic vasculature."
https://openalex.org/W2886743003,"Inhibitors targeting bacterial enzymes should not interfere with enzymes of the host, and knowledge about structural determinants for selectivity is important for designing inhibitors with a therapeutic potential. We have determined the binding strengths of two hydroxamate compounds, galardin and compound 1b for the bacterial zinc metalloproteases, thermolysin, pseudolysin and auerolysin, known to be bacterial virulence factors, and the two human zinc metalloproteases MMP-9 and MMP-14. The active sites of the bacterial and human enzymes have huge similarities. In addition, we also studied the enzyme-inhibitor interactions by molecular modelling. The obtained Ki values of galardin for MMP-9 and MMP-14 and compound 1b for MMP-9 are approximately ten times lower than previously reported. Compound 1b binds stronger than galardin to both MMP-9 and MMP-14, and docking studies indicated that the diphenyl ether moiety of compound 1b obtains more favourable interactions within the S´1-subpocket than the 4-methylpentanoyl moiety of galardin. Both compounds bind stronger to MMP-9 than to MMP-14, which appears to be due to a larger S´1-subpocket in the former enzyme. Galardin, but not 1b, inhibits the bacterial enzymes, but the galardin Ki values were much larger than for the MMPs. The docking indicates that the S´1-subpockets of the bacterial proteases are too small to accommodate the diphenyl ether moiety of 1b, while the 4-methylpentanoyl moiety of galardin enters the pocket. The present study indicates that the size and shape of the ligand structural moiety entering the S´1-subpocket is an important determinant for selectivity between the studied MMPs and bacterial MPs."

The objectives of this study were to estimate direct, indirect and total effectiveness of HPV vaccine and to identify sexual habits changes in the post-vaccination period in Galicia, Spain.Endocervical scrapings of 745 women attending 7 Health Areas of the Galician Public Health Service were collected in the post-vaccination period, from 2014-2017. Two groups were studied: women born between 1989 and 1993 (n = 397) and women born in 1994 or later (n = 348). Twelve high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) genotypes were detected by Cobas® 4800 HPV test (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). The Linear Array® HPV Genotyping Test (Roche Diagnostics) was used for HR-HPV genotype detection other than HPV 16/18. Information about sexual habits was collected by a self-filled questionnaire. Post-vaccination data were compared to previously published pre-vaccination data obtained between 2008 and 2010 in Galicia from women of the same age (18-26 years old, n = 523). The Stata 14.2 software was employed for statistical analyses.Data from 392 unvaccinated and 353 vaccinated women were compared. For unvaccinated and vaccinated women, HPV 16/18 prevalence was 9.2% and 0.8%, respectively, and HPV 31/33/45 prevalence was 8.4% and 1.1%, respectively. Direct, indirect and total effectiveness of the HPV vaccine were (%, 95% CI): 94 (72-99), 30 (-11-56) and 95 (79-99), respectively, for HPV 16/18 and 83 (46-94), -10 (-88-33) and 84 (54-94), respectively, for HPV 31/33/45. The number of women with first intercourse before 17 years old and 3 or more sexual partners along life was higher in the post-vaccination period (p < 0.05). A positive impact of bivalent HPV vaccine was observed, both on direct and cross protection. Sexual habits could have changed in the post-vaccination period."
https://openalex.org/W2886674498,"Background Being aware of consumption patterns of antimicrobials is the first step in designing and implementing strategies to change behaviors and, thus, to reduce the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance. The present survey was carried out to identify and describe the use of antimicrobials without prescription in riverside dwellers of the Brazilian Amazon Basin. Methods A cross-sectional study was carried out from a conglomerate stratified sample in the rural municipality of Coari, Amazonas State, Brazil, between April and July 2016. The survey was conducted in the riverside dwellers’ homes, and information was collected on all antimicrobials taken with and without medical or dental prescription for a 30-day period, together with indications of their use before the interview. Results A total of 492 riverside dwellers were included in the present survey; 346 (70.3%) had taken at least one medication during the previous month, and 74 (21.3% of those taking a medicine) used an antimicrobial. Two-thirds of the patients treated with an antimicrobial (49; 66.2%) obtained it without a prescription. Additionally, one-third of the antimicrobials consumed by the study sample (25) were used for non-infectious or non-bacterial conditions. Discussion The present survey showed not only that inappropriate use of antimicrobials is present in remote places such as the Amazon Basin, but also that one-third of those antimicrobials were taken to treat non-infectious or non-bacterial conditions. In addition to an unnecessary risk of adverse effects to the exposed populations, the inappropriate use of antibiotics without prescription helps to increase antibiotic-resistant strains. In the present case, this was happening near one of Latin America’s most important water supplies, which could contribute to the global impact of antimicrobial resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2885526417,"This paper describes the web-based automated disease-related topic extraction system, called to DiTeX, which monitors important disease-related topics and provides associated information. National disease surveillance systems require a considerable amount of time to inform people of recent outbreaks of diseases. To solve this problem, many studies have used Internet-based sources such as news and Social Network Service (SNS). However, these sources contain many intentional elements that disturb extracting important topics. To address this challenge, we employ Natural Language Processing and an effective ranking algorithm, and develop DiTeX that provides important disease-related topics. This report describes the web front-end and back-end architecture, implementation, performance of the ranking algorithm, and captured topics of DiTeX. We describe processes for collecting Internet-based data and extracting disease-related topics based on search keywords. Our system then applies a ranking algorithm to evaluate the importance of disease-related topics extracted from these data. Finally, we conduct analysis based on real-world incidents to evaluate the performance and the effectiveness of DiTeX. To evaluate DiTeX, we analyze the ranking of well-known disease-related incidents for various ranking algorithms. The topic extraction rate of our ranking algorithm is superior to those of others. We demonstrate the validity of DiTeX by summarizing the disease-related topics of each day extracted by our system. To our knowledge, DiTeX is the world’s first automated web-based real-time service system that extracts and presents disease-related topics, trends and related data through web-based sources. DiTeX is now available on the web through http://epidemic.co.kr/media/topics."
https://openalex.org/W2885935468,"A comprehensive understanding of wheat responses to environmental stress will contribute to the long-term goal of feeding the planet. ALERNATIVE OXIDASE (AOX) genes encode proteins involved in a bypass of the electron transport chain and are also known to be involved in stress tolerance in multiple species. Here, we report the identification and characterization of the AOX gene family in diploid and hexaploid wheat. Four genes each were found in the diploid ancestors Triticum urartu, and Aegilops tauschii, and three in Aegilops speltoides. In hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum), 20 genes were identified, some with multiple splice variants, corresponding to a total of 24 proteins for those with observed transcription and translation. These proteins were classified as AOX1a, AOX1c, AOX1e or AOX1d via phylogenetic analysis. Proteins lacking most or all signature AOX motifs were assigned to putative regulatory roles. Analysis of protein-targeting sequences suggests mixed localization to the mitochondria and other organelles. In comparison to the most studied AOX from Trypanosoma brucei, there were amino acid substitutions at critical functional domains indicating possible role divergence in wheat or grasses in general. In hexaploid wheat, AOX genes were expressed at specific developmental stages as well as in response to both biotic and abiotic stresses such as fungal pathogens, heat and drought. These AOX expression patterns suggest a highly regulated and diverse transcription and expression system. The insights gained provide a framework for the continued and expanded study of AOX genes in wheat for stress tolerance through breeding new varieties, as well as resistance to AOX-targeted herbicides, all of which can ultimately be used synergistically to improve crop yield."
https://openalex.org/W2887343370,"CHF5633 (Chiesi Farmaceutici, Italy) is a synthetic surfactant developed for respiratory distress syndrome replacement therapy in pre-term newborn infants. CHF5633 contains two phospholipids (dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine and 1-palmitoyl-2oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol sodium salt), and peptide analogues of surfactant protein C (SP-C analogue) and surfactant protein B (SP-B analogue). Both proteins are fundamental for an optimal surfactant activity in vivo and SP-B genetic deficiency causes lethal respiratory failure after birth. Fluorescence emission of the only tryptophan residue present in SP-B analogue (SP-C analogue has none) could in principle be exploited to probe SP-B analogue conformation, localization and interaction with other components of the pharmaceutical formulation. However, the high light scattering activity of the multi-lamellar vesicles suspension characterizing the pharmaceutical surfactant formulation represents a challenge for such studies. We show here that quenching of tryptophan fluorescence and Singular Value Decomposition analysis can be used to accurately calculate and subtract background scattering. The results indicate, with respect to Trp microenvironment, a conformationally homogeneous population of SP-B. Trp is highly accessible to the water phase, suggesting a surficial localization on the membrane of phospholipid vesicles, similarly to what observed for full length SP-B in natural lung surfactant, and supporting an analogous role in protein anchoring to the lipid phase."

In total, 88.0% of children lived within 30 minutes of these hospitals and 95.2% of children lived within 60 minutes. The percentage of children with such access was higher in regions with high population density (e.g., Kanto and Kinki) compared with regions with low population density (e.g., Hokkaido, Tohoku, and Shikoku). Furthermore, regions with high population density also had high rates of children that lived within reach of hospitals with at least five full-time pediatricians."

https://openalex.org/W2885832078,"Introduction Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis. Medical and surgical treatments have yet to substantially diminish the global health and economic burden of OA. Due to recent advances in clinical imaging, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a correlation has been established between structural joint damage and OA-related pain and disability. Existing preclinical animal models of OA are useful tools but each suffers specific roadblocks when translating structural MRI data to humans. Intraarticular injection of mono-iodoacetate (MIA) is a reliable, well-studied method to induce OA in small animals but joint size discrepancy precludes the use of clinical grade MRI to study structural disease. The porcine knee is suited for clinical MRI and demonstrates homology with humans. We set out to establish the first large animal model of MIA-induced knee OA in swine characterized by structural MRI. Materials and methods Yucatan swine (n = 27) underwent ultrasound-guided injection of knees with 1.2, 4, 12, or 40 mg MIA. MRI was performed at several time points over 12 weeks (n = 54 knees) and images were assessed according to a modified clinical grading scheme. Knees were harvested and graded up to 35 weeks after injection. Results MIA-injected knees (n = 25) but not control knees (n = 29) developed gross degeneration. A total of n = 6,000 MRI measurements were recorded by two radiologists. MRI revealed progressive cartilage damage, bone marrow edema, erosions, and effusions in MIA-injected knees. Lesion severity and progression was influenced by time, dose, and inter-individual variability. Conclusions Intraarticular injection of MIA produced structural knee degradation that was reliably characterized using clinical MRI in swine. Destruction was progressive and, similar to human OA, lesion severity was heterogeneous between and within treatment groups."
https://openalex.org/W2887281646,"The connection between metabolism and reproductive function is well recognized, and we hypothesized that the pituitary gonadotropes, which produce luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), mediate some of the effects directly via insulin-independent glucose transporters, which allow continued glucose metabolism during hyperglycemia. We found that glucose transporter 1 is the predominant glucose transporter in primary gonadotropes and a gonadotrope precursor-derived cell line, and both are responsive to culture in high glucose; moreover, metabolite levels were altered in the cell line. Several of the affected metabolites are cofactors for chromatin-modifying enzymes, and in the gonadotrope precursor-derived cell line, we recorded global changes in histone acetylation and methylation, decreased DNA methylation, and increased hydroxymethylation, some of which did not revert to basal levels after cells were returned to normal glucose. Despite this weakening of epigenetic-mediated repression seen in the model cell line, FSH β-subunit ( Fshb) mRNA levels in primary gonadotropes were significantly reduced, apparently due in part to increased autocrine/paracrine effects of inhibin. However, unlike thioredoxin interacting protein and inhibin subunit α, Fshb mRNA levels did not recover after the return of cells to normal glucose. The effect on Fshb expression was also seen in 2 hyperglycemic mouse models, and levels of circulating FSH, required for follicle growth and development, were reduced. Thus, hyperglycemia seems to target the pituitary gonadotropes directly, and the likely extensive epigenetic changes are sensed acutely by Fshb. This scenario would explain clinical findings in which, even after restoration of optimal blood glucose levels, fertility often remains adversely affected. However, the relative accessibility of the pituitary provides a possible target for treatment, particularly crucial in the young in which hyperglycemia is increasingly common and fertility most relevant.-Feldman, A., Saleh, A., Pnueli, L., Qiao, S., Shlomi, T., Boehm, U., Melamed, P. Sensitivity of pituitary gonadotropes to hyperglycemia leads to epigenetic aberrations and reduced follicle-stimulating hormone levels."
https://openalex.org/W2887326357,"The present research examined people's responses towards others' exclusion experience. The authors predicted that both causal attributions and empathy would mediate whether people affiliate with a victim of an ambiguous exclusion experience. Perceivers observing another's exclusion (relative to inclusion) without clearly announced reasons chose to affiliate with the target and this was mediated by increased external attributions for the exclusion (Studies 1a, 1b, 2). When the attributions people made for the exclusion of a target was experimentally manipulated, internal attributions decreased desire for affiliation relative to external or ambiguous attributions, and this was mediated by differences in empathy for the target (Study 3). Further, external attributions arisen from perceiving a causally unclear exclusion leads to an empathetic response which results in an increased desire to affiliate with the target (Study 4). Future directions on perceptions of those who have been excluded are discussed."

A sample of these eligible patients were selected to participate in two phone-based surveys and to self-collect a stool sample for laboratory testing. To ascertain household transmission patterns, information on household members with acute gastroenteritis was gathered from participants, and symptomatic household members were contacted to participate in a survey and provide stool sample as well.54% of individuals who met enrollment criteria agreed to participate, and 76% of those individuals returned a stool sample. Among household members, 85% of eligible individuals agreed to participate, and 68% of those returned a stool sample. Participant demographics were similar to those of the eligible population, although minority racial/ethnic groups were somewhat underrepresented in the final sample.This study demonstrates the feasibility of conducting acute infectious disease research within an integrated health care delivery system.

https://openalex.org/W2887603876,"NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDAR) are ligand-gated ion channels that contribute to excitatory neurotransmission in the central nervous system. NMDAR dysfunction has been found to be involved in various neurological disorders. Recent crystallographic and EM studies have shown the static structure of different states of the non-human NMDARs. Here we describe a model of a human NMDA receptor (hNMDAR) and its molecular dynamics (MD) before and after the binding of agonist ligands, glutamate and glycine. It is shown that the binding of ligands promotes a global reduction in molecular flexibility that produces a more tightly packed conformation than the unbound hNMDAR, and a higher cooperative regularity of moving. The ligand-induced synchronization of motion, identified on all structural levels of the modular hNMDA receptor is apparently a fundamental factor in channel gating. Although the time scale of the MD simulations (300 ns) was not sufficient to observe the complete gating event, the obtained data has shown the ligand-induced stabilization of hNMDAR that conforms the ""going to be open state"". We propose a mechanistic dynamic model of the ligand-dependent gating mechanism in the hNMDA receptor. At the binding of the ligands, the differently twisted conformations of the highly flexible receptor are stabilized in unique conformation with a linear molecular axis, which is a condition that is optimal for pore development. By searching the receptor surface, we have identified three new pockets, which are different from the pockets described in the literature as the potential and known positive allosteric modulator binding sites. A successful docking of two NMDAR modulators to their binding sites validates the model of a human NMDA receptor as a biological relevant target."
https://openalex.org/W2885531299,"In this work, we examine the problem of efficiently preprocessing and denoising high volume environmental acoustic data, which is a necessary step in many bird monitoring tasks. Preprocessing is typically made up of multiple steps which are considered separately from each other. These are often resource intensive, particularly because the volume of data involved is high. We focus on addressing two challenges within this problem: how to combine existing preprocessing tasks while maximising the effectiveness of each step, and how to process this pipeline quickly and efficiently, so that it can be used to process high volumes of acoustic data. We describe a distributed system designed specifically for this problem, utilising a master-slave model with data parallelisation. By investigating the impact of individual preprocessing tasks on each other, and their execution times, we determine an efficient and accurate order for preprocessing tasks within the distributed system. We find that, using a single core, our pipeline executes 1.40 times faster compared to manually executing all preprocessing tasks. We then apply our pipeline in the distributed system and evaluate its performance. We find that our system is capable of preprocessing bird acoustic recordings at a rate of 174.8 seconds of audio per second of real time with 32 cores over 8 virtual machines, which is 21.76 times faster than a serial process."

With this tendency, location based service (LBS) has become one of the prosperous types of service along with the wireless and positioning technology development. However, as the LBS server needs precise location information about the user to provide service result, the procedure of LBS may reveal location privacy, especially when a user is utilizing continuous query along the road. In continuous query, attributes of the user are released inadvertently with per-query, and the information can be collected by an adversary as background knowledge to correlate the location trajectory and infer the personal privacy. Although, a user can employ a central server (CS) to provide privacy preservation for his location, the trustfulness of CS still is without testified and it is usually considered as an un-trusted entity. Thus, in this paper, the trustfulness of CS is verified by a game tree, and then with the result we propose a hash based attribute anonymous scheme (short for HBAA) to obfuscate the attributes released in each query along the road. With the help of HBAA, the CS has no opportunity to get any information about the user who sends his query for generalization service. Furthermore, as the set of attributes is transmitted into a fixed length of hash value, the processing time that spent in attribute generalization is stripped down and the performance of executive efficiency is improved. At last, security analysis and simulation experiment are proposed, and then results of security proving as well as simulation experiments further reflect the superiority of our proposed scheme."

We solve the multi-dimensional equation using a splitting method and obtained the stationary probability densities and the mean-square responses directly. Two classical nonlinear vibration systems with adjustable stiffness, including the energy harvesting system and the Duffing system with Dahl friction, are presented as examples. Their comparisons with the results from Monte-Carlo simulations illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed procedure for both monostable and bistable cases, even for cases with strong excitation. In addition, the splitting method is efficient for higher-dimensional problem and has advantages of simple implementation, less storage of intermediate values and so on. Hence, in terms of the application scope, the proposed procedure is superior to the current mainstream methods for the random response evaluation of nonlinear vibration systems with adjustable stiffness."

The severity of biological effects following irradiation depends on the stage at which embryos are irradiated during embryogenesis. We reported previously that irradiation of medaka embryos 3 days post fertilization (dpf) with 10 Gy of gamma rays induced high incidence of apoptotic cells in the mid-brain, however, the embryos hatched normally and developed without apparent malformations. To determine the severity of biological effects following irradiation during a later period of embryogenesis, embryos of various developmental stages were irradiated with 15 Gy of gamma rays and examined for apoptotic induction at 24 h after irradiation in the brain, eyes and pharyngeal epithelium tissues, which are actively proliferating and sensitive to irradiation. Embryos irradiated at 3 dpf exhibited many apoptotic cells in these tissues, and all of them died due to severe malformations. In contrast, embryos irradiated at 5 dpf showed no apoptotic cells and subsequently hatched without apparent malformations. Embryos irradiated at 4 dpf had relatively low numbers of apoptotic cells compared to those irradiated at 3 dpf, thereafter most of them died within 1 week of hatching. In adult medaka, apoptotic cells were not found in these tissues following irradiation, suggesting that apoptosis occurs during a restricted time period of medaka embryogenesis throughout the life. No apoptotic cells were found in irradiated intestinal tissue, which is known to be susceptible to radiation damage in mammals, whereas many apoptotic cells were found in proliferating spermatogonial cells in the mature testis following irradiation. Taken together, with the exception of testicular tissue, the results suggest a limited period during medaka embryogenesis in which irradiation-induced apoptosis can occur."

That's me, of course!” He was clearly smart and ambitious. But I wasn't sure I was qualified to take someone under my wing. I had only started in research 2 years earlier, after finishing my medical degree. The bigger hurdle was the pressure to “publish or perish,” which made me hesitant to take on extra responsibilities. But, as I reflected on my own path into research and the crucial role played by my mentor, I realized that I needed to pay it forward.

> “[My mentor's] character inspired me, and hopefully I will inspire my mentees.” 

I had always been interested in research. But for various reasons, I initially pursued medicine—until my medical school's final requirement that I complete a brief clinical training period elsewhere led to a serendipitous meeting. I was waiting outside my clinical supervisor's office when the prominent professor who worked in the next office came by. I knew who he was, and I was impressed with his lab's work developing breast cancer drugs, but I didn't expect him to recognize me. I was startled when he said, “I see you in every meeting. What are you working on?”

I told him about myself and my work, and our conversation continued for more than an hour. His respectful, down-to-earth demeanor immediately made me feel at ease. He seemed to really care about what I had to say. When he learned that I was interested in research, he gave me a stack of papers to read and told me that he might have a spot for me in his lab. I didn't understand why this famous scientist would make space for me, someone with no research experience. But he saw something in me. After a proper interview, and finishing my medical degree, I joined the lab.

In the beginning, I had no idea what I was doing. But my mentor was understanding and patient. With his support, I got my footing and was starting to feel like a real scientist. Now, it was time for me to do this for someone else.

When I started as a mentor, I struggled a bit. I worried about accidentally teaching my mentee something inaccurate. Adjusting my teaching style to suit his learning curve was challenging at times. But we were patient with each other and worked together to develop a productive relationship. Following my own mentor's approach, I treated every encounter as a meeting of equals and encouraged open communication. My mentee asked tough questions. He challenged me and proved me wrong at times. And I loved it. By the end of his summer in the lab, I had a newfound appreciation for the rewards of being a mentor. Mentorship sharpened my communication, teaching, and technical skills, and it gave me a sense of purpose, confidence, and fulfillment.

Since that undergrad left our lab, I have continued serving as a mentor for other students. Each relationship is enriching in its own way. Recently, for example, I learned how to support a mentee through failure. My current mentee and I had worked tirelessly to prepare for her university's undergraduate research competition, but she didn't win and was quite disappointed. I didn't want this one setback to extinguish her fire for research, so it was up to me to provide a positive, encouraging perspective. I took her out for dinner to celebrate her will to compete and the experience she had gained. And I told her about a recent disappointment of my own—losing a science communication competition—to show her that she was not alone.

I was recently accepted into a split-site Ph.D. program at another institution, through which I will earn my research doctorate while continuing my current projects in my mentor's lab. This opportunity was only possible because my mentor took a chance on me. His character inspired me, and hopefully I will inspire my mentees similarly. There are many amazing individuals waiting for someone to apply just enough pressure to turn them from rock to diamond. We must all try to be those “someones.”

https://openalex.org/W2887479805,"The monk parakeet (Myiopsitta monachus) is a South American species unique among parrots; it builds communal stick nests that allow independence from tree or cliff cavities required by most parrots. As a very successful invasive species, it has expanded into several countries around the world. Questions remain around the factors that allowed this species to be such a successful invader in its native range as in other countries, and particularly the extent that evolutionary processes may be involved in adapting to new areas. Along with this line of analysis, we focused on assessing whether morphological characteristics are sufficiently heritable, and therefore responsive to selection. As the first step in this direction, we have estimated heritability of monk parakeet in six external morphological traits considered of potential adaptability value. Samples were obtained in the province of Córdoba in central Argentina. Data from seven microsatellites were used to determine the familial relationships among individuals. Heritabilities and genetic correlations were estimated by means of animal models. We found evidence for significant heritability in the six traits measured, particularly in weight, tarsus length and bill width. We also found evidence of maternal effects on morphological traits, particularly in the traits with lower heritability: wing length, bill length and tail length. Genetic correlations between traits were significant and associated with phenotypic correlations, suggesting that these traits are constrained in terms of evolutionary potential, whereas the amount of additive genetic variance in weight, tarsus length and bill width indicate that these traits could be responsive to selection."
https://openalex.org/W2885053538,"Which conformational parameters lead to an antibody-affine peptide antigen? And in how many different conformations can we actually present the respective conformational epitope? To provide answers from a chemical point of view, we direct the bending and tethering of peptide backbones by the utilisation of a hydrophobic cluster, disulfides, and d-amino acids. Each mutation is employed pairwise on directly opposite sides of a β-hairpin. In combination, these synthetic modules guide the formation of complementary β-sheet-like structures, whereby the oppositely configured (l/d-)bi-disulfide pairs form with high regioselectivity. The conformational properties of the peptides are assessed by NMR spectroscopy and correlated with their antibody affinity in ELISA. From a pool of thus designed peptide antigens with distinctive complementary affinities against known rheumatoid arthritis (RA) autoantibodies, we select a set of epitopes for an immunoassay with sera of RA patients. We want to put emphasis on the idea, that the different conformational properties of the chosen antigens, containing the same epitope sequence, are mirrored in the distribution of autoantibody subtypes (or of the antibody polyclonality, respectively). Such directly comparable information can only be delivered by a set of peptides, rather than a single one. The hairpin-restriction technology of l/d-configured bi-disulfide amino acid pairs is not limited to RA but applicable to other shape-persistent hairpin motifs which are supposed to identify subgroups of protein receptors."

With the proposed approach a good pressure profile tracking and repeatability are achieved. Moreover, the proposed automation includes the implementation of powerful treatment tools such as Pause and Alleviation procedures. The control system implemented is based on a special zero-pole cancellation regulator. Experimental results are provided to illustrate the behavior of the automated chamber. It is important to remark that the chamber automated in this work is being successfully used in a real hospital since 2015 treating more than 40 patients per day, five days a week."
