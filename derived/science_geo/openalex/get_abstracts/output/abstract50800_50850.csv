https://openalex.org/W2006428216,Duodenal mucosa obtained from two patients with Menkes' syndrome contained abnormally large amounts of copper. The defect in copper absorption in this disease must lie in the process of intracellular handling or of transport across the serosal cell membrane. Fibroblastic cells cultured from the skin of patients and of heterozygous females show intense metachromasia in primary culture which disappears in subculture. These cells may be useful for the study of copper transport in vitro and for the identification of heterozygotes in affected families.
https://openalex.org/W2042396291,"The chromosomes of two human males were identified by fluorescent banding, restained, and measured by scanning microscopy and computer analysis. The two variables, DNA content and DNA-based centromeric index, provided almost complete discrimination of chromosome types. Some chromosomes showed significant differences in DNA content between the men, and for one man two pairs of chromosomes showed significant differences between homologs."
https://openalex.org/W1572544720,"We report the chemical synthesis and some useful applications of N-(3-pyrene)maleimide which forms fluorescent adducts with organic compounds and proteins which contain sulfhydryl groups. Lifetime of the first excited singlet state of the small molecule adducts ranged from 1.4 to 6.5 ns. Fluorescence of the protein adducts exhibited two distinct lifetimes for each adduct. The longer component had a value of about 100 ns. Because of the long lifetime, N-(3-pyrene)maleimide is useful for fluorescence polarization studies of high molecular weight proteins and other macro-molecules having reactive sulfhydryl groups."
https://openalex.org/W2049041863,"The intrapulmonary lining epithelium of rabbits contains newly identified corpuscles composed of argyrophil, argentaffin, yellow fluorescent, ultrastructurally granulated and innervated epithelial cellular organs. These are proved, by electron microscopic cytochemistry and microspectrography, to be a source for intrapulmonary production of serotonin. Probably they are intrapulmonary neuroreceptor organs modulated by the central nervous system which exhibit local secretory activities."
https://openalex.org/W1555710117,"A physiologically inactive prothrombin protein has been purified from the plasma of dicumarol-treated cows to a high level of purity. This protein gave 80% as much precipitation in an assay against bovine prothrombin antibody as did normal bovine prothrombin. This could be due to a difference in antigenicity, or it could be a reflection of nonhomogeneity of the preparation. It was very similar to normal prothrombin in its carbohydrate and amino acid composition, its ability to be activated by several nonphysiological prothrombin activators, and its molecular weight as judged by gel electrophoresis. Its disc gel electrophoretic pattern also showed little difference from that of normal prothrombin unless calcium was included in the gel buffers. Under these conditions it was apparent that the inactive prothrombin did not bind calcium to the same degree as the normal prothrombin. The other significant differences between these two proteins are their physiological activity and their adsorption onto barium citrate precipitates. In every case the abnormal prothrombin failed to have these properties. It appears that these three differences are due to the same property of prothrombin and that this is a result of vitamin K action. That is, vitamin K action is required in the metabolic step which is needed to produce the calcium-binding sites, and these are necessary for physiological activity and are responsible for barium citrate adsorption. These data suggest that vitamin K acts by chemically altering prothrombin in some unknown fashion, or in the attachment of a previously unrecognized prosthetic group."
https://openalex.org/W2066016513,"Lewis rats were used to determine the encephalitogenic activity of myelin basic protein of different species and of 45-residue fragments of basic protein. Basic protein from guinea pigs was more active than that from rats, and the fragments from the two species showed the same order of activity. Bovine basic protein was the least active of the intact proteins, and the respective fragment was inactive. Studies of serum-binding capacity did not support the hypothesis that blocking antibody played a role in this biological variation, whereas consideration of the amino acid sequences of the three fragments suggested that differences in primary structure, operating either at the sensitization or the effector phase of the immune response, could account for the variation."
https://openalex.org/W1550361244,"Abstract Guinea pig myelin basic protein has been chromatographed on carboxymethylcellulose at alkaline pH to yield five purified components, each of which was shown to be identical with one of the several components which have previously been observed electrophoretically at alkaline pH. Each purified chromatographic component was stable upon electrophoresis at alkaline pH. No differences in molecular size were detected among the chromatographic components when examined by gel filtration under conditions approximating those of alkaline pH electrophoresis or chromatography. In contrast to their markedly different electrophoretic mobilities at alkaline pH, each component when subjected to electrophoresis at acid pH displayed essentially the same mobility. No significant differences among the different chromatographic forms were detected with regard to encephalitogenic activity or amino acid composition. Analyses for methylarginine showed that each chromatographic form contained approximately the same amount per mole of protein of Ng-monomethyl- and Ng,N'g-dimethylarginine. No other methylated basic amino acids, including Ng,Ng-dimethylarginine, were present."
https://openalex.org/W2094810102,"HUMAN tissues contain two isozymes of β-D-N-acetyl-hexos-aminidase1. Hexosaminidase-A (hex-A) is thermolabile and moves toward the anode on electrophoresis at pH 6.0, and hexosaminidase-B (hex-B) is relatively thermostable and moves toward the cathode. In Tay-Sachs' disease, which is found predominantly in Jewish populations, hex-A is absent but hex-B activity is increased2–5. In Sandhoff's disease, a variant of Tay-Sachs' disease, found mostly in non-Jewish populations, both enzyme activities are missing3,6. Thus, while it is apparent that there is a genetic relationship between hex-A and hex-B, the nature of this relationship has remained obscure. It has been suggested that hex-A may be derived from hex-B by the addition of neuraminic acid residues1,7."
https://openalex.org/W1575019562,"Abstract The interaction between human Clq and immunoglobulins was measured quantitatively by determining the ability of IgG, IgM, and (Fc)5µ to inhibit the binding of 125I-labeled Clq to IgM covalently linked to cyanogen bromide activated Sepharose. The following inhibition constants were determined: Ki for IgM = 6.42 x 10-6 m; Ki for (Fc)5µ = 4.35 x 10-6 m; and Ki for IgG = 1.10 x 10-4 m. The heat aggregation of IgM and IgG increased the ability of these proteins to bind 125I-labeled Clq, but had no significant effect on the binding properties of (Fc)5µ. The binding between the 125I-labeled Clq and the IgM-Sepharose complex was inhibitable with aromatic and alkyl diamino compounds. The most potent inhibitor was 2,5-diaminotoluene."

This is not a general cytotoxicity, since apparently only the neurons were killed. Serums from other degenerative neurological diseases were inactive."
https://openalex.org/W1547304222,Ovalbumin-synthesizing polysomes were isolated from total oviduct polysomes by reaction with anti-ovalbumin antibody and adsorption to a matrix of glutaraldehyde-linked ovalbumin. The RNA from immunoadsorbed ovalbumin polysomes was then deproteinized and selectively adsorbed to Millipore filters. Several types of experiments indicated the resulting RNA fraction is highly enriched for ovalbumin mRNA.
https://openalex.org/W1947232287,"Abstract Highly purified dicoumarol-induced bovine prothrombin, which does not bind calcium ions and has no prothrombin activity, has been structurally compared with normal prothrombin. Quantitative amino acid and carbohydrate analysis gave identical results for both prothrombins, as did analysis of the NH2-terminal and the COOH-terminal amino acids and molecular weight determination with the sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoretic technique. Peptide maps of tryptic peptides prepared from the reduced and aminoethylated normal and dicoumarol-induced prothrombin were identical. These results suggest that the difference in properties between the two prothrombins are caused by a minor structural difference or a conformational difference. Ouchterlony immunodiffusion analysis gave a reaction of complete immunological identity between the two prothrombins, whereas the quantitative immunoprecipitation technique indicated antigenic difference between them. Furthermore, it was found that normal prothrombin has calcium ion-dependent antigenic determinants. The sedimentation coefficient, Stokes molecular radius, the titration curves for the tyrosine phenolic groups, and the fluorescence emission spectra were identical, which corroborates that the difference between the normal and the dicoumarol-induced prothrombin does not engage the entire molecule. The results obtained by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 8 m urea may suggest that the difference includes an anomalous pairing of half-cystine residues."
https://openalex.org/W1517861362,"Abstract A procedure is described for the direct determination of methyl derivatives of basic amino acids in total acid hydrolyzates of proteins by the use of a Beckman amino acid analyzer operated in the high sensitivity mode with automatic integration. The conditions described permit the separation of ornithine, lysine, 5-hydroxylysine, Ne-monomethyllysine, Ne-dimethyllysine, histidine, Nτ-methylhistidine, ammonia, methylamine, Ng,Ng-dimethylarginine, Ng,N'g-dimethylarginine, Ng-monomethylarginine, and arginine. The procedure was used to survey purified myelin basic proteins prepared from a wide variety of species for their contents of methylated basic amino acids. Of the latter only Ng,N'g-dimethylarginine and Ng-monomethylarginine were present. The proportions of the two methylarginines, as well as the fraction of the total arginine which they comprise varied widely depending upon the species source. No Ng-monomethylarginine was detected in the hydrolyzate of the frog myelin basic protein; no methylarginines were found in that of the carp. Hydrolyzates of fractions of contaminating proteins which had been removed from the turtle myelin basic protein during its purification were found to contain appreciable quantities of Ng,Ng-dimethylarginine."

https://openalex.org/W1535489510,"Abstract Extracts of Streptomyces griseus ATCC 10971, which does not secrete streptomycin, contain a labile kinase which phosphorylates the N-methyl-l-glucosamine moieties of streptomycin, dihydrostreptomycin, and 3'-deoxydihydrostreptomycin, with adenosine 5'-triphosphate as the phosphate donor. Periodate degradation studies indicate that phosphate is esterified with the 3''-hydroxyl group. Diphosphorylated derivatives with phosphate also esterified at position 6 of the streptidine moiety can be synthesized by utilizing streptomycin streptidinokinase. Streptomycin 6-phosphate phosphatase, acting on these diphosphates, removes phosphate rapidly from position 6 and more slowly from position 3'' both phosphates are esterified with secondary hydroxyl groups adjacent to basic nitrogenous moieties. Extracts of S. bikiniensis ATCC 11062, and other streptomycin-secreting strains, contain a different labile kinase, which cannot phosphorylate streptomycin derivatives containing a 3'-α-aldehyde group. This kinase phosphorylates the dihydrostreptobiosamine moieties of dihydrostreptomycin 6-phosphate and 3'-deoxydihydrostreptomycin 6-phosphate, with adenosine 5'-triphosphate as the phosphate donor. Lability of the kinase precludes separation from the stable streptidinokinase present in these extracts, so diphosphorylated derivatives are formed. Streptomycin 6-phosphate phosphatase removes phosphate only from position 6 of these diphosphorylated derivatives. Substrate specificity studies thus suggest that the 3'-α-hydroxymethyl group is the site of phosphorylation by the labile S. bikiniensis kinase. Triphosphorylated derivatives of dihydrostreptomycin could not be prepared enzymatically. Diphosphorylated derivatives could be prepared only if one phosphate were at position 6 of the streptidine moiety. Methods of synthesizing and distinguishing various phosphorylated derivatives of streptomycin, dihydrostreptomycin, and 3'-deoxydihydrostreptomycin are described."
https://openalex.org/W2038384214,Multiple genetic loci for induction of murine leukemia viruses are demonstrated in cells of the high leukemic incidence C58 mouse strain. The biologic properties of viruses at C58 inducibility loci are clearly distinguishable from those of viruses activated from mouse cells containing a locus for virus induction of the low leukemia incidence BALB/c strain. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the genes for virus induction in normal mouse embryo cells represent viral structural information.
https://openalex.org/W1596595800,"Abstract The polypeptide chain location of active site serine and carbohydrate in the multiple forms of thrombin present in Parke-Davis thrombin have been investigated by means of [3H]diisopropylfluorophosphate incorporation and carbohydrate staining techniques. Both the sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoretic technique and gel filtration in 6 m guanidinium chloride have been applied to the resolution of individual thrombin forms and their component chains. The results of these studies indicate that the active site serine is contained in the 33,000-dalton chain of the large (39,000 dalton) thrombin, and in the 18,000- and 14,000-dalton chains of the smaller (28,000 dalton) thrombins. Carbohydrate analysis of the resolved thrombin components indicate that, although the large thrombin contains covalently attached carbohydrate, the smaller enzymes do not."
https://openalex.org/W1569529418,"A complete molecular structure for an antigenic glycan isolated from the cell wall of Streptococcus faecalis is being proposed on the basis of analytical data obtained from methylation, acetolysis, and periodate oxidation experiments and on the basis of the nature of the oligosaccharide fragments isolated from partial acid hydrolysates of the glycan. The antigen is a diheteroglycan composed of a main chain of trisaccharide units, glucose-β(1,6)-glucose-β(1,4)-galactose, joined by β(1,4) linkages with lactosyl and cellobiosyl side chains attached by β(1,4) linkages at alternate glucose residues of the main chain. The proposed structure for the glycan is consistent with the immunochemical properties of the polymer. Quantitative precipitin inhibition studies clearly indicate that lactosyl residues are the immunodominant determinants of the glycan."

Characterization of the DNA . RNA hybrids by hydroxylapatite chromatography revealed nucleotide sequence diversity among the viruses, detectable both by the amount of cross-hybridization and by the decreased thermal stability of heterologous hybrids."

https://openalex.org/W1582714033,"Abstract A selective adsorbent for the purification of α-galactosidases was prepared by attaching the ligand p-aminophenyl-melibioside by an amide linkage to succinoylaminoalkyl agarose. Small columns packed with this adsorbent quantitatively extracted ceramide trihexosidase activity and other α-galactosidases from plasma and partially purified fractions of these enzymes. Quantitative recovery of the enzymatic activity was readily achieved by the addition of detergent to the eluting buffer. The affinity chromatographic behavior of multiple forms of human ceramide trihexosidase activity has been investigated in plasma, kidney, and urine without prior purification of the enzymes. A total of five different forms of ceramide trihexosidase was observed in normal plasma, along with six forms of α-galactosidase that were specific for p-nitrophenyl-α-galactoside. The same α-galactosidase pattern was observed with urine concentrates, whereas cholate-solubilized lysosomal enzymes from kidney gave a simpler pattern with only one form of ceramide trihexosidase. The three plasma ceramide trihexosidases having optimal activity at pH 7.2 (B forms) were absent in plasma from heterozygous and hemizygous patients with Fabry's disease. Two forms of plasma ceramide trihexosidase with a pH optimum at 5.4 (A forms) were diminished in heterozygotes and were less than 5% of normal activity in plasma from hemizygotes. Only one of the six nonspecific α-galactosidases was deficient in Fabry plasma after affinity chromatography. Several additional proteins with affinity for the ligand were obtained from the plasma of Fabry patients. It is postulated that these proteins are catalytically inactive forms of ceramide trihexosidase."
https://openalex.org/W1518095021,"Abstract The incorporation of N-acetylmannosamine ([3H]ManNAc) and N-acetylglucosamine ([3H]GlcNAc and [14C]GlcNAc) has been studied in rat thyroid hemilobes and homogenates. The radioactive label is incorporated into thyroglobulin (TG), [3H]ManNAc showing a time course more rapid than [3H]GlcNAc. [3H]ManNAc is incorporated directly into 19 S thyroglobulin showing no lower molecular weight-labeled precursors of TG either in the soluble or in the solubilized proteins; [3H]GlcNAc is incorporated into 19 S TG and into precursors both in soluble and solubilized proteins. [3H]ManNAc is converted only into N-acetylneuraminic acid (sialic acid). [3H]GlcNAc and [14C]GlcNAc are incorporated mainly as GlcNAc, and an additional small proportion is converted into sialic acid. Both labeled GlcNAc and sialic acid are found in soluble TG but only GlcNAc is found in membrane-bound TG. [3H]ManNAc is particularly useful to study the last step of carbohydrate incorporation while [3H]GlcNAc is a better tool to study the initiation of carbohydrate incorporation. The presence of the label as sialic acid only in soluble TG suggests that sialic acid is incorporated at the time of TG release from endoplasmic membranes. It may, therefore, serve as an indicator of TG secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1601213165,"Abstract A synthetic RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (R-DNA polymerase) was partially purified from L/929 cells, a cultured mouse fibroblast line. This enzyme which constitutes 15% of the total DNA polymerase activity in L cell extracts differs from the L cell and all known DNA-dependent DNA polymerase (D-DNA polymerases) by its ability to copy, in addition to activated native DNA, the polyribomeric strand of oligomer-homopolymer complexes such as (dT)12·poly(A), (dG)12·poly(C), and (dC)12·poly(I). The L cell R-DNA polymerase also differs from the previously described eukaryotic R-DNA polymerases which are able to copy only activated native DNA and the polyribomeric strand of the complex (dT)12·poly(A). The L cell R-DNA polymerase fails to copy natural RNA templates at a significant rate and therefore also differs from the RNA-dependent DNA polymerase associated with the RNA tumor viruses."
https://openalex.org/W1572081553,"Abstract Two previously undescribed activators of prekallikrein have been purified from human plasma by alcohol fractionation, ion exchange chromatography, gel filtration, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Both were apparently homogeneous as judged by electrophoretic mobility and molecular weight. A monomer-dimer relationship between these two activators is suggested by the use of disc gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate under reducing conditions. The monomer termed large has an estimated molecular weight of 70,000 and migrates as an α-globulin on the polyacrylamide gels. The other activator has an estimated molecular weight of 135,000 and is a β-globulin. No relationship is yet established between these activators and previously described prekallikrein activators, which are of a molecular weight 30,000 to 50,000 and migrate as prealbumin. In contrast to clotting Factor XII (Hageman factor), which also has activator activity, both high molecular weight activators have essentially no clot-promoting activity. Their activator activity is partially inhibited by soybean or lima bean trypsin inhibitors."

https://openalex.org/W1491506330,"Abstract The mouse brain olfactory bulb protein has now been shown to occur in two locations in addition to the olfactory bulb. These two sites, the olfactory epithelium and Jacobson's vomeronasal organ, contain the perikarya of the olfactory bipolar chemoreceptor cells which synapse in the olfactory bulb. The protein is absent from a variety of other sites, both central and peripheral. Utilizing the techniques of 3H-amino acid incorporation, immunoprecipitation, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-acrylamide gel electrophoresis, we have been able to demonstrate that this protein is synthesized in both the olfactory epithelium and Jacobson's vomeronasal organ, but not in the olfactory bulb. These results strongly suggest that this protein is synthe-sized by the olfactory chemoreceptor bipolar neurons, and that it is then transported by axoplasmic flow to the synaptic glomeruli in the olfactory bulb where it was first discovered. This protein is an example of selective genetic expression by a specific neuron."

Similar particles were seen in cells from all three tumors in primary culture. An RNA virus was isolated from these tumors.

A DNA polymerase detected by phosphocellulose chromatography is similar to the enzymes of RNA tumor viruses in that a hybrid of polyriboadenylate and oligodeoxythymidylate is a better template than is DNA. However, this polymerase differed from that of the RNA tumor viruses in its chromatographic behavior. Three different methods of detecting ""reverse transcriptase"" activity failed to correlate with the donor's family history of cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2084814895,"Acetylcholine is transported along insect chemoreceptor axons at a rate of 12 to 13 centimeters per day after peripheral uptake of choline. Colchicine, vinblastine sulfate, and cytochalasin B all block transport, but transport continues in axons separated surgically from the cell body. These data from an insect are in accord with many studies on vertebrates which have implicated intracellular microtubules in the transport mechanism. The peripheral uptake of choline and its acetylation and transport to nerve terminals in the brain are consistent withthe suggestion that acetylcholine is an antennal sensory transmitter in insects."
https://openalex.org/W1574187574,"We have studied the effects of two nucleoside analogues on the synthesis of Rous sarcoma virus and cellular RNA in monolayer cultures of chick embryo fibroblasts. The analogues are 5-fluorouridine and 5-bromotubercidin. 5-Fluorouridine irreversibly inhibits the synthesis of cellular RNA by more than 80%. Most of this inhibition is due to an irreversible block in the formation of ribosomal RNA. Protein synthesis continues at disproportionately elevated rates for several days, suggesting that messenger RNA synthesis also is maintained. The synthesis of heterogeneous nuclear RNA is not blocked by 5-fluorouridine; the same holds for the Rous sarcoma virus-RNA and Rous sarcoma virus-protein. Although normal quantities of Rous sarcoma virus are produced in cultures exposed to 5-fluorouridine, the infectivity is decreased; this is correlated with a profound inhibition of viral glycoprotein synthesis, and is in contrast to the effect of the aglycone, 5-fluorouracil, which does not decrease infectious virus yield under the same conditions. In contrast to the effects of 5-fluorouridine, 5-bromotubercidin reversibly blocks the synthesis of heterogeneous nuclear RNA as well as that of ribosomal RNA. Likewise 5-bromotubercidin blocks the synthesis of Rous sarcoma virus-RNA and, following a lag period of 8 to 10 hours, 5-bromotubercidin also inhibits the synthesis of viral proteins and mature virions. In relation to the action of the analogues, the synthesis of Rous sarcoma virus-RNA shares the specificity of heterogeneous RNA and mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1574493988,"Abstract The activity of uridine kinase in rat liver is markedly enhanced following the intraperitoneal administration of 5-azacytidine by a process independent of adrenal secretion. The enhancement of enzyme activity is dose-dependent and is maximal at 24 to 28 hours following the administration of the analogue. The increase of uridine kinase in the liver is unaffected by a number of compounds interfering with DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis. Only cytidine and uridine administered in excess simultaneously with 5-azacytidine reverse the effect of the drug. Multiple doses of 5-azacytidine increase the activity of uridine kinase 4- to 5-fold followed by its subsequent decrease. The renewed enhancement of the enzyme activity is possible by further administrations of the drug. From the effect of actinomycin D, the calculated half-time of template RNA for liver uridine kinase is about 24 hours. Partially purified uridine kinase from the liver of 5-azacytidine-treated rats differs from the control enzyme preparation by its higher stability toward heating."

https://openalex.org/W1498048908,"Abstract A number of novel monophosphorylated aminocyclitol derivatives have been prepared enzymatically, utilizing the phosphotransferase activity of enzyme preparations containing streptomycin 6-phosphate phosphatase, an enzyme believed to catalyze the final step in the biosynthesis of streptomycin by Streptomyces. Aminodeoxyinositols, streptamine (1,3-diamino-1,3-dideoxy-scyllo-inositol), and 2-deoxystreptamine, at concentrations in the millimolar range, compete effectively with 55 m water for phosphate transferred by these enzyme preparations from either dihydrostreptomycin 6-[32P]phosphate or p-nitrophenyl phosphate. Phosphate is preferentially esterified by action of streptomycin 6-phosphate phosphatase preparations with hydroxyl groups ortho to amino groups of aminocyclitol acceptors; in contrast, ATP:aminocyclitol kinase phosphorylates hydroxyl groups para to specific amino groups of its aminocyclitol substrates. One of the several phosphorylated streptamine isomers formed by action of streptomycin 6-phosphate phosphatase preparations on streptamine appears to be identical with the product formed by action of ATP:aminocyclitol kinase on streptamine, 1l-1,3-diamino-1,3-dideoxy-scyllo-inositol 4-phosphate, as judged by ability of both reaction products to act as substrates for l-arginine:aminocyclitol 4-phosphate amidinotransferase. Analogous results were obtained with 2-deoxystreptamine. This occurs because in streptamine and 2-deoxystreptamine a phosphate group ortho to one amino group can be para to the other amino group. None of the phosphorylated aminodeoxy-scyllo-inositol isomers formed by action of streptomycin 6-phosphate phosphatase preparations was a substrate for aminocyclitol 4-phosphate amidinotransferase. These results support our structural assignments for phosphorylated intermediates in the biosynthesis of the streptidine moiety of streptomycin."
https://openalex.org/W1996899047,"AMONG the living fishes, groups of widely different phylogenetic antiquity may be classified by equally diverse sets of characteristics, both morphometric and biochemical. One such character that has been used in the study of the relationships between the major groups is cellular DNA content. It is now well known that, among fishes, modern teleosts have the lowest diploid levels (as low as 0.8 pg) and that elasmobranchs have somewhat intermediate levels (3–15 pg). The Dipnoi have the highest levels among living vertebrates (160–285 pg), and these values are approached most closely by some (but by no means all) Amphibia, such as Necturus and Amphiuma (205 and 192 pg respectively)1,2."
https://openalex.org/W1580354841,"The techniques of isoelectric focusing and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis have been used to demonstrate multiple forms of pig heart succinate thiokinase. There are at least five peaks of enzyme having isoelectric points of 6.4, 6.2, 6.0, 5.9, and 5.8; all are similar with respect to apparent molecular weight, heat stability, pH optimum, and reaction rates with substrate analogs. Also, two other forms with isoelectric points of 5.6 and 5.3 are seen under certain conditions. Isotopic studies show that a major portion of the enzyme is phosphorylated in its native state, with the pI 6.2, 6.0, 5.9, and 5.8 peaks containing the same number of phosphates bound per unit of enzymic activity. The pI 6.4 form lacks exchangeable phosphate but can be converted to the pI 6.2, 6.0, and 5.9 forms by GTP. The pI 6.2 enzyme is converted to the 6.0 and 5.9 forms by the same treatment. When the pI 6.2 or 6.0 forms are incubated with coenzyme A, the pI 6.4 enzyme can be regenerated. Since the pI 6.4 enzyme contains neither exchangeable phosphate nor CoA, it has been called the free enzyme form. The free enzyme is unstable, losing up to 50% of its activity in 2 hours, but it may be protected by glycerol. The interconvertibility of the various enzymes is also seen when the pI 5.9 peak distributes to the other phosphorylated forms upon refocusing."

The data reveal that: actinomycin Pip 2 contains 2 residues of pipecolic acid, actinomycin Pip 1β possesses 1 residue each of pipecolic acid and proline, and actinomycin Pip 1α contains pipecolic acid and 4-oxopipecolic acid per mole of actinomycin. 4-Oxopipecolic acid is a normal constituent of a number of peptide antibiotics, e.g. ostreogrycin, vernamycin Bα, and staphylomycin."
