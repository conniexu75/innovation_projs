https://openalex.org/W2040414737,"IN a search for an agent for revealing the position of choline and other N-methylated alkanolamines separated by chromatography on papers, iodine was found satisfactory. It can be either directly sublimed on to the dried paper or sprayed in alcoholic solution, methods having their special advantages. during the sublimation or spraying, spots of a brown to yellow colour develop, and they grow more distinct when any excess iodine or solvent is fanned away. Inspection in ultra-violet light sometimes makes the border-lines of the spots more easily discernible. As fading rapidly sets in, the spots are best judged immediately and outlined with pencil. After some heating or hanging at room temperature, the colour of the spots caused by most substances disappears completely. New iodine treatment then again reveals them."

https://openalex.org/W2084957982,RECENT work on contractile phenomena in muscle1 indicates that a complete understanding of these processes demands a fuller knowledge of the sub-microscopic morphology and distribution of the mineral content. An electron microscopic study of muscle has therefore been undertaken as part of a general investigation of fibrous proteins2 in progress in this laboratory. The present communication represents a part of the investigation which should be of immediate interest to workers in this field.

https://openalex.org/W1970529028,"IN 1936, during work on the cytology of P. brassicae, zoosporangia identical with those of this well-known parasite were seen by me in root hairs of grass and dock seedlings, which had appeared in a pot of soil taken from a garden in which the club root disease of the Cruciferse was a major problem. In view of the known persistence of P. brassicae in soils without cruciferous crops, it was decided to attempt a crude cross-inoculation experiment using club root galls as a starting point. Suitable soil was partially sterilized by keeping it at 190° F. for one hour. Ten six-inch pots were filled with this soil, and club root galls with unbroken surfaces, but of an age known to contain mature spore masses, were cut up and placed in five of them. Brussels sprout seedlings germinated in these pots became infected, and an examination of the root hairs of the grass Holcus lanatus grown from seed with them in the re-infected soil revealed numerous zoosporangia and some free-swimming zoospores."

https://openalex.org/W2003208375,"IN order to check the constitution of preparations of the three different tritium toluenes carrying radiochemical amounts of tritium in the aromatic nucleus, samples were transformed into 2,4-dinitrotoluene with an excess of a mixture of 1 part (by volume) of concentrated nitric acid and 2 parts of concentrated sulphuric acid. An experiment in which inactive toluene was nitrated with a rather strongly active mixture of acids showed that no hydrogen exchange takes place under the conditions of the reaction. No activity could be detected in the dinitrotoluene, though it had been possible to record an acquired tritium : protium ratio as small as 1 per cent of that of the surrounding mixture of acids and water, even if only one of the organic hydrogen atoms had taken part in the exchange."

Further work on a variety of herbage plant juices has confirmed the early findings2, and has led to the separation from lucerne juice, purification and probable chemical identification, of a substance capable of inhibiting muscle movement."

https://openalex.org/W2037568599,"HOLLANDE1 considered that living protoplasm in in general consisted of filamentous, hyaline tubes with numerous clusters, made up of two punctiform corpuscles, distributed over their surface ; and that the nucleus had a comparable structure. Hollande and Hollande2 made similar findings for Bacteria and Cyanophycese. Drennan3, studying human blood, described granules which moved freely in the serum and which were of different kinds, as they reacted differently to stains and varied in size and degree of motility. Sparrow and Hammond4 noted Feulgen-positive bodies in the cytoplasm of the meiotic prophase stages of microsporocytes in eleven different flowering plants. These bodies appeared to originate in the nucleus or at the nuclear membrane. They regarded the positive Feulgen reaction together with high absorption at 2537 A. and 2650 A. as proof that the bodies contained desoxyribose nucleic acid, and strong absorption at 2804 A. as an indication that protein also was present. Calvet, Siegel and Stern5, as a result of electron optical observations, reported that the resting nuclei of calf thymus lymphocytes, treated with lanthanum acetate, showed nucleoprotein ultra-fibrils of approximate thickness 80–100 A. These appeared banded. They concluded that the banded appearance was probably due to the coiling of a fine thread to form long helices and that the spirals might lbe formed by individual desoxyribonucleoprotein molecules in combination with lanthanum ions. Malvesin-Fabre6 found, in the living nuclei of Arum italicum, that there were chromocentres which continuously changed their form and appearance and that the nucleus showed continuous activity in the resting stage. Ritche7, working on fixed and stained basidia of Amanita cæsaria, found extra-nuclear inclusions, frequently near the base of the basidium, which were readily stained with hsematoxylin and were Feulgen-positive. He regarded them as chromatic in nature."

https://openalex.org/W2072956514,"IN previous papers1,2, it has been established that when radish or carrot root slices were suspended in sucrose solution, the latter was always inverted in the medium before its absorption by the tissue slices, and the inversion was always faster than the uptake, hence the accumulation of invert sugar in the culture medium. Gawadi3 and Burström4 showed that sucrose inversion takes place by means of invertase centres attached to the outer cytoplasmic surfaces of cells of the slices. Saïd1 found that when slices of varied thicknesses were suspended in sucrose solution, the rate of inversion in the medium was directly proportional to the number of exposed surfaces per mass of tissue slices."
https://openalex.org/W2056847679,"IT has been established that multiple-beam fringes of equal chromatic order are particularly sensitive for the evaluation of small surface angles. Yet they suffer from a disadvantage in that the angle shown by the fringes depends upon the orientation of the surface relative to the spectrograph slit. In fact, a resolved component of any surface angle appears, and in general it is necessary to rotate the surface under observation to find the maximum corresponding to the true surface angle."
https://openalex.org/W1623221241,"THE action of sulphanilamide on plant growth shows many parallels to its action on bacterial growth. As Bonner1, and more recently Audus and Quastel2, have shown, sulphanilamide will completely abolish growth in length or wet-weight of roots. This inhibition, as in bacteria, is competitively reversed by addition of p-aminobenzoic acid to the nutrient solution. Audus and Quastel, however, are of the opinion that the competitive reversal is of a different nature in root growth from that in bacterial growth. Their evidence for this statement is based on the fact that, while in bacteria reversal is complete even with a p-aminobenzoic acid concentration 1/50 to 1/4,000 that of sulphanilamide, in roots reversal is complete only when the ratio of sulphanilamide to p-aminobenzoic acid is approximately unity."
https://openalex.org/W2047346810,"IN 1903 Schultz directed attention to the blue, acid-soluble pigment which occurs in the shells of the Californian abalone. Subsequent studies by Schultz, Schultz and Becker1, Kodzuka2 and Lemberg3 have further subdivided the pigments present ; but there has been no agreement as to their identity. Schultz, in his later papers, pointed to the similarity between the visible absorption band of the main pigment (λmax. 622 mµ) and that of the known indigos, and Lemberg identified the pigment provisionally as pyrrole body, since its solubility in dilute acids as greater than that of most indigoids. The pigment as known to give a strong colour reaction with nitrites and with fuming nitric acid. There has been doubt about the exact nature of this reaction, and about the number of pigments responsible for it."

https://openalex.org/W2334457692,"PART 3 of the ""Experimental Studies in the Nature of Species"" (the Environmental Responses of Climatic Races of Achillea"", by J. Clausen, D. D.Keck and W. H. Hiesey, Carnegie Institute of Washington Publication 581, 1948) is a worthy member of a remarkable series of researches which is rapidly casting a flood of light on the dynamics of evolutionary processes. Starting with Turesson's concepts of ecotypes, etc., and from his simple technical approach to the detection of physiological subdivisions within the lowest taxonomic units, the effective collaboration of three very different members of a powerful team, amplified by the natural resources of California, have developed a series of refined techniques for revealing evolution in action in a way which has not been attempted elsewhere."
https://openalex.org/W1968899956,"IT was often emphasized by the late Sir Frederick Gowland Hopkins that a study of the individual cell and of ihe organisation of chemical reactions within the cell was the true objective of biochemistry. The relationship of genetic constitution to chemical activity is, in such a connexion, a matter of first importance ; but it was not until some ten years ago that investigations of this nature could be applied experimentally to unicellular organisms. Following a proper advance in technique, derived largely from the work of Beadle and Tatum, corresponding advances have taken place in the elucidation of genetico-biochemical problems."

https://openalex.org/W2039585830,"THE resistance-capacity tuned oscillator is well known as a very good generator of audio-frequency oscillations. In a recent communication by Rakshit and Bhattacharyya1 it was pointed out that the conventional circuit of a three-phase system, with components selected for producing audio-frequency oscillations, invariably generates radio-frequencies by virtue of the unavoidable stray and inter-electrode capacities. In fact, with the simple three-phase oscillator it is impossible to generate audio-frequencies unless certain modifications are introduced in the circuit. It was further pointed out that the three-phase radio-frequency oscillator can easily be made to generate frequency-modulated oscillations by varying the tuning resistance of one of the oscillator stages by the modulating voltage."

https://openalex.org/W4234027870,"THE recent debates on defence and on man-power in the House of commons have one feature in common. Though the more responsible speeches there ran a thread of anxiety as to the man-power resources of Great Britain ; whether that distribution was, in fact the most appropriate for current and future needs, and whether the most effective use was being made of man-power in the occupations where it is at present deployed. In the defence debate, concern as to the actual targets for man power was expressed on the Government side of the House, notably in regard to recruiting both for the Army and for the Air Force. Further, the Minister of Defence referred to his intention of expanding the research staffs in the scientific services, which for the last two or three years have been kept below the desired strength because of what were regarded as the more urgent claims of the universities, the teaching profession and industry, in accordance with the priorities recommended in the Barlow Report on scientific man-power."
https://openalex.org/W4240135049,"TWO ""Educational Papers"" have recently been published by the British Social Hygiene Council. No. 1 deals with ""Biology in the Secondary Modern School"", by Frank Tyrer, while No. 2 is concerned with ""Social Biology for Sixth Forms"", by Eric Lucas. Presumably, coming from such a source, they may be looked upon as propaganda or, more correctly, information of use to those who sympathize with the ideals of the British Social Hygiene Council, and, in this case, are actively concerned with the spread of those ideals, for they are both pamphlets of primary use to teachers. Presumably again, they must have been passed by an editorial board or at least an editor. But what is most puzzling is how two such completely diverse pamphlets could have been approved by the same editor, for, if either one points the good way to teaching the subject then, without any shadow of doubt, the other points in the opposite direction."
