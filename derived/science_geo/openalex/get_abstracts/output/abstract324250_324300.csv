https://openalex.org/W2005458408,Development of ovarian eggs and secretory activity of colleterial glands are inhibited by the oötheca in the oöthecal chamber of Blattella germanica (L.) and by the oötheca in the uterus of Pycnoscelus surinamensis (L.). The inhibition is due to nervous stimuli from pressure of the oötheca. Removing the oötheca or severing the ventral nerve cord eliminates inhibition of the corpora allata and results in premature development of the oöcytes and resumption of activity of the colleterial glands.

At least 5000 ft of movement occurred between the early and middle Pliocene. Progressively diminishing movement since then amounts to 4000 ft."

https://openalex.org/W2026510997,"Roots of decapitated sunflower plants absorbed iron from the ferric chelate of ethylenediamine di(o-hydroxyphenylacetic acid), leaving most of the acid in the nutrient solution. The chelating capacity of the nutrient solution increased as iron was absorbed by the plants. Most of the absorbed iron was found in the plant exudate."
