https://openalex.org/W2055887948,"Empiric quantification of human mobility patterns is paramount for better urban planning, understanding social network structure and responding to infectious disease threats, especially in light of rapid growth in urbanization and globalization. This need is of particular relevance for developing countries, since they host the majority of the global urban population and are disproportionally affected by the burden of disease. We used Global Positioning System (GPS) data-loggers to track the fine-scale (within city) mobility patterns of 582 residents from two neighborhoods from the city of Iquitos, Peru. We used ∼2.3 million GPS data-points to quantify age-specific mobility parameters and dynamic co-location networks among all tracked individuals. Geographic space significantly affected human mobility, giving rise to highly local mobility kernels. Most (∼80%) movements occurred within 1 km of an individual’s home. Potential hourly contacts among individuals were highly irregular and temporally unstructured. Only up to 38% of the tracked participants showed a regular and predictable mobility routine, a sharp contrast to the situation in the developed world. As a case study, we quantified the impact of spatially and temporally unstructured routines on the dynamics of transmission of an influenza-like pathogen within an Iquitos neighborhood. Temporally unstructured daily routines (e.g., not dominated by a single location, such as a workplace, where an individual repeatedly spent significant amount of time) increased an epidemic’s final size and effective reproduction number by 20% in comparison to scenarios modeling temporally structured contacts. Our findings provide a mechanistic description of the basic rules that shape human mobility within a resource-poor urban center, and contribute to the understanding of the role of fine-scale patterns of individual movement and co-location in infectious disease dynamics. More generally, this study emphasizes the need for careful consideration of human social interactions when designing infectious disease mitigation strategies, particularly within resource-poor urban environments."
https://openalex.org/W2017356020,"Hypertension is an important and modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease and mortality. Over the last decade, national-levels of controlled hypertension have increased, but little information on hypertension prevalence and trends in hypertension treatment and control exists at the county-level. We estimate trends in prevalence, awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension in US counties using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) in five two-year waves from 1999–2008 including 26,349 adults aged 30 years and older and from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) from 1997–2009 including 1,283,722 adults aged 30 years and older. Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure (BP) of at least 140 mm Hg, self-reported use of antihypertensive treatment, or both. Hypertension control was defined as systolic BP less than 140 mm Hg. The median prevalence of total hypertension in 2009 was estimated at 37.6% (range: 26.5 to 54.4%) in men and 40.1% (range: 28.5 to 57.9%) in women. Within-state differences in the county prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension were as high as 7.8 percentage points in 2009. Awareness, treatment, and control was highest in the southeastern US, and increased between 2001 and 2009 on average. The median county-level control in men was 57.7% (range: 43.4 to 65.9%) and in women was 57.1% (range: 43.0 to 65.46%) in 2009, with highest rates in white men and black women. While control of hypertension is on the rise, prevalence of total hypertension continues to increase in the US. Concurrent increases in treatment and control of hypertension are promising, but efforts to decrease the prevalence of hypertension are needed."
https://openalex.org/W2023198468,"Assessment of anxiety symptoms in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is a challenging task due to the symptom overlap between the two conditions as well as the difficulties in communication and awareness of emotions in ASD. This motivates the development of a physiological marker of anxiety in ASD that is independent of language and does not require observation of overt behaviour. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of using indicators of autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity for this purpose. Specially, the objectives of the study were to 1) examine whether or not anxiety causes significant measurable changes in indicators of ANS in an ASD population, and 2) characterize the pattern of these changes in ASD. We measured three physiological indicators of the autonomic nervous system response (heart rate, electrodermal activity, and skin temperature) during a baseline (movie watching) and anxiety condition (Stroop task) in a sample of typically developing children (n = 17) and children with ASD (n = 12). The anxiety condition caused significant changes in heart rate and electrodermal activity in both groups, however, a differential pattern of response was found between the two groups. In particular, the ASD group showed elevated heart rate during both baseline and anxiety conditions. Elevated and blunted phasic electrodermal activity were found in the ASD group during baseline and anxiety conditions, respectively. Finally, the ASD group did not show the typical decrease in skin temperature in response to anxiety. These results suggest that 1) signals of the autonomic nervous system may be used as indicators of anxiety in children with ASD, and 2) ASD may be associated with an atypical autonomic response to anxiety that is most consistent with sympathetic over-arousal and parasympathetic under-arousal."

At the two opposite ends of the homeostatic system spectrum are heat shock response and autophagy. Here, we tested whether there are interactions between these homeostatic systems, one universally operational in all prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, and the other one (autophagy) is limited to eukaryotes. We found that heat shock response regulates autophagy. The interaction between the two systems was demonstrated by testing the role of HSF-1, the central regulator of heat shock gene expression. Knockdown of HSF-1 increased the LC3 lipidation associated with formation of autophagosomal organelles, whereas depletion of HSF-1 potentiated both starvation- and rapamycin-induced autophagy. HSP70 expression but not expression of its ATPase mutant inhibited starvation or rapamycin-induced autophagy. We also show that exercise induces autophagy in humans. As predicted by our in vitro studies, glutamine supplementation as a conditioning stimulus prior to exercise significantly increased HSP70 protein expression and prevented the expected exercise induction of autophagy. Our data demonstrate for the first time that heat shock response, from the top of its regulatory cascade (HSF-1) down to the execution stages delivered by HSP70, controls autophagy thus connecting and coordinating the two extreme ends of the homeostatic systems in the eukaryotic cell.Background: Both autophagy and the heat stress response represent protein management alternatives for the stressed cell.

Conclusion: Heat shock response plays a negative role in autophagy regulation. Significance: Heat shock response regulates autophagy. Protein management is an evolutionary early and highly conserved cellular function. Both prokaryotes and eukaryotes rely on the heat shock protein (HSP) 2The abbreviations used are: HSP, heat shock protein; EBSS, Earle's balanced salt solution; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cell; Baf, bafilomycin A1; IFU, infectious unit. chaperone system to fold and assemble proteins, as well as to refold or facilitate the breakdown of irreversibly denatured proteins resulting from stress. Eukaryotes additionally employ autophagy (1Mizushima N. Levine B. Autophagy in mammalian development and differentiation.Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 823-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar, 2Kroemer G. Mariño G. Levine B. Autophagy and the integrated stress response.Mol. Cell. 2010; 40: 280-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2571) Google Scholar) to sequester and deliver for degradation to lysosomes large protein aggregates and whole damaged organelles inaccessible to smaller proteolytic systems in the cell. Thus, the heat shock response and macroautophagy represent two ends of the spectrum of cellular protein quality control with the former being ubiquitous in all living organisms, whereas the latter is restricted to eukaryotic cells. Under conditions of cellular stress, these two systems are likely to complement each other. Surprisingly, their interactions and coordination of function have not been investigated. Given the significant evolutionary distances between these protein management systems, and the fact that one (HSP) has a protein conservation function, we hypothesized that cells may prioritize the HSP response over autophagy and that the HSP system would exert a control over autophagy under conditions where both could be activated. Autophagy can be divided into several main steps (3Mizushima N. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi Y. The role of Atg proteins in autophagosome formation.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2011; 27: 107-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar). Initially, a portion of the cytoplasm or a damaged organelle is engulfed by double- or multimembrane autophagic vacuoles or autophagosomes, followed by completion of the autophagosomes that finally fuse with lysosomes to form autolysosomes leading to degradation of the captured material (3Mizushima N.

Levine B. Autophagy modulation as a potential therapeutic target for diverse diseases.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2012; 11: 709-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar). At basal levels, autophagy is detected in all eukaryotic cells clearing misfolded and unfolded proteins. Under starvation, autophagy represents a physiological response providing biofuel from degraded macromolecules to maintain sufficient ATP production for adaptive macromolecular synthesis to survive stressful conditions (5Levine B. Deretic V. Unveiling the roles of autophagy in innate and adaptive immunity.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 767-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 6Ravikumar B. Futter M. Jahreiss L.

Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 1707-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Autophagy is a highly controlled and orchestrated process (3Mizushima N. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi Y.

Among numerous autophagy-related proteins (ATG proteins) and kinases, serine/threonine kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is considered a critical negative regulator in autophagy induction. mTOR activity is regulated upstream by several kinases. Akt activates mTOR and inhibits autophagy through activation of the mTOR upstream regulator tuberous sclerosis complex 1/2 (TSC1/2) (7Ren Y. Huang F. Liu Y. Yang Y. Jiang Q. Xu C.

Interestingly, p53 plays a dual role in autophagy regulation. On the one hand, p53 activation potentiated autophagy through inhibition of the mTOR pathway (13Feng Z. Zhang H. Levine A.J. Jin S. The coordinate regulation of the p53 and mTOR pathways in cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 8204-8209Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). On the other hand, induction of autophagy was initiated by utilizing knock-out, knockdown, or pharmacological inhibition of p53 (14Tasdemir E. Maiuri M.C. Galluzzi L. Vitale I. Djavaheri-Mergny M.

Exposure to a variety of stresses, including heat, radiation, or heavy metals, can lead to protein denaturation, damage of nucleic acid, and even death. In addition to external stressors, homeostasis of the organism may often be compromised by internal physiological and pathological inducers, including exercise, ischemia, and inflammation. To survive this ever-changing environment, single cells and organisms have the ability to cope with the stress-induced damage by up-regulating the specific proteins called heat shock proteins. HSP70 offers protection against the damaging factors at the level of macromolecules, single cells, as well as whole organisms. HSPs, as molecular chaperones, assist in correct folding of newly synthesized proteins, translocation, degradation, and reactivation of damaged proteins (15Moseley P.L. Gapen C. Wallen E.S.

In Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells, heat stress preconditioning was associated with increased maintenance of epithelial barrier function in response to sever heat exposure (15Moseley P.L.

Recently, our group has demonstrated that HSP70 overexpression regulated cytokine levels in animals (30Dokladny K. Lobb R. Wharton W. Ma T.Y. Moseley P.L. LPS-induced cytokine levels are repressed by elevated expression of HSP70 in rats: possible role of NF-κB.Cell Stress Chaperones. 2010; 15: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) in a manner similar to heat conditioning (31Kluger M.J. Rudolph K. Soszynski D. Conn C.A. Leon L.R. Kozak W. Wallen E.S. Moseley P.L. Effect of heat stress on LPS-induced fever and tumor necrosis factor.Am. J.

There are several observations showing that cellular chaperone may also play a regulatory role in autophagy. The chemically induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress resulted in an increase in autophagy leading to cell death. This effect was partially associated with down-regulation of the Akt/TSC/mTOR pathway (33Qin L. Wang Z. Tao L. Wang Y. ER stress negatively regulates AKT/TSC/mTOR pathway to enhance autophagy.Autophagy. 2010; 6: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). A chemical chaperone, 4-phenylbutyric acid, prevented this ER-induced decrease in mTOR pathway leading to an autophagy inhibition, suggesting that cellular chaperone is important in autophagy regulation. In other studies, exposure to OSU-03012, a derivative of the cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor celecoxib in HCT116 (human colorectal carcinoma cell line) and U251 (human glioma cell line), resulted in cell death and induction of autophagy. Transient knockdown of HSP70 expression potentiated and overexpression prevented OSU-03012-induced increase in cytotoxicity and autophagy (34Park M.A. Yacoub A. Rahmani M. Zhang G. Hart L. Hagan M.P. Calderwood S.K. Sherman M.Y. Koumenis C. Spiegel S. Chen C.S. Graf M. Curiel D.T. Fisher P.B. Grant S. Dent P. OSU-03012 stimulates PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum-dependent increases in 70-kDa heat shock protein expression, attenuating its lethal actions in transformed cells.Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 73: 1168-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In rats, heat stress exposure (core temperature at 41 °C for 0.5 h) resulted in a significant increase in autophagy associated with subcellular injury and damage of hepatocytes, suggesting that HSPs may play a regulatory role in autophagy. Recently, it has been published that exercise induced autophagy in mice (35He C. Bassik M.C. Moresi V. Sun K. Wei Y. Zou Z. An Z. Loh J. Fisher J. Sun Q. Korsmeyer S. Packer M. May H.I. Hill J.A.

Exercise induces autophagy in peripheral tissues and in the brain.Autophagy. 2012; 8: 1548-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). However, the role of HSP70 in starvation-induced autophagy still remains known. Here, we tested this model and showed that HSF-1, the central regulator of heat shock response, inhibits autophagy. The negative regulatory effect of HSF-1 on autophagy was exerted via one its principal effectors, HSP70. We also show that exercise induces autophagy in human PBMCs, and this increase in autophagy is prevented by glutamine supplementation, associated with a significant augmentation in HSP70. These data provide the first evidence directly linking the HSP and autophagy systems and demonstrate a master regulatory role of HSP70 in controlling autophagy. A549 cells (human lung epithelial carcinoma cell line), Caco-2 cells (colorectal adenocarcinoma), and NCI-H1299 cells (human non-small cell lung cancer; ATCC catalog no. CRL-5803TM) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained at 37 °C in a culture medium composed of DMEM with 4.5 mg/ml glucose, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 units/ml streptomycin, 4 mm glutamine, and 25 mm HEPES and supplemented with heat-inactivated 10% fetal calf serum that was purchased from Invitrogen. Stock cultures were maintained in 100-mm dishes and were subcultured every 3–4 days. Cultures for all assays were maintained in 35-mm tissue culture plates (Corning Inc., Corning, NY). Rapamycin was purchased from LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA). LC3 and β-actin antibodies were purchased from Sigma. HSP70 and HSF1 antibodies were obtained from StressGen Biotechnologies (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). CHOP and eIF2α (total and phosphor) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). XBP-1 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Dallas, TX). Triton X-100, bovine serum albumin, normal donkey serum, and anti-β-actin antibody were purchased from Sigma. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies for Western blot analysis were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Cy-5 antibodies for immunostaining were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). Tween 20 and nonfat dry milk were purchased from Bio-Rad. All other chemicals were of reagent grade and were purchased from Sigma, VWR (West Chester, PA), or Fisher. As described previously (30Dokladny K. Lobb R. Wharton W. Ma T.Y. Moseley P.L. LPS-induced cytokine levels are repressed by elevated expression of HSP70 in rats: possible role of NF-κB.Cell Stress Chaperones. 2010; 15: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), the HSP70 coding region was amplified from pRc/RSV-HSP72 provided by Dr. Anne Knowlton (University of California, Davis) using primer sets that were designed to add HindIII and XbaI sites to the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, and inserted into the pRc/CMV vector to construct a vector termed RP70. In a similar manner, the coding region was amplified using primers to add NotI and XbaI sites and cloned into pAdTrack (Ad70). Recombination with the adenovirus backbone was performed in BJ5183-AD-1 cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and the resulting construct was transfected into 293 cells to produce virus directing the expression of exogenous HSP70. Recombination with the parent pAdTrack (AdTrack) plasmid created the construct used as a control in all experiments. Cells were infected either with control adenovirus or adenovirus directing the expression of HSP70 (a total dose of 2.5 × 1010 IFUs per plate) for 72 h. Site-directed mutagenesis of HSP70 was performed according to the to the manufacturer's instruction manual (Agilent Technologies, Inc. Santa Clara, CA). As described previously (29Dokladny K. Ye D. Kennedy J.C. Moseley P.L. Ma T.Y. Cellular and molecular mechanisms of heat stress-induced up-regulation of occludin protein expression: regulatory role of heat shock factor-1.Am. J. Pathol. 2008; 172: 659-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), to silence HSF-1, ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool (Dharmacon, Inc., Chicago) was used. The sequences for HSF-1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) were as follows: 5′-PUACUUGGGCAUGGAAUGUGUU-3′; 5′-PGUCCAUAGCAUCCAAGUGGUU-3′; 5′-PUAUGUCUUCACUCUUCAGGUU-3′; and 5′-PUGAAUCCGGGCUGCUGUUCUU-3′. A549 cells monolayers were transiently transfected using DharmaFect transfection reagent (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO). A549 cells were seeded into a six-well plate and grown to 80% confluency. A549 monolayers were then washed with PBS, and Opti-MEM medium was added to the well. The plasmid vector containing the siRNA of HSF-1 and DharmaFect reagent was preincubated in Opti-MEM. After 5 min of incubation, two solutions were mixed and incubated for another 20 min, and the mixture was added to each well. After incubation for 3 h at 37 °C, 500 μl of DMEM containing 10% FBS and no antibiotics were added to cell culture media to reach a 2.5% final concentration of FBS. The siRNA-induced silencing of HSF-1 was confirmed by immunoblot of HSF-1. The total RNA was isolated from A549 cells using RNeasy kit (Qiagen), and cDNA was generated using QuantiTect reverse transcription kit (Qiagen) as per the manufacturer's instructions. The quantitative RT-PCR was performed using SYBR Green I QuantiFast SYBR Green kit (Qiagen) as per the manufacturer's instructions using the following amplification conditions: PCR initial activation step, 95 °C for 5 min; two-step cycling, 40 cycles of denaturation, 95 °C for 10 s; combined annealing/extension, 60 °C for 10 s. The primers for p62 were as follows: forward primer, 5′-cacctgtctgagggcttctc-3′; reverse primer, 5′-agtttcctggtggacccatt-3′. The results were analyzed using relative quantification by comparing ratios of p62 gene and reference housekeeping gene, β-actin (internal control gene). Relative quantification of expression of the p62 gene was studied, and the fold change in expression of p62 gene was calculated relative to β-actin. The mean fold change in expression of the p62 gene was calculated using 2−ΔΔCT method. For LC3 and HSF-1 activation determined by Western blot analysis and binding assay, cells were harvested and nuclear extracts were prepared. To study the effect of HSP70 protein overexpression on macroautophagy, A549, Caco-2, or NCI-H1299 monolayers were infected with the adenovirus (a total dose of 2.5 × 1010 IFUs per plate) for 3 days followed by starvation in Earle's balanced salt solution (EBSS) for 2 h. Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (28Dokladny K. Moseley P.L. Ma T.Y. Physiologically relevant increase in temperature causes an increase in intestinal epithelial tight junction permeability.Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2006; 290: G204-G212Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar); at the end of the experimental period, monolayers were immediately rinsed with ice-cold PBS, and cells were lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 500 μm NaF, 2 mm EDTA, 100 μm vanadate, 100 μm PMSF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 40 mm para-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1% Triton X-100) and scraped, and the cell lysates were placed in microcentrifuge tubes. Cell lysates were centrifuged to yield a clear lysate. Supernatant was collected, and protein measurement was performed using the protein assay kit from Bio-Rad. Laemmli gel loading buffer was added to the lysate containing 5–10 μg of protein and boiled for 7 min, after which proteins were separated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins from the gel were transferred to the membrane (Trans-Blot Transfer Medium, Nitrocellulose Membrane; Bio-Rad) overnight. The membrane was incubated for 2 h in blocking solution (5% dry milk in TBS/Tween 20 buffer). The membrane was incubated with appropriate primary antibodies in blocking solution. After being washed in TBS/Tween buffer, the membrane was incubated in appropriate secondary antibodies and developed using the Santa Cruz Western blotting luminol reagents (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) on the Kodak BioMax MS film (Fisher). Endogenous p62 puncta were detected by indirect immunofluorescence using a mouse anti-p62 antibody (BD Biosciences) that was detected by an AlexaFluor568-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Invitrogen). Stained samples were imaged using Cellomics Array Scan (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) in which 49 fields were collected per well in 96-well plates. The mean number of p62 puncta per infected (GFP-positive) cell was then determined by a puncta-counting application integrated within the iDev software (Thermo Scientific). For immunostaining of LC3 and HSP70 proteins, monolayers grown on coverslips were exposed to appropriate experimental conditions. As described previously (29Dokladny K. Ye D. Kennedy J.C.

Then cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS at room temperature for 20 min. The monolayers were then incubated in blocking solution composed of bovine serum albumin and normal donkey serum in PBS for 1 h. Cells were then labeled with primary antibodies in blocking solution overnight at 4 °C. After being washed with PBS, the coverslips were incubated in appropriate Cy-5-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature and mounted on microscope slides (Erie Scientific, Portsmouth, NH). Immunolocalizations of TJ proteins were visualized using a Nikon fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Garden City, NY) equipped with a Hamamatsu digital camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan). Images were processed with Wasabi software (Hamamatsu Photonics Deutschland, Herrsching, Germany). To induce thermal stress, cells were grown on 35-mm plates and placed in a bath in a manner that the dishes rested directly on water that was heated to 42 °C. To maintain 5% CO2 concentration during heat exposure, air containing CO2 was circulated through the sealed bath. Eight total endurance-trained adult men and women (age 18–45) who suffer from exercise-induced gastrointestinal distress were recruited from the University population and local running clubs. All subjects completed a health questionnaire, and a full explanation of procedures, discomforts, and risks were explained before written informed consent was obtained. Selection criteria included a report of gastrointestinal symptoms on at least five occasions during exercise and currently participating in an endurance run training program. Potential subjects were excluded if taking medications (antidepressants) or nutritional supplements. All testing was per"

In an effort to advance the protection of a highly threatened hotspot of marine biodiversity, the Mediterranean Sea, multiple spatial conservation plans have been developed in recent years. Here, we review and integrate these different plans with the goal of identifying priority conservation areas that represent the current consensus among the different initiatives. A review of six existing and twelve proposed conservation initiatives highlights gaps in conservation and management planning, particularly within the southern and eastern regions of the Mediterranean and for offshore and deep sea habitats. The eighteen initiatives vary substantially in their extent (covering 0.1–58.5% of the Mediterranean Sea) and in the location of additional proposed conservation and management areas. Differences in the criteria, approaches and data used explain such variation. Despite the diversity among proposals, our analyses identified ten areas, encompassing 10% of the Mediterranean Sea, that are consistently identified among the existing proposals, with an additional 10% selected by at least five proposals. These areas represent top priorities for immediate conservation action. Despite the plethora of initiatives, major challenges face Mediterranean biodiversity and conservation. These include the need for spatial prioritization within a comprehensive framework for regional conservation planning, the acquisition of additional information from data-poor areas, species or habitats, and addressing the challenges of establishing transboundary governance and collaboration in socially, culturally and politically complex conditions. Collective prioritised action, not new conservation plans, is needed for the north, western, and high seas of the Mediterranean, while developing initial information-based plans for the south and eastern Mediterranean is an urgent requirement for true regional conservation planning."
https://openalex.org/W2044266876,"A selection of 21 rice cultivars (Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica and japonica) was characterized under moderate long-term drought stress by comprehensive physiological analyses and determination of the contents of polyamines and selected metabolites directly related to polyamine metabolism. To investigate the potential regulation of polyamine biosynthesis at the transcriptional level, the expression of 21 genes encoding enzymes involved in these pathways were analyzed by qRT-PCR. Analysis of the genomic loci revealed that 11 of these genes were located in drought-related QTL regions, in agreement with a proposed role of polyamine metabolism in rice drought tolerance. The cultivars differed widely in their drought tolerance and parameters such as biomass and photosynthetic quantum yield were significantly affected by drought treatment. Under optimal irrigation free putrescine was the predominant polyamine followed by free spermidine and spermine. When exposed to drought putrescine levels decreased markedly and spermine became predominant in all cultivars. There were no correlations between polyamine contents and drought tolerance. GC-MS analysis revealed drought-induced changes of the levels of ornithine/arginine (substrate), substrates of polyamine synthesis, proline, product of a competing pathway and GABA, a potential degradation product. Gene expression analysis indicated that ADC-dependent polyamine biosynthesis responded much more strongly to drought than the ODC-dependent pathway. Nevertheless the fold change in transcript abundance of ODC1 under drought stress was linearly correlated with the drought tolerance of the cultivars. Combining metabolite and gene expression data, we propose a model of the coordinate adjustment of polyamine biosynthesis for the accumulation of spermine under drought conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2119974977,"Introduction We describe temporal trends in the mortality rates and factors associated with AIDS and non-AIDS related mortality at the Evandro Chagas Clinical Research Institute (IPEC), Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (FIOCRUZ). Methods Adult patients enrolling from 1986 through 2009 with a minimum follow up of 60 days were included. Vital status was exhaustively checked using patients’ medical charts, through active contact with individuals and family members and by linkage with the Rio de Janeiro Mortality database using a previously validated algorithm. The CoDe protocol was used to establish the cause of death. Extended Cox proportional hazards models were used for multivariate modeling. Results A total of 3530 individuals met the inclusion criteria, out of which 868 (24.6%) deceased; median follow up per patient was 3.9 years (interquartile range 1.7–9.2 years). The dramatic decrease in the overall mortality rates was driven by AIDS-related causes that decreased from 9.19 deaths/100PYs n 1986–1991 to 1.35/100PYs in 2007–2009. Non-AIDS related mortality rates remained stable overtime, at around 1 death/100PYs. Immunodeficiency significantly increased the hazard of both AIDS-related and non-AIDS-related causes of death, while HAART use was strongly associated with a lower hazard of death from either cause. Conclusions Our results confirm the remarkable decrease in AIDS-related mortality as the HIV epidemic evolved and alerts to the conditions not traditionally related to HIV/AIDS which are now becoming more frequent, needing careful monitoring."
https://openalex.org/W2140116636,"Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) is a cytosolic enzyme whose inhibition has beneficial effects in cardiovascular, inflammatory, and metabolic diseases in murine models. Mice with targeted deletion or pharmacological inhibition of sEH exhibit improved insulin signaling in liver and adipose tissue. Herein, we assessed the role of sEH in regulating endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in liver and adipose tissue. We report that sEH expression was increased in the livers and adipose tissue of mice fed a high fat diet, the adipose tissue of overweight humans, and palmitate-treated cells. Importantly, sEH deficiency or inhibition in mice attenuated chronic high fat diet-induced ER stress in liver and adipose tissue. Similarly, pharmacological inhibition of sEH in HepG2 cells and 3T3-L1 adipocytes mitigated chemical-induced ER stress and activation of JNK, p38, and cell death. In addition, insulin signaling was enhanced in HepG2 cells treated with sEH substrates and attenuated in cells treated with sEH products. In summary, these findings demonstrate that sEH is a physiological modulator of ER stress and a potential target for mitigating complications associated with obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2026528484,"Dietary prevention strategies are increasingly recognized as essential to combat the current epidemic of obesity and related metabolic disorders. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the potential prebiotic effects of indigestible carbohydrates in Swedish brown beans (Phaseolus vulgaris var. nanus) in relation to cardiometabolic risk markers and appetite regulating hormones.Brown beans, or white wheat bread (WWB, reference product) were provided as evening meals to 16 healthy young adults in a randomised crossover design. Glucose, insulin, appetite regulatory hormones, GLP-1, GLP-2, appetite sensations, and markers of inflammation were measured at a following standardised breakfast, that is at 11 to 14 h post the evening meals. Additionally, colonic fermentation activity was estimated from measurement of plasma short chain fatty acids (SCFA, including also branched chain fatty acids) and breath hydrogen (H2) excretion.An evening meal of brown beans, in comparison with WWB, lowered blood glucose (-15%, p<0.01)- and insulin (-16%, p<0.05) responses, increased satiety hormones (PYY 51%, p<0.001), suppressed hunger hormones (ghrelin -14%, p<0.05), and hunger sensations (-15%, p = 0.05), increased GLP-2 concentrations (8.4%, p<0.05) and suppressed inflammatory markers (IL-6 -35%, and IL-18 -8.3%, p<0.05) at a subsequent standardised breakfast. Breath H2 (141%, p<0.01), propionate (16%, p<0.05), and isobutyrate (18%, P<0.001) were significantly increased after brown beans compared to after WWB, indicating a higher colonic fermentative activity after brown beans.An evening meal with brown beans beneficially affected important measures of cardiometabolic risk and appetite regulatory hormones, within a time frame of 11-14 h, in comparison to a WWB evening meal. Concentrations of plasma SCFA and H2 were increased, indicating involvement of colonic fermentation. Indigestible colonic substrates from brown beans may provide a preventive tool in relation to obesity and the metabolic syndrome.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01706042."
https://openalex.org/W2013773215,"It is important to understand the mechanisms that regulate macrophage activation to establish novel therapies for inflammatory diseases, such as sepsis; a systemic inflammatory response syndrome generally caused by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In this study, we investigated the involvement of extracellular ATP-mediated autocrine signaling in LPS-induced macrophage activation. We show here that ATP release via exocytosis, followed by activation of P2Y11 receptor, is a major pathway of the macrophage activation, leading to release of cytokines. Treatment of human monocyte THP-1 cells with LPS induced rapid ATP release from cells, and this release was blocked by knockdown of SLC17A9 (vesicular nucleotide transporter, VNUT), which is responsible for exocytosis of ATP. ATP-enriched vesicles were found in cytosol of THP-1 cells. These data suggest the involvement of vesicular exocytosis in the release of ATP. Knockdown of SLC17A9, the P2Y11 antagonist NF157 or knockdown of P2Y11 receptor significantly suppressed both M1-type polarization and IL-6 production in THP-1 cells, indicating an important role of activation of P2Y11 receptor by released ATP in macrophage activation. Next, the effect of NF157 on LPS-induced immune activation was examined in vivo. Administration of LPS to mice caused increase of serum IL-1ß, IL-6, IL-12 and TNF-alpha levels at 3-24 h after the administration. Pre-treatment of LPS-treated mice with NF157 suppressed both elevation of proinflammatory cytokines in serum and M1 polarization of peritoneal/spleen macrophages. Moreover, post-treatment with NF157 at 30 min after administration of LPS also suppressed the elevation of serum cytokines levels. We conclude that vesicular exocytosis of ATP and autocrine, positive feedback through P2Y11 receptors is required for the effective activation of macrophages. Consequently, P2Y11 receptor antagonists may be drug candidates for treatment of inflammatory diseases such as sepsis."
https://openalex.org/W1968252650,"Background Today, there are more than a hundred times as many sequenced prokaryotic genomes than were present in the year 2000. The economical sequencing of genomic DNA has facilitated a whole new approach to microbial genomics. The real power of genomics is manifested through comparative genomics that can reveal strain specific characteristics, diversity within species and many other aspects. However, comparative genomics is a field not easily entered into by scientists with few computational skills. The CMG-biotools package is designed for microbiologists with limited knowledge of computational analysis and can be used to perform a number of analyses and comparisons of genomic data. Results The CMG-biotools system presents a stand-alone interface for comparative microbial genomics. The package is a customized operating system, based on Xubuntu 10.10, available through the open source Ubuntu project. The system can be installed on a virtual computer, allowing the user to run the system alongside any other operating system. Source codes for all programs are provided under GNU license, which makes it possible to transfer the programs to other systems if so desired. We here demonstrate the package by comparing and analyzing the diversity within the class Negativicutes, represented by 31 genomes including 10 genera. The analyses include 16S rRNA phylogeny, basic DNA and codon statistics, proteome comparisons using BLAST and graphical analyses of DNA structures. Conclusion This paper shows the strength and diverse use of the CMG-biotools system. The system can be installed on a vide range of host operating systems and utilizes as much of the host computer as desired. It allows the user to compare multiple genomes, from various sources using standardized data formats and intuitive visualizations of results. The examples presented here clearly shows that users with limited computational experience can perform complicated analysis without much training."
https://openalex.org/W2022597857,"We present a general, robust, and efficient ray-casting-based approach to triangulating complex manifold surfaces arising in the nano-bioscience field. This feature is inserted in a more extended framework that: i) builds the molecular surface of nanometric systems according to several existing definitions, ii) can import external meshes, iii) performs accurate surface area estimation, iv) performs volume estimation, cavity detection, and conditional volume filling, and v) can color the points of a grid according to their locations with respect to the given surface. We implemented our methods in the publicly available NanoShaper software suite (www.electrostaticszone.eu). Robustness is achieved using the CGAL library and an ad hoc ray-casting technique. Our approach can deal with any manifold surface (including nonmolecular ones). Those explicitly treated here are the Connolly-Richards (SES), the Skin, and the Gaussian surfaces. Test results indicate that it is robust to rotation, scale, and atom displacement. This last aspect is evidenced by cavity detection of the highly symmetric structure of fullerene, which fails when attempted by MSMS and has problems in EDTSurf. In terms of timings, NanoShaper builds the Skin surface three times faster than the single threaded version in Lindow et al. on a 100,000 atoms protein and triangulates it at least ten times more rapidly than the Kruithof algorithm. NanoShaper was integrated with the DelPhi Poisson-Boltzmann equation solver. Its SES grid coloring outperformed the DelPhi counterpart. To test the viability of our method on large systems, we chose one of the biggest molecular structures in the Protein Data Bank, namely the 1VSZ entry, which corresponds to the human adenovirus (180,000 atoms after Hydrogen addition). We were able to triangulate the corresponding SES and Skin surfaces (6.2 and 7.0 million triangles, respectively, at a scale of 2 grids per Å) on a middle-range workstation."
https://openalex.org/W1993169857,"Legumain-based DNA vaccines have potential to protect against breast cancer. However, the lack of a safe and efficient oral delivery system restricts its clinical application. Here, we constructed alginic acid-coated chitosan nanoparticles (A.C.NPs) as an oral delivery carrier for a legumain DNA vaccine. First, we tested its characteristic in acidic environments in vitro. DNA agarose electrophoresis data show that A.C.NPs protected DNA better from degradation in acidic solution (pH 1.5) than did chitosan nanoparticles (C.NPs). Furthermore, size distribution analysis showed that A.C.NPs tended to aggregate and form micrometer scale complexes in pH<2.7, while dispersing into nanoparticles with an increase in pH. Mice were intragastrically administrated A.C.NPs carrying EGFP plasmids and EGFP expression was detected in the intestinal Peyer's patches. Full-length legumain plasmids were loaded into different delivery carriers, including C.NPs, attenuated Salmonella typhimurium and A.C.NPs. A.C.NPs loaded with empty plasmids served as a control. Oral vaccination was performed in the murine orthotopic 4T1 breast cancer model. Our data indicate that tumor volume was significantly smaller in groups using A.C.NPs or attenuated Salmonella typhimurium as carriers. Furthermore, splenocytes co-cultured them with 4T1 cells pre-stimulated with CoCl2, which influenced the translocation of legumain from cytoplasm to plasma membrane, showed a 4.7 and 2.3 folds increase in active cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD3(+)/CD8(+)/CD25(+)) when treated with A.C.NPs carriers compared with PBS C.NPs. Our study suggests that C.NPs coated with alginic acid may be a safe and efficient tool for oral delivery of a DNA vaccine. Moreover, a legumain DNA vaccine delivered orally with A.C.NPs can effectively improve autoimmune response and protect against breast cancer in mice."
https://openalex.org/W1974227053,"The optic flow generated when a person moves through the environment can be locally decomposed into several basic components, including radial, circular, translational and spiral motion. Since their analysis plays an important part in the visual perception and control of locomotion and posture it is likely that some brain regions in the primate dorsal visual pathway are specialized to distinguish among them. The aim of this study is to explore the sensitivity to different types of egomotion-compatible visual stimulations in the human motion-sensitive regions of the brain. Event-related fMRI experiments, 3D motion and wide-field stimulation, functional localizers and brain mapping methods were used to study the sensitivity of six distinct motion areas (V6, MT, MST+, V3A, CSv and an Intra-Parietal Sulcus motion [IPSmot] region) to different types of optic flow stimuli. Results show that only areas V6, MST+ and IPSmot are specialized in distinguishing among the various types of flow patterns, with a high response for the translational flow which was maximum in V6 and IPSmot and less marked in MST+. Given that during egomotion the translational optic flow conveys differential information about the near and far external objects, areas V6 and IPSmot likely process visual egomotion signals to extract information about the relative distance of objects with respect to the observer. Since area V6 is also involved in distinguishing object-motion from self-motion, it could provide information about location in space of moving and static objects during self-motion, particularly in a dynamically unstable environment."

Here we report the results of a high-coverage whole genome sequencing study for 44 unrelated healthy Caucasian adults, each sequenced to over 50-fold coverage (averaging 65.8×). We identified approximately 11 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 2.8 million short insertions and deletions, and over 500,000 block substitutions. We showed that, although previous studies, including the 1000 Genomes Project Phase 1 study, have catalogued the vast majority of common SNPs, many of the low-frequency and rare variants remain undiscovered. For instance, approximately 1.4 million SNPs and 1.3 million short indels that we found were novel to both the dbSNP and the 1000 Genomes Project Phase 1 data sets, and the majority of which (∼96%) have a minor allele frequency less than 5%. On average, each individual genome carried ∼3.3 million SNPs and ∼492,000 indels/block substitutions, including approximately 179 variants that were predicted to cause loss of function of the gene products. Moreover, each individual genome carried an average of 44 such loss-of-function variants in a homozygous state, which would completely ""knock out"" the corresponding genes. Across all the 44 genomes, a total of 182 genes were ""knocked-out"" in at least one individual genome, among which 46 genes were ""knocked out"" in over 30% of our samples, suggesting that a number of genes are commonly ""knocked-out"" in general populations. Gene ontology analysis suggested that these commonly ""knocked-out"" genes are enriched in biological process related to antigen processing and immune response. Our results contribute towards a comprehensive characterization of human genomic variation, especially for less-common and rare variants, and provide an invaluable resource for future genetic studies of human variation and diseases."

The objective of this study was to evaluate the quality of an international cohort of CPGs that provide recommendations on pharmaceutical management of glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2).We searched the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC) on February 15th and June 4th, 2012 for CPGs meeting inclusion criteria. Two independent assessors rated the quality of each CPG using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research & Evaluation II (AGREE II) instrument. Twenty-four guidelines were evaluated, and most had high scores for clarity and presentation. However, scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement, rigor of development, and applicability domains varied considerably. The majority of guidelines scored low on editorial independence, and only seven CPGs were based on an underlying systematic review of the evidence.The overall quality of CPGs for glycemic control in DM2 is moderate, but there is substantial variability among quality domains within and across guidelines. Guideline users need to be aware of this variability and carefully appraise and select the guidelines that they apply to patient care."
https://openalex.org/W2019315793,"Background The extensional signals in cross-talk between stromal cells and tumor cells generated from extracellular matrix molecules, soluble factor, and cell-cell adhesion complexes cooperate at the extra- and intracellular level in the tumor microenvironment. CAFs are the primary type of stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment and play a pivotal role in tumorigenesis and development. Hitherto, there is hardly any systematic analysis of the intrinsic relationship between CAFs function and its abnormal signaling pathway. The extreme complexity of CAFs’ features and their role in tumor development are needed to be further investigated. Methodology/Principal Findings We primary cultured CAFs and NFs from early stages of breast cancer tissue and identified them using their biomarker by immunohistochemistry for Fibronectin, α-SMA and FAP. Microarray was applied to analyze gene expression profiles of human breast CAFs and the paired NFs. The Up-regulated genes classified by Gene Ontology, signal pathways enriched by DAVID pathway analysis. Abnormal signaling pathways in breast cancer CAFs are involved in cell cycle, cell adhesion, signal transduction and protein transport being reported in CAFs derived from other tumors. Significantly, the altered ATM signaling pathway, a set of cell cycle regulated signaling, and immune associated signaling are identified to be changed in CAFs. Conclusions/Significance CAFs have the vigorous ability of proliferation and potential of invasion and migration comparing with NFs. CAFs could promote breast cancer cell invasion under co-culture conditions through up-regulated CCL18 and CXCL12. Consistently with its biologic behavior, the gene expression profiling analyzed by microarray shows that some of key signaling pathways, such as cell cycle, cell adhesion, and secreting factors play an important role in CAFs. The altered ATM signaling pathway is abnormally active in the early stage of breast cancer. The set of immune associated signaling may be involved in tumor cell immune evasion."

Needle-free delivery of DNA using a CO2-powered Biojector® device was compared to delivery by needle and syringe and evaluated for safety and immunogenicity.Forty adults, 18-50 years, were randomly assigned to intramuscular (IM) vaccinations with DNA vaccine, VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP, (weeks 0, 4, 8) by Biojector® 2000™ or needle and syringe (N/S) and boosted IM at week 24 with VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP (rAd5) with N/S at 10(10) or 10(11) particle units (PU). Equal numbers per assigned schedule had low (≤500) or high (>500) reciprocal titers of preexisting Ad5 neutralizing antibody.120 DNA and 39 rAd5 injections were given; 36 subjects completed follow-up research sample collections. IFN-γ ELISpot response rates were 17/19 (89%) for Biojector® and 13/17 (76%) for N/S delivery at Week 28 (4 weeks post rAd5 boost). The magnitude of ELISpot response was about 3-fold higher in Biojector® compared to N/S groups. Similar effects on response rates and magnitude were observed for CD8+, but not CD4+ T-cell responses by ICS. Env-specific antibody responses were about 10-fold higher in Biojector-primed subjects.DNA vaccination by Biojector® was well-tolerated and compared to needle injection, primed for greater IFN-γ ELISpot, CD8+ T-cell, and antibody responses after rAd5 boosting.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00109629."
https://openalex.org/W2025853415,"In eukaryotes, the combinatorial usage of cis-regulatory elements enables the assembly of composite genetic switches to integrate multifarious, convergent signals within a single promoter. Plants as sessile organisms, incapable of seeking for optimal conditions, rely on the use of this resource to adapt to changing environments. Emerging evidence suggests that the transcriptional responses of plants to stress are associated with epigenetic processes that govern chromatin accessibility. However, the extent at which specific chromatin modifications contribute to gene regulation has not been assessed.In the present work, we combined methyl-sensitive-cut counting and RNA-seq to follow the transcriptional and epigenetic response of plants to simulated drought. Comprehensive genome wide evidence supports the notion that the methylome is widely reactive to water potential. The predominant changes in methylomes were loci in the promoters of genes encoding for proteins suited to cope with the environmental challenge.These selective changes in the methylome with corresponding changes in gene transcription suggest drought sets in motion an instructive mechanism guiding epigenetic machinery toward specific effectors genes."
https://openalex.org/W1972040261,"Pyruvate kinase isoform M2 (PKM2) is an enzyme-catalyzing conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate in the glycolysis pathway. It was demonstrated that PKM2 interacts with tyrosine phosphopeptide, and the interaction with the tyrosine phosphopeptide affects the pyruvate kinase activity of PKM2. Our experiments suggest that PKM2 is also an active protein kinase (Gao, X., Wang, H., Yang, J. J., Liu, X., and Liu, Z. R. (2012) Mol. Cell 45, 598-609). We report here that growth signals reciprocally regulate the pyruvate kinase and protein kinase activities of PKM2 by different mechanisms. On the one hand, growth signals induce protein tyrosine phosphorylations. The tyrosine-phosphorylated protein(s) regulates the conversion of pyruvate kinase and protein kinase of PKM2 by directly interacting with PKM2. Binding of the tyrosyl-phosphorylated proteins at the fructose 1,6-bisphosphate-binding site converts the tetrameric PKM2 to a dimer. On the other hand, growth stimulations also lead to PKM2 phosphorylation, which consequently regulates the conversion of protein kinase and pyruvate kinase activities. Growth factor stimulations significantly increase the dimer/tetramer PKM2 ratio in cells and consequently activate the protein kinase activity of PKM2. Our study suggests that the conversion between the pyruvate kinase and protein kinase activities of PKM2 may be an important mechanism mediating the effects of growth signals in promoting cell proliferation."

The goal of this project was to examine the performance of Multiplex arrays for measuring multiple protein biomarkers in saliva and serum. Specimens from the OsteoPerio ancillary study of the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study were used. Participants required the presence of at least 6 teeth and were excluded based on active cancer and certain bone issues but were not selected on any specific condition. Quality control (QC) samples were created from pooled serum and saliva. Twenty protein markers were measured on five multiplexing array panels. Sample pretreatment conditions were optimized for each panel. Recovery, lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) and imprecision were determined for each analyte. Statistical adjustment at the plate level was used to reduce imprecision estimates and increase the number of usable observations. Sample pre-treatment improved recovery estimates for many analytes. The LLOQ for each analyte agreed with manufacturer specifications except for MMP-1 and MMP-2 which were significantly higher than reported. Following batch adjustment, 17 of 20 biomarkers in serum and 9 of 20 biomarkers in saliva demonstrated acceptable precision, defined as <20% coefficient of variation (<25% at LLOQ). The percentage of cohort samples having levels within the reportable range for each analyte varied from 10% to 100%. The ratio of levels in saliva to serum varied from 1∶100 to 28∶1. Correlations between saliva and serum were of moderate positive magnitude and significant for CRP, MMP-2, insulin, adiponectin, GM-CSF and IL-5. Multiplex arrays exhibit high levels of analytical imprecision, particularly at the batch level. Careful sample pre-treatment can enhance recovery and reduce imprecision. Following statistical adjustments to reduce batch effects, we identified biomarkers that are of acceptable quality in serum and to a lesser degree in saliva using Multiplex arrays."

Cole equation is a special case of our generalized class of models for Previous bioimpedance data analyses of living systems using basic Cole and serial Cole models show significant imprecisions. Our new class of models considerably improves the quality of fitting, evaluated by mean square errors, for bioimpedance data obtained from human skin. Our models with new parameters presented in specific partial sum of Maclaurin series also extend representation, understanding and description of complex systems electrical properties in terms of remnant memory effects."
https://openalex.org/W1988194389,"We attempt to evaluate the nature of association of TCF7L2 gene variants with T2DM, for the first time in the population of Hyderabad, which is considered to be diabetic capital of India. It is a case-control study of the three SNPs of TCF7L2, rs7903146, rs12255372 and rs11196205, genotyped on Sequenom Massarray platform, in a sample of 758 patients and 621 controls. The risk allele frequency of the three SNPs was found to be significantly higher in the T2DM cases than controls, implicating susceptibility for diabetes (p<0.01). The greatest risk of developing the disease was conferred by rs7903146. Further, the logistic regression of genotypes of each SNP under log additive model, and the haplotypes constituted by at least one of the three risk alleles also show significantly greater risk of developing T2DM when compared to the wild type haplotype. Further, BMI and WHR emerge as significant covariates with confounding effects. The strong association of the TCF7L2 SNPs with T2DM is consistent with the findings among other Indian and Non-Indian populations, suggesting universal phenomena of its association across ethnic groups globally, both within and outside the Indian subcontinent, albeit the functional relevance of these SNPs needs yet to be established."
https://openalex.org/W1965517002,"Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U-like 1 (hnRPUL1) -also known as adenovirus early region 1B-associated proteins 5 (E1B-AP5) - plays a role in RNA metabolism. Recently, hnRPUL1 has also been shown to be involved in DNA damage response, but the function of hnRPUL1 in response to DNA damage remains unclear. Here, we have demonstrated that hnRPUL1 is associated with PARP1 and recruited to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) sites in a PARP1-mediated poly (ADP-ribosyl) ation dependent manner. In turn, hnRPUL1 knockdown enhances the recruitment of PARP1 to DSBs sites. Specifically, we showed that hnRPUL1 is also implicated in the transcriptional regulation of PARP1 gene. Thus, we propose hnRPUL1 as a new component related to PARP1 in DNA damage response and repair."
https://openalex.org/W2016467723,"Cytoplasmic dynein and dynactin participate in retrograde transport of organelles, checkpoint signaling and cell division. The principal subunits that mediate this interaction are the dynein intermediate chain (IC) and the dynactin p150Glued; however, the interface and mechanism that regulates this interaction remains poorly defined. Herein, we use multiple methods to show the N-terminus of mammalian dynein IC, residues 10–44, is sufficient for binding p150Glued. Consistent with this mapping, monoclonal antibodies that antagonize the dynein-dynactin interaction also bind to this region of the IC. Furthermore, double and triple alanine point mutations spanning residues 6 to 19 in the yeast IC homolog, Pac11, produce significant defects in spindle positioning. Using the same methods we show residues 381 to 530 of p150Glued form a minimal fragment that binds to the dynein IC. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments indicate that these individual fragments are predominantly monomeric, but admixtures of the IC and p150Glued fragments produce a 2:2 complex. This tetrameric complex is sensitive to salt, temperature and pH, suggesting that the binding is dominated by electrostatic interactions. Finally, circular dichroism (CD) experiments indicate that the N-terminus of the IC is disordered and becomes ordered upon binding p150Glued. Taken together, the data indicate that the dynein-dynactin interaction proceeds through a disorder-to-order transition, leveraging its bivalent-bivalent character to form a high affinity, but readily reversible interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1984847530,"What are the commonalities between genes, whose expression level is partially controlled by eQTL, especially with regard to biological functions? Moreover, how are these genes related to a phenotype of interest? These issues are particularly difficult to address when the genome annotation is incomplete, as is the case for mammalian species. Moreover, the direct link between gene expression and a phenotype of interest may be weak, and thus difficult to handle. In this framework, the use of a co-expression network has proven useful: it is a robust approach for modeling a complex system of genetic regulations, and to infer knowledge for yet unknown genes. In this article, a case study was conducted with a mammalian species. It showed that the use of a co-expression network based on partial correlation, combined with a relevant clustering of nodes, leads to an enrichment of biological functions of around 83%. Moreover, the use of a spatial statistics approach allowed us to superimpose additional information related to a phenotype; this lead to highlighting specific genes or gene clusters that are related to the network structure and the phenotype. Three main results are worth noting: first, key genes were highlighted as a potential focus for forthcoming biological experiments; second, a set of biological functions, which support a list of genes under partial eQTL control, was set up by an overview of the global structure of the gene expression network; third, pH was found correlated with gene clusters, and then with related biological functions, as a result of a spatial analysis of the network topology."
https://openalex.org/W2060585119,"The cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) has been implicated in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). PrP(C) decreases amyloid-β (Aβ) production, which is involved in AD pathogenesis, by inhibiting β-secretase (BACE1) activity. Contactin 5 (CNTN5) has also been implicated in the development of AD by a genome-wide association study. Here we measured PrP(C) and CNTN5 in frontal cortex samples from 24 sporadic AD and 24 age-matched control brains and correlated the expression of these proteins with markers of AD. PrP(C) was decreased in sporadic AD compared to controls (by 49%, p = 0.014) but there was no difference in CNTN5 between sporadic AD and controls (p = 0.217). PrP(C) significantly inversely correlated with BACE1 activity (rs = -0.358, p = 0.006), Aβ load (rs = -0.456, p = 0.001), soluble Aβ (rs = -0.283, p = 0.026) and insoluble Aβ (rs = -0.353, p = 0.007) and PrP(C) also significantly inversely correlated with the stage of disease, as indicated by Braak tangle stage (rs = -0.377, p = 0.007). CNTN5 did not correlate with Aβ load (rs = 0.040, p = 0.393), soluble Aβ (rs = 0.113, p = 0.223) or insoluble Aβ (rs = 0.169, p = 0.125). PrP(C) was also measured in frontal cortex samples from 9 Down's syndrome (DS) and 8 age-matched control brains. In contrast to sporadic AD, there was no difference in PrP(C) in the DS brains compared to controls (p = 0.625). These data are consistent with a role for PrP(C) in regulating Aβ production and indicate that brain PrP(C) level may be important in influencing the onset and progression of sporadic AD."

Out of 23 patients with the autologous melanocyte transplantation, 12 patients (52.17%) had an excellent re-pigmentation, 6 patients (26.09%) had a good re-pigmentation, 5 patients (21.74%) had a fair or poor re-pigmentation. CD8+ T cells infiltrating was observed in the perilesional vitiligo area of all patients. Importantly, the efficiency of the transplantation was closely associated with skin-homing CD8+ T cell activities. The patients with high number of perilesional CD8+ T cells or high level of cytokines/chemokines were associated with poor re-pigmentation efficiency. For in-vitro experiments, we successfully isolated and characterized human DMSCs and skin-homing CD8+ T cells. We established DMSCs and CD8+ T cell co-culture system, where DMSCs possessed significant inhibitory effects against skin homing CD8+ T lymphocytes. DMSCs inhibited CD8+ T cells proliferation, induced them apoptosis and regulated their cytokines/chemokines production. Our results suggest that vitiligo patients’ autologous melanocytes transplantation efficiency might be predicted by perilesional skin-homing CD8+ T cell activities, and DMSCs might be used as auxiliary agent to improve transplantation efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W2009568203,"Conservation management of wild fish may include fish health management in sympatric populations of domesticated fish in aquaculture. We developed a mathematical model for the population dynamics of parasitic sea lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) on domesticated populations of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in the Broughton Archipelago region of British Columbia. The model was fit to a seven-year dataset of monthly sea louse counts on farms in the area to estimate population growth rates in relation to abiotic factors (temperature and salinity), local host density (measured as cohort surface area), and the use of a parasiticide, emamectin benzoate, on farms. We then used the model to evaluate management scenarios in relation to policy guidelines that seek to keep motile louse abundance below an average three per farmed salmon during the March–June juvenile wild Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) migration. Abiotic factors mediated the duration of effectiveness of parasiticide treatments, and results suggest treatment of farmed salmon conducted in January or early February minimized average louse abundance per farmed salmon during the juvenile wild salmon migration. Adapting the management of parasites on farmed salmon according to migrations of wild salmon may therefore provide a precautionary approach to conserving wild salmon populations in salmon farming regions."
https://openalex.org/W1970275325,"The identification of interactions between drugs and target proteins plays a key role in genomic drug discovery. In the present study, the quantitative binding affinities of drug-target pairs are differentiated as a measurement to define whether a drug interacts with a protein or not, and then a chemogenomics framework using an unbiased set of general integrated features and random forest (RF) is employed to construct a predictive model which can accurately classify drug-target pairs. The predictability of the model is further investigated and validated by several independent validation sets. The built model is used to predict drug-target associations, some of which were confirmed by comparing experimental data from public biological resources. A drug-target interaction network with high confidence drug-target pairs was also reconstructed. This network provides further insight for the action of drugs and targets. Finally, a web-based server called PreDPI-Ki was developed to predict drug-target interactions for drug discovery. In addition to providing a high-confidence list of drug-target associations for subsequent experimental investigation guidance, these results also contribute to the understanding of drug-target interactions. We can also see that quantitative information of drug-target associations could greatly promote the development of more accurate models.

https://openalex.org/W1971539376,"Psychiatric manifestations after occurrence of epilepsy have often been noted. However, the association between newly diagnosed epilepsy and psychiatric disorders afterward is not completely understood. We conducted two longitudinal cohorts for patients with and without epilepsy to investigate the risk factors and hazard ratios of developing psychiatric disorders after patients were newly diagnosed with epilepsy.We identified 938 patients with a new diagnosis of epilepsy and 518,748 participants without epilepsy from the National Health Insurance Research Database in 2000-2002 and tracked them until 2008. We compared the incidence of developing psychiatric disorders between the two cohorts, evaluated risk factors and measured the associated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of developing psychiatric disorders.The incidences of psychiatric disorders for people with and without epilepsy were 94.1 and 22.6 per 1000 person-years, respectively. After adjusting the covariates, the epilepsy cohort showed the highest risks in mental retardation (HR 31.5, 95% CI 18.9 to 52.4), bipolar disorder (HR 23.5, 95% CI 11.4 to 48.3) and alcohol or drug psychosis (HR 18.8, 95% CI 11.1 to 31.8) among psychiatric complications developed after newly diagnosed epilepsy. The risk increased with epileptic general seizure and frequency of outpatient visits for epilepsy, as well as with emergency room visits and hospitalizations for epilepsy, and with older age. Chronologically, the highest risk occurred in the first year after epilepsy diagnosis (HR 11.4, 95% CI 9.88 to 13.2).Various psychiatric disorders were demonstrated after newly diagnosed epilepsy and closely related to general seizure and use of medical services for epilepsy. This shows a need for integrated psychiatric care for patients newly diagnosed with epilepsy, especially in the first year."
https://openalex.org/W2055568101,"Bird song plays an important role in the establishment and maintenance of prezygotic reproductive barriers. When two closely related species come into secondary contact, song convergence caused by acquisition of heterospecific songs into the birds’ repertoires is often observed. The proximate mechanisms responsible for such mixed singing, and its effect on the speciation process, are poorly understood. We used a combination of genetic and bioacoustic analyses to test whether mixed singing observed in the secondary contact zone of two passerine birds, the Thrush Nightingale (Luscinia luscinia) and the Common Nightingale (L. megarhynchos), is caused by introgressive hybridization. We analysed song recordings of both species from allopatric and sympatric populations together with genotype data from one mitochondrial and seven nuclear loci. Semi-automated comparisons of our recordings with an extensive catalogue of Common Nightingale song types confirmed that most of the analysed sympatric Thrush Nightingale males were ‘mixed singers’ that use heterospecific song types in their repertoires. None of these ‘mixed singers’ possessed any alleles introgressed from the Common Nightingale, suggesting that they were not backcross hybrids. We also analysed songs of five individuals with intermediate phenotype, which were identified as F1 hybrids between the Thrush Nightingale female and the Common Nightingale male by genetic analysis. Songs of three of these hybrids corresponded to the paternal species (Common Nightingale) but the remaining two sung a mixed song. Our results suggest that although hybridization might increase the tendency for learning songs from both parental species, interspecific cultural transmission is the major proximate mechanism explaining the occurrence of mixed singers among the sympatric Thrush Nightingales. We also provide evidence that mixed singing does not substantially increase the rate of interspecific hybridization and discuss the possible adaptive value of this phenomenon in nightingales."

https://openalex.org/W1990794013,"Periodontal disease affects about 80% of adults in America, and is characterized by oral bacterial infection-induced gingival inflammation, oral bone resorption, and tooth loss. Periodontitis is also associated with other diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, and heart disease. Although many efforts have been made to develop effective therapies for this disease, none have been very effective and there is still an urgent need for better treatments and preventative strategies. Herein we explored for the first time the possibility that adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated RNAi knockdown could be used to treat periodontal disease with improved efficacy. For this purpose, we used AAV-mediated RNAi knockdown of Atp6i/TIRC7 gene expression to target bone resorption and gingival inflammation simultaneously. Mice were infected with the oral pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis W50 (P. gingivalis) in the maxillary periodontium to induce periodontitis. We found that Atp6i depletion impaired extracellular acidification and osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. Furthermore, local injection of AAV-shRNA-Atp6i/TIRC7 into the periodontal tissues in vivo protected mice from P. gingivalis infection-stimulated bone resorption by >85% and decreased the T-cell number in periodontal tissues. Notably, AAV-mediated Atp6i/TIRC7 knockdown also reduced the expression of osteoclast marker genes and inflammation-induced cytokine genes. Atp6i+/− mice with haploinsufficiency were similarly protected from P. gingivalis infection-stimulated bone loss and gingival inflammation. This suggests that AAV-shRNA-Atp6i/TIRC7 therapeutic treatment may significantly improve the health of millions who suffer from P. gingivalis-mediated periodontal disease."

New treatment modalities minimizing the risk of hypoglycemic episodes and attenuating hypoglycemic cognitive dysfunction are needed. We studied if treatment with the neuroprotective hormone erythropoietin (EPO) enhances cognitive function during hypoglycemia. Materials and Methods Eleven patients with type 1 diabetes, hypoglycemia unawareness and recurrent severe hypoglycemia completed the study. In a double-blind, randomized, balanced, cross-over study using clamped hypoglycemia they were treated with 40,000 IU of EPO or placebo administered intravenously six days before the two experiments. Cognitive function (primary endpoint), hypoglycemic symptoms, and counter-regulatory hormonal response were recorded. Results Compared with placebo, EPO treatment was associated with a significant reduction in errors in the most complex reaction time task (−4.7 (−8.1 to −1.3), p = 0.01) and a less reaction time prolongation (−66 (−117 to −16) msec, p = 0.02). EPO treatment did not change performance in other measures of cognition. Hypoglycemic symptoms, EEG-changes, and counter-regulatory hormone concentrations did not differ between EPO and placebo treatment. Conclusion In patients with type 1 diabetes and hypoglycemia unawareness, treatment with EPO is associated with a beneficial effect on cognitive function in a complex reaction time task assessing sustained attention/working memory. Hypoglycemic symptoms and hormonal responses were not changed by EPO treatment. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00615368"

Current treatments include combination opioid and adjuvant therapies, but no guidelines are available for dose escalation strategies. This phase II study compared the efficacy and tolerability of two dose escalation strategies for oxycodone and pregabalin combination therapy. Methods Patients (N = 75) with oncological neuropathic pain, previously untreated with pregabalin, were recruited in 5 Italian institutions between 2007 and 2010. Patients were randomised to two different dose escalation strategies (arm A; N = 38) oxycodone at a fixed dose with increasing pregabalin doses; (arm B; N = 37) pregabalin at a fixed dose with increasing oxycodone doses. Patients were evaluated from daily diaries and follow-ups at 3, 7, 10, and 14 days after beginning treatment with a numerical rating scale (NRS), neuropathic pain scale (SDN), and well-being scale (ESAS). The primary endpoint was a ≥1/3 reduction in pain (NRS); secondary endpoints included the time to analgesia and adverse effects. The study had a 90% probability of detecting the best strategy for a true difference of at least 15%. Results More patients in arm A (76%) than arm B (64%) achieved ≥1/3 overall pain reduction even after controlling for baseline factors (gender, baseline pain). Group A reported fewer side effects than group B; constipation 52.8% vs. 66.7%; nausea: 27.8% vs. 44.4%; drowsiness: 44.4% vs. 55.6%; confusion: 16.7% vs. 27.8%; itching: 8.3% vs. 19.4%. Conclusions Both strategies effectively controlled neuropathic pain, but according to the adopted selection design arm A is preferable to arm B for pain control.

The application of quantum dots in numerous biomedical areas requires detailed studies on their toxicity. In this study, we aimed to determine the threshold dose which reduced or eliminated CdTe-induced toxicity in L929 cells by controlling the exposure dose. We established a cellular model of acute exposure to CdTe QDs. Cells were exposed to different concentrations of CdTe QDs (2.2 nm and 3.5 nm) followed by illustrative cytotoxicity analysis. The results showed that low concentrations of CdTe QDs (under 10 µg/mL) promoted cell viability, caused no obvious effect on the rate of cell apoptosis, intracellular calcium levels and changes in mitochondrial membrane potential, while high concentrations significantly inhibited cell viability. In addition, reactive oxygen species in the 10 µg/mL-treated group was significantly reduced compared with the control group. In summary, the cytotoxicity of CdTe QDs on L929 cell is dose-dependent, time-dependent and size-dependent. Low concentrations of CdTe QDs (below 10 µg/mL) may be nontoxic and safe in L929 cells, whereas high concentrations (above 10 µg/mL) may be toxic resulting in inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis in L929 cells."

The profile of ionic concentrations across the border zone play a significant role in determining cellular electrophysiology and conductivity, yet their spatial-temporal evolution and regulation are not well understood. To investigate the changes in ion concentrations that regulate cellular electrophysiology, a mathematical model of ion movement in the intra and extracellular space in the presence of ionic, potential and material property heterogeneities was developed. The model simulates the spatial and temporal evolution of concentrations of potassium, sodium, chloride, calcium, hydrogen and bicarbonate ions and carbon dioxide across an ischemic border zone. Ischemia was simulated by sodium-potassium pump inhibition, potassium channel activation and respiratory and metabolic acidosis. The model predicted significant disparities in the width of the border zone for each ionic species, with intracellular sodium and extracellular potassium having discordant gradients, facilitating multiple gradients in cellular properties across the border zone. Extracellular potassium was found to have the largest border zone and this was attributed to the voltage dependence of the potassium channels. The model also predicted the efflux of from the ischemic region due to electrogenic drift and diffusion within the intra and extracellular space, respectively, which contributed to depletion in the ischemic region."

https://openalex.org/W2055207960,"Introduction The Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) genome contains four ORFs, S (surface), P (polymerase), C (core) and X. S is completely overlapped by P and as a consequence the overlapping region is subject to distinctive evolutionary constraints compared to the remainder of the genome. Specifically, a non-synonymous substitution in one coding frame may produce a synonymous substitution in the alternative frame, suggesting a possible conflict between requirements for diversifying and purifying forces. To examine how these contrasting requirements are balanced within this region, we investigated the relationship amongst positive selection sites, conserved regions, epitopes and elements of protein structure to consider how HBV balances the contrasting evolutionary pressures. Methodology/Results 323 HBV genotype D genome sequences were collected and analyzed to identify sites under positive selection and highly conserved regions. Epitopes sequences were retrieved from previously published experimental studies stored in the Immune Epitope Database. Predicted secondary structures were used to investigate the association between structure and conservation. Entropy was used as a measure of conservation and bivariate logistic regression was used to investigate the relationship between positive selection/conserved sites and epitope/secondary structure regions. Our results indicate: (i) conservation in S is primarily dictated by α-helix elements in the protein structure, (ii) variable residues are mainly located in PreS, the major hydrophilic region (MHR) and the C-terminus, (iii) epitopes in S, which are directly targeted by the host immune system, are significantly associated with sites under positive selection. Conclusions The highly variable spacer domain in P, which corresponds to PreS in S, appears to act as a harbor for the accumulation of mutations that can provide flexibility for conformational changes and responding to immune pressure."
https://openalex.org/W2085307143,"Maintenance of embryonic stem cell (ESC) self-renewal and pluripotency are controlled by extrinsic factors, molecular signaling pathways and transcriptional regulators. While many of the key players have been studied in depth, how the molecular signals interact with transcription factors of the pluripotency network to regulate their action remains less well understood. Inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (Gsk-3) has been implicated in the maintenance of mouse ESC pluripotency, although there is contradictory data on its role, with enhancement of cell survival and metabolism, stabilisation of c-Myc and activation of Wnt signalling proposed as potential mechanisms. We have discovered that suppression of Gsk-3 activity leads to enhanced protein levels of key transcriptional regulators of the pluripotency network, notably Nanog, Tbx3 and c-Myc. Protein stability was unchanged following Gsk-3 inhibition, although interestingly, Nanog and Tbx3 proteins were found to have half-lives of 1-3 h, while that of Oct4 protein was longer, at 6 h. We demonstrate that the effects on protein levels seen following inhibition of Gsk-3 are due to both enhanced de novo synthesis of Nanog protein and increases in the proportion of Nanog and Tbx3 RNAs bound to polysomes, findings consistent with Gsk-3 regulating translation of these factors. These effects were not due to changes in regulators of general translation initiation machinery nor mediated via the 5' or 3' UTR sequences of Nanog alone. The data we present provide both new conceptual insight into the mechanisms regulated by Gsk-3 that may contribute to ESC self-renewal and, importantly, establish control of protein translation as an additional mechanism involved in modulation of ESC pluripotency."
https://openalex.org/W2019072231,"The Aerides-Vanda alliance is a complex group in the subtribe Aeridinae (subfamily Epidendroideae, Orchidaceae). Some phylogenetic systems of this alliance have been previously proposed based on molecular and morphological analyses. However, several taxonomic problems within this alliance as well as between it and its allies remain unsolved.We utilized ITS and five plastid DNA regions in this phylogenetic analysis. Consensus trees strongly indicate that the Aerides-Vanda alliance is monophyletic, and the 14 genera of this alliance can be grouped into the following clades with 14 subclades: 1. Aerides, comprising two subclades: Rhynchostylis and Aerides; 2. Ascocentropsis; 3. Papilionanthe; 4. Vanda, comprising five subclades: Neofinetia, Christensonia, Seidenfadenia, Ascocentrum, and Vanda-Trudelia, in which Vanda and Trudelia form a subclade; 5. Tsiorchis, comprising three subclades: Chenorchis, Tsiorchis, and two species of Ascocentrum; 6. Paraholcoglossum; and 7. Holcoglossum. Among the 14 genera, only Ascocentrum is triphyletic: two species of the Ascocentrum subclade, an independent subclade Ascocentrum subclade in the Tsiorchis clade; the Ascocentrum subclade in the Vanda clade; and one species in the Holcoglossum clade. The Vanda and Trudelia species belong to the same subclade. The molecular conclusion is consistent with their morphological characteristics.We elucidate the relationship among the 14 genera of the Aerides-Vanda alliance. Our phylogenetic results reveal that the Aerides-Vanda alliance is monophyletic, but it can be divided into 14 genera. The data prove that Ascocentrum is triphyletic. Plants with elongate-terete leaves and small flowers should be treated as a new genus, Pendulorchis. Saccolabium himalaicum (Ascocentrum himalaicum) should be transferred to Pendulorchis. Ascocentrum pumilum, endemic to Taiwan, should be transferred to Holcoglossum. A new combination, Holcoglossum pumilum, was also established. Trudelia should not be recognized as an independent genus. Two new species, Pendulorchis gaoligongensis and Holcoglossum singchianum, were described as well."
https://openalex.org/W2101094027,"Most bacterial strains, which have been studied so far for their probiotic functions, are extensively used by manufacturers in developed countries. In our work, we sought to study a mix (called BSL) comprising three strains belonging to Lactobacillus fermentum, L. paraplantarum and L. salivarius, that were isolated from a traditional African pearl millet based fermented slurry. Our objective was to study this BSL cocktail in gnotobiotic rats, to evaluate their survival and their behavior in the digestive tract conditions. After a single oral inoculation of germfree rats with BSL, the species established stably in the digestive tract with the following hierarchy of abundance: L. salivarius> L. plantarum> L. fermentum. BSL cocktail was metabolically active since it produced 50 mM lactate and it expressed genes involved in binding mechanism in the caecum. Furthermore, the global morphology of the colon epithelium was not disturbed by the BSL cocktail. BSL cocktail did not modify mucus content and host mucus-related genes (MUC1, MUC2, MUC3 or resistin-like molecule β). The cocktail of lactobacilli enhanced the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) at a level comparable to what was observed in conventional rats. PCNA was involved in proliferation and DNA repair, but the presence of the cocktail did not provoke proliferative events (with Ki67 as indicator), so we suppose BSL may help gut preservation. This work is the first step towards the selection of strains that are derived from traditional fermented food to formulate new probiotic mixture."
https://openalex.org/W2141743762,"Objective To determine whether advocacy targeted at local politicians leads to action to reduce the risk of pedestrian injury in deprived areas. Design Cluster randomised controlled trial. Setting 239 electoral wards in 57 local authorities in England and Wales. Participants 617 elected local politicians. Interventions Intervention group politicians were provided with tailored information packs, including maps of casualty sites, numbers injured and a synopsis of effective interventions. Main outcome measures 25–30 months post intervention, primary outcomes included: electoral ward level: percentage of road traffic calmed; proportion with new interventions; school level: percentage with 20 mph zones, Safe Routes to School, pedestrian training or road safety education; politician level: percentage lobbying for safety measures. Secondary outcomes included politicians’ interest and involvement in injury prevention, and facilitators and barriers to implementation. Results Primary outcomes did not significantly differ: % difference in traffic calming (0.07, 95%CI: −0.07 to 0.20); proportion of schools with 20 mph zones (RR 1.47, 95%CI: 0.93 to 2.32), Safe Routes to School (RR 1.34, 95%CI: 0.83 to 2.17), pedestrian training (RR 1.23, 95%CI: 0.95 to 1.61) or other safety education (RR 1.16, 95%CI: 0.97 to 1.39). Intervention group politicians reported greater interest in child injury prevention (RR 1.09, 95%CI 1.03 to 1.16), belief in potential to help prevent injuries (RR 1.36, 95%CI 1.16 to 1.61), particularly pedestrian safety (RR 1.55, 95%CI 1.19 to 2.03). 63% of intervention politicians reported supporting new pedestrian safety schemes. The majority found the advocacy information surprising, interesting, effectively presented, and could identify suitable local interventions. Conclusions This study demonstrates the feasibility of an innovative approach to translational public health by targeting local politicians in a randomised controlled trial. The intervention package was positively viewed and raised interest but changes in interventions were not statistically significance. Longer term supported advocacy may be needed.

https://openalex.org/W2028242385,"There are many Green Fluorescent Proteins (GFPs) originating from diverse species that are invaluable to cell biologists today because of their ability to provide experimental visualization of protein expression. Since their initial discovery, they have been modified and improved to provide more stable variants with emission ranges spanning a wide array of colors. Due to their ease of expression both in-vitro and in-vivo, they are an attractive choice for use as markers in molecular biology. GFPs are generally assumed to have negligible effects on the cells to which they have been introduced. However, a growing number of reports indicate that this is not always the case. Consequently, because of GFP's ubiquitous use, it is important to document the nature and extent of unintended effects. In this report, we find that GFP affects T cell activation, leading to defects in clustering, upregulation of the activation marker CD25 and IL-2 cytokine production following stimulation in human primary T cells that also express TurboGFP. We utilized a reporter assay which has been routinely used to assay the NF-κB pathway and found reduced NF-κB activitation in stimulated HEK293 and HeLa cells that were co-transfected with TurboGFP, suggesting that GFP interferes with signaling through the NF-κB pathway. These findings indicate that the utilization of GFP-tagged vectors may negatively impact in vitro experiments in T cells, emphasizing the critical importance of controls to identify any GFP-induced effects."
https://openalex.org/W2084285024,"To investigate the prevalence and visual acuity (VA) outcomes of cataract surgery in adults of the Bai Nationality populations in rural China.We conducted a population-based cross-sectional survey (from randomly selected block groups) of Chinese Bai Nationality aged ≥50 years in southwestern China. Presenting visual acuity (PVA), best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were recorded and a detailed eye examination was carried out. For all aphakic and pseudophakic subjects identified, information on the date, setting, type, and complications of cataract surgery were recorded. In eyes with VA <20/63, the principal cause of visual impairment was identified.Of 2133 (77.8% of 2742) subjects, 99 people (129 eyes) had undergone cataract surgery. The prevalence of cataract surgery was 4.6%. Surgical coverage among those with PVA <20/200 in both eyes because of cataract was 52.8%. Unoperated cataract was associated with older age. The main barrier to cataract surgery was lack of awareness and knowledge, cost, and fear. Among the 129 cataract-operated eyes, 22.5% had PVA of ≥20/32, 25.6% had PVA of 20/40 to 20/63, 23.3% had PVA <20/63 to 20/200, and 28.7% had PVA<20/200. With BCVA, the percentages were 42.6%, 23.3%, 10.9%, and 23.3%, respectively. Aphakia (odds ratio [OR], 8.49; P<0.001) and no education (OR, 10.18; P = 0.001) or less education (OR, 6.49; P = 0.014) were significantly associated with postoperative visual impairment defined by PVA, while aphakia (OR, 8.49; P<0.001) and female gender (OR, 4.19; P = 0.004) were significantly associated with postoperative visual impairment by BCVA. The main causes of postoperative visual impairment were refractive error, retinal disorders and glaucoma.Half of those with bilateral visual impairment or blindness because of cataract remain in need of cataract surgery in Bai population. Surgical uptake and visual outcomes should be further improved in the future."
https://openalex.org/W1994126402,"Most behaviors are conditional upon successful navigation of the environment, which depends upon distance perception learned over repeated trials. Unfortunately, we understand little about how learning affects distance perception–especially in the most common human navigational scenario, that of adult navigation in familiar environments. Further, dominant theories predict mutually exclusive effects of learning on distance perception, especially when the risks or costs of navigation differ. We tested these competing predictions in four experiments in which we also presented evolutionarily relevant navigation costs. Methods included within- and between-subjects comparisons and longitudinal designs in laboratory and real-world settings. Data suggested that adult distance estimation rapidly reflects evolutionarily relevant navigation costs and repeated exposure does little to change this. Human distance perception may have evolved to reflect navigation costs quickly and reliably in order to provide a stable signal to other behaviors and with little regard for objective accuracy."

However, the systemic inflammatory response in patients with emphysema is still unknown.TO COMPARE THE PLASMA CYTOKINE PROFILES IN TWO GROUPS OF CURRENT OR FORMER SMOKERS WITHOUT AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION: a control group of individuals without computed tomography (CT) detected emphysema vs. a study group of individuals with CT detected emphysema.Subjects underwent a chest CT, spirometry, and determination of EGF, IL-15, IL-1ra, IL-8, MCP-1, MIP-1β, TGFα, TNFα, and VEGF levels in plasma. Cytokine levels in each group were compared adjusting for confounding factors.160 current smokers and former smokers without airway obstruction participated in the study: 80 without emphysema and 80 subjects with emphysema. Adjusted group comparisons revealed significant reductions in EGF (-0.317, p = 0.01), IL-15 (-0.21, p = 0.01), IL-8 (-0.180, p = 0.02) and IL-1ra (-0.220, p = 0.03) in subjects with emphysema and normal spirometry.Current or former smokers expressing a well-defined disease characteristic such as emphysema, has a specific plasma cytokine profile. This includes a decrease of cytokines mainly implicated in activation of apoptosis or decrease of immunosurveillance. This information should be taken into account when evaluated patients with tobacco respiratory diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2031811294,"Hepatitis B virus(HBV) infection remains a global problem, despite the effectiveness of the Hepatitis B vaccine in preventing infection. The resolution of Hepatitis B virus infection has been believed to be attributable to virus-specific immunity. In vivo direct evaluation of anti-HBV immunity in the liver is currently not possible. We have developed a new assay system that detects HBV clearance in the liver after the hydrodynamic transfer of a reporter gene and over-length, linear HBV DNA into hepatocytes, followed by bioluminescence imaging of the reporter gene (Fluc). We employed bioluminescence detection of luciferase expression in HBV-infected hepatocytes to measure the Hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg)-specific immune responses directed against these infected hepatocytes. Only HBcAg-immunized, but not mock-treated, animals decreased the amounts of luciferase expression, HBsAg and viral DNA from the liver at day 28 after hydrodynamic infection with over-length HBV DNA, indicating that control of luciferase expression correlates with viral clearance from infected hepatocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2049172743,"Cholesterol gallstone disease (CGD) is a multifactorial and multistep disease. Apart from female gender and increasing age being the documented non-modifiable risk factor for gallstones the pathobiological mechanisms underlying the phenotypic expression of CGD appear to be rather complex, and one or more variations in genes could play critical roles in the diverse pathways further progressing to cholesterol crystal formation. In the present study we performed genotyping score, Multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) and Classification and Regression Tree analysis (CART) to identify combinations of alleles among the hormonal, hepatocanalicular transporter and adipogenesis differentiation pathway genes in modifying the risk for CGD.The present case-control study recruited total of 450 subjects, including 230 CGD patients and 220 controls. We analyzed common ESR1, ESR2, PGR, ADRB3, ADRA2A, ABCG8, SLCO1B1, PPARγ2, and SREBP2 gene polymorphisms to find out combinations of genetic variants contributing to CGD risk, using multi-analytical approaches (G-score, MDR, and CART).Single locus analysis by logistic regression showed association of ESR1 IVS1-397C>T (rs2234693), IVS1-351A>G (rs9340799) PGR ins/del (rs1042838) ADRB3-190 T>C (rs4994) ABCG8 D19H (rs11887534), SLCO1B1 Exon4 C>A (rs11045819) and SREBP2 1784G>C (rs2228314) with CGD risk. However, the MDR and CART analysis revealed ESR1 IVS1-397C>T (rs2234693) ADRB3-190 T>C (rs4994) and ABCG8 D19H (rs11887534) polymorphisms as the best polymorphic signature for discriminating between cases and controls. The overall odds ratio for the applied multi-analytical approaches ranged from 4.33 to 10.05 showing an incremental risk for cholesterol crystal formation. In conclusion, our muti-analytical approach suggests that, ESR1, ADRB3, in addition to ABCG8 genetic variants confer significant risk for cholesterol gallstone disease."
