These results highlight fundamental principles of single-cell chromatin organization. An important unresolved question in eukaryotic genome biology is how chromosomes are spatially organized inside interphase nuclei. Current evidence suggests that this organization is driven by probabilistic principles (Bickmore, 2013Bickmore W.A. The spatial organization of the human genome.Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum.

Cell. 2013; 49: 773-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Systematic fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) experiments have revealed that in a homogeneous cell population the nuclear positions of chromosomes are variable with respect to each other and relative to the periphery (Bolzer et al., 2005Bolzer A. Kreth G. Solovei I. Koehler D. Saracoglu K. Fauth C. Müller S. Eils R. Cremer C. Speicher M.R. Cremer T. Three-dimensional maps of all chromosomes in human male fibroblast nuclei and prometaphase rosettes.PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e157Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). However, this positioning is not entirely random; for example, in human lymphoid cells, chromosome 18 (chr18) tends to be located near the periphery, while chr19 shows a preference for the nuclear interior (Croft et al., 1999Croft J.A. Bridger J.M. Boyle S. Perry P. Teague P. Bickmore W.A. Differences in the localization and morphology of chromosomes in the human nucleus.J.

At a smaller scale, certain individual genomic loci visualized by FISH also exhibit preferences for specific nuclear landmarks, such as the nuclear envelope (Marshall et al., 1996Marshall W.F. Dernburg A.F. Harmon B. Agard D.A. Sedat J.W. Specific interactions of chromatin with the nuclear envelope: positional determination within the nucleus in Drosophila melanogaster.Mol. Biol.

Press R.I. Centromere autoantigens are associated with the nucleolus.Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 200: 339-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), but usually with some degree of random variation. This variability is directly illustrated by in vivo tagging experiments in which loci contacting the nuclear lamina (NL) were tracked over mitosis in a clonal human cell line (Kind et al., 2013Kind J. Pagie L. Ortabozkoyun H. Boyle S. de Vries S.S. Janssen H. Amendola M. Nolen L.D. Bickmore W.A. van Steensel B. Single-cell dynamics of genome-nuclear lamina interactions.Cell. 2013; 153: 178-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). This demonstrated that a sizeable subset of loci that were associated with the NL in mother cells relocated to the nuclear interior in daughter cells, indicating that, at least to some degree, genome contacts with the NL are intrinsically variable. Complementary to these single-cell microscopy approaches are genome-wide mapping techniques that query the chromosome organization in large pools of cells (van Steensel and Dekker, 2010van Steensel B. Dekker J. Genomics tools for unraveling chromosome architecture.Nat. Biotechnol. 2010; 28: 1089-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). For example, the 4C, 5C, and Hi-C technologies generate maps of the pair-wise spatial proximity of genomic loci (de Wit and de Laat, 2012de Wit E. de Laat W.

Such maps have revealed global patterns that indicate that mammalian interphase chromosomes are partitioned into domains that are roughly 200 kb–2 Mb in size (Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009Lieberman-Aiden E. van Berkum N.L.

Another genome-wide approach to studying chromosome architecture is the mapping of interactions with the NL, mostly by means of the DamID technology (Guelen et al., 2008Guelen L. Pagie L. Brasset E.

Constitutive nuclear lamina-genome interactions are highly conserved and associated with A/T-rich sequence.Genome Res. 2013; 23: 270-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The NL provides a very large surface area for potential contacts with the genome. Indeed, DamID studies have estimated that as much as ∼35% of the mammalian genome can interact with the NL in any tested cell type, although it has remained unclear how much of the genome contacts the NL in a single cell. Genome-NL interactions occur through about 1,100–1,400 discrete lamina-associated domains (LADs), which have a median size of ∼0.5 Mb and are scattered across all chromosomes. Most genes in LADs are expressed at very low levels, and results of various tethering experiments (Finlan et al., 2008Finlan L.E. Sproul D. Thomson I. Boyle S. Kerr E. Perry P. Ylstra B. Chubb J.R.

The large size of LADs and their prevalence throughout the genome strongly suggest that LAD-NL interactions play an important role in interphase chromosome architecture. Insights into the single-cell behavior of these interactions will thus enhance our fundamental understanding of chromosome organization. Here, we report a modified version of the DamID technology that is sensitive enough to generate genome-wide maps of NL contacts in single human cells at a resolution of ∼100 kb, which is well below the median size of LADs. We generated a total of 395 of these single-cell maps. These maps, complemented by Hi-C analysis and super-resolution microscopy imaging, provide insights into the nature of LAD-NL interactions and uncover principles of cell-to-cell variation in chromosome architecture. As a model system to develop single-cell DamID, we chose the human myeloid leukemia cell line KBM7, which is haploid for all chromosomes, except for chr8 and a small part of chr15 (Kotecki et al., 1999Kotecki M.

Schischlik F. Rebsamen M. et al.A reversible gene trap collection empowers haploid genetics in human cells.Nat. Methods. 2013; 10: 965-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Even though this haploid state is unusual for human somatic cells, it facilitates the interpretation of single-cell genome-wide maps because there is no need to discriminate the homologous chromosomes that are present in diploid cells. We developed a DamID protocol for single cells as summarized in Figure 1A. We created a KBM7 clone (#14) that expresses an inducible fusion protein consisting of DNA adenine methyltransferase (Dam) and Lamin B1 (LmnB1) (Kind et al., 2013Kind J. Pagie L. Ortabozkoyun H. Boyle S. de Vries S.S. Janssen H. Amendola M. Nolen L.D. Bickmore W.A. van Steensel B.

Miyoshi H. et al.Visualizing spatiotemporal dynamics of multicellular cell-cycle progression.Cell. 2008; 132: 487-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1478) Google Scholar). We then induced Dam-LmnB1 protein expression (Figures S1A and S1B), and 15 hr later we collected single cells at the onset of the S phase by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (Figure S1C). This design ensured that the harvested cells had expressed Dam-LmnB1 for most of their recent G1 phase (which lasts on average ∼14.9 hr, an estimate based on doubling time and FACS data), providing sufficient time for the accumulation of adenine methylation on the genomic loci that contact the NL. Importantly, LmnB1 was strictly confined to the nuclear periphery before and after Dam-LmnB1 induction (Figure S1D).Figure S1Characteristics of the KBM7 #14 Dam-LmnB1 Clonal Line, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) qPCR analysis of m6A accumulation without (gray bars) or with (black bars) 15 hr Dam-LmnB1 induction.

(H) Histogram of the distribution of uniquely mappable read numbers across the 118 single-cell Dam-LmnB1 samples. The single FACS-sorted cells were captured directly in a small volume of lysis buffer in a 96-well plate. Subsequent sample processing consisted of only a few steps (Figure 1A): digestion with DpnI, which is highly specific for Dam-methylated GATC sequences, followed by adaptor ligation (Figure S1E) and a total of 26 cycles of PCR amplification. A key difference with the conventional DamID protocol is that these steps are all done in the same well by sequential addition of reagents, without intermediate purification or concentration steps that could lead to loss of DNA. Gel electrophoresis showed that approximately half of the wells yielded a clear smear of amplified DNA (Figure S1F). These PCR products were prepared for multiplexed Illumina sequencing by ligation of indexed adaptors, subsequently pooled, and sequenced. In total, we generated 118 single-cell DamID maps from KBM7 clone #14. After applying quality filters (Figure S1G), we obtained a median of 5 × 105 reads per cell that could be mapped to a unique genomic location (Figure S1H). On average, 92% of the mapped locations started with a GATC motif, which is the recognition sequence of both Dam and DpnI, indicating that the detection is highly specific. For each cell, we binned these reads in 100-kb contiguous genomic segments, and then we calculated for each segment an observed over expected (OE) score based on the number of recovered unique reads, the theoretical maximum number of mappable unique reads in the segment, and the total genome-wide read count obtained from each cell. OE scores >1 indicate more Dam-LmnB1 methylation than may be expected by random chance. Essentially, all cells showed a striking domain pattern of OE scores along most chromosomes, as illustrated for chr17 in Figures 1B and 1C. This pattern is reminiscent of the LAD profiles previously published for populations of cells. However, clear differences can be observed between individual cells (Figure 1B), often with entire megabase-sized domains missing, which is suggestive of cell-to-cell variation in NL contacts. We note that the chosen segment size of 100 kb is a compromise between resolution and noise. Because the median human LAD size is approximately 0.5 Mb (Guelen et al., 2008Guelen L. Pagie L. Brasset E. Meuleman W. Faza M.B. Talhout W. Eussen B.H. de Klein A. Wessels L. de Laat W. van Steensel B. Domain organization of human chromosomes revealed by mapping of nuclear lamina interactions.Nature. 2008; 453: 948-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar), segments of 100 kb are expected to capture most of the LAD organization. Indeed, the OE scores in adjacent segments within each of the 118 single cell samples have a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.70 ± 0.06 (mean ± SD), indicating that neighboring segments report NL interactions in a partially redundant fashion with acceptable noise levels. For reference, at 100 kb resolution our previously published Dam-LmnB1 profiles from pools of human Tig3, hESCs, and HT1080 cells (Guelen et al., 2008Guelen L. Pagie L. Brasset E. Meuleman W.

The single-cell correlation of OE scores between adjacent segments is not related to the number of reads per cell (Pearson’s correlation coefficient of 0.06, p = 0.51), indicating that the latter does not impose a limit to the quality of our data at 100 kb resolution. To further gauge the overall quality of these data, we first reconstructed a population profile by averaging the maps of the 118 single cells and then compared it to a conventional microarray-based DamID profile generated from a large pool of KBM7 cells (Figure 2A). The highly similar domain patterns and an overall Spearman rank correlation coefficient of 0.90 demonstrate that the new protocol captures the same regions of interaction as the previous well-validated protocol. However, in conventional DamID, a Dam-only control is typically included to normalize for chromatin accessibility and other potential biases (Vogel et al., 2007Vogel M.J. Peric-Hupkes D. van Steensel B. Detection of in vivo protein-DNA interactions using DamID in mammalian cells.Nat.

Domain organization of human chromosomes revealed by mapping of nuclear lamina interactions.Nature. 2008; 453: 948-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar). This normalization is not possible in single-cell DamID because the Dam-LmnB1 and Dam-only profiles cannot be obtained from the same cell. Nevertheless, we established a Dam-only and Fucci-expressing KBM7 clone and mapped the adenine methylation patterns in 26 single cells. The resulting patterns are very different from the Dam-LmnB1 profiles (Figures 2B and 2C). In general, regions that have no detectable Dam-LmnB1 signal show clear Dam-only signals; hence, these regions are not intrinsically undetectable. Conversely, regions with very high Dam-only signals generally do not show a Dam-LmnB1 signal, indicating that there is no strong bias for accessibility in our Dam-LmnB1 maps. We conclude that leaving out the Dam-only normalization is acceptable for single-cell Dam-LmnB1 profiling. Next, we performed multi-color fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with probes for six genomic loci covering a broad range of average OE scores (Figures 2D–2F). Analysis of hundreds of nuclei revealed a good correspondence between the average distance to the periphery according to FISH and the average OE scores (Spearman’s ρ = 0.94), confirming that our single-cell Dam-LmnB1 profiles provide a view of the spatial organization of the genome relative to the NL. Together these data indicate that single-cell DamID using Dam-LmnB1 generates NL interaction profiles with low noise levels, suitable resolution, acceptable bias, and with good correspondence to localization by FISH. Visual inspection of the collection of single-cell maps suggested that some regions interact more frequently with the NL than others (Figures 1B and 1C). In order to analyze this systematically, we first converted the OE scores for each cell to a binary NL contact map. For this, we used an OE score cutoff of 1, motivated by the bimodal distribution of OE scores (Figure S2A) that suggests that loci are either in"
https://openalex.org/W2220034225,"Tamoxifen, an estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist, is the mainstay treatment of breast cancer and the development of resistance represents a major obstacle for a cure. Although long non-coding RNAs such as HOTAIR have been implicated in breast tumorigenesis, their roles in chemotherapy resistance remain largely unknown. In this study, we report that HOTAIR (HOX antisense intergenic RNA) is upregulated in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer tissues compared to their primary counterparts. Mechanistically, HOTAIR is a direct target of ER-mediated transcriptional repression and is thus restored upon the blockade of ER signaling, either by hormone deprivation or by tamoxifen treatment. Interestingly, this elevated HOTAIR increases ER protein level and thus enhances ER occupancy on the chromatin and potentiates its downstream gene regulation. HOTAIR overexpression is sufficient to activate the ER transcriptional program even under hormone-deprived conditions. Functionally, we found that HOTAIR overexpression increases breast cancer cell proliferation, whereas its depletion significantly impairs cell survival and abolishes tamoxifen-resistant cell growth. In conclusion, the long non-coding RNA HOTAIR is directly repressed by ER and its upregulation promotes ligand-independent ER activities and contributes to tamoxifen resistance."
https://openalex.org/W1612634664,"Antiangiogenic therapy resistance occurs frequently in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The purpose of this study was to understand the mechanism of resistance to sunitinib, an antiangiogenic small molecule, and to exploit this mechanism therapeutically. We hypothesized that sunitinib-induced upregulation of the prometastatic MET and AXL receptors is associated with resistance to sunitinib and with more aggressive tumor behavior. In the present study, tissue microarrays containing sunitinib-treated and untreated RCC tissues were stained with MET and AXL antibodies. The low malignant RCC cell line 786-O was chronically treated with sunitinib and assayed for AXL, MET, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) protein expression and activation. Co-culture experiments were used to examine the effect of sunitinib pretreatment on endothelial cell growth. The effects of AXL and MET were evaluated in various cell-based models by short hairpin RNA or inhibition by cabozantinib, the multi-tyrosine kinases inhibitor that targets vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, MET and AXL. Xenograft mouse models tested the ability of cabozantinib to rescue sunitinib resistance. We demonstrated that increased AXL and MET expression was associated with inferior clinical outcome in patients. Chronic sunitinib treatment of RCC cell lines activated both AXL and MET, induced EMT-associated gene expression changes, including upregulation of Snail and β-catenin, and increased cell migration and invasion. Pretreatment with sunitinib enhanced angiogenesis in 786-0/human umbilical vein endothelial cell co-culture models. The suppression of AXL or MET expression and the inhibition of AXL and MET activation using cabozantinib both impaired chronic sunitinib treatment-induced prometastatic behavior in cell culture and rescued acquired resistance to sunitinib in xenograft models. In summary, chronic sunitinib treatment induces the activation of AXL and MET signaling and promotes prometastatic behavior and angiogenesis. The inhibition of AXL and MET activity may overcome resistance induced by prolonged sunitinib therapy in metastatic RCC."
https://openalex.org/W2119867435,"cis-regulatory changes play a central role in morphological divergence, yet the regulatory principles underlying emergence of human traits remain poorly understood. Here, we use epigenomic profiling from human and chimpanzee cranial neural crest cells to systematically and quantitatively annotate divergence of craniofacial cis-regulatory landscapes. Epigenomic divergence is often attributable to genetic variation within TF motifs at orthologous enhancers, with a novel motif being most predictive of activity biases. We explore properties of this cis-regulatory change, revealing the role of particular retroelements, uncovering broad clusters of species-biased enhancers near genes associated with human facial variation, and demonstrating that cis-regulatory divergence is linked to quantitative expression differences of crucial neural crest regulators. Our work provides a wealth of candidates for future evolutionary studies and demonstrates the value of ""cellular anthropology,"" a strategy of using in-vitro-derived embryonic cell types to elucidate both fundamental and evolving mechanisms underlying morphological variation in higher primates."
https://openalex.org/W1868707796,"Matthew Robinson and colleagues report an analysis of population genetic differences in human height and body mass index (BMI) across 14 European populations. They estimate the proportion of additive genetic variance attributable to population genetic differences and find evidence for selection increasing height while reducing BMI in European nations. Across-nation differences in the mean values for complex traits are common1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, but the reasons for these differences are unknown. Here we find that many independent loci contribute to population genetic differences in height and body mass index (BMI) in 9,416 individuals across 14 European countries. Using discovery data on over 250,000 individuals and unbiased effect size estimates from 17,500 sibling pairs, we estimate that 24% (95% credible interval (CI) = 9%, 41%) and 8% (95% CI = 4%, 16%) of the captured additive genetic variance for height and BMI, respectively, reflect population genetic differences. Population genetic divergence differed significantly from that in a null model (height, P < 3.94 × 10−8; BMI, P < 5.95 × 10−4), and we find an among-population genetic correlation for tall and slender individuals (r = −0.80, 95% CI = −0.95, −0.60), consistent with correlated selection for both phenotypes. Observed differences in height among populations reflected the predicted genetic means (r = 0.51; P < 0.001), but environmental differences across Europe masked genetic differentiation for BMI (P < 0.58)."

https://openalex.org/W1846100490,"Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) repress the expression of exogenous proviruses and endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). Here, we systematically dissected the cellular factors involved in provirus repression in embryonic carcinomas (ECs) and ESCs by a genome-wide siRNA screen. Histone chaperones (Chaf1a/b), sumoylation factors (Sumo2/Ube2i/Sae1/Uba2/Senp6), and chromatin modifiers (Trim28/Eset/Atf7ip) are key determinants that establish provirus silencing. RNA-seq analysis uncovered the roles of Chaf1a/b and sumoylation modifiers in the repression of ERVs. ChIP-seq analysis demonstrates direct recruitment of Chaf1a and Sumo2 to ERVs. Chaf1a reinforces transcriptional repression via its interaction with members of the NuRD complex (Kdm1a, Hdac1/2) and Eset, while Sumo2 orchestrates the provirus repressive function of the canonical Zfp809/Trim28/Eset machinery by sumoylation of Trim28. Our study reports a genome-wide atlas of functional nodes that mediate proviral silencing in ESCs and illuminates the comprehensive, interconnected, and multi-layered genetic and epigenetic mechanisms by which ESCs repress retroviruses within the genome."
https://openalex.org/W1884568409,"Dopamine (DA) neurons are thought to facilitate learning by signaling reward prediction errors (RPEs), the discrepancy between actual and expected reward. However, how RPEs are calculated remains unknown. It has been hypothesized that DA neurons receive RPE signals from the lateral habenula. Here, we tested how lesions of the habenular complex affect the response of optogenetically identified DA neurons in mice. We found that lesions impaired specific aspects of RPE signaling in DA neurons. The inhibitory responses caused by reward omission were greatly diminished while inhibitory responses to aversive stimuli, such as air puff-predictive cues or air puff, remained unimpaired. Furthermore, we found that after habenula lesions, DA neurons' ability to signal graded levels of positive RPEs became unreliable, yet significant excitatory responses still remained. These results demonstrate that the habenula plays a critical role in DA RPE signaling but suggest that it is not the exclusive source of RPE signals."
https://openalex.org/W2175412058,"The tumor microenvironment (TME) exerts critical pro-tumorigenic effects through cytokines and growth factors that support cancer cell proliferation, survival, motility and invasion. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) stimulate colorectal cancer development and progression via cell autonomous and microenvironmental effects. Using a unique inhibitor, NT157, which targets both IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) and STAT3, we show that these pathways regulate many TME functions associated with sporadic colonic tumorigenesis in CPC-APC mice, in which cancer development is driven by loss of the Apc tumor suppressor gene. NT157 causes a substantial reduction in tumor burden by affecting cancer cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) and myeloid cells. Decreased cancer cell proliferation and increased apoptosis were accompanied by inhibition of CAF activation and decreased inflammation. Furthermore, NT157 inhibited expression of pro-tumorigenic cytokines, chemokines and growth factors, including IL-6, IL-11 and IL-23 as well as CCL2, CCL5, CXCL7, CXCL5, ICAM1 and TGFβ; decreased cancer cell migratory activity and reduced their proliferation in the liver.

https://openalex.org/W1896598709,"We report sequencing-based whole-genome association analyses to evaluate the impact of rare and founder variants on stature in 6,307 individuals on the island of Sardinia. We identify two variants with large effects. One variant, which introduces a stop codon in the GHR gene, is relatively frequent in Sardinia (0.87% versus <0.01% elsewhere) and in the homozygous state causes Laron syndrome involving short stature. We find that this variant reduces height in heterozygotes by an average of 4.2 cm (-0.64 s.d.). The other variant, in the imprinted KCNQ1 gene (minor allele frequency (MAF) = 7.7% in Sardinia versus <1% elsewhere) reduces height by an average of 1.83 cm (-0.31 s.d.) when maternally inherited. Additionally, polygenic scores indicate that known height-decreasing alleles are at systematically higher frequencies in Sardinians than would be expected by genetic drift. The findings are consistent with selection for shorter stature in Sardinia and a suggestive human example of the proposed 'island effect' reducing the size of large mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2337184316,"Glioblastoma are malignant highly vascularized brain tumours, which feature large oedema resulting from tumour-promoted vascular leakage. The pro-permeability factor Semaphorin3A (Sema3A) produced within glioblastoma has been linked to the loss of endothelial barrier integrity. Here, we report that extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by patient-derived glioblastoma cells disrupt the endothelial barrier. EVs expressed Sema3A at their surface, which accounted for in vitro elevation of brain endothelial permeability and in vivo vascular permeability, in both skin and brain vasculature. Blocking Sema3A or its receptor Neuropilin1 (NRP1) hampered EV-mediated permeability. In vivo models using ectopically and orthotopically xenografted mice revealed that Sema3A-containing EVs were efficiently detected in the blood stream. In keeping with this idea, sera from glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients also contain high levels of Sema3A carried in the EV fraction that enhanced vascular permeability, in a Sema3A/NRP1-dependent manner. Our results suggest that EV-delivered Sema3A orchestrates loss of barrier integrity in glioblastoma and may be of interest for prognostic purposes."
https://openalex.org/W2219079964,"Gankyrin is a regulatory subunit of the 26kD proteasome complex. As a novel oncoprotein, gankyrin is expressed aberrantly in cancers from several different sites and has been shown to contribute to oncogenesis in endometrial and cervical carcinomas. Neither gankyrin’s contribution to the development of epithelial ovarian cancer nor its interaction with follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)-driven proliferation in ovarian cancer has been studied. Here we have found that gankyrin is overexpressed in ovarian cancers compared with benign ovarian cystadenomas and that gankyrin regulates FSH upregulation of cyclin D1. Importantly, gankyrin regulates PI3K/AKT signaling by downregulating PTEN. Prolonged AKT activation by FSH stimulation of the FSH receptor (FSHR) promotes gankyrin expression, which, in turn, enhances AKT activation by inhibiting PTEN. Overexpression of gankyrin decreases hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) protein levels, but has little effect on HIF-1α mRNA levels, which could be attributed to gankyrin mediating HIF-1α protein stability via the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway. Reduction in HIF-1α protein stability led to attenuation of the binding with cyclin D1 promoter, resulted in abolishment of the negative regulation of cyclin D1 by HIF-1α, which promotes proliferation of ovarian cancer cells. Our results document that gankyrin regulates HIF-1α protein stability and cyclin D1 expression, ultimately mediating FSH-driven ovarian cancer cell proliferation."

GHS-R1a signals through Gq, Gi/o, G13, and arrestin. Biasing GHS-R1a signaling with specific ligands may lead to the development of more selective drugs to treat obesity or addiction with minimal side effects. To delineate ligand selectivity at GHS-R1a signaling, we analyzed in detail the efficacy of a panel of synthetic ligands activating the different pathways associated with GHS-R1a in HEK293T cells. Besides β-arrestin2 recruitment and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, we monitored activation of a large panel of G protein subtypes using a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer-based assay with G protein-activation biosensors. We first found that unlike full agonists, Gq partial agonists were unable to trigger β-arrestin2 recruitment and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Using G protein-activation biosensors, we then demonstrated that ghrelin promoted activation of Gq, Gi1, Gi2, Gi3, Goa, Gob, and G13 but not Gs and G12. Besides, we identified some GHS-R1a ligands that preferentially activated Gq and antagonized ghrelin-mediated Gi/Go activation. Finally, we unambiguously demonstrated that in addition to Gq, GHS-R1a also promoted constitutive activation of G13. Importantly, we identified some ligands that were selective inverse agonists toward Gq but not of G13.

Smith R.G. The growth hormone secretagogue receptor.Vitamins Hormones. 2008; 77: 47-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Because of its possible implication in several physiological disorders such as obesity and drug and alcohol addiction, GHS-R1a represents a major target for the development of therapeutic molecules (6Callaghan B. Furness J.B. Novel and conventional receptors for ghrelin, desacyl-ghrelin, and pharmacologically related compounds.Pharmacol. Rev. 2014; 66: 984-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). So far, several academic laboratories and pharmaceutical companies have developed synthetic molecules that display agonist, antagonist, and inverse agonist properties toward GHS-R1a intracellular signaling pathways. Some of these molecules display interesting properties with regard to food intake stimulation or inhibition (7Moulin A. Ryan J. Martinez J. Fehrentz J.A.

The role of ghrelin in GH secretion and GH disorders.Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2011; 340: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Given the pleiotropic actions of ghrelin, GHS-R1a synthetic ligands can be useful to block or activate the targeted physiological effect but can also lead to undesirable side effects. For instance, synthetic GHS-R1a antagonists that decrease food intake and fat storage may be good candidates to treat obesity but could have side effects due to their inhibitory action on growth hormone secretion. In a different way, agonists developed with the goal to stimulate hormone secretion for treating postmenopausal osteoporosis may have adverse effects by increasing body weight (13Murphy M.G. Weiss S. McClung M. Schnitzer T. Cerchio K. Connor J. Krupa D. Gertz B.J.

Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 1116-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Therefore, development of biased ligands that will selectively inhibit or activate only one or a subset of the GHS-R1a-dependent physiological responses could have significant therapeutic advantages. This aim is certainly now attainable because during the last decade many independent studies on GPCRs have described biased agonists that are selective of a given downstream signaling pathway (14Kenakin T. Functional selectivity and biased receptor signaling.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2011; 336: 296-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 15Maudsley S. Patel S.A. Park S.S. Luttrell L.M. Martin B. Functional signaling biases in G protein-coupled receptors: game theory and receptor dynamics.Mini Rev. Med. Chem. 2012; 12: 831-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Unlike the endogenous ligand that usually activates all the G protein and β-arrestin-dependent pathways, the synthetic ligands could thus selectively activate only some of them, for instance activation of β-arrestin with no effect on G proteins (16Whalen E.J.

Although molecular mechanisms responsible for ligand-directed functional selectivity are not fully understood, there is increasing evidence that biased activity results from selective stabilization of different receptor conformations that differ in their ability to couple to different downstream effectors (17Kobilka B.K.

Importantly, in vivo studies demonstrated that side effects of classical drugs might be diminished by the use of biased molecules, suggesting this kind of molecules could have potential clinical application (16Whalen E.J.

Cell Biol. 2014; 27: 102-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). As for many other GPCRs, the rational design of biased ligands of the ghrelin receptor first requires identification of lead pathway-selective compounds. To identify such lead compounds, careful dissection of the different intracellular downstream signaling pathways of GHS-R1a is required. GHS-R1a is coupled to the Gq signaling pathway to trigger inositol phosphate production and intracellular calcium release (23Yin Y. Li Y. Zhang W. The growth hormone secretagogue receptor: its intracellular signaling and regulation.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2014; 15: 4837-4855Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In the context of Gq signaling, an interesting particularity of GHS-R1a is its exceptionally high constitutive activity. Indeed, high basal levels of inositol phosphate production were detected in GHS-R1a-transfected cell lines (24Holst B. Cygankiewicz A. Jensen T.H. Ankersen M. Schwartz T.W.

Significant ligand-independent Gq activation and AP2 recruitment were also clearly demonstrated to occur with the purified GHS-R1a inserted in a lipid disc (26Damian M. Marie J. Leyris J.P.

As with many other GPCRs, GHS-R1a activates other G protein-dependent and -independent pathways besides the Gq-associated one. Indeed, following ghrelin stimulation, GHS-R1a activates ERK1/2 through β-arrestin-dependent (27Holliday N.D. Holst B. Rodionova E.A. Schwartz T.W. Cox H.M.

In this context, we investigated here the selectivity of a panel of GHS-R1a synthetic ligands toward arrestin and G protein-dependent pathways. We paid particular attention to the selectivity of ligands toward activation of several G protein subtypes and isoforms thanks to the use of recently developed G protein BRET-based biosensors that were recently developed (31Galés C.

Inositol phosphate accumulation assay was carried out 48 h after transfection on adherent cells on a 96-well plate at a density of 50,000 cells/well. IP1 production was measured using the IP-One HTRF kit (Cisbio Bioassays Ref. 621PAPEC) as described previously (39Leyris J.P. Roux T. Trinquet E. Verdié P. Fehrentz J.A. Oueslati N. Douzon S.

An anti-IP1 antibody labeled with Lumi4-Tb (15 μl) and an IP1-d2 derivative (15 μl) were added to the cells. The medium was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Signals at 665 and 620 nm were detected using a PHERAstar (BMG LABTECH) fluorescence reader. Values are expressed as ΔF. ΔF corresponded to (ratio 665 nm/620 nm of the assay − ratio 665 nm/620 nm of the negative control)/ratio 665 nm/620 nm of the negative control. The negative control corresponded to the Lumi4-Tb blank and was used as an internal assay control. Inositol phosphate accumulation was expressed as the percentage of the maximal ghrelin response using the formula (ΔF mock cells − ΔF receptor-transfected cells)/(ΔF mock cells − ΔF maximal ghrelin stimulation for receptor-transfected cells). ERK1/2 assay was carried out 48 h after transfection on adherent cells in 96-well white plates (Greiner Bio One) at a density of 50,000 cells/well. ERK1/2 phosphorylation was measured after 10 min of stimulation with ligands using an HTRF-based phospho-ERK (Thr-202/Tyr-204) cellular assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Cisbio Bioassays). Briefly, the signal was detected between anti-phospho-ERK antibody labeled with Eu3+ cryptate donor and anti-ERK1/2 antibody labeled with d2 acceptor. Signals at 665 and 620 nm were measured using a PHERAstar (BMG Labtech) fluorescence reader. Values were expressed as ratio of 665 nm/620 nm × 1000. The interaction between GHS-R1a-YFP and Rluc-β-arrestin2 was measured in HEK293T by BRET1 in 96-well white plates (Greiner Bio-One). Briefly, cells were transfected by Lipofectamine with 100 ng of GHS-R1a-YFP and 5 ng of Rluc-β-arrestin2. 48 h after transfection, cells were washed with PBS and then incubated for 45 min at 37 °C with 50 μl of ligand in DMEM, 0.1% BSA. After stimulation, cells were washed with 100 μl of PBS. 50 μl of a 0.5 mm coelenterazine H (Interchim) solution in PBS was then added to the cells and the signal measured with a Mithras LB 940 plate reader (Berthold Biotechnologies) that allows sequential integration of luminescence signal (five cycles of 0.05 s) with two filter settings (Rluc filter, 485 ± 20 nm, and YFP filter, 530 ± 25 nm). The BRET ratio was defined as the difference of the ratio 530 nm/485 nm of the co-transfected Rluc and YFP proteins, and the ratio of the Rluc protein alone. Results are expressed in mBRET corresponding to the ratio (530 nm/485 nm) × 1000. G protein activation was measured with the BRET assay previously described (31Galés C. Van Durm J.J. Schaak S.

Briefly, HEK293T cells grown in 10-cm culture dishes were co-transfected by Lipofectamine 2000 with GHS-R1a and G protein subunits (Rluc8-α, -β1, and γ2-GF10). 48 h after transfection, cells were washed with PBS, detached with PBS containing 5 mm EDTA, and resuspended in PBS supplemented with 5 mm EDTA and 0.1% (w/v) glucose (buffer A) at room temperature. Cells were then distributed in a 96-well white plate (300,000 cells per well). For kinetic analyses, 5 μm deep blue C (coelenterazine 400a, Interchim) were added, and the plate was immediately loaded in a Mithras LB 940 multimode microplate reader (Berthold) or a PHERAstar microplate reader (BMG Labtech). Then 10 μl of ligand solution (1 μm) was injected after 30 s of reading, and the signal was recorded for 90 s. The BRET signal was obtained by calculating the ratio of GFP10 emission (515 ± 10 nm) over Rluc8 light emission (400 ± 10 nm) at 1.6-s intervals.

However, transfer of NGS technology to clinical daily practice requires validation.We validated the Ion Torrent AmpliSeq Colon and Lung cancer panel interrogating 1850 hotspots in 22 genes using the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine. First, we used commercial reference standards that carry mutations at defined allelic frequency (AF). Then, 51 colorectal adenocarcinomas (CRC) and 39 non small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC) were retrospectively analyzed.Sensitivity and accuracy for detecting variants at an AF >4% was 100% for commercial reference standards. Among the 90 cases, 89 (98.9%) were successfully sequenced. Among the 86 samples for which NGS and the reference test were both informative, 83 showed concordant results between NGS and the reference test; i.e. KRAS and BRAF for CRC and EGFR for NSCLC, with the 3 discordant cases each characterized by an AF <10%.Overall, the AmpliSeq colon/lung cancer panel was specific and sensitive for mutation analysis of gene panels and can be incorporated into clinical daily practice."
https://openalex.org/W2206432990,"Runt-related transcription factor 3 (RUNX3) is a well-documented tumour suppressor that is frequently inactivated in gastric cancer. Here, we define a novel mechanism by which RUNX3 exerts its tumour suppressor activity involving the TEAD-YAP complex, a potent positive regulator of proliferative genes. We report that the TEAD-YAP complex is not only frequently hyperactivated in liver and breast cancer, but also confers a strong oncogenic activity in gastric epithelial cells. The increased expression of TEAD-YAP in tumour tissues significantly correlates with poorer overall survival of gastric cancer patients. Strikingly, RUNX3 physically interacts with the N-terminal region of TEAD through its Runt domain. This interaction markedly reduces the DNA-binding ability of TEAD that attenuates the downstream signalling of TEAD-YAP complex. Mutation of RUNX3 at Arginine 122 to Cysteine, which was previously identified in gastric cancer, impairs the interaction between RUNX3 and TEAD. Our data reveal that RUNX3 acts as a tumour suppressor by negatively regulating the TEAD-YAP oncogenic complex in gastric carcinogenesis."

We report genome-wide association study results for the levels of A1, A2 and fetal hemoglobins, analyzed for the first time concurrently. Integrating high-density array genotyping and whole-genome sequencing in a large general population cohort from Sardinia, we detected 23 associations at 10 loci. Five signals are due to variants at previously undetected loci: MPHOSPH9, PLTP-PCIF1, ZFPM1 (FOG1), NFIX and CCND3. Among the signals at known loci, ten are new lead variants and four are new independent signals. Half of all variants also showed pleiotropic associations with different hemoglobins, which further corroborated some of the detected associations and identified features of coordinated hemoglobin species production."
https://openalex.org/W2206135107,"Accumulating evidence indicates that ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) originates from fallopian tube secretory epithelial cells (FTSECs). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the initiation and progression of HGSC derived from FTSECs remains unclear. In this study, we found that the Hippo/Yes-associated protein (YAP) signaling pathway has a critical role in the initiation and progression of fallopian tube and ovarian HGSC. Importantly, YAP was overexpressed in inflammatory and cancerous fallopian tube tissues. Further, overexpression of wild-type YAP, or constitutively active YAP in immortalized FTSECs, induced cell proliferation, migration, colony formation and tumorigenesis. Moreover, the Hippo/YAP and the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling pathways formed an autocrine/paracrine-positive feedback loop to drive the progression of the FTSEC-derived HGSC. Evidence in this study strongly suggests that combined therapy with inhibitors of YAP (such as verteporfin) and FGF receptors (such as BGJ398) can provide a novel therapeutic strategy to treat fallopian tube and ovarian HGSC."
https://openalex.org/W2343414795,"MUC4, a large transmembrane mucin normally expressed in the small and large intestine, is differentially expressed during inflammatory and malignant conditions of the colon. However, the expression pattern and the role of MUC4 in colitis and colorectal cancer (CRC) are inconclusive. Therefore, the aim of this study was to understand the role of Muc4 during inflammatory and malignant conditions of the colon. Here, we generated Muc4(-/-) mice and addressed its role in colitis and colitis-associated CRC using dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) and azoxymethane (AOM)-DSS experimental models, respectively. Muc4(-/-) mice were viable, fertile with no apparent defects. Muc4(-/-) mice displayed increased resistance to DSS-induced colitis compared with wild-type (WT) littermates that was evaluated by survival rate, body weight loss, diarrhea and fecal blood score, and histological score. Reduced infiltration of inflammatory cells, that is, CD3(+) lymphocytes and F4/80(+) macrophages was observed in the inflamed mucosa along with reduction in the mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and anti-microbial genes Lysozyme M and SLPI in the colon of Muc4(-/-) mice compared with WT littermates. Compensatory upregulation of Muc2 and Muc3 mucins under basal and DSS treatment conditions partly explains the resistance observed in Muc4(-/-) mice. Accordingly, Muc4(-/-) mice exhibited significantly reduced tumor burden compared with WT mice assessed in a colitis-induced tumor model using AOM/DSS. An increased percentage of Ki67(+) nuclei was observed in the tumors from WT compared with Muc4(-/-) mice suggesting Muc4 to be critical in intestinal cell proliferation during tumorigenesis. Taken together, we conclusively demonstrate for the first time the role of Muc4 in driving intestinal inflammation and inflammation-associated tumorigenesis using a novel Muc4(-/-) mouse model."
https://openalex.org/W2174428384,"Sepsis is a lethal and complex clinical syndrome caused by infection or suspected infection. Cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (CIRP) is a widely distributed cold-shock protein that plays a proinflammatory role in sepsis and that may induce organ damage. However, clinical studies regarding the use of CIRP for the prognostic evaluation of sepsis are lacking. The purpose of this research was to investigate the prognostic significance of peripheral blood concentrations of CIRP in sepsis. Sepsis was assessed using several common measures, including the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score; the Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score; the lactate, serum creatinine, and procalcitonin (PCT) levels; the white blood cell (WBC) count; and the neutrophil ratio (N%).Sixty-nine adult patients with sepsis were enrolled in this study. According to the mortality data from the hospital, 38 patients were survivors, and 31 were nonsurvivors. The plasma levels of the biomarkers were measured and the APACHE II and SOFA scores were calculated within 24 hours of patient enrollment into our study. The CIRP level was measured via ELISA.The plasma level of CIRP was significantly higher in the nonsurvivors than in the survivors (median (IQR) 4.99 (2.37-30.17) ng/mL and 1.68 (1.41-13.90) ng/mL, respectively; p = 0.013). The correlations of the CIRP level with the APACHE II score (r = 0.248, p = 0.040, n = 69), the SOFA score (r = 0.323, p = 0.007, n = 69), the serum creatinine level (r = 0.316, p = 0.008, n = 69), and the PCT level (r = 0.282, p = 0.019, n = 69) were significant. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that the area under the ROC curve (AUC) for the CIRP level was 0.674 (p = 0.013). According to Cox proportional hazards models, the CIRP level independently predicts sepsis mortality. When the CIRP level in the peripheral blood increased by 10 ng/mL, the mortality risk increased by 1.05-fold (p = 0.012). Thus, the CIRP level reflects the degree of renal injury but does not predict the severity of sepsis or organ damage.An elevated plasma concentration of CIRP was significantly associated with poor prognosis among patients with sepsis. Therefore, CIRP is a potential predictor of sepsis prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W2175619235,"The EphA2 receptor tyrosine kinase promotes cell migration and cancer malignancy through a ligand- and kinase-independent distinctive mechanism that has been linked to high Ser-897 phosphorylation and low tyrosine phosphorylation. Here, we demonstrate that EphA2 forms dimers in the plasma membrane of HEK293T cells in the absence of ephrin ligand binding, suggesting that the current seeding mechanism model of EphA2 activation is incomplete. We also characterize a dimerization-deficient EphA2 mutant that shows enhanced ability to promote cell migration, concomitant with increased Ser-897 phosphorylation and decreased tyrosine phosphorylation compared with EphA2 wild type. Our data reveal a correlation between unliganded dimerization and tumorigenic signaling and suggest that EphA2 pro-tumorigenic activity is mediated by the EphA2 monomer. Thus, a therapeutic strategy that aims at the stabilization of EphA2 dimers may be beneficial for the treatment of cancers linked to EphA2 overexpression."
https://openalex.org/W2174019711,"Cholesterol content can vary distinctly between normal and cancer cells, with elevated levels in cancer cells. Here, we investigated cholesterol sequestration with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MCD), and pore-formation with the ostreolysin A/pleurotolysin B (OlyA/PlyB) protein complex that binds to cholesterol/sphingomyelin-rich membrane domains. We evaluated the effects on viability of T24 invasive and RT4 noninvasive human urothelial cancer cells and normal porcine urothelial (NPU) cells. Cholesterol content strongly correlated with cancerous transformation, as highest in the T24 high-grade invasive urothelial cancer cells, and lowest in NPU cells. MCD treatment induced prominent cell death of T24 cells, whereas OlyA/PlyB treatment resulted in greatly decreased viability of the RT4 low-grade noninvasive carcinoma cells. Biochemical and transmission electron microscopy analyses revealed that MCD and OlyA/PlyB induce necrotic cell death in these cancer cells, while viability of NPU cells was not significantly affected by either treatment. We conclude that MCD is more toxic for T24 high-grade invasive urothelial cancer cells, and OlyA/PlyB for RT4 low-grade noninvasive urothelial cancer cells, and neither is toxic for NPU cells. The cholesterol and cholesterol/sphingomyelin-rich membrane domains in urothelial cancer cells thus constitute a selective therapeutic target for elimination of urothelial cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2135538422,"The IL-6 signaling complex is described as a hexamer, formed by the association of two IL-6·IL-6 receptor (IL-6R)·gp130 trimers, with gp130 being the signal transducer inducing cis- and trans-mediated signaling via a membrane-bound or soluble form of the IL-6R, respectively. 25F10 is an anti-mouse IL-6R mAb that binds to both membrane-bound IL-6R and soluble IL-6R with the unique property of specifically inhibiting trans-mediated signaling events. In this study, epitope mapping revealed that 25F10 interacts at site IIb of IL-6R but allows the binding of IL-6 to the IL-6R and the recruitment of gp130, forming a trimer complex. Binding of 25F10 to IL-6R prevented the formation of the hexameric complex obligate for trans-mediated signaling, suggesting that the cis- and trans-modes of IL-6 signaling adopt different mechanisms for receptor complex assembly. To study this phenomenon also in the human system, we developed NI-1201, a mAb that targets, in the human IL-6R sequence, the epitope recognized by 25F10 for mice. Interestingly, NI-1201, however, did not selectively inhibit human IL-6 trans-signaling, although both mAbs produced beneficial outcomes in conditions of exacerbated IL-6 as compared with a site I-directed mAb. These findings shed light on the complexity of IL-6 signaling. First, triggering cis- versus trans-mediated IL-6 signaling occurs via distinctive mechanisms for receptor complex assembly in mice. Second, the formation of the receptor complex leading to cis- and trans-signaling biology in mice and humans is different, and this should be taken into account when developing strategies to inhibit IL-6 clinically."
https://openalex.org/W2243962757,"We have recently reported that extracellular RNA (exRNA) released from necrotic cells induces cytokine production in cardiomyocytes and immune cells and contributes to myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. However, the signaling mechanism by which exRNA exhibits its pro-inflammatory effect is unknown. Here we hypothesize that exRNA directly induces inflammation through specific Toll-like receptors (TLRs). To test the hypothesis, we treated rat neonatal cardiomyocytes, mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM), or mouse neutrophils with RNA (2.5–10 μg/ml) isolated from rat cardiomyocytes or the hearts from mouse, rat, and human. We found that cellular RNA induced production of several cytokines such as macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2), ILs, TNFα, and the effect was completely diminished by RNase, but not DNase. The RNA-induced cytokine production was partially inhibited in cells treated with TLR7 antagonist or genetically deficient in TLR7. Deletion of myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MyD88), a downstream adapter of TLRs including TLR7, abolished the RNA-induced MIP-2 production. Surprisingly, genetic deletion of TLR3 had no impact on the RNA-induced MIP-2 response. Importantly, extracellular RNA released from damaged cardiomyocytes also induced cytokine production. Finally, mice treated with 50 μg of RNA intraperitoneal injection exhibited acute peritonitis as evidenced by marked neutrophil and monocyte migration into the peritoneal space. Together, these data demonstrate that exRNA of cardiac origin exhibits a potent pro-inflammatory property in vitro and in vivo and that exRNA induces cytokine production through TLR7-MyD88 signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2187758136,"RNA helicase DDX3 has oncogenic activity in breast and lung cancers and is required for translation of complex mRNA transcripts, including those encoding key cell-cycle regulatory proteins. We sought to determine the expression and function of DDX3 in sarcoma cells, and to investigate the antitumor activity of a novel small molecule DDX3 inhibitor, RK-33. Utilizing various sarcoma cell lines, xenografts and human tissue microarrays, we measured DDX3 expression at the mRNA and protein levels, and evaluated cytotoxicity of RK-33 in sarcoma cell lines. To study the role of DDX3 in Ewing sarcoma, we generated stable DDX3-knockdown Ewing sarcoma cell lines using DDX3-specific small hairpin RNA (shRNA), and assessed oncogenic activity. DDX3-knockdown and RK-33-treated Ewing sarcoma cells were compared with wild-type cells using an isobaric mass-tag quantitative proteomics approach to identify target proteins impacted by DDX3 inhibition. Overall, we found high expression of DDX3 in numerous human sarcoma subtypes compared with non-malignant mesenchymal cells, and knockdown of DDX3 by RNA interference inhibited oncogenic activity in Ewing sarcoma cells. Treatment with RK-33 was preferentially cytotoxic to sarcoma cells, including chemotherapy-resistant Ewing sarcoma stem cells, while sparing non-malignant cells. Sensitivity to RK-33 correlated with DDX3 protein expression. Growth of human Ewing sarcoma xenografts expressing high DDX3 was inhibited by RK-33 treatment in mice, without overt toxicity. DDX3 inhibition altered the Ewing sarcoma cellular proteome, especially proteins involved in DNA replication, mRNA translation and proteasome function. These data support further investigation of the role of DDX3 in sarcomas, advancement of RK-33 to Ewing sarcoma clinical trials and development of RNA helicase inhibition as a novel anti-neoplastic strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2227925477,"Targeting cell motility, which is required for dissemination and metastasis, has therapeutic potential for ovarian cancer metastasis, and regulatory mechanisms of cell motility need to be uncovered for developing novel therapeutics. Invasive ovarian cancer cells spontaneously formed protrusions, such as lamellipodia, which are required for generating locomotive force in cell motility. Short interfering RNA screening identified class II phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase C2β (PI3KC2β) as the predominant isoform of PI3K involved in lamellipodia formation of ovarian cancer cells. The bioactive sphingolipid ceramide has emerged as an antitumorigenic lipid, and treatment with short-chain C6-ceramide decreased the number of ovarian cancer cells with PI3KC2β-driven lamellipodia. Pharmacological analysis demonstrated that long-chain ceramide regenerated from C6-ceramide through the salvage/recycling pathway, at least in part, mediated the action of C6-ceramide. Mechanistically, ceramide was revealed to interact with the PIK-catalytic domain of PI3KC2β and affect its compartmentalization, thereby suppressing PI3KC2β activation and its driven cell motility. Ceramide treatment also suppressed cell motility promoted by epithelial growth factor, which is a prometastatic factor. To examine the role of ceramide in ovarian cancer metastasis, ceramide liposomes were employed and confirmed to suppress cell motility in vitro. Ceramide liposomes had an inhibitory effect on peritoneal metastasis in a murine xenograft model of human ovarian cancer. Metastasis of PI3KC2β knocked-down cells was insensitive to treatment with ceramide liposomes, suggesting specific involvement of ceramide interaction with PI3KC2β in metastasis suppression. Our study identified ceramide as a bioactive lipid that limits PI3KC2β-governed cell motility, and ceramide is proposed to serve as a metastasis-suppressor lipid in ovarian cancer. These findings could be translated into developing ceramide-based therapy for metastatic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2176762266,"Livestock ownership has the potential to improve child nutrition through various mechanisms, although direct evaluations of household livestock and child stunting status are uncommon. We conducted an analysis of Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) datasets from Ethiopia (2011), Kenya (2008–2009), and Uganda (2010) among rural children under 5 years of age to compare stunting status across levels of livestock ownership. We classified livestock ownership by summing reported household numbers of goats, sheep, cattle and chickens, as well as calculating a weighted score to combine multiple species. The primary association was assessed separately by country using a log-binomial model adjusted for wealth and region, which was then stratified by child diarrheal illness, animal-source foods intake, sub-region, and wealth index. This analysis included n = 8079 children from Ethiopia, n = 3903 children from Kenya, and n = 1645 from Uganda. A ten-fold increase in household livestock ownership had significant association with lower stunting prevalence in Ethiopia (Prevalence Ratio [PR] 0.95, 95% CI 0.92–0.98) and Uganda (PR 0.87, 95% CI 0.79–0.97), but not Kenya (PR 1.01, 95% CI 0.96–1.07). The weighted livestock score was only marginally associated with stunting status. The findings varied slightly by region, but not by wealth, diarrheal disease, or animal-source food intake. This analysis suggested a slightly beneficial effect of household livestock ownership on child stunting prevalence. The small effect size observed may be related to limitations of the DHS dataset or the potentially complicated relationship between malnutrition and livestock ownership, including livestock health and productivity."
https://openalex.org/W2344511238,"Mps1/TTK is a dual-specificity kinase, with an essential role in mitotic checkpoint signaling, which has emerged as a potential target in cancer therapy. Several Mps1/TTK small-molecule inhibitors have been described that exhibit promising activity in cell culture and xenograft models. Here, we investigated whether cancer cells can develop resistance to these drugs. To this end, we treated various cancer cell lines with sublethal concentrations of a potent Mps1/TTK inhibitor in order to isolate inhibitor-resistant monoclonal cell lines. We identified four point mutations in the catalytic domain of Mps1/TTK that gave rise to inhibitor resistance but retained wild-type catalytic activity. Interestingly, cross-resistance of the identified mutations to other Mps1/TTK inhibitors is limited. Our studies predict that Mps1/TTK inhibitor-resistant tumor cells can arise through the acquisition of mutations in the adenosine triphosphate-binding pocket of the kinase that prevent stable binding of the inhibitors. In addition, our results suggest that combinations of inhibitors could be used to prevent acquisition of drug resistance. Interestingly, cross-resistance seems nonspecific for inhibitor scaffolds, a notion that can be exploited in future drug design to evict possible resistance mutations during clinical treatment."

https://openalex.org/W2209833369,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States, and metastatic behavior is largely responsible for this mortality. Mutations in multiple 'driver' oncogenes and tumor suppressors are known to contribute to the lung tumorigenesis and in some cases represent therapeutic targets. Leucine Zipper Transcription Factor-like 1 (LZTFL1) is located in the chromosome region 3p21.3 where allelic loss and genetic alterations occur early and frequently in lung cancers. Previously, we found that LZTFL1 is downregulated in epithelial tumors, including lung cancer, and functions as a tumor suppressor in gastric cancers. However, the functional role of LZTFL1 in lung oncogenesis is undefined. We show here that downregulation of LZTFL1 expression in non-small cell lung cancer is associated with recurrence and poor survival, whereas re-expression of LZTFL1 in lung tumor cells inhibited extravasation/colonization of circulating tumor cells to the lung and inhibited tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, we found that LZTFL1 is expressed in ciliated human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) and its expression correlates with HBEC differentiation. LZTFL1 inhibits transforming growth factor β-activated mitogen-activated protein kinase and hedgehog signaling. Alteration of intracellular levels of LZTFL1 resulted in changes of expression of genes associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We conclude that LZTFL1 inhibits lung tumorigenesis, possibly by maintaining epithelial cell differentiation and/or inhibition of signalings that lead to EMT and suggest that reactivation of LZTFL1 expression in tumor cells may be a novel lung cancer therapeutic approach."

https://openalex.org/W1827676532,Intelligence relies on our ability to find appropriate sequences of decisions in complex problem spaces. The efficiency of a problem solver depends on the speed of its individual decisions and the number of decisions it can explore in parallel. It remains unknown whether the primate brain can consider multiple decisions at the same time. We therefore trained monkeys to navigate through a decision tree with stochastic sensory evidence at multiple branching points and recorded neuronal activity in visual cortical areas V1 and V4. We found a first phase of decision making in which neuronal activity increased in parallel along multiple branches of the decision tree. This was followed by an integration phase where the optimal overall strategy crystallized as the result of interactions between local decisions. The results reveal how sensory evidence is integrated efficiently for hierarchical decisions and contribute to our understanding of the brain mechanisms that implement complex mental programs.
https://openalex.org/W2245403965,"Neurotransmitter:sodium symporters (NSSs) mediate reuptake of neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft and are targets for several therapeutics and psychostimulants. The prokaryotic NSS homologue, LeuT, represents a principal structural model for Na(+)-coupled transport catalyzed by these proteins. Here, we used site-directed fluorescence quenching spectroscopy to identify in LeuT a substrate-induced conformational rearrangement at the inner gate conceivably leading to formation of a structural intermediate preceding transition to the inward-open conformation. The substrate-induced, Na(+)-dependent change required an intact primary substrate-binding site and involved increased water exposure of the cytoplasmic end of transmembrane segment 5. The findings were supported by simulations predicting disruption of an intracellular interaction network leading to a discrete rotation of transmembrane segment 5 and the adjacent intracellular loop 2. The magnitude of the spectroscopic response correlated inversely with the transport rate for different substrates, suggesting that stability of the intermediate represents an unrecognized rate-limiting barrier in the NSS transport mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2114610811,"Lateral diffusion enables efficient interactions between membrane proteins, leading to signal transmission across the plasma membrane. An open question is how the spatiotemporal distribution of cell surface receptors influences the transmembrane signaling network. Here we addressed this issue by studying the mobility of a prototypical G protein-coupled receptor, the neurokinin-1 receptor, during its different phases of cellular signaling. Attaching a single quantum dot to individual neurokinin-1 receptors enabled us to follow with high spatial and temporal resolution over long time regimes the fate of individual receptors at the plasma membrane. Single receptor trajectories revealed a very heterogeneous mobility distribution pattern with diffusion constants ranging from 0.0005 to 0.1 μm(2)/s comprising receptors freely diffusing and others confined in 100-600-nm-sized membrane domains as well as immobile receptors. A two-dimensional representation of mobility and confinement resolved two major, broadly distributed receptor populations, one showing high mobility and low lateral restriction and the other showing low mobility and high restriction. We found that about 40% of the receptors in the basal state are already confined in membrane domains and are associated with clathrin. After stimulation with an agonist, an additional 30% of receptors became further confined. Using inhibitors of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, we found that the fraction of confined receptors at the basal state depends on the quantity of membrane-associated clathrin and is correlated to a significant decrease of the canonical pathway activity of the receptors. This shows that the high plasticity of receptor mobility is of central importance for receptor homeostasis and fine regulation of receptor activity."
https://openalex.org/W2404950235,"Structural centrosome aberrations are frequently observed in early stage carcinomas, but their role in malignant transformation is poorly understood. Here, we examined the impact of overexpression of Ninein-like protein (Nlp) on the architecture of polarized epithelia in three-dimensional mammospheres. When Nlp was overexpressed to levels resembling those seen in human tumors, it formed striking centrosome-related bodies (CRBs), which sequestered Ninein and affected the kinetics of microtubule (MT) nucleation and release. In turn, the profound reorganization of the MT cytoskeleton resulted in mislocalization of several adhesion and junction proteins as well as the tumor suppressor Scribble, resulting in the disruption of epithelial polarity, cell-cell interactions and mammosphere architecture. Remarkably, cells harboring Nlp-CRBs displayed an enhanced proliferative response to epidermal growth factor. These results demonstrate that structural centrosome aberrations cause not only the disruption of epithelial polarity but also favor overproliferation, two phenotypes typically associated with human carcinomas."
https://openalex.org/W2179790758,"The viral protease represents a key drug target for the development of antiviral therapeutics. Because many protease inhibitors mimic protease substrates, differences in substrate recognition between proteases may affect their sensitivity to a given inhibitor. Here we use a cell-based FRET sensor to investigate the activity of different norovirus proteases upon cleavage of various norovirus cleavage sites inserted into a linker region separating cyan fluorescent protein and yellow fluorescent protein. Using this system, we demonstrate that differences in substrate processing exist between proteases from human noroviruses (genogroups I (GI) and II) and the commonly used murine norovirus (MNV, genogroup V) model. These altered the cleavage efficiency of specific cleavage sites both within and between genogroups. The differences observed between these proteases may affect sensitivity to protease inhibitors and the suitability of MNV as a model system for testing such molecules against the human norovirus protease. Finally, we demonstrate that replacement of MNV polyprotein cleavage sites with the GI or GII equivalents, with the exception of the NS6-7 junction, leads to the production of infectious virus when the MNV NS6 protease, but not the GI or GII proteases, are present."

The cell proliferation rate was assessed using the CellTiter 96® non-radioactive cell proliferation assay (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, Promega) according to the protocols of the manufacturer. Briefly, 10,000 cells were seeded in a well on 96-well plates (Corning) containing 100 μl of culture medium plus different concentrations of bpV(phen) and grown at 37 °C for 24 h. Then 15 μl of dye solution was added to each well, plates were incubated continuously at 37 °C for 4 h, the reaction was terminated with 100 μl of stop solution, and optical densities at 570 nm were determined. Apoptosis was evaluated using the Annexin V/FITC apoptosis detection kit. At first, cells were treated with different concentrations of bpV(phen) for 48 h and harvested by centrifugation twice at 1000 rpm (5 min for each spin). Cells were then washed twice (3 min for each wash) in binding buffer. 1 × 106 cells were resuspended in 1 ml of binding buffer containing 1.25 μl of Annexin V-FITC (BD Biosciences) and 10 μl of propidium iodide (PI), and incubated for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. Finally, cell cycle analysis was performed by flow cytometry (BD Calibar). Scatter plots were performed against the intensities of FITC fluorescence and PI fluorescence. The scatter plots were divided into four quadrants: the left lower quadrant (Annexin V-FITC (−) and PI (−)) representing viable cells, the left upper quadrant (Annexin V-FITC (−) and PI (+)) representing necrotic cells, the right lower quadrant (Annexin V-FITC (+) and PI (−)) representing early apoptotic cells, and the right upper quadrant (Annexin V-FITC (+) and PI (+)) representing late apoptotic cells. To quantify the extent of pyroptosis after bpV(phen) exposure, release of lactate dehydrogenase in cell culture supernatants was determined using the lactate dehydrogenase activity assay kit from Sigma-Aldrich according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Briefly, HeLa cells were cultured in the presence of different concentration of bpV(phen) for 48 h. Then 50 μl of cell culture supernatant was collected, added to the kit reagent, and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. After addition of stop solution, fluorescence intensity was measured using a microplate reader at an excitation wavelength of 560 nm and an emission wavelength of 590 nm. Animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, Institute of Biosciences and Technology, Texas A&M Health Science Center. All animals received humane care according to the criteria outlined in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals prepared by the National Academy of Sciences and published by the National Institutes of Health (Publication 86-23, revised 1985). Three pairs of 1-month-old, freely fed female wild-type C57BL/6 mice were subjected to subcutaneous injection of 2.5 μmol/30 g body weight in a total of 250 μl of saline (or saline only for the control group) as described previously (19Pouliot P. Camateros P. Radzioch D. Lambrecht B.N. Olivier M. Protein tyrosine phosphatases regulate asthma development in a murine asthma model.J. Immunol. 2009; 182: 1334-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To test the function of bpV(phen), we treated MEF cells with increasing concentrations of bpV(phen) for 48 h. As a PTEN inhibitor, bpV(phen) enhanced the levels of phosphorylated AKT (Fig. 1A). A dose-dependent reduction in cell population and cell viability was detected (Fig. 1, B and C). Examination of the treated cells by immunoblot revealed an even level of proliferating cell nuclear antigen and increasing levels of 89-kD PARP fragments (Fig. 1, D and E). Proliferating cell nuclear antigen is a cellular marker for proliferation. PARP is cleaved into an 89-kD fragment by the apoptosis-specific caspase 3, and levels of such fragments serve as markers of apoptosis. These data suggest that bpV(phen) exposure helps the cell maintain a constant rate of cell proliferation but an increasing rate of apoptosis so that the cell population is reduced. Cell apoptosis was further confirmed by Annexin-V flow cytometry (Fig. 1F). Pyroptosis is another type of cell death that is different from apoptosis and is characterized by the activation of caspase 1 and release of cellular contents. Treatment with bpV(phen) led to dose-dependent increases in cellular levels of active caspase 1 with a molecular weight of 10 kDa and levels of lactate dehydrogenase released in the medium (Fig. 1, G–I). Therefore, bpV(phen) induces both apoptosis and pyroptosis. Because of the close relationship between autophagy and the cell death pathways of apoptosis and pyroptosis (20Bortoluci K.R. Medzhitov R. Control of infection by pyroptosis and autophagy: role of TLR and NLR.Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2010; 67: 1643-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 21Ryter S.W. Mizumura K. Choi A.M. The impact of autophagy on cell death modalities.Int. J. Cell Biol. 2014; 2014502676Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), we examined the impact of bpV(phen) on autophagy. We injected freely fed wild-type mice with bpV(phen) and collected liver tissues for autophagy analysis. We found that bpV(phen) induced a significant increase in the levels of LC3-II (Fig. 2, A and B), suggesting either an activation of autophagy initiation or an inhibition of autophagosomal degradation. To determine the exact mechanism, we treated MEF cells with bpV(phen) in the absence or presence of bafilomycin A1 (BAF) to block the degradation of autophagosomes and observed similar increases of LC3-II in the absence of BAF but no increase of LC3-II in the presence of BAF (Fig. 2, C and D), indicating a blockade of the degradation of autophagosomes. The same trends were observed when either HeLa cells (Fig. 2, E and F) or HepG2 cells (Fig. 2, G and H) were exposed to bpV(phen). When HeLa cells stably expressing RFP-LC3 were exposed to bpV(phen), we detected a significant increase in the number of RFP-LC3 punctate foci in the absence of BAF but no increase in the presence of BAF (Fig. 2, I and J). All results indicate that bpV(phen) induces a blockade of the degradation of autophagosomes. p62, another important marker of autophagy flux, has been widely considered to act as a receptor to bring ubiquitinated proteins into the autophagosome for degradation (7Bjørkøy G. Lamark T. Brech A. Outzen H. Perander M. Overvatn A. Stenmark H. Johansen T. p62/SQSTM1 forms protein aggregates degraded by autophagy and has a protective effect on huntingtin-induced cell death.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2506) Google Scholar). It is expected to be elevated when the degradation of autophagosomes is inhibited. Surprisingly, we found a dose-dependent decrease in the levels of p62 on the basis of both immunoblot analysis (Fig. 3, A and B) and immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 3C) of HeLa cells. Further analysis revealed that it was the stability of p62 that was decreased significantly in the presence of bpV(phen) (Fig. 3, D and E). p62 has been reported to bind with polyubiquitinated protein aggregates and help them be packed into autophagosomes and then degraded with the bound aggregates in lysosomes (7Bjørkøy G. Lamark T. Brech A. Outzen H. Perander M. Overvatn A. Stenmark H. Johansen T. p62/SQSTM1 forms protein aggregates degraded by autophagy and has a protective effect on huntingtin-induced cell death.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2506) Google Scholar, 22Komatsu M. Waguri S. Koike M. Sou Y.S. Ueno T. Hara T. Mizushima N. Iwata J. Ezaki J. Murata S. Hamazaki J. Nishito Y.

Homeostatic levels of p62 control cytoplasmic inclusion body formation in autophagy-deficient mice.Cell. 2007; 131: 1149-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar). Inhibition of lysosomal activity with BAF was predicted to increase the levels of p62. However, the decrease in levels of p62 in the presence of bpV(phen) was restored only partially by inhibition of the lysosomal activity with BAF but more dramatically by inhibition of the proteasomal activity of the 26S complex with MG-132 (Fig. 3, F and G). P62 was not associated with RFP-LC3 punctate foci in the presence of MG-132 but colocalized with punctate foci in the presence of BAF (Fig. 3H). Therefore, bpV(phen) exposure does not reduce the stability of p62 through autophagy. Exposure to bpV(phen) led to a nonspecific enhancement in the levels of total ubiquitinated proteins and a specific enhancement of p62 ubiquitination. Blocking proteasomal activity with MG-132 caused an accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated p62 (Fig. 3I). Compared with the control, MG-132 treatment led to accumulation of more ubiquitinated p62 with a low molecular weight, suggesting that ubiquitinated p62 with a high molecular weight cannot be degraded through proteasomes (Fig. 3I). Therefore, bpV(phen) treatment promoted the proteasomal degradation of poly-ubiquitinated p62. In addition to serving as a substrate receptor, p62 has recently been reported to interact with HDAC6 to suppress its deacetylase activity on α-tubulin (23Yan J. Seibenhener M.L. Calderilla-Barbosa L. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. Jiang J. Wooten M.W. Wooten M.C. SQSTM1/p62 interacts with HDAC6 and regulates deacetylase activity.PloS ONE. 2013; 8e76016Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We detected no change in the levels of total α-tubulin but significant decreases in the levels of acetylated α-tubulin when p62 levels were suppressed in HeLa cells with two different p62-specific siRNA molecules (Fig. 4, A–C). Overexpression of p62 exhibited the opposite impact on the levels of acetylated tubulin (Fig. 4D). The levels of acetylated microtubules were reduced dramatically, whereas the general microtubules remained constant (Fig. 4E). Acetylated microtubules are stable and required for the trafficking of autophagosomes to fuse with lysosomes (11Xie R. Nguyen S. McKeehan W.L. Liu L. Acetylated microtubules are required for fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes.BMC Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 89Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The reduction in levels of acetylated microtubules led to an increase of LC3-II in the absence of BAF but even levels of LC3-II in the presence of BAF (Fig. 4, A–C). Overexpression of p62 accelerated the degradation of autophagosomes and led to a reduction in LC3-II levels in the absence of BAF (Fig. 4D). Therefore, degradation of p62 leads to a release of HDAC6 activity that causes deacetylation of α-tubulin, destabilization of microtubules, and blockade of the degradation of autophagosomes. To decipher how bpV(phen) impacts autophagy through p62, we tested the impact of bpV(phen) on the interaction of p62 with HDAC6. When HeLa cells were exposed to bpV(phen), the levels of HDAC6 were reduced slightly, but the levels of acetylated α-tubulin were reduced dramatically, although the total levels of α-tubulin were unchanged (Fig. 5A). The levels of acetylated microtubules in HeLa cells were also impaired in the presence of bpV(phen) (Fig. 5B). We detected a much weaker interaction between p62 and HDAC6 in the presence of bpV(phen) than in the absence of bpV(phen) (Fig. 5C). We reasoned that such a weak interaction might have been caused by reduced input levels of HDAC6 and p62. We treated the cells with BAF and MG-132 and restored the levels of both proteins to be close to the levels of untreated cells, but the weak interaction was not at all improved (Fig. 5C). Therefore, bpV(phen) exposure disrupted the interaction between p62 and HDAC6 and led to the release of HDAC6 to deacetylate α-tubulin, destabilized microtubules, and impaired the degradation of autophagosomes. p62 protein contains multiple domains involving different functions, such as the LC3-interacting region and ubiquitin-associated domain (24Matsumoto G. Wada K. Okuno M. Kurosawa M. Nukina N. Serine 403 phosphorylation of p62/SQSTM1 regulates selective autophagic clearance of ubiquitinated proteins.Mol. Cell. 2011; 44: 279-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). It is generally considered a substrate receptor that connects the polyubiquitinated protein aggregates and dysfunctional mitochondria to LC3-II and facilitates their packaging into autophagosomes (7Bjørkøy G.

Skujat D. Fiesel F.C. Rothfuss O.C. Kahle P.J. Springer W. PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy is dependent on VDAC1 and p62/SQSTM1.Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (2018) Google Scholar). Specific phosphorylation of serine 403 in the ubiquitin-associated domain leads to enhancement of its association with the polyubiquitinated cargo for autophagosomal engulfment (24Matsumoto G. Wada K. Okuno M. Kurosawa M. Nukina N. Serine 403 phosphorylation of p62/SQSTM1 regulates selective autophagic clearance of ubiquitinated proteins.Mol. Cell. 2011; 44: 279-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). The sequence 163–225 of p62 has been identified as the HDAC6-interactive domain (23Yan J. Seibenhener M.L. Calderilla-Barbosa L. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. Jiang J. Wooten M.W. Wooten M.C. SQSTM1/p62 interacts with HDAC6 and regulates deacetylase activity.PloS ONE. 2013; 8e76016Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Serine 207 in the HDAC6-interactive domain of p62 is highly phosphorylated in the presence of a proteasomal inhibitor, and inhibition of autophagy with bafilomycin A1 has been reported to show no accumulation of phosphorylated p62 at serine 207 (24Matsumoto G. Wada K. Okuno M. Kurosawa M. Nukina N. Serine 403 phosphorylation of p62/SQSTM1 regulates selective autophagic clearance of ubiquitinated proteins.Mol. Cell. 2011; 44: 279-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Treatment with bpV(phen) seems to enhance the phosphorylation of p62 at serine 207 and disrupt the interaction with HDAC6. Further analysis of the impact of bpV(phen) on the p62-HDAC6 interaction will clarify the mechanism in detail. Interestingly, proteasomal inhibition did not cause any alternation in the phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue in p62 protein (24Matsumoto G. Wada K. Okuno M. Kurosawa M. Nukina N. Serine 403 phosphorylation of p62/SQSTM1 regulates selective autophagic clearance of ubiquitinated proteins.Mol. Cell. 2011; 44: 279-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Therefore, the impact of bpV(phen) on autophagy seems to be not through its PTEN inhibition because PTEN inhibition may activate autophagy initiation. p62 has been reported to bind with ubiquitinated proteins and be engulfed and degraded in the autophagosome. It is unknown whether p62 is required to be ubiquitinated for lysosomal degradation (26Pankiv S. Clausen T.H. Lamark T. Brech A. Bruun J.A. Outzen H. Øvervatn A. Bjørkøy G. Johansen T. p62/SQSTM1 binds directly to Atg8/LC3 to facilitate degradation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates by autophagy.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24131-24145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3307) Google Scholar). Cullin-3 (Cul-3) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that catalyzes the ubiquitination of p62 and promotes the degradation of p62 through proteasomes (27Lee J. Kim H.R. Quinley C. Kim J. Gonzalez-Navajas J. Xavier R. Raz E. Autophagy suppresses interleukin-1β (IL-1β) signaling by activation of p62 degradation via lysosomal and proteasomal pathways.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 4033-4040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Exposure to bpV(phen) may activate E3 ubiquitin ligases such as Cul-3 to promote the ubiquitination of p62 or promote the modification of p62 into a better substrate of ubiquitin ligase. The report that proteasomal inhibition with MG-132 did not cause any alteration in the ubiquitination of p62 protein (24Matsumoto G. Wada K. Okuno M. Kurosawa M. Nukina N. Serine 403 phosphorylation of p62/SQSTM1 regulates selective autophagic clearance of ubiquitinated proteins.Mol. Cell. 2011; 44: 279-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar) suggests that the ubiquitination of p62 is a specific effect of bpV(phen) exposure. Overactive autophagy leads to the depletion of cellular contents and, eventually, cell death. In this sense, autophagy is classified as type II programmed cell death (28Klionsky D.J. Autophagy: from phenomenology to molecular understanding in less than a decade.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 931-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar). Instead, autophagy has a pro-survival function when cells are under metabolic stress (29Gozuacik D. Kimchi A. Autophagy and cell death.Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2007; 78: 217-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 30Levine B. Yuan J. Autophagy in cell death: an innocent convict?.J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 2679-2688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1471) Google Scholar). Its dysfunction causes failure of the cells to sustain metabolic homeostasis and survive (31Mathew R. Kongara S. Beaudoin B. Karp C.M. Bray K. Degenhardt K. Chen G. Jin S. White E. Autophagy suppresses tumor progression by limiting chromosomal instability.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1367-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). If the autophagic process is blocked before autophagosomal formation, then the fragmented mitochondria will release cytochrome c and other small molecules to induce conventional apoptosis, which is usually associated with diverse forms of aggregation and perinuclear clustering of the dysfunctional mitochondria. The dead cell debris generated from apoptosis and autophagy is still contained in an intact plasma membrane and taken up by phagocytosis (32Cryns V. Yuan J. Proteases to die for.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1551-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar, 33Desagher S. Martinou J.C. Mitochondria as the central control point of apoptosis.Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 369-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1689) Google Scholar). If the process is blocked before autolysosome formation or if autophagosomes are not degraded efficiently, then the accumulated mitochondria may become damaged by their own production of superoxide, start to leak electrons, lose their membrane potentials, and even induce robust oxidative stress (1Mizushima N. Noda T. Yoshimori T. Tanaka Y. Ishii T. George M.D. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y.

Immunol. 2008; 9: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (2159) Google Scholar). Both oxidative stress and lysosomal rupture, in turn, activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, which results in direct activation of caspase 1 (36Lamkanfi M. Dixit V.M. Mechanisms and functions of inflammasomes.Cell. 2014; 157: 1013-1022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1593) Google Scholar). Activation of caspase 1 subsequently induces the secretion of potent pro-inflammatory cytokines and, eventually, an inflammatory form of cell death referred to as pyroptosis of the cell and other cells in the environment (21Ryter S.W.

The tested sample consisted of 258 patients (111 males and 147 females, in-patients and out-patients at the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Medical University of Vienna and University Hospital Tulln, Lower Austria). Psychiatric diagnoses were derived from the SCAN (Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry) interview. In addition, patients were administered the Lifetime Parasuicidal Count (LPC), Suicidal Behaviour Questionnaire (SBQ-R), and Viennese Suicide Risk Assessment Scale (VISURIAS) questionnaires.In contrast to male suicide attempters, female suicide attempters showed both significantly higher total CTQ scores (p<0.001), and higher CTQ subscores (emotional, physical and sexual abuse, as well as emotional and physical neglect) in comparison to the non-suicidal control group. Besides, females with a history of self-harming behaviour (including suicidal intention) and Non-Suicidal-Self Injury (NSSI) had significantly higher CTQ total scores (p<0.001) than the control group.These findings suggest gender differences in suicidal behaviour after being exposed to childhood trauma."

MMADHC (the methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria type D protein), commonly referred to as CblD, is a key chaperone involved in intracellular cobalamin trafficking, and mutations in CblD cause methylmalonic aciduria and/or homocystinuria. Herein, we report the first crystal structure of the globular C-terminal domain of human CblD, which is sufficient for its interaction with MMADHC (the methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria type C protein), or CblC, and for supporting the cytoplasmic cobalamin trafficking pathway. CblD contains an α+β fold that is structurally reminiscent of the nitro-FMN reductase superfamily. Two of the closest structural relatives of CblD are CblC, a multifunctional enzyme important for cobalamin trafficking, and the activation domain of methionine synthase. CblD, CblC, and the activation domain of methionine synthase share several distinguishing features and, together with two recently described corrinoid-dependent reductive dehalogenases, constitute a new subclass within the nitro-FMN reductase superfamily. We demonstrate that CblD enhances oxidation of cob(II)alamin bound to CblC and that disease-causing mutations in CblD impair the kinetics of this reaction. The striking structural similarity of CblD to CblC, believed to be contiguous in the cobalamin trafficking pathway, suggests the co-option of molecular mimicry as a strategy for achieving its function."
https://openalex.org/W2337718433,"Background Cbf11 and Cbf12, the fission yeast CSL transcription factors, have been implicated in the regulation of cell-cycle progression, but no specific roles have been described and their target genes have been only partially mapped. Methodology/Principal Findings Using a combination of transcriptome profiling under various conditions and genome-wide analysis of CSL-DNA interactions, we identify genes regulated directly and indirectly by CSL proteins in fission yeast. We show that the expression of stress-response genes and genes that are expressed periodically during the cell cycle is deregulated upon genetic manipulation of cbf11 and/or cbf12. Accordingly, the coordination of mitosis and cytokinesis is perturbed in cells with genetically manipulated CSL protein levels, together with other specific defects in cell-cycle progression. Cbf11 activity is nutrient-dependent and Δcbf11-associated defects are mitigated by inactivation of the protein kinase A (Pka1) and stress-activated MAP kinase (Sty1p38) pathways. Furthermore, Cbf11 directly regulates a set of lipid metabolism genes and Δcbf11 cells feature a stark decrease in the number of storage lipid droplets. Conclusions/Significance Our results provide a framework for a more detailed understanding of the role of CSL proteins in the regulation of cell-cycle progression in fission yeast."
https://openalex.org/W2241101333,"Advances in the treatment of breast cancer have resulted in increased survival. However, in the metastatic setting, the disease remains incurable. Therefore, understanding of the mechanisms that promote dissemination of breast cancer cells may favor the development of novel therapeutic strategies to fight those tumors. Here, we show that the ErbB ligands, Neuregulins (NRGs), promote metastatic dissemination of breast cancer cells by switching on a kinase-metalloproteinase network. Clinicopathological analyses demonstrated that NRG expression in breast tumors associated to lymph node invasion and poor patient outcome. Preclinical in vivo analyses showed that NRG expression favored in situ tumor growth, local spreading and metastatic dissemination. Genomic, biochemical and functional studies identified matrix metalloproteinases, particularly stromelysin 2 and collagenase 3, as key mediators of the NRG-induced dissemination properties of breast cancer cells. Mechanistic analyses demonstrated that NRG augmented metalloproteinase expression through a route controlled by ERK1/2 kinases. ERK1/2 increased collagenase 3 expression by controlling the activity of an SBF1-related transcription factor. In conclusion, we describe a pathway linked to breast cancer dissemination. The clinical availability of agents that target some of the components of this signalling pathway suggests that patients with tumors fed by NRGs or other factors able to activate the ERK-Collagenase 3 route may benefit from agents that act on that signalling axis."

https://openalex.org/W1471593397,"In mice, nutritional supplementation with the trans-10,cis-12 isomer of linoleic acid (t10,c12-CLA) promotes lipoatrophy, hyperinsulinemia, and macrophage infiltration in white adipose tissue (WAT). We explored the dynamics of these interrelated responses over 2 consecutive 7 d periods of t10,c12-CLA administration and withdrawal. t10,c12-CLA down-regulated lipogenic and lipolytic gene expression and increased collagen deposition, but with no evidence of cross-linking. An abundant CD45(+) cell infiltrate, comprising prominently CD206(+)CD11c(-) macrophages, was found in WAT in association with an anti-inflammatory gene signature. Infiltration of natural killer (NK) and dendritic cells contributed to WAT's innate immune response to t10,c12-CLA. Less abundant adaptive immune cells colonized WAT, including B, NK T, γδ T, and αβ T cells. By contrast, T-regulatory cell abundance was not affected. Interruption of treatment allowed recovery of WAT mass and normalization of insulinemia, coincident with regain of WAT homeostasis owing to a coordinated reversion of genic, structural, and immune deregulations. These data revealed a striking resilience of WAT after a short-term metabolic injury induced by t10,c12-CLA, which relies on alternatively activated M2 macrophage engagement. In addition, the temporal links between variations in WAT alterations and insulinemia upon t10,c12-CLA manipulation strengthen the view that WAT dysfunctional status is critically involved in altered glucose homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2335791141,"Although CT scanners generally allow dynamic acquisition of thin slices (1 mm), thick slice (≥5 mm) reconstruction is commonly used for stroke imaging to reduce data, processing time, and noise level. Thin slice CT perfusion (CTP) reconstruction may suffer less from partial volume effects, and thus yield more accurate quantitative results with increased resolution. Before thin slice protocols are to be introduced clinically, it needs to be ensured that this does not affect overall CTP constancy. We studied the influence of thin slice reconstruction on average perfusion values by comparing it with standard thick slice reconstruction.From 50 patient studies, absolute and relative hemisphere averaged estimates of cerebral blood volume (CBV), cerebral blood flow (CBF), mean transit time (MTT), and permeability-surface area product (PS) were analyzed using 0.8, 2.4, 4.8, and 9.6 mm slice reconstructions. Specifically, the influence of Gaussian and bilateral filtering, the arterial input function (AIF), and motion correction on the perfusion values was investigated.Bilateral filtering gave noise levels comparable to isotropic Gaussian filtering, with less partial volume effects. Absolute CBF, CBV and PS were 22%, 14% and 46% lower with 0.8 mm than with 4.8 mm slices. If the AIF and motion correction were based on thin slices prior to reconstruction of thicker slices, these differences reduced to 3%, 4% and 3%. The effect of slice thickness on relative values was very small.This study shows that thin slice reconstruction for CTP with unaltered acquisition protocol gives relative perfusion values without clinically relevant bias. It does however affect absolute perfusion values, of which CBF and CBV are most sensitive. Partial volume effects in large arteries and veins lead to overestimation of these values. The effects of reconstruction slice thickness should be taken into account when absolute perfusion values are used for clinical decision making."
https://openalex.org/W2273437172,"Nude mice are important in vivo model for characterization of cell malignancy behavior; however, many cancer cells fail to form tumors in it. Understanding this defective mechanism may provide novel insights into tumorigenesis and how tumor cells escape innate immunity. Whole-genome sequencing was conducted on two gastric cancer (GC) cells, BGC823 and AGS, which do and do not form tumors in nude mice, to identify their genomic differences relevant to natural killer (NK) cells. We found that the tumorigenic capacity of human GC cell lines was dependent on the recruitment and activation of NK cells in xenograft tumors. We used whole-genome sequence (WGS) on GC cell lines to identify potential genes controlling susceptibility to NK-mediated killing. The tumorigenic cell line BGC823 expressed high levels of HLA-I because of copy gain and was resistant to NK cell killing. In contrast, another cell line AGS expressing low levels of HLA-I with activated NKp30/MAPK/IL-12 (interleukin-12) or IL-2 (interleukin-2) pathway was susceptible to NK lysis. Treatment of tumor bearing mice with systemic administration of IL-12 in combination with intratumor injection of anti-HLA-I antibody significantly increased NK cell recruitment into xenograft tumors, which became sensitive to NK killing, resulting in reduced tumor progression. In human GC specimens, decreased HLA-I expression and increased NK cells surrounding tumor cells were correlated with decreased metastasis potential and better prognosis of patients. Our results provide a mechanistic basis for GC cells to escape NK lysis and a promising prospect of NK immunotherapy for GC cells."
https://openalex.org/W2175859329,"The aim of this work is to incorporate cooperativity into Huxley-type cross-bridge model in thermodynamically consistent way. While the Huxley-type models assume that cross-bridges act independently from each other, we take into account that each cross-bridge is influenced by its neighbors and cooperativity is induced by tropomyosin movement. For that, we introduce ensembles of cross-bridge groups connected by elastic tropomyosin. By taking into account that the mechanical displacement of tropomyosin induces free energy change of the cross-bridge group ensemble, we develop the formalism for thermodynamically consistent description of the cooperativity in muscle contraction. An example model was composed to test the approach. The model parameters were found by optimization from the linear relation between oxygen consumption and stress-strain area as well as experimentally measured stress dynamics of rat trabecula. We have found a good agreement between the optimized model solution and experimental data. Simulations also showed that it is possible to study cooperativity with the approach developed in this work."

These enzymes recognize long DNA sequences; their recognition sites vary between 12–45 bp in length. HEs are highly sequence-specific enzymes and display a very low frequency of off-target cleavage, even in whole genomes. Due to this rare-cutting property, they have been used for the manipulation of the genomes of mammalian and plant cells (1.Choulika A. Perrin A. Dujon B. Nicolas J.F.

However, the use of meganuclease-induced recombination has long been limited by the repertoire of natural meganucleases amenable of customization. homing endonuclease root mean square deviation. HEs are grouped in several families; among them the LAGLIDADG family is the most abundant. The family name derives from the conserved amino acid sequence motif containing the catalytic aspartic residue. The nucleases of this family cleave their DNA target along the minor groove to generate cohesive 4-bp-long 3′-OH overhangs. Two classes of LAGLIDADG nucleases can be found. One of them contains a single copy of the motif acting as homodimers, which bind palindromic or near-palindromic DNA target sequences. The other class contains two copies of the LAGLIDADG motif acting as monomers, which recognize and cleave non-palindromic DNA sequences (4.Marcaida M.J. Muñoz I.G. Blanco F.J. Prieto J. Montoya G. Homing endonucleases: from basics to therapeutic applications.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2010; 67: 727-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Catalysis requires the conserved acidic residue at the C termini of the two LAGLIDADG sequences in the active site and the coordination of divalent metal cations for phosphodiester hydrolysis (5.Chevalier B.S. Monnat Jr., R.J. Stoddard B.L. The homing endonuclease I-CreI uses three metals, one of which is shared between the two active sites.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 312-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Members of the LAGLIDADG family have been engineered to specifically target new DNA sequences emerging as powerful tools for gene targeting. The most used template is I-CreI, whose scaffold has been redesigned using a combinatorial approach to target new specific DNA sequences (6.Prieto J. Molina R. Montoya G. Molecular scissors for in situ cellular repair.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2012; 47: 207-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). I-CvuI is a homologue of I-CreI, and therefore a homodimeric LAGLIDADG homing endonuclease. This enzyme is coded by the genome of the chloroplast large subunit ribosomal RNA gene of the green algae Chlorella vulgaris. I-CvuI recognizes and cleaves a 24-bp-long DNA palindromic sequence (see Fig. 1). Here we report the crystal structure of I-CvuI in complex with its target DNA, hereafter termed Sro1.3, and with the target DNA of I-CreI, hereafter termed C1221 (7.Arnould S. Chames P. Perez C.

Furthermore, after evaluating the metal dependence of I-CvuI catalysis, we analyzed in vitro the metal concentration dependence of the phosphodiester hydrolysis reaction using catalytic ions ranging from non-cleavable to cleavable concentrations. I-CvuI expression, purification, protein·DNA complex formation in the presence of Sro1.3 (5′-TCAGAACGTCGTACGACGTTCTGA-3′) and crystallization have been described previously (9.Redondo P. Merino N.

Here we have incubated the complex in the presence of both non-catalytic ions (Ca2+ at 2 mm) and catalytic ions (Mg2+ and Mn2+ at 2–20 and 2 mm, respectively). For comparison reasons, we also obtained the I-CvuI·DNA complex using the analogue DNA target from I-CreI, C1221 (5′-TCAAAACGTCGTACGACGTTTTGA-3′), in the presence of 2 mm Mg2+. The C1221, a palindromic 24-bp DNA target, derived from the pseudo-palindromic I-CreI wild-type target (10.Wang J. Kim H.H. Yuan X. Herrin D.L.

Both protein and DNA samples were extensively dialyzed in 25 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4. I-CvuI (6 μm) and Sro1.3 or C1221 (both at 65 μm) were loaded into the calorimeter cell and titration syringe, respectively. Titrations were carried out using 25 injections of 1.5 μl each injected at 180–240-s intervals. Data analysis was performed on the concentration-normalized heats by nonlinear regression using the MicroCal PEAQ-ITC analysis software (Malvern). Microscale thermophoresis experiments were performed on a NanoTemper Monolith NT.115 instrument using 40% LED and 20–40% IR-laser power. Laser on and off times were set at 30 and 5 s, respectively. Cy5-labeled oligonucleotides were purchased from TAG Copenhagen A/S (Copenhagen, Denmark). The concentration of the labeled oligonucleotides was kept constant at 25 nm, and the corresponding endonuclease binding patterns were titrated in 1:1 dilutions with the highest concentrations at 500 nm or 8 μm. Samples were prepared in buffer containing 25 mm Hepes, 50 mm NaCl, 0.2% Pluronic F-127, 0.5 mg/ml BSA, pH 7.4, supplemented with either 10 mm CaCl2 or 10 mm MgCl2, and loaded into standard treated capillaries (NanoTemper Technologies) for measurements. The KD was determined by fitting the change in thermophoretic depletion to the quadratic solution of the mass acton law. (The fluorescence during thermodiffusion was averaged for 1 s after the 10 s of IR-laser heating due to the higher signal to noise in this region. Overall, the IR-laser was on for 30 s.) Error bars are the standard deviation between three independent repeats (n = 3). To analyze the effect of cations, the I-CvuI enzymatic activity was assayed against Sro1.3 and C1221 included either in a BamHI-linearized yeast plasmid or in an XmnI-linearized pGEM-T plasmid, respectively, as described previously (12.Prieto J.

The cleavage of linearized plasmid was performed at variable cation concentrations (between 1 and 10 μm for MgCl2 or MnCl2) against 100 ng of substrate and with 150 ng of protein. In the assays, the wild-type I-CvuI was incubated with the DNA at 37 °C in 10 mm Tris pH 8, 50 mm NaCl and the corresponding cation using a final volume of 25 μl. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 6× Buffer Stop (45% glycerol, 95 mm EDTA (pH 8), 1.5% (w/v) SDS, 1.5 mg/ml proteinase K, and 0.048% (w/v) bromophenol blue) and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Samples were then electrophoresed in 0.6% agarose gels, and the intensity of the bands was observed under UV light. All data were collected at 100 K, using a PILATUS 6M detector both at the PX beamline at the Swiss Light Source (SLS, Villigen) and at XALOC (ALBA, Barcelona, Spain).

The overall fold of I-CvuI in complex with its DNA target is similar to I-CreI (Fig. 1).

Each monomer contains the typical αββαββα topology of the LAGLIDADG family having three extra helices at the C terminus. Two antiparallel β-sheets, β1-β4 and β′1-β′4, form a concave surface with an inner cylindrical shape where the DNA molecule is accommodated (Fig. 1A). The non-cleaved DNA and the cleaved I-CvuI DNA structures differ in the status of the DNA molecule (Fig. 2), but the protein moieties are similar with a Cα6–162 rmsd of 0.27 Å.

Therefore, due to our final aim to provide a new scaffold for meganuclease design, we have compared the I-CvuI structure with this member of the family. I-CvuI shows respectively 37% identity and 55% sequence similarity with I-CreI. The crystal structures of I-CvuI and I-CreI (19.Jurica M.S. Monnat Jr., R.J. Stoddard B.L. DNA recognition and cleavage by the LAGLIDADG homing endonuclease I-CreI.Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 469-476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) share a common overall folding; nevertheless some secondary structure differences are observed (Fig. 1B). As a consequence of their primary sequence differences, the main topology differences are located at α1, α3-α4, and α6. Particularly interesting are the higher length of α6 in I-CvuI than in I-CreI and the presence of η2 at the end of α4 in I-CvuI, whereas in I-CreI, η2 is located at the end of α3. The DNA interaction patterns in I-CvuI·Sro1.3 and I-CreI·C1221 complexes are very different (Fig. 3A), although the DNA sequences of the Sro1.3 and the C1221 are almost identical, differing only at positions ±9 (Fig. 3A). However, the targets conserve only the interactions between the residues Gln-29 (Gln-26 in I-CreI) with −6GstrandB and Arg-73 (Arg-70 in I-CreI) with −3GstrandB and −4TstrandA (Fig. 3A). The superimposition of the complexes I-CvuI·Sro1.3 and I-CreI·C1221 show that although both protein structures maintain the overall folding (Cα rmsd 1.32 Å), the DNA structures display clear differences. The origin of the change in the folding of both targets seemed to be located at the positions where the sequences are different (±9) (Fig. 3, B and C), and to analyze the details, we used the 3DNA program (18.Lu X.J. Olson W.K. 3DNA: a versatile, integrated software system for the analysis, rebuilding and visualization of three-dimensional nucleic-acid structures.Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 1213-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), revealing clear changes in the twist parameter at those regions. Thus, the local base step parameter twists in Sro1.3 at the transition A/G, G/A and T/C, C/T are higher (30.15°, 50.64° and 44.06°, and 32.02°) than at the transition A/A, A/A and T/T, T/T in the C1221 (31.46°, 33.52° and 31.25°, and 37.14°), and this punctual difference is responsible for the higher twisting of the overall folding. To further understand the molecular basis of the higher overall twisting in Sro1.3 as compared with C1221, we analyzed in detail the interactions at positions ±9. As indicated in Fig. 3C, Arg-33 of I-CvuI interacts with −9GstrandA in the Sro1.3 target, whereas in the C1221, DNAQ38 from I-CreI shows an analogue interaction with −9AstrandA. In addition, C1221 shows an extra interaction with the complementary base to −9AstrandA, −9TstrandB, through Asn-30 from I-CreI. The longer side chain of Arg-33 in I-CvuI as compared with Gln-38 in I-CreI along with the extra interaction through Asn-30 from I-CreI explained the over-twisting of the Sro1.3 target. Isothermal titration calorimetry data indeed show an unfavorable entropic contribution (−TΔS = 18.2 kcal/mol at 25 °C) for the I-CvuI·I-Sro1.3 complex that is nevertheless offset by a most favorable enthalpy contribution (ΔH = −28.1 kcal/mol at 25 °C). Previous work reveals that I-CvuI is a highly specific enzyme. It displays no or low activity when it binds the DNA targets of homologous enzymes such as for example the one of I-CreI (8.Lucas P. Otis C. Mercier J.P. Turmel M. Lemieux C. Rapid evolution of the DNA-binding site in LAGLIDADG homing endonucleases.Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 960-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that the binding affinity of I-CvuI for the C1221 palindromic target of I-CreI is lower as compared with the affinity for its own target in the presence of both non-catalytic and catalytic cations (FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5). I-CvuI shows a 3-fold higher affinity (53.3 versus 131.9 nm) for its own target versus the C1221 as measured by isothermal titration calorimetry (Figs. 4B and 5B). However, I-CreI cleaves the Sro1.3 in a similar degree to C1221 (8.Lucas P. Otis C. Mercier J.P. Turmel M. Lemieux C. Rapid evolution of the DNA-binding site in LAGLIDADG homing endonucleases.Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 960-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Thus, to address specificity issues and how they could affect the site recognition flexibility for redesign purposes, we also solved the crystal structure of the complex formed by I-CvuI and C1221 (Fig. 6A, bottom), thus deciphering the protein-DNA contacts with this sequence. The Sro1.3 and C1221 are palindromic. They differ only in the two positions ±9 of the whole 22-bp target (Fig. 6A). Exchanging the G/C base pairs at ±9 in the Sro1.3 by A/T base pairs in the C1221 promoted rearrangements in the protein-DNA interaction interface. Seven out of eight amino acids are involved in direct interactions to bases with Sro1.3 (Fig. 6A, top). These interactions were conserved in the I-CvuI·C1221 complex structure. A new extra residue, Gln-41, appeared involved in the I-CvuI·C1221 interface (Fig. 6A, bottom). This new interaction does not alter the conformation of the DNA target (Fig. 6B). However, although −9GstrandA in Sro1.3 interacts specifically with Arg-33, the corresponding base in the palindromic C1221 (−9AstrandA) interacts with Gln-41 and Arg-43 through water-mediated contacts (Fig. 6C). Furthermore, −9CstrandB in Sro1.3 does not display protein contacts, whereas the base in the same position in C1221 (−9TstrandB) interacts specifically with Arg-33. An additional difference is that −8TstrandB in Sro1.3 interacts with Arg-43 through a water-mediated contact, but its counterpart in C1221 shows a direct interaction with Arg-33.FIGURE 5I-CvuI binding and in vitro cleavage experiments using the C1221 target in the presence of different metals at different concentrations.

Stella S. Redondo P. Gomez H. Marcaida M.J. Orozco M. Prieto J. Montoya G. Visualizing phosphodiester-bond hydrolysis by an endonuclease.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2015; 22: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The conserved acidic residues at the active site coordinate the divalent metal ions. The general mechanism of cleavage of the phosphodiester bonds of DNA requires a nucleophile to attack the electron-deficient phosphorus atom, a general base to activate the nucleophile, and a general acid to protonate the leaving group. Positively charged groups are also needed to stabilize the phosphoanion transition state. The role of divalent metal ions during cleavage in LAGLIDADG meganucleases has been thoroughly studied (21.Stoddard B.L. Homing endonuclease structure and function.Q. Rev. Biophys. 2005; 38: 49-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 20.Molina R. Stella S. Redondo P. Gomez H. Marcaida M.J. Orozco M. Prieto J. Montoya G. Visualizing phosphodiester-bond hydrolysis by an endonuclease.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2015; 22: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Three metal sites have been observed in the active center called A, B, and C. Sites A and B are located in opposite locations, whereas site C occupies the center of the active site (Fig. 2A). The metal at site C is shared between the two catalytic sites and participates in a two-metal ion cleavage mechanism to hydrolyze the phosphodiesters of both strands (20.Molina R. Stella S. Redondo P. Gomez H. Marcaida M.J. Orozco M. Prieto J. Montoya G. Visualizing phosphodiester-bond hydrolysis by an endonuclease.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2015; 22: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The positions of the metal ions in the crystal structures of the I-CvuI were analyzed by collecting anomalous diffraction data, using crystals grown in the presence of CaCl2 and MnCl2 (Fig. 2, B and C). The structure of the enzyme·substrate complex included the non-catalytic Ca2+ ions, which were visualized by examining the anomalous difference Fourier maps. In contrast with I-CreI, which shows three Ca2+ atoms in the active site (5.Chevalier B.S. Monnat Jr., R.J. Stoddard B.L. The homing endonuclease I-CreI uses three metals, one of which is shared between the two active sites.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 312-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), only two anomalous peaks could be detected in sites A and B of the I-CvuI active center (Fig. 2B). The Ca2+ atoms are hexacoordinated with phosphates from both DNA strands (+3GstrandA, −1AstrandB, and +1AstrandA, −3GstrandB, respectively), three water molecules, and the side chains of Asp-23-Asp′-23 in each LAGLIDADG motif. We followed a similar strategy for the enzyme·product complex including the presence of Mn2+ ions (TABLE 1, TABLE 2). Three anomalous peaks in sites A, B, and C were detected due to the presence of this metal in the I-CvuI active center (Fig. 2C). The central Mn2+ ion is shared between the two acidic catalytic residues. The two external Mn2+ ions are located in positions equivalent to the Ca2+ cations. They also display similar interactions with neighboring atoms. The Mn2+ ion in site A is coordinated with the side chain of Asp-23, the carbonyl of Ala′-22, the 5′-phosphate of +3"
