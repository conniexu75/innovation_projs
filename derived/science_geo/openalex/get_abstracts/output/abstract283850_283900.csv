https://openalex.org/W2063278106,Grasshopper neurons accurately project axons across long distances between peripheral structures and the central nervous system. Nerve-trunk pathways followed by these axons are established early in embryogenesis by pioneer neurons. Growth cones from the first pioneers navigate along a chain of cells to the CNS. The placement of these cells may constitute the initial guidance mechanism underlying long-distance pathfinding.

https://openalex.org/W2074074916,Creatinuria was found in all 42 diabetic clinic subjects of both sexes taken at random. Total creatinine determined in the urines of diabetics by the Albanese modification showed a variable deviation (in magnitude and direction) when compared with total creatinine obtained by the Folin method.
