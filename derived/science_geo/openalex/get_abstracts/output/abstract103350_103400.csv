https://openalex.org/W1968098810,"Mutations in HERG cause an inherited cardiac arrhythmia, long QT syndrome (LQT). To define the function of HERG, we expressed the protein in Xenopus oocytes. The biophysical properties of expressed HERG are nearly identical to the rapidly activating delayed rectifier K+ current (IKr) in cardiac myocytes. HERG current is K+ selective, declines with depolarizations above 0 mV, is activated by extracellular K+, and is blocked by lanthanum. Interestingly, HERG current is not blocked by drugs that specifically block IKr in cardiac myocytes. These data indicate that HERG proteins form IKr channels, but that an additional subunit may be required for drug sensitivity. Since block of IKr is a known mechanism for drug-induced cardiac arrhythmias, the finding that HERG encodes IKr channels provides a mechanistic link between certain forms of inherited and acquired LQT."
https://openalex.org/W2066284211,"Lactacystin is a Streptomyces metabolite that inhibits cell cycle progression and induces neurite outgrowth in a murine neuroblastoma cell line. Tritium-labeled lactacystin was used to identify the 20S proteasome as its specific cellular target. Three distinct peptidase activities of this enzyme complex (trypsin-like, chymotrypsin-like, and peptidylglutamyl-peptide hydrolyzing activities) were inhibited by lactacystin, the first two irreversibly and all at different rates. None of five other proteases were inhibited, and the ability of lactacystin analogs to inhibit cell cycle progression and induce neurite outgrowth correlated with their ability to inhibit the proteasome. Lactacystin appears to modify covalently the highly conserved amino-terminal threonine of the mammalian proteasome subunit X (also called MB1), a close homolog of the LMP7 proteasome subunit encoded by the major histocompatibility complex. This threonine residue may therefore have a catalytic role, and subunit X/MB1 may be a core component of an amino-terminal-threonine protease activity of the proteasome."
https://openalex.org/W2091726431,"The aryl hydrocarbon (Ah) receptor (AHR) mediates many carcinogenic and teratogenic effects of environmentally toxic chemicals such as dioxin. An AHR-deficient (Ahr-/-) mouse line was constructed by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. Almost half of the mice died shortly after birth, whereas survivors reached maturity and were fertile. The Ahr-/- mice showed decreased accumulation of lymphocytes in the spleen and lymph nodes, but not in the thymus. The livers of Ahr-/- mice were reduced in size by 50 percent and showed bile duct fibrosis Ahr-/- mice were also nonresponsive with regard to dioxin-mediated induction of genes encoding enzymes that catalyze the metabolism of foreign compounds. Thus, the AHR plays an important role in the development of the liver and the immune system."
https://openalex.org/W2005717642,"Cyclin B is degraded at the onset of anaphase by a ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic system. We have fractionated mitotic Xenopus egg extracts to identify components required for this process. We find that UBC4 and at least one other ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme can support cyclin B ubiquitination. The mitotic specificity of cyclin ubiquitination is determined by a 20S complex that contains homologs of budding yeast CDC16 and CDC27. Because these proteins are required for anaphase in yeast and mammalian cells, we refer to this complex as the anaphase-promoting complex (APC). CDC27 antibodies deplete APC activity, while immunopurified CDC27 complexes are sufficient to complement either interphase extracts or a mixture of recombinant UBC4 and the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1. These results suggest that APC functions as a regulated ubiquitin-protein ligase that targets cyclin B for destruction in mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W2077211332,"Of the six glutamate receptor (GluR) channel subunit families identified by molecular cloning, five have been shown to constitute either the AMPA, kainate, or NMDA receptor channel, whereas the function of the delta subunit family remains unknown. The selective localization of the delta 2 subunit of the GluR delta subfamily in cerebellar Purkinje cells prompted us to examine its possible physiological roles by the gene targeting technique. Analyses of the GluR delta 2 mutant mice reveal that the delta 2 subunit plays important roles in motor coordination, formation of parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses and climbing fiber-Purkinje cell synapses, and long-term depression of parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synaptic transmission. These results suggest a close relationship between synaptic plasticity and synapse formation in the cerebellum."
https://openalex.org/W1980475055,"The binding subunit of Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin (LT-B) is a highly active oral immunogen. Transgenic tobacco and potato plants were made with the use of genes encoding LT-B or an LT-B fusion protein with a microsomal retention sequence. The plants expressed the foreign peptides, both of which formed oligomers that bound the natural ligand. Mice immunized by gavage produced serum and gut mucosal anti-LT-B immunoglobulins that neutralized the enterotoxin in cell protection assays. Feeding mice fresh transgenic potato tubers also caused oral immunization."
https://openalex.org/W2029625075,"Four transgenic Nicotiana tabacum plants were generated that expressed a murine monoclonal antibody kappa chain, a hybrid immunoglobulin A-G heavy chain, a murine joining chain, and a rabbit secretory component, respectively. Successive sexual crosses between these plants and filial recombinants resulted in plants that expressed all four protein chains simultaneously. These chains were assembled into a functional, high molecular weight secretory immunoglobulin that recognized the native streptococcal antigen I/II cell surface adhesion molecule. In plants, single cells are able to assemble secretory antibodies, whereas two different cell types are required in mammals. Transgenic plants may be suitable for large-scale production of recombinant secretory immunoglobulin A for passive mucosal immunotherapy. Plant cells also possess the requisite mechanisms for assembly and expression of other complex recombinant protein molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2084343743,"B-type cyclin destruction is necessary for exit from mitosis and the initiation of a new cell cycle. Through the isolation of mutants, we have identified three essential yeast genes, CDC16, CDC23, and CSE1, which are required for proteolysis of the B-type cyclin CLB2 but not of other unstable proteins. cdc23-1 mutants are defective in both entering and exiting anaphase. Their failure to exit anaphase can be explained by defective cyclin proteolysis. CDC23 is required at the metaphase/anaphase transition to separate sister chromatids, and we speculate that it might promote proteolysis of proteins that hold sister chromatids together. Proteolysis of CLB2 is initiated in early anaphase, but a fraction of CLB2 remains stable until anaphase is complete."
https://openalex.org/W2223063733,"Mutations in the PKD1 gene are the most common cause of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Other PKD1-like loci on chromosome 16 are approximately 97% identical to PKD1. To determine the authentic PKD1 sequence, we obtained the genomic sequence of the PKD1 locus and assembled a PKD1 transcript from the sequence of 46 exons. The 14.5 kb PKD1 transcript encodes a 4304 amino acid protein that has a novel domain architecture. The amino-terminal half of the protein consists of a mosaic of previously described domains, including leucine-rich repeats flanked by characteristic cysteine-rich structures, LDL-A and C-type lectin domains, and 14 units of a novel 80 amino acid domain. The presence of these domains suggests that the PKD1 protein is involved in adhesive protein-protein and protein-carbohydrate interactions in the extracellular compartment. We propose a hypothesis that links the predicted properties of the protein with the diverse phenotypic features of ADPKD."
https://openalex.org/W2001644877,"As I hope this review has made clear, mRNA localization plays an important role in directing specific proteins to their correct position within a cell. Although the study of this process is still in its infancy, it is already apparent that there are several ways that mRNAs can be targeted to particular subcellular sites. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for these different localization pathways are still largely obscure, and their elucidation must await the identification of the specific factors that mediate the interactions between the localized mRNAs and more general components such as the cytoskeleton. Most examples of localized mRNAs are likely to share several common features. First, the site of localization will be determined by the preexisting polarity of the cell, and this will most often depend on the organization of the cytoskeleton, either directly, in the case of active transport, or indirectly, when localization is mediated by localized anchoring sites or stability factors. Second, mRNA localization is likely to be tightly coupled to translational control. If it is important for a cell to synthesize a protein in a particular place, then the translation of the mRNA must be repressed until it is localized. Indeed, there are already several examples where the direct linkage between translational control and localization has been demonstrated, and these are discussed in the accompanying review by Curtis et al. (1995)."
https://openalex.org/W2090076837,"BPAG1 is the major antigenic determinant of autoimmune sera of bullous pemphigoid (BP) patients. It is made by stratified squamous epithelia, where it localizes to the inner surface of specialized integrin-mediated adherens junctions (hemidesmosomes). To explore the function of BPAG1 and its relation to BP, we targeted the removal of the BPAG1 gene in mice. Hemidesmosomes are otherwise normal, but they lack the inner plate and have no cytoskeleton attached. Though not affecting cell growth or substratum adhesion, this compromises mechanical integrity and influences migration. Unexpectedly, the mice also develop severe dystonia and sensory nerve degeneration typical of dystonia musculorum (dt/dt) mice. We show that in at least one other strain of dt/dt mice, BPAG1 gene is defective."
https://openalex.org/W2073483575,"Topoisomerase II (topo II) catalyzes the decatenation of interlinked DNA molecules and is essential for chromosome segregation. To test the hypothesis that the noncatalytic C-terminal domain of topo II is necessary for mediating interactions with other proteins required for chromosome segregation, we used a two-hybrid cloning strategy to identify proteins that interact with S. cerevisiae topo II in vivo. One protein identified (Sgs1p) is structurally related to E. coli RecQ protein and contains helicase signature motifs. Strains lacking Sgs1p exhibit elevated levels of chromosome misseggregation during both mitotic and meiotic division. We propose a model to account for the interaction of a topoisomerase and a helicase in the faithful segregation of newly replicated eukaryotic chromosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2016914965,"Two interleukin-2 receptor-dependent signaling pathways have thus far been identified: the c-fos/c-jun induction pathway mediated by src family protein-tyrosine kinases and the c-myc induction pathway. Here, we provide evidence for the existence of a third, rapamycin-sensitive pathway, which results in the induction of another proto-oncogene, bcl-2. In the hematopoietic cell line BAF-B03, the expression of any two of lckF505 (an active form of p56lck), Bcl-2, or c-Myc is sufficient to promote transit of the cell cycle, regardless of the activation state of the third pathway. We also provide evidence that epidermal growth factor receptor signaling may act through the same pathway that involves p56lck. These studies demonstrate a novel approach to dissecting signaling pathways regulating cellular proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2035759917,"We have isolated cDNAs and raised antibodies corresponding to the human homologs of the S. cerevisiae CDC27 and CDC16 proteins, which are tetratrico peptide repeat (TPR)-containing proteins essential for mitosis in budding yeast. We find that the CDC27Hs and CDC16Hs proteins colocalize to the centrosome at all stages of the mammalian cell cycle, and to the mitotic spindle. Injection of affinity-purified anti-CDC27Hs antibodies into logarithmically growing HeLa cells causes a highly reproducible cell cycle arrest in metaphase with apparently normal spindle structure. We conclude that CDC27 and CDC16 are evolutionarily conserved components of the centrosome and mitotic spindle that control the onset of postmetaphase events during mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W2032733531,"Calcium mobilization from intracellular pools couples many stimuli to responses in plant cells. Cyclic adenosine 5′-diphosphoribose (cADPR), which interacts with a ryanodine receptor in certain animal cells, was shown to elicit calcium release at the vacuolar membrane of beet storage root. The vacuolar calcium release pathway showed similarities to cADPR-gated calcium release in animal cells, including inhibition by ruthenium red, ryanodine activation, and high affinity for cADPR [Michaelis constant (Km) = 24 ± 7 nanomolar]. Analysis by patch-clamping demonstrated that the cADPR-gated pathway in beet is voltage-dependent over the physiological range, does not spontaneously desensitize, and is colocalized with an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3)-gated calcium release pathway in individual vacuoles."
https://openalex.org/W2040118711,"Fragile X syndrome is the result of the unstable expansion of a trinucleotide repeat in the 5'-untranslated region of the FMR1 gene. Fibroblast subclones from a mildly affected patient, each containing stable FMR1 alleles with 57 to 285 CGG repeats, were shown to exhibit normal steady-state levels of FMR1 messenger RNA. However, FMR protein was markedly diminished from transcript with more than 200 repeats. Such transcripts were associated with stalled 40S ribosomal subunits. These results suggest that a structural RNA transition beyond 200 repeats impedes the linear 40S migration along the 5'-untranslated region. This results in translational inhibition by trinucleotide repeat expansion."
https://openalex.org/W2040249554,"In yeast strains bearing the point mutation called GAL11P (for potentiator), certain GAL4 derivatives lacking any classical activating region work as strong activators. The P mutation confers upon GAL11, a component of the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme, the ability to interact with a portion of the dimerization region of GAL4. The region of GAL11 affected by the P mutation is evidently functionally inert in ordinary cells, suggesting that this mutation is of no functional significance beyond creating an artificial target for the GAL4 dimerization fragment. From these observations and further analyses of GAL11, we propose that a single activator-holoenzyme contact can trigger gene activation simply by recruiting the latter to DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2049130730,"Lipids and proteins were found to contact a nascent type II membrane protein, as well as a nascent secretory protein, during their insertion into the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. This suggests that the protein-conducting channel is open laterally toward the lipid bilayer during an early stage of protein insertion. Contact to lipids was confined to the hydrophobic core region of the respective signal or signal anchor sequence. Thus, the nascent polypeptide is positioned in the translocation complex such that the signal or signal anchor sequence faces the lipid bilayer, whereas the hydrophilic, translocating portion is in proteinaceous environment."
https://openalex.org/W1978310624,Advancement of RNA polymerase of E. coli occurs in alternating laps of monotonic and inchworm-like movement. Cycles of inchworming are encoded in DNA and involve straining and relaxation of the ternary complex accompanied by characteristic leaping of DNA and RNA footprints. We demonstrate that the oligo(T) tract that constitutes a normal part of transcription terminators acts as an inchworming signal so that the leap coincides with the termination event. Prevention of leaping with a roadblock of cleavage-defective EcoRI protein results in suppression of RNA chain release at a termination site. The results indicate that straining and relaxation of RNA polymerase are steps in the termination mechanism.
https://openalex.org/W1987222908,"Because Mars does not have a strong intrinsic magnetic field, the atmosphere is eroded by interactions with the solar wind. Early solar-system conditions enhanced the sputtering loss. It is calculated that approximately 3 bars of carbon dioxide (CO2) have been sputtered over the last 3.5 billion years. This significant increase over the previous estimate by Luhmann et al. of approximately 0.14 bar of CO2 is the result of the development of a more complete model. The model also predicts slightly greater loss of water--approximately 80 meters instead of the approximately 50 meters predicted by Luhmann et al. Because estimates of CO2 on early Mars range from 0.5 to 5 bars, the 0.14-bar estimate is insignificant but the approximately 3-bar estimate will have a large effect on our understanding of the planet's evolution."

https://openalex.org/W1995183118,"Under prebiotic conditions, formaldehyde adds to uracil at the C-5 position to produce 5-hydroxymethyluracil with favorable rates and equilibria. Hydroxymethyluracil adds a variety of nucleophiles, such as ammonia, glycine, guanidine, hydrogen sulfide, hydrogen cyanide, imidazole, indole, and phenol, to give 5-substituted uracils with the side chains of most of the 20 amino acids in proteins. These reactions are sufficiently robust that, if uracil had been present on the primitive Earth, then these substituted uracils would also have been present. The ribozymes of the RNA world would have included many of the functional groups found in proteins today, and their catalytic activities may have been considerably greater than presently assumed."
