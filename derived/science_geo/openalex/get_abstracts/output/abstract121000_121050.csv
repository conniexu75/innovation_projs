https://openalex.org/W2061052988,"Protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes translocate to unique subcellular sites following activation. We previously suggested that translocation of activated isozymes is required for their function and that in addition to binding to lipids, translocation involves binding of the activated isozymes to specific anchoring proteins (receptors for activated protein kinase C. Using cultured cardiomyocytes we identified inhibitors, the V1 fragment of ϵPKC (ϵV1), and an 8-amino acid peptide derived from it that selectively inhibited the translocation of ϵPKC. Inhibition of ϵPKC translocation but not inhibition of δ or βPKC translocation specifically blocked phorbol ester- or norepinephrine-mediated regulation of contraction. These isozyme-selective translocation inhibitors provide novel tools to determine the function of individual PKC isozymes in intact cells.

https://openalex.org/W2068615953,"NCX3 is the third isoform of a mammalian Na+-Ca2+ exchanger to be cloned. NCX3 was identified from rat brain cDNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using degenerate primers derived from the sequences of two conserved regions of NCX1 and NCX2. The NCX3 PCR product was used to isolate two overlapping clones totalling 4.8 kilobases (kb) from a rat brain cDNA library. The overlapping clones were sequenced and joined at a unique Bsp106I restriction enzyme site to form a full-length cDNA clone. The NCX3 cDNA clone has an open reading frame of 2.8 kb encoding a protein of 927 amino acids. At the amino acid level, NCX3 shares 73% identity with NCX1 and 75% identity with NCX2 and is predicted to share the same membrane topology as NCX1 and NCX2. Following addition of a poly(A)+ tail to the NCX3 clone, exchanger activity could be expressed in Xenopus oocytes. NCX3 was also expressed in the mammalian BHK cell line. NCX3 transcripts are 6 kb in size and are highly restricted to brain and skeletal muscle. Linkage analysis in the mouse indicated that the NCX family of genes is dispersed, since the NCX1, NCX2, and NCX3 genes mapped to mouse chromosomes 17, 7, and 12, respectively.

Two mammalian isoforms, NCX1 (Nicoll et al., 33Nicoll D.A. Longoni S. Philipson K.D. Science. 1990; 250: 562-565Google Scholar) and NCX2 (Li et al., 26Li Z. Matsuoka S. Hryshko L.V. Nicoll D.A. Bersohn M.M. Burke E.P. Lifton R.P. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17434-17439Google Scholar), represent the products of distinct genes. NCX1 is predominantly expressed in heart, where it plays a major role in excitation-contraction coupling, but is also abundant in a variety of other tissues. Extensive alternative splicing generates tissue-specific variants of NCX1 (Gabellini et al., 9Gabellini N. Iwata T. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6917-6924Google Scholar; Kofuji et al., 19Kofuji P. Lederer W.J. Schulze D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5145-5149Google Scholar; Lee et al., 1994). In contrast, expression of NCX2 seems to be restricted to brain and skeletal muscle (Li et al., 26Li Z. Matsuoka S. Hryshko L.V. Nicoll D.A. Bersohn M.M. Burke E.P. Lifton R.P. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17434-17439Google Scholar). Two nonmammalian NCX isoforms have also been cloned: one from Drosophila (Valdivia et al., 41Valdivia C. Kofuji P. Kirby M. Lederer W.J. Schulze D.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar) and another from squid (He et al., 12He Z. Doering A. Lu L. Philipson K.D. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: A201Google Scholar).The NCX1 protein has been studied in considerable detail. NCX1 contains 11 putative transmembrane segments (Nicoll et al., 33Nicoll D.A. Longoni S. Philipson K.D. Science. 1990; 250: 562-565Google Scholar) preceded by a cleaved signal peptide (Durkin et al., 7Durkin J.T. Ahrens D.C. Pan Y.C. Reeves J.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 290: 369-375Google Scholar; Hryshko et al., 15Hryshko L.V. Nicoll D.A. Weiss J.N. Philipson K.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1151: 35-42Google Scholar). There is a long, intracellular loop (sometimes called loop f) between transmembrane segments 5 and 6. NCX1 is inhibited by a peptide called XIP (Li et al., 24Li Z. Nicoll D.A. Collins A. Hilgemann D.W. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. Weiss J.N. Tomich J.M. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1014-1020Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of XIP corresponds to a 20-amino acid segment of NCX1 in loop f called the endogenous XIP region. NCX1 has two internal repeats called the α- and β-repeats. 2E. Schwarz and S. Benzer, personal communication. The α-1 and α-2 motifs are in transmembrane segments 2-3 and 8-9, respectively. The α-repeats are involved in the ion binding/translocation reactions of the exchanger (Nicoll et al., 34Nicoll D.A. Hryshko L.V. Matsuoka S. Frank J.S. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13385-13391Google Scholar). The β-1 and β-2 motifs are in loop f. NCX1 is regulated by intracellular Ca2+ at a site which is distinct from the Ca2+ transport site (Levitsky et al., 23Levitsky D.O. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22847-22852Google Scholar; Matsuoka et al., 30Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. Reilly R.F. Hilgemann D.W. Philipson K.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The binding site for regulatory Ca2+ has been determined to be in loop f and is comprised of β-1 and residues between β-1 and β-2. Two groups of three acidic amino acid residues in the Ca2+-binding domain appear to be directly involved in ion binding (Levitsky et al., 23Levitsky D.O. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2038912397,"CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α (C/EBPα) is a transcription factor that has been implicated in the regulation of cell-specific gene expression mainly in hepatocytes and adipocytes but also in several other terminally differentiated cells. It has been previously demonstrated that the C/EBPα protein is functionally indispensable, as inactivation of the C/EBPα gene by homologous recombination in mice results in the death of animals homozygous for the mutation shortly after birth (Wang, N., Finegold, M.

Here we show that C/EBPα−1−mice have defects in the control of hepatic growth and lung development. The liver architecture is disturbed, with acinar formation, in a pattern suggestive of either regenerating liver or pseudoglandular hepatocellular carcinoma. Pulmonary histology shows hyperproliferation of type II pneumocytes and disturbed alveolar architecture. At the molecular level, accumulation of glycogen and lipids in the liver and adipose tissues is impaired, and the mutant animals are severely hypoglycemic. Levels of c-myc and c-jun RNA are specifically induced by several fold in the livers of the C/EBPα−/− animals, indicating an active proliferative stage. Furthermore, immunohistologic detection with an antibody to proliferating cell nuclear antigen/cyclin shows a 5-10 times higher frequency of positively stained hepatocytes in C/EBPα−/− liver.

https://openalex.org/W2123116985,"Peroxisomal genetic disorders, such as Zellweger syndrome, are characterized by defects in one or more enzymes involved in the peroxisomal beta-oxidation of very long chain fatty acids and are associated with defective peroxisomal biogenesis. The biologic role of peroxisomal beta-oxidation system, which consists of three enzymes: fatty acyl-CoA oxidase (ACOX), enoyl-CoA hydratase/3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HD), and thiolase, has been examined in mice by disrupting ACOX gene, which encodes the first and rate-limiting enzyme of this system. Homozygous (ACOX -/-) mice lacked the expression of ACOX protein and accumulate very long chain fatty acids in blood. However, these homozygous mice are viable, but growth-retarded and infertile. During the first 3-4 months of age, the livers of ACOX -/- mice reveal severe microvesicular fatty metamorphosis of hepatocytes. In such steatotic cells, peroxisome assembly is markedly defective; as a result, they contain few or no peroxisomes. Few hepatocytes in 1-3-month-old ACOX -/- mice contain numerous peroxisomes, and these peroxisome-rich hepatocytes show no fatty change. At this stage, the basal mRNA levels of HD, thiolase, and other peroxisome proliferator-induced target genes were elevated in ACOX -/- mouse liver, but these mice, when treated with a peroxisome proliferator, showed no increases in the number of hepatic peroxisomes and in the mRNAs levels of these target genes. Between 4 and 5 months of age, severe steatosis resulted in scattered cell death, steatohepatitis, formation of lipogranulomas, and focal hepatocellular regeneration. In 6-7-month-old animals, the newly emerging hepatocytes, which progressively replaced steatotic cells, revealed spontaneous peroxisome proliferation. These livers showed marked increases in the mRNA levels of the remaining two genes of the beta-oxidation system, suggesting that ACOX gene disruption leads to increased endogenous ligand-mediated transcription levels. These observations demonstrate links among peroxisomal beta-oxidation, development of severe microvesicular fatty liver, peroxisome assembly, cell death, and cell proliferation in liver."
https://openalex.org/W2021622661,"Normal cell development depends to a large part on multifunctional proteins that have evolved by recombination of proven modular elements. We now have discovered and characterized in rabbit such a multi-domain protein, and classify it as novel member of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene family. The extracellular portion of the ~250-kDa membrane protein, termed LR11, contains a cluster of 11 LDL receptor ligand binding repeats, a group of 5 LDL receptor “YWTD” repeats, a large hexarepeat domain of structural elements found in neural cell adhesion molecules, and a domain with similarity to a yeast receptor for vacuolar protein sorting, VPS10. The cytoplasmic domain exhibits features typical of endocytosis-competent coated-pit receptors. The mosaic, and presumably multifunctional, receptor is expressed abundantly in brain, in particular the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, and cerebral cortex, and is present at significant levels in liver, adrenal glands, and testis. Western blotting of tissues and ligand blotting of LR11-transfected cells demonstrated that the novel protein binds apolipoprotein E-containing lipoproteins. In contrast to the LDL receptor, hepatic expression of LR11 is unaffected by hyperlipidemia. The identification of this highly conserved and superbly complex protein offers the opportunity to gain new insights into the emergence of multifunctional mosaic proteins akin to the ever expanding LDL receptor gene family.

The identification of this highly conserved and superbly complex protein offers the opportunity to gain new insights into the emergence of multifunctional mosaic proteins akin to the ever expanding LDL receptor gene family.

Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Google Scholar). In contrast to the clarity of our understanding of LDLR function, the physiological roles of new LDLR homologues, which have been identified in the past decade and form the ever expanding LDLR gene family, are far from being established. Their apparently much more diverse functions are indicated by a wide range of possible ligands, which include spent, biologically inactive and/or unwanted plasma carrier complexes and complex proteins, certain toxins, yolk precursors, as well as circulating plasma lipoproteins (reviewed in Krieger and Herz (35Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Google Scholar), Schneider and Nimpf (61Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1993; 4: 205-209Google Scholar), Moestrup (44Moestrup S.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 197-213Google Scholar), and Schneider (62Schneider W.J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1995; 6: 92-96Google Scholar)). The bewildering array of ligands they can bind, at least in vitro, is probably due to their highly variable content of different numbers and combinations of common structural elements.To date, these identified common structural modules are (i) the so-called “LDLR ligand binding repeats,” complement-type domains consisting of ~40 residues displaying a triple-disulfide bond-stabilized negatively charged surface; (ii) epidermal growth factor precursor-type repeats, also containing six cysteines each; (iii) modules of ~50 residues each, most often in groups of five, with a consensus tetrapeptide, Tyr-Trp-Thr-Asp (LDLR “YWTD” repeats); and (iv) in the cytoplasmic region, signals for receptor internalization via coated pits, containing the consensus tetrapeptide Asn-Pro-Xaa-Tyr (NPXY) (Chen et al., 11Chen W.-J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3116-3123Google Scholar).The best characterized binding domain is that of the LDLR, which consists of seven complement-type repeats and recognizes apolipoprotein (apo) B and apoE (Russel et al., 1989). LDLR family members harbor from 1 to 4 clusters with varying numbers of ligand binding repeats. To date, the family includes in addition to the LDLR, the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) receptor (Takahashi et al., 67Takahashi S. Kawarabayasi Y. Nakai T. Sakai J. Yamamoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9252-9256Google Scholar; Bujo et al., 8Bujo H. Hermann M. Kaderli M.O. Jacobsen L. Sugawara S. Nimpf J. Yamamoto T. Schneider W.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5165-5175Google Scholar), Drosophila yolkless (Yl) (Schonbaum et al., 63Schonbaum C.P. Lee S. Mahowald A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1485-1489Google Scholar), LDLR related protein/α2-macroglobulin receptor (LRP) (Herz et al. 20Herz J. Hamann U. Rogne S. Myklebost O. Gausepohl H. Stanley K.K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4119-4127Google Scholar), the Caenorhabditis elegans LRP-like gene (Yochem and Greenwald, 75Yochem J. Greenwald I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4572-4576Google Scholar), and gp330/megalin (Saito et al., 58Saito A. Pietromonaco S. Loo A.K.-C. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9725-9729Google Scholar). Extensive studies on the ligand specificities of these proteins have shown that they likely are multifunctional receptors, cellular uptake of plasma lipoproteins being just one of their tasks. For instance, one of the functionally best documented receptor, the chicken oocytes' eight ligand binding repeat receptor, termed LR8 (Bujo et al., 10Bujo H. Lindstedt K.A. Hermann M. Dalmau L.M. Nimpf J. Schneider W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23546-23551Google Scholar), takes up the yolk precursors, riboflavin binding protein (Mac Lachlan et al., 37Mac Lachlan I. Nimpf J. Schneider W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24127-24132Google Scholar), α2-macroglobulin (Jacobsen et al., 26Jacobsen L. Hermann M. Vieira P.M. Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6468-6475Google Scholar), VLDL, and vitellogenin (Bujo et al., 8Bujo H. Hermann M. Kaderli M.O. Jacobsen L. Sugawara S. Nimpf J. Yamamoto T. Schneider W.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5165-5175Google Scholar). Chicken LR8 also recognizes the iron-binding protein, lactoferrin (Hiesberger et al., 21Hiesberger T. Hermann M. Jacobsen L. Novak S. Hodits R.A. Bujo H. Meilinger M. Hüttinger M. Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18219-18226Google Scholar). Importantly, a mutation in LR8 (ovr−) lends genetic proof to LR8's function as yolk precursor transporter: it causes female sterility (non-laying) and severe hyperlipidemia with associated premature atherosclerosis (Bujo et al., 9Bujo H. Yamamoto T. Hayashi K. Hermann M. Nimpf J. Schneider W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9905-9909Google Scholar).Without question, the ligand binding repeats are the most characteristic structural modules of the LDLR gene family. However, in a wide variety of species these subdomains have been shuffled into proteins whose functions seem to be unrelated to lipoprotein metabolism. Among these are several proteins of the blood complement system (Haefliger et al. (19Haefliger J.-A. Tschopp J. Nardelli D. Wahli W. Kocher H.-P. Tosi M. Stanley K.K. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 3551-3556Google Scholar), reviewed in Hobbs et al. (22Hobbs H.H. Russell D.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1990; 24: 133-170Google Scholar)); a basement membrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan, perlecan (Noonan et al., 47Noonan D.M. Fulle A. Valente P. Cai S. Horigan E. Sasaki M. Yamada Y. Hassell J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22939-22947Google Scholar; Kallunki and Tryggvason, 28Kallunki P. Tryggvason K. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 559-571Google Scholar); a rat apical early endosomal glycoprotein (Speelman et al., 64Speelman B.A. Allen K. Grounds T.L. Neutra M.R. Kirchhausen T. Wilson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1583-1588Google Scholar); a cortical granule protein in sea urchin (Wessel, 72Wessel G.M. Dev. Biol. 1995; 167: 388-397Google Scholar); a linker chain of earthworm hemoglobin (Suzuki and Riggs, 66Suzuki T. Riggs A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13548-13555Google Scholar); a G-protein coupled receptor in the ganglion of Lymnaea (Tensen et al., 70Tensen C.P. van Kesteren E.R. Planta R.J. Cox K.J.A. Burke J.F. van Heerikhuizen H. Vreugdenhil E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4816-4820Google Scholar); and a chicken rous sarcoma virus receptor (Bates et al., 4Bates P. Young J.A.T. Varmus H.E. Cell. 1993; 74: 1043-1051Google Scholar). Thus, the complement-type repeats in the LDLR are shared by a number of proteins that participate in diverse biological processes. For instance, the occurrence of complement-type repeats together with EGF precursor homology domain(s) in some extracellular matrix proteins, such as perlecan, suggests that certain family members might be involved in cell growth and cellular attachment.We now have discovered a novel and unusually complex member of the LDLR gene family from rabbit. The predominant domain of the type I membrane protein consists of a cluster of 11 LDLR ligand binding repeats; according to our preferred nomenclature which avoids confusing and/or unproven ligand designations (Bujo et al., 10Bujo H. Lindstedt K.A. Hermann M. Dalmau L.M. Nimpf J. Schneider W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23546-23551Google Scholar), the new receptor is termed LR11. It also contains sequences highly homologous to a yeast receptor for vacuolar protein sorting, and to cellular adhesion molecules. Highly expressed in brain, LR11 and a 130-kDa receptor, LR8B (Novak et al., 49Novak S. Hiesberger T. Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11732-11736Google Scholar) are proposed to be members of a hitherto unknown branch of the LDLR gene family which may participate in brain-specific physiological processes.DISCUSSIONGenetic and structural elements defining the LDLR supergene family are widespread. Family members identified so far are products of genes that are either entirely made up of elements found in the LDLR itself or in which the complement-type repeats contribute only a minor portion to the overall structure. It is believed that the wide variety of ligands that interact with LDLR family members do so via these complement-type repeats; information on the functional contribution of additional protein domains may be obtained from genes in which LDLR- and non-LDLR elements are present in novel combinations. In the present study, we have identified the product of exactly such a gene in rabbit, LR11, which is a striking mosaic protein containing several structural elements so far not found in LDLR gene family members.The elements that put LR11 in the LDLR gene family, domains III and IV, are located in the center of the molecule and display three unusual features. First, they are separated by a hitherto unknown short domain containing 8 cysteine residues, rather than by 6-cysteine “EGF precursor type-B” repeats (Herz et al., 20Herz J. Hamann U. Rogne S. Myklebost O. Gausepohl H. Stanley K.K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4119-4127Google Scholar) typifying LDLR family members described to date. To our knowledge, entactin/nidogen (Durkin et al., 14Durkin M.E. Chakravarti S. Bartos B.B. Liu S.-H. Friedman R.L. Chung A.E. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2749-2756Google Scholar; Mann et al., 38Mann K. Deutzmann R. Aumailley M. Timpl R. Raimondi L. Yamada Y. Pan T. Conway D. Chu M.-L. EMBO. J. 1989; 8: 65-72Google Scholar) and the sevenless protein (Norton et al., 48Norton P.A. Hynes R.O. Rees D.J.G. Cell. 1990; 61: 15-16Google Scholar) are the only other proteins with YWTD repeats that lack the typical flanking type-B repeats. In nidogen/entactin, a major component of basement membranes, the YWTD repeats are involved in binding to another protein in the basement membrane, laminin (Fox et al., 16Fox J.W. Mayer U. Nischt R. Aumailley M. Reinhardt D. Wiedemann H. Mann K. Timpl R. Krieg T. Engel J. Chu M.-L. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3137-3146Google Scholar). In laminin, the site responsible for binding to nidogen/entactin is located to a single “EGF-like repeat” with 8 cysteines (Mayer et al., 41Mayer U. Nischt R. Pöschl E. Mann K. Fukuda K. Gerl M. Yamada Y. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1879-1885Google Scholar). These findings raise the possibility that LR11 may interact via domain III with other cell surface (glyco)proteins.Second, groups of five YWTD repeats (domain III in LR11) have been found so far either downstream, or downstream and upstream from the ligand binding repeat cluster (domain IV in LR11). The presence of the YWTD repeats only at the amino-terminal side of the LR11 binding repeat cluster suggests, on the one hand, substantial domain shuffling, and on the other hand, that multi-repeat modules are conserved because they function as such.Third, LRP (Herz et al., 20Herz J. Hamann U. Rogne S. Myklebost O. Gausepohl H. Stanley K.K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4119-4127Google Scholar), the C. elegans putative LRP like-gene product (Yochem and Greenwald, 75Yochem J. Greenwald I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4572-4576Google Scholar), and gp330/megalin (Saito et al., 58Saito A. Pietromonaco S. Loo A.K.-C. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9725-9729Google Scholar) are the only other proteins that contain clusters of 11 complement-type repeats. In the clusters of these receptors, certain repeats are separated from each other by amino acid stretches called “linker regions” (Südhof et al., 65Südhof T.C. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Russel D.W. Science. 1985; 228: 815-822Google Scholar). LR11 appears to lack a typical linker region; there are, however, a few extra residues preceding repeats 9 (residues 1043-1048) and 10 (residues 1453-1960), respectively.Of interest are also the features of domain V, which consists of 6 FNIII modules (Fig. 5A) originally defined as 90-residue units repeated 15 times in fibronectin (Kornblihtt et al., 30Kornblihtt A.R. Umezawa K. Vibe-Pedersen K. Baralle F.E. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1755-1759Google Scholar). Two FNIII repeats in LR11 are particularly similar to the repeats in N-CAMs, murine L1 and its homologues (Fig. 5B). A number of extracellular matrix proteins and receptors contain FNIII repeats, including neural cell adhesion molecules, insulin receptor family members, and several receptor tyrosine kinases and phosphatases (O'Bryan et al., 50O'Bryan J.P. Frye R.A. Cogswell P.C. Neubauer A. Kitch B. Prokop C. Espinosa III, R. Le Beau M.M. Earp H.S. Liu E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5016-5031Google Scholar). The presence of these repeats in cell adhesion molecules and receptors for cell growth and attachment further suggests a potential role of LR11 in cell-cell interaction.The amino-terminal domain (domain I), to our knowledge, lacks homologous sequences in current data bases. It is notable, however, that the rabbit LR11 protein has an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) tripeptide in this domain (Fig. 1), as this tripeptide is also found in L1 and homologues (Moos et al., 45Moos M. Tacke R. Scherer H. Teplow D. Früh K. Schachner M. Nature. 1988; 334: 701-703Google Scholar; Ruppert et al., 56Ruppert M. Aigner S. Hubbe M. Yagita H. Altevogt P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1881-1891Google Scholar). The presence of structural features of neural adhesion molecules, together with the high expression of the LR11 mRNA in brain, are compatible with an involvement of LR11 in neuron-neuron adhesion and/or outgrowth of neurites, as suggested for N-CAMs and L1s (Goridis and Brunet, 18Goridis C. Brunet J.-F. Semin. Cell Biol. 1992; 3: 189-197Google Scholar).In the cytoplasmic domain, LR11 has a putative internalization signal, Phe-Ala-Asn-Ser-His-Tyr (FANSHY), highly reminiscent of the sequence FDNPXY, the common internalization signal of LDLR gene family members (Chen et al., 11Chen W.-J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3116-3123Google Scholar). The Asn and Tyr residues, conserved in LR11, have been reported to be crucial for the formation of a β-turn structure required for internalization (Chen et al., 11Chen W.-J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3116-3123Google Scholar; Bansal and Gierasch, 2Bansal A. Gierasch L.M. Cell. 1991; 67: 1195-1201Google Scholar). Furthermore, the hexapeptide signal in LR11 is similar to that in the macrophage mannose receptor (FENTLY). Taylor et al. (69Taylor M.E. Conary J.T. Lennartz M.R. Stahl P.D. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12156-12162Google Scholar) and Naim and Roth (46Naim H.Y. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3928-3933Google Scholar) reported that sequence requirements for internalization of receptors via tyrosine-containing signals are even more relaxed. Interestingly, similar motifs in the cytoplasmic regions of the β-subunits of integrins play key roles in the interaction between integrins and cytoskeletal proteins (Filardo et al., 15Filardo E.J. Brooks P.C. Deming S.L. Damsky C. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 441-450Google Scholar; O'Toole et al., 51O'Toole T.E. Ylanne J. Culley B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8553-8558Google Scholar). Although further studies are needed to determine the role of the consensus motif in LR11, the characteristic signature sequence, together with clusters of charged residues in the cytoplasmic domain also found in other LDLR gene family members (Fig. 4B), strongly suggest that the LR11 protein is an endocytosis-competent receptor. Notably, clustered negatively charged amino acids in context with a tyrosine residue, shown to be important for basolateral sorting of the LDLR (Matter et al., 40Matter K. Hunziker W. Mellman I. Cell. 1992; 71: 741-753Google Scholar), are absent from the cytoplasmic domain of LR11.The yeast gene VPS10 encodes a sorting receptor for the proteinase carboxypeptidase Y. VPS10 is proposed to execute multiple rounds of targeting by cycling between the late Golgi and a prevacuolar endosome-like compartment (Marcusson et al., 39Marcusson E.G. Horazdovsky B.F. Cereghino J.L. Gharakhanian E. Emr S.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 579-586Google Scholar). The lumenal domain of VPS10 contains two imperfectly repeated sequences, each followed by a cysteine-rich motif (Horazdovsky et al., 23Horazdovsky B.F. DeWald D.B. Emr S.D. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1995; 7: 544-551Google Scholar). Surprisingly, domain II of LR11 shows striking similarities to both VPS10-repeats including their cysteine-rich regions. The sequence Phe-Tyr-Val-Phe in VPS10, which may function as Golgi retention/retrieval signal (Horazdovsky et al., 23Horazdovsky B.F. DeWald D.B. Emr S.D. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1995; 7: 544-551Google Scholar), is not found in LR11. Because the lumenal region of the VPS10 protein is suggested to be involved in carboxypeptidase Y binding (Horazdovsky et al., 23Horazdovsky B.F. DeWald D.B. Emr S.D. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1995; 7: 544-551Google Scholar), the homologous region in LR11, proposed to be extracellular, may be a site for ligand-receptor interaction(s). We can only begin to speculate what such ligand(s), if they exist, might be. LRP, e.g. is able to bind soluble proteinase/proteinase inhibitor complexes (Krieger and Herz, 35Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Google Scholar); domain II of LR11 could participate in (transient) binding to proteinases or proteinase-like molecules on the cell surface of adjacent cells. Although vacuolar protein sorting in yeast and lysosomal protein sorting in certain mammalian cell types seem to share similar mechanisms and proteins, any involvement of the VPS10 domain in LR11's intracellular and/or vesicle-mediated routing must remain highly speculative.Although the complex structure of LR11 and sterol-insensitivity suggest a function(s) other than in lipoprotein metabolism, its abundance in tissues with active cholesterol metabolism, such as brain, liver, and adrenal glands, in which the LDLR is also highly expressed (Yamamoto et al., 74Yamamoto T. Bishop R.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Russell D.W. Science. 1986; 232: 1230-1237Google Scholar; Pitas et al., 53Pitas R.E. Boyles J.K. Lee S.H. Hui D. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14352-14360Google Scholar) requires attention. In any case, the fact that β-VLDL, known to interact with LDLR relatives via its apoE moiety, binds to LR11 efficiently, allows for the first time to conclude that a type-B repeat downstream of an 11-ligand binding repeat cluster is not required for apoE-binding in vitro. Recently, Kounnas et al. (31Kounnas M.Z. Moir R.D. Rebeck G.W. Bush A.I. Argraves W.S. Tanzi R.E. Hyman B.T. Strickland D.K. Cell. 1995; 82: 331-340Google Scholar) reported that LRP binds, in addition to many other possible ligands, β-amyloid precursor protein and mediates its degradation in vitro. In the absence of a transgenic animal model, we cannot determine which ligand(s) may be the true physiological partner(s) of LR11. The localization of rabbit (Fig. 8) and human (data not shown) LR11 in the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, and cerebral cortex suggests functional significance in metabolically active brain regions. For instance, glutamate receptors, thought to play key roles in active brain functions such as learning (Bliss and Collingridge, 6Bliss T.V.P. Collingridge G.L. Nature. 1993; 361: 31-39Google Scholar), are highly expressed in the same brain structures (Meguro et al., 42Meguro H. Mori H. Araki K. Kushiya E. Kutsuwada T. Yamazaki M. Kumanishi T. Arakawa M. Sakimura K. Mishina M. Nature. 1992; 357: 70-74Google Scholar).Thus, LR11 in rabbit as well as in man and chicken, 2S. Mörwald, H. Yamazaki, H. Bujo, J. Kusunoki, T. Kanaki, K. Seimiya, N. Morisaki, J. Nimpf, W. J. Schneider, and Y. Saito, manuscript in preparation. and the recently identified LR8B in chicken and mouse (Novak et al., 49Novak S. Hiesberger T. Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11732-11736Google Scholar) appear to define a new group of LDLR family members with possible brain-specific functions. The molecular characterization of the amazingly complex LR11 opens new avenues toward the investigation of the biological significance of apparent redundancy in the expression of homologous functional units in different structural context. The extremely high degrees of similarity between the proteins from rabbit, man, and chicken2 suggests that the shuffling of evolutionarily mobile domains resulting in LR11 has not been totally random (Doolittle, 13Doolittle R.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 287-314Google Scholar). Future studies will address the question whether LR11 participates in the regulation of cell growth, particularly that of neuronal cells, and/or mediates cell-cell adhesion processes, and will attempt to identify the ligands of this interesting protein.

Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Google Scholar). In contrast to the clarity of our understanding of LDLR function, the physiological roles of new LDLR homologues, which have been identified in the past decade and form the ever expanding LDLR gene family, are far from being established. Their apparently much more diverse functions are indicated by a wide range of possible ligands, which include spent, biologically inactive and/or unwanted plasma carrier complexes and complex proteins, certain toxins, yolk precursors, as well as circulating plasma lipoproteins (reviewed in Krieger and Herz (35Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Google Scholar), Schneider and Nimpf (61Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1993; 4: 205-209Google Scholar), Moestrup (44Moestrup S.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 197-213Google Scholar), and Schneider (62Schneider W.J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1995; 6: 92-96Google Scholar)). The bewildering array of ligands they can bind, at least in vitro, is probably due to their highly variable content of different numbers and combinations of common structural elements.To date, these identified common structural modules are (i) the so-called “LDLR ligand binding repeats,” complement-type domains consisting of ~40 residues displaying a triple-disulfide bond-stabilized negatively charged surface; (ii) epidermal growth factor precursor-type repeats, also containing six cysteines each; (iii) modules of ~50 residues each, most often in groups of five, with a consensus tetrapeptide, Tyr-Trp-Thr-Asp (LDLR “YWTD” repeats); and (iv) in the cytoplasmic region, signals for receptor internalization via coated pits, containing the consensus tetrapeptide Asn-Pro-Xaa-Tyr (NPXY) (Chen et al., 11Chen W.-J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3116-3123Google Scholar).The best characterized binding domain is that of the LDLR, which consists of seven complement-type repeats and recognizes apolipoprotein (apo) B and apoE (Russel et al., 1989). LDLR family members harbor from 1 to 4 clusters with varying numbers of ligand binding repeats. To date, the family includes in addition to the LDLR, the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) receptor (Takahashi et al., 67Takahashi S. Kawarabayasi Y. Nakai T. Sakai J. Yamamoto T. Proc. Natl.

Extensive studies on the ligand specificities of these proteins have shown that they likely are multifunctional receptors, cellular uptake of plasma lipoproteins being just one of their tasks. For instance, one of the functionally best documented receptor, the chicken oocytes' eight ligand binding repeat receptor, termed LR8 (Bujo et al., 10Bujo H. Lindstedt K.A. Hermann M. Dalmau L.M. Nimpf J. Schneider W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23546-23551Google Scholar), takes up the yolk precursors, riboflavin binding protein (Mac Lachlan et al., 37Mac Lachlan I. Nimpf J. Schneider W.J. J.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5165-5175Google Scholar). Chicken LR8 also recognizes the iron-binding protein, lactoferrin (Hiesberger et al., 21Hiesberger T. Hermann M. Jacobsen L. Novak S. Hodits R.A. Bujo H. Meilinger M. Hüttinger M. Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18219-18226Google Scholar). Importantly, a mutation in LR8 (ovr−) lends genetic proof to LR8's function as yolk precursor transporter: it causes female sterility (non-laying) and severe hyperlipidemia with associated premature atherosclerosis (Bujo et al., 9Bujo H. Yamamoto T. Hayashi K. Hermann M. Nimpf J. Schneider W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9905-9909Google Scholar).Without question, the ligand binding repeats are the most characteristic structural modules of the LDLR gene family. However, in a wide variety of species these subdomains have been shuffled into proteins whose functions seem to be unrelated to lipoprotein metabolism. Among these are several proteins of the blood complement system (Haefliger et al. (19Haefliger J.-A. Tschopp J. Nardelli D. Wahli W. Kocher H.-P. Tosi M. Stanley K.K. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 3551-3556Google Scholar), reviewed in Hobbs et al. (22Hobbs H.H. Russell D.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Annu. Rev.

Varmus H.E. Cell. 1993; 74: 1043-1051Google Scholar). Thus, the complement-type repeats in the LDLR are shared by a number of proteins that participate in diverse biological processes. For instance, the occurrence of complement-type repeats together with EGF precursor homology domain(s) in some extracellular matrix proteins, such as perlecan, suggests that certain family members might be involved in cell growth and cellular attachment.We now have discovered a novel and unusually complex member of the LDLR gene family from rabbit. The predominant domain of the type I membrane protein consists of a cluster of 11 LDLR ligand binding repeats; according to our preferred nomenclature which avoids confusing and/or unproven ligand designations (Bujo et al., 10Bujo H. Lindstedt K.A. Hermann M. Dalmau L.M. Nimpf J. Schneider W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23546-23551Google Scholar), the new receptor is termed LR11. It also contains sequences highly homologous to a yeast receptor for vacuolar protein sorting, and to cellular adhesion molecules. Highly expressed in brain, LR11 and a 130-kDa receptor, LR8B (Novak et al., 49Novak S. Hiesberger T. Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11732-11736Google Scholar) are proposed to be members of a hitherto unknown branch of the LDLR gene family which may participate in brain-specific physiological processes."

INTRODUCTIONSeizure activity in the brain initiates complex pathways of signal transduction and cell-to-cell communication. Whereas a single seizure usually has little or no long-term effects on the brain, repeated and uncontrolled seizures can cause delayed neuronal death and synaptic reorganization. Activation of phospholipases and accumulation of bioactive lipids takes place early after seizures (1Bazan N.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 218: 1-10Google Scholar) primarily in synaptic endings (2Birkle D.L. Bazan N.G. J. Neurochem. 1987; 48: 1768-1778Google Scholar). Arachidonic acid and its oxygenated metabolites and platelet-activating factor are important classes of bioactive lipids generated during seizure activity (3Herrting G. Seregi A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1989; 559: 84-99Google Scholar, 4Kumar R. Harvey S. Kester N. Hanahan D. Olsen M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 963: 375-383Google Scholar) because they are known to have modulatory effects on synaptic transmission and neuronal plasticity (5Shimizu T. Wolfe L J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 1-15Google Scholar, 6Clark, G. D., Happel, L. T., Zorumski, C. F., Bazan, N. G., Neuron, 9, 1211–1216.Google Scholar, 7Kato K. Clark G.D. Bazan N.G. Zorumski C.F. Nature. 1994; 367: 179-182Google Scholar). Additionally, PAF 1The abbreviations used are: PAFplatelet-activating factorPGS-2prostaglandin G/H synthase-2, cyclooxygenase, EC1.14.99.1, COX-2, TIS-10PGS-1prostaglandin G/H synthase-1KAkainic acidECSelectroconvulsive shockicvintracerebroventricularipintraperitonealGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. is also an activator of receptor-mediated immediate early gene expression in the brain and neuronal cells (8Squinto S.P.

Thus, excitable membrane-derived bioactive lipids may have both acute and long-term effects on neuronal activity.PAF exerts its biological actions through a rhodopsin-type receptor (10Honda Z. Nakamura M. Miki I. Minami M. Wantabe T. Seyama Y. Okado H. Toh H. Ito K. Miyamoto T. Shimizu T. Nature. 1991; 394: 342-346Google Scholar). In neurons, this receptor mediates the presynaptic effects of PAF on excitatory neurotransmitter release (6Clark, G. D., Happel, L. T., Zorumski, C. F., Bazan, N. G., Neuron, 9, 1211–1216.Google Scholar), long-term potentiation (7Kato K. Clark G.D. Bazan N.G. Zorumski C.F. Nature. 1994; 367: 179-182Google Scholar, 11Wieraszko A. Li G. Kornecki E. Hogan M.V. Ehrlich Y.H. Neuron. 1993; 10: 553-557Google Scholar), and memory formation (12Jerusalinsky D. Fin C. Quillfeldt J.A. Ferreira M.B. Schmitz P.K. Da Silva R.C. Walz R. Bazan N.G. Medina J.H.

Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5047-5051Google Scholar). A high affinity PAF binding site has been found in microsomal membranes isolated from hippocampus and cerebral cortex (9Marcheselli V.L. Bazan N.G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 37: 54-61Google Scholar, 14Marcheselli V.L. Rossowska M. Domingo M.T. Braquet P. Bazan N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9140-9145Google Scholar). This site has distinct ligand binding kinetics and sensitivity to PAF receptor antagonists and may represent either an intracellular form of the plasma membrane receptor or a novel PAF receptor subtype. The intracellular PAF-binding site may be involved in the induction of immediate-early transcription factors in the hippocampus during electrically induced seizures (9Marcheselli V.L. Bazan N.G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 37: 54-61Google Scholar). Additionally, PAF activates the expression of transfected prostaglandin G/H synthase-2 (PGS-2, cyclooxygenase, COX-2) promoter constructs, and this effect is blocked by a PAF antagonist (BN 50730) selective for the intracellular site (15Bazan N.G. Fletcher B.S. Herschman H.R. Mukherjee P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5252-5256Google Scholar). PGS catalyzes the first committed step in the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins and thromboxanes. The PGS-2 isoform is normally expressed in most tissues only as a rapid and transient response to mitogenic and inflammatory stimuli, and is encoded by an immediate-early gene (16Herschman H.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 125-140Google Scholar). Brain, however, is one of the few anatomical sites in which a basal level of PGS-2 expression has been demonstrated (17Yamagata K. Andreasson K.I. Kaufmann W.E. Barnes C.A. Worley P.F. Neuron. 1993; 11: 371-386Google Scholar). This expression is localized to selected groups of neurons and is regulated by synaptic activity and, more specifically, by activation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate class of glutamate receptors (17Yamagata K. Andreasson K.I. Kaufmann W.E. Barnes C.A. Worley P.F. Neuron. 1993; 11: 371-386Google Scholar, 18Kaufmann W.E. Worley P.F. Pegg J. Bremer M. Isakson P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2317-2321Google Scholar).In this study, we tested the hypothesis that PAF is involved in the seizure-induced accumulation of PGS-2 in the brain and is thus linked to the metabolism of free arachidonic acid generated during seizures. We present evidence that PGS-2 transcriptional activity and protein expression is up-regulated in a single electrically-induced seizure (ECS) and in multiple, kainic acid (KA)-induced seizures, and that PAF is involved in this mechanism. In addition, we show that induction of PGS-2, but not the transcription factor immediate-early gene zif-268, is more sensitive to the severe KA-induced seizures than ECS in a brain region, the hippocampus, selectively vulnerable to damage in this model. Partial accounts of these results have appeared in abstract form (19Marcheselli V.L. Bazan N.G. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1994; 20: 1053Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONThe data presented here implicate PAF-stimulated signal transduction pathways as major components of the seizure-induced expression of PGS-2 in brain. We also confirm previous studies demonstrating seizure-induced increases in PGS-2 mRNA levels in brain (17Yamagata K. Andreasson K.I. Kaufmann W.E. Barnes C.A. Worley P.F. Neuron. 1993; 11: 371-386Google Scholar, 25Chen J. Marsh T. Zhang J.S. Graham S.H. NeuroReport. 1995; 6: 245-248Google Scholar, 26Adams J. Collaço-Moraes Y. de Belleroche J. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 6-13Google Scholar). In addition, we show that accumulation of PGS-2 mRNA correlates with transcriptional activation of the gene and accumulation of PGS-2 protein. Furthermore, when the effects of ECS were compared with KA-induced seizures, we demonstrate that PGS-2, but not the zinc-finger transcription factor zif-268, is subject to additional hippocampal up-regulation in the more severe seizure model.The inhibitory effect of BN 50730 on seizure-induced PGS-2 and zif-268 implies that they share a common requirement for stimulation of the intracellular form of the PAF receptor in the mechanisms by which both genes are induced under these conditions. BN 50730 is a competitive antagonist of PAF, binding to an intracellular site, but not to synaptic membranes (9Marcheselli V.L. Bazan N.G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 37: 54-61Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the different kinetics of induction and the selective increase in response of hippocampal PGS-2 induction in KA- versus ECS-induced seizures suggest that other components of the induction mechanisms are distinct. BN 50730 almost totally abolishes KA-induced PGS-2 mRNA and protein accumulation. Therefore, it is likely that PGS-2 expression responds either to increased levels of PAF and/or with an increased sensitivity of the PAF receptor. PAF induces mouse PGS-2 promoter-driven luciferase activity transfected in neuroblastoma cells (NG 108-15 or SH-SY5Y) and in NIH 3T3 cells, and BN 50730 inhibits this effect (15Bazan N.G. Fletcher B.S. Herschman H.R. Mukherjee P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5252-5256Google Scholar). Increased PAF content was detected in brain during seizures (4Kumar R. Harvey S. Kester N. Hanahan D. Olsen M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 963: 375-383Google Scholar); however, it is difficult to assess the actual increases of PAF that might occur intracellularly in the brain due to the presence of a wide variety of PAF acetylhydrolases (27Hattori M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18748-18753Google Scholar, 28Bazan N.G. Nature. 1995; 374: 501-502Google Scholar). zif-268 expression is less sensitive than PGS-2 expression to BN 50730 inhibition in the ECS model, does not show an augmented response in hippocampus in the KA model, and, in the latter model, shows little response to BN 50730. This suggests that either zif-268 is induced by different mechanisms in the two seizure models or that ECS is sufficient to maximally stimulate expression. The induction of PGS-2 in hippocampus by KA is elevated and prolonged in neuroanatomical regions known to exhibit selective neuronal apoptosis in response to this agonist (29Pollard H. Charriaut-Marlangue C. Cantagrel S. Represa A. Robain O. Moreau J. Ben-Ari Y. Neuroscience. 1994; 63: 7-18Google Scholar).PGS-2 expression in the normal rat brain is localized to the post-synaptic structures of discrete groups of neurons in the forebrain and is enriched in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex (18Kaufmann W.E. Worley P.F. Pegg J. Bremer M. Isakson P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2317-2321Google Scholar, 30Breder C.D. DeWitt D. Kraig R.P. J. Comp. Neurol. 1995; 355: 296-315Google Scholar). The onset of expression in the developing rat correlates with the early postnatal period when synaptic remodeling is most active. Even when expression is up-regulated by ECS, the mRNA is still localized to neurons and is not detected in glial or vascular cells (17Yamagata K. Andreasson K.I. Kaufmann W.E. Barnes C.A. Worley P.F. Neuron. 1993; 11: 371-386Google Scholar). Hence, the up-regulation of PGS-2 expression in response to KA is probably due to additional stimulation of the neuronal pathway by the multiple KA-induced seizures. This would suggest an atypical role for the prostaglandins generated by PGS-2 activity. PGS-2 activation is generally thought to be associated with inflammatory events, whereas the constitutive PGS-1 isoform is thought to be responsible for physiological production of prostanoids. It should be added, however, that this strict definition of the roles of the two isoforms is being reassessed (31DeWitt D. Smith W.L. Cell. 1995; 83: 345-348Google Scholar), particularly in the light of the phenotypes exhibited by knockout mice for the two PGS isoforms (32Langenbach R. Morham S.G. Tiano H.F. Loftin C.D.

Czerniak P.M. Nature. 1995; 378: 406-409Google Scholar). PGS-1 knockout mice have few phenotypic abnormalities, whereas PGS-2 knockouts have severe renal abnormalities. Thus PGS-2 is required for certain aspects of normal development. Furthermore, testing of various inflammatory models on these animals suggest that both PGS isoforms participate in inflammatory events. At this time, the neurological responses of these mice have not been reported.The major endogenous inflammatory cells of the brain are glia and microglia. Accordingly, these cell types express relatively large amounts of such components of the inflammatory cascade as secretory and cytosolic PLA2 and the PAF receptor (35Sun G.Y. Hu Z.Y. Prog. Brain.

Prostanoids synthesized through PGS-2 activation in neurons are unlikely, therefore, to be directly involved in the inflammatory response. They may, however, be involved in functions related to synaptic transmission and neuronal plasticity. Prostaglandins D2, E2, and F2α have been known for some time to have modulatory effects on neurotransmission (5Shimizu T. Wolfe L J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 1-15Google Scholar), and, more recently, prostacylin has been found to facilitate excitatory neurotransmission in the hippocampus through a novel receptor subtype (38Takechi H. Matsumura K. Watanabe Y. Kato K. Noyori R. Suzuki M. Watanabe Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5901-5906Google Scholar). Beyond this common property, however, the different prostanoids have diverse and, in some cases, antagonistic effects on the central nervous system. It is important, therefore, to know which species of prostanoids are being synthesized via neuronal PGS-2 both in physiological and pathophysiological states. Temporal changes in the patterns of prostanoids synthesized during seizures using the pilocarpine model of epileptogenesis show production of different prostanoid species at different stages during status epilepticus and the formation of recurrent seizures (39Naffah-Mazzacoratti M.G. Bellissimo M.I. Cavalheiro E.A. Neurochem. Int. 1995; 27: 461-466Google Scholar).The events in which PAF activates PGS-2 expression during seizures sets into motion pathways which can either elicit neuroprotection or lead to neuronal damage. PAF is not stored in cells but is rapidly synthesized in response to stimuli. In addition, it is a short-lived molecule, being rapidly degraded by a specific PAF acetylhydrolase (28Bazan N.G. Nature. 1995; 374: 501-502Google Scholar). Nonetheless, by inducing PGS-2, this transient signal can have long-term effects on neuronal function. The localization of PGS-2 protein in the nuclear envelope and perinuclear endoplasmic reticulum (40Reiger M.K. DeWitt D.L. Schindler M.S. Smith W.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 439-444Google Scholar) suggests that, in addition to paracrine effects on the cell-surface prostanoid receptors, the prostanoids produced through PGS-2 activation may have effects at the nucleus. Thus, PAF might be eliciting cascades of gene expression in addition to those potentially initiated by activation of transcription factor genes such as zif-268. To fully understand the significance of seizure-induced PGS-2 expression in hippocampus, the types and functions of PGS-2 derived prostanoids synthesized in response to seizures will have to be better defined. With this information, the consequences of BN 50730 inhibition of PGS-2 expression can be more fully assessed. INTRODUCTIONSeizure activity in the brain initiates complex pathways of signal transduction and cell-to-cell communication. Whereas a single seizure usually has little or no long-term effects on the brain, repeated and uncontrolled seizures can cause delayed neuronal death and synaptic reorganization. Activation of phospholipases and accumulation of bioactive lipids takes place early after seizures (1Bazan N.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 218: 1-10Google Scholar) primarily in synaptic endings (2Birkle D.L. Bazan N.G. J. Neurochem. 1987; 48: 1768-1778Google Scholar). Arachidonic acid and its oxygenated metabolites and platelet-activating factor are important classes of bioactive lipids generated during seizure activity (3Herrting G. Seregi A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1989; 559: 84-99Google Scholar, 4Kumar R. Harvey S. Kester N. Hanahan D. Olsen M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 963: 375-383Google Scholar) because they are known to have modulatory effects on synaptic transmission and neuronal plasticity (5Shimizu T. Wolfe L J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 1-15Google Scholar, 6Clark, G. D., Happel, L. T., Zorumski, C. F., Bazan, N. G., Neuron, 9, 1211–1216.Google Scholar, 7Kato K. Clark G.D. Bazan N.G. Zorumski C.F. Nature. 1994; 367: 179-182Google Scholar). Additionally, PAF 1The abbreviations used are: PAFplatelet-activating factorPGS-2prostaglandin G/H synthase-2, cyclooxygenase, EC1.14.99.1, COX-2, TIS-10PGS-1prostaglandin G/H synthase-1KAkainic acidECSelectroconvulsive shockicvintracerebroventricularipintraperitonealGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. is also an activator of receptor-mediated immediate early gene expression in the brain and neuronal cells (8Squinto S.P. Block A.L. Braquet P. Bazan N.G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1989; 24: 558-566Google Scholar, 9Marcheselli V.L. Bazan N.G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 37: 54-61Google Scholar). Thus, excitable membrane-derived bioactive lipids may have both acute and long-term effects on neuronal activity.PAF exerts its biological actions through a rhodopsin-type receptor (10Honda Z. Nakamura M. Miki I. Minami M. Wantabe T. Seyama Y. Okado H. Toh H. Ito K. Miyamoto T. Shimizu T. Nature. 1991; 394: 342-346Google Scholar). In neurons, this receptor mediates the presynaptic effects of PAF on excitatory neurotransmitter release (6Clark, G. D., Happel, L. T., Zorumski, C. F., Bazan, N. G., Neuron, 9, 1211–1216.Google Scholar), long-term potentiation (7Kato K. Clark G.D. Bazan N.G. Zorumski C.F. Nature. 1994; 367: 179-182Google Scholar, 11Wieraszko A. Li G. Kornecki E. Hogan M.V. Ehrlich Y.H. Neuron. 1993; 10: 553-557Google Scholar), and memory formation (12Jerusalinsky D. Fin C. Quillfeldt J.A. Ferreira M.B. Schmitz P.K. Da Silva R.C. Walz R. Bazan N.G. Medina J.H.

J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 37: 54-61Google Scholar, 14Marcheselli V.L. Rossowska M. Domingo M.T. Braquet P. Bazan N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9140-9145Google Scholar). This site has distinct ligand binding kinetics and sensitivity to PAF receptor antagonists and may represent either an intracellular form of the plasma membrane receptor or a novel PAF receptor subtype. The intracellular PAF-binding site may be involved in the induction of immediate-early transcription factors in the hippocampus during electrically induced seizures (9Marcheselli V.L. Bazan N.G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 37: 54-61Google Scholar). Additionally, PAF activates the expression of transfected prostaglandin G/H synthase-2 (PGS-2, cyclooxygenase, COX-2) promoter constructs, and this effect is blocked by a PAF antagonist (BN 50730) selective for the intracellular site (15Bazan N.G. Fletcher B.S. Herschman H.R. Mukherjee P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5252-5256Google Scholar). PGS catalyzes the first committed step in the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins and thromboxanes. The PGS-2 isoform is normally expressed in most tissues only as a rapid and transient response to mitogenic and inflammatory stimuli, and is encoded by an immediate-early gene (16Herschman H.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 125-140Google Scholar). Brain, however, is one of the few anatomical sites in which a basal level of PGS-2 expression has been demonstrated (17Yamagata K. Andreasson K.I. Kaufmann W.E. Barnes C.A. Worley P.F. Neuron. 1993; 11: 371-386Google Scholar). This expression is localized to selected groups of neurons and is regulated by synaptic activity and, more specifically, by activation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate class of glutamate receptors (17Yamagata K. Andreasson K.I. Kaufmann W.E. Barnes C.A. Worley P.F. Neuron. 1993; 11: 371-386Google Scholar, 18Kaufmann W.E. Worley P.F. Pegg J. Bremer M. Isakson P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2317-2321Google Scholar).In this study, we tested the hypothesis that PAF is involved in the seizure-induced accumulation of PGS-2 in the brain and is thus linked to the metabolism of free arachidonic acid generated during seizures. We present evidence that PGS-2 transcriptional activity and protein expression is up-regulated in a single electrically-induced seizure (ECS) and in multiple, kainic acid (KA)-induced seizures, and that PAF is involved in this mechanism. In addition, we show that induction of PGS-2, but not the transcription factor immediate-early gene zif-268, is more sensitive to the severe KA-induced seizures than ECS in a brain region, the hippocampus, selectively vulnerable to damage in this model. Partial accounts of these results have appeared in abstract form (19Marcheselli V.L. Bazan N.G. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1994; 20: 1053Google Scholar)."

Here, we show that FGF-2 added to nuclear extract binds to protein kinase CK2 and nucleolin, a CK2 natural substrate. Added to baculovirus-infected cell extracts overexpressing CK2 or its isolated subunits, FGF-2 binds to the enzyme through its regulatory β subunit. Using purified proteins, FGF-2 is shown to directly interact with CK2 and to stimulate CK2 activity toward nucleolin. Furthermore, a mitogenic-deficient FGF-2 mutant protein has an impaired ability to interact with CK2 and to stimulate CK2 activity using nucleolin as substrate.

Supernatant from the human myeloma cell line JJN-3 contained potent TGFβ antagonistic activity. This activity was isolated and found to be associated with a 72-78-kDa glycoprotein. Specific polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies were generated toward the 72-78-kDa protein, and these antibodies precipitated the TGFβ inhibitory activity from JJN-3 supernatant. Upon amino acid sequencing the protein appeared to be identical to hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and some of the generated antibodies directly blocked the action of recombinant HGF in various assays. By HGF-specific polymerase chain reaction we demonstrated that HGF mRNA was expressed in five out of five tested myeloma cell lines. The level of HGF protein in supernatants showed great variation from >500 ng/ml in JJN-3 supernatant to a few ng/ml in the supernatants from other myeloma cell lines. The same five cell lines were also screened for expression the HGF receptor c-MET. Four of them expressed the receptor as shown by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. The receptor was shown to be constitutively phosphorylated in the human myeloma cell line JJN-3. This receptor could be dephosphorylated by anti-HGF antibodies, indicating the existence of an autocrine HGF loop in this cell line. We propose that HGF/c-MET may play a role in multiple myeloma.

Multiple myeloma, a malignant disease that involves proliferation of monoclonal plasma cells, is associated with several clinical manifestations such as skeletal pathology, anemia, hypercalcemia, and renal dysfunction. The cause of these features of the disease is only partly understood, but production of soluble factors by the myeloma cells is likely to be involved. In screening for unknown myeloma-produced factors, we noticed that several supernatants from myeloma cell lines counteracted the growth inhibiting effect of TGFβ on the mink lung cells Mv-1-Lu. Here we report the purification and characterization of this activity from the supernatant of the human myeloma cell line JJN-3. The activity was associated with a 72-78-kDa protein, which upon sequencing appeared to be identical to hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). 1The abbreviations used are: HGFhepatocyte growth factorCMcomplete mediumPCRpolymerase chain reactionRTreverse transcriptaseTGFβtransforming growth factor-βPBSphosphate-buffered saline. hepatocyte growth factor complete medium polymerase chain reaction reverse transcriptase transforming growth factor-β phosphate-buffered saline. HGF is a pleiotropic cytokine of mesenchymal origin (for a recent review see 1Zarnegar R. Michalopoulos G.K. J. Cell Biology. 1995; 129: 1177-1180Google Scholar). It is known to be produced by fibroblasts, macrophages, and smooth muscle cells (2Rosen E.M. Goldberg I.D. Kacinski B.M. Buckholz T. Vinter D.W. In Vitro Cell. & Dev. Biol. 1989; 25: 163-173Google Scholar, 3Stoker M. Gherardi E. Perryman M. Gray J. Nature. 1987; 327: 239-242Google Scholar). Recently HGF production by B-lineage cell lines was also reported (4Nakamura S. Gohda E. Matsunaga T. Yamamoto I. Minowada J. Cytokine. 1994; 6: 285-294Google Scholar). Among the known effects of HGF is growth stimulation of hepatocytes (5Nakamura T. Nawa K. Ichihara A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 122: 1450-1459Google Scholar), endothelial cells (6Rubin J.S. Chan A.M. Bottaro D.P. Burgess W.H. Taylor W.G. Cech A.C. Hirschfield D.W. Wong J. Miki T. Finch P.W. Aaronson S.A. Proc.

Commun. 1991; 174: 331-337Google Scholar). HGF also causes spread of epithelial cells, a property of HGF that led to the designation “scatter factor” (3Stoker M. Gherardi E. Perryman M. Gray J. Nature. 1987; 327: 239-242Google Scholar). This name is still used synonymously with HGF. Because of HGF's ability to promote cell proliferation and blood vessel formation (7Bussolino F. Di Renzo M.F. Ziche M. Bocchietto E. Olivero M. Naldini L. Gaudino G. Tamagnone L. Coffer A. Comoglio P.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 629-641Google Scholar, 9Grant D.S. Kleinman H.K. Goldberg I.D.

The receptor for hepatocyte growth factor is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase encoded by the proto-oncogene c-Met (10Bottaro D.P. Rubin J.S. Faletto D.L. Chan A.M. Kmiecik T.E. Vande Woude G.F. Aaronson S.A. Science. 1991; 251: 802-804Google Scholar). Concomitant expression of HGF and its receptor by cancer cells has been shown to be associated with increased malignancy (11Bellusci S.

By reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we showed that five out of five human myeloma cell lines express HGF mRNA, and HGF protein was found in supernatants from four of these cell lines. To determine whether HGF has the potential to exert autocrine effects on the myeloma cells, we looked for HGF receptor expression on the same cells. By RT-PCR and Western blots we showed that four out of the five cell lines also expressed the HGF receptor, c-MET. Autocrine HGF-mediated tyrosine phophorylation of c-MET in the cell line JJN-3 could be blocked by anti-HGF. We propose that HGF is one of the long sought cytokines with pathophysiological functions in multiple myeloma. The human myeloma cell line JJN-3 (14Jackson N. Lowe J. Ball J. Bromidge E. Ling N.R. Larkins S. Griffith M.J. Franklin I.M. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1989; 75: 93-99Google Scholar) was a gift from Jennifer Ball, Department of Immunology, University of Birmingham, UK. The OH-2 (15Borset M. Waage A. Brekke O.L. Helseth E. Eur. J. Haematol. 1994; 53: 31-37Google Scholar) and JW cell lines were established in our laboratory from pleural effusions of two myeloma patients. The Mv-1-Lu (CCL-64) (16Tucker R.F. Shipley G.D. Moses H.L. Holley R.W. Science. 1984; 226: 705-707Google Scholar), SW-480, RPMI 8226 (17Moore G.E. Kitamura H. N. Y. State J.

Immunol. 1970; 7: 477-489Google Scholar) cell lines were purchased at American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MA). Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mML-glutamine, and 40 μg/ml gentamicin (complete medium (CM)), except for the OH-2 cell line, where the fetal calf serum was replaced by human A+ serum (The BloodBank, Regionsykehuset, Trondheim, Norway). For estimation of HGF content in supernatants from various cell lines by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described below, cells were seeded at a concentration of 7.5 × 105 (OH-2 and U-266 cells), 5 × 105 (JJN-3) or 2.5 × 105 (RPMI 8226 and JW) cells/ml, and the supernatants were harvested after 72 h of culture and stored at −20°C. NSO cells were generously provided by Z. Eshhar, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel (19Eshhar Z. Springer T.A. Hybridoma Technology in the Biosciences and Medicine. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1986: 1Google Scholar). Porcine platelet-derived TGFβ1 and β2, human platelet-derived TGFβ1, and recombinant human HGF were from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The amount of TGFβ-inhibiting activity was estimated by ability to counteract the TGFβ inhibition of DNA synthesis in Mv-1-Lu cells (16Tucker R.F. Shipley G.D. Moses H.L. Holley R.W. Science. 1984; 226: 705-707Google Scholar). Cells were seeded at 104 cells/well in microplates and incubated in the presence of 350 pg/ml porcine TGFβ1 with or without serial dilutions of samples in a final volume of 0.2 ml. After 20 h the cells were pulsed with 1 μCi/well of methyl-[3H]thymidine (Amersham Corp.). They were harvested 4 h later with a Micromate 196 cell harvester (Packard, Meriden, CT), and β-radiation was measured. In some experiments porcine TGFβ2 or human TGFβ1 was used. After washing JJN-3 cells three times in Hanks' balanced salt solution to eliminate serum proteins, the cells were seeded in protein-free hybridoma medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) at a concentration of 5 × 105/ml in 225-cm2 cell culture flasks (Costar, Cambridge, MA) in a total volume of 45 ml. The protein-free hybridoma medium was supplemented with 2.5 × 10−5M mercaptoethanol, 2 mML-glutamine, and 40 μg/ml gentamicin. We incubated the cultures at 37°C in 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere for 72 h, at which time the cells were pelleted and supernatant was frozen at −20°C. The cell pellet was dispersed in protein-free hybridoma medium, and cells were reused for supernatant production up to five times. JJN-3 conditioned protein-free hybridoma medium was concentrated on a Q-Sepharose HP anion exchange column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) that was equilibrated with 10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4. Bound material was eluted with 1 M NaCl. The activity was precipitated within 27-50% saturation of (NH4)2SO4 and reconstituted in 10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4. After filtration through a 0.2-μm filter (FP 030/3, Schleicher & Schuell), this fraction was loaded on a Resource Q (RQ) anion exchange column (Pharmacia) and eluted with a gradient of NaCl in 10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, at room temperature. The appropriate fractions from the RQ column were diluted 1:4 in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O and loaded on a μ reverse phase column C2/C18 that was run on a Smart System high pressure liquid chromatography (Pharmacia). The mobile phase was 0-100% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Acetonitrile and trifluoroacetic acid was removed by lyophilization after chromatography. Alternatively, the activity was purified by affinity chromatography by the following method. 10 mg of the 3F4 mouse anti-HGF monoclonal antibody (see below) was covalently immobilized on a Hitrap column (Pharmacia) by methods described by the manufacturer. The column was loaded with JJN-3 conditioned medium that had been concentrated on a Q-Sepharose HP anion exchange column as described above. After washing with 0.5 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, bound proteins were eluted in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid buffered with NaH2PO4 to pH 3.8. Final purification was done by reverse phase chromatography as described above. Protein concentrations were estimated by a dye fixation method (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin (Sigma) as standard. Mice were immunized with 1 μg of purified TGFβ-inhibiting protein emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant in the footpads. After 2 weeks, a new immunization was performed subcutanously with protein in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Six weeks later boosting injections were given intraperitoneally at 4 and 3 days before the removal of the spleen and fusion. Fusion of spleen cells with NSO cells was performed as described in (20Clark M.R. Wright B.W. Milstein C. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 73: 12-15Google Scholar), and selection of clones was performed on immunoplates (Maxisorp, Nunc, Denmark) coated with purified antigen. Binding antibodies in hybridoma supernatants were detected using peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse goat antibodies (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) and ortho-phenylene diamine (Dako) as a substrate. The antibodies were isotyped using a commercial isotyping kit (Zymed, San Francisco, CA) and purified from hybridoma supernatants using goat anti-mouse Sepharose (Zymed). Epitope mapping was performed with a BiaLite instrument (Pharmacia) and with competitive binding immunoassays. Briefly, these sandwich TGFβ-inhibiting protein immunoassays were performed using various capture antibodies, and the secondary antibodies were labeled with digoxigenin (digoxigenin antibody labeling kit, Boehringer Mannheim). The binding of digoxigenin antibodies was detected with peroxidase anti-digoxigenin Fab fragments (Boehringer Mannheim) and ortho-phenylene diamine substrate reaction. Another sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay used to detect amount of the antigen (which eventually turned out to be HGF) consisted of two monoclonal antibodies, denoted 3F4 and 2B5, as catching antibodies. Detection of bound antigen was done by a rabbit polyclonal serum toward the protein. The sensitivity of this assay was approximately 500 pg/ml HGF, and the assay was not affected by the presence of 10% normal human or mouse serum nor by the presence of 1 mg/ml of plasminogen, which has about 38% amino acid similarity to HGF (21Nakamura T. Nishizawa T. Hagiya M. Seki T. Shimonishi M. Sugimura A. Tashiro K. Shimizu S. Nature. 1989; 342: 440-443Google Scholar) (data not shown). JJN-3 cells were seeded in 24-well culture plates (Costar) at a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml medium. Each well contained 0.5 ml of RPMI medium without methionine or cysteine but supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 0.05 mCi of Tran35S-label (ICN Biomedicals, Irvine, CA), and 10% fetal calf serum that had been dialyzed against PBS. In some experiments the cells were grown in the presence of tunicamycin as indicated. After 4 h the cells were collected by centrifugation, and the supernatant was incubated for 1 h at 4°C, either without antibodies or with 2 μg/ml of the monoclonal antibody 3F4, which specifically recognizes HGF, or the control antibody 6H8 (mouse monoclonal antibody, which recognizes a 180-kDa surface antigen of activated NK cells). 2T. Espevik and A. Sundan, unpublished results. Aliquots of 0.5 ml were further incubated for 30 min with 50 μl (50% v/v) of anti-mouse Ig-coated Sepharose (Pharmacia). The Sepharose particles were subsequently washed twice in 10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 M NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.5. and once in the same buffer without NaCl. After the addition of 50 μl of SDS sample buffer, the suspension was boiled for 1 min and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein bands were visualized by fluorography. In other experiments designed to remove TGFβ-inhibiting activity from JJN-3 supernatant, 100 μl of anti-mouse Ig-coated Sepharose was preincubated with 50 μg of 3F4 or 6H8 for 2 h, washed in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and rotated overnight with 1 ml of JJN-3 supernatant. The Sepharose was pelleted, and the JJN-3 supernatants were tested for TGFβ-inhibiting activity in the Mu-1-Lv bioassay. SDS-polyacrylamide gels were fixed and silver-stained by the method described (22Wray W. Boulikas T. Wray V.P. Hancock R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 197-203Google Scholar). For sequencing purposes, proteins separated by gel electrophoresis were electrophoretically transferred to Immobiline-PSQ membranes (Millipore, Burlington, MA). Membranes were stained in Coomassie Blue before bands were cut out and subjected to amino acid sequencing using an Applied Biosystems A471 automatic sequencer coupled to an on-line amino acid identification system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Alternatively, the purified protein was subjected to proteolytic degradation by V8 (Endo-Glu) protease (Pierce) at 37°C over night before separation of fragments by electrophoresis and sequencing as described above. HGF and c-met-specific primers were synthesized in our laboratory with a Bechman DNA SM synthesizer on the basis of the published HGF (21Nakamura T. Nishizawa T. Hagiya M. Seki T. Shimonishi M. Sugimura A. Tashiro K. Shimizu S. Nature. 1989; 342: 440-443Google Scholar, 23Miyazawa K. Tsubouchi H. Naka D. Takahashi K. Okigaki M. Arakaki N. Nakayama H. Hirono S. Sakiyama O. Takahashi K.

S. A. 1987; 84: 6379-6383Google Scholar) cDNA sequences. The HGF primer sequences were: forward primer, 5′-TCCCCATCGCCATCCCC-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-CACCATGGCCTCGGCTGG-3′. The c-met primer sequences were: forward primer, 5′-TGGGAATCTGCCTGCGAA-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-CCAGAGGACGACGCCAAA-3′. Total RNA was isolated as described by Gough (25Gough N.M. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 173: 93-95Google Scholar). Briefly, 106 cells were lysed in 0.65% Nonidet P-40, 10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 M NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2), and the nuclei were pelleted. 100 μl of 7 M urea, 1% SDS, 0.35 M NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, and 10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, was added, followed by extraction with phenol/chloroform and ethanol precipitation. cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of RNA by incubating for 1 h with 0.5 mM dNTP, 1.5 μM oligo(dT)15 primer, 1 unit/μl RNasin (Promega Corp., Madison, WI), 0.25% Nonidet P-40, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.3, 15 mM KCl, 0.6 mM MgCl2, and 400 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus RT (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a total volume of 30 μl. RT was inactivated at 90°C for 2 min, and the cDNA was frozen at −70°C until further use. PCR was performed as follows: 1 μl (cDNA from JJN-3 cells in HGF PCR) or 5 μl (all other cell lines and JJN-3 in c-met PCR) of cDNA was added to a reaction mixture containing 30 pmol of 5′ and 3′ primers, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.8, 0.22 mM dNTP, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.25% Nonidet P-40 in a total volume of 50 μl. The samples were covered with 50 μl of mineral oil and heated to 90°C on a Techne Dri-block DB-3A (Techne Ltd., Cambridge, UK), and 1 unit of Taq-polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) was added through the oil layer. The PCR was through 36 cycles on a Biometra Trio-Thermoblock TB-1 (Biometra, Göttingen, Germany), each cycle comprising of 1 min at 94°C, 2 min at 68°C (HGF PCR) or 58°C (c-met), followed by 30 s of primer extension at 72°C. The expected PCR product of 749 (HGF product) and 395 (c-met) base pairs were detected by electrophoresis in 2% agarose gels containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Control primers amplified a 510-base pair fragment of β-actin (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). HGF PCR fragments were cloned into the pCR™II vector (Invitrogene Corp., San Diego, CA). Inserts were sequenced on both strands applying M13 universal forward and reverse primers and analyzed on an Applied Biosystems automatic sequencing machine according to methods provided by the manufacturer (Perkin-Elmer). The HGF-specific fragment was transcribed in vitro by SP6 RNA polymerase (Promega) in the presence of [γ-32P]CTP, and the transcribed RNA was used as a probe on Northern blots of total RNA or mRNA from myeloma cell lines by standard procedures (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.37Google Scholar). mRNA for this purpose was isolated using a Dynabeads mRNA DIRECT kit (Dynal, Oslo, Norway). Cells were washed in PBS and extracted with 10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 1% Triton X-100. Nuclei and insoluble material were pelleted, and the protein content of the extracts was measured with the Bio-Rad protein assay. 40 μg of protein was solubilized in SDS sample buffer containing 1%β-mercaptoethanol, and run on 10% polyacrylamide gels. The gels were blotted onto nitrocellulose filters (Bio-Rad), and the filters were developed by rabbit polyclonal antibodies toward c-MET and goat anti-rabbit HRP conjugates and Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL) detection (Amersham Corp.). As anti-c-MET we used two different antibodies raised toward synthetic peptides comprising of either the 28 or the 12 COOH-terminal amino acids of the c-MET β-chain (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). The appropriate synthetic peptide was added in excess to control reactions to check the specificity of the antibodies. JJN-3 cells were removed from culture bottles after 3 days of culture in CM and washed once in Hanks' balanced salt solution with 100 μg/ml heparin. Samples of 2.5 × 107 cells were used in immunoprecipitaion of c-MET, either without further incubation or after pretreatment for 30 min at 37°C in CM with 1:100 dilution of rabbit anti-HGF serum or 100 ng/ml HGF. The cells were washed in PBS and lysed in 70 μl of modified RIPA buffer containing 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin. Nuclei were pelleted, and the supernatants were diluted 1:3 in RIPA buffer with 0.1% Nonidet P-40. The supernatants were further incubated at 4°C for 1 h with a mouse monoclonal antibody directed against the extracellular domain of c-MET (Upstate Biotechnology Incorporated, Lake Placid, NY) and subsequently for 1 h with 50 μl (50% v/v) of anti-mouse Ig-coated Sepharose. The Sepharose particles were washed three times in RIPA with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and pelleted. Sample buffer with 1% mercaptoethanol was added. SDS-polyacrylamide gels were run and blotted, and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were detected by ECL essentially as described above. HRP-conjugated anti-phosphtyrosine antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Supernatant from the JJN-3 cells was antagonistic to the growth inhibiting effects of TGFβ on Mv-1-Lu cells (Fig. 1). In order to purify this inhibitory activity, JJN-3 cells were adapted to grow in the absence of serum. After 3 days of culture, the cell supernatants contained approximately 500 units/ml of this activity (Table I). We defined one unit as the amount of activity that in 200 μl restored the thymidine incorporation in Mv-1-Lu cells treated with 350 pg/ml TGFβ to 50% of the thymidine incorporation in untreated cells. Porcine TGFβ2 and platelet-derived human TGFβ1 were inhibited in the same manner by the supernatant as porcine TGF β1 (data not shown).Table IPurification of TGFβ inhibitor from 1000 ml of JJN-3 supernatantActivityProteinSpecific activityPurificationRecoveryunits/mlμg/mlunits/μgfold%JJN-3 supernatant5004012.51100Q-Sepharose eluate16000480332.711827-45% (NH4)2SO4 precipitate225,00019201179.4162RQ-anion exchange eluate125,0003873232660Reverse phase eluate105,00010010508410 Open table in a new tab The substance inhibiting TGFβ was isolated by a series of chromatographic steps as shown in Table I. With respect to protein, the overall purification was 84-fold, and about 10% of the total activity in the supernatant was recovered. The reason for the apparent increase in activity during the ammonium sulfate precipitation step is unclear. From results obtained in the Mv-1-Lu assay, it can be seen that 1 unit corresponded to about 1 ng of purified material (Table I), indicating that the activity was due to a highly potent protein. Thus, the TGFβ antagonist had a specific activity of similar order as the specific activity of TGFβ in the Mv-1-Lu cells. However, binding experiments indicated that the purified inhibitor of TGFβ did not inhibit the binding of iodinated TGFβ to these cells (data not shown), suggesting that the purified protein had its own activity on the cells. The final purification step consisted of reverse phase chromatography, and a typical chromatogram is shown in Fig. 2. The activity eluted as a peak at about 40% acetonitrile. When the peak from the reverse phase column was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the protein eluted from the RPC column appeared as a broad band at 72-78 kDa under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 3, lane E). Under reducing conditions, three main bands could be detected, migrating in the gels corresponding to molecular masses of approximately 90, 63, and 32-34 kDa (Fig. 3, lane F), suggesting that the broad 72-78-kDa band consisted of at least two subunits linked by disulfide bonds. After the generation of monoclonal antibodies against the 72-78-kDa protein, the inhibitory activity was purified by affinity chromatography before a final reverse phase column as above. This purification scheme resulted in the isolation of inhibitory activity with similar electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 3, lane G versus lane E).Fig. 3SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of fractions containing the inhibitory activity during consecutive purification steps.

However, treatment of the purified protein by V8 protease (Endo-Glu) generated several fragments that could be sequenced after separation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferal to PVDF membranes. Two of the fragments generated NH2-terminal sequences that were identical to sequences in the human hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (21Nakamura T. Nishizawa T. Hagiya M. Seki T. Shimonishi M. Sugimura A. Tashiro K. Shimizu S. Nature. 1989; 342: 440-443Google Scholar, 23Miyazawa K. Tsubouchi H. Naka D. Takahashi K. Okigaki M. Arakaki N. Nakayama H. Hirono S. Sakiyama O. Takahashi K. Gohda E. Daikuhara Y. Kitamura N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 163: 967-973Google Scholar). Thus, in one of the fragments, 17 consecutive amino acids were identified that all were identical to the reported sequence of human HGF for amino acids 45-61 in 21Nakamura T. Nishizawa T. Hagiya M. Seki T. Shimonishi M. Sugimura A. Tashiro K. Shimizu S. Nature. 1989; 342: 440-443Google Scholar. It also became clear that the electrophoretic mobility of the purified TGFβ antagonist corresponded closely to the earlier published data for HGF, both under reducing and nonreducing conditions (27Gak E. Taylor W.G. Chan A.M. Rubin J.S. FEBS Lett. 1992; 311: 17-21Google Scholar). To demonstrate that the TGFβ-inhibiting activity produced by the JJN-3 myeloma cells was due to the purified 72-78-kDa protein and that this protein was identical to HGF, monoclonal antibodies were raised toward the protein. As shown in Fig. 3, these antibodies recognized a protein of 72-78 kDa from the supernatants of JJN-3 cells. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 4, these antibodies removed the TGFβ-inhibiting activity from the supernatants of JJN-3 cells, establishing that the TGFβ-antagonistic activity was associated with the 72-78-kDa band. And finally, these antibodies precipitated recombinant human HGF, which in itself had identical TGFβ-inhibiting activity in the MV-1-Lu cells (data not shown). Taken together, these data demonstrate that the potent TGFβ-antagonistic protein purified from the cell supernatant of the myeloma cell line JJN-3 was HGF. As shown above, HGF produced by the JJN-3 myeloma cells appeared as a broad band at 72-78 kDa under nonreducing conditions in gel electrophoresis. HGF is known to be produced as a glycoprotein (28Hofmann R. Joseph A. Bhargava M.M. Rosen E.M. Goldberg I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1120: 343-350Google Scholar), and Fig. 5 shows the effect of treating the JJN-3 cells with tunicamycin before immunoprecipitation of HGF. Inhibition of N-linked glycosylation by tunicamycin resulted in an increase in electrophoretic mobility, indicating a reduction of molecular mass of approximately 10 kDa (Fig. 5). These resu"

When transiently transfected and overexpressed in either COS 7 cells or NIH3T3 cells, wild type DLK potently activated p46SAPK (SAPK/JNK) but had no detectable effect in activating p42/44MAPK. DLK also activated p38mapk when overexpressed in NIH3T3 cells. A catalytically inactive point mutant of DLK had no effect in these experiments. Consistent with its specificity in activating SAPK, DLK activated Elk-1 but not Sap1a-mediated transcription. In NIH3T3 cells, activation of SAPK by v-Src was markedly attenuated by coexpression of K185A, a catalytically inactive mutant of DLK, suggesting that this mutant could function in a dominant negative fashion in a pathway that leads from v-Src to SAPKs. In a series of co-transfection experiments, activation of p46SAPK by DLK was not inhibited by dominant negative mutants of Rac1 and Cdc42Hs, PAK65-R, or PAK65-A, but was attenuated by MEKK1(K432M). DLK(K185A) did not inhibit the ability of constitutively active MEKK1 to activate SAPK. Moreover, K185A significantly inhibited the activation of SAPK by constitutively active V-12 Rac1 and V-12 Cdc42Hs. These results suggest that DLK lies distal to Rac1 and/or Cdc42Hs but proximal to MEKK1 in a pathway leading from v-Src to SAPKs activation.

Shaw P.E. Crit. Rev. Oncogenesis. 1995; 6: 99-115Google Scholar). The protypical mammalian MAPKs, p42/44MAPK (ERK1 and ERK2) are activated by numerous mitogens and differentiation-inducing stimuli (reviewed in 2Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Google Scholar, 3Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Google Scholar, 4Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukasawa K. Vande Woude G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Google Scholar). Biochemical and genetic evidence demonstrates that signaling by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and seven transmembrane receptors involves the activation of a membrane-bound, small guanine nucleotide-binding GTPase called Ras. Once GTP-bound, Ras activates a multiple component protein kinase cascade, culminating in the activation of ERK1/2. ERKs serve as the major effector of this cascade, exerting control over several other classes of signal-transducing proteins including other protein kinases, at least one phospholipase A2, and a variety of transcriptional regulatory proteins (5Crews C.M. Alessandrini A. Erikson R.L.

While work in mammalian systems established the importance of the ERK pathway in signal transduction from RTKs, it has become clear from studies in yeast that multiple mammalian MAPK pathways exist in parallel (50Herskowitz I. Cell. 1995; 80: 187-197Google Scholar). Using both genetic and biochemical approaches in mammalian cells, the components of several additional MAPK pathways have now been identified. Best characterized is the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) pathway. This pathway is thought to lead from the activated Rho subfamily small GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42Hs, to activation of the MAP kinase kinase kinase kinase, p65PAK, to the MAP kinase kinase kinase, MEKK1, to the dual specificity MAP kinase kinase, MKK4/SEK1, and, finally, to activation of the MAP kinases p46/p54SAPK. SAPKs were discovered as the principal c-Jun NH2-terminal phosphorylating kinases and therefore have also been termed JNKs (6Kyriakis J.M. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 766: 19-303Google Scholar). Distinct from the ERK cascade, the SAPK pathway is predominantly activated by stress-inducing signals such as heat shock, ultraviolet irradiation, anisomycin, proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor α and interleukin 1β), and hyperosmolarity (7Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dal T. Ruble E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Google Scholar). Although G-protein-coupled receptors can signal through pathways leading to the activation of SAPK (8Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Kalinec G. Kyriakis J.M. Woodgett J. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5620-5624Google Scholar), the upstream signaling events by which the SAPK pathway becomes activated are largely unmapped. The mixed lineage kinase or MLK subfamily of protein kinases is a recently described subfamily of protein kinases that share two common structural features (9Dorow D.S. Devereux L. Dietzsch E. DeKretser T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 701-710Google Scholar, 10Holzman L.B. Merritt S.E. Fan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30808-30817Google Scholar). First, each has a distinctive kinase catalytic domain whose primary structure is hybrid between those found in serine/threonine and tyrosine protein kinases. Second, closely juxtaposed COOH-terminal to the catalytic domain, each MLK protein has a domain that is predicted to form two leucine/isoleucine zippers separated by a short spacer region. Additionally, each has both NH2- and COOH-terminal motifs suggestive of protein-protein interaction domains. Despite the hybrid structure of the catalytic domains, two members of the family (DLK and MLK3/SPRK) have been shown to exhibit serine/threonine-specific kinase autocatalytic activity in vitro (10Holzman L.B. Merritt S.E. Fan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30808-30817Google Scholar, 11Gallo K.A. Mark M.R. Scadden D.T. Wang Z. Gu Q. Godowski P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15092-15100Google Scholar, 12Mata M. Merritt S. Fan G. Yu G.G. Holzman L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16888-16897Google Scholar). Dual leucine zipper-bearing kinase, or DLK, has been identified as a member of the MLK subfamily (10Holzman L.B. Merritt S.E. Fan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30808-30817Google Scholar). DLK is most abundantly expressed in nervous tissue where it is predominantly found in neurons (12Mata M. Merritt S. Fan G. Yu G.G. Holzman L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16888-16897Google Scholar). Here, DLK protein is present in the nerve terminal where it is associated with both the plasma membrane and cytosolic compartments. Like DLK isolated from nerve terminal cytosol, DLK exists in both phosphorylated and dephosphorylated states under basal conditions in aggregating neuronal glial cultures. Membrane depolarization leads to DLK dephosphorylation, an effect that is completely inhibited by cyclosporin A, a specific inhibitor of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin (12Mata M. Merritt S. Fan G. Yu G.G. Holzman L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16888-16897Google Scholar). When aligned to protein sequence data bases, DLK catalytic subdomains I through VII are most similar to those of the serine/threonine family of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinases including CTR-1, STE11, and Byr2 (10Holzman L.B. Merritt S.E. Fan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30808-30817Google Scholar). Recently, multiple putative Rac1- and/or Cdc42Hs-binding proteins were identified in a search of GenBank using the sequence of a minimal Cdc42Hs binding domain in a murine p65PAK isoform (51Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Google Scholar). Several MLK proteins including DLK were identified by this search, and MLK3 was demonstrated to bind weakly to Rac1 and Cdc42Hs but not Rho in a GTP-dependent fashion in a filter binding assay. For these reasons, and having established that wild type DLK was constitutively active when overexpressed by transient transfection (12Mata M. Merritt S. Fan G. Yu G.G. Holzman L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16888-16897Google Scholar), we tested whether DLK could activate an established MAP kinase pathway. A rabbit polyclonal antiserum directed against the COOH-terminal 223 amino acids of DLK (C1) was described previously (10Holzman L.B. Merritt S.E. Fan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30808-30817Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies against the FLAG epitope (M2, Kodak/IBI), the MYC epitope (9E10, Oncogene Science), and the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope (12CA5, BMB) were obtained commercially as were rabbit polyclonal antibodies against p38mapk (UBI). The ERK1/2 antibody (83.877) (13Gille H. Kortenjann M. Strahl T. Shaw P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1094-1102Google Scholar) and SAPK antibody (14Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T.

COS 7, NIH3T3, and 293 cells (ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. For experiments described in Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4, 2× 105 cells plated in 35-mm tissue culture dishes were transiently transfected with a total of 2 μg of the appropriate combinations of eukaryotic expression plasmid using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For experiments described in Fig. 2, Fig. 3, cells were transfected by the standard DNA-calcium phosphate coprecipitation procedure. After 15-20 h, cells were washed of precipitates with serum-free medium. In experiments described in Fig. 2, cells were starved for another 24 h by incubation with medium containing 0% (ERK and SAPK expression) or 0.2% (p38mapk expression) fetal calf serum.

Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Google Scholar) were employed as indicated in the figure legends. After 48 h, cell lysates were prepared as described previously (12Mata M. Merritt S. Fan G. Yu G.G. Holzman L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16888-16897Google Scholar) in 1 ml of a buffer containing 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM sodium vanadate, 50 mM sodium fluoride, 20 mMβ-glycerophosphate, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors. ERK2 and p46SAPK immune-complex kinase assays were performed as described (20Gille H. Strahl T. Shaw P.E. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1191-1200Google Scholar). Hemagglutinin (HA)-p38mapk adsorbed to protein A-Sepharose saturated with monoclonal antibody 12CA5 was washed twice with PBS and twice with p38 kinase buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 25 mMβ-glycerophosphate, 25 mM MgCl2, 2 μM dithiothreitol, 0.1 μM orthovanadate) (35Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Google Scholar). Complexes were incubated for 30 min at 30°C in 30 μl of kinase buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 10% glycerol, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM sodium vanadate, and protease inhibitors) containing 25 μM ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham), and 2 μg of either myelin basic protein (ERK assays; Sigma), GST-c-Jun-(1-223) (SAPK assays), and GST-ATF2 (p38mapk assays). Reactions were terminated by addition of Laemmli buffer, boiled, resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and autoradiographed. Where indicated, incorporated counts were counted with a Bio-Rad or Fujix PhosphorImager. Equivalent expression of transfected MAP kinases was assessed by immunoblotting. To examine whether DLK activates a defined MAPK pathway, epitope-tagged ERK2 or p46SAPK was coexpressed with either wild type DLK, a catalytically inactive DLK mutant (K185A) (12Mata M. Merritt S. Fan G. Yu G.G. Holzman L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16888-16897Google Scholar), or appropriate vector control. Following cell lysis, immunoprecipitated epitope-tagged MAP kinases were assayed in vitro for catalytic activity. In COS 7 cells transiently transfected with wild type DLK, SAPK catalytic activity was stimulated greater than 9-fold relative to the vector control (Fig. 1A). When overexpressed in a similar fashion, K185A did not induce SAPK activity. As previously reported, anisomycin, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, activated SAPK only 5-fold in the absence of DLK. Addition of anisomycin to cells coexpressing DLK and SAPK resulted in no further activation of SAPK relative to untreated cells overexpressing DLK. In parallel experiments, DLK overexpression in COS 7 cells had no effect on ERK2 activity (Fig. 1B). Here, epidermal growth factor was used to demonstrate that the endogenous ERK pathway was intact. Additional experiments were carried out in NIH3T3 cells (and 293 cells, results not shown) to demonstrate that the observed results were not cell type-specific (Fig. 2). Again, expression of DLK activated epitope-tagged SAPK catalytic activity but did not activate ERK2. In NIH3T3 cells, DLK activated SAPK activity with a potency similar to that observed following coexpression of a catalytically active COOH-terminal fragment of MEKK1 (20Gille H. Strahl T. Shaw P.E. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1191-1200Google Scholar) (also see Fig. 5B). p38mapk, the mammalian homologue of S. cerevisiae MAPK HOG1, is activated by most known activators of SAPK (14Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Google Scholar, 35Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Google Scholar). For this reason, we tested whether DLK could activate coexpressed p38mapk. As with SAPK, overexpressed DLK stimulated p38mapk activity with a potency similar to that observed by coexpression of catalytically active MEKK1 or by treatment of cells with anisomycin. Neither empty vector control nor v-Raf induced p38mapk activity. p38mapk can be activated by three known MAP kinase kinases or MEKs. While activated MKK3 and MKK6 can activate only p38mapk, MKK4/SEK1 has been shown to activate both the SAPKs and p38mapk (36Derijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Google Scholar, 37Lin A. Minden A. Martineeto H. Claret F.X. Lange-Carter C. Mercurio F. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1995; 268: 286-290Google Scholar, 38Raingeaud J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 13675-13679Google Scholar). Therefore, that DLK can activate both SAPK and p38mapk suggests that DLK might activate these MAPKs via a MEKK1-MKK4-dependent pathway. Transcriptional activation of c-fos is induced by both mitogenic and cellular stress stimuli via pathways that lead to the activation of both ERK and SAPK (reviewed in 41Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Google Scholar). This transcriptional activation is mediated by transcription factor complexes that bind to the serum response element. When activated, ternary complex factors such as Elk-1 and Sap1a associate with the serum response factor (SRF) and bind to the serum response element resulting in c-fos transcriptional activation. Elk-1 and Sap1a both serve as substrates for and are activated by ERK. However, that Elk-1 and Sap1a subserve different physiological roles is suggested by the observation that only Elk-1, and not Sap1a, can be phosphorylated and activated by SAPK (42Strahl T. Gille H. Shaw P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar, 43Cavigelli M. Dolfi F. Claret F.-X. Karin M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5957-5964Google Scholar, 44Whitmarsh A.J. Shore P. Sharrocks A.D.

Since overexpressed DLK specifically induced SAPK and not ERK activity, we sought to test whether DLK would activate the transcriptional activity of Elk-1 but not Sap1a. Expression vectors encoding chimeric gene products of Elk-1 and Sap1a were prepared in which the respective ets domains were replaced by the DNA binding domain of the yeast transcription factor Gal4. As described previously, these gene products confer mitogenic and cellular stress signal dependence upon a Gal4-CAT reporter when co-expressed by transient transfection (13Gille H. Kortenjann M. Strahl T. Shaw P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1094-1102Google Scholar, 18Kortenjann M. Thomae O. Shaw P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4815-4824Google Scholar, 46Gille H. Kortenjann M. Thomae O.

As expected, expression of v-Raf in this system led to potent induction of both Elk-1 and Sap1a-mediated transcriptional activation (Fig. 3). Serine to alanine point mutations at Ser-383 in Elk-1 and at Ser-381 in Sap1a have been demonstrated to attenuate Elk-1- and Sap1a-mediated induction of transcription by mitogenic stimuli (46Gille H. Kortenjann M. Thomae O. Moomaw C. Slaughter C. Cobb M.H. Shaw P.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 951-962Google Scholar, 53Price M.A. Rogers A.E. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2589-2601Google Scholar, 54Janknecht R. Ernst W.H. Nordheim A. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1209-1216Google Scholar). Similarly, the Gal-Elk383A mutant has been shown to abrogate anisomycin-induced transcription in the same model (20Gille H. Strahl T. Shaw P.E. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1191-1200Google Scholar). Consistent with these previous observations, overexpressed v-Raf failed to activate Gal-Elk383A mediated transcription and minimally activated Gal-Sap381A-mediated transcription. As shown in Fig. 3, overexpression of DLK in this model led to a 7-fold induction of Gal-Elk-mediated transcription relative to vector only control, but failed to induce Gal-Sap1a-mediated transcription. DLK induced Gal-Elk-mediated transcription with less potency than that observed following v-Raf overexpression. However, the degree of induction of Gal-Elk-mediated transcription following overexpression of DLK was similar to that observed following treatment of these cells with anisomycin (20Gille H. Strahl T. Shaw P.E. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1191-1200Google Scholar). Therefore, the finding that DLK activates Elk-1- but not Sap1a-mediated transcription is consistent with DLK's ability to induce SAPK but not ERK catalytic activity. Transiently transfected v-Src has been shown to activate SAPK via a pathway that is inhibited by co-expression of dominant negative mutants of either Ras or Rac1 (24Minden A. Lin A. Claret F-X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Google Scholar). Therefore, NIH3T3 cells co-expressing v-Src and epitope-tagged p46SAPK were used to confirm that each of a series of previously characterized mutants function as dominant-negative mutants in the endogenous SAPK pathway. As predicted by others, catalytically inactive PAK65-A, the regulatory domain of hPAK65 (PAK65-R), which binds and inhibits both Rac1- and Cdc42Hs-dependent signal transduction (24Minden A. Lin A. Claret F-X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Google Scholar, 25Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Google Scholar, 26Martin G.A. Bollag G. McCormick F. Abo A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1970-1978Google Scholar), and MEKK1(K432M) (23Han J. Lee J.D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Google Scholar) functioned as interfering mutants in these experiments (Fig. 4A). Similar experiments confirmed that N-17 Rac1 and N-17 Cdc42Hs attenuated v-Src-induced activation of p46SAPK (Fig. 4B). Importantly, activation of SAPK by v-Src was markedly attenuated by K185A, a catalytically inactive mutant of DLK (12Mata M. Merritt S. Fan G. Yu G.G. Holzman L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16888-16897Google Scholar) (Fig. 4B). That co-expression of K185A inhibited activation of SAPK by v-Src suggested that this mutant could function in a dominant negative fashion in a pathway that leads from v-Src to SAPKs. Since overexpressed MEKK1 activates SAPKs and p38mapk (37Lin A. Minden A. Martineeto H. Claret F.X. Lange-Carter C. Mercurio F. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1995; 268: 286-290Google Scholar), the epistatic relationship between DLK and MEKK1 was investigated. When coexpressed with DLK in NIH3T3 cells, the catalytically inactive MEKK1(K432M) mutant attenuated SAPK activation (Fig. 5A). Conversely, SAPK activation by the catalytically active form of MEKK1 was not inhibited by coexpression of DLK (K185A) (Fig. 5B). These results emphasize that MEKK1(K432M) does not inhibit DLK-induced SAPK activation by competing with catalytically active DLK for a common downstream substrate (presumably SEK/MKK4). Rather, DLK appears to lie proximal to MEKK1 along a pathway leading to SAPK activation. The incomplete inhibitory effect of MEKK1(K432M) on overexpressed DLKs ability to activate SAPK is consistent with results by other investigators performing similar experiments (24Minden A. Lin A. Claret F-X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Google Scholar, 48Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.-C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Google Scholar). However, it is recognized that given incomplete inhibition, allowance should be made for other potential interpretations of these experiments. When activated, Cdc42Hs induces SAPKs activation via a MEKK1(K432M)-inhibitable pathway (24Minden A. Lin A. Claret F-X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Google Scholar, 48Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.-C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Google Scholar). Given the established relationship between v-Src, Cdc42Hs/Rac1, MEKK1, and SAPK, we next examined the relationship between DLK and Rac1 or Cdc42Hs. NIH 3T3 cells were cotransfected with constitutively active V-12 Cdc42Hs (Fig. 5C) or V-12 Rac1 (data not shown) and DLK(K185A). K185A markedly attenuated the activation of p46SAPK by both V-12 Cdc42Hs and V-12 Rac1. In control experiments, coexpression of either PAK65-A or PAK65-R also resulted in attenuation of p46SAPK activation by the constitutively active GTPases (Fig. 5C). In contrasting experiments, DLK was coexpressed with the dominant negative mutants N-17 Rac1 and N-17 Cdc42Hs (Fig. 5D). Neither GTPase mutant attenuated overexpressed DLK's ability to activate p46SAPK. Taken together, these experiments suggest that DLK lies distal to Rac1 and Cdc42Hs. Consistent with the experiments above, neither PAK65-R nor the catalytically inactive PAK65-A inhibited DLK-induced activation of SAPK (Fig. 4A). The GTP-dependent Rac1/Cdc42Hs binding domain of hPAK65 (named CRIB or GBD) has been localized to a 14-residue domain of hPAK65's NH2 terminus (51Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Google Scholar, 52Symons M. Derry J.M.J. Karlak B. Jiang S. Lemahieu V. McCormick F. Francke U. Abo A. Cell. 1996; 84: 723-734Google Scholar). This domain is conserved in multiple proteins including several p65PAK isoforms, WASP (the protein that is defective in the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome), several STE20 homologues, and p120ACK. PAK65-R, which contains this domain, is expected to competitively inhibit binding of proteins possessing the CRIB/GBD binding domain to Rac1 and Cdc42Hs; when overexpressed, this truncation mutant should inhibit signal transduction requiring activation of these GTPases. Of note, the mixed lineage kinases MLK2 and MLK3 possess 6 of 8 residues conserved in the CRIB/GBD; however, it is not clear that DLK contains this binding domain, since it possesses only 3 of 8 conserved residues (51Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Google Scholar). Nevertheless, DLK may associate with Rac1 and/or Cdc42Hs through an alternative binding domain or via an interaction with commonly associated molecules. Should DLK interact with Rac1 and/or Cdc42Hs, it is possible that the observed attenuation by K185A of V-12 Rac1-, V-12 Cdc42Hs-, and v-Src-induced activation of p46SAPK is due to inhibition/sequestration of the bound small GTPases in a manner similar to that of PAK65-R. In summary, the activation of p46SAPK by DLK is not inhibited by dominant negative mutants of Rac1 and Cdc42Hs, PAK65-R, or PAK65-A, but is attenuated by MEKK1(K432M). Moreover, K185A can significantly attenuate the activation of SAPK by v-Src and constitutively active V-12 Rac1 and V-12 Cdc42Hs. Therefore, in the pathway leading from v-Src to SAPKs activation, our results suggest that DLK lies distal to Rac1 and/or Cdc42Hs but proximal to MEKK1. Recent effort in several laboratories has focused on identifying the protein kinase or kinases that are responsible for linking the activation of Rac1 and Cdc42Hs to activation of the MEKK1-MKK4-SAPKs module. By homology to yeast, it has been presumed that the linking kinase is a STE20 homologue or a MAPKKKK. A large number of kinases bearing sequence similarity in their catalytic domain to STE20 have now been identified. These kinases can be divided into two subfamilies on the basis of structure. The first subfamily including Cla4, rat p65PAK, hPAK65, hPAK1, MST1, and MST2, are most closely related in overall structure to STE20 (25Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Google Scholar, 26Martin G.A. Bollag G. McCormick F. Abo A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1970-1978Google Scholar, 27Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L.

Gene (Amst.). 1995; 167: 303-306Google Scholar). Members of this first subfamily all contain CRIB/GBD domains in their NH2-terminals. To date, some PAKs have been shown to become activated by GTP-bound Rac1 and Cdc42Hs (25Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Google Scholar, 26Martin G.A. Bollag G. McCormick F. Abo A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1970-1978Google Scholar) and several have been shown to activate p46SAPK (32Brown J.L. Stowers L. Baer M. Trejo J. Coughlin S. Chant J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 598-605Google Scholar, 33Zhang S. Han J. Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Knaus U.G. Ulevitch R.J. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23934-23936Google Scholar, 34Bagrodia S. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27995-27998Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that the PAKs participate in linking activation of Rac1 and Cdc42Hs to activation of the MEKK1-MKK4-SAPKs module. Importantly, it has not yet been demonstrated that MEKK1 serves as the direct substrate of these PAKs nor that the kinases interact directly in vivo. This picture has been made more complex by the identification of a second subfamily of STE20-related kinases which includes germinal center kinase (GCK) and upstream kinase (49Pombo C.M. Kehrl J.H. Sanchez I. Katz P. Avruch J. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Force T. Kyriakis J.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 750-754Google Scholar). These kinases are more distantly related to STE20; they contain a distinctly different modular structure and lack CRIB/GBD binding domains. When overexpressed by transient transfection, GCK can also activate p46SAPK via a MKK4-dependent pathway (49Pombo C.M. Kehrl J.H. Sanchez I. Katz P. Avruch J. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Force T. Kyriakis J.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 750-754Google Scholar). Further mapping of the GCK-dependent SAPK pathway has not been reported. The findings reported herein introduce a third class of protein kinase that serves as a proximal regulator of the SAPK pathway. Our results suggest that DLK lies in a signaling pathway between Rac1/Cdc42Hs and MEKK1. Given the number of already identified protein kinases that might participate in linking GTPase activation to activation of MEKK1 or SAPKs, the epistatic relationship between DLK, the Rho-like GTPases, MEKK1, and the components of the various STE20 homologue subfamilies will require careful investigation. Our present understanding is insufficient to allow an immediate reconciliation between previously reported observations pertaining to the PAKs described above and those reported herein regarding DLK. However, we speculate that DLK represents a component of a pathway independent of the PAKs that links GTPase activation with activation of the MEKK1-MKK4-SAPK module. This pathway is likely to be cell type- and possibly subcellular compartment-specific. We thank A. Saltieal, J. Dixon, A. Abo, J. Kyriakis, P. Angel, J. Han, and M. H.

It has been implicated in the regulation of inflammatory and immune responses, cellular trafficking, and cell growth (1Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 26-42Google Scholar). This broad range of effects has complicated the elucidation of the mechanism of activation of PLD but has also led to the belief that there is a family of enzymes that probably possess distinct activation pathways (1Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 26-42Google Scholar). The best supported mechanisms of activation involve PKC or the small soluble GTP-binding proteins Rho and ARF (1Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys.

We have previously demonstrated a role for PLD in fibroblast mitogenesis and identified that PLD is inhibited in senescent cells.

The role of sphingolipids in signaling mechanisms is now being revealed by careful study of their regulation and biological effects. The sphingomyelin cycle, with regulated conversion of sphingomyelin to ceramide (5Okazaki T. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19076-19080Google Scholar, 6Okazaki T. Bielawska A. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15823-15831Google Scholar), is now recognized as a key pathway in cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (7Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3125-3238Google Scholar). We recently discovered a role for sphingolipids in cellular senescence (8Venable M.E. Blobe G.C. Obeid L.M. J. Biol.

Sphingomyelinase activity and ceramide levels are elevated in senescent fibroblasts. Ceramide was able to induce a senescent phenotype, as measured by its ability to induce several parameters of senescence and to specifically inhibit PLD (8Venable M.E. Blobe G.C. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26040-26044Google Scholar). Ceramide has also been demonstrated to inhibit PLD in neutrophils (10Nakamura T. Abe A. Balazovich K.J. Wu D. Suchard S.J. Boxer L.A. Shayman J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18384-18389Google Scholar) and rat fibroblasts (11Jones M.J. Murray A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5007-5013Google Scholar, 12Gomez-Munoz A. Martin A. O'Brien L. Brindley D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8937-8943Google Scholar). Here we attempt to develop our understanding of the mechanism of ceramide inhibition of PLD. We chose the HL-60 system, involving ARF-activated PLD (3Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweiss P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1137-1144Google Scholar, 4Cockcroft S. Thomas G.M.H.

Chem. 1995; 270: 3172-3178Google Scholar), as a model for the study of PLD regulation. We demonstrate that ceramide inhibits PLD activation by PMA in HL-60 cells. Our results also confirm that PLD is activated by GTP-binding protein and show that this activation is augmented by PKC. Analysis of the effect of ceramide on PLD in a cell-free system revealed that it is this augmentation by PKC that is the target of ceramide inhibition. Myristoylated recombinant ARF (5.7%) was a generous gift of Dr. Richard Kahn (Emory University). Recombinant PKCα was a generous gift of Dr. Doriano Fabbro (Ciba Geigy, Basel, Switzerland). Silica Gel 60 thin-layer chromatography plates were from Whatman, and solvents were supplied by Fisher Scientific. Dipalmitoylphosphatidyl(methyl-[3H])choline and [3H]palmitic acid was from DuPont NEN. Solvents were from Mallinckrodt Chemical Works (analytical grade). Fetal bovine serum and RPMI was from Life Technologies, Inc. Phosphatidylethanol and dioleoylglycerol were from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. ATP was from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. D-Erythro-N-hexanoyl-sphingosine and D-erythro-N-[14C]hexanoyl-sphingosine were synthesized as described (14Bielawska A. Crane H.M. Liotta D. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26226-26232Google Scholar). Other reagents were purchased from Sigma. HL-60 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were grown in RPMI (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% NaHCO3 and 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were maintained at 37°C in 5% CO2 and subcultured two times per week. Routine tests verified that the cells were free of Mycoplasma. HL-60 cells were seeded at 2.0 × 105 cells/ml. D-Erythro-N-[14C]hexanoyl-sphingosine suspended in ethanol was added to a final concentration of 10 μM (1 μl/ml cells). Cells were harvested at various times, and radioactivity in the media and the cells was quantitated. Cells were then extracted (15Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Phys. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar), and the lipids were separated by thin layer chromatography (chloroform:methanol, 80:20). Areas that showed radioactivity by autoradiography were scraped and quantitated by scintillation spectrometry. HL-60 cells (2.5 × 105/ml in 50 ml) were treated with C6ceramide or ethanol (0.1%) for 4 h and then with 100 nM PMA for 20 min at 37°C. Cells were harvested as described (16Lee J.Y. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13169-13174Google Scholar) and analyzed by Western blot analysis. Protein was estimated by Bradford analysis (17Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). Samples (100 μg protein from HL60 cells) were run on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose at 4°C overnight (8Venable M.E. Blobe G.C. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26040-26044Google Scholar). Blots were then washed with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS for 1 h at 20°C and incubated with PKC isoenzyme-specific antisera (18Wetsel W.C. Khan W.A. Merchenthaler I. Rivera H. Halpern A.E. Phung H.M. Negro-Vilar A. Hannun Y.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 121-133Google Scholar) at a dilution of 1:500 at 1:1000 with or without competing peptide (20-40 μg) for 2 h at 20°C. The blots were washed three times with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS for 15 min at 20°C and then once with PBS. The blots were incubated with secondary antiserum (goat anti-rabbit linked to horseradish peroxidase) for 2 h at 20°C and then washed three times with PBS. Blots were developed using ECL under conditions described by the manufacturer (Amersham Corp.). Cells (2.5 × 105 in 1 ml) were seeded in 24-well plates. Cells were rested and radiolabeled with [3H]palmitic acid (3 μCi, added in 3 μl ethanol) in serum-free media for 24 h, which resulted in approximately 95% being incorporated into the phosphatidylcholine fraction. Cells were also pretreated with 10 μM C6-ceramide for the indicated time. Cells were stimulated in 2% ethanol with 100 nM PMA for the indicated times. Incubations were stopped by the addition of 1 ml methanol on ice. Cells were transferred to a glass tube and extracted (15Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Phys. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar). Lipids were analyzed by thin layer chromatography using solvent A for phosphatidylcholine analysis, chloroform:methanol:acetic acid:H2O (50:25:8:4), or solvent B for phosphatidylethanol analysis, the upper phase of a mixture of ethyl acetate:iso-octane:acetic acid:H2O (80:50:20:100) (19Pai J.-K. Siegel M.I. Egan R.W. Billah M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12472-12477Google Scholar). Cells were treated as described (3Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweiss P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1137-1144Google Scholar). Briefly, HL-60 cells (5-8 × 108) were pelleted and then washed in PBS. The cell pellet was suspended in approximately 2 ml of homogenization buffer and then nitrogen cavitated. The cavitate was centrifuged 40,000 rpm for 40 min in a TL-100.3 rotor (Beckman Instruments). The pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer (2 ml) using a 19-gauge needle and was recentrifuged, as was the supernatant. This pellet was resuspended in 500 μl. Proteins were stable for at least 2 weeks when diluted with an equal volume of 100% glycerol, frozen in a dry ice/ethanol bath, and stored at −90°C. Assays were performed essentially as described previously (3Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweiss P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1137-1144Google Scholar) except that 3.4 μg of membrane protein and 7.1 μg of cytosol protein were used, and the radiospecific activity of the substrate dipalmitoylphosphatidyl(methyl-[3H])choline was increased such that at the same molar concentration, 120,000 dpm radiolabel were added per tube. C6-Ceramide was added in ethanol (1 μl) to protein components prior to activators. An additional 33 μM CaCl2 was added to the reactions as well as 15 μM GTPγS, 50 nM PMA, 4 μM ATP, and 16 mM MgCl2 where indicated.

Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26040-26044Google Scholar, 11Jones M.J. Murray A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5007-5013Google Scholar, 12Gomez-Munoz A. Martin A. O'Brien L. Brindley D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8937-8943Google Scholar) and neutrophils (10Nakamura T. Abe A. Balazovich K.J. Wu D. Suchard S.J. Boxer L.A. Shayman J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18384-18389Google Scholar). To define the target for ceramide, we used a cell-free system from HL-60 cells to investigate the action of ceramide on PLD. In intact HL-60 cells, PLD was inhibited by ceramide. Fig. 1 demonstrates that PMA stimulated PLD activity 2-3-fold in HL-60 cells. C6-Ceramide inhibited PMA-induced PLD in a dose- and time-dependent manner such that PLD activity decreased as early as 1 h after ceramide treatment and was at base-line unstimulated levels by 4 h of ceramide treatment. C6-Ceramide was effective at concentrations as low as 2 μM, and maximal activity was reached by 10 μM C6-ceramide. To measure how quickly ceramide was reaching its putative internal target and whether a metabolite might be the active species, we studied the uptake and metabolism of [14C]C6-ceramide. C6-Ceramide was taken up quite slowly with 17, 28, 37, and 42% being associated with the cells after 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 h, respectively. After 24 h, the amount of cell-associated radiolabel had dropped to 24%. [14C]C6-Ceramide was also metabolized slowly. The starting material was 96% pure, and 91% remained as [14C]C6-ceramide after 2 h. After 24 h, 78% of the radioactivity still chromatographed as [14C]C6-ceramide. Since PLD inhibition by ceramide occurred within 4 h of ceramide treatment, these results suggest that ceramide and not one of its metabolites is the likely active species. Ceramide inhibition of PMA-activatible PLD was specific in that C2-ceramide was equally as active as C6-ceramide, but the related 4,5-dihydroceramides had little or no activity (Fig. 2). Removal of the fatty acid (forming sphingosine) substantially reduced the activity. Introduction of a long chain fatty acid (stearate) eliminated its effect, although this is likely due to poor solubility. We chose to use C6-ceramide for the majority of our studies since it is more similar to the parent compound but has sufficient solubility. Since PKC is the intracellular phorbol ester receptor, which is known to activate PLD, we next examined the effect of C6-ceramide on PKC translocation. Cells were treated with 10 μM C6-ceramide for 24 h and then challenged with PMA for 20 min. Ceramide did not inhibit translocation of PKCα or βII (the only detectable PKC isoforms in HL-60) under conditions that it inhibited PLD activation (Fig. 3). Ceramide was also unable to inhibit purified PKC activity (16Lee J.Y. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13169-13174Google Scholar). Therefore, ceramide appeared to inhibit PLD activity downstream of PKC. To delineate the mechanism of ceramide inhibition of PLD, we used the cell-free system described by Brown et al. (3Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweiss P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1137-1144Google Scholar). HL-60 cells were nitrogen-cavitated, and PLD activity was reconstituted by mixing membrane and cytosol preparations with GTPγS and Ca2+. C6-Ceramide had no effect under these conditions (Fig. 4), indicating that the inhibition of PLD by ceramide was not a direct effect on the enzyme. Varying the ceramide concentration, temperature of preincubation, and preincubating cytosol and membrane compartments separately with C6-ceramide also failed to inhibit PLD activity (data not shown). We considered that ceramide may exert its effect upstream of the GTPγS-activable protein. Since PKC-induced activation of PLD in intact cells was inhibited by ceramide (Fig. 1), we tested the effect of PKC activators on the cell-free PLD activity. The addition of PKC activators to membrane and cytosol fractions in the absence of GTPγS had no effect on PLD activity (Fig. 5). When these were added in combination with GTPγS, however, we observed a synergistic increase in activity by 5-fold over background (Fig. 5). This effect of PKC activation was ATP-dependent, indicating that it was mediated by phosphorylation. These results suggested that PKC activation of PLD may be an important control site in this two-step activation of PLD in HL60 cells. To test the hypothesis that ceramide-mediated inhibition of PLD was through inhibition of the PKC-activable component, we optimized and characterized the PKC-dependent, cell-free system. This was initially performed by studying the protein dependence of the PKC-activable PLD. Varying the membrane protein concentration while keeping the cytosol protein fixed at 7.1 μg showed that optimal PKC activation of PLD was obtained in the presence of 3.4 μg of membrane protein (Fig. 6A). Varying the cytosol protein concentration while keeping the membrane protein concentration constant at 3.4 μg showed that optimal PKC-activable PLD was seen with 7.1 μg of cytosol protein (Fig. 6B). These optimal protein concentrations were then used to survey other requirements and potential activators/inhibitors of PKC-activable PLD (Fig. 7). The Ca2+ requirement was found to have a narrow optimum at 4 mM total Ca2+ (data not shown). The activity was completely inhibited by high levels of Zn2+, Mn2+, and Ca2+. PLD activity is thought to be regulated by tyrosine kinases (20Martinson E.A. Scheible S. Presek P. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1994; 40: 627-634Google Scholar, 21Kusner D.J. Schomisch S.J. Dubyak G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19973-19982Google Scholar). We wanted to determine if this regulation involved the PKC-activable component of PLD. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein did not inhibit PKC-activable PLD, but curiously, the phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitor orthovanadate was totally inhibitory (Fig. 7). Also, the ceramide-activated protein phosphatase/protein phosphatase 2A inhibitor okadaic acid was without effect (Fig. 7).Fig. 7Characteristics of PKC/GTP-binding protein activated PLD. Assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Inhibitors were added to the protein components just prior to the enzyme activators CaCl2 (33 μM), GTPγS (GTPS; 15 μM), PMA (50 nM), and ATP (4 μM) and the substrate. Data are the mean ± range (bars, S.E.) of duplicate measurements. Ok Acid, okadaic acid; Genest., genestein; Vn, vanadate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Once the PKC activation of PLD was established and its primary components and requirements characterized, we proceeded to test the possibility that C6-ceramide would act at this level. C6-Ceramide was added to the protein components first, mixed, and then the activators Ca2+, GTPγS, PMA, and MgATP were added, and the incubations were performed as above. Our results showed that ceramide inhibited the PKC-dependent activation of GTP-binding protein-dependent PLD activity in a dose-dependent fashion such that as little as 1 μM of C6-ceramide was effective at inhibiting PKC-activable PLD with maximal effects seen with 30 μM of C6-ceramides (Fig. 8). This inhibition was not through sequestration of PMA because PMA concentrations from 50 nM to 3 μM were used, and ceramide inhibition was unchanged (data not shown). These data demonstrate that the mechanism of inhibition of PLD by ceramide is via inhibiting the PKC-activable component. Coupled with the lack of inhibition of PKC translocation by ceramide and its inability to inhibit PKC directly (22Merrill Jr., A.H. Nimkar S. Menaldino D. Hannun Y.A. Loomis C. Bell R.M. Tyagi S.R. Lambeth J.D. Stevens V.L. Hunter R. Liotta D.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3138-3145Google Scholar and data not shown), these data localize the ceramide target between PKC and the GTP-binding protein in the activation of PLD in HL60 cells. In HL60 cells, the GTPγS-responsive element involved in PLD activation was shown to be cytosolic and was identified as ARF (3Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweiss P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1137-1144Google Scholar, 4Cockcroft S. Thomas G.M.H. Fensome A. Geny B. Cunningham E. Gout I. Hiles I. Totty N.F. Truong O. Hsuan J.J. Science. 1994; 263: 523-526Google Scholar); however, in neutrophils the GTP-binding protein component was shown to be in the membrane and was identified as Rho (2Bowman E.P. Uhlinger D.J. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21509-21512Google Scholar). In our HL60 cells, the PLD activity appears to be in the membrane (3Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweiss P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1137-1144Google Scholar and data not shown). PLD activation by GTPγS, however, requires a cytosolic component in that the addition of GTPγS to membrane in the absence of cytosol only slightly stimulated PLD activity from 1195 ± 476 to 1399 ± 269 dpm phosphorylcholine, and Western blot analysis showed that ARF was greater than 95% cytosolic (data not shown). Therefore, we studied the role of ARF in PLD activation and its inhibition by ceramide. Our first goal was to reconstitute membrane PLD activation using defined cytosolic components, i.e. ARF and PKC. Substitution of recombinant 5.7% myristoylated ARF1 for cytosol reconstituted GTPγS activation (Fig. 9A). The addition of baculovirus-expressed PKCα also stimulated PLD activity. This was in contrast to what was seen using cytosol as the source of PKC, where cytosol and PKC activators alone (i.e. in the absence of GTPγS) did not activate PLD. The addition of rARF1 and PKCα stimulated high levels of PLD activity (Fig. 9A), thereby completely reconstituting the activation pattern seen with crude cytosol. Next we defined the requirements for the activators (GTPγS, PMA, and ATP). The substitution of rARF for cytosol substantially activated PLD in the presence of GTPγS (Fig. 9B). Significantly greater activation was achieved by the addition of PMA and ATP (Fig. 9B), which may be due to a small amount of PKC that is membrane-associated in this preparation. The substitution of rPKCα for cytosol greatly stimulated PLD in washed membranes (Fig. 9C). This required only the PKC activators PMA and ATP, whereas no further activation by GTPγS was observed. Complete reconstitution of the two-step activation pathway with rARF1 and rPKCα required both GTP-binding protein and PKC activation (Fig. 9D) because it showed progressively greater activity with the addition of GTPγS, PMA plus ATP, and GTPγS plus PMA plus ATP. We next evaluated the inhibitory effect of C6-ceramide on this well-defined system (Fig. 10). C6-Ceramide was unable to inhibit ARF-activable PLD; however, C6-ceramide completely abolished the synergistic activation by PKC. Higher concentrations of C6-ceramide were required to maintain the lipid:protein ratio the same as that used in the crude system. These results with defined components recapitulate the observations in the crude system. They also define the least system required to preserve the effects of PKC and the action of ceramide. Importantly, they suggest, in inhibiting PLD, the target for ceramide resides in the membrane. These studies demonstrate that ceramide inhibits PMA-activated PLD in intact HL-60 cells. More importantly, this study demonstrates ceramide inhibition of membrane-bound PLD using a cell-free assay that has allowed us to gain insight into the mechanism of ceramide action. We have shown that ceramide inhibits PKC activation of GTP-binding, protein-dependent PLD without inhibiting the GTP-binding protein or the PLD directly. After characterizing the components of PLD activation in the HL60 cell reconstituted system, we identified the mechanism by which ceramide was inhibiting PLD. Our data using both the whole cytosol and the rARF/rPKCα system demonstrate that the augmentation of ARF-dependent PLD activity by PKC is the target of ceramide inhibition. These experiments also show that ceramide does not act directly on the PLD enzyme or the GTP-binding protein and that ceramide does not have nonspecific effects on the membrane or substrate vesicles. On the other hand, ceramide specifically inhibited PMA-activation of PLD in cells and in the reconstituted cell-free system. Reconstitution of PLD activation with washed membranes plus two recombinant cytosolic proteins, ARF and PKCα, demonstrates that other cytosolic proteins are not required for activation. A role for membrane-associated Rho is also possible (2Bowman E.P. Uhlinger D.J. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21509-21512Google Scholar), although we were not able to rule that out in these studies. Our finding that ceramide does not directly inhibit phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate-dependent PLD or its activation by GTPγS is supported by a recent study by Nakamura et al. (23Nakamura Y. Nakashima S. Ojio K. Banno Y. Miyata H. Nozawa Y. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 256-262Google Scholar). They concluded that ceramide inhibited PLD through inhibition of a Ca2+ channel, thereby inhibiting PKC activation of PLD. It is unlikely that ceramide acts via its metabolism to sphingosine since our intact cell data demonstrate that sphingosine does not inhibit PLD as potently as C6-ceramide, and in the cell-free assay, no preincubation is necessary for maximal effect. Also, sphingosine has been reported to activate PLD in intact fibroblasts (12Gomez-Munoz A. Martin A. O'Brien L. Brindley D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8937-8943Google Scholar, 24Kiss Z. Crilly K.S. Rossi M.A. Anderson W.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1124: 300-302Google Scholar). The discovery that ceramide inhibits PLD activation in this more defined system indicates that ceramide might inhibit the interaction of PKC with ARF/PLD without affecting PKC translocation per se. In addition to our finding that PKC translocation is not inhibited by ceramide, other studies show that ceramide does not inhibit PKC phosphorylation activity in vitro (16Lee J.Y. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13169-13174Google Scholar, 22Merrill Jr., A.H. Nimkar S. Menaldino D. Hannun Y.A. Loomis C. Bell R.M. Tyagi S.R. Lambeth J.D. Stevens V.L. Hunter R. Liotta D.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3138-3145Google Scholar). Jones and Murray (11Jones M.J. Murray A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5007-5013Google Scholar) also found inhibition of bradykinin stimulation of PLD activity by C2-ceramide in the intact mouse epidermal cell line HEL-37. In that study, the authors demonstrate only slight inhibition of translocation of PKCα in response to C2-ceramide. Blobe et al. (25Blobe G.C. Stribbling D.S. Fabbro D. Stabel S. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15823-15830Google Scholar) have shown that PKCα interacts specifically with actin filaments. It is possible that this interaction is affected by ceramide. In any case, our reconstituted system and the results of others (26Conricode K.M. Brewer K.A. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7199-7202Google Scholar, 27Singer W.D. Brown H.A. Jiang X. Sternweiss P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4504-4510Google Scholar, 28Ohguchi K. Banno Y. Nakashima S. Nozawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 306-311Google Scholar) implicate a novel role for PKC in signal transduction that is independent of classical PKC action i.e. translocation and phosphorylation, and that it is this action that is inhibited by ceramide. Although the regulatory pathways for phospholipase(s) D remain far from clear, a considerable amount of information has emerged recently. It is apparent that within a certain cell type, there are more than one PLD, as illustrated by Reinhold et al. (29Reinhold S.L. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 208-214Google Scholar), Massenburg et al. (30Massenburg D. Han J.-S. Liyanage M. Patton W.A. Rhee S.G. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11718-11722Google Scholar), Tyagi et al. (31Tyagi S.R. Burnam D.N. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12977-12982Google Scholar), and Song and Foster (32Song J. Foster D.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 711-717Google Scholar) (see also 1Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 26-42Google Scholar). One PLD is activated by fatty acids, whereas another requires PKC. The small molecular mass GTP-binding proteins ARF and Rho each activate a PLD (1Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 26-42Google Scholar), possibly working together (33Siddiqi A.R. Smith J.L. Ross A.H. Qui R-G. Symons M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8466-8473Google Scholar, 34Singer W.D. Brown H.A. Bokoch G.M. Sternweiss P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14944-14950Google Scholar) and on the same enzyme. Some studies have shown a synergistic activation of PLD by protein kinases and the small GTP-binding proteins (35Geny B. Cockcroft S. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 531-538Google Scholar, 36Van der Meulen J. Haslam R.J. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 693-700Google Scholar). We also found this synergy, where activation of the GTP-binding protein alone stimulates PLD significantly and the addition of PKC substantially augments GTP-binding protein activation of PLD. This activation by PKC required ATP and PMA in our studies; however, ATPγS and AMP-PNP were equally effective as ATP in the rARF plus rPKC assay system (data not shown; see also 37Lopez I. Burns D.J. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19465-19472Google Scholar). Olson et al. (38Olson S.C. Bowman E.P. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17236-17242Google Scholar) reported that PKC activation of PLD is ATP-dependent. On the other hand, Conricode et al. (26Conricode K.M. Brewer K.A. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7199-7202Google Scholar) reported direct activation of PLD by PKC in the absence of ATP, and Singer et al. (27Singer W.D. Brown H.A. Jiang X. Sternweiss P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4504-4510Google Scholar) reported separation of the PLD activation domain from the catalytic domain of PKC following trypsin treatment, suggesting that PKC-mediated phosphorylation is not required. Clearly, there are still some gaps in our knowledge of this pathway. The recently cloned PLD1 gene (39Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y.M. Sung T-C. Rudge S.A. Rose K. Engebrecht J. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29640-29643Google Scholar) should help clarify some of these issues. The PLD that is inhibited by ceramide has the following characteristics: 1) it requires cooperative activation by ARF and PKC; 2) it is located in the membrane; 3) it is dependent on phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate; and 4) it is inhibited by free fatty acid (data not shown) (30Massenburg D. Han J.-S. Liyanage M. Patton W.A. Rhee S.G. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11718-11722Google Scholar). Recently, several laboratories have shown that ceramide plays a role in the regulation of PLD in intact neutrophils (10Nakamura T. Abe A. Balazovich K.J. Wu D. Suchard S.J. Boxer L.A. Shayman J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18384-18389Google Scholar), fibroblasts (8Venable M.E. Blobe G.C. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26040-26044Google Scholar, 11Jones M.J. Murray A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5007-5013Google Scholar, 12Gomez-Munoz A. Martin A. O'Brien L. Brindley D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8937-8943Google Scholar), basophilic leukemia cells (23Nakamura Y. Nakashima S. Ojio K. Banno Y. Miyata H. Nozawa Y. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 256-262Google Scholar), and in HL-60 cells as shown here. Taken together, these studies suggest that ceramide may be a general regulator of PLD. This is particularly interesting in that ceramide seems to play a role in regulating PLD activation in both the mitogenic (fibroblasts and HL60 cells) and the inflammatory (neutrophils and basophilic leukemia cells) responses. The results from this study provide mechanistic insight into how ceramide may interfere with cell growth and proliferation. We and others have shown that ceramide has an important role in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. We have demonstrated previously that there is cross-talk between the phospholipid and sphingolipid signaling pathways in nutrient deprivation (40Jayadev S. Liu B. Bielawska A.E. Lee J.Y. Nazaire F. Pushkareva M.Y. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2047-2052Google Scholar) and in apoptosis (41Obeid L.M. Linardic C.M. Karolak L.A. Hannun Y.A. Science. 1993; 259: 1769-1771Google Scholar). Recently, we (9Venable M.E. Lee J.Y. Smyth M.J. Bielawska A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30701-30708Google Scholar) have demonstrated a role for ceramide as an endogenous mediator of cellular senescence in that ceramide levels and sphingomyelinase activity are elevated in senescent cells (but not in quiescent cells). Exogenous ceramide appears to induce a senescent phenotype in young human diploid fibroblasts. Furthermore, we found that diacylglycerol generation and PLD activity is inhibited in senescent cells, most probably due to ceramide accumulation (8Venable M.E. Blobe G.C. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26040-26044Google Scholar). Here, using HL60 cells, we confirm that ceramide inhibits PLD activation and uncover a potential mechanism by which this occurs. In conclusion, our studies shed new light on the current understanding of PLD regulation and the mechanism of ceramide action. We hope to identify the mechanism of ceramide inhibition through careful study of PKC activation. In this regard, ceramide will enable in-depth study of the mechanism of activation of PLD. We also provide a model for understanding the target of ceramide action in the regulation of cell growth, apoptosis, and cellular senescence. We thank Dr. Yusuf Hannun for helpful discussions and careful review of the manuscript, Dr. Richard A. Kahn for the generous gift of recombinant ARF, and Rita Fortune for expert secretarial assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2167228036,"Depletion of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ perturbs protein folding and processing within the organelle while inhibiting translational initiation through activation of the double-stranded RNA-activated eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)-2α kinase (PKR) (Prostko, C. R., Dholakia, J. N., Brostrom, M. A., and Brostrom, C. O. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 6211-6215). The glucose-regulated stress protein (GRP) chaperones are subsequently induced. We now report that sodium arsenite, a prototype for stressors fostering cytoplasmic protein misfolding, also inhibits translational initiation through activation of PKR while subsequently inducing the heat shock protein (HSP) chaperones. Arsenite neither mobilized ER-associated Ca2+ nor slowed peptide chain elongation. Various HSP-inducing chemicals caused rapid phosphorylation of eIF-2α. When incubated with double-stranded RNA, extracts derived from arsenite-treated cells displayed greater degrees of phosphorylation of PKR and eIF-2α than did control extracts. Cells overexpressing a dominant negative PKR mutation resisted translational inhibition and eIF-2α phosphorylation in response to ER or cytoplasmic stressors. Induction of either the HSP or GRP chaperones was accompanied by development of translational tolerance to either Ca2+-mobilizing agents or arsenite. Following induction of the HSPs by arsenite, cells remained susceptible to induction of the GRPs by Ca2+-mobilizing agents. Conversely, cells possessing induced GRP contents in response to Ca2+-mobilizing agents readily induced the HSPs in response to arsenite. It is concluded that the two chaperone systems function independently except for their mutual suppression of PKR. Depletion of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ perturbs protein folding and processing within the organelle while inhibiting translational initiation through activation of the double-stranded RNA-activated eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)-2α kinase (PKR) (Prostko, C.

It is concluded that the two chaperone systems function independently except for their mutual suppression of PKR. Chemicals and conditions that damage proteins, cause protein misfolding, or inhibit protein processing trigger the onset of protective homeostatic mechanisms resulting in “stress responses” in mammalian cells (reviewed in 1Lindquist S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 1151-1191Google Scholar, 2Hightower L.E. Cell. 1991; 66: 191-197Google Scholar, 3Welch W.J. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: 1063-1081Google Scholar). Included in these responses are an acute inhibition of mRNA translation, a subsequent induction of various protein chaperones, and the recovery of mRNA translation. Separate, but closely related, stress response systems exist for the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), 1The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumGRPglucose-regulated stress proteinHSPheat shock proteinGRP78/BiPglucose-regulated stress protein 78 or immunoglobulin heavy chain binding proteineIFeukaryotic initiation factorPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetatedsRNAdouble-stranded ribonucleic acidPKRdsRNA-activated eIF-2α kinasePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. relating to the induction of specific glucose-regulated stress proteins (GRPs) and for the cytoplasm (cytosol and mitochondria), pertaining to the induction of the heat shock proteins (HSPs). The most prominent GRPs are chaperones of 78 and 94 kDa that share sequence homology with HSP70 and HSP90, respectively but localize to the ER lumen. GRP78, also termed BiP, is hypothesized to function in early ER protein folding and assembly, in the translocation of proteins from the cytosol to the ER for processing, and in the retention and accumulation of improperly folded proteins within the ER lumen when processing is distressed (4Lee A.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 267-273Google Scholar, 5Little E. Ramakrishnan M. Roy B. Gazit G. Lee A.S. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1994; 4: 1-18Google Scholar). GRP94 is a high capacity Ca2+-binding glycoprotein thought to chaperone partially oxidized or folded intermediates (6Melnick J. Dul J.L. Argon Y. Nature. 1994; 270: 373-375Google Scholar). The ER functions critically in the early processing of newly synthesized secretory, lysosomal, and integral membrane proteins. Ca2+ sequestered by the ER supports the oligomerization, folding, and trimming of mannose residues of glycoproteins as well as the degradation of various incompletely assembled or abnormal proteins (7Poruchynsky M.S. Maass D.R. Atkinson P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 651-661Google Scholar, 8Lodish H.F. Kong N. Wikstrom L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 267: 12753-12760Google Scholar, 9Wikstrom L. Lodish H.F. J. Biol.

The oxidizing environment of the lumen is required for the processing of proteins with disulfide-bonded intermediates (15Lodish H.F. Kong N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20598-20605Google Scholar). Agents such as Ca2+ ionophores, thapsigargin, and extracellular chelators that deplete ER Ca2+ or those that act as luminal reductants induce GRP78 and GRP94 (reviewed in 4Lee A.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 267-273Google Scholar and 5Little E. Ramakrishnan M. Roy B. Gazit G. Lee A.S. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1994; 4: 1-18Google Scholar). Induction of these GRPs is also associated with viral infections, overproduction of incomplete secretory proteins, and inhibition of protein glycosylation from such agents as tunicamycin. GRP genes possess highly conserved promoter regions that confer ER stress inducibility and that bind specific nuclear factors during stress. An ER transmembrane kinase appears key for signaling of the ER stress response in yeast (16Shamu C.E. Cox J.S. Walter P. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 56-60Google Scholar). Initiation on grp78 mRNA can occur by a cap-independent, internal ribosome-binding mechanism (17Macejak D.G. Sarnow P. Nature. 1991; 353: 90-94Google Scholar). GRP78 and GRP94 maintain viability, and induction appears necessary for survival during persistent ER stress (18Li L.-J. Li X. Ferrario A. Rucker N. Liu E.S. Wong S. Gomer C.J. Lee A.S. J. Cell.

Induction of the HSPs follows the production of damaged or misfolded cytoplasmic proteins in response to elevated temperature, oxidative free radicals, and heavy metals or from the synthesis of aberrant cytoplasmic proteins in response to amino acid analogs (reviewed in 1Lindquist S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 1151-1191Google Scholar, 2Hightower L.E. Cell. 1991; 66: 191-197Google Scholar, 3Welch W.J. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: 1063-1081Google Scholar). Proteins containing sulfhydryl groups are particularly sensitive to modification. Sodium arsenite, a prominent inducer of the HSPs that produces minimal suppression of viability, is thought to act largely by inactivating sulfhydryl groups (19Levinson W. Opperman H. Jackson J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 606: 170-180Google Scholar). Mammalian HSPs induced by these stressors include proteins of 110, 90, 72, 70, 60, and 30 kDa of differing subcellular distribution and chaperone function (3Welch W.J. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: 1063-1081Google Scholar). The depletion of preexisting HSPs by binding to eccentric protein structures permits the trimerization of latent monomeric heat shock factor to a form that binds to heat shock response elements on DNA such that induction of heat shock mRNAs ensues (20Morimoto R.I. Sarge K.D. Abravaya K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21987-21990Google Scholar, 21Lis J. Wu C. Cell. 1994; 74: 1-4Google Scholar). These mRNAs, like that for grp78, possess structural features that permit their selective translation during stress. The chaperone activity of the HSPs is exemplified by HSP70 and a closely related form of the protein expressed in nonstressed cells, HSC72. Both prevent incorrect folding of polypeptides during synthesis, permitting delivery to organelles in an unfolded state for translocation. These chaperones may also solubilize or refold denatured or aberrant proteins and/or deliver them to a degradative system. The acute depression of mRNA translation occurring in response to ER stress results specifically from the phosphorylation of eIF-2α and inhibition of initiation (22Prostko C.R.

Recently we reported that the dsRNA-activated, interferon-inducible protein kinase (PKR) mediates eIF-2α phosphorylation occurring in NIH-3T3 cells in response to mobilization of ER-sequestered Ca2+ (27Prostko C.R. Dholakia J.N. Brostrom M.A. Brostrom C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6211-6215Google Scholar, 28Srivastava S.P. Davies M.V. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16619-16624Google Scholar). While eIF-2α phosphorylation has been reported to occur in response to stressors that selectively induce HSPs (reviewed in 29Proud C.G. Curr. Topics. Cell Regul. 1992; 32: 243-369Google Scholar), it was unclear whether translation was inhibited primarily at initiation or peptide chain elongation (30Duncan R.F. Hershey J.W.B. Arch. Biochem.

We now report that PKR mediates the phosphorylation of eIF-2α in response to sodium arsenite without evident effects on translational elongation. The potential role of PKR as a general eIF-2α kinase regulating translational initiation is discussed.

Purification of eIF-2 has been described previously (33Dholakia J.N. Wahba A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 546-550Google Scholar). All other materials were of reagent grade. Murine NIH-3T3 cells were cultured in dishes or multiwell plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and were utilized at confluence (1.6 × 105/cm2). NIH-3T3 cells expressing a dominant negative mutant PKR (K296P in catalytic subdomain II, clone KP3A) were derived as described previously (28Srivastava S.P. Davies M.V. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol.

Prior to treatments cells were equilibrated for 5-15 min with serum-free Ham's F-10 modified to contain 25 μM leucine and 0.2 mM Ca2+. Amino acid incorporation was measured as described (35Brostrom C.O. Bocckino S.B. Brostrom M.A. J. Biol.

Incubations were conducted in triplicate, and results are presented as the average or average ± range of values obtained. Findings were reproduced on at least two separate occasions. [35S]methionine labeling (2 × 106 cells/experimental condition), one-dimensional 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) of detergent-solubilized extracts of methionine-labeled cells, and autoradiography were conducted as described previously (25Wong W.L. Brostrom M.A. Gmitter-Yellen D. Kuznetsov G. Brostrom C.O. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 71-79Google Scholar). Ribosomal and polyribosomal size distributions were measured by density gradient centrifugation as described previously (34Chin K.-V. Cade C. Brostrom C.O. Galuska E.M. Brostrom M.A. J. Biol.

Transit times were determined for cells in monolayer culture by a modification of the procedure of Ledford and Davis (37Ledford B.E. Davis D.B. Biochem. Biophys.

The cells were washed with modified Ham's F-10 adjusted to contain 100 μM leucine, 33 μM methionine, 200 nM Ca2+ chloride, and 0.6 μM phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and then equilibrated with 38 ml of the medium for 30 min at 37°C with various experimental additives. Controls (blanks) were adjusted to 2 mM leucine and 100 μM cycloheximide to prevent incorporation. Incorporations were initiated by the addition of 50 μl [14C]leucine (5 μCi). After 45 min the samples were adjusted with 50 μl [3H]leucine (20 μCi), and the incubation continued for 15 min. Samples (50 μl) were taken for determination of slopes, the incubation media were removed, and the cultures were adjusted with 40 ml of ice-cold 125 μM cycloheximide plus 2 mM leucine in isotonic saline to terminate incorporation. This medium was removed, and the cells were dislodged into 2.5 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 25 mM KCl, 1% Triton X100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 10 μg/ml cycloheximide, 2 mM leucine, 1 mg/ml heparin, and 5 mM MgCl2. The cells were homogenized with a Dounce glass homogenizer equipped with a tight fitting pestle (20 strokes), and the lysates were transferred to 15-ml Corex centrifuge tubes. The utensils were rinsed with 2 ml of additional homogenizing fluid, and the rinse was homogenized and combined with the lysate. The lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the resulting postmitochondrial supernatant (PMS) fractions were recovered. Five 400-μl samples were removed into 5-ml vials on ice. The remainder of each fraction was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h, the postribosomal supernatant (PRS) fraction was decanted, and five 400-μl samplings were taken as above. Both sets of samples were then precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid and analyzed for radioactivity by the procedure used for conventional incorporations (35Brostrom C.O. Bocckino S.B. Brostrom M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14390-14399Google Scholar). Samples taken for slope determination were adjusted to comparable 14C and 3H counting efficiencies to those for incorporation samples. Samples were analyzed for each isotope in a multichannel scintillation counter, and the data were corrected for channel crossover. Slopes were calculated from the relationship, Slope =3H/14C ( 1/ incubation time )(Eq. 1) Average ribosomal transit times were calculated by the relationship, Transit time =(2/ slope )3H14C of PMS−3H/14C of PRS(Eq. 2) Cells (6 × 105/treatment) were dissolved with sample buffer containing 3.5% ampholines (4 parts pH 4-8 and 1 part pH 3.5-10), 2%β-mercaptoethanol, 0.4% Tween-20, and 12 M urea at 40°C. The preparations were then subjected to slab gel isoelectric focusing in 9.5 M urea at 950 V for 18 h to separate the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of eIF-2α in the pI range of 5-7 (31Scorsone K.A. Panniers R. Rowlands A.G. Henshaw E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14538-14543Google Scholar). Gels were treated with Tris buffer and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes under basic conditions. The two species of eIF-2α, which differ by approximately 0.1 pI unit, were detected by immunoblotting and chemiluminescence (22Prostko C.R. Brostrom M.A. Malara E.M. Brostrom C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16751-16754Google Scholar). Films were scanned by UMAX Magic Scan version 1.3.3. Analysis of the relative amounts of phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated subunit was performed on a Macintosh Quadra 700 computer using the public domain NIH Image program. 2Developed at the National Institutes of Health and available from the Internet by anonymous ftp from zippy.nimh.nih.gov or on floppy disk from NTIS, 5285 Port Royal Rd., Springfield, VA 22161, PB95-500195GEI. The preparation of extracts of variously treated NIH-3T3 cells, the methodology for measuring the phosphorylation of endogenous PKR and of exogenous, purified eIF-2 in vitro, and the procedures for immunoprecipitation of PKR were each described previously (27Prostko C.R. Dholakia J.N. Brostrom M.A. Brostrom C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6211-6215Google Scholar). Acute exposure of various cultured cells to either thiol-reducing or Ca2+-mobilizing agents inhibits amino acid incorporation in conjunction with eIF-2α phosphorylation and depressed eIF-2B activity, lowered 43 S preinitiation complex, and disappearance of polyribosomal contents (22Prostko C.R. Brostrom M.A. Malara E.M. Brostrom C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16751-16754Google Scholar, 23Brostrom M.A. Brostrom C.O. Berdanier C.D. Hargrove J.L. Nutrition and Gene Expression. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1993: 117Google Scholar). NIH-3T3 cells were chosen for the current investigation in view of their strong induction of PKR in response to interferon-α and the activation of the enzyme by ER stressors (27Prostko C.R. Dholakia J.N. Brostrom M.A. Brostrom C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6211-6215Google Scholar). On acute challenge, protein synthesis in NIH-3T3 cells was remarkably sensitive to inhibition by such ER stressors as the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin, to thapsigargin, an irreversible inhibitor of ER Ca2+ accumulation, and to dithiothreitol, a sulfhydryl-reducing agent. All of these agents on longer term exposures (several hours) induce expression of GRP78 and GRP94 but not the HSPs. Protein synthesis in NIH-3T3 cells was also readily inhibited by sodium arsenite and cadmium ion, both of which induce the HSPs but not the GRPs. During longer term exposures suitable for inducing either HSPs or GRPs, most cell types recover approximately 50-100% of their original rates of amino acid incorporation. These recoveries depend on new mRNA synthesis. NIH-3T3 cells, however, were unable to restore amino acid incorporation when challenged by ER stressors such as thapsigargin unless fetal bovine serum, PMA, or epidermal growth factor was included in the incubation (not shown). Amino acid incorporation by NIH-3T3 cells also declined sharply (84%) during a 3-h exposure to actinomycin D. When either serum or PMA was added, actinomycin D blocked recovery from thapsigargin inhibition in the predicted fashion. Recovery of amino acid incorporation in cells challenged with arsenite, however, did not depend on the addition of promoters such as PMA. The addition of PMA was necessary, however, to demonstrate that actinomycin D prevented recovery of incorporation on longer-term arsenite treatment. The beneficial effects of PMA in stabilizing rates of amino acid incorporation in longer term incubations of NIH-3T3 cells prompted its judicial use in subsequent experiments. The ability of sodium arsenite to release NIH-3T3 cell-associated Ca2+ was compared with that of two established releasers, ionomycin and thapsigargin (not shown). Both agents released approximately 40% of cell-associated Ca2+ during incubation periods ranging from 90 min to 4 h. Arsenite did not release Ca2+ or alter the release of Ca2+ occurring in response to either thapsigargin or ionomycin. Cells that were pretreated with arsenite under conditions that would induce HSPs were not altered either in their Ca2+ contents or in their responses to either thapsigargin or ionomycin. Cross-tolerance to translational inhibition by ionomycin was sought in NIH-3T3 cells that were accommodated to arsenite. Amino acid incorporation was compared for cells that were either pretreated for 90 min with 150 μM sodium arsenite followed by a 2-h recovery period without drug or carried as untreated controls. Leucine pulse labeling during the recovery period indicated that protein synthesis was gradually returning in the arsenite-treated samples after a nearly complete inhibition (Fig. 1, inset, filled circles). After 30 min in fresh medium, the two sets of samples were challenged with increasing concentrations of sodium arsenite or ionomycin (Fig. 1). Leucine incorporation by cells not previously exposed to arsenite was strongly inhibited by arsenite concentrations ranging from 25 to 50 μM and by ionomycin ranging from 30 to 300 nM (Fig. 1, open circles). Cells previously exposed to arsenite expressed nearly complete translational tolerance to either stressor across these respective concentration ranges as well as to severalfold higher concentrations (Fig. 1, filled circles). Cross-tolerance to arsenite was sought in cells that were accommodated to ionomycin. Amino acid incorporation was compared for cells that were either pretreated for 3.5 h with 0.5 μM ionomycin or incubated as drug-free controls. Leucine pulse labeling conducted during the first 3 h of this period indicated gradual recovery of protein synthesis in the ionomycin-treated samples following almost complete initial inhibition (Fig. 2, inset, filled circles), whereas the untreated controls exhibited slight declines in activity (inset, open circles). After removal of the ionomycin with albumin washes, the two sets of samples were challenged with increasing concentrations of sodium arsenite or ionomycin (Fig. 2). Incorporation in cells not previously exposed to ionomycin was strongly inhibited by arsenite concentrations ranging from 25 to 100 μM and by ionomycin ranging from 30 to 100 nM (Fig. 2, open circles). Cells previously exposed to ionomycin were almost completely tolerant to translational inhibition by either stressor at these respective concentration ranges and markedly tolerant at higher concentrations as well (filled circles). Both sets of cells exhibited comparable degrees of leucine incorporation when incubated without stressors. It was of interest to ascertain whether NIH-3T3 cells retain responsiveness to ER stressors after the induction of the HSPs and, conversely, whether inducers of the HSPs are active following induction of GRPs. In an initial experiment cells were pretreated with sodium arsenite for 90 min (stage 1), washed and exposed to either thapsigargin or ionomycin for 3.5 h (stage 2), and subsequently exposed to pulse labeling with [35S]methionine (Fig. 3A). Controls without drug were also included for each of the two stages of the incubation, and some samples during the second stage were incubated with actinomycin D to block potential induction of stress proteins during this period. Cells treated with arsenite (lanes g-l) during the first stage of the treatment displayed the typical induction of HSPs of 110, 90, 72, 70, 60, and 30 kDa. These inductions were equivalent for cells treated in the second stage either without Ca2+ mobilizer (lane g), or with thapsigargin (lane h) or ionomycin (lane i) but were reduced sharply by actinomycin D during that period (lanes j, k, and l, respectively). Overall protein synthesis was lowered by actinomycin D in these samples but not abolished. Controls that were not treated with arsenite (lanes a-f) did not induce any detectable HSPs either without Ca2+ mobilizer (lane a) or with thapsigargin (lane b) or ionomycin (lane c). Actinomycin D added to comparable respective samples (lanes d, e, and f) effaced almost all methionine incorporation in the thapsigargin (lane e) or ionomycin (lane f) -treated cells in contrast to the control without Ca2+ mobilizer (lane d), which was not perceptibly affected. Comparable inductions of GRP78 were found for cells exposed to either thapsigargin (lanes b and h) or ionomycin (lanes c and i) for cells in the second stage of the incubation irrespective of previous arsenite treatment. No inductions of GRP78 were observed in cells treated with actinomycin D under these respective conditions (lanes e, f,k, and l) or in cells that were never treated with a Ca2+ mobilizer (lanes a, d, g, and j). The converse experiment was performed in which cells were treated with thapsigargin for 3 h to induce the GRPs (stage 1) and then exposed to sodium arsenite or CdCl2 for 2.5 h (stage 2) and analyzed for pulse labeling with [35S]methionine (Fig. 3B). As in Fig. 3A, drug-free samples for each stage and actinomycin D controls were included. Cells treated in stage 1 with thapsigargin (lanes g-l) displayed the strong induction of GRP78 and modest induction of GRP94, a later appearing protein. Pulse labeling of these proteins was not altered from the stage 2 control (lane g) by either arsenite (lane i) or Cd2+ (lane k). Actinomycin D (lanes h, j, and l, respectively) reduced, but did not eliminate, pulse labeling of these proteins. No perceptible induction of the HSPs was observed in any sample in response to thapsigargin. Exposure of thapsigargin-pretreated cells (lane g) during stage 2 to either arsenite (lane i) or Cd2+ (lane k) induced the full range of HSPs. Qualitatively comparable HSP inductions were noted for similarly treated control cells that had not received thapsigargin during stage 1 (lanes a, c, and e, respectively). Actinomycin D blocked the stage 2 induction of the HSPs by either arsenite (lanes d and j) or by Cd2+ (lanes f and l). It seems clear from these results (Fig. 3, A and B) that, despite the cross-tolerance of protein synthesis developing in response to ER and heat shock stressors (Fig. 1, Fig. 2), the HSP and GRP stress proteins remain independently inducible. The ability of sodium arsenite to inhibit translational initiation was compared with that of thapsigargin and ionomycin. Lysates derived from NIH-3T3 cells treated acutely for 45 min with 300 nM ionomycin (Fig. 4, upper panel, lane b), 30 nM thapsigargin (lane c), or 150 μM sodium arsenite (lane d) displayed a comparable accumulation of ribosomal subunits and a disappearance of polyribosomal contents as compared with an untreated control (lane a). These alterations were completely reversible for each substance following the addition of an inhibitor of peptide chain elongation, cycloheximide, for an additional 15 min (Fig. 4, lower panel). Longer term incubations with either 150 μM sodium arsenite or with 0.5 μM ionomycin resulted in the development of cross-tolerance to polyribosome depletion by either agent (not shown). Cells incubated without stressor remained sensitive to polyribosome depletion when challenged with either ionomycin or arsenite, whereas the polyribosome contents of cells that had been pretreated with either arsenite or ionomycin were not affected upon challenge with either agent.

Chanock R.M. McIntosh K. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Virology. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1996: 1205Google Scholar). HPIV3 contains a negative strand RNA genome that is encapsidated by a nucleocapsid protein NP (68 kDa) and tightly associated with two RNA polymerase subunits, a large protein L (251 kDa) and a phosphoprotein P (90 kDa), to form the viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) core (2Banerjee A.K. Barik S. De B.P. Pharmacol. & Ther. 1991; 51: 47-70Google Scholar, 3Galinski M.S. Wechsler S.L. Kingsbury D.W. The Paramyxoviruses. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1991: 41Google Scholar). The encapsidated genome RNA serves as a template for transcription to synthesize a leader RNA and six mRNAs as well as in replication to synthesize full-length genome RNA, both mediated by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Recent studies demonstrate that participation of specific cellular proteins is critical for the regulation of gene expression of HPIV3 (4De B.P. Burdsall A.L. Banerjee A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5703-5710Google Scholar, 5De B.P. Gupta S. Gupta S. Banerjee A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5204-5208Google Scholar). Protein kinase C-ζ has been implicated in the phosphorylation of the virion-associated RNA polymerase subunit, the phosphoprotein P (5De B.P. Gupta S. Gupta S. Banerjee A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5204-5208Google Scholar). Introduction of protein kinase C-ζ-specific peptide inhibitor in cultured cells abrogated HPIV3 replication providing strong evidence that protein kinase C-ζ is involved in the HPIV3 life cycle (5De B.P. Gupta S. Gupta S. Banerjee A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5204-5208Google Scholar). Another cellular protein, actin, was found to be required in transcription of purified viral RNP in vitro and was found to be involved in maintaining a moderately coiled structure of the RNP that appeared to facilitate transcription of the genome RNA by the RNA polymerase (4De B.P. Burdsall A.L. Banerjee A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5703-5710Google Scholar). The productive infection of HPIV3, thus, appears to require a close encounter between the viral genome and several cellular proteins. A detailed search of such putative cellular proteins and their characterization would lead to better understanding of their roles in the regulation of the intricate steps in viral gene expression. human parainfluenza virus type 3 glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ribonucleoprotein complex leader sequence-containing RNA 3′-genomic sequence-containing RNA 3′-genome sequence dithiothreitol plaque-forming units. Sequence analysis of HPIV3 genome RNA reveals the presence of a sequence element at the 3′-end that serves as the binding site of the RNA polymerase to initiate synthesis of a 55-nucleotide plus-sense leader RNA followed by six monocistronic, capped, and polyadenylated mRNAs in vitro and in vivo (2Banerjee A.K. Barik S. De B.P. Pharmacol. & Ther. 1991; 51: 47-70Google Scholar, 3Galinski M.S. Wechsler S.L. Kingsbury D.W. The Paramyxoviruses. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1991: 41Google Scholar). The leader RNA is involved in the initiation of assembly of viral nucleocapsid containing the plus-sense genome RNA that in turn serves as a template for the synthesis of minus strand genome RNA for packaging into progeny virions (6Blumberg B.M. Chan J. Udem S.A. Kingsbury D.W. The Paramyxoviruses. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1991: 235Google Scholar). Thus, the 3′-noncoding region of the genome RNA and the plus-sense leader RNA are the key cis-acting RNA sequence regions that presumably play important roles in the regulation of virus transcription and replication, respectively. A number of observations suggest that cellular proteins specifically interact with the viral cis-acting regulatory RNAs in several viral systems indicating their possible involvement in the regulation of viral gene expression (7Kurilla M.G.

In this study, we searched for putative cellular proteins that might be involved in HPIV3 gene expression through interaction with the viral cis-acting regulatory RNAs. In a gel mobility shift assay, we used two regulatory RNAs described above, the 3′-genome sequence-containing RNA (3′-GS-RNA) and the leader sequence-containing RNA (LS-RNA) that are involved in binding of RNA polymerase and the viral nucleocapsid protein for transcription and replication, respectively. We have shown that the cellular glycolytic enzyme, GAPDH, and the nuclear antigen, LA protein, form specific complexes with these cis-acting RNAs in vitro and in vivo. In addition, GAPDH is found to be co-localized with the viral RNP in HPIV3-infected cells. These results strongly suggest that both GAPDH and LA proteins are involved in the regulation of gene expression of HPIV3. Two plasmids containing the oligodeoxynucleotides corresponding to a 73-nucleotide 3′-genome sequence (3′-GS) and plus-sense LS-RNA, respectively, under the control of T7 promoter were constructed. To construct the plasmid-containing 3′-GS, primer 1 (5′-AAG CTT TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG TCA ATG TCT TTA ATC C-3′) containing a HindIII site, T7 promoter complementary sequence, and 17 nucleotides from the untranslated region of the NP gene and primer 2 (5′-GGT ACC GAC GCT ATA TAC CAA ACA AGA GAA GAA ACT TG-3′) containing KpnI-HgaI sites and a 22-nucleotide complementary sequence from the 3′-end of the leader region were synthesized (Operon Technologies, Inc.). These two primers were used in polymerase chain reaction containing pHPIV3-CAT plasmid DNA as template (13De B.P. Banerjee A.K. Virology. 1993; 196: 344-348Google Scholar). Similarly, the plasmid containing LS-RNA was constructed using the pHPIV3-CAT DNA and the primer 3 (5′-AAG CTT TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG TCA ATG TCT TTA ATC C-3′) containing a HindIII site, T7 promoter complementary sequence, and a 19-nucleotide complementary sequence from the leader region and primer 4 (5′-GGT ACC GAC GCT ATA TGT CAA TGT CTT TAA TCC-3′) containing KpnI-HgaI sites and 17 nucleotides from the untranslated region of the NP gene in a polymerase chain reaction. Sequences of the inserts in these constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Radiolabeled RNAs were synthesized using these plasmid DNAs after linearization with HgaI in an in vitro transcription reaction containing [α-32P]UTP and T7 RNA polymerase according to the manufacturer's protocol (Boehringer Mannheim). The transcripts (73 nucleotides) would contain 55 nucleotides from the leader region and 18 nucleotides from the NP gene. The in vitro synthesized RNAs were analyzed in a 10% polyacrylamide-urea gel, and the radiolabeled RNA bands were excised. The RNAs were then eluted in a buffer containing 0.5 M ammonium acetate, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.1% SDS and purified by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. CV-1 cells were grown in monolayers in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells (5 × 108) were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and pelleted by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min. Lysate was prepared from these cells following the procedure described by Leopardi et al. (12Leopardi R. Hukkanen V. Vainionpaa R. Salmi A.A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 785-790Google Scholar). Briefly, the cell pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 10 mM NaCl. The cells were lysed by 4 cycles of freezing and thawing, and the cell nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min. The lysate was further clarified by centrifugation through 30% glycerol containing 25 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5) and 1 mM DTT at 150,000 × g for 1 h. The soluble fraction from the top of the glycerol cushion was either directly used in gel-mobility shift assay or subjected to column chromatography. For column chromatography, the extract was dialyzed overnight against 1 liter of buffer A containing 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5% glycerol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl, and 1 mM DTT and was loaded onto a DEAE-cellulose column (5 ml) equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was washed with 10 ml of buffer A, and the bound proteins were eluted with a linear 0-0.5 M gradient of NaCl in buffer A (30 ml of total volume). The individual fractions (2-μl aliquot) were used in gel mobility shift assay. Complex I-forming activity, present in the unbound fraction, was loaded onto a phosphocellulose column (3 ml) equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with the same buffer and eluted with a linear 0-1 M gradient of NaCl in buffer A (20 ml). The complex I-forming activity, eluted from the column, was further purified by successive chromatography on DEAE and phosphocellulose columns. The fractions containing 3′-GS binding activity were pooled and concentrated, and the protein concentration was estimated as 1.5 mg/ml. To purify the complex II forming activity, the pooled active fractions eluted from the first DEAE-cellulose column were loaded onto a Sephacryl S200 column (45 × 1 cm) equilibrated with buffer A. The column was developed with buffer A, and individual fractions were monitored for binding radiolabeled LS RNA. The active fractions were pooled and stored at −20°C. The protein concentration in the pooled fraction was estimated as 0.5 mg/ml. The binding of uniformly labeled 3′-GS- and plus-sense LS-RNA with the cellular proteins was performed following the procedure described by Leopardi et al. (12Leopardi R. Hukkanen V. Vainionpaa R. Salmi A.A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 785-790Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (20 μl) contained 15 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), 15 mM KCl, 0.25 mM EDTA, 0.25 mM DTT, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 μg/ml yeast tRNA, 10% glycerol, 0.1 ng of radiolabeled RNA, and unless otherwise indicated, 0.5 μg of purified cellular proteins. Incubation was done at room temperature for 30 min, and the samples were analyzed in a 6% native polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 × TBE (0.045 M Tris-borate, 0.001 M EDTA) buffer. The gel was run at 150 V at room temperature and then dried and subjected to autoradiography. Binding of purified cellular protein to the radiolabeled RNA was performed at room temperature for 30 min in the gel mobility shift assay buffer in a 96-well plate. The reaction mixture (20 μl) was then exposed to short wavelength UV light on ice at a 4-cm distance for 1 h. After UV cross-linking, the reaction mixture was incubated with RNase A (0.1 μg) for 15 min at 37°C. The proteins were analyzed in a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was stained, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. Proteins were resolved by electrophoresis in a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane according to the method of Matsudaira (14Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Google Scholar). The membrane was stained with Coomassie Blue, and the protein band was cut out. The protein was then sequenced on an Applied Biosystems model 470 sequenator equipped with on-line phenylthiohydantoin analysis using the regular program 03RPTH. Human lung carcinoma cells (A549) were grown in minimum Eagle's medium and were infected with HPIV3 at 10 PFU/cell. At 24 h postinfection, cell lysate was prepared according to Horikami and Moyer (15Horikami S.M. Moyer S.A. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 5342-5347Google Scholar). The cell lysate was used for immunoprecipitation of HPIV3 RNA with anti-GAPDH and anti-LA protein according to Chang et al. (9Chang Y.N. Kenan D.J. Keene J.D. Gatignol A. Jeang K.T. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7008-7020Google Scholar). The RNA was purified from the precipitated complex by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation and was analyzed by RNase protection assay using radiolabeled 3′-GS- and LS-RNA probes according to Kurilla et al. (16Kurilla M.G. Piwnica-Worms H. Keene J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 5240-5244Google Scholar). Intracellular RNP was isolated from HPIV3-infected CV-1 cells essentially as described by Toneguzzo and Ghosh (17Toneguzzo F. Ghosh H.P. J. Virol. 1976; 17: 477-491Google Scholar), with slight modification. CV-1 cells in monolayer were infected with HPIV3 at 20 PFU/cell, and the cells were harvested at 20 h postinfection. The cells were washed with 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 0.15 M NaCl and disrupted in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) by sonication. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and finally the RNP was purified from this supernatant by centrifugation through a 30% glycerol cushion at 40,000 rpm in an SW 50.1 rotor. The pelleted RNP was suspended in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) containing 10% glycerol and 1 mM DTT and stored in liquid nitrogen. CV-1 cells were grown on coverslips and infected with HPIV3 at 1 PFU/cell. At 24 h postinfection, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline followed by fixation with 3.6% paraformaldehyde and permeabilization with 1% Nonidet P-40. The fixed cells were treated with a mixture of rabbit anti-RNP and monoclonal anti-GAPDH or of rabbit anti-RNP and human anti-LA antibodies (18Nishiyama A. Stallcup W.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1983; 4: 1097-1108Google Scholar). For double labeling of RNP and GAPDH, the coverslips were washed and incubated with a mixture of fluorescein-conjugated anti-rabbit Ig and biotin-conjugated anti-mouse Ig secondary antibodies, followed by incubation with Texas Red-conjugated avidin. For double labeling of RNP and LA protein, the coverslips were washed and incubated with a mixture of fluorescein-conjugated anti-human Ig and biotin-conjugated anti-rabbit Ig secondary antibodies, followed by incubation with Texas Red-conjugated avidin. The coverslips were finally washed, mounted, and examined using a Leica CLSM confocal laser scanning microscope. To identify cellular proteins that might be involved in HPIV3 gene expression, we inserted cDNA copies of the first 73 nucleotides from the 3′-end of the genome as well as its complementary sequence into transcription vectors under the control of T7 promoter referred to as pUC3′GS and pUCLS, respectively. Transcription of the plasmid pUC3′GS by T7 RNA polymerase after linearization with HgaI gives rise to 3′-GS-RNA, while transcription from the plasmid pUCLS yielded the plus-sense LS-RNA (Fig. 1). The regulatory elements present within the 3′-GS-RNA include sites for the binding of viral RNA polymerase and putative cellular factors and also the intergenic trinucleotide GAA and NP gene start sequence that are believed to be involved in termination of the leader RNA and the initiation and capping of nascent RNA transcripts. The LS RNA, on the other hand, contains sites for initiation of encapsidation by NP and for interaction of viral and cellular proteins near the first intergenic region at which termination of RNA transcripts must be suppressed during replication. Radiolabeled 3′-GS- and LS-RNAs were used in gel mobility shift assays with CV-1 cell cytoplasmic proteins. As shown in Fig. 1B, cellular proteins formed two distinct complexes with the LS RNA (complex I and II) and virtually one complex with the 3′-GS-RNA (complex I). The complexes with both 3′-GS- and LS-RNA probes were abolished in the presence of 40-fold excess of corresponding unlabeled RNA, whereas 400-fold excess of unrelated competitor RNAs had no effect. In competition experiments with unlabeled heterologous RNA probes at 10-fold excess, complex I was significantly inhibited by both RNA probes, whereas 50-fold excess 3′-GS-RNA was required to inhibit the formation of complex II with LS RNA (data not shown). These results indicate that the formation of complex I most likely involves both sequence and structure of the RNA and that the same proteins are involved in interaction with the two RNA probes. Similar complexes were also formed when extracts were prepared from other cell lines such as human lung carcinoma (A549) and baby hamster kidney (data not shown), indicating the ubiquitous nature of the cellular proteins that formed complexes with the 3′-GS- and LS-RNAs of HPIV3. Next, we fractionated the CV-1 cell cytoplasmic extract using a DEAE-cellulose column where the complex I-forming activity was present in the unbound fraction and the complex II-forming activity was eluted from the column at around 0.4 M NaCl concentration (Fig. 2). Because the complex I- and II-forming activities were separable, we reasoned that two separate proteins were involved and set out to characterize the putative RNA-binding proteins.Fig. 2Chromatographic separation of complex I- and II-forming proteins. The CV-1 cell cytoplasmic proteins (S100) were subjected to chromatography on a DEAE-cellulose column as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Individual fractions (2 μl) were used in gel mobility shift assay with radiolabeled LS RNA. The complexes were analyzed by electrophoresis in 6% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography. The numbers at the top indicate the fraction eluted from DEAE-cellulose column, and U represents the unbound fraction. The migration positions of complex I and II are indicated on the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To characterize the cellular protein that formed complex I, we first performed UV cross-linking analysis with the DEAE-cellulose unbound fraction. However, our attempt to identify the polypeptide directly by UV cross-linking failed, and accordingly we sought complete purification of the protein. The DEAE-cellulose unbound fraction was loaded onto a phosphocellulose column, and the bound proteins were eluted with a linear 0-1 M NaCl gradient. The complex I-forming activity was eluted around 0.5 M NaCl concentration (data not shown). The active fractions were pooled and subjected to further purification by successive chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and phosphocellulose columns. The complex I-forming protein was purified to near homogeneity, and molecular mass was estimated as ~37 kDa by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3A). For further characterization, we performed microsequence analysis of the protein and compared it with the protein sequences available in the data base. As shown in Fig. 3, the partial sequence of the purified protein was virtually identical to the N terminus of bovine glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, a 37-kDa glycolytic enzyme (19Hanauer A. Mandel J.L. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2627-2630Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, the purified 37-kDa polypeptide reacted with a monoclonal anti-GAPDH antibody in Western blot analysis (Fig. 3B). Moreover, a commercial preparation of rabbit GAPDH (Boehringer Mannheim) also contained similar 3′-GS-RNA binding activity (Fig. 3C). Taken together, these data provide strong evidence that the complex I-forming protein is, in fact, GAPDH. Since GAPDH is not a bona fide RNA-binding protein but was shown to interact with poly(U) (20Ryazanov A.G. FEBS Lett. 1985; 192: 131-134Google Scholar, 21Singh R. Green M.R. Science. 1993; 259: 365-368Google Scholar), we investigated whether the stretches of U residues present in 3′-GS-RNA are involved in the interaction with GAPDH. As shown in Fig. 4A, the formation of complex I was inhibited by about 90% in the presence of 200-fold excess of poly(U), whereas a similar concentration of viral NP and P mRNAs had no effect, suggesting a role of U residues in this interaction. It is well documented that GAPDH contains an NAD+ binding site that is conserved among dehydrogenases (22Rossmann M.G. Liljas A. Branden C.I. Banaszak L.J. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. Vol 11. Academic Press, New York1976: 62Google Scholar) and has also been shown to be involved in the binding of GAPDH to AU-rich RNA sequences (23Nagy E. Rigby W.F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2755-2763Google Scholar). Therefore we tested whether this site is involved in the binding of 3′-GS-RNA. As shown in Fig. 4A, a high concentration of NAD+ (>10 μM) was required to abolish 3′-GS-RNA binding activity, and other dehydrogenases such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and lactate dehydrogenase virtually failed to bind 3′-GS-RNA (Fig. 4B), suggesting that the NAD+ binding domain constitutes a part of the 3′-GS-RNA binding site.Fig. 4Specificity of interaction of GSBP with the 3′-GS-RNA. A, in gel mobility shift assay containing GSBP (100 ng) and radiolabeled 3′-GS-RNA (0.1 ng), 200-fold excess of unlabeled competitor RNAs as indicated (HPIV3 NP and P mRNAs were synthesized in vitro from pET3a-derived vectors) and 10 μM NAD+ was added. B, gel mobility shift assay was performed with radiolabeled 3′-GS-RNA (0.1 ng) and 100 ng of the purified proteins, GSBP and commercial glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PDH) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (Boehringer Mannheim). P, phosphoprotein; NP, nucleocapsid protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To characterize the complex II-forming protein, we pooled the fractions containing LS RNA binding activity that eluted at around 0.4 M NaCl concentration from the DEAE-cellulose column (Fig. 2) and used them for further purification. The pooled fraction was subjected to chromatography on a Sephacryl S-200 column where the activity was eluted in a single peak (data not shown), and the purified protein was referred to as LSBP. As shown in Fig. 5A, the purified fraction contained several protein bands in a silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel. To identify the polypeptide that is directly involved in the interaction with LS RNA, UV cross-linking was performed. As shown in Fig. 5A, an ~50-kDa polypeptide was cross-linked to the radiolabeled LS RNA indicating its involvement in the formation of complex II. Involvement of the same polypeptide in the formation of complex II with 3′-GS-RNA, albeit at a low level, was also confirmed by UV cross-linking with radiolabeled 3′-GS-RNA (data not shown). We speculated that the 50-kDa protein identified in our study might be the cellular LS protein since in previous studies specific interaction of cellular LA protein, a bona fide RNA-binding protein, was shown to interact with several viral RNAs (7Kurilla M.G. Keene J.D. Cell. 1983; 34: 837-845Google Scholar, 8Kurilla M.G. Cabradilla C.D. Holloway B.P. Keene J.D. J. Virol. 1984; 50: 773-778Google Scholar, 9Chang Y.N. Kenan D.J. Keene J.D. Gatignol A.

Virol. 1993; 67: 3798-3807Google Scholar). To examine this possibility, we performed Western blot analysis of the purified LSBP with anti-LA antibody. As shown in Fig. 5B, the anti-LS antibody specifically recognized the 50-kDa protein and control recombinant LA protein, strongly suggesting that LA protein is involved in the formation of complex II. To further confirm its identity, the radiolabeled LS RNA was incubated with purified LSBP, and the complex was immunoprecipitated with anti-LA antibody using protein A-Sepharose. As the control, we used polyclonal anti-actin antibody in immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled LS RNA under identical conditions. As shown in Fig. 5C, only anti-LA antibody effectively precipitated the 73-nucleotide radiolabeled LS RNA. Finally, we used recombinant LA protein to study its ability to form complex II in a gel mobility shift assay using LS RNA. As shown in Fig. 5D, the recombinant LA protein efficiently interacted with the HPIV3 LS RNA forming complex II. This complex formation was solely mediated by the recombinant LA protein because identically processed bacterial proteins did not form any complex (Fig. 5D). These results clearly indicate that the cellular LA protein is directly involved in the formation of a specific complex, complex II, with the HPIV3 LS RNA. The above results prompted us to investigate whether GAPDH also interacts with the viral cis-acting RNA in HPIV3-infected cells. Monoclonal anti-GAPDH antibody was used to immunoprecipitate viral RNA, and the precipitated RNA was detected by RNase protection assay using radiolabeled LS RNA probe. As shown in Fig. 6A, radiolabeled LS RNA probe detected viral RNA precipitated by anti-GAPDH antibody from HPIV3-infected cells, indicating in vivo association of this cellular protein with HPIV3 RNA. Some precipitation of the genome-sense RNA by anti-actin antibody is observed that is possibly due to the association of actin with the RNP as a transcription factor (4De B.P. Burdsall A.L. Banerjee A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5703-5710Google Scholar). Next, we examined whether GAPDH remains associated with the viral RNP in HPIV3-infected cells. Intracellular RNP was isolated at different times postinfection, and the presence of GAPDH was determined by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 6B, GAPDH was specifically associated with the viral RNP during infection. Similarly, in vivo association of LA protein with HPIV3 RNA was investigated by immunoprecipitation of viral RNA with anti-LA antibody and analysis of the precipitated RNA by RNase protection assay using radiolabeled 3′-GS-RNA probe. As shown in Fig. 7A, the radiolabeled 3′-GS-RNA probe detected the viral RNA precipitated by anti-LA antibody, thus confirming in vivo association of HPIV3 RNA with the cellular LA protein. We also examined whether the interaction of LA protein with the HPIV3 RNA leads to a specific association of this cellular protein with the viral RNP. The intracellular viral RNP was isolated, and the presence of LA protein was determined by Western blot analysis using anti-LA antibody. As shown in Fig. 7B, the LA protein was detected in the RNP as early as 8 h postinfection and continued to be present in the RNP during the virus life cycle.Fig. 7In vivo association of LA protein with HPIV3 components. Interaction of LA protein with HPIV3 RNA and the intracellular viral RNP was studied. A, detection of LS RNA in La-bound form in HPIV3-infected A549 cells. The A549 cells were infected with HPIV3, and cell extract was prepared as described in Fig. 6 A. RNase protection assay was done using radiolabeled 3′-GS-RNA as the probe. The protected RNA was analyzed in 10% polyacrylamide-urea gel. B, in vivo association of LA protein with HPIV3 RNP.

In mammals, two different protein kinases are known to phosphorylate the regulated site in eIF-2α, serine 51. One is the RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), which is a component of the antiviral defense mechanism mediated by interferon (3Samuel C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7603-7606Google Scholar, 4Wek R.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 491-496Google Scholar, 5Proud C.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 217-256Google Scholar) and is thought to function as a suppressor of cell proliferation and tumorigenesis (6Koromilas A.E. Roy S. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. Sonenberg N. Science. 1992; 257: 1685-1689Google Scholar, 7Meurs E.F. Galabru J. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. Hovanessian A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 232-236Google Scholar, 8Barber G.N. Wambach M. Thompson S. Jagus R. Katze M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3138-3146Google Scholar). The second protein kinase, heme-regulated inhibitor, is found predominately in reticulocytes and bone marrow and is activated by reduced heme levels or heat shock (9Chen J.J. London I.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 105-108Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of mammalian eIF-2α inhibits general protein synthesis by impairing the conversion of eIF-2-GDP to eIF-2-GTP, a nucleotide exchange that is required for each round of translation initiation (1Jackson R.J. Trachsel H. Translation in Eukaryotes. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 193-229Google Scholar, 2Merrick W.C. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 291-315Google Scholar, 10Price N. Proud C. Biochimie. 1994; 76: 748-760Google Scholar). In yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a third eIF-2α kinase, GCN2 (general control nonderepressible), participates in the regulation of gene-specific translation (4Wek R.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 491-496Google Scholar, 11Hinnebusch A.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 409-414Google Scholar).In yeast, starvation for any one of several different amino acids enhances the translation of GCN4, a transcriptional activator of more than 30 genes involved in the biosynthesis of amino acids (12Hinnebusch A.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1988; 52: 248-273Google Scholar). Control of GCN4 translation involves four short upstream open reading frames located in the 5′-untranslated region of the GCN4 mRNA. In cells not limiting for amino acids, the upstream open reading frames block translational initiation of the GCN4 coding sequences. During amino acid starvation, GCN2 phosphorylation of eIF-2α is thought to lead to lowered eIF-2-GTP levels, thus reducing the inhibitory effects of the upstream open reading frames and allowing for increased GCN4 translation (11Hinnebusch A.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 409-414Google Scholar, 13Abastado J.-P. Miller P.F. Jackson B.M. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 486-496Google Scholar, 14Dever T.E. Feng L. Wek R.C. Cigan A.M. Donahue T.F. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 585-596Google Scholar).How does amino acid starvation stimulate the kinase function of GCN2? The carboxyl-terminal portion of the GCN2 protein kinase has homology to the entire sequence of histidyl-tRNA synthetases (HisRS) (Fig. 1) (15Wek R.C. Jackson B.M. Hinnebusch A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4579-4583Google Scholar). It has been proposed that uncharged tRNA that accumulates in cells starving for amino acids interacts directly with the HisRS-related sequences and stimulates phosphorylation of eIF-2α by GCN2 (14Dever T.E. Feng L. Wek R.C. Cigan A.M. Donahue T.F. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 585-596Google Scholar, 15Wek R.C. Jackson B.M. Hinnebusch A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4579-4583Google Scholar, 16Wek S.A. Zhu S. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4497-4506Google Scholar). Consistent with this model, we have shown that cells starving for any one of several different amino acids or containing a defective aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase allele, increase eIF-2α phosphorylation by GCN2 (16Wek S.A. Zhu S. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4497-4506Google Scholar). Class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, including HisRS (17Moras D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 159-164Google Scholar, 18Arnez J.G. Harris D.C. Mitschler A. Rees B. Francklyn C.S. Moras D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4143-4155Google Scholar), share three motifs, and mutations in the motif 2 sequence of GCN2 abolished phosphorylation of eIF-2α during these limiting conditions. This suggests that the HisRS-related sequences measure starvation for many different amino acids by interaction with their cognate uncharged tRNAs. In vitro binding studies showed that recombinant protein containing the HisRS-related domain of GCN2 can bind uncharged tRNA by a process requiring motif 2 sequences (16Wek S.A. Zhu S. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4497-4506Google Scholar).In this report we addressed whether the HisRS-related sequences are required for GCN2 phosphorylation of eIF-2α in an in vitro assay. Previous studies have relied on autophosphorylation of GCN2 in immunoprecipitation complexes as a measure of the activity of GCN2 kinase. To assay for the activity of GCN2 kinase in cellular extracts, we prepared a recombinant substrate containing a portion of yeast eIF-2α sequences. Phosphorylation of this recombinant substrate was dependent on GCN2 kinase activity and the eIF-2α phosphorylation site, serine 51. Mutations in the HisRS-related sequences that blocked stimulation of the general control pathway also greatly reduced in vitro phosphorylation of the recombinant eIF-2α. These results support the role of the HisRS-related sequences in the activation of GCN2 kinase function. Additionally, we observed that amino-terminal sequences in GCN2 that contain homology to a portion of a second kinase domain are required for in vitro phosphorylation of the eIF-2α.DISCUSSIONThe HisRS-related sequences have been proposed to enhance GCN2 phosphorylation of eIF-2α in response to interaction with different uncharged tRNAs that accumulate in cells starving for amino acids (14Dever T.E. Feng L. Wek R.C. Cigan A.M. Donahue T.F. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 585-596Google Scholar, 15Wek R.C. Jackson B.M. Hinnebusch A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4579-4583Google Scholar, 16Wek S.A. Zhu S. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4497-4506Google Scholar). Prior to this work, the evidence supporting this model included the observation that phosphorylation of eIF-2α by GCN2 in vivo was greatly elevated in response to starvation for one of several different amino acids (14Dever T.E. Feng L. Wek R.C. Cigan A.M. Donahue T.F. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 585-596Google Scholar, 16Wek S.A. Zhu S. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4497-4506Google Scholar). This increase in eIF-2α phosphorylation appeared to be directly controlled by uncharged tRNA levels because mutant cells containing a defective aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase showed elevated levels of phosphorylation of eIF-2α in the absence of amino acid limitation (16Wek S.A. Zhu S. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4497-4506Google Scholar). To determine if GCN2 activity required the HisRS-related sequences in an in vitro assay, we generated a truncated form of eIF-2α, suitable to serve as a kinase substrate in crude yeast lysates. We showed that the eIF-2α-ΔC substrate was phosphorylated in vitro by a process requiring active GCN2 kinase and the phosphorylation site serine 51. Phosphorylation of eIF-2α-ΔC was also greatly reduced when GCN2 contained mutations in the HisRS-related sequences. One of the mutants used in this study, gcn2-m2, was found previously to impair in vitro binding with uncharged tRNA (16Wek S.A. Zhu S. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4497-4506Google Scholar). We observed, however, that the gcn2-m2 protein could autophosphorylate in the immunoprecipitation kinase assay, which argues against these mutant residues inactivating GCN2 function by simply disrupting the basic structure of the kinase domain. Accumulatively, these in vivo and in vitro studies strongly support the model that the HisRS-related sequences function as a regulatory domain that binds different uncharged tRNA and stimulates the activity of the adjacent GCN2 kinase region.An important long term goal of our in vitro studies on the regulation of GCN2 is to determine which tRNAs stimulate kinase function. In the studies presented in this report, we have used extracts prepared from cells that were not limited for amino acids. We have carried out parallel experiments using lysates from amino acid-starved cells and have not found any further increase in phosphorylation of eIF-2α-ΔC by GCN2 kinase (data not shown). Our interpretation of this observation is that activation of GCN2 kinase may occur during the collection and breakage of cells grown under nonstarvation conditions. The cell lysates used in the kinase assays presented in this study contain tRNA, and the charging levels may be substantially reduced in a cell lysate. Additionally, breakage of cells with glass beads may release activating RNA, such as immature tRNA, from cellular compartments not accessible to GCN2 in vivo. In support of this premise, we have added uncharged total yeast tRNA or in vitro synthesized tRNAHis to crude lysates or more enriched preparations of GCN2 and have failed to observe any further enhancement of GCN2 phosphorylation of eIF-2α-ΔC. Experiments characterizing more purified samples of GCN2 should address this issue, although the apparent requirement for GCN2 association with ribosomes for in vivo phosphorylation of eIF-2α (27Ramirez M. Wek R.C. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3027-3036Google Scholar) may complicate these studies.Our analysis of the HisRS-related mutants in the in vitro kinase assay indicated a reduction in both the levels of autophosphorylation and eIF-2α phosphorylation. This coupling implies that GCN2 phosphorylation may participate in the activation of this kinase. A previous study (19Wek R.C. Ramirez M. Jackson B.M. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2820-2831Google Scholar) also observed that GCN2 is phosphorylated in cells grown in the presence of [32P]orthophosphate, but the level of radioactivity was not appreciably different between reactions using wild-type GCN2 and kinase-defective gcn2-K559R. This suggests that there may be multiple phosphorylation sites in GCN2, some of which serve as substrates for a second protein kinase. The location and role of phosphorylation in the stimulation of GCN2 kinase function is not yet understood. It is noteworthy, however, that autophosphorylation is thought to be an obligate step in the activation of PKR, the related eIF-2α kinase that is also regulated by RNA (3Samuel C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7603-7606Google Scholar, 28Kostura M. Mathews M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1576-1586Google Scholar, 29Galabru J. Katze M.G. Robert N. Hovanessian A.G. Eur. J.

Future studies that identify and mutate phosphorylation sites in GCN2 and PKR will be important to address the role of post-translation modification in the regulation of these eIF-2α kinases. INTRODUCTIONA family of serine/threonine protein kinases regulate protein synthesis by phosphorylation of the α subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor-2 (eIF-2) 1The abbreviations used are: eIFeukaryotic initiation factorPKRRNA-dependent protein kinaseHisRShistidyl-tRNA synthetase(s)PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

In mammals, two different protein kinases are known to phosphorylate the regulated site in eIF-2α, serine 51. One is the RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), which is a component of the antiviral defense mechanism mediated by interferon (3Samuel C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7603-7606Google Scholar, 4Wek R.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 491-496Google Scholar, 5Proud C.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 217-256Google Scholar) and is thought to function as a suppressor of cell proliferation and tumorigenesis (6Koromilas A.E. Roy S. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. Sonenberg N. Science. 1992; 257: 1685-1689Google Scholar, 7Meurs E.F. Galabru J. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. Hovanessian A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 232-236Google Scholar, 8Barber G.N. Wambach M. Thompson S. Jagus R. Katze M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3138-3146Google Scholar). The second protein kinase, heme-regulated inhibitor, is found predominately in reticulocytes and bone marrow and is activated by reduced heme levels or heat shock (9Chen J.J. London I.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 105-108Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of mammalian eIF-2α inhibits general protein synthesis by impairing the conversion of eIF-2-GDP to eIF-2-GTP, a nucleotide exchange that is required for each round of translation initiation (1Jackson R.J. Trachsel H. Translation in Eukaryotes. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 193-229Google Scholar, 2Merrick W.C. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 291-315Google Scholar, 10Price N. Proud C. Biochimie. 1994; 76: 748-760Google Scholar). In yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a third eIF-2α kinase, GCN2 (general control nonderepressible), participates in the regulation of gene-specific translation (4Wek R.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 491-496Google Scholar, 11Hinnebusch A.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 409-414Google Scholar).In yeast, starvation for any one of several different amino acids enhances the translation of GCN4, a transcriptional activator of more than 30 genes involved in the biosynthesis of amino acids (12Hinnebusch A.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1988; 52: 248-273Google Scholar). Control of GCN4 translation involves four short upstream open reading frames located in the 5′-untranslated region of the GCN4 mRNA. In cells not limiting for amino acids, the upstream open reading frames block translational initiation of the GCN4 coding sequences. During amino acid starvation, GCN2 phosphorylation of eIF-2α is thought to lead to lowered eIF-2-GTP levels, thus reducing the inhibitory effects of the upstream open reading frames and allowing for increased GCN4 translation (11Hinnebusch A.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 409-414Google Scholar, 13Abastado J.-P. Miller P.F. Jackson B.M. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 486-496Google Scholar, 14Dever T.E. Feng L. Wek R.C. Cigan A.M. Donahue T.F. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 585-596Google Scholar).How does amino acid starvation stimulate the kinase function of GCN2? The carboxyl-terminal portion of the GCN2 protein kinase has homology to the entire sequence of histidyl-tRNA synthetases (HisRS) (Fig. 1) (15Wek R.C. Jackson B.M. Hinnebusch A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4579-4583Google Scholar). It has been proposed that uncharged tRNA that accumulates in cells starving for amino acids interacts directly with the HisRS-related sequences and stimulates phosphorylation of eIF-2α by GCN2 (14Dever T.E. Feng L. Wek R.C. Cigan A.M. Donahue T.F. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 585-596Google Scholar, 15Wek R.C. Jackson B.M. Hinnebusch A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4579-4583Google Scholar, 16Wek S.A. Zhu S. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4497-4506Google Scholar). Consistent with this model, we have shown that cells starving for any one of several different amino acids or containing a defective aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase allele, increase eIF-2α phosphorylation by GCN2 (16Wek S.A. Zhu S. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4497-4506Google Scholar). Class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, including HisRS (17Moras D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 159-164Google Scholar, 18Arnez J.G. Harris D.C. Mitschler A. Rees B. Francklyn C.S. Moras D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4143-4155Google Scholar), share three motifs, and mutations in the motif 2 sequence of GCN2 abolished phosphorylation of eIF-2α during these limiting conditions. This suggests that the HisRS-related sequences measure starvation for many different amino acids by interaction with their cognate uncharged tRNAs. In vitro binding studies showed that recombinant protein containing the HisRS-related domain of GCN2 can bind uncharged tRNA by a process requiring motif 2 sequences (16Wek S.A. Zhu S. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4497-4506Google Scholar).In this report we addressed whether the HisRS-related sequences are required for GCN2 phosphorylation of eIF-2α in an in vitro assay. Previous studies have relied on autophosphorylation of GCN2 in immunoprecipitation complexes as a measure of the activity of GCN2 kinase. To assay for the activity of GCN2 kinase in cellular extracts, we prepared a recombinant substrate containing a portion of yeast eIF-2α sequences. Phosphorylation of this recombinant substrate was dependent on GCN2 kinase activity and the eIF-2α phosphorylation site, serine 51. Mutations in the HisRS-related sequences that blocked stimulation of the general control pathway also greatly reduced in vitro phosphorylation of the recombinant eIF-2α. These results support the role of the HisRS-related sequences in the activation of GCN2 kinase function. Additionally, we observed that amino-terminal sequences in GCN2 that contain homology to a portion of a second kinase domain are required for in vitro phosphorylation of the eIF-2α."

Based on the dichotomy of the ubiquitous distribution of the myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) gene mRNAs compared to their cell type-restricted activity, we investigated the basis for their tissue specificity. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using the muscle creatine kinase MEF2 DNA binding site as a probe showed that HeLa, Schneider, L6E9 muscle, and C2C12 muscle cells have a functional MEF2 binding activity that is indistinguishable based on competition analysis. Interestingly, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter assays showed MEF2 site-dependent trans-activation in myogenic C2C12 cells but no trans-activation by the endogenous MEF2 proteins in HeLa cells. By immunofluorescence, we detected abundant nuclear localized MEF2A and MEF2D protein expression in HeLa cells and C2C12 muscle cells. Using immuno-gel shift analysis and also co-immunoprecipitation studies, we show that the predominant MEF2 DNA binding complex bound to MEF2 sites from either the muscle creatine kinase or c-jun regulatory regions in C2C12 muscle cells is comprised of a MEF2A homodimer, whereas in HeLa cells, it is a MEF2A:MEF2D heterodimer.

https://openalex.org/W2143645222,"Abstract Synaptojanin is an Src homology 3 domain-binding inositol 5-phosphatase that is thought to function in synaptic vesicle endocytosis. It is encoded by a cDNA with two open reading frames separated by an in-frame stop codon. The first open reading frame encodes a 145-kDa form of the protein, whereas a 170-kDa isoform appears to be composed of both open reading frames and contains additional Src homology 3 domain-binding consensus sequences. Here, we demonstrate that the two synaptojanin isoforms are generated by the alternative use of an exon containing the stop codon. Whereas the 145-kDa isoform is highly enriched in adult brain, the 170-kDa isoform is excluded from this tissue and has a widespread distribution in non-neuronal cells. Unlike the 145-kDa isoform, which can be removed from membranes by a low salt wash, the 170-kDa isoform remains membrane-associated, even in the presence of 1 M salt. Further, the 170-kDa form, but not the 145-kDa form, can be isolated from membranes as part of a large molecular weight complex. These properties may allow the 170-kDa isoform of synaptojanin to play a unique and perhaps more general role in endocytosis as compared with the 145-kDa isoform."

(1993) Science 260, 352-355). The present study investigates the properties of Klenow polymerase containing a 24-amino acid deletion (residues 590-613) that removes a portion of the tip of the thumb. The mutant polymerase has relatively normal dNTP binding and catalytic rate. However, its DNA binding affinity is reduced by more than 100-fold relative to the intact polymerase and its ability to conduct processive synthesis is also reduced. Although the mutant polymerase has relatively normal base substitution fidelity, it has strongly reduced frameshift fidelity, being especially error-prone for single nucleotide addition errors in homopolymeric runs. The addition error rate increases as the length of the reiterated sequence increases, indicative of errors initiated by template-primer strand slippage. These observations suggest a role for the tip of the thumb of Klenow polymerase in determining DNA binding, processivity and frameshift fidelity, perhaps by tracking the minor groove of the duplex DNA.

The polymerase active site is on a 45-kDa COOH-terminal domain of Klenow fragment, and the 3′→ 5′ proofreading exonuclease active site is on the smaller NH2-terminal domain. Structural information obtained from crystal structures of Klenow fragment demonstrates that the polymerase domain resembles a partially open right hand with three subdomains that form a cleft (for review, see Joyce and Steitz (26Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 777-822Google Scholar)). The palm is located at the base of the cleft and contains the catalytically important carboxylates. The fingers form one wall of the cleft and the thumb another. The functional importance of the cleft is made apparent by the large number of residues on the exposed surfaces in this region that are highly conserved or invariant among the polymerase families (Delarue et al., 17Delarue M.

Co-crystals of Klenow fragment with duplex DNA bound in an editing complex suggest the DNA is oriented such that the template-primer approaches the catalytic site from the side adjacent to the 3′→ 5′ exonuclease (Beese et al., 12Beese L.S. Derbyshire V. Steitz T.A. Science. 1993; 260: 352-355Google Scholar). Biochemical studies including cross-linking and footprinting experiments have suggested that 5-8 base pairs of duplex DNA are covered by Klenow fragment when the primer terminus is in the polymerase active site (Joyce and Steitz, 25Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 288-292Google Scholar; Allen et al., 2Allen D.J. Darke P.I. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4601-4607Google Scholar; Catalano et al., 15Catalano C.E.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8759-8770Google Scholar). The fingers subdomain has been suggested to contact the template strand and possibly to interact with the incoming dNTP (for a review, see Joyce and Steitz (26Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 777-822Google Scholar)). Numerous interactions are seen between highly conserved residues in the thumb subdomain and the phosphate backbone of the duplex DNA (Beese et al., 12Beese L.S. Derbyshire V. Steitz T.A. Science. 1993; 260: 352-355Google Scholar). Similar interactions have also been reported recently in a co-crystal of Taq DNA polymerase (a homolog of E. coli DNA polymerase I) with a blunt-ended duplex DNA (Eom et al., 20Eom S.H. Wang J. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1996; 382: 278-281Google Scholar). Klenow fragment catalyzes high fidelity DNA synthesis (Kuchta et al., 32Kuchta R.D. Benkovic P. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6716-6725Google Scholar; Bebenek et al., 9Bebenek K. Joyce C.M. Fitzgerald M.P. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13878-13887Google Scholar), having rates of approximately 10−5 and 10−6 errors per nucleotide polymerized, respectively, for single-base substitution and single-base deletion errors. Although exonucleolytic proofreading contributes somewhat to this high fidelity, most of the discrimination results from the high selectivity of the polymerase. Polymerase errors arise by either of two initiating events, misinsertion of a dNMP or slippage of the template-primer (reviewed by Kunkel (35Kunkel T.A. BioEssays. 1992; 14: 303-308Google Scholar)). For the former, Klenow fragment discriminates against incorporation of an incorrect dNMP during both dNTP binding and catalysis (Kuchta et al., 32Kuchta R.D. Benkovic P. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6716-6725Google Scholar). Thus, it seems likely that side chains located in the fingers and palm subdomains at or near the polymerase active site may provide some of the key interactions responsible for high base substitution fidelity. For example, a previous study showed that substituting serine for tyrosine at residue 766, located on the exposed surface of the O helix in the fingers subdomain, resulted in reduced nucleotide discrimination (Carroll et al., 14Carroll S.S. Cowart M. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 813-822Google Scholar). In contrast, nucleotide addition and deletion errors occurring at reiterated sequences are thought to result from an initial template-primer slippage event (for a review, see Kunkel (34Kunkel T.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8003-8011Google Scholar)). DNA polymerases differ widely in their propensity to commit such errors, and frameshift error rates correlate with their ability to conduct processive synthesis. For example, DNA polymerase γ is highly processive and is also highly accurate for frameshift errors, whereas DNA polymerase α is somewhat less processive and has lower frameshift fidelity and DNA polymerase β is non-processive and highly error prone for frameshifts (Kunkel, 33Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5787-5796Google Scholar). Studies with the wild-type HIV-1 reverse transcriptase revealed that hot spots for frameshifts at reiterated sequences were also sites that exhibited a strong probability of termination of processive synthesis (Bebenek et al., 8Bebenek K. Abbotts J. Roberts J.D. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16498-16956Google Scholar). Moreover, when the DNA sequence surrounding these sites was altered, especially in the duplex template-primer near the 3′-OH terminus, concomitant increases or decreases in both frameshift error rates and termination probabilities resulted (Bebenek et al., 10Bebenek K. Abbotts J. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10324-10334Google Scholar). These correlations suggest that polymerase dissociation-reassociation allows formation and/or utilization of misaligned frameshift intermediates containing unpaired bases in the primer strand (for an addition) or the template strand (for a deletion). Thus, polymerase selectivity against these errors may depend on protein interactions with the duplex template-primer stem. Studies of altered forms of two different DNA polymerases have supported this idea. T7 DNA polymerase contains a polymerase subunit and a smaller subunit, thioredoxin, that is proposed to clamp the polymerase to the template-primer. The holoenzyme conducts highly processive and highly accurate replication. However, DNA synthesis in the absence of thioredoxin was much less processive and highly error-prone for frameshift errors in homopolymeric runs (Kunkel et al., 37Kunkel T.A. Patel S.S. Johnson K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6830-6834Google Scholar; Kroutil et al., 31Kroutil L.C. Register K. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1046-1053Google Scholar). Moreover, while most DNA polymerases generally commit deletion errors at a substantially higher rate than addition errors (for review, see Kunkel (34Kunkel T.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8003-8011Google Scholar)), the reverse was true for synthesis by T7 DNA polymerase in the absence of thioredoxin, i.e. the addition error rate far exceeds the deletion error rate. This unusual error specificity is relevant to observations in the present study (see below). Studies with mutants of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase have also suggested the importance of interactions between a polymerase and the duplex template-primer stem to processivity and frameshift fidelity. The structure of the RT·DNA complex (Jacobo-Molina et al., 1993) has revealed that α helix H lies adjacent to the primer strand near the 3′-OH primer terminus, in the region where single-nucleotide changes were observed to affect the processivity (Abbotts et al., 1Abbotts J. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10312-10323Google Scholar) and the frameshift fidelity (Bebenek et al., 10Bebenek K. Abbotts J. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10324-10334Google Scholar) of the wild-type RT. Two derivatives of the RT (G262A and W266A), which contained single amino acid changes on the side of helix H that faces the primer strand, had reduced DNA binding affinity (Beard et al., 1994) and reduced processivity and fidelity for errors initiated by strand slippage (Bebenek et al., 11Bebenek K. Beard W.A. Casas-Finet J.R. Kim H.-R. Darden T.A. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19516-19523Google Scholar). These two amino acids are thought to make minor groove contacts with the duplex DNA within either three nucleotides (for W266A) or four to five nucleotides (for G262A) of the 3′-OH primer terminus. The thumb subdomain of Klenow fragment contains two long anti-parallel α-helices, designated H and I, with a 50-amino acid connecting segment that was disordered in the initial crystals (Ollis et al., 38Ollis D.L. Brick P. Hamlin R. Xuong N.G. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1985; 313: 762-766Google Scholar). Subsequent analysis of a Klenow fragment-DNA co-crystal (Beese et al., 12Beese L.S. Derbyshire V. Steitz T.A. Science. 1993; 260: 352-355Google Scholar), in which the tip of the thumb was apparently better ordered than in the apoenzyme structure, revealed that this region contains two short α-helices, designated H1 and H2, with random coils connecting these helices to each other and to helices H and I. Comparison of the native Klenow fragment structure with that of the enzyme bound to duplex DNA suggests that significant movement of the thumb subdomain occurs upon binding DNA, so that the NH2 terminus of helix H1 was seen to contact the minor groove of the duplex DNA in the co-crystal structure (Beese et al., 12Beese L.S. Derbyshire V. Steitz T.A. Science. 1993; 260: 352-355Google Scholar). In this paper, we describe the properties of a mutant derivative of Klenow fragment having a 24-amino acid deletion in the tip of the thumb. In comparison to the wild-type Klenow fragment polymerase, this mutant has lower DNA binding affinity and reduced processivity. It also has decreased fidelity for additions and deletions occurring in homopolymeric runs, whereas its base substitution fidelity is similar to that of the wild-type polymerase. E. coli strains, reagents, and preparation of gapped substrates were as described (Bebenek and Kunkel, 7Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Google Scholar). The Δ(590-613) mutation was made by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis using a uracil-containing M13 template, which contained the polymerase domain region of the polA gene (Polesky et al., 41Polesky A.H. Steitz T.A. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14579-14591Google Scholar). The mutagenic oligonucleotide was a 30-mer capable of forming 15 base pairs at either end of the 72-nucleotide segment encoding residues 590-613 on the DNA polymerase I sequence (Joyce et al., 27Joyce C.M. Kelley W.S. Grindley N.D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 262: 3-13Google Scholar). A DNA fragment containing the mutation was subcloned into a high level expression plasmid for Klenow fragment, which also contained the D424A (3′→ 5′ exonuclease-deficient) mutation, as described previously (Polesky et al. 41Polesky A.H.

Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 3-13Google Scholar). The purified D424A mutant derivative of Klenow fragment (Derbyshire et al., 1988) was used as a control for comparison purposes. The denaturation temperature (Tm) of the Δ(590-613) mutant protein was measured using a CD spectrophotometer assay that has been described elsewhere (Astatke et al., 4Astatke M. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 269: 28091-28097Google Scholar). The steady-state parameters, Km(dTTP) and kcat, for the Δ(590-613) mutant protein were determined using poly(dA)·oligo(dT)16, as described elsewhere (Astatke et al., 4Astatke M. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 269: 28091-28097Google Scholar). Because the Δ(590-613) mutant protein has a much lower affinity for DNA compared to the wild-type protein, the concentration of DNA (20 μM in primer termini) was approximately 10-fold higher than in our previous experiments. The kcat for the reaction was found to be identical, within experimental error, when the primer concentration was raised to 40 μM, verifying that a concentration of 20 μM was indeed saturating. The dissociation constant, KD(DNA), for binding to a 68-mer hairpin oligonucleotide was determined using a gel mobility shift assay (Astatke et al., 4Astatke M. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 269: 28091-28097Google Scholar). In recent experiments, the gel conditions have been modified slightly from those in our previous work; 10% polyacrylamide gels were used instead of 8%, and the gels were run at higher ionic strength (50 mM Tris borate). The increase in buffer concentration avoids the need for circulating the reservoir buffers during the run, thus increasing the convenience of the procedure. These changes had no effect on the observed KD(DNA) values. The probability of termination of processive synthesis was analyzed using a primed single-stranded M13mp2 DNA substrate as described previously (Abbotts et al., 1Abbotts J. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10312-10323Google Scholar). 5′-32P-end-labeled primers were complementary to lacZ positions 141-161 (designated lacZ 141) and −37 to −17 (lacZ −37). Reaction conditions were the same as those for DNA synthesis fidelity measurements described below, except that the DNA (160 fmol) was in 300-fold molar excess over the wild-type Klenow fragment DNA polymerase (0.53 fmol) or in 15-fold molar excess over the Δ(590-613) derivative (11 fmol). In these, as in earlier reactions containing an excess of template-primer DNA over polymerase (Eckert and Kunkel, 19Eckert K.A. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13462-13471Google Scholar), the amount of reinitiation on previously extended template-primer molecules relative to the total pool of product DNA was negligible, such that termination probabilities reflected one cycle of processive synthesis. Thirty-microliter reactions were incubated at 37°C, and 10-μl aliquots were removed at 5, 15, and 30 min and quenched by addition of an equal volume of formamide dye (99% (v/v) formamide, 5 mM EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) xylene cyanol, and 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue). Products were analyzed by electrophoresis through a 16% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, and the amount of radioactivity in the product bands was quantified using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager (Sunnyvale, CA). The probability of the polymerase terminating at a specific site along the DNA template is defined as the ratio of the number of product molecules of a given length to the sum of that number plus the number of all longer products. DNA synthesis fidelity was measured as described previously (Bebenek and Kunkel, 7Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Google Scholar) using an M13mp2 DNA substrate with a single-stranded gap containing a portion of the lacZ α-complementation gene target. DNA synthesis reactions (25 μl) contained 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 150 ng of gapped DNA, 0.17 pmol of wild-type Klenow fragment or 6.8 pmol of mutant Klenow fragment, and 1 mM each of the four dNTPs. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 10 min, quenched by addition of EDTA to 15 mM, and analyzed for complete gap-filling synthesis by agarose gel electrophoresis. All reactions filled the gap to the extent that products migrated coincident with nicked circular duplex DNA (Bebenek and Kunkel, 7Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Google Scholar). Products were introduced into E. coli and plated and synthesis errors identified by plaque phenotype. The forward mutation assay scores a variety of errors as light blue or colorless plaques. The DNAs of mutant phage were sequenced to define the polymerase error specificity, as described previously (Bebenek and Kunkel, 7Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Google Scholar). For reversion assays, polymerase errors were scored as blue-plaque revertants of M13 substrates containing mutations encoding colorless plaque phenotypes. One-base deletions were scored in a substrate containing 5 consecutive Ttemplate·Aprimer base pairs, with the coding sequence of the starting substrate in the +1 reading frame. One-base additions (and two-base deletions) were scored in a series of substrates containing 4, 5, 6, or 7 consecutive Ttemplate·Aprimer base pairs flanked by similar neighboring nucleotides (see below), each with the coding sequence of the starting substrate in the minus-one reading frame (see Kroutil et al. (31Kroutil L.C. Register K. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1046-1053Google Scholar)). Base substitutions were monitored at a TGA codon at position 87-89 in the reporter gene, with any of eight different mispairs yielding blue plaques. 613) Mutant Klenow Fragment—We made a mutation that removes 24 amino acids from the mobile region at the tip of the thumb subdomain of Klenow fragment. The mutation was designed at a time when no structural information was available for this part of the Klenow fragment molecule. In an attempt to minimize structural perturbations that might affect the rest of the molecule, we chose to leave a substantial number of residues beyond the published boundaries of helices H and I (Ollis et al., 38Ollis D.L. Brick P. Hamlin R. Xuong N.G. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1985; 313: 762-766Google Scholar). We were also able to keep similar amino acids adjacent to one another on the primary sequence by using the pair of leucine residues at positions 590 and 614; thus, the dipeptides Ile-Leu and Val-Leu at the boundaries of the deletion were replaced by Ile-Leu in the deletion mutant. Further structural data that were subsequently obtained for the intact Klenow fragment molecule showed two additional helices, H1 and H2, at the tip of the thumb subdomain (Beese et al., 12Beese L.S. Derbyshire V. Steitz T.A. Science. 1993; 260: 352-355Google Scholar). The Δ(590-613) deletion eliminates the entire region connecting helices H1 and H2 as well as a few amino acids at the COOH terminus of helix H1 and the NH2 terminus of helix H2. 2J. Jäger and T. A. Steitz, personal communication. The deletion is therefore likely to cause substantial structural changes in the thumb tip. Moreover, the missing residues include Thr-609 and Glu-611, which have been reported to contact two backbone phosphates on the primer strand (Beese et al., 12Beese L.S. Derbyshire V. Steitz T.A. Science. 1993; 260: 352-355Google Scholar). In spite of these predictions, the Δ(590-613) mutant protein has essentially the same denaturation temperature as wild-type Klenow fragment (Table I), so that it is probably reasonable to assume that the structural changes resulting from the 24-amino acid deletion are confined to the tip of the thumb subdomain.Table I.Kinetic and equilibrium constants for the polymerase reaction catalyzed by Klenow fragment and the Δ(590-613) mutant derivativeProteinaThe proteins in this study carry the D424A mutation and are therefore deficient in 3′→ 5′ exonuclease activity.Km(dTTP)kcat(dTTP)KD(DNA)TmμMs−1nM°CWild-typebData for the wild-type polymerase have been taken from Astatke et al.

Open table in a new tab The properties of the Δ(590-613) polymerase are compared here with those of its wild-type counterpart. Both proteins carry the D424A mutation that inactivates 3′→ 5′ exonuclease activity (Derbyshire et al., 18Derbyshire V. Freemont P.S. Sanderson M.R. Beese L. Friedman J.M. Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. Science. 1988; 240: 199-201Google Scholar), thus focusing on processes occurring within the polymerase domain. To simplify the descriptions, the two proteins are referred to by the genotype of the polymerase domain. 613) Mutant Protein—Consistent with the view that the structural changes associated with the 24-amino acid deletion are not transmitted to the polymerase active site region, neither dNTP binding, measured by Km(dTTP), nor the rate of the polymerase reaction (kcat) were greatly affected by the Δ(590-613) mutation (Table I). In contrast, the mutation decreased the DNA binding affinity by at least 100-fold, as might be expected given the contacts seen between this region of the thumb subdomain and duplex DNA in a co-crystal of Klenow fragment with DNA (Beese et al., 12Beese L.S. Derbyshire V. Steitz T.A. Science. 1993; 260: 352-355Google Scholar). The consequences of the decreased DNA binding affinity of the Δ(590-613) derivative of Klenow fragment were readily seen when the processivity of the mutant polymerase (Fig. 1A, lane 2) was compared to that of the wild-type polymerase (Fig. 1A, lane 3). The processivity of the mutant was reduced such that, when averaged over 18 positions with two different template-primers (Fig. 1, B and C), the probability of termination of processive synthesis increased 4-fold. The increase in termination probability varied from almost none at nucleotide 137 (Fig. 1C) to 9-fold at nucleotide −44 (Fig. 1B). Similar results have been obtained with two additional M13-derived substrates and with poly(dA) primed with oligo(dT). 3C. M. Joyce, unpublished observations. The accuracy of DNA synthesis catalyzed by the wild-type and mutant Klenow fragment was first examined in reversion assays that monitor substitution or deletion errors at specific template positions in the lacZ reporter gene. Using a substrate that scores frameshift errors, the reversion frequency was 9-fold higher for the Δ(590-613) mutant polymerase than for the wild-type enzyme. Thus, the Δ(590-613) polymerase is a mutator for frameshift errors. In contrast, with a substrate that detects base substitution errors, gap-filling synthesis by the mutant Klenow fragment resulted in an average reversion frequency that was similar to that observed with wild-type Klenow fragment (Table II).Table II.Fidelity of wild-type and mutant Klenow fragment polymerasePolymerasePlaques scoredMutant frequencyTotalMutantsBase substitution reversion assayWild-type270 × 1039134 × 10−5Δ(590-613)260 × 1039136 × 10−5Frameshift reversion assayaThe lacZ coding sequence is in plus-one reading frame (see “Methods”), permitting detection of 3n − 1 errors (e.g. −1, −4, +2, +5, etc.).

Open table in a new tab Because polymerase frameshift error rates are strongly influenced by DNA sequence context, we wanted to determine whether the mutator phenotype of the Δ(590-613) enzyme is general, i.e. manifest at multiple template sites, and whether the Δ(590-613) enzyme is a mutator for frameshift errors not scored in the above reversion assay (e.g. one-base additions). We, therefore, examined the error specificity in a forward mutation assay that scores frameshifts at 199 positions in the lacZ target sequence, 241 different base substitutions at 125 sites, and additions and deletions of larger numbers of bases as well as complex mutations (Bebenek and Kunkel, 7Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Google Scholar). The results of two independent experiments with this assay yielded lacZ mutant frequencies among the products of gap-filling that were slightly higher for the Δ(590-613) polymerase than for the wild-type enzyme (Table II). DNA samples from 98 independent mutants generated by the Δ(590-613) polymerase were isolated and sequenced to determine the error specificity. These da"

The SH2 domain of the Src family kinase Lck is phosphorylated at tyrosine 192 in T cells upon T cell antigen receptor triggering. We have studied the consequences of this phosphorylation on the properties of the SH2 domain and on the function of Lck in T cell activation. We report that phosphorylation at Tyr192 reduced the capacity of the isolated SH2 domain to bind a high affinity peptide ligand and Tyr(P)-containing cellular proteins. This effect was mimicked by mutation of Tyr192 to an acidic residue. In intact T cells, where Lck participates in T cell antigen receptor signal transduction in an SH2 domain-dependent manner, phosphorylation of Tyr192 correlated with reduced downstream signaling. Our results indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation of the SH2 domain of Lck terminates its high affinity binding to ligands, thereby negatively regulating its participation in T cell antigen receptor signaling.

Although the first pocket is well conserved among SH2 domains, the residues of the SH2 domain that form and surround the second pocket vary more.

Transcripts of hUBC9 of 4.4 kilobases (kb), 2.8 kb, and 1.3 kb were found in all human tissues tested. A single copy of the hUBC9 gene was found and localized to human chromosome 16p13.3. We conclude that hUBC9 retains striking structural and functional conservation with yUBC9 and suggest a possible link of the ubiquitin/proteosome proteolytic pathway and the WT1 transcriptional repressor system. INTRODUCTIONThe ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation system has been recognized as a complete enzymatic pathway that is responsible for the selective degradation of abnormal and short-lived proteins (1Finley D. Chau V. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 25-69Google Scholar, 2Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 761-807Google Scholar). In this process, ubiquitin is covalently linked to target proteins prior to their degradation through the combined action of three classes of proteins, the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), 1The abbreviations used are: E1ubiquitin-activating enzymeE2ubiquitin-conjugating enzymeE3ubiquitin-protein ligasePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisHAhemagglutininkbkilobase(s)Mbmegabase(s)FISHfluorescence in situ hybridization. ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2), and in some cases, the ubiquitin-protein ligases (E3) that are believed to be important in substrate recognition. E1 catalyzes the ATP-dependent formation of a thioester bond between the C-terminal glycine of ubiquitin and the active site cysteine of E1. “Activated” ubiquitin is then transferred to the active site cysteine of an E2 enzyme which itself, or in conjunction with an E3 protein, catalyzes the formation of an isopeptide bond between the C-terminal glycine of ubiquitin and a lysine ϵ-amino group in the protein targeted for degradation by the 20 S proteosome complex. The diversity and multiple protein-protein interactions of the ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic system suggests that a high degree of regulation is required to achieve the specificity needed to control the fate of the different proteins that are degraded through ubiquitination. It is likely that ubiquitin-conjugating (E2) enzymes may contribute to the determination of which groups of protein are targeted for selective degradation.The ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s) are a family of proteins characterized by a highly conserved catalytic site containing an invariant active site cysteine (3Jentsch S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 179-207Google Scholar). In yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, at least 10 different E2s have been identified that are involved in essential cellular processes such as DNA repair, cell cycle control, and stress responses (4Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Google Scholar), suggesting that E2 enzymes may be key players in establishing the diversity of the ubiquitin-proteolytic system. Although genetic analysis in yeast has revealed that ubiquitin conjugation is essential to cell viability (5Seufert W. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 543-550Google Scholar, 6Seufert W. Futcher B. Jentsch S. Nature. 1995; 373: 78-81Google Scholar), only a few cellular targets of the ubiquitin protein ligase system have been identified. These include cyclin B and the yeast transcription factor MATa2 (7Glotzer M. Murray A.W. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 1991; 349: 132-138Google Scholar, 8Hochstrasser M. Ellison M.J. Chau V. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4606-4610Google Scholar). Recently, the ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic system has also been shown to actively participate in the degradation of p53 (9Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Google Scholar), in the degradation and processing of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (10Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R.

Madden S.L. Deuel T.F. Rauscher III, F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 268: 9172-9175Google Scholar), colony stimulating factor 1 (18Harrington M.A. Konieck B. Song A. Xia X.L. Fredericks W.J. Rauscher III, F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21271-21275Google Scholar), and transforming growth factor β1 (19Dey B.R. Sukhatme V.P. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Rauscher III, F.J. Kim S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 595-602Google Scholar). Previously, we identified two separate domains (residues 85-179 and 250-266) of WT1 that function independently as transcriptional repressors (20Wang Z.Y. Qiu Q.Q. Huang J. Gurrieri M. Deuel T.F. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 415-422Google Scholar, 21Wang Z.Y. Qiu Q.Q. Deuel T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9172-9175Google Scholar). When expressed independently of its zinc finger domain, the proximal repressor domain (amino acids 85-179) relieved the repressor activity of wild type WT1 in a dose-dependent manner (22Wang Z.-Y. Qiu Q.-Q. Gurrieri M. Huang J. Deuel T.F. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1243-1247Google Scholar), suggesting the presence of an interactive protein with WT1 in vivo. In order to identify and clone the gene encoding this interactive protein, we have used the yeast two-hybrid system with the proximal repressor domain of WT1 as “bait.” We report here the isolation and characterization of cDNA clones that encode the human homolog of the yeast ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (yUBC9) that specifically interacts with the proximal repressor domain of WT1 in the yeast two-hybrid system and with WT1 in co-immunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase assays. The results suggest that UBC9 may be involved in the transcription regulation mediated by WT1.RESULTSTo identify the WT1 interactive protein previously described (22Wang Z.-Y. Qiu Q.-Q. Gurrieri M. Huang J. Deuel T.F. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1243-1247Google Scholar), a human placental cDNA/Gal4 transcriptional activation domain fusion library was screened in the yeast two-hybrid system with the proximal repressor domain of WT1 as bait. Eleven of 2 × 106 clones screened were strongly positive in the yeast two-hybrid screen, and seven of these clones encoded portions of the same protein. Each of the encoded proteins of the 7 positive clones interacted strongly with the bait but failed to interact with the LexA DNA-binding domain alone, with lamin C, or with the second repressor domain of WT1 (residues 250-260) (Table I). These data suggest that the interaction of the protein products of the 7 related positive clones with the proximal repressor domain of WT1 is specific.To obtain full-length cDNAs, a placental cDNA library was probed with one of the positive clones. Eight independent clones with inserts of 0.6, 1.1, and 1.8 kb were isolated. The 1.8-kb and 1.1-kb cDNAs were fully sequenced. The two cDNA clones share the initial 15 base pairs upstream of the translation start site and the entire coding as well as 3′-untranslated regions. However, the two cDNA clones differ in the more 5′-untranslated regions, presumably the result of alternative splicing. The longest open reading frame of each clone predicts a protein product of 157 amino acids (Fig. 1A). To establish that the cDNAs encoded protein, each of the cDNA clones was tested by in vitro transcription/translation. Each cDNA encodes a protein that migrated identically in SDS-polyacrylamide gels with a mobility consistent with the predicted 157-amino acid protein products (data not shown).The predicted amino acid sequence of the two cDNA clones was compared with protein sequences deposited in GenBank™. A 56% identity was established between the predicted amino acid sequence of our clones and yeast ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 9 (yUBC9), a nuclear protein that is required for cell growth and that is involved in the degradation of S- and M-phase cyclins (6Seufert W. Futcher B. Jentsch S. Nature. 1995; 373: 78-81Google Scholar). The predicted protein product contains the active site cysteine residue (residue 93 boxed, Fig. 1B) necessary for thioester formation and the ubiquitin conjugating activity of all E2 enzymes. To establish that our clone encodes a functional UBC9 homolog, the 1.1-kb human cDNA was expressed in a yeast carrying a temperature-sensitive (ts) yUBC9 mutation (6Seufert W. Futcher B. Jentsch S. Nature. 1995; 373: 78-81Google Scholar). The human UBC9 homolog fully restored normal growth to the yeast strain carrying the yUBC9 ts mutant at the otherwise nonpermissive temperature (Fig. 2). This result indicates that the cDNA we isolated encodes a biologically active human homolog of yUBC9 that is structurally and functionally highly conserved with yUBC9. We have designated our gene as human (h) UBC9.Fig. 2Human UBC9 complements the loss of yeast UBC9 gene function. Yeast strain W9432 carrying the temperature-sensitive ubc9-1 allele was transformed with control vectors (row 1, p416GAL1; row 4, pSE936) or constructs expressing either a human UBC9 cDNA (row 2) or the yeast UBC9 gene (row 3). To compare growth of these strains, cells were spotted in a dilution series on galactose-containing plates and incubated for 3.5 days at the permissive temperature (23°C) or 2 days at the restrictive temperature (34°C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We compared the predicted amino acid sequence of hUBC9 with other E2 enzymes. Identification in regions of amino acid sequence were established within a number of other ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, some of which are shown in Fig. 3. The UBCs from human, pea, yeast S. cerevisiae, and Arabidopsis thaliana retain a striking degree of amino acid identity in several domains between the UBC9 and UBC4 families (Fig. 3), suggesting perhaps some degree of functional overlap among UBC9 and UBC4.Fig. 3A multiple sequence alignment of the Arabidopsis UBC9 sequence, the yeast UBC9 and UBC4 sequences, and the human UBC9 and UBC4 sequences. The sequences were aligned using the PILEUP algorithm. PILEUP is part of the Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package. An amino acid is placed in the consensus sequence if it is located at that position in four of the five aligned sequences.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To further establish the specificity of the interaction of hUBC9 with the N-terminal repressor domain of WT1 that was revealed in the yeast two-hybrid screening, glutathione S-transferase (GST) capture assays were used. Human UBC9 was expressed as a GST-fusion protein, coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads, and incubated with extracts from 293 cells that express the full-length (or fragments) of WT1. Eluates were analyzed by Western blots with a rabbit anti-WT1 polyclonal antisera. Repeated experiments demonstrated that GST-hUBC9 “captures” WT1 from lysates of 293 cells (Fig. 4A). In control experiments, the GST-hUBC9 fusion protein failed to capture the C-terminal DNA-binding domain of WT1 that lacks the N-terminal amino acid repressor domain used as bait in the yeast two-hybrid screening. GST alone failed to capture WT1 (Fig. 4A), and GST-hUBC9 failed to capture proteins from control 293 cells that did not express WT1 (Fig. 4A). These data support the specificity of the interaction between the N-terminal repressor domain of WT1 and hUBC9.Fig. 4The interaction of WT1 and hUBC9. A, in vitro interactions of WT1 and hUBC9. The full-length hUBC9 cDNA was fused in-frame with the GST and expressed as the GST-hUBC9 fusion protein. GST and GST-hUBC9 fusion proteins were bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads. Extracts from 293 cells that expressed WT1 and deletion mutants of WT1, WT1Δ1-84, WT1Δ297-429, and WT1Δ1-294, were incubated with GST and GST-fusion protein bound to Sepharose beads for 2-3 h. Following washing with lysis buffer, beads were eluted with SDS gel loading buffer and separated by 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose filters for immunoblotting with antibodies against N- and C-terminal portions of WT1 and visualized by fluorography. B, co-immunoprecipitation of WT1 and hUBC9 from 293 cells expressing WT1 and HA-hUBC9. Extracts of 293 cells were first immunoprecipitated with either anti-WT1 (WTC-19) or a nonspecific antibody (anti-Gal4 DNA binding domain), separated on 15% SDS-PAGE, blotted, and probed with anti-HA tag monoclonal antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Co-immunoprecipitation also was used to establish the specificity of the interactions of hUBC9 and WT1. hUBC9 was fused at its amino terminus with an influenza (flu) hemagglutinin (HA) “tag,” the flu-“tagged” hUBC9 was co-expressed with WT1 in 293 cells, and extracts of co-expressing cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-WT1 polyclonal antisera and washed extensively. The immunoprecipitates were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, blotted, and analyzed in Western blots with an anti flu-tag monoclonal antibody. The flu-tagged hUBC9 was identified in lysates from cells that co-expressed WT1 and flu-tagged hUBC9 (Fig. 4B). The flu-tagged hUBC9 was not observed in the same lysates when a polyclonal anti-Gal4 antiserum was substituted for the anti-WT1 antisera in the immunoprecipitation step, and immunoprecipitate of lysates of cells that expressed hUBC9 alone (without WT1) did not contain proteins recognized by anti-HA antibody (Fig. 4B). Taken together, the results of the yeast two-hybrid screening, GST fusion protein capture assay, and co-immunoprecipitation strongly support the conclusion that the N-terminal repressor domain of WT1 and hUBC9 interact specifically both in vivo and in vitro.Northern blots from different human tissues were used to identify the tissues that expresses hUBC9. Transcripts of 4.4, 2.4, and 1.3 kb were identified in each of the tissues that were examined (Fig. 5A). Heart and smooth muscle have higher levels of hUBC9 transcript relative to the other tissues analyzed, whereas the 2.4-kb mRNA isoform is relatively less expressed in kidney, suggesting that the hUBC9 is ubiquitously expressed but at different levels in different tissues.Fig. 5A, Northern blot of hUBC9 in different human tissues. A human tissue Northern blot (Clontech) was probed with the 1.1-kb hUBC9 cDNA. Each lane contained 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from heart (H), brain (B), placenta (Pl), lung (L), smooth muscle (SM), kidney (K), and pancreas (Pa). The β-actin cDNA was used to probe the same blot as control. The size markers are indicated on the left side of the blot. B, Southern blot analysis of the hUBC9 gene. 10 μg of human genomic DNA were digested with HindIII (H), EcoRI (E), BglII (Bg), or BamHI (B), and DNA fragments were separated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel. The blot was probed with the 1.1-kb hUBC9 cDNA probe.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To determine the chromosomal locus of hUBC9, we first probed blots of human genomic DNA with the 1.1-kb cDNA fragment and observed single hybridization bands in BglII and BamHI digests (Fig. 5B), suggesting that hUBC9 is a single-copy gene. The human UBC9 was then mapped in human metaphase chromosomes by FISH. The hUBC9 probe hybridized on the short arm of human chromosome 16 in 22 of 26 metaphase spreads examined. Among 94 fluorescent signals on all chromosomes, 55 (58.5%) were located on band 16p13. Most signals localized distally at subband 16p13.3 (Fig. 6). A mouse/human somatic cell panel with average distance between breakpoints of 1.2 Mb and a potential resolution of 1 Mb was used to further fine map the gene. Major bands of approximately 20 kb and 8.5 kb and mouse bands of 9.5 kb, 6 kb, and 3.2 kb were observed in the Southern blots. The human band of 20 kb was present on chromosome 16 and was present in the hybrids CY189 and CY193 but absent from the hybrids CY14, CY192, and additional hybrids with more proximal breakpoints of CY200, CY193 to CY189, indicating that hUBC9 maps between (data not shown).Fig. 6Chromosomal localization of hUBC9 probe by FISH on human metaphase chromosomes. Note specific hybridization of fluorescein-labeled probe to subband 16p13.3.

Qiu Q.-Q. Gurrieri M. Huang J. Deuel T.F. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1243-1247Google Scholar) that modulates WT1 repressor activity is hUBC9. This conclusion is based upon the specificity of the interaction of the N-terminal but not the C-terminal repressor domain of WT1 with hUBC9, the failure of lamin C to interact with WT1 in the yeast two-hybrid system, and upon the specificity of the interaction of hUBC9 and WT1 demonstrated in co-immunoprecipitation and GST capture assays. The data also indicate significant identity of primary structure and retention of the invariant active site cysteine residue between the predicted amino acid sequence of our cDNA clones and yUBC9. Our cDNA clone functionally complements yeast carrying a temperature-sensitive UBC9 gene mutant, indicating that hUBC9 is fully functional as an E2 enzyme in yeast and that we have cloned the human homolog of the yUBC9. Human UBC9 retains a high degree of amino acid identity with other UBCs that have been cloned and is most closely related to the UBC4 family. The potential importance of the highly conserved domains that we have identified among UBCs is unclear, but these domains may be important in selective interactions with specific target proteins.The ability of our cDNA to fully rescue yeast that contain a temperature-sensitive mutant is a striking example of functional conservation from yeast to human and suggests a highly important role of the UBC9s throughout evolution. In yeast, UBC9 is involved in cell cycle progression. Yeast UBC9 is required for degradation of S- and M- phase cyclins and for viability (6Seufert W. Futcher B. Jentsch S. Nature. 1995; 373: 78-81Google Scholar). In this context, it is important to note that WT1 blocks cell cycle progression and that this block is relieved by expression of exogenous cyclin E and CDK2 as well as cyclin D1/CDK4 (27Kudoh T. Ishidate T. Moriyama M. Toyoshima K. Akiyama T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4517-4521Google Scholar). Because of the striking conservation of primary structure and because hUBC9 fully complements yeast with yUBC9 temperature-sensitive mutations to allow normal progression of yeast through the cell cycle, we suggest that hUBC9 may have a similar role in eukaryotic cells. The results also suggest that the interaction of WT1 with hUBC9 may be important in the cell cycle block imposed by WT1.Human hUBC9 is an extraordinarily conserved protein in evolution from yeast to man. Whereas its precise role in human cells is unknown, the requirement of UBC9 in yeast for normal cell cycle progression and the specific interactions with WT1 suggest important roles of hUBC9 in mammalian cells and raise the possibility of important roles of ubiquitination in regulation of transcription.

If homodimerization of the EPO receptor activates it, then bivalent antibodies raised to the extracellular domain of the EPO receptor should also homodimerize and activate. Mouse monoclonal antibodies (IgG) raised to the soluble, extracellular domain of the human EPO receptor (EPOR) were found that would stimulate thymidine uptake of an human EPO-dependent cell line, UT-7/EPO. Dose response curves showed bell shapes where activity was low at low and high concentrations. Monovalent (Fab) fragments bound to the receptor but did not stimulate thymidine uptake, which indicates that two antibody binding sites are required for activation. The anti-EPOR antibodies stimulated the formation of burst forming unit erythroid colonies from human CD34+ cells purified from peripheral blood.

It stimulates erythroid progenitors to proliferate and differentiate via binding to and activation of an EPO receptor expressed on the surface of cells. The murine and human EPO and EPO receptor genes have been cloned (1D'Andrea A.D. Lodish H.F. Wong G.G. Cell. 1989; 57: 277-285Google Scholar, 2Jones S.S. D'Andrea A.D. Haines L.L. Wong G.G.

The human EPOR gene encodes a 508-amino acid protein that includes a 25-amino acid signal peptide, a 225-amino acid extracellular domain, a 22-amino acid transmembrane domain, and a 236-amino acid cytoplasmic domain. The EPO receptor is a member of a family of cytokine receptors that includes receptors for prolactin, growth hormone, interleukins 2-7, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, leukemia inhibitory factor, thrompopoietin ligand, and ciliary neurotrophic factor (7Bazan J.F.

The family is also characterized by a lack of an identifiable protein tyrosine kinase domain in their intracellular region. Activation of the receptors by ligand binding induces a cascade of signaling events including phosphorylation of the EPO receptor (12Miura O. D'Andrea A.D. Kabat D. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell.

Down modulation of the signal transduction pathway is also effected by binding of the protein phosphatase SH-PTP-1 to the C-terminal region (18Klingmueller U. Lorenz U. Cantley L.C. Neel B.G.

Activation of many different receptors is thought to occur by oligomerization of the receptors (for reviews see 19Heldin C.-H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Google Scholar and 20Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Trends Biochem Sci. 1994; 19: 459-463Google Scholar). One of the most studied systems is growth hormone receptor where complexes have been shown to consist of two receptors bound to one ligand (21Cunningham B.C. Ultsch M. DeVos A.M. Mulkerrin M.G. Clauser K.R. Wells J.A. Science. 1991; 254: 821-825Google Scholar, 22DeVos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Google Scholar). In this case the ligand is thought to act as a cross-linker bringing the receptors into close proximity whereupon they bind and interact with signaling molecules. EPO exists as a monomer in solution but is thought to contain two receptor binding sites. Thus it also may act as a cross-linker bringing two receptor subunits together. However, reports of putative EPOR subunits cloud the issue. Support for EPOR activation by dimerization comes from several sources. Oligomerization of the EPO receptor has been reported, although this can occur in the absence of EPO (23Miura O. Ihle J.N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 200-208Google Scholar). In addition a murine EPO receptor with an Arg129 to Cys mutation has been reported to be constitutively active via cross-linking through the cysteines (24Watowich S.S. Yoshimura A. Longmore G.D. Hilton D.J. Yoshimura Y. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2140-2144Google Scholar, 25Yoshimura A. Longmore G. Lodish H.F. Nature. 1990; 348: 647-649Google Scholar). A retrovirus expressing this constitutively active form of the EPO receptor causes polycythemia in mice and infected cells can differentiate in the presence of a burst promoting activity and serum in the absence of EPO (26Longmore G.D. Pharr P.N. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2266-2277Google Scholar), which suggests that dimerization may support both proliferation and differentiation of erythroid precursor cells. In order to extend the studies on the mechanism of EPOR activation, we decided to test for a non-EPO reagent that could cross-link and thus perhaps activate EPO receptors in a controlled manner. One method that may homodimerize receptors is by interaction of two receptors with a monoclonal antibody raised to the extracellular domain of the EPO receptor. This is possible because an antibody (e.g. IgG) contains two antigen binding sites. However, there have been numerous reports of anti-EPO receptor antibodies, but none were reported to activate. We have screened monoclonal antibodies raised to the extracellular domain of the EPO receptor for their ability to activate the EPO receptor. Four antibodies out of 96 that recognized EPO receptor in ELISA were identified that had this property. One of these was found to support formation of BFUe colonies from erythroid precursors. This suggests that a subset of anti-EPOR antibodies can homodimerize the EPO receptor. This homodimerization is sufficient for activation resulting in signals that support both proliferation and erythroid differentiation. Balb/c mice (Charles Rivers Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) were immunized with subcutaneously injected soluble EPO receptor. Soluble EPO receptor was purified from medium conditioned by CHO cells expressing a cDNA encoding the EPO receptor signal peptide and the first 225 amino acids of the human EPO receptor (Met1-Pro249 as shown in 2) by affinity and conventional chromatography (V. Parker, Ken Aoki and Tom Strickland (Amgen)). Four days after the final injection spleens were collected and the splenocytes were fused to Sp2/0-Ag14 mouse myeloma cells (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD accession no. CRL 1581) using the polyethylene glycol procedure as described (27Campbell A.M. Burdon R.H. Knippenberg R.H. Laboratory Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Vol 13.

Tissue culture supernatants of hybridomas selected on HAT medium were tested by ELISA for specific antibody reactivity to rHuEPORs. Ninety six hybridomas which were positive in ELISA (96) were subjected to further screening. Antibodies of interest were purified from ascites or tissue culture by protein-A column chromatography. Protein-A purified immunoglobulin was further fractionated into its 2 component parts, the crystallizable fraction (Fc) and the monovalent antibody-binding fraction (Fab), using a Pierce ImmunoPure Fab Preparation kit (Pierce). SDS-PAGE analysis of antibodies and antibody fragments indicated that monovalent antibodies of the expected size were generated. Purified, soluble EPOR coated microtiter plates blocked with 5% BSA were used. Samples diluted in PBS/1% BSA were added to each well, incubated at room temperature then rinsed with wash solution (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Inc.). Wells were then incubated with Goat anti-mouse IgG heavy- and light- chain specific horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody (Boehringer Mannheim Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). The immunoreactivity measured by the various antibodies was then determined colorometrically using ABTS Peroxidase single component substrate (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Inc.). Hybridomas were selected as positive if optical density scored greater than 5-fold above background. rHuEPORs was denatured by boiling in 5% 2-mercaptoethanol and 0.1%SDS, bound to the nitrocellulose membrane then blocked with 2% non-fat dry milk, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 25 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.09% Tween 20, 0.01% anti-foam A. Hybridoma conditioned medium was next added followed by 3 washes with TS-Tween (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 0.02% Tween 20) and 2 × with TBS-Tween (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5 0.5 M NaCl, 0.09% Tween 20). HRP-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG in TS-Tween was incubated in each well for 45 min. at RT. Membranes were washed as before and the amount of antibody bound was determined using an ECL kit (Amersham Corp.). Each well was scored - to +++ based on intensity of dots. Real-time biospecific interaction analysis (BIA, Pharmacia Biosensor AB, Uppsala, Sweden) is based on surface plasmon resonance (SPR) (29Fägerstam L. Frostell A. Karlsson R. Kullman M. Larsson A. Malmqvist M. Butt H. J. Mol. Recogit. 1990; 3: 208-214Google Scholar) and was used to screen the ELISA positive supernatants. Soluble rHuEPOR was covalently coupled to the sensor chip CM5 via primary amines. Each analysis cycle included an injection of 20μl of hybridoma supernatant, followed by injection of 10μl of 10 mM HCl for regeneration of the chip. The SPR response is measured in Resonance Units (RU). Results of screening 96 wells which were positive in ELISA are shown in Table I. In these experiments, background binding is about 20 RU.Table I.Characterization of anti-EPO receptor antibodiesAntibodyBIAcoreaBinding to EPO receptor is measured by BIAcore analysis.

Open table in a new tab The initial antibody screen used CHO cells transformed with human EPO receptor sequences (Met1-Tyr467) (2Jones S.S. D'Andrea A.D. Haines L.L. Wong G.G. Blood. 1990; 76: 31-35Google Scholar). CHO cells scraped from tissue culture dishes were washed and resuspended as single cells in a 96-well round bottom plate. Cells were suspended in either a negative control media or in one of the anti-EPOR hybridoma supernatants at 4°C for 1 h. After the incubation, cells were washed with PBS/BSA and then resuspended in a solution of fluorescine isothiocyanate labeled goat anti-mouse monoclonal antibody (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL). The cells were incubated again at 4°C for 1 h, washed, and analyzed on a Becton Dickenson FACscan (San Jose, Ca), and the data were analyzed using Cellquest software. To test purified antibody preparations, UT-7 cells (30Komatsu N. Nakauchi H. Miwa A. Ishihara T. Eguchi M. Moroi M. Okada M. Sato Y. Wada H. Yawata Y. Suda T. Miura Y Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 341-348Google Scholar) were used. Cells were suspended in either PBS/BSA (control) or rHuEPO at a concentration of 500 μg/ml (EPO block) at 4°C for 45 min. Cells were washed twice with PBS/BSA and incubated a final time at 4°C with phycoerythrin-labeled goat anti-mouse monoclonal antibody (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL). After a wash and resuspension the cells were analyzed by FACscan as described above. UT-7/EPO cells (31Komatsu N. Yamamoto M. Fujita H. Miwa A. Hatake K. Endo T. Okano H. Katsube T. Fukumaki Y. Sassa S. Miura Y. Blood. 1993; 82: 456-464Google Scholar) were grown in growth medium (1 × Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium with L-glutamine/25 mM HEPES buffer and 3024 mg/liter sodium bicarbonate/10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum/1% (v/v) L-glutamine-penicillin-streptomycin solution (Irvine Scientific)/1 unit/ml rHuEPO) to approximately 3 × 105 cells/ml. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with PBS, and resuspended at 5 × 104 cells/ml in assay medium (1 × RPMI medium 1640 without L-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.)/1%L-glutamine/4% fetal bovine serum). Test samples or rHuEPO standard, 100 μl diluted in assay medium at least 5-fold, were added to wells in a 96-well microtiter plate. 50 μl of cells was then added (5,000 cells/well), and plates were incubated in a humidified incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2. After 72 h, 50 μl of methyl-[3H]thymidine (1 mCi/ml, 20 Ci/mmol) diluted 1:100 in assay medium was added. Cells were incubated for an additional 4 h at 37°C and 5% CO2. Labeled cells were harvested onto glass fiber filtermats using a PHD cell harvester (Cambridge Technology Inc., Watertown, MA) and deionized water as a washing solution. Filters were rinsed a final time with 2-propanol, then dried, and counted in a Beckman Model LS6000IC scintillation counter. To purify CD34+ erythroid cell precursors, normal human donors were lymphopheresed according to standard protocol. The lymphopheresed cells were washed, resuspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution and separated by density centrifugation over a gradient (Ficoll-Paque). The low density cells were collected from the gradient, washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution, and resuspended in PBS supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 5 mM EDTA at a concentration of 5 × 108 cells/ml. The low density cells were then further purified using a CD34 progenitor cell isolation kit (QBend/10) made by Miltenyi Biotech GmbH. The in vitro BFUe assay was done on the purified CD34+ in methylcellulose using serum free growth conditions (32Ponting I.L.O. Izumi R. Covey T. Exp. Hematol. 1994; 22: 496Google Scholar) as described previously (33Elliott S. Boone T. Chang D. Delorme E. Dunn C. Egrie J. Giffin J. Lorenzini A. Talbot C. Hesterberg L. Blood. 1996; 87: 2714-2722Google Scholar). In brief, the medium contains 0.33 × Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), salts, 2-mercaptoethanol, nucleosides, cholesterol, sodium pyruvate, human transferrin, lipids, human insulin, deionized BSA, and 100 ng/ml stem cell factor. The medium contained no serum, hydrocortisone, proteins, or growth factors other than those listed. Duplicate samples contained CD34+ cells (10,000 cells/ml), stem cell factor (100 μg/ml), and a combination of sample and medium totaling 1 ml. The 35 × 100-mm tissue culture plates were incubated at 37°C with 10% CO2 in a humidified tissue culture incubator. Erythroid colonies (orange to red in color) were scored after 21 days. OCIM1 (34Broudy V.C. Lin N. Egrie J. De Haen C. Weiss T. Papayannopoulou T. Adamson J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6513-6517Google Scholar) cells were grown in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium/10% fetal bovine serum/1% penicillin-streptomycin-fungisone to approximately 2-5 × 105 cells/ml. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed two times in binding buffer (RPMI 1640/1% BSA/25 mM HEPES, pH 7.3), and then resuspended in binding buffer containing 0.1% azide and 10 μg/ml cytochalisin B at 1-2 × 107 cells/ml. Cells (100 μl) in 96-well tissue culture plates were then incubated with 10 μl of sample and 10 μl of 125I-EPO diluted 1:10 (Amersham Corp.; high specific activity, 3000 Ci/mmol, 2 mCi/ml) in a 37°C humidified tissue culture incubator. After 3 h, cells were centrifuged through phthalate oil (60:40 (v/v) dibutyl/dinonyl phthalate) in titer tubes. The tubes containing cell pellets were quick frozen in a dry ice-ethanol bath, and the cell pellet was clipped and then counted in a LKB 1277 gammamaster automatic γ counter. Mice were immunized with a purified preparation of the 225-amino acid soluble extracellular domain of the human EPO receptor produced in CHO cells. Conditioned medium from hybridomas generated from the immunized mice were screened for immunoreactivity to EPO receptor by ELISA assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The assay uses an anti-mouse IgG secondary (signal) antibody. Thus only IgG antibodies were identified. 96 of the hybridomas that tested positive in this assay were screened further to identify those that retained activity in immunodot blots and in BIAcore binding experiments. The results for selected antibodies are shown in Table I. The hybridomas were tested to identify those antibodies that were capable of binding to EPO receptor expressed on the surface of cells. Five of 96 antibody-containing supernatants produced positive signals by FACscan analysis. Positive signals were defined as those that resulted in a mean cell fluorescence greater than controls labeled only with the secondary antibody. The positive signals came from mAbs 58, 71, 73, 74, and 87 (Table I). FACscan results using UT-7 cells and purified antibodies indicated that mAb 71 had the greatest mean cell fluorescence followed by mAbs 58, 74, and 73. The binding could be inhibited by preincubation with EPO, which suggests that the antibodies bound at or close to the EPO binding site. Positive FACscan signals were also observed for OCIM1 (human) cells (34Broudy V.C. Lin N. Egrie J. De Haen C. Weiss T. Papayannopoulou T. Adamson J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6513-6517Google Scholar) and 32D cells (35Greenberger J.S. Sakakeeny M.A. Humphries R.K. Eaves C.J. Eckner R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2931-2935Google Scholar, 36Ihle J.N. Peppersack L. Rebar L. J. Immunol. 1981; 126: 2184-2189Google Scholar) that had been transformed with a human EPO receptor. The untransformed 32D cells gave no signal. This indicates that the binding detected in FACscan is specific for cells expressing an EPO receptor. To establish further that the antibodies bound at the EPO binding site, cold displacement assays were done. OCIM1 cells were incubated with 125I-EPO and varying amounts of cold rHuEPO or purified anti-EPOR antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1, unlabeled rHuEPO displaced 125I-EPO from cells as expected. mAbs 71, 58, and 74 also displaced rHuEPO, albeit not as effectively as rHuEPO. mAb 73 had a modest effect, if any, and a control antibody had no effect. This suggests that the antibodies 58, 71, and 74 competed with rHuEPO for binding to the EPO receptor. Thus, these antibodies do in fact specifically recognize surface expressed EPOR, and they bind in a way that interferes with rHuEPO binding. Homodimerization of the EPO receptor is thought to be mechanism for its activation. We reasoned that because IgG antibodies have two identical binding sites, some antibodies may be able to dimerize two EPO receptor monomers and thus activate them. We therefore tested the hybridoma supernatants containing anti-EPOR mAbs to see if any would stimulate thymidine uptake in the EPO-dependent cell line UT-7/EPO. Two antibodies were identified from this initial screen that stimulated thymidine uptake, mAbs 71 and 73 (Table I). Several others gave ambiguous or weak responses. mAb 71 recognized denatured rHuEPOR and mAb 73 did not. Both mAb 71 and mAb 73 recognized surface receptor as measured by FACscan. The assay was also performed in the presence of rHuEPO to identify neutralizing antibodies. Several inhibited rHuEPO activity including mAbs 58 and 71. This result was confirmed for mAb 71 by testing a purified preparation for neutralizing activity (see Fig. 5). Other antibodies inhibited weakly included mAbs 65, 88, and 89. To test the antibodies further, we performed dose response experiments with purified antibodies. The four best FACscan positive antibodies including mAb 71 and mAb 73 were used in this study. As shown in Fig. 2 all four antibodies could stimulate thymidine uptake in UT-7/EPO cells. Several different negative control antibodies were also tested, and no positive response was observed (data not shown). The two strongest activators, mAbs 58 and 71 showed bell-shaped dose response curves with maximum stimulation at approximately 1 μg/ml. Stimulation by antibodies required higher concentrations than was required for rHuEPO stimulation. The EC50 for rHuEPO, mAb 71, mAb 58, mAb 74, and mAb 73 were approximately 5 pM, 50 pM, 500 pM, 250 mM, and >500 nM, respectively. mAb 58 differed from rHuEPO and mAb 71 in that it was unable to stimulate to the same extent. The maximum amount of thymidine incorporation was half that of mAb 71. To establish that stimulation of thymidine uptake by mAb 71 was due to activation of the EPO receptor, we performed an experiment with soluble human EPO receptor to see if it would inhibit activation of UT-7/EPO cells. Soluble EPOR would be expected to bind EPO or mAb 71, thus preventing them from binding EPOR on the surface of the cells. When this experiment was done, the soluble EPOR inhibited activation of UT-7/EPO cells by rHuEPO in a dose-dependent manner. In a similar manner activation of UT-7/EPO cells by mAb 71 was also inhibited (data not shown). These results suggest that stimulation of thymidine uptake in UT-7/EPO by mAb 71 was due to activation of human EPOR and was not due to other nonspecific effects. The bell-shaped activation curves for mAbs 71 and 58 are consistent with inhibition at high doses because the excess antibody to EPOR would not allow dimerization. That is, when antibody is in excess, EPOR·mAb complexes would be present primarily in 1:1 ratios instead of 2:1. This result suggests that activation is due to dimerization of receptors. If this is the case, then monovalent Fabs prepared from an activating antibody would be unable to stimulate thymidine uptake in UT-7/EPO cells because they could not form 2:1 EPOR·mAb complexes. Monovalent Fabs were prepared from mAbs 71 and 73. Fig. 3 shows that neither Fab 71 nor Fab 73 would stimulate thymidine uptake in UT-7/EPO cells. Both of the Fabs can still inhibit binding of rHuEPO to surface expressed EPO receptor as shown in Fig. 4. mAb 71 and Fab 71 also act as an EPO antagonist at high concentrations as shown in Fig. 5. This indicates that the Fabs retain the ability to bind to EPOR but lack the ability to activate EPOR. This suggests further that two binding sites on anti-EPOR antibodies are required for EPOR activation.Fig. 4Cold displacement of rHuEPO from OCIM1 cells by monovalent and bivalent antibodies. OCIM1 cells and 125I-EPO were incubated for 3 h with the indicated amounts of rHuEPO (•), mAb 71 (○), mAb 73 (▪), Fab 71 (▾), and Fab 73 (□). Cells were rinsed free of unbound reagents, and the cell bound radioactivity was determined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) EPO has several different activities including stimulation of proliferation, stimulation of differentiation, and inhibition of apoptosis. If dimerization of the EPO receptor is a necessary and sufficient event for these activities, then an activating antibody should support the formation of erythroid colonies from hematopoietic precursors because all three activities must be present for this to occur. To test this possibility, BFUe assays were performed using purified CD34+ cells from human blood. The medium contained stem cell factor, insulin, and BSA but had no serum or other proteins. rHuEPO under these conditions supported the growth and differentiation of BFUe from these cells. In a similar manner mAb 71 also supported growth of these cells (Fig. 6). Control samples lacking rHuEPO or mAb 71 as well as a sample containing a similar dose of a control monoclonal antibody did not result in any erythroid colonies. We found that stem cell factor in combination with either rHuEPO or mAb 71 was required for erythroid colony formation. No erythroid colonies were observed with stem cell factor alone. This result suggests that the cytokine requirements for BFUe growth and differentiation are similar for rHuEPO and mAb 71. The colonies grown in the presence of mAb 71 were fewer in number and were smaller in size than rHuEPO grown BFUe. However, they had an orange to red color consistent with the presence of hemoglobin. Fig. 7 shows representative colonies from this experiment. mAb 71 showed a bell-shaped dose response curve in this assay similar to that seen with mAb 71 in the thymidine uptake assay (Fig. 2, Fig. 3). The amount of mAb 71 required for maximal stimulation of colony formation and stimulation of thymidine uptake in UT-7/EPO cells was also the same (1-5 μg/ml). However, the dose range that would stimulate colony formation was narrower. These results suggest that dimerization of the receptor by an anti-EPOR antibody is sufficient to send both proliferative and differentiation signals.Fig. 7Photographs of human BFUe colonies stimulated by rHuEPO or mAb 71. Purified CD34+ cells from human peripheral blood were incubated in methylcellulose with stem cell factor, transferrin, human insulin, and BSA under serum free growth conditions and the indicated amounts of rHuEPO or mAb 71. After 21 days the BFUe colonies, orange to red in color, were identified by microscopic examination and photographed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We report here the identification of monoclonal antibodies raised to the extracellular domain of the human EPO receptor. A subset of these, about 4%, stimulated thymidine uptake in EPO factor-dependent cell lines. The stimulation could be blocked by the addition of soluble EPO receptor to the assay mix. This indicates that the activation requires binding to surface expressed EPOR. Homodimerization of EPOR has been hypothesized as the mechanism of its activation. Our studies support this proposal. Only bivalent anti-EPO receptor antibodies could activate cells. Monovalent antibodies (Fab) could bind EPOR but could not activate. In addition, the dose response curves showed reduced activation at both low and high doses. This is most easily explained by reduced dimerization at high antibody concentrations. At high antibody concentration, complexes would consist primarily of 1 antibody bound to each receptor. This complex would be inactive. At lower concentrations, complexes would exist in one antibody per two receptors resulting in activation. Oligomerization of cytokine receptors is emerging as a common mechanism for activation. The model system is growth hormone for which considerable information is available. X-ray crystallography studies of 2:1 complexes of growth hormone receptor-growth hormone suggest that growth hormone acts as a cross-linker bringing two growth hormone receptors into close proximity (21Cunningham B.C. Ultsch M. DeVos A.M. Mulkerrin M.G. Clauser K.R. Wells J.A. Science. 1991; 254: 821-825Google Scholar, 22DeVos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Google Scholar). The results here suggest that EPO also should have two binding sites because EPO is thought to exist as a monomer in solution. In this case it may act in a manner similar to growth hormone. It has been recently reported that 2:1 EPOR·EPO complexes can form in solution, but the complex is relatively unstable (37Philo J.S. Aoki K.H. Arakawa T. Narhi L.O. Wen J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1681-1691Google Scholar). This is because one of the two binding sites on EPO has low affinity for EPOR. The fact that bivalent antibodies have two equivalent binding sites with the same binding affinity and such antibodies can bind and activate EPOR suggests that activation of EPOR does not require a cross-linker with unequal binding sites. Four different monoclonal antibodies were identified that could activate the EPO receptor. Three of these appeared to bind at or near to the EPO receptor binding site as evidenced by the ability of the antibodies to inhibit rHuEPO binding. However, one antibody, 73, appeared to inhibit rHuEPO binding weakly at best, but it retained the ability to stimulate proliferation. This suggests that antibody cross-linking through the EPO binding site on EPOR is not crucial to activation and that activation can be effected by binding to other regions on EPOR. The antibodies were also tested for their ability to recognize denatured EPOR. One of these, mAb 71, had this property. Antibodies that recognize denatured proteins are thought to bind to short linear stretches of amino acids, generally about six amino acid residues. The fact that mAb 71 was the most potent activator suggests that activation of EPOR by antibodies can be effected by binding to limited regions on EPOR. These results suggest further that the constraints on bringing the receptors into an alignment sufficient for activation are rather relaxed. EPO has been reported to have at least three activities; it stimulates proliferation of erythroid progenitor cells, blocks apoptosis, and stimulates differentiation to erythroid cells (38Koury M.J. Bondurant M.C. J. Cell Physiol. 1988; 137: 65-74Google Scholar, 39Koury M.J. Bondurant M.C. Science. 1990; 248: 378-381Google Scholar, 40Spivak J.L. Pham T. Isaacs M. Hankins W.D.

One of the anti-EPOR antibodies, mAb 71, was shown to stimulate formation of hemoglobinized BFUe colonies from purified CD34+ cells. These results were seen in serum free medium where the only proteins present were insulin, stem cell factor, and BSA. This suggests that other added extraneous proteins in the medium are not responsible for nor contribute to the activity. Thus mAb 71 can stimulate differentiation as well as proliferation. Cells in the process of differentiation from BFUe to CFUe to erythrocytes are reported to undergo apoptosis in the absence of EPO (38Koury M.J. Bondurant M.C. J. Cell Physiol. 1988; 137: 65-74Google Scholar, 39Koury M.J. Bondurant M.C. Science. 1990; 248: 378-381Google Scholar, 40Spivak J.L. Pham T. Isaacs M. Hankins W.D. Blood. 1991; 77: 1228-1233Google Scholar). The fact that viable cells were seen in BFUe colonies stimulated by mAb 71 suggests that the antibodies also blocked apoptosis. Thus homodimerization of the EPO receptor with antibodies appears to induce all the necessary signal transduction pathways for growth and differentiation to erythroid cells. This ability of an antibody to support growth of BFUe cells is intriguing in light of reports of additional subunits associated with EPOR. Hydrodynamic studies suggest that EPOR is multicomponent (42Mayeux P. Casadevall N. Lacombe C. Muller O. Tambourin P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 271-278Google Scholar). One possible component is a non-EPOR 100-kDa protein that can be cross-linked to EPO (43Mayeux P. Lacombe C. Casadevall N. Chretien S. Dusanter I. Gisselbrecht S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23380-23385Google Scholar, 44Sawyer S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13343-13347Google Scholar, 45Sawyer S.T. Krantz S.B. Luna J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3690-3694Google Scholar). There is also a report suggesting that an additional factor present in some cell lines can increase the affinity of the EPO receptor (46Dong Y.J. Goldwasser E. Exp. Hematol. 1993; 21: 483-486Google Scholar). If these factors are important for signaling, they must be present in complexes with the EPOR when activated by mAb 71. The fact that mAb 71 can support the differentiation of BFUe colonies also suggests that these factors need not contact EPO or anti-EPOR mAbs to be activated because mAb 71 was raised to purified extracellular domain and is thus unlikely to have the ability to bind to the other accessory EPOR proteins.

There is great interest in delineating the mechanisms whereby Hsp70 levels are regulated. We observed that N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal (ALLN), a synthetic aldehydic tripeptide that inhibits proteasomes, markedly induced Hsp70 levels (up to 30-fold above base line in HepG2 cells and human endothelial cells). Induction of Hsp70 by ALLN was dose-dependent and not related to cell toxicity. ALLN selectively increased Hsp70 levels without affecting Hsp25, Hsp27, Hsp60, Hsp86, Hsp90, Hsp104, or Bip (immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein) in HepG2 cells. ALLN induced Hsp70 not only by stabilizing the protein but also by dramatically increasing its synthesis. The modulation of Hsp70 synthesis by ALLN resulted from a rapid and marked increase in transcription of the hsp72 gene, since the induction of hsp72 mRNA was blocked in cells co-treated with actinomycin D. hsp72 mRNA levels were affected in a time-dependent manner by exposure to ALLN; significant elevations occurred within 60 min of treatment, and a decline to background levels was observed by 7 h of recovery. The ALLN-induced increase in hsp72 gene expression was associated with trimerization of the heat shock transcriptional factor (HSF1). ALLN did not affect the steady-state level of HSF1 protein. The effects of ALLN appeared to require de novo protein synthesis, since the induction of both HSF1 trimerization and hsp72 transcription was blocked by co-treatment with cycloheximide. When we tested a series of protease inhibitors, only the related aldehydic tripeptides, N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-methioninal and the proteasome inhibitor, Cbz-leucyl-leucyl-leucinal, induced Hsp70 levels. The specific proteasome inhibitor, lactacystin, which has a different structure, also induced Hsp70 levels. Overall, our results suggest that a rapidly turning over protein that is normally degraded by proteasomes may be involved in the regulation of Hsp70 synthesis via effects on the hsp70 transcriptional factor, HSF1.

The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 417Google Scholar), including heavy metals, amino acid analogs, toxins, and oxidative stress. This response is found in all prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells and is characterized by repression of normal protein synthesis together with the rapid initiation of transcription of several Hsp-encoding genes (2Lindquist S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 1151-1191Google Scholar). Among these highly conserved Hsp family members are two nearly identical, cytosolic heat shock proteins, Hsp72 (the inducible form) and Hsp73 (the constitutively synthesized form). These two proteins, commonly referred to as cytosolic Hsp70, function as molecular chaperones and play fundamental roles in a number of important biological processes. Under nonstressed conditions, Hsp70 interacts transiently with nascent polypeptides to facilitate proper folding and maturation and promote protein translocation across mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes (5Deshaies R.J. Koch B.D. Werner M. Craig E.A. Schekman R. Nature. 1988; 332: 800-805Google Scholar, 6Hartl F.U. Martin J. Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1992; 21: 293-322Google Scholar, 7Dierks T.

During stress conditions, Hsp70 is suspected to form a complex with proteins that misfold or unfold, either “rescuing” these proteins from irreversible damage or degradation (9Hightower L.E.

Recently, elevated expression of Hsp70 and other Hsps has been observed in cells and tissues under conditions potentially relevant to human diseases, including ischemia, oxidant injury, atherosclerosis, and aging (14Marber M.S. Latchman D.S. Walker J.M. Yellon D.M. Circulation. 1988; 88: 1264-1274Google Scholar, 15Minowada G. Welch W.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 3-12Google Scholar, 16Johnson A.D. Berberian P.A. Tytell M. Bond M.G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 27-36Google Scholar). The increased expression of these stress proteins could represent an acute response to altered physiological states as well as chronic adaptation to particular diseases. The primary function of these stress responses is thought to be cytoprotective. For example, overexpression of Hsp70 alone was demonstrated to protect cells from thermal injury and increase cell survival (17Angelidis S. Lazaridis I. Pagoulators G.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 35-39Google Scholar, 18Li G.C. Li L.G. Liu Y.K. Mak J.Y. Chen L.L. Lee W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1681-1685Google Scholar). Elevated levels of inducible Hsp70 have been associated with both improved post-ischemic recovery (19Currie R.W. Karmazyn M. Kloc M. Mailer K. Circ. Res. 1988; 63: 543-549Google Scholar) and tolerance to ischemia in gerbil hippocampal neurons (20Ohtsuki T. Matsumoto M. Kuwabara K. Kitagana K. Suzuk K. Taniguchi N. Kamada T. Brain. Res. 1992; 599: 246-254Google Scholar). It has also been reported that both heat shock-induced and exogenous Hsp70 can protect smooth muscle cells from serum deprivation-induced cell death (16Johnson A.D. Berberian P.A. Tytell M. Bond M.G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 27-36Google Scholar). Overexpression of Hsp70 also protects murine fibroblasts from both UV light injury and proinflammatory cytokines released during UV exposure (21Simon M.M. Reikerstorfer A. Schwarz A. Krone C. Luger T.A. Jaattela M. Schwarz T. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 925-933Google Scholar). A protective role of Hsp70 was demonstrated clearly by several recent studies with transgenic mice in which overexpression of human inducible Hsp70 protected myocardium from ischemic reperfusion injury (22Marber M.S. Mestril R. Chi S.H. Sayen M.R. Yellon D.M. Dillmann W.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1446-1456Google Scholar, 23Plumier J.C. Ross B.M. Currie R.W. Angelidis C.E. Kazlaris H. Kollias G. Pagoulators G.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 94: 1854-1860Google Scholar) and enhanced post-ischemic recovery of the intact heart (24Rodford N.B. Fina M. Benjamin I.J. Moreadith R.W. Graves K.H. Zhao P. Gavva S. Wiethoff A. Sherry A.D. Malloy C.R. Williams R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2339-2342Google Scholar). These potential clinical applications of Hsp70 have stimulated investigators to search for efficient pharmacological means of rapidly and selectively inducing Hsp70. We have been studying the involvement of molecular chaperones in the assembly and secretion of apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB)-containing lipoprotein from cultured liver (HepG2) cells. ApoB is a very large, extremely hydrophobic secretory protein that appears to be constitutively translated but inefficiently translocated across the ER membranes (25Ginsberg H.N. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1995; 6: 275-280Google Scholar). As a result, nascent apoB assumes a transmembrane topology with some portion of the nascent protein exposed to the cytosol. Since the extreme hydrophobicity of apoB makes it unlikely that it would maintain a translocation-competent conformation in the cytosol without the “assistance” of a chaperone, we looked for an association of apoB with Hsp70 (26Zhou M. Wu X. Huang L.-S. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25220-25224Google Scholar). We found that Hsp70 associated transiently with nascent apoB and that this interaction appeared to be regulated by the translocation status of apoB. We observed that less apoB was bound to Hsp70 in the presence of oleic acid, which facilitates apoB translocation across the ER membranes by stimulating new triglyceride synthesis. In contrast, more apoB was bound to Hsp70 in the presence of a proteasome inhibitor, N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal (ALLN) (27Rock L.K. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Google Scholar, 28Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Google Scholar), which protects apoB from degradation without enhancing translocation. During these studies, we observed a marked, unexpected increase in Hsp70 levels in cells treated with ALLN. The studies presented in this report were designed to determine the mechanisms underlying the induction of Hsp70 by ALLN. ALLN, leupeptin, mouse anti-human Hsp72/73 monoclonal antibody, a secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG)), and rabbit anti-rat IgG antibody were from Boehringer Mannheim. Anti-human Hsp25 and anti-human Hsp60 monoclonal antibodies, N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-methioninal (ALLM), calpain inhibitor peptide, dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), and dithiothreitol were from Sigma. Human Hsp70 oligonucleotide probe was from Oncogene Science. This oligonucleotide was 32P-labeled at the 5′-end by T4 kinase, which was from Biolabs. 32P was from ICN Pharmaceutical Inc. L-[4,5-3H]leucine was from Amersham Corp. Anti-Bip (immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein, also called Grp78), anti-human Hsp27, Hsp60, and Hsp90 monoclonal antibodies were from Stress Genes. Anti-human Hsp86 and Hsp104 antibodies were from Affinity Bioreagent Inc. Nitrocellulose transfer and immobilization membranes were from Schleicher & Schuell. RNA extraction kits were from Biotecx. The polyclonal antibody against the human HSF1 protein was a generous gift from Dr. Carl Wu of the National Institute of Health (29Rabindran S.K. Haroun R.I. Clos J. Wisniewski J. Wu C. Science. 1993; 259: 230-234Google Scholar). Ethylene glycol bis(succinimidylsuccinate) (EGS) was from Pierce. Cbz-leucyl-leucyl-leucinal (MG132) was a gift of Dr. H. Ploegh at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. All the other tissue culture supplies and chemicals were obtained from supplies as described previously (30Dixon J.L. Furukawa S. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 166: 5080-5086Google Scholar). The HepG2 cell culture conditions were as described previously (30Dixon J.L. Furukawa S. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 166: 5080-5086Google Scholar). The cells were seeded into collagen-precoated dishes or six-well tissue culture plates and grown in complete medium containing minimal essential medium (MEM) with 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids, 1.0 mM sodium pyruvate, penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were fed fresh complete medium every 3 days and maintained in a 5% CO2 incubator. All experiments were performed by using exponentially growing cells at 90-95% confluency. For heat shock treatment, the dishes were sealed with Parafilm and immersed in a water bath at 42°C for the indicated duration of time. Cells were incubated with different protease inhibitors alone at indicated concentrations or combined with other chemicals, at 37°C. HepG2 cells were preincubated for 4 h in serum-free MEM and then radiolabeled with [3H]leucine (150 μCi/ml) in a serum-free, leucine-free medium. Preincubation and labeling media each contained either 1.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) alone, BSA plus ALLN (40 μg/ml except as otherwise indicated), or BSA plus other protease inhibitors at concentrations indicated in the figure legends. At the indicated times, cells were removed from the 37°C incubator and placed on ice, washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline twice and lysed with buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholic acid, and 0.1% SDS in phosphate-buffered saline containing proteinase inhibitors (2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 2 μg/ml ALLN, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 100 kallikrein-inactivating units of aprotinin). After a 30-min incubation with lysis buffer at 4°C, the lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 g in a microcentrifuge for 5 min, and the supernatants were adjusted to 1% SDS concentration and boiled for 5 min to denature the proteins. 1% Triton X-100 was then added to dilute the lysate to a final concentration of 0.1% SDS. Cell lysates containing equal amounts of trichloroacetic acid-insoluble radioactivity were used for immunoprecipitations by incubating with individual monoclonal antibody (1 μg/ml) for 2.5 h at 4°C. Protein A-Sepharose 4B was added afterwards and incubated for another 1.5 h at 4°C to collect the immunocomplexes. After washing four times with 1 × NET buffer (containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS), the immunocomplexes were mixed with sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Following centrifugation, the supernatants were aliquoted for the scintillation counting and for 3-15% gradient polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The gels were later subjected to fluorography. All values were presented as the mean ± S.D. from three individual experiments except as otherwise indicated. Total RNA was prepared using the procedure of Chomczynski and Sacchi (31Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar) and a commercially prepared reagent, TRISOLV™ (Biotecx Laboratories Inc.). Equal amounts of tRNA samples (10 μg) were size-fractionated on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel according to the methods described (32Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar) and transferred to a piece of QIAGEN Plus nylon membrane. To determine loading and transfer efficiency, RNA was stained with ethidium bromide before and after transfer. The membrane was baked for 30 min at 80°C in a vacuum followed by UV cross-linking. It was then incubated for 4 h at 65°C in a prehybridization mixture containing 10% dextran sulfate, 1% SDS, 1 M sodium chloride, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. Hybridization was carried out for 18 h at 65°C in the same buffer with a 32P-labeled (1 × 106 cpm/ml) 40-mer oligonucleotide probe to the untranslated 5′ region of a human hsp70 gene (Oncogene Science). This probe is specific for the inducible form of hsp72 and does not cross-hybridize to the constitutive form of hsp73, hsp70B or hsp70B′ (33Freeman M.L. Sierra-Rivere E. Voorhee G. Eisert D.R. Meredith M.J. Radiat. Res. 1993; 135: 387-393Google Scholar). The membrane was then washed four times with 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature, one time at 65°C for 30 min, and one time at room temperature again for 5 min. After it was rinsed with 2 × SSC at room temperature, the membrane was air-dried and exposed to x-ray film at −80°C for 48 h. For measurement of the steady-state HSF1 protein levels, whole cell extracts were prepared by lysing the cells directly with 2 × SDS-sample buffer (32Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). For chemical cross-linking experiments, whole-cell extracts were prepared as described (34Mosser D.D. Theodorakis N.G. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4736-4744Google Scholar). Briefly, the cold phosphate-buffered saline-washed cell pellets were quickly and repeatedly frozen in liquid nitrogen. The pulverized pellet was thawed and resuspended in about 2 packed cell volumes of buffer C (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.42 M NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.01 units/ml aprotinin, 25% glycerol (v/v)). The concentration of NaCl was then adjusted to 0.38 M. After 10 min of incubation on ice, the extract was clarified by centrifugation at 4°C for 15 min at 10,000 × g. Cross-linking of HSF was immediately performed (35Abdella P.M. Smith P.K. Garfield P.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 87: 734-742Google Scholar) by adding (null)/1;10 volume of freshly prepared Me2SO containing an appropriate concentration of EGS to the whole cell extracts at a final concentration of 1 mM and then incubating the mixture at 22°C for 30 min. Reactions were quenched by the addition of glycine to 75 mM and incubation for 15 min at room temperature. After SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, nonspecific protein binding sites were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk, and the membrane was probed with a 1:1000 dilution of anti-HSF1 antibody followed by repeated washing and subsequent incubation with the secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG). The effect of ALLN on the levels of Hsp70 was analyzed by denaturing immunoprecipitation of extracts of [3H]leucine-radiolabeled HepG2 cells that had been pretreated with ALLN for 4 h at different doses. Denaturing immunoprecipitation was chosen because Hsp70 is a major cytosolic chaperone protein, and it is co-immunoprecipitated with a number of other proteins under nondenaturing conditions (26Zhou M. Wu X. Huang L.-S. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25220-25224Google Scholar, 36Beckmann R.P. Mizzen L.A. Welch W.J. Science. 1990; 248: 850-854Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation with anti-human Hsp70 antibody showed that untreated cells had low levels of radiolabeled Hsp70 (Fig. 1). This may be due to a low, constitutive level of expression of Hsp73 (Hsc70) in HepG2 cells, similar to that reported for other cell types in the absence of stress (37Welch W.J. Feramisco J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4501-4513Google Scholar). Treatment with ALLN was associated with a marked increase in Hsp70 level, which was further confirmed as Hsp72 (the inducible form) by Western blot (data not shown). Hsp70 levels showed a dose-dependent response to ALLN treatment. This induction was not related to ALLN-induced cell toxicity, since at a low concentration of ALLN (10 μg/ml), Hsp70 levels were induced more than 9-fold, while cell total incorporation of radiolabel (trichloroacetic acid-insoluble cpm, an indicator of cell toxicity) did not change significantly (Fig. 1B, inset). When we removed the ALLN-containing medium after a 4-h preincubation and then washed the cells with fresh medium for different periods of time, followed by radiolabeling and immunoprecipitation of cell lysates, we found that Hsp70 levels remained as high as 25-fold at the end of a 2-h wash, 8-fold at the end of a 6-h wash, and 4-fold at the end of an 8-h wash (data not shown). Similar results were obtained from a human microvascular endothelial cell line, which showed a 35-fold increment of Hsp70, with no change in trichloroacetic acid-insoluble cpm, after 4 h of ALLN treatment (40 μg/ml) and 30 min of labeling with [3H]leucine in the presence of ALLN (data not shown). In addition, we found that Chinese hamster ovary cells also respond to ALLN by increasing cellular Hsp70 levels (data not shown). It was reported (38Liu A.Y.-C. Lin Z. Choi H.-S. Sorhage F. Li B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12037-12045Google Scholar) that in human diploid fibroblasts, heat shock treatment could induce the synthesis of several members of the Hsp family, including Hsp25, Hsp50, Hsp64, Hsp72, Hsp78, Hsp89, and Hsp98. Short, sublethal episodes of cardiac ischemia increase both Hsp70 and Hsp60 (14Marber M.S. Latchman D.S. Walker J.M. Yellon D.M. Circulation. 1988; 88: 1264-1274Google Scholar). Such complex induction patterns may reflect the need for several of these Hsps to increase in order to protect preexisting proteins from denaturation. It is suggested that molecular chaperones like Hsp70 and Hsp60 may work in tandem to facilitate the folding process (6Hartl F.U. Martin J. Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1992; 21: 293-322Google Scholar). To ascertain whether other members of the Hsp family are also induced by ALLN treatment, we compared the whole cell protein pattern of untreated and ALLN-treated HepG2 cells by directly loading [3H]leucine-labeled cell lysates onto SDS-PAGE gel. As can been seen in Fig. 2A, all the proteins were synthesized at similar levels in both ALLN-treated and control cells except Hsp70, which was markedly increased in ALLN-treated cells. To further confirm this result, we selectively determined the protein levels of Hsp25, Hsp27, Hsp60, Hsp86, Hsp90, Hsp104, Bip, and albumin by specific immunoprecipitation of each protein from radiolabeled extracts of cells preincubated with or without ALLN. As can be seen from Fig. 2B, only Hsp70 was induced by ALLN treatment in HepG2 cells. To test whether ALLN induces Hsp70 by increasing protein synthesis, we preincubated HepG2 cells with or without ALLN for 4 h at 37°C and subsequently radiolabeled them with [3H]leucine for periods between 10 and 60 min. Anti-Hsp70 immunoprecipitates were collected from cell lysates, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3A), and radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting (Fig. 3B). As indicated, the rate of incorporation of [3H]leucine into Hsp70 was increased about 25-fold at every time point in this experiment. Since ALLN is a protease inhibitor (27Rock L.K. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Google Scholar, 28Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Google Scholar, 39Hiwasa T. Sanada T. Sakiyama S. Carcinogenesis. 1990; 11: 75-80Google Scholar, 40Inoue S. Bar-Nun S. Roitelman J. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13311-13317Google Scholar, 41Sakata N. Wu X. Dixon J.L. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22967-22970Google Scholar), we considered the possibility that protection of Hsp70 from proteolytic degradation might also account for the sharp increase in Hsp70 levels induced by ALLN. To determine whether ALLN stabilizes Hsp70, we measured the turnover rate of radiolabeled Hsp70 in the presence or absence of ALLN (40 μg/ml) in a pulse-chase experiment. The result in Fig. 3C shows that without ALLN, newly synthesized Hsp70 disappeared rapidly, with a half-life of about 2 h. This value is comparable with that reported by Landry and co-workers (42Landry J. Chretien P. Laszlo A. Lambert H. J. Cell Physiol. 1991; 147: 93-101Google Scholar) who showed that Hsp70 in Chinese hamster ovary cells displayed a half-life of about 3-4 h. In the presence of ALLN, Hsp70 disappeared very slowly, with a half-life of about 6 h. Thus, stabilization of Hsp70 by ALLN might contribute to the increased cellular level of this protein. However, since treatment with ALLN resulted in an approximate increase of 30-fold of newly synthesized Hsp70 levels after 30-min labeling (data from several experiments) compared with untreated cells, it seemed clear that a 3-fold increase in the half-life of Hsp70 by ALLN could not account significantly for the dramatic induction of Hsp70 we had observed. Thus, increased protein synthesis is the major reason that ALLN dramatically induces Hsp70 levels. Total RNA was isolated from HepG2 cells that had been incubated for 4 h at 37°C (Fig. 4A) with MEM containing BSA alone (Control, lane 1), BSA plus 40 μg/ml ALLN (ALLN, lane 2), BSA plus ALLN and 10 μg/ml actinomycin D (A + AD, lane 3), or BSA plus ALLN and 50 μg/ml cycloheximide (A + CXM, lane 4). A radioprobe containing a unique sequence specific for the 5′-untranslated region of hsp72 (inducible form) (33Freeman M.L. Sierra-Rivere E. Voorhee G. Eisert D.R. Meredith M.J. Radiat. Res. 1993; 135: 387-393Google Scholar) was used for Northern blot analysis. This probe does not recognize hsp73 (constitutive form). Northern blotting analysis indicated that the amount of hsp72 mRNA was increased dramatically in the ALLN-treated cells. Co-treatment of ALLN with actinomycin D, which blocks RNA synthesis, abolished the effects of ALLN, indicating that ALLN induced hsp72 mRNA by increasing its synthesis rather than protecting it from degradation. It has been reported previously that induction of Hsp70 at the transcriptional level by heat shock, inorganic metals, or metalloporphyrins occurs independently of new protein synthesis (34Mosser D.D. Theodorakis N.G. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4736-4744Google Scholar, 43Schlesinger M.J. Ashburner M. Tissieres A. Heat Shock: From Bacterial to Man.

Sassa S. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 819-825Google Scholar), whereas induction by amino acid analogs requires ongoing protein synthesis (34Mosser D.D. Theodorakis N.G. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4736-4744Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the effects of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide at a level (50 μg/ml) that was sufficient to block new synthesis (46Baler R. Welch W.J. Voellmy R. J. Cell. Biol. 1992; 117: 1151-1159Google Scholar). As can be seen, the marked increase in hsp72 mRNA associated with ALLN treatment was abolished by co-treatment with cycloheximide. As can be seen in Fig. 4B, induction of hsp72 mRNA by ALLN was time-dependent. Although 60 min of ALLN treatment was already associated with a significant increase of hsp72 mRNA levels, treatment with ALLN for 2 or 3 h further increased hsp72 mRNA in proportion to the duration of treatment (Fig. 4B, lanes 1-4). After treatment for 3 h, ALLN-containing medium was removed, and the cells were washed and fed fresh medium containing only BSA. As can be seen from lanes 5-8, hsp72 mRNA levels decreased progressively during recovery. After 7 h of recovery, hsp72 mRNA had declined to background levels (lane 8). This result suggested that transcriptional induction of hsp72 mRNA by ALLN"

To approach this complex issue, we have applied site-directed mutagenesis to the identification of residues of Trx f that affect its binding to and selectivity for target enzymes. Based upon amino acid sequence alignments and the three-dimensional structure of Escherichia coli thioredoxin, putative key residues of Trx f were replaced with residues found at corresponding positions of Trx m to generate the mutants K58E, Q75D, N74D, and deletion mutants ΔAsn-74 and ΔAsn-77. Kinetics of activation of oxidized recombinant sorghum leaf NADP-dependent malate dehydrogenase and oxidized spinach chloroplastic fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase by wild-type Trx f, wild-type Trx m, and Trx f mutants were compared. All of the mutants are less efficient than wild-type Trx f in the activation of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase and are altered in both S0.5 and Vmax. In contrast to literature reports, the activation of NADP-dependent malate dehydrogenase does not display rate saturation kinetics with respect to the concentration of Trx f, thereby signifying very weak interactions between the two proteins. The mutants of Trx f likewise interact only weakly with NADP-dependent malate dehydrogenase, but the apparent second-order rate constants for activation are increased compared to that with wild-type Trx f. Thus, Lys-58, Asn-74, Gln-75, and Asn-77 of Trx f contribute to its interaction with target enzymes and influence target protein selectivity.

INTRODUCTIONThioredoxins are ubiquitous, redox-active proteins that mediate thiol-disulfide exchanges with target enzymes (for reviews see 1Holmgren A. Brändén C.-I. Jörvall H. Sjöberg B.-M.

Intercept Ltd., Andover, UK1992: 171Google Scholar). Two chloroplastic thioredoxins have been identified, designated f and m, which can be reduced by ferredoxin as catalyzed by ferredoxin-thioredoxin reductase (for review, see 5Buchanan B.B. Schürmann P. Decottignies P. Lozano R.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 314: 257-260Google Scholar). Both of these thioredoxins are crucial to the light regulation of CO2 assimilation through the modulation of the redox status of various enzymes. Thioredoxins activate (or inactivate) target enzymes by a step-wise, thiol-disulfide exchange in which the enzyme disulfide undergoes nucleophilic attack by an active-site sulfhydryl of the Trx 1The abbreviations used are: TrxthioredoxinFBPfructose 1,6-bisphosphateFBPasefructose-1,6-bisphosphataseMDHNADP-dependent malate dehydrogenase. (Cys-46 in spinach Trx f) (6Brandes H.K. Larimer F.W. Geck M.K. Stringer C.D. Schürmann P. Hartman F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18411-18414Google Scholar) to form a protein-protein mixed disulfide. The proximal active-site sulfhydryl (Cys-49 in Trx f) then intramolecularly attacks the mixed disulfide, generating reduced enzyme and oxidized Trx. Trx f has been reported to selectively activate fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase), sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase, phosphoribulokinase, and NADP-linked glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (1Holmgren A. Brändén C.-I. Jörvall H. Sjöberg B.-M. Thioredoxin and Glutaredoxin Systems: Structure and Function. Raven Press, NY1986Google Scholar, 2Buchanan B.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 288: 1-9Google Scholar). On the contrary, Trx m appears selective for NADP-dependent malate dehydrogenase (MDH) and chloroplastic glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (7Jacquot J-P. Vidal J. Gadal P. Schürmann P. FEBS Lett. 1978; 96: 243-246Google Scholar, 8Scheibe R. Anderson L.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 636: 58-64Google Scholar, 9Wolosiuk R.A. Crawford N.A. Yee B.C. Buchanan B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1627-1632Google Scholar). A comparison of the amino acid sequences between the two thioredoxins shows only 29% identity but complete conservation of the active-site sequence Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys (10Eklund H. Gleason F.K. Holmgren A. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 13-28Google Scholar).The basis for the existence of two types of thioredoxins within the chloroplasts of higher plants that preferentially mediate the same redox chemistry of different target enzymes is unknown. As one approach to this issue, we are exploring, by site-directed mutagenesis, the roles of residues that appear unique to Trx f relative to other thioredoxins. One such residue is Lys-58, which is replaced by glutamate in spinach Trx m, Escherichia coli Trx, and indeed the majority of thioredoxins in other organisms (Fig. 1) (10Eklund H. Gleason F.K. Holmgren A. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 13-28Google Scholar). Based on the structure of E. coli Trx (11Dyson H.J. Gippert G.P. Case D.A. Holmgren A. Wright P.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4129-4136Google Scholar, 12Katti S.K. LeMaster D.M. Eklund H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 167-184Google Scholar, 13Jeng M.-F. Campbell A.P. Begley T. Holmgren A. Case D.A. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. Structure. 1994; 2: 853-868Google Scholar), Lys-58 is positioned on the surface, is salt-bridged with residue 110 (Asp in Trx f; Lys in E. coli Trx and Trx m), and is located near the active site. Hence, we were prompted to construct and characterize the K58E mutant of Trx f as reported herein.Residues 74, 75, and 77 were also examined. These residues are located near a conserved, putative hydrophobic contact surface encompassing Gly-33, Pro-34, Ile-75, Pro-76, Val-91, Gly-92, and Ala-93 of E. coli Trx (10Eklund H. Gleason F.K. Holmgren A. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 13-28Google Scholar, 14Xia T.-H. Bushweller J.H. Sodano P. Billeter M. Björnberg O. Holmgren A. Wüthrich K. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 310-321Google Scholar, 15Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Google Scholar). Specifically, the region of 74-77 appears to be on the same general face of the molecule as both the hydrophobic contact site and the active site (based upon visual inspection of the E. coli Trx structures reported by Dyson et al. (11Dyson H.J. Gippert G.P. Case D.A. Holmgren A. Wright P.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4129-4136Google Scholar) and Katti et al. (12Katti S.K. LeMaster D.M. Eklund H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 167-184Google Scholar)). One sequence alignment (16de Lamotte-Guery F. Miginiac-Maslow M. Decottignies P. Stein M. Minard P. Jacquot J.-P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 287-294Google Scholar, 17Wedel N. Clausmeyer S. Herrmann R.G. Gardet-Salvi L. Schürmann P. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 18: 527-533Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A) suggests that the Asn-74 of Trx f aligns with an Asp in Trx m and Asp-61 of E. coli Trx, resulting in an insertion of an asparagine at position 77. Supportive of this alignment, a D61N E. coli Trx mutant generated by Jacquot and colleagues showed an increase in efficiency of spinach FBPase activation (16de Lamotte-Guery F. Miginiac-Maslow M. Decottignies P. Stein M. Minard P. Jacquot J.-P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 287-294Google Scholar). An alternative sequence alignment (10Eklund H. Gleason F.K. Holmgren A. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 13-28Google Scholar), however, indicates that Asn-74 represents an insertion, with Gln-75 aligning with aspartic acid in Trx m (Fig. 1B). Given this uncertainty, two deletion mutants (ΔN74 and ΔN77), as well as two single-substitution mutants (N74D and Q75D), were constructed. The kinetic parameters of these four mutants and the K58E mutant of Trx f in the activation of both FBPase and MDH were determined and compared to the corresponding parameters of wild-type Trx f and Trx m.RESULTSPublished values for kinetic parameters of activation of FBPase and MDH by Trx f or Trx m vary widely. Thus, direct determination of the quantitative impact of the designed structural alterations of Trx f required a re-examination of the properties of the wild-type thioredoxins. Consistent with prior reports (9Wolosiuk R.A. Crawford N.A. Yee B.C. Buchanan B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1627-1632Google Scholar, 23Häberlein I. Vogeler B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1253: 169-174Google Scholar), wild-type Trx f is far superior to wild-type Trx m in the activation of FBPase, displaying a 35-fold higher affinity and a 25-fold increased Vmax (Fig. 3A and Table I). All of the mutants analyzed are impaired relative to wild-type Trx f but are still superior to Trx m when analyzed with FBPase (Fig. 3B and Table I). The largest deviation from the S0.5 value of 0.9 μM determined with wild-type Trx f occurs with the Asn-77 deletion mutant, in which case the affinity is lowered about 15-fold. Among the mutants analyzed, replacement of Lys-58 by a glutamyl residue has the largest impact on Vmax with a decrease of 3-fold.Fig. 3Activation of FBPase by thioredoxins.

Indeed, the rates of activation of MDH by Trx m are so rapid that reliable monitoring could only be achieved at 4°C as opposed to room temperature. Even without correction for this differential in temperature, the Vmax for Trx m in the activation of MDH is 21 mU/min (Fig. 4) compared to 2 mU/min in the activation of FBPase (Fig. 3A and Table I); however, the S0.5 values for the interaction of Trx m with the two enzymes are both approximately 30 μM. Despite the efficiency of activation of MDH by Trx m, a comparison of the activation profiles for MDH by Trx f and Trx m argues against preferential regulation by the latter (Fig. 4). Even though rate saturation with respect to Trx f concentrations up to 50 μM cannot be demonstrated, signifying very weak association between Trx f and MDH, the rates of activation of MDH by Trx f are more rapid than those with Trx m throughout the concentration range examined.Fig. 4Activation of MDH by wild-type thioredoxins. Each data point indicates the initial rate of activation of the MDH by the specified concentration of Trx at 4°C.

Data for Trx f were fit to a straight line.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The activation kinetics of MDH by the mutants of Trx f are complex, exhibiting pronounced sigmoidicity as seen with wild-type Trx m (Fig. 5). However, analogous to wild-type Trx f, the mutants do not show rate saturation in activation of MDH. Thus, the relative effectiveness of Trx f mutants as activators of MDH are expressed as apparent second-order rate constants (Table II) calculated from the linear region of the activation curves (Fig. 5). Based on this criterion, all mutants are more effective than wild-type Trx f in the activation of MDH.Fig. 5Activation of MDH by mutant thioredoxins.

Open table in a new tab DISCUSSIONDespite both qualitative and quantitative variations among published data, several laboratories have confirmed differential selectivities of Trx f and Trx m for target enzymes as discovered in pioneering studies by Buchanan and colleagues (3Buchanan B.B. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1980; 31: 341-374Google Scholar, 9Wolosiuk R.A. Crawford N.A. Yee B.C. Buchanan B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1627-1632Google Scholar). As the redox potentials of these two thioredoxins are identical (−210 mV) (24Salamon Z. Tollin G. Hirasawa M. Gardet-Salvi L. Stritt-Etter A.-L. Knaff D.B. Schürmann P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1230: 114-118Google Scholar), their selectivities must reflect differential affinities for target enzymes and/or differential propensities for sulfhydryl-disulfide exchanges within the Trx-enzyme complexes. The present study was predicated on the supposition that recognition and selectivity determinants of Trx f and Trx m could be determined by site-directed mutagenesis as guided by clearly discernible structural differences between the two thioredoxins. Satisfyingly, the residue (Lys-58) and segment (positions 74-77) of Trx f chosen for change are shown to influence its efficiency (Vmax/S0.5) and selectivity in the activation of target enzymes.The impaired efficiency of K58E, relative to wild-type Trx f, in the activation of FBPase is due primarily to a lower Vmax, indicative of a slower rate of thiol-disulfide exchange within the productive complex. Slower exchange could reflect misalignment of the exchanging groups or altered pKa values of the active-site sulfhydryls of Trx f. Certainly, the functional group of residue 58 is too far removed, 15-20 Å as extrapolated from the three-dimensional structures of E. coli Trx (11Dyson H.J. Gippert G.P. Case D.A. Holmgren A. Wright P.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4129-4136Google Scholar, 12Katti S.K. LeMaster D.M. Eklund H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 167-184Google Scholar), human Trx (25Qin J. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Structure. 1994; 2: 503-522Google Scholar), and Anabaena Trx-2 (26Saarinen M. Gleason F.K. Eklund H. Structure. 1995; 3: 1097-1108Google Scholar), from the active-site sulfhydryls to directly influence their reactivities. However, either suggested outcome could result from conformational perturbations brought about by the lysyl to glutamyl substitution. Any such perturbations must be slight as judged by the mere 2-fold increase in S0.5 for activation of FBPase.The efficiency of activation of FBPase by Trx f is very sensitive to changes in residues at positions 74-77 with greater than 9-fold declines among three of the five mutants examined. In contrast to K58E, these mutants are less efficient than wild-type Trx f due primarily to weakened interactions with FBPase as gauged by S0.5 values. Therefore, we conclude that residues 74-77 serve as an important recognition site for target enzymes. The earlier finding that replacement of Asp-61 of E. coli Trx with Asn, as located at the corresponding position 74 in Trx f improves the activation parameters with FBPase (16de Lamotte-Guery F. Miginiac-Maslow M. Decottignies P. Stein M. Minard P. Jacquot J.-P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 287-294Google Scholar), is consistent with this conclusion. Our conclusion is further supported by structural information derived from both human and Anabaena Trx. With human Trx, long range nuclear Overhauser-effect contacts between Ala-29 (Thr-43 of spinach Trx f) and Asp-60 (Asn-74 or Gln-75 of Trx f) and also between Trp-31 (Trp-45 of Trx f) and Asp-60 are observed in the reduced but not the oxidized forms of the Trx (25Qin J. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Structure. 1994; 2: 503-522Google Scholar). This suggests that localized conformational changes in these regions occur upon binding and subsequent activation of target enzymes. Furthermore, the solution structure of human Trx complexed with a peptide from the transcription factor NFκB shows that the guanidinium group of Arg-57 of NFκB forms a salt bridge with the side chain carboxylates of Asp-58 and Asp-61 of the Trx (corresponding to Asp-72 and Gln-75/Glu-76 of Trx f) (27Qin J. Clore G.M. Kennedy W.M.P. Huth J.R. Gronenborn A.M. Structure. 1995; 3: 289-297Google Scholar). Functionally, Trx-2 from Anabaena resembles Trx f (28Gleason F.K. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2592-2598Google Scholar), and its overall three-dimensional structure is very similar to that of E. coli Trx (26Saarinen M. Gleason F.K. Eklund H. Structure. 1995; 3: 1097-1108Google Scholar). However, the regions that correspond to residues 74/75-87 of Trx f differ considerably and thus appear poised structurally for preferential contact with target enzymes. Specifically, Saarinen et al. (26Saarinen M. Gleason F.K. Eklund H. Structure. 1995; 3: 1097-1108Google Scholar) state that differences in secondary structures of these regions and that amino acid substitutions in the hydrophobic cores are the causes of relative altered positions of these residues.Whereas all of the engineered structural changes of Trx f were counterproductive with respect to activation of FBPase, they were beneficial with respect to activation of MDH, thereby validating the conversion of Trx f to a more “m-like” thioredoxin. Although Vmax and S0.5 values for the activation of MDH by the Trx mutants could not be determined due to the absence of rate saturation even at 1000-fold molar excess of the given thioredoxin, the observed activation rates were greater with the mutants than with wild-type Trx f at concentrations exceeding 30 μM. The Trx f mutants were also more akin to Trx m with respect to kinetics of MDH activations, displaying sigmoidicity as opposed to linearity with wild-type Trx f.In addition to identifying functional and selectivity elements of Trx f, the present study partially addresses some of the published conflicts about relative target enzyme selectivities of Trx f and Trx m. Although all accounts agree that Trx f is superior to Trx m in the activation of FBPase (9Wolosiuk R.A. Crawford N.A. Yee B.C. Buchanan B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1627-1632Google Scholar, 23Häberlein I. Vogeler B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1253: 169-174Google Scholar, 29Nishizawa A.N. Buchanan B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6119-6126Google Scholar), some allege that this enzyme is totally refractive to Trx m (30Schürmann P. Maeda K. Tsugita A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 116: 37-45Google Scholar, 31Tsugita A. Maeda K. Schürmann P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 115: 1-7Google Scholar). Given the inefficiency of Trx m in the activation of FBPase, 550-fold lower than that of Trx f, we surmise that negative reports merely reflect insufficient concentrations and reaction times.Beyond these readily reconcilable differences, reports concerning activation of MDH range from a striking preferential effectiveness of Trx m (9Wolosiuk R.A. Crawford N.A. Yee B.C. Buchanan B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1627-1632Google Scholar, 32Crawford N.A. Yee B.C. Hutcheson S.W. Wolosiuk R.A. Buchanan B.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 244: 1-15Google Scholar) to superiority of Trx f (30Schürmann P. Maeda K. Tsugita A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 116: 37-45Google Scholar, 33Hodges M. Miginiac-Maslow M. Decottignies P. Jacquot J.-P. Stein M. Lepiniec L. Cretin C. Gadal P. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 26: 225-234Google Scholar) as we observe. These disparities could be due to differences in conditions for activation or differences in approaches to determining kinetic parameters. Shortly after the discovery of Trx f and Trx m (9Wolosiuk R.A. Crawford N.A. Yee B.C. Buchanan B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1627-1632Google Scholar), preferential activation of MDH by the latter was reported to be dependent on the presence of high concentrations of chloride (32Crawford N.A. Yee B.C. Hutcheson S.W. Wolosiuk R.A. Buchanan B.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 244: 1-15Google Scholar). Although we observe stimulation of thioredoxin-dependent activation of MDH by 250 mM NaCl, the impact is similar for both Trx m and Trx f. We thus believe that methods, rather than conditions, are the more likely basis of variable results among different laboratories. In most prior publications, the level of activation at a given Trx concentration is based on a single, fixed time point assay; the rate of activation is then assumed to be linear throughout the time period selected. Thus, to some extent, equilibria are being determined rather than rates at which equilibria are attained. The kinetic patterns presently reported are based on true initial rates of activation, whereby an incubation mixture of Trx and target enzyme is sampled repeatedly in order to reveal the linear phase of time-dependent activation. Prior oversights to clearly distinguish rates and equilibria can readily account for the wide range of apparent affinities of spinach Trx f for spinach FBPase; e.g. S0.5 values of 1.6 nM (23Häberlein I. Vogeler B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1253: 169-174Google Scholar), 0.19 μM (34Aguilar F. Brunner B. Gardet-Salvi L. Stutz E. Schürmann P. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 20: 301-306Google Scholar), and 1 μM (6Brandes H.K. Larimer F.W. Geck M.K. Stringer C.D. Schürmann P. Hartman F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18411-18414Google Scholar, 16de Lamotte-Guery F. Miginiac-Maslow M. Decottignies P. Stein M. Minard P. Jacquot J.-P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 287-294Google Scholar) have been reported. Given this enormous variation of apparent affinities with one enzyme system, reports of inverse selectivities of Trx f and Trx m are understandable. Although two prior studies include true rates of activation of Trx-regulated enzymes, quantitative comparisons with our data are precluded. One report was restricted to an examination of the Trx m/MDH system and did not entail a complete profile of the rate dependence on Trx m concentration (35Scheibe R. Fickensher K. Ashton A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 870: 191-197Google Scholar). In the other report, the activation of FBPase by Trx f was examined at molar ratios that gave rise to first-order kinetics with respect to Trx f concentration (i.e. absence of rate saturation) (36Clancey C.J. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13545-13549Google Scholar).Based on our finding of clear-cut kinetic superiority of Trx f relative to Trx m in the in vitro activation of MDH, we suggest that the physiological role of Trx m should be reassessed. INTRODUCTIONThioredoxins are ubiquitous, redox-active proteins that mediate thiol-disulfide exchanges with target enzymes (for reviews see 1Holmgren A. Brändén C.-I. Jörvall H. Sjöberg B.-M.

Intercept Ltd., Andover, UK1992: 171Google Scholar). Two chloroplastic thioredoxins have been identified, designated f and m, which can be reduced by ferredoxin as catalyzed by ferredoxin-thioredoxin reductase (for review, see 5Buchanan B.B. Schürmann P. Decottignies P. Lozano R.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 314: 257-260Google Scholar). Both of these thioredoxins are crucial to the light regulation of CO2 assimilation through the modulation of the redox status of various enzymes. Thioredoxins activate (or inactivate) target enzymes by a step-wise, thiol-disulfide exchange in which the enzyme disulfide undergoes nucleophilic attack by an active-site sulfhydryl of the Trx 1The abbreviations used are: TrxthioredoxinFBPfructose 1,6-bisphosphateFBPasefructose-1,6-bisphosphataseMDHNADP-dependent malate dehydrogenase. (Cys-46 in spinach Trx f) (6Brandes H.K. Larimer F.W. Geck M.K. Stringer C.D. Schürmann P. Hartman F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18411-18414Google Scholar) to form a protein-protein mixed disulfide. The proximal active-site sulfhydryl (Cys-49 in Trx f) then intramolecularly attacks the mixed disulfide, generating reduced enzyme and oxidized Trx. Trx f has been reported to selectively activate fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase), sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase, phosphoribulokinase, and NADP-linked glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (1Holmgren A. Brändén C.-I. Jörvall H. Sjöberg B.-M. Thioredoxin and Glutaredoxin Systems: Structure and Function. Raven Press, NY1986Google Scholar, 2Buchanan B.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 288: 1-9Google Scholar). On the contrary, Trx m appears selective for NADP-dependent malate dehydrogenase (MDH) and chloroplastic glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (7Jacquot J-P. Vidal J. Gadal P. Schürmann P. FEBS Lett. 1978; 96: 243-246Google Scholar, 8Scheibe R. Anderson L.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 636: 58-64Google Scholar, 9Wolosiuk R.A. Crawford N.A. Yee B.C. Buchanan B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1627-1632Google Scholar). A comparison of the amino acid sequences between the two thioredoxins shows only 29% identity but complete conservation of the active-site sequence Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys (10Eklund H. Gleason F.K. Holmgren A. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 13-28Google Scholar).The basis for the existence of two types of thioredoxins within the chloroplasts of higher plants that preferentially mediate the same redox chemistry of different target enzymes is unknown. As one approach to this issue, we are exploring, by site-directed mutagenesis, the roles of residues that appear unique to Trx f relative to other thioredoxins. One such residue is Lys-58, which is replaced by glutamate in spinach Trx m, Escherichia coli Trx, and indeed the majority of thioredoxins in other organisms (Fig. 1) (10Eklund H. Gleason F.K. Holmgren A. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 13-28Google Scholar). Based on the structure of E. coli Trx (11Dyson H.J. Gippert G.P. Case D.A. Holmgren A. Wright P.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4129-4136Google Scholar, 12Katti S.K. LeMaster D.M. Eklund H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 167-184Google Scholar, 13Jeng M.-F. Campbell A.P. Begley T. Holmgren A. Case D.A. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. Structure. 1994; 2: 853-868Google Scholar), Lys-58 is positioned on the surface, is salt-bridged with residue 110 (Asp in Trx f; Lys in E. coli Trx and Trx m), and is located near the active site. Hence, we were prompted to construct and characterize the K58E mutant of Trx f as reported herein.Residues 74, 75, and 77 were also examined. These residues are located near a conserved, putative hydrophobic contact surface encompassing Gly-33, Pro-34, Ile-75, Pro-76, Val-91, Gly-92, and Ala-93 of E. coli Trx (10Eklund H. Gleason F.K. Holmgren A. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 13-28Google Scholar, 14Xia T.-H. Bushweller J.H. Sodano P. Billeter M. Björnberg O. Holmgren A. Wüthrich K. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 310-321Google Scholar, 15Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Google Scholar). Specifically, the region of 74-77 appears to be on the same general face of the molecule as both the hydrophobic contact site and the active site (based upon visual inspection of the E. coli Trx structures reported by Dyson et al. (11Dyson H.J. Gippert G.P. Case D.A. Holmgren A. Wright P.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4129-4136Google Scholar) and Katti et al. (12Katti S.K. LeMaster D.M. Eklund H. J. Mol.

Biol. 1992; 18: 527-533Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A) suggests that the Asn-74 of Trx f aligns with an Asp in Trx m and Asp-61 of E. coli Trx, resulting in an insertion of an asparagine at position 77. Supportive of this alignment, a D61N E. coli Trx mutant generated by Jacquot and colleagues showed an increase in efficiency of spinach FBPase activation (16de Lamotte-Guery F. Miginiac-Maslow M. Decottignies P. Stein M. Minard P. Jacquot J.-P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 287-294Google Scholar). An alternative sequence alignment (10Eklund H. Gleason F.K. Holmgren A. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 13-28Google Scholar), however, indicates that Asn-74 represents an insertion, with Gln-75 aligning with aspartic acid in Trx m (Fig. 1B). Given this uncertainty, two deletion mutants (ΔN74 and ΔN77), as well as two single-substitution mutants (N74D and Q75D), were constructed. The kinetic parameters of these four mutants and the K58E mutant of Trx f in the activation of both FBPase and MDH were determined and compared to the corresponding parameters of wild-type Trx f and Trx m."

INTRODUCTIONSignal transduction from the extracellular environment across the cell membrane governs cellular growth and differentiation.

Despite the large number of RTKs in the EPH family, all of the molecules were identified as orphan receptors without known ligands. This situation has hindered understanding the biochemical roles of this family of RTKs.The first ligand to be identified was B61 (12Bartley T.D. Hunt R.W. Welcher A.A. Boyle W.J. Parker V.P. Lindberg R.A. Lu H.S. Colombero A.M. Elliott R.L. Guthrie B.A. Holst P.L. Skrine J.D. Toso R.J. Zhang M. Fernandez E. Trail G. Varnum B. Yarden Y. Hunter T. Fox G.M.

B61, a tumor necrosis factor α-induced gene product from cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells was found to bind the EPH receptor family member ECK. We have also found that B61 is a ligand for HEK and elk and have named it LERK-1 (14Beckmann M.P. Cerretti D.P. Baum P. Vanden Bos T. James L. Farrah T. Kozlosky C. Hollingsworth T. Shilling H. Maraskovsky E. Fletcher F.A. Lhotak V. Pawson T. Lyman S.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3757-3762Google Scholar). Subsequently, six additional ligands for the EPH family of RTKs were identified which we have named LERK-2 through LERK-7 (14Beckmann M.P. Cerretti D.P. Baum P. Vanden Bos T. James L. Farrah T.

Neuron. 1995; 14: 973-981Google Scholar). These ligands have an amino acid sequence identity ranging between 27 and 59% and are membrane-bound. The LERKs can be subdivided into two groups based on their mechanism of membrane attachment. LERK-1, LERK-3, LERK-4, LERK-6, and LERK-7 are anchored by glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage while LERK-2 and LERK-5 are type 1 transmembrane proteins.Here we describe that within the group of LERK proteins, LERK-2 and LERK-5 bind to HEK2 expressed in 32D-myeloid progenitor cell line, whereas LERK-1, LERK-3, LERK-4, and LERK-7 do not. In addition, soluble forms of LERK-2 stimulate autophosphorylation of HEK2 so that membrane attachment does not seem to be required for activation of the HEK2 receptor kinase. Furthermore, we provide evidence for stable cell-cell contacts mediated by the interaction of LERK-2 and HEK2 expressing cells and subsequent juxtacrine stimulation of receptor autophosphorylation.DISCUSSIONThe EPH-related kinases constitute the largest known family of orphan receptor tyrosine kinases with several members being expressed in the developing and adult nervous system. The recent characterization of a family of ligands that we call LERKs is a first step in trying to understand what cellular processes might be regulated by the EPH-related receptor proteins. In this article we have demonstrated that within this family of ligands only the type 1 transmembrane members, LERK-2 and LERK-5, bind to HEK2. Moreover, LERK-2 was shown to stimulate the kinase activity of the HEK2 receptor. In previous indirect binding assays LERK-2 protein expressed on CV-1 transfectants was shown to display also high affinity binding with a Ka of 1.08 × 109M−1 to elk/Fc (14Beckmann M.P. Cerretti D.P. Baum P. Vanden Bos T. James L. Farrah T. Kozlosky C. Hollingsworth T. Shilling H. Maraskovsky E. Fletcher F.A. Lhotak V. Pawson T. Lyman S.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3757-3762Google Scholar). During the preparation of this manuscript, a study was published demonstrating that LERK-2 binds to CEK5 and CEK10, two EPH-related receptors from chicken tissues (23Brambilla R. Schnapp A. Casagranda F. Labrador J.P. Bergemann A.D. Flanagan J.G. Pasquale E.B. Klein R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3116-3126Google Scholar). The affinity constants for LERK-2 binding to these receptors are Ka = 3.7 × 109M−1 for CEK10 and Ka = 2.3 × 109M−1 for CEK5. Taken together, LERK-2 shows extensive cross-binding to EPH-related RTKs, as demonstrated for other members of the LERK-family (15Cerretti D.P. Vanden Bos T. Nelson N. Kozlosky C.J. Reddy P. Maraskovsky E. Park L.S. Lyman S.D. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Fletcher F.A. Mol. Immunol. 1995; 32: 1197-1205Google Scholar), indicating functional redundancy.Previous studies have proposed that membrane attachment of ligands is required to induce functional responses to EPH-related receptors and that “shed” ligands do not (23Brambilla R. Schnapp A. Casagranda F. Labrador J.P. Bergemann A.D. Flanagan J.G. Pasquale E.B. Klein R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3116-3126Google Scholar, 24Davis S. Gale N.W. Aldrich T.H. Maisonpierre P.C. Lhotak V.

However, our results demonstrate that transmembrane as well as soluble forms of LERK-2 (LERK-2/Fc and a “shed” form of LERK-2) are able to induce phosphorylation of HEK2. In addition, Bartley et al. (12Bartley T.D. Hunt R.W. Welcher A.A. Boyle W.J. Parker V.P. Lindberg R.A. Lu H.S. Colombero A.M. Elliott R.L. Guthrie B.A. Holst P.L. Skrine J.D. Toso R.J. Zhang M. Fernandez E. Trail G. Varnum B. Yarden Y. Hunter T. Fox G.M. Nature. 1994; 368: 558-560Google Scholar) was able to induce phosphorylation of the EPH family receptor, ECK, with a “shed” form of B61 (LERK-1) (12Bartley T.D. Hunt R.W. Welcher A.A. Boyle W.J. Parker V.P. Lindberg R.A. Lu H.S. Colombero A.M. Elliott R.L. Guthrie B.A. Holst P.L. Skrine J.D. Toso R.J. Zhang M. Fernandez E. Trail G. Varnum B. Yarden Y. Hunter T. Fox G.M. Nature. 1994; 368: 558-560Google Scholar). Clearly, additional experimentation is required to determine the biochemical nature of these ligands. Still, membrane attachment facilitates ligand clustering to promote activation of EPH-related receptors (26Bennett B.D. Zeigler F.C. Gu Q. Fendly B. Goddard A.D. Gillett N. Matthews W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1866-1870Google Scholar).HEK2/LERK-2 coexpressing cells and coincubated HEK2- and LERK-2 expressing cells were compared with respect to receptor phosphorylation. Interestingly, in the case of coexpressing cells, we observed reduced autophosphorylation of HEK2. This effect might be due to steric hindrance that results in an inappropriate interaction of the ligand to its receptor. Alternatively, the ligand could be modified in a way that reduces its ability to induce receptor phosphorylation. To elucidate this phenomenon, we performed in vitro kinase assays and found that kinase activity with immunoprecipitated HEK2 receptors from coexpressing cells is reduced compared with HEK2- and LERK-2 coincubated cells. Since conformational aspects are essential for receptor activation in vivo and have been shown to be of less importance in kinase assays, we speculate that steric hindrance is not the cause for reduced receptor activation. This was further supported by identical binding affinities in single and coexpressing cells. In addition, we demonstrated that the nature of the ligand from both cells types is very similar as judged by their migration in denaturing gels. Thus, we suggest that the intracellular portion of the LERK-2 inhibits receptor activation by reducing its kinase activity. A negative regulatory role of the intracellular portion of LERK-2 has been postulated in the case of coexpression with chimeras consisting of chicken EPH-related receptors and TrkB as well (23Brambilla R. Schnapp A. Casagranda F. Labrador J.P. Bergemann A.D. Flanagan J.G. Pasquale E.B. Klein R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3116-3126Google Scholar). A functional role for the cytoplasmic domain of LERK-2 is also suggested because of the high amino acid sequence identity between the cytoplasmic domains of LERK-2 and LERK-5 (19Cerretti D.P. Kozlosky C.J. Vanden Bos T. Nelson N. Gearing D.P. Beckmann M.P. Mol. Immunol. 1993; 30: 359-367Google Scholar).Cell-cell adhesion and juxtacrine activation that is a cell-cell stimulation that is mediated by interaction of a membrane-attached ligand with its receptor has been demonstrated for different cell-surface receptors (27Brachmann R. Lindquist P.B. Nagashima M. Kohr W. Lipari T. Napier M. Derynck R. Cell. 1989; 56: 691-700Google Scholar, 28Wong S.T. Winchell L.F. McCune B.K. Earp H.S. Teixido J. Massague J. Herman B. Lee D.C.

Nature. 1991; 352: 207-212Google Scholar). We asked the question whether the expression of the HEK2 receptor and LERK-2 in 32D cells induces the ability of 32D cells to adhere. Several lines of evidence support the conclusion that adhesion of these two transfectants is mediated by binding to membrane LERK-2 via HEK2 receptors. Cell adhesion mediated by membrane-attached ligands might support cell home to tissue locations that express a certain factor. Especially members of the EPH family containing cell adhesion domains in their extracellular portion are expressed in embryonic development of multicellular organisms at high levels. For example, the subcellular localization of Nuk receptor is concentrated at sites of cell-cell contact (31Henkemeyer M. Marengere L.E.M. McGlade J. Olivier J.P. Conlon R.A. Holmyard D.P. Letwin K. Pawson T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1001-1014Google Scholar). High levels of the Nuk protein are found within initial axon outgrowth and associated nerve fibers. Our observations on cell adhesion using the 32D test system and on signaling through an EPH-related receptor could help to study those developmental processes in more detail. INTRODUCTIONSignal transduction from the extracellular environment across the cell membrane governs cellular growth and differentiation. These signals are often transduced by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) 1The abbreviations used are: RTKreceptor tyrosine kinaseHEKhuman embryonal kinaseLERKligands of the eph-related kinasePipes1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidPBSphosphate-buffered saline. (1Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Google Scholar, 2Van der Geer P. Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 10: 251-337Google Scholar). Defects in RTK genes, their overexpression, or autocrine ligand production may play a critical role in the induction and progression of certain neoplasms (3Yarden Y. Ullrich A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 443-478Google Scholar).Based on structural considerations RTKs have been divided into 14 sub-families (2Van der Geer P. Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 10: 251-337Google Scholar). One of these is the EPH family of receptors, which constitutes the largest known family of RTKs, named for the prototype member EPH of this family (2Van der Geer P. Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 10: 251-337Google Scholar). To date, cDNA sequences for nine distinct human EPH family members have been reported: EPH (4Hirai H. Maru Y. Hagiwara K. Nishida J. Takaku F.

However, unlike the other nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolases with this conserved sequence, the Orf17 protein does not complement the mutT− mutator phenotype, and thus must serve a different biological role in the cell. Members of the MutT family of proteins are categorized by a conserved amino acid motif originally identified as an important functional region in the Escherichia coli MutT and the Streptococcus pneumoniae MutX antimutator proteins (1Méjean V. Salles C. Bullions L.C. Bessman M.J. Claverys J.-P. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 323-330Google Scholar). This conserved amino acid signature sequence was found, by computer search, to be present in a number of open reading frames broadly distributed throughout nature, from viruses to humans (1Méjean V. Salles C. Bullions L.C. Bessman M.J. Claverys J.-P. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 323-330Google Scholar, 2Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4847Google Scholar), and one of these, orf17 (GenBank D10165, 1992), is the subject of this paper. The orf17 gene is located at 41 min on the E. coli chromosome (3Bachmann B.J. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 130-197Google Scholar) just upstream of the ruvC gene (4Takahagi M. Iwasaki H. Nakata A.

Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5747-5753Google Scholar). Both the MutT and MutX proteins are nucleoside triphosphatases (6Bullions L.C. Méjean V. Claverys J.-P. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12339-12344Google Scholar, 7Bhatnagar S.K. Bullions L.C. Bessman M.J. J. Biol.

Furuichi M. Tsuzuki T. Kakuma T. Kawabata S.-I. Maki H. Sekiguchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23524-23530Google Scholar), and all four are implicated in preventing mutations. On the other hand, two other proteins containing the MutT signature sequence are not nucleoside triphosphatases. One of them, a nucleoside pyrophosphatase, prefers NADH as its substrate (10Frick D.N. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1529-1534Google Scholar), while the other, GDP-mannose mannosyl hydrolase, prefers GDP-mannose (11Frick D.N. Townsend B.D. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24086-24091Google Scholar). Neither of these latter two enzymes has been linked to a mutagenic pathway. A feature common to all six enzymes containing the signature sequence is the hydrolysis of a substrate containing a nucleoside diphosphate linkage. In this paper, we describe the cloning and expression of the orf17 gene, and the purification and characterization of the Orf17 protein. Like the first four enzymes described above, it is a nucleoside triphosphatase. However, unlike those four enzymes, which prefer dGTP as a substrate over the other canonical (deoxy)nucleoside triphosphates, Orf17 has a unique preference for dATP, and it does not appear to be involved in antimutagenesis.

The orf17 gene was subcloned from plasmid pHS234 (4Takahagi M. Iwasaki H. Nakata A. Shinagawa H. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5747-5753Google Scholar) provided by H. Shinagawa. It was amplified in the polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotide primers, d(CCGCATATGAAGGATAAAGTGTATAAGCGT) and d(CGCGGATCCAGATAGCCCTGCCTGTTCAGG), designed to incorporate an NdeI site at the start of the gene, a BamHI site at its end, and an ATG start codon. The amplified gene was digested with NdeI and BamHI, purified by gel electrophoresis, and ligated into the NdeI and BamHI sites of pET11b to place the orf17 gene under control of a T7 lac promoter for overexpression. The resultant plasmid, pETorf17, was used to transform E. coli strains HB101 for storage and HMS174(DE3) for expression. Four liters of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin were inoculated with HMS174(DE3):pETorf17, grown at 37°C to an A600 of 1.0, induced with 1 mM IPTG, and grown for an additional 2.5 h. The cells were harvested, washed by suspension in 2 volumes of a saline solution (0.5% KCl, 0.5% NaCl), recentrifuged, and frozen at −80°C. Freezing the cells was essential for preparing the extract. The cells were extracted in 2 volumes of buffer A (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM DTT), centrifuged, and re-extracted, and the supernatants were combined. A typical extract (Fraction I) yielded approximately 100 mg of protein from 10 g of cells. Fraction I was brought to 41% saturation by the addition of 26 ml of saturated ammonium sulfate to 37.5 ml of crude extract. The precipitate was removed by centrifugation and discarded, and an additional 22.5 ml of ammonium sulfate were added to the supernatant to give a 57% saturated solution. This precipitate, containing the Orf17 protein, was collected and dissolved in 1 ml of buffer A (Fraction II). Fraction II was loaded onto a 1.5 × 55-cm Sephadex G-50 gel filtration column and eluted with buffer A. The fractions containing the Orf17 protein were combined (19.5 ml), concentrated by precipitation in 60% saturated ammonium sulfate, and dissolved in 1 ml of buffer A, yielding 18 mg of Orf17 protein, which were stored at −80°C (Fraction III). The plasmid, pETorf17, was digested with XbaI and HindIII, and the fragment containing the orf17 gene was ligated into pTRC99A to produce pTRCorf17. The plasmid, pTRCmutT, was constructed in a similar way from pETmutT (12Abeygunawardana C. Weber D.J. Frick D.N. Bessman M.J. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13071-13080Google Scholar) substituting BamHI for XbaI. E. coli strain SB3, lacking a functional MutT protein, was transformed with pTRC99A, pTRCmutT, or pTRCorf17. These strains were grown in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 1 mM IPTG, and mutation frequencies were determined by plating aliquots on LB plates containing either 150 μg/ml streptomycin or 20 μg/ml nalidixic acid. Similarly, E. coli strains, AB1157 (orf17+) and HRS1024 (orf17−), both gifts from H. Shinagawa (4Takahagi M. Iwasaki H. Nakata A. Shinagawa H. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5747-5753Google Scholar), were grown in LB medium and mutation frequencies were determined on nalidixic acid plates as above. Mutation frequencies are reported as the average of five separate determinations. Two standard enzyme assays, both based on the production of PPi from dATP, were used. The standard reaction mix contained in 50 μl: 4 mM dATP, 50 mM Tris, pH 9, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1% glycerol, 0.5 unit of inorganic pyrophosphatase, and 0.3-3 milliunits of Orf17 enzyme. The reaction was run at 37°C for 15 min, terminated by the addition of 50 μl of a mixture of four parts of Norit® (20% packed volume) and one part of 7% HClO4, centrifuged, and an aliquot of the supernatant was analyzed for inorganic orthophosphate by the method of Ames and Dubin (14Ames B.N. Dubin D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 769-775Google Scholar). A unit of activity is 1 μmol of PPi/min under these conditions. This is similar to the standard colorimetric assay with the following modifications. [γ-32P]ATP (about 500 cpm/nmol) was used as the substrate. The reaction was terminated as in the colorimetric assay (except that 5 N HCl was substituted for the HClO4) and an aliquot of the supernatant was analyzed for radioactivity. Since ATP is hydrolyzed at half the rate of dATP (see Table I), a unit of enzyme in this assay is comparable to 2 units in the colorimetric assay.Table I.Substrate specificity of the Orfl7 nucleoside triphosphataseSubstrateSpecific activityaA unit of enzyme hydrolyzes 1 μmol of substrate/min.Relative activitykcat/KmbThese values are from Frick (13).Relative Kcat/KmbThese values are from Frick (13).units mg−1M−1 s−1dATP15(100)7500(100)dTTP7.450130017dUTP6.443dCTP6.241110015dGTP6.14180011ATP7.651130017GTP3.624UTP1.812CTP1.49dADP1.912dAMP<0.1<1a A unit of enzyme hydrolyzes 1 μmol of substrate/min.b These values are from Frick (13Frick D.N. The Catalytic Core of the Escherichia coli MutT Enzyme..Ph.D. thesis. 49. The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore1995Google Scholar). Open table in a new tab Experiments were done at 32°C on a Varian Unityplus 600 NMR spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm broad band probe with field/frequency locking on the D2O resonance. The 31P NMR spectra were recorded with a transmitter frequency of 243 MHz, a spectral width of 12,000 Hz, and proton decoupling. Each spectrum was recorded with an acquisition time of 2.75 s and a relaxation delay of 6 s. The enzymatic reaction was monitored continuously in blocks of 64-256 transients for 4 h. The spectrum in this paper was collected with 256 scans between 2.5 and 3 h after the addition of enzyme. Resonances were assigned by comparing reaction spectra to those of standards of dAMP, dADP, dATP, sodium pyrophosphate, and sodium phosphate, and chemical shifts were measured relative to an external standard of 85% phosphoric acid. The data were subjected to Fourier transformation after processing with line broadening of −1 Hz and a shifted sine bell function for resolution enhancement. The orf17 gene was subcloned as described under “Methods.” Its sequence agrees with Takahagi et al. (4Takahagi M. Iwasaki H. Nakata A. Shinagawa H. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5747-5753Google Scholar) except for the original GTG start site, which we modified to ATG as a matter of convenience. Expression of the gene from pETorf17 results in the appearance of a major band on SDS gels corresponding to a 17-kDa polypeptide (Fig. 1), which, when treated according to the outlined purification procedure, results in an essentially pure protein (>95% as visualized on the gel). Attention is called to a faint band in the high molecular weight region of the gel. This most likely represents an aggregated form of the protein, not a contaminant. It is consistently seen in varying amounts in different preparations of the enzyme. It is not present in extracts of cells transformed with the vector lacking the insert (lane 2) and a sequence analysis of the N-terminal 10 amino acids of the final preparation indicates that the enzyme is at least 98% homogeneous with respect to these residues (data not shown). It is noteworthy that the bulk of the Orf17 protein is released from the cells merely by freezing them and extracting with a dilute buffer. This results in a crude extract much more highly enriched in Orf17 than procedures involving more complete disruption of the cells, such as sonication. One other member of the MutT family of proteins, the GDP-mannose hydrolase (11Frick D.N. Townsend B.D. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24086-24091Google Scholar), is also readily extractable from previously frozen cells. Perhaps these two expressed enzymes share a common cellular compartment such as the periplasmic space, which may be breeched in the freeze-thaw cycle, or they may share some other feature not readily apparent. At any rate, this mild extraction procedure facilitates the subsequent purification, because the bulk of cellular proteins is left behind in the cell pellet. As shown in Table I, the enzyme hydrolyzes all eight of the canonical (deoxy)nucleoside triphosphates with a marked preference for dATP. The next most favored substrate is approximately 6-fold lower in catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km). The enzyme recognizes not only the nucleotide base, but the sugar, as well, since in each case, the ribo nucleotide is less active than its corresponding deoxy equivalent. Especially noteworthy is the low activity of dGTP relative to dATP, amounting to an order of magnitude difference in catalytic efficiency. This is in marked contrast to the MutT nucleoside triphosphatase, which prefers dGTP, hydrolyzing it at a 30-fold higher rate (7Bhatnagar S.K. Bullions L.C. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9050-9054Google Scholar) and with a catalytic efficiency 2 orders of magnitude higher than with dATP (13Frick D.N. The Catalytic Core of the Escherichia coli MutT Enzyme..Ph.D. thesis. 49. The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore1995Google Scholar). The enzyme is maximally active at pH 8.6, diminishing to 50% activity at pH 7.6 or 9.9 (data not shown). This distinctly alkaline optimum is similar to the pH versus rate profiles of three other members of the E. coli MutT family i.e. MutT (7Bhatnagar S.K. Bullions L.C. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9050-9054Google Scholar), NADH pyrophosphatase (10Frick D.N. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1529-1534Google Scholar), and GDP-mannose hydrolase (11Frick D.N. Townsend B.D. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24086-24091Google Scholar). As with all other members of the MutT family, a divalent cation is required for activity, and Mg2+ is most effective. The optimal concentration is 5 mM for free Mg2+, and substitution of Mn2+, Ca2+, or Zn2+ at 1 mM or 5 mM reduces the rate 10-fold or more. Mg2+ did not activate the enzyme until its concentration exceeded that of the substrate, suggesting that two metal ions are involved in the catalysis, as has been demonstrated for the MutT enzyme (15Frick D.N. Weber D.J. Gillespie J.R. Bessman M.J. Mildvan A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1794-1803Google Scholar). The salts, NaCl or KCl, reduced the enzymatic activity by 50% at concentrations of 200 mM. The nature of the products formed during the enzymatic hydrolysis of dATP were determined in standard colorimetric assay mixtures scaled up 20-fold. Two reactions were run in parallel, except for the omission of yeast inorganic pyrophosphatase in one of them. Aliquots were removed over a 30-min period and analyzed for nucleotides by HPLC and inorganic orthophosphate as described under “Methods.” In the absence of inorganic pyrophosphatase, no inorganic orthophosphate was detected throughout the incubation. Fig. 2 reports the results of the analysis of the incubation mixture containing yeast inorganic pyrophosphatase. The disappearance of dATP is reflected in the appearance of dAMP and PPi (calculated as 2 Pi) in approximately equivalent amounts. No dADP was detected during the course of the incubation and no Pi was detected in the absence of inorganic pyrophosphatase. Thus, the reaction describing the hydrolysis may be written as follows. dATP+H2O→dAMP+PPi REACTION 1 The nature of the products are the same as those reported for two other related enzymes, the MutT and MutX nucleoside triphosphatases. It had been demonstrated previously that the mechanism of hydrolysis of dGTP by MutT involves a nucleophilic attack on the β-phosphorus of the triphosphate, rather than on the more generally favored α-phosphorus, which would yield the same products (16Weber D.J. Bhatnagar S.K. Bullions L.C. Bessman M.J. Mildvan A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16939-16942Google Scholar). It was therefore of interest to determine whether the Orf17 enzyme, having a different specificity but producing similar products, also utilizes the same mechanism of attack. Accordingly, the hydrolysis of dATP by Orf17 was conducted in 25% H218O and the products were analyzed by 31P NMR spectroscopy. The proton decoupled 243-MHz 31P NMR spectrum of the reaction mixture is shown in Fig. 3. The course of the reaction, as measured by NMR spectroscopy, independently confirms the direct conversion of dATP to dAMP and PPi. Peaks corresponding to the substrate dATP and the products dAMP and PPi are observable, whereas no peaks corresponding to Pα (−12.4 ppm) or Pβ (−8.3 ppm) of dADP are observable and the peak corresponding to Pi (0 ppm) is negligible. The spectrum for the reaction consists of a doublet centered at −13.0 ppm corresponding to the α-phosphorus of dATP, a triplet centered at −21.4 ppm corresponding to the β-phosphorus of dATP, and a doublet centered at −8.0 ppm corresponding to the γ-phosphorus of dATP, as well as resonances corresponding to dAMP (1.3 ppm) and inorganic pyrophosphate (−7.8 ppm). The resonance at 1.3 ppm corresponding to the phosphorus of dAMP shows a single peak, indicating no 18O labeling of this product. Two resonances corresponding to inorganic pyrophosphate are observed, one resonance at −7.764 ppm corresponding to pyrophosphate containing only 16O and the other at −7.776 ppm corresponding to pyrophosphate labeled by 18O with a chemical shift difference of 0.012 ppm (2.85 Hz). 18O directly bonded to phosphorus causes an upfield chemical shift of the phosphorus resonance relative to the chemical shift of the resonance for unlabeled phosphorus (17Cohn M. Hu A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 200-203Google Scholar, 18Lowe G. Sproat B.S. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1978; : 733-735Google Scholar). In pyrophosphate, the two phosphorus atoms are strongly coupled such that the resonances for unlabeled and 18O-labeled phosphorus collapse into an apparent singlet 0.012 ppm upfield of the resonance for unlabeled pyrophosphate (19Reynolds M.A. Oppenheimer N.J. Kenyon G.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1983; 105: 6663-6667Google Scholar). The intensity ratio of the resonances for unlabeled PPi and [18O]PPi is 3:1 consistent with 25% H218O in the reaction mixture (16Weber D.J. Bhatnagar S.K. Bullions L.C. Bessman M.J. Mildvan A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16939-16942Google Scholar, 19Reynolds M.A. Oppenheimer N.J. Kenyon G.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1983; 105: 6663-6667Google Scholar). These results show that hydrolysis of the Pα-Pβ linkage of dATP occurs by attack on the β-phosphorus rather than by the more frequently observed attack on the α-phosphorus (20Walsh C. Enzymatic Reaction Mechanisms. W. H. Freeman, New York1979: 259Google Scholar). The observations were substantiated by repeating the reaction in 65% H218O. Again, one peak was detected for dAMP and two peaks were detected for inorganic pyrophosphate with an intensity ratio of approximately 1:2 in respect to unlabeled PPi and [18O]PPi (data not shown). Thus, Orf17 dATPase is similar to the MutT dGTPase in catalyzing a nucleophilic attack by H2O (or initially by the enzyme, followed by H2O) on the β-phosphorus of dATP or dGTP, respectively. Standard procedures were used to determine the general kinetic parameters of the dATPase. Initial estimates of the Km and Vmax were obtained from double-reciprocal plots of substrate versus initial velocity (21Lineweaver H. Burk D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1934; 56: 658-666Google Scholar) and then refined using a nonlinear least squares analysis weighted to substrate concentration (22Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-139Google Scholar) (data not shown). The values are reported in Table II.Table IIKinetic parameters for Orf17 dATPaseParameterVmax18.0 ± 0.6 μmol min−1 mg−1kcat5.2 ± 0.16 s−1Km0.79 ± 0.08 mMKi (dAMP)4.2 ± 0.2 mMKi (PPi)19 ± 3 μM Open table in a new tab An interesting aspect of the reaction emerged early in the project, when we noticed that the rate of dATP hydrolysis decreased markedly during the course of the incubation. Further investigation implicated product inhibition as the cause, since inclusion of inorganic pyrophosphatase in the reaction mixture restored initial rates. This is shown in Fig. 4A, where the time course of dAMP formation is compared in the presence and absence of inorganic pyrophosphatase. That PPi and not dAMP is the product responsible for the inhibition is pointed up by the relative Ki values determined from the plots in Fig. 4 (B and C). Note that the concentrations of dAMP and PPi differ by 100-fold in the two graphs, and the Ki values calculated from these data are approximately 4 mM for dAMP and 20 μM for PPi. MutT nucleoside triphosphatase, which shares many of the properties of the Orf17 enzyme, has a 50-fold higher Ki for PPi and relatively little product inhibition. 2S. K. Bhatnagar and M. J. Bessman, unpublished observations. We have searched for possible covalent enzyme-substrate intermediates involving dAM32P or 32PPi without success, and neither of these labeled products exchanges with dATP within the limits of our measurements during the course of the reaction. Failure to detect a covalent deoxyadenylate-enzyme intermediate by exchange of 32PPi into dATP is consistent with a nucleophilic attack at the β-phosphorus rather than the α-phosphorus, as found by 18O incorporation into pyrophosphate. Failure to detect a covalent pyrophosphoryl-enzyme intermediate by exchange of dAM32P into dATP indicates either that the intermediate does not exist, or that it forms irreversibly. In this regard, it is interesting to speculate about the Orf17 dATPase activity within the E. coli cell. Josse (23Josse J. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 1938-1947Google Scholar, 24Josse J. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 1948-1957Google Scholar), in his elegant studies on E. coli inorganic pyrophosphatase, has shown that the enzyme is constitutive and accounts for approximately 0.2% of the cellular protein. It hydrolyzes PPi at the rate of about 1.5 mmol min−1 mg−1, and it has a Km of 5 μM. Thus one might expect that the intracellular PPi concentration would be kept well below the 20 μM Ki for the Orf17 dATPase, and that this enzyme would be active in the cytoplasm. However, Kukko and Heinonen (25Kuhko E. Heinonen J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 127: 347-349Google Scholar) and Kukko-Kalske et al. (26Kukko-Kalske E. Lintunen M. Inen M.K. Laht R. Heinonen J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4498-4500Google Scholar) have shown that the intracellular concentration of PPi in E. coli is 0.5 mM and is independent of very large fluctuations in the amount of inorganic pyrophosphatase in the cells. At 0.5 mM PPi, the dATPase would be expected to be almost completely inhibited. Perhaps the location of the dATPase is an important consideration. As pointed out in the purification scheme (see “Methods”), the enzyme is readily released from cells merely by a freeze-thaw cycle, suggesting that it may reside in the periplasmic space. If this is its normal residence, the consideration of cytoplasmic PPi concentrations may not be germane to its in situ activity. Further investigations will be necessary to elucidate the mechanism of inhibition by PPi, and perhaps its significance will emerge when the physiological role of the dATPase is understood. Although the orf17 gene is located close to ruvC, it probably is not involved in ruvC function (4Takahagi M. Iwasaki H. Nakata A. Shinagawa H. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5747-5753Google Scholar). Our original interest in the Orf17 protein derived from a small region of amino acid homology common to it and MutT, as shown in Fig. 5A. This same region is highly homologous to MutX of S. pneumoniae (1Méjean V. Salles C. Bullions L.C. Bessman M.J. Claverys J.-P. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 323-330Google Scholar), to a MutT homologue of P. vulgaris (8Kamath A.V. Yanofsky C. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 134: 99-102Google Scholar), and to a human 8-oxo-dGTPase (9Sakumi K. Furuichi M. Tsuzuki T. Kakuma T. Kawabata S.-I. Maki H. Sekiguchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23524-23530Google Scholar). All of these latter four proteins are involved in preventing mutations of the AT → CG variety, and all of the genes coding for these proteins complement mutT− strains. In addition, they all hydrolyze nucleoside triphosphates to PPi and nucleoside monophosphates. For these reasons, it was of interest to determine whether or not Orf17, which catalyzes similar reactions, is also involved in preventing mutations. Accordingly, a plasmid containing orf17 was used to transform a mutT− strain of E. coli. Although the transformed strain produced large quantities of the enzyme (data not shown), the results in Table III clearly demonstrate that orf17 does not complement mutT. Thus, it is most likely not the putative suppressor of mutT referred to by Ray (27Ray U. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1979; 171: 215-218Google Scholar) or Desiraju (28Desiraju V. Studies on the Mechanism of A/T to C/G Transversion in MutT Mutant of Escherichia coli and Identification of a New F Factor Gene sut1 That Can Suppress MutT Mutation..Ph.D. thesis. University of Maryland, Baltimore1991Google Scholar). Furthermore, a strain of E. coli, lacking the orf17 gene, has no significant enhancement in mutation frequency when compared to its wild type parent (Table III). Thus Orf17 does not share the antimutator properties of MutT. A broader spectrum of tests will have to be performed in order to see if orf17 is involved in other mutational pathways.Table III.Mutation frequencies of bacterial strainsBacterial strainaSB3 (mutT−) is a strain lacking a functional MutT protein, AB1157 (orf17+) is a wild type parent strain of HRS1024 (orf17−), and HRS1024 (orf17−) is a strain lacking a portion of the orf17 gene.PlasmidMutation frequenciesbNumbers represent the average (± standard deviation) mutation frequency of five separate cultures. nalr and strepr are colonies resistant to nalidixic acid or streptomycin, respectively.nalrstreprmutants/109 cellsmutants/109 cellsSB3 (mutT−)pTrc99A1200 ± 560900 ± 520pTrcMutT7 ± 144 ± 4pTrcOrf172000 ± 12002100 ± 1500AB1157 (orf17+)7 ± 11—c—, not determined because both AB1157 and HRS1024 already contain a streptomycin resistance factor.HRS1024 (orf17−)<1—c—, not determined because both AB1157 and HRS1024 already contain a streptomycin resistance factor.a SB3 (mutT−) is a strain lacking a functional MutT protein, AB1157 (orf17+) is a wild type parent strain of HRS1024 (orf17−), and HRS1024 (orf17−) is a strain lacking a portion of the orf17 gene.b Numbers represent the average (± standard deviation) mutation frequency of five separate cultures. nalr and strepr are colonies resistant to nalidixic acid or streptomycin, respectively.c —, not determined because both AB1157 and HRS1024 already contain a streptomycin resistance factor. Open table in a new tab On the other hand, it is quite possible that Orf17 dATPase does not play a role in antimutagenesis. We have included in Fig. 5B three additional proteins with the highly homologous MutT signature sequence, yet having no nucleoside triphosphatase activity and no apparent role in preventing mutations. Orf257 and Orf1.9 are newly discovered enzymes, which hydrolyze NADH (10Frick D.N. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1529-1534Google Scholar) and GDP-mannose (11Frick D.N. Townsend B.D. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24086-24091Google Scholar), respectively, and the gene for another related enzyme hydrolyzing diadenosine tetraphosphate has recently been cloned from human tissue (29Thorne M.H. Hanken S. Wilkinson M.C. Nuñez C. Barraclough R. McLennan A.G. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 717-721Google Scholar). We are presently characterizing two new enzymes bearing the MutT signature sequence, which also are not nucleoside triphosphatases. 3D. M. Frick, S. F. O'Handley, and M. J. Bessman, unpublished observations. The feature common to all these enzymes is their recognition and hydrolysis of metabolites containing a nucleoside diphosphate linkage. It seems likely that the MutT signature sequence represents a nucleoside diphosphate binding and catalytic site conserved during evolution for the implementation of diverse metabolic reactions involving nucleoside diphosphates. The solution structure of the MutT protein reveals this signature sequence to be located in the loop 1-helix 1 motif of an α+β sandwich (30Abeygunawardana C. Weber D.J. Gittis A.G. Frick D.N. Lin J. Miller A.-F. Bessman M.J. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14997-15005Google Scholar). Recently, crystals of Orf17 dATPase have been obtained suitable for x-ray analysis, 4S. Gabelli, M. J. Bessman, and L. M. Amzel, unpublished observations. and it will be of interest to see how the structural features of the signature sequence common to both enzymes compare in these otherwise very diverse proteins. At present, no specific physiological function can be ascribed to the Orf 17 dATPase. However, the availability of isogenic strains of E. coli with and without the enzyme, along with a clone overexpressing it, provides an excellent system for comparative experiments designed to elucidate the metabolic role of the enzyme. Finally, the results presented here introduce a note of caution in ascribing MutT antimutator function to newly discovered proteins containing the MutT signature sequence. The Orf17 dATPase described here, as well as the NADH pyrophosphatase (10Frick D.N. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1529-1534Google Scholar), the GDP-mannose hydrolase (11Frick D.N. Townsend B.D. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24086-24091Google Scholar), the diadenosine tetraphosphatase (29Thorne M.H. Hanken S. Wilkinson M.C. Nuñez C. Barraclough R. McLennan A.G. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 717-721Google Scholar), and two recently discovered enzymes3 all contain the MutT sequence, but differ markedly in their substrate preferences and detailed reactions. It will be of interest to discover how broadly this amino acid motif is employed in nature to participate in diverse metabolic pathways.

https://openalex.org/W2057955494,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which lack a functional SOD1 gene, encoding the cytosolic Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1), exhibit a variety of metabolic defects in aerobic but not in anaerobic growth. We test here the hypothesis that some of these defects may be due to specific transcriptional changes programmed for cell survival under dioxygen stress. Analysis of the budding pattern and generation time showed that the slower proliferation of an sod1Δ mutant strain under air was due to an increase from 42 to 89 min spent in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. This delay in G1 was not due to an overall decline in biosynthetic activity since total protein and mRNA synthesis was not reduced even under 100% O2. However, rRNA synthesis was strongly decreased, e.g. by 80% in the mutant under 100% O2 (in comparison to N2). Under these conditions, the mutant permanently arrested in G1; this arrest was due to an inhibition of the Start function that prepares yeast for S phase. This Start arrest was due to an inhibition of transcription of the autoregulated G1 cyclins, CLN1 and CLN2; the transcription of the constitutive G1 cyclin, CLN3, was unaffected by the stress. Expression of a hyperstable Cln3 prevented the G1 arrest, indicating that it was due solely to the inhibition of cell cycle-dependent cyclin expression. This remodeling of transcription in oxidative stress was seen also in the inhibition of glucose derepression of SUC2 expression. In contrast, the signaling and activation of mating pheromone (FUS1) and copper-responsive (CUP1) promoter activity were not affected by dioxygen stress, while genes encoding other anti-oxidant enzymes (SOD2, CTT1 and CTA1) were strongly induced. The UBI loci, encoding ubiquitin, were particularly good examples of this pattern of negative and positive transcriptional response to the stress. UBI1-UBI3 expression was repressed in the mutant under 100% O2, while expression of UBI4 was strongly induced. The data demonstrate that extensive remodeling of transcription occurs in yeast under a strong dioxygen stress. This remodeling results in a pattern of expression of gene products needed for defense and repair, and suppression of activities associated with normal proliferative growth. Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which lack a functional SOD1 gene, encoding the cytosolic Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1), exhibit a variety of metabolic defects in aerobic but not in anaerobic growth. We test here the hypothesis that some of these defects may be due to specific transcriptional changes programmed for cell survival under dioxygen stress. Analysis of the budding pattern and generation time showed that the slower proliferation of an sod1Δ mutant strain under air was due to an increase from 42 to 89 min spent in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. This delay in G1 was not due to an overall decline in biosynthetic activity since total protein and mRNA synthesis was not reduced even under 100% O2. However, rRNA synthesis was strongly decreased, e.g. by 80% in the mutant under 100% O2 (in comparison to N2). Under these conditions, the mutant permanently arrested in G1; this arrest was due to an inhibition of the Start function that prepares yeast for S phase. This Start arrest was due to an inhibition of transcription of the autoregulated G1 cyclins, CLN1 and CLN2; the transcription of the constitutive G1 cyclin, CLN3, was unaffected by the stress. Expression of a hyperstable Cln3 prevented the G1 arrest, indicating that it was due solely to the inhibition of cell cycle-dependent cyclin expression. This remodeling of transcription in oxidative stress was seen also in the inhibition of glucose derepression of SUC2 expression. In contrast, the signaling and activation of mating pheromone (FUS1) and copper-responsive (CUP1) promoter activity were not affected by dioxygen stress, while genes encoding other anti-oxidant enzymes (SOD2, CTT1 and CTA1) were strongly induced. The UBI loci, encoding ubiquitin, were particularly good examples of this pattern of negative and positive transcriptional response to the stress. UBI1-UBI3 expression was repressed in the mutant under 100% O2, while expression of UBI4 was strongly induced. The data demonstrate that extensive remodeling of transcription occurs in yeast under a strong dioxygen stress. This remodeling results in a pattern of expression of gene products needed for defense and repair, and suppression of activities associated with normal proliferative growth. Organismal response to stressors represents an adaptive response to environmental change. This change could be in temperature, nutrient supply, incident radiation, or degree of oxidative stress, for example. Transcriptional control of gene expression is a major mechanism by which the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, like most organisms, adapts to new environments (1Mager W.H. De Kruijff A.J.J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 506-531Google Scholar, 2Mager W.H. Ferreira P.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 1-13Google Scholar). For example, glucose, which is a hormone-like messenger and a rapidly fermented sugar, has a dramatic effect on yeast metabolism and also on growth rate (3Thevelein J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1301-1307Google Scholar). These effects are due both to induction of genes necessary for rapid growth, e.g. genes encoding ribosomal proteins, and to repression of genes involved in respiration and metabolism of alternative carbon sources. Stress-induced genes such as CTT1 (4Belazzi T. Wagner A. Weiser R. Shanz M. Adam G. Hartig A. Ruis H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 585-592Google Scholar), encoding cytosolic catalase T, and UBI4 (5Finley D. Özkaynak E. Varshavsky A. Cell. 1987; 48: 1035-1046Google Scholar), encoding a polyubiquitin polypeptide, are also nutrient-repressed (6Werner-Washburne M. Braun E. Johnston G.C. Singer R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 383-401Google Scholar). Changes in gene expression are also characteristic of the heat shock response (1Mager W.H. De Kruijff A.J.J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 506-531Google Scholar, 2Mager W.H. Ferreira P.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 1-13Google Scholar), but heat shock has the opposite effect in comparison to the glucose response; heat shock causes an up-regulation of stress genes and a down-regulation of genes encoding rRNA and ribosomal proteins (7Veinot-Drebot L.M. Singer R.A. Johnston G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19473-19474Google Scholar). The effect of stress on rRNA synthesis is significant because of the close correlation between this synthesis and growth and proliferation (8Kraakman L.S. Griffioen G. Zerp S. Groeneveld P. Thevelein J.M. Mager W.H. Planta R.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 239: 196-204Google Scholar). Recent work has shown that yeast adapts to oxidative (peroxide) stress in a manner similar to its adaptation to heat shock, i.e. pre-exposure to a limited degree of stress protects from an otherwise lethal one (9Jamieson D.J. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6678-6681Google Scholar, 10Collinson L.P. Dawes I.W. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 329-335Google Scholar, 11Flattery-O'Brien J. Collinson L.P. Dawes I.W. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 501-507Google Scholar, 12Davies J.M.S. Lowry C.V. Davies K.J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 317: 1-6Google Scholar, 13Stephen D.W.S. Rivers S.L. Jamieson D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 415-423Google Scholar). This adaptation to oxidative stress accompanies a change in the protein synthetic pattern (12Davies J.M.S. Lowry C.V. Davies K.J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 317: 1-6Google Scholar, 14Jamieson D.J. Rivers S.L. Stephen D.W.S. Microbiol. 1994; 140: 3277-3283Google Scholar), a phenomenon seen also in response to heat shock (15Lindquist S. Craig E.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1988; 55: 1151-1191Google Scholar). However, there are limited data on the transcriptional remodeling that presumably underlies the changes in protein synthesis under oxidative stress. Thus, although it is known that in yeast H2O2 induces the expression of CTT1 (14Jamieson D.J. Rivers S.L. Stephen D.W.S. Microbiol. 1994; 140: 3277-3283Google Scholar, 16Marchler G. Schüller C. Adam G. Ruis H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1997-2003Google Scholar), for example, and that the expression of SOD1, encoding the cytosolic Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase, is slightly elevated in hyperoxic conditions (17Galiazzo F. Labbe-Bois R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 197-200Google Scholar), the overall transcriptional pattern associated with adaptation to oxidative stress, particularly due to dioxygen (rather than H2O2), has not been studied in detail. The theory of superoxide-mediated oxygen toxicity postulates that the superoxide radical (O2−) is pathogenic to cells due to the redox activity of and other downstream reactive oxygen species (18Cadenas E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 79-110Google Scholar). A eukaryotic cell lacking a primary defense against this cytotoxin, the cytosolic Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1), would be expected to be more sensitive to oxidative stress and therefore exhibit a stronger adaptive response. That is, by inactivating the “housekeeping” anti-oxidant enzyme in S. cerevisiae, we (19Chang E.C. Crawford B.F. Hong Z. Bilinski T. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4417-4424Google Scholar, 20Chang E.C. Kosman D.J. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1840-1845Google Scholar) and others (21Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5918-5920Google Scholar) have suggested that the aggravation of the stress due to both normo- and hyperoxia in an sod1Δ mutant will allow for a more definitive characterization of the oxidative stress response (22Gralla E.B. Kosman D.J. Adv. Genet. 1992; 30: 251-319Google Scholar). In fact, the phenotypes of an sod1Δ null mutant strain are consistent with this suggestion, in that this mutant strain does exhibit metabolic defects in aerobic but not in anaerobic growth, e.g. lysine and methionine auxotrophy (20Chang E.C. Kosman D.J. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1840-1845Google Scholar, 21Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5918-5920Google Scholar, 22Gralla E.B. Kosman D.J. Adv. Genet. 1992; 30: 251-319Google Scholar). Although such growth defects could be explained by reactive oxygen species inactivation of specific enzymes, as demonstrated for 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase in Escherichia coli, for example (23Gardner P.R. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1478-1483Google Scholar), they could also reflect a programmed, protective down-regulation of the expression of genes encoding these enzymes. That is, the adaptive response of an sod1Δ mutant might include a suppression of some, otherwise normal metabolic activities. Thus, in this study, we have sought to demonstrate that dioxygen stress in yeast does cause a change in the transcriptional pattern that extends beyond the induction of anti-oxidant enzyme defenses. In fact, the data presented do show that both positive and negative transcriptional changes occur in oxidative stress. While these changes do include the transcriptional activation of stress response genes, significantly they also include a repression of expression of G1 cyclins. This inhibition correlates to a cell cycle arrest in G1 or a stationary phase-like state in which anti-oxidant defenses are activated at the expense of expression of cell functions that promote growth and/or proliferation. Thus, this work provides new insight into the physiologic state of a yeast cell adapting to acute oxidative stress. The yeast strains used were DBY747 (MATa leu2-3, 112 his3 trp1-289 ura3-52 gal2), EG1 (DBY747 with sod1Δ::URA3) (21Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5918-5920Google Scholar), DTY3 (MATa trp1-1 leu2-3, 112 gal1 ura3-50 his4), and EG151 (DTY3 with sod1Δ::TRP1) (24Tamai K.T. Gralla E.B. Ellerby L.M. Valentine J.S. Thiele D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8013-8017Google Scholar). The CLN3-2 allele was inserted at the ARS1 locus in strains DBY747 and EG1 by double homologous recombination of CLN3-2 DNA taken from plasmid YRpDaf1-1 as described (25Cross F.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4675-4684Google Scholar). This created CLN3-2 dominant mutants in the wild type and sod1Δ backgrounds. Plasmid pSB234 is a high copy plasmid containing a FUS1-lacZ gene fusion; the fusion contains the 5′ FUS1 promoter plus sequences encoding the first 254 amino acids of FUS1 fused in-frame to the gene encoding β-galactosidase (26Trueheart J. Boeke J.D. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2316-2328Google Scholar). Gene fragments used for obtaining probes for Northern analysis were: SOD1, EcoRI-NaeI (nucleotides −169 to 365); SOD2, SpeI-NruI (nucleotides 565-1116); CTA1, EcoRV-HpaI (nucleotides 2263-2275); CTT1, AccI (nucleotides 830-2095); SUC2, BamHI-HindIII (830-base pair coding region, from M. Carlson); UBI1-UBI4, KpnI-EcoRI (200-base pair coding region, from D.

Cells were grown in YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose) or a synthetic complete medium (29Rose M.D. Winston F. Heiter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990: 179Google Scholar) at 30°C. Media used in glucose repression/derepression studies contained 4% (repression) or 0.1% glucose (derepression). Strains were maintained anaerobically prior to transfer to O2-containing media during an experiment. Anaerobic growth media contained 3 mg/liter ergosterol and 1 g/liter Tween 80. Nitrogen, air, or O2-saturated media or cultures were prepared by flushing gases for at least 30 min into airtight flasks equipped with an outlet. When cells were transferred to different concentrations of oxygen, cells were collected by centrifugation at room temperature and resuspended in freshly preflushed media. Cell growth was monitored by turbidity measured at 660 nm (A660). Cell morphology of budding was determined by microscopic examination of at least 150 cells/sample. Before assessment of budding patterns, cells were fixed in formaldehyde solution (7.4% formaldehyde, 0.15 M NaCl) and sonicated until individual cells were well separated. Cells incubated under O2 were subjected to 7-fold serial dilutions in YPD medium under air. Samples (100 μl) from the final dilution were plated on N2-presaturated YPD plates in triplicate and incubated under N2 for 3 days at 30°C. Visible colony formation at that time was taken as the measure of cell viability. For determining cell numbers, cells from the same culture taken at each time point were fixed immediately in 3% formaldehyde. The fixed cells were sonicated briefly to disrupt any clumps and were counted by microscopy using a hemocytometer. At least 200 cells were scored for each determination. Cells (10-100 ml of culture, A660 = 1.0) were harvested by centrifugation in the cold. Cells were broken using glass beads in cold breaking buffer in the presence of phenol-chloroform by vigorous vortexing. Following repeated extractions with phenol, chloroform, and isoamyl alcohol, total RNA was precipitated with ethanol. Electrophoresis of RNA (15-20 μg of total RNA) in formaldehyde-agarose gels was performed as described (30Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 7.43Google Scholar). The RNA was blotted onto Immobilon N (Millipore) by capillary action. The membrane was hybridized with probes labeled by random priming. Typically, 5 × 105 cpm/ml were added per filter. The membrane was then washed, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. Quantitation of transcripts was obtained by densitometric analysis of the film. Even loading of total RNA was verified by ethidium bromide staining of rRNA bands; in addition, ACT1 mRNA was used as an internal control. Exponentially growing cells were transferred to [3H]leucine or [3H]uracil-containing SC medium for the determination of protein or RNA synthesis, respectively. Cell samples were directly quenched into cold 5% trichloroacetic acid solution, washed, dried, and counted. There was a linear incorporation into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material during the time course of these experiments. For the determination of mRNA synthesis and degradation, the labeled cells were processed for RNA isolation and poly(A)+ RNA binding assay. To determine the rate of RNA degradation, thiolutin, an inhibitor of all three yeast RNA polymerases (31Tipper D.J. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 116: 245-256Google Scholar) was added to 6 μg/ml (32Herrick D. Parker R. Jacobson A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1990; 10: 2269-2284Google Scholar) to the labeled cells prior to the addition of 100 μM cold uracil. The decline of radiolabeled RNA species with time following this chase was taken as the degradation rate. Poly(U) filters were prepared by spotting 0.1 mg of poly(U) in the center of Whatman GF/C filters and irradiating 3 min/side under a 30-watt germicidal UV lamp (33Werner D. Chemla Y. Herzberg M. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 141: 329-336Google Scholar). Filters containing immobilized poly(U) were washed with binding buffer (0.1 M sodium phosphate, 0.12 M NaCl, 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 0.01 M Tris·HCl, pH 7.3). RNA samples were resuspended in the same buffer and applied to filters in a total volume of 200 μl. Samples were allowed to bind for 5 min, washed with the binding buffer and then with 5% cold trichloroacetic acid. The percentage of poly(A)+-containing RNA was corrected for nonspecific binding to control filters, which had not been treated with poly(U). β-Galactosidase activity (34Miller J. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 466Google Scholar) was measured using cell extracts and normalized by protein content which was determined by the Bradford assay (35Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). Cells (1 ml) containing the pSB234 lacZ fusion plasmid were harvested, washed, and resuspended in 100 μl of Z buffer (100 mM sodium phosphate, 10 mM KCl, and 1 mM MgSO4, pH 7.0). An equal volume of glass beads was added and vortexed vigorously at 4°C until 90% of the cells were broken as determined by microscopic examination. Supernatant (50 μl) was added and incubated in ONPG buffer (0.7 mg of o-nitrophenyl-β-galactopyranoside in Z buffer) at 28°C for 5-60 min. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 0.3 ml of 1 M Na2CO3, and the absorbance was read at 420 nm. In all of the experiments that follow, cells were pregrown under N2 in synthetic medium to log phase, then transferred to fresh medium that had been preflushed with N2, air, or 100% O2. This protocol was designed to induce a strong oxidative stress; this stress was demonstrated by the strong induction of a variety of anti-oxidant and stress response genes as shown in later figures. However, we tested first if the alteration in gene expression under oxidative stress observed in these subsequent experiments reflected effects of oxygen on macromolecular synthesis and/or turnover in general. Thus, the incorporation of radiolabeled precursors into RNA and protein was measured under various oxygen tensions for the sod1Δ mutant and wild type strains. Trichloroacetic acid-insoluble radioactivity was used as a relative measure of biosynthesis. Steady-state [3H]uracil incorporation into trichloroacetic acid-insoluble material was markedly sensitive to the degree of oxidative stress (Fig. 1). This [3H]uracil labeling of RNA in either the wild type in O2 (Fig. 1A, closed circles) or in the mutant in air (Fig. 1B, open triangles) was reduced to about the same extent, compared to the N2-grown samples for each strain (Fig. 1, A and B, square symbols). Furthermore, on exposure of the mutant cells to O2, there was almost complete inhibition of continued [3H]uracil incorporation after 40 min (Fig. 1B, open circles). The inhibition of RNA synthesis under this oxidative stress imposed on the mutant strain correlated with the magnitude of the oxygen-mediated inhibition of growth since sod1Δ mutants do not grow under 100% O2 although they remain >90% viable for up to 3 h in this condition (21Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5918-5920Google Scholar and 22Gralla E.B. Kosman D.J. Adv. Genet. 1992; 30: 251-319Google Scholar, and data not shown). In contrast to RNA synthesis, protein synthesis was not markedly inhibited over this initial 1-h period of oxidative stress (data not shown). Except for moderate inhibition of [3H]leucine incorporation in the mutant under O2 (<15% inhibition in comparison to labeling under N2), there were no significant differences in protein synthesis, as measured by this criterion in the mutant cells in air or in the wild type strain under either air or O2. Protein labeling did decline in the mutant after 3 h under O2; however, this correlated with a significant loss of viability as noted above. The fact that overall protein synthesis does not change immediately following exposure of the cells to oxidative stress suggests that the steady state level of total mRNA species did not change either although total RNA synthesis was inhibited (Fig. 1). To test this inference, the total RNA was fractionated to assess the distribution of rRNA and mRNA species expressed under the stress. In these experiments, the effect of oxygen was tested only in the mutant strain by comparing label incorporation in cultures that were transferred to N2, air, and 100% O2-saturated medium containing [3H]uracil. Total RNA was prepared from these cultures after 1 h of continuous labeling. From the total RNA, poly(A)+ RNA was isolated by retention on poly(U) filters. The quantitation of [3H]uracil incorporation into these RNA species is shown in Table I. These data show that the proportion of radioactivity in poly(A)+ RNA in comparison to total RNA was substantially greater in cells under oxidative stress than in nonstressed cells. This result suggested that overall mRNA synthesis was less susceptible to inhibition under these conditions than was rRNA synthesis and that the severe inhibition of total [3H]uracil incorporation in O2-treated mutant cells seen in Fig. 1B was due to the specific inhibition of rRNA synthesis.Table I.Effect of oxygen on poly(A)+ and total RNA synthesis in sod1Δ mutant strainSamplePoly(A)+%a% of controls, N2-labeled cultures for each RNA pool.Total RNA%a% of controls, N2-labeled cultures for each RNA pool.Poly(A)+/total RNA (%)cpm/μg RNAcpm/μg RNAN2115 ± 12bActual values (cpm/filter) ranged from 6000 to 14,000.

Open table in a new tab RNA degradation under oxidative stress was examined as well. In these experiments, mutant cells were first labeled with [3H]uracil for 1 h under N2. The label was then chased out during a 30-min incubation with cold uracil under N2, air, or 100% O2. Thiolutin, an inhibitor of all three yeast RNA polymerases (31Tipper D.J. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 116: 245-256Google Scholar), was added during this chase period. mRNA was again separated from total RNA as described above. The data showed that in the mutant there was no significant difference in the turnover of total RNA between the N2, air, and O2 samples (<5% turnover in 30 min). The rate of mRNA degradation under air or O2 was also not significantly different than under N2, with 50-55% loss of label in the 30-min chase period in all three samples. This result is consistent with the reported average rate of mRNA turnover in yeast (half-life, 20 min; 32Herrick D. Parker R. Jacobson A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1990; 10: 2269-2284Google Scholar). Thus, overall RNA degradation is not stimulated by oxidative stress in yeast. Taken together, these several results indicate that under oxidative stress there is a strong inhibition of rRNA synthesis that leads to a decline of overall RNA accumulation. In contrast, the cell's ability to synthesize mRNA and protein is not inhibited, nor is RNA stability altered by the stress. The effect of oxidative stress on the pattern of RNA synthesis described above is similar to what is observed when S. cerevisiae is treated with chemical reagents (other than mating factor) that block performance of Start, the interval between the G1 and S phases of the yeast cell cycle (36Veinot-Drebot L.M. Singer R.A. Johnston G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19528-19534Google Scholar). We tested the possibility that the sod1Δ strain, in particular, exhibited a similar Start delay or arrest in G1. Under air, this mutant does grow more slowly than wild type (21Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5918-5920Google Scholar). Representative doubling times for wild type and mutant in rich medium under air (and N2) are given in Table II. To determine if the slower growth of mutant in air was characterized by a difference in cell budding morphology, we examined both cultures microscopically to assess the ratio of budded to unbudded cells in each. The fraction of the cells that are unbudded is a measure of the fraction of the culture that is in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. In fact, there were 50% more unbuds in the sod1Δ air-grown culture than in the wild type (Table II). As shown in the table, the growth rate and budding patterns were the same for these strains when grown under N2. Assuming that the unbudded fraction represented the fraction of the doubling time spent in G1, the time spent in G1 was calculated for both strains. This calculation indicated that the mutant strain grew more slowly than wild type under air because it spent twice as long in G1 (Table II).Table II.Generation time and G1 duration in wild type and sod1Δ mutant strainsWild type (DBY747)sod1Δ mutant (EG1)Generation time (min)aGeneration times were calculated by counting number of newly-budded cells appearing during the 8-h incubation under air.

Open table in a new tab We next examined the change in the budding pattern associated with the shift from N2 to O2 (or air) as in the labeling experiments above. At t = 0, cells proliferating under N2 were transferred to fresh media presaturated with air or 100% O2. The O2-exposed cultures were divided in half 3 h later, at which point one-half was transferred back to N2-saturated medium while the other half was maintained in O2. When bud morphology was examined in these cultures, wild type responded to 100% O2 by slightly and transiently accumulating as unbudded cells (Fig. 2A, solid circles); the population of unbudded cells was not significantly changed under air (Fig. 2A, solid triangles). The response of the sod1Δ mutant strain was markedly different. First, the shift from N2 to air caused a temporary increase in unbudded cells (Fig. 2B, open triangles), i.e. the pattern of arrest in the mutant under air was similar to that seen with the wild type cells under 100% O2. Furthermore, unlike wild type cells under any condition, in oxygen the mutant cell culture arrested permanently as large, unbudded cells (Fig. 2B, open circles). These cells remained viable for up to 3 h, since they completely recovered in 1 h if the stress was removed at that time (Fig. 2B, open squares). After 3 h under 100% O2, however, the sod1Δ mutant culture began to lose viability (data not shown). These budding data indicate that dioxygen stress in yeast causes a cell cycle arrest in G1 prior to Start that is either transient or permanent depending on the level of stress. Performance of Start in yeast depends on the periodic activation of the p34cdc28 protein kinase by association with the G1 cyclins (37Koch C. Nasmyth K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 451-459Google Scholar). Because cyclin proteins are unstable (38Tyers M. Tokiwa G. Futcher B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1955-1968Google Scholar, 39Tyers M. Tokiwa G. Nash R. Futcher B.

Using cloned SV40 genome, we replaced large T antigen gene (Tag) with a polylinker, and inserted firefly luciferase, controlled by SV40 early promoter. Transfection into Tag-expressing cells yielded Tag-deficient virus, SVluc. SVluc was Tag-deficient and therefore replication-deficient in cells that did not supply Tag. SVluc transduced functional luciferase expression in vitro. BALB/c mice were inoculated with SVluc, and their tissues were assayed 3-21 days post-inoculation (dpi) for luciferase protein production and enzyme activity. Luciferase protein was detected by immunohistochemistry throughout the experiment, from 3 to 21 dpi. There was no inflammatory reaction against SVluc-infected cells at any time, in any tissue studied. Luciferase activity was first detected by luminometry 14 dpi, and remained level through day 21. Thus, replication-deficient recombinant SV40 can mediate gene transfer in vitro and in vivo."

In this study we have shown that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) induces a rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of PI 3-kinase and association with HGF receptor/Met in Mv1Lu epithelial cells. Murine mammary carcinoma (SP1) cells, which co-express HGF and HGF receptor/Met, showed sustained phosphorylation of PI 3-kinase. Wortmannin, a potent inhibitor of PI 3-kinase, inhibited HGF-induced PI 3-kinase activity, proliferation of Mv1Lu cells, and spontaneous growth of SP1 cells in a dose-, and time-dependent manner. Transfection of a dominant negative mutant p85 (Δp85) subunit of PI 3-kinase into SP1 cells strongly inhibited HGF-stimulated proliferation and PI 3-kinase activity. However, wortmannin did not influence HGF-induced c-Jun expression. Furthermore, HGF stimulated S6 kinase activity, but its activity was not required for HGF-induced proliferation. Overall, these results suggest that HGF-induced PI 3-kinase activity is important for the mitogenic action of HGF in epithelial cells and further demonstrate that expression of c-Jun is not influenced by inhibition of PI 3-kinase activity.

https://openalex.org/W2041977269,"Neutrophils stimulated with the chemoattractant fMet-Leu-Phe (fMLP) are known to exhibit rapid activation of four protein kinases with molecular masses of ~69, ~63, ~49, and ~40-kDa. Activation of these kinases is blocked by antagonists of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and type 1 and/or type 2A protein phosphatases. These enzymes can be detected by their ability to undergo renaturation and catalyze the phosphorylation of a peptide substrate that corresponds to amino acid residues 297-331 of the 47-kDa subunit of the NADPH-oxidase complex fixed within a gel. In this report, we demonstrate that an antibody generated to a fusion protein containing amino acid residues 175-306 of p21-activated protein kinase 1 (Pak1) reacts with three proteins in guinea pig neutrophils with molecular masses in the 60-70-kDa range during Western blotting. This antibody immunoprecipitates both the 69- and 63-kDa renaturable kinases from lysates of stimulated cells along with a minor 60-kDa kinase. No activities were observed for any of these enzymes in immunoprecipitates from unstimulated neutrophils. However, addition of ATP and activated Rac 1 or Cdc42 to immunoprecipitates from unstimulated cells resulted in the stimulation of two renaturable kinases with molecular masses in the 69- and 63-kDa range. These immunoprecipitates also contained two novel protein kinases with masses of ~49 and 40 kDa that were selectively activated by Cdc42. In contrast, the 69- and 63-kDa kinases were not immunoprecipitated from lysates of stimulated neutrophils with an antibody to Pak2 or with nonimmune serum. These data indicate that the renaturable 69- and 63-kDa kinases are Paks and reveal some of the upstream events that are necessary for the rapid activation of this family of protein kinases in neutrophils."

The proteolytic activity for degradation of topoisomerase IIα was suppressed specifically by inhibitors for the proteasome and was much reduced in the 42-h extract prepared from MA1-derivative cell lines expressing E1B19k or Bcl-2. The proteolytic activity was lost after fractionation of the 42-h S10 extract into the S70 and P70 fractions by centrifugation at 70,000 × g for 6 h but partially recovered when these fractions were combined. Polyubiquitinated forms of topoisomerase IIα could be detected by incubating it in the S70 or S100 extract, which lacks most of the proteasome activity.

In all of these cases, it has been argued that the mutations would lead to increased Aβ deposition in the brain in a manner sufficient to cause AD.

Raising intracellular calcium can, according to the experimental conditions, either inhibit or dramatically stimulate Aβ formation (15Querfurth H.W. Selkoe D.J.

The mechanisms by which these various signal transduction cascades are able to regulate Aβ formation are currently unknown. The availability of a cell-free system in which to study Aβ formation would greatly facilitate the understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved. We made use of a Balch homogenizer to prepare cracked cells (17Martin T.F.J. Walent J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10299-10308Google Scholar). Aβ production in these broken cell preparations was found to depend on ATP and temperature. By introducing purified PKC, a peptide inhibitor of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin, or a calmodulin antagonist (W-7 or trifluoperazine), it was demonstrated that PKC and calcineurin regulate Aβ formation. A role for calmodulin and calcineurin in the regulation of Aβ formation was confirmed in intact cells by the use of cell-permeant inhibitors. The results suggest that PKC and calcineurin bidirectionally regulate Aβ formation, possibly via regulation of phosphorylation of a single substrate. Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) (from LC Services Corp., prepared as a 1 mM stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide), W-7 (from Sigma, 10 mM in deionized H2O), trifluoperazine (from Calbiochem, 5 mM in deionized H2O), cyclosporin A (a generous gift from Drs. G. Snyder and F. Gorelick, 3 mM in dimethyl sulfoxide), calyculin A (from LC Laboratories, 100 μM in dimethyl sulfoxide), and calpain inhibitor I (from Calbiochem, 5 mg/ml in ethanol), were diluted to the indicated final concentrations immediately before use. PKC was purified as described (18Woodgett J.R. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4836-4843Google Scholar). Synthetic peptide, corresponding to human Aβ1-40, was used as an immunogen to produce precipitating Aβ antibodies in rabbits. One of the antisera (3134) was affinity-purified by making use of a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 22-41 of human Aβ. The affinity-purified antiserum (3134C), which maps to the carboxyl-terminal domain of Aβ (residues 32-40 2F. Lindqvist and C. Nordstedt, unpublished data. ) and does not recognize secreted APP (sAPP), was used for the ELISA assays. The second antiserum (3129) immunoprecipitated full-length APP and sAPP, as well as Aβ. This antibody, which does not cross-react with amyloid precursor-like proteins 1 or 2 because of the absence of Aβ domain (1Sisodia S.S. Price D.L. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 366-370Google Scholar), was used for immunoblot analysis of sAPP. In order to study the regulation of Aβ formation in a cell-free system, a sandwich ELISA was developed. This ELISA makes use of both 3134C as a capture antibody and the monoclonal antibody 6E10 (obtained from Drs. K. S. Kim and H. M. Wisniewski, New York), which is specific for the amino-terminal part of human Aβ, as a detection antibody (Fig. 1A). 96-well plates (Nunclon, Maxisorp) were coated for 2 h at 37°C with 10 μg/ml 3134C in 10 mM carbonate buffer, pH 8.4. Unoccupied binding sites were then blocked with PBS (1 mM KH2PO4, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, pH 7.4) containing 1% casein, 0.05% Tween 20, and 0.02% NaN3. Plates were washed three times in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, 0.02% NaN3 (PBSTA). Test samples (100 μl) were incubated overnight at 4°C. Subsequently, plates were washed three times in PBSTA, incubated for 2 h with 1-3 μg/ml 6E10 antibody in PBSTA, washed again, and incubated for 1 h with alkaline phosphatase-linked anti-mouse-IgG1 (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc.). After three washes in PBSTA, Attophos solution (JBL Scientific, Inc.) was added, and the alkaline phosphatase product was analyzed in a fluorometric plate reader (Millipore Corp.). The ELISA accurately detected >50 pg/ml Aβ, using synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 1-40 of human Aβ as a standard (Fig. 1B). In some experiments, Aβ was analyzed in conditioned medium from 35S-labeled cells, using both immunoprecipitation of Aβ and the sandwich ELISA. We compared the levels of Aβ in medium derived from CHO cells expressing wild-type human APP (APPwt) or a mutated (K670N; M671L; numbering as for APP 770 transcript) form of APP (APPsw) corresponding to that found in a Swedish kindred (19Mullan M. Crawford F. Axelman K. Houlden H. Lilius L. Winblad B. Lannfelt L. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 345-347Google Scholar). An approximately 5-fold increase in Aβ secretion in medium from the cells expressing APPsw, relative to APPwt, was observed with either method (Fig. 1C). Thus, the ELISA accurately detects Aβ in complex biological samples. Monolayers of cells expressing APP were washed once in PBS, resuspended in PBS, 5 mM EDTA, centrifuged, washed again in PBS, and resuspended in Buffer H (250 mM sucrose, 15 mM HEPES, pH 7.3, 1 mM magnesium acetate, 1 mM EDTA) to a final concentration of 2 × 107 cells/ml. Cells were then passed once through a 0.0004-inch clearance Balch homogenizer (made by H & Y Enterprise) using a tungsten-carbide ball (Industrial Techtonics). Under these conditions, 99.7 ± 0.2% (n = 4) of the cells were trypan blue permeant while still pelleting at 800 × g. These cells, referred to as cracked cells, were incubated (107 cells/ml) at the indicated temperatures in the presence of 2.5 mM magnesium acetate, 20 mM KCl, 0.1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol. Energy-depleting (3 mM glucose, 30 units/ml hexokinase) or energy-generating (1 mM ATP, 1 mM GTP, 6 mM phosphocreatine, 80 μg/ml phosphocreatine kinase) systems were included in the incubation medium, as indicated. After incubation for the indicated times, cells were chilled on ice and centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 10 min. A buffer solution containing PBS (10 ×), 0.5% Tween, 0.02% NaN3, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 μg/ml pepstatin, 20 μg/ml trasylol, 1 mM 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride was then added to the supernatant, and Aβ was detected using the sandwich ELISA. Cracked cell preparations were able to produce ≈10% of the Aβ secreted by intact cells. In contrast, production of sAPP was almost abolished in cracked cells (<2% of that produced by intact cells) and was not detectably affected by PKC (data not shown). Thus, in all reported experiments with broken cell preparations, only Aβ formation was studied. Some experiments were carried out with the addition of 100 μM GTPγS (in place of GTP), 2 mM chloroquine, 1 mM N-ethylmaleimide, or 10 μg/ml calpain inhibitor I. To study the effect of N-ethylmaleimide, cracked cells were preincubated for 15 min on ice in the presence of 1 mM N-ethylmaleimide, followed by the addition of 2 mM dithiothreitol to quench N-ethylmaleimide. Control preincubations were performed by adding dithiothreitol together with N-ethylmaleimide, as described (20Beckers C.J. Block M.R. Glick B.S. Rothman J.E. Balch W.E. Nature. 1989; 339: 397-398Google Scholar). Cracked cells (2 × 107 cells/ml) were centrifuged for 5 min at 1,300 × g at 4°C. After removal of the postnuclear supernatant, the pellet was gently resuspended in ice-cold Buffer H, and incubated for 5 min. This process was repeated three times. After the final resuspension, the cell ghosts were incubated for 15 min at 4°C before constitution with pretreated postnuclear supernatant. The reconstituted system had about 75% of the Aβ forming activity of the cracked cell preparation (not shown). Aβ formation in cracked cells was dependent on temperature, with little Aβ measured at 4°C compared with the amounts formed at 37°C (Fig. 2A). Aβ formation was also dependent on the inclusion of ATP and an ATP-regenerating system (Fig. 2A). Formation of Aβ in cracked cells expressing APPsw or APPwt was linear with time for 30 min, reaching a plateau at about 60 min (not shown). Cracked cells expressing APPsw produced significantly more Aβ than cracked cells expressing APPwt (Fig. 2A), consistent with results observed in intact cells (Fig. 1C). Since the levels of Aβ formed in cracked cells expressing APPwt were near the limit of detection of the ELISA, we used cells expressing APPsw in additional broken cell studies. The Aβ formed was not precipitated during centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h (not shown), indicating that we measured a soluble form of the peptide. As expected from results obtained in intact cells (21Klafki H.-W. Paganetti P.A. Sommer B. Staufenbiel M. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 201: 29-32Google Scholar), the formation of Aβ was strongly inhibited by the addition of 10 μg/ml calpain inhibitor I (28 ± 6% of control, n = 5, p < 0.01), demonstrating that Aβ observed in cracked cells is the result of the cleavage of APP occurring during the incubation period. Aβ formation was not affected by substituting a non-hydrolyzable analog of GTP (GTPγS) for GTP (107 ± 11% of control, n = 4), suggesting that no G-protein was involved in the formation of Aβ in this system. The addition of chloroquine, a weak base that increases the pH of lysosomes and impairs the activity of lysosomal enzymes (see 22Caporaso G.L. Gandy S.E. Buxbaum J.D. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2252-2256Google Scholar), did not cause a significant change in Aβ production (94 ± 4% of control, n = 3). The alkylating agent N-ethylmaleimide partially inhibited Aβ formation (71 ± 9% of control, n = 5, p < 0.05), suggesting the involvement of a free sulfhydryl group in Aβ production. For this reason, 1 mM dithiothreitol was present in the standard incubation buffer of the cracked cells. To confirm the identity of the protein detected by the sandwich ELISA, we labeled cells expressing APPsw with [35S]methionine. Subsequently, the cells were cracked and incubated under various conditions, and Aβ was allowed to accumulate in the medium. The Aβ from the conditioned medium was then analyzed by immunoprecipitation with 6E10 or 3134C, followed by gel electrophoresis and autoradiography (Fig. 2B). A band with an apparent molecular mass of 4 kDa was present in immunoprecipitates from cracked cells incubated at 37°C in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system. This peptide could be precipitated with either of the two antibodies, and its immunoprecipitation was largely prevented by the addition of excess synthetic Aβ1-40 peptide (Fig. 2B). Since stimulation of PKC by PDBu inhibits Aβ secretion in intact CHO cells (12Buxbaum J.D. Koo E.H. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9195-9198Google Scholar), the effect of purified PKC was tested on Aβ formation in the cell-free preparation. Cell ghosts were incubated with postnuclear supernatant that had been preincubated in the presence or absence of PDBu and various concentrations of purified PKC. PDBu alone led to a small but significant inhibitory effect on Aβ formation, presumably due to the activation of endogenous PKC (Fig. 3). Preincubation with PKC in the presence of PDBu dramatically reduced Aβ formation. Inhibition of Aβ formation was also observed when PDBu/PKC was added to cracked cells although this inhibition was somewhat smaller than that observed in the reconstituted system (data not shown). Under the experimental conditions used, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, casein kinase 1, and casein kinase 2 had no effect on Aβ formation using either cracked cells or the reconstituted system (data not shown). Since Aβ formation in the cell-free system was regulated by PKC, we investigated the identity of the protein phosphatases involved in this system. Calyculin A (100 nM), a specific inhibitor of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A (IC50≈ 0.1 nM), inhibited Aβ secretion in intact cells (data not shown). In contrast, calyculin A had no effect on Aβ formation in cracked cells either in the presence or absence of PDBu/PKC (Fig. 4). A third major serine/threonine protein phosphatase, protein phosphatase 2B (calcineurin), is a calcium/calmodulin-activated enzyme. The addition of the calmodulin antagonists W-7 and trifluoperazine, which would be expected to inhibit calcineurin activation, inhibited Aβ formation and augmented the inhibitory effects of PKC on Aβ formation in cell ghosts (Fig. 5). Moreover, preincubation with 50 μM calcineurin-inhibitory peptide (23Hashimoto Y. Perrino B.A. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1924-1927Google Scholar) also inhibited Aβ formation and enhanced the inhibitory effect of PKC (Fig. 4).Fig. 5Effect of calmodulin inhibitors on Aβ formation in broken cell preparations. Cell ghosts expressing APPsw were incubated for 30 min at 37°C with postnuclear supernatant that had been preincubated for 30 min in the absence or presence of PDBu (1 μM)/PKC (3 μg/ml), W-7 (50 μM), or trifluoperazine (TFP, 25 μM), as indicated. Data are expressed as percentage of Aβ formation in the absence of any addition and as means ± S.E. of three experiments. Statistical analysis used an ANOVA test (F5,12 = 10.195; p = 0.0005) followed by a Fisher's protected least significant difference test (**, p < 0.01 compared with the control conditions in the absence of treatment; ††, p < 0.01 and †, p < 0.02 compared with the control conditions in the presence of PDBu/PKC alone).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To assess whether calmodulin and calcineurin also regulate Aβ secretion in intact cells, cells expressing APPwt were incubated in the absence or presence of PDBu, W-7, trifluoperazine, or cyclosporin A (a specific cell-permeant inhibitor of calcineurin) (24Liu J. Farmer J.D.J. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Google Scholar). W-7 and trifluoperazine inhibited the secretion of Aβ from intact cells and potentiated the inhibitory effect of PDBu on Aβ formation (Fig. 6). Cyclosporin A had no effect on the basal secretion of Aβ but potentiated the inhibitory effect of PDBu (Fig. 7). On the other hand, calmodulin antagonists (Fig. 6) and cyclosporin A (Fig. 7) had no discernible effect on sAPP secretion in the absence or presence of PDBu. These results indicate that in intact cells PKC regulates both Aβ and sAPP formation, whereas calcineurin regulates only Aβ formation.Fig. 7Effect of cyclosporin A, a calcineurin inhibitor, on Aβ and sAPP formation in intact cells. Intact cells expressing APPwt were incubated in Opti-MEM for 60 min at 37°C in the absence or presence of PDBu (1 μM) and cyclosporin A (1.5 μM). Aβ (panel A) and sAPP (panel B) secreted in the culture medium were quantified by ELISA and immunoblotting, respectively. Data are expressed as means ± S.E. of three experiments carried out in triplicate. Statistical analysis used an ANOVA test (F3,8 = 14.807; p = 0.0013) followed by a Fisher's protected least significant difference test (*, p < 0.03 compared with PDBu alone). Similar results were obtained using cells expressing APPsw (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) One limitation in studying processing and secretion of proteins from intact cells is the difficulty of elucidating the molecular processes involved. In order to better understand the mechanism of action of signal transduction pathways that regulate Aβ secretion, we have developed a cell-free system capable of producing Aβ. Since Aβ formation in intact cells requires both cleavage and secretion steps, we made use of a cell-free system that keeps most of the cytoplasmic ultrastructure and the secretory apparatus intact. This procedure, termed “cell cracking,” was originally developed to preserve the machinery necessary for studying the release of secretory proteins and prolactin from GH3 pituitary cells (17Martin T.F.J. Walent J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10299-10308Google Scholar). Our results support the conclusion that Aβ is generated by cracked cells, as opposed to residual intact cells for the following reasons: 1) the dependence of Aβ formation on ATP which, when applied extracellularly, has no effect on Aβ formation in intact CHO cells (16Buxbaum J.D. Ruefli A.A. Parker C.A. Cypess A.M. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4489-4493Google Scholar); 2) the effect of the cell-impermeant molecules PKC and the calcineurin-inhibitory peptide on Aβ secretion; and 3) the level of Aβ formed (≈10% of that seen in intact cells) compared with the percentage of cells that remained intact (0.3 ± 0.2%). In agreement with results observed in intact cells, there was much more Aβ produced by cracked cells expressing APPsw as compared with cells expressing APPwt. In fact, it was difficult to detect Aβ formation in cracked cells expressing APPwt, even when using a sensitive sandwich ELISA. For this reason, most broken cell experiments were done with cells expressing APPsw. The question arises as to the relevance of results obtained with these cells for the study of APPwt processing. In experiments in which the two types of transfected cells were compared, they behaved similarly (25Perez R.G. Squazzo S.L. Koo E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9100-9107Google Scholar). In cell-free preparations, Aβ formation from both APPwt and APPsw was temperature- and energy-dependent. Moreover, the involvement of calmodulin and calcineurin in Aβ formation, observed in cracked cells expressing APPsw, was confirmed in intact cells expressing either APPwt or APPsw. It will be important to establish whether the regulation of APP processing and Aβ secretion established in CHO cells is also observed in cells derived from the brain (e.g. neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes). There is a large and conflicting literature concerning the subcellular localization of the machinery responsible for Aβ formation. Hopefully, the development of cell-free preparations, such as the cracked cell preparation in which Aβ secretion is regulated by the same factors that had been found to regulate Aβ secretion in intact cells, will help to resolve this issue. The present results suggest the existence of a phosphoprotein that stimulates Aβ formation. Identification of this protein and determination of its subcellular site of action should help to clarify the locus of Aβ formation. Stimulation of PKC (12Buxbaum J.D. Koo E.H. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9195-9198Google Scholar, 13Gabuzda D. Busciglio J. Yankner B.A. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 2326-2329Google Scholar, 14Hung A.Y. Haass C. Nitsch R.M. Qiu W.Q.

A. 1993; 90: 9195-9198Google Scholar, 14Hung A.Y. Haass C. Nitsch R.M. Qiu W.Q. Citron M. Wurtman R.J. Growdon J.H. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22959-22962Google Scholar) strongly stimulate sAPP secretion and inhibit Aβ formation in intact cells. It was hypothesized that inhibition of the conversion of APP to Aβ might be attributable at least in part to depletion of substrate resulting from activation of the sAPP metabolic pathway (12Buxbaum J.D. Koo E.H. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9195-9198Google Scholar, 26Jacobsen J.S. Spruyt M.A. Brown A.M. Sahasrabudhe S.R. Blume A.J. Vitek M.P. Muenkel H.A. Sonnenberg-Reines J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8376-8382Google Scholar). In the broken cell preparation used in the present investigation, PKC dramatically inhibited Aβ formation while having no detectable effect on sAPP secretion. These results provide evidence that PKC, in addition to a possible effect on substrate level, has an inhibitory effect on the conversion of APP to Aβ. In addition, calcineurin had no effect on sAPP formation but regulated Aβ formation, both in broken cells and in intact cells. Thus, the effects of calcineurin on Aβ formation appear to be independent of substrate depletion resulting from activation of the sAPP metabolic pathway. The loss of regulation by protein phosphatases 1 or 2A of Aβ formation in broken cell preparations is consistent with the substrate depletion hypothesis: the inhibition of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A in intact cells would inhibit Aβ formation solely by increasing sAPP formation. The identification of calcineurin as a major protein phosphatase involved in the regulation of Aβ formation suggests that perturbations of neuronal calcium homeostasis, hypothesized to play an important role in AD (see 27Khachaturian Z.S. Corman C.W. Pettegrew J.W. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1989; 568: 1-192Google Scholar), might be mediated partially through calcineurin. Our data are consistent with a model in which PKC and calcineurin, but not protein phosphatase 1 or 2A, can regulate the conversion of APP to Aβ through a mechanism independent of alteration of substrate level. On the other hand, PKC and protein phosphatase 1 or 2A (mainly protein phosphatase 1 (28da Cruz e Silva E.F. da Cruz e Silva O.A.B. Zaia C.T.B.V. Greengard P. Mol. Med. 1995; 1: 535-541Google Scholar)), but not calcineurin, regulate the conversion of APP to sAPP. Interestingly, it has recently been shown that a dominant negative mutant of Rab6 affects sAPP, but not Aβ, secretion, thus providing independent evidence that sAPP and Aβ are derived from distinct metabolic pathways (29McConlogue L. Castellano F. deWit C. Schenk D. Maltese W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1343-1348Google Scholar). The increasing evidence for such distinct pathways increases the likelihood of developing therapeutic agents capable of inhibiting Aβ formation without affecting sAPP secretion. We thank Drs. F.

https://openalex.org/W1975901799,"We have previously described a tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) response element, located between residues −188 and −140 of the human decorin promoter, that mediates the inhibitory effect of TNF-α on decorin gene expression (Mauviel, A., Santra, M., Chen, Y.-Q., Uitto, J., and Iozzo, R. V. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 11692-11700). In this report, we demonstrate that interleukin 1 (IL-1), a pleiotropic cytokine that shares a wide variety of biological properties with TNF-α, uses the same cis element to up-regulate decorin gene expression. Specifically, IL-1 enhances the expression of the human decorin gene, and this effect is mediated by activation of the corresponding promoter, as shown in transient cell transfection experiments using decorin promoter-chloramphenicol acetyl transferase reporter gene constructs. Additional transfection experiments with various 5′-deletion promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs demonstrate that both the inhibitory effect of TNF-α and the stimulatory effect of IL-1 are mediated by a 48-base pair segment of the promoter, between residues −188 and −140. This region, which contains a canonical AP-1 binding site, TGAGTCA, allows an antagonistic effect of these two cytokines on the decorin promoter activity. When cloned upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter, this promoter fragment requires the AP-1 sequence to be responsive to IL-1. Supershift assays with various AP-1 antibodies identified c-Jun, Jun-B, and Fra-1 as components of the complex binding to the decorin promoter. Overexpression of c-jun, an oncogene encoding the c-Jun/AP-1 transcription factor, reduces the basal activity of both decorin and −188/−140 thymidine kinase promoter constructs. In contrast, blockage of c-jun expression with an antisense c-jun construct potentiates the stimulatory effect of IL-1 and reverses the response to TNF-α. These data indicate that the region between residues −188 and −140 of the human decorin promoter functions as a bimodal regulatory element and allows transcriptional repression by c-Jun/AP-1 complexes.

(1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 19778-19785). We hypothesized that this phenotype might reflect the function of murine α2M (mα2M) as a neutralizer of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and inducer of nitric oxide synthesis in vivo. When incubated with wild-type mouse plasma, TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 bound only to mα2M. Alternative TGF-β-binding proteins were not detected in plasma from α2M(−/−) mice. Wild-type mouse plasma, but not plasma from α2M(−/−) mice, inhibited TGF-β1 binding to TGF-β receptors on fibroblasts. Purified mα2M bound TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 with similar affinity; the KD values were 28 ± 4 and 33 ± 4 nM, respectively. Murinoglobulin, the second murine α-macroglobulin, bound both TGF-β isoforms with 30-fold lower affinity. Mα2M counteracted the activities of TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 in an endothelial cell growth assay. Mα2M also induced NO synthesis when incubated with RAW 264.7 cells, an activity which probably results from the neutralization of autocrine TGF-β activity. Human α2M induced NO synthesis comparably to mα2M; however, MUG had no effect. These studies demonstrate that the ability to neutralize TGF-β is a property of mα2M, which is not redundant in the murine α-macroglobulin family or in murine plasma. Mα2M is the only murine α-macroglobulin that promotes NO synthesis. The absence of mα2M, in α2M(−/−) mice, may allow TGF-β to more efficiently suppress excessive iNOS expression following endotoxin challenge. α2-Macroglobulin null mice demonstrate increased resistance to endotoxin challenge (Umans, L., Serneels, L., Overbergh, L., Van Leuven, F., and Van den Berghe, H.

INTRODUCTIONBacterial endotoxin is a lipopolysaccharide complex derived from the outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria and a major mediator of the pathophysiologic changes referred to as septic shock (1Raetz C.R.H. Ulevitch R.J. Wright S.D. Sibley C.H. Ding A. Nathan C.F. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2652-2660Google Scholar, 2Parrillo J.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 1471-1477Google Scholar). Endotoxin triggers release of inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β, from a number of cell types, including macrophages and endothelial cells (1Raetz C.R.H.

These cytokines, in addition to endotoxin, induce increased cellular synthesis of nitric oxide (4Nathan C. Xie Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13725-13728Google Scholar, 5Wolfe T.A. Dasta J.F. Ann.

Vane J.R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 108: 786-792Google Scholar).NO is produced by three enzymes of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) family (4Nathan C. Xie Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13725-13728Google Scholar, 10Nathan C. Xie Q.-W. Cell. 1994; 78: 915-918Google Scholar). Two constitutive forms of NOS (NOS-I, NOS-III) produce low levels of NO in response to agonists which increase intracellular calcium. The resulting NO is important in the regulation of normal homeostatic processes, including blood pressure and neuronal transmission (10Nathan C. Xie Q.-W. Cell. 1994; 78: 915-918Google Scholar). The inducible form of NOS (iNOS or NOS-II) produces high levels of NO, independently of intracellular calcium. The NO produced by iNOS functions in the immune response to pathogens and may also provide cytotoxic activity toward cancer cells (10Nathan C. Xie Q.-W. Cell. 1994; 78: 915-918Google Scholar). Since iNOS activity is not calcium-dependent, regulation of iNOS expression is critical and many cytokines are involved in this process in various cell types (11De Vera M.E. Shapiro R.A. Nussler A.K. Mudgett J.S. Simmons R.L. Morris S.M. Billiar T.R. Geller D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1054-1059Google Scholar).Intravenous administration of endotoxin in experimental animals causes an initial, transient increase in NO that is probably due to stimulation of constitutive NOS followed by a sustained increase in NO produced by iNOS (8Petros A. Lamb G. Leone A. Moncada S. Bennett D. Vallance P. Cardiovasc. Res. 1994; 28: 34-39Google Scholar). Mice that are iNOS-deficient, due to gene disruption in embryonic stem cells, demonstrate resistance to doses of endotoxin that are lethal in wild-type animals (12MacMicking J.D. Nathan C. Hom G.

Huang F.P. Xu D. Muller W. Moncada S. Liew F.Y. Nature. 1995; 375: 408-411Google Scholar). iNOS(−/−) mice are also less effective at eliminating infections caused by Listeria monocytogenes or Leishmania major. Macrophages that are isolated from iNOS(−/−) mice are less effective killers of cancer cells in vitro (12MacMicking J.D. Nathan C. Hom G. Chartrain N. Fletcher D.S. Trumbauer M. Stevens K. Xie Q.-W. Sokol K. Hutchinson N. Chin H. Mudgett J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 641-650Google Scholar).Human α2-macroglobulin (hα2M) is a proteinase inhibitor and specific cytokine carrier that induces iNOS expression and NO synthesis in the murine macrophage-like cell line, RAW 264.7 (14Lysiak J.J. Hussaini I.M. Webb D.J. Glass II, W.F. Allietta M. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21919-21927Google Scholar). The mechanism of iNOS induction involves the neutralization of autocrine cytokine activity by hα2M. Since RAW 264.7 cells synthesize, secrete, and activate transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and because TGF-β-neutralizing antibody induces RAW 264.7 cell NO synthesis, similarly to hα2M, we proposed that neutralization of autocrine TGF-β is most likely responsible for the increase in iNOS expression in hα2M-treated RAW 264.7 cells (14Lysiak J.J. Hussaini I.M. Webb D.J. Glass II, W.F. Allietta M. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21919-21927Google Scholar).Hα2M exists in at least two well defined conformations (15Barrett A.J. Starkey P.M. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 709-724Google Scholar, 16Gonias S.L. Reynolds J.A. Pizzo S.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 705: 306-314Google Scholar). The native form is active as a proteinase inhibitor, but not recognized by the α2M receptor, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) (17Pizzo S.V. Gonias S.L. Conn P.M. The Receptors. Academic Press, Inc., New York1984: 177Google Scholar). Thus, native α2M is stable in the blood and interstitial spaces. The activated form of α2M, generated by reaction with proteinase, is LRP-recognized. In the RAW 264.7 cell system, native α2M and activated α2M are comparably effective as inducers of NO synthesis (14Lysiak J.J. Hussaini I.M. Webb D.J. Glass II, W.F. Allietta M. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21919-21927Google Scholar).The murine α-macroglobulin family includes at least five distinct genes, two of which encode for proteins that have been purified and characterized (18Overbergh L. Torrekens S. Van Leuven F. Van den Berghe H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16903-16910Google Scholar, 19Van Leuven F. Torrekens S. Overbergh L. Lorent K. De Strooper B. Van den Berghe H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 319-327Google Scholar, 20Overbergh L. Hilliker C. Lorent K. Van Leuven F. Van den Berghe F. Genomics. 1994; 22: 530-539Google Scholar). Murine α2M (mα2M) is a tetrameric protein (Mr ~ 720,000) and a close homologue of human α2M. Hα2M and mα2M share comparably broad proteinase-inhibitory specificities and undergo equivalent proteinase-induced conformational changes. The second member of the murine α-macroglobulin family is murinoglobulin (MUG), a single chain (Mr ~ 180,000) proteinase inhibitor which, like mα2M, is found at high concentrations (1 mg/ml) in adult murine plasma (21Saito A. Sinohara H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 775-781Google Scholar, 22Abe K. Yamamoto K. Sinohara H. J. Biochem. 1989; 106: 564-568Google Scholar).Umans et al. (23Umans L. Serneels L. Overbergh L. Lorent K. Van Leuven F. Van den Berghe H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19778-19785Google Scholar) recently reported disruption of the mα2M gene in embryonic stem cells and the generation of homozygous α2M-deficient mice. The α2M(−/−) mice developed normally and were fertile; however, these mice responded differently from wild-type animals when challenged with certain exogenous agents. α2M(−/−) mice showed increased resistance to the lethal effects of endotoxin. We hypothesized that the endotoxin resistance of the α2M(−/−) mice might be related to the in vitro observations that hα2M neutralizes TGF-β and induces iNOS expression (14Lysiak J.J. Hussaini I.M. Webb D.J. Glass II, W.F. Allietta M. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21919-21927Google Scholar). TGF-β suppresses expression of a number of genes associated with inflammatory reactions, including iNOS (24Vodovotz Y. Bogdan C. Paik J. Xie Q.-W. Nathan C.F. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 605-613Google Scholar, 25Perrella M.A. Yoshizumi M. Fen Z. Tsai J.-C. Hsieh C.-M. Kourembanas S. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14595-14600Google Scholar). If neutralization of TGF-β at sites of inflammation is an important function of α2M, then mα2M deficiency would allow endogenous TGF-β to function more effectively in protecting against excessive iNOS induction following endotoxin challenge.Levels of MUG in the plasma of non-pregnant α2M(−/−) mice are unchanged compared with wild-type animals (23Umans L. Serneels L. Overbergh L. Lorent K. Van Leuven F. Van den Berghe H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19778-19785Google Scholar), raising the question of whether MUG and mα2M are redundant as TGF-β neutralizers or NO inducers. The goals of this study were to: (i) compare the binding and neutralization of TGF-β by proteins from wild-type and α2M(−/−) mouse plasma; (ii) characterize the binding of TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 to purified mα2M and MUG; and (iii) determine whether mα2M and/or MUG promote macrophage NO synthesis. Our results demonstrate that mα2M is unique among murine α-macroglobulins, and murine plasma proteins in general, since mα2M is the only major protein that binds TGF-β and inhibits TGF-β-receptor interactions. Purified mα2M neutralized TGF-β in endothelial cell growth assays and promoted macrophage NO synthesis, while purified MUG was inactive in both cell culture systems. These studies identify TGF-β neutralization as a non-redundant activity of mα2M and suggest a mechanism for the endotoxin insensitive phenotype of α2M(−/−) mice.DISCUSSIONTGF-β functions within the context of autocrine pathways to regulate many of the properties of cells in culture, especially when the culture medium is not serum-supplemented. In colon carcinoma cells, autocrine TGF-β increases integrin α5 gene expression (44Wang D. Zhou G. Birkenmeier T.M. Gong J. Sun L. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14154-14159Google Scholar); in rat VSMCs, autocrine TGF-β suppresses platelet-derived growth factor α-receptor expression (45Weaver A.M. Owens G.K. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30741-30748Google Scholar) and in RAW 264.7 cells, autocrine TGF-β suppresses iNOS expression (14Lysiak J.J. Hussaini I.M. Webb D.J. Glass II, W.F. Allietta M. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21919-21927Google Scholar). In each of these studies, the importance of autocrine TGF-β was demonstrated using a pan-isoform TGF-β-neutralizing antibody (14Lysiak J.J. Hussaini I.M. Webb D.J. Glass II, W.F. Allietta M. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21919-21927Google Scholar, 45Weaver A.M. Owens G.K. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30741-30748Google Scholar) or a constitutively expressed TGF-β antisense cDNA construct (46Wu S. Theodorescu D. Kerbel R.S. Willson J.K.V. Mulder K.M. Humphrey L.E. Brattain M.G. J. Cell Bio. 1992; 116: 187-196Google Scholar). Hα2M binds a number of cytokines (34Crookston K.P. Webb D.J. Wolf B.B. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1533-1540Google Scholar); however, in the absence of exogenously added cytokines, many of the activities of hα2M in cell culture may be attributed to specific neutralization of TGF-β (14Lysiak J.J. Hussaini I.M. Webb D.J. Glass II, W.F. Allietta M. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21919-21927Google Scholar, 45Weaver A.M. Owens G.K. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30741-30748Google Scholar). Whether α-macroglobulins counteract TGF-β activity in vivo is undetermined.Gene knock-out experiments in mice have demonstrated that TGF-β1 functions in vivo to provide homeostatic suppression of immune/inflammatory responses (47Kulkarni A.B. Huh C.-G. Becker D. Geiser A. Lyght M. Flanders K.C. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Ward J.M. Karlsson S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 770-774Google Scholar). Endotoxin challenge causes a form of inflammatory response which can be lethal. iNOS(−/−) mice are insensitive to endotoxin challenge (12MacMicking J.D. Nathan C. Hom G. Chartrain N. Fletcher D.S. Trumbauer M. Stevens K. Xie Q.-W. Sokol K. Hutchinson N. Chin H. Mudgett J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 641-650Google Scholar), reflecting the important role played by iNOS in mediating endotoxin-associated shock (5Wolfe T.A. Dasta J.F. Ann. Pharmacother. 1995; 29: 36-46Google Scholar, 6Kilbourn R.G. Gross S.S. Jubran A. Adams J. Griffith O.W. Levi R. Lodato R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3629-3632Google Scholar, 7Cunha F.Q. Assreuy J. Moss D.W. Rees D. Leal L.M.C. Moncada S. Carrier M. O'Donnell C.A. Liew F.Y. Immunology. 1994; 81: 211-215Google Scholar, 8Petros A. Lamb G. Leone A. Moncada S. Bennett D. Vallance P. Cardiovasc. Res. 1994; 28: 34-39Google Scholar, 9Szabo C. Mitchell J.A. Thiemermann C. Vane J.R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 108: 786-792Google Scholar). Since α2M(−/−) mice also demonstrate decreased sensitivity to endotoxin (23Umans L. Serneels L. Overbergh L. Lorent K. Van Leuven F. Van den Berghe H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19778-19785Google Scholar), we decided to examine the effects of the murine α-macroglobulins on TGF-β activity and iNOS activity. Although normal murine plasma has two major members of the α-macroglobulin family, only mα2M binds TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 with significant affinity. Murine α2M, but not MUG, inhibits TGF-β binding to its cellular receptors and the biological response of FBHE cells to TGF-β. Furthermore, among the murine α-macroglobulins, only mα2M induces macrophage NO synthesis. Thus, while the proteinase-inhibitory specificities of mα2M and MUG are at least partially redundant, the growth factor-carrier activities of these two proteins are not. In α2M(−/−) mice, MUG is expressed at normal levels and, during pregnancy, at increased levels (23Umans L. Serneels L. Overbergh L. Lorent K. Van Leuven F. Van den Berghe H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19778-19785Google Scholar); however, as shown with in vitro experiments in Fig. 1, Fig. 2, neither this protein nor any other protein in mα2M-deficient plasma substitutes for mα2M as a TGF-β carrier and neutralizer. The studies described here suggest that mα2M, in wild-type mice, may counteract TGF-β locally, at sites of inflammation, and thereby permit augmented iNOS expression in response to endotoxin. Further in vivo testing is warranted to test this hypothesis.Our analysis of NO synthesis was performed using RAW 264.7 cells. Although this is a passaged cell line, RAW 264.7 cells demonstrate excellent conservation of differentiated macrophage properties and can be primed/activated for tumorcidal and bacteriocidal activity, similarly to primary cultures of macrophages (48Haak-Frendscho M. Wynn T.A. Czuprynski C.J. Paulnock D. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1990; 82: 404-410Google Scholar, 49Lambert L.E. Paulnock D.M. Cell. Immunol. 1989; 120: 401-418Google Scholar). Human macrophages, like the RAW 264.7 cells, secrete TGF-β (50Assoian R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6020-6024Google Scholar) which functions as a potent inhibitor of human macrophage activation (51Bermudez L.E. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1838-1845Google Scholar, 52Randow F. Syrbe U. Meisel C. Krausch D. Zuckerman H. Platzer C. Volk H.-D. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1887-1892Google Scholar). Thus, RAW 264.7 cells provide an accurate and reproducible model for studying the responses of normal macrophages.Danielpour and Sporn (41Danielpour D. Sporn M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6973-6977Google Scholar) performed experiments with serum and α2M, purified from human and bovine plasma, to demonstrate selective binding of TGF-β2, compared with TGF-β1. The KD for TGF-β1 binding to native hα2M is 30-fold higher than the KD for the TGF-β2/native hα2M interaction (34Crookston K.P. Webb D.J. Wolf B.B. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1533-1540Google Scholar). Thus, the ability of mα2M to bind TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 with equal affinity is novel, compared with other characterized α-macroglobulins. In addition to mα2M and hα2M, we have also studied the binding of TGF-β1 to rat α1M, the constitutively synthesized homologue of hα2M, and to rat α2M, an acute-phase reactant (53Webb D.J. Crookston K.P. Figler N.F. LaMarre J. Gonias S.L. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 579-586Google Scholar). Based on these studies, we can rank order the α-macroglobulins according to their affinities for TGF-β1 as follows: mα2M > rat α2M > rat α1M > hα2M ≫ MUG.In our analysis of TGF-β interactions with mα2M and MUG, we focused on the native forms of each protein. Activated α-macroglobulins are rapidly taken up by cells that express LRP (17Pizzo S.V. Gonias S.L. Conn P.M. The Receptors. Academic Press, Inc., New York1984: 177Google Scholar, 31Gonias S.L. Balber A.E. Hubbard W.J. Pizzo S.V. Biochem. J. 1983; 209: 99-105Google Scholar). As a result, levels of activated α-macroglobulins are negligible in the plasma under most circumstances. In the pericellular spaces, higher concentrations of activated α-macroglobulins may accumulate unless the tissue includes cells that express LRP. One concern regarding our NO synthesis experiments was whether the RAW 264.7 cells might secrete sufficient levels of proteinases to convert the α-macroglobulins into activated forms during the 24-h incubation. We previously demonstrated that this does not occur in cultures of vascular smooth muscle cells (45Weaver A.M. Owens G.K. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30741-30748Google Scholar). To test for proteinase secretion, we incubated radiolabeled native hα2M with the RAW 264.7 cells for 24 h. The hα2M was then subjected to nondenaturing PAGE. We also measured cell-associated radioactivity and the amount of trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity in the medium. None of our tests revealed detectable conversion of hα2M into the activated conformation (results not shown). Thus, the induction of NO synthesis by native mα2M and hα2M does not occur subsequent to proteinase modification of these proteins.When challenged with bleomycin, the lungs of α2M(−/−) mice were not substantially affected while the lungs of wild-type mice developed inflammatory infiltrates and early connective tissue deposition (23Umans L. Serneels L. Overbergh L. Lorent K. Van Leuven F. Van den Berghe H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19778-19785Google Scholar). TGF-β, which is secreted by alveolar macrophages and activated locally, has been implicated in the regulation of this process (54Denholm E.M. Rollins S.M. Amer. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: L36-L42Google Scholar). It is intriguing to speculate that the α2M(−/−) mice are bleomycin tolerant due to enhanced function of TGF-β as a general anti-inflammatory; however, TGF-β may actually promote certain aspects of the bleomycin response, such as the deposition of extracellular matrix proteins (55Giri S.N. Hyde D.M. Hollinger M.A. Thorax. 1993; 48: 959-966Google Scholar). Understanding the relationship between TGF-β, α2M, the development of immune cell infiltrates, and fibrosis, will require further investigation.In addition to its ability to neutralize TGF-β locally, α2M serves as a major carrier of TGF-β in the plasma, delaying TGF-β clearance and providing a potential pool of reversibly bound active factor (56O'Connor-McCourt M. Wakefield L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14090-14099Google Scholar, 57Huang S.S. O'Grady P. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1535-1541Google Scholar, 58Crookston K.P. Webb D.J. LaMarre J. Gonias S.L. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 443-450Google Scholar). The unique and non-redundant activity of α2M as a TGF-β carrier in murine plasma suggests that TGF-β plasma pharmacokinetics may be altered in α2M(−/−) mice, in addition to TGF-β activity. In our cell culture systems, we have shown that mα2M induces iNOS activity in macrophages while MUG does not. These in vitro results provide a model for explaining some of the phenotypic properties of the α2M(−/−) mouse. INTRODUCTIONBacterial endotoxin is a lipopolysaccharide complex derived from the outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria and a major mediator of the pathophysiologic changes referred to as septic shock (1Raetz C.R.H. Ulevitch R.J. Wright S.D. Sibley C.H. Ding A. Nathan C.F. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2652-2660Google Scholar, 2Parrillo J.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 1471-1477Google Scholar). Endotoxin triggers release of inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β, from a number of cell types, including macrophages and endothelial cells (1Raetz C.R.H. Ulevitch R.J. Wright S.D. Sibley C.H. Ding A. Nathan C.F. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2652-2660Google Scholar, 3Burrell R. Circ. Shock. 1994; 43: 137-153Google Scholar). These cytokines, in addition to endotoxin, induce increased cellular synthesis of nitric oxide (4Nathan C. Xie Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13725-13728Google Scholar, 5Wolfe T.A. Dasta J.F. Ann.

Vane J.R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 108: 786-792Google Scholar).NO is produced by three enzymes of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) family (4Nathan C. Xie Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13725-13728Google Scholar, 10Nathan C. Xie Q.-W. Cell. 1994; 78: 915-918Google Scholar). Two constitutive forms of NOS (NOS-I, NOS-III) produce low levels of NO in response to agonists which increase intracellular calcium. The resulting NO is important in the regulation of normal homeostatic processes, including blood pressure and neuronal transmission (10Nathan C. Xie Q.-W. Cell. 1994; 78: 915-918Google Scholar). The inducible form of NOS (iNOS or NOS-II) produces high levels of NO, independently of intracellular calcium. The NO produced by iNOS functions in the immune response to pathogens and may also provide cytotoxic activity toward cancer cells (10Nathan C. Xie Q.-W. Cell. 1994; 78: 915-918Google Scholar). Since iNOS activity is not calcium-dependent, regulation of iNOS expression is critical and many cytokines are involved in this process in various cell types (11De Vera M.E. Shapiro R.A. Nussler A.K. Mudgett J.S. Simmons R.L. Morris S.M. Billiar T.R. Geller D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1054-1059Google Scholar).Intravenous administration of endotoxin in experimental animals causes an initial, transient increase in NO that is probably due to stimulation of constitutive NOS followed by a sustained increase in NO produced by iNOS (8Petros A. Lamb G. Leone A. Moncada S. Bennett D. Vallance P. Cardiovasc. Res. 1994; 28: 34-39Google Scholar). Mice that are iNOS-deficient, due to gene disruption in embryonic stem cells, demonstrate resistance to doses of endotoxin that are lethal in wild-type animals (12MacMicking J.D. Nathan C. Hom G. Chartrain N. Fletcher D.S. Trumbauer M. Stevens K. Xie Q.-W. Sokol K. Hutchinson N. Chin H. Mudgett J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 641-650Google Scholar, 13Wei X.Q. Charles I.G. Smith A. Ure J. Feng G.-J. Huang F.P. Xu D. Muller W. Moncada S. Liew F.Y. Nature. 1995; 375: 408-411Google Scholar). iNOS(−/−) mice are also less effective at eliminating infections caused by Listeria monocytogenes or Leishmania major. Macrophages that are isolated from iNOS(−/−) mice are less effective killers of cancer cells in vitro (12MacMicking J.D. Nathan C. Hom G. Chartrain N. Fletcher D.S. Trumbauer M. Stevens K. Xie Q.-W. Sokol K. Hutchinson N. Chin H. Mudgett J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 641-650Google Scholar).Human α2-macroglobulin (hα2M) is a proteinase inhibitor and specific cytokine carrier that induces iNOS expression and NO synthesis in the murine macrophage-like cell line, RAW 264.7 (14Lysiak J.J. Hussaini I.M. Webb D.J. Glass II, W.F. Allietta M. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21919-21927Google Scholar). The mechanism of iNOS induction involves the neutralization of autocrine cytokine activity by hα2M. Since RAW 264.7 cells synthesize, secrete, and activate transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and because TGF-β-neutralizing antibody induces RAW 264.7 cell NO synthesis, similarly to hα2M, we proposed that neutralization of autocrine TGF-β is most likely responsible for the increase in iNOS expression in hα2M-treated RAW 264.7 cells (14Lysiak J.J. Hussaini I.M. Webb D.J. Glass II, W.F. Allietta M. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21919-21927Google Scholar).Hα2M exists in at least two well defined conformations (15Barrett A.J. Starkey P.M. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 709-724Google Scholar, 16Gonias S.L. Reynolds J.A. Pizzo S.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 705: 306-314Google Scholar). The native form is active as a proteinase inhibitor, but not recognized by the α2M receptor, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) (17Pizzo S.V. Gonias S.L. Conn P.M. The Receptors. Academic Press, Inc., New York1984: 177Google Scholar). Thus,"
https://openalex.org/W2066639950,"Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) is a multifunctional receptor, expressed by vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in normal arteries and in atherosclerotic lesions. In this investigation, we demonstrate a novel mechanism for the regulation of LRP activity in cultured rat aortic VSMCs. Cells that were treated with platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) or epidermal growth factor (EGF) for 24 h bound increased amounts of the LRP ligand, activated α2-macroglobulin (α2M), at 4°C. The Bmax for activated α2M was increased from 56 ± 5 to 178 ± 24 and 143 ± 11 fmol/mg cell protein by PDGF-BB and EGF, respectively, while the KD was unchanged. Northern and Western blot analyses demonstrated that neither PDGF-BB nor EGF increase LRP mRNA or protein levels. Instead, LRP was redistributed to the cell surface and remained localized primarily in coated pits, as determined by surface protein biotinylation, affinity labeling, and immunoelectron microscopy studies. The increase in cell-surface LRP was partially explained by a 50% decrease in receptor endocytosis rate; however, at 37°C, PDGF-BB- and EGF-treated VSMCs still bound/internalized increased amounts of activated α2M and subsequently released increased amounts of trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity. The cytokine-induced shifts in LRP subcellular distribution were stable when VSMCs were challenged with a saturating concentration of ligand and then incubated, in the absence of cytokine, for 2.5 h at 37°C. Regulation of LRP distribution and activity may be an important aspect of the VSMC response to the atherogenic cytokines, PDGF-BB and EGF.

The increase in cell-surface LRP was partially explained by a 50% decrease in receptor endocytosis rate; however, at 37°C, PDGF-BB- and EGF-treated VSMCs still bound/internalized increased amounts of activated α2M and subsequently released increased amounts of trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity. The cytokine-induced shifts in LRP subcellular distribution were stable when VSMCs were challenged with a saturating concentration of ligand and then incubated, in the absence of cytokine, for 2.5 h at 37°C. Regulation of LRP distribution and activity may be an important aspect of the VSMC response to the atherogenic cytokines, PDGF-BB and EGF."

Members of the highly conserved family of α subunits specifically modulate the activities of a diverse array of effector proteins. To investigate the determinants of α subunit-effector specificity, we localized the effector-specifying regions of αi2, which inhibits adenylyl cyclase, and αq, which stimulates phosphoinositide phospholipase C using chimeric α subunits. The chimeras were generated using an in vivo recombination method in Escherichia coli. The effector-specifying regions of both αi2 and αq were localized within the GTPase domain. An αq/αi2/αq chimera containing only 78 αi2 residues within the GTPase domain robustly inhibited adenylyl cyclase. This αi2 segment includes regions corresponding to two of the three regions of αs that activate adenylyl cyclase, but does not include any of the α subunit regions that switch conformation upon binding GTP. Replacement of the αq residues that comprise the helical domain with the homologous αi2 residues resulted in a chimeric α subunit that activated phospholipase C. Combined with previous studies of the effector-specifying residues of αs and αt, our results suggest that the effector specificity of α subunits is generally determined by the GTPase and not the helical domain.

The heterotrimeric G proteins transmit hormonal and sensory signals received by cell surface receptors to effector proteins that regulate processes such as proliferation, secretion, chemotaxis, vision, olfaction, neurotransmitter release, conduction of nerve impulses, and cardiac and smooth muscle contraction (1Gilman A.G.

Nature. 1993; 365: 403-406Google Scholar, 4Neer E. Cell. 1995; 80: 249-257Google Scholar). The α subunit serves as a molecular switch that determines the activation state of a G protein. Liganded receptors activate G proteins by catalyzing the replacement of GDP bound to the α subunit with GTP, resulting in dissociation of α·GTP from the βγ subunits. Both α·GTP and βγ can transmit signals to effector proteins. α·GTP but not α·GDP modulates the activities of effector proteins. The GTPase activity of the α subunit regulates the timing of deactivation and reassociation of the G protein subunits. Differences in the amino acid sequences of the G protein α subunits determine the specificity and nature of their interactions with effector proteins. However, the molecular determinants of effector specificity and the mechanisms by which α subunit-effector interactions affect the structure and function of both proteins are poorly understood. Key questions to be answered include the following. How do specific α subunits and effectors recognize their appropriate partners? How do these interactions depend on the guanine nucleotide-binding state of the α subunit? Is there a common mechanism by which the structurally conserved α subunits recognize and modulate the activities of a diverse array of structurally unrelated effector proteins? A structure/function study of the α subunit provides the opportunity to relate the determinants of effector interaction and specificity to the GTP-dependent molecular switch. Studies of G protein α subunit function can be interpreted in the context of the x-ray crystal structures of αt, which activates cGMP phosphodiesterase in the visual transduction system, and of αi1, which inhibits adenylyl cyclase. The α subunits belong to a structurally conserved family, sharing at least 40% identity at the amino acid level, with 60-90% identity within subfamilies (5Simon M.I. Strathmann M.P. Gautam N. Science. 1991; 252: 802-808Google Scholar). This degree of homology assures (6Chothia C. Lesk A.M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 823-826Google Scholar) that the structures of αt and αi1 (which are closely superimposable) provide an accurate model for the structures of other α subunits. The structures of the GTPγS 1The abbreviations used are: GTPγSguanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate)PLCphosphoinositide phospholipase Cbpbase pair(s). -bound (active) and GDP-bound (inactive) forms of αt (7Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1993; 366: 654-663Google Scholar, 8Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 369: 621-628Google Scholar) and αi1 (9Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Lee E.

Science. 1995; 270: 954-960Google Scholar) have been solved. These α subunit structures consist of two domains, a GTPase domain that resembles the oncogene protein, p21ras, and a helical domain consisting of α helices and connecting loops (see Fig. 7). Comparison of the GTPγS- and GDP-bound structures reveals three regions (Switches I-III) that change conformation depending on the activation state of the α subunit. Understanding α subunit-effector interactions involves relating effector contact sites to these switch regions. guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) phosphoinositide phospholipase C base pair(s). As a first step in understanding how G protein α subunits recognize specific effector proteins and modulate their activities, we previously identified residues of αs that specify activation of adenylyl cyclase (11Berlot C.H. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 911-922Google Scholar). When these effector-activating residues of αs are mapped onto the x-ray crystal structures of the GTPγS-bound forms of αt (7Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1993; 366: 654-663Google Scholar) and αi1 (9Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1994; 265: 1405-1412Google Scholar), they are localized to three adjacent regions in the GTPase domain. One of these regions is part of Switch II (8Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 369: 621-628Google Scholar, 10Mixon M.B. Lee E. Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1995; 270: 954-960Google Scholar), suggesting that this region is directly responsible for the GTP dependence of adenylyl cyclase activation by αs. The α subunit regions that specify activation of adenylyl cyclase by αs are also important for the interaction between αt and its effector, cGMP phosphodiesterase (12Rarick H.M. Artemyev N.O. Hamm H.E. Science. 1992; 256: 1031-1033Google Scholar, 13Spickofsky N. Robichon A. Danho W. Fry D. Greeley D. Graves B. Madison V. Margolskee R.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 11: 771-781Google Scholar, 14Faurobert E. Otto-Bruc A. Chardin P. Chabre M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4191-4198Google Scholar, 15Skiba N.P. Bae H. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 413-424Google Scholar). To investigate whether there is a common mechanism for effector modulation by G protein α subunits, we have localized the residues of αi2 and αq that specify interaction with their respective effectors, adenylyl cyclase and PLC. Adenylyl cyclase and PLC are distinct in structure and cellular localization, so that common features of α subunit interaction with these effectors are likely to be generalizable to the effector interactions of most α subunits. Adenylyl cyclases are a family of proteins that exhibit distinct patterns of regulation by multiple input signals (16Taussig R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1-4Google Scholar). For example, the three isoforms of αi can inhibit the αs-stimulated activity of adenylyl cyclase types V (17Taussig R. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Gilman A.G. Science. 1993; 261: 218-221Google Scholar) and VI (18Taussig R. Tang W.-J. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6093-6100Google Scholar). Thus, αs and αi, which are ~40% identical at the amino acid level, both bind to adenylyl cyclase, but have opposite effects on activity. The PLC isoforms are cytosolic proteins that are structurally unrelated to the adenylyl cyclases. Furthermore, the αq-PLC interaction differs from that between αs and adenylyl cyclase in that PLC-β1 can stimulate the GTPase activity of the α subunit that activates it (19Berstein G. Blank J.L. Jhon D.-Y. Exton J.H. Rhee S.G. Ross E.M. Cell. 1992; 70: 411-418Google Scholar). This study utilized chimeric α subunits to localize the effector-specifying regions of αi2 and αq. We found that the effector-specifying regions of both αi2 and αq are localized within the α subunit GTPase domain. The region of αi2 that specifies interaction with adenylyl cyclase was localized to a 78-residue segment within this domain. Replacement of the αq residues that comprise the helical domain with αi2 residues resulted in a chimeric α subunit that activated PLC. Combined with previous studies of the effector-specifying residues of αs and αt, our results suggest that the effector specificity of α subunits, in general, is determined by the GTPase and not the helical domain. Furthermore, although GTP-dependent conformational changes are required for productive effector interactions, the conformational switch regions are not always determinants of effector specificity. All chimeric α subunits were constructed from mouse αi2 cDNA (20Sullivan K.A. Liao Y.C. Alborzi A. Beiderman B. Chang F.-H. Masters S.B. Levinson A.D. Bourne H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6687-6691Google Scholar) and mouse αq cDNA (21Strathmann M. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9113-9117Google Scholar). Two modifications were made to each of the α subunits to facilitate detection of their activities and expression levels. The arginine at position 179 in αi2 and 183 in αq was mutated to cysteine to inhibit GTPase activity and produce constitutive activation (22Wong Y.H. Federman A. Pace A.M. Zachary I. Evans T. Pouysségur J. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1991; 351: 63-65Google Scholar, 23Conklin B.R. Chabre O. Wong Y.H. Federman A.D. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 31-34Google Scholar). An epitope, referred to as the EE epitope (24Grussenmeyer T. Scheidtmann K.H. Hutchinson M.A. Eckhart W. Walter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7952-7954Google Scholar) was generated by mutating αi2 residues SDYIPTQ(166-172) to EEYMPTE and αq residues SYLPTQ (171-176) to EYMPTE (single-letter amino acid code; mutated residues are underlined). The resultant constructs were designated αi2RCEE and αqRCEE. The αi2RCEE cDNA was a gift of Ann Pace and Henry Bourne. The αqEE cDNA (gift of Paul Wilson and Henry Bourne) was subcloned into the SphI site of the pcDNA I/Amp expression vector (Invitrogen), and arginine 183 was mutated to cysteine to produce αqRCEE by oligonucleotide-directed in vitro mutagenesis (25Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Google Scholar) using the Bio-Rad Muta-Gene kit. αoRCEE was generated from the rat αo cDNA (26Jones D.T. Reed R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14241-14249Google Scholar) by mutating arginine 179 to cysteine and residues DYQPTE (167-172) to EYMPTE. Subcloning and mutagenesis procedures were verified by restriction enzyme analysis and DNA sequencing. The sequence of the multiple cloning site in pcDNA I/Amp was mutated to produce two modified constructs. In pcDNA I/AmpA, the EcoRV site was mutated to a BstEII site. In pcDNA I/AmpB, the HindIII site was removed and a BstEII site was introduced in between the BamHI and BstXI sites. To generate αq/αi2 chimeras, the unique BamHI site in αi2RCEE was removed and the cDNA was subcloned into the EcoRI site of pcDNA I/AmpB. The αqRCEE cDNA was then subcloned upstream of αi2RCEE into the BamHI site of this construct. The plasmid (5 μg) was then linearized at the unique HindIII and BstEII restriction sites in between the two cDNAs and transformed into Library Efficiency HB101 chemically competent cells (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's procedure. Colonies were initially screened by restriction mapping to distinguish between tandem insert constructs and recombinant α subunits and to roughly localize chimera junctions. The precise cross-over points were then identified by DNA sequencing. The αq/αi2 chimeras were designated as QI followed by the number of the bacterial colony from which the cDNA was isolated. For the αi2/αq chimeras, the unique SphI site in αi2RCEE was removed and the cDNA was subcloned into the EcoRI site of pcDNA I/AmpA. The αqRCEE cDNA was then subcloned downstream of αi2RCEE into the SphI site of this construct. The plasmid (5 μg) was then linearized at the unique BstEII and SmaI restriction sites in between the two cDNAs and introduced into chemically competent MV1190 cells (Bio-Rad) that were prepared and transformed according to the method of Chung and Miller (27Chung C.T. Miller R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 3580Google Scholar). Colonies were screened and sequenced as described above. The αi2/αq chimeras were designated as IQ followed by the number of the bacterial colony from which the cDNA was isolated. To generate the QI8+IQ15 chimera, chimera IQ15 was digested with BglII and XhoI to yield a 457-bp fragment of sequence encoding codons 319-330 of αi2 and codons 335-359 and the 3′-untranslated region of αq. BglII-XhoI restriction of Chimera QI8 removed 313 bp of sequence encoding codons 319-355 and the 3′-untranslated region of αi2 that was replaced by the 457-bp fragment from chimera IQ15. To generate the QI13+IQ1 chimera, chimera IQ1 was digested with MscI and SphI to yield a 1166-bp fragment encoding codons 82-177 of αi2 and codons 182-359 and the 3′-untranslated region of αq. Chimera QI13 was digested with MscI and SphI, removing 1024 bp of sequence encoding codons 82-355 and the 3′-untranslated region of αi2 which was replaced by the 1166-bp fragment from chimera IQ1. Recombinant α subunits were transiently expressed in the human embryonic kidney fibroblast line, HEK-293 (American Type Culture Collection, CRL-1573), using DEAE-dextran (28Ausubel F.M. Brent R.E. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Seidman J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987: 9.2.1Google Scholar) under the control of the CMV promoter in pcDNA I/Amp. 106 cells/60-mm dish were transfected with 0.1 μg of vector alone or were co-transfected with 0.1 μg of vector containing the constitutively activated αsRC mutant (arginine 201 is mutated to cysteine; 29Landis C.A. Masters S.B. Spada A. Pace A.M. Bourne H.R. Vallar L. Nature. 1989; 340: 692-696Google Scholar), and 0.03, 0.1, or 0.3 μg of vector containing αi2RCEE, αqRCEE, αoRCEE, or a chimeric α subunit. Inhibition of αsRC-stimulated cAMP accumulation by the recombinant α subunits was measured by determining intracellular cAMP levels in cells labeled with [3H]adenine, as described (11Berlot C.H. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 911-922Google Scholar). 24 h after transfection, the cells were replated in 24-well plates and labeled with [3H]adenine (5 μCi/ml for 24 h). The cells were then washed with 1 ml of assay medium (20 mM HEPES-buffered minimal essential medium with Earle's salts without bicarbonate) and incubated for 30 min at 37°C in 0.5 ml of assay medium containing 1 mM 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine. The medium was then aspirated, and the cells were lysed by the addition of 5% trichloroacetic acid plus 1 mM each of ATP and cAMP. Nucleotides were separated on ion exchange columns (30Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Google Scholar). Conversion of ATP to cAMP was expressed as [3H]cAMP/([3H]ATP + [3H]cAMP) × 103 (31Paris S. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1970-1976Google Scholar). cAMP values in cells co-transfected with αsRC and other constructs were expressed as the fraction of cAMP accumulation in cells transfected only with αsRC. Recombinant α subunits were transiently expressed in HEK-293 cells using DEAE-dextran (28Ausubel F.M. Brent R.E. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Seidman J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987: 9.2.1Google Scholar). The assay for intracellular inositol phosphates in cells labeled with [3H]inositol was a modification of the one described in 23Conklin B.R. Chabre O. Wong Y.H. Federman A.D. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 31-34Google Scholar. 106 cells/60-mm dish were transfected with 3 μg of vector alone or varying amounts of vector containing an α subunit construct (Fig. 5, Fig. 6). 24 h after transfection, the cells were replated in 24-well plates and labeled with [3H]inositol (5 μCi/ml for 24 h). The cells were then washed with 1 ml of assay medium (20 mM HEPES-buffered minimal essential medium with Earle's salts without bicarbonate containing 10 mM LiCl) and then incubated for 1 h at 37°C in 0.5 ml of assay medium. The medium was then aspirated, and the cells were lysed by the addition of 0.75 ml of ice-cold 20 mM formic acid. After a 30-min incubation at 4°C, the lysates were brought to pH 8 with 0.1 ml of 3% ammonium hydroxide. The lysates were loaded onto 1-ml AG1-X8 Dowex columns, followed by the immediate addition of 1 ml of 0.18% ammonium hydroxide to elute the [3H]inositol fraction into scintillation vials containing 4 ml of Ultima Gold scintillation fluid (Packard). The columns were then washed with 4 ml of 40 mM ammonium formate, 0.1 M formic acid. Total [3H]inositol phosphates were eluted with 1 ml of 4 M ammonium formate, 0.2 M formic acid into scintillation vials containing 4 ml of Ultima-Flo AF scintillation fluid (Packard). Inositol phosphate production was expressed as [3H]inositol phosphate/([3H]inositol + [3H]inositol phosphate) × 103.Fig. 6The GTPase domain of αq is sufficient to endow an α subunit chimera with the ability to activate PLC. A, inositol phosphate (IP) levels in 106 HEK-293 cells transfected with the indicated amounts of vector containing αqRCEE, QI13+IQ1, or αi2RCEE and labeled with [3H]inositol were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each value represents the mean ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments.

Data points represent the average values from two independent transfections. The lines represent a linear fit to the data using the KaleidaGraph program (Synergy Software).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) HEK-293 cells in 150-mm dishes were transfected using DEAE-dextran (28Ausubel F.M.

Membranes were prepared 48 h after transient transfection from cells that had been lysed by 10 passages through a 27-gauge needle in an ice-cold buffer containing 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM benzamidine, and 1 mM dithiothreitol. Nuclei were removed by low speed centrifugation at 4°C, and the membrane fractions were then isolated by centrifugation for 30 min at 4°C in a microcentrifuge. 25 μg of membrane proteins were then resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis (10%), transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with the anti-EE monoclonal antibody (24Grussenmeyer T. Scheidtmann K.H. Hutchinson M.A. Eckhart W. Walter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7952-7954Google Scholar), which was purified from hybridoma supernatants using E-Z-SEP reagents (Middlesex Sciences, Inc). The antigen-antibody complexes were detected using an anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-linked antibody according to the ECL Western blotting protocol (Amersham). Quantitation of α subunit expression levels was performed by densitometry using an IS-1000 Digital Imaging System (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA). To localize the αi2 and αq regions that specify interaction with and modulation of their respective effectors, we produced α subunit chimeras in which portions of αi2 were replaced by the corresponding portions of αq. Since αi2 but not αq inhibits adenylyl cyclase (17Taussig R. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Gilman A.G. Science. 1993; 261: 218-221Google Scholar, 32Hepler J.R. Kozasa T. Smrcka A.V. Simon M.I. Rhee S.G. Sternweis P.C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14367-14375Google Scholar) and αq but not αi2 activates PLC (33Taylor S.J. Chae H.Z. Rhee S.G. Exton J.H. Nature. 1991; 350: 516-518Google Scholar, 34Smrcka A.V. Hepler J.R. Brown K.O. Sternweis P.C. Science. 1991; 251: 804-807Google Scholar), the same chimeras could be used to map the effector-specifying regions of both αi2 and αq. In order to characterize these chimeras after transient expression in HEK-293 cells, two features were included to enable measurement of their functions without interference from the activities of the αi and αq proteins endogenous to these cells. First, a conserved arginine was replaced by cysteine (R179C in αi2, R183C in αq). This mutation constitutively activates these α subunits by inhibiting their GTPase activities (22Wong Y.H. Federman A. Pace A.M. Zachary I. Evans T. Pouysségur J. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1991; 351: 63-65Google Scholar, 23Conklin B.R. Chabre O. Wong Y.H. Federman A.D. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 31-34Google Scholar). This mutation made it possible to measure inhibition of adenylyl cyclase or activation of PLC without requiring receptor-mediated activation of the chimeric α subunits. Second, the chimeras include an epitope from an internal region of polyoma virus medium T antigen, referred to as the EE epitope (24Grussenmeyer T. Scheidtmann K.H. Hutchinson M.A. Eckhart W. Walter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7952-7954Google Scholar). In the x-ray crystal structure of αt (7Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1993; 366: 654-663Google Scholar), the site of this epitope maps onto an exposed loop connecting α helices αE and αF in the helical domain (Fig. 7). The EE epitope does not interfere with the αi2-adenylyl cyclase interaction (35Pace A.M. Faure M. Bourne H.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1685-1695Google Scholar) or the αq-PLC interaction (36Wilson P.T. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9667-9675Google Scholar). We generated α subunit chimeras containing αq/αi2 or αi2/αq junctions using a novel method (37Levin L.R. Reed R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7573-7579Google Scholar, 38Moore K.R. Blakely R.D.

Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 635-643Google Scholar) that utilized Escherichia coli DNA repair enzymes to rapidly generate a set of chimeras containing junctions within regions of amino acid identity between αi2 and αq. Plasmids containing single “head to tail” copies of both α subunit genes were linearized in between the two cDNAs and transformed into bacteria. Transformants were derived from either uncut plasmids or plasmids that recircularized in vivo. Using restriction enzyme mapping, we screened 119 colonies generated after transformation of the linearized αq/αi2 plasmid and obtained 73 that were not the original plasmid. The restriction maps of 58 of these 73 constructs were consistent with their being αq/αi2 chimeras. The remaining colonies may have represented recombination events within the 5′- or 3′-untranslated regions of the cDNAs. Of 131 colonies produced from transformation of the linearized αi2/αq plasmid, 97 were not the original plasmid. The restriction maps of 56 of these 97 colonies were consistent with their being αi2/αq chimeras. The junctions of the chimeras were further localized with additional restriction enzymes and then determined precisely by DNA sequencing. The junctions of these chimeras were always in frame. As shown in Fig. 1, six unique αq/αi2 junctions and three unique αi2/αq junctions were obtained. The amount of sequence identity seen at the chimera junctions ranged from 8 to 20 bases. All of the chimeric α subunit cDNAs encoded proteins that were expressed in membranes of transiently transfected HEK-293 cells (Fig. 2). Chimeras QI5, QI1, and IQ15 were expressed at higher levels than those of αi2RCEE and αqRCEE, while chimeras QI13, QI23, IQ1, and QI8+IQ15, an αq/αi2/αq chimera derived from QI8 and IQ15 (see Fig. 3), were expressed at somewhat lower levels, and QI4, QI8, and IQ23 were expressed at significantly reduced levels. A commonly used criterion for proper α subunit folding and function is a GTPγS-dependent decrease in sensitivity to trypsin at a conserved α subunit cleavage site (11Berlot C.H. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 911-922Google Scholar, 40Fung B.K.-K. Nash C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10503-10510Google Scholar, 41Hurley J.B. Simon M.I. Teplow D.B. Robishaw J.D. Gilman A.G.

We were unable to apply this criterion to the chimeric α subunits because αqRCEE expressed in HEK-293 cells exhibited extremely poor GTPγS-dependent trypsin resistance relative to αi2RCEE (data not shown), presumably due to inadequate binding of GTPγS in the absence of receptor stimulation (32Hepler J.R.

Chimeras are depicted as segments with numbers that represent αi2 or αq residues at the beginning and end of segments derived from these proteins (open for αi2 and shaded for αq). All chimeras include the GTPase-inhibiting arginine to cysteine mutation (R179C in αi2, R183C in αq) and the EE epitope as shown for αi2RCEE. Each junction is defined as the point at which the sequence first diverges from that of the amino-terminal α subunit segment. Shown next to each α subunit construct is the cAMP accumulation in 106 HEK-293 cells transfected with 0.1 μg of vector containing αsRC and 0.3 μg of vector containing the indicted α subunit construct. The amount of cAMP accumulation in cells transfected with αsRC alone is set at 1.0, and the values from cells co-transfected with the indicated constructs are expressed relative to this value. cAMP values of constructs with greatly decreased abilities to inhibit cAMP accumulation are shown as shaded bars, and values of constructs that are similar to that of αi2RCEE are shown as open bars. cAMP levels in [3H]adenine-labeled cells were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each value represents the mean ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We measured the ability of recombinant α subunits to inhibit adenylyl cyclase in HEK-293 cells by co-expressing them with the constitutively activated αs mutant, αsRC, in which arginine 201 is mutated to cysteine (29Landis C.A. Masters S.B. Spada A. Pace A.M. Bourne H.R. Vallar L. Nature. 1989; 340: 692-696Google Scholar). Transfection with 0.1 μg of vector containing αsRC resulted in an approximately 18-fold increase in cAMP production compared to cells transfected with the vector alone. Co-transfection with 0.3 μg of vector containing αi2RCEE resulted in ~60% inhibition of the cAMP response to αsRC, while co-transfection with the same amount of vector containing αoRCEE inhibited the response to αsRC by only ~14% (Fig. 3). αoRCEE was used as a negative control because it does not inhibit adenylyl cyclase types V (17Taussig R. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Gilman A.G. Science. 1993; 261: 218-221Google Scholar) or VI (18Taussig R. Tang W.-J. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6093-6100Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W1569747416,"The myocyte enhancer binding factor 2 (MEF2) family of transcription factors plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression in multiple muscle cell types. Four mef2 genes (A, B, C, and D) have been identified in vertebrates. They share the conserved N-terminal MCM1-agamous-deficiens-serum response factor and MEF2 domains that determine DNA binding and dimerization functions. In this study, we have identified human MEF2A domains that control its nuclear localization and transcriptional activation function. Studies of subcellular localization of various truncated MEF2A proteins expressed in HeLa cells demonstrated that MEF2A contains a nuclear localization signal located at its C terminus within the peptide encompassing amino acids (aa) 472-507. Examination of MEF2A mutants with sequential C-terminal deletions indicates that the region encompassing aa 321-472 is essential for transcriptional activity. Analysis of the transcriptional activity of fusion proteins consisting of different domains of MEF2A fused to the DNA binding domain of yeast transcription factor GAL4 revealed a major transcriptional activation domain located between aa 274 and 373. Further studies demonstrated that this domain contains positive and negative regulatory subdomains that cooperate with one another to regulate the transcriptional activity of MEF2A in a cell-type discriminatory manner."

By a combination of ion exchange and reverse-phase liquid chromatography, three inhibitors were purified to homogeneity as ascertained by microsequencing of 14-17 N-terminal amino acids. These inhibitors were identified as oncostatin M (OSM), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1). The identities of the three EC growth inhibitors were confirmed by demonstrating that recombinant human OSM, LIF, and TGF-β1 were inhibitory in the same concentration range. Inhibition of EC proliferation by OSM was a newly described property of this cytokine. OSM was the most potent inhibitor with a half-maximal inhibition by recombinant material of 0.15-.2 ng/ml compared with 0.6-0.9 and 0.9-1.0 ng/ml for LIF and TGF-β1, respectively. The three factors inhibited basal, vascular endothelial cell growth factor-stimulated, and fibroblast growth factor 2-stimulated EC proliferation. Interleukin-6 and ciliary neurotrophic factor, two cytokines related structurally to OSM and LIF, were not active as EC growth inhibitors.

Klagsbrun M. Science. 1987; 235: 442-447Google Scholar, 2Klagsbrun M. D'Amore P.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 217-239Google Scholar). ECs in adult tissue are normally quiescent despite the wide distribution of angiogenic factors such as acidic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-1), basic FGF (FGF-2), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (2Klagsbrun M. D'Amore P.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 217-239Google Scholar). One possible mechanism that might prevent abnormal EC proliferation might be the expression of EC growth inhibitory factors. A number of polypeptides have been shown to inhibit EC growth in culture. These include transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) (3Baird A. Durkin T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 138: 476-482Google Scholar), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (4Schweigerer L. Malerstein B. Gospodarowicz D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 143: 997-1004Google Scholar), platelet factor 4 (5Gupta S.K. Singh J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1121-1127Google Scholar), interferon-γ (6Freisel R. Komoriya A. Maciag T. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 689-690Google Scholar), cartilage-derived inhibitor (7Moses M.A. Sudhalter J. Langer R. Science. 1990; 248: 1408-1410Google Scholar), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) (8Ferrara N. Winer J. Henzel W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 698-702Google Scholar), thrombospondin (9Good D.J. Polverini P.J. Rastinejad F. Le Beau M.M. Lemons R.S. Frazier W.A. Bouck N.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6624-6628Google Scholar), and angiostatin (10O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Shing Y. Chen C. Rosenthal R.A. Moses M. Lane W.S. Cao Y. Sage E.H. Folkman J. Cell. 1994; 79: 315-328Google Scholar). Antibodies directed against the integrin αvβ3 also inhibit EC proliferation (11Brooks P.C. Montgomery A.M. Rosenfeld M. Reisfeld R.A. Hu T. Klier G. Cheresh D.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 1157-1164Google Scholar). EC inhibitors in vitro are usually also angiogenesis inhibitors in vivo, but this is not always the case. For example, TGF-β1 and TNF-α, which are EC inhibitors in vitro, are actually stimulators of angiogenesis in vivo. It has been postulated that TGF-β1 and TNF-α act indirectly to stimulate angiogenesis by induction of angiogenesis factors from inflammatory cells, for example, macrophages and T lymphocytes (12Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Assoian R.K. Smith J.M. Roche N.S. Wakefield L.M. Heine U.L. Liotta L.A. Falanga V. Kehrl J.H. Fauci A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4167-4171Google Scholar). Another possibility is that these EC inhibitors block proliferation but stimulate tube formation, an important component of angiogenesis (13Nguyen M. Folkman J. Bischoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26157-26165Google Scholar).Since macrophages commonly reside at sites of physiological angiogenesis such as wounds and of pathological angiogenesis, such as tumors and atherosclerotic plaques, it is possible that this cell type plays an important role in the angiogenic response (14Koch A. Polverini P.J. Leibovich S.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1986; 39: 233-238Google Scholar, 15Majewski S. Kaminski M. Jablonska S. Szmurlo A. Pawinska M. Arch. Dermatol. 1985; 121: 1018-1021Google Scholar, 16Polverini P.J. Leibovich S.J. Lab. Invest. 1984; 51: 635-642Google Scholar). Macrophages have been shown to produce and release a number of angiogenic stimulators such as VEGF (17Berse B. Brown L.F. van de Water L. Dvorak H.F. Senger D.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 211-220Google Scholar), FGF-2 (18Baird A. Mormede P. Bohlen P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 126: 358-364Google Scholar), and platelet-derived growth factor (19Mornex J.F. Martinet Y. Yamuchi K. Bitterman P.B. Grotendorst G.R. Chytil-Weir A. Martin G.R. Crystal R.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 61-66Google Scholar). Based on the idea that macrophages might produce a balance of EC stimulators and inhibitors, we examined the conditioned media (CM) of U-937 cells, a human histiocytic lymphoma cell line that differentiates into macrophage-like cells upon phorbol ester treatment and that has been demonstrated to produce VEGF (17Berse B. Brown L.F. van de Water L. Dvorak H.F. Senger D.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 211-220Google Scholar). In a previous report, we demonstrated that macrophages released an EC growth inhibitor that was neither TGF-β1 nor TNF-α (20Besner G.E. Klagsbrun M. Microvasc. Res. 1991; 42: 187-197Google Scholar). This EC inhibitory activity was characterized as being basic and mildly heparin-binding but was not purified to any degree. We subsequently analyzed CM of U-937 cells and found a similar activity. We now report the complete purification, N-terminal microsequencing, and identification of three EC growth inhibitors released by U-937 cells. These are oncostatin M (OSM), LIF, and TGF-β1. LIF and OSM belong to a family of IL-6-related cytokines that exhibit a similar helical structure and share receptor components, while TGF-β1 is a member of the TGF-β superfamily. Unlike TGF-β1 and LIF, OSM has not been reported previously to be an EC growth inhibitor and is particularly potent with half-maximal inhibition at 150-200 pg/ml. We have also found that U-937 cells release VEGF, lending support to the idea that macrophage-like cells produce both EC stimulators and inhibitors.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsThe phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), and glutamine/penicillin/streptomycin (GPS) were purchased from Sigma. Bovine calf serum was purchased from Colorado Serum Co. (Denver, CO). All other cell media components were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Recombinant human FGF-2 was obtained from Scios Nova (Mountain View, CA). Recombinant human TGF-β1, LIF, and OSM were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN).Preparation of U-937 Cell Conditioned MediaThe human histiocytic lymphoma cell line U-937 was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and was maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and GPS. Cells were seeded in roller bottles at a density of 5 × 105 cells/ml in fresh RPMI 1640 culture medium containing 5% (v/v) FCS and TPA. Two days later, cells were washed with serum-free media and were incubated in serum-free RPMI 1640 for 48 h, at which time the supernatants were collected and replaced with fresh serum-free RPMI 1640. CM were collected again at 4 and 6 days after 48 h of serum-free culture incubation. The samples of CM were pooled and used as the starting material for the purification of EC inhibitors.Endothelial Cell Growth Inhibition AssaysBovine capillary EC (BCE) and bovine aortic EC (BAE) were used to assay EC growth inhibitors. BCE cells (21Folkman J. Haudenschild C.C. Zetter B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5217-5221Google Scholar) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), 10% bovine calf serum, GPS, and 3 ng/ml recombinant human FGF-2. BAE cells (22Dodge A.B. Lu X. D'Amore P.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 53: 21-31Google Scholar) were maintained in DMEM, 10% FCS, and GPS. For EC growth inhibitor assays, BCE were resuspended in DMEM, 10% bovine calf serum, and BAE cells were resuspended in DMEM, 1% FCS. Both cell types were seeded onto gelatinized 96-well microtiter plates (2 × 103 cells/well/200 μl). The plates were incubated for 24 h at 37°C, and samples to be tested for inhibitory activity were added. After 48 h, 10 μl (0.2 μCi) of [3H]thymidine (specific activity, 27 mCi/mg; DuPont NEN) was added for 6 h, and [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA was determined by liquid scintillation counting (20Besner G.E. Klagsbrun M. Microvasc. Res. 1991; 42: 187-197Google Scholar).Purification of Endothelial Cell Growth InhibitorsThree liters of serum-free U-937 CM were concentrated to 125 ml by ultrafiltration (S1Y10 spiral-wound membrane, molecular weight cut off 10,000; Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA). The retentate was dialyzed against 0.02 M acetic acid, pH 3.5, and after centrifugation (50,000 × g, 30 min) the supernatant was applied to a TSK gel SP-5PW cation exchange column (7.5 × 75 mm, Toso Haas, Montgomeryville, PA). The column was equilibrated with 0.02 M acetic acid, pH 4.0, and bound material was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0-1.5 M) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions of 1 ml were collected and tested for bioactivity. Three active peaks of EC growth inhibitory activity (ECI) were pooled and designated as endothelial cell inhibitors 1, 2, and 3 (ECI 1, ECI 2, ECI 3).ECI 1Fractions collected from the first peak of inhibitory activity eluted from the TSK gel SP-5PW column (with 0.1-0.3 M NaCl) were pooled and injected onto a Vydac C4 RPLC column (4.6 × 250 mm) equilibrated with 10% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Fractions (1 ml) were eluted with a linear gradient of 20-60% acetonitrile at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Next, the inhibitory fractions from the C4 RPLC column were pooled, diluted 2-fold with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and injected onto a TSK gel TMS-250 RPLC column (4.6 × 75 mm, Toso Haas), which had been equilibrated with 10% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoacetic acid. Fractions (1 ml) were eluted with a linear gradient of 32-42% acetonitrile at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Finally, the inhibitory fractions pooled from the TMS-250 RPLC column were diluted 2-fold and injected onto a Vydac C4 RPLC column (4.6 × 50 mm) equilibrated with 10% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Inhibitory fractions (0.5 ml) were eluted with a linear gradient of 35-45% acetonitrile at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min.ECI 2The second peak of EC growth inhibitory activity eluted from the TSK gel SP-5PW cation exchange column (with 0.5-0.7 M NaCl) was injected onto a Vydac C4 RPLC column (4.6 × 250 mm) equilibrated with 10% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Fractions (1 ml) were eluted with a linear gradient of 20-60% acetonitrile at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Next, EC growth inhibitory fractions obtained from the C4 RPLC column were injected onto a Vydac C18 RPLC column (4.6 × 250 mm). EC growth inhibitory fractions were eluted with a gradient of 35-45% acetonitrile.ECI 3The third peak of EC growth inhibitory activity eluted from the TSK gel SP-5PW column (with 0.8-0.9 M NaCl) was injected onto a Vydac C4 RPLC column (4.6 × 250 mm) equilibrated with 10% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Fractions (1 ml) were eluted with a linear gradient of 20-60% acetonitrile at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Next, inhibitory fractions were diluted 2-fold with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and injected onto a Vydac C4 RPLC column (4.6 × 50 mm) equilibrated with 2-propanol. Fractions (1 ml) were eluted with a linear gradient of 25-35% 2-propanol at a flow rate 0.5 ml/min. All the fractions collected during the various purification steps were tested for EC growth inhibitory activity at a final dilution of 1:200 (1 μl of fraction/200 μl of medium/well).SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (PAGE)The molecular masses of EC inhibitors were determined by 15% SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions and silver stained as described previously (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1980; 277: 680-685Google Scholar). In order to extract EC growth inhibitors, non-reduced samples were electrophoresed on a 1-mm thick, 10-cm long 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The polyacrylamide gels were sliced into 1.5-2-mm pieces, which were each crushed and extracted for 6 h at 4°C with 50 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. The polyacrylamide gel extracts were assayed for EC growth inhibitory activity.Amino Acid Analysis and MicrosequencingNon-reduced samples were electrophoresed on 15% SDS-PAGE gels, as described above, and transferred to PVDF membranes (ProBlott, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). After staining with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue, protein bands corresponding to EC inhibitory activity were excised and dried. One-tenth of the sample was used for amino acid analysis to estimate the total protein amount, and the other nine-tenths was analyzed for N-terminal amino acid sequences by microsequencing. Amino acid analysis and microsequencing were performed by Dr. Bill Lane of the Harvard Microchemistry Facility using Pico-Tag amino acid analysis HPLC and a gas-phase sequenator (Applied Biosystems).DISCUSSIONWe have demonstrated that in addition to the EC growth stimulator, VEGF, macrophage-like U-937 cells release EC growth inhibitors as well. We have purified three such inhibitors, and by microsequencing analysis, have identified them to be OSM, LIF, and TGF-β1. These factors inhibit basal EC proliferation in the 0.1-1 ng/ml range. OSM is particularly potent with a half-maximal inhibition of EC growth at 150-200 pg/ml (5-6.6 pM), making it one of the more potent peptide EC inhibitors reported to date. By comparison, other known EC growth inhibitors such as TNF-α, angiostatin, cartilage-derived inhibitor, platelet factor 4, and thrombospondin are half-maximally effective at 3 ng/ml (4Schweigerer L. Malerstein B. Gospodarowicz D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 143: 997-1004Google Scholar), 300 ng/ml (10O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Shing Y. Chen C. Rosenthal R.A. Moses M. Lane W.S. Cao Y. Sage E.H. Folkman J. Cell. 1994; 79: 315-328Google Scholar), 700 ng/ml (7Moses M.A. Sudhalter J. Langer R. Science. 1990; 248: 1408-1410Google Scholar), 1 μg/ml (5Gupta S.K. Singh J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1121-1127Google Scholar), and 1.5 μg/ml (9Good D.J. Polverini P.J. Rastinejad F. Le Beau M.M. Lemons R.S. Frazier W.A. Bouck N.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6624-6628Google Scholar), respectively. The three macrophage-derived EC growth inhibitors inhibit growth of small and large vessel ECs, and besides inhibiting basal growth, they antagonize VEGF- and FGF-2-mediated EC growth as well.Identification of TGF-β1 and LIF as EC growth inhibitors is not novel. TGF-β1, a 25-kDa dimer, has been shown to be an inhibitor of both small and large vessel EC proliferation in a number of studies consistent with the general inhibitory effects of TGF-β1 on numerous cell types (32Tucker R.F. Shipley G.D. Moses H.L. Holley R.W. Science. 1984; 233: 705-707Google Scholar, 33Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Wakefield L.M. Assoian R.K. Science. 1986; 233: 532-534Google Scholar, 34Anzano M.A. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1986; 126: 312-318Google Scholar). The mechanism of TGF-β1 inhibition is thought to occur at the level of cyclins, possibly by blocking Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and inhibiting cyclin E expression (35Geng Y. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10315-10319Google Scholar). LIF is a 50-58-kDa glycoprotein originally identified as an inhibitor of murine myeloid leukemia cells (36Gearing D.P. Gough N.M. King J.A. Hilton D.J. Nicola N.A. Simpson R.J. Nice E.C. Kelso A. Metcalf D. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3995-4002Google Scholar) and subsequently found to have diverse and apparently unrelated biological effects, including the ability to induce bone absorption (37Reid L.R. Lowe C. Cornish J. Skinner S.J. Hilton D.J. Wilsson T.A. Gearing D.P. Martin T.J. Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 1416-1420Google Scholar), to stimulate the synthesis of acute stage plasma proteins from hepatocytes (38Baumann H. Wong G. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 1163-1167Google Scholar), and to inhibit embryonic stem-cell growth (39Smith A.G. Heath J.K. Donaldson D.D. Wong G.G. Moreau J. Stahl M. Rogers D. Nature. 1988; 336: 688-690Google Scholar). LIF has been previously reported to be an inhibitor of large blood vessel EC proliferation but (unlike in our studies) not an inhibitor of small vessel EC proliferation (8Ferrara N. Winer J. Henzel W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 698-702Google Scholar). This difference is not understood since BAE cells and adrenal cortex-derived capillary ECs were used in both studies. On the other hand, the identification of OSM as an EC growth inhibitor appears to be novel. OSM is a 30-kDa protein identified in the CM of U-937 cells that was first identified as an inhibitor of A375 melanoma proliferation (40Zarling J.M. Shoyab M. Marquardt H. Hanson M.B. Lioubin M.N. Todaro G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9739-9743Google Scholar). In contrast, OSM is a mitogen for smooth muscle cells (41Grove R.I. Eberhardt C. Abid S. Mazzucco C. Liu J. Kiener P. Todaro G. Shoyab M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 823-827Google Scholar) (as is another EC inhibitor, TGF-β1 (42Majack R.A. Majesky M.W. Goodman L.V. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 239-247Google Scholar)) and a mitogen for AIDS-Kaposi's sarcoma cells (43Nair B.C. DeVico A.L. Nakamura S. Copeland T.D. Chen Y. Petel A. O'Neil T. Oroszlan S. Gallo R. Sarngadharan M.G. Science. 1992; 255: 1430-1432Google Scholar, 44Miles S.A. Martinez-Maza O. Rezai A. Magpantay L. Kishimoto T. Nakamura S. Radka S.F. Linder P.S. Science. 1992; 255: 1432-1434Google Scholar). Interestingly, while OSM and LIF are EC growth inhibitors, IL-6 and CNTF are not, even though these four cytokines are structurally related and work through a similar receptor system. Significant similarities have been identified in the general exon organization, primary amino acid sequences, and predicted secondary structure of OSM, LIF, CNTF, and IL-6, suggesting that they have a common evolutionary origin (45Bazan J.F. Neuron. 1991; 7: 187-208Google Scholar). These structural similarities might explain why they share many properties in common such as induction of acute phase protein synthesis, stimulation of myeloma growth, and differentiation of neuronal and leukemic cells (46Hirano T. Matsuda T. Nakajima K. Stem Cells. 1994; 12: 262-277Google Scholar). However, there are differences among these cytokines in receptor recognition. They have a common receptor subunit, gp130, that mediates cytokine signal transduction but that binds the cytokines either not at all, or weakly (47Gearing D.P. Comeau M.R. Friend D.J. Gimpel S.D. Thut C.J. McGourty J. Brasher K.K. King J.A. Gillis S. Mosley B. Ziegler S.F. Cosmon D. Science. 1992; 255: 1434-1437Google Scholar, 48Taga T. Hibi M. Hirata Y. Yamasaki K. Yasukawa K. Matsuda T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1989; 58: 573-581Google Scholar, 49Ip N.Y. Nye S.H. Boulton T.G. Davis S. Taga T. Li Y. Birren S.J. Yasukawa K. Kishimoto T. Anderson D.J. Stahl N. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell. 1992; 69: 1121-1132Google Scholar). An LIF-binding protein has been identified, which in combination with gp130 acts as a high affinity LIF receptor (47Gearing D.P. Comeau M.R. Friend D.J. Gimpel S.D. Thut C.J. McGourty J. Brasher K.K. King J.A. Gillis S. Mosley B. Ziegler S.F. Cosmon D. Science. 1992; 255: 1434-1437Google Scholar). The high affinity LIF receptor also binds OSM but not IL-6 or CNTF. There are also specific IL-6 and CNTF receptors acting in concert with gp130 (46Hirano T. Matsuda T. Nakajima K. Stem Cells. 1994; 12: 262-277Google Scholar, 50Davis S. Aldrich T.H. Valenzuela D.M. Wong V. Furth M.E. Squinto S.P. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1991; 253: 59-63Google Scholar). Thus one explanation for the EC growth inhibitory activities of OSM and LIF, but not IL-6 and CNTF, is that ECs express the high affinity LIF receptor complex but not the IL-6 or CNTF receptor complexes. A specific OSM receptor that does not bind LIF has been reported (51Thoma B. Bird T.A. Friend D.J. Gearing D.P. Dower S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6215-6222Google Scholar), which might explain why OSM is a more potent inhibitor than LIF. Another possibility that might explain cytokine specificity is that IL-6 family members have different signal transduction pathways. For example, they induce overlapping but distinct patterns of tyrosine phosphorylation (52Yin T. Yang Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3731-3738Google Scholar, 53Lutticken C. Wegenka U.M. Yuan J. Buschmann J. Schindler C. Ziemiecki A. Harpur A.G. Wilks A.F. Yasukawa K. Taga T. Science. 1994; 263: 82-92Google Scholar). An investigation of receptor expression patterns might explain not only differences in cytokine specificity but why these cytokines can act as both inhibitors and mitogens depending on the cell type.Preliminary experiments indicate that in the chorioallantoic membrane assay (54Taylor S. Folkman J. Nature. 1982; 297: 307-312Google Scholar) OSM (up to 5 μg) is not an angiogenesis inhibitor, consistent with previous results failing to show that LIF is an angiogenesis inhibitor in the same chorioallantoic membrane system (8Ferrara N. Winer J. Henzel W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 698-702Google Scholar). A mouse cornea angiogenesis assay (55D'Amato R.J. Loughnan M.S. Flynn E. Folkman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4082-4085Google Scholar) was also attempted, but rhOSM did not inhibit neovascular formation. However, the relationship between EC inhibition and angiogenesis is unclear. Some EC inhibitors in vitro are angiogenesis inhibitors in vivo, e.g. thrombospondin (9Good D.J. Polverini P.J. Rastinejad F. Le Beau M.M. Lemons R.S. Frazier W.A. Bouck N.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6624-6628Google Scholar). On the other hand, TGF-β1, which is a potent EC inhibitor in vitro, is an angiogenesis stimulator in vivo probably acting in an indirect fashion (12Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Assoian R.K. Smith J.M. Roche N.S. Wakefield L.M. Heine U.L. Liotta L.A. Falanga V. Kehrl J.H. Fauci A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4167-4171Google Scholar). Whether OSM is an angiogenesis inhibitor or not might require a more biologically relevant assay such as analyzing its effects on wound healing, a process mediated by macrophages.In summary, macrophage-like cells release at least three EC growth inhibitors, OSM, LIF, and TGF-β1, as well as the potent EC mitogen and angiogenesis factor, VEGF. Thus we speculate that the balance of EC mitogen/EC inhibitor levels might be an important modulator of EC proliferation in response to macrophage infiltration. Interestingly, in advanced atherosclerotic lesions, where macrophages heavily infiltrate the vessel wall, arterial endothelium is damaged and fails to regenerate (28Barger A.C. Beeuwkes R. Lainey L.L. Silverman K.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1984; 310: 175-177Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that OSM and LIF derived from macrophages or other cell types may play a role in mediating vessel endothelium stasis after damage.

Klagsbrun M. Science. 1987; 235: 442-447Google Scholar, 2Klagsbrun M. D'Amore P.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 217-239Google Scholar). ECs in adult tissue are normally quiescent despite the wide distribution of angiogenic factors such as acidic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-1), basic FGF (FGF-2), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (2Klagsbrun M. D'Amore P.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 217-239Google Scholar). One possible mechanism that might prevent abnormal EC proliferation might be the expression of EC growth inhibitory factors. A number of polypeptides have been shown to inhibit EC growth in culture. These include transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) (3Baird A. Durkin T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 138: 476-482Google Scholar), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (4Schweigerer L. Malerstein B. Gospodarowicz D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 143: 997-1004Google Scholar), platelet factor 4 (5Gupta S.K. Singh J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1121-1127Google Scholar), interferon-γ (6Freisel R. Komoriya A. Maciag T. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 689-690Google Scholar), cartilage-derived inhibitor (7Moses M.A. Sudhalter J. Langer R. Science. 1990; 248: 1408-1410Google Scholar), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) (8Ferrara N. Winer J. Henzel W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 698-702Google Scholar), thrombospondin (9Good D.J. Polverini P.J. Rastinejad F. Le Beau M.M. Lemons R.S. Frazier W.A. Bouck N.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6624-6628Google Scholar), and angiostatin (10O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Shing Y. Chen C. Rosenthal R.A. Moses M. Lane W.S. Cao Y. Sage E.H. Folkman J. Cell. 1994; 79: 315-328Google Scholar). Antibodies directed against the integrin αvβ3 also inhibit EC proliferation (11Brooks P.C. Montgomery A.M. Rosenfeld M. Reisfeld R.A. Hu T. Klier G. Cheresh D.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 1157-1164Google Scholar). EC inhibitors in vitro are usually also angiogenesis inhibitors in vivo, but this is not always the case. For example, TGF-β1 and TNF-α, which are EC inhibitors in vitro, are actually stimulators of angiogenesis in vivo. It has been postulated that TGF-β1 and TNF-α act indirectly to stimulate angiogenesis by induction of angiogenesis factors from inflammatory cells, for example, macrophages and T lymphocytes (12Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Assoian R.K. Smith J.M. Roche N.S. Wakefield L.M. Heine U.L. Liotta L.A. Falanga V. Kehrl J.H. Fauci A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4167-4171Google Scholar). Another possibility is that these EC inhibitors block proliferation but stimulate tube formation, an important component of angiogenesis (13Nguyen M. Folkman J. Bischoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26157-26165Google Scholar).Since macrophages commonly reside at sites of physiological angiogenesis such as wounds and of pathological angiogenesis, such as tumors and atherosclerotic plaques, it is possible that this cell type plays an important role in the angiogenic response (14Koch A.

In the transformed macrophage-derived RAW264 cell line, ODC was overproduced and existed in both unphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms. To date, the only protein kinase known to phosphorylate mammalian ODC is casein kinase II (CKII). ODC was phosphorylated in vitro by CKII and subjected to exhaustive sequential proteolysis with trypsin and V8 protease. Two-dimensional peptide mapping showed only a single phosphopeptide; two-dimensional phosphoamino acid analysis of the phosphopeptide revealed only 32P-labeled serine. ODC was metabolically radiolabeled with 32Pi in RAW264 cells and also subjected to proteolysis, two-dimensional peptide mapping, and phosphoamino acid analysis. Two phosphopeptides were generated from the metabolically radiolabeled ODC, including one that migrated similarly to the peptide phosphorylated by CKII in vitro. Each of the in situ radiolabeled ODC peptides contained both 32P-labeled serine and threonine residues. Thus, in RAW264 cells, ODC is phosphorylated on at least one serine residue in addition to that phosphorylated by CKII and on at least two threonine residues. Phosphorylated ODC had an increased stability to intracellular proteolysis compared with unphosphorylated ODC, their half-lives being 49.2 ± 3.78 and 23.9 ± 2.6 min (p = 0.001), respectively. The phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of ODC were independently purified to homogeneity. Kinetic analysis revealed that the catalytic efficiency of the phosphorylated form of ODC was 50% greater than that of the unphosphorylated form; the unphosphorylated ODC had a Vmax of 20.54 ± 1.65 μmol/min/mg, whereas the phosphorylated form had a Vmax of 30.61 ± 2.6 μmol/min/mg (p = 0.005). Phosphorylation of ODC by CKII has no effect on enzyme activity. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that regulation of ODC activity is governed by as yet unidentified protein kinases.

Putrescine, the product of ODC catalysis, and the subsequent metabolic pathway products spermidine and spermine are small aliphatic nitrogenous bases that fulfill structural and regulatory roles in protein and nucleic acid biosynthesis and function (1Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 749-790Google Scholar). Cellular ODC activity increases rapidly and transiently in response to trophic, proliferative, or toxic stimuli (2Pegg A.E. McCann P.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 243: C212-C221Google Scholar). Both somatic cell genetic and pharmacologic experimental approaches have demonstrated that expression of ODC is essential for cell growth. Regulation of enzyme expression at the levels of DNA transcription, mRNA translation, and protein turnover have been described (for reviews, see 3Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 759-774Google Scholar and 4Kameji T. Hayashi S. Hoshino K. Kakinuma Y. Igarashi K. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 581-586Google Scholar). However, little is known about potential posttranslational regulation of ODC.Multiple forms of ODC protein occur in a variety of cells and tissues. Anion exchange chromatography resolves several peaks of ODC activity in extracts prepared from calf liver (5Haddox M.K. Russell D.H. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6721-6729Google Scholar), rat thymus and kidney (6Richards J.F. Lit K. Fuca R. Bourgeault C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 105: 1189-1197Google Scholar). IEF analysis of ODC isolated from HTC cells (9Mitchell J.L.A. Rynning M.D. Chen H.J. Hicks M.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 260: 585-594Google Scholar), kidney (10Persson L. Seely J.E. Pegg A.E. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 3777-3783Google Scholar), skin (11O'Brien T.G. Madara T. Pyle J.A. Holmes M. Proc. Natl.

Biochem. 1994; 281: 149-156Google Scholar) shows that multiple isoelectric forms of ODC protein are present. ODC is phosphorylated in situ in murine macrophage-derived, Abelson virus-transformed RAW264 cells (13Reich D.J. Worth L.L. Haddox M.K. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 935aGoogle Scholar), Friend erythroleukemia cells (14Flamigni F. Marmiroli S. Meggio F. Guarnieri C. Penna L.A. Biochim. Biophys.

Biochem. 1991; 197: 419-424Google Scholar), a murine mammary tumor variant cell line, EXOD-1 (16Kanamoto R. Kameji T. Iwashita S. Igarashi K. Hayashi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9393-9399Google Scholar), and a variant rat hepatoma HTC cell line, DH23b (17Mitchell J.L.A. Hoff J.A. Bareyal-Leyser A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 290: 143-152Google Scholar). A consensus sequence for casein kinase II (CKII)-catalyzed phosphorylation is conserved in the eucaryotic ODC amino acid sequence around serine 303 (18Kahana C. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1673-1677Google Scholar, 19van-Kranen H.J. van-de-Zande L. van-Kreijl C.J. Bisschop A. Wieeringa B. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 60: 145-155Google Scholar, 20Hickok N.J. Seppanen P.J. Gunsalus G.L. Janne O.A. DNA (NY). 1987; 6: 179-187Google Scholar). CK II phosphorylates ODC on serine in vitro (21Meggio F. Flamigni F. Caldarera C.M. Guarnieri C. Pinna L.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 122: 997-1004Google Scholar, 22Tipnis U.K. Haddox M.K. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1990; 36: 275-289Google Scholar, 23Meggio F. Flamigni F. Guarnieri C. Pinna L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 929: 114-116Google Scholar), with a Km similar to that of its other cellular substrates (22Tipnis U.K. Haddox M.K. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1990; 36: 275-289Google Scholar); however, this phosphorylation has no effect on ODC activity. Only radiolabeled phosphoserine residues were detected in ODC isolated from metabolically radiolabeled 653-1 (15Rosenburg-Hasson Y. Strumpf D. Kahana C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 419-424Google Scholar), EXOD-1 (16Kanamoto R. Kameji T. Iwashita S. Igarashi K. Hayashi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9393-9399Google Scholar), and DH23b cells (17Mitchell J.L.A. Hoff J.A. Bareyal-Leyser A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 290: 143-152Google Scholar). Rosenberg-Hasson et al. (15Rosenburg-Hasson Y. Strumpf D. Kahana C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 419-424Google Scholar) reported that in COS-7 cells transiently transfected with wild type and Ser303→ Ala mutant ODC expression vectors, serine 303 is the major (if not the only) amino acid residue phosphorylated on the enzyme protein. Furthermore, mutation of ODC serine 303 to alanine had no effect on the cellular ODC protein half-life or enzyme activity.In contrast, our preliminary findings indicated that RAW264 cell ODC phosphorylated in situ has a greater catalytic capacity than the native form of the enzyme (24Worth L.L. Haddox M.K. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 107: 855aGoogle Scholar). We have previously shown that ODC is phosphorylated in RAW264 cells on both serine and threonine residues (25Worth L.L. Cochran B.J. Haddox M.K. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3967-3970Google Scholar). These findings led us to question whether ODC was subject to phosphorylation in RAW264 cells at additional sites to that phosphorylated by CKII. In this report we demonstrate by comparative two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping and phosphoamino acid analysis that in the RAW264 cell line ODC is phosphorylated on at least three amino acid residues in addition to that phosphorylated by CKII. We also conducted studies to investigate the significance of intracellular phosphorylation of ODC in RAW264 cells. The results demonstrate two functional consequences of the in situ phosphorylation of ODC. The phosphorylated form of the enzyme was more resistant to proteolysis in situ than the unphosphorylated form. In addition, kinetic analysis demonstrated that the purified phosphorylated form of ODC has a higher catalytic capacity than the purified unphosphorylated form of the enzyme.DISCUSSIONODC has been demonstrated to be phosphorylated in situ (13Reich D.J. Worth L.L. Haddox M.K. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 935aGoogle Scholar, 14Flamigni F. Marmiroli S. Meggio F. Guarnieri C. Penna L.A. Biochim. Biophys.

Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3967-3970Google Scholar), but the relevance of this posttranslational modification of the enzyme has remained unclear. The present results demonstrate that intracellular phosphorylation of ODC can lead to an increase in both the intracellular stability and the catalytic capacity of the phosphorylated enzyme compared with the unphosphorylated enzyme.Different ionic forms of ODC protein have been shown to exist. Multiple peaks of ODC activity elute from anion exchange chromatography columns loaded with extracts of various tissue and cultured cell types (5Haddox M.K. Russell D.H. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6721-6729Google Scholar, 6Richards J.F. Lit K. Fuca R. Bourgeault C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 99: 1461-1467Google Scholar, 7Flamigni F. Guarnieri C. Caldarera C.

It has been demonstrated in several experimental systems that phosphatase treatment and rechromatography of the second, more acidic peak of ODC shifts the enzyme's elution position to that of the first peak (35Sumiyoshi H. Baer A.R. Wargovich M.J. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2069-2072Google Scholar, 42Richards J.F. Janzen A. Peng T. Strumpfer A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 80-87Google Scholar). Furthermore, the initial, more basic peak of ODC can be phosphorylated by CKII, whereas the second, more acidic peak of ODC is not a substrate for this kinase (41Peng T. Richards J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 153: 135-141Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggested that the basis of the multiple forms of ODC was enzyme phosphorylation. Fig. 5 demonstrates that the two major ionic peaks of ODC isolated by anion exchange chromatography of RAW264 cell extract are identical to the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of ODC present in these cells.We have previously observed that ODC from RAW264 cells is phosphorylated on both serine and threonine residues (25Worth L.L. Cochran B.J. Haddox M.K. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3967-3970Google Scholar). The consensus phosphorylation sequence for CKII is a serine or threonine residue followed by acidic amino acids. The most critical acidic residue is the third amino acid at the carboxyl-terminal position to the serine or threonine, with additional acidic residues improving the affinity of the serine or threonine for CKII-catalyzed phosphorylation (43Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1991; 28: 124-164Google Scholar). The native amino acid sequence of murine ODC (18Kahana C. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1673-1677Google Scholar, 19van-Kranen H.J. van-de-Zande L. van-Kreijl C.J. Bisschop A. Wieeringa B. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 60: 145-155Google Scholar, 20Hickok N.J. Seppanen P.J. Gunsalus G.L. Janne O.A. DNA (NY). 1987; 6: 179-187Google Scholar) contains 10 potential CKII phosphorylation consensus sequences, 6 containing serine (residues 32, 33, 91, 135, 303, and 445) and 4 containing threonine (residues 5, 19, 85, and 203). Therefore, we analyzed RAW264 cell ODC to identify the amino acid(s) phosphorylated in vitro by CKII. In agreement with the report of Rosenberg-Hasson et al., (15Rosenburg-Hasson Y. Strumpf D. Kahana C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 419-424Google Scholar), we found that serine was the only ODC amino acid residue modified by CKII in vitro. Since we can identify phosphothreonine residues in ODC phosphorylated in RAW264 cells, we conclude that the in situ phosphorylation of RAW264 ODC threonine residues is catalyzed by a protein kinase(s) distinct from CKII.Proteolytic digestion of ODC phosphorylated in situ generated anionic and cationic phosphopeptides, both of which contained phosphoserine and phosphothreonine, whereas digestion of ODC phosphorylated in vitro by CKII generated only an anionic phosphopeptide, which contained only phosphoserine. Since the trypsin and V8 protease treatment and two-dimensional peptide mapping of ODC phosphorylated in vitro by CKII and in situ in metabolically 32Pi-radiolabeled RAW264 cells was carried out in parallel and under the exact same experimental conditions, it is unlikely that the cationic phosphopeptide detected in the in situ phosphorylated ODC is an incomplete proteolytic cleavage product of the anionic phosphopeptide detected in both the in vitro and in situ phosphorylated ODC. If it were, the peptide would have also been detected in the ODC preparation phosphorylated in vitro. Thus, our results demonstrate that there is at least one serine residue, in addition to that residue phosphorylated by CKII, and at least two threonine residues in the ODC molecule that are phosphorylated in RAW264 cells. The finding that ODC is subject to multisite phosphorylation in this cell line is consistent with the accompanying observation that a homogeneous preparation of phosphorylated ODC from RAW264 cells has a greater catalytic capacity than a similar preparation of unphosphorylated ODC. This finding is in contrast to data we and others have reported showing that in vitro phosphorylation of ODC by CKII has no effect on the decarboxylating activity (21Meggio F. Flamigni F. Caldarera C.M. Guarnieri C. Pinna L.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 122: 997-1004Google Scholar, 22Tipnis U.K. Haddox M.K. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1990; 36: 275-289Google Scholar).Rosenberg-Hasson, et al. (15Rosenburg-Hasson Y. Strumpf D. Kahana C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 419-424Google Scholar) found that only phosphoserine was present in ODC phosphorylated in mouse myeloma 653-1 cells. In addition, phosphopeptide analysis of this ODC showed only phosphopeptides analogous to those observed in ODC phosphorylated in vitro by CKII. These findings led them to conclude that in cells, ODC is phosphorylated at a single location (serine 303) and that CKII, or a protein kinase with similar characteristics, is responsible for this phosphorylation. However, our findings in the mouse Abelson virus-transformed, macrophage-derived RAW264 cell line clearly demonstrate that such a conclusion about intracellular phosphorylation of ODC cannot be generalized to all cell types. ODC in RAW264 cells is phosphorylated on both serine and threonine residues, which are present at at least four distinct sites in the enzyme amino acid sequence, only one of which is consistent with the site phosphorylated by CKII.There are at least two potential explanations for the reported differences: (i) different cell lines and tissues may inherently express unique phosphorylation patterns of ODC or may differentially acquire unique patterns after transformation with different oncogenes; with regard to the latter, we did assess the ability of bcr-abl to phosphorylate ODC but found that no phosphorylation occurred; and (ii) the peptide-mapping technique used in the study of 653-1 cells used only a single protease and by design generated only incomplete digestion products (15Rosenburg-Hasson Y. Strumpf D. Kahana C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 419-424Google Scholar). This experimental approach could obscure the detection of unique phosphopeptides present in cellularly phosphorylated ODC versus ODC phosphorylated by CKII. In addition, the phosphoamino acid analysis of metabolically radiolabeled ODC was conducted for just a single time, 2 h. We have previously shown that the detection of radiolabeled ODC phosphothreonine residues is optimal after longer times of acid hydrolysis (25Worth L.L. Cochran B.J. Haddox M.K. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3967-3970Google Scholar), a finding consistent with the fact that the stability to acid hydrolysis of both the peptide bond and the phosphoester bond is significantly greater for phosphothreonine than for phosphoserine (44Duclos B. Marcandier S. Cozzone A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 10-21Google Scholar). Thus, the selection of only a single, relatively short acid hydrolysis time may not have been sufficient for the detection of phosphothreonine.Having available homogeneous preparations of the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated ODC from RAW264 cells has allowed us to conduct independent kinetic characterizations of the two forms of the enzyme. Any potential interference from enzyme-modifying cellular factors such as free polyamines or ODC antizyme (a small ODC-binding protein that reversibly inactivates the enzyme and mediates polyamine-induced ODC degradation (45Murakami Y. Fujita K. Kameji T. Hayashi S. Biochem. J. 1985; 225: 689-697Google Scholar, 46Murakami Y. Nishiyana M. Hayashi S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 181-184Google Scholar, 47Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Miyazaki Y. Hayashi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13138-13141Google Scholar)) has been circumvented by purification of the two forms of ODC. With regard to all variables tested, the phosphorylated ODC from RAW264 cells has a higher catalytic capacity than the unphosphorylated form. An analysis of this rigor would not be possible using crude cell extracts prepared from cells transiently transfected with mutant or wild type ODC expression vectors.Recently, the results of in vitro transcription and translation studies using plasmids with ODC mutated at active site residues have led to the conclusion that the active form of ODC is a dimer (48Tsirka S. Coffino P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23057-23062Google Scholar) containing two active sites at the subunit interface (49Tobias K.E. Kahana C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5842-5847Google Scholar). Under these experimental conditions, it has been shown that mixing of purified mutant ODC enzymes with the wild type results in rapid exchange of the subunits under physiologic conditions (50Coleman C.S. Stanley B.A. Viswanath R. Pegg A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3155-3158Google Scholar). The fact that we were able to purify unphosphorylated and phosphorylated ODC to homogeneity in an active state indicates that each form is able to assemble into a functional homodimer. We have assessed whether mixing of the RAW264 cell unphosphorylated ODC with the phosphorylated ODC would result in either an increase or decrease in the Vmax of the mixed population, indicative of heterodimerization of the two enzyme forms with one enzyme state being dominant over the other. Our results showed that if the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated ODC enzyme molecules did form heterodimers, the dimers had an average maximal activity of the two enzyme forms.Intracellular proteolysis of ODC is a regulated process. The half-life of the enzyme, which is extremely short (15-30 min) in normal tissues (51Russell D.H. Snyder S.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1969; 5: 253-262Google Scholar), is altered by growth stimulation, transformation, toxic injury, alterations in specific extracellular amino acids, or alterations in cellular polyamine content (for reviews, see 2Pegg A.E. McCann P.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 243: C212-C221Google Scholar and 3Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 759-774Google Scholar). The complete molecular mechanism(s) by which all these alterations in ODC half-life occur is unknown, although it is known that the polyamine-stimulated degradation is facilitated by antizyme (45Murakami Y. Fujita K. Kameji T. Hayashi S. Biochem. J. 1985; 225: 689-697Google Scholar, 46Murakami Y. Nishiyana M. Hayashi S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 181-184Google Scholar, 47Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Miyazaki Y. Hayashi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13138-13141Google Scholar) and occurs in complex with the 26S proteasome (52Madhubala R. Secrist III, J.A. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1988; 254: 45-50Google Scholar, 53Bercovich Z. Kahana A.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 205-210Google Scholar).A role for posttranslational modification of ODC in regulating the turnover of the enzyme has been previously suggested by two different experimental approaches. First, it was observed that a reticulocyte lysate system would degrade in vitro synthesized ODC but not cell-derived ODC, leading the authors to speculate that an intracellular posttranslational modification of ODC may regulate its degradation (54Bercovich Z. Rosenberg-Hasson Y. Ciechanover A. Kahana C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15949-15952Google Scholar). A second group of studies demonstrated a difference in the intracellular half-life of the two major ionic forms of ODC eluted from anion exchange columns. In all the experimental systems used, including serum-stimulated HTC cells (55Mitchell J.L. Mahan D.W. McCann P.P. Qasba P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 840: 309-316Google Scholar), livers from chloroform-treated rats (56Pereira M.A. Savage Jr., R.E. Gurion C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1983; 32: 2511-2514Google Scholar) or kidneys from rats treated with dexamethasone, prolactin, or growth hormone (42Richards J.F. Janzen A. Peng T. Strumpfer A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 80-87Google Scholar), the second, more acidic form of ODC had a longer half-life than the first, more basic form. The increase in half-life of the more acidic ODC isoelectric form compared with the more basic form ranged from 2- to 100-fold in the various experimental systems studied.Phosphorylation has been shown to regulate protein stability to intracellular degradation. For example the stability of c-Fos is decreased by the phosphorylation state of c-Jun when heterodimers of c-Fos and c-Jun are formed (57Papavassiliou A.G. Treir M. Chavrier C. Bohmann D. Science. 1992; 58: 1941-1944Google Scholar). Also, Rag-1 and Rag-2, proteins that mediate the assembly of antigen receptor genes, degrade rapidly once they are phosphorylated (58Lin W. Disiderio S. Science. 1993; 260: 953-959Google Scholar). The monospecific antiserum to ODC and the high resolution slab gel IEF and immunoblotting method we have developed allows us to separate and directly quantitate the amount of the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of ODC in intact RAW264 cells. Thus, we have directly demonstrated that in RAW264 cells the phosphorylated form of ODC has a longer half-life in situ than the unphosphorylated form. The in situ kinetic data presented in Fig. 4 permit further interpretation. The significant differences in the cellular half-life of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated ODC strongly suggest that the two forms of ODC are not in rapid equilibrium with each other within the environment of the intact cell. However, the data do not permit us to discern whether the phosphorylated form of ODC is a direct substrate for the degradative machinery of the cell or whether phosphorylated ODC is first dephosphorylated and then degraded.In conclusion, we have demonstrated that ODC in stimulated RAW264 cells exists in both unphosphorylated and phosphorylated states and that ODC is phosphorylated at multiple sites, in addition to that phosphorylated by CK II. The consequences of the posttranslational modification are 2-fold: (i) the phosphorylated enzyme is more stable to proteolytic degradation; and (ii) its catalytic efficiency is significantly increased. To date, the only protein kinase documented to phosphorylate ODC is CKII; however, this phosphorylation has no effect on ODC activity. Thus, it appears that regulation of ODC activity and stability by phosphorylation is mediated by as yet unidentified protein kinases. The identity of the phosphorylated amino acid residues of ODC that regulate its intracellular stability and catalytic capacity is under investigation.

Putrescine, the product of ODC catalysis, and the subsequent metabolic pathway products spermidine and spermine are small aliphatic nitrogenous bases that fulfill structural and regulatory roles in protein and nucleic acid biosynthesis and function (1Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 749-790Google Scholar). Cellular ODC activity increases rapidly and transiently in response to trophic, proliferative, or toxic stimuli (2Pegg A.E. McCann P.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 243: C212-C221Google Scholar). Both somatic cell genetic and pharmacologic experimental approaches have demonstrated that expression of ODC is essential for cell growth. Regulation of enzyme expression at the levels of DNA transcription, mRNA translation, and protein turnover have been described (for reviews, see 3Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 759-774Google Scholar and 4Kameji T. Hayashi S. Hoshino K. Kakinuma Y. Igarashi K. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 581-586Google Scholar). However, little is known about potential posttranslational regulation of ODC.Multiple forms of ODC protein occur in a variety of cells and tissues. Anion exchange chromatography resolves several peaks of ODC activity in extracts prepared from calf liver (5Haddox M.K. Russell D.H. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6721-6729Google Scholar), rat thymus and kidney (6Richards J.F. Lit K. Fuca R. Bourgeault C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 105: 1189-1197Google Scholar). IEF analysis of ODC isolated from HTC cells (9Mitchell J.L.A. Rynning M.D. Chen H.J. Hicks M.F. Arch. Biochem.

Biochem. 1994; 281: 149-156Google Scholar) shows that multiple isoelectric forms of ODC protein are present. ODC is phosphorylated in situ in murine macrophage-derived, Abelson virus-transformed RAW264 cells (13Reich D.J. Worth L.L. Haddox M.K. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 935aGoogle Scholar), Friend erythroleukemia cells (14Flamigni F. Marmiroli S. Meggio F. Guarnieri C. Penna L.A. Biochim. Biophys.

A consensus sequence for casein kinase II (CKII)-catalyzed phosphorylation is conserved in the eucaryotic ODC amino acid sequence around serine 303 (18Kahana C. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1673-1677Google Scholar, 19van-Kranen H.J. van-de-Zande L. van-Kreijl C.J. Bisschop A. Wieeringa B. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 60: 145-155Google Scholar, 20Hickok N.J. Seppanen P.J.

Acta. 1987; 929: 114-116Google Scholar), with a Km similar to that of its other cellular substrates (22Tipnis U.K. Haddox M.K. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1990; 36: 275-289Google Scholar); however, this phosphorylation has no effect on ODC activity. Only radiolabeled phosphoserine residues were detected in ODC isolated from metabolically radiolabeled 653-1 (15Rosenburg-Hasson Y. Strumpf D. Kahana C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 419-424Google Scholar), EXOD-1 (16Kanamoto R. Kameji T. Iwashita S. Igarashi K. Hayashi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9393-9399Google Scholar), and DH23b cells (17Mitchell J.L.A. Hoff J.A. Bareyal-Leyser A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 290: 143-152Google Scholar). Rosenberg-Hasson et al. (15Rosenburg-Hasson Y. Strumpf D. Kahana C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 419-424Google Scholar) reported that in COS-7 cells transiently transfected with wild type and Ser303→ Ala mutant ODC expression vectors, serine 303 is the major (if not the only) amino acid residue phosphorylated on the enzyme protein. Furthermore, mutation of ODC serine 303 to alanine had no effect on the cellular ODC protein half-life or enzyme activity.In contrast, our preliminary findings indicated that RAW264 cell ODC phosphorylated in situ has a greater catalytic capacity than the native form of the enzyme (24Worth L.L. Haddox M.K. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 107: 855aGoogle Scholar). We have previously shown that ODC is phosphorylated in RAW264 cells on both serine and threonine residues (25Worth L.L. Cochran B.J. Haddox M.K. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3967-3970Google Scholar). These findings led us to question whether ODC was subject to phosphorylation in RAW264 cells at additional sites to that phosphorylated by CKII. In this report we demonstrate by comparative two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping and phosphoamino acid analysis that in the RAW264 cell line ODC is phosphorylated on at least three amino acid residues in addition to that phosphorylated by CKII. We also conducted studies to investigate the significance of intracellular phosphorylation of ODC in RAW264 cells. The results demonstrate two functional consequences of the in situ phosphorylation of ODC. The phosphorylated form of the enzyme was more resistant to proteolysis in situ than the unphosphorylated form. In addition, kinetic analysis demonstrated that the purified phosphorylated form of ODC has a higher catalytic capacity than the purified unphosphorylated form of the enzyme."

Here we show that mutant RlSem protein, immunoprecipitated from transiently transfected COS cells, exhibits a moderate increase in kinase activity compared with wild-type Rl protein. Time course studies revealed that RlSem is more active than Rl following short term as well as prolonged treatment with epidermal growth factor. Interestingly, a more pronounced difference in kinase activity is observed when the proteins are immunoprecipitated from extracts of Drosophila rl and rlSem larvae. In fact, the kinase activity of RlSem from larvae extracts is comparable to the kinase activity of larvae expressing either an activated Sevenless receptor or an activated Raf kinase.

The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 1The abbreviations used are: MAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseDmERKADrosophila melanogaster ERKAMAPKKmitogen-activated protein kinase kinaseGSTglutathione S-transferaseMBPmyelin basic proteinEGFepidermal growth factor. cascade is a major signaling system by which cells translate extracellular signals into intracellular responses. The mammalian extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) are the best studied members of the MAP kinase family (for reviews, see 1Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1994; 4: 82-89Google Scholar and 2Nishida E. Gotoh Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 128-131Google Scholar). They are activated by phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine residues by dual specificity MAPK kinases (MAPKKs). On activation, MAP kinases translocate to the nucleus (3Chen R.H. Sarnecki C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 915-927Google Scholar) and activate transcription factors through phosphorylation of serine or threonine residues in the motif P/LXT/SP. One of the best characterized target proteins of MAPK is the ternary complex factor ELK-1, which is phosphorylated by MAP kinases in vitro on sites essential for trans-activation by the serum response element on the c-fos promotor in vivo (4Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 381-393Google Scholar, 5Janknecht R. Ernst W.H. Pengoud V. Nordheim A.

Many steps of the MAP kinase cascade are conserved in different species, and homologous components have been identified in mammals, yeast, Drosophila melanogaster, and Caenorhabditis elegans. In Drosophila, for example, the specification of the R7 photoreceptor cell fate in each ommatidium of the developing eye is dependent on the components of the MAP kinase cascade. In the R7 precursor cells the Sevenless (Sev) receptor tyrosine kinase is activated by its ligand, the Bride-of-sevenless (Boss) protein. The signal is then transduced via Drk (an SH3-SH2-SH3 adaptor protein, homologous to Grb2), Sos, Ras1, and the protein kinases Raf, Dsor1 (MAPKK), and Rl (MAPK) to the nucleus (reviewed in 6Hafen E. Dickson B. Raabe T. Brunner D. Oellers N. van der Straten A. Development. 1993; : 41-46Google Scholar and 7Zipursky L.S. Rubin G.M. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 373-397Google Scholar). A gain-of-function mutation in the rl gene, rlSem, was identified in a genetic screen for dominant mutations that result in the specification of R7 cells in the absence of the inducing signal, the Boss ligand. This dominant mutation is caused by a single amino acid substitution (D334N) in the catalytic domain of the kinase (8Brunner D. Oellers N. Szabad J. Biggs III, W.H. Zipursky S.L. Hafen E. Cell. 1994; 76: 875-888Google Scholar). Interestingly, this mutation not only activates the Sev pathway in the developing eye but also induces the formation of additional wing veins and causes female sterility mimicking the activation of the Drosophila EGF receptor homologue (DER) and Torso receptor tyrosine kinases, respectively. Therefore, Rl function is not only necessary but also sufficient to activate multiple receptor tyrosine kinase pathways in Drosophila. The homologue of the MAP kinase activating kinase (MAPKK) encoded by the Dsor1 gene is also required for multiple developmental pathways (9Tsuda L. Inoue Y.H. Yoo M.A. Mizuno M. Hata M. Lim Y.M. Adachi-Yamada T. Ryo H. Masamune Y. Nishida Y. Cell. 1993; 72: 407-414Google Scholar). Using a temperature-sensitive mutation in Dsor1, Hsu and Perrimon (10Hsu J.C. Perrimon N. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2176-2187Google Scholar) showed that Dsor1 operates like rl in the pathways controlled by Torso, DER, and Sev. Two nuclear target genes have been shown genetically to act downstream of rl in the Sev pathway, pointed P2 (pntP2) and yan, encoding two members of the ETS family of transcription factors (11Brunner D. Dücker K. Oellers N. Hafen E. Scholz H. Klämbt C. Nature. 1994; 370: 386-389Google Scholar, 12O'Neill E.M. Rebay I. Tjian R. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1994; 78: 137-147Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that wild-type Rl directly phosphorylates Yan and PntP2 in vitro (11Brunner D. Dücker K. Oellers N. Hafen E. Scholz H. Klämbt C. Nature. 1994; 370: 386-389Google Scholar). The ordering of the individual components in the Sev pathway has been determined largely by constructing double mutants of different members of the cascade to examine epistatic relationships between the different gene products. Although this type of genetic analysis allows ordering of individual components by functional criteria, it does not imply direct physical interactions, nor does it reveal the biochemical mechanisms by which the signals are transduced. To investigate the biochemical properties of the first identified gain-of-function mutation in a MAP kinase gene, rlSem, we examined the kinase activity of the corresponding mutant protein, immunoprecipitated from transfected COS cell lysates and Drosophila larvae extracts. We demonstrate that RlSem, expressed in mammalian COS cells or purified from bacteria, is 2-3-fold more active than wild-type Rl. However, when isolated from Drosophila larvae, RlSem exhibited a 5-9-fold higher kinase activity than Rl. In addition we present evidence that Dsor1 is a direct activator of Rl in vitro. The entire coding region of rl and rlkd (corresponding to rlK67M/D334N in 8Brunner D. Oellers N. Szabad J. Biggs III, W.H. Zipursky S.L. Hafen E. Cell. 1994; 76: 875-888Google Scholar) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, subcloned as BamHI-EcoRI fragments into the pGEX2T vector and expressed exactly as described for the GST fusion proteins Rl, PntP2, PntP2T151A and Yan-A (8Brunner D. Oellers N. Szabad J. Biggs III, W.H. Zipursky S.L. Hafen E. Cell. 1994; 76: 875-888Google Scholar). Mammalian GST-MAPKK fusion protein was provided by Sally Cowley (Chester Beatty Laboratories, London, United Kingdom) and the pGEX1-Yan-A construct was provided by Gerry Rubin (University of California, Berkeley, CA) (13Lai Z.-C. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1992; 70: 609-620Google Scholar). Wild-type and mutant forms of rl were cloned as Asp718-EcoRI fragments into the mammalian, SV40-based cell culture vector pMT21 (Genetics Institute). To construct pMT21-rl-myc and its mutant derivatives, a polymerase chain reaction fragment was generated using a reverse primer that deleted the natural termination codon and added an additional sequence encoding the amino acids of the Myc epitope (GGEQKLISEEDL) followed by a termination codon and a XhoI recognition site. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to generate the constitutively activated (Dsor1act) and kinase-defective (Dsor1kd) mutants of Dsor1 (wild-type Dsor1 cDNA was provided by Y. Nishida, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, Nagoya, Japan). To generate Dsor1act, the oligonucleotide 5′-GGTGCCCACAAATTCGTTGGCCATCTCGTCGATCAGTTG-3′ (antisense) was used to introduce AG to CT nucleotide changes at positions 1755 and 1756 of the genomic Dsor1 DNA sequence (GenBank sequence D 13782), altering Ser234 to a Glu codon and to introduce AGG to CTT nucleotide changes at positions 1767-1769, altering Ser238 to a Glu codon. The Asp224 codon was mutated to an Ala codon to generate the Dsor1kd mutant by introducing a single T to G nucleotide change at position 1726 of the genomic Dsor1 DNA sequence, using the following oligonucleotide: 5′-GGAGACGCCGAAAGCACAGATCTTGAT-3′ (antisense). In each case the presence of the mutated sequence was confirmed by sequencing. The entire coding regions of wild-type and mutant Dsor1 cDNA fragments were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, using a primer containing a 5′-BamHI recognition sequence, and subcloned as BamHI fragments into the T7 promotor-containing pET3a expression vector (14Studier F.W. Moffat B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Google Scholar). For protein expression, these plasmids were transformed into the Escherichia coli strain Bl21 (DE3) PLysS, and the recombinant proteins were expressed and purified as described (15Oellers N. Dehio M. Knust E. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1994; 244: 465-473Google Scholar, 16Kerkhoff E. Bister K. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 93-102Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Transfections were carried out as described previously (17Howe L.R. Leevers S.J. Gómez N. Nakielny S. Cohen P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1992; 71: 335-342Google Scholar). In brief, transient transfections were performed by the DEAE-dextran method, and cells were starved in serum-free DMEM 16 h before harvesting. Where indicated, cells were stimulated with EGF (10 ng/ml) for 10 min immediately prior to cell harvesting. Cells were washed twice in ice-cold Tris-buffered saline, scraped off the plate, and lysed for 10 min on ice in 20 mM Tris (pH 8), 40 mM Na4P2O7, 50 mM NaF, 5 mM MgCl2, 100 μM Na3VO4, 10 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 3 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (S buffer). Cells were centrifuged for 10 min at 4°C, and supernatants were stored at −70°C. 40 μg of protein from each COS-1 cell lysate was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting to detect the slow-migrating, phosphorylated form of MAPK. In detail, after electrophoresis proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, blots were blocked in 5% nonfat dried milk in TBST (10 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h and then probed with 9E10 monoclonal antibody (BAbCO), diluted 1:3000 in blocking buffer, for 1 h. After washing in TBST and incubating with goat anti-mouse serum coupled with horseradish peroxidase (diluted 1:15000 in TBST), for 1 h, the blots were washed extensively and developed using the ECL detection system (Amersham Corp.). COS-1 cells were transfected with wild-type and mutant Rl constructs, serum deprived, EGF stimulated, and lysed as described above. The lysates, containing equal amounts of MAPK protein, were incubated for 1.5 h at 4°C with rotation in the presence of monoclonal antibody 9E10 prebound to protein G Sepharose beads (Sigma). The beads were washed two times with S buffer (without phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), once with 30 mM Tris (pH 8), and once with kinase buffer (30 mM Tris (pH 8), 20 mM MgCl2, and 2 mM MnCl2). Each immunoprecipitate was incubated for 30 min at 30°C in kinase buffer containing 10 μM unlabeled ATP, 7.5 μg of MBP and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and the reactions were terminated by adding SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer. Incorporation of 32P into MBP was quantified by running the samples on 15% polyacrylamide gels, transferring to nitrocellulose, autoradiography, scanning into a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics), and analyzing the intensity of each band using ImageQuant Software. To analyze MAPK activity in Drosophila larvae extracts, 20 third instar larvae for each genotype were homogenized in S buffer and centrifuged for 10 min at 4°C. The extracts, split into two, were incubated for 1.5 h at 4°C with rotation in the presence of Rl-specific polyclonal DmERKA antibody (18Biggs W.H. Zipursky S.L. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6295-6299Google Scholar), precoated to protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma). Kinase assays on the immunoprecipitates were performed as described above. Where indicated, heat shocks were applied for 1 h at 37°C, followed by 2 h of recovering at 25°C prior to homogenization. Kinase assays with bacterially expressed recombinant Rl, Yan-A, and mammalian MAPKK proteins were carried out as described previously (11Brunner D. Dücker K. Oellers N. Hafen E. Scholz H. Klämbt C. Nature. 1994; 370: 386-389Google Scholar). Different combinations of wild-type, activated, and kinase-inactive versions of recombinant Dsor1 and Rl proteins were subjected to kinase reactions, which were carried out essentially as described previously (11Brunner D. Dücker K. Oellers N. Hafen E. Scholz H. Klämbt C. Nature. 1994; 370: 386-389Google Scholar), using MBP as a substrate. To study the biochemical properties of Rl and Dsor1, eukaryotic and bacterial expression vectors encoding wild-type, activated, and inactive versions of these proteins were generated. A kinase-inactive version of RlSem was generated by changing Lys67 in the putative ATP-binding site to Met (Rlkd (kinase defective)), and a kinase-inactive Dsor1 was generated by changing Asp224 of the conserved protein kinase motif Asp-Phe-Gly (19Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Google Scholar) to Ala (Dsor1kd). To generate an active version of Dsor1, Ser234 and Ser238, analogous to those sites that are phosphorylated to activate mammalian MAPKK, were changed to Glu (Dsor1act), thus introducing a negative charge at these sites in an attempt to mimic phosphorylation (20Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Google Scholar, 21Alessi D.R. Saito Y. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Sitanandam G. Rapp U. Ashworth A. Marshall C.J. Cowley S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1610-1619Google Scholar). The activated version of Rl, RlSem, was identified genetically as a dominant gain-of-function mutation and was shown to result in a single amino acid substitution (Asp334→ Asn) in kinase domain XI (8Brunner D. Oellers N. Szabad J. Biggs III, W.H. Zipursky S.L. Hafen E. Cell. 1994; 76: 875-888Google Scholar). To easily distinguish and purify recombinant proteins, a sequence encoding an epitope from the c-Myc protein, recognized by the 9E10 monoclonal antibody (22Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsey G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Google Scholar), was fused to the 3′-end of wild-type and mutant Rl coding sequences. Fig. 1 shows a schematic diagram of the proteins analyzed in this study. To investigate the biochemical properties of Rl and RlSem, we took advantage of the well established growth factor induction system of mammalian tissue culture and investigated phosphorylation and activation of these proteins. We transiently transfected COS-1 cells with expression vectors encoding wild-type and mutant Rl, harvested from either quiescent or EGF-stimulated cells, and subjected the corresponding cell lysates to Western blot analysis using the 9E10 anti-Myc antibody. Wild-type, kinase-inactive (Rlkd), and activated (RlSem) versions of Rl were phosphorylated in lysates of EGF-stimulated cells, as indicated by a band of reduced electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 2A). This suggests that Rl is phosphorylated in this heterologous COS cell system in an EGF-dependent manner, presumably by endogenous MAPKK. Similar results were obtained by immunostaining with an anti-Rl polyclonal antibody (DmERKA; 18Biggs W.H. Zipursky S.L. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6295-6299Google Scholar), which specifically detects Drosophila Rl and not the endogenous mammalian MAPK protein (data not shown). To measure the activity of wild-type and mutant Rl kinases, COS-1 cells were transfected with the corresponding constructs and stimulated with EGF. Rl proteins were immunoprecipitated from lysates of these cells, and their ability to phosphorylate myelin basic protein (MBP, a standard MAPK substrate) was determined. Immunoprecipitates from cells transfected with the empty vector or expressing the kinase-inactive mutant (Rlkd) exhibited no MBP kinase activity. In contrast, EGF-stimulated Rl as well as RlSem showed kinase activity, measured by incorporation of radioactive phosphate into MBP (Fig. 2B). The activated RlSem was 2-3-fold more active than wild-type Rl on EGF stimulation, a difference that was consistently observed in duplicate experiments and was not due to differences in the expression level of the two forms of Rl. In the absence of EGF stimulation, RlSem exhibits a slightly higher intrinsic kinase activity than wild-type Rl, visible only after prolonged exposure times (see below). To elucidate potential differences in the mode of action of Rl and RlSem, we analyzed their activity following EGF treatment over a more extensive time course (Fig. 3). The activation of Rl is triphasic, with a first phase peaking at 5 min, a second phase peaking at about 30 min, and a third broad phase with a peak at 2 h followed by a slow decline to basal levels at 9 h after the initial addition of EGF. For mammalian MAPK, a similar activity was reported with a first peak at 5 min and a second peak about 3 h after EGF treatment (23Meloche S. Seuwen K. Pagès G. Pouysségur J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 845-854Google Scholar, 24Lenormand P. Sardet C. Pagès G. L'Allemain G. Brunet A. Pouysségur J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 1079-1088Google Scholar). In contrast, the activation of RlSem seems to be only monophasic. The activation reaches its peak at about 5 min and is 2-3-fold higher than Rl, as we have shown before. Then the activity continuously declines to near basal levels after 9 h. Notably, throughout this time course, the activity of RlSem is consistently higher than that of Rl. In the experiments described above, we have examined the kinase activity of Rl toward the artificial substrate MBP. It is possible, however, that the rlSem mutation affects the substrate specificity of MAP kinase. Therefore, we wanted to test whether Rl and RlSem behave differently toward their natural substrates. We have demonstrated previously that pntP2 and yan, two genes encoding nuclear factors that, like ELK-1, belong to the ETS domain family of transcription factors, act downstream of rl in the Sev pathway. We showed that wild-type Rl phosphorylates Yan and PntP2 in vitro (11Brunner D. Dücker K. Oellers N. Hafen E. Scholz H. Klämbt C. Nature. 1994; 370: 386-389Google Scholar). To extend these in vitro studies, we generated and expressed recombinant wild-type and mutant Rl proteins fused to GST and performed kinase assays using bacterially expressed PntP2 and Yan-A as substrates. Rl and RlSem were able to phosphorylate Yan (Fig. 4) and PntP2 (data not shown) in the presence of activated mammalian MAPKK (a kind gift from Sally Cowley and Chris Marshall, Chester Beatty Laboratories), whereas kinase-inactive Rlkd showed no activity. RlSem exhibited 2-3-fold higher activity toward PntP2 and Yan than Rl. This difference is similar to that observed in assays using MBP as a substrate (Fig. 2B). It is noteworthy here that RlSem exhibited weak intrinsic kinase activity toward Yan that was observed in the absence of activated MAPKK (Fig. 4). So far we have shown that mammalian MAPKK is able to phosphorylate Drosophila Rl kinase in COS cells. The Drosophila homologue of MAPKK, Dsor1, has been shown genetically to act in several different receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated pathways in Drosophila. By analogy to the function of MAPKK as a direct activator of MAPK in vertebrates, Dsor1 is believed to act upstream of rl. There is, however, neither genetic nor biochemical evidence demonstrating that Dsor1 directly activates Rl. Therefore, we wanted to test whether Dsor1 is able to phosphorylate and activate Rl in vitro. We expressed bacterial fusion proteins of a putatively activated and kinase-defective version of Dsor1 (see above), analogous to the mutations made in mammalian MAPKK (21Alessi D.R. Saito Y. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Sitanandam G. Rapp U. Ashworth A. Marshall C.J. Cowley S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1610-1619Google Scholar). We carried out MBP kinase assays with bacterially expressed Dsor1 and Rl mutant versions in different combinations. Only the activated version of Dsor1, (Dsor1act) was able to phosphorylate and activate Rl and RlSem in vitro (Fig. 5). Wild-type Dsor1 and kinase-inactive Dsor1 (Dsor1kd) did not exhibit any kinase activity. Experiments were also performed using PntP2 and Yan as substrates for the kinase assays, and similar results were obtained (data not shown). These results demonstrate that Dsor1 directly activates Rl in vitro. Surprised by the marginal differences in kinase activity of Rl and RlSem in vitro, considering the relatively strong effects of this mutation in vivo, we decided to investigate biochemically the activity of Rl- and RlSem kinase isolated from Drosophila larvae. Protein extracts were prepared from larvae of different genotypes and immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal Rl-specific antibody, and their MBP kinase activity was determined. We used wild-type (+/+) larvae containing two copies of the rl gene, rlSem/+ larvae containing one copy of rlSem and a wild-type copy of rl and, also rlSem/rl10a larvae containing only one copy of rlSem, since the rl10a allele represents a deficiency for the entire rl locus. MAP kinase activity was detected in all extracts (Fig. 6). RlSem/+ extracts showed 5-6-fold higher activity and rlSem/rl10a showed 8-9-fold higher stimulation than wild-type extracts. Wild-type and mutant kinases showed the same kinetics. The kinase assays were linear with respect to incubation time, the amount of immunoprecipitated protein, and the amount of added substrate protein (data not shown). As a control, we also heat shocked larvae of the genotype rlD334N/+, transformants carrying the Sem mutation (8Brunner D. Oellers N. Szabad J. Biggs III, W.H. Zipursky S.L. Hafen E. Cell. 1994; 76: 875-888Google Scholar), immunoprecipitated Rl, and determined MBP kinase activity. These extracts exhibited 4-5-fold higher kinase activity than wild-type extracts, exactly matching the activity of rlSem/+ extracts. These experiments demonstrate that the difference between wild-type Rl and RlSem kinase activity in larvae is significantly more pronounced than in heterologous systems. The higher activity in rlSem/rl10a (only one copy of rlSem) than in rlSem/+ (one copy of rl and one copy of rlSem) is consistent with our genetic data. We have shown previously that the phenotype of rlSem is enhanced in the absence of one copy of the wild-type rl gene (8Brunner D. Oellers N. Szabad J. Biggs III, W.H. Zipursky S.L. Hafen E. Cell. 1994; 76: 875-888Google Scholar). To analyze the activity of endogenous Rl in larvae in which the MAP kinase pathway was activated by upstream components, we prepared lysates from larvae expressing activated forms of raf (raftorY9; 25Dickson B. Sprenger F. Morrison D. Hafen E. Nature. 1992; 360: 600-603Google Scholar) and Sev (SevS11; 26). The larvae were heat shocked for 1 h at 37°C to induce ubiquitous expression of the corresponding transgenes; then Rl was immunoprecipitated, and MBP kinase activity was determined. On heat shock induction, Rl, immunoprecipitated from raftorY9 and SevS11 extracts, was 9- and 4-fold more active, respectively, than Rl immunoprecipitated from wild-type extracts (Fig. 6). Consistent with our genetic analysis of rlSem, it seems that the increase in kinase activity, generated by the Sem point mutation, is comparable with that generated by constitutive activation of upstream signaling molecules. The genetic characterization of the rlSem gain-of-function mutation demonstrated that Rl plays an essential role in various developmental pathways in Drosophila. It did not permit insight, however, into the mechanisms by which the rlSem mutation affects the biochemical properties of MAP kinase in vivo. Here we have shown that RlSem, isolated from COS-1 cells or bacteria, possesses only weakly enhanced intrinsic kinase activity toward the generic substrate MBP and its natural substrates PntP2 and Yan. Both, wild-type and mutant Rl proteins are phosphorylated, and their kinase activity is stimulated by endogenous mammalian or recombinant Drosophila MAPKK, although phosphorylated RlSem kinase is 2-3-fold more active than the wild-type Rl protein. Similar results have been reported for mammalian ERK2, containing the same mutation in the homologous position. D319N ERK2 exhibits 2-fold higher kinase activity on EGF stimulation in comparison with wild-type ERK2 (27Bott C.M. Thorneycroft S.G. Marshall C.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 201-205Google Scholar). In Xenopus, injection of RlSem mRNA and also of ERKSem mRNA (p44 MAPK carrying the corresponding D to N exchange) into embryos was sufficient to induce the expression of brachyury (Xbra), an immediate early mesoderm response gene (28LaBonne C. Burke B. Whitman M. Development. 1995; 121: 1475-1486Google Scholar, 29Umbhauer M. Marshall C.J. Mason C.S. Old R.W. Smith J.C. Nature. 1995; 376: 58-62Google Scholar). Therefore, it appears that this point mutation in the kinase subdomain XI has a conserved effect on different members of the MAP kinase family. There are a number of possibilities why RlSem is more active on stimulation than the wild-type protein. The D334N mutation in RlSem could affect the subcellular localization of the protein and thus its accessibility to activating or inactivating signals. However, in immunofluorescence studies we did not observe a difference in the subcellular localization of wild-type and mutant proteins in Drosophila imaginal discs 2D. Brunner, personal communication. or when expressed in COS-1 cells (data not shown). Alternatively, the enhanced kinase activity of RlSem could be due to an increased affinity toward its physiological substrates. However, the difference in activity of RlSem kinase compared with wild-type Rl was similar for both its natural substrates, PntP2 and Yan, and for the artificial substrate MBP. This implies that RlSem does not possess a noticeably altered substrate specificity. Another explanation for the increased activity is that RlSem is inactivated at a reduced rate, resulting in more persistent activity. It has been shown that mammalian ERK2, carrying the Sem mutation (D319N ERK2), is more resistant to the action of the MAP kinase-specific phosphatase CL100 than wild-type MAPK (27Bott C.M. Thorneycroft S.G. Marshall C.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 201-205Google Scholar). The results of our time course experiments also promote this hypothesis. We showed that the activation of Rl is triphasic in response to EGF stimulation in COS cells. A rapid activation occurring at 5 min, a short decline at 20 min, and a second activation at 30 min with a minimum at 1 h is followed by a broader wave with a peak at about 2 h after stimulation. A similar, but only biphasic, activation was already reported for mammalian MAPK in CCL39 cells, a hamster fibroblast cell line, showing a fast activation at 5 min and a broader phase at about 3 h after EGF stimulation (23Meloche S. Seuwen K. Pagès G. Pouysségur J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 845-854Google Scholar, 24Lenormand P. Sardet C. Pagès G. L'Allemain G. Brunet A. Pouysségur J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 1079-1088Google Scholar). In contrast, the activation of RlSem seems to be only monophasic. It peaks at about 5 min and then continuously declines to near basal levels. Throughout this time course the activity of RlSem is consistently higher than that of Rl. It is interesting to note that the duration of MAP kinase activation has been postulated as the determinative factor in the decision between differentiation and proliferation in PC12 pheochromocytoma cells. Stimulation of PC12 cells with EGF results in a transient activation of MAP kinase and induces proliferation, whereas NGF stimulation, also mediated by the Ras-Raf pathway, results in a persistent activation of MAP kinase and induces neurite outgrowth (30; for review, see 31Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Google Scholar). In mutant rlSem flies, the phenotypes observed are related to changes in differentiation, such as the excess recruitment of R7 cells, differentiation of additional wing veins, and suppression of the differentiation of the segmented trunk region of the embryo. RlSem does not affect the proliferation of cells, although rl is clearly required for cell proliferation (32Diaz-Benjumea F.J. Hafen E. Development. 1994; 120: 569-578Google Scholar). The more persistent activity of rlSem may preferentially trigger differentiation as opposed to proliferation. In Drosophila larval extracts the kinase activity of RlSem in comparison with wild-type Rl is considerably higher than observed in EGF-stimulated COS-1 cells or when isolated from bacteria. In fact, the level of activity was comparable to that observed in protein extracts of larvae expressing an activated Sev or Raf kinase. The activity was highest in rlSem/rl10a larval extracts (8-9-fold), in which the wild-type rl allele is missing, corroborating genetic data showing that the phenotype of rlSem is enhanced in the absence of the wild-type copy of the rl gene (8Brunner D. Oellers N. Szabad J. Biggs III, W.H. Zipursky S.L. Hafen E. Cell. 1994; 76: 875-888Google Scholar). The question arises why in Drosophila extracts the difference in kinase activity of Rl and RlSem is higher than in heterologous systems. It is possible that the resistance of RlSem to inactivation by phosphatases is more pronounced in larval extracts than in COS cells. In addition, genetic experiments suggest that the activity of RlSem is dependent on components acting upstream in the pathway. Sos and Ras1 act as dominant suppressors of the rlSem phenotype. 3D. Brunner and E. Hafen, manuscript in preparation. In this respect the behavior of rlSem differs from other gain-of-function mutations in the Sev pathway. For instance, the recruitment of additional R7 cells in flies carrying a gain-of-function mutation in sev is not suppressed by mutations in boss, which codes for the Sev ligand. The dependence of RlSem on upstream components suggests that some sort of feedback loop is important in maintaining RlSem activation. Here we have shown biochemically that RlSem can respond to activating signals with increased activity, which is consistent with the hypothesis of a positive feedback loop. Furthermore, this feedback loop may explain how, even in the absence of an inducing signal, the basal activity of the signaling cascade is sufficient to activate RlSem above a threshold required for eliciting certain cellular responses, such as R7 differentiation in the eye, vein formation in the wing, and suppression of segmentation in the embryo. Therefore, the slight increase in kinase activity may be sufficient to trigger this feedback loop and the activation of various differentiation pathways. A task for the future is to prove the existence of such a feedback loop in vivo. The genetic characterization of second site mutations that suppress or enhance the dominant phenotype of the rlSem mutation should lead to the identification of further components acting in concert with rlSem in the signal transduction pathway.

https://openalex.org/W1998857939,"Genetic studies revealed that DNA gyrase seems to catalyze immediate and transient DNA relaxation after Escherichia coli cells are exposed to heat shock (Ogata, Y., Mizushima, T., Kataoka, K., Miki, T., and Sekimizu, K. (1994) Mol. Gen. Genet. 244, 451-455). We have now obtained biochemical evidence to support this hypothesis. DNA gyrase catalyzed an increase in the linking number of DNA and relaxation of negatively supercoiled DNA, under physiological concentrations of ATP. Analyses by gel filtration chromatography of each subunit revealed that DNA relaxation activity co-migrated with each subunit. The linking number of DNA increased as the temperature increased. Further, the reaction was inhibited by nalidixic acid or by oxolinic acid. Based on these results, we propose that DNA gyrase participates in a concerted reaction with DNA topoisomerases in the immediate relaxation of DNA in cells exposed to heat shock."
https://openalex.org/W2105460208,"Cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating the activity of the sodium pump or Na,K-ATPase during proliferation of hepatocytes following 70% liver resection have not been defined. Na,K-ATPase may be regulated by synthesis of its α- and β-subunits, by sorting to either the sinusoidal or apical plasma membrane domains, or by increasing membrane lipid fluidity. This study investigated the time course of changes during hepatic regeneration for Na,K-ATPase activity, lipid composition and fluidity, and protein content of liver plasma membrane subfractions. As early as 4 h after hepatic resection, Na,K-ATPase activity was increased selectively in the bile canalicular fraction. It reached a new steady state at 12 h and remained elevated for 2 days. Although hepatic regeneration was associated with a reduced cholesterol/phospholipid molar ratio and increased fluidity, measured with two different probes, these changes in lipid metabolism were in the sinusoidal membrane domain. The Na,K-ATPase β1-subunit, but not the α1-subunit, was increased selectively at the bile canalicular surface as shown by immunoblotting of liver plasma membrane subfractions and the morphological demonstration at both the light and electron microscopic levels. Furthermore, cycloheximide blocked the rise in β1-subunit mRNA levels. Since the time course for β1-subunit accumulation was similar to that for activation of Na,K-ATPase activity, this change implicated the β1-subunit in activating sodium pump activity."

In vitro studies have indicated that the C hnRNP proteins bind particularly strongly to the intron polypyrimidine tract of pre-mRNA and may be important for pre-mRNA splicing. In addition, there is evidence that the interaction of the C hnRNP proteins with pre-mRNA is facilitated by the U1 and U2 small nuclear RNPs (snRNPs). In the present study, we have uncovered another feature of the C hnRNP proteins that may provide a unifying framework for these previous observations; the C hnRNP proteins bind to the 5′ stem-loop of the U2 snRNP. This was detected by incubating human 32P-labeled U2 snRNP in micrococcal nuclease-treated HeLa nuclear extracts, followed by UV-mediated protein-RNA cross-linking, which revealed that C hnRNP proteins were cross-linked to 32P-nucleotides in the U2 snRNP. In similar experiments, no cross-linking of C hnRNP proteins to 32P-labeled U1 or U4 snRNPs was observed. The observed cross-linking of C hnRNP proteins to U2 snRNP was efficiently competed by excess U2 RNA and by poly(U) but not by poly(A). No competition was observed with an RNA molecule comprising U2 nucleotides 105-189, indicating that the C hnRNP protein interactive regions of U2 RNA reside solely in the 5′ half of the molecule. Oligodeoxynucleotide-mediated RNase H cleavage experiments revealed that a 5′ region of U2 RNA including nucleotides 15-28 is essential for the observed C hnRNP protein cross-linking. C hnRNP protein cross-linking to U2 snRNP was efficiently competed by a mini-RNA corresponding to the first 29 nucleotides of U2 RNA, whereas no competition was observed with a variant of this mini-RNA in which the UUUU loop of stem-loop I was mutationally configured into a single-stranded RNA by replacing the stem with non-pairing nucleotides. Competition experiments with another mutant mini-U2 RNA in which the UUUU loop was replaced by AAAA indicated that both the UUUU loop and the stem are important for C hnRNP protein cross-linking, a finding consistent with other recent data on the RNA sequence specificity of C hnRNP protein binding.

In this study, we have assessed peptide binding to TAP and MHC class I in purified microsomes derived from wild-type, TAP1−/−, β2m−/−, and TAP1/β2m−/− mice using a cross-linkable H-2Kb-binding peptide. This enabled us to study the influence of an intact TAP complex and β2m on peptide binding to MHC class I and to analyze the stepwise interaction of peptide with TAP and MHC class I molecules. Peptide bound both immature and mature (terminally glycosylated) class I molecules in intact as well as permeabilized microsomes from wild-type mice. Efficient peptide binding to immature class I molecules was also detected in permeabilized microsomes from TAP1−/− mice. In contrast, no peptide binding to β2m-free HC was detected in permeabilized microsomes from β2m−/− and TAP1/β2m−/− mice. However, the addition of exogenous β2m allowed peptide binding to class I in permeabilized β2m−/− and TAP1/β2m−/− microsomes. These results demonstrate that a preformed class I HC·β2m heterodimer is necessary for efficient peptide binding under physiological conditions. The observed peptide binding to class I in permeabilized TAP1−/− microsomes further suggests that TAP1 is not required for peptide binding to class I in the ER. Finally, kinetic studies allowed the demonstration of a stepwise binding of peptide to TAP, subsequent translocation across the ER membrane, a step that required ATP hydrolysis, and binding of peptide to preformed class I HC·β2m heterodimers."
https://openalex.org/W2140981628,"Three proximal elements, PER1, PER2, and PER3, have been implicated in the regulation of peripherin gene expression. PER1 contains the TATA motif and was identified as the principal mediator of neuronal specificity. Here, we demonstrate by transfection of constructs mutated in PER1 that the in vitro protein binding activity of PER1 is irrelevant to its function. However, mutations or substitutions in the TATA box decreased promoter activity by up to 80%. We have investigated this unusual preference for a particular TATA sequence in PC12 cells. In these cells, nerve growth factor induces neuronal differentiation, increasing peripherin gene expression 3-4-fold, while dexamethasone elicits chromaffin differentiation and a 3-fold decrease in peripherin mRNA. Experiments with stably transfected PC12 cells revealed that the specific TATA box of the peripherin gene was crucial for nerve growth factor response. However, it did not affect dexamethasone down-regulation. Therefore, nerve growth factor acts through an element essential for neuronal peripherin gene expression. The results predict that proteins interacting in the vicinity of the TATA box, by inference factors associated with the preinitiation complex, are important for peripherin gene regulation and provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying neuronal differentiation.

The results predict that proteins interacting in the vicinity of the TATA box, by inference factors associated with the preinitiation complex, are important for peripherin gene regulation and provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying neuronal differentiation. The regulation of genes expressed exclusively in neurons is not well understood. A large number of neuronal regulatory genes have been identified but little is known about their targets and their roles in differentiation of particular types of neurons. To study this problem, we have chosen peripherin, a type III intermediate filament protein (1Thompson M.A. Ziff E.B. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1043-1053Google Scholar). The peripherin gene provides several advantages for studies of neural specific gene expression. Like most other IF proteins, its expression is both tissue-specific and developmentally regulated (for a review, see 2van de Klundert F.A. Raats J.M. Bloemendal H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 351-366Google Scholar). In contrast to the widespread nervous system distribution of the neurofilament triplet proteins, peripherin shows a more restricted distribution pattern (for a review, see 3Portier M.-M. Escurat M. Landon F. Djabali K. Bousquet O. C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris Ser. III. 1993; 316: 1124-1140Google Scholar). Peripherin is found in peripheral nervous system neurons, most cranial nerves, ventral horn motor neurons, and a few other nuclei in the central nervous system (4Brody B.A. Ley C.A. Parysek L.M. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 2391-2401Google Scholar, 5Leonard D.G.B. Gorham J.D. Cole P. Greene L.A. Ziff E.B. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 181-193Google Scholar, 6Parysek L.M. Goldman R.D. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 555-563Google Scholar, 7Portier M.-M. de Nechaud B. Gros F. Dev. Neurosci. 1984; 6: 335-344Google Scholar). During neuronal development, peripherin expression was never detected in regions of high mitotic activity or along routes of migration. Peripherin mRNA or protein were seen only in cells that had already migrated to their final position and were beginning to elaborate processes (8Escurat M. Djabali K. Gumpel M. Gros F. Portier M.-M. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 764-784Google Scholar, 9Gorham J.D. Baker H. Kegler D. Ziff E.B. Dev. Brain Res. 1990; 57: 235-248Google Scholar, 10Troy C.M. Brown K. Greene L.A. Shelanski M.L. Neuroscience. 1990; 36: 217-237Google Scholar). Peripherin is also significantly up-regulated in response to nerve injury (11Oblinger M.M. Wong J. Parysek L.M. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 3766-3775Google Scholar, 12Wong J. Oblinger M.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1990; 27: 332-341Google Scholar). Therefore, peripherin is one constituent of a program of gene expression activated at terminal neuronal differentiation and possibly involved in axonal growth and regeneration. Peripherin is also expressed in neuronal cell lines as well as in PC12 cells (13Parysek L.M. Goldman R.D. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 781-791Google Scholar, 14Portier M.-M. Brachet P. Croizat B. Gros F. Dev. Neurosci. 1984; 6: 215-226Google Scholar). PC12 cells, originally derived from a rat pheochromocytoma (15Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Google Scholar), resemble neural crest-derived sympathoadrenal precursor cells, their normal counterparts. Like sympathoadrenal precursors (16Anderson D.J. Axel R. Cell. 1986; 47: 1079-1090Google Scholar, 17Le Douarin N.M. Science. 1986; 231: 1515-1522Google Scholar), PC12 cells can display properties of neuronal or chromaffin cells depending on the environment (18Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Adv. Cell. Neurol. 1982; 3: 373-414Google Scholar). In the presence of nerve growth factor (NGF), 1The abbreviations used are: NGFnerve growth factorCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseβ-galβ-galactosidaseEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assaybpbase pair(s). these cells exhibit properties of sympathetic neurons, including neurites and the enhanced expression of various neuronal genes like peripherin (19Thompson M.A. Lee E. Lawe D. Gizang-Ginsberg E. Ziff E.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2501-2513Google Scholar, 20Leonard D.G.B. Ziff E.B. Greene L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3156-3167Google Scholar). By contrast, in the presence of glucocorticoids, the cells differentiate into adrenal chromaffin-like cells and neural specific genes are down-regulated (20Leonard D.G.B. Ziff E.B. Greene L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3156-3167Google Scholar, 21Federoff H.J. Grabczyk E. Fishman M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19290-19295Google Scholar, 22Machida C.M. Rodland K.D. Matrisian L. Magun B.E.

While several transcriptional changes are likely to be necessary to elicit these responses, the peripherin gene is one of the ultimate targets of NGF and glucocorticoids in that system. Studies of the regulation of peripherin gene transcription are therefore likely to lead to the identification of components of the signaling pathway involved in the implementation of the transcriptional changes necessary for differentiation. nerve growth factor chloramphenicol acetyltransferase β-galactosidase electrophoretic mobility shift assay base pair(s). Recently, by transfection and footprinting experiments, we have identified in the proximal promoter three regulatory elements important for peripherin gene expression, which we named PER1, PER2, and PER3 (24Desmarais D. Filion M. Lapointe L. Royal A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2971-2980Google Scholar). PER2 and PER3 function as activators but have no effect on cell type specificity of expression. The PER3 element is a stronger activator than PER2, and mutation of PER3 in a construct containing the first 256 bp of the peripherin gene promoter severely affects reporter gene expression (25Ferrari N. Desmarais D. Royal A. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 159: 159-165Google Scholar). We have shown that the GC-rich PER3 element binds the Sp1 transcription factor in vitro and in vivo and stimulates transcription when combined with PER1 (25Ferrari N. Desmarais D. Royal A. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 159: 159-165Google Scholar). The PER1 element, which overlaps the TATA box, interacts with a protein-binding complex prevailing in peripherin-expressing cell lines and appears to be an important determinant of cell type specificity. Although this element by itself is inefficient in driving reporter gene expression, its fusion with the polyoma virus enhancer results in high transcriptional activity, but only in peripherin expressing cell lines (24Desmarais D. Filion M. Lapointe L. Royal A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2971-2980Google Scholar). These experiments demonstrated that neuronal regulation of the peripherin gene is achieved through the interaction of its promoter with multiple DNA-binding proteins consisting of neuron-specific and ubiquitous activators. To gain a better understanding of the mechanisms that control peripherin gene expression, we focused our studies on the PER1 element. Here, we report that the properties of the PER1 element depend primarily on the TATA box and to a lesser extent on the surrounding sequences. We also found that the response of the peripherin gene to NGF is mediated through the TATA box, while the response to glucocorticoids is not. These results identify the TATA box and the complex that is assembled there for transcription initiation as essential elements in the regulation of neuronal gene expression and the response to NGF. Plasmids pGAL3450, pGAL425, pGAL256, and pGAL46 have been described previously (24Desmarais D. Filion M. Lapointe L. Royal A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2971-2980Google Scholar). Mutagenesis was performed as described by Ito et al. (26Ito W. Ishiguro H. Kurosawa Y. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 102: 67-70Google Scholar) on a 127-bp PstI fragment (−130/−3) cloned into the PstI site of pBluescript. After polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis, the mutated fragment StyI-PstI (−101/−3) was inserted in the pGAL256 or pGAL425 constructs. The oligonucleotides used for directed mutagenesis are shown in Table I.Table IOligonucleotides used for directed mutagenesisNameSequence (mutated bases in bold)PER1M1:AAAGGCGCCCCAGATGTCTGCAGPER1M2:AAAGCCGCCCCTAGTCGGTCTGCAGPER1M3:AAATCCGCATCGCATCGGTCTGCAGPER1M4:GCAGGGCATATTAAGGCGCCCCGPER1M5:GGAGACCGCATCTCTATAAAGPER1M6:GCCGCCCCGCATCGTCATGCATPER1M7:GGGCTATAAAGCATACCCGCATCGPER1M8:CGCAGGGCTCGAAAGCCGPER1M10:GGGCTATAGGTCCGCCCCTsv40:GACCGCAGGGTTTTATTTATGCCCCGCATCTtk:CATATTAAGGTGACGCGTGTGGCCCTGCAGGAATTC Open table in a new tab Plasmid pGAL256T19 was constructed in two steps. First, the keratin 19 (K19) gene core promoter (−34/+55) obtained by digestion with SmaI and BamHI was inserted between the SmaI-XbaI polylinker sites of p46D (24Desmarais D. Filion M. Lapointe L. Royal A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2971-2980Google Scholar) after blunting the incompatible overhangs with Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment, generating pGALT19. Then, pGAL256T19 was created by ligation of the following fragments into pGAL256 previously digested with StyI and KpnI: (i) the K19 gene core promoter plus a portion of the lacZ gene isolated from pGALT19, containing an EcoRI site (end-blunted) at the 5′ end and a KpnI site at the 3′ end and (ii) a portion of the peripherin gene promoter extending from HpaII to StyI (−46/−101) isolated from pGAL256. In the resulting plasmid, pGAL256T19, the peripherin gene core promoter was substituted by the K19 gene core promoter while the distance between PER3 and the TATA box was conserved. The plasmids used in transfection experiments were purified by alkaline lysis and two rounds of CsCl density gradient sedimentation (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The N18TG2 and OBL24 cell lines were cultured and seeded as described (24Desmarais D. Filion M. Lapointe L. Royal A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2971-2980Google Scholar). N18TG2 is a peripherin-expressing cell line derived from a mouse neuroblastoma (28Minna J. Glazer D. Nirenberg M. Nat. New Biol. 1972; 235: 225-231Google Scholar). OBL24 is a cell line that does not express peripherin. It was derived from mouse olfactory bulb cells immortalized by the avian myc oncogene (29Ryder E.F. Snyder E.Y. Cepko C.L. J. Neurobiol. 1990; 21: 356-375Google Scholar). Calcium phosphate-DNA precipitates containing 15 μg of each peripherin-lacZ reporter plasmid and 5 μg of pSV2CAT to monitor transfection efficiency were prepared as described (30Rosenthal N. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 704-720Google Scholar). N18TG2 and OBL24 cells were incubated with the precipitate for 8 and 18 h, respectively, shocked in 15% glycerol in phosphate-buffered saline solution for 1 min, and then washed twice in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and refed with fresh growth medium. Cells were harvested 48 h posttransfection for β-galactosidase (β-gal) and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) analyses as described before (24Desmarais D. Filion M. Lapointe L. Royal A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2971-2980Google Scholar) except that CAT activities were quantitated by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) analysis. The data presented are the averages of at least four transfections done in duplicate. PC12 cells (ATCC CRL 1721) were grown on collagen-coated culture dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum. To produce stable lines containing the various lacZ reporter constructs, PC12 cells were plated to a density of 2.5 × 106/6-cm dish. Six hours later, the cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method with 20 μg of peripherin-lacZ reporter plasmids and 2 μg of pRSVneo (ATCC 37198) as described for transient transfection and glycerol-shocked after 17 h. Two days after transfection, the cells were transferred to medium containing 400 μg/ml G418 for at least 6-8 weeks, at which time the colonies that had survived were pooled and maintained as a polyclonal cell line. Two to four independent polyclonal cell lines were produced with each peripherin-lacZ reporter construct and stimulated with 50 ng/ml 2.5 S NGF (Boehringer Mannheim) for 72 h or 10 μM dexamethasone (Sigma) for 7 days. β-Gal activities were measured and normalized on total cell protein concentration. Total RNA was isolated from PC12 cells, NGF-treated PC12 cells, and dexamethasone-treated PC12 cells by LiCl precipitation (31Auffray C. Rougeon F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 107: 303-314Google Scholar). 10 or 20 μg of total RNA were fractionated on 2.2 M formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred onto nylon membrane by blotting in 20 × SSC (3 M NaCl, 0.3 M sodium citrate, pH 7). The 32P-labeled peripherin probe was hybridized for 18 h in 50% formamide, 5 × SSC, 0.1 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 0.5% SDS, 0.1% non-fat dried milk, 10% dextran sulfate, and 200 μg/ml herring sperm DNA at 42°C. The peripherin probe was prepared by random primed labeling of excised SphI/SmaI fragment (−256/+142) of the mouse peripherin gene. Blots were washed at 55°C for successive 20-min periods in 2 × SSC and 0.2 × SSC in the presence of 0.1% SDS. Blots were exposed to XRP-1 film with intensifying screens at −70°C. Quantitative analysis of total RNA was done by methylene blue staining as described (32Wilkinson M. Doskow J. Lindsey S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 679Google Scholar). Peripherin mRNA was quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis. Nuclear extract proteins from N18TG2, PC12, and NGF-treated (72 h) PC12 cells were prepared essentially by the method of Dignam et al. (33Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Google Scholar). The 127-bp fragment (−130/−3) and derived mutant fragments subcloned into the PstI site of pBluescript were cut with EcoRI and 32P-end-labeled with [α-32P]dATP using E. coli DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment. The 42-bp DNA fragment was purified by 8% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after HpaII and ClaI double digestion. PER1 (formerly TA1, 24Desmarais D. Filion M. Lapointe L. Royal A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2971-2980Google Scholar) was also used. Oligonucleotides were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified from unincorporated radioactivity by 8% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were performed as described (24Desmarais D. Filion M. Lapointe L. Royal A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2971-2980Google Scholar) except that 2.5 μg of poly(dI-dC) were used. To characterize PER1, we introduced mutations in its sequence and determined their effects on the capacity of PER1 to interact with proteins by EMSA and on reporter gene activity after insertion of the mutations into pGAL256, a lacZ reporter gene construct with 256 bp of peripherin gene promoter sequence (24Desmarais D. Filion M. Lapointe L. Royal A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2971-2980Google Scholar), and transient transfections. Of eight mutations examined, three, PER1M2, PER1M5 and PER1M6, affected neither the capacity of PER1 to form a complex with nuclear proteins in gel shift assays (Fig. 1A) nor reporter gene activity in transfected N18TG2 cells (Fig. 1B). PER1M4 and PER1M7, two mutations which abrogate the in vitro protein binding capacity of PER1 (Fig. 1A), resulted in a 40-50% reduction of reporter gene activity in N18TG2 cells (Fig. 1B). However, two other mutations, which also abrogate the protein binding capacity of PER1, PER1M1, and PER1M3 (Fig. 1A), had no effect on reporter gene expression when inserted into pGAL256 (Fig. 1B). The last mutation examined, PER1M10, which by EMSA does not interfere with the binding of proteins to PER1 (Fig. 1A), resulted in an 80% reduction of β-gal activity when compared with the wild type promoter construct (Fig. 1B). Finally, when the eight mutant constructs were transfected into OBL24 cells, which do not express the peripherin gene, none of them resulted in significant reporter gene expression (data not shown). Three conclusions can be drawn from these experiments: (a) cell type specificity is affected neither by mutations which abrogate protein binding to PER1 nor by mutations which reduce promoter strength, (b) the loss of the capacity to bind proteins does not correlate with promoter strength in peripherin expressing cells, (c) mutations that result in decreased reporter gene activity localize to a short sequence centered on the TATA box of the gene (see Fig. 1A, shaded area), suggesting that this sequence plays a regulatory role. To further characterize the relationship between gene expression and the TATA box sequence, we compared the efficiency of various TATA elements by transient transfections. When the peripherin gene TATAAA sequence was mutated to the SV40 early promoter TATA box sequence (TTTTATTTAT) in a 256-bp peripherin-lacZ construct and transfected into N18TG2 cells, the activity of the resulting plasmid, pGAL256Tsv40, was only 17% of the wild type construct (Fig. 2). Similarly, conversion of the peripherin gene core promoter to the keratin 19 gene core promoter (with TATA box sequence ATAAAAA) or to the HSV-1 thymidine kinase gene core promoter (with TATA box sequence ATATTAA) resulted in two plasmids, pGAL256T19 and pGAL256Ttk, that were, respectively, only 18 and 35% as active as the wild type construct (Fig. 2). Last, mutation of the TATA sequence of the peripherin gene to a nonsense control sequence (TCGA) in plasmid pGAL256M8 resulted in a reduction of reporter gene expression to 20% (Fig. 2). Thus, changes in the TATA box sequence decreased gene expression by as much as 80% relative to the wild-type promoter. However, from the difference in efficiency between mutant M4 (see Fig. 1), which reconstitutes the sequence of the HSV-1 thymidine kinase gene TATA box (60%), and construct pGAL256Ttk (35%), where positions −9 to −30 of the peripherin core promoter were substituted with the corresponding sequence from the thymidine kinase gene, it appears that the sequence surrounding the TATA box also plays a role. Is the TATA box sequence important for cell type specificity? When transfected into OBL24 cells, none of these constructs produced significant reporter gene expression (data not shown). Together, the results indicate that the peripherin gene TATA sequence and the sequence surrounding it in the core promoter are important for efficient transcriptional activation. They also suggest that cell type-specific peripherin gene expression involves a negative factor interacting with TFIID or other components associated with the preinitiation complex at least in cell lines that do not express the peripherin gene. Our analysis of the promoter of the peripherin gene so far indicates that the region surrounding the TATA box plays an important role for both cell type specificity (24Desmarais D. Filion M. Lapointe L. Royal A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2971-2980Google Scholar) and efficient gene expression. One important property of this gene is its capacity to respond to NGF (19Thompson M.A. Lee E. Lawe D. Gizang-Ginsberg E. Ziff E.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2501-2513Google Scholar, 20Leonard D.G.B. Ziff E.B. Greene L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3156-3167Google Scholar). It was therefore of interest to determine if the core promoter and in particular the TATA box sequence played a role in this response. To address this question, we tested the ability of peripherin gene promoter constructs with mutations in the core promoter to up-regulate reporter gene expression in PC12 cells following NGF treatment. First, we measured the increase of peripherin mRNA levels following NGF treatment by Northern analysis. Peripherin mRNA levels increased markedly with long term NGF treatment (Fig. 3A). The level of peripherin mRNA in PC12 cells treated with NGF for 72 h was about 3.5-fold higher than in untreated cells, which corresponds to the increase reported by Leonard et al. (20Leonard D.G.B. Ziff E.B. Greene L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3156-3167Google Scholar). Second, constructs containing the peripherin gene promoter linked to the lacZ reporter gene were stably transfected into PC12 cells. After neomycin selection, colonies were pooled, maintained as polyclonal cell lines, and subsequently treated or not with NGF for 72 h. In cell lines carrying constructs pGAL3450, pGAL425, and pGAL256, addition of NGF increased reporter gene activity by 4.4-, 3.0-, and 2.1-fold, respectively (Table II). The β-gal activity was also increased 2.3-fold by NGF in cells containing pGAL256M1 (Table II), a mutant affected in the capacity of the PER1 element to bind proteins in vitro, but with an intact TATA sequence (see Fig. 1A). By contrast, pGAL256M4, which contains the HSV-1 thymidine kinase TATA box sequence ATATTAA (see Fig. 1A), was not inducible by NGF (Table II). To confirm these results, the PER1M4 mutation was also introduced in pGAL425 to generate pGAL425M4. Contrary to pGAL425, pGAL425M4 expression was not stimulated by NGF (Table II). Furthermore, no induction by NGF was apparent in cells containing pGAL256T19 and pGAL256Tsv40, which contain, respectively, the keratin 19 gene core promoter and the TATA box of the SV40 early promoter (Table II). These results indicate clearly that core promoter mutations that alter the peripherin gene TATA box sequence abolish the response to NGF. Finally, to determine if the NGF response was associated with qualitative changes in PER1 binding activity, we performed EMSA with nuclear extract proteins from untreated and NGF-treated (72 h) PC12 cells. Similar binding patterns were observed with both nuclear extracts (Fig. 4). Thus, NGF treatment does not lead to the appearance of new nucleoprotein complexes or to modifications of the preexisting complex observed with PER1.Table IIExpression of lacZ gene under peripherin promoter control in NGF-treated PC12 cellsConstructFold inductionpGAL34504.4 ± 1.8pGAL4253.0 ± 0.1pGAL425M41.3 ± 0.2pGAL2562.1 ± 0.2pGAL256M12.3 ± 0.1pGAL256M41.0 ± 0.2pGAL256T191.1 ± 0.2pGAL256Tsv400.6 ± 0.1 Open table in a new tab Fig. 4Characterization of PER1 binding activity in NGF-treated PC12 cells.

PER1 oligonucleotides were included as competitors prior to probe addition when indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Neuronal specific genes are generally down-regulated by dexamethasone in PC12 cells. We were therefore interested to determine if peripherin mRNA was affected by dexamethasone during PC12 differentiation and if so, what role, if any, the TATA box sequence might play in that process. As shown in Fig. 3B, peripherin mRNA levels were reduced 3.4-fold after 48 h of dexamethasone treatment. Using the stably transfected cell lines described above, we asked whether the 5′-flanking region of the peripherin gene promoter was sufficient to confer dexamethasone responsiveness. To answer this question, we treated the cell lines containing pGAL3450 and pGAL256 with dexamethasone for 7 days. The β-gal activities were reduced by about 3-fold in these cells (Table III), approximating the reduction in endogenous peripherin mRNA abundance observed by Northern analysis. Thus, most or all of the sequences necessary for mediating dexamethasone response appear to reside within the first 256 bp of the peripherin gene promoter. We then determined if mutations in the TATA box could affect the response to dexamethasone. As shown in Table III, β-gal activities observed with cell lines containing pGAL256M1, pGAL256M4, and pGAL256T19 were down-regulated by dexamethasone. The only exception were the pGAL256Tsv40 containing cells where the β-gal activity did not seem to be affected by the treatment. These results suggest that the peripherin gene TATA box sequence is not involved in the down-regulation of peripherin gene transcription that occurs during dexamethasone-induced differentiation in PC12 cells.Table IIIExpression of lacZ gene under peripherin promoter control in dexamethasone-treated PC12 cellsConstructFold repressionpGAL34502.9 ± 0.3pGAL2563.0 ± 0.7pGAL256M14.8 ± 0.7pGAL256M43.8 ± 0.7pGAL256T192.2 ± 0.2pGAL256Tsv401.4 ± 0.2 Open table in a new tab Although a picture of peripherin gene transcriptional regulation is now emerging (19Thompson M.A. Lee E.

Kopchick J.J. Parysek L.M. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 5056-5065Google Scholar), the mechanisms directing its expression in specific cell types are still not well understood. In a previous study, we identified in the core promoter an element called PER1 that was sufficient to restrict the expression of a reporter gene to peripherin-expressing cells (24Desmarais D. Filion M. Lapointe L. Royal A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2971-2980Google Scholar). Here, we show that the functional element within PER1 is the TATA box and that in addition to its role in conferring cell type specificity to the promoter, it mediates the response to NGF. These results predict that proteins interacting in the vicinity of the TATA box, by inference the preinitiation complex proteins, play an important regulatory role for peripherin gene expression. There are several indications that transcriptional regulation can be mediated through the TATA box (36Wefald F.C. Devlin B.H. Williams R.S. Nature. 1990; 344: 260-262Google Scholar, 37Simon M.C.

Biol. 1987; 7: 4329-4336Google Scholar), a short region of the promoter centered on the site of assembly of the preinitiation complex was found to exhibit substantial cell type-specific expression. In addition, there are several indications that specialized TATA sequences can play a role in the regulation of transcriptional induction (45Harbury P.A. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5298-5304Google Scholar, 46Leitman D.C. Mackow E.R. Williams T. Baxter J.D. West B.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1352-1356Google Scholar, 47Shworak N.W. O'Connor T. Wong N.C.W.

In the specific case of the response of the peripherin gene to NGF, two general mechanisms can be envisaged to explain how it may be affected by changes in the TATA box sequence. First, the TATA element and adjacent sequences could influence either TATA-binding protein or TFIID binding affinity, promoter recognition by RNA polymerase II, and the general initiation factors or the topology of the preinitiation complex (49Starr D.B. Hoopes B.C. Hawley D.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 434-446Google Scholar, 50Nakajima N. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4028-4040Google Scholar, 51Huang D.-H. Horikoshi M.

Such changes could interfere with protein-protein interactions in the complex or between the complex and co-activators and lock it in a nonresponsive state. A second possibility is that diverse TATA box elements could mediate the assembly of distinct preinitiation complexes; this would profoundly influence the response of a promoter to different activators. The existence of numerous TATA-binding protein associated factors (53Dynlacht B.D. Hoey T. Tjian R. Cell. 1991; 66: 563-576Google Scholar, 54Hoey T. Weinzierl R.O. Gill G. Chen J.L. Dynlacht B.D.

Brou C. Lutz Y. Davidson I. Chambon P. Tora L. Cell. 1994; 79: 107-117Google Scholar) indicate that TATA-binding protein can be associated with distinct factors or sets of factors. The preference of a specific TFIID complex for a particular TATA box sequence would effectively target the NGF response to a specific set of genes. Since the integrity of the TATA box of the peripherin gene is essential both for a high level of transcriptional activity and for the capacity to respond to NGF, we suggest that the effects observed with variant and nonconsensus TATA box sequences are more likely to result from interference with the assembly or with the function of a specific multiprotein complex rather than simply from changes in TATA-binding protein or TFIID binding affinity. Our results indicate that, in addition to the TATA box, other regions of the peripherin gene promoter are involved in regulating the response to NGF. Reporter gene expression increases by 2-4-fold following NGF addition, approximating the peripherin mRNA increase seen in Northern analysis. However, the construct containing the first 256 bp of the promoter (pGAL256) does not respond as much as pGAL3450 and pGAL425, suggesting the presence of other more distal elements contributing to the NGF response. Thompson et al. (19Thompson M.A. Lee E. Lawe D. Gizang-Ginsberg E. Ziff E.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2501-2513Google Scholar), studying the response of the rat peripherin gene, have suggested that NGF activates transcription in part by relieving the repression mediated by a negative response element in the promoter (19Thompson M.A. Lee E. Lawe D. Gizang-Ginsberg E. Ziff E.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2501-2513Google Scholar). However, the mouse and rat genes clearly differ in this respect, since we found no evidence for such an activity in the mouse peripherin gene (this study and 24Desmarais D. Filion M. Lapointe L. Royal A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2971-2980Google Scholar). By contrast, the effect of glucocorticoids did involve a repressor element localized in the proximal promoter. Since we found no evidence for a glucocorticoid response element in that part of the promoter, the identity and location of the sequence that mediates the response to dexamethasone will require further studies. In conclusion, the experiments described here provide evidence that the TATA box sequence of the peripherin gene plays an important role in the regulation of its transcription and suggest that the components assembled at the core promoter influence gene expression during differentiation. Elucidation of the molecular basis for cell type specificity and NGF inducibility of the peripherin gene will require a fine analysis of the molecules associated with the transcription initiation complex.

Intrinsic bending has been implicated in a variety of biological processes such as transcriptional regulation, recombination, and replication (1Hubner P. Haffter P. Iida S. Arber W. J. Mol.

A characteristic feature of intrinsically bent DNA is a series of several helically phased A4-6 tracts. In a kinetoplast DNA bend (K-DNA) (8Wu H.-M. Crothers D.M. Nature. 1984; 308: 509-513Google Scholar, 9Koo H.S. Wu H.M. Crothers D.M. Nature. 1986; 320: 501-506Google Scholar) four A5-6 tracts cause intrinsic curvature of 17-21° per tract resulting in 68-84° overall curvature (9Koo H.S. Wu H.M. Crothers D.M. Nature. 1986; 320: 501-506Google Scholar, 10Koo H.S. Drak J. Rice J.A. Crothers D.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4227-4234Google Scholar). Similarly, in the intrinsically bent phage lambda DNA origin of replication (λ-ori), four A4-5 tracts are helically phased. The properties of intrinsically bent DNA embedded in larger restriction fragments have been studied primarily by physical methods, such as gel electrophoresis and electron microscopy, whereas the conformation of small synthetic molecules has been characterized by x-ray crystallography. Although these studies have deciphered some of the sequence requirements for intrinsic bending, as well as some of its structural features, the precise conformation of intrinsically bent DNA remains in question. In particular, it is not known to what extent bending involves DNA strand separation, a feature that may facilitate protein binding. Furthermore, most of the published evidence indicates that bending occurs incrementally between consecutive base pairs of the A4-6 tracts (see 11Crothers D.M. Haran T.E. Nadeau J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7093-7096Google Scholar and 12Hagerman P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 755-781Google Scholar for reviews), whereas x-ray studies of synthetic molecules indicate a uniformly rigid conformation for the A4-6 tracts as a block (13Dickerson R.E.

If DNA bending causes localized strand separation, the resulting non-canonical DNA conformation should be a preferred target for single-stranded DNA-specific endonucleases such as S1 and T7 endonuclease I. These enzymes have been extensively used as probes of localized structures such as cruciforms and Z-DNA under supercoil stress both in vitro and in vivo (7van Holde K. Zlatanova J. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 59-68Google Scholar). However, the usefulness of these enzymes is limited by a background nucleolytic activity toward nearly random sites (16Panayotatos N. Backman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15070-15073Google Scholar, 17Panayotatos N. Fontaine A. Backman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15066-15069Google Scholar, 18Economides A.N. Unusual DNA Structures and Probes Used for Their Detection..Ph.D. dissertation. Michigan State University, 1993Google Scholar). With supercoiled DNA, the fast rate of cleavage of the prominent cruciform or Z-DNA targets overcomes this limitation. In contrast, background activity is mostly observed with relaxed DNA, and the location of the few preferred sites is difficult to determine. An exception is an engineered endonuclease (H144) consisting of Lac repressor (lacI) and T7 endonuclease I. This enzyme maintains the specific repressor and nuclease activities of its components both in vitro and in vivo (17Panayotatos N. Fontaine A. Backman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15066-15069Google Scholar, 18Economides A.N. Unusual DNA Structures and Probes Used for Their Detection..Ph.D. dissertation. Michigan State University, 1993Google Scholar). H144 cleaves cruciforms on supercoiled DNA with specificity and kinetics essentially identical to those of T7 endonuclease I. However, unlike T7 endonuclease I, H144 preferentially binds at lacO and cleaves relaxed dsDNA at sites located within a 100-1,500-bp range. The cleavage preference by H144 at a particular site depends on the prominence and location of the target relative to lacO. This specificity is practically lost, reverting to that of T7 endonuclease I, when the operator is not present on the same fragment as the targets. Therefore, the net effect of the lacI domain in H144 is to lower the background activity by sequestering the T7 endonuclease I domain to the vicinity of lacO. Here, we report that the five non-canonical DNA structures probed by H144 on relaxed dsDNA coincide with DNA regulatory sequences and intrinsically bent structures. Plasmids pCP144 and pCP82 have been described (16Panayotatos N. Backman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15070-15073Google Scholar, 17Panayotatos N. Fontaine A. Backman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15066-15069Google Scholar). Plasmid pCP64 carries a kanamycin resistance gene and a region encompassing base pair coordinates 37,401 and 41,740 of bacteriophage lambda DNA that includes the origin of replication (λ-ori). These plasmids served as the parents of the plasmids used in these studies. The K-DNA bend from Leishmania tarentolae (L. tarentolae) (8Wu H.-M. Crothers D.M. Nature. 1984; 308: 509-513Google Scholar, 9Koo H.S. Wu H.M. Crothers D.M. Nature. 1986; 320: 501-506Google Scholar) was chemically synthesized and polymerase chain reaction-amplified before subcloning into pCP82 to generate pCP230. The λ-ori bend (19Zahn K. Blattner F.R. Nature. 1985; 317: 451-453Google Scholar) was prepared by splicing the λ-ori region from pCP64 into pCP82. The correctness of the constructs was determined by restriction analysis and DNA sequencing. An exact description of genetic engineering manipulations is provided elsewhere (18Economides A.N. Unusual DNA Structures and Probes Used for Their Detection..Ph.D. dissertation. Michigan State University, 1993Google Scholar). H144 was purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation of a cleared lysate of induced Escherichia coli harboring pCP144 as described (17Panayotatos N. Fontaine A. Backman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15066-15069Google Scholar) with the following modifications of the chromatography steps. H144 was loaded on a CM-cellulose cartridge (CM1010, Millipore) in buffer A (5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, 5% glycerol, 50 mM MOPS, pH 7.2) and eluted at 200 mM NaCl using a salt gradient. Fractions containing H144 were identified by assaying for preferential and specific binding and cleavage of a DNA fragment carrying lacUV5 in a mixture of restriction fragments, as described (17Panayotatos N. Fontaine A. Backman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15066-15069Google Scholar). H144 was 50% pure, as judged by SDS-PAGE stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 or Silver. Fractions containing H144 were pooled and further fractionated on a phosphocellulose P11 column (Whatman), in buffer P11 (40 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 40 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, 5% glycerol), using a salt gradient. H144 eluted at approximately 450 mM NaCl and was approximately 90% pure. As a final purification step, hydrophobic interaction chromatography was performed on a 1-ml phenyl-Superose FPLC column (Pharmacia Biotech, Inc.). Pooled fractions were adjusted by progressive addition of granular ammonium sulfate to 1 M. A linear reverse gradient was applied to 20 mM NaCl in buffer A. H144 eluted at 0.5 M ammonium sulfate and was better than 90% pure, as judged by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining (data not shown). The peak fractions were dialyzed against 500 volumes of 50 mM Tris, pH 7.0, 50% glycerol, 20 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM DTT, and stored at −20°C. Three mg of purified H144 were obtained from 40 g of induced cells. The concentration of the H144 preparation used in this study was 0.84 mg/ml (16 μM) as determined by the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). H144 was analyzed by gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex-75 column (Pharmacia) in 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl. H144 eluted as a single peak corresponding to an apparent molecular weight of 58,000 (data not shown). This figure is close to 52,500 calculated for an H144 monomer from its amino acid composition. Higher order multimers or aggregates were not detected. Thus, at least when not bound to lacO DNA, H144 is monomeric. H144 was also analyzed by reverse phase chromatography. H144 (24 μg) was loaded on a 1-ml C-8 column (Poros IIR-M) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 10% acetonitrile and was eluted using an acetonitrile gradient. H144 eluted as a single peak at 42% acetonitrile (data not shown). No other peaks were detected, indicating that H144 is more than 95% pure and free of proteolytic fragments. H144 recovered from the C-8 column was analyzed by mass spectrometry, where it displayed a molecular size of 52,430 ± 104. This figure is within experimental error of the 52,511 value calculated from the amino acid composition (data not shown). Reactions with H144 and DNA were performed in 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl at 37°C. Where indicated 1 mg/ml BSA was also included. The reactions were initiated by the addition of MgCl2 to 10 mM and terminated either by the addition of 0.2 M EDTA, pH 8.0, to 20 mM final concentration, or by the addition of 0.1 volume of Stop buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.5, 50 mM borate, 125 mM EDTA, 43.5% glycerol, 0.05 mg/ml bromphenol blue). When desired, stopped reactions employing H144 were heated to 75°C for 5 min to dissociate hybrid protein from lacO-DNA. In order to map H144 target sites with base pair resolution, restriction fragments were specifically radiolabeled at the 3′ ends by DNApol large fragment (Klenow, New England BioLabs) in the presence of the appropriate α-35S-dNTP (DuPont NEN) or at the 5′ ends with polynucleotide kinase (New England BioLabs) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (DuPont NEN). Fragments labeled with polynucleotide kinase were first dephosphorylated with alkaline phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim). The radiolabeled DNA was reacted with H144, analyzed on 6% PAGE, and PAGE, 7 M urea strand-denaturing gels, and visualized by autoradiography. An M13 sequencing ladder size marker was generated as recommended (Sequenase 2.0; U. S. Biochemical Corp.). To test the activity of H144 toward linear intrinsically bent DNA, a mixture of restriction fragments from plasmid pCP230 that carries lacO and an intrinsic bend from kinetoplast DNA (K-DNA) (8Wu H.-M. Crothers D.M. Nature. 1984; 308: 509-513Google Scholar, 9Koo H.S. Wu H.M. Crothers D.M. Nature. 1986; 320: 501-506Google Scholar) was reacted with H144. Restriction digestion of pCP230 by NheI plus PvuII generated three fragments, the smallest of which (681 bp) carried K-DNA ~130 bp away from lacO (Fig. 1a). Incubation of these fragments with H144 for increasing periods led to preferential cleavage of the 681-bp fragment to two fragments, 650- and 80-bp apparent size, respectively (Fig. 1b). Two of the substrate fragments (2311 and 681 bp) had been 35S-labeled selectively at the NheI site. Of the products generated by H144 only the 80-bp fragment was visible by autoradiography (Fig. 1c). Since filling-in at the NheI site 35S labels only one strand, further analysis by electrophoresis on high resolution denaturing gels revealed that H144 generated an 85-bp 35S-labeled single-stranded DNA fragment by nicking 85 bp away from the filled-in NheI site (Fig. 1d). When the opposite strand was 32P-labeled with polynucleotide kinase, a single major cleavage product was observed, the result of nicking 79 bp away from the NheI site (data not shown). Since the two major nicks on the upper and lower strands were staggered by 6 bp, combined cleavage at both sites must have generated the double-stranded DNA products observed on nondenaturing gels. Assignment of the nicking sites on the DNA sequence showed that the two nicks that H144 introduces on the 681-bp fragment fall within the K-DNA bend (Fig. 1e). The nick on the upper strand occurs within one of the four helically phased A-tracts, whereas the nick on the lower strand is located at the position corresponding to the proposed physical center of the bend (8Wu H.-M. Crothers D.M. Nature. 1984; 308: 509-513Google Scholar). To confirm and better understand the preference of H144 for intrinsic bends, a second DNA that displays intrinsic curvature was tested. The bending locus of the lambda origin of replication (λ-ori) was chosen, because it does not share common sequences with the K-DNA bend apart from the bend-inducing A4-5 tracts (Fig. 2a). Moreover, the physical center of bending for this sequence is also known (20Zahn K. Blattner F. Science. 1987; 236: 416-422Google Scholar). Fig. 2, panels b and c, shows the activity of H144 toward three restriction fragments of pCP212, one of which (577 bp) carries λ-ori approximately 200 bp downstream of lacO. Four prominent new fragments were generated by H144, and their apparent sizes indicated fragmentation of the 577-bp substrate fragment at three sites (Fig. 2b). Two of these products, 280 and 150 bp in length, were also visible by autoradiography when the substrate fragments had been 35S-labeled at the NheI site (Fig. 2c). By further restriction analysis of end-labeled molecules, Southern hybridization, and high resolution denaturing gel electrophoresis, the exact positions of the nicks that generated these fragments were determined, as described for the K-DNA bend (data not shown). Assignment of the nicking sites on the DNA sequence confirmed that H144 cleaves the 577-bp fragment at three sites. The first two are located within λ-ori. The nicks at positions 265 and 278 on the upper strand and positions 268 and 278 on the lower strand fall within the GC-rich region of iterons III and IV (Fig. 2e). This region encompasses the proposed physical center of bending at λ-ori (20Zahn K. Blattner F. Science. 1987; 236: 416-422Google Scholar). Thus, H144 preferentially cleaves a second intrinsically bent DNA sequence at sites that correspond to the physical center of bending. Parenthetically, two less prominent bands are also seen in Fig. 2c, lane 2, corresponding to approximately a 580- and a 380-bp labeled fragment. The targets that give rise to these fragments must be located very near the EcoRV site, but their exact locations have not been determined. The third site at which the 577-bp fragment is cleaved by H144 is not located within the λ-ori region. Instead, inspection of the DNA sequence showed that cleavage occurred 130 bp away, within a region specifying a T7 late promoter. Nicking occurred at two positions at coordinates 139 and 149 of the upper strand and at a single position at coordinate 145 of the lower strand (Fig. 2d). The finding of preferential cleavage within a T7 promoter prompted us to examine more closely the locations of the targets for H144 that had been previously assigned within the region of the β-lactamase promoter (16Panayotatos N. Backman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15070-15073Google Scholar). Mapping these targets within a 475-bp restriction fragment (Fig. 3a) was accomplished by DNA labeling and gel analysis (Fig. 3, b and c). The precise location of these targets was determined by high resolution denaturing gel electrophoresis using the methodology described above for the targets located within the K-DNA bend (data not shown). The results show that H144 nicks the substrate DNA at five major locations (Fig. 3d). Two nicks separated by 4 bp on opposing strands span the leftward transcription initiation nucleotide; two others separated by 6 bp on opposing strands are located within the −35 element of the β-lactamase promoter at positions −40 and −45 (21Brosius J. Cate R.L. Perlmutter A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9205-9210Google Scholar); the fifth prominent nick is in the exact same position as that introduced by gyrase (22Kirkegaard K. Wang J.C. Cell. 1981; 23: 721-729Google Scholar). Interestingly, in contrast to the nicks mapped within the T7 late promoter, no nicks were mapped at the −10 region (TATA box) of the β-lactamase promoter, where strand separation in response to protein binding and the formation of the transcription initiation complex occurs (see “Discussion”). In supercoiled dsDNA, localized non-canonical conformations are more or less preferred targets for single-strand specific endonucleases. The preferential cleavage of dsDNA by H144, a nuclease that has a marked preference for ssDNA, suggested the presence of single-strandedness at the targets. Even though the results described above were obtained with relaxed rather than supercoiled dsDNA, the target sequences were examined for high A + T content, inverted repeats, alternating purine/pyrimidine and pyrimidine stretches that specify “breathing” sites, cruciforms, Z-DNA, and triple-stranded DNA, respectively. No such motifs were found, indicating that even if single-strandedness is the structural feature recognized by H144, it does not result from such structures. In a search for other common patterns, the sequences (20 bp) surrounding the 14 nicking sites were aligned (Table I). As seen in the lower part of Table I, no individual nucleotide is conserved at any particular position, with 8/14 hits being the most frequent occurrence. Even though 5 of the 14 sequences encompassing the targets share the degenerate pentanucleotide CTA(A/T)(A/T) immediately 3′ to the nick (positions 11-13), the same sequence in other locations of the substrate DNA was not nicked at detectable levels (18Economides A.N. Unusual DNA Structures and Probes Used for Their Detection..Ph.D. dissertation. Michigan State University, 1993Google Scholar). Therefore, the particular DNA sequence responsible for preferential nicking by H144 is not evident, even though sequences analogous to the CTA(A/T)(A/T) pentanucleotide may be favored. Additional sites would have to be identified and analyzed, in order to decipher the DNA sequence context(s) that dictates the target conformation.Table IAlignment of H144 target sequencesNucleotide sequence, 5′→ 3′1G A A G C A T T T A/T C A G G G T T A T2G A C A A T A A C C/C T G A T A A A T G3A T T T G A A T G T/A T T T A G A A A A4G T T T A T T T T T/C T A A A T A C A T5A T A C G A C T C A/C T A T A G G A G A6C T A T A G G A G A/A C C T T A A G G T7T A A G G T T C T C/C T A T A G T G A G8A G A A A A A T A A/A C A A A T A G G G9A A A T G T C A A A/A A A T A G G C A A10C A T T T T T T G C/C T A T T T T T T G11C C T C A A A A C G/A G G G A A A A T C12G G G G A T T T T C/C C T C G T T T T G13G G A A A A T C C C/C T A A A A C G A G14C T C G T T T T A G/G G G A T T T T C CΣA4 5 7 3 7 6 4 4 3 5/5 1 8 5 8 4 6 4 6 3ΣT1 5 4 5 2 7 7 8 4 2/1 7 2 6 4 5 5 4 4 3ΣG5 3 1 4 4 1 1 0 3 2/1 2 3 2 2 5 2 4 3 6ΣC4 1 2 2 1 0 2 2 4 5/7 4 1 1 0 0 1 2 1 2 Open table in a new tab Finally, to eliminate the possibility that the DNA during preparation was somehow selectively modified in vivo at or near the nicking sites, we used as substrates for H144 DNA fragments synthesized in vitro by polymerase chain reaction. Identical results were obtained with these synthetic substrates (data not shown), indicating that DNA modification does not play a role in target recognition. Overall, three functional DNA sites, a bacterial promoter, a phage promoter, and a gyrase contact site, were found to be preferred targets for H144, in addition to the two intrinsic bends, at least one of which (λ-ori) is also a functional site for DNA replication. Since only a few target sequences were detected per several hundred bp, their common non-canonical structural feature is not encountered very frequently on dsDNA. H144 was found to cleave relaxed dsDNA at sites that are known to interact with particular proteins. The β-lactamase and T7 late promoters interact with their respective polymerases, and the gyrase site is nicked by bacterial gyrase. Intrinsic bends are also thought to be preferred sites for topoisomerase action (23Camilloni G. Caserta M. Amadei A. Di Mauro E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1129: 73-82Google Scholar, 24Caserta M. Amadei A. Di Mauro E. Camilloni G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 8463-8474Google Scholar), and the λ-ori interacts with O-protein. Therefore, all the sequences targeted by H144 share a common property; they interact with DNA-binding proteins. The fact that the sites cleaved by H144 are also contact sites for various regulatory proteins suggests that the target structure which is present in linear DNA, in the absence of supercoil pressure, is of physiological significance. Altered (non-B) sequence-dependent conformations at these functional sites may serve as recognition signals and/or entry points for these proteins. T7 endonuclease I cleaves single-stranded DNA much faster than relaxed, dsDNA. This enzyme also shows strong specificity toward cruciforms, branched DNA, and even single base pair mismatches, i.e. structures that expose small localized single-stranded regions in dsDNA. T7 endonuclease I cleaves cruciform DNA 2-4 bp away from the single-stranded loop and base regions (25de Massy B. Weisberg R.A. Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 359-376Google Scholar). 2A. N. Economides, D. Everdeen, and N. Panayotatos, unpublished results. In branched dsDNA, cleavage by T7 endonuclease I and other single-stranded endonucleases occurs 1-10 bp away from the branch point at sites that do not conform to a strict pattern with respect to distance from the branch point, strand, or sequence preference (25de Massy B. Weisberg R.A. Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 359-376Google Scholar, 26Lilley D.M.J. Kemper B. Cell. 1984; 36: 413-422Google Scholar, 27Dickie P. McFadden G. Morgan A.R. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2531-2536Google Scholar). The same pattern emerges from probing synthetic, mismatched DNA, where strand scission occurs at variable lengths from the mismatch (36Mashal R.D. Koontz J. Sklar J. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 177-183Google Scholar). Therefore, cleavage by these enzymes does not occur at the single-stranded regions expected to be exposed by these localized structures but, instead, a few bp away. One explanation for this phenomenon is that the binding and catalytic sites of T7 endonuclease I are physically separated, so that binding occurs at single-stranded regions and cleavage ensues a few bp away at sites that may only be partially single-stranded. Alternatively, however, it is also possible that the enzyme recognizes and cleaves its specific substrate conformation through a single binding and catalytic site. In this case, single-stranded DNA may assume the substrate conformation by freedom of rotation, whereas the constraints of localized single-strandedness in cruciforms, branched, and mismatched DNA may instead expose the substrate conformation at a nearby site. The published evidence is consistent with either one of these mechanisms. Therefore, the exact points of cleavage (targets) by the T7 endonuclease I domain of H144 are not necessarily single-stranded, even though they are most likely located nearby a region that can easily assume single-strandedness. The nicks mapped within the T7 late promoter occur within a region of strand separation in response to T7 RNA polymerase binding (37Strothkamp R.E. Oakley J.L. Coleman J.E. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 1074-1080Google Scholar, 38Siebenlist U. Nature. 1979; 279: 651-652Google Scholar). In contrast, no nicks were mapped at the −10 region (TATA box) of the β-lactamase promoter, where strand separation occurs in response to protein binding and the formation of the transcription initiation complex. Regardless of the exact conformation of the targets, the evidence presented here shows that in linear dsDNA, protein contact sites and bends are selectively cleaved by H144. In bent DNA, the existence of single-strandedness has been postulated by molecular modeling (39Ramstein J. Lavery R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7231-7235Google Scholar) and, more recently, deduced from biophysical measurements (40Kahn J.D. Yun E. Crothers D.M. Nature. 1994; 368: 163-166Google Scholar). The results obtained with an enzymatic probe (H144) are consistent with strand opening within intrinsic bends. Other enzymes, such as the mung bean, P1, and S1 nucleases that preferentially cleave ssDNA, have been used to probe for single-stranded regions within intrinsically bent DNA, without success (19Zahn K. Blattner F.R. Nature. 1985; 317: 451-453Google Scholar, 41Caddle M.S. Lussier R.H. Heintz N.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 19-33Google Scholar, 42Kitchin P.A. Klein V.A. Ryan K.A. Gann K.L. Rauch C.A. Kang D.S. Wells R.D. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11302-11309Google Scholar, 43Marini J.C. Effron P.N. Goodman T.C. Singleton C.K. Wells R.D. Wartell R.M. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8974-8979Google Scholar). In addition, the ssDNA probe bromoacetaldehyde also failed to detect an intrinsic bend (42Kitchin P.A. Klein V.A. Ryan K.A. Gann K.L. Rauch C.A. Kang D.S. Wells R.D. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11302-11309Google Scholar). Even T7 endonuclease I does not cleave bent DNA with sufficient preference to allow detection over the background (18Economides A.N. Unusual DNA Structures and Probes Used for Their Detection..Ph.D. dissertation. Michigan State University, 1993Google Scholar). Similarly, H144 loses its specificity for bent DNA in the absence of lacO. Thus, the usefulness of H144 as an enzymatic probe of localized non-canonical structures stems from the fact that the LacI domain directs the protein to lacO and, thus, limits nonspecific interactions. As a result, H144 preferentially cleaves intrinsic DNA bends, as well as other specific targets that coincide with DNA sites where proteins act. An important aspect of the evidence presented here is that preferential cleavage occurred in the absence of supercoiling or cognate protein binding. This finding implies that DNA/protein contact sites share a structural feature common to bent DNA that may serve as a signal for protein binding."
