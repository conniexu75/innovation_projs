https://openalex.org/W2021544033,"Lactic Fuels In the quest to find sustainable alternatives to petrochemicals, a small cyclic ester, γ-valerolactone, derived from cellulose offers promising raw material. Bond et al. (p. 1110 ) show that carbon dioxide can be catalytically excised from the lactone efficiently at high pressure, leaving a mixture of butanes. In a second-stage reactor, the butanes can be strung together to form heavier hydrocarbons similar to those found in automotive and jet fuels. The method simultaneously yields fuel and a relatively pure stream of pressurized carbon dioxide amenable to sequestration or further chemical modification."

The zinc-finger protein, A20, is vital for regulating NF-κB signaling, so much so that mice lacking A20 die young of multiorgan failure and cachexia. Similar deficiencies have been seen in Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and other inflammatory diseases of humans. But how A20 works has remained unknown. Shembade et al. (p. 1135 ; see the Perspective by S riskantharajah and Ley ) have discovered that the A20 protein acts through the ubiquitin labeling system of the cell required for normal protein turnover, and its lack prevents NF-κB recycling, resulting in chronic inflammation. A human T cell lymphotropic virus possesses an oncoprotein that subverts this pathway to the virus' benefit by inhibiting A20 interactions with the ubiquitin pathway to promote NF-κB signaling and cell immortalization."
https://openalex.org/W2079559417,"Despite the essential roles of sphingolipids both as structural components of membranes and critical signalling molecules, we have a limited understanding of how cells sense and regulate their levels. Here we reveal the function in sphingolipid metabolism of the ORM genes (known as ORMDL genes in humans)—a conserved gene family that includes ORMDL3, which has recently been identified as a potential risk factor for childhood asthma. Starting from an unbiased functional genomic approach in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we identify Orm proteins as negative regulators of sphingolipid synthesis that form a conserved complex with serine palmitoyltransferase, the first and rate-limiting enzyme in sphingolipid production. We also define a regulatory pathway in which phosphorylation of Orm proteins relieves their inhibitory activity when sphingolipid production is disrupted. Changes in ORM gene expression or mutations to their phosphorylation sites cause dysregulation of sphingolipid metabolism. Our work identifies the Orm proteins as critical mediators of sphingolipid homeostasis and raises the possibility that sphingolipid misregulation contributes to the development of childhood asthma. Sphingolipids and their biosynthetic intermediates such as ceramide and sphingosine participate in key cellular processes including cell growth, membrane trafficking and inflammation. In recent genetic studies, mutations near the ORMDL3 gene were associated with childhood asthma. A functional genomic study in yeast cells now shows that Orm proteins function in sphingolipid homeostasis, and that alterations in this control result in misregulation of sphingolipid production and accumulation of toxic metabolites. This suggests that misregulation of sphingolipids may directly contribute to the development of asthma. Mutations near the ORMDL3 gene have been associated with childhood asthma. Here, in yeast, Orm proteins are shown to function in sphingolipid homeostasis; alterations in this control result in misregulation of sphingolipid production and accumulation of toxic metabolites. This raises the testable hypothesis that misregulation of sphingolipids may directly contribute to the development of asthma."
https://openalex.org/W1990337343,"The beta1- and beta2-adrenergic receptors (betaARs) on the surface of cardiomyocytes mediate distinct effects on cardiac function and the development of heart failure by regulating production of the second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). The spatial localization in cardiomyocytes of these betaARs, which are coupled to heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins), and the functional implications of their localization have been unclear. We combined nanoscale live-cell scanning ion conductance and fluorescence resonance energy transfer microscopy techniques and found that, in cardiomyocytes from healthy adult rats and mice, spatially confined beta2AR-induced cAMP signals are localized exclusively to the deep transverse tubules, whereas functional beta1ARs are distributed across the entire cell surface. In cardiomyocytes derived from a rat model of chronic heart failure, beta2ARs were redistributed from the transverse tubules to the cell crest, which led to diffuse receptor-mediated cAMP signaling. Thus, the redistribution of beta(2)ARs in heart failure changes compartmentation of cAMP and might contribute to the failing myocardial phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2083587546,"From sand piles to electrons in metals, one of the greatest challenges in modern physics is to understand the behavior of an ensemble of strongly interacting particles. A class of quantum many-body systems such as neutron matter and cold Fermi gases share the same universal thermodynamic properties when interactions reach the maximum effective value allowed by quantum mechanics, the so-called unitary limit [1,2]. It is then possible to simulate some astrophysical phenomena inside the highly controlled environment of an atomic physics laboratory. Previous work on the thermodynamics of a two-component Fermi gas led to thermodynamic quantities averaged over the trap [3-5], making it difficult to compare with many-body theories developed for uniform gases. Here we develop a general method that provides for the first time the equation of state of a uniform gas, as well as a detailed comparison with existing theories [6,14]. The precision of our equation of state leads to new physical insights on the unitary gas. For the unpolarized gas, we prove that the low-temperature thermodynamics of the strongly interacting normal phase is well described by Fermi liquid theory and we localize the superfluid transition. For a spin-polarized system, our equation of state at zero temperature has a 2% accuracy and it extends the work of [15] on the phase diagram to a new regime of precision. We show in particular that, despite strong correlations, the normal phase behaves as a mixture of two ideal gases: a Fermi gas of bare majority atoms and a non-interacting gas of dressed quasi-particles, the fermionic polarons [10,16-18]."
https://openalex.org/W2067108995,"The Red Queen hypothesis proposes that coevolution of interacting species (such as hosts and parasites) should drive molecular evolution through continual natural selection for adaptation and counter-adaptation. Although the divergence observed at some host-resistance and parasite-infectivity genes is consistent with this, the long time periods typically required to study coevolution have so far prevented any direct empirical test. Here we show, using experimental populations of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 and its viral parasite, phage Phi2 (refs 10, 11), that the rate of molecular evolution in the phage was far higher when both bacterium and phage coevolved with each other than when phage evolved against a constant host genotype. Coevolution also resulted in far greater genetic divergence between replicate populations, which was correlated with the range of hosts that coevolved phage were able to infect. Consistent with this, the most rapidly evolving phage genes under coevolution were those involved in host infection. These results demonstrate, at both the genomic and phenotypic level, that antagonistic coevolution is a cause of rapid and divergent evolution, and is likely to be a major driver of evolutionary change within species."

Van de Velde et al. (p. 1122 ) show that the host plant, Medicago truncatula produces nodule-specific cysteine-rich peptides, resembling natural plant defense peptides. The peptides enter the bacterial cells and promote its development into the mature symbiont. In a complementary study, D. Wang et al. (p. 1126 ), have identified the signal peptidase, also encoded by the plant, that is required for processing these specialized peptides into their active form."

https://openalex.org/W2045126558,"Nitrogen (N2)-fixing microorganisms (diazotrophs) are an important source of biologically available fixed N in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and control the productivity of oligotrophic ocean ecosystems. We found that two major groups of unicellular N2-fixing cyanobacteria (UCYN) have distinct spatial distributions that differ from those of Trichodesmium, the N2-fixing cyanobacterium previously considered to be the most important contributor to open-ocean N2 fixation. The distributions and activity of the two UCYN groups were separated as a function of depth, temperature, and water column density structure along an 8000-kilometer transect in the South Pacific Ocean. UCYN group A can be found at high abundances at substantially higher latitudes and deeper in subsurface ocean waters than Trichodesmium. These findings have implications for the geographic extent and magnitude of basin-scale oceanic N2 fixation rates."

https://openalex.org/W1974889617,"In the past, explanations for high species diversity have been sought at the species level. Theory shows that coexistence requires substantial differences between species, but species-level data rarely provide evidence for such differences. Using data from forests in the southeastern United States, I show here that variation evident at the individual level provides for coexistence of large numbers of competitors. Variation among individuals within populations allows species to differ in their distributions of responses to the environment, despite the fact that the populations to which they belong do not differ, on average. Results are consistent with theory predicting that coexistence depends on competition being stronger within than between species, shown here by analysis of individual-level responses to environmental fluctuation."
https://openalex.org/W2121338045,"Diversity Gradients Latitudinal gradients in species abundance, with relatively few occurring at the poles and many at the equator, are well known for macroorganisms. It is a matter of controversy, fueled by a lack of observational data, whether such gradients also occur among microorganisms. Barton et al. (p. 1509 , published online 25 February) have built on a global marine circulation model to predict the dynamics of phytoplankton populations. In silico, they obtain patterns of latitudinal gradation for plankton that are interspersed with hotspots of amplified diversity, which point to plausible natural explanations for the phenomenon that can be tested in the future by systematic metagenomic surveys."
https://openalex.org/W2013244831,"Bursty, Infrequent Noise In gene regulatory networks, positive feedback loops can give rise to bistability and hysteresis in gene expression, thereby allowing switching mechanisms and memory effects. To and Maheshri (p. 1142 ; see the Perspective by Levens and Gupta ) eschew the commonly held idea that sigmoidal promoter responses are required to achieve a steady-state bimodal response in a positive feedback loop. Instead, using a model and data from an experiment, they favor noisy gene expression and multiple, noncooperative transcription factor binding as an explanation for the bimodal response, and they expect that similar noisy systems are widespread in biology."
https://openalex.org/W2116437559,"The unfolded protein response (UPR), a signalling pathway activated by the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, is known to contribute to the defence against infectious agents and toxins. Here it is shown that activation of innate immunity in Caenorhabditis elegans induces the UPR mediated by X-box binding protein 1 (XBP-1). This points to an ancient, conserved role for the XBP-1-dependent UPR in protecting cells against the endoplasmic reticulum stress generated from an immune response. The unfolded protein response, known to contribute to the defence against infectious agents and toxins, is shown here to protect Caenorhabditis elegans larvae against detrimental effects of the innate immune response to infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The findings establish innate immunity as a physiologically relevant inducer of ER stress during C. elegans development. The detection and compensatory response to the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), termed the unfolded protein response (UPR), represents a conserved cellular homeostatic mechanism with important roles in normal development and in the pathogenesis of disease1. The IRE1–XBP1/Hac1 pathway is a major branch of the UPR that has been conserved from yeast to human2,3,4,5,6. X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) is required for the differentiation of the highly secretory plasma cells of the mammalian adaptive immune system7,8, but recent work also points to reciprocal interactions between the UPR and other aspects of immunity and inflammation9,10,11. We have been studying innate immunity in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, having established a principal role for a conserved PMK-1 p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in mediating resistance to microbial pathogens12. Here we show that during C. elegans development, XBP-1 has an essential role in protecting the host during activation of innate immunity. Activation of the PMK-1-mediated response to infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa induces the XBP-1-dependent UPR. Whereas a loss-of-function xbp-1 mutant develops normally in the presence of relatively non-pathogenic bacteria, infection of the xbp-1 mutant with P. aeruginosa leads to disruption of ER morphology and larval lethality. Unexpectedly, the larval lethality phenotype on pathogenic P. aeruginosa is suppressed by loss of PMK-1-mediated immunity. Furthermore, hyperactivation of PMK-1 causes larval lethality in the xbp-1 mutant even in the absence of pathogenic bacteria. Our data establish innate immunity as a physiologically relevant inducer of ER stress during C. elegans development and indicate that an ancient, conserved role for XBP-1 may be to protect the host organism from the detrimental effects of mounting an innate immune response to microbes."
https://openalex.org/W2100020625,"The nitrogen-fixing symbiosis between Sinorhizobium meliloti and its leguminous host plant Medicago truncatula occurs in a specialized root organ called the nodule. Bacteria that are released into plant cells are surrounded by a unique plant membrane compartment termed a symbiosome. We found that in the symbiosis-defective dnf1 mutant of M. truncatula, bacteroid and symbiosome development are blocked. We identified the DNF1 gene as encoding a subunit of a signal peptidase complex that is highly expressed in nodules. By analyzing data from whole-genome expression analysis, we propose that correct symbiosome development in M. truncatula requires the orderly secretion of protein constituents through coordinated up-regulation of a nodule-specific pathway exemplified by DNF1."
https://openalex.org/W2072139179,"Critical periods are times of pronounced brain plasticity. During a critical period in the postnatal development of the visual cortex, the occlusion of one eye triggers a rapid reorganization of neuronal responses, a process known as ocular dominance plasticity. We have shown that the transplantation of inhibitory neurons induces ocular dominance plasticity after the critical period. Transplanted inhibitory neurons receive excitatory synapses, make inhibitory synapses onto host cortical neurons, and promote plasticity when they reach a cellular age equivalent to that of endogenous inhibitory neurons during the normal critical period. These findings suggest that ocular dominance plasticity is regulated by the execution of a maturational program intrinsic to inhibitory neurons. By inducing plasticity, inhibitory neuron transplantation may facilitate brain repair."

Their function is regulated by the composition of their subunits, posttranslational modifications, and protein-protein interactions. Recently, several proteins that interact with AMPARs have been identified that affect their subcellular localization, synaptic stabilization, and kinetics. Using proteomic analysis, immunohistochemistry, and electrophysiology, von Engelhardt et al.

Despite extensive studies on SIRT1 function, how SIRT1 levels are regulated remains relatively unknown. Here, we report that the nuclear bile acid receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) inhibits microRNA-34a (miR-34a) in the liver, which results in a positive regulation of SIRT1 levels. Activation of FXR by the synthetic agonist GW4064 decreases hepatic miR-34a levels in normal mice, and consistently, hepatic miR-34a levels are elevated in FXR-null mice. FXR induces expression of small heterodimer partner (SHP), an orphan nuclear receptor and transcriptional corepressor, which in turn results in repression of p53, a key activator of the miR-34a gene, by inhibiting p53 occupancy at the promoter. MiR-34a decreased SIRT1 levels by binding to the 3′-untranslated region of SIRT1 mRNA, and adenovirus-mediated overexpression of miR-34a substantially decreased SIRT1 protein levels in mouse liver. Remarkably, miR-34a levels were elevated, and SIRT1 protein levels were reduced in diet-induced obese mice, and FXR activation in these mice reversed the miR-34a and SIRT1 levels, indicating an intriguing link among FXR activation, decreased miR-34a, and subsequently, increased SIRT1 levels. Our study demonstrates an unexpected role of the FXR/SHP pathway in controlling SIRT1 levels via miR-34a inhibition and that elevated miR-34a levels in obese mice contribute to decreased SIRT1 levels.

Our studies, at least in part, provide an explanation by showing that the FXR/SHP pathway plays a role in controlling hepatic SIRT1 levels via miR-34a inhibition and that elevated miR-34a levels in obese mice contribute to decreased SIRT1 protein levels.As summarized in Fig. 5E, in normal mice, hepatic miR-34a levels are regulated via a cascade pathway involving the nuclear bile acid receptor FXR and an orphan nuclear receptor and transcription corepressor SHP. Activation of FXR signaling inhibits the expression of hepatic miR-34a gene through the induction of SHP. SHP suppresses transcription of the miR-34a gene by inhibiting the promoter occupancy of p53, the key activator of the miR-34a gene. In contrast, in diet-induced obese mice, the FXR/SHP pathway is deregulated so that miR-34a levels are highly elevated, which contributes to reduced SIRT1 protein levels. Remarkably, activation of FXR in these obese mice by daily treatment with GW4064 for 5 days restores SIRT1 levels and decreases miR-34a levels. Edwards and colleagues (11Zhang Y. Lee F.Y. Barrera G. Lee H. Vales C. Gonzalez F.J. Willson T.M. Edwards P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 1006-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar) demonstrated previously that daily treatment of diabetic obese db/db mice with GW4064 for 5 days improved metabolic profiles by decreasing serum glucose and lipid levels. Therefore, our findings, together with these previous studies, indicate an intriguing link among FXR activation, decreased miR-34a levels, increased hepatic SIRT1 levels, and beneficial metabolic outcomes.The present studies demonstrate that FXR positively regulates hepatic SIRT1 levels through miR-34a inhibition. Interestingly, SIRT1 may positively regulate hepatic FXR as well. PGC-1α was shown to enhance FXR activity in the regulation of triglyceride metabolism during fasting by increasing expression of the FXR gene and also by coactivating FXR transactivation (33Zhang Y. Castellani L.W. Sinal C.J. Gonzalez F.J. Edwards P.A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 157-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Because SIRT1 deacetylates and increases PGC-1α activity (1Rodgers J.T. Lerin C. Haas W. Gygi S.P. Spiegelman B.M. Puigserver P. Nature. 2005; 434: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (2524) Google Scholar, 6Rodgers J.T. Lerin C. Gerhart-Hines Z. Puigserver P. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 46-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar), SIRT1 should increase FXR activity via modulation of PGC-1α activity. Further, we recently reported that SIRT1 increases FXR transactivation ability by dynamic deacetylation of FXR (28Kemper J.K. Xiao Z. Ponugoti B. Miao J. Fang S. Kanamaluru D. Tsang S. Wu S.Y. Chiang C.M. Veenstra T.D. Cell Metab. 2009; 10: 392-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). FXR acetylation inhibits its transactivation potential by inhibiting interaction of FXR with RXR and subsequently DNA binding (28Kemper J.K. Xiao Z. Ponugoti B. Miao J. Fang S. Kanamaluru D. Tsang S. Wu S.Y. Chiang C.M. Veenstra T.D. Cell Metab. 2009; 10: 392-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Although FXR acetylation is dynamically modulated by p300 and SIRT1, FXR acetylation levels are highly elevated in ob/ob mice and diet-induced obese mice (28Kemper J.K. Xiao Z. Ponugoti B. Miao J. Fang S. Kanamaluru D. Tsang S. Wu S.Y. Chiang C.M. Veenstra T.D. Cell Metab. 2009; 10: 392-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). These previous studies, along with current findings, suggest that an intriguing positive regulatory loop between FXR and SIRT1 is operating in hepatocytes in normal conditions. In obese mice, however, the FXR/SHP signaling may be deregulated because of highly elevated FXR acetylation levels, which results in elevated miR-34a levels.In accordance with important roles of FXR in regulating miR-34a and SIRT1 protein levels, miR-34 levels were elevated, and SIRT1 protein levels are substantially decreased in FXR-null mice. However, it is unclear and counterintuitive why activation of the nuclear bile acid receptor FXR, which would presumably occur during the fed state due to high levels of circulating bile acids, positively regulates SIRT1, which mediates hepatic fasting responses. In part, this probably results from our lack of complete understanding of the complex interplay of regulatory pathways in hepatic metabolism, but it may also reflect an adaptive process related to the continuous cycles of feeding and fasting. Staels and his colleagues (34Duran-Sandoval D. Cariou B. Percevault F. Hennuyer N. Grefhorst A. van Dijk T.H. Gonzalez F.J. Fruchart J.C. Kuipers F. Staels B. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 4076-4080Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) demonstrated that FXR plays an important role in adaptive responses during the transition from feeding to fasting and fasting-associated responses were markedly blunted in FXR-null mice. In line with these results, Auwerx and his colleagues (10Coste A. Louet J.F. Lagouge M. Lerin C. Antal M.C. Meziane H. Schoonjans K. Puigserver P. O'Malley B.W. Auwerx J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 17187-17192Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) demonstrated that SIRT1 levels are dynamically regulated under fasting and feeding in normal mice. SIRT1 levels were modestly increased upon short term fasting (6 h), but prominent expression was still observed in the fed state in normal mice (10Coste A. Louet J.F. Lagouge M. Lerin C. Antal M.C. Meziane H. Schoonjans K. Puigserver P. O'Malley B.W. Auwerx J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 17187-17192Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). We, therefore, envision that under normal conditions, FXR dynamically regulates metabolic pathways in response to fasting and feeding cycles, and activated FXR signaling during feeding would contribute to maintenance of basal levels of hepatic SIRT1 via miR-34a inhibition, which would allow for an efficient transition to the next fasting cycle. In contrast, this regulatory network is altered in metabolic disease states, resulting in constitutively elevated miR-34a levels and subsequently reduced SIRT1 levels in the liver.Recent studies demonstrate that SIRT1 deacetylates and inhibits p53 activity, which results in decreased expression of miR-34a (3Luo J.

Consistent with this feedback regulatory loop, we also observed that overexpression of SIRT1 in liver of diet-induced obese mice using tail vein injection of Ad-FLAG-SIRT1 substantially decreased hepatic miR-34a levels (supplemental Fig. S12). Furthermore, daily treatment for 1 week with resveratrol, which activates SIRT1, also decreased miR-34a levels in obese mice (supplemental Fig. S12). Resveratrol indirectly activates SIRT1 by AMP-activated protein kinase activation (38Hou X. Xu S. Maitland-Toolan K.A. Sato K. Jiang B. Ido Y. Lan F. Walsh K. Wierzbicki M. Verbeuren T.J. Cohen R.A.

Puigserver P. Auwerx J. Nature. 2009; 458: 1056-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (2266) Google Scholar), so the possibility that resveratrol is acting in a SIRT1-independent manner cannot be ruled out. However, the SIRT1 expression studies, combined with the resveratrol results, further support the existence of the regulatory loop between miR-34a and SIRT1 in hepatocytes in which SIRT1 inhibits expression of its own inhibitor, miR-34a, thereby further enhancing SIRT1 expression.MiRs are emerging as important cellular regulators critically involved in diverse biological pathways, including metabolic regulation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis (19Hobert O.

Approximately 30% of all human genes are thought to be regulated by miRs, and elevated levels of miRs have been detected in diverse pathophysiological conditions (20Esau C. Davis S. Murray S.F.

It will be important to see whether down-regulation of elevated miR-34a in obese mouse liver using anti-miR-34a approaches would increase hepatic SIRT1 levels and improve metabolic outcomes in these mice. Modulation of SIRT1 levels by manipulation of the FXR-miR-34a-SIRT1 pathway, therefore, may provide a novel therapeutic target for treating aging-related diseases, such as metabolic disorders and cancer, in which SIRT1 plays an important role.

Recent studies demonstrate that SIRT1 plays an important role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis in response to hormonal and nutritional fluctuations by modulating the activity of PGC-1α, a master metabolic regulator (5Rodgers J.T.

FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 46-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). During nutritional deprivation, SIRT1 promotes fat mobilization and suppresses adipogenesis and regulates hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism by activating key metabolic regulators, including PGC-1α (5Rodgers J.T.

However, the molecular basis by which SIRT1 levels are regulated under normal conditions and why they are substantially reduced in metabolic disease states remains largely unknown.The nuclear receptor, farnesoid X receptor (FXR), is the primary biosensor for endogenous bile acids and regulates expression of numerous genes involved in lipid and glucose metabolism (11Zhang Y.

https://openalex.org/W2008597980,"Many peptides, when released as chemical messengers within the brain, have powerful influences on complex behaviours. Most strikingly, vasopressin and oxytocin, once thought of as circulating hormones whose actions were confined to peripheral organs, are now known to be released in the brain, where they have fundamentally important roles in social behaviours. In humans, disruptions of these peptide systems have been linked to several neurobehavioural disorders, including Prader-Willi syndrome, affective disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder, and polymorphisms of V1a vasopressin receptor have been linked to autism. Here we report that the rat olfactory bulb contains a large population of interneurons which express vasopressin, that blocking the actions of vasopressin in the olfactory bulb impairs the social recognition abilities of rats and that vasopressin agonists and antagonists can modulate the processing of information by olfactory bulb neurons. The findings indicate that social information is processed in part by a vasopressin system intrinsic to the olfactory system."

IntroductionThe bacterial cell envelope represents an interface for the interaction of bacterial cells with host molecules, bacteriophages, other bacteria, and inanimate molecules or surfaces. The properties of bacterial cell surfaces are largely governed by proteins and glycopolymers, both of which have highly variable and often strain-specific compositions and roles (1Clarke S.R. Foster S.J. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 2006; 51: 187-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 2Weidenmaier C. Peschel A. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 6: 276-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Although many bacterial surface proteins have been studied in detail, our knowledge on structures, biosynthetic pathways, and functions of cell wall glycopolymers is still incomplete. Nevertheless, it has become clear that many bacterial cell wall glycopolymers are crucial for bacterial cell wall maintenance, fitness, or virulence and represent promising targets for vaccines or antimicrobial compounds (2Weidenmaier C. Peschel A. Nat. Rev.

WTA is composed of phosphate-containing repeating units with a very variable and often species-specific composition. Most S. aureus strains express polyribitol phosphate (Rbo-P)-type WTA, which is composed of repetitive d-ribitol units connected by 1,5-phosphodiester bonds (4Endl J. Seidl H.P. Fiedler F. Schleifer K.H. Arch. Microbiol. 1983; 135: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The repeating units can be further substituted with d-alanine at C2-OH and/or with 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranose (GlcNAc) at C4-OH via α- or β-glycosidic linkages whose relative abundance varies between individual strains (5Sanderson A.R.

Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 3046-3056Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and many of the involved enzymes have been characterized in vitro. The same holds true for the pathway of WTA and lipoteichoic acid alanylation, which consists of four proteins that activate d-alanine by ATP hydrolysis, link it to the dedicated carrier protein DltC, translocate it across the cytoplasmic membrane, and connect it with WTA or lipoteichoic acid repeating units (29Perego M.

Stewart K.D. Lambalot R.H. Neuhaus F.C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3869-3876Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, WTA glycosylation has hardly been investigated. Nevertheless, WTA β-GlcNAc-transferase activity (EC 2.4.1.70) has been detected in crude cell extracts of S. aureus strain Copenhagen in the 1960s (31Nathenson S.G. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 3161-3169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a S. aureus strain H mutant 52B2 deficient in WTA GlcNAc-transferase activity has been described (20Shaw D.R. Mirelman D. Chatterjee A.N. Park J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 5101-5106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the genetic basis of which has remained unknown.Here we report on the identification and characterization of a novel S. aureus protein TarM that is responsible for the glycosylation of WTA with α-GlcNAc and exhibits UDP-GlcNAc-dependent WTA GlcNAc-transferase activity in vitro. Moreover, we show that TarM bears a point mutation in the phage-resistant mutant S. aureus strain 52B2 that leads to a truncated and inactive TarM. Our study paves the way for elucidating the function of the sugar residues carried by WTA in S. aureus-bacteriophage and host interaction.DISCUSSIONAlthough substantial progress has been made in understanding why most Gram-positive bacteria produce WTA or related cell wall glycopolymers, the reasons for the enormous species- and strain-specific differences in WTA structures have remained largely obscure. The enzyme systems involved in biosynthesis of WTA backbones with Rbo-P or glycerol phosphate repeating units and subsequent modification with d-alanine have been elucidated (7Neuhaus F.C. Baddiley J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 686-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar, 46Bhavsar A.P. Brown E.D. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 1077-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 47Swoboda J.G. Campbell J. Meredith T.C. Walker S. ChemBioChem. 2010; 11: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) and represent a basis for generating defined panels of mutants or identifying the most promising target enzymes for new antibacterial compounds.Our study describes a missing module that further completes the picture of the WTA biosynthetic pathway. TarM is the first described enzyme catalyzing the glycosylation of the Rbo-P-type WTA and the first WTA glycosyltransferase whose function has been confirmed in vitro via a recombinant approach. Moreover, we present for the first time a detailed NMR spectrum of Rbo-P-type WTA with α-GlcNAc substitution from S. aureus. Together with the previously published NMR spectrum of Rbo-P WTA with β-GlcNAc substitution from strain MN8m (6Vinogradov E. Sadovskaya I. Li J. Jabbouri S. Carbohydr. Res. 2006; 341: 738-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) our study forms a solid basis for dissecting the structure and function of glycosylated WTA in S. aureus.Although WTA modification with d-alanine occurs extracellularly upon translocation of the polymer across the cytoplasmic membrane, it has remained unclear when and how WTA is modified with sugar residues. The fact that TarM lacks a signal peptide and is a soluble protein indicates that it remains in the cytoplasm. Moreover, its dependence on the activated sugar donor UDP-GlcNAc, which is not available in the cell envelope, strongly supports the notion that WTA glycosylation by TarM takes place before the lipid-linked WTA polymer is translocated to the outer leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane.TarM was active in vitro in the absence of any other WTA-biosynthetic enzyme, and it acted on polymeric WTA not connected to C55-P (undecaprenyl monophosphate). Thus, interaction with Rbo-P appears to be sufficient for TarM to glycosylate the acceptor substrate. It remains to be analyzed whether TarM acts independently of the rest of the WTA biosynthetic machinery whose components have been shown to form a multienzyme complex in B. subtilis (48Formstone A. Carballido-López R. Noirot P. Errington J. Scheffers D.J. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 1812-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) or whether TarM may interact with the WTA polymerase TarL or TarK (27Brown S. Zhang Y.H. Walker S. Chem. Biol. 2008; 15: 12-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 28Meredith T.C. Swoboda J.G. Walker S. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 3046-3056Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) in vivo.Of note, the fact that the tarM mutants K6 and 52B2 had no apparent growth defects and produced normal amounts of WTA (data not shown) indicates that the WTA translocase (probably formed by TagG and TagH) and the unknown ligase that links the polymer to peptidoglycan are not affected in their efficiency by the presence or absence of GlcNAc on the repeating units. This represents a difference to the teichoic acid translocase of Streptococcus pneumoniae, which has recently been shown to be unable to translocate polymers lacking the typical phosphocholine substituents (49Damjanovic M. Kharat A.S. Eberhardt A. Tomasz A. Vollmer W. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 7105-7111Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 50Vollmer W. Tomasz A. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1610-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).TarM is related to the group 1 family of glycosyltransferases, known activities of which include glucosyltransferases, rhamnosyltransferases, galatosyltransferases, and glucuronosyltransferases (Carbohydrate Active Enzymes data base) (51Cantarel B.L. Coutinho P.M. Rancurel C. Bernard T. Lombard V. Henrissat B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: D233-D238Crossref PubMed Scopus (4032) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, TarM does not share similarity with any mammalian, plant, or bacterial GlcNAc-transferase with experimentally proven activity and seems to represent a new type of GlcNAc-transferase. Moreover, we could identify proteins with clear homology to TarM in several other Gram-positive bacteria (Fig. 6) indicating that TarM is representative of a generally used WTA-biosynthetic enzymes. Of note, related proteins were absent from some bacteria known to produce glycosylated Rbo-P WTA such as Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Listeria monocytogenes, indicating that some bacteria must have alternative ways to glycosylate Rbo-P WTA.Probing the non-redundant protein data base UniProtKB with TarM, we found the most similar protein (excluding proteins from S. aureus) to be a putative glycosyltransferase with ID number C2C429 from Listeria grayi, whose WTA structure has never been elucidated. This protein shares 32% identity and 60% similarity with TarM over its entire length (Fig. 6). Surprisingly, we could not find TarM homologues in any other Listeria species, indicating that WTA glycosylation is also a species-specific process in the genus Listeria. Nevertheless, several genes involved in WTA glycosylation have previously been identified in different L. monocytogenes serotype 4b strains, whose WTA is composed of repeating units of →4)-β-d-GlcNAc-(1,4-Rbo-P)-(1→ disaccharides, where the GlcNAc can be further substituted with galactose or glucose at the 6-OH or 3-OH groups of GlcNAc, respectively (52Uchikawa K. Sekikawa I. Azuma I. J. Biochem. 1986; 99: 315-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These genes encode the putative glycosyltransferases GltA, GltB (53Lei X.H. Fiedler F. Lan Z. Kathariou S. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1133-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and GtcV (54Spears P.A. Suyemoto M.M. Palermo A.M. Horton J.R. Hamrick T.S. Havell E.A. Orndorff P.E. Infect. Immun. 2008; 76: 4046-4054Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and a protein of unknown function (GtcA (55Promadej N. Fiedler F. Cossart P. Dramsi S. Kathariou S. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 418-425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), none of which shares similarity with TarM.The WTA from B. subtilis strain W23 is a glucose-substituted Rbo-P polymer (22Glaser L. Ionesco H. Schaeffer P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 124: 415-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) with a similar structure as the one described in this study for S. aureus strain RN4220 except for the sugar substitution. We identified a TarM homologue with protein data base UniProtKB accession number B7ZDM0 in B. subtilis W23 that shares 29% identity and 60% similarity with RN4220 TarM. Because its gene is located in the vicinity of the WTA and teichuronic acid gene cluster of B. subtilis W23, it is likely to be a glucosyltransferase involved in the transfer of glucose residues to the WTA backbone. The TagE protein (also called GtaA and RodD) of B. subtilis 168 has been implicated in the transfer of glucose residues to glycerol phosphate WTA by indirect genetic evidence (56Mauël C. Young M. Margot P. Karamata D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 215: 388-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 57Honeyman A.L. Stewart G.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 1257-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The size of TagE is bigger and shares also weak similarity with TarM.In addition, less well conserved homologues of TarM were found in Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus capitis, Staphylococcus warneri, and Bacillus clausii, whose WTA molecules are composed of either glycerol phosphate, of other none Rbo-P repeating units (4Endl J. Seidl H.P. Fiedler F. Schleifer K.H. Arch. Microbiol. 1983; 135: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), or have not yet been analyzed. Sequence comparison of these TarM homologous proteins yielded similarities over the entire lengths of the proteins (Fig. 6), suggesting that the specificity for the Rbo-P acceptor substrate is governed by only subtle differences in primary or tertiary structure of TarM-related enzymes. Future elucidation of the three-dimensional structure of TarM will help to understand the molecular basis of substrate specificity and catalysis of TarM.Previous studies have demonstrated that certain S. aureus strains produce WTA with either only α-GlcNAc (strain 3528) or β-GlcNAc (strain Duncan) or with both types of linkages (strain Copenhagen) (17Nathenson S.G. Ishimoto N. Anderson J.S. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 651-658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Nathenson S.G. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 3839-3841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Of note, these differences have critical consequences for the capacity of WTA to elicit specific immune responses. For example, Juergens et al. (16Juergens W.G. Sanderson A.R. Strominger J.L. J. Exp. Med. 1963; 117: 925-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) found that WTA of S. aureus Copenhagen elicited antibodies in rabbits that were only directed to α-GlcNAc-modified Rbo-P but not to the β-linked epitopes. It is tempting to speculate that the modification of WTA with GlcNAc in different conformations may contribute to the immune evasion strategies of S. aureus that limit the ability of host organisms to raise a protective immune response. In addition, it seems that the WTA GlcNAc residues contribute to staphylococcal adhesion to epithelial and endothelial cells via interaction with host lectin-like receptor in a protein-carbohydrate interactions-involving process (8Weidenmaier C. Kokai-Kun J.F. Kristian S.A. Chanturiya T. Kalbacher H. Gross M. Nicholson G. Neumeister B. Mond J.J. Peschel A. Nat.

Microbiol. 2008; 298: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), which is reminiscent of the mechanism of phage binding to S. aureus cells. Future studies will help to identify the binding partners and roles of the WTA GlcNAc substituents in Staphylococcus-host interaction.In conclusion, our study closes a critical gap in the knowledge on WTA biosynthesis and represents a good basis for future studies on the role of WTA glycosylation in microbe-host interaction. With the increasing consideration of phages as antimicrobial agents against severe pathogens such as S. aureus, it becomes more and more important to understand the molecular basis of phage adsorption and infection. In this respect our results may be of critical importance for the identification of receptor-binding proteins and lytic enzymes from staphylococcal phages that might be used as antimicrobial agents. IntroductionThe bacterial cell envelope represents an interface for the interaction of bacterial cells with host molecules, bacteriophages, other bacteria, and inanimate molecules or surfaces. The properties of bacterial cell surfaces are largely governed by proteins and glycopolymers, both of which have highly variable and often strain-specific compositions and roles (1Clarke S.R. Foster S.J. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 2006; 51: 187-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 2Weidenmaier C. Peschel A. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 6: 276-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Although many bacterial surface proteins have been studied in detail, our knowledge on structures, biosynthetic pathways, and functions of cell wall glycopolymers is still incomplete. Nevertheless, it has become clear that many bacterial cell wall glycopolymers are crucial for bacterial cell wall maintenance, fitness, or virulence and represent promising targets for vaccines or antimicrobial compounds (2Weidenmaier C. Peschel A. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 6: 276-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar).Staphylococcus aureus and most other Gram-positive bacteria express teichoic acid polymers at their surfaces that are either linked to membrane lipids (lipoteichoic acid) or to peptidoglycan (wall teichoic acid (WTA) 2The abbreviations used are: WTAwall teichoic acidTagteichoic acid glycerol phosphateTarteichoic acid ribitol phosphate typeRbo-Ppolyribitol phosphateWGAwheat germ agglutininMES2-(4-morpholino)-ethane-sulfonic acidCOSY1H,1H correlation spectroscopyTOCSYtotal correlation spectroscopyROESYrotating-frame nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopyHSQC-DEPT13C,1H single quantum correlation distortionless enhancement by polarization transferHMBCheteronuclear multiple bond correlation experiment1H,31P HMQC-TOCSY1H,31P multiple quantum correlation-total correlation spectroscopyHRPhorseradish peroxidaseGLCgas-liquid chromatographyTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine.) (3Xia G. Kohler T. Peschel A. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2010; 300: 148-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). WTA is composed of phosphate-containing repeating units with a very variable and often species-specific composition. Most S. aureus strains express polyribitol phosphate (Rbo-P)-type WTA, which is composed of repetitive d-ribitol units connected by 1,5-phosphodiester bonds (4Endl J. Seidl H.P. Fiedler F. Schleifer K.H. Arch. Microbiol. 1983; 135: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The repeating units can be further substituted with d-alanine at C2-OH and/or with 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranose (GlcNAc) at C4-OH via α- or β-glycosidic linkages whose relative abundance varies between individual strains (5Sanderson A.R.

Res. 2006; 341: 738-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). WTA accounts for a major portion of the total dry weight of the staphylococcal cell wall (7Neuhaus F.C. Baddiley J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 686-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar) but does not play an essential role for S. aureus viability under laboratory conditions (8Weidenmaier C. Kokai-Kun J.F.

Of note, WTA is of pivotal importance during host colonization and infection inasmuch as it facilitates attachment of the bacteria to WTA binding epithelial or endothelial cell receptors (8Weidenmaier C.

https://openalex.org/W2071495644,"The recently discovered 'hot Jupiter' extrasolar planet WASP-12b is orbiting at a mean distance of only 3.1 stellar radii from its host star, with an orbital period of only 26 hours. Its radius, about 1.8 times that of Jupiter, is unexpectedly large compared to most gas giants of similar mass and orbital period. A new analysis of WASP-12b's properties suggests that the energy sustaining its inflated size comes from tidal forces that cause the atmosphere to escape the planet's gravitational pull and flow towards the host star. As well as losing mass, the planet's shape is distorted into an ellipse by these extreme forces. WASP-12b is a planet of 1.4 Jupiter masses that orbits at a mean distance of only 3.1 stellar radii from its star; its orbital period is 1.1 days, and its radius (1.79 times that of Jupiter) is unexpectedly large. An analysis of its properties now reveals that the planet is losing mass to its host star at a rate of ∼10−7 Jupiter masses per year, and that dissipation of the star's tidal perturbation in the planet's convective envelope provides the energy source for its large volume. The class of exotic Jupiter-mass planets that orbit very close to their parent stars were not explicitly expected before their discovery1. The recently discovered2 transiting planet WASP-12b has a mass M = 1.4 ± 0.1 Jupiter masses (MJ), a mean orbital distance of only 3.1 stellar radii (meaning it is subject to intense tidal forces), and a period of 1.1 days. Its radius 1.79 ± 0.09RJ is unexpectedly large and its orbital eccentricity 0.049 ± 0.015 is even more surprising because such close orbits are usually quickly circularized. Here we report an analysis of its properties, which reveals that the planet is losing mass to its host star at a rate of about 10-7MJ per year. The planet’s surface is distorted by the star’s gravity and the light curve produced by its prolate shape will differ by about ten per cent from that of a spherical planet. We conclude that dissipation of the star’s tidal perturbation in the planet’s convective envelope provides the energy source for its large volume. We predict up to 10 mJy CO band-head (2.292 μm) emission from a tenuous disk around the host star, made up of tidally stripped planetary gas. It may also contain a detectable resonant super-Earth, as a hypothetical perturber that continually stirs up WASP-12b’s eccentricity."
https://openalex.org/W2032268426,"Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) has a pivotal role in oxygen homeostasis and cardioprotection mediated by ischemic preconditioning. Its stability is regulated by HIF prolyl 4-hydroxylases (HIF-P4Hs), the inhibition of which is regarded as a promising strategy for treating diseases such as anemia and ischemia. We generated a viable Hif-p4h-2 hypomorph mouse line (Hif-p4h-2gt/gt) that expresses decreased amounts of wild-type Hif-p4h-2 mRNA: 8% in the heart; 15% in the skeletal muscle; 34–47% in the kidney, spleen, lung, and bladder; 60% in the brain; and 85% in the liver. These mice have no polycythemia and show no signs of the dilated cardiomyopathy or hyperactive angiogenesis observed in mice with broad spectrum conditional Hif-p4h-2 inactivation. We focused here on the effects of chronic Hif-p4h-2 deficiency in the heart. Hif-1 and Hif-2 were stabilized, and the mRNA levels of glucose transporter-1, several enzymes of glycolysis, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1, angiopoietin-2, and adrenomedullin were increased in the Hif-p4h-2gt/gt hearts. When isolated Hif-p4h-2gt/gt hearts were subjected to ischemia-reperfusion, the recovery of mechanical function and coronary flow rate was significantly better than in wild type, while cumulative release of lactate dehydrogenase reflecting the infarct size was reduced. The preischemic amount of lactate was increased, and the ischemic versus preischemic [CrP]/[Cr] and [ATP] remained at higher levels in Hif-p4h-2gt/gt hearts, indicating enhanced glycolysis and an improved cellular energy state. Our data suggest that chronic stabilization of Hif-1α and Hif-2α by genetic knockdown of Hif-p4h-2 promotes cardioprotection by induction of many genes involved in glucose metabolism, cardiac function, and blood pressure.

Hif-1 and Hif-2 were stabilized, and the mRNA levels of glucose transporter-1, several enzymes of glycolysis, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1, angiopoietin-2, and adrenomedullin were increased in the Hif-p4h-2gt/gt hearts. When isolated Hif-p4h-2gt/gt hearts were subjected to ischemia-reperfusion, the recovery of mechanical function and coronary flow rate was significantly better than in wild type, while cumulative release of lactate dehydrogenase reflecting the infarct size was reduced. The preischemic amount of lactate was increased, and the ischemic versus preischemic [CrP]/[Cr] and [ATP] remained at higher levels in Hif-p4h-2gt/gt hearts, indicating enhanced glycolysis and an improved cellular energy state. Our data suggest that chronic stabilization of Hif-1α and Hif-2α by genetic knockdown of Hif-p4h-2 promotes cardioprotection by induction of many genes involved in glucose metabolism, cardiac function, and blood pressure.

A fourth P4H with an endoplasmic reticulum transmembrane domain is also capable of hydroxylating HIF-α in vitro and in cultured cells, but it remains to be established whether it also participates in the regulation of HIF-α in vivo (10Oehme F.

Furthermore, Hif-p4h-2 null mice die during embryonic development because of severe placental and cardiac defects, the latter of which are not due to elevated Hif-α levels, whereas Hif-p4h-1 and Hif-p4h-3 null mice are viable (14Takeda K.

Hif-p4h-1 and Hif-p4h-3 null mice have no hematopoietic or angiogenic defects, but Hif-p4h-1/Hif-p4h-3 double knock-out leads to moderate erythrocytosis caused by an accumulation of Hif-2α in the liver and activation of the hepatic erythropoietin (Epo) pathway, whereas inactivation of Hif-p4h-2 causes activation of the renal Epo pathway (15Takeda K.

Hif-p4h-1 null mice have lowered oxygen consumption caused by reprogramming of the basal metabolism toward anaerobic energy production, increased hypoxia tolerance, and protection against acute severe ischemia in the skeletal muscle (19Aragonés J.

Hif-p4h-3 null mice have abnormal sympathoadrenal development and function, leading to reduced catecholamine secretion and systemic blood pressure (20Bishop T. Gallagher D. Pascual A.

Studies with HIF-P4H-inhibiting small molecule compounds have indicated that pharmacologic HIF activation appears promising as a strategy for treating diseases associated with acute or chronic hypoxia, such as anemia, myocardial infarction, and stroke (1Kaelin Jr., W.G. Ratcliffe P.J. Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 393-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2208) Google Scholar, 2Fraisl P. Aragonés J. Carmeliet P. Nat. Rev.

Med. 2008; 40: 402-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). HIF-1α also plays a central role in the tissue protection induced by ischemic preconditioning (IP), i.e. cytoprotective adaptation triggered by brief periods of sublethal ischemia. In the case of the heart, this is evident from data showing that IP-induced acute cardioprotection was lost in heterozygous Hif-1α null mice (22Cai Z. Zhong H. Bosch-Marce M. Fox-Talbot K. Wang L. Wei C. Trush M.A. Semenza G.L. Cardiovasc. Res. 2008; 77: 463-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and in Hif-1α siRNA-treated mice (23Eckle T. Köhler D. Lehmann R. El Kasmi K. Eltzschig H.K. Circulation. 2008; 118: 166-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) and that acute in vivo stabilization of Hif-1α by administration of the Hif-p4h inhibitor dimethyloxalylglycine or by introduction of Hif-p4h-2 siRNA into the left ventricle of the heart led to cardioprotection (23Eckle T. Köhler D. Lehmann R. El Kasmi K. Eltzschig H.K. Circulation. 2008; 118: 166-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Furthermore, intramyocardial injection of Hif-p4h-2 small hairpin RNA led to significant improvement in angiogenesis and contractility following ligation of left anterior descending artery in mice (24Huang M. Chan D.A. Jia F. Xie X. Li Z. Hoyt G. Robbins R.C. Chen X. Giaccia A.J. Wu J.C. Circulation. 2008; 118: S226-S233Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). On the other hand, broad spectrum conditional inactivation of Hif-p4h-2 in utero at day 17.5 postfertilization led to congestive heart failure, with enlarged cardiomyocytes and increased contraction band necrosis indicative of early cardiac ischemia (17Minamishima Y.A. Moslehi J. Bardeesy N. Cullen D. Bronson R.T. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Blood. 2008; 111: 3236-3244Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). It was regarded as possible that these changes might be indirect consequences of the severe polycythemia, volume overload, and hyperviscosity present in these mice, but it was also possible that the cardiomyopathy could have been a direct consequence of chronic, high level Hif activation in the cardiac myocytes (17Minamishima Y.A. Moslehi J. Bardeesy N. Cullen D. Bronson R.T. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Blood. 2008; 111: 3236-3244Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). When Hif-p4h-2 was inactivated later, at 3 weeks of age, the hearts were only minimally enlarged, retained normal systolic function in vivo, and had only few myocytes showing degenerative changes (25Minamishima Y.A. Moslehi J. Padera R.F. Bronson R.T. Liao R. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 5729-5741Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We have produced mice in which the Hif-p4h-2 gene is disrupted by a GeneTrap (gt) insertion cassette. Because Hif-p4h-2 knock-out mice die during embryonic development (14Takeda K. Ho V.C. Takeda H. Duan L.J. Nagy A. Fong G.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 8336-8346Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), we expected to obtain only Hif-p4h-2+/+ and Hif-p4h-2+/gt mice from the heterozygous matings. Surprisingly, we also obtained Hif-p4h-2gt/gt mice, which appeared to be healthy and fertile and to have a normal lifespan. Analysis of the tissues of these mice showed that varying amounts of wild-type Hif-p4h-2 mRNA were generated from the gene-trapped alleles in different tissues, because of partial skipping of the insertion cassette, the lowest amount of wild-type Hif-p4h-2 mRNA, 8% of that in the wild-type mice, being found in the heart. Because these mice have no polycythemia, they appeared to offer an excellent model for studying the consequences of chronic high level activation of Hif-1α and Hif-2α in the heart. An embryonic stem cell line RRG405 with a GeneTrap targeting vector containing a β-galactosidase reporter in intron 1 of the Hif-p4h-2 gene (Research Consortium BayGenomics) was obtained from the Mutant Mouse Regional Resource Center (University of California, Davis). The cells were expanded and injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts, and the mice were generated. The mice were genotyped by PCR using a primer pair from intron 1 of Hif-p4h-2 (arrows 2 and 3 in Fig. 1A) and a Hif-p4h-2-specific forward primer and a β-galactosidase-specific reverse primer (arrows 2 and 5 in Fig. 1A), producing 1050- and 2500-bp fragments from the wild-type and targeted alleles, respectively. Primer sequences are given in supplemental Table S1. To verify correct targeting, genomic DNA was digested with EcoRI and hybridized with a probe generated by PCR from Hif-p4h-2 intron 1 (black bar in Fig. 1A). All of the animal experiments were performed according to protocols approved by the Provincial State Office of Southern Finland. Tissues were quickly dissected immediately after the mice had been sacrificed, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C. Total RNA was isolated using TriPure isolation reagent (Roche Applied Science) and further purified with an EZNA total RNA kit (OMEGA Bio-tek), and reverse transcription was performed with an iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). Wild-type Hif-p4h-2 mRNA was amplified in RT-PCR using primers from exons 1 and 5 (arrows 1 and 4 in Fig. 1A), and the generation of a transcript containing the GeneTrap cassette was analyzed using primers indicated by arrows 1 and 5 (Fig. 1A). β-Actin was used to verify equal amounts of template in RT-PCR. Q-PCR was performed with either iTaq SYBR Green Supermix with ROX (Bio-Rad) or Brilliant II SYBR Green Q-PCR Master Mix (Stratagene) and the Stratagene MX3005 thermocycler. The sequences for the primers used in RT-PCR and Q-PCR are listed in supplemental Table S1. The sets of primers for Hif-1α, Hif-2α, Epo, vascular endothelial growth factor A (Vegf-a), BCL2/adenovirus E1B interacting protein-3 (Bnip-3), phosphoglycerate kinase-1, angiopoietin-1 and -2 (Ang-1 and -2), Cd73, adenosine receptor A2b, and apelin were according to previously published sequences (14Takeda K.

Quantitect primer assays (Qiagen) were used for lysyl oxidase, myoglobin, glucose transporter-1 and -4 (Glut-1 and -4), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, DNA damage-inducible transcript 4 (Redd-1), triose phosphate isomerase, enolase-1, aldolase A, pyryvate dehydrogenase kinase-1 and -4 (Pdk-1 and -4), hexokinase-1 and -2, phosphofructokinase-L, lactate dehydrogenase A, peroxisome proliferator activator α (Pparα), and glucokinase-1. The expression data were normalized to β-actin or TATA-binding protein. Microarray analysis of RNA samples of Hif-p4h-2gt/gt and wild-type hearts on Gene Chip mouse genome 430 2.0 array was carried out according to protocols provided by the chip manufacturer (Affymetrix) in the Gene Analysis Services Core Facility of Biocenter Oulu. For Western blotting, snap-frozen tissues were crushed to a powder, lysed in 3 m urea supplemented with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 75 mm NaCl, and 0.25% Nonidet P-40, and centrifuged. In the case of skeletal muscle, a buffer containing 75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 15% SDS, 20% glycerol, 5% mercaptoethanol, and 0.001% bromphenol blue and homogenization with an Ultra-Turrax homogenizer was used to increase solubility. The supernatant protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad protein assay), and the supernatants were resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). Western blots were blocked with Tris-buffered saline with 5% nonfat dry milk and probed with the following primary antibodies: anti-HIF-1α (NB100-479; Novus Biologicals), anti-HIF-2α (a gift from FibroGen Inc.), anti-HIF prolyl hydroxylase 2 (NB100-2219; Novus Biologicals), anti-HIF prolyl hydroxylase 1 (NB100-310; Novus Biologicals), anti-HIF-β (611078; BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-glucose transporter-1 (NB300-666; Novus Biologicals), anti-pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1 (KAP-PK112; Assay Designs), and anti-α-tubulin (B-6199; Sigma-Aldrich). Bound antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Dako) and ECL detection reagents (Thermo Scientific). Terminal blood samples from the inferior vena cava of adult mice were drawn into syringes containing EDTA, and complete blood counts were measured with Cell-Dyn Sapphire (Abbott). The samples were allowed to clot overnight at 4 °C followed by centrifugation for 20 min at 1000 × g, and serum Epo and Vegf-a levels were determined with the Quantikine Mouse Epo and Vegf Immunoassay kits (R & D Systems). Dissected hearts were fixed in fresh 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C overnight. The specimens were washed with 0.15 m NaCl in 0.02 m phosphate, pH 7.4, and transferred to 70% ethanol, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. For the cryosections, paraformaldehyde-fixed specimens were transferred to 15% sucrose at 4 °C for 1 h, followed by overnight incubation in 30% sucrose at 4 °C and embedding in OTC compound (Sakura). 5-μm sections were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histology. The paraffin and cryosections were stained with rat anti-mouse Pecam-1 (MEC13.3, BD Pharmingen) using the TSA indirect kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rat antibody (Invitrogen), respectively. The sections were viewed and photographed with either a Leica DM LB2 microscope equipped with a Leica DFC 320 camera or with an Olympus BX51 microscope equipped with an Olympus DP50 camera, and the Pecam-1-stained vessels were quantified from 10 photomicrographs/mouse. β-Galactosidase activity was detected by X-gal staining. Staining of embryos and adult tissues was performed as described earlier (28Wurst W. Gossler A. Joyner A.L. Gene Targeting: A Practical Approach. 2nd Ed. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, New York2000: 234-236Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The embryos or tissue samples were stained overnight at room temperature in 2 mg/ml X-gal, 10 mm K3Fe(CN)6, 10 mm K4Fe(CN)6, 0.01% sodium deoxycholate, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, and the staining was followed by fixation in 10% formalin. The fixed tissues were processed for paraffin sections, and background was stained with eosin. Heart samples were fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde and 4% formaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, postfixed in 1% osmiumtetroxide, dehydrated in acetone, and embedded in Epon LX 112 (Ladd Research Industries). Thin sections were cut with a Leica Ultracut UCT ultramicrotome, stained in uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined in a Philips CM100 transmission electron microscope. The images were captured using a Morada CCD camera (Olympus Soft Imaging Solutions). The experiments were performed with 2–5-month-old female Hif-p4h-2gt/gt mice and age- and gender-matched controls. The mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation followed by decapitation. The aorta was immediately cannulated, and perfusion was started in situ with ice-cold Krebs-Henseleit buffer (10 mmol/liter glucose, 118 mmol/liter NaCl, 4.7 mmol/liter KCl, 2.5 mmol/liter CaCl2, 0.5 mmol/liter EDTA, 1.2 mmol/liter MgSO4, 25 mmol/liter NaHCO3, and 1.2 mmol/liter KH2PO4, pH 7.4). The heart was excised and enclosed in a thermostatic chamber, and perfusion was continued with a constant pressure of 100 cm H2O with Krebs-Henseleit buffer maintained at 37 °C and gassed continuously with a mixture of 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Continuous monitoring of left ventricular pressure, measurement of the coronary flow rate, and calculation of the heart rate, left ventricle peak systolic pressure, left ventricle minimum diastolic pressure, and left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP = left ventricle peak systolic pressure − left ventricle minimum diastolic pressure) was performed as described (29Karpanen T. Bry M. Ollila H.M. Seppänen-Laakso T. Liimatta E. Leskinen H. Kivelä R. Helkamaa T. Merentie M. Jeltsch M. Paavonen K. Andersson L.C. Mervaala E. Hassinen I.E. Ylä-Herttuala S. Oresic M. Alitalo K.

The hearts were subjected to at least 30 min of stabilization perfusion, after which global ischemia was induced by cessation of perfusion for 20 min, followed by reperfusion for 45 min. The venous effluent from the heart was collected in 5-min aliquots, and lactate dehydrogenase washout was measured as described earlier (30Bergmeyer H.U. Bernt E. Bergmeyer H.U. Methoden der Enzymatischen Analyse. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim1970: 533-538Google Scholar). Hearts from female Hif-p4h-2gt/gt mice and age- and gender-matched controls were subjected to either the stabilization perfusion alone (preischemia) or stabilization perfusion followed by a 20-min global ischemia (end ischemia), after which the hearts were immediately snap-frozen with precooled aluminum clamps, transferred to liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C until further processing. Frozen heart tissue was immersed in 8% perchloric acid in 40% (v/v) ethanol precooled to −20 °C and homogenized immediately with an Ultra-Turrax homogenizer followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 3200 × g. The supernatant was neutralized with 3.75 mol/liter K2CO3 containing 0.5 mol/liter triethanolamine hydrochloride (31Lamprecht W. Stein P. Heinz F. Weisser H. Bergmeyer H.U.

The statistical analyses were performed using Student's two-tailed t test. The area under the curve (AUC) during the 45-min post-ischemic period was calculated using the method of summary measures (35Matthews J.N. Altman D.G. Campbell M.J. Royston P. Brit. Med. J. 1990; 300: 230-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (2766) Google Scholar). The data are shown as the means ± S.D. or S.E. Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001). We generated mice having their Hif-p4h-2 gene disrupted within intron 1 by a GeneTrap insertion cassette containing a β-galactosidase reporter (Fig. 1A). Genotyping (Fig. 1B) of the pups (n = 470) indicated that 28.9% were Hif-p4h-2+/+, 59.4% Hif-p4h-2+/gt, and 11.7% Hif-p4h-2gt/gt. The Hif-p4h-2gt/gt percentage was lower than expected for normal Mendelian inheritance, but otherwise the Hif-p4h-2gt/gt mice appeared to be healthy and fertile and to have a normal lifespan. Similarly, the Hif-p4h-2gt/gt pup percentage (36%) was reduced in the Hif-p4h-2+/gt and Hif-p4h-2gt/gt intercrosses (n = 50 offspring). The body weights of the Hif-p4h-2gt/gt mice (21.8 ± 1.8 g, n = 14) were ∼88% of those of the wild type (24.8 ± 1.5 g, n = 13) (p < 0.0001). RT-PCR of the heart RNA of Hif-p4h-2gt/gt mice showed that a small amount of wild-type Hif-p4h-2 mRNA was generated from the gene-trapped alleles (Fig. 1C), so that recognition of the splicing acceptor sequence in the 5′ end o"

However, whether and how SUMO2/3-specific proteases are involved in de-conjugation under cell stress is unclear. Here, we show that low doses of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) induce an increase of the SENP3 protein, which removes SUMO2/3 from promyelocytic leukemia (PML). Low dose H2O2 causes SENP3 to co-localize with PML bodies and reduces the number of PML bodies in a SENP3-dependent manner. Furthermore, de-conjugation of SUMO2/3 from PML is responsible for the accelerated cell proliferation caused by low dose H2O2. Knocking down PML promotes basal cell proliferation as expected. This can be reversed by reconstitution with wild-type PML but not its mutant lacking SUMOylation, indicating that only the SUMOylated PML can play an inhibitory role for cell proliferation. Thus, SENP3 appears to be a key mediator in mild oxidative stress-induced cell proliferation via regulation of the SUMOylation status of PML. Furthermore, SENP3 is over-accumulated in a variety of primary human cancers including colon adenocarcinoma in which PML is hypo-SUMOylated.

The SUMO family includes SUMO1, SUMO2, and SUMO3. SUMO2 and -3 share only about 46% sequence similarity to SUMO1 but share 96% similarity to each other (1Yeh E.T. Gong L. Kamitani T. Gene. 2000; 248: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The majority of SUMO1 is conjugated to substrates. In contrast, SUMO2 and -3, referred to as SUMO2/3, are unconjugated but can rapidly convert to be conjugated in response to a variety of cellular stresses (2Saitoh H. Hinchey J. J. Biol.

De-conjugation or de-SUMOylation reactions are catalyzed by a family of SUMO-specific proteases named SENPs. Among the six kinds of SENPs identified in mammals to date, SENP3, SENP5, and SENP6 have preferences for SUMO2/3 (8Gong L. Yeh E.T. J. Biol.

Therefore, the conjugation and de-conjugation of SUMO2/3 to a given protein at a given time must be sophisticatedly controlled. However, although the functional study of the SUMO2/3-specific proteases SENP3, SENP5, or SENP6 has recently begun (9Mukhopadhyay D. Ayaydin F. Kolli N. Tan S.H. Anan T. Kametaka A. Azuma Y.

Oxidative stress is the most common stress that cells may encounter. An increase in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS)2 may result not only from oxidants and radiation but also from many extracellular insults that threaten cellular homeostasis, such as changes in temperature, pH, osmotic pressure, oxygen tension, and sugar concentration (20Halliwell B. FEBS Lett. 2003; 540: 3-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The extent and duration of ROS increase usually determines the consequences of the cellular adaptive response to the oxidative stress. Although severe oxidative stress causes cell senescence and even cell death, mild oxidative stress paradoxically promotes cell survival and even proliferation, during which global alterations of gene expression and protein post-translational modifications occur (21Halliwell B. Biochem. J. 2007; 401: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). We have recently found that SENP3 is rapidly increased in response to a mild oxidative stress, acting as a redox sensor. Moreover, SENP3, acting as an effector, participates in the cellular adaptive response by de-conjugating SUMO2/3 from a number of proteins including p300 (22Huang C. Han Y. Wang Y. Sun X. Yan S. Yeh E.T. Chen Y. Cang H. Li H. Shi G. Cheng J. Tang X. Yi J. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 2748-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). It is, therefore, interesting and critical to identify the key substrates for SENP3 and their physiological roles in the cellular behaviors under an oxidative stress context. Promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein and its associated nuclear bodies have been intensively studied due to the disruption or alteration of PML nuclear bodies (PML bodies) in several pathogenic conditions, including acute promyelocytic leukemia and viral infections as well as a variety of cellular stresses (23Dellaire G. Bazett-Jones D.P. BioEssays. 2004; 26: 963-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 24Beech S.J. Lethbridge K.J. Killick N. McGlincy N. Leppard K.N. Exp.

To date, PML has been suggested to play important roles in the control of cell fate as a proapoptotic factor (26Quignon F. De Bels F. Koken M. Feunteun J. Ameisen J.C. de Thé H. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 27Wang Z.G. Ruggero D. Ronchetti S. Zhong S. Gaboli M. Rivi R. Pandolfi P.P. Nat.

Biol. 1994; 14: 6858-6867Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Knock-out of PML leads to the acceleration of cell proliferation (27Wang Z.G. Ruggero D. Ronchetti S. Zhong S. Gaboli M. Rivi R. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 266-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has been reported that SUMO1 and SUMO2/3 modifications are required for the stability of PML and its localization in the nuclear bodies (30Boddy M.N. Howe K. Etkin L.D. Solomon E. Freemont P.S. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 971-982PubMed Google Scholar, 31Fu C. Ahmed K. Ding H. Ding X. Lan J. Yang Z. Miao Y. Zhu Y. Shi Y. Zhu J. Huang H. Yao X. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 5401-5413Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PML has been indicated to be the first potential substrate for SENP3 (8Gong L. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15869-15877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), and it can also be regulated by SENP1 (32Ohbayashi N. Kawakami S. Muromoto R. Togi S. Ikeda O.

Chem. 2000; 275: 3355-3359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and SENP6 (9Mukhopadhyay D. Ayaydin F. Kolli N. Tan S.H. Anan T. Kametaka A. Azuma Y. Wilkinson K.D. Dasso M. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 939-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We, therefore, have investigated whether PML is the physiological substrate for SENP3 under oxidative stress and whether its de-SUMO2/3 is correlated with its role in regulating cell proliferation. We herein report that PML is modified by SUMO2/3 under the normal state and that SENP3 removes SUMO2/3 from PML under mild oxidative stress. The low dose H2O2 can decrease the number of PML bodies and promote cell proliferation, both of which depend on the de-conjugation activity of SENP3. We have also found that SENP3 is accumulated in a variety of primary human cancers in which an attenuated SUMO2/3 modification on PML may occur. These results reveal for the first time the essential role of SENP3-mediated de-SUMOylation of PML for cell proliferation in response to oxidative stress and its plausible association with human cancers. HeLa cells and NIH3T3 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum (Biochrom AG). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were cultured in M200 medium containing the low serum growth supplement (provided by Cascade, Portland, OR). All media were supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 mg/liter streptomycin. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Cells were exposed to H2O2 at various doses for different time as indicated. Cells were seeded at 20% confluence and were treated with H2O2 once a day. Proliferation was assayed using two approaches for assessing living cell numbers. Cell viability was first analyzed using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT, Sango, China) assay, as previously described (34Huang X.Z. Wang J. Huang C. Chen Y.Y. Shi G.Y. Hu Q.S. Yi J. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2008; 7: 468-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Living cell number was double-checked based on trypan blue exclusion using a hemocytometer. In addition, to eliminate the possibility that apoptosis might contribute to the decrease in living cell number, Hoechst 33342/propidium iodide fluorescence staining was performed to visualize the apoptotic cells, and the result excluded apoptosis under the contexts in the present study. The results of the MTT assay and cell counting were, thus, used to reflect cell proliferation. Cell culture medium was replaced by medium containing 2% serum for a 24-h culture to synchronize cell proliferation. Cell monolayers were exposed to H2O2 for 6 h and then labeled with 30 μm BrdUrd for 1 h. Cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, permeated in 4 m hydrochloric acid for 15 min, and blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin for 30 min before incubation with the mouse monoclonal antibody against BrdUrd (1:50, Boster Bio-Technology, BM0201) at 4 °C overnight. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with fluorescent isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (DAKO A/S) for 2 h at room temperature. Nuclei were counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Cells were then examined under an Axioplan 2 fluorescent microscope (Zeiss, Germany), and the BrdUrd incorporation rate was quantified by automatically counting the BrdUrd-positive cells in DAPI-stained cells within four random fields (×40) using Zeiss KS400 software (Version 2.2). Cells were exposed to H2O2 for 6 h and then trypsinized and washed before being fixed by absolute ethanol for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were centrifuged and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 50 μg/ml propidium iodide. RNase was added and incubated for another 3 h at 4 °C. The intensity of propidium iodide staining of DNA was measured, and the cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickson). The constructs for wild-type SENP3 were prepared as previously described (8Gong L. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15869-15877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Various tagged constructs were generated using standard techniques by cloning the full-length cDNA into the pcDNA3-tag vectors. The RGS-His (RH)- and HA-tagged PML constructs encoded PML isoform IV. The HA-tagged PML mutant construct designed to lack all three SUMOylation sites (PML-SM) was made by site-directed mutagenesis based on the RH-PML wild-type construct (WT) using a QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The three sites of mutation (K65R, K160R, K490R) were selected according to a previous study (35Shen T.H. Lin H.K. Scaglioni P.P. Yung T.M. Pandolfi P.P. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 331-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). siRNA-insensitive PMLs were generated by mutagenesis based on the cloned HA-PML WT and PML-SM constructs. The SENP3 viral expression construct was made by subcloning the conventional pcDNA3-SENP3 into the pTER vectors (36Wang F. Zhang Q. Cao J. Huang Q. Zhu X. Exp. Cell Res. 2008; 314: 213-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). SENP3 shRNA viral construct was made by inserting an shRNA oligonucleotide into RNAi-Ready pSIREN-RetroQ (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Mountain View, CA). The PML viral constructs were made by subcloning into the pLXSN vectors (37Wang R. Zou Y. Yuan Z. Wang Y. Chen Y. Mao Y. Zhu Z.A. Li H. Tang X. Lu J. Yi J. Anat. Rec. 2009; 292: 777-786Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar) to form pLXSN-PML WT and pLXSN-PML SM. The non-viral constructs were transiently transfected or co-transfected into cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. The viral constructs were introduced to cells using previously described packaging cells and related methods (36Wang F. Zhang Q. Cao J. Huang Q. Zhu X. Exp. Cell Res. 2008; 314: 213-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 37Wang R. Zou Y. Yuan Z. Wang Y. Chen Y. Mao Y. Zhu Z.A. Li H. Tang X. Lu J. Yi J. Anat. Rec. 2009; 292: 777-786Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Reverse transcription was carried out using the routine method. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed on the ABI Prism 7300 system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using SYBR Green and following the manufacturer's instructions. The primers for mouse PML were 5′-TCGACAGTACGCGCAAGTCCAATA-3′ and 5′-TCATGCCACTGCTGAATCTCCTCA-3′. The primers for mouse β-actin were 5′-ACCAACTGGGACGACATGGAGAAA-3′ and 5′-TAGCACAGCCTGGATAGCAACGTA-3′. IB was performed using the routine methods. The antibodies against pan-PML (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA; sc-966 for human cells, sc-5621 for mouse cells), myc (CellSignaling Technology, Beverly, MA, #2276), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (ABcam, ab29), cyclinD1 (Medical and Biological Laboratories, K0062-3S), SUMO-2/3 (Santa Cruz; sc-26969), RH (Qiagen, 34610), HA (ABcam, ab9110-100), FLAG (Sigma; F1804), and β-actin (ABcam, ab6276–100) were used. The antibody against SENP6 (H00026054-M01) was purchased from Abnova (Taiwan, China). The antiserum against other SENPs were prepared using the method similar to that for SENP5 as previously described (8Gong L. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15869-15877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 22Huang C. Han Y. Wang Y. Sun X. Yan S. Yeh E.T. Chen Y. Cang H. Li H. Shi G. Cheng J. Tang X. Yi J. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 2748-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). IP and pulldown assays were performed with the previously described methods (22Huang C. Han Y. Wang Y. Sun X. Yan S. Yeh E.T. Chen Y. Cang H. Li H. Shi G. Cheng J. Tang X. Yi J. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 2748-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) using PML antibody to pull down endogenous PML and Ni-IDA beads or Talon beads to pull down RH-PML. N-Ethylmaleimide at 20 mm was included in the IP buffer to ensure that SUMOylation was conserved during manipulation. For the IP of endogenous PMLs in colon tissues, after the connective tissue and the necrotic tissue was carefully removed, 0.1 g of each colon carcinoma or the adjacent tissue was homogenized using the above IP buffer and sonicated on ice for 60s followed by the IP procedure. Cell monolayers were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, and blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin before incubation with various primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight. The antibodies against PML, SENP3, and HA were similar to those for IB. The antibody against fibrillarin was purchased from Abcam (ab5821-100). The second antibodies were fluorescent isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody (DAKO A/S, Denmark) and rhodamine-conjugated antibody (DAKO A/S). Nuclei were stained with DAPI. Cells were then examined under a LSM 510 fluorescent microscope (Zeiss, Germany). PML body number was quantitatively analyzed in 50 cells using Zeiss KS400 Version 2.2 software. siRNA oligonucleotides were synthesized (RIBOBIO). The sequences of the siRNA oligonucleotides for mouse SENP3 were 5′-CUGGAAAGGUUACAAAdTdT-3′ and 5′-UUUGUAACCUUUCCAGdTdT-3′. The sequences for homo-SENP3 were 5′-CAAUAAGGAGCUACUGCUAdTdT-3′ and 5′-UAGCAGUAGCUCCUUAUUGdTdT-3′. The sequences for mouse pan PMLs were 5′-CGAUAUUGGUGAGGAGAUUCAGCAGdCdA-3′ and 5′-CUGCUGAAUCUCCUCACCAAUAUCGdCdA-3′. Cells were transfected with siRNA oligonucleotides using Lipofectamine 2000. HUVEC and HeLa cells were stably transfected with pcDNA3 or SENP3 using electroporation followed by G418 selection. HeLa cells stably transfected with pcDNA3 or SENP3 were injected subcutaneously into the mice to generate tumor xenografts. Five mice were used for each group. After the tumor xenografts were visible in 3 weeks, the mice were sacrificed following an institution-approved protocol. Tumors were examined for weight and PML SUMOylation status. A mixture of 100 mg of tumor tissue evenly derived from each xenograft was homogenized as described previously (22Huang C. Han Y. Wang Y. Sun X. Yan S. Yeh E.T. Chen Y. Cang H. Li H. Shi G. Cheng J. Tang X. Yi J. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 2748-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The homogenates were further sonicated on ice for 40 s and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Fifty microliters of supernatant were taken, and IP with anti-PML antibody was performed followed by IB with antibodies against PML and SUMO2/3. Tissue chips containing 198 pieces of surgically dissected cancer and non-cancer specimens derived from 9 types of tissues were provided by Shanghai Biochip Center. Colon carcinoma and the adjacent normal colon tissues were collected from Ren Ji Hospital following an institute-approved protocol. Normal colon tissues were the tissues 3 cm adjacent to the edges of surgical dissections having normal appearance. The tissues were processed into paraformaldehyde-fixed and paraffin-embedded specimens. Sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies against SENP3 followed by biotinylated secondary antibodies. Immunohistochemical reactions were visualized with the peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin, in which 3,3′-diaminobenzidine was used as a chromogen. Sections were finally counterstained with hematoxylin and then examined under an Axioplan 2 fluorescent microscope. The ratio of the positive area for SENP3 was quantified by Zeiss KS400 software. Tissues were prepared and analyzed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Jiancheng Bioengineering, Nanjing, China). Briefly, the frozen tissues were sonicated on ice, and the homogenates were mixed with the kit-provided reagents and then centrifuged at 4000 × g for 10 min. Five hundred microliters of supernatant were mixed sequentially with the kit-provided reagents and incubated at room temperature for 5 min before being read at A420. A relative GSH level was determined by comparison of A420 absorbance with a standard curve and normalization by the total protein contents. SPSS11.5 software was used for statistical analysis. Analysis of variance was applied for single- or multifactor variance analysis. A Student-Newman-Keuls test was used for the comparison of mean. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. When non-tumor cells (HUVEC and NIH3T3) and a tumor cell line (HeLa) were exposed to the various low concentrations of H2O2, SENP3 protein levels rapidly increased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). These identical low doses of H2O2 promoted the proliferation of these cells in 1 day (Fig. 1B). The increase of cell proliferation was confirmed by an increased percentage of BrdUrd-incorporated cells as well as up-regulated proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and cyclinD1 proteins (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, when SENP3 was knocked down by siRNA, basal cell proliferation was markedly repressed, and H2O2-mediated cell proliferation could be completely blocked (Fig. 1D, upper). Cell cycle analysis revealed that H2O2 caused a shift from G1 phase to S phase, which relied on endogenous SENP3 (Fig. 1D, bottom). These results strongly indicate that low H2O2-stimulated cell proliferation is dependent on SENP3. Because PML is reported to be predominantly modified by SUMO3 in the nuclear or PML bodies (31Fu C.

Oncogene. 2005; 24: 5401-5413Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and is also indicated as the first potential substrate for SENP3 (8Gong L. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15869-15877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), we investigated whether the H2O2-induced increase of SENP3 could affect the PML bodies. Normally, SENP3 resided in the nucleoli, as it colocalized with fabrillarin, a nucleolus marker (Fig. 2A, upper), whereas PML existed in PML bodies, which were perinucleolar (Fig. 2A, bottom). We found that the number of PML bodies was markedly decreased when HUVEC were exposed to low doses of H2O2 (Fig. 2B). Likewise, the number of PML bodies was decreased in HUVEC stably overexpressing SENP3 (Fig. 2C). In contrast, when endogenous SENP3 was knocked down, the number of PML bodies was dramatically increased and could no longer be decreased by H2O2 treatment (Fig. 2D). We then examined whether PML was a substrate for SENP3 under a mild oxidative stress. Pulldown assays showed that PML could physically interact with endogenous SENP3 upon H2O2 treatment but not with SENP1, SENP2, SENP5, or SENP6, which also had de-SUMOylation activity toward SUMO2/3 conjugates. And endogenous SUMO2/3 modification of PML was decreased upon H2O2 treatment, whereas global SUMO2/3 conjugations were increased (Fig. 3A). Immunofluorescence was then conducted in cells exposed to H2O2 treatment to visualize the spatial correlation of endogenous SENP3 with endogenous PML. The results showed that SENP3, which originally resided in the nucleoli, accumulated in the nucleoplasm and in part colocalized with PML bodies upon H2O2 treatment, indicating that SENP3 interacted with PML in response to mild oxidative stress (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, the co-IP result based on overexpression of PML and SENP3 showed that SENP3 was able to remove endogenous SUMO2/3 from PML, whereas the SENP3 mutant was not (Fig. 3C). The removal of SUMO2/3 from endogenous PML was executed by H2O2, but the de-conjugation was markedly blocked in cells with SENP3 knockdown (Fig. 3D). Notably, upon H2O2 treatment, global SUMO2/3 conjugation was increased, whereas SUMO2/3 modification of PML was decreased in cells with intact SENP3. These data indicate that SENP3 can specifically de-conjugate SUMO2/3 from PML under mild oxidative stress. The rate of cell proliferation under the basal condition was higher in cells overexpressing SENP3 but not in cells overexpressing SENP3 mutant that lost de-SUMOylating activity compared with that in control (Fig. 4A). PML was then silenced by siRNA (Fig. 4B, right). PML silencing could also promote cell proliferation (Fig. 4B, left, compare PML siRNA with nonspecific (NS) siRNA at day 4, p < 0.01), confirming that PML normally serves an inhibitory role in cell proliferation. In addition, cell proliferation was enhanced by H2O2 treatment in control cells with nonspecific siRNA (Fig. 4B, left, compare NS siRNA with NS siRNA+H2O2 at day 4, p < 0.01) but was no longer enhanced by H2O2 in cells with PML siRNA (Fig. 4B, left, compare PML siRNA with PML siRNA+H2O2 at day 4, p > 0.05), implying that PML might be involved in the effects of H2O2. To determine whether the SUMOylation status of PML correlated with its inhibitory role in cell proliferation and whether this might be affected by SENP3, we established a system to compare the phenotypes caused by PML with and without SUMOylation in both SENP3-overexpressing and -depleting contexts. Endogenous PML was knocked down using a siRNA irrelevant to exogenous PML, and then either a PML mutant lacking three sites for SUMOylation or its wild-type counterpart were reintroduced into the cells. The efficiency of PML knockdown was first verified, and the mutation of the SUMOylation sites in PML was confirmed (data not shown). In addition, SENP3 was overexpressed or depleted in some of the samples. Each sample was determined for SENP3 expression, PML expression, and its SUMO2/3 modification state (Fig. 4C, upper). The results of cell proliferation assay showed that in control cells with intact SENP3 (Fig. 4C, bottom, left group), the reintroduction of wild-type PML could reverse the enhancement of cell proliferation caused by PML silencing (compare WT with vector) but PML mutant could not (compare SM with vector). In SENP3-depleted cells, proliferation was largely suppressed regardless of the presence or absence of PML (Fig. 4C, bottom, middle group). In SENP3-overexpressing cells, the reintroduction of wild-type PML could no longer reverse the enhancement of cell proliferation caused by PML silencing (Fig. 4C, bottom, right group). This indicates that only SUMOylated PMLs play an inhibitory role in cell proliferation. After comparing the function of the wild-type PML in SENP3 intact cells with SENP3-overexpressing cells, it is clear that SENP3 abrogates the inhibitory effect of PML on proliferation, further suggesting that the role of SUMOylated PML is overridden by SENP3. Moreover, PML silencing has no additive proliferative effect upon SENP3 overexpression, supporting that SENP3-enhanced proliferative effect is dependent on PML. We also assessed the correlation of de-SUMOylation of PML with the decrease of the PML bodies under mild oxidative stress by overexpression of wild-type or SUMOylation mutant PML. The results of immunofluorescence de"

Previously, we showed that BRCA1 induces antioxidant-response gene expression and protects cells against oxidative stress. We now report that BRCA1 stimulates the base excision repair pathway, a major mechanism for the repair of oxidized DNA, by stimulating the activity of key base excision repair (BER) enzymes, including 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1), the DNA glycosylase NTH1, and the apurinic endonuclease redox factor 1/apurinic endonuclease 1 (REF1/APE1), in human breast carcinoma cells. The increase in BER enzyme activity appears to be due, primarily, to an increase in enzyme expression. The ability of BRCA1 to stimulate the expression of the three BER enzymes and to enhance NTH1 promoter activity was dependent upon the octamer-binding transcription factor OCT1. Finally, we found that OGG1, NTH1, and REF1/APE1 each contribute to the BRCA1 protection against oxidative stress due to hydrogen peroxide and that hydrogen peroxide stimulates the expression of BRCA1 and the three BER enzymes.

Hazra T.K. Mitra S. Cell Res. 2008; 18: 27-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). The primary source of these lesions is reactive oxygen species, whether generated endogenously or due to genotoxic agents. The BER pathway functions to maintain genomic integrity via a high fidelity repair process and is thus anti-mutagenic and anti-carcinogenic (2D'Errico M. Parlanti E. Dogliotti E. Mutat. Res. 2008; 659: 4-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This pathway usually has four or five enzymatic steps, involving a DNA glycosylase (e.g. OGG1 or NTH1), an AP endonuclease (REF1/APE1), a DNA polymerase (e.g. polymerase B and D), and a DNA ligase (ligase I or III) (3Mitra S.

DNA glycosylases recognize specific subsets of damaged bases, excise the damaged base, and may also incise at the site of the excised base due to an intrinsic lyase activity (e.g. OGG1 and NTH1). REF1/APE1 (the only mammalian AP endonuclease) then cleaves the abasic site to form a 3′-OH end and a 5′-deoxyribose phosphate end. The remaining steps may utilize a “long patch” or “short patch” pathway involving repair DNA synthesis and strand ligation by different sets of proteins. The preferred substrates for the DNA glycosylases OGG1 (8-oxoguanine glycosylase 1) and NTH1 (homolog of Escherichia coli endonuclease III) are 8-oxoguanine and thymine glycol (TG) lesions, respectively. REF1/APE1 (redox factor 1/apurinic endonuclease 1) is a multifunctional enzyme with AP endonuclease activity and 3′,5′-exonuclease, 3′-diesterase, and 3′-phosphatase activities. REF1/APE1 also has transcriptional regulatory activity independently of its function in BER (4Izumi T. Wiederhold L.R. Roy G. Roy R. Jaiswal A. Bhakat K.K. Mitra S. Hazra T.K.

Finally, the XRCC1 protein (x-ray repair, cross-complementing defective, in Chinese hamster, 1) associates with several other proteins, polynucleotide kinase, DNA polymerase-β (polymerase B), and DNA ligase III, to form a complex that repairs the single strand DNA breaks generated during the BER process. The breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 encodes a tumor suppressor protein, mutations of which account for about 2.5–5% of all breast cancers and 40–50% of hereditary breast cancers (6Miki Y.

Even in sporadic (nonhereditary) breast cancers, BRCA1 expression is absent or significantly decreased in about 30–40% of cases (7Staff S. Isola J. Tanner M.

BRCA1 is a multifunctional protein that has been implicated in regulation of the cell cycle, apoptosis, and chemosensitivity, various transcriptional pathways (including hormone-response pathways), and DNA damage signaling and repair (reviewed in Refs. 10Rosen E.M. Fan S. Ma Y. Cancer Lett. 2006; 236: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 11Weberpals J.I. Clark-Knowles K.V. Vanderhyden B.C. J. Clin. Oncol. 2008; 26: 3259-3267Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Studies of its role in cellular responses to DNA damage have identified a function for BRCA1 as a caretaker in the maintenance of genomic integrity. Through interactions with other DNA repair pathway proteins, BRCA1 participates in pathways that: 1) signal DNA damage (i.e. as a target for phosphorylation by upstream kinases, such as ataxia telangiectasia-mutated, ataxia telangiectasia and RAD3-related, and cell cycle checkpoint kinase 1 and 2) (12Ting N.S. Lee W.H. DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar); 2) mediate the preferential repair of DNA double strand breaks by homology-directed repair (along with Rad51 and BRCA2) (13Moynahan M.E.

Biol. 2001; 21: 3445-3450Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). BRCA1 is also a component of the BRCA-Fanconi anemia pathway, which is essential for the cellular response to DNA cross-linking agents (17Litman R. Gupta R. Brosh Jr., R.M. Cantor S.B. Anticancer Agents Med. Chem. 2008; 8: 426-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). BRCA1, along with another RING domain protein (BARD1), exerts an E3 ubiquitin ligase function that constitutes the only known enzymatic function for BRCA1 (18Ruffner H. Joazeiro C.A. Hemmati D. Hunter T. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 5134-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 19Starita L.M. Parvin J.D. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2006; 5: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, it is still unclear which of these functions of BRCA1 is most important for its role in genome maintenance and suppression of breast cancer development. Here, we show that in human breast carcinoma cell lines, BRCA1 stimulates several early steps in the BER pathway through a transcriptional mechanism that involves the octamer-binding transcription factor 1 (OCT1). These findings suggest a role for BRCA1 in protecting cells against oxidative damage to DNA. MCF-7 and T47D human mammary adenocarcinoma cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, nonessential amino acids (100 mm), l-glutamine (5 mm), streptomycin (100 mg/ml), and penicillin (100 units/ml) (all from BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD).

To assay NTH1 promoter activity, subconfluent proliferating cells in 24-well dishes were transiently transfected overnight with 0.5 μg of the indicated reporter (0.5 μg) and expression vector (WTBRCA1 or empty pcDNA3 vector) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as the transfection reagent. The total transfected DNA was kept constant by addition of control vector. The transfected cells were then washed and post-incubated for 24 h in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum to allow gene expression. The cells were then harvested and assayed for luciferase activity using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (catalog no. E1910, Promega, Madison, WI), according to the manufacturer instructions. Luciferase values were usually expressed relative to that observed in control (pcDNA3)-transfected cells, as means ± S.E. of three independent experiments. As a negative control, assays were performed using a control reporter missing the NTH1 promoter segment (pGL3-Luc). For ectopic expression, proliferating cells at about 70–80% of confluency were transfected overnight with the indicated expression vector (6 μg of plasmid DNA per well for a 6-well plate or 30 μg per 10-cm dish) using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol, as described before (20Fan S.

The transfected cells were washed and then incubated for several hours in fresh culture medium to allow them to recover. Asynchronously proliferating cells at about 30–40% of confluency were pretreated with the siRNA of interest (100 nm for 48–72 h) using siPORT amine transfection reagent (Ambion, Foster City, CA). The efficacy of each knockdown was confirmed by Western blotting. The following siRNAs were used in this study: control-siRNA (ON-TARGET plus Nontargeting siRNA (catalog no. D-001810-01, Dharmacon, Chicago)); BRCA1-siRNA (pool of two siRNAs custom-synthesized from Dharmacon (sequences 5′ → 3′ CAGCTACCCTTCCATCATA and CTAGAAATCTGTTGCTATG)); REF1-siRNA (pool of two siRNAs custom synthesized from Dharmacon (5′ → 3′ CAAAGTTTCTTACGGCATA and ACAGCAAGATCCGTTCCAA)); OGG1-siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog no.

The OCT1-siRNA is a pool of three target-specific 20–25 nucleotide siRNAs. Subconfluent proliferating cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of H2O2 or paraquat in culture medium containing 5% fetal calf serum for 24 h at 37 °C. MTT assays were performed as described before (28Alley M.C. Scudiero D.A. Monks A. Hursey M.L. Czerwinski M.J. Fine D.L. Abbott B.J. Mayo J.G. Shoemaker R.H. Boyd M.R. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 589-601PubMed Google Scholar). This assay is based on the ability of intact mitochondria to convert MTT, a soluble tetrazolium salt, into an insoluble formazan precipitate, which is quantified by spectrophotometry after solubilization in DMSO. After the indicated cell treatment, cells in 96-well dishes were solubilized and assayed for MTT dye reduction, based on the difference between absorbance at 570 and 630 nm. Cell viability was expressed as the amount of dye reduction relative to untreated control cells. Cell viability values were calculated as means ± S.E. for at least three independent experiments, each of which used eight replicate wells per cell type and assay condition. After the indicated treatment, whole cell lysates were prepared. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 200 μl of RIPA buffer (Sigma) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Complete Mini, EDTA-free; 11836170-001, Roche Applied Science) on ice for 30 min. The lysed cells were rocked at 4 °C for 30 min, followed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min. The protein content of the supernatant was measured via the Bradford method (Bio-Rad), and the supernatants were stored at −80 °C prior to usage. Aliquots of protein in 4× lithium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer (Invitrogen) were analyzed on 4–20% Tris-glycine gels. Precast gels were obtained from Invitrogen. The separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and blocked for 1 h in blocking buffer (Sigma). The membranes were blotted with primary antibodies, followed by incubation with species-specific horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a 1:10,000 dilution. Blotted proteins were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Equal protein loading (40 μg of whole cell protein) was confirmed by blotting with α-actin antibody. Kaleidoscope prestained protein markers (Bio-Rad) were used as molecular size standards. The primary antibodies were as follows: BRCA1 (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:200 dilution); REF1/APE1 (E-17, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:200); α-actin (C-11, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:400); OGG1 (ab22766, Abcam (Cambridge, MA), 1:100); NTH1 (AF2675, R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), 1:100); XRCC1 (ab47920, Abcam, 1:250); ligase III (ab587, Abcam, 1:200); catalase (F-17, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:150); SOD1 (C-17, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:200); SOD2 (FL-222, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:250); and OCT1 (C-21, SC-232, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:100). Semi-quantitative RT-PCR assays were performed as described earlier (27Xiong J. Fan S. Meng Q. Schramm L. Wang C. Bouzahza B. Zhou J. Zafonte B. Goldberg I.D. Haddad B.R. Pestell R.G. Rosen E.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8668-8690Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Briefly, total cell RNA was extracted using the RNase Easy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Aliquots of total cell RNA (200 μg) were reverse-transcribed using 50 units of Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in a reaction volume of 20 μl. One-μl aliquots of transcribed cDNA were subjected to PCR amplification, using hot-start Taq polymerase (Denville, South Plainfield, NJ). DNA was first denatured for 5 min at 95 °C and then amplified using cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at the annealing temperature, and 1 min at 72 °C, with a final 10-min incubation at 72 °C. The cycle number was adjusted so that all reactions fell within the linear range of product amplification. The forward and reverse primers, annealing temperatures, and expected sizes of the PCR products are shown in supplemental Table 1. The size of each PCR product was confirmed by electrophoresis through 2% agarose gels containing 0.1 mg/ml ethidium bromide; and the gels were photographed under ultraviolet light. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (29Schreiber E. Matthias P. Müller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). Cells (about 1 × 107 per assay condition) were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 400 μl of hypotonic lysis buffer A (10 mm HEPES, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.9). The cells were allowed to swell on ice for 15 min, after which 25 μl of a 10% solution of Nonidet P-40 (Pierce) was added, and the tube was vortexed vigorously for 10 s. The nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 500 × g at 4 °C for 45 s. The supernatant was considered to be the cytoplasmic fraction. The nuclei were washed three times with buffer A to minimize cytoplasmic contamination. Nuclear proteins were extracted with 200 μl of buffer B (20 mm HEPES, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.9) by vigorous rocking at 4 °C for 30 min, followed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. This supernatant was considered to be the nuclear extract, which was analyzed for protein content by Bradford assay and stored at −80 °C until it was used for the DNA incision or ligation assays. The determination of different cleavage activity was performed using a modified oligonucleotide cleavage assay as described previously (30Adhikari S. Toretsky J.A. Yuan L. Roy R. J. Biol.

Oligonucleotides containing normal bases in place of the damaged bases were used as controls for specific activities. Complementary oligonucleotides were also synthesized to yield a duplex either with the wild-type or damaged (modified) base containing oligonucleotide. Annealing of the oligonucleotides was performed in freshly prepared annealing buffer (10 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA). The sequences of each oligonucleotide used in different assays are provided in supplemental Table 2. Incision assay procedures are described below. Nuclear extracts were incubated with modified 5′-FITC-labeled duplex oligonucleotides, and in the presence of specific enzyme activity, the modified oligonucleotide was cleaved into smaller oligomers. As a negative control, wild-type (unmodified) 5′-FITC-labeled duplex oligonucleotides were tested at the same time. Reaction mixtures (20 μl) (which contained a fixed quantity of nuclear extract (indicated in the figures), 2.5 pmol of 5′-FITC-labeled duplex oligonucleotide, 20 mm HEPES, 5% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 25 μg/ml poly(dI)/poly(dC), pH 7.4) were incubated for 45–60 min at 37 °C. All reactions were stopped by incubation with 0.2% SDS and 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K at 68 °C for 10 min. The DNA was extracted using phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol; and the reaction mixture was then admixed with 15 μl of formamide DNA loading dye (85% formamide and 0.03 n NaOH) and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. The products were separated by electrophoresis through 20% polyacrylamide gels containing 7 m urea at 300 V for 70–80 min. The gels were washed in water and exposed in Ettan DIGE fluorescence imager cassettes (GE Healthcare). The gel images were analyzed using NIH-ImageJ software version 1.38X (rsbweb.nih.gov, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda). The product bands were quantified relative to the sum of the substrate and product bands and expressed as a percentage. At least three independent experiments were performed per assay type per cell line. A 40-mer oligonucleotide (LigIII-2, see supplemental Table 2) was radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) at the 5′ end using T4 polynucleotide kinase and subsequently purified using a G-25 mini spin column (Amersham Biosciences). The γ-32P-labeled 40-mer and an unlabeled 30-mer (LigIII-1, supplemental Table 2) were annealed to an unlabeled 70-mer complementary oligonucleotide (see supplemental Table 2). Fifty μg of nuclear extract per assay was incubated with the annealed duplex oligonucleotide and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min in 20 μl of ligation buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 4 volumes of formamide sample loading buffer as above, and the reaction mixture was heated to 85 °C for 10 min and then cooled rapidly on ice. The oligonucleotides were resolved on 12% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea. The gels were washed briefly in water, dried on a gel dryer, and subjected to autoradiography. The appearance of a 70-mer labeled product band is indicative of the ligase activity. Statistical comparisons were made using the two-tailed Student's t test where appropriate. Data are presented as arithmetic means with error bars representing the standard error of mean calculated from at least three independent experiments. The TG lesion is a common oxidative DNA lesion that is typically repaired starting with an incision by the DNA glycosylase NTH1 (also called NTHL1 or endonuclease III-like 1). We tested the effects of manipulation of BRCA1 levels in MCF-7 and T47D cells on this incision reaction using FITC-conjugated DNA oligonucleotides containing a TG paired with an adenine (see “Experimental Procedures”). Cells were transfected overnight with vehicle only, WTBRCA1, or empty pcDNA3 vector; and nuclear extracts were assayed, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As illustrated in Fig. 1A, there was very little incision of the wild-type oligonucleotide, whereas WTBRCA1 visibly stimulated incision of TG oligonucleotide in MCF-7 cells. When the percentage of incised DNA was calculated based on densitometry analysis for three independent experiments, it was found that WTBRCA1 increased the amount of incision by about 2.5-fold (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1B). In addition, BRCA1 overexpression also increased the levels of NTH1 protein, as determined by Western blotting (Fig. 1C). Very similar results were observed using T47D cells (see supplemental Fig. S1, A–C). Conversely, knockdown of BRCA1 in MCF-7 cells using BRCA1-siRNA caused a significant reduction of incision around TG lesions, as compared with cells treated with control-siRNA or vehicle only (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1, D and E); BECA1 knockdown also caused a reduction of the NTH1 protein levels (Fig. 1F). Again, very similar results were observed using T47D cells (supplemental Fig. S1, D–F). Taken together, these findings suggest that BRCA1 regulates NTH1 incising activity, at least in part, through regulation of NTH1 expression. 8-Oxoguanine (8-OxoG) is a signature mutagenic DNA lesion caused by oxidative stress that is repaired through BER. We tested whether BRCA1 could modulate the first step in the repair of this lesion, which involves incising of DNA around an 8-OxoG site. This step is mediated by the DNA glycosylase OGG1. This assay tests the ability of nuclear extracts to cause incision of an FITC-conjugated duplex DNA containing an 8-OxoG paired with a cytosine. Cells were transfected overnight with vehicle only, wild-type BRCA1, or empty pcDNA3 vector; and nuclear extracts were assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Here, WTBRCA1 significantly stimulated the cleavage of 8-OxoG containing oligonucleotides (but not a wild-type oligonucleotide) in MCF-7 cells (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2, A and B). WTBRCA1 also caused an increase in the OGG1 protein levels (Fig. 2C). Conversely, BRCA1 knockdown caused a significant reduction of OGG1 incising activity (p < 0.05) and a corresponding reduction of OGG1 protein levels (Fig. 2, D–F); very similar findings were observed using T47D cells (see supplemental Fig. S2). These findings are consistent with the idea that BRCA1 regulates OGG1 incising activity in part through the regulation of OGG1 protein levels. As a control, we also tested the ability of a full-length mutant breast cancer-associated BRCA1 protein (T300G, which encodes a point mutation of BRCA1 in the RING domain (C61G)) to alter OGG1 activity. As illustrated in supplemental Fig. S3, expression of T300G had little or no effect on OGG1-related incising activity in MCF-7 cells (supplemental Fig. S3, A and B), although the T300G protein was well expressed but did not stimulate OGG1 expression (supplemental Fig. S3C). These findings suggest that a functional BRCA1 protein is required to stimulate OGG1 activity and expression.

https://openalex.org/W2017763753,"Beta-catenin is a key component of the Wnt signaling pathway that functions as a transcriptional co-activator of Wnt target genes. Upon UV-induced DNA damage, beta-catenin is recruited for polyubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation by a unique, p53-induced SCF-like complex (SCF(TBL1)), comprised of Siah-1, Siah-1-interacting protein (SIP), Skp1, transducin beta-like 1 (TBL1), and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC). Given the complexity of the various factors involved and the novelty of ubiquitination of the non-phosphorylated beta-catenin substrate, we have investigated Siah-1-mediated ubiquitination of beta-catenin in vitro and in cells. Overexpression and purification protocols were developed for each of the SCF(TBL1) proteins, enabling a systematic analysis of beta-catenin ubiquitination using an in vitro ubiquitination assay. This study revealed that Siah-1 alone was able to polyubiquitinate beta-catenin. In addition, TBL1 was shown to play a role in protecting beta-catenin from Siah-1 ubiquitination in vitro and from Siah-1-targeted proteasomal degradation in cells. Siah-1 and TBL1 were found to bind to the same armadillo repeat domain of beta-catenin, suggesting that polyubiquitination of beta-catenin is regulated by competition between Siah-1 and TBL1 during Wnt signaling."

https://openalex.org/W1965479103,"Regulated transport and local translation of mRNA in neurons are critical for modulating synaptic strength, maintaining proper neural circuitry, and establishing long term memory. Neuronal RNA granules are ribonucleoprotein particles that serve to transport mRNA along microtubules and control local protein synthesis in response to synaptic activity. Studies suggest that neuronal RNA granules share similar structures and functions with somatic P-bodies. We recently reported that the Huntington disease protein huntingtin (Htt) associates with Argonaute (Ago) and localizes to cytoplasmic P-bodies, which serve as sites of mRNA storage, degradation, and small RNA-mediated gene silencing. Here we report that wild-type Htt associates with Ago2 and components of neuronal granules and co-traffics with mRNA in dendrites. Htt was found to co-localize with RNA containing the 3'-untranslated region sequence of known dendritically targeted mRNAs. Knockdown of Htt in neurons caused altered localization of mRNA. When tethered to a reporter construct, Htt down-regulated reporter gene expression in a manner dependent on Ago2, suggesting that Htt may function to repress translation of mRNAs during transport in neuronal granules."

The absence of 26Al indicates that Coki formed >1.7 million years after the oldest solids in the solar system, calcium- and aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs).

https://openalex.org/W1989029893,"Components of lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTBR)-associated signaling complexes, including TRAF2, TRAF3, NIK, IKK1, and IKK2 have been shown to participate in the coupling of LTBR to NFkappaB. Here, we report that TRAF3 functions as a negative regulator of LTBR signaling via both canonical and non-canonical NFkappaB pathways by two distinct mechanisms. Analysis of NFkappaB signaling in cell lines with functionally intact NFkappaB pathway but lacking LTBR-mediated induction of NFkappaB target genes revealed an inverse association of cellular TRAF3 levels with LTBR-specific defect in canonical NFkappaB activation. Increased expression of TRAF3 correlated with its increased recruitment to LTBR-induced signaling complexes, decreased recruitment of TRAF2, and attenuated phosphorylation of IkappaB alpha and RelA. In contrast, activation of NFkappaB by TNF did not depend on TRAF3 levels. siRNA-mediated depletion of TRAF3 promoted recruitment of TRAF2 and IKK1 to activated LTBR, enabling LTBR-inducible canonical NFkappaB signaling and NFkappaB target gene expression. TRAF3 knock-down also increased mRNA and protein expression of several non-canonical NFkappaB components, including NFkappaB2/p100, RelB, and NIK, accompanied by processing of NFkappaB2/p100 into p52. These effects of TRAF3 depletion did not require LTBR signaling and were consistent with autonomous activation of the non-canonical NFkappaB pathway. Our data illustrate the function of TRAF3 as a dual-mode repressor of LTBR signaling that controls activation of canonical NFkappaB, and de-repression of the intrinsic activity of non-canonical NFkappaB. Modulation of cellular TRAF3 levels may thus contribute to regulation of NFkappaB-dependent gene expression by LTBR by affecting the balance of LTBR-dependent activation of canonical and non-canonical NFkappaB pathways."

However, the mechanisms by which the tightly regulated NF-kappaB becomes constitutively activated during breast cancer pathogenesis remain obscure. Here, we report that PDZ-LIM domain-containing protein 2 (PDLIM2), an essential terminator of NF-kappaB activation, is repressed in both estrogen receptor-positive and estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer cells, suggesting one important mechanism for the constitutive activation of NF-kappaB. Indeed, PDLIM2 reexpression inhibited constitutive NF-kappaB activation and expression of NF-kappaB-targeted genes in those breast cancer cells. Importantly, PDLIM2, but not its mutants defective in NF-kappaB termination, could suppress in vitro anchorage-independent growth and in vivo tumor formation of those malignant breast cells. In addition, we have shown that PDLIM2 repression involves promoter methylation. Accordingly, treatment of the breast cancer cells with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine reverses the methylation of the PDLIM2 promoter, restored PDLIM2 expression, and suppressed tumorigenicities of human breast cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. These studies thus provide important mechanistic insights into breast cancer pathogenesis. These studies also suggest a tumor suppression function of PDLIM2 and a therapeutic strategy for breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2028694476,"To determine the underlying mechanism of Foxp1/2/4-mediated transcriptional repression, a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed that identified p66beta, a transcriptional repressor and component of the NuRD chromatin-remodeling complex. We show that direct interactions between Foxp1/4 and p66beta are mediated by the CR2 domain within p66beta and the zinc finger/leucine zipper repression domain found in Foxp1/2/4. These direct interactions are functionally relevant as overexpression of p66beta in combination with Foxp factors cooperatively represses Foxp target gene expression, whereas loss of p66 and Foxp factors results in de-repression of endogenous Foxp target genes in lung epithelial cells. Moreover, the NuRD components HDAC1/2 associate in a macromolecular complex with Foxp proteins, and loss of expression or inhibition of HDAC1/2 activity leads to de-repression of Foxp target gene expression. Importantly, we show in vivo that Foxp1 and HDAC2 act cooperatively to regulate expression of the cytoprotective cytokine interleukin-6, which results in increased resistance to hyperoxic lung injury in Foxp1/HDAC2 compound mutant animals. These data reveal an important interaction between the Foxp transcription factors and the NuRD chromatin-remodeling complex that modulates transcriptional repression critical for the lung epithelial injury response."

ASIC1a is expressed in neurons in mammalian brain and is implicated in long term potentiation of synaptic transmission that contributes to learning and memory. In ischemic brain injury, however, activation of this Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable channel plays a critical role in acidosis-mediated, glutamate-independent, Ca<sup>2+</sup> toxicity. We report here the identification of insulin as a regulator of ASIC1a surface expression. In modeled ischemia using Chinese hamster ovary cells, serum depletion caused a significant increase in ASIC1a surface expression that resulted in the potentiation of ASIC1a activity. Among the components of serum, insulin was identified as the key factor that maintains a low level of ASIC1a on the plasma membrane. Neurons subjected to insulin depletion increased surface expression of ASIC1a with resultant potentiation of ASIC1a currents. Intracellularly, ASIC1a is predominantly localized to the endoplasmic reticulum in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and this intracellular localization is also observed in neurons. Under conditions of serum or insulin depletion, the intracellular ASIC1a is translocated to the cell surface, increasing the surface expression level. These results reveal an important trafficking mechanism of ASIC1a that is relevant to both the normal physiology and the pathological activity of this channel."

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3788-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (1508) Google Scholar, 3Morimoto R.I.

The HSR is regulated by a family of heat shock transcription factors (HSFs) that are expressed and maintained in an inactive state under non-stress conditions. Among three functionally different HSFs in humans, HSF type 1 (HSF1) mediates signaling of stress-induced stimuli, such as elevated temperatures (4Anckar J. Sistonen L. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2007; 594: 78-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). HSF1 is generally found in the cytoplasm as an inert monomer lacking transcriptional activity; both DNA binding and transcriptional transactivation domains are repressed through intramolecular interactions and constitutive serine phosphorylation (5Holmberg C.I. Tran S.E. Eriksson J.E. Sistonen L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 619-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Upon exposure to heat shock and other types of stresses, which cause protein damage, HSF1 is derepressed in a stepwise process that involves oligomerization of HSF1 monomers to a trimeric state, localization to the nucleus, inducible phosphorylation and sumoylation, binding of nuclear-localized trimers to DNA, and transcription of HS genes (reviewed in Ref. 4Anckar J. Sistonen L. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2007; 594: 78-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The main targets for HSF1 are specific promoter elements composed by repeats of the pentameric sequence nGAAn (heat shock elements, HSE) located upstream of HS genes. High rates of transcription are maintained only when HSF1 trimers remain bound to the HSE; when either the stress signal is removed or damaged proteins are no longer generated, the HSR attenuates rapidly, with subsequent conversion of HSF1 back to the monomeric state (6Abravaya K. Phillips B. Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2117-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Inducible acetylation has also been recently shown to negatively regulate DNA binding activity (7Westerheide S.D. Anckar J. Stevens Jr., S.M. Sistonen L. Morimoto R.I. Science. 2009; 323: 1063-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Heat shock gene promoters that contain HSE elements include molecular chaperones of the HSP70 and HSP90 families, HSP27 and other proteins of the network. In addition to the well known heat shock proteins, HSF binding sites have been also described in genes encoding proteins with non-chaperone function (8Trinklein N.D. Murray J.I. Hartman S.J. Botstein D. Myers R.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1254-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Herein we report that the zinc finger AN1-type domain 2a gene, also known as AIRAP (arsenite-inducible RNA-associated protein), is a novel human HSF1 target gene. AIRAP has been previously described as a highly conserved gene whose expression can be activated by arsenite and electrophiles but not by other conditions, including heat shock, that perturb protein folding in Caenorhabditis elegans or in mouse cells (9Sok J. Calfon M. Lu J. Lichtlen P. Clark S.G. Ron D. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2001; 6: 6-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We now demonstrate that the human AIRAP gene behaves as a canonical heat shock gene, whose expression is temperature-dependent and is strictly controlled by HSF1 through its binding to a specific HSE sequence located in the promoter at position −211 to −202 from the transcription start site. The production of HeLa cells stably transfected with pSUPER/pcDNA3 (HeLa-pS) and pSUPER-HSF1i/pcDNA3 (HeLa-HSF1i) plasmids was previously described (10Rossi A. Ciafrè S. Balsamo M. Pierimarchi P. Santoro M.G. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 7678-7685Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). HeLa-pS and HeLa-HSF1i cells were grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and antibiotics, in the presence of G-418 (400 μg/ml). HaCaT, HCT116, and Jurkat cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (HaCaT), McCoy's 5A (HCT116) or RPMI 1640 (Jurkat) medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and antibiotics. Human peripheral blood monocytes, isolated and purified from buffy coat of healthy blood donors (kindly provided by Prof. Adorno, Hematology Division, University of Rome Tor Vergata) as described elsewhere (11Elia G. Polla B. Rossi A. Santoro M.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 736-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), were grown for 24 h in RPMI 1640 medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics as indicated above. Murine embryonic fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and antibiotics. For heating procedures, cells were subjected to heat shock at the indicated temperatures in a precision water bath-W14 (Grant Instruments, Cambridge, UK). To generate the AIRAP-PGL3 vector, a pair of gene-specific primers (sense: 5′-CGGGGTACCAGGGTTTCGTCATGTTCACC-3′; antisense: 5′-GCTAGCTAGCCTCAGGTGTCCTCCTCCGTA-3′) was designed to amplify the AIRAP gene promoter region (spanning from −1316 upstream of the gene transcription start site to +160) from human genomic DNA (Promega) by using Pfu Taq polymerase (Promega). The reaction product was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, digested with KpnI and NheI, and inserted upstream of the luciferase gene of the pGL3Basic vector (Promega). The Δ-HSE-AIRAP-PGL3 vector containing the AIRAP promoter region (spanning from −1316 to −232) was generated as described above, by using the following primers: sense: 5′-CGGGGTACCAGGGTTTCGTCATGTTCACC-3′, antisense: 5′-GCTAGCTAGCCGCTTGCTGGGTCACAGT-3′. The AIRAP-PGL3-M26-HSE1 (M26) and AIRAP-PGL3-M210-HSE2 (M210) mutant constructs were generated by using the QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). Oligos used were: for M26 construct, sense: 5′-CCCCAAGGCCCATACGGCTCTCAGATCCG-3′, antisense: 5′-CGGATCTGAGAGCCGTATGGGCCTTGGGG-3′; for M210 construct, sense: 5′-CGAGAAGCGACCGTACACTTCGAGAAGGG-3′, antisense: 5′-CCCTTCTCGAAGTGTACGGTCGCTTCTCG-3′. To generate the cFlag-tagged AIRAP-pcDNA3 vector, the human AIRAP gene was amplified from the ZFAND2A cDNA (human) clone ID 5263788 (Open Biosystems) by using the following primers: 5′-GGCGGATCCACCATGGAGTTTCCTGATTTGGGGAAG-3′ and 5′-TGCGGTCGACCTACTTATCGTCGTCATCCTTGTAATCCCCAGCTTTGATGGTGGGGCG-3′. The PCR product was digested with BamH1 and Sal1, and inserted into a BamH1/Sal1-cut pcDNA3 vector. The nucleotide sequence of each construct was verified by DNA sequencing. Flag-HSF1-pcDNA3 expression vector was a kind gift from Dr. S. Calderwood, Harvard Medical School. All transfections were performed using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocols. For reporter gene experiments, the different AIRAP constructs were co-transfected with a control plasmid (pRL-TK encoding Renilla luciferase, Promega) to normalize transfection efficiency. Transfected cells were grown for 16 h before heat treatment and luciferase activity of quadruplicate samples was measured in a Microplate Luminometer (Wallac-Perkin Elmer) using Dual-Luciferase kit (Promega). AIRAP promoter firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity in the same sample. Whole cell extracts (15 μg of protein) prepared after lysis in high-salt extraction buffer (12Rossi A. Elia G. Santoro M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 746-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) were incubated with a 32P-labeled HSE DNA probe followed by analysis of DNA binding activity by EMSA. Binding reactions were performed as described (13Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar). Complexes were analyzed by nondenaturing 4% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Quantitative evaluation of HSF-HSE complex formation was determined by Typhoon 8600 imager (Molecular Dynamics, Amersham Biosciences) with the use of ImageQuant (Amersham Biosciences). Equal amounts of protein (35 μg/sample) from whole cell extracts were separated by SDS/PAGE, and blotted to nitrocellulose. After blocking with 5% skim milk solution, membranes were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-HSF1, anti-ubiquitin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-AIRAP (kindly provided by Dr. A. Stanhill, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology) antibodies, or monoclonal anti-HSP70 (Stressgene), anti-Flag M2, and anti-β-actin (Sigma) antibodies followed by decoration with peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG, respectively (Super Signal detection kit, Pierce). Quantitative evaluation of proteins was determined by Versadoc 1000 (Bio-Rad) analysis. Total RNA was prepared using Trizol (Invitrogen) as described in the manufacturer's protocol. For RT-PCR analysis, extracted RNA (1 μg) was digested with 2 units of DNase I (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 37 °C. Samples were reverse transcribed to cDNA with 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (RT) (Invitrogen), using 5 μg of random primers (Invitrogen) for 1 h at 45 °C in a total volume of 20 μl. RT was inactivated at 95 °C for 5 min. For each sample, an aliquot of DNase I-digested RNA, without RT, was used as a negative control for PCR amplification. The sequences of AIRAP, AIRAPL, HSP70, β-actin, and GAPDH primers were as follows: AIRAP, sense: 5′-TCATTTTCCATACGCTGCAC-3′, antisense: 5′-CTGTGGTCCAAAGGGTGTCT-3′; AIRAPL, sense: 5′-GTAATGTGCCTGTGCCTGTG-3′, antisense: 5′-CAGCTTGTGCTCTGGAGATG-3′; HSP701A, sense: 5′-CTACAAGGGGGAGACCAAGG-3′, antisense: 5′-TTCACCAGCCTGTTGTCAAA-3′; β-actin, sense: 5′-GCGCTCAGGAGGAGCAAT-3′, antisense: 5′-GCACTCTTCCAGCCTTCC-3′; GAPDH, sense: 5′-GTCATCAATGGAAATCCC-3′, antisense: 5′-GGTGGTGCAGGAGG-3′. Amplification was performed using the following parameters: 94 °C for 45 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s for 28 cycles for AIRAP, AIRAPL and HSP701A, and 24 cycles for β-actin and GAPDH. PCR products were electrophoresed alongside DNA Molecular Weight Marker IX (Roche Applied Science) in 2% agarose gels and then stained with ethidium bromide. PCR amplification was performed in a thermal cycler GeneAmp 2400 (Applied Biosystems), using Hot-Start Taq polymerase (Qiagen). Real-time RT-PCR analysis was performed with ABI PRISM 7000 (Applied Biosystem), using RealMasterMix ROX (Eppendorf) to prepare the reaction mixes. Primers used for real-time PCR of human genes were identical to the primers described above for semiquantitative RT-PCR. Primers used for real-time PCR of murine genes were the following: AIRAP, sense: 5′- CTGACTTGGGGAAGCACTGT-3′, antisense: 5′-GCAATTGTGGTCCAGAGGAT-3′; β-actin, sense: 5′-ACTGGGACGACATGGAGAAG-3′, antisense: 5′-TTTGATGTCACGCACGATTT-3′. Relative quantities of selected mRNAs were normalized to β-actin or GAPDH in the same samples. Cells were fixed by adding formaldehyde (Sigma) to the medium to a final concentration of 1%. After 15 min, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and scraped. After centrifugation, cells were lysed in L1 buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and proteases inhibitors) and centrifuged for 5′ at 3,000 rpm at 4 °C. After removal of supernatants, nuclei were resuspended in L2 buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA), and chromatin was sheared by sonication. After removal of nuclear debris by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 min at 8 °C, lysates were diluted 10-fold with DB buffer (50 mm Tris pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and then precleared for 3 h using 80 μl of 50% salmon sperm-DNA saturated protein A (ss-proteinA)-agarose beads. Immunoprecipitation was carried out at 4 °C overnight, and immune complexes were collected with ss-protein A-agarose beads. Antibodies utilized included anti-HSF1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) or preimmune rabbit serum as control for nonspecific interaction. After washing three times with high salt WB buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 m NaCl) and twice with low salt TE buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA), immunocomplexes were eluted with TE containing 1% SDS. Protein-DNA cross-links were reverted by incubating at 65 °C overnight. After proteinase K digestion, DNA was extracted with phenol-chloroform and precipitated with ethanol using 15 μg of tRNA as carrier. PCR was performed (30 cycles, denaturing at 94 °C for 45 s, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s and extension at 72 °C for 45 s, using the following primers: AIRAP, sense: 5′-CACTTCGAGAAGGGAAGTGG-3′, antisense: 5′-ACCGGAACGCAACATCTC-3′; HSP701A, sense: 5′-CACTCCCCCTTCCTCTCAG-3′, antisense: 5′-TTCCCTTCTGAGCCAATCAC-3′. For quantification of ChIP assays, samples from at least three independent experiments were analyzed by real time PCR. Data were normalized to the input DNA and DNA from untreated cells. Statistical analysis was performed using the Student's t test for unpaired data. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of duplicate samples. p values of < 0,05 were considered significant. We have previously generated a stable human cervical carcinoma cell line (HeLa-HSF1i) with HSF1 loss-of-function by using stable RNA-mediated interference (10Rossi A. Ciafrè S. Balsamo M. Pierimarchi P. Santoro M.G. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 7678-7685Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). By differential microarray analysis of gene expression profiles of HeLa-HSF1i versus HeLa control (HeLa-pS) cells under stress conditions, in addition to the canonical heat shock genes, we identified AIRAP as a new gene whose expression was increased after heat shock selectively in HeLa-pS cells. To confirm the results obtained in the microarray analysis, HeLa-pS and HeLa-HSF1i cells were either kept at 37 °C or were subjected to heat shock at 43 °C for 40 min and then allowed to recover at 37 °C. At different times during the recovery period, whole cell extracts were analyzed for HSF1 levels by Western blot and HSF1 DNA binding activity by EMSA; in parallel samples, total RNA was analyzed for AIRAP, the constitutively expressed AIRAP homologue (AIRAPL), HSP70, and β-actin expression by RT-PCR and real-time PCR. As expected, in HeLa-pS cells HSF1 activity was detected at the end of heat shock and continued during the recovery period for 1.5 h, after which time it declined rapidly (Fig. 1A, upper panel). HSF1 activation was followed by sustained AIRAP mRNA expression with kinetics similar to the HSP70 heat shock gene (Fig. 1, B and C). Differently from HeLa-pS cells, neither HSF1 activation nor induction of AIRAP and HSP70 expression, as determined by RT-PCR, were detected at any time in HeLa-HSF1i cells (Fig. 1, A and B). A modest increase in both HSP70 and AIRAP expression in heat-shocked HeLa-HSF1i cells was detected by real-time PCR (Fig. 1C), probably as a consequence of residual HSF1 activity; however, it cannot be excluded that HSF2, that is functional in HeLa-HSF1i cells (10Rossi A. Ciafrè S. Balsamo M. Pierimarchi P. Santoro M.G. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 7678-7685Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), or other transcription factors could contribute to this activity. No change in the mRNA levels of the constitutively expressed AIRAPL was detected at any time in both HeLa-pS and HeLa-HSF1i cells. The fact that AIRAP was induced only in HeLa-pS cells suggested that HSF1 might play a direct role in the induction of AIRAP expression. To investigate whether HSF1 is recruited to the AIRAP gene promoter. HeLa-pS cells were subjected to a 40 min heat shock at 43 °C and then allowed to recover at 37 °C. At different times during heat treatment and the recovery period, parallel samples were analyzed for HSF1 DNA binding activity by EMSA (Fig. 2A, upper panel) or for recruitment to the AIRAP and HSP70 promoters by ChIP analysis (Fig. 2A, lower panels). HSF1-coprecipitating DNA was analyzed by PCR (Fig. 2A) and real-time PCR (Fig. 2B) with promoter-specific primers amplifying the AIRAP and HSP70 promoter and the rate of amplification was verified using cross-linked, not immunoprecipitated chromatin. The specificity of chromatin immunoprecipitation was determined by using a control unrelated antibody. Consistently with the DNA binding activity revealed by EMSA (Fig. 2A, upper panel), HSF1 was recruited to the AIRAP promoter during heat treatment and for at least 90 min of the recovery period at 37 °C (Fig. 2A, middle panel). A similar kinetics of HSF1 recruitment was observed also for the HSP70 promoter (Fig. 2A, lower panel). To verify whether HSF1 binding to the AIRAP promoter effectively and selectively activates AIRAP gene transcription, the upstream region of the AIRAP gene (−1316 to +160) was cloned into the PGL3 reporter vector (AIRAP-PGL3, Fig. 2C) for luciferase reporter activity analysis. HeLa-pS and HeLa-HSF1i cells were transiently transfected with the AIRAP-PGL3 construct; after 24 h, transfected cells were subjected to heat stress at 43 °C for 40 min. Luciferase activity was determined after a 6 h recovery period at 37 °C. As shown in Fig. 2C, heat shock strongly induced reporter activity in HeLa-pS cells, whereas no significant transcriptional activity was detected in HeLa-HSF1i cells, suggesting that HSF1 plays an important role in the control of AIRAP gene expression. To confirm the role of HSF1 in the transcriptional control of the AIRAP promoter, HeLa-HSF1i cells were co-transfected with AIRAP-PGL3 and Flag-HSF1-pcDNA3 expression vectors, or with AIRAP-PGL3 and the Flag-pcDNA3 empty vector, and after 24 h were incubated at 43 °C for 40 min. After 6 h at 37 °C, whole cell extracts were analyzed for luciferase activity (Fig. 3A), and HSF1, AIRAP, HSP70, and β-actin levels were determined in the same samples by Western blot (Fig. 3B). As shown in Fig. 3B, HeLa-HSF1i cells transfected with the Flag-HSF1 construct express high levels of Flag-HSF1 protein. This result implies that the HSF1-specific shRNAi stably expressed in HeLa-HSF1i cells is able to suppress the basal level of endogenous HSF1, but is unable to prevent exogenous Flag-tagged-HSF1 overexpression. The exogenous Flag-HSF1 protein was found to be functional, being able to restore a canonical heat shock response in HeLa-HSF1i cells, as indicated by reactivation of endogenous HSP70 gene expression after heat shock (Fig. 3B). Concomitant with the ability to induce HSP70 protein expression, the exogenous Flag-HSF1 was able to restore heat shock-driven AIRAP promoter activity in transfected cells (Fig. 3A), as well as to induce endogenous AIRAP protein expression (Fig. 3B). Altogether these results demonstrate that HSF1 is indispensable for heat-induced AIRAP gene expression. To identify the enhancer elements responsible for HSF1-mediated AIRAP gene expression, the cloned 1316-bp region of the AIRAP promoter was analyzed by TFSEARCH version 1.3 (Yutaka Akiyama, TFSEARCH: Searching Transcription Factor Binding Sites) (14Heinemeyer T. Wingender E. Reuter I. Hermjakob H. Kel A.E. Kel O.V. Ignatieva E.V. Ananko E.A. Podkolodnaya O.A. Kolpakov F.A. Podkolodny N.L. Kolchanov N.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). Two putative HSE located at −27 (HSE1) and −211 (HSE2) from the transcription start site were detected (Fig. 4A). HSE1 presents a minimal dimeric binding site (see Fig. 4) with a score value computed by TFSEARCH similar to that calculated for HSE2 (72.5 and 73.2, respectively). In contrast to HSE1, the minimal dimeric binding site of HSE2 is part of a single contiguous array of seven units of the 5′-nGAAn-3′ consensus motif (Fig. 4, supplemental Fig. S1C, and Ref. 8Trinklein N.D. Murray J.I. Hartman S.J. Botstein D. Myers R.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1254-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). A construct deleted in the region comprising the two HSE elements (Δ-HSE-AIRAP-PGL3) was then prepared and utilized for reporter analysis. HeLa-pS cells were transfected with the wild-type AIRAP-PGL3 or the Δ-HSE-AIRAP-PGL3 constructs and after 24 h were heat stressed (43 °C for 40 min). Luciferase activity was determined after a 6 h recovery period at 37 °C. As shown in Fig. 4B, deletion of the −232 to +160 region, containing both HSE elements and neighboring sequences, resulted in abrogation of heat-induced reporter activity. It has been demonstrated that a mutation in the second nucleotide present in the HSE central nGAAn-bp unit (Fig. 5A) causes a strong reduction in HSF1 DNA binding activity in vitro (15Fernandes M. Xiao H. Lis J.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). To further define the role of the identified HSEs in heat shock-driven AIRAP induction, a G to T base mutation was inserted in both the HSE1 and the HSE2 elements, and the constructs AIRAP-PGL3-M26-HSE1 (M26) and AIRAP-PGL3-M210-HSE2 (M210), mutated in the HSE1 and the HSE2 elements respectively, were obtained (Fig. 5B, top). The M26, M210 or the wild-type (WT) constructs were transiently transfected in HeLa-pS cells. At 24 h after transfection, cells were subjected to heat shock, and the promoter activity was determined as described above. As shown in Fig. 5B, a G to T base mutation in the HSE1 core sequence did not alter the ability of the AIRAP promoter to respond to heat shock, whereas a similar mutation in the HSE2 element almost completely blocked heat-induced transcription. These data identify the HSE2 sequence present in the AIRAP promoter as a critical element for heat-induced AIRAP transcription. HSF1 activation by heat is strictly dependent on both the increase in temperature above physiological conditions and the duration of exposure. To investigate the effect of temperature on HSF1 DNA binding activity and AIRAP expression, HeLa-pS cells were either kept at 37 °C or subjected to heat shock at 39, 40, 41, 42, or 43 °C for 40 min. At the end of heat treatment, and after a 90-min recovery period at 37 °C, whole cell extracts were analyzed for HSF1 DNA binding activity by EMSA. In parallel samples levels of AIRAP, AIRAPL, HSP70, and β-actin mRNA were analyzed by RT-PCR and real-time PCR after the 90 min recovery period at 37 °C. As expected the intensity of HSF1 activation was temperature-dependent, and HSF1 DNA binding activity was detected at the end of the heat shock period starting at 41 °C (Fig. 6A). Following exposure to 41 and 42 °C, HSF1 DNA binding activity returned to control levels after a 90 min recovery at 37 °C, whereas after treatment at 43 °C HSF activation was still detected at this time (data not shown). Consistently with HSF1 activation, a temperature-dependent increase in AIRAP mRNA levels was detected starting at 41 °C, reaching maximal levels at 43 °C (Fig. 6, B and C). HSP70 mRNA levels were increased in a temperature-dependent manner, similarly to AIRAP mRNA, whereas no change in the constitutively expressed AIRAP homologue AIRAPL and β-actin levels was detected up to 43 °C. To determine whether AIRAP gene induction by heat represents a general response of human cells to temperature increase, human keratinocytes (HaCaT cells) and two human cancer cell lines of different origin (HCT116 colon carcinoma and Jurkat T-cell lymphoma) were incubated at 43 °C for 40 min and allowed to recover at 37 °C for 90 min. At this time, total RNA was extracted and levels of AIRAP, AIRAPL, HSP70, and β-actin mRNA were analyzed by RT-PCR and real-time PCR. As shown in Fig. 7, A and B, heat treatment resulted in an increase in AIRAP and HSP70 mRNA levels in all cell lines, while no changes were found in AIRAPL levels. Similar results were obtained in human primary blood monocytes subjected to heat stress (43 °C, 40 min) and analyzed at 1.5 and 3 h after recovery at 37 °C (Fig. 7, C and D), indicating that AIRAP expression represents a general response of human cells to temperature increase. After its initial discovery in Drosophila as a new puffing pattern of polytene chromosomes induced by heat (16Ritossa F. Experientia. 1962; 18: 571-573Crossref Scopus (1438) Google Scholar), it became rapidly evident that the HSR is a highly conserved cellular response leading to the rapid expression of cytoprotective heat shock proteins. In mammalian organisms during stress conditions different HSP act in concert constituting the “protein repair machinery” preventing protein denaturation and aggregation that are detrimental to cells, and promoting degradation of irreversibly denaturated cytotoxic proteins (3Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1427-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar, 17Jäättelä M. Ann. Med. 1999; 31: 261-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 18Parsell D.A. Lindquist S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 437-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (1846) Google Scholar). Under normal conditions, HSP also function as chaperones that assist in protein folding (19Dobson C.M. Nature. 2003; 426: 884-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (3658) Google Scholar). Mammalian genomes encode three homologues of HSF (HSF1, HSF2, and HSF4) regulating HSP expression. Among these HSF1 is considered to be the paralog responsible for regulating the heat-induced transcriptional response (4Anckar J. Sistonen L. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2007; 594: 78-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). HSF2 has also been reported to contribute to inducible expression of heat shock genes through interplay with HSF1 (20Sandqvist A. Björk J.K. Akerfelt M. Chitikova Z. Grichine A. Vourc'h C. Jolly C. Salminen T.A. Nymalm Y. Sistonen L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 1340-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Whereas it is well established that HSF1 regulates inducible HSP expression, recently it has become evident that the regulation of the mammalian HSR is a more complex phenomenon than previously thought.

We demonstrate that the pharmacological properties of insulin can be enhanced by design of ""zinc staples"" between hexamers. Paired (i, i+4) His substitutions were introduced at an alpha-helical surface. The crystal structure contains both classical axial zinc ions and novel zinc ions at hexamer-hexamer interfaces. Although soluble at pH 4, the combined electrostatic effects of the substitutions and bridging zinc ions cause isoelectric precipitation at neutral pH. Following subcutaneous injection in a diabetic rat, the analog effected glycemic control with a time course similar to that of long acting formulation Lantus. Relative to Lantus, however, the analog discriminates at least 30-fold more stringently between the insulin receptor and mitogenic insulin-like growth factor receptor. Because aberrant mitogenic signaling may be associated with elevated cancer risk, such enhanced specificity may improve safety. Zinc stapling provides a general strategy to modify the pharmacokinetic and biological properties of a subcutaneous protein depot."

However, emerging evidence has placed aberrantly expressed Ror2, leading to an invasive phenotype, in several cancers including renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

We sought to place Ror2 in the most commonly mutated pathway of RCC, the loss of the tumor suppressor von Hippel-Lindau (VHL), which causes hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha and -2alpha stabilization and the transcriptional activation of a broad repertoire of response genes. We found that Ror2 was indeed associated with the pVHL loss in RCC as well as with VHL somatic mutations tightly coordinated with the induction of RCC. Additionally, knockdown and rescue analysis of HIF expression suggests that Ror2 is dependent on pathologic stabilization of either HIF-1alpha or HIF-2alpha. Subsequent evaluation of the ROR2 promoter suggests that HIF-2alpha and its dimerization partner, aryl hydrocarbon nuclear transferase localize to the ROR2 promoter via a cryptic transcriptional element. This data substantiates a unique regulation pattern for Ror2 in the VHL-HIF axis that has the potential to be applied to other cancer etiologies."
https://openalex.org/W2069454329,"Erk-5, a member of the MAPK superfamily, has a catalytic domain similar to Erk1/2 and a unique C-terminal domain enabling binding with transcription factors. Aberrant vascularization in the Erk5-null mice suggested a link to angiogenesis. Ectopic expression of constitutively active Erk5 blocks endothelial cell morphogenesis and causes HIF1-alpha destabilization/degradation. However the mechanisms by which endogenous Erk5 regulates angiogenesis remain unknown. We show that Erk5 and its activating kinase MEK5 are the upstream mediators of the anti-angiogenic signal by the natural angiogenesis inhibitor, pigment epithelial-derived factor (PEDF). We demonstrate that Erk5 phosphorylation allows activation of PPARgamma transcription factor by displacement of SMRT co-repressor. PPARgamma, in turn is critical for NFkappaB activation, PEDF-dependent apoptosis, and anti-angiogenesis. The dominant negative MEK5 mutant and Erk5 shRNA diminished PEDF-dependent apoptosis, inhibition of the endothelial cell chemotaxis, and angiogenesis. This is the first evidence of Erk5-dependent transduction of signals by endogenous angiogenesis inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2039176887,"The AIRE protein plays a remarkable role as a regulator of central tolerance by controlling the promiscuous expression of tissue-specific antigens in thymic medullary epithelial cells. Defects in the AIRE gene cause the autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy, a rare disease frequent in Iranian Jews, Finns, and Sardinian population. To this day, the precise function of the AIRE protein in regulating transcription and its interacting proteins has yet to be entirely clarified. The knowledge of novel AIRE interactors and their precise role will improve our knowledge of its biological activity and address some of the foremost autoimmunity-related questions. In this study, we have used a yeast two-hybrid system to identify AIRE-interacting proteins. This approach led us to the discovery of a new AIRE-interacting protein called DAXX. The protein is known to be a multifunctional adaptor with functions both in apoptosis and in transcription regulation pathways. The interaction between AIRE and DAXX has been validated by in vivo coimmunoprecipitation analysis and colocalization study in mammalian cells. The interaction has been further confirmed by showing in transactivation assays that DAXX exerts a strong repressive role on the transcriptional activity of AIRE."
https://openalex.org/W2052822518,"Microarray gene expression data has been used in genome-wide association studies to allow researchers to study gene regulation as well as other complex phenotypes including disease risks and drug response. To reach scientifically sound conclusions from these studies, however, it is necessary to get reliable summarization of gene expression intensities. Among various factors that could affect expression profiling using a microarray platform, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in target mRNA may lead to reduced signal intensity measurements and result in spurious results. The recently released 1000 Genomes Project dataset provides an opportunity to evaluate the distribution of both known and novel SNPs in the International HapMap Project lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). We mapped the 1000 Genomes Project genotypic data to the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Exon 1.0ST array (exon array), which had been used in our previous studies and for which gene expression data had been made publicly available. We also evaluated the potential impact of these SNPs on the differentially spliced probesets we had identified previously. Though the 1000 Genomes Project data allowed a comprehensive survey of the SNPs in this particular array, the same approach can certainly be applied to other microarray platforms. Furthermore, we present a detailed catalogue of SNP-containing probesets (exon-level) and transcript clusters (gene-level), which can be considered in evaluating findings using the exon array as well as benefit the design of follow-up experiments and data re-analysis."

The cylindrical (1.1-m diameter, 0.48-m tall), 120-kg spacecraft was spin-stabilized, rotating between 8 and 12 times per min. It carried two television cameras that pointed parallel to the spin axis and could take 32 pictures per orbit (1). Although the results were modest by today's standards (see the figure), TIROS 1 revolutionized the field of meteorology."
