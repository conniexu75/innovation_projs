https://openalex.org/W1615152444,"Cholera toxin and pertussis toxin catalyze ADP-ribosylation of the alpha-subunits of the GTP-binding stimulatory (Ns) and inhibitory (Ni) coupling components, respectively, of adenylate cyclase. Cholera toxin also catalyzes the ADP-ribosylation of transducin, the GTP-binding signal-coupling protein of retinal rod outer segments, and thereby reduces its light-stimulated GTPase activity. We show here that pertussis toxin also ADP-ribosylates transducin. Illumination markedly inhibits the ADP-ribosylation of transducin by pertussis toxin. ADP-ribosylation by this toxin in the dark is also lessened by prior incubation with hydrolysis-resistant GTP analogs. These inhibitory effects indicate that the GDP complex of transducin is the preferred form for ADP-ribosylation by pertussis toxin. Transducin modified by this toxin has a lower affinity for photoexcited rhodopsin than does unmodified transducin. ADP-ribosylation inhibits the light-stimulated GTPase activity of rod outer segments and blocks the signal-coupling activity of transducin in photoactivation of the phosphodiesterase. These and previous results show that cholera and pertussis toxins preferentially ADP-ribosylate the active (GTP-binding) and inactive (GDP-binding) conformations, respectively, of transducin. Correspondingly, ADP-ribosylation by these toxins inhibits GTPase activity by stabilizing transducin in the preferred active (GTP-binding) or inactive (GDP-binding) conformation. The actions of pertussis toxin on retinal rod outer segments provide further evidence for a high degree of homology between retinal transducin and the N proteins of the adenylate cyclase system."

https://openalex.org/W1569033208,"The inhibitory and stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory components (Gi and Gs) of adenylate cyclase both have an alpha X beta subunit structure, and the beta subunits are functionally indistinguishable. GTP-dependent hormonal inhibition of adenylate cyclase and that caused by guanine nucleotide analogs seem to result from dissociation of the subunits of Gi. Such inhibition can be explained by reduction of the concentration of the free alpha subunit of Gs as a result of its interaction with the beta subunit of Gi in normal Gs-containing membranes. However, inhibition in S49 lymphoma cyc- cell membranes presumably cannot be explained by the Gi-Gs interaction, since the activity of the alpha subunit of Gs is not detectable in this variant. Several characteristics of Gi-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase have been studied in both S49 cyc- and wild type membranes. There are several similarities between inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase by guanine nucleotides and somatostatin in cyc- and wild type membranes. 1) Somatostatin-induced inhibition of the enzyme is dependent on GTP; nonhydrolyzable GTP analogs are also effective inhibitors. 2) The effect of guanosine-5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) is essentially irreversible, and somatostatin accelerates GTP gamma S-induced inhibition. 3) Inhibition of adenylate cyclase by somatostatin or Gpp(NH)p is attenuated by treatment of cells with islet-activating protein (IAP). 4) Both cyc- and wild type membranes contain the substrate for IAP-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation (the alpha subunit of Gi). 5) beta Subunit activity in detergent extracts of membranes is liberated by exposure of the membranes to GTP gamma S. The alpha subunit of Gi in such extracts has a reduced ability to be ADP-ribosylated by IAP, which implies that this subunit is in the GTP gamma S-bound form. The resolved subunits of Gi have been tested as regulators of cyc- and wild type adenylate cyclase under a variety of conditions. The alpha subunit of Gi inhibits forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in cyc-, while the beta subunit stimulates; these actions are opposite to those seen with wild type membranes. The inhibitory effects of GTP plus somatostatin (or GTP gamma S) and the alpha subunit of Gi are not additive in cyc- membranes. In wild type, the inhibitory effects of the hormone and GTP gamma S are not additive with those of the beta subunit.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1571575178,"Treatment of a subclone of the PC12 pheochromocytoma cell line, PC8b, with either dexamethasone or 8-bromo cyclic AMP resulted in increased translational activity of tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA (mRNATH). Poly(A+)-containing RNA from cells treated with both inducers was used to construct a cDNA library. Double-stranded cDNA was inserted into the PstI site of pBR322 using GC tailing, and plasmids were used to transform Escherichia coli HB101. Colonies containing plasmids with inserted sequences were initially screened by DNA dot hybridization, and those positive colonies were then screened by hybrid selected translation. One plasmid, pTH.4, was identified as containing a 400-base pair sequence complementary to mRNATH. Nick-translated pTH.4 DNA was used to identify mRNATH as containing approximately 1800 nucleotides by Northern blot analysis. PC8b cells treated with either dexamethasone or 8-bromo cyclic AMP yielded greater mRNATH hybridization on Northern blot analysis and accumulated higher molecular weight tyrosine hydroxylase RNA species. Following treatment of cells with inducers, the temporal increase in tyrosine hydroxylase enzyme activity was associated in all cases with an increase in the translational activity and relative amount of mRNATH, and the fold increase in the latter two parameters was equal to or greater than the increase in enzyme activity."

Regeneration of processes by retinal ganglion cells was enhanced when the cells were plated on glass coated with a monoclonal antibody against the Thy-1 determinant.

https://openalex.org/W1547215364,"Abstract In the companion report we used primary cultures of adult rat hepatocytes to demonstrate that glucocorticoids comprise a class of compounds that stimulate de novo synthesis of a form of cytochrome P-450 (P450PCN) indistinguishable from that induced by the nonhormonal steroid pregnenolone 16 alpha-carbonitrile (PCN). Because induction of P450PCN is stereospecific for glucocorticoids and is dependent on the concentration of and the length of exposure to steroids it seemed possible that P450PCN represented another of the many genes whose expression is coordinately regulated by glucocorticoids bound to their specific cytoplasmic receptor and translocated into the nucleus. However, in cultured hepatocytes treated with glucocorticoids, synthesis of P450PCN failed to parallel synthesis of a typical glucocorticoid-responsive liver function, tyrosine aminotransferase, in the time course of induction, in the concentrations of glucocorticoids required for half-maximal induction, and in the order of effective steroids ranked by potency. Indeed, two moderately potent inducers of P450PCN either failed to induce tyrosine aminotransferase (spironolactone) or actually antagonized induction of tyrosine aminotransferase synthesis by glucocorticoids (PCN). Moreover, in the same cultures in which glucocorticoid induction of tyrosine aminotransferase was blocked by the presence of PCN or other previously identified antiglucocorticoids, synthesis of P450PCN was actually enhanced. We conclude that synthesis of P450PCN is a specific glucocorticoid-responsive liver function evoked by a novel mechanism readily distinguishable from the classic glucocorticoid receptor pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2077020659,"Mononuclear blood cells were obtained from a patient with type A insulin resistance. The cells showed a normal ability to bind iodine 125-labeled insulin. Analysis of solubilized insulin receptors from the patient's cells revealed a defect in insulin-stimulated tyrosine kinase activity, which is closely associated with the receptor itself. The enzyme failed to phosphorylate the insulin receptor and showed a markedly reduced ability to phosphorylate exogenously added substrates. It appears that receptors from this insulin-resistant patient have a defect distal to the insulin-binding site (the alpha subunit of the receptor). The defect could be located in the beta subunit, which has an adenosine triphosphate-binding site, or in another receptor component that transfers a signal of insulin binding into kinase activity. This dissociation between the normal binding and the defective protein kinase component of the insulin receptor represents the first biochemical defect of the receptor distal to ligand binding."
https://openalex.org/W1519933450,"We administered a series of steroid hormones to primary nonproliferating cultures of adult rat hepatocytes and found that dexamethasone and other glucocorticoids but not sex steroid hormones, mineralocorticoids, or derivatives of pregnenolone other than pregnenolone 16 alpha-carbonitrile (PCN) stimulated de novo synthesis of an immunoreactive protein, indistinguishable from the form of cytochrome P-450 (P450PCN) induced by PCN in rat liver. No difference were discerned among purified liver cytochromes from rats treated with dexamethasone, PCN or dexamethasone plus PCN, among proteolytic digests of these proteins, or among the immunoprecipitated cytochromes prepared from cultured hepatocytes treated with these steroids as judged by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels containing sodium dodecyl sulfate followed by immunoblot analysis. Of the steroids tested, dexamethasone proved to be the most efficacious inducer increasing the rate of synthesis of P450PCN from 0.05% of total cellular protein synthesis in incubated control cultures (measured as incorporation of [3H]leucine into immunoprecipitable P450PCN) to as much as 9.4% in cultures incubated for 5 days in medium containing dexamethasone (10(-5) M). As with traditional glucocorticoid-responsive liver functions, induction of immunoreactive P450PCN was dependent on the concentration of dexamethasone (10(-8) to 10(-5) M) and was promptly reversed upon withdrawal of the steroid. However, during the 24-h interval between 24 to 48 h of culture age the hepatocytes were refractory to either induction or de-induction of immunoreactive P450PCN even though continuous exposure of the cells to dexamethasone (including this interval) was mandatory for maximal induction of P450PCN at 120 h in culture. Unlike cultured rat hepatocytes, HTC hepatoma cultures failed to exhibit dexamethasone-responsive expression of immunoreactive P450PCN. We conclude that glucocorticoids and PCN constitute a specific class of synthetic and endogenous inducers of a single form of cytochrome P-450."
https://openalex.org/W1996272241,"Immunohistochemical analysis of adenosine deaminase in rat brain revealed an extensive plexus of adenosine deaminase-containing neurons in the basal hypothalamus. These neurons converged on and were most numerous in three major centers, namely, the tuberal, caudal, and postmammillary caudal magnocellular nuclei. Most other brain regions were devoid of cells containing adenosine deaminase. Some adenosine deaminase-containing neurons were retrogradely labeled with the fluorescent dye fast blue when the dye was injected into the frontal cortex and striatum. Specific populations of neurons having high levels of adenosine deaminase may release adenosine as a neurotransmitter."
https://openalex.org/W2079841863,"Localization of [3H]estradiol in tyrosine hydroxylase-containing neurons of rat brain was shown by a combined technique of autoradiography and immunohistochemistry. [3H]Estradiol was concentrated in the nuclei of tyrosine hydroxylase-containing neurons in the nucleus arcuatus, nucleus periventricularis hypothalami, and the zona incerta. These results suggest that estradiol acts directly on dopamine-producing neurons of the tuberoinfundibular system and incertohypothalamic system."

This gene contains a single intron that interrupts the coding sequence in the propeptide portion of the somatostatin moiety. The site of initiation of transcription of the gene was located by transcription experiments in HeLa cell extracts, and the putative regions for controlling the initiation of transcription were identified."
https://openalex.org/W1966726499,"A rapid decrease in the translational efficiency of mRNA synthesized during vegetative growth is associated with the initiation of development in Dictyostelium discoideum. In contrast, newly synthesized mRNA associates with polysomes with high efficiency. Discrimination between these two mRNA populations correlates with a rapid shortening of the poly(A) tract on the preexisting mRNA. A model is proposed in which a critical poly(A) length regulates the pattern of protein synthesis by affecting the efficiency with which mRNAs can interact with the translational machinery. The model suggests that transcriptional and translational controls can be coupled by altering the state of adenylation of the preexisting mRNA population. The model allows radical changes in the pattern of protein synthesis without wholesale destruction of preexisting mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1487851602,"Treatment of K562 cells with the iron chelator desferrioxamine results in the gradual increase in total cell receptors for transferrin. Receptor number rises 2.5-4.5-fold over 24 h and remains at the elevated level if the chelator is continuously present. Preincubation of the chelator with ferric chloride abolishes the effect. The drug has no effect on the 7-h half-life of the receptor. The increased number of receptors can be accounted for by a specific increase in the rate of receptor biosynthesis which reaches 3-4 times that seen in untreated cells by 6 h after the addition of the chelator. Isolation of mRNA from treated cells reveals that, after 8 h in the presence of desferrioxamine, there is a 3-fold increase in the specific translation of transferrin receptor over untreated cells. Total protein synthesis is not changed under these conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1563428629,"The transport activity for cystine and glutamate in cultured human diploid fibroblasts is enhanced in response to diethyl maleate treatment. The enhancement is time- and dose-related, with a lag of about 3 h, and maximum enhancement (approximately 3-fold increase in the rate of uptake) is attained after 1 to 2 days of incubation of the cells with 0.1 mM diethyl maleate. The enhancement of the transport activity is accompanied by an increase in the Vmax and little change in the Km, and it requires RNA and protein synthesis. Other electrophilic agents, such as cyclohex-2-en-1-one, ethacrynic acid, 1,2-epoxy-3-(p-nitro-phenoxy)propane, and sulfobromophthalein, similarly enhance the transport activity. These electrophiles are known as agents that interact with glutathione. For example, diethyl maleate at high concentrations, i.e. 1 mM, depletes intracellular glutathione and injures the cells. However, at relatively low concentrations diethyl maleate and other electrophilic compounds do cause increases in the intracellular levels of glutathione which we attribute to the enhanced uptake of cystine. It is suggested that the transport system for cystine and glutamate is involved in a protective mechanism of cells against an electrophilic attack."

Chloride or bromide serve as co-ions balancing electrogenic proton pumping. ATP-driven proton translocation can be observed in the absence of chloride, provided the membrane potential is collapsed by K+ moving out in the presence of valinomycin. Chloride transport can be observed independent of proton movements in the absence of ATP, provided an inside positive membrane potential is generated by K+ moving from the outside to the inside in the presence of valinomycin."
https://openalex.org/W1535751027,"gamma-Glutamylcysteine synthetase (isolated from rat kidney) has one sulfhydryl group that reacts with 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoate). This single exposed sulfhydryl group is not required for enzyme activity. The enzyme is potently inactivated by cystamine, which apparently interacts with a sulfhydryl group at the active site to form a mixed disulfide. 5,5'-Dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoate) does not interact with the sulfhydryl group that reacts with cystamine. After the enzyme was 90% inactivated by reaction with cystamine, 3.4 mol of 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoate) reacted per mol of enzyme, indicating that binding of cystamine exposes sulfhydryl groups which are apparently buried or unreactive in the native enzyme. L-Glutamate (but not D-glutamate or L-alpha-aminobutyrate) protected against inactivation by cystamine. In contrast, ATP enhanced the rate of inactivation by cystamine, and the apparent Km value for this effect is similar to that for ATP in the catalytic reaction. Studies on the structural features of cystamine that facilitate its interaction with the enzyme showed that selenocystamine, monodansylcystamine, and N-[2[2-aminoethyl)-dithio)ethyl]-4-azido-2-nitrobenzeneamine are also good inhibitors. Whereas S-(S-methyl)cysteamine-Sepharose does not interact with the enzyme (Seelig, G. F., and Meister, A. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 5092-5096), S-(S-methyl)cysteamine is a potent inhibitor; 1 mol of this compound completely inactivated 1 mol of enzyme. In the course of this work, a useful modification of the method for isolating this enzyme from kidney was developed."
https://openalex.org/W1608649140,"Plasma membrane vesicles isolated from bovine epididymal and ejaculated spermatozoa have widely different capabilities for transporting Ca2+. Spermatozoa were ruptured by nitrogen cavitation, and the plasma membrane fraction was harvested after low speed and sucrose gradient centrifugation; purity was assessed by marker enzyme analyses, electron microscopy, and sedimentation properties. Plasma membrane vesicles isolated from epididymal sperm accumulate Ca2+ passively at a faster rate and to a greater extent than vesicles prepared from ejaculated sperm. Ca2+ transport across bovine sperm plasma membranes is an ATP-independent, Na+-dependent process that obligatorily exchanges intravesicular Na+ for external Ca2+. The rate of Na+/Ca2+ exchange is significantly lower in ejaculated sperm vesicles than in those of epididymal sperm. Bovine plasma membranes contain little or no Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity. It is suggested that, at the time of ejaculation, calcium flux into bovine sperm is prevented by the interaction of the plasma membrane with putative factors in seminal fluid that specifically interfere with Na+/Ca2+ exchange. We have isolated a protein from seminal plasma that prevents calcium accumulation by bovine epididymal sperm (Rufo, G. A., Jr., Singh, J. P., Babcock, D. F., and Lardy, H. A. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 4627-4632). A protein with properties resembling those of the seminal calcium transport inhibitor is found on the membrane vesicles from ejaculated sperm but not on membranes from epididymal sperm. We conclude that this protein binds strongly to the plasma membrane of bovine sperm and is responsible for preventing calcium uptake by ejaculated sperm."
https://openalex.org/W2135889730,"Uptake of cystine and factors affecting the transport were investigated in adult rat hepatocytes in primary monolayer culture. The cystine uptake was initially mediated by Na+-dependent route(s). However, the activity of Na+-dependent uptake decreased markedly during the culture, and Na+-independent uptake emerged with a lag period of 12 h in response to insulin and dexamethasone in the culture medium. After 48 h in culture, cystine was mainly transported into the cells through this Na+-independent route. The action of insulin and dexamethasone on the enhancement of the Na+-independent uptake was apparently additive, and the enhancement was completely blocked by cycloheximide or actinomycin D. Emergence of the Na+-independent uptake of cystine was also regulated by cell density; at lower density, the uptake tended to be elevated. The transport of cystine through the Na+-independent system was pH sensitive and was inhibited by some anionic amino acids, such as glutamate and homocysteate, but not by aspartate. These results suggest that the emerging system is similar to the ones reported in fibroblasts and in some hepatoma cell lines; the anionic form of cystine is transported through the system."
https://openalex.org/W1608492150,"Confluent monolayers of LLC-PK1 cells, an epithelial cell derived from a normal pig kidney, contain high levels of alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activities. Inhibition studies show a close similarity between alkaline phosphatase and the so-called liver-bone-kidney isoenzyme. Nearly complete recovery of both activities in the microsomal fraction demonstrates the membrane-bound characteristics of these enzymes. Histochemical localization of the enzymes activities on the apical membrane of LLC-PK1 cells confirms this observation. The activity of both enzymes decreases to very low levels when the cells are in exponential growth. Confluent monolayers of LLC-PK1 cells plated at saturation density with cells that were in active growth show a progressive increase in the activity of alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. This increase is dependent on the synthesis de novo of RNA and protein and supports the conclusion that the activity of both enzymes is regulated at the transcriptional level. The development of these enzymes is delayed with respect to the development of the occluding junctions. This delay and the direct appearance of alkaline phosphatase activity in the apical membrane indicate that the different components of this membrane are inserted after the limits of the membrane have been established by the synthesis and assembly of the occluding junctions. Alkaline phosphatase activity of confluent monolayers can be further induced by reducing the concentration of phosphate in the medium. When the junctions are dissociated by incubating the monolayers in Ca2+-free medium, the alkaline phosphatase activity migrates freely beyond the limits of the apical membrane until it covers the entire cell surface. Both enzymes are synthesized even in the absence of contact between the cells, suggesting that the occluding junctions in LLC-PK1 monolayers are involved in the polarized distribution, but not in the modulation, of the synthesis of these enzymes. In addition, the progressive decrease in enzyme synthesis that is obtained by reducing the cell-substratum adhesion supports the idea that it is the cell-to-substrate and not the cell-to-cell interaction which is involved in the modulation of these enzymatic markers of the apical membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1578136772,"Glucose exerts opposite effects upon glucagon and insulin release from the endocrine pancreas. Glucose uptake and oxidation were therefore compared in purified A- and B-cells. In purified B-cells, the intracellular concentration of glucose or 3-O-methyl-D-glucose equilibrates within 2 min with the extracellular levels, and, like in intact islets, the rate of glucose oxidation displays a sigmoidal dose-response curve for glucose. In contrast, even after 5 min of incubation, the apparent distribution space of D-glucose or 3-O-methyl-D-glucose in A-cells remains much lower than the intracellular volume. In A-cells, both the rate of 3-O-methyl-D-glucose uptake and glucose oxidation proceed proportional to the hexose concentration up to 10 mM and reach saturation at higher concentrations. Addition of insulin failed to affect 3-O-methyl-D-glucose or D-glucose uptake and glucose oxidation by purified A-cells. Glucose releases 30-fold more insulin from islets than from single B-cells, but this marked difference is not associated with differences in glucose handling. The rate of glucose oxidation is virtually identical in single and reaggregated B-cells and is not altered after addition of glucagon or somatostatin. It is concluded that the dependency of glucose-induced insulin release upon the functional coordination between islet cells is not mediated through changes in glucose metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1525322176,"Clathrin-coated vesicles contain a proton translocating ATPase which operates in parallel with a chloride transporter (Xie, X.-S., Stone, D.K., and Racker, E. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 14834-14838). The polypeptide antibiotic, duramycin, has a dual inhibitory effect on clathrin-coated vesicle acidification. Low amounts of duramycin (5 micrograms/100 micrograms of protein) inhibit by 50% the proton translocation facilitated by chloride translocation. Under these conditions duramycin inhibits also 36Cl uptake when driven by either the electrogenic proton pump or by inward directed K+ movement in the presence of valinomycin. Higher amounts of duramycin (20 micrograms/100 micrograms of protein) are needed to inhibit by 50% the proton pump itself, as evidenced by reduced proton translocation facilitated by an outward potassium movement in the presence of valinomycin. In addition, the amount of duramycin needed to inhibit the proton pump corresponded well with the amount needed to inhibit the ouabain-insensitive, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive ATPase activity of clathrin-coated vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W1505493040,"The fluorescence of TNP-nucleotides bound to sarcoplasmic reticulum ATPase is enhanced upon formation of phosphorylated enzyme intermediate either with ATP in the presence of Ca2+ or, to a greater extent, with Pi in the absence of Ca2+. Binding of the TNP-nucleotides does not occur if the ATPase is labeled at the active site with fluorescein isothiocyanate. Addition of ADP to the TNP-nucleotide X enzyme complex phosphorylated with Pi causes dissociation of TNP-nucleotide and a proportional reduction in fluorescence. These and other kinetic observations indicate that the TNP-nucleotide exchanges with ADP following enzyme phosphorylation with ATP or occupies the ADP portion of the catalytic site following enzyme phosphorylation with Pi. This interaction with the phosphorylated site results in fluorescence enhancement of the TNP-nucleotide. Comparison of the TNP-nucleotide fluorescence features in different solvents with that of the TNP-nucleotide bound to sarcoplasmic reticulum ATPase indicates that, following phosphorylation, the binding domain excludes solvent molecules and confers restricted mobility to the TNP-nucleotide. Solvent exclusion and substrate immobilization accompany, to a greater extent, phosphorylation of the active site with Pi in the absence of Ca2+. TNP-nucleotides bound to the catalytic sites were also found to be acceptors of resonance energy transfer from enzyme tryptophan in the extramembranous domain of the ATPase which also contains the catalytic site."

Treatment of 70 g of frozen cell paste produces about 7 mg of pure enzyme, a yield of about 35%. The native molecular weight, determined by equilibrium sedimentation, is 80,900 +/- 4,300. The subunit molecular weight, determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is 38,400 +/- 2,600, and by amino acid analysis is 41,000. The enzyme is thus a dimer and contains 0.95 +/- 0.08 tightly bound zinc atoms per subunit when isolated by the described procedure, which would remove any loosely bound metal ions. Isoelectric focusing under native conditions yields a major species at isoelectric point 4.97 +/- 0.27 and a minor species at 5.26 +/- 0.27; dihydroorotase activity is proportionately associated with both bands. The enzyme has a partial specific volume of 0.737 ml/g calculated from the amino acid composition and a specific absorption at 278 nm of 0.638 for a 1 mg/ml solution. At 30 degrees C, the Michaelis constant and kcat for dihydro-DL-orotate (at pH 8.0) are 0.0756 mM and 127 s-1, respectively; for N-carbamyl-DL-aspartate (at pH 5.80), they are 1.07 mM and 195 s-1."
https://openalex.org/W1604298442,"Rat kidney gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase is composed of two nonidentical glycosylated subunits. The enzyme is localized on the lumenal surface of the brush-border membranes of proximal tubule epithelial cells; it is attached to the membranes via an NH2-terminal segment of the larger of the two subunits. Tissue-labeling experiments followed by immunoprecipitation with antibodies directed against the enzyme and its two subunits demonstrate that a glycosylated single chain precursor (Mr = 78,000), containing the elements of both the subunits, is initially synthesized. Pulse-chase studies in the presence of pactamycin, and inhibitor of protein synthesis initiation, indicate that the larger of the two subunits is located at the NH2 terminus of the Mr = 78,000 precursor. The initial events in the biosynthesis and processing of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase were investigated by in vitro translation of rat kidney mRNA. Such translation results in the synthesis of a Mr = 63,000 unglycosylated polypeptide which has been shown immunologically to contain the domains for both subunits. The Mr = 63,000 species is processed to a Mr = 78,000 core-glycosylated polypeptide when translation of mRNA is carried out in the presence of dog pancreas microsomes. This processing does not appear to be associated with cleavage of an NH2-terminal leader sequence. The Mr = 78,000 polypeptide is integrated into the microsomal membranes with an orientation that is analogous to that found on the brush-border membranes. Glycosylation and membrane integration of transpeptidase are cotranslational events. Upon longer incubation, the Mr = 78,000 species sequestered within the microsomal vesicles is cleaved to species corresponding in size to the two subunits of the kidney enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2091621280,"Cultures derived from rat cerebral hemispheres were sequentially stained for acetylcholinesterase activity and for either somatostatin-like immunoreactivity or cholecystokinin-like immunoreactivity. Somatostatin-like immunoreactivity was found to coexist with acetylcholinesterase activity in individual neurons of several morphological subtypes, but cholecystokinin-like immunoreactivity and acetycholinesterase activity were never seen in the same neurons. These findings suggest a specific anatomical association, perhaps even an overlap, of the cholinergic and somatostatinergic systems in the mammalian cerebrum, and indicate that the combined deficiencies of somatostatin and cholinergic markers in Alzheimer's dementia and senile dementia of the Alzheimer type may be of pathophysiological importance."

The molecular weight of the enzyme, estimated by gel filtration in the presence of the detergent on a Sephadex G-200 column, was 200,000 +/- 15,000. The enzyme was purified at least 300-fold from rat liver plasma membranes and had a specific activity of 19.7 mumol/mg/min. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions of the purified enzyme indicated that the enzymatic activity correlated with the major protein band. In sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, one major band in the molecular weight range of 70,000 +/- 5,000 was seen. The isoelectric point of the purified enzyme was 6.9 +/- 0.2 as determined by analytical isoelectric focusing.

https://openalex.org/W1487971744,"The correlation curve between phosphorylation and MgATPase activity suggests that the 20,000-dalton light chain of both heads of a smooth muscle myosin or heavy meromyosin (HMM) molecule must be phosphorylated before the MgATPase activity of either head can be activated by actin. The two heads of HMM appear to be phosphorylated randomly at equal rates, while those of myosin are phosphorylated in a negatively cooperative manner (Persechini, A., and Hartshorne, D.J. (1981) Science, 213, 1383-1385; Ikebe, M., Ogihara, S., and Tonomura, Y. (1982) J. Biochem. 91, 1809-1812). We have investigated the cause of this difference between HMM and myosin. We find that if myosin is first phosphorylated at high ionic strength (0.6 M KCl), where it is monomeric, and then assayed for MgATPase activity (in 0.05 M KCl), the data support a model where the two heads are phosphorylated randomly with equal rates (i.e. similarly to HMM). The correlation curves between MgATPase activity and dephosphorylation of fully phosphorylated myosin, both in a filamentous and monomeric state, are also best explained by a model where dephosphorylation of one head is sufficient to deactivate the entire molecule. With monomeric myosin, the dephosphorylation appears to occur randomly with equal rates, whereas with filamentous myosin the dephosphorylation appears to be negatively cooperative. The correlation between dephosphorylation of HMM and its MgATPase activity is more complex and is consistent with a positively cooperative dephosphorylation. Direct analyses of the time courses of phosphorylation of HMM and monomeric myosin show that a single exponential is sufficient to fit the data through greater than 90% of the reaction. However, when phosphorylation is carried out at low ionic strength (0.02 M KCl), where myosin is present as filaments, the time course consists of two exponential functions where the rate constant for the phosphorylation of one myosin head is 6-10 times greater than that for the other head which is located on the same molecule. This suggests that when myosin is polymerized into filaments the two previously indistinguishable heads either become nonequivalent or are subject to head-head interactions leading to a negatively cooperative phosphorylation reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1499650759,"Competition by beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists for 125I-pindolol binding sites on intact cells (1321N1 human astrocytoma and C62B rat glioma) was measured using short time binding assays as previously described (Toews, M. L., Harden, T. K., and Perkins, J. P. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80, 3553-3557). Preincubation of cells with agonists converted about half of the cellular beta-adrenergic receptors from a form exhibiting high affinity for the agonists isoproterenol and epinephrine and the antagonist sotalol to a form exhibiting much lower apparent affinity for these ligands in short time assays. Exposure to agonists did not alter the affinity of receptors for the antagonist metoprolol. This change in the ligand binding properties of the receptor was rapid (t1/2 = 1-2 min following a lag of about 0.5 min), reversible (t1/2 = 6-8 min), and dependent on the agonist concentration present during the preincubation (K0.5 = 15 nM for isoproterenol). Both isoproterenol and sotalol attained equilibrium with the high affinity receptors very rapidly but equilibrated only slowly with those receptors exhibiting low apparent affinity in short time assays. These results are interpreted in terms of a model which postulates that both the low apparent affinity in short time assays and the subsequent slow equilibration of hydrophilic ligands with these receptors result from agonist-induced internalization of a fraction of cell surface beta-adrenergic receptors. The relationship of this change in receptor binding properties to other aspects of agonist-induced desensitization of the beta-adrenergic receptor-coupled adenylate cyclase system is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1560799284,"We compared the effect of reductions in pH from 7.0 to 6.5 and to 6.2 on Mg-ATPase activity and Ca2+ binding of rabbit psoas myofilaments. The amounts of Ca2+ bound attributable to myofilament whole troponin complexes (Tn) were determined from studies on Tn free (desensitized) myofibrils and from measurements of the myofilament Ca2+ binding subunit of Tn content (0.55 +/- 0.10 nmol/mg of myofilament protein). The myofibrillar Mg-ATPase activity was half-maximal at the -log molar free Ca2+ concentration (pCa) 5.83 at pH 7.0, 5.54 at pH 6.5, and 5.43 at pH 6.2 Maximal ATPase activity was the same at the three pH values as was the ATPase activity of desensitized myofibrils. The amounts of Ca2+ bound to myofibrils or chemically skinned fibers as a function of pCa decreased as pH was lowered from 7.0 to 6.5 and to 6.2 in a manner predicted from the pH-induced shifts in Mg-ATPase activity as a function of pCa. The alterations in myofibrillar ATPase activity and Ca2+ binding associated with the acidic pH values occurred whether or not EGTA was used to buffer the free Ca2+ concentration. Moreover, lowering the pH from 7.0 to 6.2 reduced Ca2+ binding to myofilament Tn whether or not the fibers and myofibrils were in rigor. Our data indicate that the effects of acidic pH on myofilament ATPase activity and Ca2+-binding are related to a reduction in the affinity of Ca2+-binding sites on Tn."
https://openalex.org/W1538247717,"As reported previously, some dogs possess red cells characterized by low Na+, high K+ concentrations, and high activity of (Na+, K+)-ATPase, although normal dog red cells contain low K+, high Na+, and lack (Na+, K+)-ATPase. Furthermore, these red cells show increased activities of L-glutamate and L-aspartate transport, resulting in high accumulations of such amino acids in their cells. The present study demonstrated: (i) Na+ gradient-dependent L-glutamate and L-aspartate transport in the high K+ and low K+ red cells were dominated by a saturable component obeying Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Although no difference of the Km values was observed between the high K+ and low K+ cells, the Vmax values for both amino acids' transport in the high K+ cells were about three times those of low ones. (ii) L- and D-aspartate, but not D-glutamate, competitively inhibited L-glutamate transport in both types of the cells. (iii) Ouabain decreased the uptake of the amino acids in the high K+ dog red cells, whereas it was not effective on those in the low K+ cells. (iv) The ATP-treated high K+ cells [(K+]i not equal to [K+]o, [Na+]i greater than [Na+]o) showed a marked decrease of both amino acids' uptake rate, which was almost the same as that of the low K+ cells. (v) Valinomycin stimulated the amino acids' transport in both of the high K+ and the ATP-treated low K+ cells [( K+]i greater than [K+]o, [Na+]o), suggesting that the transport system of L-glutamate and L-aspartate in both types of the cells might be electrogenic. These results indicate that the increased transport activity in the high K+ dog red cells was a secondary consequence of the Na+ concentration gradient created by (Na+, K+)-ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1505700963,"High levels of both glutamine synthetase and a unique L-glutamine- and N-acetyl-L-glutamate-dependent carbamoyl phosphate synthetase are present in the mitochondria in livers of marine urea-retaining elasmobranchs (Casey, C. A., and Anderson, P. M. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 8449-8453). On the basis of these observations it has been suggested that in these species carbamoyl phosphate and, consequently, one of the nitrogen atoms of citrulline and, ultimately, urea, are derived directly from glutamine rather than from ammonia as occurs in mammalian ureotelic species. The purpose of this study was to obtain evidence for this role of glutamine. Isolated hepatic mitochondria from Squalus acanthias incubated with ammonia plus glutamate, ornithine, bicarbonate, inorganic phosphate, and succinate as an energy source were found to synthesize citrulline at a rate comparable to the rate of urea synthesis observed in vivo. Citrulline synthesis proceeds at maximal rates even when the ammonia concentration is as low as 0.05 mM and is stoichiometric with the amount of ammonia initially present. Synthesis from ammonia does proceed in the absence of glutamate, but a much higher concentration of ammonia (congruent to 4 mM) is required to achieve a half-maximal rate. Glutamine can substitute for ammonia plus glutamate as the nitrogen-donating substrate for citrulline synthesis. Selective inhibition of the glutamine-dependent activity of the carbamoyl phosphate synthetase in the isolated mitochondria completely inhibits the ability of the mitochondria to synthesize citrulline from glutamine or from ammonia plus glutamate, whereas selective inhibition of glutamine synthetase inhibits citrulline synthesis from ammonia plus glutamate, but not from glutamine. These observations provide direct evidence that ammonia assimilation for citrulline synthesis (and, therefore, urea synthesis) in these species involves intermediate formation of glutamine."
https://openalex.org/W1582094735,"Incubation of photolyzed bovine rod outer segment (ROS) membranes with pertussis toxin led to an inhibition of GTPase activity in an NAD-dependent reaction. In the presence of [32P]NAD, pertussis toxin catalyzed the [32P]ADP-ribosylation of a 39-kDa ROS protein and the 39-kDa alpha-subunit of transducin purified from ROS membranes. The decrease in GTPase activity was paralleled by an increase in the extent of [32P]ADP-ribosylation of the 39-kDa ROS protein. [32P]ADP-ribosylation of the 39-kDa protein occurred in both photolyzed and dark ROS membranes. Neither ATP nor guanylyl imidodiphosphate were required for either ADP-ribosylation or inhibition of GTPase. It was demonstrated previously that choleragen catalyzed the NAD-dependent inhibition of ROS GTPase (Abood, M. E., Hurley, J. B., Pappone, M-C., Bourne, H. R., and Stryer, L. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 10540-10543). Choleragen-catalyzed inhibition of GTPase and [32P]ADP-ribosylation of the 39-kDa protein required guanylyl imidodiphosphate and did not occur in dark ROS membranes. The effects of choleragen and pertussis toxin were not additive. Incubation of ROS with choleragen or pertussis toxin prevented the subsequent [32P]ADP-ribosylation by the homologous but not the heterologous toxin, consistent with the hypothesis that the two toxins act at different sites on the 39-kDa protein. Pertussis toxin is known to ADP-ribosylate the inhibitory guanine nucleotide-binding subunit of adenylate cyclase (Ni) but not the stimulatory subunit (Ns); choleragen is known to ADP-ribosylate Ns but not Ni. Since both toxins ADP-ribosylate the same subunit of transducin, it appears that this protein may possess characteristics of both Ns and Ni."

https://openalex.org/W1533193661,"gamma-Glutamyl transpeptidase consists of two polypeptide chains anchored to the kidney brush-border membrane only through a short hydrophobic domain near the NH2-terminal end of the heavy subunit. The two subunits were reported to derive from a single polypeptide precursor by tissue labeling experiments. We have investigated the first steps of GGT biosynthesis and processing in a cell-free system. mRNA was prepared from kidney and enriched in specific sequences by a preparative gel electrophoresis. In vitro translation resulted in the synthesis of a single polypeptide (Mr = 63,000) specifically immunoprecipitated by antibodies raised against the mature dimeric enzyme. Incubation with microsomal membranes resulted in the appearance of a glycosylated form of the propeptide (Mr = 78,000). This latter form was cotranslationally segregated into microsomes and was sensitive to endoglycosidase H. Purified Escherichia coli leader peptidase did not process the primary gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase chain. This ectoprotein therefore appears to be inserted in the phospholipid bilayer without cleavage of a signal peptide, similar to most integral membrane proteins so far studied."
https://openalex.org/W185231612,"Lophotoxin, a cyclic diterpenoid isolated from coral, irreversibly inactivates the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor on intact BC3H-1 cells. Inactivation can be prevented by simultaneous incubation of lophotoxin with nicotinic agonists and competitive antagonists but not by noncompetitive antagonists such as dibucaine. Analysis of lophotoxin inhibition of carbamylcholine-elicited 22Na+ permeability, KG/KGmax, in relation to the number of sites blocked, y, reveals a function showing greater curvature than the parabolic function kG/kGmax = (1 - y)2 found for cobra alpha-toxin inhibition of 22Na+ permeability. This relationship is consistent with lophotoxin not binding randomly to the two primary agonist-antagonist sites but rather exhibiting a preference for one of the two sites. Binding of lophotoxin to a single site per receptor oligomer is sufficient to render the receptor nonfunctional. A comparison of the concentration dependencies for occupation by competitive antagonists reveals a shift to lower antagonist concentrations and an increase in Hill coefficient to approach unity after partial occupation by lophotoxin. Competitive antagonists are known to bind to two sites of unequal affinity on the receptor, and the preferential site of lophotoxin inactivation is the site of lower affinity for the competitive antagonists. In the case of agonists fractional inactivation of sites by lophotoxin results in a loss of the positive cooperativity and a shift of the concentration dependence for carbamylcholine binding to higher agonist concentrations. Similar behavior is observed for cobra alpha-toxin inactivation, but a comparison of concentration dependencies for agonist binding following partial occupation by lophotoxin and cobra alpha-toxin reveals that lophotoxin blockade yields residual sites with a lower affinity and Hill coefficients for agonists closer to unity. These shifts in agonist and antagonist binding profiles are also in accord with preferential inactivation of one of the two agonist sites by lophotoxin. The findings indicate that the site of lower affinity for antagonists may possess the higher affinity for agonists."
https://openalex.org/W1503573288,"The 20,000-dalton light chain of myosin from chicken gizzard has been shown to be phosphorylated in a Ca2+ and calmodulin-independent manner by the activated form of a protease-activated kinase from rabbit reticulocytes. Protease-activated kinase I incorporates phosphate stoichiometrically into the phosphorylatable light chain (P-light chain) in isolated myosin light chains and in actomyosin. The same serine residue appears to be phosphorylated by the protease-activated kinase and the Ca2+-dependent myosin light chain kinase. This conclusion is based on results from two-dimensional peptide maps of chymotryptic and tryptic digests of the phosphorylated P-light chain and from phosphoamino acid analysis of acid hydrolysates. Phosphorylation of the P-light chain by the proteolytically activated protein kinase stimulates the actin-activated Mg-ATPase activity of myosin in the absence of Ca2+. The extent of stimulation of the ATPase activity is similar to that observed upon phosphorylation of actomyosin by the Ca2+-dependent myosin light chain kinase. A proteolytically activated protein kinase with chromatographic properties and substrate specificity similar to protease-activated kinase I from reticulocytes has also been identified in gizzard. Protease-activated kinase I has been shown to be distinct from the Ca2+-dependent myosin light chain kinase by the mode of activation and specificity with other substrates, including phosphorylation of a unique site on myosin P-light chain from skeletal muscle (Tuazon, P. T., Stull, J. T., and Traugh, J. A. (1982) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 108, 910-917)."
https://openalex.org/W1525173771,"We have reported previously that insulin causes a complete but reversible desensitization to insulin action in rat hepatoma HTC cells in tissue culture, and that this insulin resistance is mediated by postbinding mechanisms rather than receptor down-regulation (Heaton, J. H., and Gelehrter, T. D. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 12257-12262). We report here that insulin causes a similar desensitization to the induction of tyrosine aminotransferase by the insulin-like growth factors IGF-I and IGF-II isolated from human plasma, and by multiplication-stimulating activity, the rat homologue of IGF-II. The results of both competition-binding studies and affinity cross-linking experiments indicate that insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) bind primarily to IGF receptors rather than to insulin receptors. The low concentrations at which these factors induce transaminase is consistent with their acting primarily via IGF receptors. This is confirmed by experiments utilizing anti-insulin receptor antibody which both inhibits 125I-insulin binding and shifts the concentration dependence of insulin induction of tyrosine aminotransferase to the right. This same immunoglobulin does not inhibit 125I-multiplication-stimulating activity binding and only minimally inhibits 125I-IGF-I binding. Anti-insulin receptor antibody also does not significantly shift the concentration dependence for the IGFs, suggesting that IGFs induce transaminase by acting via IGF receptors. Although insulin down regulates insulin receptors, it does not decrease IGF-I or IGF-II binding. We conclude that insulin causes desensitization of HTC cells to IGFs by affecting a postbinding step in IGF action, which may be common to the actions of both insulin and insulin-like growth factors."
https://openalex.org/W1559797399,"Yeast inorganic pyrophosphatase was found to bind two Mn2+ per subunit in the absence of phosphate and three Mn2+ per subunit in the presence of phosphate. Kinetic studies of the pyrophosphatase-catalyzed hydrolysis of Cr(NH3)4PP and Cr(H2O)4PP were carried out with Mn2+ and with Mg2+ as activators. The results from these studies suggest that three divalent cations per pyrophosphatase active site are required for catalysis. NMR and EPR studies were conducted to evaluate the relative location of the metal ion binding sites on the enzyme. The two Mn2+ ions bound to the free enzyme are in close enough proximity to magnetically interact. Analysis of the NMR and EPR data in terms of a dipolar relaxation mechanism between Mn2+ ions provides an estimate of the distance between them of 10-14 A. When the diamagnetic substrate analog [Co(NH3)4PNP]- or intermediate analog [Co(NH3)4 (P)2]- are bound to pyrophosphatase, two Mn2+ ions still bind to the enzyme and their magnetic interaction increases. In the presence of these Co3+ complexes, the Mn2+–Mn2+ separation decreases to 7-9 A. Several NMR and EPR experiments were conducted at low Mn2+ to pyrophosphatase ratios (approximately 0.3), where only one Mn2+ ion binds per subunit, in the presence of Cr3+ or Co3+ complexes of PNP or PP. Analysis of the Mn2+–Cr3+ dipolar relaxation evident in proton NMR and EPR data provided for the calculation of Mn2+–Cr3+ distances. When the substrate analog CrPNP was present, the Mn2+–Cr3+ distance was congruent to 7 A whereas, when Cr(P)2 was bound to pyrophosphatase, the Mn2+–Cr3+ distance was congruent to 5 A. These results strongly support a model for the catalytic site of pyrophosphatase that involves three metal ion cofactors."
https://openalex.org/W1479818961,"Lysyl oxidase initiates the covalent cross-linking of elastin and collagen, converting lysyl residues in these proteins to peptidyl aldehyde residues. The present study explored structural and electron withdrawing features required to generate mechanism-based inhibitors of this enzyme with antifibrotic potential. It was found that the electron withdrawing nitrile moiety of beta-aminopropionitrile (BAPN), a naturally occurring syncatalytic inhibitor of lysyl oxidase, can be replaced by chlorine, bromine, or the nitro function to yield 2-haloamines or nitroethylamine compounds which also act as mechanism-based irreversible inhibitors of this enzyme. BAPN and 2-bromo- and 2-chloroethylamine exhibit similar KI values of 6-10 microM. However, the enzyme becomes irreversibly inactivated significantly faster by either of the 2-haloamines than by BAPN. 2-Nitroethylamine has by far the poorest affinity for the enzyme and inactivates much more slowly than the other amines of this series, consistent with interference with optimal enzyme-inhibitor interactions by the anionic nitro group. Unlike BAPN, 2-bromoethylamine is processed to a detectable aldehyde product upon incubation with enzyme, showing a partition ratio of 1.2 mol of acetaldehyde formed per mol of 2-bromo-ethylamine which becomes covalently incorporated in the enzyme. The results are consistent with the processing of 2-bromo-ethylamine to an enzyme-ethyleneamine Schiff base subject to hydrolysis to acetaldehyde or to covalent attack at carbon 2 by an enzyme nucleophile. Thus, beta-haloamines represent a new series of suicide inhibitors of lysyl oxidase which can inactivate the enzyme faster than BAPN and hence may have antifibrotic potential."
https://openalex.org/W1660956113,"Citrate transport in Salmonella typhimurium involves inducible periplasmic components. Two forms of a tricarboxylate-binding protein, C1 and C2, were isolated, in high yield, from the periplasm of a cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase mutant. These immunologically cross-reactive Mr = 29,000 proteins were crystallized using ammonium sulfate. CD measurements indicated considerable secondary structure: 24% a helix, and 12% beta structure. The amino acid compositions of C1 and C2 were identical. The NH2-terminal sequence of C1 was determined; C2 was found to have a blocked NH2 terminus (pyroglutamate). C1 and C2 are products of the same gene (Somers, J. M., and Kay, W. W. (1983) Mol. Gen. Genet. 190, 20-26). C1 and C2 bound a variety of citrate analogues and organic acids, with a predominant specificity for tricarboxylates (citrate KD 1.4 X 10(-7) M), and both required a deprotonated central carboxyl group for binding. Citrate was not bound to C protein as either a salt or metal ion complex."

These loci can also function as complementary strand origins of DNA replication in a single-stranded circular leads to replicative form pathway whose protein requirements are characteristic of phi X174 DNA. Despite this functional similarity, these three sites possess no extensive sequence homology. To uncover a possible common structural determinant, factor Y recognition sequences were treated with pancreatic DNase or dimethyl sulfate in the presence and absence of this replication protein. When factor Y was present, the action of the nuclease was altered in a similar manner on each of the three templates, indicating that factor Y was bound to the entire length of its effector site. Factor Y-mediated modification of the dimethyl sulfate methylation patterns gave evidence of specific, tight protein-DNA contacts. Protection maps, devised by plotting the results of the methylation and footprinting experiments on duplex structures, suggest that tertiary interactions are either involved in the formation of a factor Y effector site or are induced by the binding of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1591250175,"Low concentrations of free Ca2+ stimulated the hydrolysis of ATP by plasma membrane vesicles purified from guinea pig neutrophils and incubated in 100 mM HEPES/triethanolamine, pH 7.25. In the absence of exogenous magnesium, apparent values obtained were 320 nM (EC50 for free Ca2+), 17.7 nmol of Pi/mg X min (Vmax), and 26 microM (Km for total ATP). Studies using trans- 1,2-diaminocyclohexane- N,N,N',N',-tetraacetic acid as a chelator showed this activity was dependent on 13 microM magnesium, endogenous to the medium plus membranes. Without added Mg2+, Ca2+ stimulated the hydrolysis of several other nucleotides: ATP congruent to GTP congruent to CTP congruent to ITP greater than UTP, but Ca2+-stimulated ATPase was not coupled to uptake of Ca2+, even in the presence of 5 mM oxalate. When 1 mM MgCl2 was added, the vesicles demonstrated oxalate and ATP-dependent calcium uptake at approximately 8 nmol of Ca2+/mg X min (based on total membrane protein). Ca2+ uptake increased to a maximum of approximately 17-20 nmol of Ca2+/mg X min when KCl replaced HEPES/triethanolamine in the buffer. In the presence of both KCl and MgCl2, Ca2+ stimulated the hydrolysis of ATP selectively over other nucleotides. Apparent values obtained for the Ca2+-stimulated ATPase were 440 nM (EC50 for free Ca2+), 17.5 nmol Pi/mg X min (Vmax) and 100 microM (Km for total ATP). Similar values were found for Ca2+ uptake which was coupled efficiently to Ca2+-stimulated ATPase with a molar ratio of 2.1 +/- 0.1. Exogenous calmodulin had no effect on the Vmax or EC50 for free Ca2+ of the Ca2+-stimulated ATPase, either in the presence or absence of added Mg2+, with or without an ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N',-tetraacetic acid pretreatment of the vesicles. The data demonstrate that calcium stimulates ATP hydrolysis by neutrophil plasma membranes that is coupled optimally to transport of Ca2+ in the presence of concentrations of K+ and Mg2+ that appear to mimic intracellular levels."
https://openalex.org/W1604516674,"Guanylate cyclase was activated 3- to 10-fold by hemin in a dose-dependent manner in membranes prepared from homogenates of rat lung, C6 rat glioma cells, or B103 rat neuroblastoma cells. Maximum activation was observed with 50 to 100 microM hemin with higher concentrations being inhibitory. Activation was observed when Mg2+-GTP but not when Mn2+-GTP was used as the substrate. Increased enzyme activity reflected selective activation of the particulate form of guanylate cyclase; hemin inhibited the soluble form of guanylate cyclase 70 to 90% over a wide range of concentrations. Activation was not secondary to proteolysis since a variety of protease inhibitors failed to alter stimulation by hemin. Protophorphyrin IX had little effect on particulate guanylate cyclase activity and sodium borohydride almost completely abolished hemin-dependent activation. These data suggest a requirement for the ferric form of the porphyrin-metal chelate for activation. However, agents which interact with the iron nucleus of porphyrins, such as cyanide, had little effect on the ability of hemin to activate guanylate cyclase. The stimulatory effects of hemin were observed in the presence of detergents such as Lubrol-PX, and highly purified particulate enzyme could be activated to the same extent as enzyme in native membranes. These data suggest that the interaction of porphyrins with particulate guanylate cyclase is complex in nature and different from that with the soluble enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1538275714,"Abstract In order to study whether hormone-sensitive tyrosine aminotransferase exists in tissues other than liver, we have devised means to separate the liver-specific enzyme from other enzymes that transaminate tyrosine and to distinguish between the authentic enzyme and the principal pseudotyrosine aminotransferases, which are the isoenzymes of aspartate aminotransferase. We accomplish this by suppressing proteolysis of the authentic enzyme using a buffer of pH 8.0 containing 0.1 M potassium chloride; enzyme extracted from liver in this buffer migrates as a single peak during chromatography on hydroxylapatite and represents the undegraded native form. A much smaller peak of tyrosine aminotransferase activity elutes at higher ionic strength and corresponds to a mixture of mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase and partially degraded tyrosine aminotransferase. Cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase, in contrast, adsorbs weakly to the hydroxylapatite column and transaminates tyrosine very poorly although it readily utilizes monoiodotyrosine. The aspartate aminotransferase isoenzymes separate completely from tyrosine aminotransferase during chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B. By combining these techniques with the use of specific antibodies, we show that brain, heart, and kidney do not contain tyrosine aminotransferase. Furthermore, we locate both isoenzymes of aspartate aminotransferase on polyacrylamide gels and show that both react histochemically as tyrosine aminotransferases when monoiodotyrosine is used as substrate. Use of these techniques, therefore, permits unambiguous identification of tyrosine aminotransferase and its separation from the background of nonspecific transamination."

At very low concentrations of 3-phenylpyruvate, L-glutamine was an effective amino group donor. The aminotransferase activities for the aliphatic ketomonocarboxylic acids, pyruvate and 2-ketoisovalerate, were lower in B-cell mitochondria. High rates of transamination of 2-ketoisocaproate with L-glutamine were observed and may be an important prerequisite for the insulin secretory potency of this 2-keto acid. Since B-cell mitochondria are well supplied with L-glutamine and L-glutamate, 3-phenylpyruvate-induced 2-ketoglutarate production may explain the insulin secretory potency of 3-phenylpyruvate which is not a fuel for pancreatic islet cells."

Both enzymes are active with RNA and DNA but are most active with RNA. The most abundant enzyme, ATPase I, is a microheterogeneous, monomeric protein that consists of at least three forms with apparent molecular weights from 53,000 to 60,000. It specifically catalyzes the hydrolysis of ATP (or dATP) to ADP (or dADP) and Pi in the presence of Mg2+ ions and nucleic acid cofactor and has a Km for ATP of 0.15 mM. The other enzyme, ATPase II, consists of a single protein with an apparent molecular weight of 37,000. It catalyzes the hydrolysis of all 4 ribonucleoside triphosphates and dATP to the corresponding nucleoside diphosphate and Pi. For both enzymes, nuclear ribonucleoprotein RNA and cytoplasmic poly(A+) RNA are particularly effective cofactors, while total polysomal RNA (primarily rRNA) is a poor cofactor.

It has also been observed to cause a rapid profound loss of tyrosine aminotransferase activity in H35 cells well before the onset of any measurable cytotoxicity. The effect is both time and concentration dependent. MeSno does not acutely inhibit synthesis of the enzyme as evidenced by the ability of glucocorticoids or cAMP analogs to induce the enzyme to the same extent in the presence or absence of the drug. The enzyme in extracts of cells treated with the drug is essentially identical with the enzyme from extracts of control cells in terms of thermal stability, immunoprecipitability, and affinities for substrates and cofactor. Addition of MeSno to cell extracts and mixing experiments suggests that the thiopurine does not have any direct effect on enzyme activity. Immunochemical analysis of the rates of synthesis and degradation of the aminotransferase have shown that the enzyme is degraded approximately 3-4 times more rapidly in cells treated with the drug than in control cells. At the same time there is no inhibition of the rate of synthesis of the enzyme."
