https://openalex.org/W1985170971,"High density lipoprotein (HDL) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) are cholesterol transport particles whose plasma concentrations are directly (LDL) and inversely (HDL) correlated with risk for atherosclerosis. LDL catabolism involves cellular uptake and degradation of the entire particle by a well-characterized receptor. HDL, in contrast, selectively delivers its cholesterol, but not protein, to cells by unknown receptors. Here it is shown that the class B scavenger receptor SR-BI is an HDL receptor. SR-BI binds HDL with high affinity, is expressed primarily in liver and nonplacental steroidogenic tissues, and mediates selective cholesterol uptake by a mechanism distinct from the classic LDL receptor pathway."

Extension from an immunoreactive complementary DNA clone yielded the entire genome (9392 nucleotides) encoding a polyprotein of 2873 amino acids. The virus is closely related to GB virus C (GBV-C) and distantly related to hepatitis C virus, GBV-A, and GBV-B. HGV was associated with acute and chronic hepatitis. Persistent viremia was detected for up to 9 years in patients with hepatitis. The virus is transfusion-transmissible. It has a global distribution and is present within the volunteer blood donor population in the United States."

https://openalex.org/W2077569218,"The CD44 family of surface receptors regulates adhesion, movement, and activation of normal and neoplastic cells. The cytokine osteopontin (Eta-1), which regulates similar cellular functions, was found to be a protein ligand of CD44. Osteopontin induces cellular chemotaxis but not homotypic aggregation, whereas the inverse is true for the interaction between CD44 and a carbohydrate ligand, hyaluronate. The different responses of cells after CD44 ligation by either osteopontin or hyaluronate may account for the independent effects of CD44 on cell migration and growth. This mechanism may also be exploited by tumor cells to promote metastasis formation."

https://openalex.org/W2053712580,"A subset of individuals with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS) possesses dominantly inherited mutations in the gene that encodes copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD). A4V and G93A, two of the mutant enzymes associated with FALS, were shown to catalyze the oxidation of a model substrate (spin trap 5,5'-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide) by hydrogen peroxide at a higher rate than that seen with the wild-type enzyme. Catalysis of this reaction by A4V and G93A was more sensitive to inhibition by the copper chelators diethyldithiocarbamate and penicillamine than was catalysis by wild-type CuZnSOD. The same two chelators reversed the apoptosis-inducing effect of mutant enzymes expressed in a neural cell line. These results suggest that oxidative reactions catalyzed by mutant CuZnSOD enzymes initiate the neuropathologic changes in FALS."
https://openalex.org/W2087530582,"Canine distemper virus (CDV) is thought to have caused several fatal epidemics in canids within the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem of East Africa, affecting silver-backed jackals (Canis mesomelas) and bat-eared foxes (Otocyon megalotis) in 1978 (ref. 1), and African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) in 1991 (refs 2, 3). The large, closely monitored Serengeti lion population was not affected in these epidemics. However, an epidemic caused by a morbillivirus closely related to CDV emerged abruptly in the lion population of the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, in early 1994, resulting in fatal neurological disease characterized by grand mal seizures and myoclonus; the lions that died had encephalitis and pneumonia. Here we report the identification of CDV from these lions, and the close phylogenetic relationship between CDV isolates from lions and domestic dogs. By August 1994, 85% of the Serengeti lion population had anti-CDV antibodies, and the epidemic spread north to lions in the Maasai Mara National reserve, Kenya, and uncounted hyaenas, bat-eared foxes, and leopards were also affected."
https://openalex.org/W2085186575,"KIDNEY stones (nephrolithiasis), which affect 12% of males and 5% of females in the western world, are familial in 45% of patients1,2 and are most commonly associated with hypercalciuria1. Three disorders of hypercalciuric nephrolithiasis (Dent's disease3, X-linked recessive nephrolithiasis (XRN)4, and X-linked recessive hypophosphataemic rickets (XLRH)5) have been mapped to Xpll.22 (refs 5–7). A microdeletion6 in one Dent's disease kindred allowed the identification of a candidate gene,CLCN5 (refs 8,9) which encodes a putative renal chloride channel. Here we report the investigation of 11 kindreds with these renal tubular disorders for CLCN5 abnormalities; this identified three nonsense, four missense and two donor splice site mutations, together with one intragenic deletion and one micro-deletion encompassing the entire gene. Heterologous expression of wild-type CLCN5 in Xenopus oocytes yielded outwardly rectifying chloride currents, which were either abolished or markedly reduced by the mutations. The common aetiology for Dent's disease, XRN and XLRH indicates that CLCN5 may be involved in other renal tubular disorders associated with kidney stones."
https://openalex.org/W2025247587,"Phosphorylation of the transcription factor CREB is thought to be important in processes underlying long-term memory. It is unclear whether CREB phosphorylation can carry information about the sign of changes in synaptic strength, whether CREB pathways are equally activated in neurons receiving or providing synaptic input, or how synapse-to-nucleus communication is mediated. We found that Ca2+-dependent nuclear CREB phosphorylation was rapidly evoked by synaptic stimuli including, but not limited to, those that induced potentiation and depression of synaptic strength. In striking contrast, high frequency action potential firing alone failed to trigger CREB phosphorylation. Activation of a submembranous Ca2+ sensor, just beneath sites of Ca2+ entry, appears critical for triggering nuclear CREB phosphorylation via calmodulin and a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2020694953,"It has been known for over 45 years that electrical stimulation of the midbrain reticular formation and of the thalamic intralaminar nuclei of the brain alerts animals. However, lesions of these sectors fail to impair arousal and vigilance in some cases, making the role of the ascending activating reticular system controversial. Here, a positron emission tomographic study showed activation of the midbrain reticular formation and of thalamic intralaminar nuclei when human participants went from a relaxed awake state to an attention-demanding reaction-time task. These results confirm the role of these areas of the brain and brainstem in arousal and vigilance."
https://openalex.org/W2087122819,"Voltage-dependent movement of a sodium channel S4 segment was examined by cysteine scanning mutagenesis and testing accessibility of the residues to hydrophilic cysteine-modifying reagents. These experiments indicate that 2 charged S4 residues move completely from an internally accessible to an externally accessible location in response to depolarization by passage through a short ""channel"" in the protein. The energetic problems of S4 movement have thus been solved in the same way that may ion channels achieve highly selective and rapid ion permeation through an open pore, by restricting the contact region between the permion and its channel."

https://openalex.org/W1970473208,"Amino acid sequence data from 57 different enzymes were used to determine the divergence times of the major biological groupings. Deuterostomes and protostomes split about 670 million years ago and plants, animals, and fungi last shared a common ancestor about a billion years ago. With regard to these protein sequences, plants are slightly more similar to animals than are the fungi. In contrast, phylogenetic analysis of the same sequences indicates that fungi and animals shared a common ancestor more recently than either did with plants, the greater difference resulting from the fungal lineage changing faster than the animal and plant lines over the last 965 million years. The major protist lineages have been changing at a somewhat faster rate than other eukaryotes and split off about 1230 million years ago. If the rate of change has been approximately constant, then prokaryotes and eukaryotes last shared a common ancestor about 2 billion years ago, archaebacterial sequences being measurably more similar to eukaryotic ones than are eubacterial ones."

https://openalex.org/W1981845572,"Two apoptosis-linked genes, named ALG-2 and ALG-3, were identified by means of a functional selection strategy. ALG-2 codes for a Ca(2+)-binding protein required for T cell receptor-, Fas-, and glucocorticoid-induced cell death. ALG-3, a partial complementary DNA that is homologous to the familial Alzheimer's disease gene STM2, rescues a T cell hybridoma from T cell receptor- and Fas-induced apoptosis. These findings suggest that ALG-2 may mediate Ca(2+)-regulated signals along the death pathway and that cell death may play a role in Alzheimer's disease."

We isolated the rates of Ca2+c clearance by several mechanisms using combinations of the following agents (with their expected targets): Li+ or TEA substituted for Na+ (Na+–Ca2+ exchange), 1 mM La3+ applied after the depolarization (Na+–Ca2+ exchange and plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase), 1 μM thapsigargin (pumping into reticular stores), and 2 μM carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (uptake into mitochondria). Remarkably, whenever [Ca2+]c rose above ∼500 nM, Ca2+c clearance by mitochondria exceeded clearance by either Na+–Ca2+ exchange or the Ca2+ pumps of the plasma and reticular membranes. As [Ca2+]c fell again, Ca2+ reemerged from mitochondria, prolonging the final return to basal levels."
https://openalex.org/W2036473961,"Netrins are laminin-related proteins that guide circumferential migrations on the ectoderm. To understand how netrin cues direct cell movements, we examined the expression of nematode netrin UNC-6 from embryo to adult. UNC-6 is expressed in 12 types of neuroglia and neurons, creating a hierarchy of netrin cues in the developing nervous system. Comparing gene expression pattern with in vivo phenotypes, we suggest how multiple netrin cues, each with a characteristic role, guide cells and axons during development. We also present the molecular analysis of selective loss-of-function and null alleles. The results indicate that the biological activities of netrins are mediated through distinct protein domains. Subtle mutations in domain VI can produce selective defects in both direction- and tissue-specific guidance. EGF-like module V-2 is essential for dorsal guidance activity; we infer this module is important for interactions between UNC-6 and the dorsal guidance receptor UNC-5."

https://openalex.org/W2013602955,"After infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the concentration of the virus in the person's plasma increases. The subsequent decrease in concentration a few weeks later was though to result from an HIV-specific immune response. This purported causal relation is investigated with a model of the dynamics of early HIV infection that incorporates no increase in the rate of removal of free virions or virus-infected cells. A pattern of changes in virus concentration similar to that observed in patients is predicted by the model. Thus, the reduction in virus concentration during acute infection may not reflect the ability of the HIV-specific immune response to control virus replication."
https://openalex.org/W2050088367,"The ribonucleoside triphosphate reductase (RTPR) from Lactobacillus leichmannii catalyzes adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl)-dependent nucleotide reduction, as well as exchange of the 5' hydrogens of AdoCbl with solvent. A protein-based thiyl radical is proposed as an intermediate in both of these processes. In the presence of RTPR containing specifically deuterated cysteine residues, the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrum of an intermediate in the exchange reaction and the reduction reaction, trapped by rapid freeze quench techniques, exhibits narrowed hyperfine features relative to the corresponding unlabeled RTPR. The spectrum was interpreted to represent a thiyl radical coupled to cob(II)alamin. Another proposed intermediate, 5'-deoxyadenosine, was detected by rapid acid quench techniques. Similarities in mechanism between RTPR and the Escherichia coli ribonucleotide reductase suggest that both enzymes require a thiyl radical for catalysis."

https://openalex.org/W2010381820,"Despite the fact that complex saccharides play an important role in many biological recognition processes, molecular level descriptions of protein-carbohydrate interactions are sparse. The legume lectin concanavalin A (con A), from Canavalia ensiformis, specifically recognizes the trimannoside core of many complex glycans. We have determined the crystal structure of a con A-trimannoside complex at 2.3-Å resolution and now describe the trimannoside interaction with con A. All three sugar residues are in well defined difference electron density. The 1,6-linked mannose residue is bound at the previously reported monosaccharide binding site; the other two sugars bind in an extended cleft formed by residues Tyr-12, Pro-13, Asn-14, Thr-15, and Asp-16. Hydrogen bonds are formed between the protein and all three sugar residues. In particular, the 1,3-linked mannose residue makes a strong hydrogen bond with the main chain of the protein. In addition, a water molecule, which is conserved in other con A structures, plays an important role in anchoring the reducing sugar unit to the protein. The complex is further stabilized by van der Waals interactions. The structure provides a rationale for the high affinity of con A for N-linked glycans.

https://openalex.org/W2001056945,"The traditional view of the external granular layer of the cerebellar cortex giving rise to interneurons has been challenged by recent studies with quail-chick chimeras. To clarify the time and site of origins of interneurons, a retrovirus carrying the β-galactosidase gene was injected into the deep cerebellar tissue or external granular layer of postnatal day 4/5 rats to label dividing progenitors. After deep cerebellar tissue injection, unipolar cells were found initially in white matter at 2 days postinjection and subsequently in the internal granule and molecular layers 4–6 days postinjection. Morphologically defined basket, stellate, and Golgi neurons were clearly identified by 20 days postinjection. In contrast, retroviral labeling of cells in the external granular layer produced only granule neurons in the internal granule layer. Thus, dividing progenitors in the cerebellar white matter migrate through the white matter into the cortex before differentiating into a variety of cortical interneurons."
https://openalex.org/W1973602059,"The current model of serine protease diversity theorizes that the earliest protease molecules were simple digestive enzymes that gained complex regulatory functions and restricted substrate specificities through evolution. Among the chymase group of serine proteases are enzymes that convert angiotensin I to angiotensin II, as well as others that simply degrade angiotensins. An ancestral chymase reconstructed with the use of phylogenetic inference, total gene synthesis, and protein expression had efficient and specific angiotensin II-forming activity (turnover number, about 700 per second). Thus, angiotensin II-forming activity is the more primitive state for chymases, and the loss of such activity occurred later in the evolution of some of these serine proteases."
https://openalex.org/W2063996715,"L-type Ca2+ channels are characterized by their unique sensitivity to organic Ca2+ channel modulators like the 1,4-dihydropyridines (DHPs). To identify molecular motifs mediating DHP sensitivity, we transferred this sensitivity from L-type Ca2+ channels to the DHP- insensitive class A brain Ca2+ channel, BI-2. Expression of chimeras revealed minimum sequence stretches conferring DHP sensitivity including segments IIIS5, IIIS6, and the connecting linker, as well as the IVS5–IVS6 linker plus segment IVS6. DHP agonist and antagonist effects are determined by different regions within the repeat IV motif. Sequence regions responsible for DHP sensitivity comprise only 9.4% of the overall primary structure of a DHP-sensitive α1A/α1S construct. This chimera fully exhibits the DHP sensitivity of channels formed by L-type α1 subunits. In addition, it displays the electrophysiological properties of α1A, as well as its sensitivity toward the peptide toxins ω-agatoxin IVA and ω-conotoxin MVIIC."
https://openalex.org/W2036923572,"Complex effects of altering intracellular [Ca2+] on M-type K+ currents have previously been reported using whole-cell current recording. To study the direct effect of Ca2+ on M-channel activity, we have applied Ca2+ to the inside face of membrane patches excised from rat superior cervical sympathetic ganglion cells. Ca2+ rapidly and reversibly inhibited M-channel activity in 28/44 patches by up to 87%, with a mean IC50 of 100 nM. This effect persisted in the absence of ATP, implying that it was not due to phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. A similar effect was observed in 13/13 cell-attached patches when cells were transiently “Ca2+-loaded” by adding 2 mM Ca2+ to a 25 mM K+ solution bathing the extrapatch cell membrane. These observations provide new evidence that Ca2+ can directly inhibit M channels, so supporting the view that Ca2+ might mediate M current inhibition following muscarinic receptor activation."
https://openalex.org/W2039322570,"Charybdotoxin, a peptide neurotoxin of known molecular structure, blocks Shaker K+ channels by binding to a receptor at the outer opening of the ion conduction pathway. Analysis of variants of CTX at position 29 and of Shaker at position 449 shows that these two residues interact closely in the channel–toxin complex. The CTX mutation M29I leads to a slight strengthening of block when tested on Shaker-449T; the same CTX mutation weakens block 1700-fold when tested on Shaker-449F. The known position of CTX-29 on the toxin's interaction surface thus locates Shaker-449 within 5 Å of the pore axis of the closed channel. All four subunits must carry the 449F mutation to produce a highly toxin-insensitive channel."

Here we report that scattered en expression, caused by retroviral gene transfer, perturbed the retinotopic order. Nasal retinal fibers, which normally recognize the caudal side of the tectum (strong en expression side) as a target, arborized at ectopic sites, as if they found their targets, or degenerated. Temporal retinal fibers, which normally recognize the rostral side of the tectum (weak en expression side) as a target, were also affected in some cases by degeneration or prevention of innervation in the tectum. These results suggest that gradient en expression defines the positional identity of the tectum along the rostrocaudal axis."
https://openalex.org/W2089338912,"In voltage-gated ion channels and in the homologous cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels, the loop between the S5 and S6 transmembrane segments (P region) is thought to form the lining of the pore. To investigate the structure and the role in gating of the P region of the bovine retinal CNG channel, we determined the accessibility of 11 cysteine-substituted P region residues to small, charged sulfhydryl reagents applied to the inside and outside of membrane patches in the open and closed states of the channel. The results suggest that the P region forms a loop that extends toward the central axis of the channel, analogous to the L3 loop of bacterial porin channels. Furthermore, the P region, in addition to forming the ion selectivity filter, functions as the channel gate, the structure of which changes when the channel opens."
https://openalex.org/W2055672024,"Exocytosis and the ensuing rapid endocytosis in adrenal chromaffin cells are both Ca(2+)-dependent phenomena but differ in their divalent cation specificity, implying distinct Ca2+ receptors for the two processes. To ascertain whether calmodulin is the Ca2+ receptor for either process, we blocked its function by introducing calmodulin-binding peptides or anti-calmodulin antibodies into these cells. Exo/endocytosis was followed by measurement of cell membrane capacitance. Rapid endocytosis, but not exocytosis, was abolished by these treatments, indicating that calmodulin is the Ca2+ receptor for rapid endocytosis but is not involved in exocytosis. The principal calmodulin target is not protein phosphatase-2B, as antagonism of this enzyme did not inhibit but accelerated rapid endocytosis. Calmodulin may thus regulate both the rate and extent of rapid endocytosis by distinct pathways."

Ballou L.M. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 1994; 79: 81-91Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Activation of p70S6k in response to mitogens is associated with phosphorylation of three serines and one threonine located at the carboxyl terminus of the kinase(21Ferrari S. Bannwarth W. Morley S. Totty N. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7282-7286Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). p70S6kalso contains additional phosphate groups that become dephosphorylated upon rapamycin treatment, leading to inactivation of p70S6k(22Ferrari S.

Each set of phosphorylation sites might be modified by distinct kinases; however, direct activators of p70S6k/p85S6kare so far unknown. Recent experiments based on the use of rapamycin (23Kunz J.

Blenis J. Nature. 1994; 370: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar) have suggested that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and the structurally related enzyme RAFT/FRAP are involved in upstream signaling to p70S6k/p85S6k. Two lines of evidence have suggested that the function of p70S6k/p85S6k during G1 is important for cell cycle progression. First, inhibition of p70S6k/p85S6k by treatment of cells with rapamycin leads to cell cycle arrest in G1 or a delay of entry into S phase, depending on the cell type(9Kuo C.J. Chung J. Fiorentino D.F. Flanagan W.M. Blenis J. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 358: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 14Chung J. Kuo C.J. Crabtree G.R. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1227-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). Second, microinjection of rat embryo fibroblasts with antibodies that inhibit p70S6k/p85S6k abolishes the serum-induced entry into S phase(17Reinhard C. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J.C. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 28Lane H.A. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J.C. Thomas G. Nature. 1993; 363: 170-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Activation of p42mapk/p44mapk is also thought to be essential for triggering the proliferative response in fibroblasts(29Pagès G. Lenormand P. L'Allemain G. Chambard J.-C. Meloche S. Pouysségur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8319-8323Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). To gain further insight into how p70S6k/p85S6k and p42mapk/p44mapkactivity is regulated and what role the enzymes might have in cell growth and cell cycle control, we have examined the behavior of these enzymes during the cell cycle. We show here that p70S6k and p42mapk/p44mapk activities are regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Furthermore, we present evidence that the cell cycle regulation of p70S6k/p85S6kactivity might involve compartmentation and a regulatory mechanism that is independent of the four carboxyl-terminal phosphorylation sites. Finally, our observations of the behavior of p70S6k and p42mapk/p44mapk during the cell cycle suggest that there is cross-talk between these signaling molecules and the cell cycle machinery. Swiss mouse 3T3 fibroblasts were seeded in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS, Life Technologies, Inc.) at 1.3 × 105 cells per 10-cm plate or 3.0 × 105 cells per 15-cm plate and allowed to grow for 3 days. To synchronize cells in G0, cells were serum-starved in DMEM plus 0.5% FCS for 24-48 h. Then 5 nM epidermal growth factor (EGF), 1 nM insulin, and 6% FCS were added to induce re-entry into the cell cycle. Alternatively, 20% FCS was used as a mitogen. To arrest cells in metaphase, cells were first presynchronized in G0 by serum starvation and then stimulated with EGF, insulin, and FCS as described above. Nocodazole (0.4 μg/ml, Sigma) was added 20 h after release from G0, before cells entered M phase. Mitotic cells were collected 4 h later by gentle pipetting and were reseeded into DMEM plus 10% FCS at 0.5 × 106 cells per 10-cm plate. These conditions have been shown to result in an efficient and reversible M phase block that prevents cells from entering a polyploid state(30Nüsse M. Egner H.J. Cell Tissue Kinet. 1984; 17: 13-23PubMed Google Scholar). Mitotic cells were isolated without nocodazole by multiple rounds of mechanical shake-off alone (31Tobey R.A. Anderson E.C. Petersen D.F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1967; 70: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) from subconfluent plates of cells which were synchronized in G0 and stimulated for 22 h with mitogens as described above. Cells collected from early rounds were stored in DMEM plus 10% FCS at 4°C during the collection process. Plates (10 cm) were placed on ice and the cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 137 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl and 12 mM Pi, pH 7.4). Cells were scraped into 400 μl of cold extraction buffer (120 mM NaCl, 20 mM NaF, 1 mM benzamidine, 5 mM EGTA, 30 mM sodium PPi, 0.1% Triton X-100, 30 mM 4-nitrophenyl phosphate, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 50 mM Tris, and 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.2), homogenized with 6 strokes in a Teflon-glass homogenizer, and centrifuged at 4°C for 10 min at 8000 × g. The supernatants were stored at −70°C. Protein concentration in cell extract supernatants was determined by a Lowry method(32Peterson G.L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 95-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar). S6 kinase activity was measured using 40 S ribosomal subunits as substrate as described earlier(26Petritsch C. Woscholski R. Edelmann H.M.L. Parker P.J. Ballou L.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The reactions were stopped and the samples were subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and scintillation counting as described previously(33Ballou L.M. Jenö P. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1188-1194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A unit is defined as the amount of kinase incorporating 1 pmol of Pi into S6 per min. Polyclonal antibodies to a His-tagged fragment of rat p70S6k (amino acids 258-469; (4Kozma S.C. Ferrari S. Bassand P. Siegmann M. Totty N. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7365-7369Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar)) were produced and affinity purified as described previously(34Petritsch C. Woscholski R. Edelmann H.M.L. Ballou L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26619-26625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These purified antibodies show no cross-reaction with p90rsk on Western blots or in immunoprecipitation kinase assays (data not shown). For immunocomplex S6 kinase assays, Triton X-100 (to 1%), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (to 0.1 mM), and purified S6 kinase antibody (1 μl) were added to 50 μl of cell extract supernatant and kept on ice for 3 h. Then 25 μl of 50% (v/v) protein A-agarose (preincubated with 1% bovine serum albumin in extraction buffer plus 1% Triton X-100) was added and incubated for 1 h at 4°C. The beads were washed twice with extraction buffer plus 1% Triton X-100 and twice with S6 kinase assay buffer without dithiothreitol. The kinase assays were performed essentially as described above. Immunocomplex S6 kinase assays with hemagglutinin (HA) antibody 12CA5 (35Wilson I.A. Niman H.L. Houghten R.A. Cherenson A.R. Connolly M.L. Lerner A. Cell. 1984; 37: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) were performed essentially as described above except that cell extract supernatants containing 800 μg of protein were used per sample and more extensive washes of the beads were done. For MAP kinase immunocomplex assays, immunoprecipitations with antibody 122 against p42mapk were performed essentially as described above, except that the last two washes were done with MAP kinase assay buffer (30 mM Tris, pH 8, 20 mM MgCl2, 2 mM MnCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.1 mM dithiothreitol). MAP kinase assays were initiated by adding 15 μl of MAP kinase assay buffer containing 10 μM ATP, 2 μM of the peptide inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (Sigma), 10 μg of myelin basic protein (Sigma), and 0.33 μl [γ-32P]ATP. After 30 min at 37°C the reactions were stopped and the samples were subjected to electrophoresis on SDS-20% polyacrylamide gels, autoradiography and scintillation counting. Fibroblasts in 10-cm plates were trypsinized and collected by centrifugation. The cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed overnight in 70% ethanol. Before analysis, cells were washed twice with PBS and treated with RNase A at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml for 20 min. Cells were suspended in 500 μl of propidium iodide solution (40 μg/ml in PBS) and kept on ice until use. Data were collected and analyzed with a Becton Dickson FACScan and Lysis II software (Becton Dickson). Cells were fixed directly on tissue culture dishes for 20 min at room temperature with 3% paraformaldehyde (w/v) in PBS (pH 8.0) and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 min. Mitotic cells were allowed to adhere to adhesion slides (Bio-Rad; 5 min) and fixed as described above. Incubation with primary antibodies (affinity-purified anti-p70S6k antibody diluted 1:50 in PBS or anti-tubulin monoclonal YOL1/34 antibody diluted 1:500 in PBS) was performed overnight at room temperature. The secondary fluorescein-conjugated goat F(ab′)2 anti-rabbit Ig (G+L) (Tago, Inc.) was diluted 1:50 in PBS and incubated 4 h at room temperature in the dark. The secondary rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (H+L) (Jackson ImmunoResearch) was diluted 1:500 in PBS. Nuclei were counterstained with 0.5 μg/ml 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Fluorescence was visualized with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope equipped with a CCD camera. Images were processed with Gene Join and Photoshop programs. Proteins in cell extract supernatants (8 μg/sample) were separated on 15% polyacrylamide gels and electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose. The membranes were blocked with 5% dried milk in PBS, 0.5% Tween 20 and then incubated with either 1:1000 diluted affinity-purified antibody against p70S6k or 1:2000 diluted antibody against p42mapk/p44mapk (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). After several washes in PBS, 0.5% Tween 20, membranes were incubated with 1:5000 diluted horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Amersham) for 1 h. Detection of the immune signal was done using the ECL kit (Amersham). Mutant p70S6k was generated by replacing Ser → Asp (residues 411, 418, and 424) and Thr → Glu (residue 421) by the polymerase chain reaction. 2C. Kühne, unpublished data. Wild-type or mutant p70S6k cDNAs (nucleotides 137-1705; (4Kozma S.C. Ferrari S. Bassand P. Siegmann M. Totty N. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7365-7369Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar)) carrying the HA tag 5′ to the p70S6k sequence were inserted into the mammaliam expression vector pMV-7(36Kirschmeier P.T. Housey G.M. Johnson M.D. Perkins A.S. Weinstein I.B. DNA (N. Y.). 1988; 7: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The wild-type and mutant inserts were verified by nucleotide sequencing. pMV7+ wild-type S6 kinase, pMV7+ mutant S6 kinase, or vector alone were transfected into the packaging and virus-producing cell line GP+E 86 (37Markowitz D. Goff S. Bank A. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 1120-1124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using calcium phosphate precipitation. Neo+ clones were selected by growth in medium containing 1 mg/ml G418 (Geneticin, Life Technologies, Inc.); clones were visible 8-10 days after selection. Preparation of virus stocks and viral infection procedures were carried out essentially as described earlier(38Perkins A.S. Kirschmeier P.T. Gattoni-Celli S. Weinstein I.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 1123-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, Swiss mouse 3T3 fibroblasts were infected with culture fluid from the virus-producing cells in the presence of 8 μg/ml Polybrene. The medium was changed the following day and two days after infection cells were trypsinized and replated at a 1:3 dilution in G418 medium. Stable transfectants were obtained 1-2 weeks after replating. Most studies examining the regulation of p70S6k activity have focused on the first few hours after stimulation of G0-arrested cells. We examined the behavior of p70S6k over the course of one complete cell cycle to determine whether the enzyme is active at other times besides G1 and to compare its activity in G0/G1 and M/G1 cells. Subconfluent Swiss mouse 3T3 fibroblasts were synchronized in G0 by serum starvation and then induced to enter the cell cycle by adding FCS plus insulin and EGF. Under these conditions the cells traversed the first cell cycle with good synchrony (Fig. 1A). Analysis of cellular DNA content by flow cytometry showed that cells started to enter S phase synchronously after 16 h of stimulation and 4-6 h later 95% of the cells had doubled their DNA content. After 26-28 h of stimulation most of the cells had gone through M phase and reappeared as G1 cells with a 2 N content of DNA (Fig. 1A). Similar results were obtained using 20% FCS as a mitogen (data not shown). To measure p70S6k activity in extracts of synchronized cells, immunocomplex kinase assays were performed using 40 S ribosomal subunits as a substrate. In these experiments an antibody that recognizes both p70S6k and p85S6k was used. However, since p85S6k is much less abundant than p70S6k in these cells(17Reinhard C. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J.C. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), most of the activity measured in the immunocomplexes is contributed by p70S6k. p70S6k activity measured 20 min after mitogen stimulation was more than 20 times higher than the activity measured in serum-starved cells (Fig. 1B, closed circles). The kinase lost 40% of its activity by the end of G1 (Fig. 1B, 16 h), consistent with published data(28Lane H.A. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J.C. Thomas G. Nature. 1993; 363: 170-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). During S and G2 the activity continued to decrease, so that during M phase a relatively low level of activity was measured (Fig. 1B). It was shown earlier that p70S6k is activated at the first G2/M boundary during meiotic maturation of Xenopus laevis oocytes(39Lane H.A. Morley S.J. Dorée M. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1743-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, we saw no increase in p70S6k activity in fibroblasts cycling from G2 into M (Fig. 1B). As the nuclear transcription factor CREMτ has been shown to be phosphorylated by p70S6k(20de Groot R.P. Ballou L.M. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 1994; 79: 81-91Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), we also performed immunocomplex kinase assays with recombinant CREMτ protein as a substrate. The pattern of p70S6k activity toward CREMτ during the cell cycle was virtually identical to that seen toward S6 (data not shown). All evidence obtained so far indicates that p70S6k is activated by phosphorylation(21Ferrari S. Bannwarth W. Morley S. Totty N. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7282-7286Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 40Ballou L.M. Siegmann M. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7154-7158Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To determine if the gradual decrease in p70S6k activity observed in Fig. 1B could be due to dephosphorylation, the phosphorylation state of p70S6k was assessed by its appearance as multiple bands on Western blots. The active, phosphorylated form of p70S6k migrates more slowly in SDS-polyacrylamide gels than the dephosphorylated, inactive species (40Ballou L.M. Siegmann M. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7154-7158Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). After 20 min of stimulation the most highly phosphorylated form of p70S6k was detected (Fig. 1C, upper panel), which correlated to the highest S6 kinase activity (Fig. 1B, closed circles). The hyperphosphorylated form was seen throughout G1, and by the end of G1 partially dephosphorylated forms of the kinase appeared (Fig. 1C, upper panel). As p70S6k activity continued to decrease, the hypophosphorylated forms of the kinase became predominant. The Western analysis also showed that the amount of p70S6k protein remained constant during the cell cycle (Fig. 1C). Together, these data demonstrate that p70S6k activity is cell cycle regulated and that the changes in activity appear to be mediated by phosphorylation-dephosphorylation. In parallel to p70S6k, we also examined the cell cycle regulation of MAP kinases. Immunocomplex kinase assays showed that p42mapk was strongly but only transiently activated early in G0/G1 (Fig. 1B, open squares). During S and G2, p42mapk activity was at basal levels and during G2/M the kinase activity increased to a small extent. MAP kinases were also visualized on Western blots that were probed with an antibody that recognizes both p42mapk and p44mapk (Fig. 1C, lower panel). The mitogen-dependent activation of p42mapk/p44mapk was clearly seen as a shift of the proteins to the phosphorylated, more slowly migrating forms after 20 min of stimulation (Fig. 1C, lower panel). Phosphorylated species of p42mapk/p44mapk were also seen at 4 h but thereafter the dephosphorylated forms were predominant. Because p42mapk gives a relatively faint signal on Western blots, no up-shifted band that would represent active p42mapk was seen in G2/M extracts (Fig. 1C, lower panel). However, a minor upper band representing active p44mapk was visible at later stages in the cell cycle (Fig. 1C, lower panel). Because fibroblasts released from G0 were not well synchronized after completing the first cell cycle (Fig. 1A), a different synchronization method had to be used in order to study p70S6k in cells exiting mitosis and entering G1 of the next cell cycle. We explored several methods to obtain enriched populations of cells in G1/S or G2/M and the best results were obtained using a nocodazole-induced metaphase block (see “Materials and Methods”). The mitotic cells were collected and reseeded into drug-free medium to allow them to re-enter the cell cycle. Analysis by flow cytometry showed that 95% of the collected cells were in M phase (Fig. 2A, t = 0 h). Within 2 h after reseeding, 90% of the cells had gone through mitosis and entered G1 and after 12 h the cells started to enter S phase (Fig. 2A). In agreement with the data in Fig. 1B, immunocomplex kinase assays showed that the metaphase-arrested cells exhibited relatively low p70S6k activity (Fig. 2B, closed circles). When the cells progressed from M into G1 the activity increased more than 10-fold (Fig. 2B). Western analysis showed that the increase in activity was associated with an increase in phosphorylation of p70S6k and that the amount of expressed protein did not change (Fig. 2C, upper panel). p42mapk also became activated in G1 cells after release from nocodazole but the activity returned very rapidly to near-basal levels (Fig. 2B, open squares). Western analysis showed that p42mapk and p44mapk were phosphorylated 1.5 h after release from nocodazole and extensively dephosphorylated 3 h after release (Fig. 2C, lower panel). These results show that p70S6k and p42mapk/p44mapk are not only activated at the G0/G1 boundary, but also in fibroblasts cycling from M into G1 after release from a nocodazole block. One could argue that the low p70S6k activity measured in metaphase-arrested cells might be an artifact of nocodazole treatment. To exclude this possibility, we compared the amount of p70S6k activity in mitotic cells that were collected by shake-off with or without nocodazole treatment and found that there was no significant difference (Fig. 3A). In addition, there was no difference in kinase activity in the drug-treated or non-treated cells that were left on the plates after mitotic shake-off (Fig. 3A). We also tested whether nocodazole inhibits the stimulation of p70S6k in resting cells upon addition of EGF. Pretreatment of cells for 30 min with different concentrations of nocodazole did not significantly inhibit the EGF-induced activation of p70S6k (Fig. 3B). Thus, these control experiments show that the low p70S6k activity measured in nocodazole-treated cells in Fig. 2B is not an artifact of drug treatment. Additional control experiments were performed to determine whether kinase activation might be due to withdrawal of nocodazole rather than to a specific cell cycle change. Removal of nocodazole from cycling cells, resting cells, or cells in S phase after 4 h of treatment did not significantly increase p70S6k or p42mapk/p44mapk activity (data not shown). Furthermore, release of cells from a hydroxyurea-induced S phase arrest did not lead to kinase activation (data not shown). Therefore, the activation of p70S6k and p42mapk/p44mapk seen in Fig. 2B is probably not a general phenomenon se"

https://openalex.org/W2017832591,"Stretch-sensitive ion channels are ubiquitous, yet evidence of their role in mechanotransduction remains scarce. The presence of stretch-inactivated cation channels in supraoptic neurons is consistent with the osmoreceptor potentials regulating vasopressin release. However, whether osmosensitivity depends on mechanical gating and ion flux through stretch-inactivated channels is unknown. Here we report that changes in channel open probability associated either with modification of pipette pressure or with external osmolality selectively result from variations in closed time. While channel mechanosensitivity and osmotically evoked changes in cell volume are not affected by gadolinium, similar concentrations of the lanthanide inhibit cation permeation through the single channels and macroscopic osmoreceptor potentials. Mechanotransduction through stretch-inactivated channels is therefore necessary for osmoreception in supraoptic neurons."

Newly learned tectal auditory responses, induced by altered visual experience, were found to be pharmacologically distinct from normal responses expressed at the same tectal sites. N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists administered systemically or applied locally in the ICX reduced learned responses more than normal responses. This differential blockade was not observed with non-NMDA or broad-spectrum antagonists. Thus, NMDA receptors preferentially mediate the expression of novel neuronal responses induced by experience during development."
https://openalex.org/W1984449540,"The β-adrenergic receptor kinase (βARK) modulates β-adrenergic and other G protein-coupled receptors by rapidly phosphorylating agonist-occupied receptors at the plasma membrane. We have recently shown that βARK also associates with intracellular microsomal membranes both “in vitro” and “in situ” (García-Higuera, I., Penela, P., Murga, C., Egea, G., Bonay, P., Benovic, J. L., and 5or, F., Jr. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 1348-1355), thus suggesting a complex modulation of the subcellular distribution of βARK. In this report, we used recombinant [35S]methionine-labeled βARK to show that this kinase interacts rapidly with a high affinity binding site (Kd of 20 ± 1 nM) present in salt-stripped rat liver microsomal membranes. Although βARK binding is not modulated by membrane preincubation with G protein activators, the activity of bound βARK toward rhodopsin or a synthetic peptide substrate was markedly enhanced upon stimulation of the endogenous heterotrimeric G proteins present in the microsomal membranes by AlF4− or mastoparan/guanosine 5′-(3-O-thio)triphosphate, thus strongly suggesting a functional link between these proteins and membrane-associated βARK. Interestingly, βARK association with microsomal membranes is not significantly affected by a fusion protein derived from the carboxyl terminus of βARK1 (the proposed location of the βγ subunit binding site), whereas it is markedly inhibited by fusion proteins corresponding to the amino-terminal region of the kinase. The main determinants of binding appear to be localized to an ∼60-amino acid residue stretch (residues 88 to 145). Our results further indicate a functional relationship between βARK and heterotrimeric G proteins in different intracellular organelles, and suggest that additional proteins may be involved in modulating the cellular localization of the kinase through a new targeting domain of βARK. The β-adrenergic receptor kinase (βARK) modulates β-adrenergic and other G protein-coupled receptors by rapidly phosphorylating agonist-occupied receptors at the plasma membrane. We have recently shown that βARK also associates with intracellular microsomal membranes both “in vitro” and “in situ” (García-Higuera, I., Penela, P., Murga, C., Egea, G., Bonay, P., Benovic, J. L., and 5or, F., Jr. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 1348-1355), thus suggesting a complex modulation of the subcellular distribution of βARK. In this report, we used recombinant [35S]methionine-labeled βARK to show that this kinase interacts rapidly with a high affinity binding site (Kd of 20 ± 1 nM) present in salt-stripped rat liver microsomal membranes. Although βARK binding is not modulated by membrane preincubation with G protein activators, the activity of bound βARK toward rhodopsin or a synthetic peptide substrate was markedly enhanced upon stimulation of the endogenous heterotrimeric G proteins present in the microsomal membranes by AlF4− or mastoparan/guanosine 5′-(3-O-thio)triphosphate, thus strongly suggesting a functional link between these proteins and membrane-associated βARK. Interestingly, βARK association with microsomal membranes is not significantly affected by a fusion protein derived from the carboxyl terminus of βARK1 (the proposed location of the βγ subunit binding site), whereas it is markedly inhibited by fusion proteins corresponding to the amino-terminal region of the kinase. The main determinants of binding appear to be localized to an ∼60-amino acid residue stretch (residues 88 to 145). Our results further indicate a functional relationship between βARK and heterotrimeric G proteins in different intracellular organelles, and suggest that additional proteins may be involved in modulating the cellular localization of the kinase through a new targeting domain of βARK."

The M current is affected by changing intracellular calcium levels. It is proposed that internal calcium acts by regulating M channel modal gating. Intracellular application of a preactivated form of the calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin (CaN420) inhibited the macroscopic M current, while its application to excised inside-out patches reduced high open probability M channel activity. Addition of ATP reversed the action of CaN420 on excised patches. The change in M channel gating induced by CaN420 was different from the effect of muscarine. A kinetic model supports the proposition that shifts in channel gating induced by calcium-dependent phosphorylation and dephosphorylation control M current amplitude."

https://openalex.org/W2006071123,"The myosin II heavy chain (MHC)-specific protein kinase C (MHC-PKC) isolated from Dictyostelium discoideum has been implicated in the regulation of myosin II assembly in response to the chemoattractant, cAMP (Ravid, S., and Spudich, J.

In addition, in vitro studies strongly suggest that MHC phosphorylation plays an important role in the regulation of myosin II filament formation(7Kuczmarski E.R. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

(11Egelhoff T.T. Lee R.J. Spudich J.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 363-371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). They found that elimination of the MHC phosphorylation sites allows in vivo contractile activity, but this myosin II shows substantial overassembly. Mimicking the negative charge state of phosphorylated myosin II eliminates filament formation in vitro and renders the myosin II unable to drive any tested contractile event in vivo (11Egelhoff T.T.

We previously reported the isolation of a MHC-specific PKC (MHC-PKC) from Dictyostelium that phosphorylates Dictyostelium MHC specifically and is homologous to α, β, and γ subtypes of mammalian PKC(9Ravid S. Spudich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15144-15150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Ravid S. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5877-5881Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This kinase, which is membrane-associated and is expressed during Dictyostelium development, was implicated in the increase in MHC phosphorylation during chemotaxis in this species(9Ravid S. Spudich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15144-15150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro phosphorylation of MHC by MHC-PKC results in inhibition of myosin II thick filament formation(9Ravid S. Spudich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15144-15150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), by inducing the formation of a bent monomer of myosin II whose assembly domain is tied up in an intramolecular interaction that precludes intermolecular interaction, which is necessary for thick filament formation(10Pasternak C. Flicker P.F. Ravid S. Spudich J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The findings that MHC-PKC is a member of the PKC family and that it regulates myosin II assembly suggest a link between the extracellular chemotactic signal and subsequent intracellular events. A considerable amount of information is now available regarding the regulation of myosin II by MHC phosphorylation, and a picture is beginning to emerge in which the molecular changes in myosin II that are involved in MHC phosphorylation are related to cAMP-induced directed cell movement. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism by which a cAMP signal is transmitted to myosin II, resulting in myosin II localization and chemotaxis, remains unclear. In an attempt to throw some light on this issue, we studied the role of MHC-PKC in vivo by eliminating and by overexpressing the MHC-PKC protein in Dictyostelium cells. Analysis of these cell lines allowed us to address directly the role of MHC-PKC in vivo and consequently the role of MHC phosphorylation in the regulation of myosin II. The results presented here indicate that MHC-PKC is a key modulator in the regulation of myosin II localization in response to the chemoattractant, cAMP. All DNA manipulations were carried out using standard methods(13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The vector pBS-MHCK (12Ravid S. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5877-5881Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) contains a 2.6-kb MHC-PKC cDNA clone. The MHC-PKC catalytic domain was deleted by digestion with ClaI and filled in with Klenow enzyme. The vector pGEM26 containing the Thy1 gene, which complements the thymidine growth requirement of the Dictyostelium thymidine auxotroph strain JH10(14Dynes J.L. Firtel R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7966-7970Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), was restricted with BamHI and filled in with Klenow enzyme. The two fragments were ligated to produce the disruption vector pThy1-MHC-PKCΔcat (Fig. 1A). pDRE106 (see Fig. 2A) was produced by fusing an actin-15 promoter from pSC79 (15Knecht D. Cohen S. Loomis W. Lodish H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3973-3983Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) to the cDNA clone encoding the MHC-PKC (12Ravid S. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5877-5881Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and ligating this fused product into the extrachromosomal vector pnDeI(16Leiting B. Noegel A. Plasmid. 1988; 20: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid pDRE106 contains the entire MHC-PKC coding region fused in phase to actin-15 promoter and in an antisense orientation relative to the neomycin gene (Fig. 2A). Full details of the construct are available upon request. For MHC-PKC disruption experiments, we used the Dictyostelium JH10 strain that is an auxotroph for thymidine. Cells were grown in HL5 medium and 50 μg/ml thymidine (Sigma). To express the MHC-PKC we used the Dictyostelium Ax2 strain, that were grown in HL5 medium. To express the MHC-PKC along with 3X ALA myosin II(11Egelhoff T.T. Lee R.J. Spudich J.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 363-371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), we co-transformed the Dictyostelium myosin II null cells (HS1 strain) with the pDRE106 and pBIG-ALA (11Egelhoff T.T. Lee R.J. Spudich J.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 363-371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) expression vectors. Transformation was carried out using the calcium phosphate procedure(17Egelhoff T.T. Titus M.A. Manstein D.J. Ruppel K.M. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 319-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Transformants for the disruption of MHC-PKC were selected on the basis of their ability to grow in the absence of thymidine. Transformants for MHC-PKC and 3X ALA expression were selected on the basis of their resistance to the antibiotic G418 (Boehringer Mannheim), and their ability to grow in suspension since HS1 cells are unable to grow in suspension(11Egelhoff T.T. Lee R.J. Spudich J.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 363-371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Clones were initially screened with G418 at a concentration of 10 μg/ml, which was increased to 50 μg/ml. Because MHC-PKC+ cells were found to express the maximum amount of MHC-PKC in the presence of 50 μg/ml G418, all subsequent experiments were performed using this concentration. G418-resistant clones were screened by Western blot analysis using MHC-PKC polyclonal antibodies(12Ravid S. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5877-5881Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Dictyostelium cell lines were developed on MES plates (20 mM MES (pH 6.8), 0.2 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgSO4, 2% agar) as described by Berlot et al. (3Berlot C.H. Spudich J.A. Devreotes P.N. Cell. 1985; 43: 307-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Dictyostelium DNA blotting was performed as described by Sambrook et al. (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA probes were generated by random primer probe synthesis using a Random Prime DNA labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For Western blot analysis, cells were developed for 4 h in shaking flasks as described(3Berlot C.H. Spudich J.A. Devreotes P.N. Cell. 1985; 43: 307-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Samples were prepared from whole cell lysates (18De Lozanne A. Spudich J.A. Science. 1987; 236: 1086-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar) or from the insoluble fraction(9Ravid S. Spudich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15144-15150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein was determined by the method of Peterson(19Peterson G. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7141) Google Scholar), and lysates were electrophoresed on 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE)(20Laemmli U. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The Western blots were probed with affinity-purified MHC-PKC polyclonal antibody (12Ravid S. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5877-5881Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This antibody recognizes the full-length MHC-PKC as well as the R domain. 2M. Matto and S. Ravid, unpublished data. MHC-PKC activity was assayed by two methods. In the first method, MHC-PKC activity was assayed directly on the kinase extracted from the insoluble cell fraction. Following resuspension of 1 × 107 vegetative or 4-h developed cells in 1 ml of sonication buffer, (10 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mM KCl, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 μM leupeptin, 200 μM pepstatin), they were lysed by sonication using an ultrasonic cell disruptor (Microson) model XL with a small-sized tip at 50% output power, and the extract was spun for 20 min at 4°C. MHC-PKC was extracted from the insoluble fraction using sonication buffer containing 0.5 M KCl, as described(9Ravid S. Spudich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15144-15150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For kinase assay, 50 μg of solubilized MHC-PKC was incubated with LMM58 (0.5-1 mg/ml), 6 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM [γ-32P]ATP (500 cpm/pmol), 1 mM dithiothreitol for 10 min at 22°C on a rotator. Reaction was initiated by the addition of ATP and stopped by the addition of 5% trichloroacetic acid. The precipitated LMM58 were pelleted in a microcentrifuge after incubation for 15 min on ice, washed twice with 5% trichloroacetic acid, resuspended in 20 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and electrophoresed on 7% SDS-PAGE gels. To determine incorporation of 32P into LMM58, the gels were stained and destained and the bands were cut out of the gels and counted in a scintillation counter in 5 ml of scintillation fluid. In the second method, MHC-PKC was immunoprecipitated from the soluble and insoluble fractions described above. The supernatants of these fractions were added to preadsorbed MHC-PKC antibody-Staphylococcus A cell mixture prepared as described by Berlot et al. (3Berlot C.H. Spudich J.A. Devreotes P.N. Cell. 1985; 43: 307-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and incubated for at least 1 h at 4°C with rotation. The immunoprecipitated MHC-PKC from the soluble and insoluble fractions was assayed for kinase activity as described above, except that the reaction was stopped by spinning out the Staphylococcus A cell mixture containing the MHC-PKC and adding of 5% trichloroacetic acid to the supernatant to precipitate the LMM58. To measure in vivo phosphorylation of MHC, the 32P labeling and cAMP stimulation of Dictyostelium cell lines and the preparation of immunoprecipitates of cell lysates were performed as described by Berlot et al. (3Berlot C.H. Spudich J.A. Devreotes P.N. Cell. 1985; 43: 307-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitated cell lysates were electrophoresed on 7% SDS-PAGE. To determine the relative phosphorylation of MHC immunoprecipitated from Dictyostelium cell lines, the gels were scanned with a scanning laser densitometer and the peak areas were evaluated using the Gelscan XL software program that integrates the area under the peak. Relative amounts of 32P incorporated into MHC were determined using the PhosphorImager (Fuji). Relative phosphorylation of MHC was determined by dividing the values obtained with the PhosphorImager by the values obtained by scanning of the Coomassie Blue-stained gels. Triton-insoluble cytoskeleton analysis was performed as described previously(21Egelhoff T.T. Brown S.S. Spudich J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Supernatant and cytoskeletal pellet fractions were resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and electrophoresed on 7% SDS-PAGE. To determine the relative amounts of MHC, the gels were scanned with a scanning laser densitometer as described above. Indirect immunofluorescent staining was performed using the agar-overlay technique(22Fukui Y. Yumura S. Yumura T. Methods Cell Biol. 1987; 28: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). A rabbit polyclonal antiserum directed against Dictyostelium myosin II was applied at 1:300 dilution, followed by the application of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated, affinity-purified goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson) at 1:30 dilution. For cAMP stimulation of Dictyostelium cell lines, cells were overlaid with agar sheets and the excess buffer was removed with a filter paper. When the cells had flattened out, 5 μl of 1 μM cAMP solution was added to one corner of the agar sheet, and after 1 min of incubation at room temperature the cells were fixed as described(22Fukui Y. Yumura S. Yumura T. Methods Cell Biol. 1987; 28: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Chemotaxis was measured using the Zigmond chamber(23Zigmond S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 162: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). 4-h developed cells were placed on a coverslip mounted on the chamber in which one well was filled with MES buffer and the other with MES buffer containing 1 μM cAMP. After a 10-min period to allow development of a gradient, cells on the bridge were video recorded for a subsequent 20-min period. The percentage of cells that appeared on the side of the cAMP well was calculated. We routinely scored 100 cells. Cells were developed as described (3Berlot C.H. Spudich J.A. Devreotes P.N. Cell. 1985; 43: 307-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and spores were then collected in MES buffer. Aliquots of the spores were counted in a hemocytometer to determine the total number of spores present. MES buffer was added to one of the cell suspensions until the concentrations of cells from each sample were equivalent. An aliquot of each of the cell suspensions was then transferred to a glass tube and incubated at 40°C or in 0.1% Nonidet P-40 at 22°C for 20 min, to induce spore germination and kill non-spore cells(24Cotter D.A. Raper K.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1966; 56: 880-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The treated spores were serially diluted and plated on bacterial lawns. The viability of MHC-PKC– cell spores was compared to that of wild type spores by determining the number of plaque-forming units present in each cell suspension. To investigate the in vivo role of MHC-PKC in Dictyostelium, we produced two Dictyostelium cell lines that represent contrasting extremes with respect to the presence of MHC-PKC. In one cell line the endogenous copy of MHC-PKC was inactivated by gene disruption, and in the other the MHC-PKC protein was overexpressed. Like the conventional mammalian PKC, MHC-PKC contains two functional domains (Fig. 1A), a regulatory domain (R) composed of the C1 and C2 regions, and a catalytic domain (C) composed of the C3 and C4 regions(25Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4232) Google Scholar). To eliminate the catalytic activity of MHC-PKC, we constructed a disruption vector that lacks the C domain but contains the R domain and the Thy1 gene. The Dictyostelium JH10 cell line (14Dynes J.L. Firtel R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7966-7970Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) was transformed with the plasmid pThy1-MHC-PKCΔcat (Fig. 1A), and transformants were screened for the deletion by genomic Southern blotting. Fig. 1A shows the expected changes in the map of the MHC-PKC locus, and Fig. 1B shows a genomic Southern blot confirming the deletion. According to the map, the R domain has at its starting site the MHC-PKC native promoter; in contrast, the regenerated intact copy of MHC-PKC has no promoter at its starting site since this promoter is missing from the pThy1-MHC-PKCΔcat. We therefore expected that the R domain and not the regenerated copy of MHC-PKC would be expressed. We found that 30% of the transformants exhibited a pattern consistent with gene disruption events. Several independent disrupted MHC-PKC clones (MHC-PKC– cells) and Dictyostelium JH10 cells were subjected to Western blot analyses (Fig. 1C). JH10 cells did not express the MHC-PKC protein during their vegetative stage (data not shown), as was reported for Ax3 cells (12Ravid S. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5877-5881Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), but did express it after 4 h of development (Fig. 1C). We had expected that the MHC-PKC disruption construct would result in the expression of R domain, but we could not detect it in MHC-PKC– cells either in the vegetative stage (data not shown) or in the developmental stage (Fig. 1C). Our results may indicate either that the R domain is not expressed at all or that it is expressed but is unstable and degraded. Western and Southern analyses confirmed that the MHC-PKC gene was disrupted. To ensure that disruption of the MHC-PKC gene also results in elimination of its activity, we assayed JH10 and MHC-PKC– cells for the presence of MHC-PKC activity in the membrane fraction, having shown previously that MHC-PKC is a membrane-associated protein(9Ravid S. Spudich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15144-15150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The JH10 cells were found to contain MHC-PKC activity (20 pmol/min/mg) that is comparable to the activity published previously for Dictyostelium Ax3 cells (9Ravid S. Spudich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15144-15150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the MHC-PKC– cells displayed negligible amounts of kinase activity (0.01 pmol/min/mg) associated with the membrane fraction. These results suggest that disruption of the MHC-PKC gene resulted in elimination of its activity and that MHC-PKC is the only MHC kinase (MHCK) activity in the membrane of Dictyostelium. To overexpress the MHC-PKC protein, we constructed the expression vector pDRE106 (Fig. 2A), which was used to transform Dictyostelium Ax2 cells (MHC-PKC+ cells). Fig. 2B shows a Western blot analysis of Ax2 and MHC-PKC+ whole cell lysates during the vegetative stage and after 4 h of development, using MHC-PKC polyclonal antibodies (12Ravid S. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5877-5881Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In Ax2 cells the MHC-PKC was detectable only after 4 h of development, as in Ax3 cells(12Ravid S. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5877-5881Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In MHC-PKC+ cells the MHC-PKC protein was already strongly expressed in the vegetative stage (Fig. 2B), and the level of expression remained the same after 4 h of development (Fig. 2B). The expressed MHC-PKC protein was active. Fig. 2C shows the MHC-PKC activity associated with membrane fractions of Ax2 and MHC-PKC+ cells, in the vegetative stage as well as in cells developed for 4 h. We detected negligible amounts of MHC-PKC activity associated with the membrane fraction in vegetative Ax2 cells (Fig. 2C). This activity appeared upon starvation of the cells. In contrast, vegetative MHC-PKC+ cells contained MHC-PKC activity comparable to that detected in Ax2 cells developed for 4 h. Upon cell starvation this activity was increased 5-fold (Fig. 2C). The MHC-PKC+ cells expressed comparable amounts of MHC-PKC protein during the vegetative and development stages (Fig. 2B), but the activity of MHC-PKC in MHC-PKC+ vegetative cells was 5-fold lower than in MHC-PKC+ cells developed for 4 h. To resolve this apparent discrepancy, we quantified the amount of MHC-PKC protein associated with cell membranes in MHC-PKC+ cells at both stages. As shown in Fig. 2B, the amount of MHC-PKC protein associated with the membrane fraction in vegetative MHC-PKC+ cells was lower than in developed MHC-PKC+ cells. These results may indicate that a much smaller part of the MHC-PKC protein translocates to the membrane in the former case than in the latter. We found that translocation of MHC-PKC to membranes is in response to the extracellular signal, cAMP. 3A. Dumbinsky, H. Rubin, and S. Ravid, submitted for publication. Since in vegetative MHC-PKC+ cells the cAMP signal is missing, it is likely that most of the expressed MHC-PKC resides in the cell soluble-fraction in inactive state. To test this hypothesis, we compared the activity of the cytosolic and membrane-associated MHC-PKC. Since Dictyostelium contains several soluble MHCKs (for review see (26Tan J.L. Ravid S. Spudich J.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 721-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar)), we first immunoprecipitated the MHC-PKC from the soluble and insoluble fractions and assayed it for kinase activity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We compared the 32P incorporated into LMM58 by soluble and by insoluble MHC-PKC. The soluble MHC-PKC possessed only 0.5% of the kinase activity present in the membrane-associated MHC-PKC. These results suggested that the MHC-PKC that resided in the cytosol is inactive and MHC-PKC translocation to the cortex resulted in activation of the enzyme. In the following experiments, we compared MHC-PKC– cells to JH10 cells and MHC-PKC+ cells to Ax2 cells that were transformed with the vector pnDeI(16Leiting B. Noegel A. Plasmid. 1988; 20: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar); we refer to both cell lines as wild type cells. Wild type cells but not MHC-PKC mutant cells responded to cAMP stimulation by an increase in MHC phosphorylation (Fig. 3), as was reported for Dictyostelium Ax3 cells(3Berlot C.H. Spudich J.A. Devreotes P.N. Cell. 1985; 43: 307-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Removal of MHC-PKC resulted in elimination of the cAMP-dependent MHC phosphorylation. These results indicate that MHC-PKC is the kinase that phosphorylates MHC in response to cAMP. These findings are consistent with previous observations that cAMP stimulation of Dictyostelium cells causes transient increases in phosphorylation of MHC occurring primarily on threonine (4Berlot C.H. Devreotes P. Spudich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3918-3926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that MHC-PKC phosphorylates MHC on threonine residues only(9Ravid S. Spudich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15144-15150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unstimulated developed wild type and MHC-PKC– cells exhibited the same basal levels of MHC phosphorylation (Fig. 3). Overexpression of the MHC-PKC resulted in highly phosphorylated MHC. cAMP stimulation of these cells resulted in a slight increase in MHC phosphorylation. To find out whether the expressed MHC-PKC in MHC-PKC+ cells phosphorylates the same sites on MHC as the native MHC-PKC in wild type cells, we compared the phosphorylation levels of MHC after cAMP stimulation of cells expressing the 3X ALA MHC (17Egelhoff T.T. Titus M.A. Manstein D.J. Ruppel K.M. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 319-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and in cells that co-expressed MHC-PKC and the 3X ALA MHC. In the 3X ALA MHC mutant, the phosphorylation sites previously shown to be a target of several MHCKs (27Vaillancourt J. Lyons C. Cote G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 236: 10082-10087Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 28Luck-Vielmetter D. Schleicher M. Grabatin B. Wippler J. Gerisch G. FEBS Lett. 1990; 269: 239-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) were converted to alanine residues, thus eliminating phosphorylation at these positions. These phosphorylation sites are localized within the region of MHC that is phosphorylated by MHC-PKC. 4S. Ravid, T. T. Egelhoff, and J. A. Spudich, unpublished data. The rationale for this experiment was that if the highly phosphorylated MHC in developed MHC-PKC+ cells (Fig. 3) reflects additional phosphorylation sites on MHC phosphorylated by the expressed MHC-PKC, then overexpression of MHC-PKC with 3X ALA MHC should result in phosphorylated MHC, while cells expressing 3X ALA MHC alone will contain nonphosphorylated MHC. We found that cAMP stimulation of 3X ALA cells or cells co-expressing MHC-PKC and 3X ALA MHC do not respond to this stimulation by increasing the phosphorylation level of MHC. The MHC from both cell lines contained the same basal level of phosphorylation as was found for wild type cells (data not shown). These results indicate that MHC-PKC overexpression did not result in phosphorylation of new sites on MHC. To find out whether the expressed MHC-PKC in vegetative MHC-PKC+ cells also resulted in highly phosphorylated MHC as was found for developed MHC-PKC+ cells (Fig. 3), we compared the phosphorylation level of MHC isolated from vegetative MHC-PKC+ and wild type cells. We found that the phosphorylation levels of MHC in both cell lines were similar (data not shown). These results indicate that although the MHC-PKC in vegetative MHC-PKC+ cell is active, it was incapable of phosphorylating MHC in vivo. In order to study the effect of the aberrant MHC phosphorylation on the localization properties of myosin II in the MHC-PKC mutant cells, we isolated cAMP-stimulated actin-enriched Triton-insoluble cytoskeletons (21Egelhoff T.T. Brown S.S. Spudich J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In unstimulated developed wild type cells, 28% of the myosin II was insoluble. Addition of cAMP resulted in a rapid accumulation of myosin II associated with the Triton-insoluble cytoskeleton (up to 46%), followed by an increase in myosin II solubility (Fig. 4). In unstimulated developed MHC-PKC– cells, 46% of the myosin II was already insoluble. Addition of cAMP resulted in a gradual increase in myosin II insolub"

INTRODUCTIONActivation of phospholipases has been implicated in a wide range of signal transduction pathways(1Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4215) Google Scholar). With regard to phospholipase D (PLase D), 1The abbreviations used are: PLase Dphospholipase DPLase Cphospholipase Clyso-PAlysophosphatidic acidlyso-PElysophosphatidylethanolaminelyso-PClysophosphatidylcholine. the current information as to the molecules generated by PLase D activation and their mode of action is still scarce (reviewed in (2Liscovitch M. Liscovitch M. Signal-activated Phospholipases. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1994: 31-63Google Scholar)).The first step in the lytic activity of phospholipase D is the formation of a phosphoryl enzyme intermediate which is analogous to the acyl enzyme in the action of common esterases(3Waite M.(ed) The Phospholipases. Plenum Press, New York1987Crossref Google Scholar, 4Halbrook P.G. Pannell L.K. Daly J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1084: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This intermediate is generally cleaved by the ambient water molecules with the net hydrolysis of one phosphoester bond. However, alcoholic hydroxyl residues can compete for the cleavage of the phosphoryl enzyme intermediate to yield a phosphodiester product(5Zwall R.F.A. Roelefsen B. Method Enzymol. 1974; 52: 154-161Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 6Eibl A. Kovatchev S. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 72: 632-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). If a hydroxyl group is positioned appropriately in the substrate it can also compete for the phosphoryl enzyme yielding a cyclic product. Cyclic products of phospholipase action have been detected in the action of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PLase C) on phosphatidylinositol yielding 1,2-cyclic inositol phosphate as the initial product(7Griffith O.H. Volwerk J.J. Kuppe A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 8Dawson R.M.C. Freinkel N. Jungalwala F.B. Clarke N. Biochem. J. 1971; 122: 605-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and in the PLase C hydrolysis of phosphatidylglycerol to 1,3-cyclic glycerophosphate(9Shinitzky M. Friedman P. Haimovitz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14109-14115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar cyclization takes place in the hydrolysis of glycerophosphorylcholine or glycerophosphorylethanolamine by glycerophosphinicocholine diesterase, where 1,2-cyclic glycerophosphate is formed(10Clarke N. Dawson R.M.C. Biochem. J. 1976; 153: 745-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 11Clarke N. Dawson R.M.C. Biochem. J. 1978; 173: 579-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). All of these cyclic phosphates are relatively stable at neutral pH but can be hydrolyzed by specific phosphodiesterases to form the respective phosphate monoesters(12Majerus P.W. Connolly T.M. Dechmyn H. Ross T.S. Bross T.E. Ishii H. Bansal V.S. Wilson D.B. Science. 1986; 234: 1519-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 13Ross T.S. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11119-11123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It seems, therefore, that when the phosphoryl residue attached to the enzyme includes a free hydroxyl group, the formation of a cyclic phosphodiester by intramolecular transphosphorylation can take place. In analogy to the above reactions with a hydroxyl group, it has been suggested (9Shinitzky M. Friedman P. Haimovitz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14109-14115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that phospholipids with a free primary amine group (i.e. phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine) may yield a cyclic phosphoramidate intermediate upon the action of PLase C. These putative five-membered cyclic phosphoramidates are expected to be hydrolyzed spontaneously(9Shinitzky M. Friedman P. Haimovitz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14109-14115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The action of PLase D on phospholipids forms a phosphatidyl enzyme intermediate which can either react with water to yield phosphatidic acid (PA) or with an alcohol (5Zwall R.F.A. Roelefsen B. Method Enzymol. 1974; 52: 154-161Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 6Eibl A. Kovatchev S. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 72: 632-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) to yield a new phospholipid (e.g. phosphatidylethanol if ethanol is added as the alcohol). This transphosphatidylation reaction raises the possibility that the action of PLase D on lysophospholipids may yield cyclic lyso-PA by intramolecular transphosphorylation with the hydroxyl on carbon 2 of the glycerol backbone as schematically presented in Fig. 1. The present work provides evidence that cyclic lyso-PA is formed upon the interaction of bacterial PLase D with lysophosphatidylcholine (lyso-PC) or lysophosphatidylethanolamine (lyso-PE).MATERIALS AND METHODSLysophospholipidsL-α synthetic acyl (hexanoyl-, octanoyl-, decanoyl-, and oleoyl-) glycerol γ-phosphorylcholines (lyso-PC) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids. Lyso-PE, L-α-palmitoyl glycerol γ-phosphorylethanolamine, was obtained by treating dipalmitoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (Lucas Meyer) with phospholipase A2 from bee venom (Sigma) as described(14DeHaas G.H. Postema N.M. Nieuwenhuizen W. VanDeenen L.L.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 159: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Purification was afforded by preparative thin layer chromatography (TLC) on silica gel (Merck) with chloroform:methanol:water 65:25:4 (v:v:v) as the running solvent.1-Octanoyl 2,3-cyclic glycerophosphate was prepared by reacting α-octanoyl glycerol (Avanti Chemicals) with phosphorus oxychloride as described(15Reynolds L. Hughes L. Louis A.I. Kramer R.M. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1167: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). It was assumed that the transacylation in this reaction did not exceed 10%(16Ten Hoeve W. Wynberg H. J. Org. Chem. 1985; 50: 4804-4814Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and therefore the prepared lysophospholipid was essentially of the α configuration.Phospholipase DTwo preparations of PLase D from Streptomyces chromofuscus of relatively high specific activity (approximately 500 units/mg of protein) obtained from Sigma and from Boehringer Mannheim GmbH were used in this study. They were found essentially identical in their activity profile. The enzyme activity was routinely assessed by monitoring remaining substrate content in aliquots removed at discrete time points. The aliquots were quenched by the addition of tetrahydrofuran, and the lipid species were separated by TLC on silica gel plates with running solvent as above. Each spot was scraped from the TLC plate and the phosphate content determined(17Rouser B. Siakotos A. Fleischer S. Lipids. 1966; 1: 85-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1313) Google Scholar).NMRSpectra were recorded at 28°C either with a Varian 500 NMR spectrometer or with a Bruker AMX-400 NMR spectrometer. 31P(1H) NMR spectra were acquired at 161.97 MHz (on the Bruker instrument) or 202.404 MHz (on the Varian instrument). Spectral parameters included an 80-ppm sweep width and 128 or 256 transients. Qualitative spectra presentation was obtained at 70° pulses using 4-s relaxation delay and composite pulse proton decoupling. For quantitative evaluation, 60° pulse, 7-s relaxation delay, and composite pulse proton decoupling were employed. These conditions complied with the complete relaxation delay (5T1) of the nucleus with the longest relaxation time among the 31P nuclei in our experiments, which was 6.6 s. A 5% error in this method was estimated based on deviation in reproducibility of a set of seven independent experiments. The assignment of resonances was based on their chemical shift with respect to phosphocreatine at −2.5 ppm, which served as an internal or external reference.The in situ enzymic experiments were carried out in D2O. Samples in 10-mm NMR tubes contained 30-40 mg of synthetic lyso-PC dispersed in ~1.5 ml of 100 mM borate buffer, pD = 8, with 10 mM calcium chloride. An appropriate amount of PLase D was added, depending on the overall reaction time desired.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONPreliminary screening has indicated that bacterial PLase D, unlike cabbage PLase D, can cleave the headgroup of lyso-PC and lyso-PE in the presence of ether or 1% Triton X-100. Fig. 2 presents the comparative degradation profiles of PC and lyso-PC solubilized in Triton X-100 mixed micelles, pH 8.0, as assayed by TLC and determination of the phosphorus content of each lipid spot. Under these conditions lyso-PC is a substrate for bacterial PLase D, but it is not as rapidly hydrolyzed as PC, in qualitative agreement with the findings of Imamura and Horiuti(18Imamura S. Horiuti Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1979; 85: 79-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In an analogous assay with dipalmitoyl-PE and 1-palmitoyl-PE (lyso-PE), similar profiles and rates of degradation were obtained. It should be noted that the enzyme “lysophospholipase D” (19Wykle R.L. Kraemer W.F. Schremmer J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 619: 58-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 20Wykle R.L. Strum J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) acts selectively on L-α-ether-linked lysophospholipids and not on the common ester-linked L-α-lysophospholipids which were studied here.Figure 2:Degradation profile of egg PC and egg lyso-PC by bacterial PLase D. Egg PC (○, •) or lyso-PC (▵, ▴), each at an initial concentration of 5 mg/ml, was incubated with bacterial PLase D at pH 5.5 (100 mM acetate buffer containing 10 mM calcium chloride, open symbols) or at pH 8.0 (100 mM borate buffer containing 10 mM calcium chloride, filled symbols) in the presence of 1% Triton X-100 at 25°C. At each time point an aliquot was removed from the reaction mixture and phospholipids were separated by TLC and determined by phosphorus analysis (see “Materials and Methods”).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The aqueous medium consisting of phospholipid (5 mg/ml) dispersed in 1% Triton X-100, 10 mM borate buffer, pH 8.0, with 2 mM Ca2+ (see Fig. 2 and “Materials and Methods”) was found suitable for in situ monitoring of the PLase D cleavage products of lysophospholipids by 31P NMR. However, short chain lyso-PC substrates (e.g. 1-octanoyl-3-glycerolphosphorylcholine) were found to be hydrolyzed by bacterial PLase D without the use of Triton X-100 or ether. Furthermore, for these compounds the lyso-PC concentration used in the assay was below its critical micellar concentration, ensuring that the substrate is essentially monomeric. During the course of the lyso-PC hydrolysis, a new resonance was observed at 18.5 ppm as presented in Fig. 3. Ordinary phosphate esters (e.g. lyso-PA or lyso-PC) are characterized by resonances in the range of +5 to −6 ppm(21Blackburn G.M. Cohen J.S. Weatherall I. Tetrahedron. 1971; 27: 2903-2912Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The chemical shift of the new resonance, quite downfield from that of the substrate (0.5 ppm) and product (5.1 or 0.8 ppm, with or without vanadate, respectively), was consistent with the formation of a five-membered cyclic phosphodiester. Five-membered cyclic phosphates have a downfield shift due to σ-electron shielding effect(22Gallagher G. Verkade J.G. Quin L.D. Methods in Stereochemical Analysis. 8. VCH Inc., Deerfield Beach, FL1987: 297-330Google Scholar). Experimental conditions were selected for the complete hydrolysis of the lysophospholipid substrate by PLase D to occur over several hours. This allowed the production of the five-membered cyclic phosphodiester and the more gradual appearance of lyso-PA to be monitored for different substrate systems as a function of time. In all of the incubations of lyso-PC and lyso-PE with PLase D, the formation of a 31P resonance at 18.5 ppm (i.e. a cyclic diester product) was observed concomitant with the appearance of the lyso-PA resonance. After rapidly reaching a certain intensity which was maintained for a while (consistent with reaching a steady-state concentration), the resonance at 18.5 ppm declined, while that of the phosphate monoester (i.e. lyso-PA) continued to increase in intensity (Fig. 3). The most likely explanation for the unusual downfield shifted resonance was the formation of a cyclic lyso-PA as an intermediate in the PLase D reaction.Figure 3:In vitro monitoring by 31P(1H) NMR of lyso-PC degradation by bacterial PLase D. Synthetic lyso-PC (1-octanoyl 3-glycerol phosphorylcholine) at the initial concentration of 100 mM in borate buffer, pD 8.0 (containing 10 mM Ca2+) was incubated with bacterial PLase D in the NMR tube at 28°C for 14 h. The recorded 31P(1H) NMR spectra indicate the formation and the decline of a peak of a five-membered phosphodiestering at δ = 18.5 ppm (cyclic lyso-PA, c-LPA), decay of the lyso-PC (LPC) resonance at δ = 0.5 ppm, and the subsequent emergence of a lyso-PA (LPA) resonance at δ = 0.8 ppm.

The phosphorus chemical shift of this material corresponded to 18.5 ppm, essentially the same shift as the resonance observed by 31P NMR in assays of the action of PLase D on lyso-PC or lyso-PE (Fig. 3). The synthetic 1-octanoyl 2,3-cyclic glycerophosphate was examined for its stability under assay conditions and as a substrate for bacterial PLase D, since in the NMR assays eventually all the cyclic product was converted to lyso-PA. The synthetic cyclic lyso-PA was found to be stable at pH 6-8 for at least 10 h as was indicated by invariant intensity at +18.5 ppm (Fig. 4). However, in the presence of PLase D, the intensity of this resonance decreased while that of lyso-PA increased, indicating phosphatase activity. The addition of egg PC in 1% Triton X-100 or in a 1:1 mixture with lyso-PC did not affect the rate of this reaction which excluded the possibility that the cyclization and the ring opening take place at the same catalytic site.Figure 4:Hydrolysis profile of synthetic cyclic lyso-PA. 1-Octanoyl 2,3-cyclic glycerophosphate in the presence (•) and absence (▴) of bacterial PLase D. The emerging lyso-PA is also indicated (○). The experimental conditions are as described in the legend to Fig. 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The cyclization and the ring opening activities could, in principle, be related to separate entities which copurified in the partial enzyme purification used to generate the PLase D. All the PLase D preparations used in the NMR experiments also exhibited a strong phosphatase activity with the conventional substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate (data not shown). To explore this further, we have chromatographed PLase D preparations by gel filtration using Sephadex G-75, G-100, G-150, and S-300, DEAE-cellulose-52, and red Sepharose, which is an affinity binder of alkaline phosphatase, in an attempt to dissociate these activities. In all of these attempts the phosphatase activity, as monitored by hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate, coincided with the PLase D activity. Therefore, we tentatively conclude that the phosphatase activity is inherent in the bacterial PLase D.The reaction profiles presented above and the fact that cyclization and phosphatase activities always coincided suggest that PLase D carries out two sequential enzymatic reactions with lysophospholipids: (i) intramolecular cyclization to form cyclic lyso-PA, followed by (ii) hydrolysis to lyso-PA, namely a phosphodiesterase type cleavage.An alternative approach for dissecting the cyclization activity from that of the ring opening was the use of phosphatase competitive inhibitors. In a series of 31P NMR experiments which were carried out under the same conditions as in Fig. 3, we have added β-glycerophosphate (5 mM), p-nitrophenyl phosphate (5 mM), and sodium vanadate (2-100 mM). Sodium vanadate at concentrations of 5-10 mM could partially inhibit the phosphatase activity of the PLase D. This was measured by a substantial increase in relative content of cyclic lyso-PA compared with lyso-PA. An example of a reaction profile in the presence of 5 mM sodium vanadate is shown in Fig. 5. Under these reaction conditions there was a clear relative increase in the intensity of the resonance at +18.5 ppm. The presence of sodium vanadate caused a downfield shift and splitting in the resonance of the lyso-PA. One possible explanation for the marked effect of vanadate on the lyso-PA resonances could be the formation of pyrophosphovanadate which is stabilized by the presence of Ca2+. 51V spectra recorded in the above system (not shown) displayed an upfield shift similar to that recorded in a pyrophosphovanadate formed between adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and sodium vanadate(23Tracey A.S. Gresser M.J. Lin S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 5869-5874Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The two resonances at the region of lyso-PA (Fig. 5) might be related to α and β isomers.Figure 5:Degradation profile of lyso-PC by PLase D in the presence of 5 mM sodium vanadate.

In practice, however, this could be carried out only in the presence of sodium vanadate which acted as an inhibitor of the phosphadiesterase component (see Fig. 5). A typical experimental presentation of the change in A, B, and C with time in the presence of 5 mM sodium vanadate is shown in Fig. 6. The presented values were obtained by pick integration under instrumental setup for quantitative evaluation (see “Materials and Methods”). The profiles comply with, and and with the implied correspondence C = A○ - A - B. Approximate analysis of the kinetics described above was carried out by first evaluating VA/KA according to and. For the experimental conditions used in Fig. 6, the corresponding rate of cyclization was around VA/KA = 0.04 min-1. VB/KB could be evaluated in an independent experiment (as the one presented in Fig. 5) measuring the hydrolysis of synthetic B, 1-octanoyl 2,3-cyclic glycerophosphate. The value obtained was VB/KB = 0.01 min-1. Insertion of these VA/KA and VB/KB values into yielded the change in the cyclic lyso-PA concentration as a function of reaction time. As seen in Fig. 6, the correspondence between the observed and calculated presence of cyclic lyso-PA is reasonable, considering the series of approximations that were applied.Figure 6:The time profiles of the reduction in lyso-PC and increase in lyso-PA and cyclic lyso-PA by the action of bacterial PLase D in the presence of 0.01 M sodium vanadate.

Hordijk P.L.E.J. Moolenaar W.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1198: 185-196PubMed Google Scholar, 26Cook S.J. Rubinfeld B. Albert I. McCormick F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3475-3485Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). It is synthesized either by the action of PLase A2 on PA or by phosphorylation of α-monoglyceride by a specific kinase. Cyclic lyso-PA can in principle be formed in cells by the action of PLase A2 on membrane phospholipids (27Liscovitch M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 393-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) followed by the action of PLase D which is described here. These consecutive enzyme reactions may impose a serious stringency on the formation of cyclic lyso-PA. Furthermore, the conversion of cyclic lyso-PA to lyso-PA will demand a third enzymatic action. Detection of these yet unexplored reactions will clarify whether cyclic lyso-PA is actually formed in cells and whether it serves as a dormant form of lyso-PA or acts as a modulator of cell functions on its own right. INTRODUCTIONActivation of phospholipases has been implicated in a wide range of signal transduction pathways(1Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4215) Google Scholar). With regard to phospholipase D (PLase D), 1The abbreviations used are: PLase Dphospholipase DPLase Cphospholipase Clyso-PAlysophosphatidic acidlyso-PElysophosphatidylethanolaminelyso-PClysophosphatidylcholine. the current information as to the molecules generated by PLase D activation and their mode of action is still scarce (reviewed in (2Liscovitch M. Liscovitch M. Signal-activated Phospholipases. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1994: 31-63Google Scholar)).The first step in the lytic activity of phospholipase D is the formation of a phosphoryl enzyme intermediate which is analogous to the acyl enzyme in the action of common esterases(3Waite M.(ed) The Phospholipases. Plenum Press, New York1987Crossref Google Scholar, 4Halbrook P.G. Pannell L.K. Daly J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1084: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This intermediate is generally cleaved by the ambient water molecules with the net hydrolysis of one phosphoester bond. However, alcoholic hydroxyl residues can compete for the cleavage of the phosphoryl enzyme intermediate to yield a phosphodiester product(5Zwall R.F.A. Roelefsen B. Method Enzymol. 1974; 52: 154-161Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 6Eibl A. Kovatchev S. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 72: 632-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). If a hydroxyl group is positioned appropriately in the substrate it can also compete for the phosphoryl enzyme yielding a cyclic product. Cyclic products of phospholipase action have been detected in the action of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PLase C) on phosphatidylinositol yielding 1,2-cyclic inositol phosphate as the initial product(7Griffith O.H. Volwerk J.J. Kuppe A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 8Dawson R.M.C. Freinkel N. Jungalwala F.B. Clarke N. Biochem. J. 1971; 122: 605-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and in the PLase C hydrolysis of phosphatidylglycerol to 1,3-cyclic glycerophosphate(9Shinitzky M. Friedman P. Haimovitz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14109-14115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar cyclization takes place in the hydrolysis of glycerophosphorylcholine or glycerophosphorylethanolamine by glycerophosphinicocholine diesterase, where 1,2-cyclic glycerophosphate is formed(10Clarke N. Dawson R.M.C. Biochem. J. 1976; 153: 745-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 11Clarke N. Dawson R.M.C. Biochem. J. 1978; 173: 579-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). All of these cyclic phosphates are relatively stable at neutral pH but can be hydrolyzed by specific phosphodiesterases to form the respective phosphate monoesters(12Majerus P.W. Connolly T.M. Dechmyn H. Ross T.S. Bross T.E. Ishii H. Bansal V.S. Wilson D.B. Science. 1986; 234: 1519-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 13Ross T.S. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11119-11123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It seems, therefore, that when the phosphoryl residue attached to the enzyme includes a free hydroxyl group, the formation of a cyclic phosphodiester by intramolecular transphosphorylation can take place. In analogy to the above reactions with a hydroxyl group, it has been suggested (9Shinitzky M. Friedman P. Haimovitz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14109-14115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that phospholipids with a free primary amine group (i.e. phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine) may yield a cyclic phosphoramidate intermediate upon the action of PLase C. These putative five-membered cyclic phosphoramidates are expected to be hydrolyzed spontaneously(9Shinitzky M. Friedman P. Haimovitz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14109-14115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The action of PLase D on phospholipids forms a phosphatidyl enzyme intermediate which can either react with water to yield phosphatidic acid (PA) or with an alcohol (5Zwall R.F.A. Roelefsen B. Method Enzymol. 1974; 52: 154-161Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 6Eibl A. Kovatchev S. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 72: 632-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) to yield a new phospholipid (e.g. phosphatidylethanol if ethanol is added as the alcohol). This transphosphatidylation reaction raises the possibility that the action of PLase D on lysophospholipids may yield cyclic lyso-PA by intramolecular transphosphorylation with the hydroxyl on carbon 2 of the glycerol backbone as schematically presented in Fig. 1. The present work provides evidence that cyclic lyso-PA is formed upon the interaction of bacterial PLase D with lysophosphatidylcholine (lyso-PC) or lysophosphatidylethanolamine (lyso-PE)."
https://openalex.org/W1990128664,"Axonal tracts in the vertebrate brain seem to respect domains of homeobox gene expression. To test the role of engrailed in tract formation in the midbrain, we inhibited its expression using antisense (AS) oligonucleotides. Phosphorothioate-modified AS oligos caused navigational errors in both the optic projection (OP) and the intertectal commissure (ITC). These oligos, however, also inhibited bFGF binding to the brain. To determine whether these tract phenotypes were due to inhibition of bFGF function or engrailed expression, we used partially phosphorothioate-modified (pp) oligos, which inhibit engrailed expression but do not affect bFGF binding. These ppAS oligos caused the ITC phenotype but had no effect on the OP. Thus, interference with bFGF function correlates with the OP phenotype, while the ITC phenotype is directly related to engrailed expression."

INTRODUCTIONThe exceptionally large dynamic range of functional properties displayed by hemoglobins (Hb) and myoglobins (Mb) 1The abbreviations used are: Mbmyoglobin(s)CWcontinuous wave. has made these systems paradigms for the study of structure-function relationships in proteins. A major thrust of molecular biophysics has been to understand how modest variations in structure often produce substantial changes in ligand binding properties. As a consequence there is interest in studying those proteins that display extremes in functionality. One such system is the hemoglobin from Ascaris suum, a parasitic nematode.Ascaris has a perienteric hemoglobin with an oxygen affinity up to 104 times higher than that of vertebrate globins (P50 = 0.004 mm Hg in contrast to ~0.5-30 mm Hg for other Hbs or Mbs). The affinity of the protein for carbon monoxide is at the same level as that found in vertebrate hemoglobins and myoglobins(1Keilin D. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B Biol. Sci. 1925; 98: 312-346Crossref Google Scholar, 2Davenport H.E. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B Biol. Sci. 1949; 136: 225-270Google Scholar). The high oxygen affinity arises from an exceptionally slow oxygen dissociation rate (3000 times lower than for Mb)(2Davenport H.E. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B Biol. Sci. 1949; 136: 225-270Google Scholar).Ascaris hemoglobin consist of eight identical subunits, with each subunit containing two myoglobin-like domains (D1 and D2) in tandem, followed by a highly charged C-terminal tail which is probably involved with octamerization(3De Baere I. Liu L. Moens L. Van Beeumen J.V. Gielens C. Richelle J. Trotman C. Finch J. Gerstein M. Perutz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1992; 89: 11696-11700Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Domain 1 (D1) of Ascaris Hb has recently been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli by Goldberg and co-workers(5Kloek A.P. Yang J. Mathews F.S. Goldberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17669-17671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Sherman D.R. Kloek A.P. Krishnan B.R. Guinn B. Goldberg D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11696-11700Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It was found that the isolated monomeric domain retains an O2 affinity as high as that of the intact octamer, demonstrating that the affinity is intrinsic and at least relatively independent of subunit interaction. Alignment of the individual domains with vertebrate globins typically shows about 15% homology, yet numerous invariant residues have been found(3De Baere I. Liu L. Moens L. Van Beeumen J.V. Gielens C. Richelle J. Trotman C. Finch J. Gerstein M. Perutz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4638-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 6Sherman D.R. Kloek A.P. Krishnan B.R. Guinn B. Goldberg D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11696-11700Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).One important difference between Ascaris Hb and vertebrate oxygen carriers is that the distal histidine E7 of vertebrate globins is replaced with a glutamine in both Ascaris hemoglobin domains. The distal histidine is a well studied residue known to stabilize the heme-bound oxygen through a hydrogen bond(7Phillips S.E.V. Schoenborn B.P. Nature. 1981; 292: 81-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 8Nagai K. Luisi B. Shih D. Miyazaki G. Imai K. Poyart C. De Young A. Kwiatkowsky L. Noble R.W. Lin S.H. Yu N.T.

Glutamine, the most common naturally occurring replacement for histidine, can also serve as a hydrogen bond donor to the bound oxygen in Ascaris Hb. Indeed, conversion of this residue to leucine or alanine produces a hemoglobin variant with oxygen off rates 5- and 60-fold higher, respectively, than that of unaltered D1(10Kloek A.P. Yang J. Mathews F.S. Frieden C. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2377-2379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).There is indirect evidence for an additional hydrogen bond to the bound oxygen originating from the tyrosine residue at position B10. Mutation of this residue to either phenylalanine or leucine greatly increases the off rate of oxygen, resulting in more than a 100-fold decrease in oxygen affinity(10Kloek A.P. Yang J. Mathews F.S. Frieden C. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2377-2379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Baere I.D. Perutz M.F. Kiger L. Marden M.C. Poyart C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1594-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The above studies suggest that glutamine and tyrosine side chains in the heme pocket stabilize the heme-bound oxygen, with hydrogen bonding being the likely mechanism. Surprisingly, the sperm whale myoglobin mutant where the native B10 leucine is replaced by tyrosine has a lowered oxygen affinity, with an off rate 50 times higher than that of the wild type(12Gibson Q.H. Regan R. Olson J.S. Carver T.E. Dixon B. Pohajdak B. Sharma P.K. Vinogradov S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16993-16998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), illustrating the fundamental limitations of identifying the structural or functional role of residues based solely on the site-directed mutagenesis approach. Recent x-ray crystallographic results (13Yang J. Kloek A.P. Goldberg D.E. Mathews F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4224-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) indicate that the tyrosine in the Ascaris Hb is situated close enough to the oxygen to form a hydrogen bond.The present study reports on the use of UV resonance Raman to probe changes in the environments of the tryptophan and tyrosine residues for the D1 domain as a function of ligand binding and ligand. The D1 domain contains three tryptophans and seven tyrosines. Both the native and E7 Gln to Leu mutant forms of the D1 fragment are studied. The deoxy, carbonmonoxy, and oxy derivatives have been compared. Our results provide direct spectroscopic evidence for the existence of a hydrogen bond between tyrosine B10 and heme-bound oxygen, both in the native D1 domain and in the QE7L mutant.MATERIALS AND METHODSUV Resonance Raman SpectroscopyUV resonance Raman spectroscopy is a powerful molecular probe technique that allows for the generation of structure sensitive vibrational spectra containing resonantly enhanced Raman bands associated with aromatic amino acids within proteins(14Austin J.C. Rodgers K.R. Spiro T.G. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 226: 374-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 15Asher S. Anal. Chem. 1993; 65: 59-65Crossref Google Scholar, 16Kitagawa T. Prog. Biophys. Mol.

Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 905-912Crossref Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The effective utilization of this technique has been limited by the availability of appropriate laser sources and detectors. For this study, a new system was used that was designed and constructed by Dr. D. Eads for the Laser Spectroscopy Facility at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. A key feature is that it contains a CW (continuous wave) tunable UV laser source that does not cause the higher levels of photodamage that typically occurs with the pulsed sources that are more commonly utilized.The UV resonance Raman apparatus is composed of a laser source, a 1.5 m single spectrograph equipped with a 3600 groove/mm holographic grating and an liquid N2 cooled CCD detector. The CCD detector (Princeton Instruments, Princeton, NJ) has a UV metachrome coating on its chip. An intracavity frequency-doubled ring dye laser (Coherent 899) utilizing stilbene 420 is pumped by multi-UV line output of Argon ion laser (Coherent Innova 400). To maximize the UV output with acceptable bandwidth, a single thin etalon is used instead of the usual two etalons (thick and thin). This laser system generates CW UV output from 218 to 240 nm. The maximum output of this system (at 226 nm) is 6 milliwatts. In this experiment, the average UV power used is ~1.0 milliwatts, which has proven to be sufficient for acquiring high quality Raman spectra. The samples (~1 ml) were held in a quartz tube for data collection. Typical samples were ~0.1 mM in heme in phosphate buffer (30 mM, pH 7.3). During the period of data acquisition, the tube was maintained at 10°C and spun at 5 Hz to minimize local heating and potential photodegradation. The scattered photons were collected with a triplet lens (fused suprasil, CVI Laser Corp.) and focused onto the entrance slit (270 μm) of the spectrograph (Sopra, Inc., Bois-Colombes France). The wavenumber shift was calibrated with the use of the Raman spectra of cyclohexane and 1,4-dioxane. For the UV Raman data presented here, spectral acquisitions were carried out as a series of 5-min accumulations. Each final spectrum was the sum of three to five of these 5-min spectra. Before summing the spectra, spectral spikes due to cosmic rays were removed from each spectrum using SpectralCal software (Galactic Industries Corp.). Also, each spectrum was subtracted from the first one taken from a given sample. If difference features were observed, the spectrum was discarded. In order to accurately compare different spectra from different samples, 0.2 M perchlorate was added to the stock buffer solutions from which the samples were prepared. The perchlorate Raman band at 934 cm-1 serves as a protein invarient intensity reference. When comparing two spectra, the spectral intensities from the protein are normalized by matching the heights of the perchlorate internal reference bands at 934 cm-1. This technique is used for accurate comparisons only for those situations where it is possible to maintain the identical concentrations of both perchlorate and protein, as in comparisons between the deoxy and ligand bound forms of a given protein where all the derivatives are made from the same stock solution.Protein SamplesThe native and E7 Gln to Leu mutant D1 domain proteins were prepared and characterized according to previously described procedures(5Kloek A.P. Yang J. Mathews F.S. Goldberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17669-17671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONFig. 1 shows a comparison of the UV resonance Raman spectra of the deoxy and carbonmonoxy derivatives of the native D1 Hb fragment. Each spectrum consists of several bands which are due to tryptophan (labeled W in spectra shown) and tyrosine (Y) residues. The assignments and conformational sensitivities for these vibrational bands have been worked out and discussed by several investigators(14Austin J.C. Rodgers K.R. Spiro T.G.

M. Friedman and S. Huang, unpublished data. Fig. 2 shows a similar comparison between the deoxy and oxy derivatives of the native D1 fragment. Also shown are the difference spectra between the oxy and deoxy derivatives, the oxy and CO derivatives and, for comparative purpose, a repeat of the difference between the CO and deoxy derivatives of this protein. Except for the feature associated with the tyrosine Y8a and the lower frequency Y8b peaks at ~1616 and 1600 cm-1, respectively, the changes induced in the spectrum of the deoxy derivative upon binding either ligand are the essentially the same. That point is further illustrated by virtue of the absence of prominent difference features in the oxy versus carbonmonoxy difference (with the exception of the Y8a and Y8b peaks). It is clear that the major difference between CO and O2 with respect to ligand binding induced changes in the deoxy spectrum, is the substantial increase in intensity associated with the Y8a and Y8b bands of the oxy derivative. Other ligand binding induced features in the difference spectra, most noticeably the one associated with W3 band at ~1555 cm-1, do appear slightly more exaggerated for the oxy derivative relative to the CO derivative.Figure 2:A comparison of the CW UV resonance Raman spectra of the deoxy and oxy derivatives of the D1 fragment of Hb(Ascaris) obtained under same conditions described for Fig. 1. The bottom of the figure shows the difference spectra obtained by comparing the oxy and deoxy species, the oxy and carbonmonoxy species and the carbonmonoxy and deoxy species. The latter difference is a repetition of the difference spectrum shown in Fig. 1. It is repeated in this figure to allow for a direct comparison with the other differences.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3 shows a blow up of the high frequency region of the UV resonance Raman spectra of the O2 and CO derivatives of the QE7L mutant of the D1 fragment. It can be seen that the oxygen binding induced increase in the intensity of the tyrosine Y8a and Y8b bands also occurs in this mutant although the fractional increase appears to be less than for the native fragment. In clear contrast to the native D1 fragment, the mutant displays distinct changes in several other Raman bands in going from CO to O2. These changes are shown in Fig. 4 which displays a blow up of the mid-frequency regime of the UV resonance spectrum. Of particular interest is the change that occurs for the W7 Fermi doublet at ~1350 cm-1. The ratio of these two bands reflects the degree of hydrophobicity in the environment of the contributing tryptophans (14Austin J.C. Rodgers K.R. Spiro T.G.

These changes involve both tryptophans and tyrosines. Two of the three tryptophans in the D1 domain are situated in the G helix. The third is in the H helix. The proximity of at least the G helix tryptophans to the heme raises the possibility that the ligand binding induced changes are the results of very local changes due to the conformational and electronic changes in the heme upon ligand binding. Thus small change in W16 could be due to either the response of the tryptophans to the local electronic changes at the heme upon switching from a five coordinate high spin ferrous heme to a six coordinate low spin ferrous heme or to small tertiary structure changes induces by ligand binding.The absence of substantial tertiary changes upon ligand binding is supported by the observation 3S. Huang, J. Huang, A. P. Kloek, D. E. Goldberg, and J. M. Friedman, manuscript in preparation. that the visible resonance Raman spectra of the deoxy form and the 10-ns photoproduct of the CO derivative are identical. The visible resonance Raman spectrum is highly sensitive to the influence of protein tertiary structure upon different degrees of freedom associated with the heme and the heme-proximal histidine linkage(25Kitagawa T.

John Wiley & Sons, New York1988: 1-37Google Scholar). An absence of a difference between the equilibrium deoxy spectrum and the 10-ns photoproduct spectrum of the CO derivative is indicative of either no difference in the tertiary structures of the deoxy and CO derivatives or no temporally persistent (>10 ns) ligand binding-induced tertiary changes in the photoproduct.In general there appears to be two classes of fast tertiary relaxations in hemeprotein photoproducts. Raman studies on the photodissociated COHbA (29Scott T.W. Friedman J.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 5677-5687Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and COHbI(30Rousseau D.L. Song S. Friedman J.M. Boffi A. Chiancone E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5719-5723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the dimeric Hb from the arcid clam Scapharca inaequivalvis, show that the characteristic time scale for tertiary relaxations involving significant movements of either helices, heme groups, or residues occurs from nanoseconds to microseconds. In HbA the time course for these relaxations are solvent- (29Scott T.W. Friedman J.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 5677-5687Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and viscosity-dependent(31Findsen E.W. Friedman J.M. Ondrias M.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8719-8724Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In contrast to these visco-elastic-type relaxations, there are also faster processes common to both Hbs and Mbs. Initial picosecond time resolved studies on myoglobin (32Findsen E.W. Scott T.W. Chance M.R. Friedman J.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 3355-3357Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and hemoglobin (33Findsen E.W. Friedman J.M. Ondrias M.R. Simon S.R. Science. 1985; 229: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) showed that there is a fast relaxation (≪30 ps) of the heme and the heme-proximal histidine linkage which occurs very much faster than the onset of the nanosecond relaxations. On the basis of these studies, it was proposed (27Friedman J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 232C: 205-246Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 33Findsen E.W. Friedman J.M. Ondrias M.R. Simon S.R.

Phys. 1991; 158: 329-351Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar) that the fast relaxation is an elastic-like solvent-independent relaxation of the iron and proximal histidine that is driven by the repulsive interaction of the proximal imidazole and the heme nitrogens. Although the time dependence of this relaxation appears to be both protein- and solvent-independent, the heme and the heme-proximal histidine conformation at the end of this fast relaxation are strongly dependent upon the overall protein tertiary structure of the initial parent liganded protein(33Findsen E.W. Friedman J.M. Ondrias M.R. Simon S.R. Science. 1985; 229: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Recent femtosecond Raman studies (35Franzen S. Bohn B. Poyart C. DePillis G. Boxer S.G.

Soc. 1989; 111: 3457-3459Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar) strongly support these concepts.Based on the behavior of HbA and Mb as discussed above, it is very likely that the CO binding-induced changes in Ascaris Hb are not the visco-elastic-type tertiary changes that require nanoseconds to microseconds to relax. Instead they are most likely associated with heme changes that respond on the subnanosecond time scale upon photoligand binding in this hemeprotein does not result in large scale tertiary structure changes.The assignments and known conformational and environmental dependencies for several of the Raman bands allow for further comment on some of these ligand binding-induced changes. The absence of change in the W7 tryptophan Fermi doublet at ~1350 cm-1 indicates that there is no change in the exposure to water for any of the tryptophan environments upon ligand binding in the native protein.It is most significant that, for the native protein, upon switching the ligand from CO to O2, the only substantial change in the spectrum involves the hydrogen bond-sensitive (14Austin J.C.

This doublet shows an increase in intensity of approximately 15% and a slight shift to lower frequencies. The presence of seven tyrosines makes an accurate determination of shifts difficult; nonetheless, we attempted to spectrally deconvolute the shifted peak(s) from the unshifted peaks using Lab Calc spectral deconvolution programs. The results, which are clearly fraught with uncertainty, suggest that upon oxygenation, there are spectral components appearing in the Y8a and Y8b bands that are shifted to lower frequencies from the central peaks by approximately 2 and 0.3 cm-1, respectively. Overall these results indicate that the switch in ligand from CO to O2 does not induce, to an appreciable degree, any further conformational changes in the protein other than those reflected in the intensity and frequency changes in the hydrogen bond-sensitive Y8a and Y8b tyrosine bands.The relationship between the hydrogen bonding status of tyrosine and its UV Raman spectroscopic behavior has been studied by examining the spectral response of p-cresol (CH3C6H4OH) (14Austin J.C. Rodgers K.R. Spiro T.G. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 226: 374-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 20Rodgers K.R. Su C. Subramaniam S. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem.

These studies show that the Y8a and Y8b bands exhibit an approximately linear correlation with the strength of the hydrogen bond formed in aprotic solvents. In aprotic solvents, an increase in hydrogen bonding involving the tyrosine phenolic hydrogen lowers the Y8a and Y8b frequency and increases the intensity. In solvents where the hydrogen bonding is to the tyrosine oxygen, the Y8a and Y8b bands both increase in frequency and decrease in intensity relative to values observed for a non-hydrogen-bonding environment. The change in intensity is due to a shift in the tyrosine UV absorption upon change in hydrogen bonding status"

The effect of plasmalopsychosine on neurite outgrowth and its prolonged activation of MAPK was similar to that of nerve growth factor (NGF), and the effect was specific to neuronal cells. Plasmalopsychosine was not capable of competing with cold chase-stable, high affinity binding of NGF to Trk A, indicating that plasmalopsychosine and NGF differ in terms of Trk A-activating mechanism. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors K-252a and staurosporine, known to inhibit the neurotrophic effect of NGF, also inhibited these effects of plasmalopsychosine, suggesting that plasmalopsychosine and NGF share a common signaling cascade. Plasmalopsychosine prevents apoptosis of PC12 cells caused by serum deprivation, indicating that it has “neurotrophic factor-like” activity. Taken together, these findings indicate that plasmalopsychosine may play an important role in development and maintenance of the vertebrate nervous system.
