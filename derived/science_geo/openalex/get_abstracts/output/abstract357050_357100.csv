Here we show that the microtubule motor dynein has a crucial role in polarized transport and in controlling the orientation of axonal microtubules in Drosophila melanogaster dendritic arborization (da) neurons. Changes in organelle distribution within the dendritic arbors of dynein mutant neurons correlate with a proximal shift in dendritic branch position. Dynein is also necessary for the dendrite-specific localization of Golgi outposts and the ion channel Pickpocket. Axonal microtubules are normally oriented uniformly plus-end-distal; however, without dynein, axons contain both plus- and minus-end distal microtubules. These data suggest that dynein is required for the distinguishing properties of the axon and dendrites: without dynein, dendritic organelles and proteins enter the axon and the axonal microtubules are no longer uniform in polarity."

https://openalex.org/W2047660382,"Repeated exposure to cocaine causes sensitized behavioral responses and increased dendritic spines on medium spiny neurons of the nucleus accumbens (NAc). We find that cocaine regulates myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) transcription factors to control these two processes in vivo. Cocaine suppresses striatal MEF2 activity in part through a mechanism involving cAMP, the regulator of calmodulin signaling (RCS), and calcineurin. We show that reducing MEF2 activity in the NAc in vivo is required for the cocaine-induced increases in dendritic spine density. Surprisingly, we find that increasing MEF2 activity in the NAc, which blocks the cocaine-induced increase in dendritic spine density, enhances sensitized behavioral responses to cocaine. Together, our findings implicate MEF2 as a key regulator of structural synapse plasticity and sensitized responses to cocaine and suggest that reducing MEF2 activity (and increasing spine density) in NAc may be a compensatory mechanism to limit long-lasting maladaptive behavioral responses to cocaine."
https://openalex.org/W2117367777,"Results from imaging and lesion studies of item recognition memory have suggested that the hippocampus supports memory for the arbitrary associations that form the basis of episodic recollection, whereas the perirhinal cortex (PRc) supports familiarity for individual items. This view has been challenged, however, by findings showing that PRc may contribute to associative recognition, a task thought to measure relational or recollective memory. Here, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we demonstrate that PRc activity is increased when pairs of items are processed as a single configuration or unit and that this activity predicts subsequent familiarity-based associative memory. These results explain the discrepancy in the literature by showing that novel associations can be encoded in a unitized manner, thereby allowing PRc to support associative recognition based on familiarity."
https://openalex.org/W2123851461,"How the brain uses success and failure to optimize future decisions is a long-standing question in neuroscience. One computational solution involves updating the values of context-action associations in proportion to a reward prediction error. Previous evidence suggests that such computations are expressed in the striatum and, as they are cognitively impenetrable, represent an unconscious learning mechanism. Here, we formally test this by studying instrumental conditioning in a situation where we masked contextual cues, such that they were not consciously perceived. Behavioral data showed that subjects nonetheless developed a significant propensity to choose cues associated with monetary rewards relative to punishments. Functional neuroimaging revealed that during conditioning cue values and prediction errors, generated from a computational model, both correlated with activity in ventral striatum. We conclude that, even without conscious processing of contextual cues, our brain can learn their reward value and use them to provide a bias on decision making."

We used in vitro protein expression and microfluidic affinity analysis to study RNA binding by the HCV transmembrane protein NS4B, which plays an essential role in HCV RNA replication. We show that HCV NS4B binds RNA and that this binding is specific for the 3′ terminus of the negative strand of the viral genome with a dissociation constant (Kd) of ∼3.4 nM. A high-throughput microfluidic screen of a compound library identified 18 compounds that substantially inhibited binding of RNA by NS4B. One of these compounds, clemizole hydrochloride, was found to inhibit HCV RNA replication in cell culture that was mediated by its suppression of NS4B's RNA binding, with little toxicity for the host cell. These results yield new insight into the HCV life cycle and provide a candidate compound for pharmaceutical development."
https://openalex.org/W2164044757,"The visualization at near atomic resolution of transient substrates in the active site of enzymes is fundamental to fully understanding their mechanism of action. Here we show the application of using CO2-pressurized, cryo-cooled crystals to capture the first step of CO2 hydration catalyzed by the zinc-metalloenzyme human carbonic anhydrase II, the binding of substrate CO2, for both the holo and the apo (without zinc) enzyme to 1.1Å resolution. Until now, the feasibility of such a study was thought to be technically too challenging because of the low solubility of CO2 and the fast turnover to bicarbonate by the enzyme (Liang, J. Y., and Lipscomb, W. N. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 87, 3675–3679). These structures provide insight into the long hypothesized binding of CO2 in a hydrophobic pocket at the active site and demonstrate that the zinc does not play a critical role in the binding or orientation of CO2. This method may also have a much broader implication for the study of other enzymes for which CO2 is a substrate or product and for the capturing of transient substrates and revealing hydrophobic pockets in proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2002397361,"This study demonstrates that several microRNA species co-regulate the levels of the ataxin1, a gene implicated in the development of spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1). With ataxin1 dosage contributing to disease severity, this regulation pathway may influence SCA1 progression. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 is caused by expansion of a translated CAG repeat in ataxin1 (ATXN1). The level of the polyglutamine-expanded protein is one of the factors that contributes to disease severity. Here we found that miR-19, miR-101 and miR-130 co-regulate ataxin1 levels and that their inhibition enhanced the cytotoxicity of polyglutamine-expanded ATXN1 in human cells. We provide a new candidate mechanism for modulating the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases sensitive to protein dosage."

https://openalex.org/W2051435398,"The adipocyte-derived hormone leptin maintains energy balance by acting on hypothalamic leptin receptors (Leprs) that act on the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3). Although disruption of Lepr-Stat3 signaling promotes obesity in mice, other features of Lepr function, such as fertility, seem normal, pointing to the involvement of additional regulators. Here we show that the cyclic AMP responsive element-binding protein-1 (Creb1)-regulated transcription coactivator-1 (Crtc1) is required for energy balance and reproduction-Crtc1(-/-) mice are hyperphagic, obese and infertile. Hypothalamic Crtc1 was phosphorylated and inactive in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice, while leptin administration increased amounts of dephosphorylated nuclear Crtc1. Dephosphorylated Crtc1 stimulated expression of the Cartpt and Kiss1 genes, which encode hypothalamic neuropeptides that mediate leptin's effects on satiety and fertility. Crtc1 overexpression in hypothalamic cells increased Cartpt and Kiss1 gene expression, whereas Crtc1 depletion decreased it. Indeed, leptin enhanced Crtc1 activity over the Cartpt and Kiss1 promoters in cells overexpressing Lepr, and these effects were disrupted by expression of a dominant-negative Creb1 polypeptide. As leptin administration increased recruitment of hypothalamic Crtc1 to Cartpt and Kiss1 promoters, our results indicate that the Creb1-Crtc1 pathway mediates the central effects of hormones and nutrients on energy balance and fertility."

Here, we report that FMRP is involved in dopamine (DA) modulation of synaptic potentiation. AMPA glutamate receptor subtype 1 (GluR1) surface expression and phosphorylation in response to D1 receptor stimulation were reduced in cultured Fmr1−/− prefrontal cortex (PFC) neurons. Furthermore, D1 receptor signaling was impaired, accompanied by D1 receptor hyperphosphorylation at serine sites and subcellular redistribution of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) in both PFC and striatum of Fmr1−/− mice. FMRP interacted with GRK2, and pharmacological inhibition of GRK2 rescued D1 receptor signaling in Fmr1−/− neurons. Finally, D1 receptor agonist partially rescued hyperactivity and enhanced the motor function of Fmr1−/− mice.

Dopamine (DA) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a critical role in cognitive functions and neuropsychiatric pathology (Huang et al., 2004Huang Y.Y. Simpson E. Kellendonk C. Kandel E.R.

Understanding the signaling pathways of DA receptor-mediated modulation may provide new insights into the cellular mechanisms underlying various DA-associated mental disorders. Fragile X syndrome is a common inherited mental retardation caused by the lack of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) due to silencing of the FMR1 gene (Feng et al., 1995Feng Y. Zhang F. Lokey L.K. Chastain J.L. Lakkis L. Eberhart D. Warren S.T.

Warren S.T. Transcription, translation and fragile X syndrome.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2006; 16: 270-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that FMRP may act as a local regulator for synaptic plasticity (Bagni and Greenough, 2005Bagni C. Greenough W.T.

Local protein synthesis and spine morphogenesis: Fragile X syndrome and beyond.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 7151-7155Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Previously, we showed that FMRP is critical for NMDA receptor-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) in the cingulate region of the PFC in trace fear memory (Zhao et al., 2005aZhao M.G. Toyoda H. Ko S.W. Ding H.K. Wu L.J. Zhuo M. Deficits in trace fear memory and long-term potentiation in a mouse model for fragile X syndrome.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 7385-7392Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Deficits in activity-dependent synaptic plasticity have also been observed in piriform cortices and the hippocampal CA1 region of Fmr1−/− mice (Larson et al., 2005Larson J. Jessen R.E. Kim D. Fine A.K. du Hoffmann J. Age-dependent and selective impairment of long-term potentiation in the anterior piriform cortex of mice lacking the fragile X mental retardation protein.J.

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor rescues synaptic plasticity in a mouse model of fragile X syndrome.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 10685-10694Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Fragile X syndrome is often accompanied by neuropsychiatric disorders such as hyperactivity, attention disorders, and autism (Bagni and Greenough, 2005Bagni C. Greenough W.T.

Neurosci. 2006; 26: 7151-7155Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), suggesting that the lack of FMRP may affect DA function. However, no link between FMRP and DA modulation has been studied thus far. Here, we employed integrative approaches to demonstrate that FMRP contributes to DA modulation of AMPA glutamate receptor subtype 1 (GluR1) receptor synaptic insertion and dopaminergic facilitation of LTP. We found that the surface expression and phosphorylation of AMPA GluR1 receptors at the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) phosphorylation site induced by stimulating D1 receptors was attenuated in Fmr1−/− PFC neurons. DA-mediated facilitation of LTP was absent in cingulate region of PFC slices of adult Fmr1−/− mice. The hyperphosphorylation of the D1 receptor at serine sites and the increase of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) in the cell membrane contribute to the impairment of D1 receptor signaling in both PFC and striatum of Fmr1−/− mice. FMRP interacts with GRK2, and pharmacological inhibition of GRK2 rescued D1 receptor signaling in Fmr1−/− neurons. DA D1 receptor agonist partially rescued hyperactivity and enhanced the motor function of Fmr1−/− mice. These findings provide direct evidence that FMRP acts as a key messenger for DA receptor-mediated modulation in forebrain neurons. DA transmission is mediated by five G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) classified as either D1-type (D1 and D5 subtypes) or D2-type (D2–D4 subtypes) (Missale et al., 1998Missale C. Nash S.R. Robinson S.W. Jaber M. Caron M.G. Dopamine receptors: from structure to function.Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 189-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (2575) Google Scholar, Seamans and Yang, 2004Seamans J.K. Yang C.R. The principal features and mechanisms of dopamine modulation in the prefrontal cortex.Prog. Neurobiol. 2004; 74: 1-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar). In cultured rat cortical neurons, DA D1 receptors are positively coupled to the PKA signaling pathway through Gs proteins and contribute to AMPA GluR1 receptor trafficking (Sun et al., 2005Sun X. Zhao Y. Wolf M.E. Dopamine receptor stimulation modulates AMPA receptor synaptic insertion in prefrontal cortex neurons.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 7342-7351Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). To determine whether DA also affects AMPA receptor functions in mouse PFC neurons, we treated cultured PFC neurons with the D1 receptor agonists SKF81297 and dihydrexidine or the D2 receptor agonists quinpirole and bromocriptine. Neither D1 nor D2 receptor agonists affected the total expression levels of GluR1 or GluR2/3 in cultures (see Figures S1A and S1B available online). Surface expression of GluR1 was increased after treatment with D1 receptor agonists but was decreased by D2 receptor agonists (p < 0.01 versus control, n = 4 dishes; Figure 1A). Surface expression of GluR2 and 3 was unchanged (Figure S1C). The effect of D1 receptor agonists on GluR1 surface expression was blocked by the D1 receptor antagonist SCH23390 (Figure 1B). The D1 receptor agonist SKF81297 increased GluR1 surface expression in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1C). These findings demonstrate that D1 receptor activation can facilitate the surface expression of AMPA GluR1 receptors. The phosphorylation of the AMPA receptor GluR1 subunit plays a key role in its synaptic expression and synaptic plasticity (Esteban et al., 2003Esteban J.A. Shi S.H. Wilson C. Nuriya M. Huganir R.L.

Regulation of phosphorylation of the GluR1 AMPA receptor in the neostriatum by dopamine and psychostimulants in vivo.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4480-4488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We studied the phosphorylation of GluR1 by DA receptor activation at two sites: the PKA phosphorylation site at Ser845, and the PKC or calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) phosphorylation site at Ser831 (Man et al., 2007Man H.Y. Sekine-Aizawa Y. Huganir R.L. Regulation of {alpha}-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor trafficking through PKA phosphorylation of the Glu receptor 1 subunit.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 3579-3584Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, Snyder et al., 2000Snyder G.L. Allen P.B. Fienberg A.A. Valle C.G. Huganir R.L. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Regulation of phosphorylation of the GluR1 AMPA receptor in the neostriatum by dopamine and psychostimulants in vivo.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4480-4488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We compared the effect of D1 or D2 receptor agonists on the phosphorylation of GluR1 in cultured neurons and found that the phosphorylation of GluR1 at Ser845 was increased by D1 receptor agonists and decreased by D2 receptor agonists (p < 0.01 versus control, n = 4 dishes; Figure 1D). In contrast, the phosphorylation level of GluR1 at Ser831 was not affected by either D1 or D2 receptor agonists (Figure 1E). The effect of D1 receptor agonists on the phosphorylation of GluR1 was blocked by the D1 receptor antagonist SCH23390 (Figure 1F), further supporting the idea that D1 receptor activation can induce phosphorylation of AMPA GluR1 at Ser845. To investigate the role of FMRP in DA receptor signaling, we tested the effects of the D1 agonist SKF81297 on GluR1 in cultured PFC neurons of Fmr1−/− mice. We found that the surface expression of GluR1 triggered by SKF81297 in Fmr1−/− PFC neurons was impaired compared to that of wild-type (WT) mice (WT, 2.25 ± 0.08; Fmr1−/−, 1.42 ± 0.05; p < 0.05, n = 6 dishes; Figure 2A). SKF81297 did not affect the total expression of GluR1 and GluR2/3 receptors in WT or Fmr1−/− neurons (Figures S2A and S2B). However, no difference in the total expression levels of GluR1 and GluR2/3 receptors was found between WT and Fmr1−/− neurons under basal conditions (Figures S2A and S2B). Furthermore, there was no change in the surface expression of GluR1 and GluR2/3 receptors between WT and Fmr1−/− neurons under basal conditions (Figure 2A; Figure S2C). These results provide direct evidence that FMRP is involved in DA receptor signaling and contributes to GluR1 surface expression induced by D1 receptor activation. We next compared the D1 receptor agonist-triggered phosphorylation of GluR1 in WT and Fmr1−/− neurons. While there was no difference in the basal phosphorylation of GluR1 at both Ser845 and Ser831 (Figures 2B and 2C), the increased phosphorylation of GluR1 receptors at Ser845 induced by D1 activation was almost abolished in Fmr1−/− neurons (WT, 2.33 ± 0.09; Fmr1−/−, 1.40 ± 0.05; p < 0.05, n = 6 dishes; Figure 2B). The effect of FMRP deletion was relatively selective. SKF81297 did not affect the phosphorylation of GluR1 at Ser831 in Fmr1−/− neurons (Figure 2C). We also found that the expression levels of D1 receptors in cultured PFC neurons of Fmr1−/− mice were similar to that of WT mice (Figure 2D). The homomeric GluR1 AMPA receptor has a faster decay time than heteromeric GluR2 AMPA receptors (Thiagarajan et al., 2005Thiagarajan T.C. Lindskog M. Tsien R.W. Adaptation to synaptic inactivity in hippocampal neurons.Neuron. 2005; 47: 725-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). During electrophysiological recordings in cultured neurons, bath application of SKF81297 caused a significant decrease in the decay time of AMPA miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) (2.56 ± 0.31 ms, n = 12 cells; p < 0.05 versus control, 3.15 ± 0.15 ms, n = 12 cells) in WT PFC neurons, whereas the decay time was unchanged in Fmr1−/− mice (Figures S3A–S3C). These data provide functional evidence that synaptic GluR1 trafficking is altered by D1 receptor activation and that FMRP is required for DA-triggered GluR1 insertion. FMRP can be rapidly translated in an activity-dependent manner (Hou et al., 2006Hou L. Antion M.D. Hu D. Spencer C.M. Paylor R. Klann E.

USA. 2004; 101: 17504-17509Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). PSD-95, a key scaffolding protein involved in synaptic plasticity, modulates DA-mediated phosphorylation of AMPA receptors (Swayze et al., 2004Swayze R.D. Lise M.F. Levinson J.N. Phillips A. El-Husseini A. Modulation of dopamine mediated phosphorylation of AMPA receptors by PSD-95 and AKAP79/150.Neuropharmacology. 2004; 47: 764-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). FMRP contributes to group I metabotropic glutamate receptor-dependent translation of PSD-95 (Todd et al., 2003Todd P.K. Mack K.J. Malter J.S. The fragile X mental retardation protein is required for type-I metabotropic glutamate receptor-dependent translation of PSD-95.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 14374-14378Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). We found that neither FMRP nor PSD-95 expression levels were altered in cultured PFC neurons following D1 receptor activation (Figures S3D and S3E), indicating that D1 receptor activation does not affect FMRP or PSD-95 expression. The PFC, including its cingulate region, plays an important role in learning and memory, drug addiction, and pain (Courtney et al., 1998Courtney S.M. Petit L. Maisog J.M. Ungerleider L.G. Haxby J.V.

Today. 2002; 7: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To further test the effect of D1 receptor activation on synaptic plasticity, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in visually identified pyramidal neurons in the cingulate region of PFC slices from adult WT mice. Bath application of the D1 receptor agonist SKF81297 had no effect on basal synaptic transmission (105.7% ± 7.0%, n = 9 cells; Figure 3A). We next paired D1 agonist application with an LTP induction protocol and found that bath application of SKF81297 for 10 min paired with the LTP induction protocol significantly enhanced the amplitude of LTP (176.4% ± 11.3%, n = 9 cells; p < 0.05 versus pairing training only; Figures 3B and 3C), suggesting that D1 receptor activation can facilitate LTP induction. However, the enhancing effect of SKF81297 was abolished in Fmr1−/− mice (114.1% ± 5.8%, n = 13 cells; p > 0.05 versus baseline responses; Figures 3B and 3C), demonstrating that dopaminergic facilitation of LTP is impaired in Fmr1−/− mice and that FMRP is required for dopaminergic facilitation of LTP. Both presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms contribute to LTP expression (Kandel, 2001Kandel E.R. The molecular biology of memory storage: a dialogue between genes and synapses.Science. 2001; 294: 1030-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (2550) Google Scholar, Malinow and Malenka, 2002Malinow R.

Regulation of AMPA receptors during synaptic plasticity.Trends Neurosci. 2002; 25: 578-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). To determine whether presynaptic and/or postsynaptic mechanisms are involved in dopaminergic modulation of LTP, we measured paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) before and after perfusion of the D1 receptor agonist SKF81297 and LTP induction. The PPF (50 ms interval) was not altered (Figures S4A–S4C), suggesting that facilitation of LTP by D1 receptor activation in PFC likely depends on postsynaptic mechanisms. To confirm the role of GluR1 receptors in the facilitation of LTP by D1 receptor activation, we tested the effects of the GluR1 C-terminal peptide analog Pep1-TGL, which has been shown to interfere with GluR1-related synaptic potentiation (Hayashi et al., 2000Hayashi Y. Shi S.H. Esteban J.A. Piccini A. Poncer J.C. Malinow R. Driving AMPA receptors into synapses by LTP and CaMKII: requirement for GluR1 and PDZ domain interaction.Science. 2000; 287: 2262-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). Pep1-TGL has no effect on the basal AMPA receptor-mediated EPSCs (Toyoda et al., 2007Toyoda H. Wu L.J. Zhao M.G. Xu H. Zhuo M. Time-dependent postsynaptic AMPA GluR1 receptor recruitment in the cingulate synaptic potentiation.Dev. Neurobiol. 2007; 67: 498-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, the facilitatory effects of SKF81297 on LTP were diminished by intracellular application of Pep1-TGL (Figure 3D), suggesting that incorporation of homomeric GluR1 receptors plays a critical role in the facilitation of LTP by D1 receptor activation. We also measured the effects of SKF81297 on NMDA receptor-mediated responses and found that bath application of SKF81297 did not affect NMDA EPSCs (Figure 3E). Therefore, the facilitation of LTP by D1 receptor activation is not likely due to its direct modulation of NMDA receptors. In addition, there was no difference in the expression levels of D1 receptors in PFC slices between WT and Fmr1−/− mice (Figure 3F), and the affinity of D1 receptor agonist was not changed in PFC of Fmr1−/− mice (Figure 3G). Thus, the impairment of DA-induced facilitation of synaptic potentiation is not due to a defect in D1 receptors. D1 receptors preferentially couple to Gs proteins, stimulating the activity of adenylyl cyclases (ACs) and PKA pathways (Huang and Kandel, 1995Huang Y.Y. Kandel E.R. D1/D5 receptor agonists induce a protein synthesis-dependent late potentiation in the CA1 region of the hippocampus.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1995; 92: 2446-2450Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, Missale et al., 1998Missale C. Nash S.R. Robinson S.W. Jaber M. Caron M.G. Dopamine receptors: from structure to function.Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 189-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (2575) Google Scholar). We determined the effect of the D1 receptor agonist SKF81297 on ACs with a cAMP assay and found that the increase in cAMP caused by SKF81297 was attenuated in both PFC neuronal cultures and slices from Fmr1−/− mice (p < 0.01, n = 6; Figures 4A and 4B). However, there was no difference in cAMP increase caused by the AC activator forskolin between Fmr1−/− and WT mice (Figures 4A and 4B). These data indicate that the coupling between D1 receptors and ACs is impaired, whereas the activity of ACs is not affected in PFC of Fmr1−/− mice. To address whether D1 receptor coupling is specifically affected in Fmr1−/− mice, we investigated the effect of AS19, a selective 5-HT7 receptor agonist (Perez-Garcia and Meneses, 2005Perez-Garcia G.S. Meneses A. Effects of the potential 5-HT7 receptor agonist AS 19 in an autoshaping learning task.Behav. Brain Res. 2005; 163: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), in cultured PFC neurons and PFC slices from Fmr1−/− mice. We found that the cAMP increase caused by AS19 in Fmr1−/− mice was similar to that of WT mice (Figures S5A and S5B). These findings indicate that the 5-HT7 receptor-cAMP pathway is normal and that the D1 receptor signaling pathway is selectively affected in the PFC of Fmr1−/− mice. We then checked the expression and function of Gαs protein in Fmr1−/− mice and found no difference in the basal levels of Gαs protein in the PFC between Fmr1−/− and WT mice (Figure 4C). In addition, the increase in cAMP level caused by the G protein activators GTP-γ-S or NaF was not affected in PFC slices of Fmr1−/− mice compared to WT mice (Figure 4D). These results indicate that the expression and function of Gαs protein are not affected in PFC of Fmr1−/− mice. We next investigated the coupling of D1 receptors to Gαs by coimmunoprecipitation (Jones et al., 2000Jones L.B. Stanwood G.D. Reinoso B.S. Washington R.A. Wang H.Y. Friedman E. Levitt P. In utero cocaine-induced dysfunction of dopamine D1 receptor signaling and abnormal differentiation of cerebral cortical neurons.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4606-4614PubMed Google Scholar). We found that coupling of D1 receptors to Gs protein remained unchanged under basal conditions in PFC slices of Fmr1−/− mice (Figures 4E and 4F). In contrast, the D1 receptor agonist SKF81297 increased the coupling of D1 receptors to Gαs protein in PFC slices of WT mice. Interestingly, the increase induced by SKF81297 was attenuated in Fmr1−/− mice (p < 0.01 versus WT, n = 4 mice; Figures 4E and 4F), indicating that coupling of D1 receptors to Gαs protein due to D1 receptor activation is impaired in PFC of Fmr1−/− mice. D1 receptor phosphorylation modulates its interaction with Gs proteins (Gainetdinov et al., 2004Gainetdinov R.R. Premont R.T. Bohn L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Desensitization of G protein-coupled receptors and neuronal functions.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 27: 107-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, Missale et al., 1998Missale C. Nash S.R. Robinson S.W. Jaber M. Caron M.G. Dopamine receptors: from structure to function.Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 189-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (2575) Google Scholar). Here, we found that D1 receptor phosphorylation at serine sites was increased in PFC of Fmr1−/− mice relative to WT mice (185.0% ± 15.3% of WT; p < 0.01, n = 4 mice; Figure 4G), whereas the phosphorylation at tyrosine sites was not changed (Figure 4G). These data reveal that D1 receptors are hyperphosphorylated in PFC of Fmr1−/− mice, which might account for the impaired coupling of D1 receptors to Gs protein in Fmr1−/− mice. GRKs phosphorylate GPCRs and modulate the efficacy of GPCR signaling pathways (Gainetdinov et al., 2004Gainetdinov R.R. Premont R.T. Bohn L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Desensitization of G protein-coupled receptors and neuronal functions.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 27: 107-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, Premont and Gainetdinov, 2007Premont R.T. Gainetdinov R.R. Physiological roles of G protein-coupled receptor kinases and arrestins.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2007; 69: 511-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that DA receptors can be phosphorylated by GRKs (Gainetdinov et al., 2004Gainetdinov R.R. Premont R.T. Bohn L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Desensitization of G protein-coupled receptors and neuronal functions.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 27: 107-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, Premont and Gainetdinov, 2007Premont R.T. Gainetdinov R.R. Physiological roles of G protein-coupled receptor kinases and arrestins.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2007; 69: 511-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). We investigated the expression of GRKs in PFC and found that the total expression levels of GRK2 and GRK4–6 were not changed in PFC of Fmr1−/− mice compared to WT mice (Figure 4H). Interestingly, the level of GRK2 in cell membrane preparation was increased, whereas it was decreased in cytosol preparation from PFC of Fmr1−/− mice compared to WT mice (p < 0.01, n = 4 mice; Figures 4I and 4J). However, the levels of GRK4–6 in both membrane and cytosol preparations were not changed (Figures 4I and 4J). These results suggest that D1 receptor hyperphosphorylation might be caused by subcellular redistribution of GRK2 in PFC neurons of Fmr1−/− mice and that GRK2 may be a key isoform of GRKs responsible for the impaired D1 receptor signaling in Fmr1−/− mice. FMRP interacts physically with other proteins (Hayashi et al., 2007Hayashi M.L. Rao B.S. Seo J.S. Choi H.S. Dolan B.M. Choi S.Y. Chattarji S. Tonegawa S.

In contrast, FMRP did not interact with GRK4–6, D1 receptors, Gαs, GluR1, or 5-HT7 receptors (Figure 5B). The interaction between FMRP and GRK2 was not due to nonspecific binding of antibodies, as shown in Figure 5C. FMRP was not present in the cell membrane, and the interaction between FMRP and GRK2 was only detected in the cytosol preparation of PFC (Figure 5D). Furthermore, we"

In this study the ability of the human cathelicidin LL-37 to stimulate fibroblast growth was inhibited by commonly used P2X7 blockers. We investigated the structural requirements of the growth-promoting activity of LL-37 and found that it did not depend on helix sense (the all-d analog was active) but did require a strong helix-forming propensity in aqueous solution (a scrambled analog and primate LL-37 orthologs devoid of this property were inactive). The involvement of P2X7 was analyzed using P2X7-expressing HEK293 cells. LL-37 induced proliferation of these cells, triggered Ca2+ influx, promoted ethidium bromide uptake, and synergized with benzoyl ATP to enhance the pore and channel functions of P2X7. The activity of LL-37 had an absolute requirement for P2X7 expression as it was blocked by the P2X7 inhibitor KN-62, was absent in cells lacking P2X7, and was restored by P2X7 transfection. Of particular interest, LL-37 led to pore-forming activity in cells expressing a truncated P2X7 receptor unable to generate the non-selective pore typical of the full-length receptor. Our results indicate that P2X7 is involved in the proliferative cell response to LL-37 and that the structural/aggregational properties of LL-37 determine its capacity to modulate the activation state of P2X7.

Our results indicate that P2X7 is involved in the proliferative cell response to LL-37 and that the structural/aggregational properties of LL-37 determine its capacity to modulate the activation state of P2X7. P2X7 is an ATP-activated ion channel expressed by lymphocytes, dendritic cells, macrophages/microglia, and non-hematopoietic cells, including human primary fibroblasts (1Solini A. Chiozzi P. Morelli A. Fellin R. Di Virgilio F. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 297-305Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of P2X7 causes massive calcium entry often followed by cell death (2Ferrari D. Chiozzi P. Falzoni S. Dal Susino M. Collo G. Buell G. Di Virgilio F. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1295-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Cytotoxicity is likely due to the opening of a large, non-selective pore either intrinsic to or associated with P2X7, which permeabilizes the plasma membrane to molecules of mass up to 900 Da (3Steinberg T.H.

In the immune system, ATP released by infected or stressed cells at sites of inflammation acts as a danger or alert signal. Among the many cellular receptors activated by extracellular ATP, P2X7 has been implicated in inhibition of infection by intracellular pathogens (7Darville T. Welter-Stahl L. Cruz C. Sater A.A. Andrews Jr., C.W. Ojcius D.M. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 3707-3714Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), in the processing and release of cytokines such as IL-1β, and in the modulation of cell death via apoptotic and necrotic pathways (8Lister M.F. Sharkey J. Sawatzky D.A. Hodgkiss J.P. Davidson D.J. Rossi A.G. Finlayson K. J. Inflamm. (Lond.). 2007; 4: 5Crossref Scopus (203) Google Scholar). As such, it appears to be an important player in inflammation. Antimicrobial host defense peptides have long been recognized as vital components of the innate immune system that provide an endogenous first line of defense against microbial infection by wielding a direct toxic activity against a wide range of microorganisms (9Zasloff M. Nature. 2002; 415: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (6742) Google Scholar). This role has more recently broadened from that of endogenous antibiotics to multifunctional modulators of defense responses (10Zanetti M. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2004; 75: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar) and early warning signals, or “alarmins” (11Oppenheim J.J. Yang D. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2005; 17: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Two evolutionarily distinct families of such peptides in particular, the defensins and the cathelicidins, are found in mammals and are either constitutively expressed or readily inducible upon infection, inflammation, or injury (12Frohm M. Agerberth B. Ahangari G. Stahle-Backdahl M. Liden S. Wigzell H. Gudmundsson G.H. J. Biol.

They are diverse in length, sequence, and secondary structure, but all tend to adopt amphipathic conformations and are cationic at physiological pH (14Tomasinsig L. Zanetti M. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2005; 6: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). These features account for their ability to bind avidly to the negatively charged bacterial surface and to perturb membrane organization, thus leading to microbial killing. hCAP-18/LL-37 is the only cathelicidin present in humans and is stored in the specific granules of neutrophils (15Sorensen O. Arnljots K. Cowland J.B. Bainton D.F. Borregaard N. Blood. 1997; 90: 2796-2803Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in lymphocytes and macrophages (16Agerberth B. Charo J. Werr J. Olsson B. Idali F.

Wewers M.D. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 4987-4994Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) through activation of P2X7. In this study we found that P2X7 was also involved in the growth-promoting activity of LL-37 as shown using murine fibroblasts and human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells stably transfected with human P2X7 cDNA. By analyzing the functional interaction of LL-37 with P2X7, we found that LL-37 triggered Ca2+ influx and ethidium bromide uptake in HEK293 cells expressing P2X7 but not in mock-transfected cells. Furthermore it strongly potentiated the agonist-dependent responses in HEK293-hP2X7 cells. Activation of P2X7 by LL-37 was strictly dependent on the helix-forming propensity of LL-37 in aqueous solution and was independent of helix sense. Finally LL-37 restored pore-forming activity in cells expressing a truncated P2X7 receptor that is by itself unable to generate the non-selective pore typical of full-length P2X7. Our results indicate that expression of the P2X7 receptor is necessary for LL-37-dependent cell activation and suggest that several other reported activities of LL-37 are mediated by P2X7 activation. Reagents—Derivatized (peptide amide linker-) polyethylene glycol-polystyrene resins, coupling reagents for peptide synthesis, and Fmoc-amino acids were purchased from Applied Biosystems, Novabiochem, and ChemImpex. Peptide synthesis grade N,N-dimethylformamide, dichloromethane, piperidine, and high pressure liquid chromatography grade acetonitrile were from Biosolve. Trifluoroacetic acid, N-methylmorpholine, and triethylamine were from Acros Chimica. ATP, BzATP, oxidized ATP, KN-62, BBG, PPADS, Reactive Blue, MTT, ethidium bromide (EB), and digitonin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. YO-PRO-1 and fura-2/AM were from Molecular Probes. Cell culture media and supplements were from Euroclone. All other reagents were of analytical grade. Buffers were prepared in double glass-distilled water. Peptide Synthesis and Characterization—Peptides were chemically synthesized by Fmoc solid-phase peptide synthesis on a Milligen 9050 or Pioneer automated synthesizer (Applied Biosystems). Difficult coupling steps were carried out as described previously (20Zelezetsky I. Pontillo A. Puzzi L. Antcheva N. Segat L. Pacor S. Crovella S. Tossi A. J. Biol.

Chemother. 2003; 51: 843-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The correct identity of the peptides was confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry using an API I instrument (PerkinElmer Sciex). Peptide concentrations were determined by measuring the absorbance at 257 nm of Phe residues (primate and scrambled LL-37 peptides) and the absorbance at 280 nm of Tyr and Trp residues for BMAP-28 and confirmed by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce). The relative amphipathicity (μHrel) of peptides was calculated using the peptide sequence analysis tool HydroMCalc available on line. Structuring was probed by circular dichroism spectroscopy at 20 μm peptide concentration using a Jasco J-600 spectropolarimeter and 2-mm-path length quartz cells. Peptides were dissolved in PIL buffer (113 mm NaCl, 24 mm NaHCO3, 0.6 mm MgCl2, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 3.9 mm KCl, pH 7.3), in DMEM, or in SDS (10 mm SDS in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4). All spectra are the mean of at least two trials, each with the accumulation of three scans. Helical content was estimated from the ellipticity at 222 nm according to Chen et al. (32Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Chau K.H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3350-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1963) Google Scholar). Cell Cultures—NIH 3T3 murine fibroblastic cells were cultured under 5% CO2 at 37 °C as exponentially growing subconfluent monolayers in DMEM. HEK293 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in DMEM/Ham's F-12. All media were supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. HEK293 transfection with full-length or COOH-truncated P2X7 receptor lacking residues 415–595 was carried out with Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Selection was performed in the presence of G418. Assessment of Cell Proliferation and Membrane Permeabilization—NIH 3T3 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 104 cells/cm2 and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in complete DMEM. The cell culture medium was then replaced with DMEM containing 0.5% FCS, and the incubation was prolonged for 48 h. After this time, fewer than 5% of cells were found to actively replicate their DNA as assessed by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation (33Tomasinsig L. Skerlavaj B. Papo N. Giabbai B. Shai Y. Zanetti M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 383-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Growth-arrested cells were incubated in DMEM containing 2% FCS in the absence or presence of selected peptides. To determine cell numbers, 0.5 mg/ml MTT was added to the culture media after 24 h, and cells were incubated for an additional 3 h. Cells were then lysed with isopropanol, and the absorbance at 570 nm was recorded. Cell proliferation in the presence of each peptide was expressed as percentage of the control value, corresponding to untreated cells. HEK293 cells stably expressing human P2X7 (HEK293hP2X7) or mock-transfected cells (HEK293-mock) were plated in triplicate in a polylysine-pretreated 6-well plate at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well and incubated overnight at 37 °C in complete DMEM/Ham's F-12. HEK293-hP2X7 cells were transfected for the P2X7-silencing experiment 2 h after plating. The following day medium was changed with DMEM/Ham's F-12 in the absence of fetal calf serum, and cells were counted in phase-contrast light with a Nikon Eclipse TE 300 inverted microscope (Nikon) (considered as time 0) and stimulated with the indicated peptides. Cell proliferation was evaluated 24 h later as a percentage of the untreated cells taken as a control. To monitor plasma membrane permeability changes, NIH 3T3 cells were incubated for 90 min at 37 °C in DMEM plus 2% FCS in the absence or presence of each peptide at 5 μm. The activity of lactate dehydrogenase, a cytosolic enzyme, in cell-free media and cell lysates, respectively, was measured using the CytoTox 96® Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay (Promega). Lactate dehydrogenase activity in the culture media was expressed as percentage of total cellular lactate dehydrogenase activity. RNA Interference—Suppression of human pannexin-1 expression was obtained by transfecting HEK293 cells stably expressing truncated rat P2X7 (HEK293-rP2X7ΔC) with 150 pmol of a Silencer® Select Predesigned siRNA (identification number s24426, Ambion). The Silencer Select Negative Control siRNA (identification number 4390843, Ambion) was used as negative control. RNA interference against human P2X7 was obtained by transfecting cells with 200 pmol of a custom siRNA purchased from Ambion (sense strand, 5′-CUACACCACGAGAAACAUCtt-3′; antisense strand, 5′-GAUGUUUCUCGUGGUGUAGtt-3′). A custom scrambled siRNA (scr hP2X7) (sense strand, 5′-CAACACCACUAGAAGCAUCtt-3′; antisense strand, 5′-GAUGCUUCUAGUGGUGUUGtt-3′) was used as negative control. Transfections were performed using the Lipofectamine 2000 protocol. Briefly 5 × 106 cells were plated onto a 10-cm culture dish 2 h before siRNA transfections and incubated for 48 h at 37 °C before experiments. Protein expression levels of pannexin-1 and P2X7 were determined by Western blot. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were resuspended in a lysis buffer containing 300 mm sucrose, 1 mm K2HPO4, 1 mm MgSO4, 5.5 mm glucose, 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 μg of deoxyribonuclease, 0.2 μg of ribonuclease and subjected to three freeze/thawing cycles. Proteins were separated on a 7.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel (pannexin-1 blots) or a 4–12% NuPAGE bis-Tris precast gel (Invitrogen) for P2X7 blots. The rabbit polyclonal anti-P2X7 receptor antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) was used at a dilution of 1:200, and the rabbit polyclonal antibody against human pannexin-1 (Abcam) was used at a dilution of 1:1000 in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0. The primary antibody was revealed by protein A conjugated to horseradish peroxidase at a dilution of 1:3000. Densitometric analysis was done by Eastman Kodak Co. 1D Image Analysis Software. The density of bands was expressed as net intensity, which is the sum of the background-subtracted pixel value within the region of interest. Ethidium Bromide and YO-PRO-1 Uptake—Ethidium bromide and YO-PRO-1 are commonly used markers of P2X7-mediated permeabilization of the plasma membrane to low molecular mass aqueous solutes. EB uptake was monitored by stimulating HEK293 cells (5 × 105/ml) in standard saline solution (125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 20 mm Hepes, 5.5 mm glucose, 5 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4), in the presence of 20 μm EB. At the end of the experiment 100 μm digitonin was added to obtain 100% membrane permeabilization. Changes in plasma membrane permeability were monitored at the excitation/emission wavelengths of 360/580 nm. YO-PRO-1 uptake was measured by suspending NIH 3T3 cells in a low ionic strength saline solution (1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm K2HPO4, 5.5 mm glucose, 300 mm saccharose, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) containing 250 μm sulfinpyrazone and 1 μm YO-PRO-1 and incubating cells at 37 °C in the absence or presence of P2X7 blockers. Cells were then challenged with BzATP for 30 min at 37 °C. After washing with saline containing 2% FCS, cells were suspended in FCS-free saline for analysis. Samples were analyzed with a flow cytometer equipped with the Cell Quest software using a 488 nm argon ion laser as the excitation source (FACScan, BD Biosciences). A minimum of 10,000 events per sample was analyzed. Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from NIH 3T3 cells using the RNAqueous® kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After treatment with DNA-free™ (Ambion) to remove contaminating DNA, 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed for 2 h at 42 °C with 200 units of SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT) adaptor primers. PCR amplification was performed in a total volume of 25 μl including 0.5 units of EuroTaq DNA polymerase (Euroclone) and 5 μl of 1:10 diluted reverse transcription sample. After 10 min at 94 °C, 35 cycles were performed with the following program: 30 s at 94 °C, 40 s at 60 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C. Primer sequences, designed on the basis of the published sequences of the murine P2X7 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase genes, were as follows: for P2X7, 5′-GGCAGTTCAGGGAGGAATCATGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAAGCGCCAGGTGGCGTAGCAC-3′ (reverse); and for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-TGATGACATCAAGAAGGTGGTGGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCCTTGGAGGCCATGTAGGCCAT-3′ (reverse). PCR products were analyzed in a 1.5% agarose gel, and their sizes were compared with a 100-bp DNA ladder (New England Biolabs). Intracellular Ca2+ Measurement—HEK293 cells (107/ml) were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min in standard saline solution containing 250 μm sulfinpyrazone in the presence of 4 μm fura-2/AM (34Di Virgilio F. Milani D. Leon A. Meldolesi J. Pozzan T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9189-9195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Di Virgilio F. Steinberg T.H. Silverstein S.C. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Cells were then washed in the same saline solution, and experiments were performed in a thermostatted, magnetically stirred cuvette by using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50 fluorometer. Intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) transients were monitored using the 340/380 nm excitation ratio at an emission wavelength of 505 nm. [Ca2+]i changes are reported as [Ca2+]i increases over basal (Δ[Ca2+]i). The Fibroblast Proliferation-inducing Activity of LL-37 Depends on the Propensity of LL-37 to Structure in Aqueous Solution—First we investigated the ability of LL-37 to induce fibroblast proliferation using murine NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. Growth-arrested NIH 3T3 cells were incubated for 24 h with LL-37 at peptide concentrations similar to those reported to promote keratinocyte proliferation (26Heilborn J.D. Nilsson M.F. Jimenez C.I.

Cell numbers increased in a peptide concentration-dependent manner; the highest activity was achieved at 5 μm LL-37. At this peptide concentration the cell number increment was comparable to that induced by 10% FCS (Fig. 1A). LL-37 was ineffective at 10 μm (not shown) possibly due to a significant cytotoxicity (over 20% release of the cytoplasmic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase) at this peptide concentration. The structural determinants of the cell growth-promoting activity of LL-37 were investigated by testing in parallel the all-d LL-37 enantiomer, a non-amphipathic scrambled version of LL-37 showing a residue content and net positive charge (+6) otherwise identical to LL-37, and the helical bovine cathelicidin BMAP-28 (37Skerlavaj B.

Only all-d LL-37 exhibited proliferation-inducing activity comparable to that of the natural LL-37 peptide at concentrations up to 5 μm, whereas BMAP-28 was ineffective or toxic in the range of concentrations used (Fig. 1A).TABLE 1Sequences and structuring properties of the peptides under studyPeptideSequenceChargeμHrelPercent helixPILDMEMSDS%LL-37LLGDFFRKSKEKIGKEFKRIVQRIKDFLRNLVPRTES+60.5928.533.530.3ppy LL-37LLGDFFRKAREKIGEEFKRIVQRIKDFLRNLVPRTES+40.5941.451.731.5hmd SL-37SLGNFFRKARKKIGEEFKRIVQRIKDFLQHLIPRTEA+60.6024.926.336.8mmu RL-37RLGNFFRKVKEKIGGGLKKVGQKIKDFLGNLVPRTAS+80.56<4<4NDpob RL-37RLGNFFRKAKKKIGRGLKKIGQKIKDFLGNLVPRTES+100.62<4<427.5All-d LL-37LLGDFFRKSKEKIGKEFKRIVQRIKDFLRNLVPRTES+60.5927.532.935.0Scrambled LL-37DKWVSSFIREILKRRGKKREKKPQNLGFFITDEFLRL+60.205.48.516.0BMAP-28GGLRSLGRKILRAWKKYGPIIVPIIRI+70.608.29.337.6 Open table in a new tab The results obtained with all-d LL-37 argued against a chiral specificity for binding to cellular target(s), whereas a degree of sequence specificity was indicated by the inability of scrambled LL-37 or BMAP-28 to induce cell proliferation. The latter two peptides showed a significantly lower helix-forming propensity in aqueous solutions compared with native and all-d LL-37. Based on circular dichroism measurements, LL-37 and all-d LL-37 adopted well defined α-helical structures in physiological salt medium (PIL) and in DMEM (Table 1) because of the stabilizing effects of intramolecular salt bridging (19Johansson J. Gudmundsson G.H. Rottenberg M.E. Berndt K.D. Agerberth B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3718-3724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). BMAP-28 instead assumed this secondary structure only in the presence of membrane-mimicking SDS micelles, and scrambled LL-37 showed scarce propensity to structure under any condition (Table 1). These observations suggested that the amino acid sequence and/or the stable conformation of LL-37 in solution are important determinants of its activity. We further investigated this issue by testing the proliferative potential of LL-37 orthologs from other primate species that showed subtle variations in sequence, charge, charged residue arrangement, and thus also helix-forming propensity (20Zelezetsky I.

Among these, ppy LL-37 (orangutan, Pongo pygmaeus) and hmd LL-37 (gibbon, Hylobates moloch) resembled LL-37 in that they adopted amphipathic helical structures not only in the presence of membrane-mimicking environments but also in PIL and in DMEM.

https://openalex.org/W2064893357,"Hypomethylation of repeated elements in the genome is a common feature of human cancer, however, the direct consequences of this epigenetic defect for cancer biology are still largely unknown. Telomeres are specialized chromatin structures at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes formed by tandem repeats of G-rich sequences and associated proteins, which have an essential role in chromosome end protection and genomic stability. Telomeric DNA repeats cannot be methylated, however, the adjacent subtelomeric DNA is heavily methylated in humans. Here, we show that the methylation status of subtelomeric DNA repeats negatively correlates with telomere length and telomere recombination in a large panel of human cancer cell lines. These findings suggest that tumor telomere length and integrity can be influenced by epigenetic factors. Finally, we show that treatment of human cancer cell lines with demethylating drugs results in hypomethylation of subtelomeric repeats and increased telomere recombination, which in turn may facilitate telomere elongation. All together, these findings suggest that tumor telomere length and integrity can be influenced by the epigenetic status of cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2035394593,"Ras family genes are common targets for somatic mutations in human cancer: KRAS is frequently mutated in lung carcinomas, whereas HRAS mutations are common in skin tumors. Allan Balmain and colleagues use genetic engineering of ras genes in mice to show that specificity for ras mutations is determined by local regulatory elements, and that Kras 4A is the major oncogenic isoform of Kras. Kras is the most frequently mutated ras family member in lung carcinomas1,2, whereas Hras mutations are common in tumors from stratified epithelia such as the skin. Using a Hras knock-in mouse model3, we demonstrate that specificity for Kras mutations in lung and Hras mutations in skin tumors is determined by local regulatory elements in the target ras genes. Although the Kras 4A isoform is dispensable for mouse development4,5, it is the most important isoform for lung carcinogenesis in vivo and for the inhibitory effect of wild-type (WT) Kras on the mutant allele6,7. Kras 4A expression is detected in a subpopulation of normal lung epithelial cells, but at very low levels in lung tumors, suggesting that it may not be required for tumor progression. The two Kras isoforms undergo different post-translational modifications8; therefore, these findings can have implications for the design of therapeutic strategies for inhibiting oncogenic Kras activity in human cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2086156968,"Synaptic activity produces short-lived second messengers that ultimately yield a long-term depression (LTD) of cerebellar Purkinje cells. Here, we test the hypothesis that these brief second messenger signals are translated into long-lasting biochemical signals by a positive feedback loop that includes protein kinase C (PKC) and mitogen-activated protein kinase. Histochemical “epistasis” experiments demonstrate the reciprocal activation of these kinases, and physiological experiments—including the use of a light-activated protein kinase—demonstrate that such reciprocal activation is required for LTD. Timed application of enzyme inhibitors reveals that this positive feedback loop causes PKC to be active for more than 20 min, allowing sufficient time for LTD expression. Such regenerative mechanisms may sustain other long-lasting forms of synaptic plasticity and could be a general mechanism for prolonging signal transduction networks."

Though the precursor proteins are different for each disease, similar mechanisms may cause the amyloidogenesis. In light chain amyloidosis (AL), 2The abbreviations used are: AL, light chain amyloidosis; LC, light chain; HC, heavy chain; ThT, thioflavin T. a monoclonal immunoglobulin light chain (LC) forms amyloid fibrils that deposit in the extracellular space of vital organs (1Kyle R.A. Gertz M.A. Semin. Hematol. 1995; 32: 45-59PubMed Google Scholar). Although other precursor proteins may be wild type or linked to a single hereditary mutation, AL is distinct in that hypervariability yields a different set of mutations in each patient. Variable domains of LCs undergo somatic hypermutation, and in the case of AL patients (2Comenzo R.L. Wally J. Kica G. Murray J. Ericsson T. Skinner M. Zhang Y. Br. J. Haematol. 1999; 106: 744-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), these mutations make proteins thermodynamically destabilized compared with non-amyloidogenic proteins (3Stevens P.W. Raffen R.

Some studies have linked the destabilizing somatic mutations present in AL proteins and the propensity to form amyloid fibrils that leads to cellular and organ damage (4Wall J. Schell M. Murphy C.

Studying AL proteins offers a unique opportunity to delineate the role(s) of individual mutations on amyloidogenicity. Comparisons between amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic proteins have been made (4Wall J. Schell M. Murphy C. Hrncic R. Stevens F.J. Solomon A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14101-14108Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 8Wall J.S. Gupta V. Wilkerson M. Schell M. Loris R. Adams P. Solomon A. Stevens F. Dealwis C. J. Mol. Recognit. 2004; 17: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), but no systematic study of restorative mutations in a single AL protein has been reported. By restoring the residues found in the corresponding germline sequence, we can assess the contributions of individual residues to amyloidogenicity. Although the mutations in AL proteins are unique to each patient, an underlying structural mechanism may be involved in fibril formation that is common to all pathogenic LC proteins. When immunoglobulin molecules are secreted, two heavy chains (HCs) usually pair with two LCs to create a heterotetramer. Occasionally, free light chains are secreted (9Dul J.L. Argon Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8135-8139Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar); these light chains can form homodimers (10Stevens F.J. Westholm F.A. Solomon A. Schiffer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1144-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). LC dimers can be innocuous, but they can also be pathogenic, as in the case of AL. We previously examined the structure of LC dimer AL-09, a protein isolated from an AL patient (11Baden E.M. Owen B.A. Peterson F.C. Volkman B.F. Ramirez-Alvarado M. Thompson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 15853-15860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). AL-09 differs from its germline sequence, κI O18/O8, by seven amino acids. Of these seven somatic mutations, the three non-conservative amino acid changes are located in the dimer interface. We found that the AL-09 dimer has an interface that is rotated 90° from the canonical LC interface observed in the κI O18/O8 protein. The altered interface was accompanied by decreased thermodynamic stability and faster fibril formation for AL-09, compared with κI O18/O8. This was the first time that an altered interface had been observed in an AL protein, fueling our speculation that some of the mutations in AL-09 may be critical to forming the altered interface. The three non-conservative amino acid changes in the interface that occur between κI O18/O8 and AL-09 are N34I, K42Q, and Y87H (Fig. 1a). The interactions in the dimer interface that stabilize the canonical dimer structure may be crucial to preventing amyloidogenicity. Thus, we performed a mutational analysis to test this hypothesis, making restorative mutant proteins with changes at each of these dimer interface positions. The results of this analysis led us to investigate the double restorative mutant (AL-09 I34N/H87Y) as well as a series of reciprocal mutants, in which we start with the κI O18/O8 amino acid sequence and introduce the mutations from the amyloidogenic protein. We then explore the link between thermodynamic stability and fibril formation kinetics and use crystallography to test whether mutants that restore thermodynamic stability also restore the canonical dimer interface to the amyloidogenic protein. Our results show that a single amino acid change in the LC dimer interface can restore protein stability, correct the orientation of the dimer interface, and delay amyloid fibril formation. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The restorative and reciprocal AL-09 mutants were generated by using the QuikChange® Multi Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene).

Chemical denaturation with urea was carried out by equilibrating 20 μm protein samples overnight at 4 °C in either 0 or 8 m urea. Subsequent samples were generated by exchanging equal volumes of the two stock solutions of 0 and 8 m urea to create a range of urea concentrations while keeping the protein concentration constant. Each sample was equilibrated for 10 min at each urea concentration and then the denaturation experiment was followed by CD, acquiring ellipticity at 218 nm for 60 s or by tryptophan fluorescence, with excitation at 294 nm and an emission scan from 310-400 nm. Alternatively, varying concentrations of urea were added to the protein samples and equilibrated overnight before analyzing as described above. Urea concentration was calculated using a hand refractometer (13Pace C.N. Scholtz M. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure, A Practical Approach.

Fibril Formation—Fibril seeds were formed by shaking 750-μl samples of each protein (20 μm protein) in 1.5-ml polypropylene tubes at 300 rpm with 500 mm Na2SO4 and 0.02% NaN3 in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) buffer. Temperature for fibril formation was the melting temperature in the presence of 500 mm Na2SO4 (TmNaS) of each protein (Table 1). ThT fluorescence was monitored to follow fibril formation. A 3-μl fibril sample was added to 5 μm ThT, and the fluorescence emission was measured (PTI-QM2001 fluorometer). The excitation wavelength was 450 nm, and the emission was scanned from 470-530 nm. The concentration of seeds was determined by pelleting the fibrils and measuring the concentration of the soluble protein. This concentration was subtracted from the initial protein concentration to find the fibril concentration. Before they were used to seed further reactions, the fibrils were washed three times with buffer to remove Na2SO4.TABLE 1Thermodynamics of restorative and reciprocal mutantsProteinaProteins are in order from least to most favorable ΔGfolding.TmTmNaSCmΔGfoldingΔH°C°CMkcal/molkcal/molAL-09bData previously reported in Ref. 11.41.1 ± 1.0cError is the S.D. of at least three independent experiments.**need to check actual footnote or not**50.4 ± 0.61.88 ± 0.07−3.53 ± 0.28−62.8 ± 1.0κI O18/O8 N34I/Y87H39.5 ± 1.050.8 ± 0.31.89 ± 0.06−3.81 ± 0.66−79.7 ± 4.24AL-09 Q42K40.2 ± 0.350.4 ± 0.31.80 ± 0.25−4.20 ± 0.86−75.3 ± 1.8κI O18/O8 Y87H47.3 ± 0.459.6 ± 0.72.98 ± 0.28−4.58 ± 0.38−77.3 ± 3.5κI O18/O8 N34I/K42Q/Y87H39.4 ± 0.350.3 ± 1.21.83 ± 0.18−4.74 ± 0.61−86.2 ± 5.5AL-09 I34N48.6 ± 0.258.8 ± 0.32.92 ± 0.22−5.34 ± 0.72−77.3 ± 2.4AL-09 H87Y54.6 ± 0.664.3 ± 0.53.29 ± 0.04−6.10 ± 0.30−100.1 ± 10.3κI O18/O8cError is the S.D. of at least three independent experiments.56.1 ± 0.268.0 ± 0.33.98 ± 0.07−6.12 ± 0.23−95.7 ± 2.6AL-09 I34N/H87Y58.0 ± 0.169.6 ± 0.24.52 ± 0.16−6.84 ± 1.27−100.5 ± 7.4κI O18/O8 N34I51.5 ± 0.965.3 ± 0.33.06 ± 0.17−7.17 ± 1.50−109.5 ± 8.5a Proteins are in order from least to most favorable ΔGfolding.b Data previously reported in Ref. 11Baden E.M.

Open table in a new tab Fibril formation kinetics were followed (with each protein in triplicate in a 96-well plate) by measuring ThT fluorescence on a plate reader (Analyst AD, Molecular Devices) with an excitation wavelength of 430 nm and an emission wavelength of 485 nm. Plates were incubated at 37 °C in a temperature-controlled incubator and shaken continuously on a Lab-Line titer plate shaker (speed setting 3). Each well contained 20 μm protein, a 1:20 ratio of seeds to soluble protein, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, and 5 μm ThT in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4). Total volume for each reaction was 260 μl. Electron Microscopy (EM)—A 3-μl fibril sample was placed on a 300 mesh copper formvar/carbon grid and air-dried. The sample was negatively stained with 4% uranyl acetate, washed, air-dried, and inspected on a Philips Technai T12 transmission electron microscope. Crystallization/X-ray Data Collection—Purified κI O18/O8 Y87H, κI O18/O8 N34I/Y87H, and AL-09 H87Y proteins were concentrated to 1.04 mm, 1.17 mm, and 900 μm, respectively, in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4). AL-09 H87Y crystals were obtained in hanging drops using vapor diffusion against 30% w/v polyethylene glycol 4000 and 0.2 m Li2SO4 in 0.1 m Tris buffer (pH 8.3) at 22 °C. A 2-μl aliquot of the protein solution was mixed with an equal volume from each reservoir. The equilibrated conditions were suitable for cryoprotection of crystals by flash-cooling in liquid N2. κI O18/O8 Y87H crystals were obtained in a similar manner, using vapor diffusion against 1.2 m sodium citrate in 0.1 m Tris buffer pH 8.1. κI O18/O8 N34I/Y87H crystals were obtained using vapor diffusion against 1.1 m sodium citrate in 0.1 m Tris buffer pH 8.3. κI O18/O8 N34I/K42Q/Y87H crystals were obtained using vapor diffusion against 1.3 m sodium citrate in 0.1 m Tris buffer pH 8.1, with a thin layer of 40% paraffin oil and 60% silicon oil.

Coordinates for the final structures reported have been deposited into the Protein Data Bank with codes 3CDY, 3CDF, and 3CDC for AL-09 H87Y, κI O18/O8 Y87H, and κI O18/O8 N34I/Y87H, respectively. Thermodynamic Stability of Mutants—All of the restorative and reciprocal mutants exhibit the expected β-sheet secondary structure as measured by far-UV circular dichroism (CD) (data not shown). The thermodynamics of the mutants, as followed by thermal and chemical denaturation experiments, are compared in Table 1. For the AL-09 restorative mutants, in which individual dimer interface residues are restored to those found in κI O18/O8, the most striking result comes from restoring the histidine to tyrosine at position 87 (H87Y). With this single mutation, AL-09 H87Y regains most of the thermodynamic stability found in κI O18/O8 (Fig. 1b), with Tm values (temperature at which 50% of the protein is folded) of 54.6 and 56.1 °C, respectively. This is nearly 15 °C higher than the Tm for amyloidogenic AL-09. In addition, the non-conservative interface mutation AL-09 I34N restores half of the stability to AL-09. The AL-09 Q42K mutation, however, remains as unstable as the amyloidogenic protein (Fig. 1b). Exploring the combined effects of the stabilizing mutations, the double restorative mutant AL-09 I34N/H87Y increases the thermodynamic stability even slightly beyond that of κI O18/O8. The Cm (concentration of urea where 50% of the protein is folded), ΔGfolding and ΔH values also follow similar trends (Table 1). After observing the huge change in stability with AL-09 H87Y, we decided to create reciprocal mutants as well. In this case, we change key interface residues in κI O18/O8 to the corresponding amino acids in AL-09 to determine if a particular mutation or combination of mutations is significantly destabilizing. Both κI O18/O8 N34I and κI O18/O8 Y87H decrease the stability, by 4.6 and 8.8 °C, respectively (Table 1 and Fig. 1c). Although the effects of the single reciprocal mutations are not quite as dramatic as restoring AL-09 H87Y, the combined effect of these two mutations in κI O18/O8 N34I/Y87H drastically diminishes the stability, making it comparable to AL-09. Mutating all of the residues that change in the dimer interface creates a similarly destabilized protein in κI O18/O8 N34I/K42Q/Y87H. Together, the restorative and reciprocal mutants indicate a key role for the dimer interface residues at positions 34 and 87. Amyloid Fibril Formation Kinetics Follow Thermodynamic Stability Trend—A previous study from our laboratory indicated that the kinetics of fibril formation differ between κI O18/O8 and AL-09 in correlation with their differences in thermodynamic stability. AL-09 fibril formation occurs in just 24 h, compared with κI O18/O8, where fibril formation is delayed until 216 h (11Baden E.M. Owen B.A. Peterson F.C. Volkman B.F. Ramirez-Alvarado M. Thompson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 15853-15860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We followed fibril formation reactions to determine whether the restorative and reciprocal mutants also have a similar correlation between thermodynamic stability and fibril formation kinetics. Table 2 summarizes the results of the fibril formation reactions, which were assessed by ThT fluorescence (supplemental Fig. S1) and electron microscopy (Fig. 2). Our criteria for fibril formation included the time point at which the ThT fluorescence enhancement indicated a plateau in fibril formation and where electron microscopy confirmed fibril formation.TABLE 2Fibril formation (seeded) at 37 °CProteinaProteins are in order from least to most favorable ΔGfolding.Fibril formation (hours)bThe number of hours reported is taken from the average of at least three experiments.AL-0924κI O18/O8 N34I/Y87H24AL-09 Q42K336κI O18/O8 Y87H96κI O18/O8 N34I/K42Q/Y87H24AL-09 I34N72AL-09 H87Y264κI O18/O8216AL-09 I34N/H87Y360κI O18/O8 N34I500a Proteins are in order from least to most favorable ΔGfolding.b The number of hours reported is taken from the average of at least three experiments. Open table in a new tab κI O18/O8 N34I/Y87H, which is destabilized as much as AL-09, follows a similar fibril formation pattern to the amyloidogenic protein, forming fibrils within 24 h. κI O18/O8 N34I/K42Q/Y87H also forms fibrils within 24 h and has a similar thermodynamic profile compared with both AL-09 and κI O18/O8 N34I/Y87H. AL-09 I34N and κI O18/O8 Y87H, which have intermediate levels of stability, form fibrils more slowly than AL-09, but more quickly than κI O18/O8. As expected from its increased thermodynamic stability, AL-09 H87Y significantly delays fibril formation (264 h) compared with amyloidogenic AL-09. The double restorative mutant, AL-09 I34N/H87Y, surpasses the amount of time needed for κI O18/O8 to form fibrils by over 100 h (Table 2). The increase in time for fibril formation corresponds to an increase in ΔGfolding values between -6.12 and -6.84 kcal/mol for κI O18/O8 and AL-09 I34N/H87Y, respectively. κI O18/O8 N34I requires 500 h to form amyloid fibrils, the longest of any of the proteins studied. While the Tm of this protein places its stability between AL-09 and κI O18/O8, κI O18/O8 N34I actually has the highest ΔGfolding of any of the proteins. Thus, the lengthy lag time for fibril formation correlates with this thermodynamic parameter. AL-09 Q42K is the lone protein that does not appear to follow the trend linking thermodynamic stability with the kinetics of amyloid fibril formation. Although it is destabilized as much as AL-09, it did not form fibrils until 336 h. It is possible that the amino acid change involved with this restorative mutation sufficiently alters the interactions between the protein and its environment to affect the amyloid formation pathway and delay fibril formation more than expected. Restorative Mutant Restores Dimer Interface—Because the AL-09 H87Y mutant restores most of the thermodynamic stability and delays fibril formation even longer than κI O18/O8, we wanted to determine if restoring that single mutation affects the protein structure, especially with respect to the dimer interface. Similarly, we wanted to determine if introducing amyloidogenic mutations to κI O18/O8 Y87H and κI O18/O8 N34I/Y87H alters the dimer interfaces of those proteins. Solving the crystal structure of AL-09 H87Y to 2.43 Å resolution reveals that the lone amino acid change in the amyloidogenic protein is enough to restore the canonical dimer interface found in κI O18/O8 (Fig. 3a and Table 3). Superposition of AL-09 H87Y with κI O18/O8 does not show any significant differences between the two structures, and the hydrogen bonding and other nonbonding interactions are nearly identical. In an attempt to learn more about the dynamic nature of the dimer interface, 15N 1H HSQC spectra were acquired for κI O18/O8 and AL-09 at 500 μm protein concentration (data not shown). Although these spectra show many chemical shift differences between the proteins, peak broadening prevented full assignment of the residues in the dimer interface. In contrast, little or no broadening was observed in HSQC spectra of AL-09 H87Y, the only protein with a predominantly dimeric population at this concentration (Kd = 200 nm, compared with κI O18/O8, where Kd = 217 μm and AL-09, where Kd = 23 μm) (11Baden E.M. Owen B.A. Peterson F.C. Volkman B.F. Ramirez-Alvarado M. Thompson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 15853-15860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Our striking results with AL-09 H87Y led us to assess the number of amyloidogenic mutations required to create the altered dimer interface observed for AL-09 by determining the crystal structures of three reciprocal mutants. The κI O18/O8 Y87H reciprocal mutation was not enough to single-handedly alter the dimer interface (Fig. 3b). However, we did find evidence of disruption caused by this mutation. In the structure, solved to 1.56-Å resolution, the 40-44 loop (containing residues 40PGKAP44) shows that the backbone is shifted in the κI O18/O8 Y87H mutant. Specifically, the Cα of Pro-40 is shifted by 2.92 Å, and the Cα of Gly-41 is shifted by 3.08 Å compared with κI O18/O8 (Fig. 3d). Also, in κI O18/O8, a hydrogen bond between the backbone carbonyl of Lys-42 on chain A and Tyr-87 on the opposite subunit effectively pulls the loop around into the dimer interface (Fig. 3f). With κI O18/O8 Y87H, however, the loss of the tyrosine prevents this interaction and the loop shifts back away from the interface. In addition to these measurable shifts, the mutation to His-87 likely alters interactions that involve hydrogen bonding through water in the region surrounding that residue. Although κI O18/O8 N34I/Y87H differs significantly from κI O18/O8 Y87H with regard to thermodynamic stability and fibril formation properties, not many differences were found between the two crystal structures. κI O18/O8 N34I/Y87H, solved to 1.53-Å resolution, maintains the canonical dimer interface (Fig. 3c). However, we did observe an effect on the 40-44 loop that was similar to the κI O18/O8 Y87H mutant (Fig. 3e). In this case, the Cα shifts compared with κI O18/O8 are 2.27 Å for Pro-40 and 2.04 Å for Gly-41. κI O18/O8 N34I/Y87H also lacks the hydrogen bond between Lys-42 on chain A and residue 87 on chain B (electron density, supplemental Fig. S2); the distance between these residues is even greater than that observed in the κI O18/O8 Y87H mutant (4.95 Å compared with 3.54 Å). Although the addition of the N34I mutation may be expected to cooperate to alter the dimer interface based on its loss of thermodynamic stability, it is possible that when all of the mutations are present in AL-09, Ile-34 is destabilizing. In the context of the double mutant, however, it could have a compensatory effect stabilizing the structure. To completely assess the role of the non-conservative mutations in the dimer interface, we also solved the structure of the triple reciprocal mutant κI O18/O8 N34I/K42Q/Y87H to 3.0-Å resolution (data not shown). This protein also retained the canonical dimer interface, indicating that introducing the interface mutations from the amyloidogenic protein is not alone sufficient to populate the alternate dimer conformation observed for AL-09 by x-ray crystallography. Our analysis highlights a single AL-09 mutation, His-87, which, when restored to the tyrosine residue found in κI O18/O8, regains thermodynamic stability, delays amyloid formation, and restores the canonical dimer interface. The restorative and reciprocal mutations in the amyloidogenic protein AL-09 show a correlation between protein stability and the kinetics of amyloid fibril formation, as well as a link between the mutations and protein stability. Fibril formation studies establish that less stable forms of the protein AL-09 form fibrils faster than more stable mutants. This study is not the first time that the His-87 mutation has been shown to have a critical role in an LC protein. MOPC 21 is a κIV murine myeloma protein that cannot be secreted unless complexed with HC. Dul et al. (24Dul J.L. Burrone O.R. Argon Y. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1927-1933PubMed Google Scholar) study the mechanism of the secretory defect and find that it is caused by the single amino acid mutation, His-87. Upon restoring the germline tyrosine residue, the protein regains a normal secretory phenotype, much as restoring H87Y to AL-09 restored a germline-like phenotype to that protein. The importance of this mutation is also reinforced by the finding that Tyr-87 is >95% conserved across all κ and λ germline sequences (11Baden E.M. Owen B.A. Peterson F.C. Volkman B.F. Ramirez-Alvarado M. Thompson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 15853-15860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The fibril formation kinetics assays with the AL-09 and κI O18/O8 mutants not only illustrate a link between protein stability and capacity for amyloid formation, but they also show that a single mutation in the κI O18/O8 germline protein can greatly increase its amyloidogenic propensity. The κI O18/O8 Y87H mutant, for example, formed fibrils within 96 h, about twice as fast as κI O18/O8. Introducing two mutations, κI O18/O8 N34I/Y87H, accelerated fibril formation even further, to 24 h, which is on par with amyloidogenic AL-09. Previous studies with non-amyloidogenic LC protein LEN found a similar pattern, in which introducing just one or two mutations from AL protein SMA caused LEN to become fibrillogenic (25Davis D.P.

Other studies linking specific amino acids to amyloidogenicity also correlate with our results that less stable proteins form fibrils more quickly. Hurle et al. (6Hurle M.R. Helms L.R. Li L. Chan W. Wetzel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5446-5450Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) studied several AL κ LC sequences and found rare mutations that occur at structurally important positions. They then introduced these single-point mutations into non-amyloidogenic Bence Jones protein REI and found that the less stable proteins aggregated more than proteins with higher stability. Del Pozo Yauner et al. (26Del Pozo Yauner L. Ortiz E. Sanchez R. Sanchez-Lopez R. Guereca L. Murphy C.L. Allen A. Wall J.S. Fernandez-Velasco D.A. Solomon A. Becerril B. Proteins. 2008; 72: 684-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) compare a λ6a germline protein to a λ6a R25G mutant. Their findings are similar to our results in that the λ6a germline is more stable than λ6a R25G and also delays fibrillogenesis. The authors postulate that the R25G mutation may destabilize the N-terminal loop, causing increased fibril formation. A study by Wall et al. (8Wall J.S. Gupta V. Wilkerson M. Schell M. Loris R. Adams P. Solomon A. Stevens F. Dealwis C. J. Mol. Recognit. 2004; 17: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) also illustrates the importance of certain structural elements in conjunction with fibrillogenesis. This study introduced two neutral mutations to disrupt an electrostatic interaction in a relatively stable multiple myeloma LC protein (Jto). These neutral mutations simulate the context of another, highly fibrillogenic protein (Wil). The authors found that one of the mutants was comparable to Jto in thermodynamics and fibril formation kinetics, but a second mutant had several side chain alterations that led to a different hydrophobic surface and electrostatic interactions. This second mutant had an increased rate of fibrillogenesis. Among the proteins that we studied, we also observed mutations altering electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions that ultimately led to the shifted loop regions in κI O18/O8 Y87H and κI O18/O8 N34I/Y87H. These shifts were accompanied by increases in the propensity for amyloid formation and decreased thermodynamic stability. Our structural analysis of the reciprocal mutants, in which we changed amino acids from the germline sequence to their amyloidogenic counterparts, did not reveal an altered dimer interface for either the critical κI O18/O8 Y87H mutation or the thermodynamically unstable κI O18/O8 N34I/Y87H or κI O18/O8 N34I/K42Q/Y87H proteins. Similarly, when Dul et al. (24Dul J.L. Burrone O.R. Argon Y. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1927-1933PubMed Google Scholar) introduced the His-87 mutation from the pathogenic protein into a wild-type λ germline, secretion was not inhibited. The reciprocal mutants also reveal destabilization of the 40-44 loop. This region is also shifted in κI AL protein BRE when compared with a non-amyloidogenic protein (27Schormann N. Murrell J.R. Liepnieks J.J. Benson M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9490-9494Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Crystallization studies of other AL proteins, AL-12 and AL-103, have also shown the 40-44 loop to be disordered. 3E. G. Randles, D. J. Martin, J. R. Thompson, and M. Ramirez-Alvarado, submitted for publication. Therefore, this region may be a key to amyloidogenic propensity in LC proteins. Though none of the reciprocal mutants displayed a drastic change like the altered and restored dimer interfaces in AL-09 and AL-09 H87Y, similar subtle structural changes have been shown to be important in another amyloid disease precursor protein as well. In transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis, the EF-helix becomes slightly more disordered as the pH decreases, and this may be the mechanism by which mutations in this region are more amyloidogenic (28Palaninathan S.K. Mohamed Mohaideen N.N. Snee W.C. Kelly J.W. Sacchettini J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 382: 1157-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Thus, seemingly small changes in the structure of amyloid precursor proteins may have a huge impact on amyloidogenicity. Collectively, our results lead us to conclude that for AL proteins, a single mutation is unlikely to cause a protein to become amyloidogenic. Rather, it is plausible that the combinatorial interactions of destabilizing and compensatory mutations lead to pathogenesis, and minor disruptions in the structure could significantly increase the protein amyloidogenic propensity. The altered interface observed in AL-09 may be evidence that this protein populates a dimer that is less prevalent in κI O18/O8 and the mutants that we studied.

https://openalex.org/W1976954323,"Backbone fragments of the Agrobacterium tumor-inducing (Ti) plasmid that bears transgenes of interest have occasionally been reported to be transferred to plant genomes. Now, Ülker et al. show that Agrobacterium chromosomal DNA can also be integrated into transgenic plants at a low frequency. Gene-bearing chromosomal fragments as large as 18 kb are found in T-DNA–tagged populations of Arabidopsis thaliana. Besides the well-documented integration of DNA flanked by the transfer DNA borders, occasional insertion of fragments from the tumor-inducing plasmid into plant genomes has also been reported during Agrobacterium tumefaciens–mediated transformation. We demonstrate that large (up to ∼18 kb) gene-bearing fragments of Agrobacterium chromosomal DNA (AchrDNA) can be integrated into Arabidopsis thaliana genomic DNA during transformation. One in every 250 transgenic plants may carry AchrDNA fragments. This has implications for horizontal gene transfer and indicates a need for greater scrutiny of transgenic plants for undesired bacterial DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2052214311,"Transforming growth factor beta family ligands are neutralized by a number of structurally divergent antagonists. Follistatin-type antagonists, which include splice variants of follistatin (FS288 and FS315) and follistatin-like 3 (FSTL3), have high affinity for activin A but differ in their affinity for other ligands, particularly bone morphogenetic proteins. To understand the structural basis for ligand specificity within FS-type antagonists, we determined the x-ray structure of activin A in complex with FSTL3 to a resolution of 2.5 A. Similar to the previously resolved FS.activin A structures, the ligand is encircled by two antagonist molecules blocking all ligand receptor-binding sites. Recently, the significance of the FS N-terminal domain interaction at the ligand type I receptor site has been questioned; however, our data show that for FSTL3, the N-terminal domain forms a more intimate contact with activin A, implying that this interaction is stronger than that for FS. Furthermore, binding studies revealed that replacing the FSTL3 N-terminal domain with the corresponding FS domain considerably lowers activin A affinity. Therefore, both structural and biochemical evidence support a significant interaction of the N-terminal domain of FSTL3 with activin A. In addition, structural comparisons with bone morphogenetic proteins suggest that the interface where the N-terminal domain binds may be the key site for determining FS-type antagonist specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2063893501,"The c-myb proto-oncogene product (c-Myb) is degraded in response to Wnt-1 signaling via a pathway involving TAK1 (transforming growth factor-beta-activated kinase 1), HIPK2 (homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2), and NLK (Nemo-like kinase). NLK directly binds to c-Myb, which results in the phosphorylation of c-Myb at multiple sites, and induces its ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation. Here, we report that Fbxw7, the F-box protein of an SCF complex, targets c-Myb for degradation in a Wnt-1- and NLK-dependent manner. Fbxw7alpha directly binds to c-Myb via its C-terminal WD40 domain and induces the ubiquitination of c-Myb in the presence of NLK in vivo and in vitro. The c-Myb phosphorylation site mutant failed to interact with Fbxw7alpha, suggesting that the c-Myb/Fbxw7alpha interaction is enhanced by NLK phosphorylation of c-Myb. Treatment of M1 cells with Fbxw7 small interfering RNA (siRNA) rescued the Wnt-induced c-Myb degradation and also the Wnt-induced inhibition of cell proliferation. NLK bound to Cul1, a component of the SCF complex, while HIPK2 interacted with both Fbxw7alpha and Cul1, suggesting that both kinases enhance the c-Myb/SCF interaction. In contrast to c-Myb, the v-myb gene product (v-Myb) encoded by the avian myeloblastosis virus was resistant to NLK/Fbxw7alpha-induced degradation. Thus, Fbxw7 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase of c-Myb, and the increased c-Myb levels may contribute, at least partly, to transformation induced by mutation of Fbxw7."
https://openalex.org/W2046681055,"We recently reported that hydrogen peroxide-inducible clone-5 (Hic-5, also named androgen receptor-associated protein 55) can bind to the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)-signaling regulator Smad3, thereby inhibiting certain Smad3-dependent TGF-beta responses. We now show that Hic-5 can also control TGF-beta responses through an alternative mechanism involving Smad7, a key negative regulator of TGF-beta signaling. Hic-5 binds directly to Smad7. This interaction requires the LIM3 domain of Hic-5, and enhances TGF-beta signaling through causing loss of Smad7 protein but not mRNA. Enforced expression of Hic-5 reverses the ability of Smad7 to suppress TGF-beta-induced phosphorylation of Smads 2 and 3 and activation of the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 promoter (in NRP-154 and PC3 prostate carcinoma and WPMY-1 prostate myofibroblast cell lines). Lentiviral-mediated small-hairpin RNA silencing of endogenous Hic-5 reduced TGF-beta responses in PC3 and WPMY-1 cells. Further work suggests that the level of Smad7 is modulated by its physical interaction with Hic-5 and targeted to a degradation pathway not likely to be proteasomal. Our findings support that Hic-5 functions as a cell-type-specific activator of TGF-beta signaling through its ability to physically interact with and neutralize Smad7."

In this study, we investigated the signaling and functions of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a serum-borne bioactive sphingolipid, in ECs of different in vitro ages. We observed that S1P-regulated responses are significantly inhibited and the S1P1-3 receptor subtypes are markedly increased in senescent ECs. Increased expression of S1P1 and S1P2 was also observed in the lesion regions of atherosclerotic endothelium, where senescent ECs have been identified in vivo. S1P-induced Akt and ERK1/2 activation were comparable between ECs of different in vitro ages; however, PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) activity was significantly elevated and Rac activation was inhibited in senescent ECs. Rac activation and senescent-associated impairments were restored in senescent ECs by the expression of dominant-negative PTEN and by knocking down S1P2 receptors. Furthermore, the senescent-associated impairments were induced in young ECs by the expression of S1P2 to a level similar to that of in vitro senescence.

There are five identified members of the S1P receptor family: S1P1, S1P2, S1P3, S1P4, and S1P5 (old nomenclature: EDG-1, -5, -3, -6, and -8, respectively) (8Chun J. Goetzl E.J. Hla T. Igarashi Y. Lynch K.R. Moolenaar W. Pyne S. Tigyi G. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). It was demonstrated that S1P receptor subtypes couple to different Gα polypeptides to regulate distinct signaling pathways (9Ancellin N. Hla T. J. Biol.

The S1P receptor subtypes were expressed in distinct combinations in different cell types to produce an appropriate biological effect. For example, S1P1 and S1P3 are expressed in endothelial cells (ECs) (12Lee M.J. Thangada S. Claffey K.P. Ancellin N. Liu C.H. Kluk M. Volpi M. Sha'afi R.I. Hla T. Cell. 1999; 99: 301-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). The signaling pathways regulated by the S1P1 and S1P3 receptors are required for the chemotaxis of endothelial cells, adherens junction assembly, endothelial morphogenesis, and angiogenic response in vitro and in vivo (7Lee M.J.

However, the functional outcomes resulting from the concerted effects of the signaling pathways mediated by the distinct S1P receptor subtypes are currently unknown in a physiological environment. In contrast to S1P1-stimulating chemotaxis, S1P2-mediated signaling was shown to inhibit cell migration (14Goparaju S.K. Jolly P.S. Watterson K.R. Bektas M. Alvarez S. Sarkar S. Mel L. Ishii I. Chun J. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 10: 4237-4249Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 16Sanchez T. Thangada S. Wu M. T. Kontos C.D. Wu D. Wu H. Hla T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 4312-4317Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). For example, embryonic fibroblasts isolated from S1P2 null mice exhibited an enhanced chemotaxis toward S1P, serum, and platelet-derived growth factor; this enhancement was reversed by the reintroduction of S1P2 receptors (14Goparaju S.K. Jolly P.S. Watterson K.R. Bektas M. Alvarez S. Sarkar S. Mel L. Ishii I. Chun J. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 10: 4237-4249Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Recently, the mechanisms of S1P2-regulated inhibition of chemotaxis have started to become identified in several laboratories. For example, it was shown that the inhibition of migration by the S1P2 receptor was mediated by Gα12/13-dependent Rac inactivation (15Sugimoto N. Takuwa N. Okamoto H. Sakurada S. Takuwa Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1534-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In addition, Rho-dependent PTEN activation was demonstrated to account for the S1P2-mediated inhibitory effect (16Sanchez T. Thangada S. Wu M. T. Kontos C.D. Wu D. Wu H. Hla T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 4312-4317Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Together, these data indicate that S1P is able to control two completely opposite biological activities via the activation of distinct S1P receptor signaling pathways, i.e. S1P1 stimulates chemotaxis and S1P2 inhibits it. Thus, the physiological responses of S1P may be an orchestrated manifestation between the signaling cascades activated by the S1P receptor subtypes. Most primary human cultures have a finite lifespan in vitro. By serial subculture, cells will cease proliferation and enter an irreversible state of terminal differentiation, which is termed replicative senescence. Cellular senescence is thought to be an important tumor-suppressive mechanism in vivo (17Campisi J. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: S27-S31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). For example, it was shown that senescence prevents the replication of neoplastic cells and thus inhibits tumor formation in the young animal. In contrast, the accumulation of senescent cells during the aging process may have detrimental effects. The number of senescent cells increases in the elderly can alter the tissue homeostasis (18Campisi J. Kim S.H. Lim C.S. Rubio M. Exp. Gerontol. 2001; 36: 1619-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Also, it has been suggested that senescent ECs may be responsible for impaired wound healing and angiogenesis in the elderly (19Rivard A. Fabre J.E. Silver M. Chen D. Murohara T. Kearney M. Magner M. Asahara T. Isner J.M. Circulation. 1999; 99: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Moreover, altered gene expression by senescent ECs can negatively impact the surrounding microenvironment. For example, nitric oxide (NO) is a multi-functional mediator involved in vasodilatation and angiogenesis (20Albrecht E.W. Stegeman C.A. Heeringa P. Henning R.H. van Goor H. J. Pathol. 2003; 199: 8-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). NO production was shown to be inhibited in senescent ECs (21Sato I. Morita I. Kaji K. Ikeda M. Nagao M. Murota S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 1070-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), suggesting that accumulation of senescent ECs in vivo may affect vascular tone and homeostasis. Furthermore, senescent ECs were shown to be present in human atherosclerotic lesions but not in non-atherosclerotic lesions (22Minamino T. Miyauchi H. Yoshida T. Ishida Y. Yoshida H. Komuro I. Circulation. 2002; 105: 1541-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar, 23Minamino T. Miyauchi H. Yoshida T. Tateno K. Kunieda T. Komuro I. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2004; 36: 175-183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). These results together suggest that senescent ECs in vivo may contribute to the pathogenesis of human vascular diseases. Sphingolipids have been shown to play critical roles in mediating cellular senescence and regulating senescent-associated dysfunctions (24Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

In this study, we utilized cultured ECs as an in vitro model to investigate the underlying mechanisms of senescent-associated endothelial impairments. We demonstrate that the senescent-associated endothelial dysfunctions can be attributed to the up-regulation of S1P2 signaling. This study is significant because it shows for the first time the functional balance between S1P1 and S1P2 signaling in regulating physiological events such as senescent-dependent impairments of wound-healing and morphogenetic capabilities in vascular ECs.

Briefly, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were plated at 4 × 105 cells in a 100-mm culture dish and split every 3 days. The number of population doublings (PDs) that occurred during each passage was calculated as PD = log2 (number of cells proliferated/number of cells seeded). The cumulative population doubling level (CPDL), used to represent the age of the ECs in vitro, is the sum of PDs of each passage. According to this protocol, HUVECs became senescence at CPDL = 60. Senescence was verified by the expression of senescent-associated (SA) β-galactosidase, a specific biomarker for senescent cells (31Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C.

By applying 5 V for 30 s, a relatively high current is delivered to the cell-covered electrode, which results in cell killing (29Lee J.F. Zeng Q. Ozaki H. Wang L. Hand A.R. Hla T. Wang E. Lee M.J. J.

Briefly, HUVECs of different CPDLs were treated without or with S1P for various times. Cells were collected and solubilized with magnesium-containing lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 25 mm NaF, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EDTA) containing protease inhibitors (Calbiochem). 400 μg of cell extracts was incubated with glutathione S-transferase-p21-activated kinase (Rac binding domain of p21-activated kinase) beads at 4 °C for 1 h to isolate the GTP-bound form of activated Rac. After washing, bound Rac polypeptides were resolved on a 12% SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blot analysis with monoclonal Rac antibody. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—HUVECs treated without and with S1P were collected with cell scrapers in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline followed by centrifugation (250 × g, 5 min). Cell extracts were prepared in TBST/OG buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 60 mm n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside) containing protease inhibitors (Calbiochem) with constant agitation at 4 °C for 30 min, followed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min. Cell extracts were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the indicated antibodies, and the immunocomplexes were precipitated by adding the mixtures of protein-A and protein-G beads at 4 °C for 1 h. After washing, precipitated polypeptides were released by boiling in double-strength Laemmli buffer at 95 °C for 5 min, resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Subsequently, the membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk (Lab Scientific) in TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20). The blots were washed and incubated with the indicated primary antibodies on a rotary shaker at 4 °C for overnight. The blots were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibody for 1 h at room temperature, incubated with enhanced chemilumenescence reagent (ECL) (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 min, and visualized by exposure to Kodak X-Omat films. PTEN Phosphatase Assay—PTEN phosphatase activity was measured with the PTEN Malachite Green Assay Kit (Upstate) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Endothelial cells with different in vitro lifespans were solubilized in a lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.2% SDS, 2% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors (Calbiochem). After centrifuging at 15,000 × g for 20 min, cellular PTEN polypeptides were immunoprecipitated by incubating extracts (500 μg) with anti-PTEN (Cell Signaling) at 4 °C overnight, followed by adding protein-A beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The precipitated PTEN was then assessed for phosphatase activity by using d-myophosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (Echelon Biosciences, Salt Lake City) containing phospholipids vesicles. The released phosphate was quantitated after the addition of the malachite green reagent (Upstate) by measuring the absorbance at 630 nm. RT-PCR and Real-time PCR—Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and was reverse-transcribed with an oligo-dT primer (Invitrogen) by M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI) for first strand cDNA synthesis. PCR detection of each gene expression was performed with 2 μl of reverse-transcribed cDNAs in a total volume of 20 μl of reaction mixture containing 200 nm of each primer, 0.2 mm of each dNTP, and 1 unit of Taq polymerase (Promega). Reactions were performed using the GeneAmp 9700 PCR System (Applied Biosystems). PCR conditions were performed with 35 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C (30 s), annealing at 58 °C (30 s), and extension at 72 °C (30 s). Amplified PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel. PCR primer pairs used were: human S1P1: sense, 5′-GCACCAACCCCATCATTTAC-3′, antisense, 5′-TTGTCCCCTTCGTCTTTCTG-3′; human S1P2: sense, 5′-CAAGTTCCACTCGGCAATGT-3′, antisense, 5′-CAGGAGGCTGAAGACAGAGG-3′; human S1P3: sense, 5′-TCAGGGAGGGCAGTATGTTC-3′, antisense, 5′-GAGTAGAGGGGCAGGATGGT-3′; human S1P4: sense, 5′-AGCCTTCTGCCCCTCTACTC-3′, antisense, 5′-ATCAGCACCGTCTTCAGCA-3′; and human S1P5: sense, 5′-ACAACTACACCGGCAAGCTC-3′, antisense, 5′-GCCCCGACAGTAGGATGTT-3′. For real-time PCR quantitation, 50 ng of reversely transcribed cDNAs were amplified with the ABI 7500 system (Applied Biosystems) in the presence of TaqMan DNA polymerase. The sense and antisense primers used to detect the gene expression of S1P receptor subtypes and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were purchased from Applied Biosystems. The qPCR reaction was performed by using a universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. siRNA-mediated Gene Silencing—To specifically knockdown the endothelial S1P2 receptor, sense and antisense hairpin oligonucleotides flanked with BamH1 and EcoRI restriction sites at 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, were designed according to GenScript siRNA sequence design tool (siRNA target finder, www.genscript.com/ssl-bin/app/rnai). The oligonucleotide sequences were: (sense), 5′-gatccGTGACCATCTTCTCCATCATTCAAGAGATGATGGAGAAGATGGTCACTTTTTTg-3′; (antisense), 5′-aattcAAAAAAGTGACCATCTTCTCCATCATCTCTTGAATGATGGAGAAGATGGTCACg-3′. The sense and antisense oligonucleotides were annealed and cloned into lentiviral pFIV-H1 vector (System Bioscience). Lentiviral transducing particles carrying the siRNA oligonucleotides were produced by packaging in the 293T/17 cell line following the manufacturer's instructions. Lentiviral particles carrying siRNA oligonucleotide for luciferase were used as a control. HUVECs (6 × 105 cells) were infected with lentiviral particles (∼0.1, multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.)) in 60-mm dishes for 24 h in the presence of polybrene (2 μg/ml), washed, and replaced with fresh medium for an additional 24 h. Subsequently, cells were split (1:3 split ratio), and HUVECs stably transduced with the lentiviral particles were isolated by puromycin (1 μg/ml) selection. Migration Assay—Endothelial chemotaxis was measured using the Transwell migration assay (8-μm pore size, Costar) as described (13Lee M.J. Thangada S. Paik J.H. Sapkota G.P. Ancellin N. Chae S.S.

Briefly, polycarbonate membranes were coated with human fibronectin (1 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C. Following serum starvation, HUVECs were trypsinized, counted, and resuspended in M199 media with 0.5% fatty-acid free BSA (Sigma). Cells (7.5 × 104 cells in 100 μl) were placed in the upper chamber, and medium (600 μl) containing S1P was added to the lower chamber. ECs were allowed to migrate for 4 h at 37 °C in a humidified chamber with 5% CO2. Subsequently, the non-migrated cells on the upper side of the filter were removed with a cotton swab. The filters were fixed with 4% form-aldehyde and stained with 0.1% crystal violet solution. Following eluting the stained dye with 10% acetic acid, cell chemotaxis was quantitated with the BMG FluoStar Galaxy microplate reader (BMG Labtechnologies) with absorbance at 590 nm. Immunohistochemical Analysis—Paraffin sections were prepared from aorta of atherosclerotic mice as previously described (34Subbarao K. Jala V.R. Mathis S. Suttles J. Zacharias W. Ahamed J. Ali H. Tseng M.T. Haribabu B. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Subsequently, aortic specimens were blocked with 5% BSA in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with indicated antibodies (1:100 dilution in 1% BSA) overnight at 4 °C. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline (3 × 5 min), specimens were incubated with biotin-conjugated secondary antibody (1:200 dilution in 1% BSA, Vectastain-Elite-ABC-Kit) for 30 min at room temperature, followed by incubation with avidin-biotinylated horseradish peroxidase solution (Vectastain-Elite-ABC-Kit) for 30 min at room temperature. Immunostaining was then developed by diaminobenzidine tetrachloride solution according to manufacturer's instructions (Vector Laboratories). Specimens were counterstained with hematoxylin solution (Sigma). Because horseradish peroxidase enzymes specifically bound to antigen-antibody complexes were visualized by the addition of diaminobenzidine tetrachloride chromogen, the intensity of brown staining indicates the relative abundance of antigen. For quantitative purposes, the immunoreactivity (i.e. the intensity of brown staining) was analyzed by MetaMorph image acquisition and analysis software (Meta-Morph Version 6.1, Molecular Devices) (35Jala V.R. Haribabu B. Ali H. Haribabu B. Methods in Molecular Biology Series. 332. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2006: 159-168Google Scholar). In addition, specimens were counterstained with hematoxylin solution, which produces a contrasting purple color for negative cells. The staining of SA-β-galactosidase was performed essentially as described (22Minamino T. Miyauchi H. Yoshida T. Ishida Y. Yoshida H. Komuro I.

Endothelial senescence was verified using SA-β-galactosidase staining and BrdUrd labeling (31Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubelj I.

https://openalex.org/W2037014447,"Myb family transcription factors are important in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and cell cycle progression. Giardia lamblia differentiates into infectious cysts to survive outside of the host. During encystation, genes encoding cyst wall proteins (CWPs) are coordinately induced. We have identified an encystation-induced Myb2 protein, which binds to the promoter regions of the cwp genes and myb2 itself in vitro. To elucidate the role of Myb2 in G. lamblia, we tested the hypothesis that Myb2 can activate encystation-induced genes. We found that overexpression of Myb2 resulted in an increase of expression of CWP1 at both protein and mRNA levels. Interestingly, the Myb2-overexpressing trophozoites had increased capability to differentiate into cysts. In cotransfection assays, Myb2 was able to transactivate the cwp promoters and its own promoter in vivo, suggesting that its gene can be positively autoregulated. Moreover, deletion of the N- or C-terminal domain resulted in a decrease of transactivation and autoregulation function of Myb2. We also found that the promoter of a newly identified encystation-induced gene, the giardial myeloid leukemia factor-like gene, has the Myb2 binding sites and that its mRNA levels were increased by Myb2 overexpression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that Myb2 was bound to the promoters with its binding sites. Transfection of the myb2 antisense construct reduced the levels of the cwp1 transcripts and cyst formation. Our results suggest that Myb2 is a potent transactivator of the cwp genes and other endogenous genes and plays an important role in G. lamblia differentiation into cysts."
https://openalex.org/W2107030891,"Caspase-3 is an attractive therapeutic target for treatment of diseases involving disregulated apoptosis. We report here the mechanism of caspase-3 inactivation by isoquinoline-1,3,4-trione derivatives. Kinetic analysis indicates the compounds can irreversibly inactivate caspase-3 in a 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT)- and oxygen-dependent manner, implying that a redox cycle might take place in the inactivation process. Reactive oxygen species detection experiments using a chemical indicator, together with electron spin resonance measurement, suggest that ROS can be generated by reaction of isoquinoline-1,3,4-trione derivatives with DTT. Oxygen-free radical scavenger catalase and superoxide dismutase eliciting the inactivation of caspase-3 by the inhibitors confirm that ROS mediates the inactivation process. Crystal structures of caspase-3 in complexes with isoquinoline-1,3,4-trione derivatives show that the catalytic cysteine is oxidized to sulfonic acid (-SO3H) and isoquinoline-1,3,4-trione derivatives are bound at the dimer interface of caspase-3. Further mutagenesis study shows that the binding of the inhibitors with caspase-3 appears to be nonspecific. Isoquinoline-1,3,4-trione derivative-catalyzed caspase-3 inactivation could also be observed when DTT is substituted with dihydrolipoic acid, which exists widely in cells and might play an important role in the in vivo inactivation process in which the inhibitors inactivate caspase-3 in cells and then prevent the cells from apoptosis.

Materials—1,4-Dithiothreitol (DTT), 4The abbreviations used are: DTT, 1,4-dithiothreitol; H2DCFDA, 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SOD, superoxide dismutase; pNA, p-nitroanilide; DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide; Ac, acetyl. (±)-α-lipoic acid, dihydrolipoic acid, 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA), 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrolline-N-oxide, catalase from bovine liver (2000–5000 units/mg), and superoxide dismutase from horseradish (3000 units/mg) were purchased from Sigma. Caspase-3 peptide substrate Ac-DEVD-pNA was synthesized in this laboratory. Peptide inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO was purchased from Bachem Bioscience (King of Prussia, PA). H2DCFDA and peptide were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The concentrated catalase and superoxide dismutase stock solutions were prepared in 50 mm K2HPO4, pH 7.4. Other reagents and solvents are of analytical grade. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Caspase-3 and Its Mutants—The catalytic domain of human caspase-3 was expressed according to the procedure described previously (23Zhang Y.H. Zhang H.J. Wu F. Chen Y.H. Ma X.Q. Du J.Q. Zhou Z.L. Li J.Y. Nan F.J. Li J. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 4842-4852Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The cells that contained the His6-tagged caspase-3 were lysed on ice by sonication and the insoluble cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g at 4 °C. The lysis supernatant was loaded onto HiTrap Chelating HP column (GE Healthcare) or nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) equilibrated with buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) and the His6-tagged caspase-3 was eluted with an elution buffer (buffer A supplemented with 250 mm imidazole). The eluted fractions were dialyzed against buffer A for 4 h and then loaded onto a HiPrep 16/10 Q anion exchange column (GE Healthcare) and the target protein was eluted in fractions containing buffer A with 200–350 mm NaCl. The eluted fractions were pooled together and then loaded on a HiPrep 16/10 Phenyl column (GE Healthcare), which was preequilibrated with buffer B (buffer A supplemented with 500 mm NaCl) and the target protein existing in the flow-through fractions was frozen at -80 °C for further use. The protein sample was desalted into buffer C (buffer A supplemented with 50 mm NaCl and 10 mm DTT) with a HiPrep 26/10 desalting column (GE Healthcare) for crystallization and into buffer D (buffer A supplemented with 2 mm EDTA) prior to kinetic assay. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method with bovine serum albumin as the standard. SDS-PAGE and dynamic light scattering analyses indicated that the protein sample had high purity and homogeneity. The mutant caspase-3 were constructed using the QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) following the manual of the supplier with the pET32b-caspase-3 (23Zhang Y.H. Zhang H.J. Wu F. Chen Y.H. Ma X.Q. Du J.Q. Zhou Z.L. Li J.Y. Nan F.J. Li J. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 4842-4852Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) as the template. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The mutant caspase-3 were expressed and purified using the same method as the wild type caspase-3. Caspase-3 Activity Assay and Kinetic Study—The activity assay of caspase-3 was carried out in a system of 100 μl containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 100 μm Ac-DEVD-pNA, 20 nm caspase-3, and 2 mm of a reducing agent (as indicated in the text), in the presence or absence of 2 μl of inhibitor in DMSO. The rate of hydrolysis product, pNA, was monitored continuously by change of absorbance at 405 nm for 5 min, and the initial rate of hydrolysis was determined using the early linear region of the enzymatic reaction curve. Continuous kinetic monitoring was performed in clear 96-well plates (Corning, Lowell, MA) on Envision (PelkinElmer Life Sciences) controlled by Wallac EnVision Manager. To obtain the observed inactivation rate (kobs) at a specific concentration of inhibitor, caspase-3 was preincubated with the compound for various times prior to initiation of the reaction with Ac-DEVD-pNA. Data from such an experiment can be fit to the following equation: vt = vi exp(-kobs t) (24Copeland R.A. Evaluation of Enzyme Inhibitors in Drug Discovery. A Guide for Medicinal Chemists and Pharmacologists. John Wiley & Sons, Hoboken, NJ2005Google Scholar), where vt is the measured steady state velocity after preincubation of time t, and vi is the steady state velocity at preincubation of time 0. By these methods we can obtain the kobs at varying concentrations of inhibitor, and then use the results to compute an apparent inactivation rate constant (kobs/I) to quantify the effectiveness of the inhibitor. To create oxygen-free conditions, caspase-3 in the assay buffer (containing 2 mm DTT) was exchanged with nitrogen for three cycles in a rubber septum-sealed round-bottom flask. Then a concentrated inhibitor solution (30 times) was injected into the mixture under nitrogen. After incubation for a specified time, 90 μl of the mixture was taken out by syringe to measure the residual activity. Analysis of Kinetic Data—The kinetic data were analyzed by GraphPad Prism 4.00 (GraphPad Software) and presented as the mean ± S.E. from at least three independent experiments unless otherwise specified. The IC50 value was calculated in GraphPad Prism using nonlinear regression analysis and a sigmoidal dose-response (variable slope) equation. The time-dependent reaction progress curve was approximated by a first-order equation (24Copeland R.A. Evaluation of Enzyme Inhibitors in Drug Discovery. A Guide for Medicinal Chemists and Pharmacologists. John Wiley & Sons, Hoboken, NJ2005Google Scholar). The slope of the linear response region, indexed as the apparent inactivation rate constant, was used to determine the potency of the inhibitors. ROS Production Determination—ROS production was monitored by using H2DCFDA. This dye is a stable non-fluorescent compound until oxidized by hydrogen peroxide or low molecular weight peroxides (25Afzal M. Matsugo S. Sasai M. Xu B. Aoyama K. Takeuchi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 304: 619-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 26Trayner I.D. Rayner A.P. Freeman G.E. Farzaneh F. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 186: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The 100-μl assay system contained 10 μm H2DCFDA, 2 μl of inhibitor, and reducing agents (as specified in the text) in the caspase-3 assay buffer. Oxidation of the probe was detected in a clear 96-well plate by monitoring the increase of fluorescence with Envision, at 490 nm excitation and 525 nm emission (top readout). The fluorescence intensity after reaction for 90 min (except continuous kinetic monitoring) was used to quantify the ROS signal. Crystallization and Diffraction Data Collection—Crystallization was performed at 4 °C using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method. The inhibitors I–IV were dissolved in DMSO to a concentration of 25 mm. To prepare crystals of the binary complexes, the purified caspase-3 protein solution (∼0.2 mg/ml) was first mixed with the inhibitor solution in a molar ratio of 1:40 and then incubated at 4 °C overnight. The protein samples were concentrated to about 4 mg/ml before crystallization setup. Sheet-shaped crystals of the binary complexes were grown in drops containing equal volumes (2 μl) of the protein mixture solution and the reservoir solution (4–6% polyethylene glycol 6000, 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.6, 20 mm l-cysteine, and 5% glycerol) to a maximum size of 0.3 × 0.3 × 0.02 mm3 in 1 week. Diffraction data were collected to 2.4–2.8-Å resolution from flash-cooled crystals at -176 °C at beamline 17A of Photon Factory, Japan, and processed with the HKL2000 suite (27Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 207-326Google Scholar). Crystals of these complexes belong to space group P212121 containing four caspase-3 molecules and one inhibitor molecule in the asymmetric unit with a solvent content of ∼50%.

In the initial difference Fourier map there was evident electron density corresponding to the bound inhibitor in each complex. Structure refinement was carried out with CNS using standard protocols (energy minimization, simulated annealing, and B factor refinement) and model building was facilitated using the program O (29Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). There are four caspase-3 molecules in the asymmetric unit; thus strict 4-fold non-crystallographic symmetry constraints were applied in the early stage of refinement, but released in the later stage of refinement. The final structure refinement was performed using the maximum likelihood algorithm implemented in the program REFMAC5 (30Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar). A bulk solvent correction and a free R factor monitor (calculated with 5% of randomly chosen reflections) were applied throughout the refinement. The stereochemical quality of the structure models was evaluated with the program MOLPROBITY (31Lovell S.C. Davis I.W. Arendall W.B. 3rd, de Bakker P.I. Word J.M. Prisant M.G. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Proteins. 2003; 50: 437-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (3892) Google Scholar). The statistics of structure refinement are summarized in Table 3. Time-dependent Irreversible Inactivation of Caspase-3 by Isoquinoline-1,3,4-trione Derivatives—Under aerobic conditions and in the presence of 2 mm DTT, isoquinoline-1,3,4-trione derivatives potently inhibit caspase-3 in a time- and dose-dependent manner as shown in Fig. 1A. The activity of caspase-3, monitored continuously by the production of pNA from Ac-DEVD-pNA, decreased in a pseudo-first order process. Volume dilution and dialysis methods indicated that the inhibition is irreversible (23Zhang Y.H. Zhang H.J. Wu F. Chen Y.H. Ma X.Q. Du J.Q. Zhou Z.L. Li J.Y. Nan F.J. Li J. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 4842-4852Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The observed rate of inactivation increased nearly linearly with increased concentration of compound III, yielding an apparent inactivation rate constant (kobs/I) of 20,098 ± 867 s-1 m-1 within the linear response zone (Fig. 1B). In the presence of 0.45 μm compound III, the half-life of the inactivation was 1.33 min. At higher concentrations of compound, the inactivation rate was too rapid to be quantified accurately. As shown in Fig. 2, the inactivation rate constant is consistent well with the IC50 value that was used a guide in the structural modification of the inhibitors. Interestingly, compound V, which is structurally related to compound IV but has a disrupted ketone (trione), shows no inhibition for caspase-3 even at 400 μm.FIGURE 2Chemical structures of isoquinoline-1,3,4-trione derivatives. IC50 and kobs/I (mean ± S.E., n > 3) were obtained in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm DTT. IC50 values were calculated from the residual activity of caspase-3 after incubation with 3 times dilution compounds for 15 min.

Within 0 to 0.05 mm DTT, the spontaneous loss of the caspase-3 activity had a varied half-life from 60 to 100 min. The presence of 0.1 μm compound III only perturbed slightly the loss of the activity with an apparent half-life of about 60–50 min (n = 3). However, when the DTT concentration was higher than 0.1 mm, the apparent half-life of caspase-3 increased gradually to about 2000 min. At the same time, the presence of 0.1 μm compound III dramatically reduced the apparent half-life to about 4 min (n = 3). These results indicate that the increased DTT concentrations significantly accelerated the rapid inactivation of caspase-3 mediated by isoquinoline-1,3,4-trione derivatives under aerobic conditions.TABLE 1DTT dose-dependent inactivation of caspase-3 by 0.1 μm compound III The half-life (t½) for the inactivation at given condition was defined as t½ = 0.693/kobs.DTTt½2% DMSO0.1 μm Compound IIImmmin0.0061.8 ± 1.062.3 ± 3.60.0267.1 ± 4.460.8 ± 0.20.0490.8 ± 0.849.7 ± 3.80.08546.9 ± 43.741.2 ± 4.60.16719.6 ± 14.126.6 ± 1.80.31825.7 ± 19.012.0 ± 2.50.63933.6 ± 83.98.9 ± 0.61.251352.8 ± 54.44.7 ± 0.22.501428.9 ± 122.14.5 ± 0.15.001799.0 ± 118.34.3 ± 0.310.001940.6 ± 46.33.3 ± 0.520.002528.1 ± 18.92.4 ± 0.0 Open table in a new tab Effects of a series of thiol-containing reducing agents on the potency of isoquinoline-1,3,4-trione derivatives were also studied. The presence of 2 mm reduced glutathione (GSH), l-cystine, or β-mercaptoethanol protected caspase-3 from inactivation with a different potency. However, these agents had only weak effects on the inactivation by compound III (even in 100 μm) (Table 2). Lipoic acid and some other dithiol-containing agents (such as 1,2-butanedithiol, 1,4-butanedithiol, 1,2-benzenedithiol, and 4,4′-thiobisbenzenthiol) have been reported to be able to facilitate 1,3-dioxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrrolo[3,4-c]quinolines to produce the same potent inhibition of caspase-3 as DTT (32Okun I.

However, our results show that dihydrolipoic acid (reduced lipoic acid) but not lipoic acid has a great effect on the sensitivity of caspase-3 to isoquinoline-1,3,4-trione derivatives (Table 2). Hence, the effects of isoquinoline-1,3,4-trione derivatives on the caspase-3 inactivation are specific to DTT and dihydrolipoic acid at least for the agents under investigation.TABLE 2Effects of different redox compounds on the inactivation of caspase-3 by compound IIIt½2% DMSO0.1 μm Compound III10 μm Compound III100 μm Compound IIIminRedox free145 ± 2137 ± 7142 ± 2122 ± 9GSH1525 ± 441715 ± 181214 ± 2251343 ± 49β-ME1693 ± 531673 ± 121639 ± 511762 ± 130l-Cystine1697 ± 351663 ± 851623 ± 161557 ± 99Lipoic acid1193 ± 2221489 ± 311168 ± 47633 ± 101Dihydrolipoic acid167 ± 51.3 ± 0.1NDaND, not determinedNDDTT1191 ± 604.1 ± 0.2NDNDa ND, not determined Open table in a new tab Oxygen-dependent Inactivation of Caspase-3 by Isoquinoline-1,3,4-trione Derivatives—To determine the oxygen dependence of the caspase-3 inactivation, caspase-3 was incubated with compound III in the presence and absence of air. Anaerobic conditions were created by conducting the experiment under nitrogen in an oxygen-free buffer (see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig. 3, compound III mediates a time-dependent and complete inactivation of caspase-3 under aerobic conditions. The inactivation followed a first-order process with a half-life of 4.25 min at 0.1 μm compound III. At 0.4 μm compound III, the inactivation was reduced proportionally to a half-life of 1.37 min. In contrast to the case in the oxygenic conditions, inhibition in the oxygen-free conditions is negligible. Thus, our results indicate that the inactivation of caspase-3 by isoquinoline-1,3,4-trione derivatives depends on the presence of oxygen.

https://openalex.org/W2014267772,"Phospholipase C-ϵ (PLC-ϵ) is a highly elaborated PLC required for a diverse set of signaling pathways. Here we use a combination of cellular assays and studies with purified proteins to show that activated RhoA and Ras isoforms directly engage distinct regions of PLC-ϵ to stimulate its phospholipase activity. Purified PLC-ϵ was activated in a guanine nucleotide- and concentration-dependent fashion by purified lipidated K-Ras reconstituted in PtdIns(4,5)P2-containing phospholipid vesicles. Whereas mutation of two critical lysine residues within the second Ras-association domain of PLC-ϵ prevented K-Ras-dependent activation of the purified enzyme, guanine nucleotide-dependent activation by RhoA was retained. Deletion of a loop unique to PLC-ϵ eliminated its activation by RhoA but not H-Ras. In contrast, removal of the autoinhibitory X/Y-linker region of the catalytic core of PLC-ϵ markedly activates the enzyme (Hicks, S. N., Jezyk, M. R., Gershburg, S., Seifert, J. P., Harden, T.

Additive activation of PLC-ϵ by RhoA and K- or H-Ras was observed in intact cell studies, and this additivity was recapitulated in experiments in which activation of purified PLC-ϵ was quantified with PtdIns(4,5)P2-containing phospholipid vesicles reconstituted with purified, isoprenylated GTPases. A maximally effective concentration of activated RhoA also increased the sensitivity of purified PLC-ϵ to activation by K-Ras.

Finally, our studies with PLC-ϵ coexpressed with Rho family GTPases (33Wing M.R. Snyder J.T. Sondek J. Harden T.K. J. Biol.

Therefore, the goals of this study were to establish incontrovertible evidence for direct and dual regulation of PLC-ϵ by Rho and Ras family GTPases, to confirm that Rho and Ras interact with distinct regions of PLC-ϵ, and to delineate the consequences of simultaneous activation of a single PLC isozyme by two GTP-bound activators. Dual, simultaneous, and additive regulation of PLC-ϵ is illustrated, and our biochemical studies have revealed that GTP-bound RhoA increases the sensitivity of PLC-ϵ to activation by K-Ras.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—The open reading frame of rat PLC-ϵ in pCMV script was a kind gift from Grant Kelley, State University of New York, Syracuse, NY. The expression vector for GFP-RhoA was a kind gift from Keith Burridge, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC. Hemagglutinin A-tagged and 63L and 12V GTPase-deficient mutants of Ras-family GTPases were obtained from the Guthrie Institute (Sayre, PA). His6-tagged TEV protease was purified as previously described (35Kapust R.B. Tozser J. Fox J.D. Anderson D.E. Cherry S. Copeland T.D. Waugh D.S. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 993-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). K-Ras-4B was the form of K-Ras used in intact cell studies and for protein purification.Construction of Mammalian PLC-ϵ Expression Vectors—PLC-ϵ fragments were constructed as previously described (33Wing M.R. Snyder J.T. Sondek J. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41253-41258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Briefly, full-length rat PLC-ϵ cDNA was used as a template, and PCR was applied to amplify the selected regions following standard protocols. The resulting amplified products were ligated in-frame into pCMV-myc (Clontech). Constructs were confirmed by sequencing. The specific constructs used and ranges of amino acid residues included in each construct were as follows: CDC25-Ct, 509–2281; CDC25-RA1, 509–2113; EF-RA2, 1198–2215; and EF-Ct, 1198–2281; EF-Ct-ΔY, 1198–2281 lacking residues 1667–1728; EF-Ct-Δlinker 1198–2281 lacking residues 1532–1641.Transfection of COS-7 Cells and Quantification of Inositol Phosphate Accumulation—COS-7 cells were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 90% air/10% CO2. Cells were seeded in 12-well culture dishes at a density of ∼65,000 cells per well 24 h prior to transfection. The indicated DNA vectors were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. The total amount of transfected DNA was 700 ng and included empty vector to maintain an equal amount of DNA per well. The culture medium was changed ∼24 h after transfection to inositol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (ICN Biomedicals) containing 1 μCi/well myo-[2-3H(N)]inositol (American Radiolabeled Chemicals). Metabolic labeling was allowed to proceed for 12–18 h. Accumulation of 3H-labeled inositol phosphates were quantified following a 60-min incubation in the presence of the 10 mm LiCl to inhibit inositol phosphate phosphatases. Incubations were terminated by aspiration of the culture medium and subsequent addition of 50 mm formic acid followed by neutralization with 150 mm NH4OH. [3H]Inositol phosphates were isolated and quantified using Dowex chromatography as described previously (36Brown H.A. Lazarowski E.R. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 648-655PubMed Google Scholar). Variability in cpm of [3H]inositol phosphate accumulation across experiments occurred due to differences in the amount of [3H]inositol used for labeling, duration of the prelabeling period, or different amounts of DNA used for transfection.Coimmunoprecipitation of PLC-ϵ with Ras and Rho GTPases from COS-7 Cells—Cells were seeded in 10-cm culture dishes at a density of 1 million cells per dish 24 h prior to transfection. The indicated DNA vectors were transfected using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. The total amount of transfected DNA was 14 μg and included empty vector to maintain an equal amount of DNA per dish. The culture medium was changed ∼24 h after transfection to serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen). 15 h after serum starvation, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and once with 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. Cells were incubated in 1 ml of hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture) for 15 min on ice with rocking. Cells were collected with a cell scraper, Dounce-homogenized (20 strokes), and passed through a 27-gauge needle (3 times). Crude membrane preparations were isolated by centrifuging whole cell lysates (40,000 × g, 1 h, 4 °C) using a table-top ultracentrifuge (TLA 55 rotor). The membrane pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of lysis buffer (above) + 1% Triton X-100 + protease inhibitor mixture, and Dounce-homogenized (30 strokes). Membrane samples were precleared with protein A/G beads at 4 °C for 1 h. Precleared samples were incubated with 2.5 μg anti-Myc 9E10 antibody (Roche Applied Science) and protein A/G beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C for 3 h. Beads were collected by centrifugation at 13,800 × g for 1 min and washed three times with hypotonic lysis buffer + protease inhibitor mixture. Immunoprecipitated samples were eluted by incubating with 2× Lammeli buffer at room temperature for 30 min, and all samples were boiled prior to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis.Purification of PLC Constructs—PLC-ϵ-EF-RA2 (amino acids 1258–2215) was amplified from full-length rat PLC-ϵ and subcloned into NcoI/XhoI-digested pFastBacHT, which incorporates an N-terminal hexahistidine tag and TEV protease site for cleavage of the affinity tag. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate PLC-ϵ-EF-RA2(K>E), a construct with mutations of lysine residues 2150 and 2152 to glutamic acid. Baculoviruses encoding each PLC-ϵ construct were generated using the Bac-to-Bac method per the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen).PLC-ϵ-EF-RA2 and PLC-ϵ-EF-RA2(K>E) were purified as follows. HighFive cells were grown in 4 liter shaker flasks at 27 °C to a density of ∼2.0 × 106 cells/ml and infected with virus encoding PLC-ϵ-EF-RA2 or PLC-ϵ-EF-RA2(K>E) at a multiplicity of infection of 1.0. Cells were harvested 48 h after infection by low speed centrifugation and resuspended to a final volume of 150 ml in buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 10% glycerol, and EDTA-free Complete protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Applied Science)). The resuspended cells were lysed by passage through an EmulsiFlex C5 homogenizer (Avestin). Intact cells and nuclei were removed from the lysate by low speed centrifugation at 500 × g for 15 min. The supernatant from the low-speed centrifugation was clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The resulting supernatant was diluted to a final volume of 150 ml and loaded onto a 5-ml HisTrap metal chelate column (GE Healthcare) charged with Ni2+. The loaded column was washed with 10 column volumes of buffer A, followed by a 10 column volumes, 3% buffer B wash (buffer A + 1 m imidazole). Recombinant protein was eluted using a 3–50% buffer B linear gradient over 20 column volumes collecting 5-ml fractions. Fractions containing recombinant protein were pooled, and hexahistidine-tagged TEV protease was added to the sample to cleave the hexahistidine tag from the PLC-ϵ fragment. The sample was dialyzed overnight against buffer A to remove the imidazole. The cleaved PLC-ϵ fragment was subjected to a second passage over a Ni2+-charged 1-ml HisTrap column, and the protein was eluted with buffer containing 5 mm imidazole, which separates the cleaved PLC-ϵ fragment from the hexahistidine tag and TEV protease. Fractions containing the recombinant protein were pooled and concentrated using a 50,000 MWCO PES centrifugal filtering device (Sartorius). Typical yields for PLC-ϵ-EF-RA2 and PLC-ϵ-EF-RA2(K>E) were ∼1 mg per liter of infected cells.Purification of Monomeric GTPases—Coding sequences for full-length human monomeric GTPases were amplified by PCR and ligated into BamHI/XhoI-digested pFastBacHT, which incorporates an N-terminal hexahistidine tag. Baculoviruses of each GTPase were produced using the Bac-to-Bac system per the manufacturer's protocol. HighFive cells at a density of ∼2.0 × 106 cells/ml were infected with baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of ∼1.0. Cells were harvested 48 h after infection by low speed centrifugation and resuspended in a final volume of 100 ml of buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, one EDTA-free Complete protease inhibitor tablet). Cells were lysed using an Emulsiflex C5 homogenizer. Cell lysates were cleared of intact cells and nuclei by low speed centrifugation at 500 × g for 15 min. Membranes of virus-infected cells were harvested from the resulting supernatant by high speed centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Post-translationally modified, membrane-bound GTPases were extracted from the harvested membranes after resuspension in buffer A containing 1% sodium cholate and one EDTA-free Complete protease inhibitor at a final protein concentration of 5 mg/ml. Resuspended membranes were subjected to rapid stirring for 1 h at 4 °C. Solubilized membrane proteins were separated from the particulate fraction by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h.Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen) was added to the resulting supernatant and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The resulting slurry mixture was added to a gravity flow column and washed with 10 column volumes (CV) of buffer A containing 500 mm NaCl. The column was then equilibrated with buffer A containing 10 mm NaCl, and recombinant protein was eluted in 10 CV of buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 400 mm imidazole, 5% glycerol, 0.5% sodium cholate). Sample containing the eluted protein was diluted to 50 ml in buffer B and applied to a 1 ml HiTrap Q column (GE Healthcare). The loaded column was washed with 10 CV of buffer B, and protein was eluted using a linear NaCl gradient from 10 to 500 mm over 25 CV. Fractions containing the recombinant protein were pooled and applied directly to a 1-ml HisTrap column (GE Healthcare) charged with Ni2+. The loaded column was washed with 10 CV of buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5% sodium cholate, 5% glycerol) and 10 CV of 5% buffer D (buffer C + 1 m imidazole). Protein specifically bound to the column was eluted with a 0 to 50% buffer D gradient over 20 CV collecting 1 ml fractions. Fractions containing recombinant GTPase were pooled and concentrated using a 10,000 MWCO PES centrifugal filtering device (Sartorius). All steps were completed within 1 day with no freezing of the sample between column purifications. The concentrations of the individual GTPases were determined by quantifying the binding of [35S]GTPγS under identical buffer and assay conditions described below for reconstitution of the GTPases with phospholipid vesicles. The ability of purified, lipidated GTPases to associate with phospholipid vesicles was tested as previously described (37Suire S. Hawkins P. Stephens L. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1068-1075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar).Phospholipase C Reconstitution Assay—Experiments to determine regulation of PLC activity by G proteins were performed as previously described with minor modifications (34Seifert J.P.

Harden T.K. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 406: 260-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Briefly, phospholipid vesicles were created by combining 600 μm PE (Avanti Polar Lipids), 50 μm PtdIns(4,5)P2 (Perkin Elmer), and ∼10,000 cpm of [3H]PtdIns(4,5)P2 (Perkin Elmer) per assay into a glass borosilicate tube and drying the mixture under a stream of nitrogen. Vesicles were created by resuspension of the dried lipids in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, followed by probe sonication. Assays were performed in a final volume of 60 μl in a reaction mixture containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 70 mm KCl, 3 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.16 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, 10 μm free calcium, and 0.03% sodium cholate. Purified GTPases were diluted 6-fold into the assay. The GTPases were loaded with nucleotide in the absence of PLC by incubating the G protein/lipid suspension for 30 min at 30 °C with 10 μm GDP or 10 μm GTPγS. Reactions were initiated by the addition of purified PLC and incubations were at 30 °C for 5–10 min as indicated in the figure legends. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 200 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid and 100 μl of 10 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. Soluble [3H]inositol phosphates were quantified by liquid scintillation counting of the soluble fraction after centrifugation of the reaction mixture.Data Analysis—All experiments were carried out at least three times with duplicate or triplicate samples in each experiment. Results are presented as representative or pooled data sets. Dose-response curves were generated using GRAPHPAD PRISM software (Graphpad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). Statistical significance was assessed with a Student's t test.RESULTSActivation of PLC-ϵ by Rho and Ras—To establish evidence for dual and simultaneous regulation of PLC-ϵ by Rho and Ras GTPases, the capacity of GTPases to interact with PLC-ϵ in intact cells was tested in pull-down assays using antibody directed against a c-Myc tag on the N terminus of PLC-ϵ. Expression of PLC-ϵ with either GTPase-deficient RhoA or K-Ras resulted in PLC-ϵ-dependent pull-down of the GTPase from membrane extracts of these cells (Fig. 1A). Moreover, both RhoA and K-Ras were pulled down from membrane extracts of cells expressing both GTPases with PLC-ϵ. The amount of RhoA interacting with PLC-ϵ in cells expressing RhoA and K-Ras simultaneously was greater than that observed in samples from cells expressing only RhoA with PLC-ϵ, and the amount of K-Ras pulled down in cells expressing RhoA and K-Ras simultaneously was at least as great as that observed in samples from cells expressing only K-Ras with PLC-ϵ (Fig. 1A).The relative capacity of both Ras and Rho GTPases to activate PLC-ϵ also was examined in COS-7 cells transiently transfected with DNA encoding GTPase-deficient G-proteins and PLC-ϵ. Whereas expression of H-Ras or K-Ras (Fig. 1B) or N-Ras (data not shown) alone had no effect on [3H]inositol phosphate accumulation, marked accumulation occurred when these GTPases were coexpressed with PLC-ϵ, and data for the effects of maximally effective amounts of Ras GTPases are illustrated in Fig. 1B. We previously demonstrated that RhoA directly activates PLC-ϵ (33Wing M.R. Snyder J.T. Sondek J. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41253-41258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 34Seifert J.P. Wing M.R. Snyder J.T. Gershburg S. Sondek J. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47992-47997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and the amount of PLC-ϵ-dependent accumulation of [3H]inositol phosphates was similar with maximally effective amounts of GTPase-deficient RhoA and K-Ras or H-Ras (Fig. 1B). Maximally activating amounts of RhoA and K-Ras or H-Ras also were simultaneously expressed with PLC-ϵ in COS-7 cells. Co-expression of RhoA with either K-Ras or H-Ras resulted in PLC-ϵ-dependent inositol phosphate accumulation significantly greater than that observed after expression of either GTPase individually. The effect of coexpression of PLC-ϵ with both RhoA and K-Ras (or H-Ras) ranged from a partially additive effect as shown in Fig. 1B to a fully additive effect (data not shown). In contrast, co-expression of maximally effective concentrations of H-Ras with K-Ras resulted in no additivity of PLC-ϵ-dependent response (data not shown). Western blots confirmed that the levels of GTPase or PLC-ϵ expression from the indicated amounts of DNA were not changed by co-expression with various other expression vectors (data not shown).Our previous studies suggested that Rho and Ras GTPases regulate the activity of PLC-ϵ through specific and separate regions of the enzyme (33Wing M.R. Snyder J.T. Sondek J. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41253-41258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These observations were extended by a series of experiments in COS-7 cells transiently transfected with DNA encoding GTPase-deficient RhoA or H-Ras with various constructs of PLC-ϵ (Fig. 2A). Activity observed with PLC-ϵ lacking the N-terminal region (CDC25-Ct) was markedly increased by co-expression with either RhoA or H-Ras (Fig. 2B). As previously illustrated (32Bunney T.D. Katan M. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 640-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), removal of the second RA domain of PLC-ϵ resulted in an isozyme (CDC25-RA1) that was not activated by H-Ras; however, this construct retained capacity for RhoA-dependent activation (Fig. 2B). PLC-ϵ lacking an insertion within the Y-box (EF-Ct"
https://openalex.org/W2143749645,"Protein Z-dependent protease inhibitor (ZPI) is a recently identified member of the serpin superfamily that functions as a cofactor-dependent regulator of blood coagulation factors Xa (FXa) and XIa. Here we show that ZPI and its cofactor, protein Z (PZ), inhibit procoagulant membrane-bound factor Xa by the branched pathway acyl-intermediate trapping mechanism used by other serpins, but with significant variations of this mechanism that are unique to ZPI. Rapid kinetic analyses showed that the reaction proceeded by the initial assembly of a membrane-associated PZ-ZPI-FXa Michaelis complex (K(M) 53+/-5 nM) followed by conversion to a stable ZPI-FXa complex (k(lim) 1.2+/-0.1 s(-1)). Cofactor premixing experiments together with independent kinetic analyses of ZPI-PZ and factor Xa-PZ-membrane complex formation suggested that assembly of the Michaelis complex through either ZPI-PZ-lipid or factor Xa-PZ-lipid intermediates was rate-limiting. Reaction stoichiometry analyses and native PAGE showed that for every factor Xa molecule inhibited by ZPI, two serpin molecules were cleaved. Native PAGE and immunoblotting showed that PZ dissociated from ZPI once ZPI forms a stable complex with FXa, and kinetic analyses confirmed that PZ acted catalytically to accelerate the membrane-dependent ZPI-factor Xa reaction. The ZPI-FXa complex was only transiently stable and dissociated with a rate constant that showed a bell-shaped pH dependence indicative of participation of factor Xa active-site residues. The complex was detectable by SDS-PAGE when denatured at low pH, consistent with it being a kinetically trapped covalent acyl-intermediate. Together our findings show that ZPI functions like other serpins to regulate the activity of FXa but in a manner uniquely dependent on protein Z, procoagulant membranes, and pH."

https://openalex.org/W2015456782,"Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) associates with the cytoplasmic domain of receptor activator of NF-kappaB (RANK) and is an essential component of the signaling complex mediating osteoclastogenesis. However, the osteoclastic activity of TRAF6 is blunted by its association with four and half LIM domain 2 (FHL2), which functions as an adaptor protein in the cytoplasm and transcriptional regulator in the nucleus. We find that TRAF6 also localizes in the nuclei of osteoclasts but not their bone marrow macrophage precursors and that osteoclast intranuclear abundance is specifically increased by RANK ligand (RANKL). TRAF6 nuclear localization requires FHL2 and is diminished in fhl2(-/-) osteoclasts. Suggesting transcriptional activity, TRAF6 interacts with the transcription factor RUNX1 in the osteoclast nucleus. FHL2 also associates with RUNX1 but does so only in the presence of TRAF6. Importantly, TRAF6 recognizes FHL2 and RUNX1 in osteoclast nuclei, and the three molecules form a DNA-binding complex that recognizes and transactivates the RUNX1 response element in the fhl2 promoter. Finally, TRAF6 and its proximal activator, RANKL, polyubiquitinate FHL2, prompting its proteasomal degradation. These observations suggest a feedback mechanism whereby TRAF6 negatively regulates osteoclast formation by intracytoplasmic sequestration of FHL2 to blunt RANK activation and as a component of a transcription complex promoting FHL2 expression."

S., and Moore, M. J. (2003) Mol. Cell 12, 5-14). We show that dMFAP1 binds directly to the Drosophila homologue of Prp38p (dPrp38), a tri-small nuclear ribonucleoprotein component (Xie, J., Beickman, K., Otte, E., and Rymond, B. C. (1998) EMBO J. 17, 2938-2946), and is required for pre-mRNA processing. dMFAP1, like dPrp38, is essential for viability, and our in vivo data show that cells with reduced levels of dMFAP1 or dPrp38 proliferate more slowly than normal cells and undergo apoptosis. Consistent with this, double-stranded RNA-mediated depletion of dPrp38 or dMFAP1 causes cells to arrest in G2/M, and this is paralleled by a reduction in mRNA levels of the mitotic phosphatase string/cdc25. Interestingly double-stranded RNA-mediated depletion of a wide range of core splicing factors elicits a similar phenotype, suggesting that the observed G2/M arrest might be a general consequence of interfering with spliceosome function.

Splicing of pre-mRNAs is a catalytic reaction that involves two successive trans-esterification steps. This process is carried out by a highly conserved ribonucleoprotein complex, called the spliceosome. The spliceosome consists of five snRNAs (U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6) and more than 200 proteins, making it one of the largest and most complex molecular machines studied (1Jurica M.S. Moore M.J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 5-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). Spliceosome assembly is a sequential process that is initiated by the recruitment of the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) 2The abbreviations used are: snRNP, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein; qPCR, quantitative PCRs; MFAP1, microfibrillar-associated protein 1; NTc, 19 complex; RNAi, RNA interference; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GST, glutathione S-transferase; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; RT, reverse transcriptase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PH3, anti-phospho-histone 3. to the 5′-splice donor site to form a “commitment complex” (“E complex” in mammals) (3Rosbash M.

Science. 1988; 242: 1028-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Subsequently, recruitment of the U2 snRNP to the branch site by the U2 auxiliary factor of 65 kDa (U2AF65) generates the “pre-spliceosome” (“A complex” in mammals) (5Zorio D.A. Blumenthal T. Nature. 1999; 402: 835-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 6Wu S. Romfo C.M. Nilsen T.W. Green M.R. Nature. 1999; 402: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 7Merendino L.

RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 2000; 6: 901-911Google Scholar). A preformed U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP unit then joins the U1-U2-pre-mRNA complex to form the “complete spliceosome” (“B complex” in mammals). To activate the complete spliceosome several conformational rearrangements must take place (reviewed in Ref. 9Brow D.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2002; 36: 333-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). These include unwinding of base pairings between U1 and the 5′-splice site and between U6 and U4, as well as the formation of a new base pair interaction between U5 and U6 snRNPs and the 5′-splice site and U6 and U2. As a result, U1 and U4 snRNPs are released and an active spliceosome is formed (10Madhani H.D. Guthrie C. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1994; 28: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 11Staley J.P. Guthrie C. Cell. 1998; 92: 315-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). The yeast RNA helicases Prp28p and Brr2p are both implicated in the structural rearrangements that take place during the activation step of the spliceosome (11Staley J.P. Guthrie C. Cell. 1998; 92: 315-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). Prp28p is thought to be important for the unwinding of base pairings between U1 and the 5′-splice site (12Chen J.Y. Stands L. Staley J.P. Jackups Jr., R.R. Latus L.J. Chang T.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 227-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and Brr2p is implicated in unwinding the U4/U6 duplex, which is essential for the release of U4 snRNP (13Raghunathan P.L. Guthrie C. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 847-855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Moreover, a pre-assembled Prp19p (pre-mRNA processing factor 19 protein)-associated protein complex named the 19 complex (NTc) in yeast and the Cdc5-Prp19 complex in humans is required for maturation of the spliceosome (14Chen C.H.

The ease of generating temperature-sensitive mutant alleles has allowed a detailed functional characterization of individual splicing factors. In contrast, the function of the mammalian spliceosome has mostly been studied by proteomic analysis of spliceosome intermediates (15Makarova O.V. Makarov E.M. Urlaub H. Will C.L. Gentzel M. Wilm M.

The isolation and comparison of different spliceosome intermediates has given insights into the dynamics of the spliceosome and revealed that excision of an intron from a pre-mRNA occurs largely by the same sequential path in yeast and higher eukaryotes (15Makarova O.V.

Science. 2002; 298: 2205-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Importantly, purifications of mammalian spliceosomes have added a vast array of elements to the pre-existing list of conserved core splicing factors. Many of these have no previous connection to splicing and require functional validation (1Jurica M.S. Moore M.J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 5-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). Yeast Prp38p is a U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP component that plays an important role in the maturation of the spliceosome. Prp38p activity is dispensable for the initial assembly of the spliceosome, but is required in a later step for the release of U4 snRNP and activation of the spliceosome (2Xie J. Beickman K. Otte E. Rymond B.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2938-2946Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It has been speculated that Prp38p might recruit (or activate) an RNA unwinding activity necessary for the release of U4 snRNA and the integration of U6 snRNA into the active site of the spliceosome (2Xie J. Beickman K. Otte E. Rymond B.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2938-2946Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The identity of this RNA unwinding activity remains unknown, but Brr2p is a possible candidate. The mammalian Prp38p homologue does not appear to be stably associated with the tri-snRNPs and has been recovered in surprisingly few spliceosomal purifications (1Jurica M.S. Moore M.J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 5-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). This apparent discrepancy between yeast and higher eukaryotes prompted us to study the Drosophila Prp38 protein in more detail. We initially used a proteomics approach to identify proteins associated with dPrp38. In agreement with its function in yeast, dPrp38 associates with several homologues of splicing factors that are required for activation of the spliceosome. In addition, we identified dMFAP1 (microfibrillar-associated protein 1), which binds directly to dPrp38. We show that dMFAP1, like dPrp38, associates with spliceosome components and is required for pre-mRNA processing. Finally, we find that dPrp38 and dMFAP1 are required for normal string/cdc25 mRNA levels and G2/M progression in cultured cells and for cell survival and growth in vivo. Generation of dprp38 Mutant and Transgenic Flies—The G19491 P-element (Genexel Inc.) was inserted 798 bp into the open reading frame of dprp38 (dprp38G19491). The dprp38E1 mutant was generated by mobilization of the G19491 P-element using standard genetic techniques and identified by PCR using the following primers: dPrp38-5.03, CTTTGCTCTCACTGCGGAGCT; dPrp38-3.3: AGCGAGCAAGTAGGAACGGAACGGAACGGC. In dprp38E1, the region between bp 428 and 798 of the open reading frame has been deleted. The dmfap1 D2-1 RNAi line was generated by cloning two 400-bp inverted repeats of dmfap1 into the pMF3 vector using the unique EcoRI and XbaI restriction sites. The 400-bp repeats were amplified from genomic DNA using a forward primer containing a BglII site at the 5′ end and reverse primers containing an EcoRI or a XbaI site at the 3′ end: dMFAP1ForwBglII, GAGAGATCTCGACGAGGTGGAATACGAGG; dMFAP1RevEco, GGAATTCCGAACTTGGTGGTGTCCTGG; dMFAP1RevXba, GTCTAGACGAACTTGGTGGTGTCCTGG. The two PCR products were digested with BglII and EcoRI or BglII and XbaI and cloned into the same pMF3 vector digested with EcoRI and XbaI. The final construct was introduced into the germline by injections in the presence of transposase as previously described (22Rubin G.M. Spradling A.C. Science. 1982; 218: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (2340) Google Scholar, 23Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The dMFAP1 (15610) and dPrp38 (21136) RNAi lines were obtained from the Vienna Drosophila RNAi Center.

Wild-type clones (A-C) or clones expressing dprp38 and dmfap1 RNAi constructs (D-I) were generated using the FLP-out technique (marked with GFP in A, D, and G). Clones with reduced levels of dMFAP1 (D-F) or dPrp38 (G-I) are smaller than control clones (A-C) generated at the same time and undergo apoptosis as measured by increased levels of cleaved caspase 3 staining in the clones (red in E and H).

Rubin G.M. Development. 1993; 117: 1223-1237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Salivary glands and wing and eye imaginal discs were dissected from L3 larvae (120 h after egg laying) in 1× PBS. S2 cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 106/ml on chamber slides (Nunc, Fig. 6, J-M). Tissues and cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature, washed four times in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (PBS-T), blocked for 2 h in PBS-T containing 10% goat serum (PBS-TG), and incubated with primary antibodies in PBS-TG overnight at 4 °C. Rabbit anti-cleaved caspase-3 (Asp175) (Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-dPrp38_C, mouse anti-α-tubulin (Sigma), and rabbit anti-phospho-histone H3 (PH3) (Upstate) were used at 1:500. The next day, cells and tissues were washed, blocked in PBS-TG, and incubated with secondary antibodies at 1:500 (rhodamine red X donkey anti-rabbit, anti-mouse, anti-guinea pig, and fluorescein (isothiocyanate) donkey anti-rabbit from Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 2 h at room temperature. Hoechst (Sigma) was added to the secondary antibody mixture during the last 30 min of the incubation to stain DNA (Fig. 1D). After washes, cells and tissues were mounted in Vectashield. Fluorescence images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM510 Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope (×25 and 40 objectives) and processed using Adobe photoshop CS2. Cell Culture—Drosophila S2 cells were grown in Schneider's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 25 °C. Transfections were done using Effectene (Qiagen). Antibodies—The anti-dPrp38_N and anti-dPrp38_C rabbit antibodies and the anti-dMFAP1 guinea pig antibody were generated and affinity purified by Eurogentec SA (Seraing, Belgium) against peptides corresponding to amino acids 1-15 and 315-330 of dPrp38 and 43-57 of dMFAP1. Plasmids—dPrp38Δ, dPrp38G19491, dMFAP1ΔN, and dMFAP1ΔC were PCR amplified and cloned into the pENTR™/D-TOPO vector using gene-specific primers: for dPrp38Δ, sense primer, CACCATGGCCAACCGCACGGTGAAGG, antisense primer, GATTTCGTTGTTTTCCTCGAG; for dPrp38G19491, sense primer, CACCATGGCCAACCGCACGGTGAAGG, antisense primer, TCCTCGTTGTGGGTGTCCCG; for dMFAP1ΔN, sense primer, CACCATGGACAACGAACCCCGCCTGAAG, antisense primer, TTACTCCATCTTTTTTCGCTTCG; and for dMFAP1ΔC, sense primer, CACCATGAGTGCAGCCACCGCCGCCG, antisense primer, CTCCTCGCTTTCGGTCTCCTC. To generate HA-dPrp38Δ, HA-dPrp38G19491, HA-dMFAP1ΔN, and HA-dMFAP1ΔC, dPrp38Δ, dPrp38G19491, dMFAP1ΔN, and dMFAP1ΔC were cloned into the Gateway pAHW vector (Drosophila Gateway Vector Collection). To generate GST-dMFAP1, dMFAP1 was PCR amplified using gene-specific sense and antisense primers containing EcoRI and NotI restriction sites, respectively, and subcloned into the pGEX4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) using the EcoRI and NotI restriction sites. To generate His-dPrp38, dPrp38 was PCR amplified using gene-specific sense and antisense primers containing KpnI and HindIII restriction sites, respectively, and subcloned into the pRSET-A vector (Invitrogen) using KpnI and HindIII restriction sites. Immunoprecipitation and GST Pull-down—Immunoprecipitations of dPrp38 and dMFAP1 were performed from 1 × 109 (Figs. 3B and 4B) or 1 × 107 (Fig. 3, D and G-J) S2 cells. Cells were lysed in 10 ml (Figs. 3B and 4B) or 200 μl (Fig. 3, D and G-J) of Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 m sodium fluoride, phosphatase inhibitor mixture 2 (Sigma), Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche)), and cell extracts were cleared of membranous material by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min. Extracts were incubated with protein A-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h to reduce nonspecific binding of proteins to the beads in the subsequent purifications. Next, the pre-cleared extracts were incubated with 800 (Figs. 3B and 4B) or 80 μl (Fig. 3, D and G-J) of protein A-Sepharose beads and 10 (Figs. 3B and 4B) or 1 μl (Fig. 3, D and G-J) of the relevant antibody for 2 h. A rabbit anti-GFP antibody was used in the control purifications. Subsequently, beads were washed 3 times in Buffer A, boiled in sample buffer (Invitrogen), and resolved by SDS-PAGE on 8-16% gradient gels (Bio-Rad, Fig. 4B) or 4-12% NuPage BisTris gels (Invitrogen, Fig. 3, B, D, and G-J). Individual protein bands were visualized by Brilliant Blue G-colloidal concentrate (Sigma) staining, cut out, and identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry at the Taplin Biological Mass Spectrometry Facility (Figs. 3B and 4B).FIGURE 4dMFAP1 forms a complex with several splicing factor homologues and is required for pre-mRNA processing.

Western Blotting—Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE using 4-12% gradient gels (Invitrogen) and transferred electrophoretically to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were incubated for 1 h in Blocking Buffer (PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.47 mm KH2PO4, pH 8), 5% milk), and incubated overnight at 4 °C in the same buffer containing primary antibodies at the following dilutions: anti-dPrp38_N, anti-dPrp38_C, anti-dMFAP1, 1:1000; anti-β-tubulin (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank), 1:2000; anti-GST (Cell Signaling Technology), 1:2000. Membranes were washed three times in PBS-T, blocked for 1 h, and probed with secondary antibodies diluted 1:5000 in Blocking Buffer for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes in PBS-T, chemiluminescence was observed using the ECL Plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences). dsRNA—dsRNAs were synthesized with a Megascript T7 kit (Ambion).

Real-time qPCR was performed with Platinum® SYBR® Green qPCR SuperMix-UDG (Invitrogen). PCR was carried out in 96-well plates using the Chromo 4 Real-time qPCR Detection System (MJ Research). All reactions were performed in four replicates. The relative amount of specific mRNAs and pre-mRNAs under each condition was calculated after normalization to the intronless histone 3 (his3) transcript. dPrp38 is a nuclear protein required for developmental growth and proliferation. Budding yeast Prp38p belongs to a family of proteins defined by the presence of a conserved 180-amino acid Prp38 homology domain of unknown function (25Blanton S. Srinivasan A. Rymond B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3939-3947Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Homology searches of the Drosophila proteome revealed a protein encoded by the CG30342 gene, which contains a Prp38 homology domain at its N terminus (Fig. 1A). Overall, the Drosophila protein shares 75% identity with the human Prp38 protein (Prpf38a) and 22% identity with yeast Prp38p (17Chen Y.I. Maika S.D. Stevens S.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 361: 412-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1). We will therefore refer to the CG30342-encoded protein as dPrp38. To characterize dPrp38 in vitro and in vivo, two antibodies were raised against the N and C termini of dPrp38. The antibodies were tested by Western blotting on extracts from cultured Drosophila S2 cells treated with dsRNAs targeting eGFP (control) or dprp38. In control-treated cells, both antibodies recognized a band of the expected size (35 kDa), which was greatly reduced upon RNAi treatment (Fig. 1B). As expected for a splicing factor, staining of cells in the salivary glands of a wild-type animal revealed that dPrp38 is localized exclusively in the nucleus (Fig. 1, C and D). To study dprp38 loss-of-function, we obtained a stock bearing a transposon (P-element) insertion in the open reading frame of dprp38 (dprp38G19491) (Fig. 1A). This insertion is predicted to give rise to a deletion of the last 65 amino acids of dPrp38, and a replacement of this region with two amino acids encoded by the P-element. Indeed, in Western blots of fly extracts from dprp38G19491 animals, we did not detect a product with our C-terminal antibody (Fig. 1E, middle panel), whereas the N-terminal antibody detected a product slightly above the wild-type band (Fig. 1E, top panel). The fact that the mutant band migrates higher than expected may be due to aberrant folding. Next, we used the FLP/FRT system (24Xu T. Rubin G.M. Development. 1993; 117: 1223-1237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to induce mitotic clones of dprp38G19491 mutant tissue in the eye-imaginal discs (the larval precursor of the adult eye) of heterozygous animals (Fig. 1, F and G). By inducing FLP/FRT-mediated recombination in early eye-imaginal discs, it is possible to generate homozygous mutant clones (no GFP), corresponding wild-type twin-spots (two copies of GFP), whereas heterozygous tissue has one copy of GFP (Fig. 1F). Gene dosage affects dPrp38 expression levels because the anti-dPrp38_C staining is brighter in homozygous wild-type than heterozygous tissue, whereas mutant tissue has little detectable staining (Fig. 1G). However, the dprp38G19491 insertion has no detectable effect on clone growth (compare the size of bright green and black areas in Fig"
https://openalex.org/W2092947800,"The translocation of secretory and membrane proteins across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane is mediated by co-translational (via the signal recognition particle (SRP)) and post-translational mechanisms. In this study, we investigated the relative contributions of these two pathways in trypanosomes. A homologue of SEC71, which functions in the post-translocation chaperone pathway in yeast, was identified and silenced by RNA interference. This factor is essential for parasite viability. In SEC71-silenced cells, signal peptide (SP)-containing proteins traversed the ER, but several were mislocalized, whereas polytopic membrane protein biogenesis was unaffected. Surprisingly trypanosomes can interchangeably utilize two of the pathways to translocate SP-containing proteins except for glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins, whose level was reduced in SEC71-silenced cells but not in cells depleted for SRP68, an SRP-binding protein. Entry of SP-containing proteins to the ER was significantly blocked only in cells co-silenced for the two translocation pathways (SEC71 and SRP68). SEC63, a factor essential for both translocation pathways in yeast, was identified and silenced by RNA interference. SEC63 silencing affected entry to the ER of both SP-containing proteins and polytopic membrane proteins, suggesting that, as in yeast, this factor is essential for both translocation pathways in vivo. This study suggests that, unlike bacteria or other eukaryotes, trypanosomes are generally promiscuous in their choice of mechanism for translocating SP-containing proteins to the ER, although the SRP-independent pathway is favored for glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins, which are the most abundant surface proteins in these parasites.

Translocation of secretory protein precursors across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 4The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; SRP, signal recognition particle; RNAi, RNA interference; SP, signal peptide; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; SL, spliced leader; GFP, green fluorescent protein; Tet, tetracycline; TM, transmembrane; gp, glycoprotein; [3H]ethanolamine, [1-3H]ethan-1-ol-2-amine hydrochloride; hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein; mAb, monoclonal antibody; FMK-024, morpholinourea-phenylalanine-homophenylalanine-fluoromethyl ketone; CRAM, cysteine-rich, acidic integral membrane protein. membrane in eukaryotes and the plasma membrane in prokaryotes utilizes two routes. In higher eukaryotes, most proteins are believed to be targeted co-translationally to the ER by the signal recognition particle (SRP) pathway (1Shan S.O. Walter P. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 921-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In the co-translational translocation mechanism, the signal peptide or the transmembrane domain is recognized by the SRP; the ribosome-nascent chain-SRP complex then binds to the membrane via the SRP receptor, and after SRP release the translating ribosome interacts with the translocon (2Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2007; 450: 663-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). The polypeptide chain then moves from the tunnel of the ribosome into the membrane channel using peptide elongation as the driving force for translocation (3Corsi A.K. Schekman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30299-30302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Eukaryotes can also translocate proteins across the ER membrane post-translationally (4Schlenstedt G. Zimmermann R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 5Schlenstedt G. Gudmundsson G.H. Boman H.G. Zimmermann R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13960-13968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Zimmermann R. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 275-282PubMed Google Scholar). It is not known how often this pathway is used in higher eukaryotes, but it is very active in fast growing cells such as yeast (2Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2007; 450: 663-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar, 7Kalies K.U. Hartmann E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The chaperones DNAJ/K bind to the proteins during their translation in the cytoplasm. Translocation via this pathway begins with binding of the translocation substrate to the SEC complex in the ER membrane. During this step, the cytosolic chaperones are released from the substrate (8Plath K. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Translocation depends on the luminal protein Kar2p (BiP in higher eukaryotes) (9Brodsky J.L. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 10Panzner S. Dreier L. Hartmann E. Kostka S. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 561-570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The binding of the protein to BiP inside the lumen of the ER prevents movement back into the cytosol, resulting in net forward translocation. The process of binding BiP is repeated until the protein completely traverses the ER (11Matlack K.E. Misselwitz B. Plath K. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 553-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Both translocation pathways utilize the same channel, which is composed of a conserved heterotrimeric membrane protein complex called the SEC61 complex in eukaryotes and SECY complex in bacteria and archaea (12Osborne A.R. Rapoport T.A. van den Berg B. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 529-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the complex that mediates post-translational translocation was named the SEC complex (10Panzner S. Dreier L. Hartmann E. Kostka S. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 561-570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 13Deshaies R.J. Sanders S.L. Feldheim D.A. Schekman R. Nature. 1991; 349: 806-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The SEC complex is composed of Sec63p, Sec62p, Sec71p, and Sec72p. The first two genes, SEC62 and SEC63, are essential for growth, whereas SEC71 and SEC72 are not (14Feldheim D. Yoshimura K. Admon A. Schekman R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 931-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Mutations in SEC62, SEC71, and SEC72 predominantly affect post-translationally translocated precursors, suggesting that these gene products may be specific for this pathway (10Panzner S. Dreier L. Hartmann E. Kostka S. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 561-570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). In contrast, SEC63 is required for both translocation pathways in vivo (15Young B.P. Craven R.A. Reid P.J. Willer M. Stirling C.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 262-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Sec63p is a polytopic membrane protein that spans the ER membrane three times. Its luminal J-domain interacts with the ER chaperone Kar2p (16Brodsky J.L. Goeckeler J. Schekman R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9643-9646Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In addition to the luminal J-domain, the protein also contains two distinct regions that are conserved in all Sec63p identified so far (17Jermy A.J. Willer M. Davis E. Wilkinson B.M. Stirling C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7899-7906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Part of this region was shown to interact with Sec62p and is necessary only for the post-translational pathway, but another repetitive domain also present in the spliceosomal Brr2p is essential for the function of this protein in both the SRP and the post-translational translocation pathways (17Jermy A.J. Willer M. Davis E. Wilkinson B.M. Stirling C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7899-7906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Mammalian complexes that mediate post-translational translocation across the ER seem to differ from the complexes found in yeast. Mammals possess only SEC62 and SEC63 but not SEC71 and SEC72 (2Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2007; 450: 663-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). Sec62/63 proteins were shown to interact with Sec61p, the translocation channel, but no specific function has been ascribed to these proteins. Interestingly in vitro studies in yeast demonstrate that Kar2p and Sec63p are required for both co- and post-translational translocation (15Young B.P. Craven R.A. Reid P.J. Willer M. Stirling C.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 262-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 16Brodsky J.L. Goeckeler J. Schekman R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9643-9646Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 18Willer M. Jermy A.J. Young B.P. Stirling C.J. Yeast. 2003; 20: 133-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In mammals, these two factors were found not to be essential for co-translational translocation because the Sec61 complex and the SRP receptor are sufficient for co-translational translocation into proteoliposomes (19Görlich D. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 615-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). This discrepancy can be explained assuming that Sec63p plays a regulatory role in translocon gating, which is essential in intact membranes but not in artificial proteoliposomes (17Jermy A.J. Willer M. Davis E. Wilkinson B.M. Stirling C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7899-7906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Unlike eukaryotes, in bacteria such as Escherichia coli, translocation of most, if not all, signal peptide (SP)-containing proteins is mediated by the post-translational route (20Bassford P. Beckwith J. Ito K. Kumamoto C. Mizushima S. Oliver D. Randall L. Silhavy T. Tai P.C. Wickner B. Cell. 1991; 65: 367-368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The SRP pathway is used exclusively for polytopic membrane proteins (21Seluanov A. Bibi E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2053-2055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 22Ulbrandt N.D. Newitt J.A. Bernstein H.D. Cell. 1997; 88: 187-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Very little is known about the mechanisms of protein translocation across the ER in trypanosomes. Trypanosomes possess an unusual SRP complex that contains two RNA molecules, 7SL RNA and a tRNA-like molecule (23Béjà O. Ullu E. Michaeli S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 57: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 24Liu L. Ben Shlomo H. Xu Y.X. Stern M.Z. Goncharov I. Zhang Y. Michaeli S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18271-18280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The Trypanosoma brucei SRP complex is also composed of the four S-domain-binding proteins but lacks the Alu domain-binding proteins (25Lustig Y. Goldshmidt H. Uliel S. Michaeli S. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4551-4562Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Depletion of the SRP pathway by RNAi of SRP54, SRP68, SRP19, or SRP72 does not affect the translocation of several SP-containing proteins to the ER, suggesting the existence of an active SRP-independent pathway for protein translocation (25Lustig Y. Goldshmidt H. Uliel S. Michaeli S. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4551-4562Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 26Liu L. Liang X.H. Uliel S. Unger R. Ullu E. Michaeli S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47348-47357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We suggested that in the absence of the SRP pathway, the SP-containing proteins traverse the ER via an alternative pathway and that mislocalization of the SP-containing proteins results from a defect in intracellular trafficking because of defects in translocation of polytopic membrane proteins (26Liu L. Liang X.H. Uliel S. Unger R. Ullu E. Michaeli S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47348-47357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Indeed we have recently provided evidence that in trypanosomes the SRP pathway is essential for the biogenesis of polytopic membrane proteins (27Lustig Y. Vagima Y. Goldshmidt H. Erlanger A. Ozeri V. Vince J. McConville M.J. Dwyer D.M. Landfear S.M. Michaeli S. Eukaryot. Cell. 2007; 6: 1865-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In elucidating the role of SRP and its receptor in protein translocation, we found that silencing of the trypanosome α subunit of the SRP receptor resulted in a remarkable phenotype, which differs from the phenotype observed following SRP protein silencing. The accumulation of SRP-bound ribosomes on the ER membrane during α subunit of the SRP receptor silencing elicited a signal that led to complete shutoff of spliced leader (SL) RNA transcription. Because in trypanosomes, SL RNA is required for the production of each mRNA by trans-splicing, shutoff of SL RNA transcription stopped mRNA and protein production and led to cell death (28Lustig Y. Sheiner L. Vagima Y. Goldshmidt H. Das A. Bellofatto V. Michaeli S. EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 408-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Protein translocation across the ER in trypanosomes is of special interest because the most important proteins for trypanosome survival within its hosts are GPI-anchored proteins. These include the variant surface glycoproteins that undergo antigenic variation in the bloodstream form of the parasite (29Cross G.A. Parasitology. 1975; 71: 393-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 30Ferguson M.A. Homans S.W. Dwek R.A. Rademacher T.W. Science. 1988; 239: 753-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar) and the EP and GPEET procyclins expressed in the procyclic (insect) form (31Roditi I. Furger A. Ruepp S. Schurch N. Bütikofer P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 91: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These proteins acquire the GPI anchor in the ER and are further modified in the Golgi and at the plasma membrane (32McConville M.J. Mullin K.A. Ilgoutz S.C. Teasdale R.D. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 122-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). It was therefore of great interest to examine whether the translocation and processing of these proteins in trypanosomes differs from that of other SP-containing proteins. In this study, we examined the role of the SRP-independent post-translational translocation to the ER. Our results suggest that trypanosomes, like yeast and unlike higher eukaryotes, possess the SEC complex protein SEC71. RNAi silencing of this factor suggests that SEC71 is essential for parasite survival. Despite the continued translocation of SP-containing proteins to the ER under SEC71 depletion, several proteins were mislocalized. The SP-containing proteins examined in this study either carry SP only, SP and a single transmembrane domain, or SP and a GPI anchor. No effect on polytopic membrane protein biogenesis was observed in these cells. Unlike bacteria and other eukaryotes, trypanosomes seem to be flexible in utilizing either translocation route for most SP-containing proteins. Only the GPI-anchored proteins were severely affected by depleting the SRP-independent translocation route. The promiscuous entry of SP-containing proteins to the ER was blocked by co-silencing of both SEC71 and SRP68 or SEC63, a factor essential for both translocation pathways in yeast. Silencing of SEC63 blocked entry to the ER of both SP and polytopic membrane proteins as well as GPI-anchored proteins, suggesting that in trypanosomes this factor is essential for both translocation routes. Only after depleting the two translocation routes was accumulation of protein precursors observed. This study highlights the role of the SRP-independent pathway in protein sorting in trypanosomes and its role in the biogenesis of GPI-anchored proteins. The trypanosome co-translational machinery seems to be somewhat different from that identified in yeast and mammals. However, both translocation routes are essential for parasite survival. Cell Growth and Transfection—Procyclic forms of T. brucei strain 29-13, which carries integrated genes for T7 polymerase and the tetracycline repressor (33Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), were grown in SDM-79 (34Brun R. Schonenberger M. Acta Trop. 1979; 36: 289-292PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in the presence of 50 μg/ml hygromycin and 15 μg/ml G418. Generation of the stem-loop silencing constructs for SEC71 and SEC63 using the primers described in supplemental Table 1 were performed as described previously (26Liu L. Liang X.H. Uliel S. Unger R. Ullu E. Michaeli S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47348-47357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was prepared with TRIzol reagent, and 20 μg/lane was separated on a 1.2% agarose gel containing 2.2 m formaldehyde. Specific mRNA was detected with α-32P-random labeled probes (Random Primer DNA Labeling Mix, Biological Industries, Co., Kibutz Beit-Haemek, Israel). In Vivo Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—Procyclic cells were labeled with 200 μCi/ml l-[35S]methionine/cysteine (Amersham Biosciences) as specifically indicated in the different experiments. Isolation of Membrane-bound and Soluble Proteins—Cells (5 × 107) were harvested, washed two times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 1 ml of hypotonic buffer (1 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) at 4 °C for 10 min. 200 μl of lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm sucrose, 80 mm potassium acetate) was added, and the extract was passed through a 27-gauge syringe three to five times. The lysate was centrifuged (1000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), and the pellet (membrane fraction) and supernatant (soluble fraction) were separated and acetone-precipitated. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, mounted on poly-l-lysine-coated slides, and fixed in 4% formaldehyde, and immunofluorescence was performed as described in Liu et al. (26Liu L. Liang X.H. Uliel S. Unger R. Ullu E. Michaeli S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47348-47357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Finally the cells were visualized with a Zeiss LSM 510 META inverted microscope. The details of the source and dilution of all antibodies used are presented in supplemental Table 2. Scanning Electron Microscopy—Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, mounted on glass coverslips, and subsequently fixed in glutaraldehyde/paraformaldehyde solution, 2% OsO4, 2% tannic acid/guanidine hydrochloride (35Rothmann C. Levinshal T. Timan B. Avtalion R.R. Malik Z. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. A Mol. Integr. Physiol. 2000; 125: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). After dehydration, the cells were air-dried and gold-coated using a Polaron sputter coater (Fisons). The cells were examined by a Jeol 840 scanning electron microscope (Tokyo, Japan). Western Blot Analysis—Whole cell lysates (106 cell equivalents per lane) were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Protran membranes (Whatman), and probed with the indicated antibodies. The details of the antibodies used are presented in supplemental Table 2. In Vivo Labeling of EP and GPEET Procyclins with Ethanolamine—The GPI anchors of EP and GPEET procyclins were labeled using [1-3H]ethan-1-ol-2-amine hydrochloride ([3H]-ethanolamine; 18-29 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) as described before (36Bütikofer P. Ruepp S. Boschung M. Roditi I. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Subsequently trypanosomes were washed twice to remove unincorporated radioactivity, and an aliquot was counted to determine total uptake of [3H]ethanolamine into cells. Trypanosomes were then extracted with chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v), chloroform:methanol:water (CMW; 10:10:3 by volume), 9% (v/v) butan-1-ol in water (butanol extract), and 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100 in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 (Triton extract) (36Bütikofer P. Ruepp S. Boschung M. Roditi I. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The chloroform:methanol:water-soluble fractions were dried under nitrogen and partitioned between water and butan-1-ol; the resulting water phase contained the free GPIs (37Vassella E. Bütikofer P. Engstler M. Jelk J. Roditi I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1308-1318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Free GPIs and GPI-anchored proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by fluorography. Construction of SEC71-silencing Construct Carrying Blasticidin Resistance—To generate the stem-loop silencing construct for SEC71 carrying a blasticidin resistance gene, the pLew100 construct was digested with the restriction enzymes RsrII and BssHII and ligated with the blasticidin resistance gene fragment amplified with primers 154 and 155 (supplemental Table 1). Cells carrying the silencing construct for SRP68 (25Lustig Y. Goldshmidt H. Uliel S. Michaeli S. J.

Generation of EP1-GFP Construct—The blasticidin S resistance cassette was excised from construct pHD887 (courtesy of C. Clayton, Heidelberg, Germany) using restriction enzymes SmaI and StuI. The DNA fragment was ligated to the pG-Δ164.EG derivative pG-M1.5 (38Engstler M. Boshart M. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2798-2811Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) 5M. Günzel and M.

The resulting plasmid, pGbsr-M1.5, was processed with HindIII and StuI, and the insert was ligated to pTSARib (39Xong H.V. Vanhamme L. Chamekh M. Chimfwembe C.E. Van Den Abbeele J. Pays A.

The EP1-GFP cassette was released from pG-ΔLII.EY (38Engstler M. Boshart M. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2798-2811Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) by restriction with NdeI, treatment with Klenow enzyme, and restriction with HindIII. The insert was ligated to pTSA-Ribsr cut with BamHI, treated with Klenow enzyme, and cut with HindIII. The resulting construct pTSA-Ribsr.EG was linearized with BglII prior to electroporation of trypanosomes. In the EP1-GFP cassette the GFP inserts at position 150 of the open reading frame between the small N-terminal domain and the EP repeats. Generation of the EP1-GFPΔGPI Polypeptide—The EP1-GFPΔGPI was amplified from pKD4.EP1:GFP#C19, deleting the GPI-anchoring sequence by introducing a stop codon directly following the last EP1 repeat. The PCR product lacked nucleotides 1099-1167 (GAATLKSVALPFAIAAAALVAAF) of the EP1 gene. The PCR was amplified using the primers EP.HindIII and EPΔBglII (supplemental Table 1). The PCR product was cut with HindIII and BglII and cloned into pTsrib-(blast). For integration, the resulting construct, pTSA-Ribsr.EG, was linearized with SphI. Trypanosomes Possess a SEC71 Homologue—To study the role of the protein translocation SRP-independent pathway in T. brucei, the genome was first searched for a homologue to SEC71, which participates in protein translocation across the ER in yeast (10Panzner S. Dreier L. Hartmann E. Kostka S. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 561-570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 14Feldheim D. Yoshimura K. Admon A. Schekman R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 931-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A SEC71 homologue was identified only after searching for this protein with a profile that was generated based on multiple alignments of this protein in yeast and other fungi (see Fig. 1). When the T. brucei data base was searched using part of the profile (EXXDXXXXXXXLXPXWXXXXXXXXXEI), it resulted in a single hit. This protein (Tb03.1J15.650) was shown to carry the entire profile. The predicted open reading frame has the same length (206 amino acids) as the S. cerevisiae Sec71p. Alignment of the T. brucei SEC71 predicted amino acid sequence against its homologues from different yeast and fungi is presented in Fig. 1. A single stretch of amino acids that potentially represents a transmembrane domain is predicted between amino acids 33 and 51 (boxed in pink). No N-terminal signal sequence exists in this protein, suggesting that the first transmembrane domain may function in its targeting. The predicted topology of the T. brucei protein based on the Kyte-Doolittle method (40Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17215) Google Scholar) agrees well with that of its yeast homologue (14Feldheim D. Yoshimura K. Admon A. Schekman R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 931-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The yeast proteins possess two potential glycosylation sites in the luminal region upstream to the predicted transmembrane domain. The T. brucei protein homologue also contains such an N-linked glycosylation site (NX(S/T)) upstream to the predicted transmembrane domain. Homologues of SEC71 exist in both Trypanosoma cruzi (Tc00.1047053509453.20) and Leishmania major (LmjF25.1310). To investigate the role of SEC71 in protein translocation, we down-regulated its expression by RNAi. We used a construct that expresses the double-stranded RNA in the form of a stem-loop structure transcribed from the tetracycline-inducible EP promoter (33Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Growth of cells depleted of SEC71 mRNA is presented in Fig. 2A. Growth of the silenced cells (+Tet) was impaired, and the cells stopped growing 4 days after induction. As expected, a major reduction in SEC71 mRNA was observed that was accompanied by an increase in double-stranded RNA production (Fig. 2B). To examine whether SEC71 silencing induced morphological changes, cells were examined by confocal and scanning electron microscopy. The results shown in Fig. 2C reveal no obvious changes in the size or shape of cells in contrast to the major perturbations observed under SRP depletion (25Lustig Y. Goldshmidt H. Uliel S. Michaeli S. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4551-4562Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 27Lustig Y. Vagima Y. Goldshmidt H. Erlanger A. Ozeri V. Vince J. McConville M.J. Dwyer D.M. Landfear S.M. Michaeli S. Eukaryot. Cell. 2007; 6: 1865-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). It should be noted, however, that silencing of essential genes in T. brucei does not necessarily affect cell morphology (41Barth S. Hury A. Liang X.H. Michaeli S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34558-34568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 42Mandelboim M. Barth S. Biton M. Liang X.H. Michaeli S. J. Biol.

Silencing of SEC71 mRNA Does Not Prevent Translocation of SP-containing Proteins—To examine whether SP-containing proteins utilize the SRP-independent pathway, the SEC71 mRNA-depleted cells were analyzed for translocation defects. The results are presented in Fig. 3. In A and B, the effect of SEC71 silencing on p67, a lysosomal protein that is heavily glycosylated, was examined. In T. brucei procyclic forms, mature p67 is present as a 100-kDa glycoprotein (gp100) (43Bangs J.D. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1998; 1: 448-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Cells on the 3rd day of silencing were pulse-chased, and upon immunoprecipitation, the 100-kDa protein was observed (Fig. 3A). The amount of mature p67 was similar in uninduced and induced cells (lanes 3 and 4, respectively), suggesting that p67 is correctly translocated to the ER under SEC71 depletion. To further investigate the processing of p67, the depleted cells were stained with anti-p67 antibodies. The results, presented in Fig. 3B1, show that in uninduced cells the staining was confined to the single lysosome, whereas in induced cells several regions of staining were observed. The aber"
https://openalex.org/W1981527414,"The SH3 and SH2 domain-containing adapter proteins Nck1 and Nck2 are known to function downstream of activated tyrosine kinase receptors, such as the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors. The SH2 domain of Nck1 binds to phosphorylated tyrosine residue 751 in PDGFbeta receptor and has been suggested to have a role in the PDGF-induced mobilization of the actin filament system. Because Tyr-751 is a site for additional receptor interactors, it has been difficult to discriminate the signaling from Nck from signaling via other molecules. For this reason we have used mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from mice in which the genes for Nck1 and Nck2 have been inactivated by gene targeting (knock-out (KO) cells). The mutant cells had a reduced ability to form edge ruffles in response to PDGF, and the presence of Nck was obligatory for the formation of dorsal ruffles. In addition, the KO cells had a reduced chemotactic and migratory potential. Importantly, KO cells had reduced cell attachment properties and a reduced ability to form focal adhesions in response to serum stimulation. Moreover, signaling involving the Rho GTPases was defective in KO cells. In summary, our observations suggest that the Nck adapters are needed for signaling to Rho GTPases and actin dynamics downstream of the PDGFbeta receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2057628223,"GABA(B) receptors are the G-protein-coupled receptors for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. GABA(B) receptors are promising drug targets for a wide spectrum of psychiatric and neurological disorders. Receptor subtypes exhibit no pharmacological differences and are based on the subunit isoforms GABA(B1a) and GABA(B1b). GABA(B1a) differs from GABA(B1b) in its ectodomain by the presence of a pair of conserved protein binding motifs, the sushi domains (SDs). Previous work showed that selectively GABA(B1a) contributes to heteroreceptors at glutamatergic terminals, whereas both GABA(B1a) and GABA(B1b) contribute to autoreceptors at GABAergic terminals or to postsynaptic receptors. Here, we describe GABA(B1j), a secreted GABA(B1) isoform comprising the two SDs. We show that the two SDs, when expressed as a soluble protein, bind to neuronal membranes with low nanomolar affinity. Soluble SD protein, when added at nanomolar concentrations to dissociated hippocampal neurons or to acute hippocampal slices, impairs the inhibitory effect of GABA(B) heteroreceptors on evoked and spontaneous glutamate release. In contrast, soluble SD protein neither impairs the activity of GABA(B) autoreceptors nor impairs the activity of postsynaptic GABA(B) receptors. We propose that soluble SD protein scavenges an extracellular binding partner that retains GABA(B1a)-containing heteroreceptors in proximity of the presynaptic release machinery. Soluble GABA(B1) isoforms like GABA(B1j) may therefore act as dominant-negative inhibitors of heteroreceptors and control the level of GABA(B)-mediated inhibition at glutamatergic terminals. Of importance for drug discovery, our data also demonstrate that it is possible to selectively impair GABA(B) heteroreceptors by targeting their SDs."

The molecular mechanism behind this pathological activity is unclear, and different possibilities ranging from a gain of function to a loss of function have been discussed. γ-Secretase, signal peptide peptidase (SPP) and SPP-like proteases (SPPLs) belong to the same family of GXGD-type intramembrane cleaving aspartyl proteases and share several functional similarities. We have introduced the FAD-associated PS1 G384A mutation, which occurs within the highly conserved GXGD motif of PS1 right next to the catalytically critical aspartate residue, into the corresponding GXGD motif of the signal peptide peptidase-like 2b (SPPL2b). Compared with wild-type SPPL2b, mutant SPPL2b slowed intramembrane proteolysis of tumor necrosis factor α and caused a relative increase of longer intracellular cleavage products. Because the N termini of the secreted counterparts remain unchanged, the mutation selectively affects the liberation of the intracellular processing products. In vitro experiments demonstrate that the apparent accumulation of longer intracellular cleavage products is the result of slowed sequential intramembrane cleavage. The longer cleavage products are still converted to shorter peptides, however only after prolonged incubation time. This suggests that FAD-associated PS mutation may also result in reduced intramembrane cleavage of β-amyloid precursor protein (βAPP). Indeed, in vitro experiments demonstrate slowed intramembrane proteolysis by γ-secretase containing PS1 with the G384A mutation. As compared with wild-type PS1, the mutation selectively slowed Aβ40 production, whereas Aβ42 generation remained unaffected. Thus, the PS1 G384A mutation causes a selective loss of function by slowing the processing pathway leading to the benign Aβ40.

Martoglio B. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 71-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Already early work suggested that, upon ectodomain shedding of βAPP, the remaining membrane-retained stub, the APP C-terminal fragment undergoes intramembrane proteolysis by a physiologically normal mechanism (2Shoji M. Golde T.E. Ghiso J. Cheung T.T. Estus S. Shaffer L.M. Cai X.D. McKay D.M. Tintner R. Frangione B. Younkin S. Science. 1992; 258: 126-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1326) Google Scholar, 3Haass C.

Intramembrane proteolysis is now known for many substrates and either required for the generation of a transactivating intracellular domain (ICD) or for a rather general removal of membrane-retained protein stubs (a membrane proteasome function) (5Kopan R. Ilagan M.X. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). The intramembrane cleaving protease of βAPP turned out to be a high molecular weight complex, termed γ-secretase, which is composed of four subunits, presenilin (PS1 or PS2), Nicastrin, APH-1a/b, and PEN-2 (6Haass C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). The four components are required and sufficient for γ-secretase activity (7Edbauer D. Winkler E. Regula J.T. Pesold B. Steiner H. Haass C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 486-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). PSs share a common active site motif within transmembrane domain (TM) 7, the GXGD motif (8Haass C.

This motif is also present in several other proteases such as the type IV prepilin peptidases, the signal peptide peptidase (SPP), and the SPP-like proteases (SPPL2a, SPPL2b, and SPPL3) (10Weihofen A.

Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 556-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In contrast to γ-secretase, members of the SPP family appear not to require additional components but are rather proteolytically active by themselves (10Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K.

Consistent with that hypothesis, SPP is found within the endoplasmic reticulum, where it is involved in the degradation of signal peptides. Besides degradation of signal peptides, SPP is also involved in immune surveillance, intramembrane processing of the hepatitis C virus core protein (10Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K.

Interestingly, both γ-secretase and SPPL2b substrates undergo multiple and similar intramembrane cleavages (12Fluhrer R. Grammer G. Israel L. Condron M.M. Haffner C. Friedmann E. Bohland C. Imhof A.

For γ-secretase it appears that a cleavage oriented more toward the cytoplasm (ϵ-cleavage) leads to the liberation of an ICD (19Weidemann A. Eggert S. Reinhard F.B. Vogel M. Paliga K. Baier G.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 22Qi-Takahara Y. Morishima-Kawashima M. Tanimura Y. Dolios G. Hirotani N. Horikoshi Y. Kametani F. Maeda M. Saido T.C. Wang R. Ihara Y. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 436-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Because SPP family members cleave type-II proteins (Fig. 1) and their protease active sites are in the opposite orientation as those of PS (23Friedmann E. Lemberg M.K. Weihofen A. Dev K.K. Dengler U. Rovelli G. Martoglio B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50790-50798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), one may also expect opposite cleavage reactions, a hypothesis that is supported by the results presented in this study. PSs contain the most frequently observed FAD-associated mutations (6Haass C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Until now more than 150 PS mutations have been described, which probably all cause early onset AD by a subtle shift of the γ-cleavage within TM of βAPP from position 40 to position 42 of Aβ. The 42-amino acid Aβ42 is highly prone to aggregation and forms neurotoxic Aβ oligomers, which affect long term potentiation and neuronal survival (24Haass C. Selkoe D.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 8: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (3890) Google Scholar). The exact molecular mechanism behind this shift in cleavage precision is currently unclear. However, evidence exists that PS mutations may affect the proximity of the PS N-terminal and C-terminal fragment within the active γ-secretase complex (25Berezovska O. Lleo A. Herl L.D. Frosch M.P. Stern E.A. Bacskai B.J. Hyman B.T. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 3009-3017Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). This may indicate that PS mutations induce structural changes affecting the protease active site embedded within TM6 of the PS NTF and TM7 of the PS C-terminal fragment. Early work already demonstrated that FAD-associated PS mutations fail to rescue the Notch phenotype caused by the loss of the PS homologue in Caenorhabditis elegans while wt human PS was fully functional (26Levitan D. Doyle T.G. Brousseau D. Lee M.K. Thinakaran G. Slunt H.H. Sisodia S.S. Greenwald I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14940-14944Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 27Baumeister R.

Moreover, several rather aggressive PS mutations have been described, which strongly inhibit the production of the Notch ICD (28Moehlmann T. Winkler E. Xia X. Edbauer D. Murrell J. Capell A.

Nevertheless at least some PS mutations appear to rescue the Notch phenotype observed in PS knockout mice (29Davis J.A. Naruse S. Chen H. Eckman C. Younkin S. Price D.L. Borchelt D.R. Sisodia S.S. Wong P.C. Neuron. 1998; 20: 603-609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Thus, it is unclear if FAD-associated PS mutations cause a loss or a (toxic) gain of function (30De Strooper B. EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 31Wolfe M.S. EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 32Shen J. Kelleher 3rd, R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Insights into the pathological mechanisms of PS mutations are highly important not only for the understanding of FAD but also for future treatment strategies aiming to inhibit γ-secretase activity. We have now introduced the FAD-associated PS1 G384A mutation (9Steiner H. Kostka M. Romig H. Basset G. Pesold B. Hardy J. Capell A. Meyn L. Grim M.G. Baumeister R. Fechteler K. Haass C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 848-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) into the homologous and highly conserved motif of SPPL2b. Surprisingly, this results in the accumulation of a longer ICD, which was produced by a slowed sequential cleavage within the membrane of the SPPL2b substrate TNFα. Similar findings were made with the PS1 G384A mutation, which in comparison to wt PS1 exhibits a selectively slowed production of Aβ40, whereas the rate of Aβ42 generation is largely unaffected. Cell Culture, cDNAs, and Transfection—HEK 293 TR cells (Invitrogen GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with Glutamax (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 5 μg/ml blasticidin (Invitrogen), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Using PCR, a HA tag (AYPYDVPDYA) and a stop codon were added to the C termini of all constructs. SPPL2b wt, SPPL2b D421A, and SPPL2b G420A were subcloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pcDNA 4/TO/myc/his A (Invitrogen) and stably transfected into HEK 293 TR cells. Transfection of cells was carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and single cell clones were generated by selection in 200 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen). To induce expression of the SPPL2b constructs, cells were incubated with 1 μg/ml doxycycline (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) added to the cell culture medium for at least 48 h. HEK 293 cells stably co-expressing swAPP and PS1 wt or PS1 G384 have been described (28Moehlmann T. Winkler E. Xia X. Edbauer D. Murrell J. Capell A. Kaether C. Zheng H. Ghetti B. Haass C. Steiner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8025-8030Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The TNFα cDNA was obtained from ATCC (clone AAA61198). Upon addition of a N-terminal FLAG tag (DYKD-DDDK) after the starting methionine and a C-terminal HA tag (YPYDVPDYA) or a C-terminal V5 tag (GKPIPNPLLGLDST) the TNFα cDNA construct was subcloned into the HindIII/XhoI sites of pcDNA 3.1. Hygro+ (Invitrogen). The C-terminally truncated TNFα ΔE construct has been described before (12Fluhrer R. Grammer G. Israel L. Condron M.M. Haffner C. Friedmann E. Bohland C. Imhof A. Martoglio B. Teplow D.B. Haass C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 894-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). TNFα cDNA constructs were co-transfected with the respective SPPL2b variant using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen Life Sciences) according to the supplier's instructions. All cDNA constructs were sequenced for verification. Antibodies, Immunoprecipitation, Immunohistochemical Staining, Immunoblotting, and Deglycosylation Experiments—The monoclonal anti-HA antibody was obtained from Roche Diagnostics GmbH (Mannheim, Germany). The monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 and the polyclonal HA 6908 antibody were obtained from Sigma. A monoclonal antibody to amino acids 536–557 of SPPL2b was generated (CPSE-1H5). The monoclonal anti Aβ antibody 6E10 was purchased from Signet Laboratories. The polyclonal antibody 6687 to the C terminus of APP has been described (9Steiner H. Kostka M. Romig H. Basset G.

To separate individual Aβ species a bis-Tricine-urea gel-system described earlier was used (33Wiltfang J. Smirnov A. Schnierstein B. Kelemen G. Matthies U. Klafki H.W. Staufenbiel M. Huther G.

Where indicated, cells were treated with the SPPL2b inhibitor (Z-LL)2-ketone (Calbiochem) (34Weihofen A. Lemberg M.K. Ploegh H.L. Bogyo M. Martoglio B. J. Biol.

Proteins were immunoblotted and detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence technique (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK). For quantitation the chemiluminescence signals of at least three independent experiments were measured with a CD camera-based imaging system (Alpha Innotec, Kasendorf, Germany). γ-Secretase in vitro assays were carried out as described using recombinant C100-His6 substrate (7Edbauer D. Winkler E. Regula J.T. Pesold B. Steiner H. Haass C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 486-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). A partially purified γ-secretase preparation was used as enzyme source. 4Winkler et al., manuscript in preparation. Radiosequencing—HEK 293 cells stably expressing SPPL2b wt and transiently expressing TNFαΔE were metabolically labeled with [3H]valine or [3H]leucine (Hartmann Analytic, Germany) for 16 h, supernatants were collected, and TNFα C-domain peptides were isolated by immunoprecipitation with antibody HA6908 (Sigma) separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Radiolabeled proteins were detected by autoradiography, excised, and subjected to radiosequencing, essentially as described (3Haass C. Schlossmacher M.G. Hung A.Y. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Mellon A.

Altered Proteolytic Processing of TNFα by SPPL2b Carrying an FAD-like Mutation—γ-Secretase and SPP/SPPL family members share a number of similar biochemical properties (18Sato T. Nyborg A.C. Iwata N.

Dis. 2007; 4: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Moreover, several sequence motifs in the catalytic subunits of γ-secretase, PS1 or PS2, and SPP family members are conserved. These include the two active site domains, the YD and GXGD motif in TM6 and TM7, as well as a PAL motive in TM9 (10Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B.

Golde T.E. Goate A. J. Neurochem. 2006; 96: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A very aggressive FAD-associated PS1 mutation (PS1 G384A) immediately N-terminal to the critical aspartate residue in TM7 of PS1 helped to elucidate the importance of the GXGD domain for PS and led to the definition of the new family of GXGD-type aspartyl proteases (8Haass C. Steiner H. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 556-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 9Steiner H. Kostka M. Romig H. Basset G. Pesold B. Hardy J. Capell A. Meyn L. Grim M.G. Baumeister R. Fechteler K. Haass C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 848-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The PS1 G384A mutation (Fig. 2A) strongly affects the precision of the γ-secretase cleavage causing a substantial relative increase of pathological Aβ42 (9Steiner H. Kostka M. Romig H. Basset G. Pesold B. Hardy J. Capell A. Meyn L. Grim M.G. Baumeister R. Fechteler K. Haass C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 848-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 38Bentahir M. Nyabi O. Verhamme J.

To prove if such a single amino acid exchange could also affect the cleavage precision of other GXGD-type aspartyl proteases, the corresponding conserved glycine residue in SPPL2b was mutagenized to alanine, creating SPPL2b G420A (Fig. 2A). Like wt SPPL2b, the SPPL2b G420A mutant became endoglycosidase H-resistant upon expression in HEK 293 cells, which is consistent with normal transport through the secretory pathway (Fig. 2B). Moreover, mutant and wt SPPL2b showed a similar distribution within the secretory pathway, including a giantin-positive Golgi compartment (Fig. 2C). Co-expression of TNFα, the only SPPL2b substrate with a known physiological function (14Friedmann E. Hauben E. Maylandt K. Schleeger S. Vreugde S. Lichtenthaler S.F. Kuhn P.H. Stauffer D. Rovelli G. Martoglio B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), allows monitoring of intramembrane proteolysis (12Fluhrer R. Grammer G. Israel L. Condron M.M. Haffner C. Friedmann E. Bohland C. Imhof A. Martoglio B. Teplow D.B. Haass C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 894-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). As reported before (12Fluhrer R. Grammer G. Israel L. Condron M.M. Haffner C. Friedmann E. Bohland C. Imhof A. Martoglio B. Teplow D.B. Haass C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 894-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), wt SPPL2b produces ∼6-kDa TNFα ICD peptides (Fig. 2D). ICD formation also occurs upon expression of the FAD-like SPPL2b G420A mutation (Fig. 2D). Interestingly, the ICD peptides produced under these conditions by the SPPL2b G420A mutation migrated at a slightly higher molecular weight (Fig. 2D). The elongated TNFα ICD peptide is a specific cleavage product of SPPL2b G420A, because its generation is blocked by (Z-LL)2-ketone, a selective inhibitor of the SPP-family (Fig. 2E) (10Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). These findings may suggest that the FAD-like mutation exhibits an altered activity, which in analogy to mutant PS may lead to the generation of a slightly elongated cleavage product. However, in clear contrast to the elongated Aβ peptide produced by mutant γ-secretase, this fragment accumulates within cell lysates. Thus, consistent with the reverse orientation of the active site motifs in TM6 and TM7 (23Friedmann E. Lemberg M.K. Weihofen A. Dev K.K. Dengler U. Rovelli G. Martoglio B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50790-50798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), the products of intramembrane proteolysis of TNFα by SPPL2b are released into the opposite direction as compared with γ-secretase substrates. Mutant SPPL2b Does Not Affect the Generation of the Secreted TNFα C-domain—To prove the reverse release of SPPL2b cleavage products as compared with γ-secretase cleavage products, we next analyzed the secreted TNFα C-domain (Fig. 1). Upon co-expression of the C-terminal HA-tagged TNFαΔE (12Fluhrer R. Grammer G. Israel L. Condron M.M. Haffner C. Friedmann E. Bohland C. Imhof A. Martoglio B. Teplow D.B. Haass C. Nat.

Interestingly, and in contrast to the ICDs, the TNFα C-domains produced by wt and G420A mutant SPPL2b co-migrated suggesting equal cleavage sites (Fig. 3A). To ensure that the C-domain species secreted from the two cell lines are indeed produced by endoproteolytic cleavage at identical sites we radiosequenced their N termini. Sequencing the N termini of the secreted C-domain species from either SPPL2b wt- or SPPL2b G420A-expressing cells revealed no difference in the cleavage site (Fig. 3B).

Despite the homology of this iron-sulfur protein to aconitase, previously studied homoaconitases catalyze only the hydration of cis-homoaconitate to form homoisocitrate rather than the complete isomerization of homocitrate to homoisocitrate. The MJ1003 and MJ1271 proteins from the methanogen Methanocaldococcus jannaschii formed the first homoaconitase shown to catalyze both the dehydration of (R)-homocitrate to form cis-homoaconitate, and its hydration is shown to produce homoisocitrate. This heterotetrameric enzyme also used the analogous longer chain substrates cis-(homo)(2)aconitate, cis-(homo)(3)aconitate, and cis-(homo)(4)aconitate, all with similar specificities. A combination of the homoaconitase with the M. jannaschii homoisocitrate dehydrogenase catalyzed all of the isomerization and oxidative decarboxylation reactions required to form 2-oxoadipate, 2-oxopimelate, and 2-oxosuberate, completing three iterations of the 2-oxoacid elongation pathway. Methanogenic archaeal homoaconitases and fungal homoaconitases evolved in parallel in the aconitase superfamily. The archaeal homoaconitases share a common ancestor with isopropylmalate isomerases, and both enzymes catalyzed the hydration of the minimal substrate maleate to form d-malate. The variation in substrate specificity among these enzymes correlated with the amino acid sequences of a flexible loop in the small subunits."
https://openalex.org/W2037926784,"P2X(1) receptors belong to a family of cation channels gated by extracellular ATP; they are found inter alia in smooth muscle, platelets, and immune cells. Suramin has been widely used as an antagonist at P2X receptors, and its analog 4,4',4'',4'''-[carbonylbis(imino-5,1,3-benzenetriylbis(carbonylimino))] tetrakis-benzene-1,3-disulfonic acid (NF449) is selective for the P2X(1) subtype. Human and mouse P2X(1) receptors were expressed in human embryonic kidney cells, and membrane currents evoked by ATP were recorded. ATP (10 nm to 100 microm) was applied only once to each cell, to avoid the profound desensitization exhibited by P2X(1) receptors. Suramin (10 microm) and NF449 (3-300 nM) effectively blocked the human receptor. Suramin had little effect on the mouse receptor. Suramin and NF449 are polysulfonates, with six and eight negative charges, respectively. We hypothesized that species differences might result from differences in positive residues presented by the large receptor ectodomain. Four lysines in the human sequence (Lys(111), Lys(127), Lys(138), and Lys(148)) were changed individually and together to their counterparts in the mouse sequence. The substitution K138E, either alone or together with K111Q, K127Q, and K148N, reduced the sensitivity to block by both suramin and NF449. Conversely, when lysine was introduced into the mouse receptor, the sensitivity to block by suramin and NF449 was much increased for E138K, but not for Q111K, Q127K, or N148K. The results explain the marked species difference in antagonist sensitivity and identify an ectodomain lysine residue that plays a key role in the binding of both suramin and NF449 to P2X(1) receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2083824873,"It has been suggested that Oct-3/4 may regulate self-renewal in somatic stem cells, as it does in embryonic stem cells. However, recent reports raise the possibility that detection of human Oct-3/4 expression by RT-PCR is prone to artifacts generated by pseudogene transcripts and argue against a role for Oct-3/4 in somatic cells. In this study, we clarified Oct-3/4 expression in mouse somatic tissues using designed PCR primers, which can exclude amplification of its pseudogenes. We found that novel alternative transcripts are indeed expressed in somatic tissues, rather than the normal length transcripts in germline and ES cells. The alternative transcripts indicate the expression of two kinds of truncated proteins. Furthermore, we determined novel promoter regions that are sufficient for the expression of Oct-3/4 transcript variants in somatic cells. These findings provide new insights into the postnatal role of Oct-3/4 in somatic tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2017128292,"Overexpression of the ped/pea-15 gene in mice impairs glucose tolerance and leads to diabetes in conjunction with high fat diet treatment. PED/PEA-15 is also overexpressed in type 2 diabetics as well as in euglycemic offspring from these subjects. The cause(s) of this abnormality remains unclear. In the present work we have cloned and localized the promoter region of the human PED/PEA-15 gene within the first 230 bp of the 5(R)-flanking region. A cis-acting regulatory element located between -320 and -335 bps upstream the PED/PEA-15 gene transcriptional start site (+1) is recognized by both the hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha (HNF-4alpha) and the chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor II (COUP-TFII), two members of the steroid/thyroid superfamily of transcription factors, both of which are involved in the control of lipid and glucose homeostasis. HNF-4alpha represses PED/PEA-15 expression in HeLa cells, whereas COUP-TFII activates its expression. In hepatocytes, the activation of PED/PEA-15 gene transcription is paralleled by the establishment of a partially dedifferentiated phenotype accompanied by a reduction in mRNA levels encoded by genes normally expressed during liver development. Cotransfection of HeLa cells with a reporter construct containing the PED/PEA-15 response element and various combinations of HNF-4alpha and COUP-TFII expression vectors indicated that COUP-TFII antagonizes the repression of the PED/PEA-15 gene by HNF-4alpha. Thus, at least in part, transcription of the PED/PEA-15 gene in vivo is dependent upon the intracellular balance of these positive and negative regulatory factors. Abnormalities in HNF-4alpha and COUP-TFII balance might have important consequences on glucose tolerance in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2037417622,"The Drosophila phototransduction cascade transforms light into depolarizations that are further shaped by activation of voltage-dependent K+ (Kv) channels. In whole-cell recordings of isolated photoreceptors, we show that light selectively modulated the delayed rectifier (Shab) current. Shab currents were increased by light with similar kinetics to the light-induced current itself (latency ∼20 ms), recovering to control values with a t1/2 of ∼60 s in darkness. Genetic disruption of PLCβ4, responsible for light-induced PIP2 hydrolysis, abolished this light-dependent modulation. In mutants of CDP-diaclyglycerol synthase (cds1), required for PIP2 resynthesis, the modulation became irreversible, but exogenously applied PIP2 restored reversibility. The modulation was accurately and reversibly mimicked by application of PIP2 to heterologously expressed Shab channels in excised inside-out patches.

In Drosophila photoreceptors, light-dependent activation of TRP and TRPL channels produces an inward current, carried mainly by calcium and sodium ions, creating a light-dependent depolarization. This voltage-change is opposed by opening of at least four types of voltage-activated K+ channels (Kv channels): a rapidly inactivating A current mediated by Shaker channels (Hardie et al., 1991Hardie R.C.

Novel potassium channels encoded by the Shaker locus in Drosophila photoreceptors.Neuron. 1991; 6: 477-486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), a slow delayed rectifier (Shab), and two others responsible for a fast delayed rectifier and a slow, noninactivating current (Hardie, 1991Hardie R.C.

Phototransduction in Drosophila photoreceptors is mediated by a canonical phospholipase C (PLC) signaling cascade located in the microvillar part of the photoreceptors (rhabdomeres), where temporal fluctuations in the number of absorbed photons are transformed into modulation of membrane voltage (Hardie and Raghu, 2001Hardie R.C. Raghu P. Visual transduction in Drosophila.Nature. 2001; 413: 186-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, Niven et al., 2003Niven J.E. Vähäsöyrinki M. Kauranen M. Hardie R.C. Juusola M. Weckström M. The contribution of Shaker K+ channels to the information capacity of Drosophila photoreceptors.Nature. 2003; 421: 630-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In the cascade, light triggers (via rhodopsin isomerization and G proteins) the activation of the phospholipase C isoform β4 (PLCβ4, encoded by the norpA gene). This catalyzes hydrolysis of the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate (PIP2) into soluble inositol-1,4,5,-triphosphate (InsP3) and membrane-bound diacylglycerol (DAG). Of these, DAG or one of its metabolites leads eventually to opening of the Ca2+- and Na+-permeable TRP and TRPL channels (encoded by the trp and trpl genes), while most available evidence suggests that InsP3 plays no role in the photoreceptor's light response (for reviews see Hardie and Raghu, 2001Hardie R.C.

The continuous functionality of the photoreceptors is maintained by regeneration of PIP2 in a cyclic, enzymatic pathway (the PI cycle, see Figure 9). This means that illumination of the photoreceptor activates turnover of its membrane lipids and dynamically modulates their composition (Wu et al., 1995Wu L. Niemeyer B. Colley N. Socolich M.

Chem. 2004; 279: 47773-47782Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In the present work, we show that the delayed rectifier K+ channel (encoded by shab) is selectively, rapidly, and reversibly upregulated by light stimulation. Our analysis indicates that this is due to the depletion of PIP2 by PLC. Because this modulation is coupled to the activation of the phototransduction cascade, it has the potential to form an automated light adaptation mechanism. In whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of Drosophila photoreceptors, positive command voltages evoke large voltage-dependent potassium (Kv) currents. These are conducted by potassium channels encoded by shaker and shab genes and by one or more unidentified channels that make only minor contributions to the whole-cell currents (Hardie, 1991Hardie R.C. Voltage-sensitive potassium channels in Drosophila photoreceptors.J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 3079-3095Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Vähäsöyrinki et al., 2006Vähäsöyrinki M. Niven J.E. Hardie R.C.

Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2652-2660Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It has been shown that Shaker is the dominant component of the A-type current (Hardie, 1991Hardie R.C. Voltage-sensitive potassium channels in Drosophila photoreceptors.J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 3079-3095Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Hardie et al., 1991Hardie R.C. Voss D. Pongs O. Laughlin S.B. Novel potassium channels encoded by the Shaker locus in Drosophila photoreceptors.Neuron. 1991; 6: 477-486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and that Shab channels conduct the slow delayed rectifier current (Vähäsöyrinki et al., 2006Vähäsöyrinki M. Niven J.E. Hardie R.C. Weckström M. Juusola M. Robustness of neural coding in Drosophila photoreceptors in the absence of slow delayed rectifier K+ channels.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2652-2660Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) (Figure 1). Activation and inactivation kinetics of Shaker channels are unusually rapid (a few milliseconds) compared to most other K+ channels, whereas, depending on the potential, Shab requires ∼10–30 ms to fully activate and several seconds to inactivate. In order to test whether illumination of photoreceptors could modulate Kv channels, we recorded Kv currents before and after stimulation by light. Standard light stimulation (consisting of ten repeated 100 ms light flashes, defined in Experimental Procedures) of wild-type (WT) photoreceptors increased the Kv currents activated by +10 mV command voltage pulses by up to 30%. This effect was most obvious for the late component of the Kv current response, which is dominated by Shab (Figure 1A). After light stimulation, the I/V curve of the late, presumptive Shab peak current clearly shifted to hyperpolarized potentials (leftward shift) (Figure 1B). Particularly at low but physiologically relevant potentials (−40 to −20 mV), this parallel shift resulted in a large (∼3-fold) relative increase of conductance. The increase in the Kv current usually developed fully by the time of the first measurement after standard illumination, namely within 10 s of stimulation (see further below). Repeated measurements in the dark showed that the current typically recovered to baseline levels within ∼2 min (τ1/2 ∼60 s) (Figure 2) and when tested could be induced at least a second time in the same photoreceptor (data not shown). The described effects did not depend on the eye color (data not shown). In principle, the apparent increase of the presumptive Shab current could also be caused by reduction of the residual inactivation of the Shaker channels. The inactivation time course of the Shaker current consists of a fast N-type inactivation and a slow C-type inactivation, which is superimposed on the time course of the slow delayed rectifier current (Roeper et al., 1997Roeper J. Lorra C. Pongs O. Frequency-dependent inactivation of mammalian A-type K+ channel Kv1.4 regulated by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3379-3391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In order to test whether the apparent light-dependent modulation of the slow delayed rectifier current is caused by a modulation of Shaker C-type inactivation, we repeated the experiment using the shKS133 mutants. In shKS133, the channel protein carries a V429D point mutation, which results in expression of nonfunctional Shaker channels (Lichtinghagen et al, 1990Lichtinghagen R. Stocker M. Wittka R. Boheim G. Stuhmer W. Ferrus A. Pongs O. Molecular basis of altered excitability in Shaker mutants of Drosophila melanogaster.EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4399-4407PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, standard light stimulation induced a similar leftward shift of the I/V curve to that measured in WT (Figures 1C and 1D), indicating that the modulation was not mediated by Shaker channels. When the data were plotted in terms of conductance (g) to generate the voltage dependence of activation (Figures 1E and 1F), it was apparent that absolute gmax values were not altered by illumination (before light, 20.3 ± 1.7 nS SEM; after light, 20.1 ± 0.4 nS SEM; n = 4) but that the modulation could be described by a parallel leftward shift of ∼10 mV and that an increase of open probability Po of the channels rather than a change in single-channel conductance is responsible for the enhanced currents. These findings showed that illumination of photoreceptors in WT and shKS133 mutant flies resulted in a leftward shift of the activation curve, leading to an increase in the delayed rectifier current at a given potential. Below, this phenomenon will be called light-dependent modulation (LDM) of the delayed rectifier current. To further test whether the LDM was specific to Shab channels, we recorded Kv currents in shab2 and shab1 mutants. In shab2, the channel protein carries a V608D point mutation in the entryway to the pore (Hegde et al., 1999Hegde P. Gu G.G. Chen D. Free S.J. Singh S. Mutational analysis of the Shab-encoded delayed rectifier K(+) channels in Drosophila.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22109-22113Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In photoreceptors of shab2 mutants, no Shab current could be detected. The residual current, which is probably conducted by the other Kv channels, was 54% of the amplitude of Shab peak current in WT with voltage commands to +10 mV (shab2: 617 ± 36 pA SEM, n = 7; WT: 1140 ± 39 pA SEM, n = 18, p < 0.01). In marked contrast to the results obtained in WT or shKS133 mutants, standard light stimulation of shab2 photoreceptors now no longer influenced the remaining Kv current, with both the Shaker peak current and the following residual currents remaining unaltered (Figure 3A, cf. Figures 2B and 2C). Thus, LDM of the slow delayed rectifier is specific to the Shab channels. In the shab1 mutant, the channel protein carries an R435Q point mutation in the last amino acid N-terminal to the first transmembrane segment. In shab1 photoreceptors, the mutant channel protein still generated substantial currents, which were only reduced by 13% (currents at +10 mV shab1: 982 ± 37 pA SEM, n = 17; WT: 1140 ± 39 pA SEM, n = 18, p < 0.01). However, standard light stimulation no longer influenced the Shab current in shab1 mutant photoreceptors, indicating that Arg435 is required for induction of LDM (Figure 3B). To investigate the modulation of kinetic parameters of the Shab current, long activating voltage pulses (5 s) were applied to photoreceptors of shKS133 mutant flies. This allowed monitoring of activation and complete inactivation of the Shab current (Figure 3C). The kinetics of activation, in terms of time to peak, did not change upon standard illumination. Inactivating currents of a set of nine photoreceptors were fitted with a two-component exponential function (Equation 3) (Hardie, 1991Hardie R.C. Voltage-sensitive potassium channels in Drosophila photoreceptors.J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 3079-3095Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Immke et al., 1999Immke D. Wood M. Kiss L. Korn S.J. Potassium-dependent changes in the conformation of the Kv2.1 potassium channel pore.J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 819-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The averaged parameters of the fitted function are presented in Table 1. After standard light stimulation, only the amplitude of the slow inactivating component of Shab (Aslow) was significantly modulated. A graphical representation of the parameters of Table 1 is shown in Figure 3D. It has been shown previously that, depending on the occupational state of the pore, Shab-type channels can exist in two conformations, one of which inactivates much more slowly than the other (Immke et al., 1999Immke D. Wood M. Kiss L. Korn S.J. Potassium-dependent changes in the conformation of the Kv2.1 potassium channel pore.J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 819-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Selective upregulation of the amplitude of Aslow indicates that only those channel proteins residing in the slow inactivating conformation were affected by LDM.Table 1Kinetic Inactivation ParametersAfastτfastAslowτslowISSBefore light686 ± 460.379 ± 0.014296 ± 331.654 ± 0.212504 ± 26After light666 ± 750.43 ± 0.021440 ± 481.946 ± 0.426500 ± 33Significant difference (p ≤ 0.05)−−+−−Parameters are derived from fitting the decay of Shab outward currents with Equation 3.

Afast and τfast are amplitude and time constant of the fast inactivating component, Aslow and τslow of the slow inactivating component, respectively. ISS is the steady-state current (mean ± SEM, n = 9). As previously described, a fast delayed rectifier, which inactivates over a time course of tens of milliseconds and which is probably mediated by Shal channels, is also found in ∼50% of the photoreceptors (Hardie, 1991Hardie R.C. Voltage-sensitive potassium channels in Drosophila photoreceptors.J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 3079-3095Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Vähäsöyrinki et al., 2006Vähäsöyrinki M. Niven J.E. Hardie R.C.

Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2652-2660Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We recorded such a current in four of the nine measured photoreceptors, but since the inactivation time constant of this current is much faster than of Shab (Table 1), the random appearance of the putative Shal current does not affect the conclusion drawn above. In summary, experiments using shKS133, shab1, and shab2 mutant flies showed that LDM in photoreceptors is specific to the Shab current and that a point mutation (R435Q) in the N terminus of the Shab protein abolishes the regulation. Kinetic analysis implies that LDM relies on a selective upregulation of the slow inactivating conformation of the Shab channel. What is the mechanism whereby light stimulation causes a leftward shift of the activation curve of Shab and the concomitant increase in K+ current? The light response in Drosophila photoreceptors results in massive Ca2+ influx via TRP channels, which is believed to raise the intracellular Ca2+ concentration throughout the cell by at least 10 μM and in the microvilli by as much as 1 mM (Hardie, 1996Hardie R.C.

In addition, many Ca2+-sensitive regulatory pathways and Ca2+-sensitive enzymes, including CaMKII and PKC, are present in Drosophila photoreceptors (Matsumoto et al., 1994Matsumoto H. Kurien B.T. Takagi Y. Kahn E.S. Kinumi T. Komori N. Yamada T. Hayashi F. Isono K. Pak W.L.

Calcium influx via TRP channels is required to maintain PIP2 levels in Drosophila photoreceptors.Neuron. 2001; 30: 149-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Therefore, we first asked whether TRP-mediated Ca2+ influx might induce the LDM of Shab channels as proposed by Peretz et al., 1998Peretz A. Abitbol I. Sobko A. Wu C.F. Attali B. A Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase modulates Drosophila photoreceptor K+ currents: a role in shaping the photoreceptor potential.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9153-9162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. However, recording the Shab current in Ca2+-free external solution did not support this hypothesis (Figure 4A), since robust and reversible LDM was still observed under these conditions. Even though the decay of the LDM seemed to be impeded, it was apparent that at the same time the control Kv current (with no light stimulation) gradually increased under these conditions. After taking this into account, the LDM also showed typical decay to baseline under Ca2+-free (extracellular) conditions. The light-induced current response plotted in Figure 4A (left) is typical for recordings in Ca2+-free solution and is explained by the absence of Ca2+-dependent negative feedback (e.g., Hardie et al., 2001Hardie R.C. Raghu P. Moore S. Juusola M. Baines R.A. Sweeney S.T.

To complement the results obtained with Ca2+-free external solution, we measured Kv currents in trpl;trp double mutants, lacking both classes of light-sensitive channel (Niemeyer et al., 1996Niemeyer B.A. Suzuki E. Scott K. Jalink K. Zuker C.S.

Geng C. Pak W.L. Phenotypes of trpl mutants and interactions between the transient receptor potential (TRP) and TRP-like channels in Drosophila.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6797-6803PubMed Google Scholar). Illumination of trpl;trp photoreceptors leads to activation of the complete phototransduction cascade, but does not result in any light-induced current (Figure 4B, left) or Ca2+ influx. However, also here Shab channels showed a clear LDM. Thus, the initiator of LDM is located upstream of TRP/TRPL in the phototransduction cascade and does not require Ca2+ influx. Interestingly, in both Ca2+-free solution and the trpl;trp double mutant, the LDM of Shab channels was more pronounced than in WT photoreceptors in physiological, Ca2+-containing solutions (e.g., compare Figure 2B and Figure 4B). This would be consistent with the LDM being mediated by PLC, since net PIP2 hydrolysis by PLC is greatly increased in the absence of Ca2+ influx, which normally strongly inhibits PLC (Hardie et al., 2001Hardie R.C. Raghu P. Moore S. Juusola M. Baines R.A. Sweeney S.T. Calcium influx via TRP channels is required to maintain PIP2 levels in Drosophila photoreceptors.Neuron. 2001; 30: 149-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, Hardie et al., 2004Hardie R.C.

Chem. 2004; 279: 47773-47782Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The fact that the modulation measured in the trpl;trp mutant was even greater than in Ca2+-free solutions may reflect the fact that in the latter situation the light response overlaps slightly with the first recording after standard illumination (10 s). This leads to reduced early Kv current measurements (10 s) and becomes apparent in a flattened and slowed time course of LDM. In contrast, in trpl;trp photoreceptors in the absence of any light response, the early (10 s) measurement after standard illumination represents more accurately the instantaneous Shab channel regulation. To test more directly the role of PLC in light-dependent Shab channel regulation, we performed experiments in norpAP24, which is a null or near null mutant of PLCβ4 (Pearn et al., 1996Pearn M.T. Randall L.L. Shortridge R.D. Burg M.G. Pak W.L. Molecular, biochemical, and electrophysiological characterization of Drosophila norpA mutants.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4937-4945Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, Leung et al., 2000Leung H.T. Geng C. Pak W.L. Phenotypes of trpl mutants and interactions between the transient receptor potential (TRP) and TRP-like channels in Drosophila.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6797-6803PubMed Google Scholar). We actually used a norpA;trp double mutant, since there is a low level of spontaneous TRP channel activity in norpA (Hardie et al., 2003Hardie R.C. Martin F. Chyb S. Raghu P. Rescue of light responses in the Drosophila “null” phospholipase C mutant, norpAP24, by the diacylglycerol kinase mutant, rdgA, and by metabolic inhibition.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18851-18858Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Upon standard light stimulus, neither a light response nor any indication of LDM could be observed (Figure 4C). This confirms the requirement for PLC and suggests that its substrate, PIP2, or its products, DAG or InsP3, are involved in the initiation of LDM. Taken together, these experiments indicate that the LDM is initiated by either reduction of PIP2 or increase of DAG or InsP3. Any requirement for light-induced and TRP-mediated Ca2+ influx can be excluded. In order to test the possible role of InsP3 as initiator of LDM of Shab channel, we employed a mosaic null mutant of the only known Drosophila InsP3 receptor, itpr90B.0 (Raghu et al., 2000Raghu P. Colley N.J. Webel R. James T. Hasan G. Danin M. Selinger Z. Hardie R.C. Normal phototransduction in Drosophila photoreceptors lacking an InsP(3) receptor gene.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 15: 429-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). After standard light stimulation, photoreceptors of itpr90B.0 showed LDM of Shab peak current indistinguishable from that observed in WT (Figure 5A). This excludes a possible role of the InsP3 receptor in LDM. As the most familiar role of InsP3 is to mediate release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, we also measured LDM of Shab channels using pipettes containing BAPTA (2 mM free BAPTA, 110 nM free Ca2+) to buffer intracellular Ca2+. These measurements were made in trpl;trp double mutants to prevent Ca2+ influx from the extracellular space. Following standard light stimulation, the Shab current recorded with BAPTA in the pipette showed similar regulation to control experimen"
https://openalex.org/W2057179438,"Membrane binding by prothrombin, mediated by its N-terminal fragment 1 (F1) domain, plays an essential role in its proteolytic activation by prothrombinase. Thrombin is produced in two cleavage reactions. One at Arg(320) yields the proteinase meizothrombin that retains membrane binding properties. The second, at Arg(271), yields thrombin and severs covalent linkage with the N-terminal fragment 1.2 (F12) region. Covalent linkage with the membrane binding domain is also lost when prethrombin 2 (P2) and F12 are produced following initial cleavage at Arg(271). We show that at the physiological concentration of prothrombin, thrombin formation results in rapid release of the proteinase into solution. Product release from the surface can be explained by the weak interaction between the proteinase and F12 domains. In contrast, the zymogen intermediate P2, formed following cleavage at Arg(271), accumulates on the surface because of a approximately 20-fold higher affinity for F12. By kinetic studies, we show that this enhanced binding adequately explains the ability of unexpectedly low concentrations of F12 to greatly enhance the conversion of P2 to thrombin. Thus, the utilization of all three possible substrate species by prothrombinase is regulated by their ability to bind membranes regardless of whether covalent linkage to the F12 region is maintained. The product, thrombin, interacts with sufficiently poor affinity with F12 so that it is rapidly released from its site of production to participate in its numerous hemostatic functions."
https://openalex.org/W2063862316,"BRCA2 is closely related to the pathogenesis of breast cancer. In the present study, we found that estrogen can activate BRCA2 transcription, which is estrogen receptor (ER) alpha-dependent. During estrogen treatment, ERalpha interacted with CREB-binding protein/p300, p68/p72, and MyoD and formed an activating transcriptional complex that could bind to many Sp1 sites on the BRCA2 promoter and activate its transcription by inducing histone acetylations. MyoD is a new component of ERalpha complex. ERbeta or p53 attenuated ERalpha-mediated transcriptional activation by preventing the recruitment of ERalpha transcriptional complex and histone acetylations on the BRCA2 promoter. ERbeta interacted with ERalpha and CREB-binding protein/p300 and formed a weak activating transcriptional complex that competed for binding to Sp1 sites with ERalpha transcriptional complex and slightly attenuated BRCA2 transcription. Different from ERbeta, p53 interacted with HDAC1 and CtBP1 and formed an inhibiting transcriptional complex that could compete for binding to Sp1 sites with ERalpha transcriptional complex and inhibit BRCA2 transcription more significantly."

The double mutant M59A/H115A of the p47phox-PX domain caused a significant inhibition of the affinity binding to cPLA2. Thus, Ile67 of the cPLA2-C2 domain is identified as a critical, centrally positioned residue in a hydrophobic interaction in the p47phox-PX domain. The NADPH oxidase is a multicomponent electron carrier that transfers electrons from NADPH to molecular oxygen to form superoxide, a precursor of microbicidal oxidants. NADPH oxidase subunits include four cytoplasmic components, p47phox, p67phox, p40phox, and Rac2, and a hetero-dimeric transmembrane glycoprotein flavocytochrome b558 composed of gp91phox and p22phox (for reviews see Refs. 1Leto T.L.

Essential roles for at least four of the phox components is evident from studies on chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) 2The abbreviations used are: CGD, chronic granulomatous disease; cPLA2, cytosolic phospholipase A2α; SH3, Src homology 3; NCF1, neutrophil cytosolic factor 1; CBR, calcium binding region; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MNK1, MAPK interacting kinase; FRET, Förster resonance energy transfer; PX, phox homology; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; fMLP, formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine; GST, glutathione S-transferase; aa, amino acid(s). 2The abbreviations used are: CGD, chronic granulomatous disease; cPLA2, cytosolic phospholipase A2α; SH3, Src homology 3; NCF1, neutrophil cytosolic factor 1; CBR, calcium binding region; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MNK1, MAPK interacting kinase; FRET, Förster resonance energy transfer; PX, phox homology; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; fMLP, formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine; GST, glutathione S-transferase; aa, amino acid(s). patients, who suffer from inherited defects in NADPH oxidase-dependent microbial killing due to defect in the genes encoding these oxidase proteins (3Roos D. de Boer M. Kuribayashi F. Meischl C. Weening R.S. Segal A.W. Ahlin A. Nemet K. Hossle J.P. Bernatowska-Matuszkiewicz E. Middleton-Price H. Blood. 1996; 87: 1663-1681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In resting cells, p47phox, p67phox, and p40phox exist as a tight cytosolic complex dissociated from the membrane-bound flavocytochrome. Upon stimulation, the cytosolic components translocate to the plasma membrane and associate with the flavocytochrome b558 to form the assembled active oxidase. Based on studies of p47phox-deficient cells from chronic CGD patients (4Heyworth P.G. Curnutte J.T. Nauseef W.M. Volpp B.D. Pearson D.W. Rosen H. Clark R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), p47phox appears to have a key role in translocation of the cytosolic subunits. p47phox possesses a phox homology (PX) domain, tandem SH3 domains, a series of basic residues, and phosphorylation targets that is also referred to as an autoinhibitory region, and a proline-rich region in the C terminus. In resting cells, p47phox is found in an autoinhibited state due to intramolecular interactions among the PX domain, the tandem Src homology 3 (SH3) domains, and polybasic sequences of p47phox, thereby preventing its binding to membranes (5Ueyama T. Kusakabe T. Karasawa S. Kawasaki T. Shimizu A. Son J. Leto T. Miyawaki A. Saito N. J. Immunol. 2008; 181: 629-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In stimulating cells, the restrictive conformation of the autoinhibitory region of p47phox is released through phosphorylation of several critical serine residues within its polybasic region (6Ago T. Nunoi H. Ito T. Sumimoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33644-33653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Conformational changes in p47phox following phosphorylation result in unfolding and exposing the now interactive SH3 domains that direct its translocation to the membranes by binding to specific targets in p22phox and its PX domain that specifically binds phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate and phosphatidic acid on the plasma membrane (7Sato T.K.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5057-5068Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Neither p40phox nor p67phox is able to translocate to membranes in the absence of p47phox, as evidenced by the cytoplasmic location of p40phox and p67phox in stimulated cells from CGD patients who lack a functional p47phox (10Dusi S. Donini M. Rossi F. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 409-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, it appears that p40phox functions in retention of p47phox and p67phox on phagosome membranes through interactions of its PX domain with phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, as well as interactions of its PB1 and SH3 domains with p47phox and p67phox, respectively (11Ueyama T. Tatsuno T. Kawasaki T. Tsujibe S. Shirai Y. Sumimoto H. Leto T. Saito N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 441-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).Cytosolic phospholipase A2α (cPLA2), which hydrolyzes phospholipids containing arachidonate at the sn-2 position (12Clark J.D. Milona N. Knopf J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7708-7712Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), has been implicated as the major enzyme in the formation of eicosanoids. cPLA2 has two functionally distinct domains: an N-terminal C2 domain necessary for Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding, and a C-terminal Ca2+-independent catalytic region (13Nalefski E.A. Sultzman L.A. Martin D.M. Kriz R.W. Towler P.S. Knopf J.L. Clark J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18239-18249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was shown that cPLA2 translocates from the cytosol to the nuclear membrane and to the endoplasmic reticulum by an increase in cytoplasmic [Ca2+] in a variety of cells (14Glover S. de Carvalho M.S. Bayburt T. Jonas M. Chi E. Leslie C.C. Gelb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15359-15367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The C2 domain of cPLA2 has been cocrystallized with calcium (15Dessen A. Tang J. Schmidt H. Stahl M. Clark J.D. Seehra J. Somers W.S. Cell. 1999; 97: 349-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), and the structure revealed that it binds two calcium ions at one end of the domain between three loops, called calcium binding regions (CBRs): CBR1, CBR2, and CBR3 (16Essen L.O. Perisic O. Lynch D.E. Katan M. Williams R.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2753-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The calcium ions neutralize the negative electrostatic potential surrounding the hydrophobic residues located at the tips of CBRs 1 and 3, thereby facilitating their interactions with the hydrophobic portions of the lipid head groups of PC-enriched membranes (16Essen L.O. Perisic O. Lynch D.E. Katan M. Williams R.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2753-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of cPLA2 is important for regulating release of arachidonic acid in cells, but this process is not clearly understood. The catalytic domain of cPLA2 contains several functionally important phosphorylation sites (for review see Ref. 17Ghosh M. Tucker D. Burchett S. Leslie C. Prog. Lipid Res. 2006; 45: 487-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), Ser505, Ser727, and Ser515, which are phosphorylated by mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), mitogen-activated protein kinase interacting kinase (MNK1), or a related MAPK-activated protein kinase, and calmodulin kinase II, respectively. It is suggest that, depending on the cell type and agonist used for activation, phosphorylation may function to regulate cPLA2 catalytic activity and membrane binding.We have previously demonstrated an essential requirement for cPLA2 in activation of the assembled phagocyte NADPH oxidase (18Dana R. Leto T.L. Malech H.L. Levy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 441-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), the oxidase-associated H+ channel (19Lowenthal A. Levy R. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 33495-33503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The absolute requirement of cPLA2 for oxidase activation is in line with other studies (21Li Q.

In contrast, phagocytes from cPLA2-deficient mice showed a normal stimulated superoxide release (24Rubin B.B. Downey G.P. Koh A. Degousee N. Ghomashchi F. Nallan L. Stefanski E. Harkin D.W. Sun C.

Our most recent study (25Shmelzer Z. Haddad N. Admon E. Pessach I. Leto T.L. Eitan-Hazan Z. Hershfinkel M. Levy R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) demonstrated that in peripheral blood neutrophils and granulocyte-like PLB-985 cells, cPLA2 translocates to the plasma membrane by interacting with the assembled oxidase complex in addition to its translocation to nuclear membranes. Thus, the ability of cPLA2 to colocalize in two different compartments in the same cells enables it to participate in both eicosanoid production and to regulate NADPH oxidase activation. The activation and translocation of cPLA2 by PMA (25Shmelzer Z. Haddad N. Admon E. Pessach I. Leto T.L. Eitan-Hazan Z. Hershfinkel M. Levy R. J.

J. 1997; 326: 867-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), which does not induce an increase in cytoplasmic [Ca2+], together with its translocation to the plasma membrane suggest the existence of alternative pathways for inducing translocation of cPLA2 that are distinct from the C2 domain phospholipid-binding mechanism. In agreement with our results, it was recently reported (27Girotti M. Evans J.H. Burke D. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19113-19121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) that during phagocytosis of zymosan, cPLA2 translocates in a Ca2+-independent manner to the forming phagosomes in kinetics similar to acquisition of the plasma membrane and prior to phagolysosome fusion. The aim of the present study was to explore the nature of the interaction between cPLA2 and the assembled NADPH oxidase, which anchors cPLA2 to the plasma membrane upon stimulation of neutrophils or granulocyte-like PLB cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESNeutrophil Purification—Neutrophils from healthy volunteers or from CGD patients were separated by Ficoll/Hypaque centrifugation, dextran sedimentation, and hypotonic lysis of erythrocytes (18Dana R. Leto T.L. Malech H.L. Levy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 441-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). p47phox-deficient CGD patients and p67phox-deficient CGD patients lacking expression of these cytosolic oxidase proteins due to mutations in the genes for neutrophil cytosolic factor 1 on chromosome 7q11.23 and in the gene for neutrophil cytosolic factor 2, located on 1q25, respectively, were enrolled in the study. The study was approved by the institutional Human Research Committee of the Soroka University Medical Center.Cell Culture and Differentiation—PLB-985 leukemic cell lines and gp91phox-deficient PLB-985 cells lacking normal expression of normal gp91phox (X-CGD), provided by M. C. Dinauer (James Whitcomb Riley Hospital for Children, Indianapolis, IN), were grown in stationary suspension culture in RPMI 1640 and differentiated toward the granulocyte phenotype with 10-6m retinoic acid as described earlier (18Dana R.

Chem. 2001; 276: 33495-33503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).Cell Stimulation—Cells (5 × 106 cells/ml) in Hanks' balanced salt solution buffer were incubated with 1 mg/ml opsonized zymosan prepared as described before (28Hazan-Halevy I. Seger R. Levy R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12416-12423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), 50 ng/ml PMA or 5 × 10-7m fMLP for 3 min at 37 °C.Superoxide Anion Measurements—The production of superoxide anion (O2.) by intact cells was measured as the superoxide dismutase inhibitable reduction of ferricytochrome c (18Dana R.

Chem. 1998; 273: 441-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar).Isolation of Membrane and Cytosol Fractions—Isolation of membrane and cytosol fractions was performed exactly as described earlier (29Levy R. Rotrosen D. Nagauker O. Leto T.L. Malech H.L. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 2595-2601PubMed Google Scholar).Coimmunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation was performed as described earlier (25Shmelzer Z. Haddad N. Admon E. Pessach I. Leto T.L. Eitan-Hazan Z. Hershfinkel M. Levy R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The detection of cPLA2 or the NADPH oxidase components after SDS-PAGE electrophoresis was analyzed as described previously (26Hazan I. Dana R. Granot Y. Levy R. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 867-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).Bacterial Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—PCR was used to subclone the different cPLA2 regions: C2, Lid, or catalytic domain B, in-frame into the expression vector pGEX-4T-2 using primers containing the EcoRI or XhoI restriction endonucleases sites (underlined): 5′-TATAGAATTCTGTCATTTATAGATCCTTAC-3′,5′-TATACTCGAGATTAAACTTCAAGAGACATTTCTAG-3′,5′-TATAGAATTCGATTTTTTATGGGAACAG-3′, 5′-TATACTCGAGATTACTGTCCACTACATGAA-3′, 5′-TATAGAATTCCGCGAATATATGAGCCTC-3′, and 5′-TATACTCGAGCTATGCTTTGGGTTTATT-3′, respectively. The template used was pMT2 plasmid containing the cloned gene from the cDNA library. GST catalytic domain A construct has been described earlier (26Hazan I. Dana R. Granot Y. Levy R. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 867-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The GST fusion proteins were overexpressed and purified as described previously (30Leto T.L. Adams A.G. de Mendez I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sc.i U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10650-10654Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). To isolate the p47phox N-terminal protein, the GST protein was cleaved from GST-p47phox N-terminal protein by the addition of 5 μg of factor Xa (New England Biolabs).Overlay Assay—Recombinant p47phox and p67phox were a kind gift from Prof. Edgar Pick (Tel-Aviv University, Israel). The different cPLA2 fusion proteins or cell lysates of 5 × 107 (25Shmelzer Z. Haddad N. Admon E. Pessach I. Leto T.L. Eitan-Hazan Z. Hershfinkel M. Levy R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) were separated on SDS-PAGE gel without β-mercaptoethanol and boiling. Protein renaturation was performed by incubation in 25% isopropanol solution for 30 min before immunoblotting (20Pessach I. Leto T.L. Malech H.L. Levy R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33495-33503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).Affinity Binding Assay—GST or GST fusion proteins were added to lysates of resting or stimulated neutrophils or to recombinant p47phox N-terminal in phosphate-buffered saline, and were tumbled end-over-end for 1 h at room temperature. The samples were washed six times with phosphate-buffered saline, boiled in SDS sample buffer, and separated SDS-PAGE before immunoblotting.FRET Analysis—Glass-adherent neutrophils or granulocyte-like PLB cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, either resting or after stimulation for 3 min with 50 ng/ml PMA. The cells were co-immunostained with anti-cPLA2 mouse monoclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and either p67phox or p47phox polyclonal rabbit antibodies (31Leto T.L. Garrett M.C. Fujii H. Nunoi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19812-19818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and with Cy3-conjugated (anti-rabbit IgG) and Cy5-conjugated (anti-goat IgG) secondary antibodies, respectively (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted 1:500/1:4000 for neutrophils and 1:400/1:500 for granulocyte-like PLB cells, respectively. Cells were imaged with a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope using the 543 nm Green HeNe laser line and a 560-615 nm band-pass filter for Cy3 and the 633 nm Red HeNe laser line and a 650 long pass filter for Cy5. Under these conditions, bleed-through between the Cy3 and Cy5 channels was insignificant. Cy3-sensitized emission of Cy5 was measured directly in the Cy5 channel while exciting Cy3 with the 543 nm line. A relative FRET index was calculated by normalizing the intensity of Cy3-sensitized Cy5 emission by the direct Cy3 emission intensity. FRET was further validated by donor recovery after acceptor photobleaching (32Kenworthy A.K. Methods. 2001; 24: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), by comparing Cy3 emission intensity before and after selective photobleaching of Cy5 with the 633 nm laser line. Mean fluorescence intensities were measured by calculating the average gray level of a circular region of interest encompassing each analyzed cell, correcting each channel for the background (offset), the average autofluorescence (determined in unstained samples), and the low bleed through between channels (calculated using singly stained samples).Neutrophil Permeabilization and Superoxide Production—Neutrophils were electroporated exactly as described earlier (20Pessach I. Leto T.L. Malech H.L. Levy R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33495-33503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) based on a previous study (34Grinstein S. Furuya W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1779-1783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of the synthetic peptides on binding and NADPH oxidase activity was studied as described (35Rotrosen D. Kleinberg M.E. Nunoi H. Leto T. Gallin J.I. Malech H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8745-8750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cell suspension was supplemented with 800 μm synthetic peptides (Sigma) incubated on ice for 30 min, centrifuged, and resuspended in the same supplemented buffer containing 200 μm peptide and 150 mm cytochrome c, stimulated for immediate measurement of superoxide production at 22 °C.Molecular Modeling—p47phox-PX with bound phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate was docked to the C2 domain of cPLA2 (36Perisic O. Fong S. Lynch D.E. Bycroft M. Williams R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1596-1604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) using the protein-protein docking program MolFit (37Katchalski-Katzir E. Shariv I. Eisenstein M.

Eisenstein M. Proteins. 2004; 56: 130-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The initial step consisted of MolFit docking of the p47phox-PX in complex with phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate and cPLA2-C2 domain (36Perisic O. Fong S. Lynch D.E. Bycroft M. Williams R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1596-1604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) (PDB code 1rlw), employing translational interval of 1.05 Å and rotational interval of 12°. The docking models were filtered, selecting models in which the active site in the catalytic domain of intact cPLA2 (15Dessen A. Tang J. Schmidt H. Stahl M. Clark J.D. Seehra J. Somers W.S. Cell. 1999; 97: 349-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) pointed toward the membrane, as deduced from the position of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate. In the second docking stage, the interactions of inhibitory peptides identified experimentally in this study were up-weighted. A similar filtering procedure for the position of the active site of cPLA2 was employed as in the first docking stage, and the accepted models were clustered. The final models were energy-minimized. Details of the procedure are given as supplemental text.Mutagenesis of Expression Vectors—pGEX-4T-2 expression vector encoding the cDNA of cPLA2-C2 domain or pGEX-3X expression vector encoding the cDNA of p47phox-PX domain were used as a template, to generate the desired mutations introduced according to the molecular modeling, and generated by the overlap extension PCR (41Ho S. Hunt H. Horton R. Pullen J. Pease L. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6795) Google Scholar). The PCR reactions, using appropriate complementary synthetic oligonucleotides introducing the desired mutation and two additional primers at the ends of the cPLA2-C2 fragment and of p47phox-PX, were performed with Red Load Taq Master/high yield using Thermostable DNA polymerase (Larova, Germany) with appropriate complementary synthetic oligonucleotides that introduced the desired mutation and two additional primers at the ends of the cPLA2-C2 fragment. The mutated products were digested with EcoRI and XhoI or with BamH1 and EcoRI and cloned into pGEX-4T-2 or pGEX-3X expression vectors, respectively, digested with the same enzymes. The vectors were then transformed into Escherichia coli DH-101. The mutated fragments were sequenced using the ABI3100 Genetic Analyzer. The first three mutations in cPLA2-C2 (F35A plus M38A plus L39A) were mutated in combination to generate triple mutation. The I67A mutation was mutated alone or in addition to the three mutations shown above. M59A and H115A in the p47phox-PX were mutated alone or together.Statistical Analysis—The mean differences were analyzed by Student's t test.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONFlavocytochrome b558 Alone Is Not Sufficient to Anchor cPLA2 to Plasma Membranes after Cell Stimulation—To define the exact binding domains between cPLA2 and the assembled NADPH oxidase we first explored the oxidase subunits responsible for recruitment of cPLA2 to the plasma membrane. To study whether cPLA2 binds the cytochrome b558, cPLA2 translocation to the plasma membranes was examined in undifferentiated X-CGD PLB cells transduced with full-length gp91phox (XCGD-gp91) as reported in our previous studies (20Pessach I. Leto T.L. Malech H.L. Levy R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33495-33503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 25Shmelzer Z. Haddad N. Admon E. Pessach I. Leto T.L. Eitan-Hazan Z. Hershfinkel M. Levy R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, membranes were prepared from XCGD-gp91 PLB cells expressing gp91phox protein, and its level did not change after differentiation. Stimulation with PMA did not cause any translocation of cPLA2 to the plasma membrane of undifferentiated XCGD-gp91phox PLB cells that do not express any other cytosolic oxidase subunits, indicating that cPLA2 does not bind the gp91phox itself. During differentiation the cells acquire the NADPH oxidase subunits as reported previously (18Dana R. Leto T.L. Malech H.L. Levy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 441-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In the presence of the cytosolic oxidase subunits in differentiated XCGD-gp91phox PLB cells, stimulation did cause translocation of cPLA2 to the plasma membranes, consistent with assembly of the oxidase, as determined by the translocation of p47phox. In addition, the specific protein kinase C inhibitor GF-109203X attenuated PMA-stimulated translocation of both p47phox and cPLA2 in a similar dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B), consistent with our previous study reporting that GF-109203X causes the same dose response inhibition of p47phox phosphorylation, oxidase assembly, and activity (26Hazan I. Dana R. Granot Y. Levy R. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 867-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that cPLA2 does not bind directly to flavocytochrome b558 but, rather, binds to the assembled oxidase complex.cPLA2 Is Bound to p47phox in the Assembled Oxidase—To determine which cytosolic component in the assembled oxidase is bound to cPLA2 after stimulation, neutrophils from p67phox-deficient CGD patients were studied, as shown by immunoblot of their cytosol (Fig. 2A). Activation of these cells resulted in translocation of p47phox and cPLA2 to the membrane fractions (Fig. 2A) similar to the translocation of these proteins in neutrophils from healthy donors, who express all oxidase components (Fig. 2C). In contrast, when neutrophils from p47phox-deficient CGD patients were stimulated, there was no translocation of either p67phox or cPLA2 (Fig. 2B). The lack of p67phox translocation is expected, because it is dependent on the translocation of p47phox, which is missing in these cells.

The mechanism of PPARgamma-mediated down-regulation of follistatin was investigated using non-transformed, rat intestinal epithelial cells (RIE-1). RIE cells expressed activin A, the activin receptors ActRI and ActRII, and the follistatin-315 mRNA. RIE-1 cells responded to endogenous activin A, and this response was antagonized by follistatin, as evidenced by changes in cell growth and regulation of an activin-responsive reporter. Using RIE-1 cells, we show that activation of PPARgamma by rosiglitazone reduced follistatin mRNA levels in a dose- and concentration-dependent manner. Down-regulation of follistatin by rosiglitazone required the DNA binding domain of PPARgamma and was dependent upon dimerization with the retinoid X receptor. Inhibition of follistatin expression by rosiglitazone was not associated with decreased follistatin mRNA stability, suggesting that regulation may be at the promoter level. Analysis of the follistatin promoter revealed consensus binding sites for AP-1, AP-2, and Sp1. Targeting the AP-1 pathway with SP600125, an inhibitor of JNK, and TAM67, a dominant negative c-Jun, had no effect on PPARgamma-mediated down-regulation of follistatin. However, the follistatin promoter was dramatically regulated by Sp1, and this regulation was inhibited by PPARgamma expression. Knockdown of Sp1 expression relieved repression of follistatin levels by rosiglitazone. Moreover, PPARgamma was found to interact with Sp1 and repress its transcriptional activation function. Collectively, our data indicate that repression of Sp1 transcriptional activity by PPARgamma is the underlying mechanism responsible for PPARgamma-mediated regulation of follistatin expression."

We show that one of the conserved sequence regions in the C-terminal domain of Ptch1 is responsible, at least in part, for rapid turnover. This sequence is absent in the stable Ptch2 protein. The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway participates in patterning organs of both vertebrates and insects, and misregulation of the pathway has been implicated in several human diseases. Genetic and biochemical studies have identified many components that contribute to the production of active secreted Hh protein and to the receipt of and response to Hh by receiving cells. However, key features of Hh signal transduction remain poorly understood. In particular, the mechanism by which Hh engages its receptor and activates signal transduction are unclear. Current models posit that Patched (Ptc), a transmembrane protein, engages Hh on the surface of Hh-responsive cells, but how it does so and how it regulates the downstream Hh signal transduction pathway is not understood. In humans, Ptch1 has been identified as a tumor suppressor (1Hahn H. Wicking C. Zaphiropoulous P.G. Gailani M.R. Shanley S. Chidambaram A. Vorechovsky I. Holmberg E. Unden A.B. Gillies S. Negus K.

Although the Ptc tertiary structure has not been determined, secondary structure predictions suggest that Ptc proteins have 12 transmembrane-spanning domains, two large extracellular loops, and a C-terminal domain (CTD). 3The abbreviations used are: CTD, C-terminal domain; SSD, sterol-sensing domain; RLM-RACE, RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Structure/function studies have ascribed distinct functions to some of these domains. First, indirect evidence that Ptc binds Hh has been reported for both vertebrate Ptch1 (3Carpenter D. Stone D.M.

Based upon the phenotypes of loop 2 deletions, Hh binding has been attributed to the second extracellular loop (10Briscoe J. Chen Y. Jessell T.M. Struhl G. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1279-1291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar).

The NPC-1 family of proteins transports lipophilic molecules across membranes. Genetic studies suggest that Ptc negatively regulates Hh signal transduction unless bound by Hh. Sequence analysis suggests that Ptc is structurally similar to the RND family of channels and transporters (14Tseng T.T. Gratwick K.S. Kollman J. Park D. Nies D.H. Goffeau A. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Mol. Microbiol.

Transporter activity would be consistent with the lack-of-function phenotype of Ptc protein mutants with altered residues that are conserved in and are required for activity of bacterial RND transporters (9Taipale J.

One RND family transporter, the proton-driven Escherichia coli AcrB protein, is a homotrimer with a central pore (20Murakami S. Nakashima R. Yamashita E. Yamaguchi A. Nature. 2002; 419: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar), and recent evidence suggests that Ptc is also a trimer (8Lu X. Liu S. Kornberg T.B. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2539-2551Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). A number of distinct functions are also encoded in the Ptc CTD. Activation of the Hh pathway correlates with relocalization of Ptc from the plasma membrane to endosomes (21Capdevila J. Pariente F. Sampedro J. Alonso J.L. Guerrero I.

Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1240-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), movement that is dependent upon the CTD. The ptc13 mutant has a missense change in the CTD (E1172K) and a partial loss-of-function phenotype; its endosomal localization is decreased (19Strutt H. Thomas C. Nakano Y. Stark D. Neave B. Taylor A.M. Ingham P.W. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 608-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Deletion of the CTD also affects localization and results in plasma membrane accumulation (8Lu X. Liu S. Kornberg T.B. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2539-2551Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 24Zhu A.J. Zheng L. Suyama K. Scott M.P. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1240-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The CTD can form a homotrimer, and it contains a PPAY sequence, a putative target site for the Nedd4 ubiquitin ligase (8Lu X. Liu S. Kornberg T.B. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2539-2551Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). CTD deletions are more stable than the wild-type protein (8Lu X. Liu S. Kornberg T.B. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2539-2551Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 9Taipale J. Cooper M.K. Maiti T. Beachy P.A. Nature. 2002; 418: 892-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Several mutations in the CTD of human Ptc1 have been identified in human cancers (25Lindstrom E. Shimokawa T. Toftgard R. Zaphiropoulos P.G. Hum. Mutat. 2006; 27: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Drosophila has a single ptc gene, but most vertebrates have two, customarily named Patched1 (Ptch1) and Patched2 (Ptch2). In general, these gene designations reflect the relative order of discovery, not function or sequence subtype. This study describes a bioinformatics analysis with the goal of establishing a basis for categorizing the members of the Ptc protein family. Because the CTD sequences are significantly less well conserved than other Ptc domains (8Lu X. Liu S. Kornberg T.B. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2539-2551Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), their variability was used to define two subtypes. One (Group I) includes the invertebrate Ptc proteins and the Ptch1 proteins of human, mouse, dog, frog, chick, zebrafish, monkey, and rat as well as the Ptch2 protein of zebrafish. Group I CTDs are characterized by having two conserved domains, a PPXY sequence, and a size between 205 and 279 residues. The CTDs of Group II proteins have abbreviated versions of the two conserved domains, lack a PPXY sequence, and are shorter, containing between 75 and 109 residues; they likely represent a novel mammalian divergence. We also show that the PPXY sequence in the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of Ptch1 is responsible, at least in part, for rapid turnover. The Ptch2 protein is relatively stable; it lacks a PPXY sequence. Gene Predictions—The amino acid sequences of Ptc orthologs were collected from the GenBank™ Data Bank. To expand the set of Ptc CTD sequences, genomic sequences were also accessed using the UCSC Genome Browser (26Kent W.J. Baertsch R. Hinrichs A. Miller W. Haussler D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11484-11489Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar) and Fly-Base. Using these sources and tools, we gathered the genomic sequences of putative Ptc orthologs based upon their homology to ptc genes in human, mouse, and Drosophila melanogaster. Homologous genomic regions, plus 3 kb of additional sequence on either end, were analyzed with three gene prediction programs: Genescan (27Burge C. Karlin S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 78-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (3098) Google Scholar), Augustus (28Stanke M. Schoffmann O. Morgenstern B. Waack S. BMC Bioinformatics. 2006; 7: 62Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar), and GeneID (29Parra G. Blanco E. Guigo R. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Results from the programs varied slightly, and choices between different gene predictions were made as follows. The predictions were aligned with the sequences of “evolutionary relatives”: D. melanogaster Ptc for insects and mouse and human Ptc1 and Ptc2 for vertebrates. Alignments were created using ClustalW, tCOFFEE (30Notredame C. Higgins D.G. Heringa J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (5514) Google Scholar), or MUSCLE Version 3.7 (31Edgar R.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1792-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (31027) Google Scholar). Results were displayed in Jalview (32Clamp M. Cuff J. Searle S.M. Barton G.J. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2004; 20: 426-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar). Because introns were more frequently mistaken for exons than the reverse and because we are concerned primarily with the CTD, predictions were chosen to minimize false inserts within the tail region. mRNA Extraction and cDNA Formation—Seven Drosophila species were analyzed: D. ananassae, D. mojavensis, D. persimilis, D. pseudoobscura, D. virilis, D. simulans, and D. yakuba. RNA was extracted from 15 third-instar larvae and fractionated by selection with oligo(dT), and first-strand cDNA was synthesized using the RETROscript® kit (Ambion). Mid-neurula stage Xenopus tropicalis embryos (stages 14-18) were from R. Harland (University of California, Berkeley, CA); zebrafish embryos (18-somite stage) were from S. Amacher (University of California, Berkeley). mRNA was purified with the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen Inc.). cDNAs were synthesized using ∼2.0 μg of total mRNA and the FirstChoice® RLM-RACE kit (Ambion). Canis familiaris and Rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) cDNAs were purchased from BioChain Institute. Primer Design for Reverse Transcription-PCR—Primers were designed based upon predicted CTD sequences and were chosen to span ∼300 bp of intron. PCR-amplified cDNA was purified after separation by agarose gel electrophoresis. Primer sequences were as follows: D. ananassae, GTCAAGTTCGAGGGCTTT and ACTCGTAAAGTTGTAGCTGCG (Rev1); D. simulans, CCTGCCCAACTATCCATC and CTCTTGCTGCTGCGCAC; D. mojavensis and D. virilis, CAAGACACTGATTGGACACATAC and Rev1; D. pseudoobscura, CGACCTGAAGATACCCAAGA and Rev1; D. yakuba, CTCAGATGCCCTTTTACCTTC and Rev1; C. familiaris, TGCTGGGAGTGCTGATG and GTTGGAGCTACCGCCC; M. mulatta, GTTTTGCTTCCCGTGCTTT and GTTGGAGCTGCTTCCCC; Danio rerio, TGCTATTCCTGTGGTCATCCT (first RLM-RACE forward primer) and TGCCTCCTCCTATGAACCAC and CTATTTACCTAGCATCTGGTTAGCTTG (PCR primers); and X. tropicalis TTTGCTGTCCTGGCAATTTT (first RLM-RACE forward primer) and ATGATTCCCAGCAGTGTTCC and TTATTTTGAGGCATTTCCCTGT (PCR primers). Amplifications were performed using the High Fidelity PCR Master (Roche Applied Science). For sequencing, PCR-amplified ptc fragments were cloned into the pCRII-topo vector (Invitrogen). Six individual colonies of each species were sequenced. Expression Constructs—Mouse Ptch1 and Ptch2 were cloned into pAcGFP-C3 (Clontech), generating fusion proteins with an N-terminal green fluorescent protein: Ptch1C2, Ptch1-(1-1162)/Ptch2-(1113-1171); Ptch2C1, Ptch2-(1-1112)/Ptch1-(1163-1377); Ptch1ΔC, Ptch1-(1-1162); and Ptch14A, PPPY (positions 1299-1302) to AAAA. Western Analysis—NIH 3T3 cells were cultured in high-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% (v/v) bovine calf serum. Cells (40,000 cells/cm2) were seeded in 6-well plates, incubated for 18 h (to 90-95% confluence), and transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 48 h, cycloheximide (100 μm; Sigma) was added. After the indicated periods, cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline; detached with 500 μl of 0.25% trypsin/EDTA; and after the addition of 500 μl of medium, collected by centrifugation at 7000 rpm for 5 min. Cells were rinsed with 500 μl of cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 100 μl of cold lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5) and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) by pipetting ∼30 times. After 30 min of agitation on a rocker at 4 °C, extracts were centrifuged at maximum speed for 30 min, and 20 μl of sample was mixed with 5 μl of 5× Laemmli sample buffer and incubated for 15 min at 4 °C. Twenty μl of each sample was loaded onto a 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (2% polyacrylamide stacking gel) that had been pre-run for 20 min at 70 V. Western blots were prepared on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes by semidry electrotransfer, blocked with 5% dry milk in TBST (0.08% Tween 20, 150 mm NaCl, and 20 mm Tris) for 30 min at room temperature, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit anti-green fluorescent protein antibody (1:1000 in 5% dry milk/TBST). After washing three times with 5% dry milk/TBST for 1 h, membranes were incubated for 1.5 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (diluted 1:1000 in 5% dry milk/TBST). Membranes were washed twice with 5% dry milk/TBST for 30 min and rinsed with TBST for 10 min. Detection was with the ECL Plus™ Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were quantified with NIH Image J. The intensity of each construct was compared with the tubulin loading control, and the ratio at 0 h was set at 100%. Conservation of Ptc Domains—Conservation of Ptc protein sequences during vertebrate and invertebrate evolution has been significant. To investigate how different regions of Ptc have either changed or been conserved, we assembled a group of invertebrate and vertebrate Ptc sequences for comparison. Thirteen sequences of vertebrate Ptc proteins were obtained from the NCBI Database (see Fig. 2). In addition, we prepared and partially sequenced Ptch cDNAs from C. familiaris, M. mulatta, and X. tropicalis; the total number of CTD sequences in our data set was 16. Thirteen sequences of invertebrate Ptc proteins were obtained from the NCBI and FlyBase Databases. We verified the Ptc CTD sequences for six of the Drosophila species (see Fig. 2). To estimate the general similarities of Ptc proteins, we first compared the sequences of D. melanogaster Ptc, which was the first Ptc protein identified, and human and mouse Ptch1 and Ptch2. Pairwise ClustalW comparisons of these proteins revealed the near identity of human and mouse Ptch1 proteins and of human and mouse Ptch2 proteins and the high degree of similarity (>50%) of these five proteins (Table 1). These alignments also revealed that the general topology of these proteins is similar, a result that is consistent with the similar distribution of predicted membrane-spanning domains in each protein (data not shown).TABLE 1Similarity analysis of Ptc proteinsH. sapiens 1H. sapiens 2M. musculus 1M. musculus 2H. sapiens 268M. musculus 19761M. musculus 2609460D. melanogaster51515151 Open table in a new tab We extended this analysis to the entire data set and also focused on four domains: the predicted extracellular loops 1 and 2, the SSD, and the CTD. Pairwise comparisons of the full-length proteins and of four domains were made for both the invertebrate and vertebrate sequence data sets. These analyses revealed sequence similarities of >50% for the full-length proteins and >65% in both extracellular loops and the SSD. Variation in the CTDs was significantly higher (Fig. 1). Vertebrate Ptch Proteins Have Either of Two CTD SubtypesFurther analysis of the vertebrate CTDs with ClustalW revealed two highly conserved subtypes that share >50% homology with each other (Table 2). The first group (Group I) includes dog, human, monkey, mouse, rat, and Xenopus laevis Ptch1 and X. tropicalis Ptc. Group II includes cow, dog, human, mouse, and rat Ptch2. The CTD sequences of X. laevis Ptch2 and zebrafish Ptch1 and Ptch2 have low homology to either group. Although we cannot evaluate why these sequences are so highly divergent (whether the differences are real or an artifact of isolation and cloning), as described below, the conservation they do have suggests that they should be included among the Group I orthologs.TABLE 2Pairwise comparisons of vertebrate Ptch sequencesC. familiaris 1D. rerio 1D. rerio 2Gallus gallus 1H. sapiens 1M. mulattaM. musculus 1Rattus norvegicus 1X. laevis 1X. laevis 2X. tropicalisBos taurus 2C. familiaris 2H. sapiens 2M. musculus 2D. rerio 111D. rerio 21731G. gallus 1751118H. sapiens 190111677M. mulatta9111167897M. musculus 1901117799495R. norvegicus 1901117799495100X. laevis 16310166863656565X. laevis 2361612373738383837X. tropicalis492353485050506729B. taurus 2131713131313131313138C. familiaris 21112911121212121011876H. sapiens 21319151313131414141388573M. musculus 2132217121213131311127665667R. norvegicus 213221712131313131212768587095 Open table in a new tab Two other features individuate these two groups (Table 3). First, Group I CTDs are significantly longer than Group II CTDs. With the exception of the two fish CTDs, all Group I CTDs exceed 205 residues. In contrast, none of the Group II CTDs is longer than 109 residues. Second, only the Group I CTDs include the PPXY sequence. In the D. melanogaster CTD, the PPXY residues have been implicated in the regulated turnover of the Ptc protein (8Lu X. Liu S. Kornberg T.B. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2539-2551Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and mutations in the PPXY sequence increase the protein half-life. CTD deletion mutants of both the D. melanogaster and mouse Ptc1 proteins also have reduced rates of degradation (Fig. 4) (8Lu X. Liu S. Kornberg T.B. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2539-2551Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).

We generated phylogenetic trees by the method of “neighbor joining” based on BLOSUM62 for all of the Ptc proteins in our data set as well as for each of the four domains. Similar results were obtained for all five trees: the invertebrate Group I and II sequences were placed on separate branches in each calculation. Sequence alignment performed by ClustalW, MUSCLE, and tCOFFEE identified two islands of significant conservation in the vertebrate Group I and II CTDs as well as the invertebrate CTDs. For purposes of illustration (Fig. 3), we used ClustalW to align vertebrate Group I and II CTDs and extracted a CTD “consensus” sequence for each type. We also generated an invertebrate CTD consensus sequence by aligning the D. melanogaster, Aedes aegypti, and Anopheles gambiae sequences. Fig. 3 presents an alignment of this “invertebrate CTD” consensus sequence with the consensus sequences of the vertebrate Group I and II CTDs. Two features of these alignments are noteworthy. First, the region of 30-40 residues at the immediate N terminus of the CTD is revealed as a domain of conservation in all three consensus sequences. We designated this region “Domain I.” Its conservation in the three sequences is >67% within the N-terminal 15 residues, and whereas the Group II homology does not extend further, the region of >50% conservation extends to 27 residues in the invertebrate Group I domains. Domain I of the zebrafish CTDs is the longer variety, consistent with a Group I designation. Second, “Domain II,” a more C-terminal region of conservation, extends for ∼21 residues and is also present in all three CTD types. Role of the CTD in Regulating Turnover of Ptc1 and Ptc2The CTD of the D. melanogaster Ptc protein regulates both turnover and internalization (8Lu X. Liu S. Kornberg T.B. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2539-2551Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The wild-type protein is unstable, with a half-life of <2 h. Its CTD contains a potential target sequence (PPAY) for the Nedd4 ubiquitin ligase, and mutant protein that lacks either the C-terminal half of the CTD or the PPAY sequence is significantly more stable (8Lu X. Liu S. Kornberg T.B. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2539-2551Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Because our comparative sequence analysis (above) revealed that Group I Ptc proteins have a potential neddylation sequence (PPPY) but Group II proteins do not, we investigated whether the PPPY sequence in vertebrate Ptc proteins has a role in regulating turnover. As shown in Fig. 4, Ptch1 was unstable (t½ = 1.7 h), whereas Ptch2 was stable (t½ > 18 h). Deleting the CTD of Ptch1 stabilized the protein (t½ > 17 h); swapping the CTDs of Ptch1 and Ptch2 stabilized Ptch1 (t½ = 5.8 h) and destabilized Ptch2 (t½ = 6.2 h). These properties indicate that the CTDs of Group I and II proteins help to determine lifetime. Mutating the PPPY sequence in the Ptch1 CTD to AAAA stabilized Ptch1 (t½ > 9 h). We conclude that the CTD of the vertebrate Ptc proteins plays a major role in regulating stability and that the PPPY sequence is an essential component of the mechanism that controls Ptc1 turnover. The Ptc protein family is characterized by shared topology and high sequence conservation. All members are predicted to have 12 membrane-spanning domains, an SSD, two large extracellular loops, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic tail. Several lines of evidence suggest that two subtypes of Ptc protein compose this family. This evidence includes predicted phylogenetic relationships among the family members as well as separate comparisons of sequence similarities within extracellular loops 1 and 2, the SSD, and the CTD. Most Ptc proteins, including the invertebrate orthologs, are of the Group I type. Although the known family members represent products from the small and selected set of genomes that were available to us, it bears noting that Group II orthologs have been identified only in mammals. It follows that the Group II subtype may be unique to mammals and may represent a divergence in that lineage. Whereas it is clear that Group I proteins function as tumor suppressors and as key negative regulators of Hedgehog signal transduction, the function of the Group II proteins has not been elucidated. Studies of mouse Ptch2 mutants suggest that this Group II protein modulates tumorigenesis associated with Ptch1 haploinsufficiency (33Lee Y. Miller H.L. Russell H.R. Boyd K. Curran T. McKinnon P.J. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 6964-6971Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), but how Ptch2 affects Ptch2 activity or downstream functions is not known. Although sequence variance in the CTD is significantly greater than in other domains, the islands of conservation in it may represent regions with conserved function. We designated these regions Domain I, Domain II, and PPXY, and available genetic evidence suggests that all three are functionally important. Mutations in the D. melanogaster PPXY sequence increase the protein half-life (8Lu X. Liu S. Kornberg T.B. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2539-2551Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), suggesting that this sequence motif functions to limit the lifetime of Ptc protein. In this work, we have shown that the PPPY sequence in mouse Ptch1 has a similar function. It is interesting to speculate that Group II proteins may not be regulated by the same mechanism and that the absence of the PPXY motif might indicate a different role for this protein. Domain I may also be critical to Ptch function. Among 12 CTD mutations that are listed in the PTCH Mutation Database of human mutations (25Lindstrom E. Shimokawa T. Toftgard R. Zaphiropoulos P.G. Hum. Mutat. 2006; 27: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), three (T1195I, P1196S, and S1197F) alter conserved residues in Domain I. These three mutations were identified in patients with basal cell carcinoma, suggesting that these mutant proteins may not respond to Hh or its absence in a normal way. Presumably, the pathway is abnormally active in these mutant backgrounds, and given the negative role of Ptc, these mutations might decrease Ptc activity either by reducing the half-life of the protein or by affecting its localization. Although Domain II mutations in human Ptc have not been reported, studies of the D. melanogaster CTD with mutations in Domain II have revealed that Domain II is essential for self-association of the CTD (8Lu X. Liu S. Kornberg T.B. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2539-2551Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It remains for future work to investigate whether the Domain II sequences in vertebrate Group I and II proteins contribute a similar function.

https://openalex.org/W2019300867,"I don't believe I have ever before read a microscopy textbook from cover to cover — but this one, reader, I did. Its two editors, Taekjip Ha and Paul Selvin, have set out to assemble a manual for cell biologists who want to extend their technical repertoires to include single-molecule techniques. They have succeeded admirably, and as a bonus the book provides a fascinating insight into where the technical limits lie, of how we stand — as the authors suggest in their introduction — at the beginning of a new era of single-molecule-based cell biology.

If molecular cell biology had an agenda, then near the top of the list would be the need to understand how the biology of cells arises out of the properties and behaviours of individual molecules. Single molecules still hold considerable mystery. For the most part, the world of our everyday experience comprises multimolecule phenomena, and the familiar language of cell biology is adapted to describe these phenomena. As we zoom in to the single-molecule level, unfamiliar things start to happen. Events become stochastic. Structures become probabilistic distributions of different structures. Everything jiggles about, so that even the idea of a given object being in a particular fixed position needs careful consideration and qualification."
