https://openalex.org/W1601681275,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs) are highly metastatic with poor prognosis, mainly due to delayed detection. We hypothesized that intercellular communication is critical for metastatic progression. Here, we show that PDAC-derived exosomes induce liver pre-metastatic niche formation in naive mice and consequently increase liver metastatic burden. Uptake of PDAC-derived exosomes by Kupffer cells caused transforming growth factor β secretion and upregulation of fibronectin production by hepatic stellate cells. This fibrotic microenvironment enhanced recruitment of bone marrow-derived macrophages. We found that macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) was highly expressed in PDAC-derived exosomes, and its blockade prevented liver pre-metastatic niche formation and metastasis. Compared with patients whose pancreatic tumours did not progress, MIF was markedly higher in exosomes from stage I PDAC patients who later developed liver metastasis. These findings suggest that exosomal MIF primes the liver for metastasis and may be a prognostic marker for the development of PDAC liver metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W3103761932,"A high percentage of smooth muscle cells in atherosclerotic lesions lose expression of smooth muscle marker proteins and acquire the phenotype of other cell types, a process of functional importance in lesion pathogenesis that is controlled by the transcription factor KLF4. Previous studies investigating the role of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and macrophages in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis have provided controversial results owing to the use of unreliable methods for clearly identifying each of these cell types. Here, using Myh11-CreERT2 ROSA floxed STOP eYFP Apoe−/− mice to perform SMC lineage tracing, we find that traditional methods for detecting SMCs based on immunostaining for SMC markers fail to detect >80% of SMC-derived cells within advanced atherosclerotic lesions. These unidentified SMC-derived cells exhibit phenotypes of other cell lineages, including macrophages and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). SMC-specific conditional knockout of Krüppel-like factor 4 (Klf4) resulted in reduced numbers of SMC-derived MSC- and macrophage-like cells, a marked reduction in lesion size, and increases in multiple indices of plaque stability, including an increase in fibrous cap thickness as compared to wild-type controls. On the basis of in vivo KLF4 chromatin immunoprecipitation–sequencing (ChIP-seq) analyses and studies of cholesterol-treated cultured SMCs, we identified >800 KLF4 target genes, including many that regulate pro-inflammatory responses of SMCs. Our findings indicate that the contribution of SMCs to atherosclerotic plaques has been greatly underestimated, and that KLF4-dependent transitions in SMC phenotype are critical in lesion pathogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W1568237782,"The lymphatic vasculature is a blind-ended network crucial for tissue-fluid homeostasis, immune surveillance and lipid absorption from the gut. Recent evidence has proposed an entirely venous-derived mammalian lymphatic system. By contrast, here we show that cardiac lymphatic vessels in mice have a heterogeneous cellular origin, whereby formation of at least part of the cardiac lymphatic network is independent of sprouting from veins. Multiple Cre–lox-based lineage tracing revealed a potential contribution from the putative haemogenic endothelium during development, and discrete lymphatic endothelial progenitor populations were confirmed by conditional knockout of Prox1 in Tie2+ and Vav1+ compartments. In the adult heart, myocardial infarction promoted a significant lymphangiogenic response, which was augmented by treatment with VEGF-C, resulting in improved cardiac function. These data prompt the re-evaluation of a century-long debate on the origin of lymphatic vessels and suggest that lymphangiogenesis may represent a therapeutic target to promote cardiac repair following injury."
https://openalex.org/W1579591484,"The gut microbiota is emerging as a new factor in the development of obesity. Many studies have described changes in microbiota composition in response to obesity and high fat diet (HFD) at the phylum level. In this study we used 16s RNA high throughput sequencing on faecal samples from rats chronically fed HFD or control chow (n = 10 per group, 16 weeks) to investigate changes in gut microbiota composition at the species level. 53.17% dissimilarity between groups was observed at the species level. Lactobacillus intestinalis dominated the microbiota in rats under the chow diet. However this species was considerably less abundant in rats fed HFD (P<0.0001), this being compensated by an increase in abundance of propionate/acetate producing species. To further understand the influence of these species on the development of the obese phenotype, we correlated their abundance with metabolic parameters associated with obesity. Of the taxa contributing the most to dissimilarity between groups, 10 presented significant correlations with at least one of the tested parameters, three of them correlated positively with all metabolic parameters: Phascolarctobacterium, Proteus mirabilis and Veillonellaceae, all propionate/acetate producers. Lactobacillus intestinalis was the only species whose abundance was negatively correlated with change in body weight and fat mass. This species decreased drastically in response to HFD, favouring propionate/acetate producing bacterial species whose abundance was strongly correlated with adiposity and deterioration of metabolic factors. Our observations suggest that these species may play a key role in the development of obesity in response to a HFD."
https://openalex.org/W1506023632,"Mathematical modelling and simulations reveal that including antibiotic degraders in ecological models of microbial species interaction allows the system to robustly move towards an intermixed stable state, more representative of real-world observations. Understanding how stability in multispecies communities is maintained in the face of negative interactions via antibiotic production is a key goal in microbial ecology. Most ecological models for antibiotic interactions assume pairwise relationships between species that result in rock–scissor–paper type cycling and spatial separation. This doesn't reflect the in situ observations though, where communities are far more intermixed. Instead, Eric Kelsic and colleagues propose a three-species interaction assay, in which one species is capable of antibiotic degradation. Using a mixture of modelling and experimental validation, the authors show that including antibiotic degraders allows the system to robustly move towards an intermixed stable state. A major challenge in theoretical ecology is understanding how natural microbial communities support species diversity1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, and in particular how antibiotic-producing, -sensitive and -resistant species coexist9,10,11,12,13,14,15. While cyclic ‘rock–paper–scissors’ interactions can stabilize communities in spatial environments9,10,11, coexistence in unstructured environments remains unexplained12,16. Here, using simulations and analytical models, we show that the opposing actions of antibiotic production and degradation enable coexistence even in well-mixed environments. Coexistence depends on three-way interactions in which an antibiotic-degrading species attenuates the inhibitory interactions between two other species. These interactions enable coexistence that is robust to substantial differences in inherent species growth rates and to invasion by ‘cheating’ species that cease to produce or degrade antibiotics. At least two antibiotics are required for stability, with greater numbers of antibiotics enabling more complex communities and diverse dynamic behaviours ranging from stable fixed points to limit cycles and chaos. Together, these results show how multi-species antibiotic interactions can generate ecological stability in both spatially structured and mixed microbial communities, suggesting strategies for engineering synthetic ecosystems and highlighting the importance of toxin production and degradation for microbial biodiversity."
https://openalex.org/W1562614302,"Pancreatic beta cell death is a hallmark of type 1 (T1D) and type 2 (T2D) diabetes, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this aspect of diabetic pathology are poorly understood. Here we report that expression of the microRNA (miR)-200 family is strongly induced in islets of diabetic mice and that beta cell-specific overexpression of miR-200 in mice is sufficient to induce beta cell apoptosis and lethal T2D. Conversely, mir-200 ablation in mice reduces beta cell apoptosis and ameliorates T2D. We show that miR-200 negatively regulates a conserved anti-apoptotic and stress-resistance network that includes the essential beta cell chaperone Dnajc3 (also known as p58IPK) and the caspase inhibitor Xiap. We also observed that mir-200 dosage positively controls activation of the tumor suppressor Trp53 and thereby creates a pro-apoptotic gene-expression signature found in islets of diabetic mice. Consequently, miR-200-induced T2D is suppressed by interfering with the signaling of Trp53 and Bax, a proapoptotic member of the B cell lymphoma 2 protein family. Our results reveal a crucial role for the miR-200 family in beta cell survival and the pathophysiology of diabetes."

https://openalex.org/W2412626606,"A rise in tissue-embedded macrophages displaying proinflammatory polarization is a hallmark of metabolic inflammation during a high fat diet or obesity. Here we show that bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) from high fat-fed mice retain a memory of their dietary environment in vivo (displaying the elevated proinflammatory genes Cxcl1, Il6, Tnf, Nos2) despite 7-day differentiation and proliferation ex vivo. Notably, 6-h incubation with palmitoleate (PO) reversed the proinflammatory gene expression and cytokine secretion seen in BMDM from high fat-fed mice. BMDM from low fat-fed mice exposed to palmitate (PA) for 18 h ex vivo also showed elevated expression of proinflammatory genes (Cxcl1, Il6, Tnf, Nos2, and Il12b) associated with M1 polarization. Conversely, PO treatment increased anti-inflammatory genes (Mrc1, Tgfb1, Il10, Mgl2) and oxidative metabolism, characteristic of M2 macrophages. Therefore, saturated and unsaturated fatty acids bring about opposite macrophage polarization states. Coincubation of BMDM with both fatty acids counteracted the PA-induced Nos2 expression in a PO dose-dependent fashion. PO also prevented PA-induced IκBα degradation, RelA nuclear translocation, NO production, and cytokine secretion. Mechanistically, PO exerted its anti-inflammatory function through AMP-activated protein kinase as AMP kinase knockout or inhibition by Compound C offset the PO-dependent prevention of PA-induced inflammation. These results demonstrate a nutritional memory of BMDM ex vivo, highlight the plasticity of BMDM polarization in response to saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, and identify the potential to reverse diet- and saturated fat-induced M1-like polarization by administering palmitoleate. These findings could have applicability to reverse obesity-linked inflammation in metabolically relevant tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2139252194,"In the social sciences, there is a longstanding tension between data collection methods that facilitate quantification and those that are open to unanticipated information. Advances in technology now enable new, hybrid methods that combine some of the benefits of both approaches. Drawing inspiration from online information aggregation systems like Wikipedia and from traditional survey research, we propose a new class of research instruments called wiki surveys. Just as Wikipedia evolves over time based on contributions from participants, we envision an evolving survey driven by contributions from respondents. We develop three general principles that underlie wiki surveys: they should be greedy, collaborative, and adaptive. Building on these principles, we develop methods for data collection and data analysis for one type of wiki survey, a pairwise wiki survey. Using two proof-of-concept case studies involving our free and open-source website www.allourideas.org, we show that pairwise wiki surveys can yield insights that would be difficult to obtain with other methods."

https://openalex.org/W1898460539,"Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive lipid that can function both extracellularly and intracellularly to mediate a variety of cellular processes. Using lipid affinity matrices and a radiolabeled lipid binding assay, we reveal that S1P directly interacts with the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ. Herein, we show that S1P treatment of human endothelial cells (ECs) activated a luciferase-tagged PPARγ-specific gene reporter by ∼12-fold, independent of the S1P receptors. More specifically, in silico docking, gene reporter, and binding assays revealed that His323 of the PPARγ ligand binding domain is important for binding to S1P. PPARγ functions when associated with coregulatory proteins, and herein we identify that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1 (PGC1)β binds to PPARγ in ECs and their progenitors (nonadherent endothelial forming cells) and that the formation of this PPARγ:PGC1β complex is increased in response to S1P. ECs treated with S1P selectively regulated known PPARγ target genes with PGC1β and plasminogen-activated inhibitor-1 being increased, no change to adipocyte fatty acid binding protein 2 and suppression of CD36. S1P-induced in vitro tube formation was significantly attenuated in the presence of the PPARγ antagonist GW9662, and in vivo application of GW9662 also reduced vascular development in Matrigel plugs. Interestingly, activation of PPARγ by the synthetic ligand troglitazone also reduced tube formation in vitro and in vivo. To support this, Sphk1(-/-)Sphk2(+/-) mice, with low circulating S1P levels, demonstrated a similar reduction in vascular development. Taken together, our data reveal that the transcription factor, PPARγ, is a bona fide intracellular target for S1P and thus suggest that the S1P:PPARγ:PGC1β complex may be a useful target to manipulate neovascularization."
https://openalex.org/W1532585510,"Beta diversity describes changes in species composition among sites in a region and has particular relevance for explaining ecological patterns in fragmented habitats. However, it is difficult to reveal the mechanisms if broad sense beta-diversity indices (i.e. yielding identical values under nestedness and species replacement) are used. Partitioning beta diversity into turnover (caused by species replacement from site to site) and nestedness-resultant components (caused by nested species losses) could provide a unique way to understand the variation of species composition in fragmented habitats. Here, we collected occupancy data of breeding birds and lizards on land-bridge islands in an inundated lake in eastern China. We decomposed beta diversity of breeding bird and lizard communities into spatial turnover and nestedness-resultant components to assess their relative contributions and respective relationships to differences in island area, isolation, and habitat richness. Our results showed that spatial turnover contributed more to beta diversity than the nestedness-resultant component. The degree of isolation had no significant effect on overall beta diversity or its components, neither for breeding birds nor for lizards. In turn, in both groups the nestedness-resultant component increased with larger differences in island area and habitat richness, respectively, while turnover component decreased with them. The major difference among birds and lizards was a higher relevance of nestedness-resultant dissimilarity in lizards, suggesting that they are more prone to local extinctions derived from habitat fragmentation. The dominance of the spatial turnover component of beta diversity suggests that all islands have potential conservation value for breeding bird and lizard communities."
https://openalex.org/W1749196466,"Regulation of the extent of immune responses is a requirement to maintain self-tolerance and limit inflammatory processes. CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells play a role in regulation. The Foxp3 transcription factor is considered a dominant regulator for Treg cell development and function. Foxp3 function itself is directly regulated by multiple posttranslational modifications that occur in response to various external stimuli. The Foxp3 protein is a component of several dynamic macromolecular regulatory complexes. The complexes change constituents over time and through different signals to regulate the development and function of regulatory T cells. Here we identified a mechanism regulating Foxp3 level and activity that operates through discrete phosphorylation. The Pim-2 kinase can phosphorylate Foxp3, leading to decreased suppressive functions of Treg cells. The amino-terminal domain of Foxp3 is modified at several sites by Pim-2 kinase. This modification leads to altered expression of proteins related to Treg cell functions and increased Treg cell lineage stability. Treg cell suppressive function can be up-regulated by either pharmacologically inhibiting Pim-2 kinase activity or by genetically knocking out Pim-2 in rodent Treg cells. Deficiency of Pim-2 activity increases murine host resistance to dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis in vivo, and a Pim-2 small molecule kinase inhibitor also modified Treg cell functions.

Treg cells can be categorized into two major types: natural Treg cells, which are generated in the thymus, and induced Treg cells, which appear to be converted from conventional T cells by the action of cytokines such as TGF-β in the periphery. The development and function of both types of Treg cells can be regulated by FOXP3, a member of the forkhead family of transcriptional regulators.

The function of FOXP3 is regulated at various levels. FOXP3 has a unique proline rich amino-terminal domain that is required for its repressive transcriptional activity. Structural alterations of this domain are important. GFP insertion at the Foxp3 N-terminal domain alters Foxp3 functions and renders rodents more susceptible to autoimmune diabetes but, inexplicably, more resistant to antibody-mediated arthritis (9Bettini M.L.

The Foxp3 N-terminal domain also contributes to Foxp3 nuclear transport (11Hancock W.W. Ozkaynak E. Three distinct domains contribute to nuclear transport of murine Foxp3.PLoS ONE. 2009; 4e7890Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). FOXP3 interacts with other partners, including Tip60, HDAC1, HDAC7, and HDAC9, enzymes involved in acetylation. Many of these interactions occur at the N-terminal domain (12Zhang H. Xiao Y. Zhu Z.

U.S.A. 2007; 104: 4571-4576Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). FOXP3 transcriptional activity is also regulated by posttranslational modifications (15van Loosdregt J. Coffer P.J. Post-translational modification networks regulating FOXP3 function.Trends Immunol. 2014; 35: 368-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) such as ubiquitination.

It has been suggested that phosphatase PP1 activated by TNFα can dephosphorylate FOXP3 at Ser-418, which may then influence Treg cell suppressive function (17Nie H. Zheng Y. Li R. Guo T.B. He D. Fang L. Liu X. Xiao L. Chen X. Wan B. Chin Y.E. Zhang J.Z. Phosphorylation of FOXP3 controls regulatory T cell function and is inhibited by TNF-α in rheumatoid arthritis.Nat. Med. 2013; 19: 322-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), although the kinase itself responsible for FOXP3 phosphorylation was not characterized. Recently, cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) has been reported to phosphorylate Ser-19 and Thr-175 of Foxp3 and regulate Foxp3 stability (18Morawski P.A. Mehra P. Chen C. Bhatti T. Wells A.D.

Pim kinases are serine/threonine kinases that play an essential role in T cell development and differentiation. Three members have been identified so far: Pim-1, Pim-2, and Pim-3. Among them, Pim-1 and Pim-2 have been identified as oncogenes in murine T cell lymphomas induced by leukemia proviral integration (19Breuer M.L. Cuypers H.T. Berns A.

Berns A. Proviral activation of the putative oncogene Pim-1 in MuLV induced T-cell lymphomas.EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1793-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Pim kinases function in several aspects of lymphocyte function, such as survival, cell cycle progression, and transcription gene expression (21Isaac M. Siu A. Jongstra J. The oncogenic PIM kinase family regulates drug resistance through multiple mechanisms.Drug Resist. Updates. 2011; 14: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-7 can induce Pim-1 and Pim-2 expression in T cells and promote T cell growth and survival in a rapamycin-insensitive manner (22Fox C.J. Hammerman P.S. Thompson C.B. The Pim kinases control rapamycin-resistant T cell survival and activation.J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In addition, Pim-2 induced by FOXP3 in Treg cells is permissive for Treg cell expansion in the presence of rapamycin (23Basu S. Golovina T. Mikheeva T. June C.H. Riley J.L. Cutting edge: Foxp3-mediated induction of pim 2 allows human T regulatory cells to preferentially expand in rapamycin.J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 5794-5798Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Animals deficient in all Pim kinases (pim1−/−pim2−/−pim3−/−) display no significant differences in comparison with wild-type mice except for reduced body size (24Mikkers H. Nawijn M. Allen J. Brouwers C. Verhoeven E. Jonkers J. Berns A. Mice deficient for all PIM kinases display reduced body size and impaired responses to hematopoietic growth factors.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6104-6115Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In a previous study, PIM1 has been found able to phosphorylate Ser-422 in the carboxyl terminus of human FOXP3 (25Li Z. Lin F. Zhuo C. Deng G. Chen Z. Yin S. Gao Z. Piccioni M. Tsun A. Cai S. Zheng S.G. Zhang Y. Li B.

Chem. 2014; 289: 26872-26881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, Ser-422 is not evolutionally conserved and is not present in the mouse Foxp3 protein sequence, precluding preclinical studies in rodents. In this study, we found that Foxp3 serves as a substrate of Pim-2. Mass spectrometry data indicated that Pim-2 can phosphorylate multiple sites of the Foxp3 N-terminal domain and that it negatively regulates Treg cell suppressive function. Inhibition of Pim-2 activity increases the suppressive function of Treg cells in vitro. Deficiency of Pim-2 in vivo increased Treg lineage stability. Pim-2 knockout mice have increased resistance to DSS-induced colitis. These observations may contribute to new strategies to modulate Treg functions for human autoimmune diseases. Wild-type FVB mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. pim2−/− FVB mice were provided by Dr. Anton Berns (Netherland Cancer Institute) and Dr. Paul Rothman (Johns Hopkins Medicine). Mice, including wild-type and pim2−/− knockout mice, were bred and maintained at the University of Pennsylvania Research Animal Facility. The animal protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Pennsylvania. The HA-Foxp3-expressing plasmid was constructed as described previously (14Li B.

Membranes were subsequently blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS buffer for 1 h at room temperature or otherwise blocked with 5% BSA in TBST buffer (Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween-20) for phosphorylation detection and incubated with antibody at optimized dilution overnight in a cold room. Membranes were then washed and treated with chemiluminescent HRP substrate (Millipore) and exposed to Hyblot CL autoradiography film (Denville Scientific Inc.). RNA isolation and cDNA preparation were performed according to the protocols of the manufacturer (Qiagen and Invitrogen, respectively). Primer sets used for PCR detection were as follows: β-actin, 5′-GGACTTCGAGCAAGAGATGG-3′ and 5′-AGCACTGTGTTGGCGTACAG-3′; FOXP3, 5′-TCCCAGAGTTCCTCCACAAC-3′ and 5′-ATTGAGTGTCCGCTGCTTCT-3′; Pim-1, 5′-GCTTCGGCTCGGTCTACTC-3′ and 5′-GCCTCTCGAACCAGTCCAG-3′; Pim-2, 5′-CGCACTGCTATGGAAAGTGG-3′ and 5′-GGAATGGCAGTGCTGGATGG-3′; and Pim-3, 5′-AAGCTCATCGACTTCGGTTC-3′ and 5′-AGGATCTCCTCGTCCTGC TC-3′. The GST-Pim-2 kinase WT and GST-Pim-2 KD fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and affinity-purified with glutathione-Sepharose chromatography resins (GE Healthcare) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The kinase proteins were dialyzed against Tris buffer prior to use. Mouse HA-tagged Foxp3 was transfected into the 293T cell line and purified through immunoprecipitation with anti-HA-agarose beads. For the kinase assay analyzed by 32P incorporation, each bead-bound HA-Foxp3 substrate protein (1 μg) was incubated with 0.2 μg of GST-Pim-2 (WT or KD) in 50 μl of kinase buffer (25 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 0.2 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm DTT, and 20 μm ATP) containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reactions were carried out at 30 °C for 30 min. Equal volumes of 2× Laemmli buffer were added and boiled for 5 min to terminate the reactions. Samples were loaded onto SDS-PAGE gels that were dried prior to exposure to Hyblot CL autoradiography film. HEK 293T cells were cotransfected with Foxp3 and Pim-2-expressing plasmids. Foxp3 protein was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and separated on 8% SDS-PAGE. For phosphorylation site mapping, the Foxp3 band was excised from the gel, digested with Trypsin enzyme, and then submitted to mass spectrum analysis. Identification of phosphopeptides was performed by nano liquid chromatography (nanoLC)/nanospray/linear ion trap mass spectrometry. Sites of phosphorylation within the peptides were determined by a combination of mass spectrometry and solid-phase Edman sequencing. Spleens were removed from healthy wild-type and pim2−/− knockout mice after euthanasia with CO2. CD4+ T cells were enriched from splenocytes using MACS separation (Miltenyi), and CD4+CD25−CD45RBhigh Teff cells and CD4+CD25+ CD45RBlow Treg cells were separated from CD4+ cells by FACS Aria II, yielding a purity of ∼97% for both cell types. To determine suppression of Teff cell proliferation by measuring carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE, Invitrogen) dilution, freshly isolated Teff cells were labeled with 10 μm CFSE for 10 min at 37 °C. The labeled Teff cells were cocultured with different ratios of Treg cells in a 96-well plate under stimulation of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 beads at a 1:0.5 Teff:bead ratio in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1× non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen), 2 mm sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen), and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma). For the analysis of the effect of the Pim-2 inhibitor, splenocytes from wild-type female C57BL/6 mice were subjected to a suppression assay as described above, and Pim-2 inhibitor was added as indicated. After 3 days of coculture, cells were harvested, and their proliferations were analyzed by FACS Canto flow cytometry (BD Biosciences). Acute colitis was induced in FVB wild-type mice and pim2−/− mice by administration of 5% DSS (molecular weight 5000 Da; Affimetrix Inc., Cleveland, OH) in the drinking water ad libitum for 6 days. The development of colitis was assessed daily by measurement of body weight until day 12. The means of each data set were analyzed using Student's t test, with a one-tailed distribution assuming equal sample variance for the colitis models and a two-tailed distribution for the others. The Pim kinases are highly expressed and active in certain tumor cells (21Isaac M. Siu A. Jongstra J.

We analyzed Pim kinase expression patterns in human Treg cells by real-time quantitative RT-PCR and noted that Pim-2 was the most highly expressed form within the Pim kinase family in Treg cells (Fig. 1A). Negligible expression of Pim-1 and of Pim-3 was noted. This result extends a previous study suggesting that Pim-2 is expressed in Treg cells (23Basu S. Golovina T. Mikheeva T. June C.H. Riley J.L. Cutting edge: Foxp3-mediated induction of pim 2 allows human T regulatory cells to preferentially expand in rapamycin.J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 5794-5798Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Because both Pim-2 and Foxp3 are highly expressed in mammalian Treg cells, we investigated whether Pim-2 interacts with Foxp3. To test this hypothesis, we first employed coimmunoprecipitations between Pim-2 and Foxp3 present in murine splenocytes. Endogenous Foxp3 was immunoprecipitated by antibody against Pim-2 but not control IgG (Fig. 1B). The interaction of Pim-2 and Foxp3 was then studied using tagged human proteins in transfected human cells. 293T cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged Pim-2 and HA-tagged Foxp3. 24 h after transfection, cell lysates were subjected to coimmunoprecipitation analysis. Immunoprecipitation with HA-conjugated agarose led to the coprecipitation of FLAG-Pim-2, as revealed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1C, top panel). Reciprocally, HA-Foxp3 was coimmunoprecipitated by FLAG-agarose that targeted FLAG-Pim-2 (Fig. 1C, bottom panel). In addition, Foxp3 was also pulled down by WT and KD Pim-2 kinases in GST pulldown assays (Fig. 1D). These studies revealed that Pim-2 kinase interacts with Foxp3 in a manner independent of its intrinsic kinase domain activity. Foxp3 contains three major domains: the N-terminal domain, the zinc finger and leucine zipper domain, and the highly conserved forkhead domain located at the C terminus. To map the specific domain in Foxp3 that regulates its association with Pim-2, 293T cells were cotransfected with plasmids expressing various fragments of Foxp3 and Pim-2 and subjected to coimmunoprecipitation analysis. As seen in Fig. 1E, Foxp3 lacking the C-terminal forkhead domain (ΔC) as well as full-length of Foxp3 interacted with Pim-2. However, truncation of the N terminus of Foxp3 (ΔN) abolished its interaction with Pim-2. Both the N-terminal domain and the zinc finger and leucine zipper domain were required for Foxp3 to associate with Pim-2 (Fig. 1F). Taken together, these results indicate that Foxp3 interacts with Pim-2 in vitro and in vivo and that the N-terminal domain of Foxp3 is required for its interaction with Pim-2 in human cells. On the basis of the interaction that occurs between Pim-2 kinase and Foxp3, we next determined whether Foxp3 acts as a substrate of Pim-2. To address this question, we performed in vitro kinase assays using 32P incorporation. First, the recombinant GST-Pim-2 WT and GST-Pim-2 KD mutant species were expressed in E. coli and then purified with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Fig. 2A). HA-Foxp3 was also purified from transfected 293T cells and used as the substrate. As shown in Fig. 2B, the purified recombinant GST-Pim-2 WT kinase could be autophosphorylated and readily phosphorylated Foxp3. These studies support a direct physical interaction of the kinase and FOXP3. To investigate the phosphorylation of Foxp3 by Pim-2 in vivo, 293T cells were cotransfected with HA-Foxp3- and FLAG-Pim-2-expressing plasmids. Foxp3 was immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates and subjected to Western blot analysis. As revealed in Fig. 2C, wild-type Pim-2 but not the Pim-2 KD mutant could phosphorylate Foxp3. When we treated the HA-agarose bound HA-Foxp3 with λ-phosphatase, phosphorylation of Foxp3 by Pim-2 decreased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2D). Therefore, Pim-2 can phosphorylate Foxp3 both in vitro and in vivo, and phosphorylation can be reversed by λ-phosphatase treatment. NanoLC/nanospray/mass spectrometry permits the rapid identification of phosphopeptides and subsequent localization of the phosphorylation sites. We sought to determine the phosphorylation sites of Foxp3 by Pim-2 with MS/MS analysis. After cotransfection of 293T cells with Pim-2 and Foxp3, Foxp3 was isolated by immunoprecipitation and subjected to MS/MS analysis. Three phosphorylated peptides were identified. Ser-33 and Ser-41 were identified to be phosphorylation sites by Pim-2 in the first two phosphorylated peptides (Fig. 3, A and B). The actual phosphorylation site identified in the third phosphorylated peptide was not identified precisely because MS/MS analysis suggested that this represented a mixture of phosphorylation on either serine or threonine residues (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that Foxp3 acts as a substrate of the Pim-2 kinase and is phosphorylated at multiple sites in the Foxp3 N-terminal domain. We identified a role of Pim-2 kinase in the regulation of Treg cell function. We used the Pim-2 inhibitor (Z)-5-(4-propoxybenzylidene) thiazolidine-2,4-dione, which dominantly (but not exclusively) suppresses Pim-2 activity (Calbiochem, IC50 = 150 nm and 20 nm against Pim-1 and Pim-2, respectively). Primary CD4+CD25−CD45RBhigh Teff cells and CD4+CD25+CD45RBlow Treg cells were sorted from wild-type FVB mouse spleens. Teff cells were stained with CFSE as described under “Experimental Procedures” and then cocultured with different ratios of Treg cells in the presence of different concentrations of Pim-2 inhibitor for 3 days. Subsequently, the proliferation of Teff cells was analyzed in a CFSE-based suppression assay. As shown (Fig. 4A), the proliferation of Teff was decreased with the increasing ratio of Treg/Teff cells. It should be noted that the Pim-2 inhibitor did not influence the proliferation of Teff cells. However, when Teff cells were cocultured with Treg cells, the suppressive function of Treg cells was found to have increased significantly with the treatment with Pim-2 inhibitor compared with dimethyl sulfoxide, indicating that the Pim-2 inhibitor influenced only Treg cell rather than Teff cell function in vitro. The effects are significant because when the Teff:Treg cell ratio was 1:0.5, Treg cell suppressive function was increased ∼5-fold in the presence of 12.5 μm inhibitor. Because the small molecule Pim-2 inhibitor promotes the suppressive function of Treg cells but has no discernable effect on T effector cells, we speculated that the suppressive function of Treg might be up-regulated by the elimination of endogenous Pim-2 kinase. To verify this hypothesis, we analyzed suppressive functions using Treg cells from Pim-2 knockout mice. Primary CD4+CD25−CD45RBhigh Teff cells and CD4+CD25+CD45RBlow Treg cells were sorted from wild-type and Pim-2 knockout mouse spleens and used in the same CFSE assay. Wild-type Teff cells were cocultured with wild-type or Pim-2 knockout Treg cells at ratios of 1:0.5 or 1:1, and the proliferation of Teff cells was measured after 3 days of culture. As expected, compared with wild-type Treg cells, Treg cells from Pim-2 knockout mice were able to suppress the proliferation of Teff cells more efficiently (Fig. 4, B and C). Taken together, these studies indicate that phosphorylation of the Foxp3 N-terminal domain by Pim-2 kinase negatively regulates Treg function. The transcriptional factor Foxp3 is the master regulator for the Treg cell lineage. Dysfunction of Foxp3 could cause fatal autoimmune diseases in humans and mice. Foxp3 level and activity contribute to Treg cell suppressive function. CD25 is the α chain of the IL-2 receptor. Treg cells highly express CD25, which competes with Teff cells for IL-2 consumption and contributes to Teff cell proliferation suppression (29Suzuki H. Kündig T.M. Furlonger C. Wakeham A. Timms E.

A marked alteration in mesotrione [a 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) inhibitor] efficacy on Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri S. Watson) was observed when grown under low- (LT, 25/15 °C, day/night temperatures) and high (HT, 40/30° C) temperature compared to optimum (OT, 32.5/22.5 °C) temperature. Based on plant height, injury, and mortality, Palmer amaranth was more sensitive to mesotrione at LT and less sensitive at HT compared to OT (ED50 for mortality; 18.5, 52.3, and 63.7 g ai ha-1, respectively). Similar responses were observed for leaf chlorophyll index and photochemical efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm). Furthermore, mesotrione translocation and metabolism, and HPPD expression data strongly supported such variation. Relatively more mesotrione was translocated to meristematic regions at LT or OT than at HT. Based on T50 values (time required to metabolize 50% of the 14C mesotrione), plants at HT metabolized mesotrione faster than those at LT or OT (T50; 13, 21, and 16.5 h, respectively). The relative HPPD:CPS (carbamoyl phosphate synthetase) or HPPD:β-tubulin expression in mesotrione-treated plants increased over time in all temperature regimes; however, at 48 HAT, the HPPD:β-tubulin expression was exceedingly higher at HT compared to LT or OT (18.4-, 3.1-, and 3.5-fold relative to untreated plants, respectively). These findings together with an integrated understanding of other interacting key environmental factors will have important implications for a predictable approach for effective weed management."

Most studies on redox regulation of immunity have focused on intracellular proteins. In this study we have used redox proteomics to identify those proteins released in glutathionylated form by macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) after pre-loading the cells with biotinylated GSH. Of the several proteins identified in the redox secretome, we have selected a number for validation. Proteomic analysis indicated that LPS stimulated the release of peroxiredoxin (PRDX) 1, PRDX2, vimentin (VIM), profilin1 (PFN1) and thioredoxin 1 (TXN1). For PRDX1 and TXN1, we were able to confirm that the released protein is glutathionylated. PRDX1, PRDX2 and TXN1 were also released by the human pulmonary epithelial cell line, A549, infected with influenza virus. The release of the proteins identified was inhibited by the anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid, dexamethasone (DEX), which also inhibited tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α release, and by thiol antioxidants (N-butanoyl GSH derivative, GSH-C4, and N-acetylcysteine (NAC), which did not affect TNF-α production. The proteins identified could be useful as biomarkers of oxidative stress associated with inflammation, and further studies will be required to investigate if the extracellular forms of these proteins has immunoregulatory functions."
https://openalex.org/W1516652979,"Background Bipolar disorder is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Although existing treatments are effective, there is often a substantial delay before diagnosis and treatment initiation. We sought to investigate factors associated with the delay before diagnosis of bipolar disorder and the onset of treatment in secondary mental healthcare. Method Retrospective cohort study using anonymised electronic mental health record data from the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (SLaM) Biomedical Research Centre (BRC) Case Register on 1364 adults diagnosed with bipolar disorder between 2007 and 2012. The following predictor variables were analysed in a multivariable Cox regression analysis: age, gender, ethnicity, compulsory admission to hospital under the UK Mental Health Act, marital status and other diagnoses prior to bipolar disorder. The outcomes were time to recorded diagnosis from first presentation to specialist mental health services (the diagnostic delay), and time to the start of appropriate therapy (treatment delay). Results The median diagnostic delay was 62 days (interquartile range: 17–243) and median treatment delay was 31 days (4–122). Compulsory hospital admission was associated with a significant reduction in both diagnostic delay (hazard ratio 2.58, 95% CI 2.18–3.06) and treatment delay (4.40, 3.63–5.62). Prior diagnoses of other psychiatric disorders were associated with increased diagnostic delay, particularly alcohol (0.48, 0.33–0.41) and substance misuse disorders (0.44, 0.31–0.61). Prior diagnosis of schizophrenia and psychotic depression were associated with reduced treatment delay. Conclusions Some individuals experience a significant delay in diagnosis and treatment of bipolar disorder after initiation of specialist mental healthcare, particularly those who have prior diagnoses of alcohol and substance misuse disorders. These findings highlight a need for further study on strategies to better identify underlying symptoms and offer appropriate treatment sooner in order to facilitate improved clinical outcomes, such as developing specialist early intervention services to identify and treat people with bipolar disorder."

Specific genetic polymorphisms in FREP1 are significantly associated with P. falciparum infection intensity levels in wild Anopheles gambiae populations from Kenya. The FREP1 is a member of the fibrinogen-related protein family (FREPs or FBNs) that contains a highly conserved C-terminal interacting fibrinogen-like (FBN) domain. In vertebrates, fibrinogen molecules usually associate as hexamers and are comprised of two sets of disulfide-bridged α, β, and γ chains that participate as a principal component of both cellular and fluid coagulation (14Mosesson M.W.

In contrast to FBN9 and FBN30 that inhibit Plasmodium infection, our results show that FREP1 is an important host factor that promotes infection of mosquito midguts by the major human pathogen, P. falciparum. Collectively, our data reveal new insight into Plasmodium-Anopheles interactions and identify FREP1 as a promising transmission-blocking target. An. gambiae G3 strain was maintained at 27 °C, 80% humidity with a 12-h day/night cycle. Larvae were reared on ground KOI fish food supplements (∼0.1 mg/larvae per day). Adult mosquitoes were maintained with 8% sucrose and fed on ketamine/xylazine-anesthetized mice for egg production. FREP1 was cloned using PCR with primers shown in Table 1 from an An. gambiae mosquito cDNA library. The PCR product and pQE30 plasmid were digested with restriction enzymes XmaI and HindIII. Products were ligated into a His6 expression plasmid and transformed into Escherichia coli JM109. The sequence-verified construct was subsequently transformed into E. coli M15 strain. One mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was used to induce gene expression in E. coli M15 transformants. Cells were lysed in buffer B (8 m urea, 100 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris·Cl, pH 8.0). Recombinant FREP1 was purified by a Ni-NTA column using a standard protocol (20QIAGEN The QIAexpressionist: A handbood for high-level expression and purification of 6XHis-tagged proteins. QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany2003: 1-128Google Scholar). Four ml of E. coli lysate was collected from 200 ml of culture, and the amount of recombinant FREP1 in E. coli lysate was about 4.0 mg according to bands on the SDS-PAGE comparing to standard markers. In the end, about 0.85 mg of purified FREP1 was obtained with a recovery rate of 21%. SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 staining confirmed the purity of recombinant FREP1. Purified recombinant FREP1 was then used as an antigen to generate customized polyclonal antibody against FREP1 in rabbits (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL). Anti-FREP1 antibody was purified from antiserum by protein A-agarose affinity chromatography and suspended in PBS.TABLE 1PCR primersPurposePrimer namePrimer sequenceIn vitro synthesis of FREP1 dsRNAForward5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGAGCTCGAGGTGAAGCAGAG-3′Reverse5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGTTCTCCAGCCGGTTGTGT-3′Verify FREP1 mRNA expressionForward5′-ACAGGGCAAGTTCGAGAAGA-3′Reverse5′-AAGTCAACCGTACCGTCCTG-3′AgS7 geneForward5′-GGCGATCATCATCTACGTGC-3′Reverse5′-GTAGCTGCTGCAAACTTCGG-3′In vitro synthesis of GFP dsRNAForward5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGCAAGTTTGAAGGTGATACCC-3′Reverse5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGCTTTTCGTTGGGATCTTTCG-3′Clone FREP1 into pQE30Forward5′-ACCCGGGCACTGCCCTGAACGGTGCAG-3′Reverse5′-GGCAAGCTTCGCGAACGTCGGCACAGTC-3′Clone FREP1 into pIB/V5-HisForward5′-TCAAAGCTTCACCATGGTGAATTCATTCGTGTCG-3′Reverse5′-ACTCTAGATTACGCGAACGTCGGCACAGTCGTG-3′Reverse with His tagACTCTAGAGCGAACGTCGGCACAGTCGTG Open table in a new tab The complete FREP1 coding sequence was PCR amplified using primers shown in Table 1 from an adult An. gambiae cDNA library. Products were cloned into plasmid pIB/V5-His (Life Technologies) to generate pIB-FREP1 (encoding FREP1) and pIB-FREP1-His (encoding FREP1 with a His6 tag) expression constructs. Constructs were amplified in E. coli DH5α and then purified with endotoxin-free plasmid preparation kits (Sigma). Cabbage looper ovarian cell-derived High Five cells (21Wickham T.J. Davis T. Granados R.R. Shuler M.L. Wood H.A. Screening of insect cell lines for the production of recombinant proteins and infectious virus in the baculovirus expression system.Biotechnol. Prog. 1992; 8: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) were used to express recombinant FREP1 according to the manufacturer's instructions (22Invitrogen InsectSelect BSD system: for stable expression of heterologous proteins in lepidopteran insect cell lines using pIB/V5-His. Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY2008: 1-31Google Scholar). In brief, endotoxin-free plasmids were mixed with Cellfectin® Reagent (1 μl of Cellfectin/μg of plasmids, Invitrogen) in 5–6 ml of Express Five® SFM medium (Invitrogen). Cells were cultured in 25-cm2 cell culture flasks (Greiner Bio-One, Monroe, NC) for 48 h at 27 °C. Medium and cells were separated by centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min. The proteins in the medium were concentrated using Amicon® ULTRA-4 Centrifugal Filter Devices (Milipore, Billerica, MA) by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 10 min. The His6-tagged FREP1 was purified using a Ni-NTA column using a standard protocol (20QIAGEN The QIAexpressionist: A handbood for high-level expression and purification of 6XHis-tagged proteins. QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany2003: 1-128Google Scholar). In total, 0.3 mg of insect cell-expressed recombinant FREP1 was purified from 50 ml of culture medium with an initial amount of ∼1.0 mg of FREP1 in culture supernatant (estimated based on SDS-PAGE). The yield was ∼30%. Using standard protocols (23Duong-Ly K.C. Gabelli S.B. Gel filtration chromatography (size exclusion chromatography) of proteins.Methods Enzymol. 2014; 541: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), 0.03–1 mg of purified High Five-expressed recombinant FREP1 in 0.1 ml of PBS with or without 0.1% Triton X-100 was subjected to fast protein liquid chromatography gel filtration (Bio-Rad). Sephadex G-200 columns (30 cm in length, 1.0 cm in diameter, 5 to 600 kDa resolution) were used with flow rates regulated to 0.2 ml/min. The void volume (V0) of this column is about 8.0 ml, and the total elution volume (Vt) is about 24.0 ml. Fractions of ∼0.1 ml were collected. Absorbance (A280) was monitored constantly, and ELISA was used to detect recombinant FREP1 in each fraction. Briefly, 50 μl of sample from each fraction was coated per well onto an immunoGrade microplate (Brand, Wertheim, Germany) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Wells were blocked for 1.5 h with 100 μl of 1.0% BSA in PBS, followed by sequential incubation for 1 h with 100 μl of anti-FREP1 antibody (diluted 5,000-fold in PBS-0.2% BSA to a concentration of 0.1 μg/ml) and then 1 h in 100 μl of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma, 1:20,000 dilution with PBS, 0.2% BSA). Wells were washed three times with PBST (0.2% Tween 20 in PBS) between incubations. Wells were developed with 100 μl of p-nitrophenyl phosphate solution (Sigma). When colors in wells were visible, the optical density absorbance at 405 nm was measured. A set of molecular weight standards was used to establish standard curves of molecular masses for the gel filtration columns (aprotinin (6.5 kDa), ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), canalbumin (75 kDa), and ferritin (440 kDa)). The elution (retention) volumes were measured to be 21.05, 18.34, 16.91, 13.65, and 9.38 ml, respectively. The linear regression equation of standard curve based on these standards was y = −6.32x + 44.86, where x is log10 transformed molecular mass in daltons and y is elution volume in milliliters. The correlation coefficient between x and y was 0.99. Midguts from 3–5-day-old naive and blood-fed female mosquitoes were dissected in PBS supplemented with protease inhibitors (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). Tissues were embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen midguts were sectioned (8–10 μm), mounted on super frost plus slides (positively charged), air dried for 30 min at room temperature, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min, and stored at −20 °C until use. Prior to staining, sections were re-hydrated in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.6) with 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) for 10 min. Sections were blocked with 5% dry milk in TBST for 30 min, and then incubated for 2 h with 2.5 μg/ml of purified rabbit anti-FREP1 antibodies diluted in blocking solution. Control sections were incubated with blocking solution containing preimmune rabbit antibodies. Samples were washed 3 times for 5 min with TBST and then incubated for 30 min with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Sigma) diluted 1:20,000 in blocking solution. Slides were then washed 3 times in TBST and developed with BCIP/NBT Chromogenic solution (Sigma) for 10–20 min. Sections were examined under a microscope at ×4 and 40 magnification. Photoshop (version CC 2014) software was used to measure the “gray values” of an area of interest. The pixel intensity was obtained by subtracting the gray value from a constant value of 255. For IHC staining images of mosquito midguts, three different rectangles (0.01 square inches each, chosen randomly) within PM were selected with the “Rectangular Marquee Tool.” After clicking “Record Measurements,” the mean gray value of the region of interest was obtained. The average of three measured gray values (mean) from three selected areas was used to represent a value of an experimental image. The same procedure was conducted outside of the PM to establish gray values for background signals. The pixel intensity value of an area was obtained by subtracting the measured gray values of the area within PM from the background gray values. The measurements from three slices were used to calculate the mean ± S.D. The same procedure was conducted to obtain the pixel intensity of control groups. To measure the average pixel intensity on a Western blot, we conducted the same procedure as described above except selecting target bands from experimental groups and control groups, and the areas from experimental groups were the same as the areas from control groups. The pixel intensity of the background was calculated from regions adjacent to the bands. Three replicates of the Western blot that were conducted exactly the same were used to calculate the mean pixel intensity and standard deviations. Quantification of pixel intensity (gray values) was independently validated by both measuring pixel intensity as a function of exposure time and by using other software (such as Microsoft PowerPoint) to change the brightness and/or contrast of an image. Calculations were consistent across multiple software applications. P. falciparum parasites (NF54 strain from MR4) were propagated in O+ fresh human blood (4% red blood cells (RBC), 0.25–0.5% parasitemia). Cultures were maintained in 6-well plates (Corning Inc., Costar) with 5.0 ml of complete RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated human AB-type serum (Interstate blood bank, Memphis, TN) and 12.5 μg/ml of hypoxanthine. The plates were maintained under 37 °C in a candle jar (24Jensen J.B. Trager W. Plasmodium falciparum in culture: use of outdated erthrocytes and description of the candle jar method.J. Parasitol. 1977; 63: 883-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) and the medium was replaced daily until days 15–17. The parasitemia or gametocytemia was checked every other day by Giemsa staining of thin blood smears. For ookinete enrichment, P. falciparum cultures harboring stage V gametocytes were diluted 10-fold in complete RPMI 1640 without sodium bicarbonate and incubated at room temperature for 24 h as described (25Beetsma A.L. van de Wiel T.J. Sauerwein R.W. Eling W.M. Plasmodium berghei ANKA: purification of large numbers of infectious gametocytes.Exp. Parasitol. 1998; 88: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). P. falciparum culturing and infection experiments were conducted in the biosafety level 2 (BSL2) laboratory at the University of Oklahoma. Standard IFA was performed as described previously (26Korochkina S. Barreau C. Pradel G. Jeffery E. Li J. Natarajan R. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D. Frevert U. Vernick K.D. A mosquito-specific protein family includes candidate receptors for malaria sporozoite invasion of salivary glands.Cell. Microbiol. 2006; 8: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In brief, P. falciparum cultures were deposited on coverslips (Fisher Scientific). Cells and parasites were immediately fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 30 min, which preserved intact (non-permeabilized) cell membranes. Cells were then sequentially incubated with 100 mm glycine in PBS for 20 min, 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for 90 min, High Five cell-expressed FREP1 (10 μg/ml) in 0.2% BSA-PBS for 2 h, enhancer (Alexa Fluor® 594 goat anti-mouse SFX kit, Invitrogen) for 30 min, 5 μg/ml of anti-FREP1 antibody in PBS containing 0.2% BSA for 1 h, and 2 μg/ml of secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor® 594 goat anti-rabbit antibody, in PBS containing 0.2% BSA, Invitrogen) for 30 min in the dark. Between each incubation, the cells were washed 3 times for 3 min in PBS containing 0.2% BSA. Coverslips were rinsed in distilled water for 20 s and mounted on glass slides using 50 μl of Vectashield mounting media (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Cell staining was examined using a Nikon Eclipse Ti-S fluorescence microscope. The fluoresence (pixel) intensity was measured as described above. The fluoresence intensity of a target region of an image was calculated by substracting the mean background fluoresence intensity (gray values) from the mean target fluoresence intensity (gray values). The fluoresence intensity values from three independent experiments or three controls were measured to calculate the mean ± S.D. Three to 5-day-old mosquitoes were fed on anesthetized mice and then maintained with 8% sugar. About 18 h after the blood meal, the engorged mosquitoes were dissected in 1× PBS supplemented with protease inhibitors (PBSI) (Pierce Protease Inhibitor Mini Tablets, EDTA-free, Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). The blood bolus in each midgut was removed manually. The dissected midguts were washed three times with PBSI. Each replicate contained at least 10 midguts. The same number of unfed (control) mosquito midguts was examined in parallel. Insect cell-expressed recombinant FREP1 (0.75 μg in 100 μl of PBSI) was incubated with experimental and control midguts for 1.5 h. An equivalent amount (0.75 μg in 100 μl of PBSI) of BSA was used as an additional control. The midguts were then washed three times with PBSI, and shredded with a micro-pestle in PBSI containing 0.5% Tween 20 in 1.5-ml tubes. The insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 2 min. Supernatants (100 μl) were added into immunoGrade microplates and the plates were incubated overnight at 4 °C. ELISA was used to quantify the relative amount of FREP1 in each reaction. FREP1 was cloned from an An. gambiae mosquito cDNA library as described in our previous work (13Li J. Wang X. Zhang G. Githure J.I. Yan G. James A.A. Genome-block expression-assisted association studies discover malaria resistance genes in Anopheles gambiae.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 20675-20680Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, nested PCR using the primers listed in Table 1 was used to generate a DNA template for synthesis of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) using the in vitro transcription system T7 Megascript (Amibon, TX). The non-mosquito, negative control sequence was amplified from the Aequoria green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene using the primers listed in Table 1. dsRNA was synthesized from these gene fragments using the in vitro transcription system T7 Megascript (Amibon, TX). The FREP1 targeting construct spans a unique sequence from nucleotide 791 to 1,268, corresponding to amino acids 263 to 423 of FREP1. Blast analyses confirmed that no other genes in An. gambiae share significant DNA sequence identity with the targeted sequence of FREP1. The dsRNA was purified with a Qiagen RNA purification kit. Approximately 207 ng of dsRNA in a 69-nl solution was injected into the hemocoel of each cold-anesthetized, 1-day-old An. gambiae G3 female mosquitoes. Approximately 100 mosquitoes per treatment were used for the RNAi knockdown experiments. Thirty-six hours after dsRNA injection, the treated mosquitoes were fed with P. falciparum-infected blood containing 0.2% gametocytes in standard membrane feeding assays (27Goodman A.L. Blagborough A.M. Biswas S. Wu Y. Hill A.V. Sinden R.E. Draper S.J. A viral vectored prime-boost immunization regime targeting the malaria Pfs25 antigen induces transmission-blocking activity.PloS One. 2011; 6: e29428Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Seven days post-infection and feeding, treated mosquitoes were dissected in PBS and oocysts numbers were counted using light microscopy after staining with 0.1% mercury dibromofluorescein disodium salt in PBS. In the negative control groups, ∼100 mosquitoes injected with dsRNA targeting GFP were exposed to the same parasite cultures, and were processed identically to the experimental groups. The transcript knockdown efficiency was confirmed by the quantitative RT-PCR in five treated mosquitoes that were taken randomly 12 h after infection. In parallel, reductions in FREP1 in mosquito midguts were confirmed using IHC assays as described above, except replacing secondary reagents with Alexa Fluor® 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody. Fluorescent staining intensity was quantified as described above. P. falciparum-infected blood cultures containing mature stage V gametocytes were diluted with the fresh O+ type human blood to get the 0.2% final concentration of stage V gametocytes. An equal volume of heat-inactivated (65 °C for 15 min) AB-type human serum was added. Identical volumes of PBS (1/10 volume of blood) containing different concentrations of rabbit polyclonal anti-FREP1 antibody (5, 4, 2, 1, and 0.5 mg/ml) were added to the gametocyte cultures. Artificial membrane feeding was conducted using 3-day-old female naive mosquitoes. After feeding for 15 min, engorged mosquitoes were separated and maintained with 8% sugar in a BSL2 insectary (28 °C, 12-h light/dark cycle, 80% humidity) at the University of Oklahoma. Seven days after infection, midguts were dissected, stained with 0.1% mercurochrome, and examined using light microscopy to count the number of oocysts. Equivalent amounts of purified preimmune rabbit antibody (Thermo Scientific) were used as controls. To begin to understand the basic biochemical characteristics of FREP1, we first examined its functional domains. According to our previous genome annotation (28Li J. Ribeiro J.M. Yan G. Allelic gene structure variations in Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes.PLoS One. 2010; 5: e10699Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), full-length FREP1 comprises 738 amino acids, including a 22-amino acid signal peptide at the N terminus, three coiled-coil regions, and a conserved ∼200-amino acid FBN domain at the C terminus (Fig. 1A). All six cysteine amino acid residues are within the C-terminal FBN domain. To generate anti-FRE"

Juvenile salmon leave their natal rivers at different sizes, ages and times of the year, and it is thought that this life history variation contributes to their population sustainability, and is thus central to many recovery efforts. However, in order to preserve and restore diversity in life history traits, it is necessary to first understand how environmental factors affect their expression and success. We used otolith (87)Sr/(86)Sr in adult Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytcha) returning to the Stanislaus River in the California Central Valley (USA) to reconstruct the sizes at which they outmigrated as juveniles in a wetter (2000) and drier (2003) year. We compared rotary screw trap-derived estimates of outmigrant timing, abundance and size with those reconstructed in the adults from the same cohort. This allowed us to estimate the relative survival and contribution of migratory phenotypes (fry, parr, smolts) to the adult spawning population under different flow regimes. Juvenile abundance and outmigration behavior varied with hydroclimatic regime, while downstream survival appeared to be driven by size- and time-selective mortality. Although fry survival is generally assumed to be negligible in this system, >20% of the adult spawners from outmigration year 2000 had outmigrated as fry. In both years, all three phenotypes contributed to the spawning population, however their relative proportions differed, reflecting greater fry contributions in the wetter year (23% vs. 10%) and greater smolt contributions in the drier year (13% vs. 44%). These data demonstrate that the expression and success of migratory phenotypes vary with hydrologic regime, emphasizing the importance of maintaining diversity in a changing climate."
https://openalex.org/W2139070237,"Processes occurring early in the life stages of corals can greatly influence the demography of coral populations, and successful settlement of coral larvae that leads to recruitment is a critical life history stage for coral reef ecosystems. Although corals in Singapore persist in one the world's most anthropogenically impacted reef systems, our understanding of the role of coral settlement in the persistence of coral communities in Singapore remains limited. Spatial and temporal patterns of coral settlement were examined at 7 sites in the southern islands of Singapore, using settlement tiles deployed and collected every 3 months from 2011 to 2013. Settlement occurred year round, but varied significantly across time and space. Annual coral settlement was low (~54.72 spat m(-2) yr(-1)) relative to other equatorial regions, but there was evidence of temporal variation in settlement rates. Peak settlement occurred between March-May and September-November, coinciding with annual coral spawning periods (March-April and October), while the lowest settlement occurred from December-February during the northeast monsoon. A period of high settlement was also observed between June and August in the first year (2011/12), possibly due to some species spawning outside predicted spawning periods, larvae settling from other locations or extended larval settlement competency periods. Settlement rates varied significantly among sites, but spatial variation was relatively consistent between years, suggesting the strong effects of local coral assemblages or environmental conditions. Pocilloporidae were the most abundant coral spat (83.6%), while Poritidae comprised only 6% of the spat, and Acroporidae <1%. Other, unidentifiable families represented 10% of the coral spat. These results indicate that current settlement patterns are reinforcing the local adult assemblage structure ('others'; i.e. sediment-tolerant coral taxa) in Singapore, but that the replenishment capacity of Singapore's reefs appears relatively constrained, which could lead to less resilient reefs."
https://openalex.org/W401579481,"Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) play important roles in the protection of cells against toxins and oxidative damage where one Arabidopsis member, GSTF8, has become a commonly used marker gene for early stress and defense responses. A GSTF8 promoter fragment fused to the luciferase reporter gene was used in a forward genetic screen for Arabidopsis mutants with up-regulated GSTF8 promoter activity. This identified the esr1-1 (enhanced stress response 1) mutant which also conferred increased resistance to the fungal pathogen Fusarium oxysporum. Through positional cloning, the ESR1 gene was found to encode a KH-domain containing RNA-binding protein (At5g53060). Whole transcriptome sequencing of esr1-1 identified altered expression of genes involved in responses to biotic and abiotic stimuli, hormone signaling pathways and developmental processes. In particular was an overall significant enrichment for jasmonic acid (JA) mediated processes in the esr1-1 down-regulated dataset. A subset of these genes were tested for MeJA inducibility and we found the expression of some but not all were reduced in esr1-1. The esr1-1 mutant was not impaired in other aspects of JA-signalling such as JA- sensitivity or development, suggesting ESR1 functions in specific components of the JA-signaling pathway. Examination of salicylic acid (SA) regulated marker genes in esr1-1 showed no increase in basal or SA induced expression suggesting repression of JA-regulated genes is not due to antagonistic SA-JA crosstalk. These results define new roles for KH-domain containing proteins with ESR1 unlinking JA-mediated growth and defense responses."
https://openalex.org/W1504666867,"Attitude to morality, reflecting cultural norms and values, is considered unique to human social behavior. Resulting moral behavior in a social environment is controlled by a widespread neural network including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), which plays an important role in decision making. In the present study we investigate the influence of neurophysiological modulation of DLPFC reactivity by means of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on moral reasoning. For that purpose we administered anodal, cathodal, and sham stimulation of the left DLPFC while subjects judged the appropriateness of hard moral personal dilemmas. In contrast to sham and cathodal stimulation, anodal stimulation induced a shift in judgment of personal moral dilemmas towards more non-utilitarian actions. Our results demonstrate that alterations of left DLPFC activity can change moral judgments and, in consequence, provide a causal link between left DLPFC activity and moral reasoning. Most important, the observed shift towards non-utilitarian actions suggests that moral decision making is not a permanent individual trait but can be manipulated; consequently individuals with boundless, uncontrollable, and maladaptive moral behavior, such as found in psychopathy, might benefit from neuromodulation-based approaches."

https://openalex.org/W267792555,"The olive fly, Bactrocera oleae (Rossi), a serious threat to the olive crop worldwide, displays ovipositon preference for some olive cultivars but the causes are still unclear. In the present work, three Portuguese olive cultivars with different susceptibilities to olive fly (Cobrançosa, Madural, and Verdeal Transmontana) were studied, aiming to determine if the olive volatiles are implicated in this interaction. Olive volatiles were assessed by SPME-GC-MS in the three cultivars during maturation process to observe possible correlations with olive fly infestation levels. Overall, 34 volatiles were identified in the olives, from 7 chemical classes (alcohols, aldehydes, aromatic hydrocarbons, esters, ketones, sesquiterpenes, and terpenes). Generally, total volatile amounts decrease during maturation but toluene, the main compound, increased in all cultivars, particularly in those with higher susceptibility to olive fly. Sesquiterpenes also raised, mainly α-copaene. Toluene and α-copaene, recognized oviposition promoters to olive fly, were correlated with the infestation level of cvs. Madural and Verdeal Trasnmontana (intermediate and highly susceptible cultivars respectively), while no correlations were established with cv. Cobrançosa (less susceptible). No volatiles with inverse correlation were observed. Volatile composition of olives may be a decisive factor in the olive fly choice to oviposit and this could be the basis for the development of new control strategies for this pest."
https://openalex.org/W1878050798,"Dissociation, particularly the shutting down of sensory, motor and speech systems, has been proposed to emerge in susceptible individuals as a defensive response to traumatic stress. In contrast, other individuals show signs of hyperarousal to acute threat. A key question is whether exposure to particular types of stressful events during specific stages of development can program an individual to have a strong dissociative response to subsequent stressors. Vulnerability to ongoing shutdown dissociation was assessed in 75 inpatients (46 M/29 F, M = 31 ± 10 years old) with schizophrenia spectrum disorder and related to number of traumatic events experienced or witnessed during childhood or adulthood. The Maltreatment and Abuse Chronology of Exposure (MACE) scale was used to collect retrospective recall of exposure to ten types of maltreatment during each year of childhood. Severity of shutdown dissociation was related to number of childhood but not adult traumatic events. Random forest regression with conditional trees indicated that type and timing of childhood maltreatment could predictably account for 31% of the variance (p < 0.003) in shutdown dissociation, with peak vulnerability occurring at 13-14 years of age and with exposure to emotional neglect followed by various forms of emotional abuse. These findings suggest that there may be windows of vulnerability to the development of shutdown dissociation. Results support the hypothesis that experienced events are more important than witnessed events, but challenge the hypothesis that ""life-threatening"" events are a critical determinant."

Kidneys of α7(-/-) mice showed greater accumulation of inflammatory cells and higher expression of chemokines and cytokines than did those of WT mice. In addition, in α7(-/-) fibrotic kidneys, the expression of fibrin, collagen, TGF-β, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-2 increased, and the expression of TIMP3 declined. The increase in counterregulatory responses to inflammation in α7(-/-) nephritic kidneys did not compensate for the lack of α7nAChR. These findings indicate that α7nAChR plays a key role in regulating the inflammatory response in anti-GBM GN and that disruption of the endogenous protective α7nAChR amplifies inflammation to accelerate kidney damage and fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2210131009,"We used insertional mutagenesis by Agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation (ATMT) to isolate pathogenicity mutants of Colletotrichum higginsianum. From a collection of 7200 insertion mutants we isolated 75 mutants with reduced symptoms. 19 of these were affected in host penetration, while 17 were affected in later stages of infection, like switching to necrotrophic growth. For 16 mutants the location of T-DNA insertions could be identified by PCR. A potential plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase Pma2 was targeted in five independent insertion mutants. We genetically inactivated the Ku80 component of the non-homologous end-joining pathway in C. higginsianum to establish an efficient gene knockout protocol. Chpma2 deletion mutants generated by homologous recombination in the ΔChku80 background form fully melanized appressoria but entirely fail to penetrate the host tissue and are non-pathogenic. The ChPMA2 gene is induced upon appressoria formation and infection of A. thaliana. Pma2 activity is not important for vegetative growth of saprophytically growing mycelium, since the mutant shows no growth penalty under these conditions. Colletotrichum higginsianum codes for a closely related gene (ChPMA1), which is highly expressed under most growth conditions. ChPMA1 is more similar to the homologous yeast genes for plasma membrane pumps. We propose that expression of a specific proton pump early during infection may be common to many appressoria forming fungal pathogens as we found ChPMA2 orthologs in several plant pathogenic fungi."
https://openalex.org/W1551972202,"There are a number of studies linking social capital to oral health among older adults, although the evidence base mainly relies on cross-sectional study designs. The possibility of reverse causality is seldom discussed, even though oral health problems could potentially lead to lower social participation. Furthermore, few studies clearly distinguish between the effects of different dimensions of social capital on oral health. The objective of the study was to examine the longitudinal associations between individual social capital and oral health among older adults. We analyzed longitudinal data from the 3rd and 5th waves of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA). Structural social capital was operationalized using measures of social participation, and volunteering. Number of close ties and perceived emotional support comprised the functional dimension of social capital. Oral health measures were having no natural teeth (edentate vs. dentate), self-rated oral health and oral health-related quality of life. Time-lag and autoregressive models were used to explore the longitudinal associations between social capital and oral health. We imputed all missing data, using multivariate imputation by chained equations. We found evidence of bi-directional longitudinal associations between self-rated oral health, volunteering and functional social capital. Functional social capital was a strong predictor of change in oral health-related quality of life - the adjusted odds ratio of reporting poor oral health-related quality of life was 1.75 (1.33-2.30) for older adults with low vs. high social support. However in the reverse direction, poor oral health-related quality of life was not associated with changes in social capital. This suggests that oral health may not be a determinant of social capital. In conclusion, social capital may be a determinant of subjective oral health among older adults rather than edentulousness, despite many cross-sectional studies on the latter."
https://openalex.org/W1579870485,"The bipolar kinesin-5 motors are one of the major players that govern mitotic spindle dynamics. Their bipolar structure enables them to cross-link and slide apart antiparallel microtubules (MTs) emanating from the opposing spindle poles. The budding yeast kinesin-5 Cin8 was shown to switch from fast minus-end- to slow plus-end-directed motility upon binding between antiparallel MTs. This unexpected finding revealed a new dimension of cellular control of transport, the mechanism of which is unknown. Here we have examined the role of the C-terminal tail domain of Cin8 in regulating directionality. We first constructed a stable dimeric Cin8/kinesin-1 chimera (Cin8Kin), consisting of head and neck linker of Cin8 fused to the stalk of kinesin-1. As a single dimeric motor, Cin8Kin switched frequently between plus and minus directionality along single MTs, demonstrating that the Cin8 head domains are inherently bidirectional, but control over directionality was lost. We next examined the activity of a tetrameric Cin8 lacking only the tail domains (Cin8Δtail). In contrast to wild-type Cin8, the motility of single molecules of Cin8Δtail in high ionic strength was slow and bidirectional, with almost no directionality switches. Cin8Δtail showed only a weak ability to cross-link MTs in vitro. In vivo, Cin8Δtail exhibited bias toward the plus-end of the MTs and was unable to support viability of cells as the sole kinesin-5 motor. We conclude that the tail of Cin8 is not necessary for bidirectional processive motion, but is controlling the switch between plus- and minus-end-directed motility."
https://openalex.org/W1519889213,"Nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) mutations are frequently found in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and the newly generated sequences were suggested to induce immune response contributing to the relatively favorable outcome of patients in this AML subset. We hypothesized that if an efficient immune response against mutated nucleophosmin can be induced in vivo, the individuals expressing HLA alleles suitable for presenting NPM-derived peptides should be less prone to developing AML associated with NPM1 mutation. We thus compared HLA class I frequencies in a cohort of patients with mutated NPM1 (63 patients, NPMc+), a cohort of patients with wild-type NPM1 (94 patients, NPMwt) and in normal individuals (large datasets available from Allele Frequency Net Database). Several HLA allelic groups were found to be depleted in NPMc+ patients, but not in NPMwt compared to the normal distribution. The decrease was statistically significant for HLA B(*)07, B(*)18, and B(*)40. Furthermore, statistically significant advantage in the overall survival was found for patients with mutated NPM1 expressing at least one of the depleted allelic groups. The majority of the depleted alleles were predicted to bind potent NPM-derived immunopeptides and, importantly, these peptides were often located in the unmutated part of the protein. Our analysis suggests that individuals expressing specific HLA allelic groups are disposed to develop an efficient anti-AML immune response thanks to aberrant cytoplasmic localization of the mutated NPM protein."
https://openalex.org/W218221756,"P-glycoprotein (P-gp; ABCB1) is an ABC drug pump that protects us from toxic compounds. It is clinically important because it confers multidrug resistance. The homologous halves of P-gp each contain a transmembrane (TM) domain (TMD) with 6 TM segments followed by a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD). The drug- and ATP-binding sites reside at the interface between the TMDs and NBDs, respectively.

Therefore, NBD2 might be critical for stabilizing ICLs 2 and 3 that form a tetrahelix bundle at the NBD2 interface. Here we report that the NBD1 and NBD2 transmission interfaces in P-gp are asymmetric. Point mutations to 25 of 60 ICL2/ICL3 residues at the NBD2 transmission interface severely reduced P-gp assembly while changes to the equivalent residues in ICL1/ICL4 at the NBD1 interface had little effect.

Human ABC proteins have been the subjects of intense research efforts since most are clinically important. Cystic fibrosis (CF), gout, intrahepatic cholestasis types 2 and 3 (liver bile diseases), Tangier disease (HDL deficiency), Dubin-Johnson syndrome (jaundice), hyperinsulimic hypoglycemia of infancy, pseudoxanthoma elasticum, multidrug resistance, secretory diarrheas, anemia, diabetes, and atherosclerosis are examples of potentially lethal or debilitating conditions caused by genetic mutations or altered activity of one of the 48 human ABC proteins (2Borst P. Elferink R.O. Mammalian abc transporters in health and disease.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 537-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar). The most common genetic defect is expression of an ABC processing mutant that is defective in folding and trafficking. The classic example is the ΔF508-CFTR (ABCC7) mutant in CF (3Riordan J.R.

A high priority is to understand how processing mutations impact synthesis of ABC proteins and use this knowledge to develop therapies to repair the defects. Human ABC proteins appear to be particularly sensitive to point mutations because they are multi-domain membrane proteins (core structure of two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) and two transmembrane domains (TMDs)) that require formation of specific domain-domain contacts to adopt a native structure (5Ostedgaard L.S.

ABC proteins differ from other multi-domain proteins because much of the folding occurs post-translationally (6Du K. Sharma M. Lukacs G.L.

P-gp is a classic ABC protein as it is a single polypeptide of 1280 amino acids that forms a structure containing two NBDs and two TMDs. Its physiological role is block entry or export toxic compounds out of the body. The interfaces between the domains play critical roles in the P-gp drug efflux mechanism.

Coupling of ATP hydrolysis in the NBDs to drug efflux from the drug-binding sites in the TMDs is mediated by ball-and-socket joints (21Jin M.S. Oldham M.L. Zhang Q. Chen J. Crystal structure of the multidrug transporter P-glycoprotein from Caenorhabditis elegans.Nature. 2012; 490: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) at the NBD-TMD transmission interfaces. Ball-and-socket joints are intracellular loops (ICLs) connecting TM segments that contain a central intracellular helix (IH) that is in close contact to an NBD. Contacts between TMD1-NBD1 or TMD2-NBD2 are mediated by the first ICL of each TMD (ICL1 or ICL3). The second ICL of each TMD mediates TMD1-NBD2 (ICL2) or TMD2-NBD1 (ICL4) contacts. Contacts between the homologous halves (TMD1-NBD2 or TMD2-NBD1) appear to be particularly important for mammalian drug pumps. For example, the BCRP/ABCG2 drug pump lacks contacts equivalent to P-gp ICL1/ICL3 (22Rosenberg M.F. Bikadi Z. Chan J. Liu X. Ni Z. Cai X. Ford R.C. Mao Q. The human breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP/ABCG2) shows conformational changes with mitoxantrone.Structure. 2010; 18: 482-493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In addition, we found that mutations to IH1 (ICL1) had little effect on activity or maturation while mutations to IH2 (ICL2) suggested the presence of a hydrophobic interface that was highly sensitive to changes (23Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. Human P-glycoprotein contains a greasy ball-and-socket joint at the second transmission interface.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 20326-20333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The presence of such an interface was unexpected since modeling studies suggested that charged residues would play a dominant role (24Pajeva I.K. Hanl M. Wiese M. Protein contacts and ligand binding in the inward-facing model of human P-glycoprotein.ChemMedChem. 2013; 8: 748-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Hypersensitivity to mutation at the IH2/NBD2 transmission interface compared with the IH1/NBD1 interface might explain the differences in the maturation of NBD2 deletion mutants of P-gp and CFTR (25Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Shi L. Clarke D.M. Corrector-mediated rescue of misprocessed CFTR mutants can be reduced by the P-glycoprotein drug pump.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2012; 83: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Deletion of NBD2 inhibits folding and trafficking of P-gp but not CFTR although both are structurally similar ABC proteins (26Wang Y. Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. Modulating the folding of P-glycoprotein and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator truncation mutants with pharmacological chaperones.Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 71: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It is possible that ICL2/ICL3 interactions with NBD2 are critical for P-gp maturation and the protein is destabilized when NBD2 is deleted. Understanding P-gp domain-domain interactions will also be of importance when extrapolated to folding defects of other mutant ABC proteins associated with disease and in the design of methods to counteract their effects. It has been shown that in processing mutations of P-gp or CFTR trap the proteins as partially folded intermediates with incomplete NBD-TMD interactions (7Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M.

Chem. 2008; 283: 28190-28197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In this study, we tested whether the NBD2 transmission interface was particularly critical for P-gp assembly and activity by comparing the effects of mutations at the NBD1-TMD and NBD2-TMD interfaces. We report that the interfaces are asymmetric since P-gp maturation was only sensitive to mutations at the NBD2 interface. The results suggest that the NBD2-TMD interface is a linchpin for assembly and repair of ABC proteins.

Briefly, 10 μl of 2.5 m CaCl2 was added to 90 μl H2O containing 2 μg of DNA followed by addition of 100 μl of BES solution (50 mm N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid, 280 mm NaCl and 1.5 mm Na2HPO4, pH 6.96). After 10 min at room temperature, 4 ml of HEK 293 cells (about 100,000 cells/ml) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with high glucose (supplemented with nonessential amino acids, 4 mm l-glutamine, 10 IU/ml penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% (v/v) bovine calf serum) was added and 1.5 ml of the mixtures were added to duplicate well of 6-well culture plates. After 5 h at 37 °C, the medium was replaced with fresh medium with or without 0.5 μm tariquidar. About 16 h later, the cells were harvested, washed with PBS, and cell pellets suspended in 150 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% (w/v) SDS, 4% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol containing 25 mm EDTA. Samples were applied to 6.5% SDS-PAGE gels (minigels, 1.5 mm spacers, 15 wells). The gels were electroblotted onto a sheet of nitrocellulose and P-gp proteins detected using A52 monoclonal antibody, horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody, and enhanced chemiluminescence. The signals were imaged and levels of mature (170 kDa) P-gp relative to total P-gp (mature 170 kDa plus immature 150 kDa) determined using ChemidocTM XRS+ with Image LabTM software (Bio-Rad Lab.

An equivalent amount of the sample was loaded onto 10% (v/v) SDS-PAGE gels and subjected to immunoblot analysis with a monoclonal antibody against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GADPH) (internal control). HEK 293 cells were plated onto fifty plates (10-cm diameter) and transfected with the cDNA of the histidine-tagged P-gp mutant when about 50% confluent. After 16 h at 37 °C, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 5 μm cyclosporin A. Cyclosporin A is a substrate of P-gp and acts as a potent pharmacological chaperone in promoting maturation and yield of P-gp (9Loo T.W. Clarke D.M.

Cyclosporin A rather than tariquidar was used to rescue the mutants for purification because it is considerably less expensive when used in scaled up experiments. The cells were harvested after another 24 h at 37 °C and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4). The cells were then suspended in PBS and solubilized at 4 °C by addition of one volume (0.75 ml) of PBS containing 2% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (Anatrace Inc., Maumee, OH).

The column was then washed twice with 0.6 ml buffer B containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 80 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 20% (v/v) glycerol and 0.1% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside and twice with 0.6 ml buffer C (buffer B containing 50 mm imidazole). Histidine-tagged P-gp was then eluted with 0.2 ml of buffer B but containing 300 mm imidazole. Recovery of P-gp was monitored by immunoblot analysis with rabbit anti-P-gp polyclonal antibody (32Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. P-glycoprotein.

Cys-less P-gp or the ICL1/ICL4 double cysteine mutants I160C/F904C or F163C/R905C were transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells at reduced temperature (30 °C) to promote maturation. The P-gps were isolated by nickel-chelate chromatography. The isolated P-gps were incubated 20 °C for 10 min in the presence or absence of 0.5 mm copper phenanthroline (oxidant to promote disulfide bond formation). EDTA was then added to a final concentration of 2 mm. Immunoblot analysis and assay of ATPase activity were performed as described above. The NBDs of P-gp are linked to the TMDs by four ICLs (Fig. 1, A and B). The IH located in the middle of the ICLs interacts with the NBDs to form ball-and-socket joints (21Jin M.S. Oldham M.L.

The NBD1 transmission interface is linked to TMD1 and TMD2 by ICL1 and ICL4, respectively. The NBD2 transmission interface is linked to TMD1 and TMD2 by ICL2 and ICL3, respectively. The transmission interfaces might play critical roles to promote folding of P-gp into a native structure. P-gp is initially synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum to yield a protease-sensitive loosely folded protein with incomplete packing of the TM segments and incomplete domain-domain interactions (34Loo T.W.

P-gp then matures into a compact protease-resistant native conformation that leaves the endoplasmic reticulum for addition of complex carbohydrate in the Golgi and trafficking to the plasma membrane (36Loo T.W.

Removal of the NBDs inhibits maturation of P-gp. P-gp is different from CFTR because deletion of NBD2 only inhibits P-gp maturation (26Wang Y. Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. Modulating the folding of P-glycoprotein and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator truncation mutants with pharmacological chaperones.Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 71: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This indicated that the NBD2-TMD interface might play a particularly important role in the mechanism of P-gp folding. Truncation mutants lacking NBD2 or both NBDs are trapped in the endoplasmic reticulum in protease-sensitive loosely folded conformations (37Loo T.W. Clarke D.M.

A mutational approach was used to test if residues in the ICLs at the NBD2 transmission interface played more important roles in maturation of P-gp compared with residues in the ICLs at the NBD1 interface. Maturation of P-gp can readily be monitored in whole cell assays as the protein contains three N-glycosylation sites in the extracellular loop connecting TM segments 1 and 2 (Fig. 1A). The protein is initially synthesized as a 150 kDa core-glycosylated protein. If the protein correctly folds into a compact structure it can exit the endoplasmic reticulum for modification of the carbohydrate in the Golgi to yield a 170 kDa mature protein. Accordingly, 84 mutants were constructed that contained point mutations to residues in IH4/ICL4 and residues in ICL1, ICL2, and ICL3 flanking IH1, IH2, and IH3, respectively (segments of about 30 residues). The 36 IH1, IH2, and IH3 mutants constructed in previous studies (23Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M.

https://openalex.org/W219158074,"Lake Turkana is an understudied desert lake shared by Kenya and Ethiopia. This system is at the precipice of large-scale changes in ecological function due to climate change and economic development along its major inflowing river, the Omo River. To anticipate response by the fish community to these changes, we quantified trophic diversity for seven ecological disparate species (Alestes baremose, Hydrocynus forskalli, Labeo horie, Lates niloticus, Oreochromis niloticus, Synodontis schall, and Tilapia zillii) using stable isotopes. Based on their marked morphological differentiation, we postulated that dietary niches of these species would be similar in size but show little overlap. The degree of trophic diversity varied greatly among the species studied, refuting our hypothesis regarding dietary niche size. Oreochromis niloticus and L. niloticus had the highest trophic diversity and significantly larger dietary niches than T. zillii, A. baremose and H. forskalli. Low overlap among the dietary niches of the seven species, with the exception of the synodontid catfish S. schall, is consistent with our second hypothesis. PREDICTING SPECIES’ VULNERABILITY: Breeding vulnerability was highest among those species with the lowest trophic diversity. We predict that in suffering two strikes against them, A. baremose, H. forskalli, T. zillii, and L. horie will be most affected by the highly altered Lake Turkana ecosystem and that O. niloticus, L. niloticus and S. schall will be least affected. Low vulnerability among O. niloticus and L. niloticus is promising for the future of the lake's fishery, but the third most important fishery species (L. horie) will be highly vulnerable to impending ecosystem change. T. zillii should be treated as separate from O. niloticus in the fishery given higher sensitivity and a different ecological role. We see potential for expansion of the fishery for S. schall but don't recommend the development of a fishery for A. baremose and H. forskalli."
https://openalex.org/W211380578,"Recent findings have revealed that gut microbiota plays a substantial role in modulating diseases such as autism, rheumatoid arthritis, allergies, and cancer that occur at sites distant to the gut. Athymic nude mice have been employed for tumorigenic research for decades; however, the relationships between the gut microbiome and host's response in drug treatment to the grafted tumors have not been explored. In this study, we analyzed the fecal microbiome of nonxenograft and xenograft nude mice treated with phytosaponins from a popular medicinal plant, Gynostemma pentaphyllum (Gp). Analysis of enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC)-PCR data showed that the microbiota profile of xenograft mice departed from that of the nonxenograft mice. After ten days of treatment with Gp saponins (GpS), the microbiota of the treated mice was closer to the microbiota at Day 0 before the implantation of the tumor. Data obtained from 16S pyrosequencing of fecal samples reiterates the differences in microbiome between the nonxenograft and xenograft mice. GpS markedly increased the relative abundance of Clostridium cocleatum and Bacteroides acidifaciens, for which the beneficial effects on the host have been well documented. This study, for the first time, characterizes the properties of gut microbiome in nude mice responding to tumor implant and drug treatment. We also demonstrate that dietary saponins such as GpS can potentially regulate the gut microbial ecosystem by increasing the number of symbionts. Interestingly, this regulation of the gut ecosystem might, at least in part, be responsible for or contribute to the anticancer effect of GpS."

https://openalex.org/W1483873505,"Background Time to first cigarette (TTFC) after waking is an indicator of nicotine dependence. The association between TTFC and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the third leading cause of death in the United States, has not yet been reported. Methods We investigated the cross-sectional association between TTFC and prevalent COPD among 6,108 current smokers in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial. COPD was defined as a self-reported diagnosis of emphysema, chronic bronchitis, or both. Current smokers in PLCO reported TTFC, the amount of time they typically waited before smoking their first cigarette of the day after waking, in four categories: ≤5, 6-30, 31-60, or >60 minutes. We used logistic regression models to investigate the association between TTFC and prevalent COPD with adjustments for age, gender, race, education, and smoking (cigarettes/day, years smoked during lifetime, pack-years, age at smoking initiation), and prior lung cancer diagnosis. Results COPD was reported by 19% of these 6,108 smokers. Individuals with the shortest TTFC had the greatest risk of COPD; compared to those with the longest TTFC (>60 minutes) the adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for COPD were 1.48 (95% CI, 1.15-1.91), 1.64 (95% CI, 1.29-2.08), 2.18 (95% CI, 1.65-2.87) for those with TTFC 31-60 minutes, 6-30 minutes, and ≤5 minutes, respectively (P-trend <0.0001). The association between TTFC and emphysema was similar to that for bronchitis, albeit the ORs were slightly stronger for chronic bronchitis; comparing TTFC ≤5 minutes to >60 minutes, the adjusted OR (95% CI) was 2.29 (1.69-3.12) for emphysema and 2.99 (1.95-4.59) for chronic bronchitis. Conclusions Current smokers with shorter TTFC have increased risk of COPD compared to those with longer TTFC, even after comprehensive adjustment for established smoking covariates. Future epidemiologic studies, including prospective designs, should incorporate TTFC to better assess disease risk and evaluate the potential utility of TTFC as a COPD screening tool for smokers in the clinical setting."
https://openalex.org/W1550230776,"The frequency of caesarean section delivery varies between countries and social groups. Among other factors, it is determined by the quality of obstetrics care. Rates of elective (planned) and emergency (in-labor) caesareans may also vary between immigrants (first generation), their offspring (second- and third-generation women), and non-immigrants because of access and language barriers. Other important points to be considered are whether caesarean section indications and the neonatal outcomes differ in babies delivered by caesarean between immigrants, their offspring, and non-immigrants.A standardized interview on admission to delivery wards at three Berlin obstetric hospitals was performed in a 12-month period in 2011/2012. Questions on socio-demographic and care aspects and on migration (immigrated herself vs. second- and third-generation women vs. non-immigrant) and acculturation status were included. Data was linked with information from the expectant mothers' antenatal records and with perinatal data routinely documented in the hospital. Regression modeling was used to adjust for age, parity and socio-economic status.The caesarean section rates for immigrants, second- and third-generation women, and non-immigrant women were similar. Neither indications for caesarean section delivery nor neonatal outcomes showed statistically significant differences. The only difference found was a somewhat higher rate of crash caesarean sections per 100 births among first generation immigrants compared to non-immigrants.Unlike earlier German studies and current studies from other European countries, this study did not find an increased rate of caesarean sections among immigrants, as well as second- and third-generation women, with the possible exception of a small high-risk group. This indicates an equally high quality of perinatal care for women with and without a migration history."

Here we comprehensively characterise mRNA Nrg1 transcripts throughout development of the Nrg1 TM HET mouse. In addition, we investigate the regulation of high-frequency (gamma) electrophysiological oscillations in this mutant mouse to associate molecular changes in Nrg1 with a schizophrenia-relevant neurophysiological profile.Using exonic probes spanning the cysteine-rich, epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like, transmembrane and intracellular domain encoding regions of Nrg1, mRNA levels were measured using qPCR in hippocampus and frontal cortex from male and female Nrg1 TM HET and wild type-like (WT) mice throughout development. We also performed electrophysiological recordings in adult mice and analysed gamma oscillatory at baseline, in responses to auditory stimuli and to ketamine.In both hippocampus and cortex, Nrg1 TM HET mice show significantly reduced expression of the exon encoding the transmembrane domain of Nrg1 compared with WT, but unaltered mRNA expression encoding the extracellular bioactive EGF-like and the cysteine-rich (type III) domains, and development-specific and region-specific reductions in the mRNA encoding the intracellular domain. Hippocampal Nrg1 protein expression was not altered, but NMDA receptor NR2B subunit phosphorylation was lower in Nrg1 TM HET mice. We identified elevated ongoing and reduced sensory-evoked gamma power in Nrg1 TM HET mice.We found no evidence to support the claim that the Nrg1 TM HET mouse represents a simple haploinsufficient model.

https://openalex.org/W1847744149,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) plays pivotal roles in cell proliferation, differentiation, and tissue development, while EGFs protect neurons from toxic insults by binding EGFR and stimulating survival signaling. Furthermore, recent evidence implicates this receptor in neurometabolic disorders like Alzheimer disease and aging. Here we show that absence of presenilin 1 (PS1) results in dramatic decrease (>95%) of neuronal EGFR and that PS1-null (PS1(-/-)) brains have reduced amounts of this receptor. PS1(-/-) cortical neurons contain little EGFR and show no epidermal growth factor-induced survival signaling or protection against excitotoxicity, but exogenous EGFR rescues both functions even in absence of PS1. EGFR mRNA is greatly reduced (>95%) in PS1(-/-) neurons, and PS1(-/-) brains contain decreased amounts of this mRNA, although PS1 affects the stability of neither EGFR nor its mRNA. Exogenous PS1 increases neuronal EGFR mRNA, while down-regulation of PS1 decreases this mRNA. These effects are neuron specific, as PS1 affects the EGFR of neither glial nor fibroblast cells. In addition, PS1 controls EGFR through novel mechanisms shared with neither γ-secretase nor PS2. Our data reveal that PS1 functions as a positive transcriptional regulator of neuronal EGFR controlling its expression in a cell-specific manner. Severe downregulation of EGFR may contribute to developmental abnormalities and lethal phenotype found in PS1, but not PS2, null mice. Furthermore, PS1 may affect neuroprotection and Alzheimer disease by controlling survival signaling of neuronal EGFR."

Our goal was to gain a mechanistic understanding of alcohol-induced hepatic retinoid depletion. Wild-type and mutant mice were continuously fed alcohol through Lieber-DeCarli liquid diets, with matched control animals pair fed an isocaloric alcohol-free diet to ensure equal nutrient and calorie intake between groups. A systematic analysis of tissue retinol and retinyl ester levels was performed with HPLC, complemented by gene and protein expression analyses. Our results delineated 2 phases of alcohol-induced depletion of hepatic retinoid. Initially, ∼15% of hepatic retinoid content was mobilized from the liver, causing extrahepatic tissue retinoid levels to increase. Subsequently, there was a precipitous drop in hepatic retinoid content (>60%), without further retinoid accumulation in the periphery. Follow-up studies in mutant mice revealed roles for RBP, CRBP1, and CD36 in retinoid mobilization and extrahepatic retinoid uptake, as well as a role for CYP2E1 in the catabolism of hepatic retinoid. In summary, alcohol has a biphasic effect on hepatic retinoid stores, characterized by an initial phase of rapid mobilization to extrahepatic tissues followed by extensive catabolism within the liver."

Coordination chemistry provides a way to understand metal association in biological structures. In this work we have implemented coordination chemistry to study nickel coordination due to its high impact in industrial usage and thereby health consequences. This paper reports the analysis of nickel coordination from a large dataset of nickel bound structures and sequences. Coordination patterns predicted from the structures are reported in terms of donors, chelate length, coordination number, chelate geometry, structural fold and architecture. The analysis revealed histidine as the most favored residue in nickel coordination. The most common chelates identified were histidine based namely HHH, HDH, HEH and HH spaced at specific intervals. Though a maximum coordination number of 8 was observed, the presence of a single protein donor was noted to be mandatory in nickel coordination. The coordination pattern did not reveal any specific fold, nevertheless we report preferable residue spacing for specific structural architecture. In contrast, the analysis of nickel binding proteins from bacterial and archeal species revealed no common coordination patterns. Nickel binding sequence motifs were noted to be organism specific and protein class specific. As a result we identified about 13 signatures derived from 13 classes of nickel binding proteins. The specifications on nickel coordination presented in this paper will prove beneficial for developing better chelation strategies."

Salvianolic acid B (SalB) is a major water-soluble component derived from Salvia miltiorrhiza. Previous studies showed its potential to attenuate microvascular barrier dysfunction, but the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. The present study was intended to investigate the impact of SalB on endothelial cell barrier in vivo in rat mesenteric venules as well as in vitro in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), aiming at disclosing the mechanism thereof, particularly the role of Src in its action. Male Wistar rats were challenged by infusion of LPS (2 mg/kg/h) through left femoral vein for 90 min. SalB (5 mg/kg/h) was administrated either simultaneously with LPS or 30 min after LPS infusion through the left jugular vein. Vesicles in venular walls were observed by electron microscopy. HUVECs were incubated with LPS with or without SalB. The expression of Zonula occluden-1 (ZO-1), VE-cadherin, caveolin-1 and Src in HUVECs was assessed by Western blot and confocal microscopy, binding of SalB to Src was measured using Surface Plasmon Resonance and BioLayer Interferometry. Treatment with SalB inhibited albumin leakage from rat mesenteric venules and inhibited the increase of vesicle number in venular endothelial cells induced by LPS. In addition, SalB inhibited the degradation of ZO-1, the phosphorylation and redistribution of VE-cadherin, the expression and phosphorylation of caveolin-1, and phosphoirylation of Src in HUVECs exposed to LPS. Furthermore, SalB was found able to bind to Src. This study demonstrates that protection of SalB against microvascular barrier disruption is a process involving both para- and trans-endothelial cell pathway, and highly suggests Src as the key enzyme for SalB to work."
https://openalex.org/W1581626383,"Ribosome biogenesis is orchestrated by the action of several accessory factors that provide time and directionality to the process. One such accessory factor is the GTPase EFL1 involved in the cytoplasmic maturation of the ribosomal 60S subunit. EFL1 and SBDS, the protein mutated in the Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SBDS), release the anti-association factor eIF6 from the surface of the ribosomal subunit 60S. Here we report a kinetic analysis of fluorescent guanine nucleotides binding to EFL1 alone and in the presence of SBDS using fluorescence stopped-flow spectroscopy. Binding kinetics of EFL1 to both GDP and GTP suggests a two-step mechanism with an initial binding event followed by a conformational change of the complex. Furthermore, the same behavior was observed in the presence of the SBDS protein irrespective of the guanine nucleotide evaluated. The affinity of EFL1 for GTP is 10-fold lower than that calculated for GDP. Association of EFL1 to SBDS did not modify the affinity for GTP but dramatically decreased that for GDP by increasing the dissociation rate of the nucleotide. Thus, SBDS acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for EFL1 promoting its activation by the release of GDP. Finally, fluorescence anisotropy measurements showed that the S143L mutation present in the Shwachman-Diamond syndrome altered a surface epitope for EFL1 and largely decreased the affinity for it. These results suggest that loss of interaction between these proteins due to mutations in the disease consequently prevents the nucleotide exchange regulation the SBDS exerts on EFL1. Ribosome biogenesis is orchestrated by the action of several accessory factors that provide time and directionality to the process. One such accessory factor is the GTPase EFL1 involved in the cytoplasmic maturation of the ribosomal 60S subunit. EFL1 and SBDS, the protein mutated in the Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SBDS), release the anti-association factor eIF6 from the surface of the ribosomal subunit 60S. Here we report a kinetic analysis of fluorescent guanine nucleotides binding to EFL1 alone and in the presence of SBDS using fluorescence stopped-flow spectroscopy. Binding kinetics of EFL1 to both GDP and GTP suggests a two-step mechanism with an initial binding event followed by a conformational change of the complex. Furthermore, the same behavior was observed in the presence of the SBDS protein irrespective of the guanine nucleotide evaluated. The affinity of EFL1 for GTP is 10-fold lower than that calculated for GDP. Association of EFL1 to SBDS did not modify the affinity for GTP but dramatically decreased that for GDP by increasing the dissociation rate of the nucleotide. Thus, SBDS acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for EFL1 promoting its activation by the release of GDP. Finally, fluorescence anisotropy measurements showed that the S143L mutation present in the Shwachman-Diamond syndrome altered a surface epitope for EFL1 and largely decreased the affinity for it. These results suggest that loss of interaction between these proteins due to mutations in the disease consequently prevents the nucleotide exchange regulation the SBDS exerts on EFL1."
https://openalex.org/W1590765489,"Forest disturbance causes specialization of plant-frugivore networks and jeopardizes mutualistic interactions through reduction of ecological redundancy. To evaluate how simplification of a forest into an agroecosystem affects plant-disperser mutualistic interactions, we compared bat-fruit interaction indexes of specialization in tropical montane cloud forest fragments (TMCF) and shaded-coffee plantations (SCP). Bat-fruit interactions were surveyed by collection of bat fecal samples. Bat-fruit interactions were more specialized in SCP (mean H2 ' = 0.55) compared to TMCF fragments (mean H2 ' = 0.27), and were negatively correlated to bat abundance in SCP (R = -0.35). The number of shared plant species was higher in the TMCF fragments (mean = 1) compared to the SCP (mean = 0.51) and this was positively correlated to the abundance of frugivorous bats (R= 0.79). The higher specialization in SCP could be explained by lower bat abundance and lower diet overlap among bats. Coffee farmers and conservation policy makers must increase the proportion of land assigned to TMCF within agroecosystem landscapes in order to conserve frugivorous bats and their invaluable seed dispersal service."
https://openalex.org/W212598358,"Psychopathy is a personality variable associated with persistent immoral behaviors. Despite this, attempts to link moral reasoning deficits to psychopathic traits have yielded mixed results with many findings supporting intact moral reasoning in individuals with psychopathic traits. Abundant evidence shows that psychopathy impairs responses to others’ emotional distress. However, most studies of morality and psychopathy focus on judgments about causing others physical harm. Results of such studies may be inconsistent because physical harm is an imperfect proxy for emotional distress. No previous paradigm has explicitly separated judgments about physical harm and emotional distress and assessed how psychopathy affects each type of judgment. In three studies we found that psychopathy impairs judgments about causing others emotional distress (specifically fear) but minimally affects judgments about causing physical harm and that judgments about causing fear predict instrumental aggression in psychopathy. These findings are consistent with reports linking psychopathy to insensitivity to others’ fear, and suggest that sensitivity to others’ fear may play a fundamental role in the types of moral decision-making impaired by psychopathy."
https://openalex.org/W2180099556,"We evaluated the biomass and contents of five major macronutrients (N, P, K, Ca and Mg) in 10-year-old poplar trees (Populus deltoids Bartr. cv. ""Lux""), and determined their nutrient use efficiencies (NUEs) at Zhoushan Forestry Farm (32°20' N, 119°40' E), Jiangsu province, in eastern China. The above- and below-ground biomass of poplar trees was 161.7 t ha(-1), of which 53.3% was stemwood. The nutrient contents in the aboveground part were as follows: 415.1 kg N ha(-1), 29.7 kg P ha(-1), 352.0 kg K ha(-1), 1083.0 kg Ca ha(-1), and 89.8 kg Mg ha(-1). The highest nutrient contents were in stembark, followed by branches, roots, stemwood, and foliage. The NUEs of the aboveground parts of poplar for N, P, K, Ca and Mg were 0.313, 4.377, 0.369, 0.120, 1.448 t dry biomass kg(-1) nutrient, respectively, while those of stemwood were 1.294, 33.154, 1.253, 0.667, and 3.328 t dry biomass kg(-1), respectively. The cycling coefficients, defined as the percentage of annual nutrient return in annual nutrient uptake, of N, P, K, Ca and Mg for the aboveground part were 87, 95, 69, 92, and 84%, respectively. Based on the NUE and nutrient cycling characteristics, shifting from whole-tree harvesting to stemwood-only harvesting and appropriately extending the harvest rotation could prevent site deterioration and support sustainable productivity of poplar plantation systems."
https://openalex.org/W575038200,"Respective and combined effects of impairments in sensorimotor systems and cognition on gait performance have not been fully studied. This study aims to describe the respective effects of impairments in muscle strength, distance vision, lower-limb proprioception and cognition on the Timed Up & Go (TUG) scores (i.e., performed TUG [pTUG], imagined TUG [iTUG] and the time difference between these two tests [delta TUG]) in older community-dwellers; and to examine their combined effects on TUG scores.Based on a cross-sectional design, 1792 community-dwellers (70.2 ± 4.8 years; 53.6% female) were recruited. Gait performance was assessed using pTUG, iTUG and delta TUG. Participants were divided into healthy individuals and 15 subgroups of individuals according to the presence of impairment in one or more subsystems involved in gait control (i.e., muscle strength and/or distance vision and/or lower-limb proprioception and/or cognition [episodic memory and executive performance]). Impairment in muscle strength, distance vision and lower-limb proprioception was defined as being in the lowest tertile of performance. Impairment in cognition was defined as abnormal episodic memory and executive tests.A total of 191 (10.7%) exhibited impairment in muscle strength, 188 (10.5%) in distance vision, 302 (16.9%) in lower-limb proprioception, and 42 (2.3%) in cognition. Linear regressions showed that cognitive impairment as well as dual combinations of impairments were associated with increased pTUG (P<0.02). Impairment in lower-limb proprioception was associated with decreased iTUG (P=0.015). All combinations of impairments, except those including muscle strength and the combinations of the 4 subsystems, were associated with increased delta TUG (P<0.04).Cognitive integrity is central for efficient gait control and stability, whereas lower-limb proprioception seems to be central for gait imagery."
https://openalex.org/W1689234104,"Background While formal reporting, surveillance, and response structures remain essential to protecting public health, a new generation of freely accessible, online, and real-time informatics tools for disease tracking are expanding the ability to raise earlier public awareness of emerging disease threats. The rationale for this study is to test the hypothesis that the HealthMap informatics tools can complement epidemiological data captured by traditional surveillance monitoring systems for meningitis due to Neisseria meningitides (N. meningitides) by highlighting severe transmissible disease activity and outbreaks in the United States. Methods Annual analyses of N. meningitides disease alerts captured by HealthMap were compared to epidemiological data captured by the Centers for Disease Control’s Active Bacterial Core surveillance (ABCs) for N. meningitides. Morbidity and mortality case reports were measured annually from 2010 to 2013 (HealthMap) and 2005 to 2012 (ABCs). Findings HealthMap N. meningitides monitoring captured 80-90% of alerts as diagnosed N. meningitides, 5-20% of alerts as suspected cases, and 5-10% of alerts as related news articles. HealthMap disease alert activity for emerging disease threats related to N. meningitides were in agreement with patterns identified historically using traditional surveillance systems. HealthMap’s strength lies in its ability to provide a cumulative “snapshot” of weak signals that allows for rapid dissemination of knowledge and earlier public awareness of potential outbreak status while formal testing and confirmation for specific serotypes is ongoing by public health authorities. Conclusions The underreporting of disease cases in internet-based data streaming makes inadequate any comparison to epidemiological trends illustrated by the more comprehensive ABCs network published by the Centers for Disease Control. However, the expected delays in compiling confirmatory reports by traditional surveillance systems (at the time of writing, ABCs data for 2013 is listed as being provisional) emphasize the helpfulness of real-time internet-based data streaming to quickly fill gaps including the visualization of modes of disease transmission in outbreaks for better resource and action planning. HealthMap can also contribute as an internet-based monitoring system to provide real-time channel for patients to report intervention-related failures."

We exploited a genetic selection using a dominant negative variant of the polymerase catalytic subunit that can effectively compete with wild-type Pol III α and form initiation complexes, but cannot elongate. Suppression of the dominant negative phenotype was achieved by secondary mutations that were ineffective in initiation complex formation. The corresponding proteins were purified and characterized.

We exploited this selection and identified several diverse mutations, spatially dispersed in three separate domains of Pol III α.

To prepare pJCL5, dnaE D403E was PCR amplified from pDFER.2 (34Pritchard A.E. McHenry C.S. Identification of the acidic residues in the active site of DNA polymerase III.J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1067-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) using primers JCL14 (5′-ATACCATGGCTGGTTGCCTGAAC) and JCL17 (5′-ATAGAATTCTTAGTCAAACTCCAG). The dnaE D403E fragment was digested with NcoI and EcoRI (3584 bp) and ligated into the NcoI and EcoRI sites of pBAD/HisA (3961 bp) creating pJCL3. A DNA fragment carrying the araC, pBAD promoter, and dnaE D403E was removed from pJCL3 with EcoRI and SphI (4898 bp) and ligated into pET29c cut with EcoRI and SphI (4967bp, carrying kanR, lacI, and both origins of replication) generating pJCL5. pJCL5-lacZα-T7 is identical to pJCL5 except that it contains a T7 promoter upstream of the pBAD promoter and lacZα downstream of the dnaE D403E (Fig. 1). Overlap PCR (35Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. A general method of in vitro preparation and specific mutagenesis of DNA fragments: study of protein and DNA interactions.Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2100) Google Scholar) was used to place the lacZα downstream of the dnaE D403E. Primers S7269 (5′-ACCTGATCAAGCGTCTACAACCT) and A9847 (5′-GTGTACACCTCCTTATTAGTCAAACTCCAGTTCCACC) were used to amplify a DNA fragment containing the 3′ end of dnaE D403E using pDFER.2 as a template (1645 bp). Primers S9833 (5′-TAAGGAGCTGTACACATATGACCATGATTACGCATTC) and A10047 (5′-GCGGCCGCTTATTAGCGCCATTCGCCATTCAGG) were used to amplify lacZα from E. coli MG1655 genomic DNA (210 bp). The overlap PCR fragment was generated using the outside primers S7269 and A10047 and the 1645- and 210-bp PCR fragments from above as templates. The resulting overlap PCR fragment (1842-bp fragment) was digested with BglII and NotI and ligated into the pJCL5 vector digested with BglII and NotI generating pJCL5-lacZα. The T7 promoter was placed upstream of the pBAD promoter in pJCL5-lacZα by overlap PCR. Primers S4843 (5′-GATCTCGACGCTCTCCCTTATGC) and AM2 (5′-TATAGTGAGTCGTATTACTTCTCTGAATGGCGGGAGT) were used to amplify the region upstream of the pBAD promoter using pJCL5 as template (1110 bp). The primers SM2 (5′-ATACGACTCACTATAGGGAAACCAATTGTCCATATTGCA) and A6276 (5′-AGCCATGGTTAATTCCTCCTGTTAGCC) were used to amplify the region downstream of the pBAD promoter using pJCL5 as template (339 bp). The overlap PCR fragment was generated using the outside primers S4843 and A6276 using the 1110- and 339-bp PCR fragments from above as templates. The resulting overlap PCR fragment was digested with SphI and BamHI (1.25 kb) and ligated into pJCL5-lacZα digested with SphI and BamHI (8.8 kb) to generate pJCL5-lacZα-T7. pJCL8 expresses dnaE D403E,A877E (sde8), from the T7 promoter. The sde8 mutation in pJCL8 was originally isolated from a genetic selection using the pJCL5 plasmid as the parental vector. The plasmid also contained an additional mutation (D792G) that was shown not involved in the suppression phenotype as separation of the D792G from the A877E did not alter the suppressor phenotype of A877E (data not shown). Consequently no further characterization of D792G was performed. To move the sde8 mutation into a clean T7 expression plasmid (away from D792G), overlap PCR was used to amplify dnaE D403E,A877E. Primers JCL42 (5′-TTTCTCGAGCTGATCCGCACC) and JCL44 (5′-ACGGTCAAACTCCCCGGACAT) plus JCL43 (5′-ATGTCCGGGGAGTTTGACCGT) and JCL41 (5′-CAAGAATTCTTAGTCAAACTCCAGTTCC) were used to amplify two PCR fragments from the pDFER.2 plasmid bearing the dnaE D403E mutation. The overlap PCR fragment was generated by using the outside primers JCL42 and JCL41 and using the 2171- and 815-bp fragments from above as templates. The resulting overlap PCR fragment (2966 bp) was digested with EcoRI and HindIII and ligated into pDFER.2 (EcoRI and HindIII sites) generating pJCL8. The pJCL21 plasmid expresses dnaE D403E,W1134C (sde50) from the T7 inducible promoter. The sde50 mutation in pJCL21 was originally isolated from a genetic selection using the pJCL5 plasmid as parental vector. To construct pJCL21, the pJCL5 plasmid harboring the sde50 mutation (dnaE D403E,W1134C) was digested with SphI/PstI plasmid to remove the pBAD promoter (1412 bp) and replaced with a DNA fragment bearing the T7 promoter from pET11.N0.1 (397 bp) generating pJCL21. The pJCL24 and pJCL25 plasmids express dnaE D403E,L1157Q (sde387) and dnaE D403E Δ881–927 (sde388) from the T7 inducible promoter, respectively. The sde387 and sde388 mutations in these plasmids were originally isolated from a genetic selection using pJCL5-lacZα-T7 plasmid as the parental vector. To construct pJCL24 and pJCL25, pJCL5-lacZα-T7 harboring either the sde387 or sde388 mutation was digested with SphI/PstI to remove the dual T7/pBAD promoter region (1432 bp), and replaced with a DNA fragment bearing the T7 promoter from pET11.N0.1 (397 bp) generating pJCL24 and pJCL25. The pJCL26 plasmid expresses the dnaE D403E,Q238K mutation (sde343) from the T7 promoter. The sde343 mutation in this plasmid was originally isolated from a genetic selection using the pJCL5-lacZα-T7 plasmid as the parental vector. In this case, the sde343 mutation was moved into the pET11.N0.1 expression vector by overlap PCR. The 5′ region of dnaE bearing the Q238K mutation was amplified using oligos JCL45 (5′-GGCCTGCAGAGCGAGCC) and JCL46 (5′-ACGCATATATTTCTGCGGCGA) using pDFER.2 as template. The region bearing the dnaE D403E mutation was amplified using oligos JCL47 (5′-TCGCCGCAGAAATATATGCGT) and JCL48 (5′-TACAGGCCTAACGTTTCACGTTCC). The overlap PCR fragment was generated using the outside primers JCL45 and JCL48 and using the 728- and 2176-bp PCR fragments from above as templates. The resulting overlap PCR fragment at 2884 bp was digested with StuI and PstI (2873 bp) and ligated into the StuI and PstI sites of pDFER.2 (7187 bp) generating pJCL26. The pET11.N0.1 plasmid fuses a His6 tag and a biotinylation sequence to the N terminus of the Pol III α subunit under control of the T7 promoter (22Kim D.R. McHenry C.S.

Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by using the QuikChange Lightning Multi Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent) using pET11.N0.1 as a template. For pET11.sde8, the WT sequence TCCGGGGCGTTTGACCGT was changed to TCCGGGGAGTTTGACCGT. For pET11.sde50, the WT sequence GCGACGTGGCGTGTC was changed to GCGACGTGCCGTGCT. For pET11.sde343, the WT sequence CCGCAGCAATATATGCGTAGC was changed to CCGCAGAAATATATGCGTAGC. For pET11.sde387, the WT sequence GTGGAACTGGAGTTT was changed to GTGGAACAGGAGTTT. For the pET11.sde388, the WT sequence GTGCTGGAA[AAACTGATCATG … TTCGGCGTGCTG]GCCGAAGAG was changed to GTGCTGGAA[Δ]GCCGAAGAG. All mutations were verified by sequencing. The selections to isolate suppressors of dnaE D403E using pJCL5 and pJCL5-lacZα-T7 plasmids were identical except that pJCL5-lacZα-T7 contains a lacZα reporter (Fig. 1). The plasmids were transformed into TOP10 or JCL60, respectively (Table 1: strains JCL52 and JCL68). The cells were grown to late-log phase in L-broth + 25 μg/ml of kanamycin and then plated onto LB + 25 μg/ml of kanamycin + 0.2% arabinose plates to induce the pBAD promoter. Eight independent selections were performed with pJCL5-lacZα-T7 and 11 with pJCL5 to identify spontaneous suppressors. All resultant colonies were patched onto LB + 25 μg/ml of kanamycin + 0.2% arabinose ± 40 μg/ml of X-Gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside), to provide a visual indication of promoter integrity and polar effects caused by poor dnaE expression (Fig. 1). In suppressor selections harboring the pJCL5-lacZα-T7 plasmid: white colonies indicated mutated genes that were not expressed, whereas blue colonies indicated an intact promoter and normal levels of dnaE expression. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 2 days. Spontaneous suppressors arose at an average frequency of 1.6 × 106 for strain JCL52 and at an average frequency of 1 × 105 for strain JCL68. To confirm the suppressor mutation was linked to the plasmid, the plasmid DNA was purified from each mutant using a Qiagen mini-prep kit, and the plasmid DNA was backcrossed into the parent strain (JCL60) and tested for its ability to suppress the dominant negative phenotype of dnaE D403E and expressed (blue when streaked on plates containing X-Gal) (Fig. 1). Immunoblots were performed on all plasmid-linked mutants to check for expression of full-length dnaE D403E, Sde protein (Fig. 1), 2 ml of cells were grown to late-log phase A600 = ∼0.8, and induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside in the presence of 20 μm d-biotin. 1 ml of cells were harvested by centrifugation, and lysed with 5 mg/ml of lysozyme on ice for 20 min, 1 min at 37 °C. A total of 40 μl of the soluble protein, isolated after centrifugation, was separated on a 4–20% SDS-PAGE gel and run next to full-length purified Pol III α as a marker. The SDS-PAGE gel was transferred to PVDF membrane, and incubated with a streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (GE Life Sciences) at a 1:1500 dilution in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to present visualization of the biotin tag. The immunoblot was developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence developer (GE Healthcare). All full-length intragenic suppressors were sequenced on both strands to identify mutations using the primers JCL37 (5′-CGACATCTTCGAAGC), JCL22 (5′-CTCAAAAGCGTATCAG), JCL24 (5′-CTGGAAGAGCGTCTG), JCL26 (5′-GGCAAACATCCGGTC), JCL28 (5′-GGTTACGGATTTAAC), and JCL30 (5′-CACCCTATCAACCAG). BL21(DE3) strains containing overexpression pET11.sde plasmids were grown in 3.0 liters of L-broth (1% (w/v) tryptone, 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract, 1% (w/v) NaCl) + 100 μg/ml of ampicillin at 23 °C at 220 rpm on a rotary shaker. It was necessary to express all mutants at 23 °C to avoid degradation and to maximize the amount of soluble protein. Cells were grown to A600 = 0.5 to 0.6 and induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. At the time of induction, d-biotin and additional ampicillin were added to 10 μm and 100 μg/ml, respectively. Cells were harvested by centrifugation 3 h after induction. Cells were lysed as described (34Pritchard A.E. McHenry C.S. Identification of the acidic residues in the active site of DNA polymerase III.J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1067-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) in the presence of 3 mg/ml of lysozyme, 5 mm benzamidine, 1 mm PMSF, and 5 mm EDTA (34Pritchard A.E. McHenry C.S.
