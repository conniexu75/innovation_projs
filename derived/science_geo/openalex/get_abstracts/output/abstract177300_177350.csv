https://openalex.org/W2126408606,"The macrophage scavenger receptor CD36 plays an important role in binding and uptake of oxidized forms of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), foam cell formation, and lesion development during atherosclerosis. The structural basis of CD36-lipoprotein ligand recognition is an area of intense interest. In a companion article we reported the characterization of a structurally conserved family of oxidized choline glycerophospholipids (oxPCCD36) that serve as novel high affinity ligands for cells stably transfected with CD36, mediating recognition of multiple oxidized forms of LDL (Podrez, E. A., Poliakov, E., Shen, Z., Zhang, R., Deng, Y., Sun, M., Finton, P., Shan, L., Gugiu, B., Fox, P. L., Hoff, H. F., Salomon, R. G., and Hazen, S. L. (July 8, 2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 10.1074/jbc.M203318200). Here we use macrophages from wild-type and CD36 null mice to demonstrate that CD36 is the major receptor on macrophages mediating recognition of oxPCCD36 species when presented (+/− plasma) in pure form, within PC bilayers in small unilamellar vesicles, and within liposomes generated from lipid extracts of native LDL. We also show that oxPCCD36 promote CD36-dependent recognition when present at only a few molecules per particle, resulting in macrophage binding, uptake, metabolism, cholesterol accumulation, and foam cell formation. Finally, using high performance liquid chromatography with on-line electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC/ESI/MS/MS), we demonstrate that oxPCCD36 are generated in vivo and are enriched in atherosclerotic lesions. Collectively, our data suggest that formation of this novel family of oxidized phospholipids participates in CD36-mediated recognition of oxidized lipoproteins and foam cell formation in vivo."

Mutation of a conserved serine (S104A) within the Keap1 BTB/POZ domain disrupts Keap1 dimerization and eliminates the ability of Keap1 to sequester Nrf2 in the cytoplasm and repress Nrf2 transactivation. Disruption of endogenous Keap1 dimerization using BTB/POZ dominant negative proteins also inhibits the ability of Keap1 to retain Nrf2 in the cytoplasm. Exposure to an electrophilic agent that induces Nrf2 release and nuclear translocation disrupts formation of a Keap1 complex in vivo. Collectively, these data support the conclusion that Keap1 dimerization is required for Nrf2 sequestration and transcriptional repression. Furthermore, exposure to inducing agents disrupts the Keap1 dimerization function and results in Nrf2 release.

Among the genes up-regulated are those encoding the phase II detoxification enzymes, such as NAD(P)H quinone reductase (NQO1), glutathione S-transferase, heme oxygenase-1, and epoxide hydrolyase as well as genes involved in cellular redox maintenance, including the catalytic (GCLC)1 and modulatory (GCLM) subunits of glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL). GCL catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step in the de novo synthesis of glutathione, a critical non-protein thiol involved in detoxification of xenobiotics, electrophiles, free radicals, and reactive oxygen species. Coordinate induction of many of the enzymes in this protective battery is transcriptionally mediated through antioxidant response elements (AREs) (also called electrophile response elements (EpREs)) present in the promoters of the respective genes (1Favreau L.V.

Antioxidant response elements share a common core sequence, 5′-(G/A)TGA(G/C)NNNGC(G/A)-3′, which bears a remarkable resemblance to Maf recognition elements (MAREs), originally identified as binding sites for the Cap'N′Collar protein NF-E2 within the promoter of the β-globin gene (6Igarashi K.

Biol. 1995; 15: 4640-4647Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). When dimerized with certain b-zip transcription factors, members of the Cap'N′Collar transcription factor family (NF-E2, Nrf1, Nrf2) are able to bind and transactivate ARE or ARE-like sequences. Although members of the small Maf family of proteins (Maf F, Maf G, and Maf K) as well as members of the Jun family (c-Jun, JunD) have been implicated as potential binding partners for Cap'N′Collar proteins, specific dimerization partners for Nrf2 in the context of AREs have not been clearly defined (8–21).Overexpression of Nrf2 up-regulates expression of ARE-containing genes, demonstrating that Nrf2 is a major determinant in the ARE-mediated induction of genes encoding several of the Phase II detoxification enzymes and both GCL subunits. Constitutive and induced expression of several ARE-containing genes, including glutathioneS-transferase, NQO1, GCLC, and GCLM are reduced in Nrf2 knock-out mice (22Aoki Y. Sato H. Nishimura N.

Nrf2 null mice are more susceptible to the carcinogenic effects of benzyo(a)pyrene than are wild-type mice and are less responsive to the chemoprotective effects of Oltipraz, a chemopreventive agent that functions in part via ARE induction (30Ramos-Gomez M. Kwak M.K. Dolan P.M. Itoh K. Yamamoto M. Talalay P. Kensler T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3410-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). By virtue of its central role in the transactivation of detoxification genes involved in cellular responses to oxidative or electrophilic stresses, Nrf2 activation is a critical target for cancer chemoprevention and other protective strategies (31Kwak M.K. Egner P.A. Dolan P.M. Ramos-Gomez M. Groopman J.D. Itoh K. Yamamoto M. Kensler T.W. Mutat. Res. 2001; 480–481: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 32Kensler T.W. Curphey T.J. Maxiutenko Y. Roebuck B.D. Drug Metabol. Drug Interact. 2000; 17: 3-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar).Attempts to identify Nrf2 binding partners by yeast two-hybrid screens resulted in the identification of Keap1, a homologue of theDrosophila Kelch protein (33Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2708) Google Scholar). Subsequent experiments demonstrated that Keap1 normally sequesters Nrf2 in the cytoplasm. After an oxidative/electrophilic stress or stimulus, Nrf2 is liberated from Keap1, whereupon it translocates to the nucleus and, in association with dimerization partners, binds ARE sequences to induce expression of the battery of genes that contribute to the protective response (33Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2708) Google Scholar). Although the nature of the molecular event(s) that signals dissociation of the Keap1·Nrf2 complex is unknown, it has been hypothesized that thiol modulation of one or more reactive cysteine(s) in Keap1 might result in a conformational change that releases Nrf2 (33Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2708) Google Scholar). Alternatively, other post-translational mechanisms such as phosphorylation of Nrf2 or Keap1 by kinases activated by oxidative or electrophilic stress might trigger Nrf2 release from Keap1.Members of the Kelch family, including Keap1, contain an N-terminal BTB/POZ domain and a series of 4–7 C-terminal Kelch repeats (34Albagli O.

BTB/POZ domains mediate protein dimerization, whereas Kelch repeats have been implicated in binding to the actin cytoskeleton and the formation of multi-protein complexes (35Soltysik-Espanola M.

An alignment of multiple BTB/POZ domains from various proteins with Keap1 revealed the presence of a highly conserved serine residue corresponding to Ser-104. Mutation of the homologous residue in the PLZF transcription factor (S56A) inhibited PLZF activity, suggesting the integrity of the BTB/POZ domain is critical to maintain protein function (41Ahmad K.F. Engel C.K. Prive G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12123-12128Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). We performed a similar mutational analysis of this conserved serine residue in Keap1 to determine the role of the BTB/POZ domain in Keap1 regulation of Nrf2. The Keap1-S104A mutant was deficient at homodimerization, failed to sequester Nrf2 in the cytoplasm, and was incapable of repressing Nrf2 transactivation of a GCLM-ARE reporter genein vivo. Wild-type Keap1 formed a high molecular weight complex when overexpressed in HepG2 cells, whereas the Keap1-S104A mutant was unable to form this complex. Exposure of transfected cells to the pro-oxidant pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (PDTC), disrupted formation of the high molecular weight complex. Collectively, the evidence suggests that the BTB/POZ dimerization function of Keap1 is required for Nrf2 cytoplasmic sequestration and that disruption of endogenous Keap1 dimers in vivo is involved in Nrf2 release.RESULTSThe conserved serine residue 104 in the Keap1 BTB domain was mutated to an alanine (Fig.1 A), and the ability of this Keap1-S104A mutant to repress Nrf2 transactivation of a GCLM/luciferase transgene was evaluated in HepG2 cells. The GCLM/luciferase transgene contains an ARE sequence previously shown to be responsible for mediating Nrf2 binding and gene induction (14Moinova H.R. Mulcahy R.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 661-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 18Wild A.C. Moinova H.R. Mulcahy R.T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 14683-14689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Co-transfection of the GCLM/luciferase reporter and pCIneo-Nrf2 into HepG2 cells resulted in an ∼10-fold increase in luciferase expression compared with cells co-transfected with GCLM/luciferase and an empty pCIneo vector (Fig. 1 B). Co-transfection of a wild-type Keap1 expression vector with pCIneo-Nrf2 reduced Nrf2 transactivation of the luciferase transgene by ∼80%. When the Keap1-S104A mutant cDNA was co-transfected with Nrf2, expression of the GCLM/luciferase reporter gene was significantly increased from that detected in HepG2 cells transfected with Nrf2 and wild-type Keap1 (p < 0.05). Wild-type and mutant FLAG-tagged Keap1 proteins were expressed to similar levels, suggesting that the functional alterations associated with the S104A mutation did not reflect differences in translation efficiency or protein stability (Fig. 1 C).To determine whether the Keap-S104A mutants altered Nrf2 localization, we monitored the distribution of a GFP-Nrf2 fusion protein in HepG2 cells co-transfected with cDNAs for wild-type or mutant Keap1. As expected, GFP fluorescence was concentrated in the nucleus in cells transfected with GFP-Nrf2 alone (Fig.2 A). In contrast, GFP-Nrf2 was distributed throughout the cytoplasm in cells co-transfected with GFP-Nrf2 and wild-type Keap1 (Fig.2 B). Interestingly, when Keap1-S104A was co-transfected with GFP-Nrf2, the fluorescent pattern was similar to that detected in cells transfected with GFP-Nrf2 alone (Fig. 2 C), indicating that the mutant protein was unable to sequester Nrf2 in the cytoplasm.Figure 2Mutation of S104A eliminates Keap1 sequestration of Nrf2 in the cytoplasm. HepG2 cells were grown on coverslips and transiently transfected with GFP-Nrf2 and pEF-Keap1 cDNAs as indicated. Transfected cells were fixed, permeabilized, stained with Hoescht #33342, and visualized as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)GFP-Nrf2 was also detected by Western analysis of nuclear extracts prepared from HepG2 cells transfected with GFP-Nrf2 alone (Fig. 3 A). The amount of GFP-Nrf2 detected in the nucleus of cells co-transfected with wild-type Keap1 was reduced, consistent with the results of the fluorescence localization studies (Fig. 2). However, when HepG2 cells were co-transfected with GFP-Nrf2 and the Keap1-S104A mutant, GFP-Nrf2 was detected in the nucleus at levels comparable with that observed in the nuclei of cells transfected with GFP-Nrf2 alone (Fig. 3 A).Figure 3Keap1-S104A does not retain GFP-Nrf2 in cytoplasm and exhibits decreased association with GFP-Nrf2. A, Keap1-S104A does not exclude GFP-Nrf2 from nucleus. HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with GFP-Nrf2 and pEF-Keap1 cDNAs, keeping the total amount of DNA transfected constant. Nuclear extracts were analyzed by Western blotting using a GFP-specific antibody. The membrane was stripped and re-probed with a histone antibody to determine equivalent loading of the nuclear extracts. B, Keap1-S104A exhibits decreased association with GFP-Nrf2 in vivo. HepG2 cells were transfected with GFP-Nrf2 and p3xFLAG-Keap1. Extracts were harvested, immunoprecipitated (IP) with GFP antibody, and analyzed by Western blotting (WB) with antibody specific for FLAG (top panel) or GFP (bottom panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The influence of the S104A mutation on Keap1·Nrf2 interaction was further examined by co-immunoprecipitation experiments using extracts prepared from cells co-transfected with vectors expressing GFP-Nrf2 and wild-type or mutant FLAG-tagged Keap1. The addition of the FLAG epitope to the N terminus of Keap1 did not alter the function of the wild-type protein in terms of its ability to bind and sequester Nrf2 (data not shown). Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with a GFP-specific antibody and analyzed for the presence of FLAG-tagged Keap1 by Western analysis. A single ∼66-kDa band corresponding to the FLAG-tagged Keap1 protein was detected in extracts from each experimental group. However, the intensity of the Keap1 band was reduced in cells transfected with the Keap1-S104A mutant relative to that detected in cells expressing wild-type Keap1 (Fig.3 B, top panel). Blotting for GFP revealed that similar levels of GFP-Nrf2 were immunoprecipitated in each group (Fig. 3 B, bottom panel).The subcellular localization of exogenous Keap1 in HepG2 cells transfected with the FLAG-tagged Keap1 expression vector was examined by confocal microscopy. Transfected cells were also stained with rhodamine-phalloidin to examine FLAG-Keap1 localization in relation to the actin cytoskeleton. Fig. 4illustrates that wild-type FLAG-Keap1 and the mutant FLAG-Keap1 protein co-localized with the actin cytoskeleton, indicating that the S104A mutation does not influence the relationship between Keap1 and actin.Figure 4Mutation of S104A does not affect co-localization with actin. HepG2 cells were grown on coverslips and transfected with FLAG-Keap1-wt and FLAG-Keap1-S104A. The cells were fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with anti-FLAG antibody as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells were incubated with rhodamine-phalloidin and analyzed by laser scanning confocal microscopy.

Ahmad K.F. Arai S. Polinger A. Ball H. Borden K.L. Carlile G.W. Prive G.G. Licht J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6550-6567Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 44Li X. Peng H. Schultz D.C. Lopez-Guisa J.M. Rauscher III, F.J. Marmorstein R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5275-5282PubMed Google Scholar). Because the BTB/POZ domain has been shown to be an obligate dimerization motif (34Albagli O. Dhordain P. Deweindt C. Lecocq G. Leprince D. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1193-1198PubMed Google Scholar, 40Bardwell V.J. Treisman R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1664-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the functional defects associated with the S104A mutation reflect alterations in the dimerization function of the Keap1 BTB/POZ domain. To test this hypothesis, the ability of Keap1 to form homodimers was examined using wild-type and mutant Keap1 proteins translated in vitro. FLAG-tagged and untagged Keap1 proteins migrated differently on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, permitting easy discrimination of tagged and untagged protein (Fig. 5 B,lanes 1 and 2). As expected, when untagged Keap1 proteins were incubated with the anti-FLAG antibody, very little Keap1 was detected in the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 5 A, lanes 2 and 4). In contrast, FLAG-tagged Keap1 proteins were specifically recognized and immunoprecipitated upon incubation with the anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 5 A, lanes 6 and8). Consequently, the presence of any untagged Keap1 protein in immunoprecipitates derived from mixtures of the two proteins is indicative of an association between FLAG-tagged and untagged Keap1 proteins.When a mixture of tagged and untagged Keap1-wt proteins (lane 3, Fig. 5 B) was immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG antibody, both tagged and untagged Keap1 proteins were detected in the precipitate (lane 4, Fig. 5 B). In contrast, when tagged and untagged Keap1-S104A mutants were co-translated and then immunoprecipitated with the FLAG antibody, very little untagged Keap-S104A was co-precipitated (lane 6 versus lane 4, Fig. 5 B). These results suggest that the S104A mutation decreases the efficiency of Keap1 dimerization. Similar dimerization deficiency was detected between untagged Keap1-S104A and wild-type FLAG-Keap1 (lane 7 versus lane 8). The wild-type Keap1 protein formed two complexes when the proteins were separated on native gels (Fig. 5 C), and this property was not altered by fusion of the FLAG tag to Keap1. However, only the faster migrating complex was detected in preparations ofin vitro translated S104A Keap1 protein, suggesting that mutation of the BTB/POZ domain impairs higher order complex formation.The correlation between inefficient dimerization and loss of Nrf2 sequestration observed with Keap1-S104A mutants suggested that the ability of Keap1 to dimerize might be an essential element in Nrf2 sequestration. To evaluate whether Keap1 dimerization might be involved in Nrf2 regulation in vivo, we transfected HepG2 cells with FLAG-Keap1 expression vectors. The transfected cells were then exposed to PDTC, an agent known to induce Nrf2 nuclear localization and ARE transactivation (18Wild A.C. Moinova H.R. Mulcahy R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33627-33636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 45Zipper L.M. Mulcahy R.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 484-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). After PDTC exposure, the cells were harvested and divided equally for Western blot analysis under native (Fig.6 A) and denaturing conditions (Fig. 6 B).Figure 6FLAG-Keap1 complex formation is disrupted when HepG2 cells are exposed to PDTC independent of Erk and p38 activation. HepG2 cells were transfected with FLAG-Keap-wt or FLAG-Keap–S104A and exposed to 100 μm PDTC for 3 h. Half of the cells were lysed under non-denaturing conditions and analyzed by non-denaturing Western blotting with FLAG antibody (A), and the remaining half of the transfected cells were lysed in 4× SDS sample buffer and analyzed by denaturing Western blotting using FLAG and α-tubulin antibodies (B). The proteins that were not solubilized by non-denaturing extraction buffer were solubilized in 4× SDS sample buffer and analyzed by denaturing Western blotting using antibodies to FLAG and α-tubulin (C). HepG2 cells were transfected with FLAG-Keap1-wt and pre-treated with 25 μm PD98059 or SB202190 before exposure to 100 μm PDTC for 3 h. Half of the cells were analyzed by non-denaturing Western blotting using FLAG antibody (D), and the remaining half were analyzed by denaturing Western blotting using FLAG antibody (E) and phospho-specific Erk antibody (F).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Under non-denaturing conditions, a prominent band was detected in extracts collected from cells overexpressing the FLAG-Keap1-wt protein. The migration of the FLAG-Keap1 complex in vivo was similar to the pattern observed in vitro, suggesting the complex represents FLAG-Keap1 dimer formation (data not shown). PDTC treatment caused a decrease in the intensity of this band (Fig. 6 A). Exposure to phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), another ARE-inducing agent, also decreased the intensity of the Keap1 complex (data not shown), suggesting multiple oxidative/electrophilic agents are capable of disrupting Keap1 dimerization in vivo. In HepG2 cells expressing the FLAG-Keap1-S104A mutant protein, formation of the Keap1-containing complex was greatly reduced, consistent with the deficiency of Keap1-S104A homodimer formation detected in vitro (Fig. 5 B).Neither PDTC treatment nor overexpression of the Keap1-S104A mutant protein was accompanied by a corresponding appearance of any other Keap1-containing bands on the non-denaturing gels even though equivalent amounts of FLAG-Keap1 were detected in each group by Western analysis on SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 6 B). In an attempt to account for the difference, the insoluble material remaining after the native protein extraction (i.e. from Fig. 6 A) was subsequently denatured and analyzed by Western blotting with the anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 6 C). FLAG-tagged Keap1 was detected in extracts from each group, but the level detected in the extracts from PDTC-treated groups was consistently higher than that detected in extracts from untreated controls, suggesting that oxidant exposure alters Keap1 conformation, rendering the complex less soluble in the native extraction buffer.Our previous work demonstrated that PDTC induction of GCLM requires activation of both Erk and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways prior to Nrf2 binding at the ARE sequence (45Zipper L.M. Mulcahy R.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 484-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). To investigate the involvement of both Erk and p38 in the formation and disruption of the Keap1 complex in vivo, HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with FLAG-tagged wild-type Keap1. The cells were then incubated with either the Erk pathway inhibitor, PD98059, or the p38 inhibitor, SB202190, before PDTC exposure. The effect of Erk and p38 inhibition on the formation or disruption of the FLAG-Keap1-containing complex was monitored by non-denaturing Western blot analysis as just described. Although PD98059 effectively inhibited Erk2 activation (Fig. 6 F), disruption of the Keap1-containing complex after PDTC exposure was unaltered (Fig.6 D). Similarly, exposure of transfected cells to 25 μm SB202190 (a dose previously shown to decrease Nrf2 binding to the GCLM ARE sequence (45Zipper L.M. Mulcahy R.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 484-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar)) did not effect Keap1 complex disruption by PDTC exposure, indicating that PDTC dissociation of the Keap1 complex in vivo occurs via an Erk2-and p38-independent mechanism.Collectively, the data suggest that Keap1 dimerization is required for Keap1·Nrf2 association. If correct, then disruption of the dimerization potential of endogenous Keap1 in vivo would be expected to result in Nrf2 liberation and increased expression of the Nrf2-responsive GCLM/luciferase reporter gene. To test this hypothesis, we generated truncated Keap1 proteins (amino acids 1–247) by deleting the C-terminal Kelch repeat domains from the corresponding Keap1-wt and Keap1-S104A proteins to generate BTB/POZ-wt and BTB/POZ-S104A. Both in vitro translated BTB/POZ proteins migrated on denaturing polyacrylamide gels with an apparent molecular mass of ∼30 kDa (Fig. 7 A). However, bands corresponding to BTB/POZ dimers were only detected on native gels with the dimerization-proficient BTB/POZ-wt proteins. Like their full-length counterparts, the BTB/POZ-S104A proteins failed to dimerize in vitro (Fig. 7 B).Figure 7Overexpression of truncated Keap1 BTB/POZ-containing proteins disrupts endogenous Keap1·Nrf2 interaction. cDNAs encoding only the first 247 amino acids were generated for Keap1-wt and Keap1-S104A as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The BTB/POZ peptides were translatedin vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine and separated on denaturing polyacrylamide gels (A) or non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels (B). C, HepG2 cells were co-transfected with GCLM luciferase transgene and 50 ng of pCIneo, full-length Keap-wt, BTB/POZ-wt, or BTB/POZ-S104A as indicated in the figure. Luciferase activity is reported as the mean ± S.E. of five determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The cDNA for each truncated protein was co-transfected into HepG2 cells along with the GCLM/luciferase reporter transgene. Transfection of a full-length wt-Keap1 cDNA inhibited expression of the reporter gene as shown previously (33Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2708) Google Scholar). Transfection of the BTB/POZ-wt expression vector resulted in a significant increase (p= 0.02) in reporter gene expression, indicative of the release of endogenous Nrf2 (i.e. they function as dominant negatives) (Fig. 7 C). Luciferase expression was not influenced by transfection of the dimerization-deficient BTB/POZ-S104A mutant.DISCUSSIONRecent studies demonstrate that Nrf2, a member of the Cap'N′Collar family of transcription factors, plays a central role in the basal expression and ARE-dependent induction of a battery of detoxification and antioxidant enzymes, including NQO1, glutathione S-transferase, GCLM, and GCLC (24Chan J.Y.

https://openalex.org/W2007057348,"Adult bone marrow (BM) contains cells capable of differentiating along hematopoietic (Lin(+)) or non-hematopoietic (Lin(-)) lineages. Lin(-) hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have recently been shown to contain a population of endothelial precursor cells (EPCs) capable of forming blood vessels. Here we show that intravitreally injected Lin(-) BM cells selectively target retinal astrocytes, cells that serve as a template for both developmental and injury-associated retinal angiogenesis. When Lin(-) BM cells were injected into neonatal mouse eyes, they extensively and stably incorporated into forming retinal vasculature. When EPC-enriched HSCs were injected into the eyes of neonatal rd/rd mice, whose vasculature ordinarily degenerates with age, they rescued and maintained a normal vasculature. In contrast, normal retinal angiogenesis was inhibited when EPCs expressing a potent angiostatic protein were injected. We have demonstrated that Lin(-) BM cells and astrocytes specifically interact with one another during normal angiogenesis and pathological vascular degeneration in the retina. Selective targeting with Lin(-) HSC may be a useful therapeutic approach for the treatment of many ocular diseases."

Despite its ubiquitous expression, mutant α-synuclein primarily leads to the loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra. α-Synuclein is a presynaptic nerve terminal protein of unknown function, although several studies suggest it is important for synaptic plasticity and maintenance. The present study utilized a new human mesencephalic cell line, MESC2.10, to study the effect of A53T mutant α-synuclein on dopamine homeostasis. In addition to expressing markers of mature dopamine neurons, differentiated MESC2.10 cells are electrically active, produce dopamine, and express wild-type human α-synuclein. Lentivirus-induced overexpression of A53T mutant α-synuclein in differentiated MESC2.10 cells resulted in down-regulation of the vesicular dopamine transporter (VMAT2), decreased potassium-induced and increased amphetamine-induced dopamine release, enhanced cytoplasmic dopamine immunofluorescence, and increased intracellular levels of superoxide. These results suggest that mutant α-synuclein leads to an impairment in vesicular dopamine storage and consequent accumulation of dopamine in the cytosol, a pathogenic mechanism that underlies the toxicity of the psychostimulant amphetamine and the parkinsonian neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium. Interestingly, cells expressing A53T mutant α-synuclein were resistant to amphetamine-induced toxicity. Because extravesicular, cytoplasmic dopamine can be easily oxidized into reactive oxygen species and other toxic metabolites, mutations in α-synuclein might lead to Parkinson's disease by triggering protracted, low grade dopamine toxicity resulting in terminal degeneration and ultimately cell death.

Even though oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction have been implicated in the disease process, the mechanisms underlying nigral cell death in PD are still unknown (3Schapira A.H. Adv. Neurol. 2001; 86: 155-162PubMed Google Scholar). Most cases of PD are sporadic, but rare, familial forms of the disease do exist. To date, early-onset PD has been linked to mutations in two genes, α-synuclein and parkin(4Gasser T. J. Neurol. 2001; 248: 833-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Autosomal dominant forms of the disease result from missense mutations in α-synuclein, leading to either an alanine to threonine substitution at position 53 (A53T) (5Polymeropoulos M.H. Lavedan C.

Przuntek H. Epplen J.T. Schols L. Riess O. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 106-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3279) Google Scholar). Although these mutations are not present in the majority of patients with familial PD, pathogenic mechanisms involved in α-synuclein-mediated DA cell loss may provide important clues about sporadic and familial forms of the disease. First identified as a component of cholinergic vesicles in the electric ray Torpedo californica (7Maroteaux L. Campanelli J.T. Scheller R.H. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 2804-2815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), α-synuclein is a highly conserved, “natively unfolded,” 140-amino acid phosphoprotein belonging to a family of closely related members (8Goedert M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 492-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). The function of α-synuclein is still unknown, although several studies suggest it plays an important role in synapse maturation and maintenance. α-Synuclein is enriched in presynaptic terminals (9Maroteaux L.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6365-6373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is expressed rather ubiquitously in the brain, particularly in the neocortex, hippocampus, striatum, thalamus, and cerebellum (12Iwai A.

Its expression is developmentally regulated, redistributing from neuronal cell bodies to synaptic terminals during periods of neuronal differentiation (13Shibayama-Imazu T. Okahashi I. Omata K.

Lastly, overexpression of A53T mutant human α-synuclein in mice results in massive axonal degeneration of spinal cord motor neurons (15van der Putten H. Wiederhold K.H. Probst A. Barbieri S. Mistl C.

If α-synuclein plays an essential role in synaptic function, why do its mutant forms primarily lead to the degeneration of nigral DA neurons? This phenomenon could be explained by the cytotoxic potential of DA, a neurotransmitter that readily auto-oxidizes in the presence of iron and can also be metabolically deaminated to yield toxic DA metabolites and reactive oxygen species (ROS), e.g.superoxide anions and hydroxyl radicals (18Graham D.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1978; 14: 633-643PubMed Google Scholar, 19Maker H.S. Weiss C. Silides D.J. Cohen G. J. Neurochem. 1981; 36: 589-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 20Fornsted B. Acta Neurol. Scand. Suppl. 1990; 129: 12-14PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, a failure to properly store DA into synaptic vesicles may lead to abnormal elevations of cytosolic DA followed by generation of cytotoxic DA metabolites and ROS. This could, in turn, lead to oxidative stress, terminal degeneration, and eventually cell death. The present study examined the possibility that expression of A53T mutant α-synuclein leads to DA cell loss by promoting DA-dependent oxidative stress, a mechanism that has been proposed to underlie the toxicity of both amphetamine and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) (21Cubells J.F. Rayport S. Rajendran G. Sulzer D. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 2260-2271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Lotharius J. O'Malley K.L. J. Biol.

To test the hypothesis that mutant α-synuclein alters DA homeostasis, we first characterized a new human mesencephalic cell line, MESC2.10, and determined it to be a useful model system for studying the function of α-synuclein. In addition to expressing biochemical markers of mature DA neurons, MESC2.10 cells are electrically active, synthesize and release DA, and express wild-type (WT) human α-synuclein. Interestingly, lentiviral-induced expression of A53T mutant in MESC2.10 cells led to changes in DAT and VMAT2 protein levels, DA uptake and release, cytoplasmic DA immunofluorescence, intracellular superoxide production, formation of α-synuclein-positive inclusions, and response to amphetamine (AMPH)-induced toxicity, modifications that suggest alterations in DA function. Human mesencephalic cells were prepared from 8-week-old human embryonic ventral mesencephalic tissue (Lund University), which was procured in compliance with national laws and regulations, following permission from the Lund University Hospital Ethical Committee. Tissue fragments were maintained at 4 °C for ∼72 h in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) without calcium and magnesium prior to mechanical dissociation in the presence of 3 mg/ml protease 23. Dispersed cells were then rinsed with HBSS containing 1 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin prior to plating. Cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 104 cells/cm2 in growth medium consisting of DMEM/F-12 and 10% fetal calf serum. Approximately 24 h later, the growth medium was replaced with DMEM/F-12 containing N2 supplement (Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD), 40 ng/ml human recombinant basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN), 40 ng/ml human recombinant epidermal growth factor (EGF, Invitrogen), and 20 ng/ml platelet-derived growth factor A/B (PDGF, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). Human mesencephalic cells were immortalized with a LINX v-myc retroviral vector (24Hoshimaru M. Ray J. Sah D.W. Gage F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1518-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In this system, a tetracycline-controlled transactivator strongly activates transcription from a minimal CMV promoter, which, in turn, drives v-myc expression in the absence of tetracycline. A gene conferring neomycin resistance is also present in the vector allowing selection of v-myc-expressing cells. Mesencephalic cultures were retrovirally infected and G418-selected as previously described (25Sah D.W. Ray J. Gage F.H. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 574-580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After selection, cultures were maintained in N2 medium consisting of DMEM/F-12 high glucose, N2 supplement, 2 mml-glutamine, 40 ng/ml bFGF, 40 ng/ml EGF, and 20 ng/ml PDGF. Confluent cultures were passaged by trypsin digestion. Clonal cell lines were isolated by two rounds of limited dilution in 96-well plates. Single colonies were expanded and passaged. MESC2.10 cells were propagated in N2 medium containing 40 ng/ml bFGF. After reaching confluency, cells were enzymatically dissociated with trypsin followed by trituration. Poly-d-lysine (PDL) pre-coated labware was treated overnight with 5 μg/ml mouse laminin (dissolved in PBS with Ca2+) and washed three times prior to plating. Cells were seeded at a density of 2.5 × 104 cells/well in 8-well chamber slides, 7.5 × 104 cells/well in 24-well plates, or 2.0 × 105 cells/well in 12-well plates depending on the assay conducted. One day after plating, proliferation medium was replaced with N2 medium containing 1 μg/ml tetracycline, 1 mm dibutyryl cyclic AMP (db-cAMP), and 2 ng/ml glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), heretofore called differentiation medium. Half of this medium was replaced every second day. Clone MESC2.10 was chosen for further characterization, because a high percentage of cells from this line expressed both microtubule-associated protein 2 and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). MESC2.10 cells were plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells per PDL/laminin-coated P100 dish, allowed to become confluent, and differentiated for 0, 2, 4, or 6 days. Day 0 cells were lysed the same day that differentiation medium was added to prospective day 2–6 dishes. Briefly, cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in hypotonic buffer containing 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.6, 2 mm Hepes, 12 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and protease inhibitors (Sigma mixture). Cells were homogenized by passing them five to six times through a 27-gauge needle. After centrifuging at 800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was collected and SDS was added to 1% final concentration. An equal volume of 50 μg of protein (as measured with a Bio-Rad DC protein assay) from day 0–6 samples was heated for 10 min at 55 °C in the presence of Laemmli buffer containing 4% β-mercaptoethanol. Proteins were separated on a 10–20% continuous gradient SDS-PAGE gel and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Blots were blocked in 5% nonfat milk/PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated overnight at 4 °C in blocking buffer containing the following primary antibodies: mouse anti-rat TH (1:1000, Chemicon International, Temecula, CA), mouse anti-human β-tubulin isotype III (1:2000, Sigma), mouse anti-human α-synuclein (1:100, Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego, CA), rabbit anti-human vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2, 1:500, kind gift from Dr. Robert Edwards), rabbit anti-human DA transporter (DAT before dilution, 1:1000, Alpha Diagnostic International), rabbit anti-cow glial fibrillary acidic protein (before dilution 1:2000, DAKO A/S, Glostrup, Denmark), and rabbit anti-human myc (1:1000, Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY). After washing 3× for 10 min in PBS/Tween 20, blots were incubated with 1:5000 horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies (from donkey, in blocking buffer) recognizing mouse or rabbit species followed by detection using an ECL Plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). Day 4 MESC2.10 cells transduced for 48 h with LV-GFP or LV-A53TSYN were lysed as previously described, and immunoblots were probed with antibodies against α-synuclein, DAT, VMAT2, and TH, rabbit anti-human Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD, 1:3000, StressGen Biotechnology Corp., Victoria, British Columbia, Canada), and mouse anti-rabbit glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (1:300, Chemicon International). Band intensity was quantified using IMAGE software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Electrical activity was measured using the perforated whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp technique, using an EPC-9 amplifier and Pulse software (version 8.50 or later, Heka Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany). Recording electrodes were made from borosilicate glass capillaries coated with Sylgard close to the tips and fire-polished. The pipette resistance ranged between 3 and 6 megohms when filled with the intracellular solution specified above. The zero-current potential of the pipette was adjusted in the bath prior to gigaseal formation. Cells were continuously superfused with extracellular solution consisting of (in mm) 138 NaCl, 5.6 KCl, 1.2 MgCl2, 2.6 CaCl2, 25d-glucose, and 5 Hepes (pH 7.4 with NaOH) at 32–34 °C. The pipette solution contained (in mm) 76 K2SO4, 10 NaCl, 10 KCl, 1 MgCl2, and 5 HEPES (pH 7.35 with KOH), and 0.24 mg/ml of the pore-forming antibiotic amphotericin B (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO). MESC2.10 cells were plated at a density of 2 × 105/well in PDL/laminin-coated 12-well plates. After 24 h, cells were exposed to differentiation medium for 0–6 days, lysed in 200 μl of 0.1n perchloric acid containing 0.8 mg/ml glutathione by freeze/thawing, and the supernatants were collected for analysis of intracellular DA levels. Samples from day 0, 2, 4, and 6 cultures were frozen at −80 °C and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrochemical detection (HPLC-EC). For assays of DA release, day 6 MESC2.10 cells were treated with 60 mm KCl or 50 μm AMPH for 20 min at 37 °C in 300 μl of HBSS containing Ca2+ and 0.8 mg/ml glutathione. The extracellular medium was collected and filtered through a 0.2-μm filter. A sample volume of 30 μl was injected into an ESA Coulochem II electrochemical detector using a YMCaqua C18 column (Schermbeck, Germany) set at a potential of 300 mV versus an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The mobile phase was delivered by an LC 10 AD Shimadzu HPLC pump at 0.5 ml/min and contained 0.051 mNaH2PO4·H2O with 0.92 mm octanesulfonic acid, 48 μmNa2EDTA, and 11% methanol, adjusted to pH 3.7 with 1m phosphoric acid and degassed. Data was acquired using a Shimadzu (chromatographic CLASS LC-10) software package. The analyses were calibrated to a standard of 0.2 μm DA. Assays were conducted in triplicate and experiments repeated three times. Mutant (A53T) human α-synuclein (A53TSYN) was isolated from an adeno-associated virus, rAAV-A53TSYN (kindly provided by Nina Rosenqvist, Lund University, Lund, Sweden), by PCR amplification using the following oligonucleotides: 5′-GTC AAG ATC TAT GGA TGT ATT CAT GAA AGG ACT-3′ and 5′-AGT CCT CGA GTT AGG CTT CAG GTT CGT AGT-3′. The pHR′CMV-A53TSYN-WHV construct was generated by ligating this PCR product with a lentiviral backbone obtained by excising GFP from pHR′CMV-GFP-WHV (kindly provided by Dr. Didier Trono, University of Geneva Medical School, Geneva, Switzerland) using BamHI andXhoI. These restriction sites were introduced into the flanking sequences of A53TSYN by PCR. The construct was sequenced at the Center for Genomics Research, Karolinska Institute (Stockholm, Sweden) to ensure that no PCR-based mutations were generated. Lentiviral vectors were produced as previously described (26Zufferey R. Nagy D. Mandel R.J. Naldini L. Trono D. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 871-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (1555) Google Scholar, 27Ericson C. Wictorin K. Lundberg C. Exp. Neurol. 2002; 173: 22-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, 293T cells were transiently transfected by a calcium phosphatase method with a three-plasmid vector system consisting of: pHR′CMV-GFP-WHV or pHR′CMV-A53TSYN-WHR (transducing vector containing the transgene), pMD.G (vector encoding the envelope protein), and pCMVΔR8.91 (packaging construct providing all viral proteins needed except for the envelope). All constructs were kindly provided by Dr. D. Trono. The supernatant was collected 2 and 3 days after transfection and ultracentrifuged at 141,000 ×g for 1.5 h. The pellet was resuspended in DMEM/10% FCS and frozen at −80 °C. The virus titer was determined by infecting 293T cells with serial dilutions of virus and counting the number of GFP or α-synuclein-positive cells (as assessed by immunocytochemistry). Untransduced 293T cells did not express α-synuclein. The dilution resulting in <30% of GFP or α-synuclein-positive cells was used to calculate transducing units/cell. A multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) = 10, corresponding to 10 transducing units/cell, was used at all times to infect MESC2.10 cells. MESC2.10 cells were plated at a density of 7.5 × 104cells/well in PDL/laminin-coated 24-well plates and transduced for 48 h with LV-GFP or LV-A53TSYN starting on day 4. On day 6, cells were rinsed with HBSS containing Ca2+ and incubated with 4.8 μCi/ml [7,8-3H]DA/HBSS + Ca2+ (AmershamBiosciences, Piscataway, NJ) for 20 min at 37 °C. To measure intracellular [3H]DA, the supernatant was removed and cells were lysed with 0.1 n perchloric acid by freeze/thawing. To measure basal [3H]DA release, [3H]DA-loaded cells were rinsed extensively with HBSS, and the supernatant was analyzed. For stimulation-induced [3H]DA release, cells were treated with 60 mmKCl or 50 μm AMPH for 20 min at 37 °C and extracellular [3H]DA measured. All samples were analyzed with a 1214 Rackbeta liquid scintillation counter (LKB Wallac, Turku, Finland). Experiments were conducted in quadruplicate and repeated three times. For DA antibody experiments, day 4 MESC2.10 cells were transduced with LV-GFP or LV-A53TSYN for 48 h and exposed on day 6 to 50 μm AMPH for 20, 40, or 60 min at 37 °C. After fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde, cells were rinsed in PBS and preincubated with 5% normal goat serum/0.3% Triton-X/PBS for 1 h at room temperature. The following primary antibodies (in Triton X-100/PBS) were then added overnight at 4 °C: mouse anti-human β-tubulin isotype III (1:2000, Sigma, St. Louis, MO), rabbit anti-rat TH (1:100, Pel-Freeze, Rogers, AR), mouse anti-human α-synuclein (1:1000, Zymed Laboratories, San Francisco, CA), rabbit anti-DAT (1:500, Alpha Diagnostic International, San Antonio, TX), and mouse anti-DA (1:500, Fitzgerald, Concord, MA). After rinsing 3× in PBS, cells were incubated in either goat anti-rabbit Alexa 594 or goat anti-mouse Alexa 488 for 1 h at room temperature, rinsed in PBS, and cover-slipped in PVA-DABCO. In some cases, cells were incubated in 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 during the second to last wash before mounting. For assessment of α-synuclein-positive inclusions, day 6 MESC2.10 cells overexpressing GFP or A53TSYN were stained with a mouse anti-human α-synuclein antibody (see above). Cells were examined with a Bio-Rad MRC1024 confocal microscope using a 100× objective. For DA antibody experiments, the mean cytoplasmic florescence intensity from ≥50 cells per experiment was quantified using Bio-Rad LaserSharp software (Hercules, CA). Production of ROS was monitored in MESC2.10 cells overexpressing GFP or A53TSYN exposed to AMPH using the superoxide-sensitive fluorophore dihydroethidium (DHE) as previously described (22Lotharius J. O'Malley K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38581-38588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 23Lotharius J. O'Malley K.L. Ann.

MESC2.10 cells were plated at a density of 2.5 × 104 cells/well in PDL/laminin-coated eight-well chamber slides and differentiated for 4 days. Cells were then transduced with LV-GFP or LV-A53TSYN for 48 h. On day 6 transduced MESC2.10 cells were exposed to 50 μm AMPH for 60 min or 2 h followed by 20-min incubation with 3 μm DHE at 37 °C. Cells were then fixed with 4% paraformal dehyde and mounted. Fluorescence was measured at excitation = 488 nm and emission = 590 nm on a Bio-Rad MRC1024 confocal microscope using a 60× objective. The mean cytoplasmic fluorescence from ≥50 cells/experiment was quantified using LaserSharp software. Experiments were repeated three to five times. MESC2.10 cells were plated at a density of 2.5 × 104cells/well in PDL/laminin-coated eight-well chamber slides and differentiated for 3 days. On day 3, cells were transduced with LV-GFP or LV-A53TSYN for 24 h and then exposed to 10, 50, or 100 μm AMPH for 48 h. On day 6, cells were incubated with 5 μm Calcein-AM for 20 min at 37 °C. Five consecutive images per well were captured with a BMK 800 digital camera (Grundig Electronic, Nürnberg, Germany) using a 10× objective. Calcein-AM-positive cells were counted and normalized to LV-GFP control cultures. Experiments were conducted in duplicate and repeated three to five times. All parameters are expressed as means ± S.E. of three to five independent experiments, each treatment performed in three to four wells. The significance of effects between untreated and treated, or between LV-GFP- and LV-A53TSYN-expressing, cells, was determined by one- or two-way factor analysis of variance (ANOVA), as indicated, and post-hoc Dunnett's t test using a Statview package (Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, CA). Eight-week-old human embryonic mesencephalic cells were immortalized with a retroviral vector containing the v-myconcogene (Fig. 1) (29Raymon H.K. Barrere C. Thompson D. Zhou J. Yamashita M.M. Thode S. Friedman G.C. Sah D.W. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1999; Google Scholar). In brief, the control elements of a tetracycline-resistance operon were fused to a human CMV promoter directing the expression of v-myc (24Hoshimaru M. Ray J. Sah D.W. Gage F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1518-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In this system, addition of low, non-toxic concentrations of tetracycline abolish transcription activation by a tetracycline-controlled transactivator thus blocking v-myc expression (29Raymon H.K. Barrere C. Thompson D. Zhou J. Yamashita M.M. Thode S. Friedman G.C. Sah D.W. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1999; Google Scholar). Constitutive expression of v-myc in the absence of tetracycline enabled MESC2.10 cells to proliferate continuously in culture. Addition of tetracycline in the presence of GDNF, a factor that promotes the survival and morphological differentiation of DA neurons (30Lin L.F. Doherty D.H. Lile J.D. Bektesh S. Collins F. Science. 1993; 260: 1130-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2840) Google Scholar), and dibutyryl cyclic AMP (db-cAMP), a known inducer of TH activity (31Waymire J.C. Weiner N. Prasad K.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 2241-2245Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), arrested proliferation and promoted the differentiation of MESC2.10 cells. After 6 days in differentiation medium, a high percentage of MESC2.10 cells expressed both the microtubule-associated protein 2 and the rate-limiting enzyme in dopamine biosynthesis, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) (29Raymon H.K. Barrere C. Thompson D. Zhou J. Yamashita M.M. Thode S. Friedman G.C. Sah D.W. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1999; Google Scholar). Therefore, this clone was chosen for further characterization. To determine which cell types were present in differentiated MESC2.10 cultures, the expression of various neuronal, astrocytic, and DA markers was assessed by Western immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry. Because microtubules play an essential role in neurite outgrowth, synapse formation, and axonal and dendritic transport, β-tubulin is often used as a marker of immature and mature neurons (31Waymire J.C. Weiner N. Prasad K.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 2241-2245Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 32Fanarraga M.L. Avila J. Zabala J.C. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Immunoreactivity for β-tubulin isotype III was faintly present in lysates from undifferentiated MESC2.10 cultures and was up-regulated when cells were exposed to differentiation medium, reaching robust levels at days 4 and 6 (Fig.2 A). Similarly, day 6 cultures immunoprocessed with an antibody against β-III-tubulin exhibited long, branched processes characteristic of mature neurons. Double staining with the nuclear marker Hoechst 33258 showed that at least 80% of Day 6 cells were neurons (Fig. 2 B). On the other hand, the astrocytic marker glial fibrillary acidic protein was modestly expressed in undifferentiated MESC2.10 cultures and was down-regulated in response to differentiation (Fig. 2 A). Like β-III-tubulin, expression of α-synuclein was barely detected at day 0 by Western immunoblotting but increased markedly by day 6. This antigen was also readily detected by immunocytochemistry and was localized to the cell body and to a lesser extent to neurites (see Fig.5 C).Figure 5Lentivi"

We found a phosphorylation stoichiometry of 3.0 ± 0.4 phosphorylated residues/NKCC1 protein harvested from shark rectal gland tubules maximally stimulated with forskolin and calyculin A, showing that at least three sites on the cotransporter are phosphorylated upon stimulation. Three phosphoacceptor sites were identified in the N-terminal domain of the protein (at Thr184, Thr189, and Thr202) using high pressure liquid chromatography and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry to analyze tryptic fragments of the radiolabeled cotransporter. None of these residues occurs in the context of strong consensus sites for known Ser/Thr kinases. The threonines and the surrounding amino acids are highly conserved between NKCC1 and NKCC2, and similarities are also present in the Na-Cl cotransporter NCC (or TSC). This strongly suggests that the phosphoregulatory mechanism is conserved among isoforms. Through expression of shark NKCC1 mutants in HEK-293 cells, Thr189 was found to be necessary for activation of the protein, whereas phosphorylation at Thr184 and Thr202 was modulatory, but not required. In conjunction with the recent finding (Darmen, R. B., Flemmer, A., and Forbush, B. (2001) J. Biol.

Along with the absorptive Na-K-Cl cotransporter NKCC2 and the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl transporter NCC (or TSC), NKCC1 belongs to the sodium-coupled branch of the cation chloride cotransporter family; this family also includes the K-Cl transporters (KCCs) (3Gillen C.M. Brill S. Payne J.A. Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16237-16244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) and two other major branches of putative transporters, including human CIP (4Caron L. Rousseau F. Gagnon E. Isenring P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32027-32036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and SLC12-8 (GenBankTM/EBI accession number AAK94307), whose transport functions are unknown. These proteins are all predicted to have 12 transmembrane-spanning domains that are responsible for ion transport properties (5Isenring P. Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24556-24562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and large cytoplasmic N and C termini that are candidates for regulatory domains. NKCC1 is expressed in many cell types and is involved in the regulation of both cell volume and intracellular Cl− concentration (2Haas M. Forbush III, B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 515-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 6Lytle C., Xu, J.C. Biemesderfer D. Forbush III, B. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1496-C1505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This isoform is also a major component of the basolateral membrane of secretory cells, mediating Cl− influx, the first step in the transepithelial movement of Cl−. In contrast, the NKCC2 isoform is limited to the apical membranes of absorptive epithelia such as the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop, where it is a major determinant of NaCl reabsorption from the tubular fluid.In order that the processes of regulatory volume increase, secretion, and absorption may be tightly controlled, the Na-K-Cl cotransporter is subject to strict regulation. The cotransporter is inactive in the basolateral membranes of secretory cells until the application of secretagogues or cell shrinkage causes a phosphorylation-dependent activation of the cotransporter (7Lytle C.

Studies on shark rectal gland secretory epithelia have shown an increase in phosphorylation at serines and threonines in response to forskolin or hypertonic stress, and the N terminus of NKCC1 has been shown to be the locus of at least some of the phosphoregulatory sites (7Lytle C. Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25438-25443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Kurihara K. Moore-Hoon M.L. Saitoh M. Turner R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C1184-C1193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although, in many cells, PKA1 agonists effect an increase in Na-K-Cl cotransporter activity, the cotransporter does not appear to be directly phosphorylated by PKA (12Lytle C. Forbush III, B. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C437-C448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Kurihara K. Nakanishi N. Moore-Hoon M.L. Turner R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C817-C823Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Current evidence indicates that the principal regulatory pathway involves PKA-mediated stimulation of apical Cl− channels and subsequent phosphorylation of NKCC1 in response to decreases in cell Cl− and volume by an as yet unknown kinase (12Lytle C. Forbush III, B. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C437-C448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The salt-secreting rectal gland of the shark has proven to be an excellent physiological and biochemical model system for the study of fluid secretion. In this study, we exploit the rectal gland epithelium to examine phosphorylation sites on NKCC1 and demonstrate that the N terminus functions as a regulatory phosphorylation domain. Of the three phosphoacceptors identified, Thr189 is shown to be critical for activation, whereas Thr184 and Thr202 are necessary for optimal sensitivity and full activation of transport.RESULTSWe determined the stoichiometry of NKCC1 phosphorylation in rectal gland tubule cells by measuring the moles of 32P incorporated per mol of Na-K-Cl cotransporter during a 10-min incubation period with forskolin and calyculin A. In this study, an average of 3.0 ± 0.4 phosphates/mol of cotransporter was determined in six experiments using the determined specific activity of γ-label in cellular ATP (Fig. 1). This value is close to that reported by Lytle (17Lytle C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15069-15077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) for cotransporter phosphorylation in avian red cells; as discussed below, the determination of stoichiometry represents a minimal estimate of the number of phosphoacceptor sites. We have noted that there is little incorporation of label into the cotransporter under resting conditions. In numerous experiments (data not shown) and as previously reported (7Lytle C. Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25438-25443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), <20% of 32P label is incorporated in the absence of stimulatory agents; and we have been unable to isolate individual peaks of radioactivity when control samples were digested with trypsin and peptides were separated by HPLC. A stoichiometric relationship >1 for phosphate incorporation into NKCC1 is consistent with a causal relationship between cotransporter phosphorylation and increased activity.To identify individual phosphorylated residues in NKCC1, labeled cotransporter protein was subjected to exhaustive trypsin digestion and separated by HPLC. The labeled Na-K-Cl cotransporter elution profile showed >15 fractions with levels of incorporation above background (Fig. 2). As shown below, this profile alone does not give a useful estimate of the number of phosphorylation sites on the cotransporter protein because incomplete trypsin digestion can give rise to many partial cleavage products and because mono- and diphosphorylated peptides will run with different mobility on the column. Using MALDI-TOF spectroscopy, phosphorylated peptides were identified by an appropriate mass shift in reflectron mode and/or by alkaline phosphatase digestion to remove phosphates from the peptides. The sequences of each peptide in the labeled fraction were ultimately confirmed by Edman degradation. We were able to positively identify four of the major phosphorylated peptides from the fractions with measurable levels of 32P incorporation and to match these with regions of the sNKCC1 protein (other fractions did not yield useful MALDI data). Table Ipresents a summary of the relevant analysis that led to the identification of the phosphorylation sites. Spectra from two of the fractions are included in Figs. 3 and4.Table ISummary of sNKCC1 phosphorylation site identificationHPLC fraction No.Phosphopeptide peaksMass of parent peptideNo. of phosphatesMatching sequenceConfirmed by Edman sequencingPhosphoacceptorDa4010629741201HT⋅VAQLGEK209YesThr20255175116311196IDHYRHT⋅VAQLGEK209YesThr20261149113272184T⋅FGHINT⋅IDAVPR195YesThr184and Thr18967141113271184T⋅FGHINT⋅IDAVPR195NoThr184or Thr189 Open table in a new tab Figure 3MALDI-TOF spectrometry of peptides in fraction 61.

Based on mass alone, the 1105-Da peak best matches the non-phosphoacceptor peptide1105MKEEEPWR1112 in the C-terminal domain of the sNKCC1 sequence. With the mass resolution available in this instrument, the 1489-Da peak had a possible match with two predicted phosphopeptides: diphosphorylated184TFGHNTIDAVPR195 and monotyrosine-phosphorylated 826AFYAPVYAEDLR837. To determine whether these peptides were phosphorylated, fraction 61 was treated with alkaline phosphatase and again analyzed by MALDI (Fig.3 B). Whereas the 1105-Da peak was not changed, the 1489-Da peak was lost, and a new peak appeared at 1327 Da. A mass shift of 162 Da is consistent with the enzymatic removal of two HPO3moieties from 184TFGHNTIDAVPR195. The spectrum of fraction 61 taken in reflectron mode (Fig. 3 C) lacked the 1489-Da peptide, whereas a peak appeared at 1300 Da, a 189-Da shift consistent with the post-source decay of two HPO3 + H2O moieties from a phosphopeptide with a mass 1489 Da (18Annan R.S. Carr S.A. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 3413-3421Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Finally, microsequencing of fraction 61 by Edman degradation confirmed the presence of both the1105MKEEEPWR1112 and184TFGHNTIDAVPR195 peptides. Thus, it is clear that fraction 61 contains a diphosphopeptide containing Thr(P)184 and Thr(P)189.In additional mass spectrometric analysis, the monophosphorylated form of the 184TFGHNTIDAVPR195 peptide was found to constitute the radioactivity in HPLC fraction 67 (data not shown). It was not determined which of the two phosphoacceptors was phosphorylated in this fraction (most likely the peak contains a mixture of the two potential monophosphorylated peptides). The Thr189phosphoacceptor site has been previously identified by Lytle and Forbush (7Lytle C. Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25438-25443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in a trypsin/CNBr digest fragment, presumably corresponding to fraction 67. In that study, it was not possible to identify Thr184 as a phosphoacceptor because of the high background in Edman sequencing of the initial residue.Mass spectrometric analysis of HPLC fraction 55 resulted in the identification of a second peptide with a novel phosphorylation site. In linear mode (Fig. 4 A), two major peptides appeared in the fraction, one at 1751 Da and the other at 923 Da. The 923-Da peak was insensitive to alkaline phosphatase (Fig. 4 B) and did not shift under conditions of limited post-source decay. The 1751-Da peak was shifted by −83 Da in the spectra of alkaline phosphatase-treated samples and by −98 Da in the reflectron spectrum (Fig. 4 C). In both cases, the shifts were consistent with loss of a single phosphate species from a serine or threonine residue on the peptide. Edman degradation showed that there were three peptides in the sample: one, an IgG contaminant; another, VYTMGPPR, with a mass 923 Da; and the third corresponding to sequence 196IDHYRHTVAQLGEK209, an incomplete trypsin digest product with a non-phosphorylated apparent mass of 1668 Da. Only a single threonine occurs on this peptide, and the gap in the sequencing data is consistent with its being the phosphoacceptor. The product of the complete digest,201HTVAQLGEK209, was also identified as the phosphorylated component in fraction 40 (data not shown.).To test the functional significance of these phosphorylation sites in regulation of the cotransporter, point mutants of the phosphoacceptor sites were stably expressed in HEK-293 cells. Each of these mutations was successfully produced and delivered to the plasma membrane, as illustrated by immunofluorescence in Fig.5. The J4 antibody is specific for shark NKCC1 and did not detect the native HEK-293 cell cotransporter, as illustrated in Fig. 5 (upper right and lower right panel pairs). It is shown that for some of the sNKCC1 constructs, there was considerable transporter retained in intracellular compartments; but in each case, NKCC1 appeared to be present in the cell membrane and thus should be potentially active in a86Rb influx assay.Figure 5Immunolocalization of sNKCC1 in cultured HEK-293 cells.

As illustrated in Fig. 6, replacing the Thr189 phosphoacceptor with alanine resulted in a mutant with little detectable cotransporter flux, presumably because the mutation prevents the activation of the cotransporter by a low Cl− stimulus. In fact, as discussed further below, these mutants actually have lower transport activity than the native HEK-293 cells (21Isenring P. Jacoby S.C. Payne J.A. Forbush III, B. J. Biol.

The T189D mutant showed neither a constitutive activation nor the ability to be activated in response to the stimulus (the latter is shown in Fig. 6). Similarly, a threonine-to-glutamate triple mutation of the identified phosphoacceptor sites resulted in a non-activable cotransporter (Fig.6).We have also altered the Thr189 site to meet the consensus criterion for PKA phosphorylation by replacement of the sequence186GHNT with 186RRNT (“PKA-1”) and, in another mutant, by 186RKNT (“PKA-2”). As with the other Thr189 mutations, these replacements eliminated the transport function of the cotransporter (Fig. 6), and there was no evidence of an increase in activity by elevation of cAMP levels using 50 μm forskolin (data not shown; forskolin actually produced some inhibition of 86Rb influx in HEK-293 cells (see Fig. 8). We presume either that the structural context of Thr189 renders it inaccessible to PKA or that the altered context of the site renders it ineffective in bringing about the necessary cotransporter conformational change.Figure 8Time course of activation of Na-K-Cl cotransport in sNKCC1 and mutant cell lines.

Fig. 7 A presents the results from one such experiment in which the effect of bumetanide is also shown; Fig. 7 B summarizes the results from more than four experiments with each mutant. As shown here, T184A mutants were less sensitive to Cl− changes compared with wild-type sNKCC1, showing activity only after preincubation at the lowest Cl− concentrations (Fig. 7, A, lower left panel; and B, upper panel). This behavior is consistent with a mechanism in which increased phosphorylation at other residues can partially compensate for the absence of phosphorylated Thr184. As with Thr189, phosphorylation at Thr184 could not be mimicked by replacement with fixed negative charge; the characteristics of T184E were similar to those of T184A, but with slightly greater chloride sensitivity (Fig.7 B, upper panel).The T202A mutant was also found to be less sensitive to [Cl−] changes compared with wild-type sNKCC1, although the difference was less pronounced than for the mutation at Thr184 (Fig. 7 B, upper panel). Again, a glutamate substitution failed to restore the phenotype of wild-type sNKCC1, and T202E was actually less sensitive to changes in [Cl−] compared with T202A (Fig.7 B, upper panel). The T184E/T202E double mutant was similar to the Thr202 single mutants in its activation profile (Fig. 7, A, lower right panel; andB, lower panel), whereas the flux of T184A/T202A was very low and not greatly different from that in vector-transfected cells (Figs. 6 and 7 B).In the region immediately upstream of Thr184, there are many potential phosphoacceptor serines and threonines, some of which (e.g. Thr177–Thr179) are in a very similar context to Thr184/Thr189. Speculating that these residues might also be involved in activation of the transporter, we prepared a T177A/T179A mutant. In fact, as illustrated in Fig. 7 B (lower panel), the behavior of this construct was very close to that of wild-type NKCC1, with a small tendency for the mutant to be less activated by a given stimulus.To investigate whether alternative activation modalities differentially affected the phosphorylation site mutants, we recorded time courses of86Rb influx following preincubations in various media. As illustrated in Fig. 8 (upper panel), sNKCC1 in HEK-293 cells was most rapidly activated by the low Cl− hypotonic stimulus (black), but was also activated by exposure to hypertonic media. Hypertonic sucrose solutions (blue) produced various degrees of activation, from ∼30% (Fig. 8, upper panel) to ∼80% in other experiments (data not shown). 0Na-0K-130Cl hypertonic medium (red) usually produced near-maximal activation, usually more slowly than low Cl− hypotonic medium. Interestingly, as observed consistently in these experiments, forskolin slowed the response to this intervention without abrogating the maximal level (Fig. 8, compare + and ○); this provides at least a phenomenological explanation for the forskolin inhibition of NKCC-mediated flux sometimes seen at intermediate levels of stimulation.In contrast to the behavior of wild-type sNKCC1, under hypertonic conditions, the Thr184 and T202E mutants were activated very poorly (T184A (Fig. 8, middle right panel) and T184A/T202A and T184E/T202E (data not shown)) or not at all (T202E (lower left panel) and T184E (data not shown)). The difference is especially striking in the case of T202E; not only was the transporter not activated by hypertonic media, but if previously activated in low Cl− hypotonic medium, it was seen to rapidly deactivate upon transition to 0Na-0K-130Cl hypertonic medium. It is clear that this cannot simply be explained by a lower sensitivity of the mutant transporters to all activating stimuli, for if that were the case, all curves would be down-shifted in the same way. Rather, the results of Fig. 8 suggest that different activation modalities may exert their effects preferentially through different subsets of phosphorylated residues.In the course of these experiments, we found that stable cell lines containing Thr189 mutants exhibited maximal86Rb influx that was generally lower than that of vector-transfected cell lines; this phenomenon was particularly evident at intermediate levels of cotransporter activation (Fig.9). This dominant-negative effect of inactive NKCCs has been noted in other mutagenesis studies in our laboratory (5Isenring P. Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24556-24562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and has also been seen with a truncation variant of NKCC2 (24Plata C. Mount D.B. Rubio V. Hebert S.C.

At this point, it is unclear whether the present effects are indicative of functional protein-protein interaction at the plasma membrane, competition for an unknown cellular component, or overexpression bottlenecks in the synthesis and delivery of NKCC.Figure 9Flux rates in inactive and low activity mutants compared with HEK-293 cells and vector controls. Average data from 4–11 experiments for each line are from the same superset of experiments described in Fig. 7.

These sites are proposed to form a regulatory locus in a region of the N-terminal cytoplasmic region conserved between NKCC isoforms. The functional role of each of the phosphoacceptors was examined by testing point mutants of sNKCC1 expressed in HEK-293 cells. In this way, phosphorylation of Thr189 was found to be absolutely necessary and possibly sufficient for cotransporter activation, and Thr184 and Thr202 were identified as important modulatory loci. The latter sites appear to be required both for maximal activation and for optimal sensitivity to Cl− and volume changes.A phosphorylation stoichiometry ≥1 is consistent with the hypothesis that phosphorylation of at least one residue is responsible for activation of the protein. It should be noted that any determination of phosphorylation stoichiometry is likely to be an underestimate of the number of phosphoacceptor sites because some dephosphorylation may occur during biochemical analysis and because there may be incomplete phosphorylation during cellular stimulation. This is particularly true in our dissociated cell system, where it is certain that some of the isolated cells have been damaged during enzymatic and mechanical treatment; this component would, of course, contribute NKCC protein without a corresponding component of 32P incorporation. Indeed, the isolation of the peptide containing Thr184 and Thr189 as a monophosphorylated species in fraction 67 illustrates that not every acceptor site is fully phosphorylated in our experimental samples. With this considered, we must defer to the measurement of 5:1 stoichiometry for NKCC1 in duck erythrocyte cotransporter maximally stimulated by hyperosmotic stress (17Lytle"

Previously, we have reported that this protein controls BC1 RNA expression and its subsequent distribution within dendrites and that Purα is associated with polyribosomes. Here, we report that, following treatment with EDTA, Purα was released from polyribosomes in mRNA/protein complexes (mRNPs), which also contained mStaufen, Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP), myosin Va, and other proteins with unknown functions. As the coimmunoprecipitation of these proteins by an anti-Purα antibody was abolished by RNase treatment, Purα may assist mRNP assembly in an RNA-dependent manner and be involved in targeting mRNPs to polyribosomes in cooperation with other RNA-binding proteins. The immunoprecipitation of mStaufen- and FMRP-containing mRNPs provided additional evidence that the anti-Purα detected structurally or functionally related mRNA subsets, which are distributed in the somatodendritic compartment. Furthermore, mRNPs appear to reside on rough endoplasmic reticulum equipped with a kinesin motor. Based on our present findings, we propose that this rough endoplasmic reticulum structure may form the molecular machinery that mediates and regulates multistep transport of polyribosomes along microtubules and actin filaments, as well as localized translation in the somatodendritic compartment.

Johnson E.M. Khalili K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3197-3205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), has the dual ability to up-regulate transcription of the BC1 RNA gene (2Kobayashi S. Agui K. Kamo S., Li, Y. Anzai K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and to mediate subsequent distribution of BC1 RNA within the somatodendritic compartment (3Ohashi S. Kobayashi S. Omori A. Ohara S. Omae A. Muramatsu T., Li, Y. Anzai K. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1781-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Two distinct regions of the BC1 RNA gene are required for transcriptional activation in vitro (2Kobayashi S. Agui K. Kamo S., Li, Y. Anzai K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). One of these corresponds to the 5′-proximal region of BC1 RNA, which overlaps with the dendrite-targeting motifs of BC1 RNA (4Muslimov I.A. Santi E. Homel P. Perini S. Higgins D. Tiedge H. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4722-4733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and, together with Purα, acts as a cis-RNA element that links the BC1 RNA molecule to microtubules (MTs)1 (3Ohashi S. Kobayashi S. Omori A. Ohara S. Omae A. Muramatsu T., Li, Y. Anzai K. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1781-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Pur proteins are predominantly expressed in neuronal cytoplasm and are translocated into the dendrites (5Li Y. Koike K. Ohashi S. Funakoshi T. Tadano M. Kobayashi S. Anzai K. Shibata N. Kobayashi M. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2001; 24: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We have also reported the association of Purα with free and membrane-bound polyribosomes via ribosomal subunits (5Li Y. Koike K. Ohashi S. Funakoshi T. Tadano M. Kobayashi S. Anzai K. Shibata N. Kobayashi M. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2001; 24: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), suggesting that this transcriptional regulator may also play a role in cytoplasmic mRNA transport and translation. Within dendrites, polyribosomes preferentially congregate near postsynaptic spines (6Steward O. Levy W.B. J. Neurosci. 1982; 2: 284-291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); this is the first clue suggesting that localized mRNAs are translated into proteins on demand (7Steward O. Schuman E.M. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 299-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Although little is known about when and where these polyribosomes are formed and how they emerge at postsynaptic sites, RNA-binding proteins that associate with polyribosomes appear to be involved. These proteins include mammalian Staufen (mStaufen) (8Kiebler M.A. Hemraj I. Verkade P. Kohrmann M. Fortes P. Marion R.M. Ortin J. Dotti C.G. J.

However, the specific RNA sequences recognized by these trans-acting proteins differ from those recognized by Purα: mStaufen preferentially binds to double-stranded RNA (18St. Johnston D. Brown N.H.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4803-4813Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). In contrast, Purα binds to (GGN)n consensus sequences (1Gallia G.L. Johnson E.M. Khalili K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3197-3205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that Purα may serve a distinct function in gene expression at the cytoplasmic level via RNAs that contain such consensus sequences. In this context, it would be intriguing to characterize the proteins that interact with Purα-polyribosome complexes. In the present study, we demonstrate that, following treatment with EDTA, Purα is released from polyribosomes in mRNA/protein complexes (mRNPs), which also contain mStaufen, FMRP, myosin Va, and several other proteins with unknown functions. Furthermore, our results also suggest that mRNPs may reside on rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) structures equipped with a kinesin motor. We propose that these structures may form the molecular machinery that mediates and regulates dendritic transport and localized translation of mRNAs in polyribosomes. The antibodies used in the present study were obtained from the following sources: the rabbit anti-Purα antibody was produced as described previously (5Li Y. Koike K. Ohashi S. Funakoshi T. Tadano M.

Bull. 2001; 24: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar); the mouse anti-kinesin heavy chain (KHC) monoclonal antibody (clone H2; see Ref.23Pfister K.K. Wagner M.C. Stenoien D.L. Brady S.T.

Genet. 1993; 4: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar) were purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA); the rabbit anti-GRP78 (BiP) antibody was obtained from Affinity Bioreagents, Inc. (Golden, CO); and rabbit antibodies against ribosomal proteins L8 and S14 (25Nadano D. Ishihara G. Aoki C. Yoshinaka T. Irie S. Sato T-A. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 2000; 91: 802-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. Taka-Aki Sato of Columbia University. The rabbit anti-mStaufen antibody was a generous gift from Dr. Juan Ortin of Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia, Madrid. The rabbit anti-myosin Va antibody was raised specifically for this study as described in the following section. The specificity of the antibodies was checked by Western blot analysis. An anti-myosin Va antibody was raised in rabbits against a synthetic multiple antigenic peptide corresponding to amino acids 197–210 (LASNPIMESIGNAK) of myosin Va. The antibody was then affinity-purified to the peptide coupled to aminoalkyl agarose (Bio-Rad; Hercules, CA) (5Li Y. Koike K. Ohashi S. Funakoshi T. Tadano M. Kobayashi S. Anzai K. Shibata N. Kobayashi M. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2001; 24: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, whole immunoglobulin G (IgG) was extracted from rabbit sera by precipitation with 40% ammonium sulfate. Following centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, the IgG-rich pellet was reprecipitated, dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), dialyzed against PBS, and affinity-purified. The purified IgG was then precipitated by adding solid ammonium sulfate to 75% saturation. The pellet thus obtained was dissolved in PBS and dialyzed against PBS. All of the following steps were performed at 0–4 °C unless otherwise stated. Mouse brains were homogenized in TKM buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 μg/ml cycloheximide), and the homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was recentrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min to yield postmitochondrial supernatant (PMS). The PMS was then further centrifuged at 130,000 × g for 1 h, resulting in supernatant (S100) and pellet (P100) fractions. The P100 fraction was resuspended in TKM buffer, and solid KCl was added to a final concentration of 150 mm. The sample was kept on ice for at least 15 min and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min to remove insoluble materials. The supernatant was used as the P100 extract. Western blot analysis was performed essentially as described previously (3Ohashi S. Kobayashi S. Omori A. Ohara S. Omae A. Muramatsu T., Li, Y. Anzai K. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1781-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P; Millipore; Bedford, MA). The membrane was blocked overnight with 5% skim milk in TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) at 4 °C, rinsed with TBST, and reacted with the appropriate primary antibody, which was diluted according to the supplier's instructions. The primary antibody was then removed by washing with TBST, and the membrane was incubated with an appropriate alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody. Finally, after the membrane had been thoroughly washed with TBST, the protein signals were detected using the ProtBlot Western blot AP System (Promega; Madison, WI). Polyribosomes were isolated as described previously (5Li Y. Koike K. Ohashi S. Funakoshi T. Tadano M. Kobayashi S. Anzai K. Shibata N. Kobayashi M. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2001; 24: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In brief, mouse brains were homogenized in TKM buffer and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The PMS fraction was treated with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 in the presence or absence of 25 mm EDTA for 30 min and then centrifuged on a linear sucrose gradient (8.5–45% (w/v) in TKM buffer) at 160,000 × g for 2.5 h. After centrifugation, fractions were collected from the bottom of the gradient and stored at −80 °C until required for analysis of their polyribosome contents. P100 extracts (150 μg of protein in 250 μl) were incubated with 5 μg (in 5 μl) of either control antibody or anti-Purα antibody for 2 h at 4 °C in TKM buffer with or without 0.1% Nonidet P-40. For P100 extracts subjected to treatment with EDTA, the antibodies were added after the extracts had been treated with or without 25 mm EDTA on ice for 30 min. When the extracts were treated with RNase A in the presence of EDTA, 0.2 μg/ml RNase A was additionally included. Subsequently, 40 μl of Dynabeads M-280 sheep anti-rabbit IgG (Dynal; Oslo, Norway) was added, and the reaction mixtures were incubated for an additional 4 h at 4 °C. The beads were then collected with a magnet, and the supernatant was saved as “unbound fraction” for subsequent Western blot analysis. The collected beads were washed five times (5 min each) in 200 μl of TKM buffer containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 or 0.1% Nonidet P-40 plus 25 mm EDTA, as appropriate. The beads were then washed for an additional 15 min, after which the immune complex was eluted in 40 μl of SDS-containing sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol). The whole eluted materials (40 μl), one-tenth volume of the unbound fraction (∼300 μl), and the last wash fraction (200 μl) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blot analysis. For RNA extraction, the beads were suspended in RNP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, and 0.25 mmdithiothreitol) and then purified by the SDS-phenol-chloroform method, followed by ethanol precipitation as described previously (26Kobayashi S. Goto S. Anzai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4726-4730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated RNAs were resolved on a 1.5% morpholinopropanesulfonic acid-formaldehyde-agarose gel, and the RNAs were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was prehybridized in a hybridization solution containing 5× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA, 5× Denhardt's reagent, 50% formamide, 1% SDS, and 0.1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA for 2 h at 42 °C and then hybridized with 32P-end-labeled probes overnight. The membrane was washed with 2× standard saline citrate and 0.1% SDS and then with 0.2× standard saline citrate and 0.1% SDS. For probe removal, the membrane was heated in boiling water for 2 min, cooled to room temperature, and air-dried. Oligonucleotide probes used were: oligo(dT)25 and 28 S rRNA-specific oligonucleotide (5′-TGACGAGGATTTGGCTACCTTAAGAGAGTCATA-3′). Primary cultures of hippocampal neurons from embryonic rats (day 19) were grown on polyethylenimine-coated coverslips at a density of ∼200 cells/mm2. On the 6th day of culture, the cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min, rinsed with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. The cells were then blocked with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 30 min and incubated with the appropriate primary antibody for 2 h. After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Molecular Probes; Eugene, OR) or Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories; West Grove, PA) for 1.5 h. For double staining with a combination of the rabbit primary antibodies, a biotinylated anti-Purα antibody was used. The biotinylated antibody was detected with Cy3-streptavidin (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The Biotin Labeling Kit (Roche Diagnostics; Mannheim, Germany) was used for labeling of antibodies with biotin in accordance with the supplier's instructions. The immunostained cells were viewed using a Zeiss LSM-510 fluorescence laser-scanning confocal microscope. We have previously reported that the single-stranded DNA- and RNA-binding protein Purα associates with polyribosomes via the ribosomal subunits (5Li Y. Koike K. Ohashi S. Funakoshi T. Tadano M. Kobayashi S. Anzai K. Shibata N. Kobayashi M. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2001; 24: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, as these findings came mainly from cosedimentation studies, in the present study we performed initial immunoprecipitation experiments using an anti-Purα antibody to obtain more direct data on Purα/polyribosome interactions. For this analysis, protein extracts were prepared from the P100 fraction of brain cytoplasm using Nonidet P-40 because Purα is concentrated to the greatest extent in this fraction. Fig. 1 A shows that ribosomes were pulled down by the anti-Purα antibody but not by the control antibody and that immunoprecipitation of the ribosomes was completely blocked by the Purα peptide (Fig. 1 B), confirming our previous observations. It is important to emphasize that the association of Purα with the polyribosomes was not mediated by rERs; the rER-marker protein BiP was not immunoprecipitated but remained in the unbound fraction in the presence of Nonidet P-40 (Fig.1 A). The immunoprecipitates obtained above were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Fig. 2 and show that one particular high molecular mass protein (200 kDa) was predominantly detected in the P100 brain fraction (lane 1). This protein was much less apparent in the S100 fraction and was not detected in a P100 fraction prepared from the liver. An additional protein (220 kDa) was immunoprecipitated from the S100 brain fraction (lane 2). On microsequencing of the 200 kDa protein (3Ohashi S. Kobayashi S. Omori A. Ohara S. Omae A. Muramatsu T., Li, Y. Anzai K. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1781-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), amino acid sequences were obtained for two peptides containing ten (LTNLEXVYNS) and seven (IMQLQRK) amino acids, respectively. A computer search revealed that these two peptides were identical to amino acids 950–959 and 929–935 of the mouse nonmuscle myosin heavy chain Va (myosin Va), respectively (27Mercer J.A. Seperack P.K. Strobel M.C. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nature. 1991; 349: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). The 220 kDa protein also yielded two peptides, which contained ten (EQADFAVEAL) and eight (REQEVAEL) amino acids, respectively. These peptides were identical to amino acids 415–424 and 1172–1179 of the human nonmuscle myosin heavy chain type B (28Phillips C.L. Yamakawa K. Adelstein R.S. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1995; 16: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Myosin Va is known to be an unconventional molecular motor for the transport of certain vesicles (29Evans L.L. Lee A.J. Bridgman P.C. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2055-2066Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and mRNAs (30Böhl F. Kruse C. Frank A. Ferring D. Jansen R.P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5514-5524Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), while myosin type B is an isoform of nonmuscular myosin II and is reportedly involved in the transport of β-actin mRNA in fibroblasts (31Latham V.M., Yu, E.H. Tullio A.N. Adelstein R.S. Singer R.H. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1010-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In the present experiments, myosin II type B, which was more concentrated in the S100 fraction, was not studied further. To confirm that the 200 kDa protein is perceptible by the anti-Purα antibody, we raised an antibody against a myosin Va peptide to act as a probe. Fig. 3,A and B show that the anti-myosin Va antibody detected a protein band with the expected molecular mass (200 kDa) in the immunoprecipitate. This 200-kDa protein was confirmed to be myosin Va because it was not detected by the anti-myosin Va antibody when brain tissue from dilute-lethal mice (a myosin Va-null mutant mouse strain; Ref. 27Mercer J.A. Seperack P.K. Strobel M.C. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nature. 1991; 349: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) was similarly analyzed (Fig. 3 D). Fig. 3 again indicates that rERs are not relevant to the immunoprecipitation of myosin Va because, in the presence of Nonidet P-40, the myosin Va level remained unaffected, whereas BiP protein became undetectable (compare Fig. 3 A with B). These observations suggest that myosin Va powers the translocation of Purα/polyribosome complexes along actin filaments via protein-protein interactions. Although this may at first seem incompatible with our previous observations that Purα may play a role in MT-based RNA transport (3Ohashi S. Kobayashi S. Omori A. Ohara S. Omae A. Muramatsu T., Li, Y. Anzai K. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1781-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), a kinesin motor is reported to be in direct contact with myosin Va (32Huang J.D. Brady S.T. Richards B.W. Stenolen D. Resau J.H. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nature. 1999; 397: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). This type of motor is known to be present in both axonal and dendritic processes (33Ferreira A. Niclas J. Vale R.D. Banker G. Kosik K.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 595-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and to be involved in the anterograde translocation of vesicles and dendritic mRNAs such as CaMKIIα mRNA (34Severt W.L. Biber T.U., Wu, X. Hecht N.B. DeLorenzo R.J. Jakoi E.R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3691-3702Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore determined whether the KHC was immunoprecipitated by the anti-Purα antibody. Unlike myosin Va, but similar to BiP proteins, KHC was immunoprecipitated only in the absence of Nonidet P-40 (Fig. 3,A and B), indicating that the interaction of the kinesin motor with the Purα/polyribosome/myosin Va complex is indirect and is mediated by rER. In support of the relevance of rER, the anti-Purα antibody pulled down 7SL RNA (the RNA component of signal recognition particles) as well as BiP in the absence of Nonidet P-40 (see Fig. 3 A). Thus, we suggest that polyribosomes containing Purα and myosin Va could be translocated along MTs in the form of rERs equipped with a kinesin motor. Note that the molecular isoform of the kinesin motor detected here is likely to be either KIF5A or KIF5C, as the anti-KHC antibody H2 used in this study reportedly shows a preference for KIF5A and KIF5C to KIF5B during Western blot analysis (35Kanai Y. Okada Y. Tanaka Y. Harada A. Terada S. Hirokawa N. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6374-6384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purα has properties very similar to those of mStaufen and FMRP, both of which bind to polyribosomes, are localized to rER, and are distributed to the somatodendritic compartment (5Li Y. Koike K.

Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1539-1547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether these proteins are also incorporated into polyribosomes together with Purα and myosin Va. As shown in Fig. 3 B, FMRP and mStaufen were specifically coimmunoprecipitated by the anti-Purα antibody in the presence of Nonidet P-40. Note that the anti-FMRP antibody used in the Western blot analysis as a probe appears cross-reactive with two FMRP-related proteins, FXR1P and FXR2P as well as FMRP, as reported by others (24Devys D. Lutz Y. Rouyer N. Bellocq J.P. Mandel J.L. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar), but in the present study we collectively refer to them as FMRP. Furthermore, Purα, myosin Va, and polyribosomes were reverse-immunoprecipitated by the anti-FMRP antibody (Fig.3 C). Consistent with these results, Purα, FMRP, and mStaufen cosedimented with polyribosomes on a velocity gradient whose banding profiles were essentially identical to those previously reported (Fig. 4 A; see Fig.4 B for mStaufen; see also Refs. 5Li Y.

Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1539-1547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig.4 A also shows that, in the absence of Nonidet P-40, BiP, KHC, and myosin Va were distributed throughout the gradient, although most of the KHC was localized in the top fractions. Nonidet P-40-treated PMS yielded similar profiles, except for BiP and KHC (Fig.4 B), both of which were converted to slower sedimenting materials as expected from Fig. 3, A and B. In addition, myosin Va as well as Purα, FMRP, and mStaufen were shifted to the top fractions of the gradient following treatment with EDTA (Fig. 4 C). Other differences in the shift profiles were also noticed after EDTA treatment: FMRP and myosin Va sedimented ahead of ribosomal subunits with a peak at about 100 S, suggesting that these two proteins were released from the ribosomes upon EDTA treatment. Similar observations, in which FMRP was released as large mRNPs (ranging from 30 to 100 S) from EDTA-treated polyribosomes, have also been reported (38Eberhart D.E. Malter H.E. Feng Y. Warren S.T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1083-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 39Feng Y. Absher D. Eberhart D.E. Brown V. Malter H.E. Warren S.T. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 109-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Purα and mStaufen exhibited somewhat broader distributions than FMRP and myosin Va (Fig. 4 C); some sedimented in concert with the FMRP and myosin Va, while some sedimented with the ribosomal subunit fractions. In the former situation, Purα and mStaufen appeared to be released from the polyribosome as a complex with FMRP and myosin Va (see Fig.5 B).Figure 5Western blot analysis of immunoisolated Purα/polyribosome-bound proteins. A, Purα/polyribosome complex-bound proteins were isolated with anti-Purα from the P100 extract of the brain treated with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 or 0.1% Nonidet P-40 plus 25 mm EDTA, followed by Western blot analysis using the appropriate antibody for proteins indicated at the right side of each panel. RNA was purified from each immunoprecipitate (bottom panel). B, Purα/polyribosome complex-bound proteins were isolated with anti-Purα from fractions 1–3 of the sucrose density gradient shown in Fig. 4 B. The pooled gradient fractions were treated with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 or 0.1% Nonidet P-40 plus 25 mm EDTA as indicated above each panel prior to adding anti-Purα antibody. In therightmost panels fractions 6–8 of the velocity gradient shown in Fig. 4 C were pooled, treated with 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and similarly analyzed. Antibodies used in the Western blot analysis are indicated."

The cytopathological hallmark in the remaining motor neurons of ALS is the presence of ubiquitylated inclusions consisting of insoluble protein aggregates. In this paper we report that Dorfin, a RING finger-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, is predominantly localized in the inclusion bodies of familial ALS with a copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) mutation as well as sporadic ALS. Dorfin physically bound and ubiquitylated various SOD1 mutants derived from familial ALS patients and enhanced their degradation, but it had no effect on the stability of the wild-type SOD1. The overexpression of Dorfin protected against the toxic effects of mutant SOD1 on neural cells and reduced SOD1 inclusions. Our results indicate that Dorfin protects neurons by recognizing and then ubiquitylating mutant SOD1 proteins followed by targeting them for proteasomal degradation.

Although most patients with ALS are sporadic cases, 5–10% of ALS patients show a familial trait, and in 10–20% of these patients this trait is associated with mutations in the SOD1 gene (3Rosen D.R.

Med. 2002; 8: 88-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), to date the exact mechanisms causing the disease are still unknown. In considering the pathogenesis of ALS, it is important that the inclusion bodies, which consist of aggregated, ubiquitylated proteins surrounded by disorganized filaments, are frequently seen in the surviving motor neurons in both sporadic and familial ALS (7Hirano A.

Interestingly, SOD1 is reported to be the major component of the neuronal hyaline inclusion (NHI) of familial ALS associated with SOD1 mutation (13Shibata N. Hirano A. Kobayashi M. Siddique T.

In addition, the NHI in the motor neurons of familial ALS is commonly stained with anti-ubiquitin (Ub)-antibody, but it remains uncertain whether SOD1 itself is ubiquitylated with respect to the inclusion body formation. To clarify the mechanisms underlying the inclusion body formation and consequent motor neuron degeneration in ALS, it is important to know how SOD1 and/or other protein component(s) are ubiquitylated. Dorfin is a gene product we cloned from the anterior horn tissues of the human spinal cord (14Niwa J. Ishigaki S. Doyu M. Suzuki T. Tanaka K. Sobue G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 706-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Dorfin contains two RING finger motifs and an in-between RING finger (IBR) domain at the N terminus (14Niwa J. Ishigaki S. Doyu M. Suzuki T. Tanaka K. Sobue G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 706-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).

It was reported that HHARI (human homologue of ariadne) and H7-AP1 (UbcH7-associated protein), which are both RING finger/IBR motif-containing proteins, interact with the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) UbcH7 through the RING finger/IBR motif and that a distinct subclass of RING finger/IBR motif-containing proteins represents a new family of proteins that specifically interact with distinct E2 enzymes (16Moynihan T.P.

These facts suggest that RING finger/IBR family proteins are new members of the RING-type E3 family. We found that Dorfin interacts with UbcH7 or UbcH8 through the RING finger/IBR domain and mediates E3 activity (14Niwa J. Ishigaki S. Doyu M. Suzuki T. Tanaka K. Sobue G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 706-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We reported previously (14Niwa J. Ishigaki S. Doyu M. Suzuki T. Tanaka K. Sobue G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 706-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) that Dorfin is mainly localized in the centrosomal region and forms an aggresome-like structure. Aggresomes are pericentriolar cytoplasmic inclusions containing misfolded ubiquitylated proteins, which appear when the cell fails to further degrade misfolded proteins (29Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar). In addition, cultured cells expressing mutant SOD1 have been demonstrated to form an aggresome-like structure (30Johnston J.A. Dalton M.J. Gurney M.E. Kopito R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12571-12576Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Based on this background, we postulated that Dorfin could be critically important in the formation of ubiquitylated inclusion bodies in ALS. We show here that Dorfin is localized in the inclusion bodies found in the motor neurons of familial ALS with a SOD1 mutation as well as sporadic ALS and mutant SOD1-transgenic mice and is involved in the ubiquitylation and targeted degradation of mutant SOD1. Immunohistochemical studies were carried out on 10% formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded spinal cords filed in the Department of Neurology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine. The specimens were obtained at autopsy from two familial ALS patients with mutant SOD1N86S (male aged 57 years and female aged 54 years), three sporadic cases of ALS (all males, aged 46, 59, and 67 years) and four age-matched, non-neurologic disease patients. The spinal cord specimens of these ALS cases and those of mutant SOD1G93A-transgenic mice (B6SJL-TgN(SOD1-G93A)1Gur; The Jackson Laboratory) were immunohistochemically stained with antibodies against Dorfin (14Niwa J. Ishigaki S. Doyu M. Suzuki T. Tanaka K. Sobue G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 706-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), SOD1 (SOD-100; StressGen Biotechnologies, La Jolla, CA), and Ub (P4D1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Double staining of identical sections was performed as described (31Hishikawa N. Hashizume Y. Yoshida M. Sobue G. Neuropathol. Appl. Neurobiol. 2001; 27: 362-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In immunofluorescence microscopy, Alexa-488- and Alexa-546-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) were used. The human and animal studies described in this report were approved by the Ethics Review Committees of the Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine. Human wild-type SOD1 and mutant SOD1G37R, SOD1H46R, SOD1G85R, and SOD1G93A cDNAs containing the entire coding region were inserted in-frame into the BamHI and XhoI site of pcDNA3.1(+)/MycHis vector (Invitrogen) or into the XhoI and BamHI site of the pEGFP-N1 vector (CLONTECH). Construction of a pcDNA3.1(+)/FLAG-Ub vector and the Dorfin or Dorfin deletion mutant (Dorfin-N and Dorfin-C) pcDNA4/HisMax vectors was reported elsewhere (14Niwa J. Ishigaki S. Doyu M. Suzuki T. Tanaka K. Sobue G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 706-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells and Neuro2a cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. Transfections were performed using the Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen). Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% SDS) with a protease inhibitor mixture. To inhibit cellular proteasome activity, cells were treated with 0.5 μm MG132 (N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-leucinal; Sigma) for 16 h after overnight post-transfection. Immunopurified (IP) Xpress-Dorfin bound to anti-Xpress antibody (Invitrogen) with protein G beads (Amersham Biosciences) was prepared from lysates of HEK293 cells transfected with 1.5 μg of pcDNA4/HisMax-Dorfin or Dorfin deletion mutants. IP-SOD1-Myc was prepared with anti-Myc IgG-linked protein A beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) from lysates of HEK293 cells transfected with 1 μg of pcDNA3.1(+)MycHis wild-type or mutant SOD1. Slurries of IP-Xpress-Dorfin were mixed with IP-Myc-SOD1 and incubated at 30 °C for 90 min in 50 μl of reaction buffer containing ATP (4 mm ATP in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 2 mm MgCl2), 100 ng of rabbit E1 (Calbiochem), 2 μg of UbcH7 (Affiniti, Exeter, United Kingdom), and 2 μg of His-Ub (Calbiochem). The reaction was terminated by adding 20 μl of 4× sample buffer, and 20-μl aliquots of the reaction mixtures were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. Pulse-chase analysis of SOD1-transfected HEK293 cells was performed as described previously (30Johnston J.A. Dalton M.J. Gurney M.E. Kopito R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12571-12576Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Pulse labeling was performed with 250 μCi/ml [35S]Cys for 45 min. After washing in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the cells were chased for the indicated time intervals in complete medium. Samples were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody, separated on 5–20% SDS/PAGE, and analyzed by phosphorimaging (BAS2000; Fujix, Tokyo, Japan). 4 × 104 Neuro2a cells were grown overnight on 2-well collagen-coated slides. They were transfected with 0.4 μg of pcDNA3.1(+)/MycHis-SOD1, 0.4 μg of pcDNA4/HisMax-Dorfin, and 0.4 μg of pEGFP-C3 vector (CLONTECH). pcDNA4/HisMax-LacZ was used as control instead of Dorfin. Cells were incubated for 16 h, and the medium was then replaced with serum-free medium. Cell death was determined in propidium iodide (PI)-stained preparations at 48 h after serum deprivation. The ratio of dead cells was expressed as the percentage of PI- and GFP-positive cells in GFP-positive cells. For cell viability assay, 5 × 103 Neuro2a cells were grown in 96-well collagen-coated plates overnight. They were then transfected with 0.1 μg of pcDNA3.1(+)/MycHis-SOD1 and 0.1 μg of pcDNA4/HisMax-Dorfin. pcDNA4/HisMax-LacZ was used as control instead of Dorfin. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)-based cell proliferation assay was then performed using CellTiter 96 (Promega) at 0, 24, and 48 h after incubation. The assay was carried out in triplicate. Absorbance at 490 nm was measured in a multiple plate reader. For quantification of SOD1 aggregates, Neuro2a cells transfected with pEGFP-N1-SOD1 and pcDNA4/HisMax-Dorfin or -LacZ were examined using a confocal microscope (Radiance; Bio-Rad). All cells were counted in fields selected at random from four different quadrants of the culture well. Counting was performed by an investigator blind to the experimental condition. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that Dorfin was predominantly localized in the NHI found in familial ALS (Fig.1, A–C) and mutant SOD1G93A-transgenic mice (Fig. 1 D) as well as in sporadic ALS (Fig. 1 E). About 50% of NHIs were positively stained for Dorfin. Dorfin immunoreactivity was concentrated either at the periphery of the inclusion (Fig. 1 A) or throughout it (Fig. 1 B). Some aggregates localized in neuronal processes (Fig. 1 C). Furthermore, Dorfin colocalized not only with SOD1-positive inclusions (Fig. 1, F–I) but also with Ub in NHI in both familial (Fig. 1, J–L) and sporadic (Fig. 1, M–O) ALS. Neither neural tissues not affected in ALS nor tissues other than central nervous tissue were stained with Dorfin. Only weak staining of Dorfin was diffusely observed throughout motor neurons in normal human spinal cords without neurologic disease and non-transgenic littermate mice (data not shown). These findings suggest that Dorfin is involved in inclusion body formation via the ubiquitylation of substrate(s) yet to be identified in NHI and that SOD1 is a plausible target for ubiquitylation by Dorfin in familial ALS. We examined whether Dorfin interacts with SOD1 in vivo. To this end, Xpress-tagged Dorfin was coexpressed with C-terminal Myc-tagged wild-type or various mutant forms of SOD1 in HEK293 cells. Western blotting analysis revealed that Dorfin co-immunoprecipitated with all mutant SOD1s examined here but not with wild-type SOD1 (Fig.2 A). However, Dorfin failed to bind either of the androgen receptors with normal (Q24) and extended (Q97) polyglutamine tracts or wild-type and mutant (A30P,A53T) α-synuclein (data not shown). Dorfin has a unique primary structure containing a RING finger/IBR motif at its N terminus and can be structurally divided into two parts, i.e. the N-terminal region containing a RING finger/IBR motif (Dorfin-N) that interacts with E2 and the C-terminal region with no similarity to any other known proteins (Dorfin-C) (Fig. 2 B). We found that Dorfin-C but not Dorfin-N specifically bound mutant SOD1G85R (Fig.2 C), indicating that Dorfin binds to the mutant SOD1 via its C-terminal region. Physical interaction between Dorfin and mutant SOD1 prompted us to investigate whether SOD1 itself is ubiquitylated by Dorfin. We first examined whether SOD1 is ubiquitylated in a culture cell model. C-terminal Myc-tagged wild-type or mutant SOD1 was co-transfected with FLAG-tagged Ub in HEK293 cells. When SOD1 was immunoprecipitated after treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, all mutant SOD1s, unlike wild-type SOD1, were found to be polyubiquitylated (Fig.3 A). In addition, ectopic expression of Dorfin increased the ubiquitylation of mutant SOD1G85R without affecting the wild-type SOD1 (Fig.3 B). We next examined whether Dorfin directly ubiquitylates SOD1 in vitro. For this purpose, we prepared IP Xpress-Dorfin or its deletion mutants and IP wild-type or mutant SOD1G85R-Myc without proteasome inhibitor after transfection into HEK293 cells, independently. When these immunoprecipitates were incubated with recombinant E1, E2 (UbcH7), His-tagged Ub, and ATP, high molecular weight ubiquitylated bands were observed in the presence of IP-Xpress-Dorfin with mutant SOD1G85R, whereas no signal was noted in wild-type SOD1 or mutant SOD1G85R in the absence of either Dorfin, E1, or E2 (Fig. 3 C). Deletion mutants of Dorfin (Dorfin-N or Dorfin-C) did not show a significant activity upon ubiquitylation against mutant SOD1G85R (Fig.3 C), indicating that both E2-recruiting N-terminal and substrate-binding C-terminal portions are required for Dorfin–mediated ubiquitylation. Further in vitro studies using other mutants showed that Dorfin also ubiquitylated SOD1G37R and SOD1G93A significantly and ubiquitylated SOD1H46R as well, although to a lesser extent (Fig.3 D). Mutant SOD1 protein has a short half-life compared with wild-type SOD1 as shown previously by pulse-chase experiments (30Johnston J.A. Dalton M.J. Gurney M.E. Kopito R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12571-12576Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 32Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.S. Guarnieri M., Xu, Z.S. Wong P.C. Brown Jr., R.H. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Cleveland D.W. Proc.

Sci. 1996; 139: 15-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). By blocking the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, its half-life can be elongated (30Johnston J.A. Dalton M.J. Gurney M.E. Kopito R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12571-12576Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 33Hoffman E.K. Wilcox H.M. Scott R.W. Siman R. J. Neurol. Sci. 1996; 139: 15-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). We examined whether the in vivostability of wild-type and mutant SOD1 is affected by Dorfin. We used pulse-chase analysis to evaluate the stability of wild-type and mutant Myc-tagged SOD1 expressed in HEK293 cells in the presence or absence of Dorfin. Pulse-chase experiments revealed that 35S-labeled SOD1G85R was fairly unstable compared with its wild-type version, and the degradation of SOD1G85R was greatly accelerated when Dorfin was overexpressed, whereas the stability of wild-type SOD1 was unaffected (Fig. 3 E). Based on these observations, we inferred that Dorfin protects cells against mutant SOD1-mediated neurotoxicity. To study neuronal cell death induced by mutations in SOD1, we used a mouse neuroblastoma cell line (Neuro2a) transiently transfected with wild-type and a mutant (G85R and G93A). These cells are maintained as nondifferentiated dividing cells but can be induced to differentiate to be neural cells by serum deprivation (34Pasinelli P. Borchelt D.R. Houseweart M.K. Cleveland D.W. Brown Jr., R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15763-15768Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). We transfected SOD1 with Dorfin or LacZ into Neuro2a cells and induced neural differentiation by serum deprivation after overnight post-transfection. Co-expression of Dorfin significantly reduced the percentages of PI-positive dead cells in both mutant SOD1G85R- and SOD1G93A-transfected cells compared with those in cells co-expressing LacZ (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, Dorfin-N and Dorfin-C had no protective activity, indicating that the E3 activity of Dorfin is essential for the suppression of mutant SOD1-induced neuronal cell death. We also found a similar Dorfin-dependent protective effect against the loss of neuronal cell viability evoked by mutant SOD1 using the MTT assay (Fig. 4 B). One hypothesis argues that toxicity results from the tendency of mutant SOD1 to aggregate into the cytoplasmic inclusion bodies (35Bruijn L.I. Houseweart M.K. Kato S. Anderson K.L. Anderson S.D. Ohama E. Reaume A.G. Scott R.W. Cleveland D.W. Science. 1998; 281: 1851-1854Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar) that are evident in cultured spinal motor neurons (36Durham H.D. Roy J. Dong L. Figlewicz D.A. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 56: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) and COS7 cells (37Koide T. Igarashi S. Kikugawa K. Nakano R. Inuzuka T. Yamada M. Takahashi H. Tsuji S. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 257: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) expressing mutant SOD1 cDNA or in motor neurons from SOD1 transgenic mice (38Tu P.H. Raju P.

In our experimental model, the expression of mutant SOD1G85R induced perinuclear intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies in Neuro2a cells (Fig. 4 C,left panel). The overexpression of Dorfin significantly reduced the number of aggregates in SOD1G85R-transfected Neuro2a cells (Fig. 4 C,right panel, and 4 D). In the present study, we showed for the first time that mutant SOD1s are selectively degraded through a Dorfin-mediated Ub-proteasome pathway and that Dorfin protects neuronal cells against the toxic effects of mutant SOD1. Whereas Dorfin can ubiquitylate mutant SOD1s, probably because of their fragile or misfolded conformation, the constant production of high amounts of impaired SOD1 in familial ALS becomes a burden on the protein degradation process through the Ub-proteasome pathway, eventually overwhelming the capacity of the proteasome to degrade toxic SOD1 and subsequently leading to the accumulation of ubiquitylated SOD1 and motor neuron death. Consistent with this scenario, recent studies reported that impairment of the Ub-proteasome system is caused by protein aggregation (40Bence N.F. Sampat R.M. Kopito R.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar). Thus, up-regulation or exogenous expression of Dorfin may be therapeutically beneficial in familial ALS. Our results also showed that Dorfin colocalized with ubiquitylated inclusions not only in familial ALS but also in sporadic ALS. Based on this finding, it is conceivable that familial and sporadic forms of ALS share a common mechanism involving the dysfunction of the Ub-proteasome pathway despite distinct etiological mechanisms. Studies of parkin have provided new insights into the importance of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in the neuronal degeneration of PD. Parkin was shown to have E3 activity (19Shimura H. Hattori N.

A. 2000; 97: 13354-13359Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). Recently, anO-glycosylated form of α-synuclein and synphilin-1 were shown to be substrates of parkin (41Shimura H. Schlossmacher M.G. Hattori N. Frosch M.P. Trockenbacher A. Schneider R. Mizuno Y. Kosik K.S. Selkoe D.J. Science. 2001; 293: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar, 42Chung K.K. Zhang Y. Lim K.L. Tanaka Y. Huang H. Gao J. Ross C.A. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1144-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Both α-synuclein and synphilin-1 are major components of Lewy bodies, which are ubiquitylated inclusion bodies characteristic of sporadic PD. A link between sporadic and familial PD through α-synuclein, synphilin-1, and parkin suggests that common molecular pathogenic mechanisms underlie PD. The accumulation of toxic or undesired proteins in neurons may result from the failure of degradation systems and could subsequently lead to neurodegeneration. From this point of view, in sporadic ALS post-translationally modified SOD1 (43Bredesen D.E. Ellerby L.M. Hart P.J. Wiedau-Pazos M. Valentine J.S. Ann. Neurol. 1997; 42: 135-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) or other unknown substrates might accumulate in the ubiquitylated form and play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease. Our results raise an important question related to the function of Dorfin; what is the biological role of Dorfin and how does Dorfin recognize the abnormal mutant SOD1? Because we used IP-Dorfin and IP-mutant SOD1 for an ubiquitylating assay here, it is possible that Dorfin interacts with mutant SOD1 indirectly. Recently CHIP (carboxyl terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein), an U-box type E3, has been shown to interact with Hsp90 or Hsp70 and ubiquitylate unfolded proteins captured by these molecular chaperones in a selective manner, thus acting as a “quality control E3” (44McClellan A.J. Frydman J. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2001; 3: E51-E53Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 45Murata S. Minami Y. Minami M. Chiba T. Tanaka K. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 1133-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Likewise, because Dorfin can discriminate between the normal and abnormal status of SOD1 proteins, it can be regarded as another quality control E3. However, preliminary results showed that CHIP did not ubiquitylate mutant SOD1s (data not shown); therefore, Dorfin possesses a distinct way for recognition of the abnormality of SOD1. It is possible that a novel sequence within the C terminus of Dorfin may associate with a substrate-recognizing molecule(s) (corresponding to Hsp in CHIP) or facilitate a unique mechanism for trapping the target in a direct or indirect manner. Further studies should be designed to determine this mechanism, which should enhance our understanding of Dorfin function in vivo and its relationship to ALS pathogenesis. We thank Dr. J. Q. Trojanowski for helpful comments."

In polarized cells of secretory epithelia, NKCC1 is heavily expressed along the basolateral membrane, activated in response to secretagogues, and paramount for the transepithelial secretion of Cl− and water (2Haas M. Forbush III, B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 515-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). NKCC1-mediated Cl− secretion has been well documented in rat parotid gland (3Tanimura A. Kurihara K.

Physiol. 1990; 259: C557-C569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At least in shark rectal gland, the evidence is consistent with an indirect activation of NKCC1 upon agonist stimulation: secretagogues cause a drop in intracellular [Cl−] and volume via protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of apical chloride channels; in turn, low intracellular [Cl−] and low cell volume provide activation stimuli for the currently unidentified NKCC1 kinase(s) (2Haas M.

Our laboratory (9Lytle C. Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25438-25443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and others (10Kurihara K. Moore-Hoon M.L. Saitoh M. Turner R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C1184-C1193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have linked the phosphorylation of the intracellular N-terminal domain with NKCC1 activation. In the accompanying paper, Darman and Forbush (1Darman R.B. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37542-37550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) describe the phosphorylation of three residues in this regulatory domain, of which Thr184 and Thr189 are necessary for maximal sNKCC11 activation. Thr189 in particular is demonstrated as being essential for sNKCC1 up-regulation. The three phosphoacceptor sites reside in a 30-amino acid region of the N terminus that exhibits 80% homology between sodium-coupled cation chloride cotransporter isoforms and 97% homology within NKCC1 proteins in species ranging from shark to human (shark Thr184/Thr189 correspond to human Thr212/Thr217). This region of the N terminus also contains a protein phosphatase-1-binding site (RVXF), which is conserved across divergent species and thought to mediate regulated dephosphorylation (11Darman R.B. Flemmer A. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34359-34362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To date, most studies of NKCC regulation have been conducted in isolated tissue preparations, cell cultures, or cell-free systems utilizing [3H]benzmetanide binding,32P incorporation, or isotopic uptake. Although these studies have provided a wealth of information at the cellular and molecular levels, little is known about the phosphorylation state of NKCC in native tissue. To address this issue, we have developed a phospho-specific polyclonal antibody (anti-phospho-NKCC1 antibody R5) raised against the in vitro phosphorylated peptide corresponding to the regulatory domain. In this report, we demonstrate R5 specificity and sensitivity in recognizing the phosphorylated conserved threonines. We determine a positive correlation between NKCC1 activation and Thr184/Thr189 phosphorylation in sNKCC1-transfected HEK-293 cells using the R5 antibody. We also investigate in vivo NKCC1 activity and address the universality of this regulatory domain by examining R5 immunohistographs of shark rectal gland and several rat secretory tissues. These data provide a critical link between molecular regulation studies and the activation profile of NKCC1 in vivo. A 16-amino acid peptide, Tyrh208–Argh223-Lys (YYLRT*FGHNT*MDAVPRK) with an additional C-terminal lysine residue for coupling, was synthesized by the Keck Peptide Synthesis Facility at Yale University; the regulatory phosphothreonines Thr212 and Thr217 (in human NKCC1) were incorporated directly during synthesis. A rabbit antibody (anti-phospho-NKCC1 antibody R5; Pocono Rabbit Farms, Canadensis, PA) was raised against this peptide coupled to maleimidobenzoic acid-N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Sigma) using standard procedures. The anti-phospho-NKCC1 antibody will be referred to as R5 for the remainder of the paper. For immunofluorescence studies, R5 was subjected to positive and negative affinity purification using the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated kindred peptides coupled toN-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions. The specificity of R5 antisera for the immunizing peptide was measured using an ELISA format. As illustrated in Fig.1 (upper panel), R5 serum displayed >20-fold selectivity for the diphosphopeptide compared with the non-phosphorylated peptide. This high degree of selectivity enables a sensitive analysis of the phosphorylation state of the conserved threonines in situ and also Western blot analysis; for most purposes, the antibody can be effectively employed as diluted serum. Positive and negative affinity purification of the antibody further increased the phospho-specificity to >100-fold (Fig. 1, lower panel); the purified antibody was used for immunofluorescence analyses. Unnoticed until after the initial batch of R5 antibody had been produced, the second aspartate in this peptide was found to have been modified to an aspartimide during synthetic procedures; the unmodified peptide was subsequently synthesized for analytic and purification procedures. Fig. 1 shows that the R5 antibody had a slightly higher affinity for the modified peptide compared with the unmodified peptide. We speculate that the modification may have increased the immunogenicity of the Tyrh208–Argh223-Lys peptide. In any case, this antigen was quite successful; the second of two rabbits (R4, not discussed further here) also produced a high titer phospho-specific serum, with greater phospho-specificity, but less NKCC specificity, compared with R5. Several other antibodies were used to detect NKCC1 independent of its phosphorylation state. The T4 monoclonal antibody (12Lytle C., Xu, J.C. Biemesderfer D. Forbush III, B. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1496-C1505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the N1c polyclonal antibody (gift of Chris Lytle, University of California, Riverside, CA) (13McDaniel N. Lytle C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G1273-G1278PubMed Google Scholar) both recognize the C terminus of human NKCC1 in a wide range of species. J3, J4, and J7 are anti-NKCC1 monoclonal antibodies that are highly specific for the shark cotransporter (14Lytle C., Xu, J.C. Biemesderfer D. Haas M. Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25428-25437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); these were used to detect sNKCC1 in ex vivo perfused fixed gland sections, isolated shark rectal gland tubules, and sNKCC1-transfected HEK-293 cells. For determination of antibody affinity and phospho-specificity by ELISA, phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated peptides were covalently coupled toN-oxysuccinimide binding plates (DNA-Bind, Costar Corp.). Plates were blocked with 20 mm ethanolamine, pH 8.2; washed twice with wash buffer (PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% Triton X-100); and blocked with 7% milk in PBS in 0.1% Triton X-100. After washing once with wash buffer and sequential incubations with serially diluted sera and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody, the optical density was measured with a spectrophotometer using o-phenylenediamine as a substrate. For Western blotting, samples were subjected to Tricine/SDS gel electrophoresis (7.5 or 10%) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Blots were sequentially probed with primary and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Chemiluminescent substrate was detected using a cooled CCD camera. Lines of stably transfected HEK-293 cells were handled as described in the accompanying paper (1Darman R.B. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37542-37550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Following appropriate preincubations, cells were solubilized by one of two procedures. (a) Cells were lysed either in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2 (see Fig. 2), or in phosphatase inhibitory buffer (300 mm NaCl, 60 mm NaF, 10 mm EDTA, 30 mm Na2HPO4, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 40 mm HEPES, 0.2 mm NaVO4, and 0.5 μm calyculin A) (see Fig. 3), with both buffers containing 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors (1Darman R.B. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37542-37550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Lysate was centrifuged to remove insoluble material and diluted into SDS sample buffer. (b) Alternatively, cells were lysed in 1% SDS and 1 mH3PO4 and subsequently diluted into sample buffer for Western blotting or dot blotting. For reasons that are yet unclear, we consistently saw a higher level of background R5 signal on dot blots (see Figs. 5 and 6) and gels (data not shown) of samples stopped with H3PO4/SDS stop medium compared with that seen when cells were harvested in 1% Triton X-100 (see Figs.3 and 4).Figure 3Recognition of Thr184 and Thr189 mutants by the R5 antibody. sNKCC1- and vector-transfected HEK-293 cells were preincubated in low Cl− hypotonic medium (+) or high K+ medium (−) for 50 min prior to lysis in Triton X-100 with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. After centrifugation and dilution into SDS sample buffer, identical volumes of solubilized protein representing 6 mm2 of tissue culture monolayer were loaded. Coomassie Blue staining of blots showed ∼20% variation in protein levels among these samples; to correct for this variation, individual lanes in all three panels have been digitally corrected accordingly. The sNKCC1 mutants are described in the accompanying paper (1Darman R.B. Forbush B. J. Biol.

A second preincubation, for the times plotted on the abscissa, was carried out in 0Na-0K-130Cl hypertonic medium (red dashed lines, ●, Ο), low Cl− hypotonic medium (black solid lines, ▵), low Cl−medium (purple dotted lines, ▿), hypertonic medium (blue solid lines, ○), or basic medium (green dashed lines, ▾). In alternate rows of the plate, a 2-min 86Rb influx was then carried out in regular flux medium (basic medium with ∼1 μCi/ml 86Rb and 10−4m ouabain) (upper panels); or the wells were sucked dry, rapidly solubilized in 70 μl of H3PO4/SDS, and dot-blotted with the R5 antibody (lower panels).

Physiol. 1992; 262: C1009-C1017Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At specific time points following appropriate incubations, 200-μl aliquots of tubules were pelleted; resuspended in 100 μl of phosphatase inhibitory buffer containing 3% Triton X-100, 1 μm calyculin A, and a mixture of protease inhibitors; snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen; and stored at −80 °C. For NKCC1 immunoprecipitation, samples were thawed and centrifuged, and J4 antibody-Sepharose beads (15Lytle C. Forbush III, B. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C1009-C1017Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were added to the supernatant. After an overnight incubation at 4 °C with subsequent washing, samples were subjected to SDS gel electrophoresis with Western blotting as described above. 32P incorporation into proteins was analyzed on gels and blots using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) were anesthetized via intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg of body weight). Each animal was kept warm using a heated plate, and body temperature was monitored with a rectal thermometer. In most experiments, a polyvinyl catheter was introduced into the appropriate artery (common carotid for the parotid gland, thoracic for the trachea, and mesenteric for the colon), and the animals were infused with prewarmed Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate solution (140 mmNa+, 5.4 mm K+, 1.2 mmMg2+, 1.2 mm Ca2+, 124 mm Cl−, 21 mmHCO 3−, 2.4 mmHPO 42−, 0.6 mmH2PO 4−, pH 7.4; 300 mosmol/liter adjusted with mannitol). Agonists were added to the perfusate to stimulate cotransporter activity as explained in the figure legends for each particular tissue. For Western blot analysis of parotid tissue, the gland was removed and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen, pestle-ground tissue was placed in boiling SDS sample buffer. For organ fixation, periodate/lysine/paraformaldehyde fixative was perfused through the same catheter for 5–15 min (16McClean W. Nakane P.F. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1973; 22: 1077-1083Crossref Scopus (3173) Google Scholar). Tissues were removed from the animal and further fixed for 2–4 h at 4 °C. To achieve best fixation results, the trachea was also filled with fixative at 20 cm of H2O. Shark rectal glands were isolated from the animals, and each gland was perfused through its unique artery and treated as described for rat tissues. Small sections of fixed tissues were cryoprotected with 50% polyvinylpyrrolidone in 2.3 msucrose overnight at 4 °C. Tissue sections were then mounted on aluminum nails and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Semi-thin 0.5–1-μm sections were cut using a Reichert Ultracut E ultramicrotome fitted with a FC-4E cryoattachment. Sections were placed on coated slides (Superfrost Plus, Erie Scientific, Portsmouth, NH) and washed with PBS prior to antigen retrieval by incubating the tissues with 1% SDS for 5 min. After quenching with NH4Cl for 15 min, sections were blocked with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 10% goat serum in PBS, incubated for 1–2 h with the primary antibody, washed, and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate or Alexa dyes (Molecular Probes, Inc.). Sections were washed three times with PBS and mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA), and micrographs were taken with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope on Kodak Tmax 100 film (Eastman Kodak Co.) or using an Olympus Fluoview confocal microscope. In the accompanying paper (1Darman R.B. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37542-37550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), Darman and Forbush identify three phosphoacceptor threonines in an activation domain in the N terminus of shark NKCC1. In particular, phosphorylation of Thr184 and Thr189 is highlighted as a key element in NKCC1 cotransport activation. Because this region is well conserved both across species and between isoforms, it is an excellent candidate as a universal regulatory motif for NKCC. Thus, we prepared a diphosphorylated peptide corresponding to this region of the human NKCC1 sequence (Tyrh208–Argh223-Lys) and raised a polyclonal antibody (R5) using the keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated peptide as antigen. The specificity of R5 for phosphorylated NKCC is illustrated by the Western blot in Fig. 2. As shown here, R5 recognized a single protein of ∼180 kDa, corresponding to the Na-K-Cl cotransporter (see Fig. 3). HEK-293 cells transfected with shark or human NKCC showed a strong signal compared with native NKCC in HEK-293 cells transfected with vector alone. Cross-reactivity of the R5 antibody with other proteins was not detected in HEK-293 cells and is rarely seen in lysates of eukaryotic cells. To investigate the activation dependence of the R5 signal, we incubated NKCC1-transfected HEK-293 cells in low Cl− hypotonic medium (3 mm Cl− solution diluted 2-fold with water) or in high K+ medium (135 mm NaCl, 5 mm RbCl, 1 mmCaCl2/MgCl2, 1 mmNa2HPO4/Na2SO4, 15 mmNaHEPES, pH 7.4, and 10 mm K+) to activate or deactivate the transporter, respectively. As illustrated in Fig. 2, the antibody signal was severalfold greater in sNKCC1- and hNKCC1-transfected HEK-293 cells under activating conditions. As a further confirmation that the R5 signal is dependent upon phosphorylation of the cotransporter, the samples in this experiment were incubated at room temperature for 90 min following lysis of the cells to allow endogenous protein phosphatases to dephosphorylate NKCC1. As shown here, the R5 signal was almost completely eliminated by incubation in lysis buffer devoid of the protein phosphatase-1 inhibitor calyculin A. We examined various NKCC phosphorylation site mutants to determine whether R5 recognizes the monophosphorylated as well as the diphosphorylated regulatory domains. Fig.3 presents Western blots of transfected HEK-293 cells from such an experiment comparing vector alone, wild-type sNKCC1, and Thr184/Thr189 mutants under the activation and deactivation conditions described above. Total shark NKCC1 was indicated by J3 antibody binding (Fig. 3, middle panel); as shown here, the expression was similar for each of the constructs. For both Thr184 and Thr189 single mutants, the R5 signal was found to increase with activation (Fig. 3,upper panel), and although the level was clearly greater than in control HEK-293 cells, there was much less signal than for wild-type sNKCC1. The simplest explanation for this result is that the R5 antibody, although having the greatest affinity for the diphosphorylated regulatory domain, also has significant although lower affinity for the monophosphorylated forms. The J3 antibody consistently recognized two bands in transfected cells (Fig. 3, middle panel), and we presume that this is due to different degrees of glycosylation, possibly reflecting different subcellular compartmentalization. Only the upper of these two bands was phosphorylated upon activation, as demonstrated by R5 recognition (the T189D mutant may exhibit a small amount of another lower band). The identity of the R5-positive band of lesser mobility in deactivated cells is a puzzle. Our interpretation is that this signal is from the endogenous HEK-293 cell cotransporter, based on two observations. (a) There was little or no J3 signal at this position (this R5 signal was from the region between the two strong J3 bands, better seen in superimposition of reblotting experiments (data not shown)); and (b) the upper J3 band exhibited only a very small upward mobility shift upon activation of the transporter. Surprisingly, and somewhat at odds with this interpretation, the native HEK-293 cell cotransporter appeared to undergo a mobility shift upon phosphorylation, despite the fact that the amount of HEK-293 cell R5 signal did not increase much upon activation (Figs. 2 and 3 and discussion below). To analyze the phosphorylation state of sNKCC1 residues Thr184/Thr189 in their native cellular environment, we examined 32P incorporation and R5 binding in isolated shark rectal gland tubules preloaded with32Pi (1Darman R.B. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37542-37550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Tubules were activated by incubation either in hypertonic media or in isotonic media containing forskolin (to activate apical Cl− channels and to lower intracellular [Cl−] (8Lytle C. Forbush III, B. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C437-C448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) and calyculin A. Under both conditions, NKCC1 displayed a time-dependent increase of32P incorporation in the 195-kDa band of NKCC1 as detected by 32P phosphorimaging of samples subjected to gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Fig. 4 A); immunoprecipitation with the J4 antibody highlighted 32P phosphorylation of NKCC1 (Fig. 4 B). Using the R5 antibody, NKCC1 phosphorylation was readily detected even in the crude lysates (Fig.4 C). Fig. 4 (D–F) illustrate the quantitative relationship between the R5 signal and 32P incorporation. It is clear from these data that R5 binding varies linearly with32P incorporation within our measurements, both in crude lysates (Fig. 4, D and E) and in immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4 F). Thus, Thr184 and Thr189 are indicators of overall sNKCC1 phosphorylation under these conditions, providing rational support for the use of R5 as a quantitative tool. To further establish the relationship between phosphorylation and NKCC1 activation, we compared the effects of several activation media on the R5 signal and 86Rb influx. Fig.5 illustrates the results of an experiment, similar to that of Fig. 8 of the accompanying paper (1Darman R.B. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37542-37550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), in which the time course of activation and deactivation was determined in various media. Following preincubation of cells in a single 96-well plate for each cell line, alternate rows were either lysed in H3PO4/SDS for dot-blot analysis (possible because only a single band was detected by R5; Fig. 1) or subjected to a 1-min 86Rb influx assay. It is readily seen in Fig. 5that function mirrors phosphorylation, i.e. activating and deactivating conditions had similar effects on both measurements (a small discrepancy between phosphorylation and flux for hNKCC1 cells in low Cl− hypotonic medium transferred to 0Na-0K-130Cl hypertonic medium was seen in two of four such experiments). Human and shark NKCC1 exhibited similar behavior, except that hNKCC1 was less activated by the hypertonic sucrose medium. We have used similar experiments to answer a question regarding the mec"

While Scar/WAVE proteins are thought to be involved in lamellipodia protrusion, the hematopoietic WASP has been implicated in various actin-based processes such as chemotaxis, podosome formation, and phagocytosis. Here we show that the ubiquitously expressed N-WASP is essential for actin assembly at the surface of endomembranes induced as a consequence of increased phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PIP2) levels. This process resulting in the motility of intracellular vesicles at the tips of actin comets involved the recruitment of the Src homology 3 (SH3)-SH2 adaptor proteins Nck and Grb2 as well as of WASP interacting protein (WIP). Reconstitution of vesicle movement in N-WASP-defective cells by expression of various N-WASP mutant proteins revealed three independent domains capable of interaction with the vesicle surface, of which both the WH1 and the polyproline domains contributed significantly to N-WASP recruitment and/or activation. In contrast, the direct interaction of N-WASP with the Rho-GTPase Cdc42 was not required for reconstitution of vesicle motility. Our data reveal a distinct cellular phenotype for N-WASP loss of function, which adds to accumulating evidence that the proposed link between actin and membrane dynamics may, at least partially, be reflected by the actin-based movement of vesicles through the cytoplasm.

Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein WASP interacting protein Cdc42/Rac-interactive-binding phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase green fluorescent protein WASP binding domain The dynamic turnover of actin filaments is required for multiple processes as diverse as cell migration and cytokinesis. De novo nucleation of actin filaments is most prominently catalyzed by the Arp2/3 complex, whose activity is regulated by various proteins (1Cooper J.A. Wear M.A. Weaver A.M. Cell. 2001; 107: 703-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Potent stimulators of the actin-nucleating activity of the Arp2/3 complex are members of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP)1/Scar family, which have been implicated in a variety of cellular processes (2Takenawa T. Miki H. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1801-1809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The hematopoietic WASP and the ubiquitously expressed N-WASP can both bind directly to the Rho-GTPase Cdc42 through their CRIB (Cdc42/Rac-interactive-binding) domain (3Aspenstrom P. Lindberg U.

Both proteins are therefore thought to serve key effector functions in the signaling of this small GTPase to the actin cytoskeleton (5Caron E. Curr. Opin. Cell.

In vitroexperiments have demonstrated that the auto-inhibitory conformation of N-WASP can be released upon interaction with both Cdc42 and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PIP2) (6Rohatgi R., Ho, H.Y.

While cell lines from N-WASP knockout mice have confirmed the requirement of this protein for the actin-based motility of Shigella flexneri or Vaccinia virus, the cellular function of N-WASP has remained unclear (9Lommel S.

It has been shown previously that N-WASP can localize to the surface of endo- and lysosomal vesicles in Xenopus oocyte extracts (11Taunton J. Rowning B.A. Coughlin M.L., Wu, M. Moon R.T.

Interestingly, the endocytic GTPase dynamin has recently been demonstrated to be recruited to the actin tails induced by PIP5K (16Orth J.D. Krueger E.W. Cao H. McNiven M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar,17Lee E. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Because this GTPase can link to N-WASP via proteins such as Grb2 or syndapin, it has been proposed that this type of actin comet formation may be regulated by N-WASP-mediated activation of the Arp2/3 complex (14Rozelle A.L. Machesky L.M. Yamamoto M. Driessens M.H. Insall R.H. Roth M.G. Luby-Phelps K. Marriott G. Hall A. Yin H.L. Curr.

In addition we demonstrate that the molecular pathway leading to recruitment and activation of WASP/N-WASP involves multiple proteins including SH2/SH3 adaptors and WIP. The murine WIP cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR on RNA derived from brain of adult C57BL/6 mice using primers 5′-CTACCCAAGATGCCTGTCCC-3′ and 5′-GAAGAGCAGGCAAAGATCACC-3′. The GFP-tagged expression construct was prepared by cloning of murine WIP cDNA into pEGFP-C3-vector (CLONTECH). GFP-tagged full-length N-WASP and a subset of mutants have been described (9Lommel S. Benesch S. Rottner K. Franz T. Wehland J. Kuhn R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 850-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 4 A). Additional mutants used in this study corresponding to the residues of murine N-WASP again indicated in the table in Fig. 4 A were amplified by PCR and fused into pEGFP-C1-vector (CLONTECH). Expression was verified by Western blotting using a polyclonal antiserum raised against enhanced green fluorescent protein. The cDNAs for human WASP, which were cloned into pEGFP-C1-vector (CLONTECH) and the murine, Myc-tagged PIP5KIα′ expression construct were kindly provided by Laura Machesky (Birmingham, UK) (14Rozelle A.L.

The Nck1 point mutations, Nck1-W143K and Nck1-R308K were introduced into CB6-GFP-Nck1 using the QuikChange* Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). The fidelity of all constructs was verified by sequencing. N-WASPdel/del and their respective parental fibroblast cell lines were grown as described (9Lommel S. Benesch S. Rottner K. Franz T. Wehland J. Kuhn R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 850-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) and transfected using FuGENE6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 12–24 h according to the manufacturer's instructions. For immunolabelings, cells grown on acid-washed glass coverslips were fixed with formaldehyde (4%) for 20 min in phosphate-buffered saline and extracted with a mixture of formaldehyde (4%) and Triton X-100 (0.1%) for 1 min. Indirect immunofluorescence was carried out essentially as described (22Herzog M. Draeger A. Ehler E. Small J.V. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: a Laboratory Handbook. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1994: 355-360Google Scholar). Polyclonal N-WASP antiserum was kindly provided by Hiroaki Miki (Tokyo, Japan). As secondary reagent we used Alexa-Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies, which were routinely mixed with Alexa 594-phalloidin (both Molecular Probes) to stain filamentous actin. Live cells were observed with an open, heated chamber (Warner Instruments) mounted on an inverted microscope (Axiovert 135TV, Zeiss) equipped with computer-controlled shutters (Optilas) in the transmitted and epifluorescence light paths to minimize radiation damage to the cells. Images of fixed and live samples were acquired with a back-illuminated, cooled charge-coupled-device camera (Princeton Instruments) driven by IPLab software and processed on Macintosh G4 computers using IPLab, Scion Image 1.62c and PhotoShop 5.0.2 software. Vesicle speed was measured in N-WASPflox/flox fibroblasts co-transfected with PIP5K and GFP-actin by tracking the paths of 102 individual vesicles in seven cells using the Dynamic Imaging Analysis System (DIAS, Solltech Inc.). Reconstitution efficiency of actin tail formation in N-WASPdel/del fibroblasts was assessed by co-expression of different N-WASP or WASP constructs with PIP5K and counting of the number of fluorescent cells showing actin tails. Efficiency of actin tail formation in N-WASPflox/flox cells was determined as in N-WASPdel/del cells except that PIP5K was co-expressed with GFP-actin to identify transfected cells. More than 100 cells from at least three independent experiments were photographed and analyzed for each construct. Statistical analyses were carried out using Microsoft Excel 2001 and Minitab 10.5 software. Transfection of N-WASPflox/flox precursor cell lines expressing functional N-WASP (9Lommel S. Benesch S. Rottner K. Franz T. Wehland J. Kuhn R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 850-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) with PIP5K caused the formation of multiple actin tails in 89 ± 2% of the transfected cells (see Fig. 4 B) characterized by strong accumulation of endogenous N-WASP (Fig. 1 A). However, no single actin tail was detectable in >300 N-WASP-defective cells (N-WASPdel/del) (9Lommel S. Benesch S. Rottner K. Franz T. Wehland J. Kuhn R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 850-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) upon expression of PIP5K (Fig.1 B). In contrast, co-expression of this enzyme with full-length N-WASP fused to GFP restored the formation of actin tails in 88 ± 2% of transfected N-WASPdel/del cells (see also Fig. 4 B), now being tipped by ectopically expressed N-WASP (Fig. 1 C). In addition, co-expression of PIP5K with GFP-actin in N-WASPflox/flox cells followed by video microscopy showed that the formation of PIP5K-induced actin tails reflected the rapid rocketing motility of intracellular membranes, which are thought to include endocytic and/or Golgi-derived vesicles (14Rozelle A.L. Machesky L.M. Yamamoto M. Driessens M.H. Insall R.H. Roth M.G. Luby-Phelps K. Marriott G. Hall A. Yin H.L. Curr.

Actin comets in N-WASPflox/flox cells had an average speed of 10 ± 2 μm min−1 (n = 102). No such motility was observed in N-WASP-defective cells co-transfected with PIP5K and GFP-actin (supplemental video 1 at http://www.jbc.org). As with PIP5K expression, N-WASPflox/flox fibroblasts treated with 10 nmphorbol myristate acetate (12Merrifield C.J. Moss S.E. Ballestrem C. Imhof B.A. Giese G. Wunderlich I. Almers W. Nat. Cell.

Biol. 2001; 11: 1136-1141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) also developed multiple actin tails, whereas N-WASPdel/del cells did not (not shown), suggesting a more general requirement for N-WASP in actin-based endosome movement. To gain more insight into the molecular pathways leading to recruitment of N-WASP onto the surface of these actin filament-nucleating endomembranes, we co-expressed PIP5K with various GFP constructs and/or analyzed PIP5K-induced actin tails by immunolabeling. We found a strong phosphotyrosine signal at the tips of actin tails and incorporation of the Arp2/3 complex into these tails (not shown) as demonstrated previously (14Rozelle A.L. Machesky L.M. Yamamoto M. Driessens M.H. Insall R.H. Roth M.G. Luby-Phelps K. Marriott G. Hall A. Yin H.L. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 311-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). In addition, the SH3-SH2 adaptor proteins Nck1 (not shown), Nck2 (Fig. 1 D), and Grb2 (Fig. 1 F) as well as WIP (Fig. 1 E) were recruited to vesicle surfaces. WIP was also detected along actin tails, albeit at reduced levels relative to the tips. These data suggest that the recruitment of N-WASP, which is essential for actin-based vesicle rocketing, may be accomplished by a pathway similar to that occurring at the surface of Vaccinia virus (21Scaplehorn N. Holmstrom A. Moreau V. Frischknecht F. Reckmann I. Way M. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 740-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 23Frischknecht F. Way M. Trends Cell. Biol. 2001; 11: 30-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Interestingly, pinosomes induced by constitutively active ADP ribosylation factor 6 recruit N-WASP and Grb2, but not Nck adaptor proteins (15Schafer D.A. D'Souza-Schorey C. Cooper J.A. Traffic. 2000; 1: 896-907Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). However, the reason for this difference is currently unclear. Vaccinia virus usurps host cell receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathways, which involve the recruitment and activation of N-WASP and the Arp2/3 complex via Nck and WIP (18Frischknecht F. Moreau V. Rottger S. Gonfloni S. Reckmann I. Superti-Furga G. Way M. Nature. 1999; 401: 926-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 19Moreau V. Frischknecht F. Reckmann I. Vincentelli R. Rabut G. Stewart D. Way M. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). While both proteins are also recruited to the surface of S. flexneri, neither Nck nor WIP seem to be required for the actin-based motility of this pathogen. In contrast to Vaccinia virus, the recruitment of WIP to the Shigella surface is mediated by N-WASP and the positioning of Nck might involve both WIP and N-WASP (19Moreau V. Frischknecht F. Reckmann I. Vincentelli R. Rabut G. Stewart D. Way M. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). These observations have demonstrated that recruitment of WIP and Nck can occur both upstream and downstream of N-WASP, depending on the biological system investigated (23Frischknecht F. Way M. Trends Cell. Biol. 2001; 11: 30-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Therefore we tested if Nck and WIP are recruited to PIP5K-induced vesicle surfaces in the absence of functional N-WASP. Co-expression of GFP-tagged Nck or WIP with PIP5K in N-WASPdel/del fibroblasts and subsequent video microscopy revealed that in the absence of functional N-WASP, both Nck (Fig.2 A) and WIP (Fig.2 D) are recruited to PIP2-induced vesicles, which under these conditions were passively floating in the cytoplasm due to the lack of actin-based motility. To test if the recruitment of Nck to the surface of these vesicles depends on its direct interaction with WIP and/or with a phosphotyrosine signal, we made use of specific point mutations within Nck known to eliminate ligand binding of the respective SH2 or SH3 domains (24Tanaka M. Gupta R. Mayer B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6829-6837Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Nck binds to WIP through its second SH3 domain (25Anton I.M., Lu, W. Mayer B.J. Ramesh N. Geha R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20992-20995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Therefore we tested if a GFP-tagged Nck1 mutant incapable of ligand interaction through its second SH3 domain (Nck1-W143K) could still be recruited in N-WASP-defective fibroblasts. Nck1-W143K targeted to these vesicles similar to wild-type Nck1 (Fig.2 B), whereas a Nck1 mutant harboring an inactive SH2 domain (Nck1-R308K) (24Tanaka M. Gupta R. Mayer B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6829-6837Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) did not (Fig. 2 C). These data indicate that the recruitment of Nck occurs independently of its interaction with both N-WASP and WIP but requires interaction with phosphotyrosine residues of unknown origin via its SH2 domain. The conclusion that WIP can be recruited to vesicles without interaction with N-WASP (see Fig.2 D) is further corroborated by the observations that a WIP mutant lacking the WBD, WIPΔWBD (19Moreau V. Frischknecht F. Reckmann I. Vincentelli R. Rabut G. Stewart D. Way M. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), is also recruited to the tips of PIP5K-induced actin tails in precursor cells (Fig 2 E) and to non-motile vesicles in N-WASP-defective cells (not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that at the surface of intracellular membranes stimulated to nucleate actin filaments by PIP5K activity Nck and WIP are placed upstream in a pathway leading to N-WASP recruitment as seen in the Vaccinia system but not in Shigella (23Frischknecht F. Way M. Trends Cell. Biol. 2001; 11: 30-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The observation that Vaccinia virus surfaces failed to label for Nck or WIP in the absence of N-WASP (10Snapper S.B. Takeshima F. Anton I. Liu C.H. Thomas S.M. Nguyen D. Dudley D. Fraser H. Purich D. Lopez-Ilasaca M. Klein C. Davidson L. Bronson R. Mulligan R.C. Southwick F. Geha R. Goldberg M.B. Rosen F.S. Hartwig J.H. Alt F.W. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2001; 3: 897-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) substantiated the conclusion that these proteins can only be recruited to the virus as a trimolecular complex (23Frischknecht F. Way M. Trends Cell. Biol. 2001; 11: 30-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Although Nck and WIP are clearly targeted to PIP5K-induced vesicle membranes in N-WASPdel/del cells, we do not exclude that in the presence of N-WASP a direct interaction of this protein with WIP or Nck stabilizes their recruitment owing to the formation of intact trimolecular complexes. Nck is not the only SH3-SH2 adaptor protein located at these endomembranes because Grb2 was also targeted both to the tips of actin tails induced by PIP5K expression in N-WASPflox/floxcells (Fig. 1 F) and to the surfaces of non-motile vesicles in the absence of functional N-WASP (Fig. 2 F). This suggests a potential role for Grb2 in N-WASP recruitment and/or activation on vesicle membranes, which fits the observations that this adaptor protein can enhance N-WASP-mediated Arp2/3 activation in vitro (8Carlier M.F. Nioche P. Broutin-L'Hermite I. Boujemaa R., Le Clainche C. Egile C. Garbay C. Ducruix A. Sansonetti P. Pantaloni D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21946-21952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and promote the actin-based motility of Vaccinia virus (21Scaplehorn N. Holmstrom A. Moreau V. Frischknecht F. Reckmann I. Way M. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 740-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Co-expression of PIP5K with a variety of N-WASP mutants (9Lommel S. Benesch S. Rottner K. Franz T. Wehland J. Kuhn R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 850-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 A) in N-WASP-defective cells and subsequent analysis by video microscopy enabled us to assess the domains required either for reconstitution of motility and/or for recruitment (Figs.3 and 4). Full-length N-WASP reconstituted actin tail formation in N-WASP-defective cells as shown in Fig. 1 C. Video microscopy of N-WASPdel/delcells expressing GFP-N-WASP confirmed that a significant number of fluorescent spots visualized in the GFP channel were highly motile (Fig. 3 and supplemental video 2 at http://www.jbc.org) corresponding to vesicles, which had regained actin-based motility by recruiting GFP-N-WASP onto their surfaces. Co-expression of a GFP-tagged mutant protein lacking the WA domain with PIP5K did not restore this type of motility. Instead, this mutant just localized to non-motile vesicles (Fig. 3 and supplemental video 2 at http://www.jbc.org), which proves the requirement for N-WASP to interact with and activate the Arp2/3 complex to restore vesicle motility (14Rozelle A.L. Machesky L.M. Yamamoto M. Driessens M.H. Insall R.H. Roth M.G. Luby-Phelps K. Marriott G. Hall A. Yin H.L. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 311-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Fig.4 A summarizes the results obtained upon co-expression of PIP5K with WASP, WAVE2, or various N-WASP mutants in N-WASPdel/del cells. In support of the observation that WIP can target to vesicles in the absence of functional N-WASP, we found recruitment of the WH1 domain (Fig. 4 A), probably mediated by interaction with WIP (19Moreau V. Frischknecht F. Reckmann I. Vincentelli R. Rabut G. Stewart D. Way M. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), supportive of a recruitment mechanism reminiscent of the sequence of events occurring at the surface of Vaccinia virus (23Frischknecht F. Way M. Trends Cell. Biol. 2001; 11: 30-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). However, two regions of N-WASP were recruited to PIP5K-induced vesicles in addition to the WH1 domain, showing that besides the potential Nck/WIP/N-WASP cascade, there are alternative mechanisms to recruit N-WASP in this system. First, a construct harboring the basic and CRIB domains (B-GBD) and incapable of targeting to Vaccinia (19Moreau V. Frischknecht F. Reckmann I. Vincentelli R. Rabut G. Stewart D. Way M. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) was recruited to vesicles (Fig. 4 A). More detailed analyses revealed that the region required for binding is located within the N-terminal half of B-GBD because residues 156–226 were still recruited to vesicle surfaces, but a construct comprising residues 226–274 (Fig.4 A) was not. Whether the targeting to vesicles of residues 156–226 is mediated by direct interaction with PIP2, Cdc42, or both is currently being investigated. In an earlier study, we have refined one recruitment domain of N-WASP to the Shigella surface to the latter residues 226–274 (9Lommel S. Benesch S. Rottner K. Franz T. Wehland J. Kuhn R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 850-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The conclusion that the same domain can by itself not target to vesicles was corroborated by the observation that the construct Δ(WH1-CRIB) (residues 226–501) was not able to restore vesicle movement, although it can mediate actin tail formation on Shigella (9Lommel S. Benesch S. Rottner K. Franz T. Wehland J. Kuhn R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 850-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Secondly, a construct corresponding to the polyproline domain (residues 268–393) showed strong recruitment to vesicle surfaces, although a similar construct has again been demonstrated to be absent from the Vaccinia virus (19Moreau V. Frischknecht F. Reckmann I. Vincentelli R. Rabut G. Stewart D. Way M. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Interestingly, recruitment of both WASP and N-WASP to the T-cell-antigen-presenting cell contact site has also been shown to be mediated by the polyproline domain (26Cannon J.L. Labno C.M. Bosco G. Seth A. McGavin M.H. Siminovitch K.A. Rosen M.K. Burkhardt J.K. Immunity. 2001; 15: 249-259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), but as opposed to antigen-presenting cells, this domain is not essential for recruitment of N-WASP to vesicles (see the ΔpolyPro mutant in Fig.4 A). Taken together, although three independent regions were able to target to vesicle surfaces, none of them was essential for N-WASP-based reconstitution of vesicle motility (see Fig. 4 A), although they contributed to actin tail formation to variable degrees (Fig.4 B and see below). In addition, although the targeting of N-WASP to the surfaces of both Shigella and Vaccinia virus stimulates a type of actin-based motility highly reminiscent of the actin “tailing” observed on endosomal vesicles, the mechanism of recruitment to these vesicles still differs from the one evolved by either pathogen. In addition to qualitative analysis of recruitment and the mere capability of various N-WASP constructs to restore vesicle motility upon co-expression with PIP5K, we have assessed the efficiency of restoring actin tail formation with selected constructs, the summary of which is presented in Fig. 4 B. This analysis was done by determining the percentage of cells that had developed actin tails upon co-expression of PIP5K with various N-WASP constructs. Our analysis revealed that 88% of N-WASP-defective cells co-expressing GFP-tagged full-length N-WASP and PIP5K developed actin tails, which was virtually identical to the tail formation efficiency in N-WASPflox/flox cells (89 ± 2% of PIP5K-transfectants, Fig. 4 B). In contrast, the percentage of cells with actin tails was reduced by 24% (to 69 ± 4%) and by 34% (to 59 ± 6%) when GFP-tagged ΔWH1- and Δpolyproline-N-WASP were used, respectively (Fig. 4 B). These data suggest that both WH1- and polyproline-dependent interactions of N-WASP, e.g. with WIP and SH3 domain-containing proteins, contribute to recruitment and/or activation of N-WASP to stimulate actin-based motility at endosomal membranes. The decrease in actin tail formation efficiency upon expression of the mutant lacking the polyproline domain may not only be a result of the lack of interaction with SH3 ligands because the direct interaction of this domain with profilin I has previously been shown to be important for Shigella motility (27Mimuro H. Suzuki T. Suetsugu S. Miki H. Takenawa T. Sasakawa C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28893-28901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The contribution of the polyproline domain of N-WASP for recruitment of the profilin-actin complex and the general role of profilin for actin-mediated vesicle movement is under current investigation. Significantly, deletion of both the WH1 and the polyproline domains (ΔWH1ΔpolyPro) completely abolished recruitment to vesicles and reconstitution of actin tail formation (Fig. 4). These data demonstrate that the presence of either one of these two domains is essential but not necessarily sufficient (see ΔWH1-CRIB) for reconstitution of vesicle motility (see also quantifications in Fig. 4 B). As opposed to ΔWH1- or Δpolyproline-N-WASP, a mutant lacking the basic and the CRIB domains (ΔB-CRIB) required for PIP2 and Cdc42 binding, respectively (6Rohatgi R., Ho, H.Y. Kirschner M.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1299-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 7Prehoda K.E. Scott J.A. Mullins R.D. Lim W.A. Science. 2000; 290: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), restored actin tail formation with the same efficiency as full-length N-WASP (86 ± 2% and 88 ± 2%, respectively), although a construct corresponding to the deleted domain (B-CRIB) was by itself able to recruit to vesicle surfaces (see above). Additionally, expression of a point mutant of N-WASP (H208D) shown previously to be incapable of binding to GTP-Cdc42 (9Lommel S. Benesch S. Rottner K. Franz T. Wehland J. Kuhn R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 850-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 28Miki H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Takenawa T. Nature. 1998; 391: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar) restored the formation of actin tails with an efficiency (79 ± 5%) similar to ΔB-CRIB and full-length (Fig. 4 B). Hence, we conclude that direct interaction of N-WASP with PIP2 via the basic domain or with Cdc42 does not contribute to its recruitment to and/or activation at these endomembranes. The C-terminal part of the GBD corresponding approximately to residues 220–274 is known to interact with the cofilin homology domain (29Kim A.S. Kakalis L.T. Abdul-Manan N. Liu G.A. Rosen M.K. Nature. 2000; 404: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar), an interaction that is thought to contribute to the stabilization of the inactive “closed” state of N-WASP (7Prehoda K.E. Scott J.A. Mullins R.D. Lim W.A. Science. 2000; 290: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Interestingly, while B-GBD (residues 156–274) recruited to vesicle surfaces, fusion of the exact same domain to the WA domain was sufficient to abolish recruitment (see Fig. 4 and above), presumably because the mutant stayed “locked” in its inactive conformation. This construct (ΔWH1ΔpolyPro) as well as an N-terminally truncated version of it (mini-N-WASP), which corresponds to a mutant that can be “unlocked” from its inactive state by PIP2 and Cdc42 in vitro (7Prehoda K.E. Scott J.A. Mullins R.D. Lim W.A. Science. 2000; 290: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), did not localize to vesicles (Fig. 4 A), although for the latter construct, reconstitution of actin tail formation on the surface ofShigella proved its functionality in vivo (9Lommel S. Benesch S. Rottner K. Franz T. Wehland J. Kuhn R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 850-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Finally, the fact that Δ(WH1-CRIB) did not reconstitute vesicle rocketing led us to speculate that the binding of N-WASP to polyproline ligands cannot by itself release the intramolecular interaction. Vesicle motility could be restored by expression of GFP-tagged WASP (Figs. 3and 4) to the same extent (84 ± 5%) (Fig. 4 B) as full-length N-WASP, suggesting that in hematopoietic cells, N-WASP, and WASP may be able to compensate for each other in driving this type of endosome motility. This proves the lack of WASP expression in N-WASPdel/del cells, which is in line with the fact that we were unable to detect WASP expression by Western blotting in both parental and N-WASP-defective cell lines (supplemental material at http://www.jbc.org). These observations also rule out that the filopodia formed in N-WASPdel/del cells (9Lommel S. Benesch S. Rottner K. Franz T. Wehland J. Kuhn R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 850-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) are due to compensatory WASP expression. As opposed to WASP, overexpression of WAVE2 with PIP5K did not restore actin tail formation in N-WASPdel/del cells (Fig. 4 A) and GFP-tagged WAVE2 did not localize to PIP2-induced vesicles in these cells or co-localize with N-WASP at the tips of actin tails in precursor cells (not shown). In summary, our results demonstrate a distinct cellular phenotype for the loss of functional N-WASP. However, at present we do not know whether this phenotype is responsible for the early embryonic lethality of N-WASP−/− mice, although it would certainly be compatible with the broad abnormalities observed in these embryos (9Lommel S. Benesch S. Rottner K. Franz T. Wehland J. Kuhn R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 850-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar,10Snapper S.B. Takeshima F. Anton I. Liu C.H. Thomas S.M. Nguyen D. Dudley D.

Biol. 2001; 13: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 31Jeng R.L. Welch M.D. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R691-R694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), as exemplified recently by the description of the association of dynamin with PIP5K-induced actin tails or those induced by Listeria monocytogenes (16Orth J.D.

A. 2002; 99: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The finding that N-WASP is essential for PIP2-induced vesicle motility adds further significance to the interactions of this protein with intersectins or syndapins, which have already implicated coupling of actin nucleation to endocytic processes (32Schafer D.A. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 2002; 14: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The involvement of N-WASP in the insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4-vesicles to the plasma membranes of adipocytes might reflect just one specific example for the engagement of actin polymerization in vesicle traffic (33Kanzaki M. Watson R.T. Khan A.H. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49331-49336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that the molecular machinery that underlies membrane ruffling also drives (macro)pinosome rocketing (12Merrifield C.J. Moss S.E. Ballestrem C. Imhof B.A. Giese G. Wunderlich I. Almers W. Nat. Cell. Biol. 1999; 1: 72-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In contrast to N-WASP, WAVE2 is absent from the surfaces of PIP2-induced vesicles but is recruited to the tips of lamellipodia as previously described for WAVE1 (34Hahne P. Sechi A. Benesch S. Small J.V. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). These observations indicate clear differences in the pathways leading to actin filament assembly at the plasma membrane as compared with that at certain endomembranes.

https://openalex.org/W2027709863,"MET is a receptor protein-tyrosine kinase (RPTK) for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which is a multifunctional cytokine controlling cell growth, morphogenesis, and motility. MET overexpression has been identified in a variety of human cancers. Oncogenic missense mutations of the tyrosine kinase domain of the MET gene have been identified in human papillary renal cell carcinomas. In this study, RanBPM, also known as RanBP9, is identified as a novel interacting protein of MET through yeast two-hybrid screen. RanBPM contains a conserved SPRY (repeats in splA and RyR) domain. We demonstrate that RanBPM can interact with MET in vitro and in vivo, and the interaction can be strengthened by HGF stimulation. RanBPM interacts with the tyrosine kinase domain of MET through its SPRY domain. We show that RanBPM can induce GTP-Ras association and Erk phosphorylation and elevate serum response element-luciferase (SRE-LUC) expression, indicating that RanBPM can activate the Ras-Erk-SRE pathway. We demonstrate that RanBPM, which itself is not a guanine exchange protein, stimulates Ras activation by recruiting Sos. On the cellular level, A704 cells, a human renal carcinoma cell line, transfected with RanBPM exhibit increased migration ability.

The autocatalytic degradation product is a cell surface 44-kDa fragment of MT1-MMP (Gly285–Val582) in which the ectodomain consists of only the linker, hemopexin C domain and the stalk segment found before the transmembrane sequence. In the collagenases, hemopexin C domain exosites bind native collagen, which is required for triple helicase activity during collagen cleavage. Here we investigated the collagen binding properties and the role of the hemopexin C domain of MT1-MMP and of the 44-kDa MT1-MMP ectodomain in collagenolysis. Recombinant proteins, MT1-LCD (Gly285–Cys508), consisting of the linker and the hemopexin C domain, and MT1-CD (Gly315–Cys508), which consists of the hemopexin C domain only, were found to bind native type I collagen but not gelatin. Functionally, MT1-LCD inhibited collagen-induced MMP2 activation in fibroblasts, suggesting that interactions between collagen and endogenous MT1-MMP directly stimulate the cellular activation of pro-MMP2. MT1-LCD, but not MT1-CD, also blocked the cleavage of native type I collagen by MT1-MMP in vitro, indicating an important role for the MT1-MMP linker region in triple helicase activity. Similarly, soluble MT1-LCD, but not MT1-CD or peptide analogs of the MT1-MMP linker, reduced the invasion of type I collagen matrices by MDA-MB-231 cells as did the expression of recombinant 44-kDa MT1-MMP on the cell surface. Together, these studies demonstrate that generation of the 44-kDa MT1-MMP autolysis product regulates collagenolytic activity and subsequent invasive potential, suggesting a novel feedback mechanism for the control of pericellular proteolysis.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 837-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the synthesis and degradation of type I collagen is tightly regulated. Disruptions in this homeostasis can lead to diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis, scleroderma, arthritis, and osteoporosis, which, if untreated, can result in loss of tissue function and integrity. In a number of cancer cells, the capacity to degrade type I collagen and invade through type I collagen matrices often correlates with metastatic potential (2Egeblad M. Werb Z. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 161-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (5079) Google Scholar), a characteristic that is as important for the local dissemination of tumor cells as type IV collagen degradation and basement membrane penetration is for metastasis (3Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Yu A.E. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2001; 11: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Despite the importance of maintaining correct collagen homeostasis in tissues, the proteases responsible for type I collagen degradation in vivo remain unclear. An intracellular pathway may play an important role in collagen degradation (4Overall C.M. Sodek J. Davidovitch Z. Biological Mechanisms of Tooth Eruption and Root Resorption. EBSCO Media, Birmingham, Alabama1988: 303-312Google Scholar) that, in bone, utilizes the cysteine protease cathepsin K at low pH (5Saftig P. Hunziker E. Wehmeyer O. Jones S. Boyde A. Rommerskirch W.

Extracellularly, fibrillar type I collagen may be degraded at neutral pH by several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs),1 a 24-member family of zinc-dependent endopeptidases in humans (2Egeblad M.

Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 151: 79-120PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas the majority of MMPs are secreted as latent zymogens, MT-MMPs, the largest subgroup of MMPs, are membrane-anchored by the presence of a type I transmembrane sequence and cytoplasmic tail (MT1-, MT2-, MT3-, and MT5-MMP) or by glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage (MT4- and MT6-MMP) (14Overall C.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 151: 79-120PubMed Google Scholar). MT1-MMP is activated intracellularly by proprotein convertase-dependent and -independent pathways (15Yana I. Weiss S.J. Mol. Biol.

Gene (Amst.). 1995; 155: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The importance of MT1-MMP is indicated by its requirement for the invasion of endothelial and cancer cells through type I collagen matrices (18Galvez B.G. Matias-Roman S. Albar J.P. Sanchez-Madrid F.

Moreover, mice deficient in MT1-MMP developed severe aberrations in type I collagen-abundant tissues, such as bone and skin, and the mice exhibited arthritis and scleroderma (21Holmbeck K. Bianco P. Caterina J. Yamada S. Kromer M. Kuznetsov S.A. Mankani M. Robey P.G. Poole A.R. Pidoux I. Ward J.M. Birkedal-Hansen H.

In humans, homoallelic loss-of-function mutations in the MMP2 gene result in excessive bone resorption and arthritis (23Martignetti J.A. Aqeel A.A. Sewairi W.A. Boumah C.E. Kambouris M. Mayouf S.A.

This condition resembles the phenotype of the MT1-MMP knockout mouse, supporting the close functional connection of MMP2 and MT1-MMP in regulating pericellular collagen homeostasis in mice and humans.Native type I collagen consists of two α1(I) chains and one α2(I) chain interwound in a right-handed triple helix that is resistant to cleavage by most proteinases at neutral pH with the exception of the MMP collagenases (14Overall C.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 151: 79-120PubMed Google Scholar). Because the active site of collagenolytic MMPs can only accommodate a single α-chain, cleavage of the three α-chains occurs sequentially at the single collagenase-susceptible site, Gly775-Ile/Leu776, to generate ¾ and ¼ collagen fragments. To achieve this, the collagen helix must be initially unwound by a triple helicase mechanism in order to expose the scissile bonds. This critical step requires the presence of collagen-binding exosites (14Overall C.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 151: 79-120PubMed Google Scholar), in addition to elements within the active site (24Knauper V. Patterson M.L. Gomis-Ruth F.X. Smith B. Lyons A. Docherty A.J. Murphy G. Eur. J.

Brentani R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13763-13767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the 35-amino acid residue linker of MT1-MMP is twice the length of other collagenase linkers (18 residues); however, the significance of this and its role in collagen cleavage have yet to be examined.The regulation of MT1-MMP activity, MMP2 activation and pericellular type I collagen levels is complex. In a variety of cells, stimulation by fibrillar type I collagen has been shown to increase the cell surface expression of MT1-MMP and induce the cellular activation of pro-MMP2 (36Azzam H.S.

Concomitant with increased MT1-MMP expression and MMP2 activation is the autocatalytic processing of MT1-MMP at Gly284–Gly285 to shed the catalytic domain from the hemopexin C domain, which is retained on the cell membrane (40Ellerbroek S.M.

Hence, the ectodomain of the residual 44-kDa MT1-MMP fragment (Gly285–Val582) on the cell surface consists of the linker, hemopexin C domain, and stalk segment only (see Fig. 1 A, ii) and thus is catalytically inactive. The significance of the 44-kDa MT1-MMP in vivo is not clear. In addition to being present following cell binding to type I collagen, the 44-kDa MT1-MMP has also been detected on the surface of tumor cells (40Ellerbroek S.M. Fishman D.A. Kearns A.S. Bafetti L.M. Stack M.S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1635-1641PubMed Google Scholar, 51Lehti K. Lohi J. Valtanen H. Keski-Oja J. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). During MMP2 activation, TIMP-2-free MT1-MMP must be in close proximity to a trimeric complex of MT1-MMP·TIMP-2·pro-MMP2 in order to activate the bound pro-MMP2 (52Kinoshita T. Sato H. Okada A. Ohuchi E. Imai K. Okada Y. Seiki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16098-16103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of MT1-MMP oligomerization are not clear. The recombinant hemopexin C domain of MT1-MMP did not form oligomers in solution or modulate MMP2 activation when added to cells (47Overall C.M. Tam E. McQuibban G.A. Morrison C. Wallon U.M. Bigg H.F. King A.E. Roberts C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39497-39506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Recent reports using transmembrane MT1-MMP chimera and deletion mutants have suggested that the hemopexin C domain can mediate homophilic complex formation of cellular MT1-MMP for efficient MMP2 activation (48Itoh Y.

Expression of a transmembrane-tethered MT1-MMP hemopexin C domain lacking the linker, termed PEX (Thr313–Val582), in HT1080 cells inhibited MT1-MMP oligomerization, the cellular activation of pro-MMP2, and Matrigel invasion (48Itoh Y. Takamura A. Ito N. Maru Y. Sato H. Suenaga N. Aoki T. Seiki M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4782-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), a function previously attributed to MMP2 proteolytic activity against type IV collagen (53Albini A. Melchiori A. Santi L. Liotta L.A. Brown P.D. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1991; 83: 775-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar).Considering that MT1-MMP is a collagenase, we hypothesized that exosites on the hemopexin C domain would bind to type I collagen and be essential for collagenolytic activity. Thus, the autolytically generated 44-kDa MT1-MMP ectodomain would be predicted to modulate pericellular collagenolysis on the membrane through dominant-negative interactions. Since native type I collagen stimulates MMP2 activation, we also hypothesized that collagen binding by the hemopexin C domain of MT1-MMP would modulate MMP2 activation with 44-kDa MT1-MMP opposing these effects in vivo. Experiments reported here demonstrate that collagen binding by the MT1-MMP hemopexin C domain is essential for collagenolytic activity and enhancement of MMP2 activation by MT1-MMP. Inhibition of this interaction either in vitro or on the cell surface inhibits collagen degradation. Together, these studies suggest a novel feedback mechanism through which generation of the 44-kDa MT1-MMP autolysis product regulates pericellular collagenolytic activity and subsequent invasive potential.DISCUSSIONAs an integral membrane protein, MT1-MMP appears suited for coordinating the homeostatic catabolism of pericellular type I collagen under the guide of the cell (62Nakahara H.

MT1-MMP mediates collagen degradation directly by cleaving native collagen and, indirectly, by activating MMP13 (9Cowell S. Knauper V. Stewart M.L. D'Ortho M.P. Stanton H. Hembry R.M. Lopez-Otin C. Reynolds J.J. Murphy G. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and the gelatinase and weak collagenase, MMP2 (11Sodek J. Overall C.M. Matrix Suppl. 1992; 1: 352-362PubMed Google Scholar, 12Aimes R.T. Quigley J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5872-5876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar, 13Patterson M.L. Atkinson S.J. Knauper V. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 503: 158-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Spatially and temporally, these two distinct activities of MT1-MMP regulate collagenolytic and gelatinolytic activities on the cell surface. Since MT1-MMP is a critical initiator and effector in the pericellular collagenolytic cascade, the regulation of its biological activity is very important in physiological and pathological collagen remodeling. The studies reported here have revealed the importance of the MT1-MMP hemopexin C domain and linker in the mechanism of collagen cleavage and demonstrated the role of collagen binding to MT1-MMP in stimulating MMP2 activation by cells. Moreover, these actions may be modulated in a dominant negative manner by the 44-kDa remnant form of MT1-MMP on the cell surface, revealing a novel regulatory function in proteolysis for an autolytic fragment of a protease.The structure of collagen presents a challenge for proteolytic cleavage, as indicated by the lowk cat/K m values for collagenases (66Welgus H.G. Jeffrey J.J. Stricklin G.P. Roswit W.T. Eisen A.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6806-6813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite several studies from a number of laboratories, the triple helicase mechanism remains enigmatic (14Overall C.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 151: 79-120PubMed Google Scholar). Our use of recombinant domains and polypeptides to probe the exosite requirements of MT1-MMP for collagenolysis revealed similar domain requirements for triple helicase activity as the secreted collagenases. The binding of the MT1-MMP hemopexin C domain, with or without the linker, to native collagen is consistent with previous reports for the collagenolytic MMPs (27Allan J.A. Hembry R.M. Angal S. Reynolds J.J. Murphy G. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 99: 789-795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Murphy G. Allan J.A. Willenbrock F. Cockett M.I. O'Connell J.P. Docherty A.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 7608-7616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The hemopexin C domain of MMP2, in contrast, does bind native collagen stably (57Wallon U.M. Overall C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7473-7481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the MT1-MMP hemopexin C domain does not bind denatured collagen. This suggests that, following cleavage, subsequent denaturation of the collagen would result in the release of MT1-MMP from the cleaved substrate facilitating turnover.Inhibition of sMT1-MMP collagen cleavage using MT1-MMP hemopexin C domain constructs required the presence of the linker, indicating that collagen binding, by the hemopexin C domain alone, is not sufficient to disrupt collagenolysis. This requirement was also observed in MMP2 collagenolysis, since MT1-LCD, but not MT1-CD, blocked MMP2 cleavage of native collagen. Protein engineering studies of MMP1 and MMP8 have previously shown a role for the linker in triple helicase activity (33Hirose T. Patterson C. Pourmotabbed T. Mainardi C.L. Hasty K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2569-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 34Knauper V. Docherty A.J. Smith B. Tschesche H. Murphy G.

Chem. 1992; 267: 13763-13767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, our studies have revealed some unique features of the MT1-MMP linker. De Souza et al. (67De Souza S.J. Pereira H.M. Jacchieri S. Brentani R.R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 927-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) proposed that the MMP1 collagenase linker, due to its proline content, intercalates with the collagen triple helix, thereby displacing individual α-chains for cleavage. We found that MT1-MMP linker peptide analogs of either the full-length 35-amino acid residue linker or the 18-amino acid residue region, corresponding to that found in the secreted collagenases, did not bind native or denatured type I collagen. These results indicate that the MT1-MMP linker may not bind or intercalate with the collagen triple helix as proposed for the MMP1 linker. Indeed, the low glycine content renders triple helix formation by these linkers impossible. Potentially, the full collagen binding exosite of the MT1-MMP hemopexin C domain that recognizes the ¾-¼ collagen site may span the linker/hemopexin C domain junction, thereby accounting for the lack of collagen binding by the linker analogs alone and the ineffectiveness of MTI-CD in blocking collagenolysis. The MT1-MMP linker, when connected to the hemopexin C domain, may act as a specificity determinant directing binding of the protease to the ¾-¼ collagen cleavage site. Thus, competition from MT1-LCD, but not MT1-CD, may block MT1-MMP from binding collagen here and so inhibit cleavage. Topographically, the MT1-MMP, and other collagenase linkers, may also correctly configure the catalytic domain relative to the hemopexin C domain for collagenolytic competence. Indeed, the MT1-MMP linker has predicted rigidity due to the presence of 9 proline residues, and we interpret the x-ray crystallographic structure of the MMP1 linker (68Li J. Brick P. O'Hare M.C. Skarzynski T. Lloyd L.F. Curry V.A. Clark I.M. Bigg H.F. Hazleman B.L. Cawston T.E. Structure. 1995; 3: 541-549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) to also indicate that the linker is not as flexible as generally thought. Hence, MT1-LCD binding of collagen may sterically disrupt the collagenolytic configuration of sMT1-MMP at the ¾-¼ collagen cleavage site, thereby inhibiting cleavage.The importance of MT1-MMP in collagen homeostasis is supported by the finding that fibrillar type I collagen induces cell surface expression of MT1-MMP and subsequent MMP2 activation through transcriptional and nontranscriptional pathways (36Azzam H.S.

Here we show that the binding of MK to cells occurs specifically at a high and a low affinity binding site. HB-19 prevents the binding of MK to the low affinity binding site only. Confocal immunofluorescence laser microscopy revealed the colocalization of MK and the cell-surface-expressed nucleolin at distinct spots. The use of various deletion constructs of nucleolin then indicated that the extreme C-terminal end of nucleolin, containing repeats of the amino acid motif RGG, is the domain that binds MK. The specific binding of MK to cells is independent of heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate expression. After binding to cells, MK enters cells by an active process. Interestingly, the cross-linking of surface-bound MK with a specific antibody results in the clustering of surface nucleolin along with glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked proteins CD90 and CD59, thus, pointing out that MK binding induces lateral assemblies of nucleolin with specific membrane components of lipid rafts.

This latter is similar to the mechanism that we had described for the action of the nucleolin binding anti-HIV pseudopeptide HB-19 (11Nisole S. Krust B. Callebaut C. Guichard G. Muller S. Briand J.P.

We showed that MK mRNA is systematically expressed in adult peripheral blood lymphocytes from healthy donors, whereas its expression becomes markedly but transiently increased upon in vitro treatment of lymphocytes with interleukin-2 or interferon-γ and activation of T lymphocytes by PHA or antibodies specific to CD3/CD28. In MK-producing lymphocytes, MK is detectable at the cell surface where it colocalizes with the surface-expressed nucleolin. In view of its various growth factor effects (3Kurtz A. Schulte A.M.

Virology. 2001; 281: 248-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), we suggested that MK should be considered as a cytokine. Finally, by using MK-producing CD4+ and CD4− cell clones, we showed that HIV infection in cell cultures could be inhibited both by an autocrine and paracrine manner, thus suggesting that MK is a cytokine that could be implicated in HIV-induced pathogenesis (10Callebaut C. Nisole S. Briand J.P. Krust B. Hovanessian A.G.

Consequently, MK and PTN constitute a distinct family of heparin binding growth factors that are different from fibroblast growth factors. Despite their striking structural homology and the conservation of their net positive charge, MK and PTN appear to have distinct receptors or receptor complexes. Several candidates have been proposed as the PTN receptor, such as the proteoglycan syndecan-1 and syndecan-3 and, more recently, the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (14Mitsiadis T.A. Salmivirta M.

Other works suggest that the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein is a component of the high affinity MK receptor (21Muramatsu H. Zou K. Sakaguchi N. Ikematsu S. Sakuma S. Muramatsu T.

In Wilms' tumor cells, proteins of 75 and 200 kDa have been reported to bind MK with high affinity, but their identity has not yet been determined (22Ratovitski E.A. Burrow C.R. Cell. Mol.

In the case of inhibition of HIV infection, more than 95% inhibition is obtained at concentrations around 0.5 μm MK (10Callebaut C. Nisole S. Briand J.P. Krust B. Hovanessian A.G. Virology. 2001; 281: 248-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), thus pointing out that the anti-HIV action of MK should be exerted via a low affinity receptor.Here we show that MK binding to cells involves high and low affinity binding sites. The nucleolin binding HB-19 pseudopeptide inhibits MK binding to the low affinity receptor, thus suggesting that such a receptor is surface nucleolin. Accordingly, we show that the plasma membrane-anchored MK is colocalized with surface nucleolin. After binding, MK is internalized in a receptor-dependent manner by an active process. MK binding to cells results in the clustering of surface nucleolin, and together they colocalize with specific components of lipid rafts, thus suggesting that MK entry proceeds by the lateral movements of the MK-nucleolin complex into lipid rafts. Accordingly, destruction of membrane cholesterol, which is an essential component for the formation of lipid rafts (24Yancey P.G. Rodrigueza W.V. Kilsdonk E.P. Stoudt G.W. Johnson W.J. Phillips M.C.

Other works suggest that the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein is a component of the high affinity MK receptor (21Muramatsu H. Zou K. Sakaguchi N. Ikematsu S. Sakuma S. Muramatsu T.

In Wilms' tumor cells, proteins of 75 and 200 kDa have been reported to bind MK with high affinity, but their identity has not yet been determined (22Ratovitski E.A. Burrow C.R. Cell. Mol.

In the case of inhibition of HIV infection, more than 95% inhibition is obtained at concentrations around 0.5 μm MK (10Callebaut C. Nisole S. Briand J.P. Krust B. Hovanessian A.G. Virology. 2001; 281: 248-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), thus pointing out that the anti-HIV action of MK should be exerted via a low affinity receptor. Here we show that MK binding to cells involves high and low affinity binding sites. The nucleolin binding HB-19 pseudopeptide inhibits MK binding to the low affinity receptor, thus suggesting that such a receptor is surface nucleolin. Accordingly, we show that the plasma membrane-anchored MK is colocalized with surface nucleolin. After binding, MK is internalized in a receptor-dependent manner by an active process. MK binding to cells results in the clustering of surface nucleolin, and together they colocalize with specific components of lipid rafts, thus suggesting that MK entry proceeds by the lateral movements of the MK-nucleolin complex into lipid rafts. Accordingly, destruction of membrane cholesterol, which is an essential component for the formation of lipid rafts (24Yancey P.G. Rodrigueza W.V. Kilsdonk E.P. Stoudt G.W. Johnson W.J. Phillips M.C.

Extracts of cells grown on fructoselysine catalyzed in the presence of ATP the phosphorylation of fructoselysine and a delayed formation of glucose 6-phosphate from this substrate. Data base searches allowed us to identify an operon containing a putative kinase (YhfQ) belonging to the PfkB/ ribokinase family, a putative deglycase (YhfN), homologous to the isomerase domain of glucosamine-6-phosphate synthase, and a putative cationic amino acid transporter (YhfM).

TheK m of the kinase for fructoselysine amounted to 18 μm, and the K m of the deglycase for fructoselysine 6-phosphate, to 0.4 mm.

https://openalex.org/W2061134762,"Studies in many rhodopsin-like G-protein-coupled receptors are providing a general scheme of the structural processes underlying receptor activation. Microdomains in several receptors have been identified that appear to function as activation switches. However, evidence is emerging that these receptor proteins exist in multiple conformational states. To study the molecular control of this switching process, we investigated the function of a microdomain involving the conserved helix 7 tyrosine in the serotonin 5HT2C receptor. This tyrosine of the NPXXY motif was substituted for all naturally occurring amino acids. Three distinct constitutively active receptor phenotypes were found: moderate, high, and “locked-on” constitutive activity. In contrast to the activity of the other receptor mutants, the high basal signaling of the locked-on Y7.53N mutant was neither increased by agonists nor decreased by inverse agonists. The Y7.53F mutant was uncoupled. Computational modeling based on the rhodopsin crystal structure suggested that Y7.53 interacts with the conserved aromatic ring at position 7.60 in the recently identified helix 8 domain. This provided a basis for seeking revertant mutations to correct the defective function of the Y7.53F receptor. When the Y7.53F receptor was mutated at position 7.60, the wild-type phenotype was restored. These results suggest that Y7.53 and Y7.60 contribute to a common functional microdomain connecting helices 7 and 8 that influences the switching of the 5HT2C receptor among multiple active and inactive conformations.

G-protein-coupled receptor 5-hydroxytryptamine [3H]inositol phosphates The class A or rhodopsin-like G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)1 are one of the largest protein families identified in the human genome (1Lander E.S. Linton L.M. Birren B. Nusbaum C. Zody M.C. Baldwin J. Devon K. Dewar K. Doyle M. FitzHugh W. Funke R. Gage D. Harris K.

Gocayne J.D. Amanatides P. Ballew R.M. Huson D.H. et al.Science. 2001; 291: 1304-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (10387) Google Scholar). This seven-transmembrane domain protein family, which includes the visual opsins, neurotransmitter, peptide hormone, and protein receptors, includes the targets of a significant proportion of therapeutic drugs (3Lu Z.L. Saldanha J.W. Hulme E.C. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 140-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In response to chemical or physical external stimuli, GPCRs undergo a conformational change leading to the activation of heterotrimeric G-proteins and other intracellular signaling mediators. The members of this receptor family can be recognized by their high degree of amino acid conservation at homologous positions in their transmembrane domains (4Probst W.C. Snyder L.A. Schuster D.I. Brosius J. Sealfon S.C. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). This widespread conservation pattern suggests that these amino acids are likely to contribute to structural elements that mediate common receptor functions. The various rhodopsin-like GPCRs differ in the structure of their agonists and in the classes of G-proteins that they preferentially activate. However, they all share a common transmembrane signaling function. Thus these conserved side chains have been proposed to contribute to a network of interhelical interactions that could subserve the shared requirement of these proteins to undergo conformational rearrangements during activation (5Sealfon S.C.

This view has been largely substantiated by a variety of studies of various GPCRs, in particular the landmark report of the crystal structure of the inactive form of rhodopsin at 2.8-Å resolution (6Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A., Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M.

Based on spin labeling studies of rhodopsin, activation of the receptor is postulated to involve a relative rigid body movement and rotation of the helices (8Farrens D.L. Altenbach C. Yang K. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Science. 1996; 274: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). Biophysical studies indicate that activation of rhodopsin and other GPCRs causes a displacement and rotation of helix 6 (8Farrens D.L. Altenbach C. Yang K. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G.

The degree of helix movement is relatively slight as a “straightjacketed” rhodopsin with four engineered disulfide links between adjacent helices can still achieve an active state (14Struthers M., Yu, H. Oprian D.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7938-7942Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Studies in many GPCRs implicate the conserved receptor side chains in a network of interactions underlying the helix rearrangement that occurs during activation (reviewed in Refs. 3Lu Z.L. Saldanha J.W. Hulme E.C. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 140-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 15Visiers I. Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H.

In addition to the inverse agonist effect of the chromophore, the ground state of rhodopsin is also stabilized by a series of structural modules that are mostly mediated by the highly conserved GPCR residues (6Palczewski K.

Several studies suggest that many GPCRs exhibit properties consistent with the existence of multiple conformational states. In rhodopsin, the existence of multiple conformers is evident from absorbance changes (37Sakmar T.P. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 59: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Activation occurs by transition through intermediate conformations (38Arnis S. Hofmann K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7849-7853Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), with the equilibrium between these forms showing a characteristic pH sensitivity (39Vogel R. Siebert F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3529-3535Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The existence of multiple receptor conformers is also evident in single molecule spectroscopy studies of the β adrenergic receptor (40Peleg G. Ghanouni P. Kobilka B.K. Zare R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8469-8474Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Pharmacological studies suggest that the existence of distinct receptor conformers can have functional significance. Studies of fusion proteins of β adrenergic receptor and G-proteins suggest that partial agonists stabilize a conformational state distinct from that stabilized by a full agonist (41Seifert R. Wenzel-Seifert K. Gether U. Kobilka B.K. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 297: 1218-1226PubMed Google Scholar). Functionally, it has been shown that many agonist-activated receptors couple to multiple signaling pathways. Thus, receptor mutations in conserved TM residues have been identified that selectively disrupt one pathway of a receptor coupled to multiple pathways (29Shinozaki H. Fanelli F. Liu X. Jaquette J. Nakamura K. Segaloff D.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 972-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The observation in several receptors that different agonists acting at the same receptor can direct the relative activation of downstream pathways, a phenomenon called “signal trafficking,” also suggests the presence of multiple populations of active receptor conformers (42Kenakin T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 232-238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 43Berg K.A. Maayani S. Goldfarb J. Scaramellini C. Leff P. Clarke W.P. Mol.

Fluorescence studies also suggest the presence of different receptor conformational populations when complexed with functionally distinct agonists (46Ghanouni P. Gryczynski Z. Steenhuis J.J. Lee T.W.

This emerging support for the existence of distinct, functionally relevant conformers in several GPCRs suggests that, for these receptors, the molecular activation mechanism must provide the means for switching among multiple conformations. One conserved domain implicated in the activation mechanism of GPCRs is the conserved NPXXY domain in helix 7. Mutagenesis studies (5Sealfon S.C. Chi L. Ebersole B.J. Rodic V. Zhang D.

Methods Enzymol. 2002; 343: 329-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and the rhodopsin crystal structure (6Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A., Le Trong I.

Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (4971) Google Scholar) all implicate helix 7 in a network of interactions that modulate receptor activity. In the present study, we investigate the role that the conserved Y7.53 in this domain may play in switching the 5HT2C receptor among multiple states. We selected this residue for detailed study because computational simulations implicated this side chain as a key determinant in the local structure of this helix 7 domain (48Konvicka K. Guarnieri F. Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 601-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 49Duong T.H. Mehler E.L. Weinstein H. J. Comp. Physics. 1999; 151: 358-387Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and previous studies have shown that a constitutively active receptor and an uncoupled receptor could be generated with mutations at this locus in the 5HT2C receptor (50Rosendorff A. Ebersole B.J. Sealfon S.C. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 84: 90-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Thus Y7.53 is a candidate to be a critical modulator of the overall conformational state of the protein. The rhodopsin crystal structure shows that the side chain of Y7.53 is adjacent to the conserved aromatic side chain at position 7.60. Residue 7.60, although near helix 7, is actually located in a separate, cytoplasmic helix 8 domain that was first revealed in the high resolution rhodopsin structure (6Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A., Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (4971) Google Scholar). We designed the present study to explore the hypothesis that the side chain at position 7.53 in the 5HT2C receptor serves a key function in regulating the switching among distinct receptor conformers. We also explored the hypothesis that the helix 7 Y7.53 and the helix 8 Y7.60 form part of an extended functional interhelical domain. We introduced all 19 naturally occurring amino acids for Y7.53 and characterized the receptor phenotypes obtained. We also sought function-restoring revertant mutations involving positions 7.53 and 7.60 in the 5HT2C receptor. Our results identify multiple distinct receptor phenotypes and function-restoring revertant mutations, suggesting that this domain contributes to a multistate conformational switch. Unlabeled ligands, U773122, and U73343were obtained from Sigma-RBI (St. Louis, MO). Receptors are numbered according to a consensus numbering scheme described in detail previously (51Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Methods Neurosci. 1995; 25: 366-428Crossref Scopus (2389) Google Scholar). The residues are numbered in reference to the most conserved residue contained in a helix. The conserved residue, Pro-365, found in helix 7 of 5HT2C receptor is designated as P7.50. Residues N-terminal to this conserved locus are numbered in decreasing order. Thus, Tyr-368 in the NPXXY motif in helix 7 has the designation Y7.53 and Tyr-375 has the designation Y7.60. The cDNA encoding the human 5HT2C receptor was generously supplied by Dr. Alan Saltzman (52Saltzman A.G. Morse B. Whitman M.M. Ivanshchenko Y. Jaye M. Felder S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 1469-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Mutations were introduced into the 5HT2C receptor using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and confirmed by sequencing. The cDNA was subcloned into the EcoRI andXbaI site of the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) and used to transfect COS-1 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) as described previously (53Ebersole B.J. Sealfon S.C. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 343: 123-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Accumulation of [3H]inositol phosphates ([3H]IP) was measured as previously described (53Ebersole B.J. Sealfon S.C. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 343: 123-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). An incubation at 37 °C for 60 min with no preincubation was used. The protein content of three to six wells on each plate was determined and used to correct for small differences in the number of cells per well among constructs. Transiently transfected COS-1 cells were harvested, and the cell pellets were stored at −70 °C. Thawed pellets were homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer, and the cell suspension was centrifuged at 35,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.4 at 25 °C) buffer. Saturation and competition assays with [3H]mesulergine (an inverse agonist with low intrinsic activity) were carried out as described previously (50Rosendorff A. Ebersole B.J. Sealfon S.C. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 84: 90-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), with the exception that 1 nm [3H]mesulergine was used to label 5HT2C receptor in the competition binding studies. Protein content was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (54Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. The approaches utilized to construct a three-dimensional model of the transmembrane bundle of the 5HT2C receptor based on the structure of rhodopsin have been described previously (15Visiers I. Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 343: 329-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 51Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Methods Neurosci. 1995; 25: 366-428Crossref Scopus (2389) Google Scholar). Parameter estimates for competition binding and saturation binding data were obtained by non-linear regression (PRISM, GraphPad, San Diego, CA, and Kaleidagraph, Synergy Software, Reading, PA) as previously described (53Ebersole B.J. Sealfon S.C. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 343: 123-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To facilitate the comparison of [3H]IP accumulation among experiments, dpm/well of [3H]IP were normalized for the protein content, the accumulation in the presence of 10 μm SB206553 in the WT was subtracted, and the resulting values were either reported as the calculated difference or divided by the expression level (B max in pmol/mg) of protein determined from [3H]mesulergine saturation binding studies as indicated in the figure legends. The affinities for the 5HT2C receptor radioligand [3H]mesulergine and the levels of expression of the receptors comprising all 20 naturally occurring amino acids at position 7.53 are shown in Table I. Although the mesulergine affinity was slightly reduced for most receptor mutants, in most cases the change was modest and within severalfold of that of the wild-type receptor. Receptor density varied for the different mutant receptors. All mutant receptors were expressed at levels lower than that of the wild-type receptor. Three of the mutants, Lys, Asp, and Glu, were expressed at less than 20% of wild-type levels.Table ISummary of [3H]mesulergine saturation binding for 5-HT2C receptor constructsAmino acid at 7.53[3H]Mesulergine bindingK dB maxmM% of WTTyr (WT)0.75 ± 0.08100Asn1.40 ± 0.1654 ± 4Phe4.95 ± 0.9053 ± 10Gln1.15 ± 0.2874 ± 4Met1.02 ± 0.2882 ± 1Thr1.88 ± 0.2042 ± 10Ser0.98 ± 0.1931 ± 5Cys2.62 ± 1.2956 ± 10Gly0.64 ± 0.2164 ± 6His0.88 ± 0.1867 ± 13Arg1.37 ± 0.1638 ± 5Trp1.67 ± 0.4361 ± 4Val1.55 ± 0.1574 ± 9Pro1.54 ± 0.6661 ± 6Leu1.05 ± 0.2594 ± 6Ile1.48 ± 0.1186 ± 15Ala1.44 ± 0.7375 ± 15Lys1.53 ± 0.6017 ± 4Asp1.76 ± 0.3717 ± 4Glu0.74 ± 0.5511 ± 3Bmax values for mutant constructs were normalized to theB max value for WT in each experiment.

Results are the mean ± S.E. from 3–25 independent experiments done in triplicate. The levels of agonist-independent and serotonin-stimulated [3H]IP accumulation responses were determined for the wild-type and all 19 Y7.53 mutant receptors expressed in COS-1 cells. As previously reported (50Rosendorff A. Ebersole B.J. Sealfon S.C. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 84: 90-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), the wild-type receptor exhibited a modest level of agonist-independent signaling that was suppressed by the inverse agonist SB206553 (Figs.1 and2 A). The inverse agonist caused a concentration-dependent decrease in signaling, whereas the agonist serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)) caused a concentration-dependent increase in signaling (Fig.2 A). The 19 mutant receptors had varying degrees of agonist-independent activity (Fig. 1). Some receptor mutants, such as Arg, Trp, and Val, showed an activation pattern similar to that of the wild-type receptor. They had detectable basal signaling that was reduced by the inverse agonist SB206553. These mutants showed a relatively large increase in signaling in the presence of the agonist 5-HT. In contrast, several of the mutants (Gln, Met, Thr, Ser, Cys, Gly, and His) had very high constitutive signaling and showed little or no further accumulation of [3H]IP in the presence of 5-HT (Fig. 2 B). The basal signaling of these mutants was reduced in the presence of SB206553. The Lys, Asp, and Glu mutants appear to show some agonist-independent and 5-HT-stimulated activity but could not be classified due to their low levels of expression. The Y7.53F mutant had no evidence of either basal or 5-HT-stimulated signaling, as previously reported (50Rosendorff A. Ebersole B.J. Sealfon S.C. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 84: 90-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The Y7.53N mutant showed a unique activation phenotype. This receptor had a very high level of constitutive signaling that was neither increased by 5-HT nor suppressed by SB206553 (Fig. 2 C).Figure 2Concentration dependence of the effects of 5-HT and SB206553 on [3H]IP accumulation in 5-HT2C receptors.

To determine whether the apparent phenotype of this mutant was generalizable to structurally distinct agonists and inverse agonists, we determined the signaling in the presence of diverse ligands (Fig. 3). Nine ligands showed inverse agonist activity at the wild-type receptor and reduced the degree of constitutive signaling at the high constitutive activity Y7.53C mutant receptor. In contrast, none of the inverse agonists decreased the signaling of the Y7.53N receptor. All agonists studied increased [3H]IP accumulation at the wild-type receptor but caused little or no increase in [3H]IP accumulation when complexed with the Y7.53C or Y7.53N receptors (Fig. 3). Thus, although both the Y7.53C and Y7.53N receptors appear to achieve nearly maximal activity in the absence of agonist, the activity of only the Y7.53N receptor is not diminished in the presence of any of the inverse agonists tested. The 5HT2C receptor stimulates phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis via Gq-mediated activation of phospholipase C. The phospholipase C inhibitor U73122, but not its inactive stereoisomerU73343, reduced basal [3H]IP accumulation in both the wild-type and the Y7.53N mutant receptors to the level observed for the wild-type in the presence of SB206553. 2C. Prioleau and S. C. Sealfon, unpublished data. We also confirmed that the agonist-independent signaling mediated by the Y7.53N mutant resulted from enzymatic activity by measuring the accumulation of [3H]IP over time. Basal [3H]IP accumulation showed a linear increase for all constructs over the 60 min duration of the experiment. 5-HT increased the rate of [3H]IP accumulation in both the wild-type and Y7.53L receptors (Fig.4, B and E). The small basal and 5-HT-stimulated increases observed over time with the Y7.53F receptor were equivalent to those seen in cells transfected with vector alone (Fig. 4, A and C). The basal accumulation of [3H]IP for the Y7.53N mutant receptor was linear over time and was not further increased by 5-HT (Fig.4 D). These data indicate that the high levels of [3H]IP accumulation generated by the Y7.53N mutant receptor arise from persistent stimulation of signaling that is unaffected by either agonists or inverse agonists. We next evaluated the competitive binding affinities of structurally diverse ligands for the wild-type, high constitutive activity Y7.53C and “locked-on” Y7.53N receptors (TableII and Fig.5). Most inverse agonists showed similar affinities for the wild-type, Y7.53C, and Y7.53N receptors. In contrast, the affinities of agonists for the two Y7.53 mutant receptors assayed were higher than those observed for the wild-type receptor. Moreover, the two mutant receptors differed in the magnitude of the changes observed. The affinities of agonists for the Y7.53C mutant receptor showed a 2- to 6-fold increase in comparison to wild-type receptor. The agonist affinities for the Y7.53N mutant receptor were dramaticall"

Polκ is shown here to bypass 5,6-dihydro-5,6-dihydroxythymine (thymine glycol) generated in two different DNA substrate preparations.

However, steady state kinetic analysis of nucleotides incorporated opposite thymine glycol demonstrates different misincorporation rates for guanine with each of the two DNA substrates. The two substrates differ only in the relative proportions of thymine glycol stereoisomers, suggesting that polκ distinguishes among stereoisomers and exhibits reduced discrimination between purines when incorporating a base opposite a 5R thymine glycol stereoisomer. When extending beyond the site of the lesion, the misincorporation rate of polκ for each of the three incorrect nucleotides (adenine, guanine, and thymine) is dramatically increased.

However, the potential for cell death attendant on arrested DNA replication can be mitigated by a mechanism called translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) (5Friedberg E.C. Wagner R. Radman M.

This process effects the replicative bypass of sites of base damage, allowing high fidelity semiconservative DNA synthesis to continue. Important new insights into the biochemical mechanism of TLS have recently been gained by the discovery of a number of new DNA polymerases, all of which share the properties of limited fidelity and processivity when copying undamaged DNA, as well as a lack of 3′ → 5′ proofreading exonuclease activity (1Ohmori H.

Multiple DNA polymerases of this class have been shown to support TLS of one or more types of base damagein vitro. In some instances, this role is supported by genetic or other biological evidence. Hence, a general theme is beginning to emerge that the redundancy for error-prone DNA polymerases in prokaryotic and especially in eukaryotic cells reflects a requirement for the bypass of multiple types of base damage that can arrest normal DNA replication (5Friedberg E.C.

A. 1999; 96: 11922-11927Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In previous studies, polκ was fused to glutathione S-transferase and expressed in insect cells (14Gerlach V.L. Feaver W.J. Fischhaber P.L. Friedberg E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 92-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The purified fusion protein was shown to be a template-directed DNA polymerase with limited processivity and fidelity (15Ohashi E. Bebenek K. Matsuda T. Feaver W.J. Gerlach V.L. Friedberg E.C. Ohmori H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39678-39684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). GST-polκ protein lacks detectable 3′ → 5′ proofreading exonuclease activity and is not stimulated by recombinant human proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in vitro (14Gerlach V.L. Feaver W.J. Fischhaber P.L. Friedberg E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 92-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, in the presence of the three replicative accessory factors, PCNA, replication factor C, and replication factor A, polκ exhibits a 50–200-fold stimulation in efficiency but no increase in processivity (16Haracska L. Unk I. Johnson R.E. Phillips B.B. Hurwitz J. Prakash L. Prakash S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 784-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Additionally, polκ interacts physically with PCNA (16Haracska L. Unk I. Johnson R.E. Phillips B.B. Hurwitz J. Prakash L. Prakash S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 784-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Human polκ has optimal activity at 37 °C over the pH range 6.5–7.5 and is insensitive to inhibition by aphidicolin or dideoxynucleotides or by NaCl up to 50 mm. Either Mg2+ or Mn2+ can satisfy a metal cofactor requirement for polκ activity (14Gerlach V.L. Feaver W.J. Fischhaber P.L. Friedberg E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 92-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In vitro polκ extends DNA oligonucleotide primers to a position one base short of the end of the DNA template (14Gerlach V.L. Feaver W.J. Fischhaber P.L. Friedberg E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 92-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Full-length purified polκ fusion protein is unable to extend a DNA primer past bulky base adducts such as thymine-thymine dimers or [6-4]-pyrimidine-pyrimidone photoproducts generated by exposure of cells or DNA to UV radiation (17Zhang Y. Yuan F., Wu, X. Wang M. Rechkoblit O. Taylor J.S. Geacintov N.E. Wang Z. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4138-4146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the enzyme does not support TLS past cisplatin intrastrand cross-links in template DNA (14Gerlach V.L. Feaver W.J. Fischhaber P.L. Friedberg E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 92-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In contrast, the enzyme can support TLS past acetylaminofluorene-guanine, any of the four stereoisomer adducts resulting from reaction of benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-diol 9,10-epoxide at C-10 with the exocyclic N2 of guanine (BPDE-G) in template DNA, 1,N 6-ethenodeoxyadenosine, and sites of base loss (abasic sites) (14Gerlach V.L.

Evidence has also been presented that polκ can perform efficient extension synthesis following nucleotide incorporation directly opposite DNA lesions (18Zhang Y. Wu X. Guo D. Rechkoblit O. Wang Z. DNA Repair. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar). Polκ additionally supports extension synthesis on primer-template substrates terminating in a 3′ mispaired base, incorporating nucleotides with a high error rate (20Washington M.T. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1910-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). POLK mRNA and polκ protein are highly expressed in the adrenal cortex of adult mice, beginning in early embryonic life (2Gerlach V.L. Aravind L. Gotway G. Schultz R.A. Koonin E.V. Friedberg E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11922-11927Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). 2S. Velasco-Miguel, J. A. Richardson, V. L. Gerlach, W. C. Lai, T. Gao, L. D. Russell, C. L.

Friedberg, submitted for publication. Indeed, at embryonic day 15.5 this is the only tissue in which POLK expression can be detected by in vitro hybridization.2Furthermore, this expression pattern appears to be relatively specific, since genes encoding two other recently discovered specialized DNA polymerases, polι and polλ are not uniquely or highly expressed in the adrenal cortex.2 Steroid biosynthesis in the adrenal cortex is known to involve the generation of large amounts of reactive oxygen species, which may result in an unusual burden of oxidative DNA damage in adrenal cortical cells (23Ames B.N.

Consistent with a possible role in the replicative bypass of oxidative base damage to DNA, the PolK (DinB1) gene is up-regulated in mouse embryo fibroblasts following exposure of cells to either doxorubicin or UV radiation.2 Both of these agents are known to generate reactive oxygen species that can damage DNA (25Gewirtz D.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 727-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar, 26Scharffetter-Kochanek K. Wlaschek M. Brenneisen P. Schauen M. Blaudschun R. Wenk J. Biol.

Cancer Res. 1978; 38: 1745-1750PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, mouse embryo fibroblasts from a mutant mouse strain defective in polκ activity manifest increased sensitivity to killing following exposure to UV radiation (29Washington M.T. Johnson R.E. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2263-2266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In the present studies, we have investigated the ability of human polκ to support primer extension in vitro past thymine glycol (Tg) residues in DNA, a biologically important form of oxidative base damage that potently inhibits DNA replication by many high fidelity polymerases (30Teoule R. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. Relat. Stud. Phys. Chem. Med. 1987; 51: 573-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar).3 Recently, another Y-family DNA polymerase, human polη was reported to bypass Tg lesions in vitro (31Kusumoto R. Masutani C. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6090-6099Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Polη synthesizes DNA past Tg with an efficiency nearly equal to that of undamaged DNA but with an extremely high rate of error (31Kusumoto R. Masutani C. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6090-6099Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Additionally, polη exhibits a stereochemical preference for the R stereoisomer at C-5 of Tg (31Kusumoto R. Masutani C. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6090-6099Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). For the present studies, we employed primer-template substrates in which a single Tg residue in the template DNA strand was generated by two different methods (Fig. 1 A). Both procedures result in a mixture of the four possible stereoisomers of Tg in different relative proportions (Fig. 1 B) (32Iwai S. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2000; 39: 3874-3876Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 33Lustig M.J. Cadet J. Boorstein R.J. Teebor G.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4839-4845Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We show by both qualitative and quantitative steady-state kinetic analysis that polκ supports TLS across both of these substrates. During this replicative bypass, the base A is preferentially incorporated opposite Tg. Additionally, polκ is able to extend the primer template beyond the lesion, preferentially incorporating the correct next base. However, differences are observed both in the efficiency of A incorporation and in the misincorporation rate of G opposite Tg when comparing the two templates. TLS appears to be more efficient and specific opposite the substrate putatively containing a larger proportion of 5S stereoisomers. Terminal deoxytransferase and T4 DNA polymerase were obtained from Invitrogen. The Klenow fragment ofE. coli DNA polymerase I (exo−) was obtained from New England Biolabs. T4 DNA polymerase was obtained from U.S. Biochemical Corp. Deoxynucleoside triphosphates were from Promega. Osmium tetroxide (OsO4) was purchased from Aldrich. GST-polκ fusion protein was purified as previously described (14Gerlach V.L. Feaver W.J. Fischhaber P.L. Friedberg E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 92-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The primer used for running start experiments was P4-OX-RS (5′-dGAATTCCTGCAGCCCAGGAT); the primer for standing start experiments was P5-OX-SS (5′-dGAATTCCTGCAGCCCAGGATCGACTGGTCC). The primer for steady state extension experiments (k ext) was P5-OX-SS-A (5′-dGAATTCCTGCAGCCCAGGATCGACTGGTCCA). The template DNA for these experiments was the sequence 5′-dATTCCAGACTGTCAATAACACGGTgGGACCAGTCGATCCTGGGCTGCAGGAATTC); the site of thymine glycol modification is underlined. The control template was of the same sequence, except the underlined base was simply thymine. DNA oligonucleotides were purified by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (DPAGE). Five pmol of each primer was 5′-end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP, and the unincorporated radiolabel was removed using a Sephadex G-25 spin column equilibrated with STE (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm Na2EDTA). Primers were annealed to template strands in a stoichiometric ratio of 1:1.5 (primer-template) by heating (90 °C, 5 min, 1× STE buffer) and cooling on the bench top (15 min). Native polyacrylamide gels showed altered gel mobility for the labeled primers under these conditions when compared with single-stranded primers, indicating duplex DNA character for the template-annealed primers under these conditions. 5,6-Dihydro-5,6-dihydroxythymidine-5′-triphosphate (thymidine glycol-5′-triphosphate) was synthesized according to a previously published protocol (34Ide H. Melamede R.J. Wallace S.S. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 964-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and characterized by HPLC (one peak), 31P NMR (three lines), 1H NMR, and ESI mass spectrometry ((M-H+)1− = 515 atomic mass units). Additionally, the stereochemical composition of this sample was assayed by digestion of the deoxynucleoside triphosphate with alkaline phosphatase and separation of the deoxynucleosides by HPLC according to a previously published method (33Lustig M.J. Cadet J. Boorstein R.J. Teebor G.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4839-4845Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This assay returned three peaks: 1) trans(5S,6S), 2) trans(5R,6R), and 3) the cis isomers, which elute together ((5S,6R) and (5R,6S)) with nearly identical retention times and peak area ratios, as had previously been reported for oxidation of thymidine deoxynucleoside (data not shown). Hence, stereochemical composition is identical to previous studies up to the point of incorporation of the nucleoside triphosphate. The product nucleotide triphosphate was reacted with the 3′-end of a DNA oligonucleotide enzymatically, 5′-d(ATTCCAGACTGTCAATAACACGG), by incubation with terminal deoxytransferase ([DNA oligonucleotide] = 1 μm, [thymine glycol triphosphate] = 100 μm, [terminal deoxytransferase] = 60 nm, 100 mm sodium cacodylate, 2 mmCoCl2, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.0, 1 h, 30 °C). The product containing the addition of a single 3′-thymidine glycol nucleotide was purified by HPLC and gel electrophoresis, desalted by SepPak C18 chromatography, and characterized by ESI mass spectrometry, which indicated the addition of a single thymidine glycol nucleotide residue to the unreacted oligonucleotide. Ligation to a 3′-flanker oligonucleotide was accomplished by annealing the thymine glycol oligonucleotide to the flanker strand, 5′-phosphoryl-d(GGACCAGTCGATCCTGGGCTGCAGGAATTC), and to a splinting strand, 5′-d(AGGATCGACTGGTCCACCGTGTTATTGACAGTC), and incubating with T4 DNA ligase (manufacturer's buffer; 16 °C, 12 h). The full-length, ligated thymine glycol substrate (TgBr2), was purified by DPAGE, quantitated by UV, and annealed to appropriate radiolabeled primers for primer extension analysis. A DNA oligonucleotide of the sequence 5′-d(AACACGGTGGACCAG) (2.4 mg) was incubated in aqueous OsO4 (3 stoichiometric equivalents, 5% pyridine, 200 μl total, 25 °C, 30 min). The reaction was extracted with chloroform and ethanol-precipitated before purifying by HPLC and DPAGE. The purified thymine glycol DNA oligonucleotide was characterized by ESI mass spectrometry, which indicated the addition of 34 atomic mass units ((M + H+)1+ = 4646) to the unreacted DNA oligonucleotide. The purified sample was further characterized by piperidine cleavage analysis of a 5′-32P-end-labeled sample (∼1 pmol, 1 m piperidine, 100 μl, 30 min, 90 °C), which revealed 100% truncation of the DNA oligonucleotide at the thymine position, confirming that the site of modification was exclusively thymine and that 100% of thymines were oxidized. Additionally, the thymine glycol-modified oligonucleotide had distinct gel mobility from the unmodified strand, which aided in both purification and characterization. Background piperidine cleavage at positions corresponding to deoxycytidines, was also observed in incompletely purified samples. The thymine glycol oligonucleotide was phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase and ATP, purified using a Sephadex G-25 spin column, and ethanol-precipitated. The resulting phosphorylated, thymine glycol oligonucleotide was ligated to flanker sequences analogously to the preparation of the TgBr2 substrate by heating in the presence of 5′-dAATCCAGACTGTCAAT and 5′-phosphoryl-dTCGATCCTGGGCTGCAGGAATTC and a splinting DNA with the sequence 5′-dAGGATCGACTGGTCCACCGTGTTATTGACAGTC. The full-length, DPAGE-purified, ligated thymine glycol substrate (TgOsO4), which has the same sequence as the TgBr2 substrate (described above), was quantitated by UV and annealed to appropriate primers for primer extension analysis. Running start and standing start assays shown in Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4 were performed as previously described except that gels were phosphorimaged and quantitated using AmershamBiosciences software (14Gerlach V.L. Feaver W.J. Fischhaber P.L. Friedberg E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 92-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Steady-state kinetics experiments (Fig. 5) were performed according to previously published methods (35Benkovic S.J. Cameron C.E.

Radiolabeled primer-templates (20 nm) were incubated (10 min) with GST-polκ (5 nm) and the indicated concentration of a single deoxynucleotide 5′-triphosphate. The resulting primers were resolved by DPAGE, and bands corresponding to unextended primer were quantitated by phosphorimaging. Numerical data corresponding to these gels are shown in Table I. Data were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation as described by a hyperbolic curve using SigmaPlot 2001. Apparent K m andV max values were calculated from the plots, andk cat values were subsequently calculated fromV max. In all cases, data points resulting in greater than 25% primer turnover were not used in plots calculating the V max and K m. Steady state experiments were performed in triplicate, and results were averaged to obtain the values reported in Table I along with the corresponding standard deviations.Figure 3A, GST-polκ exhibits identical bypass of an alternatively prepared thymine glycol template, TgOsO4, which is constitutionally identical to TgBr2 (Fig. 2) experiments, but stereochemically contains a greater proportion of 5R thymine glycol stereoisomers.

Calreticulin can regulate cell adhesion by a number of different mechanisms from both inside and outside the cell. Recent reports indicate that calreticulin may influence cell adhesion indirectly from the ER lumen via modulation of gene expression of adhesion-related molecules such as vinculin and β-catenin (8Opas M.

It has also been shown that calreticulin associates transiently with the cytoplasmic domains of integrin α subunits during spreading and that this interaction can influence integrin-mediated cell adhesion to extracellular matrix (6Leung-Hagesteijn C.Y.

Recently we showed that thrombospondin-induced focal adhesion disassembly is mediated by cell surface calreticulin (23Goicoechea S. Orr A.W. Pallero M.A. Eggleton P. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36358-36368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Based on the amino acid sequence of the protein, calreticulin can be divided into three distinct structural and functional domains (1Michalak M. Milner R.E. Burns K. Opas M. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 681-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). The N-domain (aa 1–180), which corresponds to the highly conserved N-terminal half of the molecule, has a globular β-sheet structure. This domain contains a low affinity, high capacity zinc-binding site (K d = 310 μm and 14 mol of zinc/mol CRT) (24Khanna N.C. Tokuda M. Waisman D.M. J. Biol.

The N-domain is followed by a proline-rich sequence, the P-domain (aa 181–290), and the C-terminal quarter of the protein, the C-domain (aa 291–400). The C-domain of calreticulin is acidic and binds Ca2+ with high capacity and low affinity, whereas the P-domain binds Ca2+ with low capacity and high affinity (27Baksh S. Michalak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21458-21465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown recently that calcium and zinc ions induce strikingly different changes in the biochemical and structural properties of calreticulin, suggesting the possible importance of these metal ions in modulating calreticulin functions (28Corbett E.F.

Thrombospondin (TSP) is a member of a group of extracellular matrix proteins that exist in both soluble and extracellular matrix forms and that variably regulate cellular adhesion (30Sage E.H.

When exposed to cells in its soluble form, thrombospondin has primarily anti-adhesive effects characterized by a reorganization of stress fibers and loss of focal adhesion plaques as ascertained by interference reflection microscopy (32Greenwood J.A.

A 19-amino acid sequence (aa 17–35) in the N-terminal heparin-binding domain of thrombospondin, referred to as the hep I peptide, has been shown to be sufficient for focal adhesion disassembly (36Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Gurusiddappa S. Frazier W.A. Höök M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26784-26789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In earlier studies, we showed that thrombospondin binds calreticulin and that a cell surface form of calreticulin mediates the ability of thrombospondin or the hep I peptide to stimulate focal adhesion disassembly and activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (23Goicoechea S.

In this paper, we report that interactions between calreticulin and thrombospondin are Zn2+- and Ca2+-dependent and involve the RWIESKHKSDFGKFVLSS sequence in the N-terminal region of the N-domain of calreticulin. The following items were purchased: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Cell-Gro, Mediatech); fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories); 500 μg/ml trypsin and 2.2 mm EDTA (Life Technologies, Inc.); glutathione-Sepharose 4B and GammaBind G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences); stained and prestained molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad), and a chemoluminescence detection kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Thrombospondin was isolated from fresh human platelets purchased from the American Red Cross. It was purified in the presence of 0.1 mm CaCl2according to established protocols using heparin affinity and gel filtration chromatography (35Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Höök M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1309-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The identification of the 19-amino acid active site in TSP1 (hep I; aa 17–35) has enabled us to substitute the peptide for the TSP1 molecule in several assays. Hep I (ELTGAARKGSGRRLVKGPD) peptide was synthesized, purified, and analyzed by the University of Alabama at Birmingham Comprehensive Cancer Center/Peptide Synthesis and Analysis shared facility. Overlapping peptides, 15 amino acid residues long, spanning amino acids 13–48 of N-terminal domain of human calreticulin were synthesized as described by Kovacs et al. (37Kovacs H. Campbell I.D. Strong P. Johnson S. Ward F.J. Reid K.B. Eggleton P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17865-17874Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, the peptides were synthesized by Fmoc-based solid phase peptide synthesis with a BT7400 manual peptide synthesizer (Biotech Instruments Ltd., Kimptom, UK). After lyophilization, the peptides were analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC (Gilson, Anachem, Luton, UK). The details (nucleotide sequences, restriction sites, vectors, etc.) for construction of the GST-CRT domains (N-, P-, and C-domains) have been published (27Baksh S. Michalak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21458-21465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse anti-TSP 133 antibodies were raised against TSP1 depleted of associated transforming growth factor-β and developed using the Hybridoma Core facility at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (38Schultz-Cherry S. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal anti-GST antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Rabbit anti-N-terminal calreticulin antibody was raised in rabbits inoculated with the purified recombinant human N-domain (aa 1–180) of calreticulin that had been expressed in Escherichia coli. The animals were immunized by intramuscular injection of 50 μg of protein emulsified with 0.5 ml of Freund's complete adjuvant in a total volume of 1 ml over 3 monthly intervals. The IgG fraction of the rabbit antiserum was prepared by sodium sulfate precipitation followed by protein A affinity purification from a 4-month post-immunization bleed. Rabbit polyclonal anti-calreticulin antibody (PA3900) and chicken IgG anti-N-terminal calreticulin antibody (PA1–902) were purchased from Affinity BioReagents. Rabbit polyclonal anti-C-terminal calreticulin antibody (SPA-600) was purchased from StressGen. BAE cells were isolated and cultured in DMEM containing 4.5 g/liter glucose, 2 mm glutamine, and 20% fetal bovine serum as described previously (36Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Gurusiddappa S. Frazier W.A. Höök M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26784-26789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were used between passages 4 and 12. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were isolated from calreticulin-deficient and wild type embryos, immortalized, and designated K41 and K42, respectively (17Mesaeli N. Nakamura K. Zvaritch E.

CRT-rescued (K42CRT) MEFs were obtained by transfection of K42crt −/− cells with the pcDNA3 expression vector containing cDNA encoding rabbit calreticulin (40Nakamura K. Zuppini A. Arnaudeau S.

Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was performed with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). GST-N1, GST-N2, GST-N3, GST-N6, and GST-N11 truncation mutants were made by mutating the endogenous codon to a stop codon at the appropriate location in the GST-N-domain sequence using GST-CRT N-domain as a template. Amino acids 134, 83, 43, 20, and 31 were changed for a stop codon in GST-N1, GST-N2, GST-N3, GST-N6, and GST-N11, respectively. The N5 (aa 43–180) fragment was amplified by PCR using GST-N-domain cDNA in the pGEX-5X-2 vector (AmershamBiosciences) as template. Two primers were designed to generateBamHI and EcoRI sites at each end of the sequence: 5′-ACGGGATCCAGGAGAAAGATAAAGGGCTGC-3′ with 5′-GGGGAATTCGAAGTCCCAGTCATCCTCCA-3′. The amplified sequences were subcloned into the pGEX-5X-2 vector. The hep I-binding site (amino acids 19–36) was deleted from pcD-CRT-HAQ by site-directed mutagenesis. A GST fusion protein was then generated by subcloning the CRTΔhep I fragment into the BamHI/EcoRI site of the pGEX-2T vector. All of the constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Sequencing Core Facility. GST-CRT, GST-CRTΔhepI, GST-CRT domains, and GST-N-domain fragments were expressed and purified as described by Baksh and Michalak (27Baksh S. Michalak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21458-21465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Before purification with a glutathione-Sepharose column, insoluble proteins (GST-N-domain and GST-N1 and GST-N2 fragments) were solubilized using Inclusion Body Solubilization Reagent (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The N3 and N6 fragments were further purified by HPLC using a BiosilSec 125 gel filtration column (Bio-Rad). The purified proteins were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline, and the protein concentration was determined using the Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent from Pierce. Purity of the GST proteins was assessed by SDS-PAGE. Focal adhesion assays were performed according to the protocols described by Murphy-Ullrich and Höök (35Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Höök M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1309-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Briefly, BAE cells were grown to near confluence for 20–24 h on 12-mm glass coverslips in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum. After preincubation under serum-free conditions for 30 min, the cells were treated for 1 h at 37 °C with hep I (100 ng/ml), TSP1 (10 μg/ml), GST-CRT, GST-CRTΔhep I, GST-CRT-N-domain, GST-CRT-N-domain mutants, GST, N-domain peptides, anti-calreticulin antibody, anti-N-terminal calreticulin antibody, anti-C-terminal calreticulin antibody, or protein-free DMEM. The cells were fixed with warm 3% glutaraldehyde for 30 min at 37 °C and washed four times, and coverslips were mounted on slides in DMEM. The cells were examined for the presence of focal adhesions by interference reflection microscopy (IRM) with a specially equipped Zeiss Axiovert 10 microscope. A minimum of 300 cells/condition was evaluated for the presence of focal adhesions. The cells that are positive usually have ∼15–30 plaques/cell. The cells with less than 3–5 plaques/cell were scored as negative. The experiments were repeated a minimum of three times. The samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (the percentages of acrylamide are indicated in the figure legends) under reducing conditions. After electrophoresis, the gels were stained with either silver or Coomassie Blue or transferred electrophoretically to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (2 h, 100 V, at 4 °C). Nonspecific protein-binding sites present in the membranes were blocked by incubation with 1% casein in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST). The membranes were then incubated with primary antibodies diluted in TBST (dilutions are specified in figure legends) followed by three 15-min washes in TBST. Antibody binding was detected with appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and developed by enhanced chemoluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using a monoclonal anti-TSP antibody (monoclonal antibody 133). Native thrombospondin and recombinant GST-CRT, GST-CRT-N-domain, GST-CRT-P-domain, GST-CRT-C-domain, or GST-CRT-N-domain fragments were incubated together in a total volume of 300 μl of DMEM with 0.5% Tween 20 for 1 h at 4 °C. Binding of thrombospondin to GST protein and precipitation of GST-CRT, GST-CRT-N-domain, GST-CRT-P-domain, GST-CRT-C- domain, or GST-CRT-N-domain alone and GST-CRT-N-domain fragments alone were used as controls. The protein complexes were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with GammaBind G-Sepharose conjugated with anti-TSP antibody (7 μg/ml) in PTO buffer (0.1% ovalbumin, 0.5% Tween 20 in DMEM). Immune complexes were washed with washing buffer (DMEM containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS), resuspended in reducing Laemmli buffer, analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10%), transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and detected with rabbit anti-GST antibodies (1:1000) followed by incubation with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:15000). The blots were then developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” We previously reported that TSP/hep I binds calreticulin and that a cell surface form of calreticulin mediates the ability of TSP/hep I to stimulate focal adhesion disassembly (23Goicoechea S.

To further demonstrate the role of calreticulin as a surface receptor for TSP/hep I-induced focal adhesion disassembly, we tested MEF from crt −/− (K42) and wild type (K41) embryos for their ability to respond to TSP/hep I (39Nakamura K. Bossy-Wetzel E. Burns K. Fadel M.P. Lozyk M. Goping I.S. Opas M. Bleackley R.C. Green D.R. Michalak M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 731-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Because K42 cells do not express calreticulin, they provide an excellent tool to investigate the role of calreticulin in thrombospondin and hep I-induced focal adhesion disassembly. As expected, wild type K41 cells were responsive to TSP and hep I-induced focal adhesion disassembly (Fig.1 A). In contrast thrombospondin or hep I did not induce focal adhesion disassembly incrt −/− cells. Responsiveness to TSP/hep I was restored by stable transfection ofcrt −/− cells with calreticulin (K42CRT) (Fig.1 A) (40Nakamura K. Zuppini A. Arnaudeau S. Lynch J. Ahsan I. Krause R. Papp S., De Smedt H. Parys J.B. Muller-Esterl W. Lew D.P. Krause K.H. Demaurex N. Opas M. Michalak M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). These K42CRT cells exhibited cell surface staining for calreticulin (data not shown). Tenascin-C and SPARC also stimulate the loss of focal adhesions but do not appear to utilize calreticulin to signal disassembly (23Goicoechea S. Orr A.W. Pallero M.A. Eggleton P. Murphy-Ullrich J.E.

Biochem. 1995; 57: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). To test the whether the K42 cells had generally lost the ability to restructure focal adhesions, we also tested whether SPARC or tenascin C could induce focal adhesion disassembly in crt −/− cells. Fig.1 B shows that SPARC and tenascin-induced focal adhesion disassembly were unaffected by the lack of calreticulin, indicating that loss of calreticulin does not cause a general unresponsiveness and that the failure to respond is specific for TSP/hep I. The lack of responsiveness of crt −/− cells could possibly be secondary to alterations in protein processing as a function of the chaperone activities of calreticulin and not as a direct consequence of the lack of calreticulin on the cell surface. Therefore, we incubated K42 cells with exogenous recombinant calreticulin for a short time to ascertain whether readdition of calreticulin directly to the cell surface could restore responsiveness to hep I/TSP. These experiments showed that the K42 cells are rescued by short incubations with exogenous recombinant GST-calreticulin prior to the addition of hep I (Fig. 2). GST alone did not rescue calreticulin-null cells. These results are consistent with our earlier observations that signaling in response to hep I occurs through calreticulin on the cell surface and is unrelated to its effects as an ER chaperone (23Goicoechea S.

To identify the specific region of calreticulin involved in the interaction with TSP/hep I, three regions of calreticulin were expressed as GST fusion proteins and used in this study: the GST-N-domain (aa 1–180), the GST-P-domain (aa 181–290), and the GST-C-domain (aa 290–401). GST was used as a control. We examined direct binding between TSP and CRT domains. Binding studies were assessed by incubating 0.2 μm of each calreticulin domain with 0.2 μm purified TSP in DMEM, immunoprecipitating with anti-TSP antibody, and detecting bound GST-CRT domain by Western blotting with anti-GST antibody. There is strong complex formation between the N-terminal domain of calreticulin and thrombospondin and no significant binding to the P- or C-domains (Fig.3 A). Calreticulin has two distinct Ca2+-binding sites: a high capacity site (>25 mol Ca2+/mol of protein) and a high affinity site (K d <10 μm) (27Baksh S. Michalak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21458-21465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Ostwald T.J. MacLennan D.H. Dorrington K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 5867-5871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to Ca2+, calreticulin binds other ions including Zn2+ (24Khanna N.C. Tokuda M. Waisman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8883-8887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Baksh S. Spamer C. Heilmann C. Michalak M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 376: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the effects of Ca2+ and Zn2+ on TSP/CRT interactions. These experiments showed that binding of thrombospondin to the N-domain is enhanced in the presence of physiologic levels of Ca2+ (2 mm) (Fig. 3 B). Zn2+ similarly enhanced binding to the N-domain (Fig.3 C). Thrombospondin did not interact with recombinant GST control in the presence or the absence of Ca2+ or Zn2+ (data not shown). We conclude that in this in vitro system, thrombospondin interacts with the N-terminal domain of calreticulin and that this interaction is modulated by divalent cations. We then investigated whether interactions between calreticulin N-domain and TSP mediate thrombospondin activity. The ability of thrombospondin to stimulate focal adhesion disassembly was examined following preincubation with calreticulin domains (Fig.4 A). Consistent with the binding studies, the N-domain blocks focal adhesion disassembly by thrombospondin. The isolated P- and C-domains have no effect on thrombospondin activity, although these data do not eliminate the possibility that sites within the P- and C-domains can be involved but are not accessible in the absence of the N-doma"

The SULT2B1b isoform preferentially sulfonates cholesterol. Conversely, the SULT2B1a isoform avidly sulfonates pregnenolone but not cholesterol. The outstanding structural feature that distinguishes the SULT2B1 isoforms from the prototypical SULT2A1 isozyme is the presence of extended amino- and carboxyl-terminal ends in the former. Investigating the functional significance of this unique characteristic reveals that removal of 53 amino acids from the relatively long carboxyl-terminal end that is common to both SULT2B1 isoforms has no effect on the catalytic activity of either isoform. On the other hand, removal of 23 amino acids from the amino-terminal end that is unique to SULT2B1b results in loss of cholesterol sulfotransferase activity, whereas removal of 8 amino acids from the amino-terminal end that is unique to SULT2B1a has no effect on pregnenolone sulfotransferase activity. Deletion analysis along with site-directed mutagenesis of SULT2B1b reveal that the amino acid segment 19–23 residues from the amino terminus and particularly isoleucines at positions 21 and 23 are crucial for cholesterol catalysis. In the gene for SULT2B1, exon 1B encodes for only the unique amino-terminal region of SULT2B1b; however, exon 1A encodes for the unique amino-terminal end of SULT2B1a plus an additional 48 amino acids. Thus, if the gene forSULT2B1 employs exon 1B, cholesterol sulfotransferase is synthesized, whereas if exon 1A is used, pregnenolone sulfotransferase is produced.

It should be noted, however, that the gene for SULT2A1encodes for a single polypeptide, whereas the SULT2B1 gene, as a result of an alternative exon 1, encodes for two subtypes differing only at their amino-terminal ends. Thus, the twoSULT genes produce three functionally related polypeptides, the physiologic significance of which is not entirely understood. SULT2A1, which is commonly referred to as dehydroepiandrosterone sulfotransferase, has a broad substrate predilection involving, in addition to dehydroepiandrosterone, a variety of neutral steroids including androgenic steroids. It also sulfonates estrogenic steroids as well as bile acids (6Radominska A. Comer K.A. Zimniak P. Falany J. Iscan M. Falany C.N. Biochem.

Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 2978-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The SULT2B1 isoforms, in contrast to the SULT2A1 isozyme, have a more selective substrate preference and will not, to all intents and purposes, sulfonate testosterone, estradiol, or bile acids (10Javitt N.B. Lee Y.C. Shimizu C. Fuda H. Strott C.A. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 2978-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 11Meloche C.A. Falany C.N. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol.

Notably, the SULT2B1 isoforms, particularly SULT2B1b, sulfonate cholesterol (10Javitt N.B. Lee Y.C. Shimizu C. Fuda H. Strott C.A. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 2978-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and although a clear functional difference between the SULT2B1 isoforms is now emerging, a physiologic distinction between them is not well understood. From a structural point of view, the outstanding feature of the SULT2B1 isoforms, as compared with the SULT2A1 isozyme as well as other cloned steroid and cognate cytosolic sulfotransferases, is their extended amino- and carboxyl-terminal ends. This characteristic intrigued us as to whether there might be functional effects ascribable to either the carboxyl-terminal ends, which are structurally common to the two proteins, and/or the amino-terminal ends, which are structurally unique. The question was, therefore, posed: do either the amino- or the carboxyl-terminal ends of the human SULT2B1 isoforms have an influence on substrate specificity and/or catalysis? Interestingly, the results of these experiments reveal the selective importance of the unique amino-terminal end of the SULT2B1b isoform for both substrate specificity and catalysis. This is in contrast to the unique amino-terminal end of the SULT2B1a isoform, which neither influences substrate specificity nor is required for catalysis. All steroids, sterols, 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin, and 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) were obtained from Sigma. [3H]cholesterol (60 Ci/mmol) and [3H]pregnenolone (17.5 Ci/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Silica gel TLC plates were obtained from Analtech (Newark, MA). Organic solvents were purchased from J. T. Baker Inc. and Mallinckrodt. Prokaryotic expression vectors for human SULT2B1a (GenBankTM accession no. U92314) and SULT2B1b (GenBankTM accession no. U92315) were obtained using PCR atSalI and NotI restriction sites of pGEX-6P-3 fromAmersham Biosciences. Recombinant SULT2B1 subtypes were purified using the GST gene fusion system (Amersham Biosciences) according to a previously reported procedure (13Fuda H. Shimizu C. Lee Y.C., H., A. Strott C.A.

Underlined nucleotides indicateSalI and NotI restriction sites. Open table in a new tab Human SULT2B1a had 52 amino acids removed from the carboxyterminus (COOH) and 8 amino acids removed from the amino terminus (NH3): Human SULT2B1b also had 52 amino acids removed from the carboxyl terminus as well as 8, 18 and 23 amino acids removed from the aminoterminus. In addition, point mutations of a DISEI amino acid sequence (residues 19–23) in the aminoterminal region of SULT2B1b were carried out (compare Fig. 2). Underlined nucleotides indicateSalI and NotI restriction sites. Mutations involving specific amino acid residues of the amino-terminal region of SULT2B1b were generated using QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). Briefly, 25 ng of pGEX-SULT2B1b were used as a template and mutated nucleotide primers as described in Table I. PCR conditions were: predenaturing at 95 °C for 2 min, followed by 18 cycles of denaturing at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 6 min. After digestion with DpnI, 2 μl of PCR product were used to transform XL10-Gold competent cells provided with the kit. Sequencing identified appropriate clones. Sulfotransferase activity was determined using radiolabeled cholesterol and pregnenolone. Twenty-μl reaction volumes contained the same concentration of either an overexpressed and purified wild type protein or a mutant construct (4.0 μg/tube, SULT2B1a, and 0.4 μg/tube, SULT2B1b for cholesterol (5 μm); 0.4 μg/tube, SULT2B1a, and 0.4 μg/tube, SULT2B1b for pregnenolone (20 μm)) in 0.1 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin, and 4% ethanol (v/v). Reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 5 min and stopped by placing tubes in boiling water for 5 min. To each reaction tube, 10 μl of 5 mg/ml of either cholesterol sulfate or pregnenolone sulfate in 10% 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin were added as a carrier, and 5 μl were applied to a TLC plate, which was developed using a solvent system consisting of chloroform/methanol/acetone/acetic acid/water (8:2:4:2:1). After drying, the TLC plate was exposed to I2 vapor to visualize the steroid/sterol sulfate spots, which were excised, and the radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. For the kinetic analyses, assays were similarly carried out using the following purified protein preparation: SULT2B1a, 4.0 μg, and SULT2B1b, 0.4 μg in the cholesterol assay, and SULT2B1a, 0.4 μg, SULT2B1b, 0.4 μg in the pregnenolone assay. The wild type protein preparations used throughout this investigation as well as all mutated protein preparations were judged to be >90% pure based on analysis by SDS-PAGE and protein staining (data not presented). A steady state analysis of the SULT2B1 isoforms using cholesterol and pregnenolone as substrates is depicted in Fig.1. The SULT2B1a isoform avidly sulfonates pregnenolone, whereas sulfonation of cholesterol is minimal. In contrast, the SULT2B1b isoform preferentially sulfonates cholesterol, reaching a maximum at a substrate concentration of 5 μm. SULT2B1b, however, also sulfonates pregnenolone, although a steady state is not reached until the substrate concentration reaches ∼20 μm, at which point the sulfonation of pregnenolone essentially equals that of cholesterol. Nevertheless, the greater efficiency of the SULT2B1b isoform for cholesterol is revealed by a kcat/K m ratio of 11.1 ± 1.2m−1S−1 × 103 for cholesterol versus 1.6 ± 0.4m−1S−1 × 103 for pregnenolone. Notably, neither SULT2B1 isoform sulfonates dehydroepiandrosterone efficiently (data not presented). Removal of 53 amino acids from the carboxyl-terminal end that is common to both SULT2B1a and SULT2B1b (compare Fig. 2) does not significantly reduce the ability of either SULT2B1a to sulfonate pregnenolone or SULT2B1b to sulfonate cholesterol (Fig.3). Likewise, removal of 8 amino acids from the amino-terminal end that is unique to the SULT2B1a isoform (compare Fig. 2) does not significantly alter pregnenolone sulfotransferase activity (Fig. 3). On the other hand, removal of 23 amino acids from the amino-terminal end that is unique to the SULT2B1b isoform (compare Fig. 2) results in an almost complete loss in cholesterol sulfotransferase activity (Fig. 3).Figure 3Sulfotransferase activity after truncation of the amino- and carboxyl-terminal ends of the SULT2B1 isoforms.Wild type (WT) of SULT2B1a and SULT2B1b and constructs of each isoform lacking either the unique amino-terminal end ((−)NH 3) or 52 amino acids from the common carboxyl-terminal end ((−)COOH) (compare Fig. 2) were prepared as GST fusion proteins, cleaved, affinity-purified, and assayed for either pregnenolone (SULT2B1a) or cholesterol (SULT2B1b) sulfotransferase activity as described under “Experimental Procedures” using 20 and 5 μm, respectively, of each substrate. Negative control (Neg. Ctr.) indicates the result when a wild type preparation is assayed in the absence of the PAPS cofactor. The top of each column represents the mean of five replicates, and error barsindicate the standard deviation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In contrast to the removal of the first 23 amino acids from the amino-terminal end of SULT2B1b, which leads to a loss in catalysis, cholesterol sulfotransferase activity is essentially unaffected after removal of the first 8 amino acids (Fig. 4). Although removal of the first 18 amino acids results in an apparent increase in catalytic activity (Fig. 4), the K mvalue of 1.1 μm for the −18 amino-terminal truncated protein is not significantly different from the K mvalue of 1.2 μm for wild type. The loss in catalytic activity that occurs between the −18 and −23 amino-terminal truncations of SULT2B1b clearly indicates that the sequence ofDISEI between residues 18 and 24 (compare Fig. 2) is crucial for functionality. Therefore, this sequence was analyzed by alanine scanning (Fig. 5). D19A, S21A, and E22A substitutions result in levels of cholesterol sulfotransferase activity that are higher than that of wild type, although theK m values for these substitutions are, respectively, 1.7, 1.8, and 1.9 μm, they are not significantly different from the K m value of 1.8 μmfor wild type. In contrast to the aforementioned substitutions, both the I20A and I23A substitutions result in a nearly complete loss of cholesterol sulfotransferase activity (Fig. 5). Interestingly, the latter substitutions have no effect on the ability of this isoform to sulfonate pregnenolone (compare Fig. 1) (data not shown). This phenomenon was further examined by determining the effect of substituting a variety of amino acids other than alanine for the isoleucines at positions 20 and 23. Substitutions were carried out separately for each isoleucine residue with results that are essentially the same (Fig. 6). Substitutions involving a negatively charged (glutamic acid) and a positively charged (lysine) amino acid, as well as a substitution involving a polar but uncharged amino acid with a side chain similar in size to isoleucine (glutamine), result in loss of catalytic activity similar to the alanine substitutions (Fig. 6). On the other hand, use of a conservative substitution (leucine) results in 80% (residue 20) and 100% (residue 23) retention of catalytic activity (Fig. 6). Use of methionine, a somewhat less conservative substitution for isoleucine than leucine but with a side chain similar in size, results in a partial retention (∼30% at residue 20 and 60% at residue 23) in cholesterol sulfotransferase activity (Fig. 6). Importantly, theK m values of 1.4 μm for wild type and 1.7 μm for I20L, 1.7 μm for I23L, 1.4 μm for I20M, and 1.3 μm for I23M are not significantly different. Overall, the SULT2A1 and SULT2B1 isozymes are ∼37% identical at the amino acid level. If, however, the extended amino- and carboxyl-terminal ends of the SULT2B1 isoforms are excluded, identities increase to ∼48%. Interestingly, all previously cloned members of the mammalian cytosolic sulfotransferase superfamily, i.e.estrogen and phenol sulfotransferases as well as hydroxysteroid sulfotransferases, have sizes that range from 282 to 295 amino acids, whereas SULT2B1a and SULT2B1b consist of 350 and 365 amino acids, respectively. Nonetheless, the extended amino- and carboxyl-terminal ends of the SULT2B1 isoforms aside, there remains a significant structural similarity between the SULT2A1 and SULT2B1 isozymes in their core regions. Most notably, a PSB loop (a P-loop motif found at phosphate-binding sites of nucleotide-binding proteins) and specific amino acid residues important in protein-cofactor interaction of cytosolic sulfotransferases (15Yoshinari K. Petrotchenko E.V. Pedersen L.C. Negishi M. J. Biochem. Molec. Toxicol. 2001; 15: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 16Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.G. Carter C.W. Negishi M. Pedersen L.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 904-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) are with but one exception completely conserved (compare Fig. 2). Furthermore, regions interacting with the 5′- (5′-PB) and 3′- (3′-PB) phosphate groups of PAPS are highly conserved. Of particular structural interest is a conserved lysine at residue 55 in SULT2B1a and residue 70 in SULT2B1b along with a conserved serine at residue 140 in SULT2B1a and residue 155 in SULT2B1b. The significance of this is that in the crystal structure of human estrogen sulfotransferase-PAPS complex, the side chain nitrogen of a comparable lysine, is thought to interact with the side chain hydroxyl of a comparable serine, indicating that the serine plays an important role in regulating side chain interaction of the catalytic lysine with the bridging oxygen between the 5′-phosphate and sulfate of PAPS (17Pedersen L.C. Petrotchenko E. Shevtsov S. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17928-17932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The core regions of the SULT2B1 isoforms thus contain residues that are highly conserved in all cytosolic sulfotransferases, residues now considered to be involved in interaction with the PAPS cofactor. This leaves the extended amino- and carboxyl-terminal ends as the most outstanding feature of the SULT2B1 isoforms and the principal structural distinction between them and the prototypical SULT2A1 isozyme as well as other members of the large cytosolic sulfotransferase superfamily. The functional significance of the extended carboxyl-terminal end of the SULT2B1 isoforms is not known. One speculation is that this region, which is enriched in prolines, might play a role in protein-protein interactions (10Javitt N.B. Lee Y.C. Shimizu C. Fuda H. Strott C.A. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 2978-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Regardless, it is notable that the relatively long carboxyl-terminal extension (53 amino acids), which is structurally common to both SULT2B1 isoforms, can be removed without producing a significant change in the catalytic behavior of either isoform. On the other hand, removal of the unique amino-terminal ends, which distinguish the SULT2B1 isoforms, produces interesting results. Firstly, removal of the unique amino-terminal end of SULT2B1a consisting of 8 amino acids does not significantly alter catalytic activity, whereas removal of the unique amino-terminal end of SULTT2B1b consisting of 23 amino acids has a profound influence on cholesterol catalysis. The latter finding notwithstanding, however, the first 18 amino acids of the SULT2B1b amino-terminal region are not essential for catalytic activity, which leads to the second point. That is, the 5-amino acid segment between residues 18 and 24 from the amino terminus of SULT2B1b is the crucial structural feature of this isoform that is essential for full cholesterol sulfotransferase activity. Thirdly, the isoleucines within this 5-amino acid segment of SULT2B1b are critically involved in catalytic behavior. Additionally, based on the testing of a variety of amino acid substitutions, it appears that only a hydrophobic amino acid with a side chain of optimal size can effectively function at these positions. That is, alanine does not work, whereas leucine works essentially as well as isoleucine; furthermore, methionine, although less effective than isoleucine, is also able to sustain significant enzymatic activity. Both of the latter substitutions, interestingly, produce enzymes withK m values similar to the wild type protein, denoting the effectiveness of these conservative substitutions. Conversely, charged and polar amino acid substitutions at either of the isoleucine positions are unable to sustain enzymatic activity. Interestingly, in the SULT2B1a isoform, the amino acid residues at positions comparable to the isoleucines at positions 20 and 23 in SULT2B1b, are proline and histidine, respectively (compare Fig. 2). The unique amino-terminal end of SULT2B1b is clearly responsible for the ability of this isoform to sulfonate cholesterol. Conversely, the unique amino-terminal end of SULT2B1a is not required for this isoform to sulfonate pregnenolone, and thus its functional significance is not presently appreciated. The importance of the amino-terminal end of SULT2B1b for cholesterol specificity as well as catalysis is further emphasized by the fact that, in face of the various truncations and amino acid substitutions carried out on this isoform, which profoundly influence cholesterol reactivity, there is no adverse effect of any of these machinations on the ability of SULT2B1b to sulfonate pregnenolone. In essence, with the unique amino-terminal end of SULT2B1b removed, it behaves essentially like SULT2B1a. It seems curious that the unique amino terminus of one SULT2B1 isoform is absolutely essential for functionality, whereas a related structural characteristic in the other isoform is not required for it to normally function. Of course, this paradox or mystery should largely disappear once the three-dimensional structures have been solved. The gene for human SULT2B1 consists of an exon 1B, an exon 1A, and exons 2–6: the SULT2B1a isoform is encoded by exons 1A and exons 2–6, and the SULT2B1b isoform is encoded by exon 1B, the final 143 nucleotides of exon 1A, plus exons 2–6 (1Her C. Wood T.C. Eichler E.E. Mohrenweiser H.W. Ramagli L.S. Siciliano M.J. Weinshilboum R.M. Genomics. 1998; 53: 284-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Exon 1B is composed of a 5′-untranslated region consisting of 129 nucleotides and the coding region for the first 23 amino acids of SULT2B1b, which represents the entire amino-terminal region that is unique to this isoform (1Her C. Wood T.C. Eichler E.E. Mohrenweiser H.W. Ramagli L.S. Siciliano M.J. Weinshilboum R.M. Genomics. 1998; 53: 284-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Exon 1A, on the other hand, in addition to a 179-nucleotide 5′-untranslated region, encodes for the first 56 amino acids of SULT2B1a, of which only the first 8 amino acids are unique to this isoform (1Her C.

Thus, when the gene for human SULT2B1 employs exon 1B, cholesterol sulfotransferase is synthesized, whereas when the gene uses exon 1A, pregnenolone sulfotransferase is produced. This raises an interesting question regarding the biological significance of this differential expression? In considering feasible physiological implications of the differential expression of the gene for human SULT2B1, two organ systems loom as particularly attractive, i.e. skin and brain. It is now recognized that cholesterol sulfate plays an essential role in skin development and creation of the barrier (18Kuroki T. Ikuta T. Kashiwagi M. Kawabe S. Ohba M. Huh N. Mizuno K. Ohno S.

Furthermore, as determined by real-time PCR, expression of the human SULT2B1b isoform, which we now recognize as a cholesterol sulfotransferase, is higher in skin than in any other organ with the possible exception of the placenta and the prostate. 2H. Fuda, Y. C. Lee, C. Shimizu, N. B. Javitt, and C. A. Strott, unpublished observations. Although expression of the human SULT2B1 isoforms in the adult central nervous system remains to be adequately examined, the human fetal brain, as determined by reverse transcription-PCR, appears to express only the SULT2B1a isoform (12Geese W.J. Raftogianis R.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 280-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the mouse SULT2B1a ortholog appears to be almost exclusively expressed in brain tissue. 3C. Shimizu, H. Fuda, H. Yanai, and C. A. Strott, unpublished observations. The significance of these findings is that sulfated pregnenolone, which is produced most efficiently by the action of the SULT2B1a isoform, is now appreciated as an essential neurosteroid (22Baulieu E.E.

Here we report the cloning of the entire coding region of a novel collagen-like protein by yeast two-hybrid screening of a 17.5-day whole mouse embryo cDNA library using HSP47 as a bait. The cDNA of this protein and its deduced amino acid sequence are 2,690 bp and 438 amino acids long, respectively. The protein contains two clusters of Gly-X-Y collagenous repeats and three noncollagenous domains. Northern blot analysis showed that its mRNA is specifically expressed in the testis and ovary in adult tissues and that expression in these tissues is highest in the neonate. Biochemical characterization of this protein revealed that its proline residues are hydroxylated, it undergoes N-linked glycosylation, it forms trimers, and it is secreted in vitro. Immunohistochemical studies showed that the myoid cells and the pre-theca cells synthesized it in the testis and ovary, respectively, resulting in the accumulation of this protein in the extracellular spaces of these organs. These observations suggest that this protein is a new member of the collagen protein family. We thus designated this protein as type XXVI collagen.

During the development of mammals, these collagens are expressed in various spatiotemporal patterns. The fibril-forming collagens are the most abundant of the collagens and include types I, II, and III (6Kadler K.E. Holmes D.F. Trotter J.A. Chapman J.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). Other collagens known as the FACIT collagens (Fibril-associated Collagens withInterrupted Triple Helices), which include types IX, XII, XIV, XVI, and XIX, associate with the surface of the collagen fibrils and modify their interactive properties (7Koch M.

In addition, nonfibrillar collagens, which include types XIII, XVII, and XXV, are reported to have transmembrane domains and appear to localize at the cell surface (5Hashimoto T. Wakabayashi T.

Despite the differences among the collagens, all share in common a triple helical structure composed of three polypeptides consisting of Gly-X-Y repeats, where X is any amino acid, and Y is frequently proline or hydroxyproline. Each chain is a left-handed helix, and the three chains wind around each other in a right-handed superhelix (1Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.J. Ann. Med. 2001; 33: 7-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 6Kadler K.E. Holmes D.F. Trotter J.A. Chapman J.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). The procollagens are synthesized in and cotranslationally transported into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).1 After translation is completed, the procollagens form a trimer at the C terminus. Only properly folded triple helical forms of procollagens are secreted by the cells. During collagen biosynthesis, the nascent procollagen chain is modified by unique enzymes that include prolyl-4 hydroxylase, which stabilize the triple helical structure. After being secreted by the cell, the N- and C-propeptides are cleaved by specific proteases, thereafter forming collagen bundles or basement membranes (1Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.J. Ann.

This protein associates with procollagen during its folding and/or post-translational modification in the ER. Recent studies have revealed that HSP47 plays a critical role in collagen biosynthesis (16Nagata K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 22-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Type I collagen secreted by cells from hsp47-null mice is abnormal in that its N- and C-propeptides are improperly cleaved, and the protease-sensitivity in its triple helix domain is altered (17Nagai N. Hosokawa M. Itohara S. Adachi E. Matsushita T. Hosokawa N. Nagata K. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1499-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The tissues ofhsp47-null mice lack collagen fibrils and basement membranes, and the mice died before E11.5. HSP47 has been reported to bind to various types of collagen (at least types I–V) in vitro (18Nakai A. Satoh M. Hirayoshi K. Nagata K. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 903-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 19Natsume T. Koide T. Hirayoshi K. Nagata K. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 469-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Furthermore, synthetic model peptides representing the collagenous triple helix domain and yeast two-hybrid screening revealed that HSP47 specifically binds to the helix-forming portions of procollagen (21Koide T. Asada S. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34523-34526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 22Tasab M. Batten M.R. Bulleid N.J.

To investigate the role of HSP47 further, we searched for proteins that interact with HSP47 by performing yeast two-hybrid screening using HSP47 as a bait. This experiment identified a gene encoding a novel collagen-like protein that contains two collagenous domains consisting of Gly-X-Y repeats and three noncollagenous domains. We demonstrate here that this protein is secreted into the culture medium with modifications typically seen in other types of collagens, namely, N-linked glycosylation and hydroxylation of proline and/or lysine residues. This protein also forms a trimer and accumulates in the extracellular matrix of mouse tissues. These collagen-like features led us to designate this protein as type XXVI collagen. This protein is produced in the testis and ovary of adult mice but is also present at higher levels in the reproductive tissues of neonates, suggesting that it plays an important role in the development of the reproductive tissues. Restriction enzymes and other DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased from Takara Shuzo Co. Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). DNA fragments were synthesized by Hokkaido System Science, (Sapporo, Japan). Chemicals were purchased from either Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan) or Wako Pure Chemical Co. (Osaka, Japan). DNA sequencing was carried out on an ABI PRISM 377A sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Forester City, CA). ICR mice were purchased from Japan SLC, Inc. (Shizuoka, Japan). The ER retention sequence of mouse hsp47cDNA was deleted, and the remaining cDNA was used as bait in yeast two-hybrid screening. The cDNA was amplified by PCR and inserted into pAS2-1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Following the methods recommended by the manufacturer, a 1.8-kb cDNA fragment of type XXVI collagen was cloned from the cDNA library of 17.5-day whole mouse embryo (Clontech). A 2.7-kb type XXVI collagen cDNA was also cloned from a 15.5-day mouse embryo cDNA library (Invitrogen) using a specific probe prepared from the sequence data of the 1.8-kb cloned fragment. Marathon-ReadyTM cDNA from mouse testis (Clontech) was used as a template for 5′-RACE and resulted in the acquisition of 79 bp of upstream sequence. The program BLAST was used to predict the putative signal sequence (25Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68368) Google Scholar). Freshly removed organs of mice of various ages were homogenized in TRIZOL Reagent (Invitrogen). Total RNA was extracted with TRIZOL according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA samples were fractionated on a formaldehyde, MOPS, EDTA, 1% agarose gel and then transferred to nylon membranes and cross-linked by baking at 80 °C for 2 h. The filters were subsequently incubated with several radiolabeled probes. These included a 696-bp fragment amplified by PCR from type XXVI collagen cDNA, a 1.5-kb EcoRI-HindIII fragment of hsp47cDNA (26Takechi H. Hirayoshi K. Nakai A. Kudo H. Saga S. Nagata K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and a 1.3-kb PstI fragment of chickGAPDH cDNA (27Dugaiczyk A. Haron J.A. Stone E.M. Dennison O.E. Rothblum K.N. Schwartz R.J. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 1605-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Prehybridization and hybridization were performed using Perfect Hyb. (Toyobo, Tokyo) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Type XXVI collagen cDNA generated by PCR was cloned into the expression vector pCMV-Tag4 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to construct type XXVI collagen tagged with FLAG at its C terminus. The same expression vector was also used to create the protein without the tag. Polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits against GST-fusion proteins corresponding to the region of either NC2 or NC3 of the type XXVI collagen following the standard protocols. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The filters were blocked with 5% skim milk in PBS for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with a 1:500 dilution of rabbit antiserum against type XXVI collagen (NC3) in PBS with 5% skim milk. After washing with PBS, the filters were incubated with a 1:1,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Cappel, Aurora, OH) for 30 min at room temperature and washed with 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS. Signals were detected using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with the plasmid encoding C-terminal FLAG-tagged type XXVI collagen and then cultured on coverslips for ∼12 h in the presence of 136 μg/ml ascorbate phosphate. The cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. After permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min, the coverslips were rinsed and then blocked with 10% nonimmune goat serum and 2.5% skim milk in PBS overnight at 4 °C. Thereafter, the cells were incubated with a mixture of the primary antibodies specific for FLAG (Stratagene) and calnexin (SPA-860, Stressgen, Victoria, B. C., Canada) which had both been diluted 1:1,000 in PBS containing 10% nonimmune goat serum and 2.5% skim milk. Goat anti-mouse IgG coupled to rhodamine and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG were used as secondary antibodies at a dilution of 1:200. The coverslips were mounted, and the cells were observed using an Axiophoto 2 and photographed with Axiovision (Carl Zeiss Co., Ltd., Jena, Germany). HEK-293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/medium F12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfection of the cells with 1 μg of the plasmids encoding type XXVI collagen was performed using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. Cells transfected with the expression vector pCMV-Tag4 were used as a negative control. HEK-293 cells were preincubated with medium lacking methionine for 30 min and labeled with 35S-Promix (AmershamBiosciences) for 30 min. During the subsequent chase period, the cells were incubated with medium containing excess methionine. For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mmNaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA) were mixed with the anti-type XXVI collagen antibody NC3, and the immune complexes were collected using protein A-Sepharose beads (AmershamBiosciences). Immunoprecipitates were separated on 10% or 8% SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions. After electrophoresis, the gels were dried and exposed to Fuji HR-HA 30 film (Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd., Kanagawa, Japan). To inhibit the N-linked glycosylation and prolyl-4 hydroxylation of type XXVI collagen, cells were incubated with 5 μg/ml tunicamycin for 12 h and treated with 0.3 mm α,α′-dipyridyl for 30 min before cell labeling. To examine the release of N-glycans from type XXVI collagen molecules, the immunoprecipitates were treated with either endoglycosidase H as reported (28Amara J.F. Lederkremer G. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3315-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) or with PNGase F according to the manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA). Samples were then resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. The neonatal testes (5 days after birth) and ovaries (7 days after birth) were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, embedded in methyl methacrylate resin, and sectioned into 5-μm slices. The sections were then blocked for 1 h at room temperature and incubated overnight at 4 °C with a 1:100 dilution of anti-type XXVI collagen antibody NC2 or a 1:100 dilution of preimmune rabbit serum. Signals were detected with Tyramide Signal Amplification plus dinitrophenyl horseradish peroxidase system (MENTM, Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After detection of the signals, sections were counterstained with 1% methyl green (Muto Pure Chemicals Ltd., Tokyo) and mounted. Signals were observed using an Axiophoto 2 and photographed with Axiovision. In search of proteins interacting with HSP47, a collagen-specific molecular chaperone, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening using as bait HSP47 lacking its ER retention sequence, RDEL. We obtained a clone containing a 1,825-bp fragment that encoded a protein with two collagenous domains. Because this clone was thought to contain only part of the full-length cDNA, further cloning was performed on a 15.5-day whole mouse embryo cDNA library encompassing 5 × 106clones. The probe used was a digoxigenin-labeled oligonucleotide probe prepared from the sequence data of the previously cloned fragment. A clone containing the 2,690-bp full-length cDNA sequence was obtained (Fig. 1 A). 5′-RACE was also performed using a specific probe prepared from the cDNA sequence data to obtain the 79-bp upstream region of the cDNA (Fig.1 A). The full-length cDNA clone encodes a 438-amino acid protein (Fig. 1 A) that consists of two collagenous domains (COL1 and COL2) and three noncollagenous domains (NC1–NC3) (Fig.1 B). The protein also contains a putative ER-targeting signal sequence at its N terminus and two Asn-X-Ser/Thr sequences that are consensus motifs for Asn-linked glycosylation. The homology search using BLAST revealed that this protein is almost identical to the mouse emu2 protein and the putative human emu2 protein with the exception of 2 amino acids. Only the sequences of these two proteins have been reported previously, but studies to characterize them have, to our knowledge, not been performed. Apart from its two collagenous regions, this protein has no obvious sequence homology to any other collagen. However, as described below, this protein is also collagen-like in its secretion from the cells, the localization in the extracellular spaces, and the post-translational modifications it undergoes. We have thus designated this novel protein as type XXVI collagen. The 13 cysteine residues of the protein are found only in the NC1 domain, including in the putative signal sequence (Fig. 1 A, shown by circles), which is a unique feature of this collagen-like protein relative to the other types of collagens. There is also a possible furin protease cleavage site (RRRR, Fig.1 A, broken line) just before the COL1 domain, which is commonly observed in the transmembrane collagens such as types XIII and XXV. These latter transmembrane collagens are cleaved just before the COL1 domain. However, we did not observe that type XXVI collagen undergoes this cleavage because the fragment that would result from this cleavage was not detected in the murine tissues that express type XXVI collagen (data not shown). Furthermore, cells transfected with cDNA encoding type XXVI collagen did not release the cleaved fragment into the medium (data not shown). Type XXVI collagen also does not have transmembrane domains. We next examined the regional expression of this novel collagen-like gene in adult murine tissues. Northern blotting revealed that type XXVI collagen gene mRNA is markedly expressed in the testis and ovary (Fig.2 A) and weakly in the kidney. We next examined its expression level during the postnatal development of the testis and ovary (Fig. 2 B). In the testis, the type XXVI collagen gene is expressed at its highest levels 1 day after birth, after which the mRNA levels gradually decrease during germ cell development. In the ovary, the type XXVI collagen gene is highly expressed in the first 2 weeks after birth, after which expression also decreases. These expression patterns of the type XXVI collagen gene are very similar to that of hsp47 expression in both the testis and ovary (Fig. 2 B). That the expression of hsp47correlates spatiotemporally with the expression of various collagen genes has previously been reported by our group (16Nagata K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 22-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 17Nagai N. Hosokawa M. Itohara S. Adachi E. Matsushita T. Hosokawa N. Nagata K. J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 31224-31228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We raised two antibodies against type XXVI collagen in rabbits using GST-NC2 and GST-NC3 fusion proteins as antigens (see Fig. 1 B). These antibodies were tested for specificity with an extract of cells transfected with an expression plasmid containing type XXVI collagen cDNA. Both antibodies recognized a single 60 kDa band (data not shown). Western blot analysis under reducing conditions showed that both the anti-NC3 antiserum (Fig.3) and the anti-NC2 antiserum (data not shown) recognize an ∼60 kDa band in extracts of neonatal mouse testes and ovaries (Fig. 3). The levels of this 60 kDa band gradually decreased after birth as the testis and ovary matured (Fig. 3). These expression patterns are consistent with those revealed by Northern blot analysis. In adult mice (8 weeks old), low levels of type XXVI collagen protein were observed in both the testis and ovary, but no protein was detected in the somatic tissues such as the brain, heart, intestine, and kidney (data not shown). The antibodies also faintly recognized a 70-kDa protein in both the testis and ovary (shown by * in Fig. 3). This band is thought to be an unspecific signal rather than a modified form of type XXVI collagen because its expression pattern did not coincide with that of the mRNA in Northern blotting, nor did immunoprecipitation with anti-type XXVI collagen antibody precipitate a 70-kDa protein (data not shown). Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of postnatal day 7 testicular extract showed that type XXVI collagen has an isoelectric point of 6.5 (data not shown). COS-7 cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding type XXVI collagen tagged with the FLAG epitope at its C terminus to assess the intracellular localization of type XXVI collagen. Double staining with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody and anti-calnexin polyclonal antibody revealed that type XXVI collagen colocalizes with calnexin, an ER marker, indicating that type XXVI collagen is targeted to the ER (Fig.4). To determine whether type XXVI collagen is secreted, HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid encoding type XXVI collagen, and a pulse-chase experiment was performed in the presence of ascorbate, a cofactor of prolyl-4 hydroxylase, prolyl-3 hydroxylase, and lysyl hydroxylase (Fig.5). Cell extracts and the medium were immunoprecipitated with the NC3 antibody, and the precipitates were run on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel under reducing and nonreducing conditions. The transfected HEK-293 cells release type XXVI collagen that appears as a ∼60-kDa protein under reducing conditions (Fig. 5 A,lane 2). Under nonreducing conditions, two higher molecular size species of ∼120 and ∼200 kDa were observed in the medium (Fig. 5 B, lane 2), suggesting that type XXVI collagen forms dimer and/or trimer structures like the other collagens. However, type XXVI collagen is secreted into the culture medium more slowly than other collagen molecules (Fig. 5 A) (29Hosokawa N. Hohenadl C. Satoh M. Kuhn K. Nagata K. J. Biochem. 1998; 124: 654-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Notably, in the medium, the trimer form of type XXVI collagen predominates (Fig. 5 B, lanes 7 and 8), whereas the type XXVI collagen in the cell extracts is present as a mix of monomers, dimers, and trimers (Fig. 5 B, lanes 2–4). The type XXVI collagen proteins secreted into the medium have a slightly higher molecular size than the proteins within the cells (Fig. 5 A, compare lanes 2–4 andlanes 7 and 8), suggesting the protein is glycosylated just before it is secreted (see Figs.6 and7).Figure 6Effects of the addition of ascorbate, α,α′-dipyridyl, and tunicamycin on the hydroxylation, glycosylation, and secretion of type XXVI collagen. HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected with cDNA encoding type XXVI collagen and then cultured for 24 h in the presence or absence of 136 μg/ml ascorbate phosphate. The cells were then preincubated with either 0.3 mmα,α′-dipyridyl for 30 min or with 5 μg/ml tunicamycin for 12 h, after which the cells were labeled by culturing them with 0.1 mCi/ml [35S]methionine in medium lacking methionine for 3 h. The cell extract and the medium were then immunoprecipitated with anti-type XXVI collagen NC3 antibody. Immunoprecipitated samples were resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE under reducing (A) or nonreducing (B) conditions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 7Characterization of N-linked glycosylation of secreted type XXVI collagen. HEK-293 cells transiently transfected with type XXVI collagen cDNA were cultured for 24 h in medium containing 136 μg/ml ascorbate phosphate. The cells were labeled by culturing them with 0.1 mCi/ml [35S]methionine in medium lacking methionine for 3 h. The cellular and medium fractions were immunoprecipitated with anti-type XXVI collagen antibody NC3.

The samples were resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To assess whether collagen XXVI is subjected to prolyl and lysyl hydroxylation, the cells were labeled and treated with α,α′-dipyridyl, an iron-chelating agent that prevents prolyl and lysyl hydroxylation in the presence of ascorbate. The type XXVI collagen originating from α,α′-dipyridyl-treated cells migrated slightly faster under reducing conditions than the collagen from untreated cells (Fig. 6 A, compare lanes 2 and3). In the absence of ascorbate, treatment with α,α′-dipyridyl did not affect the migration of type XXVI collagen derived from the cell (Fig. 6, lanes 10 and 11). Furthermore, in the absence of ascorbate, the secretion of type XXVI collagen was negligible (Fig. 6, lane 14). Cells treated with α,α′-dipyridyl in the presence of ascorbate dramatically reduced their secretion of type XXVI collagen (Fig. 6, lane 7). Thus, type XXVI collagen is hydroxylated in the ER like other collagens, and only hydroxylated type XXVI collagen is secreted into the medium. When the cells were labeled in the presence of tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation, a 51-kDa form of type XXVI collagen was detected in the cell extract (Fig. 6 A,lane 4). This suggests that the two putativeN-linked glycosylation sites in type XXVI collagen are indeed both glycosylated. The secretion of type XXVI collagen was also prevented by the tunicamycin treatment (Fig 6 A, comparelanes 6 and 8). As shown in Figs. 5 and 6, secreted type XXVI collagen migrates slower than the cell-derived protein under reducing conditions (Fig.5 A, lanes 3 and 7, and Fig.6 A, lanes 2 and 6). To assess why the migration rate differs, we treated the cells with PNGase F and endoglycosidase H. Both enzymes released the N-glycans from the cell-derived type XXVI collagen (Fig. 7, lanes 3 and5) but the N-glycans from the secreted type XXVI collagen were released by treatment with PNGase F only (Fig. 7,lane 9), not endoglycosidase H (Fig. 7, lane 11). Thus, the N-linked glycans on type XXVI collagen are processed to the complex type when the protein is in the Golgi apparatus awaiting secretion. To determine the localization of type XXVI collagen in the testis and ovary, we performed immunohistochemical analysis using the NC2 antibody. In the 5-day-old testis, only myoid cells were stained (Fig. 8 B). Other somatic cells such as Leydig or Sertoli cells were not stained nor were germ cells such as spermatogonia. In the 7-day-old ovary, although the primary follicles were not stained, pre-theca cells surrounding primary follicles and the extracellular matrix region of medulla and cortex were recognized by the antibody (Fig. 8 D). This observation confirms that type XXVI collagen is secreted in vivo. In both the testis and ovary, no signal was detected after staining with preimmune serum (Fig. 8, A and B). Thus, like other collagen molecules, type XXVI collagen accumulates in the extracellular matrix. This suggests that this novel collagen may be involved in the early development of testis and ovary as an extracellular matrix component. We performed yeast two-hybrid screening using HSP47 as a bait to identify proteins that interact with HSP47. This resulted in the cloning and characterization of a novel protein. This protein has a signal sequence at its N terminus, two collagenous domains, and three noncollagenous domains. Collagen-like features of this protein are indicated by several observations: first, it possesses two clusters of Gly-X-Y repeats; second, it forms a trimer and is secreted into the culture medium; third, it is hydroxylated andN-linked glycosylated; and fourth, immunohistochemical analysis of the testis and ovary indicates its presence in the extracellular matrix region. These features indicate that this protein can be considered as a new member of collagen. Thus, we designated this protein as type XXVI collagen because 25 types of collagens have been reported to date (1Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.J. Ann.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1524-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In adult mice, type XXVI collagen mRNA is found mainly in the testis and ovary and slightly in the kidney. During early testis and ovary development, type XXVI collagen is highly expressed in myoid cells and pre-theca cells, respectively. That HSP47 is indispensable in collagen biosynthesis has been demonstrated by the analysis of hsp47 −/− mice (17Nagai N. Hosokawa M. Itohara S. Adachi E. Matsushita T. Hosokawa N. Nagata K. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1499-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The null mutation of hsp47 is lethal during embryonic development, and it has been shown that the embryos lack collagen fibrils and basement membranes in their tissues. This suggests that in these mice, the molecular maturation of collagen is impaired. This notion is supported by the improper cleavage of the type I collagen N- and C-propeptides and the enhanced sensitivity of secreted type I collagen to proteases. Recently, it was shown that Gly-X-Arg triplets in the collagen triple helix are dominant binding sites for HSP47 (24Koide T. Takahara Y. Asada S. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6178-6182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Type XXVI collagen also possesses two Gly-X-Y clusters, both of which contain Gly-X-Arg triplets. Thus, HSP47 may also interact with this novel collagen through these motifs. Further supporting the importance in development of interactions between HSP47 and collagen is that although collagen XXVI is expressed in the adult testis and ovary, this expression is higher in the neonatal tissues. Furthermore, we also detected high levels of type XXVI collagen expression during embryogenesis. 2K. Sato, N. Hosokawa, and K. Nagata, unpublished results. Thus, type XXVI collagen together with HSP47 may be important not only during testis and ovary development but also in embryogenesis. This is similar to type XIX collagen, which was reported to be ubiquitously expressed during embryogenesis, whereas in adulthood its expression was restricted to just a few tissues (30Sumiyoshi H. Inoguchi K. Khaleduzzaman M. Ninomiya Y. Yoshioka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17104-17111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The roles that type XXVI collagen and HSP47 play during embryogenesis are currently being investigated. In the case of type I collagen, three α-chains are associated in the C-propeptide region and form intermolecular disulfide bonds (1Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.J. Ann. Med. 2001; 33: 7-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 6Kadler K.E. Holmes D.F. Trotter J.A. Chapman J.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). In contrast, type XXVI collagen bears its 13 cysteine residues only in the N-terminal portion of its first noncollagenous region (NC1), including in its signal sequences. The electrophoresis of cell-derived and secreted XXVI collagen revealed that this protein forms multimers by establishing intermolecular disulfide bonds. Notably, the trimer form was the predominantly secreted form. Thus, trimers of type XXVI collagen must arise from intermolecular disulfide bonds between the NC1 regions. This is a unique feature of this protein relative to the other collagens. When extracts of the neonatal testis or of cells transfected with type XXVI collagen cDNA were immunoprecipitated with anti-type XXVI collagen antibody, only one band was detected. This suggests that the type XXVI collagen trimer probably consists of three identical α-chains (COL26A1). However, it remains possible that the trimer may actually be a heterotrimer consisting of different α-chains with identical molecular sizes. The studies to discriminate between these two possibilities are now in progress. HEK-293 cells transfected with type XXVI collagen cDNA release a protein that is ∼60 kDa in reducing SDS-PAGE. This is a slightly higher molecular size than is predicted from the actual amino acid length (438 amino acids). The additional mass appears to come from post-translational modifications of the protein that include glycosylation and hydroxylation of proline residues within the collagenous domain. Pulse-chase experiments revealed that both modifications are required for the secretion of the protein. Furthermore, the N-glycans that are added are further modified to more complex forms in the Golgi apparatus before the protein is secreted. Type XXVI collagen possesses RRRR sequences just before the first collagenous (COL1) region. These sequences are also found in types XIII and XXV collagens and were cleaved by furin convertase (5Hashimoto T. Wakabayashi T. Watanabe A. Kowa H. Hosoda R. Nakamura A. Kanazawa I. Arai T. Takio K. Mann D.M. Iwatsubo T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1524-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 11Snellman A., Tu, H. Vaisanen T. Kvist A.P. Huhtala P. Pihlajaniemi T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5051-5059Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, Western blotting of testis and ovary did not detect a short peptide fragment of type XXVI collagen resulting from cleavage by furin convertase (data not shown). The role this site plays in type XXVI collagen function is thus unclear at present. It also appears that type XXVI collagen is not a FACIT collagen. The FACIT collagens reported to date all have a thrombospondin N terminus-like domain and various numbers of von Willebrand factor-like A-domains (31Tuckwell D. Matrix Biol. 2002; 21: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Type XXVI collagen does not bear such domains. In summary, we have identified a new collagen that interacts with HSP47 and is secreted into the extracellular matrix. It may be important in the adult reproductive organs as well as during the development of these organs. It bears many collagen-like features, including the trimeric form it assumes in its secreted state and its post-translational modifications. It also has some unusual features, including the fact that the disulfide bonds that form the trimer are made in an N-terminal noncollagenous domain. Further studies to investigate the functions of this novel collagen in development and adulthood are currently being conducted.

During the year 2000, over 4800 women died as a result of the disease (1Landis S.H. Murray T. Bolden S. Wingo P.A. CA Cancer J. Clin. 1999; 49: 8-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (3134) Google Scholar). Development of cervical cancer is highly associated with infection by high risk human papillomavirus (HPV)1 types such as HPV-16 or HPV-18, whereas low risk HPV types like HPV-6 are associated with benign genital warts. The high risk HPVs encode two transforming genes,E6 and E7. Both E6 and E7 interfere with key elements in the cell cycle control machinery and as a result, induce cell cycle progression in cells that normally would be quiescent. Whereas E6 mediates the accelerated proteosomal degradation of the p53 tumor suppressor, E7 has been shown to bind to and destabilize the product of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene1 (pRb) and interferes with the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21Cip (2zur Hausen H.

TGF-β inhibits the proliferation of most epithelial and lymphoid cells. This negative regulation of cellular proliferation by TGF-β has been shown to constitute a tumor suppressor pathway (4Kim S.-J., Im, Y.-H. Markowitz S.D. Bang Y.-J. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2000; 11: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The arrest of cell proliferation by TGF-β is associated with increased expression or activity of several cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, including p15Ink4b, p21Waf/Cip, and p27Kip1 (5Laiho M.

The increase in p15Ink4b, p21Waf/Cip, and p27Kip1activity results in a decrease in G1 Cdk activity, which maintains pRb in its hypophosphorylated state (9Ewen M.E. Sluss H.K. Whitehouse L.L. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1993; 74: 1009-102010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Hypophosphorylated pRb sequesters E2F factors needed for progression into S phase of the cell cycle, thereby leading to cell cycle arrest in G1 (5Laiho M. Decaprio J.A. Ludlow J.W. Livingston D.M.

Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Receptor-mediated phosphorylation of these Smads induces their association with the shared partner Smad4, followed by translocation into the nucleus where these complexes activate transcription of specific genes (11Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3358) Google Scholar, 12Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3998) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that the HPV type 16 E7 protein blocks the ability of TGF-β to activate transcription and inhibit cell proliferation. We show that E7 binds to Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4. Furthermore, we demonstrate that E7 blocks the interaction of the Smad complex with the Smad DNA binding element, CAGA, causing inhibition of TGF-β signal transduction. In E7-expressing Mv1Lu cells, we found that the effect of TGF-β on Cdk2 or Cdk4 synthesis is abrogated, and phosphorylation of pRb is increased. From these results, we suggest that the direct inhibition of Smad-mediated TGF-β signaling by E7 may contribute to HPV-associated carcinogenesis. FLAG-tagged Smad3 deletion constructs were generated by polymerase chain reaction using a proofreading polymerase and subcloned pEF-FLAG vector. All polymerase chain reaction-generated products were sequenced using the dideoxynucleotide method. E7 ΔD21–24 plasmid was kindly provided by K.

For cell proliferation assay, E7-expressing cells were plated in 24-well dishes at a density of 5 × 104 cells per well in 0.5 ml of assay medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/0.2% fetal bovine serum). After incubating for 22 h in the presence or absence of TGF-β, cells were pulse-labeled with 0.5 μCi of [3H]thymidine for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were fixed, trypsinized, solubilized, and transferred to scintillation vials to measure radioactivity as described previously (15Kim S.-J. Winokur T.S. Lee H.-D. Danielpour D. Kim K.Y.

After transfection, cells were treated with 5 ng/ml TGF-β1 for 24 h in media. All assays were performed in triplicate and represented as mean (±S.E.) of three independent transfections. HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with the indicated plasmids. After 24 h, cells were switched to 0.2% serum overnight, and induced 5 ng/ml TGF-β1 for 2 h and then whole cell extracts were prepared as described previously (19Haviv I. Shamay M. Doitsh G. Shaul Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1562-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by electrotransfer to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with polyclonal or monoclonal antisera, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit, anti-mouse, anti-goat IgG, respectively, and visualized by chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL). Immunoprecipitation were carried out by incubation with antibody for 1 h. After immunoprecipitates were washed with the buffer containing 100 mm NaCl and 75 mm KCl, Western blots were prepared. For cell cycle signal protein detection, Mv1Lu cells were lysed in the same extraction buffer above after 24-h TGF-β1 treatment (5 ng/ml, twice at 0 and 12 h). Protein concentrations were determined using Bradford method (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Samples of total protein lysate were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The following commercial antibodies were used: for p21, p27, and p15 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and for β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The coding region for Smad2, Smad3, or Smad4 was PCR-amplified and subcloned into the TOPO vector (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA). These plasmids were used as templates for RNA synthesis by T7 RNA polymerase followed by translation in rabbit reticulocyte extracts (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). GST-E7 fusion protein expressed in E. coli was grown and partially purified by adsorption to glutathione-Sepharose beads in the presence of the detergent N-laurylsarcosine (Sarkosyl) and Triton X-100. Samples of each protein (0.5–1.0 μg) bound to Sepharose were preincubated with ethidium bromide (40 μg/ml) for 30 min. Then the samples were shaken for 1 h at room temperature with 5–10 μl of [35S]methionine-labeled in vitro translated Smad proteins. The beads were washed four times in NETN buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and boiled for 3 min in 2× SDS-electrophoresis loading buffer before fractionation on 4–20% Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA). The gels were rinsed in 10% acetic acid, dried, and exposed to x-ray film for autoradiography. HepG2 cells were cultured in the presence or absence of 5 ng/ml TGF-β1 for 2 h. Endogeneous Smad 2/3/4 proteins or E7 protein were detected by incubating with anti-rabbit Smad2/3/4 antibodies (Smad2 and -3, Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA; Smad4, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or E7 (Santa Cruz ED17) mouse monoclonal antibodies at 4 °C for overnight, followed by incubation with goat anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate or TRITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were mounted with medium containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Cells were visualized by use of a fluorescence microscope. DNA binding using biotinylated oligonucleotides was performed as described previously (20Tada K. Inoue H. Ebisawa T. Makuuchi M. Kawabata M. Imamura T. Miyazono K. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 731-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with 5 ng/ml TGF-β1 for 2 h. After pre-clearing with streptavidin-agarose for 1 h, cell lysates were incubated with 30 pmol of biotinylated double-stranded 3xCAGA oligonucleotides and 12 μg of poly(dI-dC) for 1 h. Proteins were precipitated with streptavidin-agarose for 30 min, washed, and detected by immunoblotting. Gel mobility shift assay was performed as described previously (21Park S.H. Lee S.R. Kim B.C.

To prepare the nuclear extracts from Mv1Lu-LXSN and Mv1Lu-E7 cells, cells were incubated in the presence or absence of TGF-β1 for 24 h and lysed and used in a gel shift assay. Briefly, the cells were harvested by scraping, washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated in two packed cell volumes of buffer A (10 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol (DTT), 200 mm sucrose, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1 μg of both leupeptin and aprotinin per milliliter, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) for 5 min at 4 °C. The crude nuclei released by lysis were collected by microcentrifugation (15 s), rinsed once in buffer A, and resuspended in 2/3 packed cell volume of buffer C (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 420 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm PMSF, 1.0 mm DTT, 1.0 μg of both leupeptin and aprotinin per milliliter). Nuclei were incubated on a rocking platform at 4 °C for 30 min and clarified by microcentrifugation for 5 min. The resulting supernatants were diluted 1:1 with buffer D (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 100 mmKCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 1 μg of both leupeptin and aprotinin per milliliter). Nuclear extracts were frozen on dry ice and stored at −80 °C. The extract (30 μg) was incubated with the oligonucleotide probe (20Tada K. Inoue H. Ebisawa T. Makuuchi M. Kawabata M. Imamura T. Miyazono K. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 731-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) labeled with 32P (2 × 105 cpm) in 20 μl of reaction buffer at room temperature for 20 min, and the reaction mixture were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel and run in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA buffer. After electrophoresis the gel was dried and autoradiographed. To examine the effect of E7 on TGF-β-induced transcriptional activation, we co-transfected HepG2 cells with an E7 expression construct along with the TGF-β-responsive 3TP-lux reporter construct or the SBE4-luc reporter construct that contains four SBE (Smad binding element) sites in tandem (17Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). Introduction of E7, but not E6, repressed the TGF-β-dependent activities of these reporter gene constructs (Fig. 1, A andB), suggesting that E7 represses TGF-β-induced transactivation. Specifically, the repression of the SBE4-luc reporter activity by E7 suggests that E7 may directly inhibit the transcriptional activation function of Smad complexes. Smad signaling is thought to mediate the arrest of cell proliferation in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, therefore we examined whether E7 blocks the ability of TGF-β to inhibit G1/S transition and DNA synthesis in stabile, retrovirus-infected Mv11Lu cells. TGF-β inhibited DNA synthesis of control Mv1Lu cells (Mv1Lu-LXSN). However, expression of E7 (Mv1Lu-LXSN-E7) blocked the ability of TGF-β to inhibit DNA synthesis (Fig. 2), in agreement with the observation that E7 expression renders Mv1Lu cells unable to undergo G1 arrest in response to TGF-β (22Satterwhite D.J. Aakre M.E. Gorska A.E. Moses H.L. Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 789-799PubMed Google Scholar). To study how E7 interacts with TGF-β signaling to prevent the growth inhibition by TGF-β, we analyzed the effect of TGF-β on the levels on G1 Cdks (Cdk2 and Cdk4) and cyclin inhibitory proteins (p15, p21, p27), and retinoblastoma protein (pRb) phosphorylation by TGF-β. In TGF-β-treated Mv1Lu cells, pRb is rendered in its underphosphorylated form (5Laiho M. Decaprio J.A. Ludlow J.W. Livingston D.M. Massagué J. Cell. 1990; 62: 175-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). To study whether E7 modulates the effects of TGF-β on pRb phosphorylation, we analyzed by immunoblotting the phosphorylation status of pRb in control and E7-expressing Mv1Lu cells treated with TGF-β. In control Mv1Lu cells treated with TGF-β, the level of pRb was markedly decreased and the majority of pRb was in its faster-migrating, underphosphorylated form, whereas in Mv1Lu-E7 cells the phosphorylated form of pRb (pRbphos) was increased, and, even in the presence of TGF-β, pRb was predominantly in its phosphorylated form (Fig. 2 C). We next examined the effect of E7 on expression of Cdk2, Cdk4, p15, p21, and p27 regulated by TGF-β. Exponentially growing cells were incubated in medium containing TGF-β for 16 h. Analysis of total cellular extracts by immunoblotting with specific antibodies indicated that TGF-β inhibited expression of Cdk2 and Cdk4 in control Mv1Lu cells, but E7 prevented TGF-β-mediated suppression of Cdk2 and Cdk4 expression. In Mv1Lu cells, TGF-β induced expression of p15 and did not affect the level of p27 (Fig. 2 D). E7 prevented TGF-β-mediated induction of p15 as demonstrated previously (23Tsubari M. Taipale J. Tiihonen E. Keski-Oja J. Laiho M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3654-3663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas concordant with previously published result (24Farley J. Gray K. Nycum L. Prentice M. Birrer M.J. Jakowlew S.B. Gynecol. Oncol. 2000; 78: 113-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), the level of p27 was not affected by E7 in Mv1Lu cells (Fig. 2 D). Although p21 has been suggested to mediate TGF-β growth inhibition, its level in Mv1Lu cells were found to be low and were not affected by TGF-β (24 and data not shown).Figure 2E7 blocks the TGF-β growth inhibitory activity. A, thymidine incorporation as a function of varying concentrations of TGF-β1 (expressed as a percentage of the untreated control). E7-expressing Mv1Lu cells and control cells were treated with varying concentrations of TGF-β1 as indicated. After 20 h of TGF-β1 treatment, the Mv1Lu cells were pulsed with [3H]thymidine and harvested 3 h later. All values represent the mean (±S.D.,n = 3). B, E7 protein expression in Mv1Lu cells. C, Western blots for cell cycle proteins in E7-expressing Mv1Lu cells and control cells treated with or without TGF-β1 treatment. The proteins were detected by using anti-pRB, anti-Cdk4, anti-Cdk2, anti-E7, and anti-β-actin antibodies.D, control and E7-expressing Mv1Lu cells were treated with TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml), and cell lysates were prepared, followed by immunoblotting analysis. The proteins were detected by using the anti-p15 and -p27 antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because E7 interferes with Smad-mediated transactivation, we examined whether Smad2, Smad3, or Smad4 physically interacts with E7 in vivo. Interaction of Smads with E7 was tested by co-immunoprecipitation of Smad2, Smad3, or Smad4 and E7 from HepG2 cells transfected with an E7 expression construct and FLAG/Myc-tagged Smad expression constructs. Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 each were detected in anti-E7 immunoprecipitates by protein immunoblotting with antibody to FLAG-tag for Smad2 and Smad3 and Myc-tag for Smad4 (Fig. 3,A–C). We found that E7 interacts with Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 in a ligand-independent manner in vivo. The interaction between these Smad proteins and E7 was also studied by GST pull-down assays in vitro using 35S-labeled Smad2, -3, and -4 proteins. E7 interacted with 35S-labeled Smad2, -3, or -4 (Fig. 3 D). These results demonstrated E7 binds to Smad2, -3, or -4 directly. To see whether phosphorylated Smad proteins are associated with E7, we transfected E7 and Myc-Smad3 constructs into HepG2 cells and cells were incubated with TGF-β. Interaction of phosphorylated Smad3 with E7 was tested by co-immunoprecipitation of Smad3 and E7, followed by the immunoblotting with anti-phospho Smad3 antibody. As shown in Fig.4, E7 interacts with both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of Smad3.Figure 4E7 interacts with both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated Smad3. HepG2 cells were transfected with E7 and Myc-tagged Smad3 constructs. Cells were treated with TGF-β1 for 2 h. Cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation using an anti-E7 antibody and Gamma-bind beads (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden), followed by immunoblotting with anti-myc or anti-phospho-Smad3 antibody. The expression of E7 and Smad3 was monitored as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the extent to which E7 might co-localize with Smadsin vivo, we performed confocal microscopic analysis using anti-E7, anti-Smad2, anti-Smad3, and anti-Smad4 antibodies in HepG2 cells. E7 exhibited a characteristic distribution that was nearly uniform in the nucleus (Fig. 5,A–C). Staining for endogenous Smad proteins in E7-expressing cells revealed extensive co-localization of Smads with E7 in the nucleus, indicated by the yellow color on the overlapping panels. In the absence of TGF-β1 treatment, most endogenous Smad3 is localized in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5 B). However, regardless of TGF-β1 treatment, Smad3 was predominantly localized in the nucleus when Smad3 and E7 were co-transfected in HepG2 cells, and confocal microscopy revealed extensive co-localization of Smad3 with E7 (Fig. 5, B and D). Smad2 and Smad4 were also sequestered in the nucleus when co-transfected with E7, regardless of TGF-β1 treatment (Fig. 5 D). These results suggest that E7 may facilitate the nuclear translocation of Smad proteins in a ligand-independent manner. To test whether the interaction of E7 with Smads might inhibit the ability of Smads to bind DNA, a DNA-affinity precipitation assay with biotinylated oligonucleotides containing the Smad-binding element (CAGA box) (20Tada K. Inoue H. Ebisawa T. Makuuchi M. Kawabata M. Imamura T. Miyazono K. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 731-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) was performed. Using nuclear extracts isolated from E7-expressing Mv1Lu cells (Mv1Lu-LXSN-E7) and control cells (Mv1Lu-LXSN), with or without TGF-β1 treatment, we isolated active Smad3 using biotinylated DNA containing TGF-β-responsive CAGA sequence. The amount of Smad3 bound to the CAGA sequence was markedly increased in nuclear extracts from control cells after treatment with TGF-β1 (Fig. 6 A). However, the amount of Smad3 bound to the CAGA sequence was markedly reduced in nuclear extracts from Mv1Lu cells expressing E7, even after TGF-β1 treatment (Fig. 6 A). To examine whether E7 inhibits the formation of the Smad-containing complex, we also performed a gel shift assay using an oligonucleotide encompassing a TGF-β-responsive element in the PAI-1 promoter (−586 ∼ −551). Nuclear extracts were prepared from the control and E7-expressing Mv1Lu cells after TGF-β1 treatment. TGF-β1 treatment markedly increased the formation of Smad-containing complex in control Mv1Lu cells, whereas expression of E7 in Mv1Lu-E7 cells prevented the formation of the Smad-containing complex (Fig. 6 B). These data strongly indicate a direct inhibitory role of E7 on the formation of Smad-containing complex. To examine the mechanism by which E7 inhibits binding of Smad3 to CAGA, we determined the effect of a transformation deficient mutant, E7 ΔD21–24 (13Gonzalez S.L. Stremlau M., He, X. Basile J.R. Münger K. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7583-7591Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 25Duensing S. Lee L.Y. Duensing A. Basile J. Piboonniyom S. Gonzalez S. Crum C.P. Münger K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10002-10007Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). This mutant E7 protein has lost the ability to induce abnormal centrosome duplication (14Satterwhite D.J. White R.L. Matsunami N. Neufeld K.L. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6989-6994PubMed Google Scholar). In luciferase assays using either the TGF-β-responsive 3TP lux reporter construct or p800-Luc, a fragment of the PAI-1 promoter (18Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.-M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1588) Google Scholar), E7 ΔD21–24 failed to repress TGF-β1-induced transcriptional activation (Fig.7, A and B). We next examined whether E7 ΔD21–24 differs from E7 in its ability to interact with Smad3. By co-immunoprecipitation with Smad3 we found that, unlike the wild-type E7, the E7 ΔD21–24 mutant failed to interact with Smad3 (Fig. 8 A). To test whether the E7 ΔD21–24 mutant would also lack the ability to block the binding of Smad3 to its DNA binding site, we performed the CAGA binding assay using nuclear extracts isolated from the HepG2 cells transiently transfected with either wild-type E7 expression construct or E7 ΔD21–24 expression construct. As shown in Fig. 8 B, TGF-β1 treatment enhanced Smad3 binding to CAGA element in control HepG2 cells (lane 2 of upper panel). In HepG2 cells expressing wild-type E7, virtually no Smad3 was bound to the CAGA element (lanes 3 and 4). In contrast, Smad3 retained the ability to bind to the CAGA element in nuclear extracts isolated from the HepG2 cells transfected with the E7 ΔD21–24 mutant (lane 5). These results suggest that the region of E7 between residues 21 and 24 is required for interaction of E7 with Smad3, as well as for E7 to repress TGF-β-mediated transcription.Figure 8E7 mutant ΔD21–24 does not bind to Smad3 and fail to inhibit binding of the Smad3 to its binding site, CAGA. A, E7 mutant ΔD21–24 binding to Smad3 is very weak compared with wild type. FLAG-tagged Smad3 proteins were co-transfected into HepG2 cells together with E7 and E7 mutant ΔD21–24 isolated by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody. The Smad3-bound E7 was detected by protein immunoblotting with an anti-E7 antibody (top). Cell lysates were blotted with anti-FLAG to confirm expression of FLAG-Smad3 (middle). The expression of E7 protein and E7 mutant ΔD21–24 in the lysates was detected using anti-E7 antibody (bottom). B, HepG2 cells were transfected with Smad3 and E7 wild type or E7ΔD21–24 mutant. After transfection, cells were stimulated with 5 ng/ml TGF-β1 for 2 h, and Smad3 binding to CAGA biotinylated DNA was checked.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because E7 inhibits Smad3 binding to its target DNA sequence, we wondered whether E7 interacts with the DNA binding domain of Smad3 protein. To determine the domain of Smad3 responsible for interaction with E7 in vivo, we performed immunoprecipitation assays using various FLAG-tagged Smad3 expression constructs along with a wild-type E7 construct. E7 was found to co-immunoprecipitate with full-length Smad3, as well as with the N-terminal MH1 domain. E7 did not immunoprecipitate with the C-terminal MH2 domain or middle linker domains of Smad3 (Fig.9), demonstrating that the MH1 domain of Smad3 contains the E7 interaction domain. We next examined whether E7 inhibits the complex formation between Smad3 and Smad4. After transfection of Smad3 and Smad4 constructs with or without E7 into HepG2 cells, we examined whether E7 blocks the complex formation between Smad3 and Smad4 by examining the level of Smad4 bound Smad3. TGF-β treatment induced interaction between Smad4 and Smad3 (Fig. 10, lane 3), whereas E7 expression almost completely blocked interaction between Smad3 and Smad4 (Fig. 10, lane 5). TGF-β is an extracellular signaling molecule that activates a tumor suppressor pathway (4Kim S.-J., Im, Y.-H. Markowitz S.D. Bang Y.-J. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2000; 11: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The ability of TGF-β signaling to suppress tumor formation is linked to its ability to reversibly arrest cell proliferation in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (5Laiho M. Decaprio J.A. Ludlow J.W. Livingston D.M. Massagué J. Cell. 1990; 62: 175-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar,26Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1017-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 27Howe P.H. Draetta G. Leof E.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1185-1194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Pietenpol J.A. Stein R.W. Moran E. Yaciuk P. Schlegel R. Lyons R.M. Pittelkow M.R. Munger K. Howley P.M. Moses H.L. Cell. 1990; 61: 777-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). As cells transform into cancer, they commonly lose the ability to arrest cell cycle progression in response to TGF-β. Interestingly, many of the changes in gene expression that are associated with transformation of normal cells into cancer also appear to block the ability of TGF-β to arrest cell cycle progression (29Massagué J. Chen Y.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 627-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Blobe G.C. Schiemann W.P. Lodish H.F. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 342: 1350-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (2195) Google Scholar). Thus, many lines of evidence indicate that the functions of TGF-β depend on the ability of TGF-β signaling to inactivate proto-oncogenes and activate tumor suppressor genes. Using an alternative approach, studies revealing the evolutionarily conserved functions of the DNA tumor-inducing viruses have similarly led to the discovery and characterization of many key cellular proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. For example, adenovirus and the human papilloma virus structurally encode very divergent oncoproteins, yet the oncoproteins encoded by these two viruses have many functions in common that have survived thousands of years of evolutionary pressure. Cells transformed by stable transfection of DNA tumor virus oncoproteins, including adenovirus E1A and HPV-16 E7 were found to be insensitive to TGF-β-induced c-myc repression and growth inhibition (28Pietenpol J.A. Stein R.W. Moran E. Yaciuk P. Schlegel R. Lyons R.M. Pittelkow M.R. Munger K. Howley P.M. Moses H.L. Cell. 1990; 61: 777-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Because pRb binding mutants of these oncoproteins did not block TGF-β repression of myc/CAT expression, it was suggested that pRb is a key cellular factor involved in a pathway mediating TGF-β1 inhibitory effects on keratinocytes, and that inactivation of pRb might account for the loss of TGF-β responsiveness. Recently, it was shown that TGF-β1 inhibits topoisomerase IIα (topo IIα) expression in Mv1Lu cells, however, expression of HPV-16 E7 effectively blocked the ability of TGF-β1 to both arrest growth and inhibit topo IIα expression (14Satterwhite D.J. White R.L. Matsunami N. Neufeld K.L. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6989-6994PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the ability of TGF-β1 to inhibit BRAC1 expression was abolished by expression of HPV-16 E7 in Mv1Lu cells (31Satterwhite D.J. Matsunami N. White R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 686-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The authors suggested that resistance to TGF-β1-induced inhibition of topo IIα and BRAC1 expression by HBV 16 E7 might be mediated primarily through the inactivation of pRb, however, the effects of E7 on the Smads that mediate TGF-β1 signaling were not directly investigated (14Satterwhite D.J. White R.L. Matsunami N. Neufeld K.L. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6989-6994PubMed Google Scholar). Smad proteins play a key role in the intracellular signaling of TGF-β. Upon TGF-β receptor activation, Smad2 and Smad3 become phosphorylated and form heteromeric complexes with Smad4. These complexes translocate to the nucleus where they control expression of target genes. In the present study, we have shown that E7 blocks TGF-β signaling by blocking binding of the Smad complex to its target DNA sequence. E7 binds to Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4, and blocks binding of Smad3 to its DNA binding site, CAGA (Fig. 5). The pRb binding-deficient HPV-16 E7 mutant E7 ΔD21-C24 showed a greatly diminished ability to bind to Smad3 compared with the wild-type E7 protein, and E7 ΔD21-C24 failed to inhibit TGF-β1-induced transcription activity (Fig. 7 B). These results suggest that interaction between E7 and Smad is required for the inhibition of TGF-β signal transduction. Using confocal microscopy, we have shown that E7 sequesters Smad proteins in the nucleus, even in the absence of TGF-β signaling. Because of the importance of the data reported here, additional studies are underway to determine whether the Smad proteins that are associated with E7 in the nucleus are phosphorylated and whether the Smad proteins associate with E7 as part of a higher order complex. Direct DNA-binding activity of Smad complexes has been shown to be mediated by N-terminal Smad domain (MH1) (32Feng X.H. Zhang Y., Wu, R.Y. Derynck R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Because our study shows that the N-terminal Mad homology 1 (MH1) region of Smad3 is required for the interaction between E7 and Smad3, it is likely that E7 blocks the interaction of Smad3 with its target sequence by binding to the MH1 domain of Smad3. TGF-β is known to down-regulate the synthesis of Cdk4 and to inhibit the activity of cyclin E-Cdk2 in a pathway leading to a G1 arrest. Cdk4 and Cdk2 have been implicated as the G1 kinases responsible for phosphorylating and inactivating pRb in mid to late G1. TGF-β causes the accumulation of unphosphorylated pRb in responsive cells through the suppression of Cdk4 synthesis and Cdk2 activity (9Ewen M.E. Sluss H.K. Whitehouse L.L. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1993; 74: 1009-102010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 24Farley J. Gray K. Nycum L. Prentice M. Birrer M.J. Jakowlew S.B. Gynecol. Oncol. 2000; 78: 113-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In Mv1Lu cells expressing HPV 16 E7, TGF-β was unable to down-regulate the expression of Cdk4 and Cdk2, whereas a hyperphosphorylated form of pRb was increased even in the presence of TGF-β. 2D. K. Lee, B.-C. Kim, I. Y. Kim, E.-a. Cho, D. J. Satterwhite, and S.-J. Kim, unpublished results. Our results suggest that suppression of Smad activity by E7 may also contribute to the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated form of pRb. Although the pathogenesis of cervical cancer is still not fully understood, substantial evidence indicates that the papillomavirus E7 protein is involved in the proliferation and transformation of normal human cervical cells (33Pei X.F. Sherman L. Sun Y.H. Schlegel R. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 1481-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 34Demers G.W. Halbert C.L. Galloway D.A. Virology. 1994; 198: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The E7 protein is the major oncogenic protein produced by cervical cancer-associated human papillomaviruses (35Enzenauer C. Mengus G. Lavigne A. Davidson I. Pfister H. May M. Intervirology. 1998; 41: 80-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Our study is the first to demonstrate that HPV-positive cells develop resistance to the antiproliferative effects of TGF-β in part through the inhibition of Smad DNA binding activity by E7 oncoprotein. Thus, the ability to bind and inactivate Smad proteins appears to be a key function shared by the adenovirus E1A and HPV-16 E7 oncoproteins, which has been retained through thousands of years of evolution (32Feng X.H. Zhang Y., Wu, R.Y. Derynck R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar,36Nishihara A. Hanai J. Imamura T. Miyazono K. Kawabata M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28716-28723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that inactivation of Smad-mediated signaling is necessary to block the tumor suppressor functions of TGF-β and that inactivation of pRb and p53 must be tightly coupled with the targeted inactivation of Smads for efficient transformation. By inactivating each of the most important brakes on their proliferation, HPV-infected cells can then multiply at high rates and show highly elevated TGF-β ligand and receptor expression (24Farley J. Gray K. Nycum L. Prentice M. Birrer M.J. Jakowlew S.B. Gynecol. Oncol. 2000; 78: 113-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This considerable inhibition of TGF-β signaling by E7 thus provides a uniquely favorable environment for the development of cervical cancer.

Chem. 1997; 272: 110-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), key features of OC promoter regulation are remarkably well conserved across mammalian species (3Ducy P. Schinke T. Karsenty G. Science. 2000; 289: 1501-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). The osteoblast homeoprotein Msx2 plays a crucial role in the regulation of osteoblast proliferation and differentiation (15Satokata I., Ma, L. Ohshima H. Bei M. Woo I. Nishizawa K. Maeda T. Takano Y. Uchiyama M. Heaney S. Peters H. Tang Z. Maxson R. Maas R. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Msx2and Msx1 are absolutely required for craniofacial bone formation (15Satokata I., Ma, L. Ohshima H. Bei M. Woo I. Nishizawa K. Maeda T. Takano Y. Uchiyama M. Heaney S. Peters H. Tang Z. Maxson R. Maas R. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Msx2 controls the timing of osteoblast differentiation, including the temporospatial patterns of OC expression in the calvarium and teeth (12Newberry E.P. Latifi T. Towler D.A.

Msx2 plays a global role in determination of skeletal mass, elegantly demonstrated in murine genetic models; moreover, as highlighted by Maas and colleagues (15Satokata I., Ma, L. Ohshima H. Bei M.

Consistent with this, we (11Newberry E.P. Latifi T. Towler D.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10678-10690Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 12Newberry E.P. Latifi T. Towler D.A.

In the rat OC gene, transcriptional regulation by Msx2 converges on a 42-bp region at nucleotides −154 to −113 relative to the transcription initiation site, encompassing an FGF responsive element at nucleotides −142 to −136 (17Newberry E.P. Boudreaux J.M. Towler D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29607-29613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The OCFRE (OC FGF response element) is a GCAGTCA motif that confers both basal and FGF2-regulated expression of the OC gene in MC3T3E1 calvarial osteoblasts (17Newberry E.P. Boudreaux J.M.

Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1029-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A DNA binding activity up-regulated by FGF2 in MC3T3E1 cells recognizes this element and is constitutively expressed by MG63 osteosarcoma cells (17Newberry E.P. Boudreaux J.M. Towler D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29607-29613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 20Boudreaux J.M. Towler D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7508-7515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Msx2 exerts suppressive actions on the OC promoter in part by inhibiting the OCFRE DNA binding activity present in either MC3T3E1 cells or purified from MG63 cells (17Newberry E.P. Boudreaux J.M. Towler D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29607-29613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). By contrast, Msx2 does not alter vitamin D receptor-dependent transcription or vitamin D receptor binding to its DNA cognate (17Newberry E.P. Boudreaux J.M. Towler D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29607-29613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Inhibition of OCFRE activity is dependent upon key regulatory domains encoded in the Msx2 homeodomain NH2-terminal arm and extension (17Newberry E.P. Boudreaux J.M. Towler D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29607-29613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Stein and co-workers (22Banerjee C. Stein J.L. Van Wijnen A.J. Frenkel B. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1991-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 23McCabe L.R. Banerjee C. Kundu R. Harrison R.J. Dobner P.R. Stein J.L. Lian J.B. Stein G.S.

They identified that an AP1 complex mediates transforming growth factor-β repression in ROS17/2.8 cells. We have confirmed these observations, 2D. M. Willis, A. P. Loewy, N. Charlton-Kachigian, J-S. Shao, D. M. Ornitz, and Dwight A. Towler, unpublished data. however, applying immunological and competition studies, we determined that the Msx2-regulated DNA binding activity was not an AP1 family member (20Boudreaux J.M. Towler D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7508-7515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) (see below). Thus, the OCFRE mediates both positive and negative regulation of OC gene transcription in osteoblasts. To fully characterize the DNA binding activities that recognize and regulate the OCFRE, we have purified the major homeoprotein-regulated OCFRE complex about 25,000-fold from MG63 human osteosarcoma cells, using DNA binding in gel shift as an assay.

Chem. 1997; 272: 29607-29613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) in the purified OCFRE binding complex by nanobore LC-MS/MS “sequencing” of tryptic peptides (27Link A.J. Eng J. Schieltz D.M. Carmack E. Mize G.J. Morris D.R. Garvik B.M. Yates III, J.R. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 676-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (2074) Google Scholar). Additionally, we identify a novel 100-kDa variant of Tubedown-1, hence, named Tbdn100, as a constituent of this complex purified from this osteoblastic cell line. Tubedown is anN-acetyltransferase initially identified in immature endothelial cells (28Gendron R.L. Adams L.C. Paradis H. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 300-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar); however, Northern blot analyses verify the expression of Tbdn in MC3T3E1 calvarial osteoblasts, a useful and relevant cell background for osteoblast gene expression studies, and in many other tissues. Western blot analyses with antibodies raised to the COOH-terminal domain of Tbdn100 confirm the accumulation of the 100-kDa Tbdn100 variant in nuclear fractions prepared from MC3T3E1 osteoblasts. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays confirm the association of Ku and Tbdn100 with endogenous OC promoter, but not with the BSP promoter. Immunological supershift and competition studies confirm sequence-specific association of Ku in the nuclear complex assembled by the OCFRE. In transient transfection assays, co-expression of the novel Ku complex constituents (Ku70, Ku80, and Tbdn100) up-regulates basal OC promoter activity and OCFRE-dependent transcription; by contrast, theRSV promoter is not regulated. In the 42-bp promoter region −154 to −113, the OCFRE (20Boudreaux J.M. Towler D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7508-7515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) is juxtaposed to OSE2 (29Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar), an element that binds the osteoblast transactivator Runx2 (also known as Osf2 and Cbfa1) (3Ducy P. Schinke T. Karsenty G. Science. 2000; 289: 1501-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar, 9Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3647) Google Scholar). Runx2 and Ku:Tbdn100 synergistically activate transcription driven by the OC promoter region −154 to −113 when placed upstream of the unresponsive RSVpromoter. Synergistic activation of OC-(−154/−113)-RSVLUC is markedly augmented by FGFR2-ROS, a constitutively active FGF receptor (30Lorenzi M.V. Horii Y. Yamanaka R. Sakaguchi K. Miki T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8956-8961Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 31Newberry E.P. Willis D. Latifi T. Boudreaux J.M. Towler D.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1129-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Importantly, Msx2 suppresses Ku- and Runx2-dependent transcription, consistent with our prior studies demonstrating that OCFRE binding is inhibited by Msx2 (17Newberry E.P. Boudreaux J.M. Towler D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29607-29613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Pull-down assays confirm physical interactions between Ku and Msx2, and Ku and Runx2. Finally, we show that calvarial cells lacking Ku70 exhibit profound, selective deficiencies in OC, but not OPN, gene expression.In toto, these data indicate that a novel Ku antigen complex assembles on the OC promoter, functioning in concert with Msx2 and Runx2 to regulate OC gene expression. Tbdn100 emerges as a nuclear transcriptional regulator that associates with theOC gene and promotes transactivation responses. Tissue culture supplies and custom synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides were obtained from Invitrogen. Reagents for protein purification were obtained from Pierce, Sigma, and Fisher. Radionuclides were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. MG63 cells (ATCC number CRL-1427, Manassas, VA) were grown at the Washington University Tissue Culture and Media Center in α-modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 5% newborn calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Pilot purification revealed that more that half of the OCFRE-binding complex was present in the insoluble nuclear matrix, released by timed digestion with DNase I or fracture of nuclear matrix by vortexing with glass beads. Therefore, cell extracts were made using a modification of a glass bead lysis protocol previously described (32Towler D.A. Adams S.P. Eubanks S.R. Towery D.S. Jackson-Machelski E. Glaser L. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2708-2712Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), with all steps carried out at 4 °C. Briefly, the washed cell pellet (from 2 × 1010 MG63 cells grown in roller bottles) was resuspended in 5 volumes of extraction buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.45 m NaCl, 25% (v/v) glycerin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm vanadate, 0.1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 6 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A). After addition of prewashed glass beads (400–600 μm; Sigma), the cell extract was prepared by homogenization using the BioSpec Bead Beater (Bartlesville, OK). After centrifugation at 7500 rpm for 15 min to clear the extract, ammonium sulfate fractionation and protein purification chromatography were carried out using standard techniques (32Towler D.A. Adams S.P. Eubanks S.R. Towery D.S. Jackson-Machelski E. Glaser L. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2708-2712Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) as summarized in the legend to Fig. 1. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was used detect binding to the radiolabeled OCFRE as previously detailed (20Boudreaux J.M. Towler D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7508-7515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar); the upper strand sequence of the radiolabeled duplex oligo used to follow OCFRE binding activity is 5′-GGCAGCTGCAGTCACCGGCCC-3′ (the OC promoter sequence encompassing the OCFRE is underlined). Total protein recovery was determined by the Pierce bicinchoninic acid assay after protein precipitation and resolubilization as described (33Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7134) Google Scholar). High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was carried out using a Waters (Milford, MA) AGC gradient controller with two model 515 pumps, fitted with a preparative scale 10-ml Rheodyne injector (Rohnert Park, CA) and low protein retention polyetheretherketone (PEEK) tubing. A Waters model 468 tunable ultraviolet detector set at 280 nm was used to follow protein elution. A 5-ml Amersham Bioscience Mono Q FPLC column (20 mm Tris buffered, pH 8.0) was used for anion exchange, and an Amersham Bioscience disposable 1-ml HiTrap heparin-Sepharose affinity column (20 mm Hepes buffered, pH 7.9) were used for final purification steps. For both HPLC applications, 1 ml/min flow rates with a 14 mm/min NaCl gradient were used to elute OCFRE binding activity; 0.1 mm EDTA and 1 mm2-mercaptoethanol were included in all HPLC buffers. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE using an 11% 0.75-mm thick polyacrylamide gel poured on methanol-cleaned virgin glass plates (Mini-Protean II; Bio-Rad) and pre-run to clear oxyradicals. After electrophoresis, fractionated proteins were visualized by staining in Coomassie Brilliant Blue, briefly destained, and excised with a scalpel, reduced and alkylated with dithiothreitol and iodoacetamide, respectively, rinsed with 50% acetonitrile in deionized water with 0.1% acetic acid to remove SDS, and speed evaporated dry. After pre-swelling gel fragments in 50 mm NaHCO3, proteins were digested with 1:20 (mass/mass) of acetylated trypsin (Promega), and tryptic peptides were analyzed by nanobore LC-MS/MS at the Harvard Microchemistry Facility (B. Lane, director) using a Finnigan ion trap mass spectrometer (34Rowley A. Choudhary J.S. Marzioch M. Ward M.A. Weir M. Solari R.C. Blackstock W.P.

Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 676-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (2074) Google Scholar) of the NCBI cDNA data base identified Ku70 (24 unique peptides) and Ku80 (17 unique peptides). Analysis of the translated EST data base in all 6 reading frames was required to identify peptides from the unknown 100-kDa subunit (8 unique peptides initially identified; 24 identified in final analysis, Fig. 3).Figure 3The cDNA sequence and predicted protein sequence of human Tbdn100. 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA end reactions were carried out with human heart cDNA to obtain the sequence used to clone human Tbdn100 by PCR as described in the text. The GenBankTM accession number for human Tbdn100 is AY112670. The nuclear localization consensus at residues 612–628 is in bold italics. The 23 unique peptides identified by micro LC-MS/MS from Tbdn100 purified from human MG63 osteosarcoma cells are underlined. Affinity purified antipeptide antibodies were generated against the COOH-terminal 15 amino acids of Tbdn. Seven tetratricopeptide repeat motifs are encoded by residues 46–79, 80–113, 114–147, 148–181, 224–257, 374–407, and 408–441.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because there were no matches for our uLC-MS/MS tryptic peptide data in the nonredundant cDNA data base for the 100-kDa protein, we searched the translated NCBI EST data base with BLAST (35Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59929) Google Scholar). We identified several ESTs which assembled into a 900-base pair contig containing a putative stop codon and providing a contiguous open reading frame encoding 8 of the unique tryptic peptides we identified from mass spectroscopy analysis of the purified 100-kDa subunit. EST analyses revealed expression in the heart (and subsequently confirmed by Northern blot); therefore, the 900-bp fragment was amplified from commercially available human heart cDNA (Clontech Marathon Ready cDNA; Clontech) and sequenced to verify correct assembly. By applying successive rounds of 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends from this Marathon Ready cDNA and iterative EST data base searches, we assembled the complete sequences of both the mouse and human cDNAs (Fig. 3). After obtaining the complete sequence, reanalysis of our raw LC-MS/MS data identified a total of 24 peptides, including one at our predicted translation start site without Met (Fig.3). During our studies, a variant of this 100-kDa protein was cloned by Gendron and colleagues (28Gendron R.L. Adams L.C. Paradis H. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 300-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and named Tubedown-1. Because our protein is 100 kDa in mass because of an additional 272 amino acids at the amino terminus, we named our variant Tubedown-100 or Tbdn100 (Fig. 3; GenBankTM number AY112670). Sequence analysis was performed using ProfileScan software accessible from the ISREC Bioinformatics home page (Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research; www.isrec.isb-sib.ch/index.html), Pfam Hidden Markov Models software (36Bateman A. Birney E. Durbin R. Eddy S.R. Howe K.L. Sonnhammer E.L.

Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1029-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar)); however, 1 nm okadaic acid and 10 nm sodium orthovanadate were added to inhibit phosphoprotein phosphatases during extraction. The radiolabeled OCFRE duplex oligo (see above) was used to detect DNA-protein interactions. Gel supershifts and competition experiments were carried out as previously detailed (20Boudreaux J.M.

Anti-Tbdn100 antibodies were commercially prepared (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) using a conjugated synthetic peptide corresponding to the COOH-terminal 14 amino acids of Tbdn100 as the immunogen; monospecific polyclonal antibodies were prepared from immune serum using purified, recombinant Tbdn100 (expressed in pET23d; Novagen) conjugated to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose; these techniques have been previously detailed (11Newberry E.P. Latifi T. Towler D.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10678-10690Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Western blot analyses were carried out on crude or fractionated cellular extracts essentially as previously detailed (11Newberry E.P. Latifi T. Towler D.A.

Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (4% stacking gel, 11% resolving gel), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and blocked with 0.2% I-Block (Tropix, Bedford, MA) in Tris-buffered saline. The membranes were then probed with polyclonal antibodies at 1:250 to 1:1000 dilutions. The bands were visualized using chemiluminescent detection as previously described (18Newberry E.P. Latifi T.

ChIP assays (see Ref. 38Johnson K.D. Bresnick E.H.

Data were expressed as the mean ± S.D. enrichment by immunoprecipitation from quadruplicate evaluations. Twenty nanograms of processed DNA was used in each PCR reaction, and signal arising from 1 pg of genomic DNA was used as a reference."
https://openalex.org/W2014824156,"Engagement of the high affinity receptor for IgE (FcεRI) on mast cells and basophils results in FcεRI β and γ subunits ubiquitination by an as yet undefined mechanism. Here we show that, upon FcεRI engagement on RBL-2H3 cells Syk undergoes ubiquitination and Syk kinase activity is required for its own ubiquitination and that of FcεRI β and γ chains. This requirement was demonstrated by overexpression of Syk wild-type or its kinase-dead mutant in RBL cells or using an Syk-deficient RBL-derived cell line transfected with wild-type or a kinase inactive form of Syk. We also identify c-Cbl as the E3 ligase responsible for both Syk and receptor ubiquitination. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Syk controls tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk-associated Cbl induced after receptor engagement. These data suggest a mutual regulation between Syk and Cbl activities. Finally, we show that a selective inhibitor of proteasome degradation induces persistence of tyrosine-phosphorylated receptor complexes, of activated Syk, and of FcεRI-triggered degranulation. Our results provide a molecular mechanism for down-regulation of engaged receptor complexes by targeting ubiquitinated FcεRI and activated Syk to the proteasome for degradation.

This requirement was demonstrated by overexpression of Syk wild-type or its kinase-dead mutant in RBL cells or using an Syk-deficient RBL-derived cell line transfected with wild-type or a kinase inactive form of Syk. We also identify c-Cbl as the E3 ligase responsible for both Syk and receptor ubiquitination. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Syk controls tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk-associated Cbl induced after receptor engagement. These data suggest a mutual regulation between Syk and Cbl activities. Finally, we show that a selective inhibitor of proteasome degradation induces persistence of tyrosine-phosphorylated receptor complexes, of activated Syk, and of FcεRI-triggered degranulation. Our results provide a molecular mechanism for down-regulation of engaged receptor complexes by targeting ubiquitinated FcεRI and activated Syk to the proteasome for degradation. protein-tyrosine kinase T cell antigen receptor B cell antigen receptor high affinity immunoglobulin E receptor low affinity immunoglobulin G receptor immune receptor ubiquitin goat anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2 fragment phosphotyrosine immune receptor tyrosine-based activation motif Src homology 2 ubiquitin carrier protein ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase monoclonal antibody antigen hemagglutinin dinitrophenyl Earle's modified Eagle's medium human serum albumin The activation of protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs)1 is an essential event in the transduction of intracellular signals from immune receptors (IR), including the T and B cell antigen receptors (TCR and BCR, respectively), the high affinity receptor for IgE (FcεRI), and the widely distributed receptors for IgG. These IRs contain multiple subunits: some, distinct for each receptor, are used for ligand binding, whereas others share conserved cytoplasmic motifs that are critical for the process of cell activation (immune receptor tyrosine-based activation motif, ITAM) (1Reth M.

ITAM phosphorylation by the Src family PTKs provides docking sites for the tandem pair of Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of a second class of PTKs belonging to the Syk family (3Samelson L.E.

This family includes only two members: Syk, which is present in most hematopoietic cells and ZAP-70, which is exclusively expressed in T and NK cells. As documented by several studies, the expression of Syk and ZAP-70 is essential for lymphocyte development and signal transduction via IRs (13Chun D.H. Morita C.I. Weiss A. Immunol.

The association of phosphorylated ITAMs with SH2 domains of Syk family PTKs leads to the activation of Syk and ZAP-70 mainly by autophosphorylation (17El-Hillal O. Kurosaki T. Yamamura H. Kinet J.-K. Scharenberg A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1919-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), thus allowing the propagation of IR signaling. We and others have demonstrated that Syk and ZAP-70 as well as IR subunits are subjected to an additional covalent modification following IR engagement in that they become modified by ubiquitin (Ub) (18Cenciarelli C.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7085-7095Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have also provided evidence suggesting a direct correlation between IR-induced Syk and ZAP-70 ubiquitination and degradation (21Paolini R. Molfetta R. Piccoli M. Frati L. Santoni A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9611-9616Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination, which consists in the covalent modification of a protein by Ub or Ub chains, involves several types of enzymes (23Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6959) Google Scholar, 24Laney J.D. Hochstrasser M.

The ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligases (E3s) provide specificity to the Ub system: they are responsible for substrate recognition and for promoting Ub ligation to the target protein. A recently identified class of E3 ligases is characterized by the presence of a RING finger domain that serves as the binding site for specific E2 Ub carrier proteins (26Joazeiro C.A.P. Weissman A.M. Cell. 2000; 102: 549-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). The protooncogene c-Cbl belongs to this class of E3 ubiquitin ligases: it can recognize specific substrates due to the presence of multiple protein recognition domains, and recruits a specific E2 enzyme via its RING finger domain (27Joazeiro C.A.P.

Thus, Cbl can associate with and negatively regulate a number of receptor and non-receptor PTKs targeting them for ubiquitination and degradation (22Rao N. Ghosh A.K. Ota S. Zhou P. Reddi A.L.

Fang D. Dai Y. Shao Y. Liu Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26004-26011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism responsible for activating Cbl ligase activity after IR engagement is largely unknown. Thus, the aim of our study was to investigate the molecular mechanism regulating the Cbl-dependent ubiquitination of Syk family PTKs and receptor subunits induced after IR engagement. As an in vivo system we choose a rat basophilic leukemia cell line (RBL-2H3) that constitutively expresses the high affinity receptor for IgE (FcεRI). This is a tetrameric complex composed of a ligand-binding α chain, a β chain, and a homodimer of γ chains (36Ravetch J.V. Kinet J.-P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 457-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar). The β chain plays an essential role in setting the level of cellular response to IgE and antigen, through its capacity to amplify both cell surface FcεRI expression (37Donnadieu E. Jouvin M.-H. Kinet J.-P. Immunity. 2000; 12: 515-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and signaling (38Lin S. Cicala C. Scharenberg A.M. Kinet J.-P. Cell. 1996; 85: 985-995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The FcεRI γ chain is also part of other IRs (39Orloff D.G., Ra, C. Frank S.J. Klausner R.D. Kinet J.-P.

Cell. 1993; 73: 209-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). FcεRI engagement leads to the immediate tyrosine phosphorylation of β and γ subunits through the tyrosine kinase of the Src family, Lyn, allowing Syk binding to the phosphorylated ITAM-containing subunits. The consequent activation of Syk is essential for all known FcεRI-mediated responses, including secretion of allergic mediators and induction of cytokine gene transcription (42Beaven M.A. Metzger H.

In the present study we demonstrate that Syk kinase activity is an indispensable requisite for Cbl-dependent ubiquitination of both FcεRI and Syk induced after IR engagement. All chemical and drugs, unless otherwise mentioned, were obtained from Sigma (Sigma-Aldrich, Italy). Anti-FcεRI α subunit Ab (BC4) has been previously described (46Basciano L.K. Berenstein E.H.

Goat anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2 fragment (GAM) was purchased from Cappel Laboratories (ICN Biomedicals, Opera, Milan, Italy). Anti-phosphotyrosine (anti-PY) 4G10 mAb and anti-FcεRI γ chain polyclonal Ab were purchased from UBI (Lake Placid, NY); rabbit polyclonal anti-Syk (N-19), anti-Cbl C15, and anti-HA-probe Abs were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); dinitrophenyl-specific monoclonal mouse IgE was purchased from Sigma; rat anti-mouse IgE mAb was purchased from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). The anti-Ub mAb FK2 (PW8810) and the proteasome inhibitors were purchased from Affiniti Research Products Limited (Mamhead, Exeter, United Kingdom). The rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells were cultured in monolayers as described previously (19Paolini R. Kinet J.-P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The B2 sub-clone derived by a Syk-negative variant of RBL-2H3 cells and clones obtained by stable transfection of the B2 have been described previously (48Zhang J. Berenstien E.H. Evans R.L. Siraganian R.P. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In the experiments where FcεRI immunoprecipitation was performed, RBL cells were stimulated with IgE plus Ag (Figs. 1, 3, 5, and 7). Briefly, adherent cells were incubated with 0.5 μg/ml monomeric monoclonal anti-DNP mouse IgE for 12 h at 37 °C. The cells were then harvested, resuspended at 107/ml in prewarmed EMEM, and stimulated by adding DNP coupled to human serum albumin (DNP-HSA) (1 μg/ml) for the indicated lengths of time.Figure 3Ag-induced FcεRI β chain ubiquitination requires the presence of Syk. An Syk-negative variant of the RBL-2H3 cells and stable transfectants derived from this variant expressing the wild-type (Syk) or a kinase inactive form (Syk KI) of rat Syk, were stimulated with DNP-HSA for 1 min. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-IgE polyclonal Ab, resolved by 4–20% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose and sequentially immunoblotted, after stripping, with anti-Ub, anti-β, and anti-PY mAbs, as indicated.

After washing out the unbound Ab, cells were resuspended at 107/ml in prewarmed medium, and GAM (1.5 μg/106 cells) was added for the indicated lengths of time. After stimulation, the cells (25 × 106/ml) were lysed in a buffer (pH 8) containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 200 mmboric acid, 160 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmNa3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 5 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin as previously described (19Paolini R. Kinet J.-P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Lysates were cleared of debris by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min, and the protein concentration was determined using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. For experiments requiring inhibition of proteasome degradation, cells were pretreated with 10 μm epoxomicin for 4 h. Cell viability was >90% before stimulation. For immunoprecipitation, postnuclear supernatants were first precleared by mixing with protein G- (Sigma-Aldrich, Italy), or protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences, Cologno Monzese, Milan, Italy) for 1 h at 4 °C and then immunoprecipitated with the indicated Abs pre-bound to protein G- or protein A-Sepharose beads. After gentle rotation at 4 °C for 2–12 h the beads were washed five times with lysis buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted with 2× SDS-sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE on precast minigels (Novex Experimental Technologies, San Diego, CA), and transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose filters. After blocking nonspecific reactivity, filters were probed with specific Abs diluted in TBS-T (20 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20). After extensive washing, immunoreactivity was detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences, Italy). WR strain vaccinia virus and recombinant vaccinia viruses encoding wild-type or a kinase inactive porcine Syk mutant and human hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged wild-type c-Cbl or the 70Z Cbl mutant (17-amino acid deletion in the RING finger domain) have been previously described (17El-Hillal O.

Kinet J.-P. Samelson L.E. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1713-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The recombinant viruses were amplified, semipurified, and titered as previously described (20Paolini R. Serra A. Molfetta R. Piccoli M. Frati L. Santoni A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 3179-3187Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). RBL cells were infected with three plaque forming units/cell of the indicated semipurified recombinant vaccinia viruses in EMEM with 5% fetal bovine serum for 2 h, washed twice, and incubated overnight in EMEM with or without (depending on the kind of stimulation, see above) 0.5 μg/ml of monoclonal IgE anti-DNP for surface IgE receptor loading. Infected cells were harvested with phosphate-buffered saline and 1 mm EDTA, washed, and resuspended in EMEM. Cells were stimulated as above described. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Syk polyclonal Ab, and immune complex kinase assay was performed as previously described (50Paolini R. Serra A. Kinet J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15987-15992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The degree of degranulation was determined by measuring the release of β-hexosaminidase. RBL cells cultured overnight with anti-DNP IgE were seeded in 24-well plates (0.5 × 106/well) and pretreated with epoxomicin or vehicle alone (Me2SO) for 2 h in EMEM containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 10 mm Hepes pH 7.4, before stimulation. The cell monolayers were then washed twice with Tyrode's buffer (10 mm Hepes buffer pH 7.4, 130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.4 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin) and stimulated with DNP-HSA at concentrations from 0.1 to 1000 ng/ml or with 1 μm thapsigargin for the indicated lengths of time in the same buffer. The enzymatic activity of β-hexosaminidase in supernatants and cell pellets solubilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in Tyrode's buffer was measured with p-nitrophenylN-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminide in 0.1m sodium citrate (pH 4.5) for 60 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.2 m glycine (pH 10.7). The release of the product 4-p-nitrophenol was detected by absorbance at 405 nm. The extent of degranulation was calculated by dividing the 4-p-nitrophenol absorbance in the supernatant by the sum of the absorbance in the supernatants and in cell pellets solubilized in detergent. We first wanted to examine whether, in addition to the ligand-induced FcεRI β and γ ubiquitination, the tyrosine kinase Syk is subjected to modification by Ub upon receptor engagement. Adherent RBL-2H3 cells were incubated overnight with anti-DNP IgE mAb and stimulated (or not) with the multivalent antigen DNP-HSA for the indicated lengths of time (Fig. 1). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-IgE (Fig. 1, A andB) or anti-Syk (C) polyclonal Abs and the immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted as indicated. The results shown inpanel A confirm the presence of β and γ species modified by addition of Ub molecules (indicated by parentheses). A better characterization of all the modified receptor species was reported in our previous study (19Paolini R. Kinet J.-P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Additional bands were also detected by the anti-Ub blot; they likely represent ubiquitinated proteins coprecipitating with the receptor subunits. The time-course experiment presented in panel B shows that receptor ubiquitination occurs as an early event of the signaling cascade, paralleling the induction of β and γ tyrosine phosphorylation. In agreement with our previous study (50Paolini R. Serra A. Kinet J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15987-15992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), we show that the level of receptor subunits decreases after receptor engagement and with the time of stimulation (panel B, lower). This may be due to cellular redistribution of engaged receptors to a relatively Triton-insoluble compartment and/or to a degradation process promoted by receptor engagement. Immunoblotting of electrophoresed and transferred Syk precipitates demonstrates that, besides the main form migrating around 72,000 daltons, additional bands of higher molecular mass reacting with anti-Syk are rapidly induced upon receptor aggregation (Fig.1 C). Most of these induced forms (indicated byasterisks) are tyrosine-phosphorylated and/or -ubiquitinated as shown by the anti-PY and the anti-Ub blots, respectively. The same immunoprecipitates blotted with an isotype-matched control mAb do not show any reactivity in the 72,000-dalton or higher molecular mass range (data not shown). Similar results were obtained when RBL cells were stimulated with lower levels of multivalent antigen or with an anti-FcεRI α chain mAb (BC4) (data not shown). Taken together these findings indicate that FcεRI engagement on RBL cells promotes both receptor and Syk ubiquitination. The results presented in Fig. 1 Csuggest that the activation of Syk may be required to promote Syk ubiquitination. To directly test this hypothesis, RBL cells were infected with recombinant vaccinia viruses encoding either porcine wild-type Syk or a kinase-inactive mutant form of Syk (Syk-KI). After infection, cells were left untreated or incubated with the anti-FcεRI α chain mAb and then stimulated with a goat anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2fragment (GAM). Anti-Syk immunoprecipitates were resolved on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with the same anti-Syk Ab used for immunoprecipitation or anti-Ub mAb (Fig.2 A). Ligand-induced ubiquitinated forms of Syk accumulated only when the wild-type but not the kinase inactive form of Syk was overexpressed indicating that Syk ubiquitination depends on its own kinase activity. Furthermore, we found that a mutation in the C-terminal SH2 domain of Syk affecting its plasma membrane recruitment through the tyrosine-phosphorylated receptor subunits (28Sawasdikosol S. Pratt J.C. Meng W. Eck M.J. Burakoff S.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1471: M1-M12PubMed Google Scholar) significantly decreases the ligand-induced ubiquitination of Syk (data not shown). Comparable levels of Syk and Syk-KI were overexpressed as detected by immunoblotting the total cell lysates with an anti-Syk polyclonal Ab reacting with both rat and porcine Syk (B). Taken together, our results indicate that the ligand-induced ubiquitination of Syk depends on its membrane recruitment and activation. We then asked whether the Syk kinase activity was also necessary for FcεRI Ag-induced ubiquitination. To address this question we employed a Syk-deficient RBL-2H3-derived cell line (B2) and clones obtained by stable transfection of the B2 cell line with wild-type or a kinase-dead mutant form of rat Syk (KI). The clones were stimulated and lysed as in Fig. 1 A, and the effect of Ag stimulation on the FcεRI β chain tyrosine phosphorylation and ubiquitination was evaluated (Fig.3). As previously reported (48Zhang J. Berenstien E.H. Evans R.L. Siraganian R.P. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), the expression of Syk is not required for β chain phosphorylation that was similar in all the clones. The β chain was also extensively ubiquitinated upon receptor engagement when WT Syk was present. In contrast, there was no detectable β ubiquitination in the absence of Syk or in the presence of its kinase-dead mutant. Although we observed a decrease in the level of β chain after receptor engagement (see also Fig. 1), the amounts of immunoprecipitated β chain were comparable in each clones (lower panel). Thus, the kinase activity of Syk is required not only for its own ligand-induced ubiquitination but also for receptor ubiquitination. It has become increasingly evident that c-Cbl, acting as an E3 ligase, controls the ligand-induced ubiquitination of several receptor and non-receptor PTKs (22Rao N. Ghosh A.K. Ota S. Zhou P.

The vesicle-associated membrane protein, VAMP2, a v- or R-SNARE, forms a specific SNARE complex with the target membrane-associated t- or Q-SNAREs syntaxin 1 and SNAP-25, whose parallel orientation brings the two membranes in close enough proximity to fuse (1Lin R.C.

Cell. 1997; 90: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Structurally the SNARE complex is a four-helix bundle comprised of one coiled-coil-forming domain from each of syntaxin and VAMP and two from SNAP-25 (3Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1881) Google Scholar, 4Poirier M.A. Xiao W. Macosko J.C. Chan C. Shin Y.K. Bennett M.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 765-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). The center of the bundle is made up of 15 hydrophobic layers from the “a” and “d” positions of the heptad repeats of these coiled-coil-forming domains, whereas the central “ionic” layer is highly conserved and polar in nature, containing a glutamine residue in the three t-SNAREs and an arginine in the v-SNARE (3Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1881) Google Scholar), hence the classification of v- and t-SNAREs as R- and Q-SNAREs, respectively (5Fasshauer D. Sutton R.B. Brunger A.T. Jahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15781-15786Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). The parallel orientation and high stability of the SNARE bundle led to the proposal that its formation drives the mixing of the membrane bilayers by zippering up through the transmembrane domains of syntaxin and VAMP (1Lin R.C.

After the fusion event, the SNAREs are in acis-complex in the same membrane and must be dissociated by the action of the ATPase NSF and α-SNAP, so that SNAREs can be regenerated for the next round of fusion (10Mayer A. Wickner W. Haas A. Cell. 1996; 85: 83-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 11Xu T. Ashery U. Burgoyne R.D. Neher E.

In addition to mediating the fusion event, the SNARE proteins have also been implicated in the specificity of membrane fusion, the SNARE hypothesis stating that a particular v-SNARE on a transport vesicle should only form a specific complex with its cognate t-SNARE on the correct target membrane, thereby ensuring that the vesicles only fuse with the right compartment (14Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1993) Google Scholar). Although this hypothesis was cast into doubt by the finding that soluble v-SNAREs (lacking their transmembrane domains) can form highly stable complexes with a variety of noncognate t-SNAREs in vitro (15Yang B. Gonzalez L., Jr. Prekeris R. Steegmaier M. Advani R.J. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5649-5653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 16Fasshauer D. Antonin W. Margittai M. Pabst S. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15440-15446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), not all of these noncognate SNARE complexes have been shown to result in membrane fusion in functional assays. Synthetic liposomes bearing the yeast t-SNARE equivalents of syntaxin 1 and SNAP-25 (Sso1 and Sec9, respectively) fuse with liposomes containing any transmembrane R-SNARE as the v-SNARE (such as Sec22 and Nyv1), not just the cognate VAMP2 homologues Snc1 and Snc2 (17McNew J.A. Parlati F. Fukuda R. Johnston R.J. Paz K. Paumet F. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. Nature. 2000; 407: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). However, with the vacuolar t-SNAREs (Vam3/Vam7/Vti1), only the cognate Nyv1 v-SNARE mediates liposome fusion (of those so far tested) (17McNew J.A. Parlati F. Fukuda R. Johnston R.J. Paz K. Paumet F. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. Nature. 2000; 407: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Thus, in the absence of other proteins, the SNAREs by themselves do impart some degree of specificity to liposome fusion. However, in permeabilized PC12 cells, fusion mediated by syntaxin 1 and SNAP-25 can be blocked by soluble VAMP2 (the cognate v-SNARE, which prevents fusion by displacing the membrane-bound VAMP2) but not by soluble Sec22 (18Scales S.J. Chen Y.A. Yoo B.Y. Patel S.M. Doung Y.C. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 2000; 26: 457-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), which does form complexes in the liposome system (17McNew J.A. Parlati F. Fukuda R. Johnston R.J. Paz K. Paumet F. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. Nature. 2000; 407: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). This indicates that SNARE complex formation in the presence of cellular proteins is more specific than in their absence and suggests that such cellular factors may regulate the formation of specific SNARE complexes, thereby ensuring multiple layers of specificity. Thus, it appears that the upstream regulation of SNARE complex assembly, and not just the SNAREs themselves, also underlies the specificity of vesicle fusion. Other than the syntaxin chaperone n-sec1, which is thought to mediate a conformational change in syntaxin 1 that enables it to form complexes with SNAP-25 and VAMP2 (19Misura K.M. Scheller R.H. Weis W.I. Nature. 2000; 404: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 20Brunger A.T. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), little is known about upstream proteins that could regulate SNARE complex formation. Rabs and their effectors have been proposed to play a role in stimulating n-sec1-mediated conformational changes and also in regulating vesicle tethering, but no Rab/Rab effector pair has yet been directly shown to regulate the formation of the synaptic SNARE complex (19Misura K.M. Scheller R.H. Weis W.I. Nature. 2000; 404: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 21Gonzalez L., Jr. Scheller R.H.

Another candidate for the displacement of n-sec1 from syntaxin is munc-13, which acts at the priming stage of exocytosis (23Ashery U. Varoqueaux F. Voets T. Betz A. Thakur P. Koch H. Neher E. Brose N. Rettig J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3586-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), during which loose SNARE complexes form (24Xu T. Binz T. Niemann H. Neher E. Nat.

Neuron. 2001; 30: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Munc-13 has also been shown to functionally interact with the Rab3 effector RIM1, which could provide a link between tethering and SNARE complex formation (26Betz A. Thakur P. Junge H.J. Ashery U. Rhee J.S. Scheuss V. Rosenmund C. Rettig J. Brose N. Neuron. 2001; 30: 183-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). A brain-specific protein named m-tomosyn (27Fujita Y. Shirataki H. Sakisaka T. Asakura T. Ohya T. Kotani H. Yokoyama S. Nishioka H. Matsuura Y. Mizoguchi A. Scheller R.H. Takai Y.

Commun. 1999; 256: 218-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), which binds to syntaxin via a VAMP-like coil domain in its C terminus (29Masuda E.S. Huang B.C. Fisher J.M. Luo Y. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1998; 21: 479-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), has also recently been proposed to trigger the removal of n-sec1 from syntaxin, thereby regulating formation of the synaptic SNARE complex (27Fujita Y. Shirataki H. Sakisaka T. Asakura T. Ohya T. Kotani H. Yokoyama S. Nishioka H. Matsuura Y. Mizoguchi A. Scheller R.H. Takai Y. Neuron. 1998; 20: 905-91528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). However, it is not yet understood if or how this occurs, nor how VAMP replaces tomosyn in binding to syntaxin to form the fusion complex. In addition, it is not yet known whether proteins like tomosyn could regulate the availability of SNAP-25 or VAMP for SNARE complex formation. Here we identify a novel protein that has similarity in its coil domain to tomosyn and VAMP8 and that also binds to syntaxins 1 and 4 and may play a role in regulating the formation of SNARE complexes. Based on the naming of tomosyn (“tomo” meaning “friend” in Japanese) (27Fujita Y. Shirataki H. Sakisaka T. Asakura T. Ohya T. Kotani H. Yokoyama S. Nishioka H. Matsuura Y. Mizoguchi A. Scheller R.H. Takai Y. Neuron. 1998; 20: 905-91528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), we named our syntaxin-binding protein amisyn (“ami” being the French for “friend”). Amisyn was identified by tBLAST-N searching the expressed sequence tag database for homologues of the coil domain of tomosyn. One of 15–18 overlapping human expressed sequence tags (IMAGE clone identification number 769018 from ATCC (zw11g06.r1); GenBankTM accession number AA426302) covered the entire clone (with a couple of sequencing errors) except the first 4 bases (ATGA, which were directly preceded by a stop codon) because of cleavage by the cloning enzyme EcoRI, which were inserted by PCR where necessary. DNAs encoding the full-length (aa 1–222), N terminus (aa 1–155), and coil domain (aa 158–222) were subcloned into pGEX-KG for recombinant expression and Myc-pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) for mammalian cell transfection. Site-directed mutagenesis of amisyn was achieved using the Stratagene QuikChange protocol and verified by sequencing, as previously performed for VAMP2 (30Scales S.J. Yoo B.Y. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14262-14267Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The recombinant amisyn coil domain was expressed and purified as previously published for the SNARE proteins (18Scales S.J. Chen Y.A. Yoo B.Y. Patel S.M. Doung Y.C. Scheller R.H.

SNARE complex formation, gel filtration purification, and circular dichroism analysis were as described (8Chen Y.A. Scales S.J. Patel S.M. Doung Y.C. Scheller R.H.

SNARE complexes were dissociated as previously reported (30Scales S.J. Yoo B.Y. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14262-14267Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). GST-tagged SNAREs as indicated were purified on glutathione-agarose beads, and their concentrations were estimated by SDS-PAGE. For the experiment in Fig. 2 A, ∼5 μm GST proteins were incubated with 1 or 3 μm soluble amisyn coil in a total of 50 μl of buffer A (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 150 mm KCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.1% gelatin) for 2 h at 4 °C prior to washing twice in 200 μl of buffer A and twice in buffer A containing 5% glycerol instead of gelatin. Bound proteins were eluted in sample buffer, and110 was used for 17% SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-amisyn coil antibodies. In Fig. 2 B the indicated amounts (0–10 μm) of amisyn coil or SNAP-25 N terminus (aa 1–82) were incubated with ∼1 μm GST-syntaxin 1 (or GST alone) beads and washed as in Fig. 2 A, with 13of the sample being used for Western blotting with anti-amisyn coil or anti-SNAP-25 N-terminal antibodies. Fig. 2 C utilized the same protocol as Fig. 2 B except for the differences detailed in the figure legend. A synthetic peptide encompassing aa 2–30 of amisyn was partially dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mm dithiothreitol and 20% Me2SO for 3 h at 37 °C, and 2 mg was coupled to 1.23 mg of keyhole limpet hemocyanin with 10 mm glutaraldehyde and used as an immunogen to immunize rabbits (Josman, LLC).

Rat organs were homogenized in 3 ml of HB buffer (20 mm Hepes pH 7.2, 10 mm sucrose, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 6 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin A) per gram in a Teflon-glass homogenizer. For cell extracts, 0.5 ml of HB/confluent 10-cm dish was used. Post-nuclear supernatant (PNS) was produced by spinning at 1000 × g for 15 min. For the Western blots in Fig. 4(A and B), equal total PNS concentrations of different tissues and cell lines, respectively, were loaded on 12% SDS-PAGE gels. A 1-h 100,000 × g spin (or only 20,000 × g where indicated) of the PNS resulted in cytosol (supernatant) and a membrane pellet, which was extracted by incubation at 4 °C in 1% Triton X-100 in HB where indicated, after which Triton-insoluble material was removed by another 100,000 ×g spin for 30 min. For the membrane extraction in Fig.5 B, membranes spun down at 20,000 × g for 15 min were washed once in HB, repelleted, and then extracted for 30 min in HB containing either 1.5 m NaCl, 2 murea, 0.2 m sodium carbonate, pH 11, or 2% Triton X-100 as indicated prior to a 1-h spin at 100,000 × g (38Bock J.B.

Equal protein concentrations were loaded in each lane of a 12% SDS-PAGE gel, which was blotted and immunodecorated with anti-amisyn coil antibodies.B, the membrane-bound fraction of amisyn resists extraction. The membrane-bound fraction from A was divided into equal parts and treated with either control buffer (C), 1.5m NaCl (NaCl), 2 m urea (Urea), 0.2 m sodium carbonate, pH 11.0 (pH 11), or 2% Triton X-100 (TX100) for 30 min at 4 °C prior to recentrifugation at 100,000 × gand immunoblotting the entire supernatant (S) and pellet (P). The blot was cut at the appropriate molecular masses to allow immunodecoration with anti- n-sec1, syntaxin 1, amisyn, and VAMP2 antibodies and detection by ECL. The anti-amisyn blot was exposed for longer than the others because of the relatively low abundance of this protein. C, the membrane-bound fraction is not in a stable complex. Equal concentrations of cytosol (C) and Triton-solubilized membranes (D) from rat brain were subjected to 11–34% glycerol gradient sedimentation at 91,000 ×g for 18h in a buffer containing EDTA so as to preserve any SNARE complexes. The fractions were collected from the top and analyzed by Western blotting with the indicated antibodies.

After pelleting the Percoll, the supernatants were concentrated in a Centrikon-10 concentrator and loaded onto a 12% SDS-PAGE gel for Western blotting. PNS, cytosol, and membranes were prepared from two frozen rat brains as described above, except that the membranes were washed once and repelleted in HB before extracting both the PNS and membranes with 1% Triton X-100 for 1 h at 4 °C. After spinning to remove any Triton-insoluble material, the three extracts were diluted to equal concentrations (determined by the Bio-Rad Bradford assay), precleared with protein A-Sepharose for 5 h, and then divided equally into tubes to be incubated with the indicated antibodies and protein A-Sepharose overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times in HB with 1% Triton X-100 and twice in 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, and then the bound proteins were eluted by boiling in sample buffer and analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. PC12 cells were loaded with [3H]norepinephrine, permeabilized by cracking, and extracted with EGTA as described previously (8Chen Y.A. Scales S.J. Patel S.M. Doung Y.C. Scheller R.H.

For the regular release assay, the cells were washed three times in KGlu buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 105 mm potassium glutamate, 20 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm EGTA) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and then ∼106 cells/reaction were stimulated to secrete norepinephrine by warming to 30 °C in the presence of 2 mm MgATP, ∼0.7 mg/ml rat brain cytosol, and 1.6 mm total Ca2+ (∼1 μm free Ca2+, measured by fura-2 fluorescence as in Ref. 41Chen Y.A.

Where indicated, the soluble coil domains of various SNARE proteins or amisyn were included in the reaction as described (18Scales S.J. Chen Y.A. Yoo B.Y. Patel S.M. Doung Y.C. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 2000; 26: 457-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). For the rescue assays, the cells were treated with 30 nm botulinum neurotoxin E for 10 min at 30 °C in the presence of 2 mm MgATP and ∼0.7 mg/ml rat brain cytosol prior to the three washes, and 50 μmSNAP-25 C-terminal coil was included in the stimulation mixture to rescue exocytosis (as in Ref. 8Chen Y.A. Scales S.J. Patel S.M. Doung Y.C. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1999; 97: 165-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, the 30 °C stimulation was for 30 min, and then the reactions were chilled on ice and centrifuged at 2500 × g at 4 °C for 30 min, and the percentage of [3H]norepinephrine released into the supernatant was measured by scintillation counting (the cell pellets were solubilized in 1% Triton X-100 for 1h at 42 °C prior to counting). The results were plotted using Cricket Graph 1.5.2 software (Computer Associates International, Inc.). A data base search for homologues of the VAMP-like coil domain of tomosyn (27Fujita Y. Shirataki H. Sakisaka T. Asakura T. Ohya T. Kotani H. Yokoyama S. Nishioka H. Matsuura Y. Mizoguchi A. Scheller R.H. Takai Y. Neuron. 1998; 20: 905-91528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) revealed a novel protein of 222 aa, with a unique N-terminal domain and a tomosyn-like predicted coiled-coil-forming domain (with a probability of >91% according to the COILS program) at the C terminus (Fig.1 A). We named this protein amisyn, meaning “syntaxin friend,” because it binds to syntaxin (see below), and submitted it to the GenBankTM data base under accession number AF391153. An identical clone lacking the first 12 aa subsequently appeared as an independent submission under accession number BC009499. We believe that the extra 12 aa in our clone represents the full-length protein because the untagged clone expressed in COS cells migrated at an identical position to endogenous amisyn by SDS-PAGE under conditions where addition of a 12-aa Myc tag resulted in a clearly slower migrating band (data not shown). The coil domain of amisyn is also 100% identical to that of a putative 108-aa human cd34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell protein of unknown function encoded by mRNA HSPC156 on the same chromosome (chromosome 14) (accession number AF161505) (42Zhang Q.H., Ye, M., Wu, X.Y. Ren S.X. Zhao M. Zhao C.J., Fu, G. Shen Y. Fan H.Y., Lu, G. Zhong M., Xu, X.R. Han Z.G. Zhang J.W. Tao J. Huang Q.H. Zhou J., Hu, G.X., Gu, J. Chen S.J. Chen Z. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1546-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). However, the N terminus differs, and it remains to be determined whether or not the HSPC156 mRNA is translated or is a cloning artifact, because our anti-amisyn coil antibodies do not recognize a band of the expected size for this protein in hematopoietic cells present in bone marrow extract or in HL60 cells (data not shown), in which the HSPC156 mRNA is found (42Zhang Q.H., Ye, M., Wu, X.Y. Ren S.X. Zhao M. Zhao C.J., Fu, G. Shen Y. Fan H.Y., Lu, G. Zhong M., Xu, X.R. Han Z.G. Zhang J.W. Tao J. Huang Q.H. Zhou J., Hu, G.X., Gu, J. Chen S.J. Chen Z. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1546-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The coil domain of amisyn shows 37% identity and 50% similarity (z score = 16.2) to that of tomosyn, and both harbor an arginine residue typical of the VAMP family (5Fasshauer D. Sutton R.B. Brunger A.T. Jahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15781-15786Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar) at the central ionic layer position of the four-helix bundle (Fig. 1 B). Whereas the tomosyn coil shares most identity with VAMP1 and VAMP2 (both 41%) (29Masuda E.S. Huang B.C. Fisher J.M. Luo Y. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1998; 21: 479-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), the amisyn coil displays slightly greater identity to VAMP8 than VAMP2 (31% compared with 27%, respectively) (Fig. 1 B). However, unlike most SNAREs of the VAMP family, amisyn (like tomosyn) lacks a hydrophobic stretch that could serve as a transmembrane anchor, and although it has a C-terminal cysteine residue as well as 5 other cysteines, these do not form part of a typical palmitoylation motif (43Hancock J.F. Cadwallader K. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4033-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The N-terminal 157-aa domain of amisyn is also different from that of tomosyn (34% identity over only 35 aa, z score = −0.74), being related instead to a human protein of unknown function (cDNA FLJ10983; accession number AK001755; 36% identity over 200 aa; z score = 34.9) and to a Caenorhabditis elegans protein (F52E4.7 gene; accession number AAB54035; 31% identity over 144 aa; 42% similarity; z score = 18.2) (44Wilson R.

Cooper J. et al.Nature. 1994; 368: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar) that has similarity to Uso1p, a yeast protein implicated in the tethering of endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi transport vesicles (45Sapperstein S.K.

Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1097-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 C). However, there was no significant similarity with p115, the proposed mammalian homologue of Uso1p. An unnamed human protein (NP_060731) with homology to Sec3, a component of the exocyst, also shares 32% similarity with amisyn"

Several factors are known to affect expression of the mouse GnRHR (mGnRHR) gene, including GnRH and activin. We have previously shown that activin augments GnRH-mediated transcriptional activation of mGnRHR gene, and that region −387/−308 appears to be necessary to mediate this effect.

At the level of the anterior pituitary, GnRH1binds to a specific, G protein-coupled, heptahelical receptor on the surface of pituitary gonadotropes, known as the GnRH receptor (GnRHR) (1Stojilkovic S.S. Reinhart J. Catt K.J. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 462-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 2Clayton R.N. Endocr. Rev. 1989; 120: 11-19Google Scholar). Activation of these receptors stimulates intracellular signal transduction pathways to increase synthesis and release of the pituitary gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) (3Gharib S.D. Wierman M.E. Shupnik M.A. Chin W.W. Endocr. Rev. 1990; 11: 177-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar, 4Mercer J.E. Chin W.W. Human Reprod.

These hormones then enter the systemic circulation to regulate gonadal function, including steroid hormone synthesis and gametogenesis. The biosynthesis and secretion of LH and FSH by pituitary gonadotropes is highly regulated, and is dependent primarily on the amplitude and frequency of pulsatile GnRH from the hypothalamus (5Kaiser U.B. Jakubowiak A. Steinberger A. Chin W.W. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 931-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The response of pituitary gonadotropes to GnRH correlates directly with the concentration of GnRHR on the cell surface, which is mediated in part at the level of GnRHR gene expression (6Stojilkovic S.S. Catt K.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1995; 50: 161-205PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies in this laboratory have identified and partially characterized the promoter region of the mouse GnRHR (mGnRHR) gene (7Albarracin C.T. Kaiser U.B. Chin W.W. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2300-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and demonstrated that the regulatory elements for tissue-specific expression as well as for GnRH regulation are present within a 1.2-kb 5′-flanking region of the mGnRHR gene (designated −1164/+62 relative to the major transcriptional start site) (7Albarracin C.T.

Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 566-577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have begun to define how such factors interact at a cellular level to affect transcription of the mGnRHR gene. For example, GnRH-responsiveness of the mGnRHR gene has been localized to two distinct DNA elements: the consensus AP-1 binding site (5′-TGAGTCA-3′) at position −274/−268 and a novel enhancer element (5′-GCTAATTG-3′) at position −292/−285, designated Sequence UnderlyingResponsiveness to GnRH-1 (SURG-1) (13Norwitz E.R. Cardona G.R. Jeong K.-H. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 867-880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). More recently, we have shown that activin augments GnRH-mediated transcriptional activation of the mGnRHR gene and that region −387/−308 appears to be necessary to mediate this effect (16Norwitz E.R., Xu, S. Jeong K.-H. Bédécarrats G.Y. Winebrenner L.D. Chin W.W. Kaiser U.B. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 985-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This region contains two overlapping cis-regulatory elements of interest: GnRH Receptor ActivatingSequence (5′-CTAGTCACAACA-3′ (GRAS)) at position −329/−318 (15Duval D.L. Ellsworth B.S. Clay C.M. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1949-1952Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Duval D.L. Nelson S.E. Clay C.M. Mol.

Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). This study was designed to investigate the role of thesecis-regulatory elements and their cognate transcription factors in transcriptional activation of the mGnRHR gene. In functional transfection studies using murine gonadotrope-derived αT3–1 cells, GnRH agonist stimulation of region −387/−308 of the mGnRHR gene promoter resulted in a significant 3.8-fold increase in activity, which was further increased 2.7-fold (to 10.4-fold) following activin treatment. Activin treatment alone increased promoter activity by 2.2-fold. Competition EMSA experiments using region −335/−312 of the mGnRHR gene promoter as probe and nuclear extract from αT3–1 cells or SMAD, Jun, and Fos proteins demonstrated direct binding of AP-1 (Fos/Jun) protein complexes to −327/−322 (5′-AGTCAC-3′) and SMAD proteins to −329/−328 (5′-CT-3′). Further transfection studies using mutant constructs of these cis-regulatory elements in −387/−308 demonstrate that disruption of either complex eliminated both GnRH and activin responsiveness of this region. These data demonstrate that both GnRH- and activin-mediated transcriptional activation of the mGnRHR gene are mediated, at least in part, by direct binding of AP-1 (Fos/Jun) and SMAD protein complexes to the overlapping GRAS/SBE element of the mGnRHR gene promoter. Des-Gly10-[d-Ala6]-GnRH-ethylamide (GnRH agonist) was obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Recombinant human activin A and follistatin were a gift of Dr. A. F.

All oligonucleotides were prepared by Invitrogen (Gaithersburg, MD). αT3–1 and LβT2 cells were generously provided by Dr. Pamela Mellon (University of California-San Diego, San Diego, CA). A fusion construct was prepared by ligation of the 1.2 kb 5′-flanking region of the mGnRHR gene (designated −1164/+62) into the luciferase reporter plasmid, pXP2, as previously described (7Albarracin C.T.

The nucleotide sequence of the mGnRHR gene promoter used in these studies is based on previous work in this laboratory (7Albarracin C.T. Kaiser U.B. Chin W.W. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2300-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), with −1 assigned to the nucleotide immediately 5′ of the major transcriptional start site. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-generated fragments of the mGnRHR gene promoter were synthesized using selected sense/antisense primers with the −1164/+62 construct as a template, placed in control of the rat growth hormone gene minimal promoter (GH[−50/+1], designated GH50), and inserted upstream of the luciferase reporter in pXP2 as previously described (13Norwitz E.R. Cardona G.R. Jeong K.-H. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 867-880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These constructs were designated GH50/−387/−264 and GH50/−387/−308. Two 2-bp mutants of the putative SBE/GRAS element were prepared in the GH50/−387/−308 construct of the mGnRHR gene promoter using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with selected sense and antisense mutant oligonucleotides. These mutant constructs were designated GH50/−387/−308/μGRAS-3 (AG replacement of CT at −329/−328) and GH50/−387/−308/μGRAS-4 (CT replacement of AG at −327/−326) (refer to Fig. 5 A below). An expression vector expressing β-galactosidase driven by the Rous sarcoma virus promoter (RSV-β-galactosidase) was used as an internal standard and control. SMAD2, SMAD3, and SMAD4 expression vectors in pCS2 and A3-Luc-pGL2 (3× activin response element (GTCT) in pGL2) were gifts of Dr. Malcolm Whitman (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) (20Yeo C.Y. Chen X. Whitman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26584-26590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The identity of all reporter constructs was confirmed by sequencing using the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method. αT3–1 (mouse gonadotrope) cells were maintained in monolayer culture in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in humidified 5% CO2/95% air. For transient transfection studies, cells were divided into six-well tissue culture plates and cultured overnight in DMEM in the absence of serum or antibiotics. Under these conditions, cells were 60–80% confluent. Cells were then transfected with reporter plasmids containing mGnRHR gene promoter constructs of interest by calcium phosphate co-precipitation, as previously described (13Norwitz E.R. Cardona G.R. Jeong K.-H. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 867-880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated with the calcium phosphate-DNA precipitates in media containing 2% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. To optimize the transfection paradigm, a transfection time course was performed at 4, 20, and 48 h. In each experiment, luciferase reporter was standardized at 4 μg of DNA per well. An expression vector expressing RSV-β-galactosidase (1 μg/well) was co-transfected in all experiments and used as an internal standard to control for cell number and transfection efficiency. Following transfection, cells were treated with 100 nm GnRH agonist or vehicle in DMEM containing 2% serum (2 ml/well) for 4 h immediately prior to harvest. Following the final incubation, the medium was aspirated, and cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4). Cells were lysed in the wells by addition of 200 μl of lysis buffer (125 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100). Cellular debris was removed from lysate by microcentrifugation at 14,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were assayed immediately for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity by standard protocols as previously described (13Norwitz E.R. Cardona G.R. Jeong K.-H. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 867-880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 16Norwitz E.R., Xu, S. Jeong K.-H. Bédécarrats G.Y. Winebrenner L.D. Chin W.W. Kaiser U.B. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 985-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was normalized to expression of RSV-β-galactosidase. To investigate the effect of activin and/or follistatin on GnRH agonist-mediated transcriptional activation of the mGnRHR gene, αT3–1 cells were transiently transfected with deletion and mutation constructs of the mGnRHR gene promoter in pXP2 for 48 h. Cells were treated with or without activin A (20 ng/ml), activin B (20 ng/ml), and/or follistatin (100 ng/ml) for the final 20 h of the 48-h transfection time period, and the response to GnRH agonist stimulation (100 nm for 4 h) was measured. Prior studies in this laboratory have shown that the presence or absence of activin during the 4-h GnRH agonist stimulation did not affect the response to GnRH agonist stimulation (16Norwitz E.R., Xu, S. Jeong K.-H. Bédécarrats G.Y. Winebrenner L.D. Chin W.W. Kaiser U.B. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 985-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). As such, activin was not added during this incubation. The final concentration of activin A used in these experiments was based on prior studies demonstrating that 20 ng/ml is sufficient to mediate an effect on the mGnRHR gene promoter in transient transfection experiments (13Norwitz E.R.

We have used fluorescence immunocytochemistry to confirm expression of SMAD2 and SMAD3 in both αT3–1 and LβT2 mouse gonadotrope-derived cell lines under basal conditions and to investigate the effect of activin and GnRH treatment on SMAD expression. Cells were cultured in DMEM containing 2% fetal calf serum to 40–60% confluence on glass cover slips placed in six-well tissue culture plates. Cells were treated with activin A (20 ng/ml), GnRH agonist (100 nm), or vehicle for 4, 24, or 48 h. Thereafter, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS prior to immunofluorescence staining as previously described (21Xu J. Oakley J. McGee E.A. Biol. Reprod. 2002; 66: 1571-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Briefly, after incubation with PBS containing 10% goat serum for 1 h at 4 °C in a humidified chamber, specific rabbit polyclonal antisera against SMAD2 or SMAD3 (final concentration 5 mg/ml (Zymed Laboratories)) were applied to the cells and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Thereafter, cells were washed in PBS, and biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (1:200 dilution, Vector Laboratories) was applied for 1 h at 4 °C followed by fluorescein avidin D cell sorter (1:200 dilution, Vector Laboratories) for a further 1 h at 4 °C. After washing with cold PBS, cells were incubated with propidium iodide (PI, 0.5 mg/ml in PBS) for 5 min at room temperature to stain the nuclei. Finally, cells were washed with distilled water, and the cover slips were mounted onto glass slides using Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). Negative controls used antisera pre-absorbed with SMAD2 or SMAD3 peptide (R&D Systems, 50 mg/ml) for 2 h. Rat granulosa cells were used as a positive control (21Xu J. Oakley J. McGee E.A. Biol. Reprod. 2002; 66: 1571-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Slides were visualized using a Leica DMBRE microscope outfitted with a light/darkfield and 510- and 580-nm fluorescence filters, and images were overlaid using KS300 computer software (DFI Technologies, Inc., Sacramento, CA). To investigate the effect of SMAD overexpression on transcriptional activation of the mGnRHR gene promoter, expression vectors encoding selected SMAD proteins were transfected into αT3–1 cells along with the GH50/−387/−308 construct, and the response to activin- and GnRH agonist-stimulation was measured as previously described (13Norwitz E.R. Cardona G.R. Jeong K.-H. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 867-880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, αT3–1 cells were transfected with GH50/−387/−308 (4 μg/well) plus SMAD3 and SMAD4 expression vectors or pCS2 alone (4 μg/well) for 48 h and treated with or without activin A (20 ng/ml for the last 20 h of the 48 h transfection) and/or GnRH agonist (100 nm for 4 h after the 48 h transfection). To confirm that the SMAD proteins overexpressed in αT3–1 cells were able to exert a functional effect, the SMAD expression vectors were each co-transfected with a reporter construct (A3-Luc-pGL2) known to be responsive to SMAD3 and SMAD4 (20Yeo C.Y. Chen X. Whitman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26584-26590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). αT3–1 cells were grown to 60–80% confluence and treated with GnRH agonist (100 nm), activin A (20 ng/ml), or vehicle for 1, 4, or 24 h. Thereafter, cells were harvested, and nuclear extracts were prepared by the method of Andrews and Faller (22Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). Purified c-Jun protein was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). Because purified Fos proteins were not commercially available, the cDNA sequences encoding c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, and Fra-2 were isolated and amplified by reverse transcription-PCR from RNA prepared from αT3–1 cells and subcloned into pCS2 expression plasmids, and proteins were prepared byin vitro translation using the TnT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate Systems kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In vitro translated SMAD2, SMAD3, and SMAD4 proteins were similarly prepared using the same SMAD-pCS2 expression plasmids as those used in the transfection studies. The identity of the inserts in each of the pCS2 expression vectors was confirmed by DNA sequencing using the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (data not shown). The presence and identity of thein vitro translated proteins were confirmed by preparing35S-labeled controls with each in vitrotranslation experiment, visualizing the resultant protein on a 12% protein gel, and verifying the size of the protein using standard size markers (data not shown). Probes were prepared for EMSA by annealing of complementary oligonucleotides representing selected regions of the mGnRHR gene promoter, followed by 5′-end labeling with [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) by T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England BioLabs, Inc., Beverly, MA). The binding reaction for EMSA was performed by incubating 50,000 cpm of DNA probe with 5 μg of nuclear extract and 2 μg of salmon sperm DNA in reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 5% (v/v) glycerol) for 30 min at 4 °C. On occasion, EMSA experiments were performed using purified c-Jun protein (Promega) and/or in vitrotranslated c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, Fra-2, SMAD2, SMAD3, and/or SMAD4 proteins in place of nuclear extract. For competition studies, excess unlabeled (cold) DNA was added 5 min prior to the addition of probe. Oligonucleotides used for competition EMSA experiments included regions −335/−312 (that contains the SBE/GRAS element, 5′-ATCTGTCTAGTCACAACA-3′ (see Fig. 5 A)), −335/−312/μGRAS-1 through −335/−312/μGRAS-9 (see Fig.5 A), −281/−261 (AP-1) of mGnRHR gene promoter, and CE3 (5′-GCCTGCCTCACACCAGGATGCTAAGCCTCTGTCCAG-3′ (23Drouin J. Lamolet B. Lamonerie T. Lanctot C. Tremblay J.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 140: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar)) as an unrelated sequence. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on 5% low ionic strength non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA buffer (45 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 45 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA). The gels were then dried for 1 h and subjected to autoradiography for 24–48 h. Transfections were performed in triplicate and repeated multiple times. Data in each experiment were expressed as luciferase/β-galactosidase activity. Data were combined across experiments, and the results were expressed as means ± S.E. for basal and GnRH agonist- and/or activin-stimulated activities for each construct and -fold stimulation in response to agonist was calculated. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post hoc comparisons with Fisher's protected least significant difference test was used to assess whether changes in GnRH agonist and/or activin responsiveness among different GnRHR promoter-luciferase reporter constructs were significant. Significant differences were designated asp < 0.05. When appropriate, data were analyzed by the Student's t test for independent samples. We have previously shown that activin A augments GnRH-mediated transcriptional activation of the mGnRHR gene promoter in αT3–1 cells (16Norwitz E.R., Xu, S. Jeong K.-H. Bédécarrats G.Y. Winebrenner L.D. Chin W.W. Kaiser U.B. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 985-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In those experiments, however, activin A alone had no effect (16Norwitz E.R., Xu, S. Jeong K.-H. Bédécarrats G.Y. Winebrenner L.D. Chin W.W. Kaiser U.B. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 985-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We have attributed this to the transfection paradigm used in these prior experiments (viz. activin A treatment at a final concentration of 20 ng/ml for 20 h followed by a 4-h calcium-phosphate transfection and a 4-h treatment with 100 nm GnRH agonist). To investigate further the effect of activin on transcriptional activation of the mGnRHR gene promoter, we chose to modify our transient transfection conditions. A transfection time course using region −387/−308 of the mGnRHR gene promoter upstream of the GH50 heterologous promoter in pXP2-Luc demonstrated a significant response to 20 ng/ml activin A treatment at 48 h (1.8 ± 0.2-fold; p < 0.05, ANOVA), whereas the responses at 4 h (1.3 ± 0.2-fold) and 20 h (1.2 ± 0.3-fold) were not significantly different from GH50/−387/−308 control (Fig.1 A). This time course is consistent with prior studies from our laboratory, demonstrating maximal stimulation of GnRHR mRNA levels by activin at 36 h in αT3–1 cells (14Fernández-Vásquez G. Kaiser U.B. Albarracin C.T. Chin W.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 356-366PubMed Google Scholar). Similar results were observed with region −387/−264 of the mGnRHR gene promoter, although the magnitude of the response to GnRH agonist was greater, because this region contains both the −387/−308 region of interest as well as the previously described bipartite GnRH-response element, AP-1 and SURG-1 (13Norwitz E.R. Cardona G.R. Jeong K.-H. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 867-880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) (data not shown). No difference was noted between treatment with activin A (National Hormone and Pituitary Program) or activin B (R&D Systems) (data not shown). In light of these data and prior studies showing no difference between 20 and 50 ng/ml activin A treatment (16Norwitz E.R., Xu, S. Jeong K.-H. Bédécarrats G.Y. Winebrenner L.D. Chin W.W. Kaiser U.B. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 985-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), all subsequent experiments were performed using a transfection time of 48 h and activin A at a final concentration of 20 ng/ml for the last 20 h of the transfection. In functional transfection studies using αT3–1 cells and a transfection time of 48 h, GnRH agonist stimulation of GH50/−387/−308 resulted in a 3.8 ± 0.2-fold increase in luciferase activity as compared with vector alone (p < 0.0001, ANOVA), which was further increased 2.7-fold (to 10.4 ± 1.6-fold) following activin treatment. Activin treatment alone significantly increased promoter activity by 2.2 ± 0.2-fold (p < 0.05, ANOVA) (Fig.1 B). The addition of follistatin (100 ng/ml) to the activin-containing treatment mixture for the final 20 h of the 48-h transfection followed by GnRH agonist stimulation (100 nm for 4 h) resulted in complete abrogation of the activin response and of the synergistic response to GnRH agonist and activin. Follistatin also significantly decreased basal luciferase activity (Fig. 1 B). However, the fold response to GnRH agonist alone was unaffected (Fig. 1 B). These data suggest that the activin response of the mGnRHR gene promoter as well as the synergistic response to GnRH-agonist and activin is mediated by activin-activin receptor binding, a process that can be inhibited by follistatin. Because activin acts primarily by activating activin-responsive SMAD transcription factors (viz. SMAD2, SMAD3, and SMAD4) in the cytoplasm of target cells, we chose to investigate the effect of SMAD overexpression on activin- and GnRH agonist-mediated transcriptional activation of the mGnRHR gene. All SMAD proteins were shown to be functionally active by demonstrating a significant increase in luciferase activity in αT3–1 cells transfected with SMAD expression vectors and the A3-Luc-pGL2 reporter plasmid (data not shown), which is known to be responsive to SMAD2, SMAD3, and SMAD4 (20Yeo C.Y. Chen X. Whitman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26584-26590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that overexpression of SMAD2 or SMAD3 along with SMAD4, but not overexpression of any one of the SMAD proteins alone, significantly increased transcriptional activation of the GH50/−387/−264 construct of the mGnRHR gene promoter (16Norwitz E.R., Xu, S. Jeong K.-H. Bédécarrats G.Y. Winebrenner L.D. Chin W.W. Kaiser U.B. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 985-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Whether this is true also of region −387/−308 of the mGnRHR gene promoter has not previously been investigated. Consistent with the data presented in Fig. 1 (A andB), activin and GnRH agonist treatment of αT3–1 cells transiently transfected with the GH50/−387/−308 construct of the mGnRHR gene promoter and pCS2 plasmid resulted"
https://openalex.org/W2055725649,"Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) is a key molecule mediating signals of insulin in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). To examine the effect of chronic activation of PI3K on the gene expression of VSMCs, membrane-targeted p110CAAX, a catalytic subunit of PI3K, was overexpressed in rat VSMCs by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer. Similar to insulin's effects, cells overexpressing p110CAAX exhibited a 10- to 15-fold increase in monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) mRNA expression as compared with the control cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis showed that the overexpression of p110CAAX activated neither the NF-κB binding nor the activator protein (AP-1) binding activities. We found that two CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) binding sites located between 2.6 and 3.6 kb upstream of the MCP-1 gene were responsible for the induction by p110CAAX. The overexpression of C/EBP-β and C/EBP-δ but not C/EBP-α caused 6- to 8-fold induction of MCP-1 promoter activity. Consistently, the overexpression of p110CAAX as well as insulin induced mRNA expression and nuclear expression of C/EBP-β and C/EBP-δ in VSMCs. These results clearly indicate that the activation of PI3K induced proinflammatory gene expression through activating C/EBP-β and C/EBP-δ but not NF-κB, which may explain the proinflammatory effect of insulin in the insulin-resistant state.

Tchobroutsky G. Eschwege E. Richards J.L. Claude J.R. Rosselin G.E. Int. J. Obes. 1988; 12: 557-565PubMed Google Scholar, 2Despres J.P. Lamarche B. Mauriege P. Cantin B. Dagenais G.R. Moorjani S.

It has been proposed that insulin may have an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis (4Stout R.W. Diabetes Care. 1990; 13: 631-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar), although the data from in vitro experiments show that insulin acts as both an anti-atherogenic and atherogenic hormone (5Scherrer U. Randin D. Vollenweider P. Vollenweider L. Nicod P. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2511-2515Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 6Stout R.W. Bierman E.L. Ross R. Circ. Res. 1975; 36: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Previously, we observed that the hyperinsulinemic state caused by high fructose diet induced the production of superoxide anion and decreased nitric oxide production, resulting in the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB and expression of its target genes in the cardiovascular tissues of rats (7Shinozaki K. Nishio Y. Okamura T. Yoshida Y. Maegawa H. Kojima H. Masada M. Toda N. Kikkawa R. Kashiwagi A. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 566-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The activation of NF-κB is reported to stimulate the expression of inflammatory genes found in atheromatous lesions such as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1)1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (8Landry D.B. Couper L.L. Bryant S.R. Lindner V. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 1085-1095PubMed Google Scholar, 9Bustos C. Hernandez-Presa M.A. Ortego M. Tunon J. Ortega L. Perez F. Diaz C. Hernandez G. Egido J. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 1998; 32: 2057-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Therefore, the activation of NF-κB in the vascular tissues in the hyperinsulinemic state may affect the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic lesions. Although the increased production of reactive oxygen species is one possible mechanism, how the hyperinsulinemic state activates the NF-κB in cardiovascular tissues is still unknown. In addition, recent clinical studies have shown that levels of C-reactive protein as well as fibrinogen, in vivo signs of inflammation, are elevated in patients with hyperinsulinemia (10Wu T. Dorn J.P. Donahue R.P. Sempos C.T. Trevisan M. Am. J. Epidemiol. 2002; 155: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), suggesting that inflammatory responses are also induced in the liver of hyperinsulinemic patients. Insulin activates both the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway in many insulin-sensitive tissues or cells (11White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we showed that, in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), insulin at 1–10 nm concentration preferentially activates the PI3K pathway rather than the MAPK pathway resulting in stimulated amino acid uptake but not thymidine incorporation into DNA (12Takagi Y. Kashiwagi A. Tanaka Y. Maegawa H. Shigeta Y. Atherosclerosis. 1995; 113: 19-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 13Obata T. Kashiwagi A. Maegawa H. Nishio Y. Ugi S. Hidaka H. Kikkawa R. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 1167-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the activation of PI3K does not directly stimulate cell proliferation at these insulin concentrations. Recently, it was reported that the activation of Akt, a serine/threonine kinase, downstream of the PI3K pathway stimulates the transcription factor NF-κB through the activation of inhibitor of kappa B (IκB) kinase in U293 cells (14Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1898) Google Scholar, 15Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1667) Google Scholar). Thus, insulin may stimulate NF-κB through activating PI3K and Akt and may play a role in the induction of proinflammatory gene expression and promotion of the inflammatory process in vascular tissues. Among the inflammatory processes found in an atheromatous lesion, the initial event is recruitment of monocytes to the lesion (16Ross R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (19270) Google Scholar). Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) plays a key role in the recruitment of monocytes (17Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 55: 97-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (2263) Google Scholar). In fact, strong expression of MCP-1 protein is observed in the human atherosclerotic lesion (18Takeya M. Yoshimura T. Leonard E.J. Takahashi K. Hum. Pathol. 1993; 24: 534-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) and the selective knock-out of CCR2, the receptor of MCP-1, prevents the initiation of the atherosclerotic process in vivo (19Boring L. Gosling J. Cleary M. Charo I.F. Nature. 1998; 394: 894-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar). Similar to other proinflammatory genes, the expression of MCP-1 is also regulated transcriptionally under the control of NF-κB in human and rat cells (20Ueda A. Ishigatsubo Y. Okubo T. Yoshimura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31092-31099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 21Wang Y. Rangan G.K. Goodwin B. Tay Y.C. Harris D.C. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 2011-2022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In the present study, to elucidate the role of the activation of PI3K in the inflammatory gene expression elicited through possible activation of NF-κB in VSMCs, we continuously increased the PI3K activity in cultured VSMCs using the recombinant adenovirus expressing membrane-targeted PI3K (p110CAAX). As previously reported (22Egawa K. Sharma P.M. Nakashima N. Huang Y. Huver E. Boss G.R. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14306-14314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), the specific activation of PI3K mimics insulin activation. This technique allows us to study the direct effect of the activation of PI3K on the gene expression in VSMCs and the mechanisms by which it regulates proinflammatory gene expression in VSMCs. Unexpectedly, our study showed that the continuous activation of PI3K by the overexpression of p110CAAX increased the MCP-1 gene expression without activating NF-κB in VSMCs. Here, we report the molecular mechanisms regulating MCP-1 gene expression in VSMCs by insulin or a direct activation of PI3K through activating CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins (C/EBPs) but not NF-κB. Porcine insulin was kindly provided by Eli Lilly & Co. (Indianapolis, IN). DMEM and FCS were purchased from Invitrogen (Grand Island, NY). Recombinant rat TNF-α was from Genzyme, Inc. (Cambridge, MA). Phospho-specific Akt antibody, phospho-specific glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) antibody, antibody to phospho-specific extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), phospho-specific p38 kinase antibody, and IκB-α antibody were from New England BioLabs, Inc.

All other reagents and chemicals were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Expression vectors of C/EBP-α, -β, and -δ were generous gifts of Dr. Steven L. McKnight. VSMCs were isolated from the aortas of male Sprague-Dawley rats (200–300 g) by enzymatic digestion, and they were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 80 units/ml penicillin G, and 80 μg/ml streptomycin in 100-mm plates (5 × 106 cells per dish) as described previously (13Obata T. Kashiwagi A. Maegawa H. Nishio Y. Ugi S. Hidaka H. Kikkawa R. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 1167-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Culture media were changed every third day, and VSMCs were used between the 4th and 15th passages. Cell growth was arrested for 16–48 h in DMEM supplemented with 1% FCS before the experiments. The Ad-E1A-transformed human embryonic kidney cell line U293 was cultured in DMEM high glucose medium containing 80 units/ml penicillin G, 80 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% FCS. VSMCs were infected at 50 m.o.i. for 1 h with stocks of either a control recombinant adenovirus (Ad5-LacZ) containing the cytomegalovirus promoter, pUC 18 polylinker, and a fragment of the SV40 genome, or the recombinant adenovirus Ad5-p110CAAX (22Egawa K.

Infected cells were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C in DMEM with 10% FCS, followed by incubation in the starvation medium required for the assay. The efficiency of adenovirus-mediated gene transfer was ∼90%, as measured by β-galactosidase staining. The survival of the VSMCs was unaffected by the incubation of cells with the different adenovirus constructs, because the total cell protein remained the same in infected or uninfected cells. VSMCs, infected with Ad5-p110CAAX or Ad5-LacZ, were starved for 16 h in DMEM with 1% FCS. The cells were stimulated with 1–100 nm insulin for 5–20 min at 37 °C and lysed in a solubilizing buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 140 mmNaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 units/ml aprotinin, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 50 mm NaF for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell lysates were centrifuged to remove insoluble materials. For Western blot analysis, whole-cell lysates (50 μg of protein per lane) were denatured by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mm DTT and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Gels were transferred to nitrocellulose by electroblotting in Towbin buffer containing 20% methanol. For immunoblotting, membranes were blocked and probed with the specified antibodies. Blots were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked second antibody followed by chemiluminescence detection, according to the manufacturer's (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) instructions. The Ad5-p110CAAX or Ad5-LacZ-infected cells were stimulated and lysed in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). After chloroform extraction, total RNA was isolated by isopropanol precipitation. Total RNA (30 μg) was denatured and electrophoresed on a 1% agarose-2% formaldehyde gel and blotted onto a Nytran N membrane. A 1.1-kb NcoI fragment of C/EBP-α, 0.4-kb NcoI fragment of C/EBP-β, or 1.0-kbEcoRI-BamHI fragment of C/EBP-δ was used as a probe. Full-length bovine p110α cDNA, 0.5-kb rat MCP-1 cDNA, 0.2-kb rat plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) cDNA, 0.8-kb rat tissue factor cDNA, and 1.0-kb rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming. Then the membrane was incubated with specific probes, washed, and visualized by autoradiography. All the quantitative data were corrected by the intensity of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA signals. Nuclear extracts were prepared from VSMCs according to the method described by Dignamet al. (23Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic extracts from VSMCs were used for measurement of IκB-α protein content by Western blot analysis. After protein concentrations were determined using Bio-Rad Protein Assay Reagent (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA), the nuclear extracts were divided into small aliquots, quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. For electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide probes for the two consensus sequences of NF-κB binding sites of rat MCP-1 gene promoter, −2291 bp to −2273 bp (5′-GTCTGGGAACTTCCAATGC-3′) (A site) and −2265 bp to −2250 bp (5′-GAATGGGAATTTCCAC-3′) (B site) were generated. The double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide probes for C/EBP were generated by annealing two complementary oligodeoxynucleotides corresponding to the nucleotide sequence spanning the 5′-flanking region of the rat MCP-1 gene, −2596 bp to −2572 bp (5′-TATGGCATTGACCAAAGTCCATGGG-3′) (A site) and −3123 bp to −3099 bp (5′-GTCGATGCTGACCAAACAATCATTG-3′) (B site). The NF-κB, activator protein (AP-1), and C/EBP probes were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4-polynucleotide kinase. Nuclear extracts (5 μg) were incubated with 1.0 × 105 cpm of the labeled NF-κB or C/EBP probe for 30 min at room temperature in a 20-μl binding buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmDTT, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 75 μg/ml of poly(dI-dC)/(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech., Buckinghamshire, UK). For competition, a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled probe was added to the nuclear extracts. Then, all reaction mixtures were analyzed by 6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 0.25× TBE (45 mmTris borate, 1 mm EDTA), and the gel was dried and visualized by autoradiography. The 5′-flanking region of rat MCP-1 from −3554 bp to +54 bp was amplified using rat genomic DNA by PCR with the sense primer, 5′-CTCAAAGGTGCTGCAGAGTTACTT-3′, and antisense primer, 5′-TGCATAGTGGTGGAGGAAGAGAGATCTGG-3′, as previously reported (21Wang Y. Rangan G.K. Goodwin B. Tay Y.C. Harris D.C. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 2011-2022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The resultant amplicon was gel-purified, inserted into pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Inc., Carlsbad, CA), digested withKpnI/BglII, and inserted intoKpnI/BglII-linearized pGL3-basic to form pGL3-MCP1 (MCP1–3.6 kb). The 2270-bp rat MCP-1 promoter region between −2217 bp and +54 bp was cloned by enzyme digestion withPvuII (MCP1–2.3 kb), and the 2581-bp rat MCP-1 promoter region between −2528 bp and +54 bp was cloned from MCP1–3.6 kb deleted with Exonuclease III and Mung Bean nuclease (Takara, Shiga, Japan) (MCP1–2.6 kb). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the putative NF-κB or C/EBP binding sites in the distal enhancer region of the MCP-1 3.6-kb plasmid using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Inc., La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The oligonucleotides 5′-CTGAAGGGTCTGGGAACTcggAATGCTGCCTC-3′ (lower-case and italic letters represent mutated nucleotides) and 5′-GCCTCAGAATGGccATTTCCACACTCTTATCC-3′ were used to obtain mutated NF-κB binding sites A and B (MCP1-NFκBMAB). The two putative C/EBP binding sites in the distal enhancer region were revealed by nucleotide sequence analysis and mutated using the oligonucleotides 5′-GGGAAGGTATGGCAgactagtcAGTCCATGGGCAG-3′ and 5′-GCCCAAAGTCGATGgactagtcACAATCATTGGAACC-3′ to form the C/EBP construct MCP1-CEBPMAB. Rat VSMCs were seeded on 12-well cell culture plates. After 24 h of incubation, the cells were 60–80% confluent. The VSMCs were cotransfected with 0.2 μg of luciferase expression plasmid and 0.05 μg of PRL-TK plasmid as normalization reference for transfection efficiency, and 0.75 μg of each expression plasmid using LipofectAMINE plus (Invitrogen, Rockville, MD) following the instructions for the reagent. After 48-h transfection, the cells were harvested. The Firefly andRenilla luciferase activities were determined by using a dual-luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega) with a signal detection duration of 30 s by a luminometer (Auto LUMIcounter Nu1422ES, Microtec, Tokyo, Japan). The cells were stained as described previously (24Nakamura T. Kishi A. Nishio Y. Maegawa H. Egawa K. Wong N.C. Kojima H. Fujimiya M. Arai R. Kashiwagi A. Kikkawa R. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 1795-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In brief, the cells were fixed for 2 h with 4% paraformaldehyde and washed for 2 days with PBS at 4 °C. Then the cells were incubated with antibodies against C/EBP-α, -β, and -γ diluted to 1:1000 in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X. The cells were further incubated with the species-specific secondary antibody conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate. The positive reaction was observed under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX70, Osaka, Japan), and the images were taken with a charge-coupled device camera (Cool SNAP/HQ, Nippon Roper Co., Osaka, Japan). The values are expressed as means ± S.E., unless otherwise stated. The Tukey-Welsch step-down multiple comparison test was used to determine the significance of any differences among more than four groups. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Insulin at 1–10 nm concentration significantly increased the mRNA content of MCP-1, a proinflammatory cytokine expressed in atherogenic lesions, by 1.3- to 1.4-fold compared with that in the cells without stimulation (Fig. 1, A andB). The effect of insulin on the MCP-1 gene expression was inhibited by 100 nm wortmannin, a PI3K inhibitor, indicating the involvement of PI3K in the induction of MCP-1 gene by insulin. VSMCs were infected with recombinant adenovirus expressing either the membrane-targeted p110CAAX or LacZ at 50 m.o.i. for 1 h, and mRNA expression of p110α was examined 48 h later. The mRNA band of the p110α was detected in the cells infected with Ad5-p110CAAX but not in cells infected with control adenovirus or cells without infection (Fig.2 A). To examine the activity of PI3K in the VSMCs overexpressing the membrane-targeted p110CAAX, the level of phosphorylation of Akt or GSK3, a serine/threonine kinase, downstream of PI3K was analyzed by Western blotting analysis with p-Akt (Ser-473) or p-GSK3 (Ser-9) antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the overexpression of membrane-targeted p110CAAX in VSMCs resulted in increases in the phosphorylation of both Akt and GSK3 to the level comparable with that of 100 nm insulin stimulation. Pretreatment with 1 μm wortmannin completely inhibited the phosphorylation induced by either p110CAAX expression or 100 nm insulin in VSMCs. As we previously reported (13Obata T. Kashiwagi A. Maegawa H. Nishio Y. Ugi S. Hidaka H. Kikkawa R. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 1167-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), in contrast to 100 nm angiotensin II, VSMCs incubated with 100 nminsulin for 10 min showed little phosphorylation of MAPKs such as ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK assessed by Western blot analysis. Consistent with these results, the overexpression of p110CAAX in VSMCs did not increase the phosphorylation of these MAPKs (Fig. 2 C). The effect of overexpression of p110CAAX on gene expression in VSMCs was investigated with Northern blot analysis. MCP-1 was induced at 10- to 15-fold of the control levels after the overexpression of p110CAAX (Fig. 2 D). The induction of the gene by the overexpression of p110CAAX in VSMCs was dose-dependent (Fig.2 E). However, neither PAI-1 nor tissue factor mRNAs were induced by the overexpression of p110CAAX in VSMCs (Fig.2 F), indicating the specificity of MCP-1 gene expression by p110CAAX. To confirm the increased MCP-1 gene expression through either NF-κB or AP-1 activation, we examined the binding activity of NF-κB and AP-1 in VSMCs overexpressed with p110CAAX using EMSA. As shown in Fig.3 (A–C), in contrast to the results of TNF-α or PMA stimulation, the overexpression of p110CAAX in VSMCs activated neither NF-κB nor AP-1 in VSMCs. NF-κB activity is regulated by the proteasomal degradation of IκB protein in the cytosol. Therefore, the protein level of IκB-α in cytoplasmic extracts was determined by Western blot analysis. The IκB-α content was reduced at 30 min after TNF-α (10 ng/ml) stimulation. However, the overexpression of p110CAAX did not reduce the protein content of IκB-α (Fig. 3 D). To investigate the mechanism for the induction of the MCP-1 gene expression by the overexpression of p110CAAX in VSMCs, functional promoter analysis was performed by transfecting a luciferase transporter plasmid (pGL3) carrying the upstream 3.6 kb of the MCP-1 gene (Fig. 4 A). As shown in Fig. 4 B, the overexpression of p110CAAX in VSMCs increased the MCP-1 promoter-driven luciferase activity by 2.9-fold compared with the cells infected with control plasmid (p < 0.01). It has been reported that two NF-κB binding elements located between 2.3 and 2.6 kb upstream of the MCP-1 gene have a functional role for TNF-α or other cytokines of up-regulating the transcriptional activity (21Wang Y. Rangan G.K. Goodwin B. Tay Y.C. Harris D.C. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 2011-2022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, significant reduction (p < 0.01) of the luciferase activity was observed when the upstream region of the MCP-1 gene was deleted to 2.6 kb, in which the NF-κB binding elements exist. Further deletion up to 2.3 kb did not further decrease the p110CAAX-induced luciferase activity (Fig. 4 B). In addition, the induction of luciferase activity by the overexpression of p110CAAX in VSMCs was not affected by the mutation of NF-κB binding elements (Fig. 4 B). To identify the cis-element regulating the MCP-1 promoter activity in response to the overexpression of p110CAAX in VSMCs, we searched the nucleotide sequence in the region between 2.6 and 3.6 kb upstream of the MCP-1 gene using a transcriptional factor data base (TFSEARCH: www.cbrc.jp/research/db/TFSEARCH.html) and examined whether the site was activated by continuous activation of PI3K using EMSA. We identified two binding sites for CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) in this region (Fig.5 A) and found that the binding of C/EBP was up-regulated by the overexpression of p110CAAX in VSMCs (Fig. 5, B and C). Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 5 (D and E), the mutation of these C/EBP binding elements significantly decreased the p110CAAX-induced luciferase activity (p < 0.01) in VSMCs. To estimate whether C/EBPs are capable of stimulating the MCP-1 promoter activity, we transiently cotransfected the expression plasmid containing cDNA of either C/EBP-α, C/EBP-β, or C/EBP-δ with luciferase transporter plasmid (pGL3) carrying the upstream 3.6 kb of the MCP-1 gene. As shown in Fig.6, the overexpression of C/EBP-β or C/EBP-δ in VSMCs increased luciferase activity by 6- to 7-fold (p < 0.01) of that of the control cells, whereas C/EBP-α did not significantly increase the promoter activity. The overexpression of p110CAAX in VSMCs increased mRNA expression of C/EBP-β by 1.6-fold (p < 0.05) and C/EBP-δ by 2.6-fold (p < 0.01) as compared with that in cells infected with control virus but did not change C/EBP-α expression (Fig. 7, A–C). Additionally, the protein levels of C/EBP-β and C/EBP-δ were increased in the nuclear extract of VSMCs with overexpressed p110CAAX as compared with the cells infected with control virus, by 2-fold (p < 0.01) and by 1.7-fold (p < 0.01), respectively (Fig. 8,A–C). These results were also confirmed by immunocytochemical staining of the VSMCs with either C/EBP-α, C/EBP-β, or C/EBP-δ. The overexpression of p110CAAX increased the nuclear expression of C/EBP-β and C/EBP-δ but not C/EBP-α (Fig.9, A–C).Figure 8Overexpression of p110CAAX induces nuclear expression of C/EBPs in VSMCs. A–C, VSMCs were infected with recombinant adenovirus expressing either the membrane-targeted p110CAAX or LacZ at 50 m.o.i. for 1 h. The infected cells were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C in DMEM with 10% FCS, followed by incubation in the starvation medium for 16 h.

As shown in Fig. 10, stimulation with 1–10 nm insulin dose-dependently increased the nuclear protein level of C/EBP-β by 1.3- to 1.4-fold and C/EBP-δ by 1.6- to 2.0-fold over the basal level but did not affect C/EBP-α. In the present study, we found that the overexpression of p110CAAX in VSMCs activated the downstream of the PI3K signal pathway, such as Akt and GSK3, but not MAPKs. The specific and chronic activation of PI3K by the overexpression of p110CAAX as well as the stimulation with a near physiological dose of insulin induced gene expression of a proinflammatory cytokine, MCP-1, in VSMCs through increasing the nuclear expression of C/EBP-β and C/EBP-δ. These observations may provide a new concept for the pathophysiological role of PI3K activation for the enhancement of proinflammatory gene expression observed in the development of atheromatous lesions. Although atherosclerosis has been considered to be the accumulation of lipids within the arterial wall, it has recently been emphasized that a series of inflammatory processes is involved in the development of the atherosclerotic lesion and the onset of acute coronary syndromes (25Libby P. Am. J. Cardiol. 2001; 88: 3J-6JPubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The initial step of the process is recruitment of monocytes to the lesion. In this process, the cytokine MCP-1 is thought to play a major role. Actually, in human atheromatous lesions, strong expression of MCP-1 is observed (18Takeya M. Yoshimura T. Leonard E.J. Takahashi K. Hum. Pathol. 1993; 24: 534-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The induction of MCP-1 is one of the inflammatory responses regulated by many factors, including proinflammatory cytokines, hormones, lipopolysaccharide, and modified lipids (26Chen X.L. Tummala P.E. Olbrych M.T. Alexander R.W."
https://openalex.org/W2022279792,"arv1Δ mutant cells have an altered sterol distribution within cell membranes (Tinkelenberg, A.H., Liu, Y., Alcantara, F., Khan, S., Guo, Z., Bard, M., and Sturley, S. L. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 40667–40670), and thus it has been suggested that Arv1p may be involved in the trafficking of sterol in the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae and also in humans. Here we present data showing that arv1Δ mutants also harbor defects in sphingolipid metabolism. [3H]inositol and [3H]dihydrosphingosine radiolabeling studies demonstrated that mutant cells had reduced rates of biosynthesis and lower steady-state levels of complex sphingolipids while accumulating certain hydroxylated ceramide species. Phospholipid radiolabeling studies showed that arv1Δ cells harbored defects in the rates of biosynthesis and steady-state levels of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylglycerol. Neutral lipid radiolabeling studies indicated that the rate of biosynthesis and steady-state levels of sterol ester were increased in arv1Δ cells. Moreover, these same studies demonstrated that arv1Δ cells had decreased rates of biosynthesis and steady-state levels of total fatty acid and fatty acid alcohols. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analyses examining different fatty acid species showed thatarv1Δ cells had decreased levels of C18:1 fatty acid. Additional gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analyses determining the levels of various molecular sterol species in arv1Δcells showed that mutant cells accumulated early sterol intermediates. Using fluorescence microscopy we found that GFP-Arv1p localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi. Interestingly, the heterologous expression of the human ARV1 cDNA suppressed the sphingolipid metabolic defects of arv1Δ cells. We hypothesize that in eukaryotic cells, Arv1p functions in the sphingolipid metabolic pathway perhaps as a transporter of ceramides between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi. arv1Δ mutant cells have an altered sterol distribution within cell membranes (Tinkelenberg, A.H., Liu, Y., Alcantara, F., Khan, S., Guo, Z., Bard, M., and Sturley, S.

Ceramide serves as the backbone for all complex sphingolipids, and its biosynthesis is the point where animal and fungal sphingolipid biosynthesis begin to diverge (11Dickson R.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 27-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In higher eukaryotes, there are over three hundred different types of complex sphingolipids found in membranes (1Hannun Y.A. Bell R.M. Science. 1989; 243: 500-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar), whereas in the yeast S. cerevisiaethere are three, inositolphosphorylceramide (IPC),1 mannose inositolphosphorylceramide (MIPC), and mannose diinositolphosphorylceramide (MIP2C). However, IPC, MIPC, and MIP2C lipids can differ in their hydroxylation state, giving rise to fifteen possible complex sphingolipids (11Dickson R.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 27-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The accumulation of free cholesterol in animal cells causes toxicity (12Bischoff F. Bryson G. Adv. Lipid Res. 1977; 15: 61-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One mechanism by which cells relieve this toxic effect is through the use of the membrane-associated SREBP transcription factors, which precisely regulate the genes that are required for sterol biosynthesis and LDL receptor expression (13Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar, 14Nohturfft A. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol.

Others have shown that animal cells regulate sphingolipid metabolism in response to subtle and transient changes in cholesterol (16Storey M.K. Byers D.M. Cook H.W. Ridgway N.D. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 246-257Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 17Ridgway N.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1484: 129-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). InS. cerevisiae, sphingolipid metabolism appears to be coordinately regulated with phospholipid and sterol metabolism (18Wu W.I. McDonough V.M. Nickels J.T., Jr., Ko, J. Fischl A.S. Vales T.R. Merrill A.H.J. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13171-13178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The fact that multiple mechanisms monitor and coordinately regulate sterol and sphingolipid metabolism points to a tight association between cholesterol and sphingolipid levels and cell viability. This is underscored through studies showing that improper trafficking of sterol and sphingolipid causes diseases such as the Niemann-Pick disorders (19Ory D.S. Biochim. Biophys.

Like higher eukaryotes, yeast can esterify sterol through the activities of the endoplasmic reticulum-associated Are1p and Are2p ASAT enzymes (24Yang H. Bard M. Bruner D.A. Gleeson A. Deckelbaum R.J.

However, sterol esterification in yeast is not essential asare1Δ are2Δ double mutants are viable (24Yang H. Bard M. Bruner D.A. Gleeson A. Deckelbaum R.J. Aljinovic G. Pohl T.M. Rothstein R.

Thus, ARV1 function is essential when yeast are unable to esterify sterol. Work from these same investigators suggested that arv1Δ cells have defects in sterol homeostasis and altered intracellular sterol distribution (26Tinkelenberg A.H. Liu Y. Alcantara F. Khan S. Guo Z.

Interestingly, ARV1 orthologs have been found in humans, worm, and plants, suggesting a possible conservation of function within these different gene products. We recently isolated the ts erg26–1 strain in a genetic screen that was designed to isolate yeast mutants defective in sphingolipid metabolism (27Baudry K. Swain E. Rahier A. Germann M. Batta A.

We showed that erg26–1 cells had sphingolipid metabolic defects and that blocking sterol biosynthesis inS. cerevisiae caused changes in sphingolipid metabolism (31Swain E. Baudry K. Stukey J. McDonough V. Germann M. Nickels Jr., J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26177-26184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These results further substantiate that yeast have mechanisms that are designed to coordinately regulate sphingolipid metabolism in response to changes in sterol levels. Interestingly, mutations in ARV1 were isolated in the same genetic screen. Thus, we explored the possibility that genes known to be required for the regulation of intracellular sterol homeostasis might regulate sphingolipid levels. Here, we present our data regarding the role of the ARV1 gene in regulating sphingolipid biosynthesis and metabolism. The yeast strains used in this study are derived from W303–1A (MATaleu2–3, 112 trp1–1 ura3–1 his3–11, 15 ade2 can1–100). An arv1Δ::KAN haploid null strain was used for all of the experiments and is abbreviated asarv1Δ. Yeast strains were grown in either YEPD (1% yeast extract, 2% bacto-peptone, 2% glucose) or in synthetic minimal media containing 0.67% Yeast Nitrogen Base (Difco) supplemented with the appropriate amino acids and adenine. Yeast transformations were performed using the procedure described by Ito et al. (32Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For routine propagation of plasmids, Escherichia coli XL1Blue cells were used and grown in Luria broth medium supplemented with ampicillin (200 μg/ml). Yeast null mutants were generated by the one-step disruption method of Rothstein (33Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 20-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (3417) Google Scholar) using theKanMX cassette (34Longtine M.S. McKenzie A.R. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4172) Google Scholar). phARV1 was used for the overexpression studies of human ARV1 (26Tinkelenberg A.H. Liu Y. Alcantara F. Khan S. Guo Z. Bard M. Sturley S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40667-44070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The plasmids pCB74-GFP-ARV1, pCB74-GFP-SEC21, and pCB74-GFP-YPT1, were constructed by subcloningARV1, SEC21, and YPT1 into the vector pCB74, respectively. pCB74 allows for the construction of an amino-terminal GFP fusion and contains the GFP sequence under the constitutive GPD promoter (35Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Gene. 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar). The plasmid pGAL-GFP-SUR4 contains the SUR4 sequence subcloned as an amino-terminal fusion with the GFP sequence. Expression of GFP-Sur4p is galactose-inducible and is driven by theGAL4 promoter sequence. Sequences subcloned into vectors were obtained by PCR amplification using the high fidelitypfu polymerase. All DNA sequences generated by PCR were sequenced and compared with the yeast genome data base. Starting cultures for all lipid radiolabeling experiments were grown overnight at 27 °C to exponential phase in synthetic complete media or selective minimal media. OD600 were then taken and cultures were diluted to 5 × 106 cells/ml and pre-incubated at 27 and 37 °C for 2 h before radiolabeling. Radiolabeled lipids were resolved by TLC and visualized by autoradiography (Kodak XAR5). The percent value of each lipid species was determined by densitometry using Bio-Rad Model GS-670 Imaging Densitometer and Molecular Analyst Software Version 1.4.1. For pulse radiolabeling of complex sphingolipids, cultures were incubated with 5 μCi/ml [3H]myo-inositol for 30 min. For steady-state labeling, cultures were incubated with 1μCi/ml [3H]myo-inositol for 5 h. Radiolabeled sphingolipids were extracted with ethanol, water, diethyl ether, pyridine, 4.2 n ammonium hydroxide (15:15:5:1:0.018), treated with methylamine as described (36Clarke N.G. Dawson R.M. Biochem. J. 1981; 195: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), and analyzed by one-dimensional TLC using chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (16:6:4:1.6). For pulse radiolabeling of ceramides, cultures were incubated with 5 μCi/ml [3H]dihydrosphingosine for 20 min. For steady-state radiolabeling, cultures were incubated with 5 μCi/ml [3H]dihydrosphingosine for 30 min, pelleted and washed in media lacking radiolabel, and chased for an additional 3 h. To help resolve the various ceramides species, wild type cultures were incubated in the absence and presence of 140 μm fumonisin B1. Radiolabeled ceramides were extracted with ethanol, water, diethyl ether, pyridine, 4.2 n ammonium hydroxide (15:15:5:1:0.018) and analyzed by one-dimensional TLC using chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (95:4.5:0.5) (37Haak D. Gable K. Beeler T. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29704-29710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). For pulse labeling of phospholipids, cultures were incubated with 50 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for 20 min. For steady-state radiolabeling, cultures were incubated with 25 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for several generations. Radiolabeled phospholipids were extracted using the spheroplast method of Atkinsonet al. (38Atkinson K. Fogel S. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6653-6661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and analyzed by one-dimensional TLC as described previously (39Kinney A.J. Bae-Lee M. Panghaal S.S. Kelley M.J. Gaynor P.M. Carman G. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1133-1136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Neutral lipid radiolabeling and TLC analysis was performed as described previously (39Kinney A.J. Bae-Lee M. Panghaal S.S. Kelley M.J. Gaynor P.M. Carman G. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1133-1136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The rates of biosynthesis and steady-state levels of neutral lipids were determined by densitometry. To analyze total fatty acids, cells were cultured at 27 °C to a density of ∼1 × 107 cells/ml. Cells were then harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in an equivalent volume of fresh media prewarmed at 27 or 37 °C. Incubation of all cultures continued for three additional hours at the indicated temperatures. Cells were harvested again and washed with sterile water to remove residual media. Washed cells were divided and used for fatty acid analysis (1/5-cell volume) or sterol analysis (4/5-cell volume; see below). Fatty acid methyl esters were prepared by HCl-methanolysis of whole cell lipids (40Browse J. McCourt P.J. Somerville C.R. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 152: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Samples of fatty acid methyl esters were analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography on a Hewlett-Packard model 6890 gas chromatograph using a 30-m HP-5 column. Identification of cellular fatty acid species was by comparison of retention times to those of standard compounds and by GC/MS analysis using data base files of fatty acid methyl ester spectra. GC/MS analysis was performed on a Hewlett-Packard model 6890 gas chromatograph and Hewlett-Packard model 5973 Mass Selective Detector. Cells were grown under the conditions used for fatty acid analysis. Sterols were extracted as part of the non-saponifiable fraction essentially as described (41Zweytick D. Hrastnik C. Kohlwein S.D. Daum G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Washed cells were resuspended in 1.5 ml of methanol, 1.0 ml of 60% potassium hydroxide, and 1.0 ml of 0.5% pyrogallol and heated for 2 h at 85 °C. The non-saponified material was extracted two times with petroleum ether/hexane (1:1). Cholesterol (20 μl of 0.5 mg/ml stock) was added to each sample for use as an internal standard. Samples were dried down under nitrogen and resuspended in 200 μl of a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of pyridine/bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide, 1% trimethylchlorosilane for trimethylsilylation (TMS) of free hydroxyl groups (42Phillips K.M. Ruggio D.M. Bailey J.A. J. Chromatogr. B. Biomed. Sci. Appl. 1999; 732: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 43Chambaz E. Horning E. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 30: 7-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Each TMS treatment extract was diluted by addition of 0.5 ml petroleum ether/hexane (1:1) and passed over a silica gel mini-column that was pretreated with hexane/petroleum ether (1:1, v/v) (44Lechner M. Reiter B. Lorbeer E. J. Chromatogr. A. 1999; 857: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Sterols were eluted with hexane/ethyl acetate (1:1, v/v). The pooled flow-through and eluant fractions were dried down under nitrogen and resuspended in 200 μl cyclohexane/dichloromethane (1:1, v/v). Sterol samples were analyzed by gas chromatography on a Hewlett-Packard model 6890 gas chromatograph using a 30-m HP-5 column. Standard instrument conditions were as follows: injection port temperature, 250 °C; detector temperature, 300 °C; and initial oven temperature, 250 °C. After a 30-min hold at 250 °C, the oven temperature was increased at 2 °C/min up to 280 °C, held for 15 min, and then increased at 5 °C/min to 310 °C and held for 5 min. Cellular sterol species were identified by comparison of peak position retention times to those of standard compounds (ergosterol, lanosterol, cholesterol (internal standard), and squalene) and/or relative to the cholesterol internal standard peak position (45Patterson G.W. Anal. Chem. 1971; 43: 1165-1170Crossref Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 46Nes W.D., Xu, S.H. Haddon W.F. Steroids. 1989; 53: 533-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 47Xu S.H. Norton R.A. Crumley F.G. Nes W.D. J. Chromatogr. 1988; 452: 377-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and by GC/MS analysis using data base files of sterol spectra. GC/MS analysis was performed on a Hewlett-Packard model 6890 gas chromatograph equipped with a HP-5MS capillary column and Hewlett-Packard model 5973 Mass Selective Detector. GC/MS run conditions were essentially the same as that described above for analysis of sterols by gas-liquid chromatography. Arv1p is essential at high temperatures, thus arv1Δ null cells are inviable at 37 °C (26Tinkelenberg A.H. Liu Y. Alcantara F. Khan S. Guo Z. Bard M. Sturley S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40667-44070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To ascertain whether Arv1p functions in regulating sphingolipid metabolism, we examined the rates of biosynthesis and steady-state levels of sphingolipids inarv1Δ cells grown at 27° (permissive temperature) and 37 °C (restrictive temperature). The results of these studies are shown in Fig. 2. Using [H3]inositol radiolabeling, we found that mutant cells had defects in the rates of biosynthesis of all complex sphingolipids (Fig. 1, Pulse). Furthermore, sphingolipid biosynthetic defects in arv1Δ cells were observed at both the permissive and restrictive growth temperatures (Fig. 2, Pulse, 27versus 37 °C). We were unable to determine definitively what sphingolipid species corresponded to a particular TLC spot in arv1Δ cells using direct visual analysis. We circumvented this problem by analyzing the sphingolipid composition of the combinatorial strains, arv1Δ sur2Δ, arv1Δ scs7Δ, arv1Δ ccc2Δ,arv1Δ csg2Δ, and arv1Δ ipt1Δ, by TLC (not shown) and comparing these results to what we observed forarv1Δ cells. We found that at the permissive temperature, arv1Δ cells synthesized very low levels of IPC-B (inositolphosphorylceramide-B species) and IPC-D when compared with wild type cells (Fig. 2,Pulse, 27 °C). The biosynthetic rates of these IPC species were 8.0- and 6.4-fold lower, respectively. The defect in IPC-C biosynthesis was even more severe, as we could not detect any biosynthesis of this sphingolipid in arv1Δ cells within the time of our assay (Fig. 2, Pulse, 27 °C). Furthermore, arv1Δ cells were also defective in synthesizing MIPC (3.7-fold) and MIP2C (3.4-fold) at the permissive temperature (Fig. 2, Pulse, 27 °C). Interestingly, we found that arv1Δ cells grown at the permissive temperature synthesized lysophosphatidylinositol (LysoPI) at a higher rate than wild type cells (Fig. 2,Pulse,27 °C). From these results we conclude that ARV1 function is required for proper sphingolipid synthesis even under conditions where its function is not required for cell viability. We next examined the rate of sphingolipid biosynthesis inarv1Δ cells grown at the restrictive temperature for growth. Strikingly, any biosynthesis of complex sphingolipids seen inarv1Δ cells at the permissive temperature was almost completely absent when these cells were shifted to the restrictive growth temperature (Fig. 2, Pulse,37 °C). We could detect only a very low level of IPC-B biosynthesis, but its rate of production in arv1Δ cells was nearly 20-fold lower than that seen in wild type cells (Fig. 2, Pulse,37 °C). We did not detect any biosynthesis of IPC-C, IPC-D, MIPC, or MIP2C. When we examined steady-state sphingolipid composition, we found that arv1Δ cells were unable to sustain normal levels of sphingolipid (Fig. 2,Steady-State). At the permissive temperature, mutant cells had higher than wild type levels of IPC-B (2.1-fold) while having lower levels of IPC-C (6.3-fold), IPC-D (5.2-fold), and MIPC (3.7-fold) (Fig.2, Steady-State,27 °C). MIP2C steady-state levels were similar in arv1Δ and wild type cells. Furthermore, these defects in IPCs and MIPC levels persisted in temperature-shifted arv1Δ cells (Fig. 2,Steady-State,37 °C). IPC-C (3.1-fold), IPC-D (5.0-fold), and MIPC (3.2-fold) levels were all reduced when compared with wild type cells grown at the restrictive temperature (Fig. 2,Steady-State, 37 °C). In contrast to our results at the permissive temperature, arv1Δ cells had a lower than wild type steady-state level of MIP2C (6.8-fold) at the restrictive growth temperature. Based on all the data presented above, we suggest that ARV1 may function to regulate the biosynthesis and/or metabolism of sphingolipid in yeast. All complex sphingolipids in yeast are derived from ceramide (25Daum G. Lees N.D. Bard M. Dickson R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1471-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae contains five different forms of ceramide that are designated as ceramide-A, ceramide-B, ceramide-B′, ceramide-C, and ceramide-D, all of which vary in their degree of hydroxylation (Fig.1). Dihydrosphingosine is the precursor for ceramide A, which in turn is the precursor for ceramide-B′, whereas phytosphingosine is the precursor for ceramide-B, which is the precursor for ceramide-C, ceramide-D, IPC-B, IPC-C, and IPC-D. To further define howARV1 might function to regulate sphingolipid biosynthesis and metabolism, we determined the rates of biosynthesis and steady-state levels of the various ceramides in arv1Δ and wild type cells using [3H]dihydrosphingosine radiolabeling and TLC (37Haak D. Gable K. Beeler T. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29704-29710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that the rates of biosynthesis of all the major ceramides in arv1Δ cells were similar to those seen in wild type cells when assayed at either the permissive or restrictive temperature (Fig. 3, A andB). In addition, arv1Δ cells were also able to sustain normal steady-state levels of dihydrosphingosine-derived ceramides, ceramide-A and ceramide-B′ (Fig. 3 C). On the other hand, arv1Δ cells accumulated the phytosphingosine-derived ceramide-B and ceramide-C at both the permissive and restrictive growth temperatures (Fig. 3, Cand D). Ceramide-B and -C steady-state levels inarv1Δ cells were 285 and 198% higher than that seen in wild type cells, respectively (Fig. 3, C andD). We reasoned that ceramide accumulation in arv1Δ cells might be caused by decreases in the activities of either the Aur1p inositolphosphorylceramide synthase enzyme (48Nagiec M.M. Nagiec E.E.

This is not the case, however, because the specific activities of these enzymes in cell extracts fromarv1Δ and wild type cells were similar when assayed at both temperatures (not shown). To further analyze the specificity and function ofARV1 in regulating lipid metabolism, we examined the biosynthesis and metabolism of phospholipid in arv1Δ and wild type cells. We found that under conditions where ARV1function was not necessary for arv1Δ cell growth (permissive temperature), phospholipid biosynthesis in mutant cells was similar to that seen in wild type cells (Fig.4 A, black bars versus white bars). However, when we examined phospholipid biosynthesis at the restrictive growth temperature whereARV1 function is required for viability, changes were evident in the rates of biosynthesis of PE, PS, and PG inarv1Δ cells (Fig. 4 B). The rates of biosynthesis of PE and PS in mutant cells were reduced 1.5- and 2.1-fold, respectively, whereas PG biosynthesis was increased 2.4-fold. The rates of biosynthesis of PC, PI, PA, and CL were similar to"

However, the role of cyclin D1 in liver development remains unknown. Here we show that the expression of D-type cyclins including cyclin D1, D2, and D3 is down-regulated along with liver development. In addition, oncostatin M (OSM), an interleukin-6 family cytokine, down-regulated the expression of cyclin D1 and D2 in a primary culture of fetal hepatocytes in which OSM induces hepatic differentiation. Ectopic expression of receptor mutants defective in the activation of either STAT3 or SHP-2/Ras indicated that the down-regulation of D1 and D2 cyclins by OSM was mediated by STAT3 but not by SHP-2/Ras. Consistently, expression of dominant negative STAT3 but not Ras relieved OSM-induced suppression of cyclin D expression. Activation of STAT3 in fetal hepatocytes of transgenic mice expressing the STAT3-estrogen receptor fusion protein by 4-hydroxytamoxifen resulted in the suppression of cyclin D1 and D2 expression. These results indicate that STAT3 activation is necessary and sufficient for down-regulation of D1 and D2 cyclins in fetal hepatocytes. Furthermore, STAT3-C, a constitutively active form of STAT3, suppressed transcription of the cyclin D1 promoter in fetal hepatocytes, whereas it activated the transcription in hepatic tumor cells, huH7 and HepG2. Thus, STAT3-mediated down-regulation of cyclin D expression is rather specific to fetal hepatocytes that are undergoing maturation processes including a reduction of their proliferation potential.

These IL-6 family cytokines manifest their functions through receptors that consist of a ligand-specific subunit(s) and the common signal transducer, gp130 (22Hirano T. Nakajima K. Hibi M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 241-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Binding of a ligand to its cognate receptor induces activation of Janus kinases that are bound to the receptor, leading to phosphorylation of the docking sites in the receptor for SHP-2 and STAT3. Following the recruitment of signaling molecules, SHP-2 transmits the signal to the Ras-MAPK cascade and phosphorylated STAT3 forms a dimer and is translocated to the nucleus where it regulates gene expression by binding to its target sequences (22Hirano T. Nakajima K. Hibi M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 241-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Studies using receptor mutants and dominant negative mutants of signaling molecules have demonstrated that STAT3 is a key regulator of IL-6 function, such as macrophage differentiation and acute phase responses (22Hirano T. Nakajima K. Hibi M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 241-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 23Taga T. Kishimoto T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 797-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). In addition, it was shown that IL-6 induces apoptosis in 1A9-M cells (17Oritani K. Tomiyama Y. Kincade P.W. Aoyama K. Yokota T. Matsumura I. Kanakura Y. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Matsuzawa Y.

The proliferation and differentiation of hepatocytes are regulated by various external signals, such as hormones, cytokines, extracellular matrix, and cell-cell contacts. Glucocorticoid modulates the proliferation and function of hepatocytes in vivo andin vitro and transforming growth factor-β is a potent inhibitor of hepatic growth (26Nakamura T. Tomita Y. Hirai R.

Cell Res. 1992; 202: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). IL-6 family cytokines are involved in the development, function, and regeneration of the liver. For example, IL-6-deficient mice exhibit defects in liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy and CCl4 liver injury (28Cressman D.E. Greenbaum L.E. DeAngelis R.A. Ciliberto G. Furth E.E. Poli V. Taub R. Science. 1996; 274: 1379-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). While the liver is apparently normal in gp130-deficient mice at the time of birth when mutant mice die, gp130-deficient liver exhibits metabolic defects such as a limited accumulation of glycogen and decreased expression of enzymes for metabolism (20Kamiya A. Kinoshita T. Ito Y. Matsui T. Morikawa Y. Senba E. Nakashima K. Taga T. Yoshida K. Kishimoto T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2127-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). OSM is a paracrine factor produced by hematopoietic cells in fetal liver and induces differentiation of fetal hepatocytes (20Kamiya A. Kinoshita T. Ito Y. Matsui T. Morikawa Y. Senba E. Nakashima K. Taga T. Yoshida K. Kishimoto T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2127-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). By using a primary culture of fetal hepatocytes derived from murine embryos at embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5), it was demonstrated that STAT3 and K-Ras mediate the OSM signaling for functional maturation of fetal hepatocytes into neonatal liver cells and morphological changes including the formation of E-cadherin-based adherens junctions, respectively (29Ito Y. Matsui T. Kamiya A. Kinoshita T. Miyajima A. Hepatology. 2000; 32: 1370-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 30Matsui T. Kinoshita T. Morikawa Y. Tohya K. Katsuki M. Ito Y. Kamiya A. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1021-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Differentiated hepatocytes in adult liver are quiescent and exhibit various metabolic functions; however, liver injury induces proliferation of hepatocytes at the expense of metabolic functions. Most hepatocellular carcinomas actively proliferate, but they lose many functions of mature hepatocytes, indicating that they are de-differentiated by transformation. Consistently, fetal hepatocytes proliferate vigorously but lack most mature liver functions. Thus, the proliferation and function of hepatocytes are inversely related. Consistent with these observations, evidence is accumulating that the proliferation of hepatocytes is correlated with the expression of D-type cyclins, particularly cyclin D1. The expression of cyclin D1 is up-regulated at the initial phase of liver regeneration induced by partial hepatectomy and CCl4 (31Albrecht J.H., Hu, M.Y. Cerra F.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 648-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar,32Fausto N. J. Hepatol. 2000; 32: 19-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, amplification of the cyclin D1 gene is found in 13% of hepatocellular carcinomas (33Joo M. Kang Y.K. Kim M.R. Lee H.K. Jang J.J. Liver. 2001; 21: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the regulation of cyclin D1 expression is critical for the proliferation and differentiation of hepatocytes. However, the regulation of cyclin D expression in liver development remains unexplored. In this study, we investigated the mechanism underlying the regulation of D-type cyclins during liver development. The expression of D-type cyclins was down-regulated along with liver development in vivo, and OSM suppressed the expression of cyclin D1 and D2 in fetal hepatocytes in vitro. We provide evidence that this negative regulation is specific to fetal hepatocytes and is mediated by STAT3 but not Ras. Fetal livers were isolated from E14.5 embryos of C57BL/6CrSlc mice or STAT3ER chimeric mice. Isolated livers were dissociated with a collagenase-based dissociation buffer (liver digest medium, Invitrogen) followed by hemolysis with a hypotonic buffer as described previously (20Kamiya A. Kinoshita T. Ito Y. Matsui T. Morikawa Y. Senba E. Nakashima K. Taga T. Yoshida K. Kishimoto T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2127-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Dissociated cells were inoculated at a density of 2 × 104 cells/cm2 in 0.1% gelatin-coated dishes (Costar) and then cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 2 mml-glutamine, minimum Eagle's medium non-essential amino acid solution (Invitrogen), insulin-transferrin-selenium X (Invitrogen), and 10−7m dexamethasone (Sigma). After 4 h of inoculation, the cells were washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline to remove hematopoietic cells and cell debris. Culture media were changed every 2 days. Hepatic cell lines, huH7, huH2.2, and HepG2, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Total RNA from E12.5, E14.5, neonatal or adult liver, and cultured cells was extracted with Trizol solution (Invitrogen). A 10-μg aliquot of total RNA was separated on a 1.2% agarose gel containing 2% formaldehyde and transferred onto a positively charged nylon membrane. After UV cross-linking, the membrane was hybridized with digoxigenin-labeling probes (cyclin D1, cyclin D2, cyclin D3, tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT), tryptophan oxygenase, or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase). The blot was treated with anti-digoxigenin antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase and then developed with CDP-Star (New England BioLabs). The EcoRI-XbaI cDNA fragments encoding G-CSFR-G133, G-CSFR-G133F2, G-CSFR-G133F3, and G-CSFR-G133F2/3 were inserted into the retroviral vector pMXII. The pMX-IRES/GFP (pMIG) retroviral vectors carrying cDNAs for ΔSTAT3, ΔSTAT5, RasV12, and RasN17 were constructed previously (34Chida D. Miura O. Yoshimura A. Miyajima A. Blood. 1999; 93: 1567-1578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression vector pME18S/STAT3-C was constructed by inserting the NotI-ApaI fragment of STAT3-C (a gift from Dr. J. F. Bromberg) (35Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgan G. Zhao Y. Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1999; 98: 295-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2517) Google Scholar). The integrity of these vectors was determined by sequencing and by digestion with restriction enzymes. The retroviral vectors were transfected into the retrovirus-packaging cell line (BOSC23 cells) by lipofection as described previously (29Ito Y. Matsui T. Kamiya A. Kinoshita T. Miyajima A. Hepatology. 2000; 32: 1370-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 36Kitamura T. Onishi M. Kinoshita S. Shibuya A. Miyajima A. Nolan G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9146-9150Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). After 48 h of culture, the virus particles were enriched by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 16 h at 4 °C. Pellets of the particles were resuspended in culture medium for fetal hepatocytes, and then the suspension was filtered through a 0.45-μm filter. Fetal hepatocytes were incubated with the viral solution for 2 days, and then the medium was changed to hepatocyte culture medium. Cultured hepatocytes were lysed in cell lysis buffer (25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mmNa3VO4, leupeptin, Pefa-block, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40). Ten micrograms of total cell lysate were used for SDS-PAGE, and proteins were then transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). The membrane was incubated with primary antibodies at room temperature for 2 h and washed with TBS-T (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20). It was then incubated with anti-mouse or rat IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) at room temperature for 1 h, and the immune complex was visualized with the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Fetal hepatocytes were transfected with pME18S/STAT3-C and the reporter carrying two tandem repeats of APRE of α2-macroglobulin using LipofectAMINE plus (Invitrogen). As an internal control, the plasmid pRL containing theRenilla luciferase gene was co-transfected. To examine the effect of STAT3 on the cyclin D1 promoter in hepatic cells, fetal hepatocyte, huH7, HepG2, and huH2.2 were transiently transfected with pME18S/STAT3-C and the luciferase reporter linked to the human cyclin D1 promoter (−1745-Luc) (a gift from Dr. Y. Kanakura). Cells were cultured in medium for each cell type for 24 h and then lysed with passive lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity was measured according to the technical manual for the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). To establish STAT3-C stable transfectants of huH7, HepG2, and huH2.2, these cells were transfected with RcCMV-STAT3-C-neo (35Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgan G. Zhao Y. Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1999; 98: 295-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2517) Google Scholar), and stable transfectants of STAT3-C were selected by treatment of 800 μg/ml of G418 for 3 weeks. Since STAT3-C was tagged with FLAG, ectopic expression of STAT3-C was confirmed by Western blotting using anti-FLAG antibody (data not shown). As the expression of cyclin D1 is rapidly induced during liver injury, it is believed that D1 cyclin plays an essential role in the proliferation of hepatocytes during liver regeneration (32Fausto N. J. Hepatol. 2000; 32: 19-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, neither the expression nor role of D-type cyclins in liver development had been clarified. We therefore first examined the expression of D-type cyclins during liver development by Northern analysis using RNA prepared from livers at different developmental stages (Fig. 1 A). While both D1 and D3 cyclins were highly expressed in fetal liver until E14.5, their expression decreased along with the development of the liver. The expression level of cyclin D2 was rather low in the E12.5 and E14.5 livers and also further decreased during the development. In contrast, the expression of metabolic enzymes, TAT and tryptophan oxygenase, was induced in neonatal and adult liver, respectively (Fig. 1 A). These results indicate that the expression of D-type cyclins is negatively regulated during liver development in vivo. We previously demonstrated that OSM in combination with dexamethasone induces hepatic differentiation in vitro (20Kamiya A. Kinoshita T. Ito Y. Matsui T. Morikawa Y. Senba E. Nakashima K. Taga T. Yoshida K. Kishimoto T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2127-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Because OSM induces the expression of differentiation markers of neonatal liver such as TAT (20Kamiya A. Kinoshita T. Ito Y. Matsui T. Morikawa Y. Senba E. Nakashima K. Taga T. Yoshida K. Kishimoto T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2127-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 29Ito Y. Matsui T. Kamiya A. Kinoshita T. Miyajima A. Hepatology. 2000; 32: 1370-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), it is possible that OSM also regulates the expression of D-type cyclins in liver development. To test this possibility, we examined the mRNA expression of D-type cyclins in a primary culture of fetal hepatocytes at E14.5 (Fig.1 B). Consistent with the expression of D-type cyclins in the E14.5 liver in vivo (Fig. 1 A), cyclin D1 was expressed abundantly in culture at day 0, and its expression was maintained in the absence of OSM for 7 days, while it was slightly decreased transiently at day 3 (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, in the presence of OSM the expression of cyclin D1 was almost completely abrogated within 3 days. Although cyclin D2 was not expressed in culture at day 0, its expression increased gradually in the absence of OSM. OSM also suppressed the expression of cyclin D2, indicating the expression to be negatively regulated by the OSM signaling. While cyclin D3 expression was down-regulated during liver developmentin vivo, it was not affected by OSM in vitro, indicating that the OSM signaling is not sufficient to down-regulate cyclin D3 expression. We also investigated the mRNA expression of other cell cycle regulators including cyclin A, CDK 4, c-Myc, p21, and p27 in fetal hepatocytes; however, in no cases was it affected by OSM (data not shown). These results suggest that OSM down-regulates the expression of D1 and D2 cyclins in liver development. OSM functions through the OSM receptor, which consists of the OSM specific subunit (OSMRβ) and gp130, the common signal transducing subunit of the IL-6 family cytokines (22Hirano T. Nakajima K. Hibi M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 241-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 37Lindberg R.A. Juan T.S. Welcher A.A. Sun Y. Cupples R. Guthrie B. Fletcher F.A. Mol. Cell.

There are seven tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of gp130. Among them, the second (Tyr-757) and third (Tyr-765) tyrosine residues from the transmembrane domain are known to be the docking site for SHP-2 and STAT3, respectively (24Fukada T. Hibi M.

Hirano T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). To investigate the signaling pathways responsible for the suppression of cyclin D, we utilized chimeric receptors consisting of the extracellular domain of the G-CSF receptor with various mutants of the intracellular domain of gp130 (Fig.2) (24Fukada T. Hibi M. Yamanaka Y. Takahashi-Tezuka M. Fujitani Y. Yamaguchi T. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Immunity. 1996; 5: 449-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 25Fukada T. Ohtani T. Yoshida Y. Shirogane T. Nishida K. Nakajima K. Hibi M. Hirano T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6670-6677Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Because the chimeric receptor, G133, lacks 144 amino acid residues from the C terminus of gp130, but still has both docking sites for SHP-2 and STAT3, stimulation with G-CSF leads to the activation of SHP-2/Ras and STAT3 signaling pathways in a manner similar to the full-length gp130 (Fig.2 A) (24Fukada T. Hibi M. Yamanaka Y. Takahashi-Tezuka M. Fujitani Y. Yamaguchi T. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Immunity. 1996; 5: 449-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 25Fukada T. Ohtani T. Yoshida Y. Shirogane T. Nishida K. Nakajima K. Hibi M. Hirano T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6670-6677Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). As the G133F2 receptor lacks the docking site of SHP-2 due to substitution of the second tyrosine (Tyr) with phenylalanine (Phe), it activates only the STAT3 pathway. Conversely, G133F3, which lacks the docking site of STAT3, activates the SHP-2/Ras signaling alone (Fig. 2 A). The G133F2/3 receptor that lacks both docking sites does not activate either signaling pathway. We constructed pMXII retroviral vectors carrying these chimeric receptors and expressed them in fetal hepatocytes as we previously reported. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis using anti-G-CSFR antibody revealed that these receptors were expressed in 79–84% of fetal hepatocytes (Fig. 2 B). Expression of the G133 receptor slightly reduced the expression of cyclin D1 and D2 in response to G-CSF as compared with the control level (Fig. 2 C,lanes 3 and 4). Importantly, the G133F2 mutant receptor, which only activates the STAT3 signaling pathway, suppressed the expression of cyclin D1 and D2 in response to G-CSF to the same level as OSM (lanes 2 and 5). On the other hand, both G133F3 and G133F2/3, which do not activate STAT3 signaling, did not show such strong effect as G133F2 on cyclin expression (lanes 5, 6, and 7). These results suggest that the docking site of STAT3 in gp130 is essential for the down-regulation of cyclin D expression by OSM. To further confirm the role of STAT3 in the suppression of cyclin D expression, we next expressed STAT mutants using pMIG retroviral vectors. Ectopic expression of the dominant negative form of STAT3 (ΔSTAT3), which lacks the C-terminal transactivation domain, sustained the expression of D1 and D2 cyclins when OSM was present, indicating that ΔSTAT3 inhibits the negative effect of OSM on the expression of D1 and D2 cyclins (Fig.3 A, lane 3). In contrast, ΔSTAT5, which also lacks the C-terminal transactivation domain, had no inhibitory effect on their expression (Fig.3 A, lane 4). Although OSM also activates the SHP-2/Ras pathway, RasN17, a dominant negative form of Ras, did not affect the negative effect of OSM on the cyclin expression. Interestingly, however, activation of the Ras pathway by expression of RasV12, a constitutively active form, augmented the expression of cyclin D1 (Fig. 3 A, lane 5). These results suggest that oncogenic Ras contributes to the induction of cyclin D1 expression, as previously shown by Wulf et al.(9Wulf G.M. Ryo A. Wulf G.G. Lee S.W. Niu T. Petkova V. Lu K.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3459-3472Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). These results clearly demonstrate that the activation of STAT3 is indispensable for the suppression of the expression of D1 and D2 cyclins by OSM. The results described above clearly indicate that the STAT3 signaling pathway is necessary for the suppression of cyclin D expression during hepatic differentiation induced by OSM. To test whether the activation of STAT3 is sufficient for the down-regulation, we utilized transgenic mice that express STAT3ER, a fusion protein composed of the entire STAT3 with the modified ligand binding domain (G525R) of the estrogen receptor (Fig.4 A) (42Littlewood T.D. Hancock D.C. Danielian P.S. Parker M.G. Evan G.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1686-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). STAT3ER dimerizes in response to the synthetic estrogen receptor ligand, 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4HT), leading to the activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway (42Littlewood T.D. Hancock D.C. Danielian P.S. Parker M.G. Evan G.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1686-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). Recently, Matsuda et al. generated a chimeric mouse with embryonic stem cells expressing STAT3ER, which had been maintained in the presence of 4HT instead of leukemia inhibitory factor (43Matsuda T. Nakamura T. Nakao K. Arai T. Katsuki M. Heike T. Yokota T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4261-4269Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). As the STAT3ER allele was transmitted to the germ line in this mouse, the offspring of the chimeric mouse expressed STAT3ER ubiquitously in almost all organs including the liver (data not shown).

Critical to this binding are the carboxyl-terminal MEEVD motif of Hsp90 and the TPR domain of CyP40. Two different models of the CyP40-MEEVD peptide interaction were used as the basis for a comprehensive mutational analysis of the Hsp90-interacting domain of CyP40. Using a carboxyl-terminal CyP40 construct as template, 24 amino acids from the TPR and flanking acidic and basic domains were individually mutated by site-directed mutagenesis, and the mutants were coexpressed in yeast with a carboxyl-terminal Hsp90β construct and qualitatively assessed for binding using a β-galactosidase filter assay. For quantitative assessment, mutants were expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins and assayed for binding to carboxyl-terminal Hsp90β using conventional pulldown and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay microtiter plate assays. Collectively, the models predict that the following TPR residues help define a binding groove for the MEEVD peptide: Lys-227, Asn-231, Phe-234, Ser-274, Asn-278, Lys-308, and Arg-312. Mutational analysis identified five of these residues (Lys-227, Asn-231, Asn-278, Lys-308, and Arg-312) as essential for Hsp90 binding. The other two residues (Phe-234 and Ser-274) and another three TPR domain residues not definitively associated with the binding groove (Leu-284, Lys-285, and Asp-329) are required for efficient Hsp90 binding. These data confirm the critical importance of the MEEVD binding groove in CyP40 for Hsp90 recognition and reveal that additional charged and hydrophobic residues within the CyP40 TPR domain are required for Hsp90 binding.

This novel cyclophilin binds the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A and shares structural similarity with its partner co-chaperones, FKBP51 and FKBP52, both immunophilins of the FK506-binding class (1Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Google Scholar). The structure of these large immunophilins is characterized by an amino-terminal immunophilin-like domain that is targeted by immunosuppressant drugs and overlaps a peptidylprolyl isomerase function and a carboxyl-terminal protein interaction domain incorporating 3 units of the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motif (3Ratajczak T. Carrello A. Mark P.J. Warner B.J. Simpson R.J. Moritz R.L. House A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13187-13192Google Scholar). These immunophilins have been implicated in steroid receptor function through their association with Hsp90. Within steroid receptor complexes the immunophilins compete directly for a common binding site located in the carboxyl-terminal region of Hsp90 (4Young J.C. Obermann W.M. Hartl F.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18007-18010Google Scholar, 5Carrello A. Ingley E. Minchin R.F. Tsai S. Ratajczak T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2682-2689Google Scholar). A similar mode of interaction mediates the assembly of PP5, a TPR-containing serine/threonine protein phosphatase, into glucocorticoid receptor-Hsp90 complexes (6Silverstein A.M. Galigniana M.D. Chen M.S. Owens-Grillo J.K. Chinkers M. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16224-16230Google Scholar). This common recognition site mediates Hsp90 dimerization (7Nemoto T. Ohara-Nemoto Y. Ota M. Takagi T. Yokoyama K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 1-8Google Scholar) and chaperone activity (8Young J.C. Schneider C. Hartl F.U. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 139-143Google Scholar, 9Scheibel T. Weikl T. Buchner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1495-1499Google Scholar) and contains structural elements important for steroid receptor interaction (10Sullivan W.P. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20373-20379Google Scholar, 11Binart N. Lombes M. Baulieu E.E. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 797-804Google Scholar, 12Meng X. Devin J. Sullivan W.P. Toft D. Baulieu E.E. Catelli M.G. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1677-1687Google Scholar). Hsp90 then, can be viewed as providing a scaffold for the immunophilins, locating them close to steroid receptors and allowing them to modulate or fine tune receptor responsiveness to hormone. In vitro assembly studies suggest that incorporation of the TPR-containing immunophilins and PP5 into steroid receptor complexes represents an end stage in the chaperone-mediated assembly process (1Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Google Scholar,13Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1418-1429Google Scholar, 14Cheung J. Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 939-946Google Scholar). At steady state, the majority of receptors exist as mature receptor-Hsp90-immunophilin complexes. Initial steps along the maturation pathway involve interaction of receptor with Hsp40 and recruitment of the Hsp70 chaperone (15Hernandez M.P. Chadli A. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11873-11881Google Scholar). This is followed by sequential participation of Hip and Hop (15Hernandez M.P. Chadli A. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11873-11881Google Scholar, 16Smith D. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 283-288Google Scholar), co-chaperones with TPR domains that are structurally related to those in steroid receptor-associated immunophilins (3Ratajczak T. Carrello A. Mark P.J. Warner B.J. Simpson R.J. Moritz R.L. House A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13187-13192Google Scholar, 16Smith D. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 283-288Google Scholar, 17Honore B. Leffers H. Madsen P. Rasmussen H.H. Vandekerckhove J. Celis J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8485-8491Google Scholar, 18Irmer H. Hohfeld J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2230-2235Google Scholar). The three-unit TPR domain in Hip mediates exclusive interaction with the amino-terminal ATPase domain of Hsp70 (18Irmer H. Hohfeld J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2230-2235Google Scholar). Separate TPR domains located at the amino- and carboxyl-terminal ends of Hop serve as distinct recognition sites for Hsp70 and Hsp90, respectively (19Chen S. Prapapanich V. Rimerman R.A. Honore B. Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 682-693Google Scholar, 20Lassle M. Blatch G.L. Kundra V. Takatori T. Zetter B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1876-1884Google Scholar). In contrast to Hip, Hop targets the carboxyl-terminal region of Hsp70, which incorporates the substrate binding pocket (21Frydman J. Hohfeld J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 87-92Google Scholar, 22Demand J. Luders J. Hohfeld J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2023-2028Google Scholar). Hop is essential for the recruitment of Hsp90 to steroid receptors (19Chen S. Prapapanich V. Rimerman R.A. Honore B. Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 682-693Google Scholar) and interacts with the common TPR acceptor site recognized by TPR-containing immunophilins (4Young J.C. Obermann W.M. Hartl F.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18007-18010Google Scholar, 5Carrello A. Ingley E. Minchin R.F. Tsai S. Ratajczak T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2682-2689Google Scholar). The TPR domains in Hip and Hop, then, appear to direct different specificities for protein interaction. For Hip, at least part of its interaction selectivity for Hsp70 is mediated by charged regions flanking the TPR domain (18Irmer H. Hohfeld J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2230-2235Google Scholar). Subregions adjacent to the TPR domains of CyP40, FKBP51, and FKBP52 also contribute significantly to Hsp90 recognition (23Ratajczak T. Carrello A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2961-2965Google Scholar, 24Barent R.L. Nair S.C. Carr D.C. Ruan Y. Rimerman R.A. Fulton J. Zhang Y. Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 342-354Google Scholar). The interaction of these immunophilins with Hsp90, however, is not identical (24Barent R.L. Nair S.C. Carr D.C. Ruan Y. Rimerman R.A. Fulton J. Zhang Y. Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 342-354Google Scholar), and there is increasing evidence that their incorporation into steroid receptor complexes results in different functional outcomes for receptor activity (25Reynolds P.D. Ruan Y. Smith D.F. Scammell J.G. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 84: 663-669Google Scholar, 26Denny W.B. Valentine D.L. Reynolds P.D. Smith D.F. Scammell J.G. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4107-4113Google Scholar, 27Davies T.H. Ning Y.M. Sanchez E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4597-4600Google Scholar). The conserved sequence MEEVD, at the extreme carboxyl terminus of Hsp90, forms a binding motif that is essential for interaction with TPR-containing immunophilins, PP5 and Hop (5Carrello A. Ingley E. Minchin R.F. Tsai S. Ratajczak T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2682-2689Google Scholar, 28Chen S. Sullivan W.P. Toft D.O. Smith D.F. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1998; 3: 118-129Google Scholar, 29Russell L.C. Whitt S.R. Chen M.S. Chinkers M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20060-20063Google Scholar). Early predictions based on secondary structure divided the TPR motif, consisting of a degenerate 34-amino acid sequence, into a pair of antiparallel, α-helical A and B subdomains (30Sikorski R.S. Boguski M.S. Goebl M. Hieter P. Cell. 1990; 60: 307-317Google Scholar, 31Hirano T. Kinoshita N. Morikawa K. Yanagida M. Cell. 1990; 60: 319-328Google Scholar). The x-ray crystallographic structure of the three-unit TPR domain in PP5 confirmed this basic helix-turn-helix conformation and revealed that TPR motifs arranged in tandem form an amphipathic groove, providing a recognition surface for protein interaction (32Das A.K. Cohen P.W. Barford D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1192-1199Google Scholar). Within the PP5 TPR domain, 4 basic residues that are conserved among TPR-containing immunophilins protrude into this binding groove and have been shown to be important for Hsp90 interaction (29Russell L.C. Whitt S.R. Chen M.S. Chinkers M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20060-20063Google Scholar). High resolution crystal structures for TPR-peptide complexes between Hsp70 (GSGSGPTIEEVD) and Hsp90 (MEEVD) carboxyl-terminal peptides and distinct TPR domains in Hop have shown that electrostatic interactions serve to anchor the EEVDmotif within the binding groove and that hydrophobic contacts mediated by residues upstream of this sequence determine heat shock protein specificity (33Scheufler C. Brinker A. Bourenkov G. Pegoraro S. Moroder L. Bartunik H. Hartl F.U. Moarefi I. Cell. 2000; 101: 199-210Google Scholar). We have recently determined a refined crystal structure for CyP40, the first high resolution structure of a full-length TPR-containing immunophilin (34Taylor P. Dornan J. Carrello A. Minchin R.F. Ratajczak T. Walkinshaw M.D. Structure. 2001; 9: 431-438Google Scholar). Modeling of the MEEVD sequence onto the surface of the CyP40 TPR domain showed the peptide to locate into a defined groove comprising amino acid residues from the A helices of all three TPR units (34Taylor P. Dornan J. Carrello A. Minchin R.F. Ratajczak T. Walkinshaw M.D. Structure. 2001; 9: 431-438Google Scholar). We have used the available structural information for Hsp90-binding TPR proteins to guide a comprehensive mutational analysis of the carboxyl-terminal Hsp90 interacting domain of CyP40. Our study has identified 10 residues that contribute to a binding interface within the core TPR domain to mediate Hsp90-CyP40 interaction. Atomic coordinates for the modeling of the Hsp90 carboxyl-terminal MEEVD peptide interaction with CyP40 were taken from the Protein Data Bank (35Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Google Scholar). Docking of the modeled MEEVD peptide onto the surface of CyP40 was carried out using the program WITNOTP (36Widmer A. WITNOTP: A Computer Program for Molecular Modelling. Novartis AG, Basel1997Google Scholar). Electrostatic potential surfaces were calculated using the DelPhi module from the INSIGHT II suite of programs (37Honig B. Sharp K. Yang A.S. J. Phys. Chem. 1993; 97: 1101-1109Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal half of human CyP40 (amino acid residues 185–370), encoding the TPR domain and flanking acidic and basic domains, was cloned into the EcoRI site of pBTM116, a bait vector appropriate for use with the yeast two-hybrid system (38Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Google Scholar). This produced the pBTM116-hCyP40 185–370 plasmid containing the carboxyl half of CyP40 fused to the DNA binding domain of LexA (amino acid residues 1–202). The primers used for generation of the CyP40 insert were as follows: 5′-GGATGAATTCGAAGGAGATGACGGG-3′ (sense primer) and 5′-GGGGGAATTCCTAAGCAAACATTTTTGC-3′ (antisense primer). Sequence integrity of the CyP40 insert was confirmed using internal primers. For use in the yeast two-hybrid β-galactosidase filter assay, a carboxyl-terminal fragment of human Hsp90β (amino acid residues 520–724) was cloned into the pVP16 prey vector after amplification of codons 520–724 from recombinant pET-15b-hHsp90β template (39Shi Y. Brown E.D. Walsh C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2767-2771Google Scholar) in conjunction with the primers 5′-GGGGCGGCCGCTATACTGTGTGCAGCAGCTC-3′ (sense primer) and 5′-GGGGCGGCCGCCTAATCGACTTCTTCCATGC-3′ (antisense primer). These primers introduced a NotI site at both termini, allowing the PCR product to be cloned into the NotI site of the vector pGEM-11Z. After a check on sequence fidelity using pUC/M13 universal primers, a suitable insert was subcloned into theNotI site of pVP16. A plasmid, pVP16-hHsp90β 520–724, with the insert in the correct orientation, was selected for use in the assay. For pulldown and plate assays, wild-type and mutant hCyP40 185–370 fragments, released from their pBTM116 recombinant plasmids byEcoRI digestion, were subcloned into the EcoRI site of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion vector pGEX4T.1 (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, UK). Recombinants were transformed into the high protein expression bacterial strain,Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and individual clones checked for correct orientation of the insert within the vector by restriction enzyme analysis. The plasmids pET28a(+)-hHsp90β 530–724 (5Carrello A. Ingley E. Minchin R.F. Tsai S. Ratajczak T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2682-2689Google Scholar) and pET15b-hHsp90β (39Shi Y. Brown E.D. Walsh C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2767-2771Google Scholar) were used to express amino-terminal His-tagged human Hsp90β 530–724 and full-length Hsp90β proteins, respectively, for use in conventional pulldown and plate assays for CyP40 interaction. The pBTM116-hCyP40 185–370 plasmid was used as a template for the generation of single amino acid substitution mutants using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The 24 amino acids for mutational analysis (see Fig. 2) were selected on the basis of initial modeling experiments of the Hsp90 MEEVD motif with CyP40 (see Fig. 1, A andB), mutational or crystallographic analysis of CyP40 and other TPR-containing proteins (29Russell L.C. Whitt S.R. Chen M.S. Chinkers M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20060-20063Google Scholar, 32Das A.K. Cohen P.W. Barford D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1192-1199Google Scholar, 33Scheufler C. Brinker A.

Walkinshaw M.D. Structure. 2001; 9: 431-438Google Scholar), or whether there was extensive conservation of a particular residue between various Hsp90-binding, TPR-containing proteins. All charged residues selected and the uncharged residues Phe-234, Cys-282, Leu-284, Tyr-365, and Phe-369 were replaced by alanine, whereas the polar, uncharged residues Asn-231, Asn-278, and Gln-315 were each replaced by aspartic acid and Ser-274 by leucine. All mutant clones were sequenced using the Big Dye Terminator ready reaction sequencing kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to confirm the presence of the mutation and the authenticity of the remaining CyP40 sequence.Figure 1Modeling of the Hsp90 MEEVD peptide onto the CyP40 TPR domain. A, configuration based on the intermolecular interactions of bovine CyP40 as revealed by its crystal structure (34Taylor P. Dornan J. Carrello A. Minchin R.F. Ratajczak T. Walkinshaw M.D. Structure. 2001; 9: 431-438Google Scholar) (left) or on the crystal structure of the Hop TPR2A·MEEVD peptide complex (33Scheufler C. Brinker A. Bourenkov G. Pegoraro S. Moroder L. Bartunik H. Hartl F.U. Moarefi I. Cell. 2000; 101: 199-210Google Scholar) (right). An electrostatic surface (red, negatively charged andblue, positively charged) was calculated for CyP40 using the Delphi module from the INSIGHT II suite of programs (37Honig B. Sharp K. Yang A.S. J. Phys. Chem. 1993; 97: 1101-1109Google Scholar). The MEEVD peptide (insets) is shown (arrowed) in a space-filling representation with carbon atoms shown ingreen, oxygen atoms in red, nitrogen atoms inblue, and the sulfur atom in yellow. Both representations clearly show the MEEVD peptide docking into a concave inner groove thereby making contact with residues from the CyP40 TPR domain helices P, R, and T. Note that docking of the MEEVD peptide occurs in the opposite orientation for the two models. B, ball and stick representation of the MEEVD-CyP40 interaction based on the crystal structure of CyP40 (left) or on the Hop TPR2A-MEEVD crystal structure (right). The balls and sticks of the MEEVD peptide are colored as described forA with the carboxyl-terminal aspartate (Asp-0) and amino-terminal methionine (Met-4) residues denoted D andM, respectively. The 10 residues identified in this paper as being required for efficient CyP40-Hsp90 interaction arehighlighted. Mutation of CyP40 residues in yellow(Lys-227, Asn-231, Asn-278, Lys-308, and Arg-312) completely or almost completely prevented Hsp90 binding, and those in red(Phe-234, Ser-274, Leu-284, Lys-285, and Asp-329) significantly reduced binding compared with wild-type CyP40. Residues Tyr-246 and Asp-303, which may also contribute to Hsp90-CyP40 interaction, are shown ingreen. Note that key electrostatic interactions involving Asp-0 and Glu-2 and forming a two-carboxylate clamp can occur in both models, despite the difference in orientation of the MEEVD peptide in the binding groove.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) pGEX4T.1-hCyP40 185–370 wild-type and mutant fusion proteins were expressed and purified as described previously (40Ratajczak T. Carrello A. Minchin R.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 117-125Google Scholar). Briefly, suitable clones were amplified as 10-ml overnight cultures, after which time the cells were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 100 ml of culture medium, and grown for a further 1 h at 37 °C. Protein expression was induced with isopropyl β-thiogalactopyranoside (0.5 mm final concentration) for a period of 1.5 h. Cultures were centrifuged and bacterial pellets resuspended in MTPBS buffer (150 mmNaCl, 15 mm Na2HPO4, 4 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.3) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Basel, Switzerland) and frozen overnight at −70 °C. They were then thawed and 0.8 mg/ml lysozyme (Sigma), 0.2% v/v Triton X-100 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 5 mm benzamidine (Sigma) added before incubation for 5–30 min at either room temperature (∼23 °C) or 30 °C. Dithiothreitol and EDTA, pH 8.0, were then added to final concentrations of 5 mm and 2 mm, respectively. In some cases (mutants D204A, E207A, and D329A), protein expression was improved when lysozyme was omitted, whereas the optimal incubation time and temperature were different for each mutant and were determined empirically (results not shown). Bacterial suspensions were further lysed by sonication and the lysates clarified by centrifugation at 32,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C in a Kontron TGA-65 ultracentrifuge. GST fusion proteins present in the clarified supernatant were then purified by affinity chromatography with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences). The gel was washed 12 times in MTPBS buffer, pH 7.3, containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 5 mmbenzamidine) (first 10 washes only) and 1% v/v Triton X-100 (first four washes only). GST fusion proteins were eluted twice from the beads with 50 mm Tris HCl, pH 8.0, containing 10 mmglutathione, followed by centrifugation to remove the beads. Eluates were dialyzed at 4 °C against buffer A (100 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3) using Slide-a-Lyzer dialysis cassettes (Pierce). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay (41Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). The His-tagged Hsp90β 530–724 recombinant protein was expressed inE. coli strain BL21 (codon +) using 100-ml cultures maximized for expression according to the manufacturer's instructions (Novagen, Madison, WI) with isopropyl β-thiogalactopyranoside induction for 2 h. Bacterial pellets from two 100-ml cultures were resuspended collectively in 6 ml of buffer containing 50 mmsodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mmimidazole, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and frozen overnight at −70 °C. After thawing, lysozyme and Triton X-100 were added to final concentrations of 0.8 mg/ml and 0.2% v/v, respectively, and benzamidine to a concentration of 5 mm. The cell suspension was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and lysed further by sonication and clarified by ultracentrifugation as described above for the GST-CyP40 fusion proteins. His-tagged recombinant proteins were purified from clarified lysates by chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen, Germantown, MD). Unbound proteins were removed by 10 successive washes in buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 5 mm benzamidine; the first four washes also contained 0.2% v/v Triton X-100. Adsorbed protein was eluted by rotation of the chelate-agarose for 10 min at 4 °C with the same buffer without Triton X-100 but containing 250 mmimidazole. The eluate was then equilibrated against buffer A at 4 °C and assessed for protein concentration using the Bradford assay. The full-length hHsp90β protein was similarly expressed and purified except that larger culture volumes (1 liter in E. colistrain BL21) were required to obtain sufficient protein. The pBTM116-hCyP40 185–370 wild-type and mutant constructs were each cotransformed with pVP16-hHsp90β 520–724 plasmid into theSaccharomyces cerevisiae L40 strain (38Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Google Scholar). The transformation procedure was based on a modification of the lithium acetate method (42Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Google Scholar) with cells plated on synthetic dropout medium lacking uracil, tryptophan, and leucine. The exact procedure followed is described in the CLONTECH Yeast Protocols Handbook, 2000. To monitor false positive interaction, pBTM116-ARL-E1 and pVP16 hHsp90β 520–724 were cotransformed into L40 yeast as a negative control (5Carrello A. Ingley E. Minchin R.F. Tsai S. Ratajczak T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2682-2689Google Scholar). Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 3–5 days and were screened for β-galactosidase activity using the X-gal colony lift filter assay according to the CLONTECH protocol. Briefly, fresh colonies were lifted onto filter discs (Whatman, Maidstone, UK), submerged in liquid nitrogen, and thawed at room temperature to permeabilize the cells, then placed on a membrane presoaked in buffer solution containing X-gal and β-mercaptoethanol. The time taken for colonies to turn blue was recorded for each plate, and the level of interaction for each mutant was assessed qualitatively by the time of color change relative to wild-type hCyP40 185–370. Purified GST-hCyP40 185–370 wild-type or mutant fusion proteins (7 μg) and purified hHsp90β 530–724 protein (15 μg) were incubated together in 500 μl of binding buffer (buffer A containing 1 mm dithiothreitol) with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 1 h at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. After this, 30 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B bead suspension was added and mixed in by vortexing, and the incubation was continued for a further 1 h 40 min. (To facilitate visualization of pellets, glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads were prepared as a 2:1 mixture of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads and Sepharose 4B filler beads both prewashed in buffer A and finally resuspended in an equivalent bead volume of this buffer.) After incubation, beads were pelleted by centrifugation and pellets washed three times in 750 μl of binding buffer containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and then four times in 750 μl of binding buffer without Triton X-100, with care taken to suspend the beads thoroughly by vortexing after the addition of fresh buffer. After the final wash, the supernatant was discarded to leave 25 μl of bead suspension, which was boiled in 25 μl of 2 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer. For each run, a wild-type GST-hCyP40 185–370 binding reaction was included as well as a control with 15 μg of hHsp90β 530–724 protein alone to check for nonspecific binding of the protein to the beads. Proteins were separated on 12.5% polyacrylamide gels and visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. The ratio of hHsp90β 530–724 that bound to wild-type and each mutant GST-hCyP40 185–370 construct was determined by densitometry using Scion Image software (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD) with correction for background and nonspecific hHsp90β 530–724 binding, the latter proving to be minimal, if detectable at all. Binding assays for each mutant construct were performed at least three times. These were performed in Immulon 4HBX 96-well microtiter plates (Dynex Laboratories Inc., Chantilly, VA). Approximately 40 nm hHsp90β 530–724 in 100 mm NaHCO3, pH 8.5, was applied in 100-μl aliquots to triplicate wells for each sample and incubated at 4 °C for 3 h (for each sample, an equivalent amount of bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) was added to adjacent wells in triplicate as a control for nonspecific binding). Wells were blocked with 100 μl of 0.1% w/v BSA in 100 mmNaHCO3, pH 8.5, for an additional 1 h at 4 °C, then washed five times with chilled TBST (50 mm Tris, 145 mm NaCl, 0.075% Tween 20, pH 7.6) to remove excess protein. After washing, 100 μl of 200 nm wild-type or mutant GST-hCyP40 185–370 in TBST buffer containing 0.1% w/v BSA was added to the wells and allowed to bind for 1 h at 4 °C. Unbound GST-hCyP40 185–370 proteins were removed by washing the wells five times with chilled TBST buffer. Goat anti-GST antibody (AmershamBiosciences) diluted 1:2,000 in chilled TBST buffer containing 0.1% w/v BSA was added as 100-μl volumes to each well and incubated"
https://openalex.org/W2071049203,"P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), a dimeric mucin on leukocytes, is the best characterized ligand for selectins. P-selectin binds stereospecifically to the extreme N terminus of PSGL-1, which contains three clustered tyrosine sulfates (TyrSO 3−) adjacent to a Thr residue with a core 2-based O-glycan expressing sialyl Lewis x (C2-O-sLex). GSP-6, a synthetic glycosulfopeptide modeled after the N terminus of PSGL-1, containing three TyrSO 3− residues and a short, monofucosylated C2-O-sLex bound to P-selectin with high affinity (K d ∼650 nm). However, PSGL-1 from human HL-60 cells contains higher levels ofO-glycans that are sialylated and polyfucosylated polylactosamines (PFPL). Furthermore, studies with fucosyltransferase-deficient mice suggest that sialylated PFPL structures contribute to binding to P-selectin. To resolve whether sialylated PFPL O-glycans participate in binding of PSGL-1 to human P-selectin, we synthesized glycosulfopeptides, designated GSP-6′ and GSP-6“, with three TyrSO 3− residues and either difucosylated polylactosamine (C2-O-Lex-sLex) or trifucosylated polylactosamine (C2-O-Lex-Lex-sLex). Binding of the GSPs to P-selectin was measured by affinity chromatography, fluorescence solid-phase assays, and equilibrium gel filtration. Unexpectedly, both GSP-6′ and GSP-6” bound to P-selectin with low affinity (K d ∼37 μm for GSP-6′ and K d ∼50 μm for GSP-6“). Binding of GSP-6′ and GSP-6” to P-selectin required fucosylation and, to a lesser extent, sialylation as well as the sulfated peptide backbone of GSP-6′ and GSP-6“. These results demonstrate that contrary to expectations, a core 2 O-glycan containing sialylated PFPL does not promote high affinity binding of PSGL-1 to P-selectin.

Selectins bind with high affinity to specific macromolecular ligands in the vascular system containing the sialyl Lewis x epitope (sLex,1NeuAcα2–3Galβ1–4(Fucα1–3)GlcNAc-R), but binding to the sLex-containing glycan alone is weak (2McEver R.P.

The best characterized ligand for selectins is P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), a disulfide-linked homodimeric mucin on leukocytes. PSGL-1 binds with relatively high affinity (K d ∼300 nm) to P-selectin (4Mehta P. Cummings R.D. McEver R.P. J. Biol.

The extreme N terminus of mature human PSGL-1 begins at amino acid residue 42 and contains three potential tyrosine sulfation sites at Tyr-46, -48, and -51. Sulfation of these tyrosine residues, along with a core 2 O-glycan capped with sLex(C2-O-sLex) at Thr-57, are necessary for high affinity binding of PSGL-1 to P-selectin (7Sako D. Chang X.J.

Direct interaction of P-selectin with this domain was demonstrated by utilizing synthetic glycosulfopeptides. Monomeric glycosulfopeptide-6, corresponding to an N-terminal segment of PSGL-1 containing three TyrSO 3− residues at Tyr-46, -48, and -51 and a C2-O-sLex at Thr-57, binds to P-selectin with high affinity (K d ∼350 nm) (11Leppanen A.

In addition, trypsin treatment of PSGL-1 from HL-60 cells generates a structurally related glycosulfopeptide that binds to P-selectin with high affinity (12Epperson T.K. Patel K.D. McEver R.P.

However, there is evidence that more complex O-glycans in PSGL-1 might mediate high affinity binding to P-selectin. PSGL-1 contains ∼70 potential O-glycosylation sites at Ser and Thr residues (7Sako D. Chang X.J. Barone K.M. Vachino G. White H.M. Shaw G. Veldman G.M. Bean K.M. Ahern T.J. Furie B. Cumming D.A.

Subsequent detailed structural analysis of O-glycans on PSGL-1 from the human promyelocytic cell line HL-60 showed that a majority of the fucose-containing O-glycans on PSGL-1 from HL-60 cells were sialylated and polyfucosylated polylactosamines (PFPL) (10Wilkins P.P.

Two fucosylatedO-glycans were identified: a core 2-based monosialylated, trifucosylated structure with a polylactosamine backbone (C2-O-Lex-Lex-sLex; 12%), and a less abundant core 2-based disialylated, monofucosylated structure lacking polylactosamine (C2-O-sLex, 2%). Whereas synthetic glycosulfopeptides containing the simple monosialylated monofucosylated C2-O-sLex bind to P-selectin, the role of sialylated PFPL O-glycans in binding to P-selectin has not been studied. Efficient generation of sialylated PFPL in vitro requires the participation of two human α1,3-fucosyltransferases expressed in leukocytes, FucT-IV and FucT-VII (14Niemela R. Natunen J. Majuri M.L.

To gain direct insight into the contribution of O-glycans with extended polylactosamine in PSGL-1 for binding to P-selectin, we synthesized two novel glycosulfopeptides (GSPs) corresponding to the N-terminal amino acid sequence of human PSGL-1. These contained the sLex epitope on an extended core 2-basedO-glycan at Thr-57 with either two (C2-O-Lex-sLex) or three (C2-O-Lex-Lex-sLex) fucosylated lactosamine repeats, plus three TyrSO 3− residues at Tyr-46, -48, and -51 (Fig. 1). Using these synthetic GSPs, we directly examined the contribution of the extended O-glycan for binding to P-selectin. Glycopeptide-1 (GP-1), corresponding to amino acid residues 45–61 of human PSGL-1 with a GalNAcα residue at Thr-57, was synthesized on an automated peptide synthesizer as described (19Leppanen A.

GP-4 was extended using partially purified β1,3-GlcNAcT from human serum (precipitated from human serum by ammonium sulfate at 25–50% saturation) (20Renkonen O. Helin J. Vainio A. Niemela R. Penttila L. Hilden P. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1990; 68: 1032-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In a typical reaction, GP-4 (20 nmol), UDP-GlcNAc (560 nmol), MnCl2 (160 nmol), 0.04% (w/v) NaN3, and a concentrate of β1,3-GlcNAcT (700 μg of protein) were incubated for 9 days at 37 °C in 20 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Then 100 μl of 50 mmNH4HCO3 was added, the solution was clarified by centrifugation, and the clear supernatant was subjected to gel filtration HPLC on a column of Superdex 75 HR (Amersham Biosciences). The glycopeptide fraction was analyzed by MALDI mass spectrometry (MS) as described (11Leppanen A. Mehta P. Ouyang Y.B., Ju, T. Helin J. Moore K.L. van Die I. Canfield W.M. McEver R.P. Cummings R.D.

MALDI MS revealed a major (M-H+)− molecular ion peak atm/z 3231.7 that was assigned to glycopeptide GP-4.1 (calculated m/z, 3232.3). Three small signals were also present. One of these, representing ∼5% of the major peak, had the same m/z as the acceptor GP-4. Another small signal was assigned as anhydro-GP-4.1 (∼10–15%), and the third satellite signal could not be assigned. Glycopeptide GP-4.1 was then galactosylated by incubation with bovine milk β1,4-GalT (11Leppanen A. Mehta P. Ouyang Y.B., Ju, T. Helin J. Moore K.L. van Die I. Canfield W.M. McEver R.P. Cummings R.D.

MALDI analysis of the HPLC-purified glycopeptide fraction showed a major signal at m/z 3393.7 that was assigned to the (M-H+)− molecular ion of the galactosylated product GP-4.2 (calc. m/z3394.4). A minor signal of a putative anhydro-GP-4.2 was also present. Glycopeptide GP-4.2 (100 nmol) was extended using serum β1,3-GlcNAcT, as described for the extension of GP-4. MALDI analysis of the HPLC-purified glycopeptide fraction revealed a major signal atm/z 3597.2 that was assigned to the (M-H+)− molecular ion of GP-4.3 (calc.m/z 3597.6). Small signals (4% and ∼20%) represented the (M-H+)− molecular ions of the acceptor GP-4.2 and the anhydro form of GP-4.3, respectively. GP-4.3 was galactosylated with bovine milk β1,4-GalT. MALDI MS of the HPLC-purified glycopeptide fraction showed a major signal atm/z 3759.4, which was assigned to the (M-H+)− molecular ion of GP-4.4 (calc.m/z 3759.8). The MALDI spectrum also revealed several minor signals; the largest one (∼30%) was assigned to anhydro-GP-4.4. Glycopeptides GP-4.2 (8.2 nmol) and GP-4.4 (10 nmol) were sialylated using α2,3-(N)-sialylT (Calbiochem) (11Leppanen A. Mehta P. Ouyang Y.B., Ju, T. Helin J. Moore K.L. van Die I. Canfield W.M.

The reaction mixtures were purified by HPLC, and glycopeptide fractions were analyzed by MALDI MS. A major (M-H+)−molecular ion for the sialylT product of GP-4.2 was atm/z 3686.3 that represented GP-5′ (calc.m/z 3685.3). A minor signal atm/z 3669.2 was assigned to anhydro-GP-5′ (∼20%).

The reaction mixtures were purified by HPLC, and the glycopeptide fractions were analyzed by MALDI MS. MALDI analysis of the FucT product of GP-5′ showed a major signal at m/z 3977.9, which was assigned to the (M-H+)− molecular ion of GP-6′ (calc. m/z 3977.5). The minor signals of anhydro-GP-6′ (∼35%) and monofucosylated GP-6′ (∼5%) were also present. MALDI MS of the FucT product of GP-5“ revealed the major signal atm/z 4488.9, which was assigned to the (M-H+)− molecular ion of GP-6” (calc.m/z 4489.1). MALDI analysis showed that partially fucosylated structures were very minor, but the signal of anhydro-GP-6“ was ∼50%. Glycopeptide products GP-6′ and GP-6” were further purified in reversed phase HPLC, where GP-6′ and GP-6“ were separated from anhydro-GP-6′ and -GP-6”, respectively. The masses of GP-6′ and GP-6“ were verified by electrospray MS, which showed the molecular masses of 3977.8 for GP-6′ and 4489.1 for GP-6”. Sodium adducts of the peptides were also present in the mass spectra. Glycopeptides GP-6′ and GP-6“ were sulfated enzymatically using human tyrosyl-protein sulfotransferase-1 and [35S]PAPS (1470 cpm/pmol) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as a sulfate donor as described (11Leppanen A.

The fully sulfated glycosulfopeptides, GSP-6′ and GSP-6”, were separated from partially sulfated glycosulfopeptides using HPLC. GSP-1, corresponding to amino acid residues 45–61 of human PSGL-1 with three TyrSO 3− residues (Tyr-46, -48, and -51) and a GalNAcα residue at Thr-57, was synthesized on an automated peptide synthesizer as described (19Leppanen A.

HPLC-purified GSP-1 served as an acceptor for enzymatic synthesis of GSP-6′ and GSP-6“. The glycosyltransferase reactions were carried out by adding one glycosyltransferase and one donor at a time, and the completeness of each reaction was followed by HPLC. After the reaction was 95–100% complete, a new glycosyltransferase and a new donor were added. The first steps in the synthesis have been described in detail (11Leppanen A. Mehta P.

The product GSP-3 (322 nmol) was then sialylated at 37 °C for 18 h using CMP-NeuAc (650 nmol) and 30 milliunits of α2,3-(O)-sialylT (Calbiochem) in a reaction mixture (700 μl) containing 50 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 7.0, 10 mmMnCl2, 1 unit of alkaline phosphatase, 0.6% BSA, 0.02% NaN3. The α2,3-(O)-sialylT reaction mixture containing the product (GSP-3S; 294 nmol) was galactosylated for 15 h at 37 °C using 450 nmol of UDP-Gal and 50 milliunits of bovine milk β1,4-GalT (Sigma). The reaction mixture containing the galactosylated product (GSP-4S; 281 nmol) was diluted to a final volume of 2 ml of 50 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 7.4, 15 mm MnCl2, and 0.02% NaN3. The galactosylated core 2 branch of GSP-4S was extended by incubating the reaction mixture with 1.2 μmol of UDP-GlcNAc and 2.7 milliunits of recombinant (Nm)β1,3-GlcNAcT from Neisseria meningitidis lgtA (22Blixt O. van Die I.

The reaction mixture containing the extended glycosulfopeptide (GSP-4S.1; ∼266 nmol) was galactosylated by incubation for 49 h at 37 °C using 650 nmol of UDP-Gal and 150 milliunits of β1,4-GalT in a total reaction volume of 3 ml of 50 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 7.4, 15 mm MnCl2 and 0.02% NaN3. The reaction mixture containing the galactosylated glycosulfopeptide (GSP-4S.2) was divided into two. One half was treated with neuraminidase as described below, and the other half was extended by one N-acetyllactosamine unit using (Nm)β1,3-GlcNAcT and β1,4-GalT. The resulting GSP-4S.4 was treated with neuraminidase. The neuraminidase-treated samples (GSP-4.2 and GSP-4.4; 40–50 nmol each) were purified by HPLC and sialylated for ∼40 h at 37 °C using 500 nmol of CMP-NeuAc and 80 milliunits of α2,3-(N)-sialylT (Calbiochem) in a total reaction volume of 500 μl of 50 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 7.4, containing 15 mmMnCl2, 0.5 mg/ml BSA, and 1 unit of alkaline phosphatase. The newly sialylated samples were divided into two. One half of the reaction mixture containing GSP-5′ or GSP-5” was purified by HPLC and analyzed by MS. The other half was fucosylated for ∼21 h at 37 °C using a 3-fold molar excess of GDP-Fuc and 10 milliunits of α1,3-FucTVI (Calbiochem). The reaction products (GSP-6′ and GSP-6“) were purified by HPLC and analyzed by MS. Electrospray MS analysis showed the following molecular masses for the purified glycosulfopeptides: GSP-5′, 3925.7 Da (calc. 3925.8 Da); GSP-5”, 4290.9 Da (calc. 4290.9 Da); GSP-6′, 4217.8 Da (calc. 4218.1 Da); GSP-6“, 4729.8 Da (calc. 4729.3 Da). During the enzymatic synthesis of GSPs, the molecular masses of other intermediate peptide products shown in Fig. 2 were also verified by MS (data not shown). The enzymatic synthesis of GSP-6 and GP-6 has been described earlier (19Leppanen A. White S.P. Helin J. McEver R.P. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39569-39578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled glyco(sulfo)peptides were synthesized using GP-5, GSP-5, GSP-5′, and GSP-5“ as acceptors and GDP-[3H]Fuc (American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc., St. Louis, MO) as a donor in the α1,3-FucTVI reaction. [3H]GSP-5′ and [3H]GSP-5” were synthesized using GSP-4.2 and GSP-4.4 as acceptors and CMP-[3H]NeuAc (7130 cpm/pmol) (American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc.) as a donor in the α2,3-(N)-sialyltransferase reaction. The following specific activities of GDP-[3H]Fuc were used in the α1,3-FucTVI reactions: GP-5, 6300 cpm/pmol; GSP-5, 1000 cpm/pmol; GSP-5′; and GSP-5“, 2800 cpm/pmol. The radiolabeled products were purified by HPLC. Glyco(sulfo)peptide samples were filtered in a Spin-X membrane (Costar Corning Inc., Corning, NY) and purified in a semipreparative reversed phase C-18 HPLC column (10 μm; 10 × 250 mm) (Vydac, Hesperia, CA). Small aliquots from the glycosyltransferase reaction mixtures were analyzed in an analytical reversed phase C-18 HPLC column (5 μm; 4.6 × 250 mm) (Vydac) on a Beckman System Gold instrument. The following solvent systems were used in analytic separations at a flow rate of 1 ml/min: 1) 1–10 min, isocratic 15% aqueous acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; 10–70 min, linear gradient 15–40% aqueous acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; 2) 1–5 min, isocratic 15% aqueous acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; 5–70 min, linear gradient 15–30% aqueous acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Semipreparative HPLC separations were carried out at a flow rate of 3 ml/min using a linear 10–30% aqueous acetonitrile gradient containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (1–80 min). The UV absorbance at 215 nm was followed, and/or the radioactivity of the collected fractions (1 min) was measured. To prevent desulfation, GSP products eluted from HPLC were neutralized by adding NH4HCO3 before drying in a vacuum. The glycosyltransferase reaction mixtures containing the extended glycosulfopeptides GSP-4S.2 and GSP-4S.4 (∼100 nmol each) were treated overnight at 37 °C with 10 milliunits of neuraminidase from Vibrio cholerae (Roche Diagnostics) in 50 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 5.0, and 2 mmCaCl2. Reactions were terminated by boiling for 5 min. The samples were filtered through a Spin-X membrane, purified by HPLC, and analyzed by electrospray MS. [3H]GSP-6′ and [3H]GSP-6“ were desialylated using 2 milliunits of neuraminidase and purified by HPLC. Soluble P-selectin (sPS) was coupled to Ultralink Biosupport Medium (Pierce) at a density of 2 mg/ml. Radiolabeled glyco(sulfo)peptides (∼2000 cpm, 0.3–1 pmol) were chromatographed in the sPS column (0.9 ml, 0.5 × 4.5 cm) using physiological salt concentration (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.02% NaN3) as described (19Leppanen A.

The protected C-terminal Cys of glyco(sulfo)peptides (GSP-6, GSP-6′, GSP-6“, desialylated GSP-6′, desialylated GSP-6”, GSP-5′, GSP-5“, GSP-1, GP-6, and GP-4) was deprotected by treating each peptide with 2.5 or 5 mm dithiothreitol in 100 μl of 0.1m NH4HCO3 for 1–2 h at room temperature. Peptides were purified in HPLC and dried down in vacuum. Reduced peptides were biotinylated by incubating the peptides with a 10–20-fold molar excess of Biotin-HPDP (Pierce) in 100 μl of PBS containing 1 mm EDTA for 1–2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Biotinylated peptides were purified by HPLC. Alternatively, HPLC-purified, reduced peptides were biotinylated by incubating them with an ∼2.5-fold molar excess of Biotin-HPDP (N-(6-[biotinamido]hexyl)-3′-(2-pyridyldithio)propionamide in 100 μl of 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl and 1 mm EDTA. The completeness of the reaction was confirmed by HPLC, and the biotinylated peptides were directly used in a fluorescence solid phase assay without purification. Biotinylated glyco(sulfo)peptides were dissolved in 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, and the concentration of each peptide solution was determined by UV absorbance at 215 nm of a sample subjected to HPLC. Streptavidin-coated black 96-well microtiter plates (Pierce) were washed three times with 200 μl of 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.02% NaN3 (buffer A), or 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.02% NaN3 (buffer B) and coated for 1 h with 1 pmol of individual glyco(sulfo)peptide in 100 μl of buffer A or B.

https://openalex.org/W2032148588,"Many natural actions require the coordination of two different kinds of movements. How are targets chosen under these circumstances: do central commands instruct different movement systems in parallel, or does the execution of one movement activate a serial chain that automatically chooses targets for the other movement? We examined a natural eye tracking action that consists of orienting saccades and tracking smooth pursuit eye movements, and found strong physiological evidence for a serial strategy. Monkeys chose freely between two identical spots that appeared at different sites in the visual field and moved in orthogonal directions. If a saccade was evoked to one of the moving targets by microstimulation in either the frontal eye field (FEF) or the superior colliculus (SC), then the same target was automatically chosen for pursuit. Our results imply that the neural signals responsible for saccade execution can also act as an internal command of target choice for other movement systems."
https://openalex.org/W2077031503,"It has been recently described that some non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are able to induce the shedding of L-selectin in neutrophils, an adhesion molecule that plays an essential role in the inflammatory response. We have found that, according to this capability, NSAIDs could be grouped into three categories. A high releaser group (flufenamic, meclofenamic, and mefenamic acids, diclofenac and aceclofenac), a group of moderate releasers (aspirin, indomethacin, nimesulide, flurbiprofen, and ketoprofen), and a non-releaser group (phenylbutazone and the oxicams, piroxicam and meloxicam). Only NSAIDs from the high releaser group shared diphenylamine in their chemical structure. The amine group of this chemical agent proved to be essential for the anti-L-selectin activity of diphenylamine-based NSAIDs. The presence of a carboxylic acid group in the diphenylamine (N-phenylanthranilic acid) highly increased its ability to reduce the L-selectin surface expression in neutrophils. Diphenylamine andN-phenylanthranilic acid neither affected COX activity in platelets nor modified the activation state of neutrophils. Diphenylamine-related compounds, which include the diphenylamine-based NSAIDs caused a variable reduction in the neutrophil intracellular ATP concentration, which correlated with the differential ability of such compounds to trigger L-selectin shedding (r = 0.97, p < 0.01). Diphenylamine-related compounds failed to down-regulate L-selectin in a tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme (TACE)-deficient murine monocytic cell line. Our data indicate that diphenylamine seems to be the structural core of NSAIDs accounting for their down-regulatory activity of L-selectin leukocyte expression.

Transmigration of flowing neutrophils through vascular endothelium and its accumulation into inflamed tissues requires that highly coordinated adhesive events take place between neutrophils and endothelial cells, a process commonly known as adhesion cascade. Members of three major families of adhesion receptors have been implicated in this cascade: selectins, integrins, and the immunoglobulin superfamily (1Butcher E.C. Cell. 1991; 67: 1033-1036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar, 2Springer T.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6414) Google Scholar, 3Shimizu Y.

Many efforts in medicine are currently aimed to the development of antagonists of adhesion receptors, a therapeutic approach known as anti-adhesive therapy. The assumption of this therapy is that, if any of sequential steps of the adhesion cascade is inhibited, the inflammatory response is suppressed or, at least, ameliorated because the cascade cannot be completed (6Travis J. Science. 1993; 260: 906-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 7Featherstone C. Lancet. 1996; 347: 1106Abstract PubMed Google Scholar). The anti-adhesive therapy that specifically blocks members of the selectin family has already proved beneficial in several animal models of inflammation (8Mihelcic D. Schleiffenbaum B. Tedder T.F.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)1 are a heterogeneous group of chemical compounds clustered in different chemical families that show differences in both clinical response and pharmacokinetic profile (12Simon L.S.

Used in clinics throughout this century, NSAIDs continue to be an important therapeutic intervention for patients with disorders that cause pain, fever, or moderate inflammation. The inhibition of the prostaglandin synthesis through the blockade of cyclooxygenase (COX) has been widely accepted as the mechanism of action of these compounds (15Vane J.R. Nature. 1971; 231: 232-235Crossref Scopus (7367) Google Scholar). However, during the last decade, many groups have described a number of non-prostaglandin-mediated anti-inflammatory effects of NSAIDs, suggesting that COX inhibition does not represent the only explanation for the anti-inflammatory action of this group of therapeutic agents (16Abramson S.B.

In this regard, it has been proposed that several NSAIDs are able to interfere with the function of adhesion molecules that participate in the adhesion cascade (21Dı́az-González F. Sánchez-Madrid F. Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 169-172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In neutrophils, some of these agents induce the down-regulation of L-selectin (22Dı́az-González F. González-Alvaro I. Campanero M.R. Mollinedo F. del Pozo M.A. Muñoz C. Pivel J.P.

Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6414) Google Scholar). Remarkably, this effect of NSAIDs on L-selectin expression is not a common characteristic of this group of agents, because a number of them do not modify the basal expression of this adhesion molecule (21Dı́az-González F. Sánchez-Madrid F. Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 169-172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 22Dı́az-González F. González-Alvaro I. Campanero M.R.

These data strongly suggest that a chemical structure present in only a limited group of NSAIDs is responsible for the L-selectin shedding activity that these compounds exert in neutrophils. Upon cell activation, L-selectin is enzymatically cleaved by the action of a surface metalloprotease that belongs to the ADAM (a desintegrin and metalloprotease domain) family, the TNF-α-converting enzyme (TACE, ADAM-17 or CD156b) (24Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Reddy P. Stocking K.L. Sunnarborg S.W. Lee D.C. Russell W.E. Castner B.J. Johnson R.S. Fitzner J.N. Boyce R.W. Nelson N. Kozlosky C.J. Wolfson M.F. Rauch C.T. Cerretti D.P. Paxton R.J. March C.J. Black R.A. Science. 1998; 282: 1281-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar). Although the effect of NSAIDs on L-selectin seems to be linked to the uncoupling capability of these agents (25Gómez-Gaviro M.V. Domı́nguez-Jiménez C. Carretero J.M. Sabando P. González-Alvaro I. Sánchez-Madrid F. Dı́az-González F. Blood. 2000; 96: 3592-3600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the molecular mechanisms, including the role of metalloproteases, involved in the down-regulation of L-selectin by NSAIDs remains to be clarified. This work aims to: 1) identify the chemical structure responsible for the shedding of L-selectin induced by NSAIDs and 2) characterize the molecular mechanisms involved in this effect of NSAIDs in leukocytes. We report here that diphenylamine is the structural core responsible for such effect of NSAIDs. This chemical is able by itself to down-regulate in vitro the L-selectin expression in neutrophils without interfering with either cell activation or COX activity, and this effect on L-selectin expression seems to be linked to the capability of diphenylamine and related compounds to uncouple the oxidative phosphorylation. Finally, TACE is involved in the shedding of L-selectin induced by NSAIDs. The following monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were used: Bear-1 anti-CD11b, TP1/40 anti-CD11a, TP1/15 anti-CD31, D3/9 anti-CD45, Mo-2 anti-CD14, and P3X63 myeloma culture supernatant as a negative control (26Lacal P.

Human neutrophils were isolated from peripheral blood of healthy donors by Ficoll-Hypaque (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) density gradient centrifugation for 30 min at 1800 rpm, followed by sedimentation at 1 ×g in 1.3% (w/v) dextran (Sigma Chemical Co.) at room temperature for 20 min. The neutrophil-enriched fraction was further purified by hypotonic lysis of erythrocytes, giving a purity of higher than 95%. In experiments with mononuclear cells, after Ficoll-Hypaque density centrifugation the mononuclear band was recovered, washed twice with phosphate buffer solution (PBS) and used without any further purification. Wild type (DRM+/+) and TACE-deficient (DRM−/−) immortalized murine monocytes (29Rovida E. Paccagnini A. Del Rosso M. Peschon J. Dello Sbarba P. J.

DRM cells are loosely adherents and were passaged by gently scraping after reaching a density of ∼2 × 106 cell/ml. Experiments on the effect of NSAIDs on the expression of adhesion molecules were carried out in 15-ml disposable polypropylene tubes (Falcon Labware, Oxnard, CA). Except where indicated, neutrophils were resuspended at 106 cells/ml in Hanks' balanced salt solution and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of 50 μm of diphenylamine, N-phenylanthranilic acid, diphenylacetic acid, and all NSAIDs except aspirin, which was used at 2 mm. In some experiments, cells were maintained at 4 °C during the incubation time. Time-course experiments on L-selectin expression were carried out with 50 μm of aceclofenac, flufenamic acid, N-phenylanthranilic acid, diphenylacetic acid, or diphenylamine for 5–90 min at 37 °C. When dose-response experiments were performed, neutrophils were incubated with the different compounds at doses ranging from 3 to 50 μm for 15 min at 37 °C. PMA was used at 20 ng/ml in neutrophils and at 100 ng/ml in experiments with DRM cells. In experiments with inhibitor, cells were pretreated with IC-3 at doses ranging from 5 to 50 μm or in medium alone for 15 min at 37 °C. Then,N-phenylanthranilic acid, diphenylacetic acid, diphenylamine, or meclofenamic acid at 50 μm were added, and neutrophils were incubated for another additional 15 min at 37 °C. All compounds were solubilized in Me2SO (Panreac, Barcelona, Spain) and added to the cell solution in a final concentration below 0.2% of Me2SO. All control data were obtained in the presence of 0.2% Me2SO. Cells were treated as described above and then incubated with the different mAbs at 4 °C for 30 min. After washing in PBS, cells were labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse Ig (Dako, Salstrup, Denmark). At least 5 × 103 cells of each sample were analyzed in a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson), and data were collected in both linear and logarithmic scales. In experiments with mononuclear cells, the L-selectin expression was analyzed in cells with side and forward scatter characteristics of either lymphocytes or monocytes separately. In these two populations, CD14-positive cells were below 5% and up to 90% in regions with lymphocyte and monocyte characteristics, respectively. Mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) in linear scale was obtained adjusting the fluorescence gain so that about 5% of the cells of the sample with greatest fluorescence were positive in the highest fluorescence channel. The fluorescence produced by the myeloma P3X63 supernatant was considered as the background. Because the fluorescence conditions were different from experiment to experiment, data were normalized to express relative mean fluorescence intensity (rMFI), as follows, rMFI=(MFIcompound−MFIP3X63)/(MFImedium−MFIP3X63)×100Equation 1 In representative experiments, cell viability was determined in the FACScan through the spontaneous uptake of propidium iodine (10 μg/ml final concentration) (Sigma Chemical Co). Thromboxane B2, the stable end product of thromboxane A2 generation, was determined in gel-filtered platelets in the presence or absence of the different compounds. Briefly, platelet isolation was carried out at room temperature from normal human venous blood mixed with buffered sodium citrate (0.13 m) in the proportion 10:1. Platelet-rich plasma was obtained by centrifugation of whole blood at 1100 rpm for 10 min and applied to a Sepharose 2B column equilibrated with saline. Gel-filtered platelets were incubated with the different NSAIDs (50 μm, except for aspirin 2 mm),N-phenylanthranilic or diphenylacetic acids (0.1 mm) for 15 min at 37 °C and then activated with 1 mm arachidonic acid for 5 min at 37 °C. The reaction was quenched by addition of ice-cold ethanol, and the samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min at room temperature. The ethanol of the supernatant was evaporated using a lyophilizer, and the pellet was resuspended in the immunoassay buffer. Thromboxane B2concentration ([TxB2]) in supernatants was measured with a quantitative TxB2 immunoassay according to the manufacturer's protocol (R&D Systems Europe, Abingdon, UK). Data were normalized to express inhibition of TxB2production as follows, %inhibition=([TxB2medium]−[TxB2compound]/[TxB2medium])×100Equation 2 Intracellular ATP concentration in neutrophils was measured with an ATP Bioluminescence Assay kit obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany). Neutrophils (7 × 106 cells/ml) were incubated in PBS alone and in the presence of the different compounds at doses indicated. After 15 min at 37 °C, cells were pelleted and resuspended in the lysis buffer provided with the kit. ATP was assayed following the manufacturer's instructions and measured in a luminophotometer (Lumat LB9501, Berthold, Wildbad, Germany). Data were normalized to express the variation of the intracellular ATP concentration ([ATP]) as follows, %variation in[ATP]:([ATPcompound]/[ATPmedium])×100Equation 3 Results were expressed as arithmetic mean ± S.D. Student's t test for paired samples was used to determine significant differences between means. L-selectin is constitutively expressed on essentially all leukocytes, and it is cleaved and released from cell surface in response to a variety of stimuli (31Carlos T. Harlan J. Blood. 1994; 84: 2068-2101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously described that several NSAIDs, although not all, are able to induce the shedding of L-selectin in neutrophils (22Dı́az-González F. González-Alvaro I. Campanero M.R.

Sabando P. González-Alvaro I. Sánchez-Madrid F. Dı́az-González F. Blood. 2000; 96: 3592-3600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We decided to expand these studies by testing, in addition to previously described agents, non-assayed NSAIDs such as nimesulide, nabumetone, flurbiprofen, and meclofenamic acid in an attempt to determine how common this effect on L-selectin expression was among the different families of NSAIDs. NSAIDs derived from both arylcarboxylic acids (the fenamates: flufenamic, meclofenamic, and mefenamic acids) and arylalkanoic acids (aceclofenac and diclofenac) induced the strongest reduction in the basal expression of L-selectin in neutrophils (range, 90–60%) (Fig.1, A and B). Aspirin, the propionic acid derivatives ketoprofen and flurbiprofen, nimesulide, as well as the indole-acetic acid derivative indomethacin, also promoted the down-regulation of L-selectin in neutrophils but to a lower extent, (range, 30–15%) (Fig. 1, A andB). However, NSAIDs derived from enolic acids such as pyrazolones (phenylbutazone) and oxicams (piroxicam and meloxicam) as well as the active metabolite of the non-acidic NSAID nabumetone, the 6-MNA, not only reduced but instead seemed to slightly increase the basal expression of L-selectin in neutrophils (Fig. 1 B). When the L-selectin expression was assessed in neutrophils maintained in medium at 4 °C, it was significantly higher (about a 25%) than that obtained at 37 °C in medium alone (Fig. 1 B). Neutrophils treated with whatever NSAIDs, including the enolic acids, showed a lesser neutrophil L-selectin expression than the basal at 4 °C. When NSAIDs were assayed at 4 °C, no modification of the basal expression of L-selectin was observed in neutrophils (data not shown). Interestingly, none of the NSAIDs tested was able to modify the basal expression of other adhesion molecules that play a relevant role in the adhesion cascade such as CD11a or CD31 (data not shown). These data indicate that currently available NSAIDs can be divided in three categories according to their ability to release L-selectin from the neutrophil surface: high, moderate, and non-releaser NSAIDs. In addition, the effector mechanism through which these compounds induce the shedding of L-selectin is temperature-sensitive. The foregoing experiments suggested that a chemical structure shared by all members of the high releaser group but absent in the non-releaser group of NSAIDs might be responsible for the L-selectin shedding activity of these agents. The comparative analysis between the strength of NSAIDs in the induction of L-selectin down-regulation (Fig. 1 B) and their formulas (Fig.2 A) suggests that the diphenylamine, a compound formed by two benzene rings joined by an amine group, was the chemical structure core common to and exclusively present in the high releaser NSAIDs (Fig. 2 A). Then, we decided to assay the effect of diphenylamine itself as well as diphenylacetic acid and N-phenylanthranilic acid (Fig.2 B), two chemical compounds structurally related to diphenylamine, on neutrophil L-selectin expression. The diphenylamine and the N-phenylanthranilic acid (diphenylamine structure with a carboxylic radical in position 2), two compounds without known anti-inflammatory properties, induced a clear-cut time- and dose-dependent L-selectin down-regulation in neutrophils. In contrast, the diphenylacetic acid, two benzene rings joined by the acetic acid, did not induce any significant change in the L-selectin expression in neutrophils, even at prolonged exposure time or at high doses (Fig.3, A and B).N-Phenylanthranilic acid showed to be as potent as flufenamic acid in the induction of L-selectin down-regulation in neutrophils after 40 min of incubation (Fig. 3 A), whereas diphenylamine showed a moderate effect (about 50% of decrement). These data strongly suggest that diphenylamine represents the skeleton structure responsible for the L-selectin shedding activity of NSAIDs. The fact that some NSAIDs but not others were able to shed L-selectin strongly suggested that the common characteristics of this family of therapeutic agents, the inhibition of COX activity, must not account for this phenomenon. However, to rule out this possibility, we tested the effect of different NSAIDs,N-phenylanthranilic and diphenylacetic acids, on a well-established experimental model to determine the COX-1 activity, the thromboxane B2 (TxB2) release induced by arachidonic acid in platelets. It was found that there was no relationship between the capability of NSAIDs to inhibit COX-1 activity and to shed L-selectin. Indomethacin and aspirin, agents included in the group of moderate releasers (Fig. 1 B), caused almost a complete TxB2 release inhibition in platelets (Fig. 4 A). Both aceclofenac and meloxicam showed a poor inhibition (about 30%) of TxB2 production (Fig. 4 A). Finally, neitherN-phenylanthranilic acid nor diphenylacetic acid showed any effect on COX activity in platelets (Fig. 4 A). These data exclude a role of COX-1 activity in the down-regulation of L-selectin by NSAIDs. Upon activation, L-selectin is enzymatically cleaved from neutrophils cell surface both in vitro (32Berg M.

Variations in the expression of CD11b and CD45, two glycoproteins contained in the membrane of secretory granules of neutrophils, can be considered as an indirect measurement of neutrophil activation (26Lacal P. Pulido R. Sanchez-Madrid F. Mollinedo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9946-9951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Sengelov H. Kjeldsen L. Diamond M.S. Springer T.A. Borregaard N. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1467-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 B, neitherN-phenylanthranilic acid, diphenylamine, nor diphenylacetic acid caused any significant effect on CD11b basal expression on neutrophils. Similar results were obtained when the CD45 expression was studied (data not shown). These data demonstrate that the ability of diphenylamine-based NSAIDs to induce the down-regulation of L-selectin from the cell surface of neutrophils is neither a prostaglandin-dependent nor an unspecific cell activation effect. It is well known that NSAIDs are able to uncouple the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation reducing the intracellular ATP synthesis (20Mahmud T. Rafi S.S. Scott D.L. Wrigglesworth J.M. Bjarnason I. Arthritis Rheum. 1996; 39: 1998-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 36Mingatto F.E. Santos A.C. Uyemura S.A. Jordani M.C. Curti C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 334: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Recently, our group has proposed that the maintenance of L-selectin on the neutrophil surface requires energy consumption and that the capability of NSAIDs to reduce the energy status of the cell might account for the ability of these agents to induce the shedding of L-selectin in human neutrophils (25Gómez-Gaviro M.V. Domı́nguez-Jiménez C. Carretero J.M. Sabando P. González-Alvaro I. Sánchez-Madrid F. Dı́az-González F. Blood. 2000; 96: 3592-3600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because it has been demonstrated that both diphenylamine andN-phenylanthranilic acid are uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria (37Masubuchi Y. Yamada S. Horie T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 58: 861-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), we decided to test the potential relationship between variations in the intracellular ATP concentration and L-selectin expression in neutrophils induced by diphenylamine-based compounds. Meclofenamic acid, diphenylamine, andN-phenylanthranilic acid, but not diphenylacetic acid, decreased the intracellular ATP concentration (Fig.5 A), and a significant direct correlation was observed between variations in intracellular ATP and surface expression of L-selectin in neutrophils (Fig.5 B; r = 0.97, p < 0.01). These results suggest that the diphenylamine chemical structure plays an important role in the uncoupling effect of NSAIDs with diphenylamine skeleton. In addition, these data indicate that diphenylamine-based compounds might exert their action on L-selectin expression in neutrophils through a mechanism coupled to the reduction of oxidative phosphoryl"

Here, we used error-prone PCR to mutagenize the full-length human TS cDNA and then selected mutants resistant to 5-fluorodeoxyuridine in a bacterial complementation system. We found that resistant mutants contained 1–5 amino acid substitutions and that these substitutions were located along the entire length of the polypeptide. Mutations were frequent near the active site Cys195 and in the catalytically important Arg50 loop; however, many mutations were also distributed throughout the remainder of the cDNA. Mutants containing a single amino acid replacement identified the following 14 residues as unreported sites of resistance: Glu23, Thr51, Thr53, Val84, Lys93, Asp110, Asp116, Pro194, Ser206, Met219, His250, Asp254, Tyr258, and Lys284. Many of these residues are distant from the active site and/or have no documented function in catalysis or resistance. We conclude that mutations distributed throughout the linear sequence and three-dimensional structure of human TS can confer resistance to 5-fluorodeoxyuridine. Our findings imply that long range interactions within proteins affect catalysis at the active site and that mutations at a distance can yield variant proteins with desired properties.

The enzyme catalyzes reductive methylation of dUMP by (6R)-N 5,N 10-methylene-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate ((6R)-CH2H4-folate)) to produce dTMP and dihydrofolate. Inactivation of TS results in depletion of thymidine pools, inhibition of DNA synthesis, and subsequent cell death (1Carreras C.W. Santi D.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 721-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 2Ahmad S.I. Kirk S.H. Eisenstark A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1998; 52: 591-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In accord with its mechanism of action, toxicity associated with TS inhibition is greatest in actively dividing cells, including many types of cancer cells. For this reason, TS has been a major target for the development of cancer chemotherapeutic agents.Fluoropyrimidine-based analogs, such as 5-fluorouracil and 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (5-FdUR), are widely utilized for the treatment of advanced cancers. These analogs are metabolized to 5-fluorodeoxyuridylate (5-FdUMP), which forms a stable inhibitory complex with the 72-kDa TS homodimer and CH2H4-folate. Currently, new folate analogs are also being tested as specific inhibitors of TS (3Rustum Y.M. Harstrick A. Cao S. Vanhoefer U. Yin M.B. Wilke H. Seeber S. J. Clin. Oncol. 1997; 15: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 4Danenberg P.V. Malli H. Swenson S. Semin. Oncol. 1999; 26: 621-631PubMed Google Scholar). These anti-folates interact with the folate-binding site to interfere with the utilization of the normal substrate, CH2H4-folate.Use of TS inhibitors as chemotherapeutic agents is frequently limited by toxicity to bone marrow cells. Introduction of a drug-resistant TS into bone marrow stem cells could protect patients from the severe side effects of TS inhibitors. Based on this premise, mutations have been identified that render human TS resistant to 5-fluoropyrimidines and anti-folate analogs (5Landis D.M. Loeb L.A. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1063-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Nearly all of these mutations map within the catalytic site. We have previously created 5-FdUR-resistant mutants by substituting random nucleotides for codons specifying amino acids adjacent to the catalytic cysteine (Cys195) that is responsible for methyl transfer; these mutants include A197F, C199L, several replacements at Val204, and Q211L (5Landis D.M. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25809-25817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We similarly created 5-FdUR-resistant mutants in the highly conserved Arg50 loop that undergoes reorientation on dUMP binding to accept the incoming folate molecule; these mutants include replacements at Lys47, Asp48, and Gly52 (6Landis D.M. Heindel C.C. Loeb L.A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 666-672PubMed Google Scholar). Earlier work involving mutagenesis of human HT1080 cells with ethylmethane sulfonate, followed by selection with the anti-folate Thymitaq (AG337), yielded three Arg50 loop mutants (D49G, G52S, and K47E) that were resistant to both the anti-folate and 5-FdUR (7Tong Y. Liu-Chen X. Ercikan-Abali E.A. Capiaux G.M. Zhao S.C. Banerjee D. Bertino J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11611-11618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Two other mutants that are resistant to both anti-folates and 5-FdUR, I108A and F225W, were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis of highly conserved residues important in folate binding (8Tong Y. Liu-Chen X. Ercikan-Abali E.A. Zhao S.C. Banerjee D. Maley F. Bertino J.R. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1063-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) that are not within the active site yet render human TS resistant to 5-FdUR. One of the first TS mutants discovered to confer 5-FdUR resistance was heterozygously expressed in the colon cancer cell line HCT116 (9Barbour K.W. Hoganson D.K. Berger S.H. Berger F.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 242-248PubMed Google Scholar). This mutant contains a single substitution, Y33H, within a loop near the amino terminus of the protein, at a distance from the catalytic site. The other mutation found in a 5-FdUR-resistant cell line was determined to encode a P303L substitution. Although metabolically unstable, the P303L protein was nonetheless able to confer resistance against both 5-FdUR- and anti-folate-based TS inhibitors in transfected cells (10Kitchens M.E. Forsthoefel A.M. Barbour K.W. Spencer H.T. Berger F.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1063-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Like Y33H, the P303L substitution is not in close proximity to the catalytic site as determined from crystal structures (11Schiffer C.A. Clifton I.J. Davisson V.J. Santi D.V. Stroud R.M.

J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 813-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).The hypothesis guiding this study is that amino acid substitutions in human TS that yield 5-FdUR resistance can be located throughout the protein. This hypothesis is based on two considerations. The first is the existence of at least two single mutations in human TS that lie distant from the active site and also confer 5-FdUR resistance (9Barbour K.W. Hoganson D.K. Berger S.H. Berger F.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 242-248PubMed Google Scholar, 10Kitchens M.E. Forsthoefel A.M. Barbour K.W. Spencer H.T. Berger F.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1063-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The second is that microfluctuations throughout the protein, arising from the inherent flexibility of the backbone structure, may be required for maintaining substrate specificity during catalysis and may be affected by mutations distant from the catalytic site. To assess our hypothesis, we examined the distribution of amino acid substitutions that confer 5-FdUR resistance by using error-prone PCR to introduce mutations throughout the full length of the human TS cDNA. Mutations associated with resistance were then isolated by transfecting plasmids encoding the mutant enzymes into TS-deficientEscherichia coli and selecting for growth in the presence of 5-FdUR. Many of the mutant genes we thus created encode catalytically active TS, render E. coli 5-FdUR-resistant, and contain multiple substitutions. Among the TS variants containing a single amino acid substitution, we identified replacements at residues that have not been previously reported to be sites of resistance in human TS. In fact, this study more than doubles the number of single amino acid substitutions in human TS that have been demonstrated to yield 5-FdUR resistance. Moreover, in accord with our hypothesis, single mutations that render TS resistant to 5-FdUR were distributed throughout the protein. Whereas some of the amino acids we identified are located within the active site, others reside at a distance and have no previously recognized involvement in catalysis or 5-FdUR resistance.DISCUSSIONA major goal of work on human TS is to elucidate the structural and mechanistic bases of interactions with inhibitors, such as 5-FdUR, that are used as cancer chemotherapeutic agents. This goal is important for understanding both basic structure-function relationships in TS and drug resistance. Efforts to understand 5-FdUR resistance include the creation and analysis of resistant mutants, and this approach has centered on amino acid substitutions in catalytically important regions of the protein (e.g. Refs. 5Landis D.M. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25809-25817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 6Landis D.M. Heindel C.C. Loeb L.A.

Here, we used a different strategy, based on the hypothesis that amino acid replacements yielding 5-FdUR resistance are located throughout the TS primary sequence. We used error-prone PCR to mutagenize the entire human TS cDNA and isolated 35 resistant mutants in an E. coli-based complementation assay. In fact, we did find that the resistant variants, listed in Table II, harbor substitutions throughout the linear sequence (Fig. 2) and three-dimensional structure (Fig. 4) of the protein. Some of the 74 different replacements (or combinations thereof) are responsible for 5-FdUR resistance, including the substitutions in single mutants, whereas other replacements are presumably co-selected and not relevant to resistance. Recent crystallographic analyses of TS, especially closed ternary complexes with dUMP and folate-based inhibitors (14Phan J. Koli S. Minor W. Dunlap R.B. Berger S.H. Lebioda L.

Possible resistance mechanisms can be envisioned for some of the replacements, whereas no mechanisms are apparent for others. For example, substitution of valine for glutamate in the D48V mutant would disrupt the hydrogen bonding network within the Arg50 loop that mediates dUMP binding and also affect interactions with the second subunit of the obligate homodimer (14Phan J. Koli S. Minor W. Dunlap R.B. Berger S.H. Lebioda L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1897-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 16Sayre P.H. Finer-Moore J.S. Fritz T.A. Biermann D. Gates S.B. MacKellar W.C. Patel V.F. Stroud R.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 813-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar); it has been proposed that mutations at residues 47–52 may confer resistance by destabilizing the closed ternary complex (16Sayre P.H. Finer-Moore J.S. Fritz T.A. Biermann D. Gates S.B. MacKellar W.C. Patel V.F. Stroud R.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 813-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). At position 84 in the V84A mutant, wild-type valine interacts with two residues, Phe80 and Phe225, that contact the cofactor. Altered interactions with folate are known to confer 5-FdUR resistance (8Tong Y. Liu-Chen X. Ercikan-Abali E.A. Zhao S.C. Banerjee D. Maley F. Bertino J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31209-31214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and could account for the resistance in the mutant. At position 110, wild-type aspartate interacts with Trp109, which in turn interacts with both dUMP and co-factor, perhaps accounting for resistance of the D110E mutant. At position 194 in the active site, wild-type proline interacts with the catalytic cysteine, presumably accounting for the resistance of the P194L mutant. At position 250, wild-type histidine interacts with several residues that contact dUMP, including Asp226, presumably accounting for the resistance of the H250L mutant. In contrast, resistance mechanisms for the single mutants E23G, K93E, S206G, and K284N are not apparent. As shown in Fig. 4, E23G is in the disordered N-terminal region, whereas K93E, S206G, and K284N are located in loops at the periphery of the TS monomer and have no obvious relationship to catalysis or resistance.By using site-directed mutagenesis to create single mutants, we showed that several amino acids that were replaced in multiply mutated PCR variants are authentic sites of 5-FdUR. Among these site-directed replacements is T51S, the most common mutation we have previously observed and present in the highly resistant variant T51S, G52S (6Landis D.M. Heindel C.C. Loeb L.A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 666-672PubMed Google Scholar). Thr51 participates in hydrogen bonding within the Arg50 loop and with Val313 after ligand-induced conformational changes of the C-terminal segment (1Carreras C.W. Santi D.V. Annu. Rev.

J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 813-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar); 5-FdUR resistance could arise at Thr51 from several mechanisms, including an effect on this conformational change. Two replacements at Asp254 (D254N and D254E) were observed in multiply mutated variants (255, 318, 358), and we found that both, as well as the D254A substitution, conferred resistance as single mutations (Fig.3 C). Asp254 is hydrogen-bonded to His256, which is in turn hydrogen-bonded to dUMP-binding Arg175′ in the second subunit; 5-FdUR resistance may arise from disruption of these interactions. We also observed that each replacement in the double mutant T53S,Y258S conferred resistance as a single mutation (Fig. 3 B). Whereas the resistance of T53S may be attributable to disturbance of hydrogen bonding in the Arg50 loop, the resistance of Y258F is probably due to loss of hydrogen bonding between the tyrosine hydroxyl group and dUMP and/or Arg175′. Interestingly, the Y261F substitution (analogous to the Y258F replacement that we obtained here) was not tested among the 14 L. casei TS mutants previously examined (26Climie S. Ruiz-Perez L. Gonzalez-Pacanowska D. Prapunwattana P. Cho S.W. Stroud R. Santi D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18776-18779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The D116A substitution, like some of the PCR-generated single replacements, lies at the surface of the protein, and its contacts do not suggest why it confers resistance. Last, the M219V replacement affects Met219, which has multiple contacts with Tyr33, a known site of resistance, and with His256, which interacts with dUMP.Replacements in Multiply Mutated VariantsThe resistance arising from multiple substitutions is difficult to analyze. Nonetheless, evaluation of the replacements in the double and higher mutants listed in Table II and Fig. 2 can afford potentially useful inferences and point to particular amino acids for further examination. It is a logical assumption that regions where mutations cluster may have special relevance for resistance. One such region includes residues Val45–Thr55 constituting the Arg50 loop. Wild-type residues at the six mutated positions (positions 45, 48, 51, and 53–55) participate in a network of interactions, primarily hydrogen bonding, within the loop and also between the Arg50 loop and the second subunit that contains dUMP-binding residues 175′ and 176′. Replacements at these six positions might affect interactions with both dUMP and 5-FdUMP and also destabilize the ternary complex (16Sayre P.H. Finer-Moore J.S. Fritz T.A. Biermann D. Gates S.B. MacKellar W.C. Patel V.F. Stroud R.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 813-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), thereby conferring resistance. A conspicuous cluster of mutations was noted at positions Arg78–Leu88, where seven residues harbor nine different replacements. Phe80 in this region interacts with the cofactor, whereas Glu87 may have destabilizing interactions with both the cofactor and dUMP. Wild-type amino acids at four mutated positions (positions 78, 81, 82, and 84) contact Phe80, whereas those at three mutated positions (positions 84, 85, and 88) interact with Glu87. Altered interactions with folate and/or dUMP may account for the resistance conferred by replacements in this region. Of particular interest with respect to folate binding is the occurrence of the M311L replacement in the double mutant 217. Met311, together with three wild-type residues that yield 5-FdUR-resistant mutants (8Tong Y. Liu-Chen X. Ercikan-Abali E.A. Zhao S.C. Banerjee D. Maley F. Bertino J.R. J. Biol.

A third group of 14 replacements was observed in the N-terminal 27 amino acids, which are disordered in crystal structures (1Carreras C.W. Santi D.V. Annu. Rev.

J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 813-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This observation raises the possibility that at least some wild-type amino acids in the N-terminal region may have an unrecognized function(s) in 5-FdUR resistance, a possibility substantiated by identification of the single mutant E23G. A related possibility is that the N terminus may have a specific function(s) and an ordered structure(s) in conformational states that have not been captured in existing crystals.Another possible source of 5-FdUR resistance in multiply mutated variants is altered interactions between the subunits of the obligate TS homodimer; these interactions may be important for positioning of dUMP-binding residues in one or both subunits and may thus affect 5-FdUR resistance. For example, Val45 in the Arg50 loop interacts with Val204 in the second subunit, and we have previously isolated a 5-FdUR-resistant V204D mutant (5Landis D.M. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25809-25817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The Val204–Val45 hydrophobic interaction was disrupted in four different multiply substituted mutants isolated here, two involving Val45 (mutants 255 and 326) and two involving Val 204 (mutants 316 and 359). In another example of subunit interactions, Glu211 resides at the dimer interface where it contacts Phe59 from the second subunit. We have previously identified the 5-FdUR resistance mutation Q211L in a single mutant (5Landis D.M. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25809-25817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and isolated it again here in the triple mutant 313.All told, we can offer a plausible structure-based suggestion for the resistance of most of the 35 mutants in Table II, although only 5 of 29 contain a single substitution. These mutants contain a replacement at a position where the wild-type residue is either (a) in direct contact with dUMP or a residue that contacts dUMP, and/or (b) in direct contact with folate or a residue that contacts folate, and/or (c) interacts with the second subunit at the dimer interface. We and others have previously documented 5-FdUR resistance mutations in these three categories (5Landis D.M. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25809-25817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 6Landis D.M. Heindel C.C. Loeb L.A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 666-672PubMed Google Scholar, 7Tong Y.

We rationalize our observations concerning resistance mutations at ligand-interacting residues as follows. Wild-type amino acids that interact directly with substrates or co-factors are likely to be important for catalytic activity and to yield relatively few replacements that conserve catalytic efficiency, alter substrate/inhibitor preference, and afford resistance. This relative lack of mutability notwithstanding, we and others have identified drug resistance mutations at such residues by intensive, targeted mutagenesis. On the other hand, residues that contact ligand-interacting residues may yield a relatively large number of substitutions that simultaneously preserve activity, modulate substrate/inhibitor interactions, and confer drug resistance; mutations at such residues may be highly prevalent in the present work, where each residue in the protein has a limited probability of being substituted.We can also suggest possible sources of 5-FdUR resistance for the four single amino acid replacements that are far removed from the active site in current crystal structures. We have discussed the E23G mutation in the disordered N-terminal segment and noted that three others (K93E, S206G, and K284N) are located in loops at the surface of the monomer (Fig. 4). If TS functions in a multiprotein complex in vivo, these loops may be involved in protein-protein interactions that alter the conformation of TS and affect resistance indirectly. It is also possible that the loops are involved in the conformational dynamics of the protein and affect motions that influence the probability of reactions at the active site (27Osborne M.J. Schnell J. Benkovic S.J. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9846-9859Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Studies of single enzyme molecules by confocal fluorescence spectroscopy indicate that enzymes undergo sets of transient oscillations during each catalytic step (28Edman L. Rigler R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8266-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Amino acid substitutions at a distance may affect these oscillations and thereby alter substrate and inhibitor discrimination at the active site. Perhaps yet-to-be determined mechanisms that govern conformational changes during catalysis can be affected by amino acid replacements throughout the protein.Summary StatementA major conclusion of this work is that amino acid replacements dispersed throughout the linear sequence and three-dimensional structure of TS can confer resistance to 5-FdUR and hence affect discrimination at the active site. It is possible that a comparable multiplicity of residues may affect discrimination and additional functions at the active site of other proteins as well. This possibility has important implications for the study of structure-function relationships and for the design of mutagenesis studies intended to create mutant proteins with desired properties. Our results suggest that efforts to understand protein function and to create new variants with desired attributes might profitably include approaches such as the one illustrated here that explore mutation of entire proteins without preconception.

We reported that a seven-amino acid sequence (547–553 of rat GR) overlapping the amino-terminal end of the ligand binding domain is required for hsp90 binding to GR. We have now conducted saturation mutagenesis of this sequence, which appears to be part of the surface where the ligand binding cleft merges with the surface of the ligand binding domain. No single point mutation causes significant changes in any of a variety of biochemical and biological properties in addition to hsp90 binding. A triple mutation (P548A/T549A/V551A) increases by >100-fold the steroid concentration required for half-maximal induction without affecting the level of maximal induction or coactivator response. Interestingly, this triple mutant displays reduced binding of steroid and hsp90 in whole cells, but it possesses wild type affinity for steroid and normal hsp90 binding capacity under cell-free conditions. This phenotype of a dramatic shift in the dose response for transactivation would be expected from an increase in the rate of disassembly of the triple mutant GR·hsp90 heterocomplex in the cell.

Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1537) Google Scholar). One GR function that is absolutely hsp90-dependent is steroid binding activity (2Bresnick E.H. Dalman F.C.

Chem. 1992; 267: 14047-14053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Steroid binding is the first in a series of steps by which GR translates the intracellular concentration of steroid hormone into altered levels of selected, biologically active proteins. Accordingly, hsp90 was shown to be essential for the steroid-induced activity of the GR in yeast (4Picard D. Khursheed B. Garabedian M.J. Fortin M.G. Lindquist S. Yamamoto K.R. Nature. 1990; 348: 166-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). When the GR is stripped of its associated hsp90, it immediately loses its ability to bind steroid, and steroid binding activity is regenerated when GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes are reformed by the hsp90/hsp70-based chaperone machinery (5Morishima Y.

Steroid ligands bind deep in a hydrophobic cleft that appears to be collapsed in the absence of ligand, such that the receptor must change its conformation to allow entry of the ligand (7Gee A.C. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Hsp90 binds to the ligand binding domain (LBD) of the receptors (1Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1537) Google Scholar), and the hsp90/hsp70-based chaperone machinery carries out an ATP-dependent opening of the binding cleft in the GR LBD such that it can be accessed by steroid. In addition to opening the steroid binding cleft, hsp90 promotes conformational changes that increase the sensitivity of the GR LBD to attack by thiol derivatizing agents and trypsin (8Stancato L.F.

It was originally found that the entire LBD of the glucocorticoid or progesterone receptor had to be deleted before hsp90 binding was eliminated (11Dalman F.C. Scherrer L.C. Taylor L.P. Akil H.

Steroid Biochem. 1989; 34: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and several subregions of the LBD could confer hsp90 binding onto a receptor fragment (14Cadepond F. Schweizer-Groyer G.

Because no consensus protein binding site was identified for hsp90, it has been suggested that a general property, such as exposure of hydrophobic residues in a partially denatured protein, may determine hsp90 binding (16Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3121) Google Scholar, 17Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). However, there is no indication that steroid receptors that have been stripped of hsp90 by mild salt treatment are in any way denatured prior to their reactivation by the hsp90/hsp70-based chaperone machinery. The deletion approach to studying the site of hsp90 binding also destroyed steroid binding activity, thus abrogating any relationship between hsp90 binding and the steroid binding activity resulting from the normal action of the hsp90/hsp70-based chaperone machinery on the receptor. We took a different approach. We previously found that no stable proteins are produced when plasmids containing just the GR LBD sequence are transiently transfected into cells. However, fusing the GR LBD to dihydrofolate reductase creates a stable steroid binding unit that allowed the N-terminal end of the LBD to be localized to the segment of amino acids 550–795 of the rat GR (19Xu M. Chakraborti P.K. Garabedian M.J. Yamamoto K.R. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21430-21438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Definition of an N terminus permits the study of hsp90 binding to an intact, native LBD possessing a normal steroid binding site when it is bound to hsp90. Thus, any requirements for hsp90 binding can be correlated with the appropriate hsp90-mediated conformational change leading to steroid binding. Using the GR LBD fusion proteins, we then demonstrated that a seven-amino acid segment (positions 547–553) lying in the predicted helix 1 of the rat GR LBD (20Wurtz J.-M. Bourguet W. Renaud J.-P. Vivat V. Chambon P. Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar) is required for both LBD·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly and steroid binding activity (21Xu M. Dittmar K.D. Giannoukos G. Pratt W.B. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13918-13924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Additional support for the notion that the seven-amino acid segment is critical for hsp90 regulation of receptor function in vivo comes from a recent study by Mackem et al. (22Mackem S. Baumann C.T. Hager G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45501-45504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). They found that when a GR fragment ending with this segment is fused to the complementary retinoic acid receptor LBD fragment extending to its C terminus, the chimera is complexed with hsp90 and undergoes cytoplasmic/nuclear translocation in response to retinoic acid. Thus, this N-terminal region of the GR LBD appears to confer those properties associated with bound-hsp90 to the retinoic acid receptor, which normally does not bind hsp90 (1Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr.

Nature. 1998; 393: 392-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar) and the similar human estrogen receptor alpha LBD (24Brzozowski A.M. Pike A.C.W. Dauter Z. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Engstrom O.

Nature. 1997; 389: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (2949) Google Scholar), this seven-amino acid segment would form part of the rim of the ligand binding cleft of the receptor (7Gee A.C.

The presence of hydrophobic clefts are a universal feature of all properly folded proteins, and regions where clefts merge with the surface of a protein may be the general topological feature that is recognized by the hsp90/hsp70-based chaperone machinery. Another example of such cleft recognition may be reflected in the ability of the hsp90/hsp70-based machinery to facilitate the entry of heme into its hydrophobic binding cleft in aponeuronal nitric-oxide synthase (26Billecke S.S. Bender A.T. Kanelakis K.C. Murphy P.J. Lowe E.R. Kamada Y. Pratt W.B. Osawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20504-20509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We have taken a mutational approach to further explore the role of the seven-amino acid segment of the GR LBD in hsp90 action. The segment contains all but the C-terminal leucine of an LXXLL motif that has been found important for a number of protein interactions of nuclear receptors, including the GR (27Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar, 28Torchia J. Rose D.W. Inostroza J. Kamei Y. Westin S. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 302-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we initially suspected that this LXXLL sequence might be involved in hsp90 binding to GR. Surprisingly, mutation of the first two leucines in the LXXLL motif decreased steroid binding capacity and transcriptional activity without altering receptor levels, cell-free steroid binding affinity, or hsp90 binding (25Giannoukos G. Silverstein A.M. Pratt W.B. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36527-36536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The biological inactivity was found to be due to an increased rate of steroid dissociation from the activated/transformed mutant receptor. Therefore, the LXXLL motif was not required for the hsp90/hsp70-based chaperone machinery to assemble an LBD·hsp90 complex and open the steroid binding cleft, but it apparently aided in keeping the cleft closed once steroid had bound and the receptor was transformed, a step that eliminates its persistent interaction with hsp90. In this work, we have made single point and multiple mutations of the five remaining amino acids in the seven-amino acid segment. We have examined the steroid binding and hsp90 binding activities as well as the transcriptional activity of each mutant. As a further indicator of normal receptor structure and function, we assayed the response to added coactivator. These studies were conducted with both full-length GR and chimeric constructs of either GAL4-DBD or GST with GR-LBD to determine the possible role of other GR sequences. The results indicate that hsp90 binding to GRs can be dissociated from steroid binding and that the presence, but not the sequence, of the seven amino acids (Thr-547 to Leu-553) is required for the formation of stable GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes.

Escherichia coli expressing human p23 and human Hop were kindly provided by Dr. David Toft (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN) and Dr. David Smith (Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ), respectively. E. coli expressing YDJ-1, the yeast ortholog of hsp40, was a gift from Dr. Avrom Caplan (Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY). TIF2 was a gift from Dr. Hinrich Gronemeyer (Institut de Génétique et de Biologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire, Strasbourg, France), and pSVLGR was generously provided by Dr. Keith Yamamoto (University of California, San Francisco). Vent DNA polymerase and the restriction enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs. The dual-luciferase reporter assay system was from Promega. LipofectAMINE Reagent was obtained from Invitrogen. Restriction enzymes and digestions were performed according to the manufacturer's specifications (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Hydrofluor scintillation mixture was from National Diagnostics. Single (T547A and T549A) and triple (T547A/T549A/S552A) mutants were created by the two-step PCR procedure using Vent DNA polymerase. The common oligonucleotides used for the above mutants are as follows: primer 1/BstBI, 5′- AAA GTA TTC TTT AAA AGA GCA GTG GAA GGA-3′; primer 2/SAPI, 5′-GAT GGC TTT TCC TAG CTC TTT GAT ATA AGT-3′. The oligonucleotides used specifically for T547A, T549A, and triple mutant (T547A/T549A/S552A) are as follows (mutant nucleotides are underlined): T547A (5′-TA CCA CAG CTC GCA CCT ACC TTG GTG TCA C-3′ and 5′-AC CAA GGT AGG TGCGAG CTG TGG TAA T-3′), T549A (5′-CAG CTC ACC CCTGCA TTG GTG TCA CTG CTG and 5′-CAG TGA CAC CAATGC AGG GGT GAG CTG TGG-3′), triple mutant (T547A/T549A/S552A) (5′-TA CCA CAG CTC GCA CCTGCA TTG GTG GCA CTG CTG GAG-3′ and 5′-CAG CAG TGC CAC CAA TGC AGGTGC GAG CTG TGG TAA TGC TGC-3′. The triple mutant (T547A/T549A/S552A) of the full-length GR was found to have a single base mutation at an AseI site (causing a frameshift beyond amino acid 648 of rat GR). This mutation was fixed by replacing the 3994-bp ScaI-ScaI fragment of the wild type GR with the same fragment from the mutant (which contained all of the three alanine mutations but not the frameshift mutation). The new triple mutant thus created was checked both by restriction digestion with AseI and sequencing in the region of three alanine mutations. The single mutants (P548A, V551A, and S552A) in the context of the full-length rat GR were created by the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The oligonucleotides used for these alanine mutants are as follows: P548A (5′-CCA CAG CTC ACCGCT ACC TTG GTG TCA CTG and 5′-CAG TGA CAC CAA GGT AGC GGT GAG CTG TGG-3′), V551A (5′-ACC CCT ACC TTG GCG TCA CTG CTG GAG GTG and 5′-CAC CTC CAG CAG TGA CGC CAA GGT AGG GGT-3′, S552A (5′-ACC CCT ACC TTG GTGGCA CTG CTG GAG GTG-3′ and 5′-CAC CTC CAG CAG TGC CAC CAA GGT AGG GGT-3′). All of the above single and triple mutants were created in the context of GAL/GR-525C by swapping the BstBI and PstI fragment containing point or triple mutations from the pSVLGR with the same fragment from GAL/GR-525C. The triple mutant (P548A/T549A/V551A) was created by mutagenizing the T549A single mutant by site-directed mutagenesis. The oligonucleotides used were 1) sense (5′-CCA CAG CTC ACC GCTGCA TTG GCG TCA CTG CTG GAG-3′) and 2) antisense (5′-CTC CAG CAG TGA CGC CAATGC AGC GGT GAG CTG TGG-3′. The triple mutant in the context of GAL/GR-525C was created by using the above strategy and oligonucleotides with the T549A mutant of GAL/GR-525C (33Kaul S. Blackford Jr., J.A. Cho S. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12541-12549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) as template. The heptad mutant (CAAAAAC in positions 547–553) in the context of GAL/GR-525C was created by mutagenizing the triple mutant (T547A/T549A/S552A) by site-directed mutagenesis. The oligonucleotide used were 1) sense (5′-GCA GCA TTA CCA CAG CTC TGCGCT GCA GCG GCGGCA TGC CTG GAG GTG ATT GAA CCC-3′ and 2) antisense (5′-GGG TTC AAT CAC CTC CAG GCA TGCCGC CGC TGC AGCGCA GAG CTG TGG TAA TGC TGC-3′. Monolayer cultures of COS-7 and CV-1 cells were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% and 10%, respectively, fetal calf serum (Biofluids Inc., Rockville, MD) in a humidified incubator (5% CO2). Triplicate samples of CV-1 cells in 60-mm dishes were transiently transfected with 100 ng of wild type or mutant GR plasmids, GREtkLUC (1 μg), Renilla (200 ng), and enough pBSK+ DNA to bring the total to 3 μg. The reporter used for Gal/GR-525C constructs was FRLuc. The cells were induced 24 h after transfection and harvested 2 days after transfection for analysis of the luciferase activity (34Song L.-N. Huse B. Rusconi S. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24806-24816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Transient transfection of COS-7 cells with 5 μg/100-mm dish of GR plasmid DNA was performed as described (35Szapary D. Oshima H. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 941-952PubMed Google Scholar). Cytosols of transfected cells containing the steroid-free receptors were obtained by the lysis of cells on dry ice and centrifugation at 15,000 × g (36Simons Jr., S.S. Miller P.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6876-6882Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thirty percent cytosol with 20 mm sodium molybdate was added to varying concentrations of [3H]Dex with or without a 100-fold excess of nonradioactive Dex and incubated at 0 °C for 18 h. Unbound [3H]Dex was removed by dextran-coated charcoal. Whole cell steroid binding was performed by incubating suspensions of COS-7 cells (1.5–2 × 106), transiently transfected with 1.2 μg/100-mm dish of GR plasmid DNA, with increasing concentrations of [3H]Dex (1.5–50 nm) in 200 μl of serum-free medium in the presence or absence of a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled Dex (each with 1.2% ethanol) for 30–45 min at 37 °C. The binding was terminated by the addition of 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, followed by centrifugation for 15 s, all at room temperature. Cells were washed for additional three times with phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature. In both cases, the total binding was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The specific binding was calculated by subtracting the background dpm (100-fold Dex) from the total [3H]Dex binding. The binding capacity and affinity were determined by Scatchard plot analysis by plotting the ratio of bound steroid/free steroidversus bound steroid. The amount of GR protein was determined by Western blotting with aP1 anti-GR antibody (1:40,000) or with anti-GAL DBD antibody (1:10,000) for GAL/GR chimeras and visualization by enhanced chemiluminescence as described (10Modarress K.J.

Aliquots (100 μl) of cytosol from transfected COS-7 cells were immunoadsorbed with 7 μl of FiGR ascites or nonimmune IgG precoupled to 14-μl pellets of protein A-Sepharose suspended in 200 μl of TEG buffer (10 mm TES, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 4 mmEDTA, 10% glycerol). Prior to incubation with the mixture of five purified proteins, immunoadsorbed receptors were stripped of associated hsp90 by incubating the immunopellet for 2 h at 4 °C with 350 μl of 0.5 m NaCl in TEG buffer. The pellets were then washed once with 1 ml of TEG buffer followed by a second wash with 1 ml of Hepes buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.35). For assembly of GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes (5Morishima Y. Murphy P.J.M., Li, D.P. Sanchez E.R. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18054-18060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), immunopellets containing GR stripped of chaperones were incubated with the five-protein assembly system (20 μg of purified hsp90, 15 μg of purified hsp70, 0.6 μg of purified human Hop, 6 μg of purified p23, 0.4 μg of purified YDJ-1) adjusted to 50 μl with HKD buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.35, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol) containing 20 mm sodium molybdate and 5 μl of an ATP-regenerating system (50 mm ATP, 250 mm creatine phosphate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, and 100 units/ml creatine phosphokinase). The assay mixtures were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C with suspension of the pellets by shaking the tubes every 2 min. At the end of the incubation, the pellets were washed twice with 1 ml of ice-cold TEGM buffer (TEG buffer with 20 mm sodium molybdate) and assayed for steroid binding capacity and for receptor-associated hsp90 and hsp70. Samples resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes and probed with 0.25 μg/ml BuGR monoclonal antibody for full-length GR, 0.1% anti-GST for fusion proteins, 1 μg/ml AC88 for hsp90, or 1 μg/ml N27F3–4 for hsp70. The immunoblots were then incubated a second time with the appropriate125I-conjugated counter antibody to visualize the immunoreactive bands. A portion of each immune pellet was assayed for steroid binding by incubation overnight in 50 μl of HEM buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.35, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm sodium molybdate) plus 50 nm [3H]TA. Samples were then washed three times with 1 ml of TEGM and counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry as described previously (37Dittmar K.D. Hutchison K.A. Owens-Grillo J.K. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12833-12839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The steroid binding is expressed as cpm of [3H]TA bound/immune pellet prepared from 50 μl of cytosol. hsp90 and hsp70 were purified from rabbit reticulocyte lysate by sequential chromatography on DE52, hydroxyapatite, and ATP-agarose as described previously (38Hutchison K.A. Dittmar K.D. Czar M.J. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5043-5049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human p23 was purified from 10 ml of bacterial lysate by chromatography on DE52 followed by hydroxyapatite chromatography as described (39Johnson J.L. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24989-24993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For purification of YDJ-1, bacterial sonicates were cleared by centrifugation, and YDJ-1 was purified by sequential chromatography on DE52 and hydroxyapatite as described previously (40Dittmar K.D. Banach M. Galigniana M.D. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7358-7366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The bacterial expression of YDJ-1 has been described (41Caplan A.J. Tsai J. Casey P.J. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18890-18895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as has the expression of human Hop (37Dittmar K.D. Hutchison K.A. Owens-Grillo J.K. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12833-12839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Purification of human Hop was carried out in a similar manner by sequential chromatography on DE52 and hydroxyapatite. In all cases, the protein-containing fractions were identified by immunoblotting, and fractions from the final purification step were pooled, concentrated by Amicon filtration, dialyzed against HKD buffer, flash frozen, and stored at −70 °C. Unless otherwise noted, all experiments were performed in triplicate several times. Theerror bars in graphs of individual experiments correspond to the S.D. of the triplicate values. Best fit curves (R 2 usually ≥0.95) for each experiment to yield a single EC50 value were obtained with KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). Of the seven amino acids in the sequence of Thr-547 to Leu-553 that were implicated in hsp90 binding to GRs (Fig.1) (21Xu M. Dittmar K.D. Giannoukos G. Pratt W.B. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13918-13924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), Leu-550 and Leu-553 were previously found not to be involved (25Giannoukos G. Silverstein A.M. Pratt W.B. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36527-36536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To examine the role of the remaining five residues (i.e. Thr-547, Pro-548, Thr-549, Val-551, and Ser-552), single point mutations were prepared in the context of the full-length GR (Fig. 1). We decided to use a variety of GR transactivation properties (total level of induced gene product, fold induction, the position of the dose-response curve (or EC50), and the partial agonist activity of antiglucocorticoids) to screen for possible effects of these mutations on hsp90 binding to GRs for two reasons. First, the ability to detect steroid binding to GRs with affinities that are ≥10-fold less than the wild type GR is severely limited by the background, nonspecific binding. Second, and more importantly, if defects in hsp90 binding alter any aspects of GR function other than steroid binding, assays of the final biological activity of GRs should be able to detect them. Representative data from the whole cell bioassays are given for the full-length wild type (wt) GR and three point mutants (P548A, V551A, and S552A) in Fig.2 A. No significant differences in the total levels of induced luciferase activity or the fold induction (equal to 53 ± 22-fold (S.E., n = 6) for wild type GR) with saturating concentrations of the agonist Dex are seen for any of the single mutants. When the data are replotted as a percentage of maximal induction by Dex (Fig. 2 B), there are again only minor differences between the wild type and mutant GRs in the EC50 or the position of the dose-response curve for Dex induction of the luciferase reporter gene. A summary of these data for all of the single point mutants, after normalization to the properties of the wild type GR, is presented in TableI. This table also gives the values for the partial agonist activity of each mutant GR with the antiglucocorticoids Dex-Mes and Dex-Ox, each of which is relatively constant. Thus, none"

Biol. 1998; 8: 1366-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Thus, PDK-1 mediates signaling pathways between PI 3-kinase and its downstream molecules, and it is possible that PDK-1 plays an important role on insulin-stimulated glucose transport. In fact, it was reported that the overexpression of wild type PDK-1 by the electroporation method provoked the increases in the activity of cotransfected hemagglutinin-tagged PKCζ and concomitantly enhanced hemagglutinin-tagged Glut4 translocation in rat adipocytes (15Bandyopadhyay G. Standaert M.L. Sajan M.P. Karnitz L.M. Cong L. Quon M.J. Farese R.V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1766-1772PubMed Google Scholar). However, very recently, it was reported that the overexpression of only constitutively active mutant PDK-1Ala280-Val but not wild type PDK-1 was able to phosphorylate Akt at Thr308 to the same extent as that stimulated by insulin (16Wick M.J. Dong L.Q. Riojas R.A. Ramos F.J. Liu F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40400-40406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PDK-1Ala280-Val localized in the cytosol and at the plasma membrane, and PDK-1 Ala280-Val lacking the pleckstrin homology domain, which localized predominantly in the cytosol, showed much weaker effect to phosphorylate Akt. Thus, the roles of PDK-1 on insulin signal transduction are still unclear. In this study, we overexpressed wild type and membrane targeted PDK-1 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer and examined the role of PDK-1 on insulin signaling. Overexpression of wild type PDK-1 stimulated atypical PKC activity but small effects for Akt phosphorylation. On the other hand, a membrane-targeted PDK-1 enhanced the phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3 at the basal condition but inhibited glycogen synthesis and insulin-stimulated ERK phosphorylation. Moreover, neither wild type nor membrane-targeted PDK-1 enhances glucose transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. This finding suggests that PDK-1 stimulates atypical PKC and Akt by different mechanisms, and localization of PDK-1 is important for regulation of downstream signaling but another mechanism is still needed for total activation. Human insulin was provided by Eli Lilly, Inc. (Indianapolis, IL). Anti-PDK-1 antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Incorporated (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-phosphospecific-PKCζ/λ, -Akt, and -ERK1/2 antibodies were fromCell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20) was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-sheep antibody was from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Anti-PKCζ antibody, DME medium, and fetal calf serum (FCS) were obtained from Invitrogen. All radioisotopes were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Kodak X-Omat AR was obtained from Eastman Kodak Co. All other reagents and chemicals were purchased from Sigma. The partial nucleotide sequence containing complete open reading frame of humanpdk-1 cDNA (GenBankTM accession numberAF017995) was amplified from total RNA of HepG2 cells by reverse transcription-PCR reaction with use of the primers 5′-gcccatggccaggaccaccagc-3′ and 5′-tcactgcacaagcgcgtccg-3′, and the fragments were subcloned into pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen). The 1.6-kb fragments obtained were used as a probe for standard plaque hybridization with a human brain cDNA library (Catalog no. 937223, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). After purification of λ-ZAP II phage (Stratagene) containing full-length human pdk-1 cDNA,in vitro excision was performed using a helper phage (ExAssistTM, Stratagene). Finally, full-length cDNA subcloned into pBluescript was isolated. After confirmation of the sequence, a FLAG epitope (MDYLDDDDK) was added by an another PCR reaction using the following primers 5′-catggactacaaggacgacgatgacaaggcccatggccaggaccaccag-3′ and 5′-tcactgcacagcggcgtccg-3′, and the fragment (pdk-1 residues 2–556 with the N-terminal FLAG tag) was subcloned into pCR2.1 (17Obata T. Yaffe M.B. Leparc G.G. Piro E.T. Maegawa H. Kashiwagi A. Kikkawa R. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36108-36115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Subcloned cDNA of FLAG-pdk-1 in pCR2.1 was digested with EcoRI and subcloned into baculovirus transfer vector pVL1393 (PharMingen, San Diego, CA). His-tagged mouse akt-1 (His-Akt), which was subcloned in a mammalian expression vector (pCMV6) and provided by Dr. A. Bellacosa, was also subcloned into pVL1393 with EcoRI site. These plasmids were co-transfected with Baculo-Gold linearized DNA into Sf-9 cells according to the manufacturer's instruction (PharMingen). Recombinant His-tagged Akt-1 baculovirus was infected to Sf-9 cells with or without following baculovirus including His-PDK-1 at the indicated multiplicities of infection. After 60 h of infection, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in a solubilizing buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EGTA, 140 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 4 μg/ml AEBSF (aminoethyl benzensulfonyl fluoride), 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 4 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 4 μg/ml leupeptin at 4 °C for 20 min. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen, Tokyo, Japan). The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and once with kinase buffer containing 20 mmol/liter HEPES (pH 7.4), and 10 mmol/liter. The kinase reaction was performed for 10 min at 30 °C in a kinase buffer containing 20 mmHEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 100 μm unlabeled ATP, and 0.2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and then analyzed by 9% SDS-PAGE. The activity was quantified using a PhosphorImager (AmershamBiosciences). PDK-1 wild type adenovirus (Ad5-PDK-1WT) was provided by Dr. L. C. Cantley (Harvard University, Boston, MA). The recombinant adenovirus containing the cDNA encoding the membrane-targeted pdk-1, PDK-1CAAX, was isolated by AdEasy system as described previously (18He T-C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T., Yu, J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar). The recombinant plasmids, AdTrack-PDK-1CAAX and AdEasy, were purified and co-transformed into Escherichia coli by electroporation method. The recombinant plasmid, AdEasy-PDK-1CAAX, was transfected into 293 cells. Because 293 cells were originally derived from adenovirus transformation, the missingE1 gene function of AdEasy is provided in trans. The resulting recombinant virus containing the PDK-1CAAX is denoted as Ad5-PDK-1CAAX and is replication-defective (at least in cells lacking the E1 region of adenovirus) but fully infectious. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, which were provided by Dr. J. M. Olefsky, were grown and maintained in DME high glucose medium (Invitrogen) containing 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% FCS in a 10% CO2 environment. The cells were allowed to grow until 2 days postconfluency and then differentiated by the addition of the same medium containing isobutylmethylxanthine (500 μm), dexamethasone (25 μm), and insulin (4 μg/ml) for 3 days and the medium containing insulin for 3 additional days. The medium was then changed every 3 days until the cells were fully differentiated, typically after 15 days. Prior to experimentation, the adipocytes were trypsinized and reseeded in the appropriate culture dishes. Rat primary cultured hepatocytes were isolated from non-fasting 200-g male Sprague-Dawley rats by the collagenase method described previously (19Nagai Y. Nishio Y. Nakamura T. Maegawa H. Kikkawa R. Kashiwagi A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: E1180-E1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Animals were anesthetized, and the liver was perfused in situ via the portal vein with 25 ml/min Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer. The liver was then perfused with Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer containing collagenase (Sigma) for 10 min at the same flow rate. The dissociated cells were dispersed by shaking followed by filtration at 4 °C through gauze into an equal volume of ice-cold DME medium containing 10% FCS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. The cells were precipitated and washed twice at 4 °C with the same medium. The cell suspension (8 × 106) was plated onto 100-mm rat collagen I-coated dishes (Asahi Techno Glass Co., Chiba, Japan) in William's E Medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% FCS, 6 ng/ml insulin, 100 nm triiodothyronine, 100 nm dexamethasone, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. After incubation at 37 °C in 9% CO2 for 3 h, the cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated with DME medium supplemented with 6 ng/ml insulin, 100 nm triiodothyronine, 100 nmdexamethasone, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. The Ad-E1A-transformed human embryonic kidney cell line 293 was cultured in DME high glucose medium containing 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% FCS in a 5% CO2environment. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 10–40 plaque-forming units/cell for 16 h with stocks of either a control recombinant adenovirus, Ad5-ctrl, containing the cytomegalovirus promoter, pUC 18 polylinker, and a fragment of the SV40 genome, the recombinant adenovirus Ad5-PDK-1 or Ad5-PDK-1CAAX. Transduced cells were incubated for 56 h at 37 °C in 10% CO2 and DME medium with 2% heat inactivated serum followed by incubation in the starvation medium required for the assay. Rat primary cultured hepatocytes were infected at 10 m.o.i. of Ad5-PDK-1WT or Ad5-PDK-1CAAX for 1 h and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in 10% CO2. The efficiency of the adenovirus-mediated gene transfer was ∼90% as measured by immunocytochemistry. The survival of the cells was unaffected by the incubation of cells with the different adenovirus constructs, because the total cell protein remained the same in infected or uninfected cells. The cells were stained as described previously (20Nakamura T. Kishi A. Nishio Y. Maegawa H. Egawa K. Norman C.W.W. Kojima H. Fujimiya M. Arai R. Kashiwagi A. Kikkawa K. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 1795-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The cells were fixed for 2 h with 4% paraformaldehyde and washed for 4 days with 0.1 m PBS containing 0.3% Triton-X followed by incubation with an antibody against PDK-1 diluted to 1:5000 in PBS containing 0.3% Triton-X. The cells were then incubated with the species-specific secondary antibodies conjugated to Texas Red. The positive reaction was observed under fluorescence microscopy (Olympus IX70, Olympus Optical Co., Tokyo, Ltd., Japan), and the images were taken with CCD camera (Cool SNAP/HQ, Nippon Roper Co., Chiba, Japan). Ad5-ctrl-, Ad5-PDK-1WT, or Ad5-PDK-1CAAX-infected cells were starved for 16 h in DME regular glucose medium with 0.05% FCS. The cells were stimulated with the indicated concentration of insulin for 5–30 min at 37 °C and lysed in a solubilizing buffer containing 20 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 140 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 units/ml aprotinin, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 50 mm NaF (pH 7.5), for 30 min at 4 °C. The cell lysates were centrifuged to remove insoluble materials. For Western blot analysis, whole cell lysates (20 μg protein/lane) were denatured by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Gels were transferred to nitrocellulose by electroblotting in Towbin buffer containing 20% methanol. For immunoblotting, membranes were blocked and probed with specified antibodies. Blots were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked second antibody followed by chemiluminescence detection according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). Kinase activity was measured by a solid-phase kinase assay as described previously with some modification (21Morino K. Maegawa H. Fujita T. Takahara N. Egawa K. Kashiwagi A. Kikkawa R. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 2669-2676Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). 3T3-L1 adipocytes were infected as described above, starved for 16 h in DME regular glucose medium with 0.05% FCS, stimulated with 100 ng/ml insulin for 10 min at 37 °C, and lysed. The cell lysates (300–350 μg) were immunoprecipitated with anti-PDK-1 antibody. The immunocomplexes were recovered by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 s and then washed three times with a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 20 mm NaF, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, and 0.1% Triton X-100 and once with kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm vanadate, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). The immunocomplexes were then incubated with 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 50 μm unlabeled ATP, 50 μg of myelin basic protein, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 10 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 15 μl of 3× Laemmli sample buffer and boiling at 100 °C for 5 min. Phosphorylated proteins were resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. The relative kinase activities were quantified by Instant-Imager. The procedure for glucose transport was a modification of the methods described by Klip et al. (22Klip A., Li, G. Logan W.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 247: E291-E296PubMed Google Scholar). Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were infected with Ad5-PDK-1WT or Ad5-ctrl at 40 m.o.i. as described above and grown in medium containing heat-inactivated serum (2%) for 72 h. Serum- and glucose-deprived cells were incubated in minimum Eagle's medium-α in the absence (basal) or presence of the indicated concentration of insulin for 1 h at 37 °C. Glucose uptake was determined in duplicate or triplicate at each point after the addition of 10 μl of substrate (2-[3H]deoxyglucose orl-[3H]glucose (0.1 μCi), final concentration (0.01 mmol/liter)) to provide a concentration at which cell membrane transport was rate-limiting. The value forl-glucose was subtracted to correct each sample for the contributions of diffusion and trapping. Glycogen synthesis was measured as described previously (23Egawa K. Nakashima N. Sharma P.M. Maegawa H. Nagai Y. Kashiwagi A. Kikkawa R. Olefsky J.M. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1930-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). 3T3-L1 adipocytes were infected with Ad5-PDK-1WT or Ad5-PDK-1CAAX at 50 m.o.i. for 16 h and grown in medium containing 2% heat-inactivated serum for 56 h. The cells were serum-starved for 16 h, and then medium was replaced with DME medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin. The cells were incubated with [14C]glucose (0.4 μCi/well) and 100 ng/ml insulin for 2 h in CO2 incubator, washed with PBS three times, and lysed with 2 n NaOH at 55 °C. Synthesized [14C]glycogen was precipitated with cold glycogen in 66% ethanol and washed, and radioactivity was measured. The values are expressed as mean ± S.E. unless otherwise stated. The step-down method by Tukey-Welsch was used to determine the significance of any differences among more than four groups. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Recombinant His-tagged Akt-1 baculovirus was infected to Sf-9 cells with or without the following infection of baculovirus including His-3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK-1) at the indicated multiplicity of infection. As shown in Fig. 1, overexpressed PDK-1 was autophosphorylated and phosphorylated Akt. Thus, our PDK-1 has kinase activity to phosphorylate Akt. Isolated primary cultured hepatocytes were infected with recombinant adenovirus expressing wild type PDK-1, Ad5-PDK-1WT, or membrane-targeted PDK-1, Ad5-PDK-1CAAX, at 10 m.o.i. for 1 h. Following a 24-h incubation, the cells were fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with anti-PDK-1 antibody. Overexpressed PDK-1WT existed mainly in cytosol, and PDK-1CAAX was located at the plasma membrane (Fig.2 A). Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were infected with Ad5-PDK-1WT or Ad5-PDK-1CAAX at 40 m.o.i. for 16 h. Following a 56-h incubation, the cells were starved for 16 h and stimulated with 100 ng/ml insulin for 30 min. The cells were lysed and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with anti-PDK-1 antibody (Fig.2 B). Overexpressed PDK-1WT showed a mobility shift at the basal condition and shifted more by insulin stimulation. PDK-1CAAX was highly shifted at the basal condition, and insulin stimulation had no additive effect. Insulin stimulation led to tyrosine phosphorylation of PDK-1WT, but PDK-1CAAX was already tyrosine-phosphorylated at the basal condition (Fig. 2 C). We were not able to see any phosphorylation bands in control cells, probably because of a small amount of endogenous PDK-1 protein (data not shown). Cell lysates from 3T3-L1 adipocytes infected with Ad5-PDK-1WT or Ad5-PDK-1CAAX at 40 m.o.i. were immunoprecipitated with anti-PDK-1 antibody, and in vitro kinase activity was measured using MBP as substrate (Fig. 3). Insulin stimulated PDK-1 activity ∼1.3-fold in uninfected 3T3-L1 adipocytes. PDK-1WT overexpression itself increased PDK-1 activity ∼6-fold at the basal condition, and insulin had no additive effect. PDK-1CAAX expression also elevated kinase activity ∼2.4-fold at the basal condition, and insulin had no additive effect but it showed lower activity than PDK-1WT. Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were infected with Ad5-PDK-1WT or Ad5-PDK-1CAAX at 40 m.o.i. and stimulated with 100 ng/ml insulin for 10 min. The cells then were lysed, and Western blotting was performed by anti-phosphospecific PKCζ/λ antibody. As shown in Fig. 4 A, insulin stimulated the phosphorylation of PKCζ/λ, and overexpression of PDK-1WT or PDK-1CAAX caused its phosphorylation without insulin stimulation. We observed the identical findings by in vitrokinase assay using MBP as substrate. When basal activity was adjusted to 100%, PKCζ activity was stimulated up to 132 ± 7.8% by insulin in control cells and up to 140 ± 6.5% and 145 ± 16.8% by PDK-1WT and PDK-1CAAX expression, respectively. Insulin had no further effects on PDK-1 activity in these cells. PDK-1WT or PDK-1CAAX expressing 3T3-L1 adipocytes were stimulated with or without insulin for 30 min, lysed, and analyzed by Western blotting with phosphospecific Akt or GSK-3 antibody. In Fig. 4 B, PDK-1CAAX expression stimulated Akt phosphorylation on both Thr308 and Ser473 at the basal condition weakly but significantly. This increased phosphorylation of Akt led the phosphorylation of GSK-3 up to the insulin-stimulated level at the basal condition (Fig.4 C). PDK-1WT expression caused small phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3 at the basal condition. PDK-1CAAX and PDK-1WT overexpression caused the phosphorylation of p70S6 kinase at basal level as well as Akt (data not shown). We next measured the effect of PDK-1WT and PDK-1CAAX on glycogen synthesis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Surprisingly, PDK-1CAAX inhibited glycogen synthesis >50% both at the basal and insulin-stimulated conditions (Fig.5). PDK-1WT also inhibited glycogen synthesis, but this effect was weaker than PDK-1CAAX. On the other hand, neither PDK-1WT nor PDK-1CAAX overexpression affected both Glut4 translocation from cytosol to plasma membrane and glucose uptake both at the basal and insulin-stimulated conditions (Fig.6, A and B).Figure 6Effects of PDK-1 expression on Glut4 translocation and 2-deoxy-glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes infected with Ad5-PDK-1 or CAAX at 40 m.o.i. were stimulated with or without insulin at the indicated concentrations for 60 min. Each fraction was separated by ultracentrifugation, and Western blot was performed by anti-Glut4 antibody (A). PM, plasma membrane;LDM, low density microsome. 2-Deoxy-glucose uptake was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures” (B). The graph shows the mean ± S.E. of five independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) PDK-1WT or CAAX expressing 3T3-L1 adipocytes were stimulated with insulin for 10 min, lysed, and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with anti-phosphospecific ERK1/2 antibody (Fig. 7). PDK-1WT expression had no significant effect on ERK1/2 phosphorylation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Interestingly, PDK-1CAAX expression inhibited the insulin-stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner. PDK-1 was originally cloned as Akt kinase, and several lines of evidence demonstrated that PDK-1 played an important role to mediate signal transduction in the PI 3-kinase pathway. We cloned a full-lengthpdk-1 cDNA from a human brain cDNA library and overexpressed PDK-1WT or PDK-1CAAX by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer. Our cloned PDK-1 was autophosphorylated and phosphorylated Akt in Sf-9 cells in the baculovirus system (Fig. 1). Moreover, overexpression of PDK-1WT showed elevated kinase activity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 3). Thus, our cloned PDK-1 appeared to be an intact enzyme. However, surprisingly, the overexpression of PDK-1WT did not significantly enhance the phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3 at the basal condition (Fig. 4). It was previously suggested that PDK-1 was constitutively active in cells and that phosphorylation and activation of its downstream substrates was mediated mainly by translocation and conformational changes in its substrates (24Belham C., Wu, S. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R93-R96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 25Peterson R.T. Schreiber S.L. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R521-R524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PDK-1 purified from cells was constitutively active and treatment of cells with mitogen did not stimulate PDK-1 activity in vitro (26Alessi D.R. Deak M. Casamayor A. Caudwell F.B. Morrice N. Norman D.G. Gaffney P. Reese C.B. MacDougall C.N. Harbison D. Ashworth A. Bownes M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 776-789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Moreover, the translocation of PDK-1 to the plasma membrane was also important in allowing PDK-1 to activate Akt (27Anderson K.E. Coadwell J. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 684-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). However, it was recently reported that overexpression of the constitutively active mutant PDK-1Ala280-Val but not wild type PDK-1 was able to phosphorylate Akt at Thr308 to the same extent as that stimulated by insulin (16Wick M.J. Dong L.Q. Riojas R.A. Ramos F.J. Liu F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40400-40406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). PDK-1 Ala280-Val localized in the cytosol and at the plasma membrane, and PDK-1Ala280-Val lacking the pleckstrin homology domain, which localized predominantly in the cytosol, showed much weaker effect to phosphorylate Akt. In this study, the overexpression of PDK-1WT showed a high level of kinase activity at the basal condition (Fig. 3), so it appeared constitutively active. However, insulin stimulation or co-expression of membrane-targeted p110 (p110CAAX) (4Egawa K. Sharma P.M. Nakashima N. Huang Y. Huver E. Boss G.R. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14306-14314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) caused a mobility shift of PDK-1WT (data not shown). Furthermore, insulin stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of PDK-1WT (Fig. 2). It was reported recently (28Park J. Hill M.M. Hess D. Brazil D.P. Hofsteenge J. Hemming B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37459-37471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) that phosphorylation of PDK-1 on Tyr373/376 is important for PDK-1 activity. Thus, this additional phosphorylation by the PI 3-kinase pathway may be important for activation of its downstream molecules. In fact, overexpressed PDK-1CAAX was mobility-shifted more, tyrosine-phosphorylated, and able to phosphorylate Akt and GSK-3 without stimulation more strongly than PDK-1WT (Figs. 2 and4). On the other hand, the amount of the insulin-stimulated tyrosyl-phosphorylated PDK-1WT was the same as PDK-1CAAX, but insulin-stimulated mobility shift of PDK-1WT was not so great as that of PDK-1CAAX. Thus, only the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues is not able to explain mobility shift, and phosphorylation of other residues may occur by membrane targeting. Further study is still needed to clarify this mechanism. PDK-1CAAX-expressing cells had higher activity than control cells at the basal condition, but it was much lower than that of PDK-1WT (Fig. 3). The expression level of PDK-1WT and PDK-1CAAX was comparable, but kinase activity per protein was 1, 0.9, and 0.25 in endogenous PDK-1, PDK-1WT, and PDK-1CAAX, respectively. This means that increased kinase activity in PDK-1WT cells was the result of increased protein mass, but membrane-targeted PDK-1 had lower activity. Because we measured kinase activity in vitro by using MBP as substrate, the attached CAAX signal might interfere with the affinity between PDK-1 and MBP. Another possibility is that membrane localization might be affected by negative regulator for kinase activity of PDK-1. However, at least it supports the fact that membrane localization is important because PDK-1CAAX has lower kinase activity than PDK-1WT but stimulates the phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3 more strongly at the basal condition. PDK-1WT showed small effects for its downstream molecules at the basal condition. It is possible that a part of overexpressing PDK-1WT exists near the plasma membrane by chance, and it behaves like PDK-1CAAX. On the other hand, atypical PKC was fully activated by PDK-1WT overexpression alone at the basal conditions and showed no further stimulation by insulin (Fig. 4). These data suggest that PDK-1 stimulates Akt, GSK-3, and atypical PKC by different mechanisms. Localization of PDK-1 is important for activation of Akt and GSK-3 but not for atypical PKC. The ability of PDK-1CAAX to phosphorylate Akt at the basal state was much weaker than insulin stimulation. It is known that Akt translocates to plasma membrane in a phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate-dependent manner and gets phosphorylation by PDK-1. When PDK-1CAAX is overexpressed, PI 3-kinase is not activated. Thus, it is possible that because Akt does not translocate to plasma membrane, PDK-1CAAX is not able to interact with Akt, even though PDK-1CAAX is enough to phosphorylate Akt. It was reported that the membrane-targeted Akt and the constitutively active Akt mutant stimulated glucose transport without insulin stimulation (5Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31372-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). Another study (6Kotani K. Ogawa W. Matsumoto M. Kitamura T. Sakaue H. Hino Y. Miyake K. Sano W. Akimoto K. Ohno S. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6971-6982Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that a dominant negative PKCλ inhibited the insulin-stimulated glucose transport without affecting Akt activity. Thus, the molecular mechanism of insulin-stimulated glucose transport is still unclear. In this study, the overexpression of PDK-1WT stimulated atypical PKC activity but did not affect glucose transport (Fig. 6), so it is probable that atypical PKC activation alone is insufficient for stimulation of glucose transport. It was recently reported that overexpression of atypical PKC isotype-specific interacting protein, which specifically interacts with the atypical PKC isozymes PKCλ and PKCζ, inhibits insulin stimulation of glucose uptake partially with complete inhibition of PKCλ activity (29Kotani K. Ogawa W. Hashiramoto M. Onishi T. Ohno S. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26390-26395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This finding also suggests that other pathways exist for insulin-stimulated glucose transport with the exception of atypical PKC. PDK-1CAAX showed full activation of atypical PKC and partial activation of Akt but did not stimulate glucose transport. Akt activation is not so great; thus, it may not be enough for the stimulation of glucose transport. Another explanation is that both atypical PKC and Akt activation are still not enough for stimulation of glucose transport. PDK-1CAAX fully stimulated GSK-3 phosphorylation but inhibited glycogen synthesis (Figs. 4 and 5). We previously reported that membrane-targeted PI 3-kinase (p110CAAX) constitutively activated Akt but inhibited glycogen synthesis (4Egawa K. Sharma P.M. Nakashima N. Huang Y. Huver E. Boss G.R. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14306-14314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Thus, constitutive activation of Akt-GSK-3 pathway may inhibit glycogen synthesis because of desensitization. It is possible that activated GSK-3 stimulates glycogen synthesis, and increased glycogen content may provide a feedback signal to diminish synthesis rate. To supporting this idea, PDK-1WT also stimulated Akt-GSK-3 pathway; however, it was weak, so glycogen synthesis was partially inhibited in the cells expressing PDK-1WT. A previous study reported that the expression of a dominant-negative Δp85 PI 3-kinase subunit, kinase-inactive PDK-1, and kinase-inactive PKCζ inhibited insulin-induced ERK activation in rat adipocytes (30Sajan M. Standaert M.L. Bandyopadhyay G. Quon M.J. Burke Jr., T.R. Farese R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30495-30500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), suggesting that PI 3-kinase-PDK-1/atypical PKC pathway is important to activate MAPK cascade. However, in this study, overexpressed PDK-1WT did not enhance ERK phosphorylation at both the basal and insulin-stimulated conditions (Fig. 7), even though it stimulated PKCζ. Moreover PDK-1CAAX inhibited the insulin-stimulated ERK phosphorylation. Similar to these findings, we also previously reported that p110CAAX did not stimulate ERK phosphorylation at the basal and inhibited insulin-stimulated ERK phosphorylation, even though a full activation of PI 3-kinase cascade (4Egawa K. Sharma P.M. Nakashima N. Huang Y. Huver E. Boss G.R. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14306-14314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Because it is reported that Akt inhibits Raf activation (31Rommel C. Clarke B.A. Zimmermann S. Nunez L. Rossman R. Reid K. Moelling K. Yancopoulos G.D. Glass D.J. Science. 1999; 286: 1738-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 32Zimmermann S. Moelling K. Science. 1999; 286: 1741-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar, 33Guan K-L. Figueroa C.

Chem. 2000; 275: 27354-27359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), constitutive activation of Akt may decreased insulin-stimulated ERK phosphorylation in the PDK-1CAAX-expressing cells. Taken together, the activation of the PI 3-kinase/PDK-1 pathway alone is insufficient for ERK activation, and constitutive activation of this pathway inhibits insulin-stimulated ERK phosphorylation. In summary, wild type PDK-1 overexpression is sufficient for phosphorylation of atypical PKC, but membrane localization is needed for Akt and GSK-3 activation. Moreover, the activation of both atypical PKC and Akt alone is insufficient for glucose transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. We thank Dr. L. C.

However, it remains unclear whether the flap strand of the substrate DNA threads through this arch because FEN-1 could cleave the flap strand with a secondary structure even at a reduced rate and could efficiently hydrolyze the branched structure (26Bornarth C.J.

FEN-1 possesses 5′-flap endonuclease and 5′-3′-exonuclease activities. The flap endonuclease cleaves the flap strand at the junction, and the activity is independent of the length of the 5′ flap strand, cleaving both the 1- and 5-mer flap strands efficiently as well as the 19-mer flap strand (28Harrington J.J.

There have been a few studies concerning the dual function of acidic residues located at the active center, which binds to both the substrate and active Mg2+ ions (30Shen B. Nolan J.P. Sklar L.A.

Site-directed mutagenesis of T5 5′-3′-exonuclease showed that a conserved lysine residue (Lys83) located near the active site was required for exonuclease activity but not for endonuclease activity (33Garforth S.J. Ceska T.A. Suck D. Sayers J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This finding indicates a difference in substrate recognition for exo- and endonuclease activities. The substrate specificity of FEN-1 was investigated in detail as described above, whereas the DNA-binding mechanism, including the DNA-binding sites and the function of the large loop, is still unclear. To investigate the substrate-binding mechanism of phFEN-1, we determined the molecular structure of phFEN-1 as reported here. On the basis of this structure, we analyzed the function of one large and four small loops by site-directed mutagenesis, and identified several key amino acid residues involved in endo- and exo-type DNA binding and catalysis. The vector pET-11b and E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) were purchased from Novagen (Madison, WI). The vector pGEMEX was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). The restriction enzymes were purchased from Promega. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was also obtained from Takara Shuzo. The oligonucleotides labeled with fluorescent dye, fluorescein (FAM), were purchased from Sawady Technology, Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Each mutant gene was constructed on the basis of the vector pGEMEX/FEN-1 using the site-directed mutagenesis procedure and the PCR method. The wild-type and mutated genes were inserted into the vector pET-11a using NdeI and XhoI sites, resulting in the expression vectors pET-11a/phFEN-1s. The E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) was transformed with the expression vectors. The transformant was propagated in 200 ml of 2× yeast-tryptone medium containing ampicillin at 37 °C. The recombinant protein was induced at A 600 = 1.0–1.5 with 1 mm of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 12 h. The cells were collected by centrifugation and stored at −20 °C. The frozen cells were then thawed at room temperature and mixed with 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0). The sample was heated at 83 °C for 30 min and centrifuged at 2300 × g for 30 min, and then the supernatant was again heated at 83 °C for 15 min to remove endogenous proteases completely before being centrifuged. The supernatant was loaded on a HiTrap SP column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with a linear gradient of 1 m NaCl in a 50-mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer. The recombinant phFEN-1s were eluted with buffer containing 200–300 mm NaCl. The secondary structure of the purified proteins was measured using a circular dichroism (CD) spectrometer, AVIV model 62DS (Shimazu, Kyoto, Japan) and a quartz cuvette having a path length of 1.0 or 2.0 mm. The protein concentration was ∼0.1 mg/ml of 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0). Crystals were obtained by hanging-drop vapor diffusion using the R42E mutant protein. To a 2-μl solution containing 2% protein and 200 mm NaCl, pH 8.0 (50 mm Tris-HCl buffer), an equal amount of reservoir solution containing 20% PEG 6000 at pH 6.0 (100 mm MES buffer) was added, and a droplet of the solution was equilibrated over a 1-ml reservoir solution. A rod-shaped crystal was obtained belonging to the trigonal space group P31, and the cell dimensions were a = b = 62.67 and c = 180.69 Å. The asymmetric unit contained two independent molecules (V m = 2.56 Å3/Da). The intensity data were measured to a resolution of 3.0 Å using synchrotron radiation (λ = 1.0 Å) on an ADSC Quantum 4R charge-coupled devices detector at the BL-6A beam line station of the Photon Factory. A total of 135,478 observed reflections were merged to a set of 15,903 (100% completeness) with anR merge value of 0.104. The structure was solved by the molecular replacement method using the structure of the FEN-1 from Methanococcus jannaschii. A self-rotation search using the program X-POLR indicated that the two independent molecules are related by a local 2-fold axis. The structure was refined by X-PLOR for 13,576 reflections in the resolution range from 8.0 to 3.1 Å. The refinement converged at R andR free values of 0.190 and 0.279, respectively. The root mean square deviations of bond distances and angles from their ideal values were 0.020 Å and 3.1 °, respectively. The coordinates were deposited in the Protein Data Bank (ID code 1MCB). The following oligonucleotides were designed to construct various DNA substrates: Oligonucleotide A, 54-mer, 5′-GAGCTAGATGTCGGACTCTGCCTCAAGACGGTAGTCAACGTGCACTCGAGGTCA-3′; Oligonucleotide B, 27-mer, 5′-TGACCTCGAGTGCACGTTGACTACCGT-3′; Oligonucleotide C, 57-mer, 5′-GCATCTGACGGATGTCAAGCAGTCCTAACTCTTGAGGCAGAGTCCGACATCTAGCTC-3′; Oligonucleotide D, 27-mer, 5′-CTTGAGGCAGAGTCCGACATCTAGCTC-3′; and Oligonucleotide E, 54-mer, 5′-TGACCTCGAGTGCACGTTGACTACCGTCTTGAGGCAGAGTCCGACATCTAGCTC-3′. Oligonucleotides C and D were labeled at the 5′ terminus with a fluorescence group (FAM) and then purified using high pressure liquid chromatography. Annealing reactions to construct various DNA substrates were performed as described previously (17Matsui E. Kawasaki S. Ishida H. Ishikawa K. Kosugi Y. Kikuchi H. Kawarwbayashi Y. Matsui I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18297-18309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The flap substrate was constructed with oligonucleotides A, B, and C labeled with FAM. The nick substrate was constructed with oligonucleotides A, B, and D labeled with FAM. The dsDNA was constructed with oligonucleotides A and E. The levels of activity of phFEN-1s were measured using substrates with a highly fluorescent dye, fluorescein (FAM), at the 5′ end of the flap strand or 5′ end of the upstream primer of the nick substrate. The pattern observed for the digestion of fluorescent substrate was the same as that observed for the radiolabeled substrate. The product amount was evaluated with a fluorescence scanner after electrophoresis. This method has almost the same sensitivity as the radioactive-labeling methods employed for the phFEN-1 assay. Hence, we used the fluorescent substrate throughout the study. The kinetic parameters were determined using the fluorescence substrate. The reaction mixture was 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing the labeled substrate, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 1.5 μg of bovine serum albumin. The enzyme and substrate concentrations were varied from 0.025 to 200 ng and from 0.1 to 75 pmol, respectively. A 10-fold volume (150 μl) of the reaction mixture was preheated at 60 °C for 5 min and 14 μl was added to 10 μl of stop solution as a control for a zero time reaction. Nine volumes of enzyme were added, and 15 μl of the reaction mixture was added to 10 μl of the stop solution every 1 min for 7 min. The samples were denatured at 95 °C for 10 min. Five μl of sample was loaded onto a 12% polyacrylamide gel (10 × 10 cm) with 7 m urea and 1× TBE, and electrophoresed with the same buffer for 1.5 h at 200 V. The reaction products were visualized and quantified using a FluorImager 585 (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., CA). The initial velocities were obtained directly from the initial slopes of the time course plots. The K m andk cat values were calculated using the Michaelis-Menten equation and the least squares method (34Sakoda M. Hiromi K. J. Biochem. 1976; 80: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The interaction between phFEN-1 and dsDNA were quantitatively analyzed on a BIAcoreX apparatus (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden) at 25 °C. The flow cell was routinely equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.005% Tween 20. The biotinylated dsDNA, which was constructed with 5′-biotinylated oligonucleotide A and oligonucleotide B, was coupled to a streptavidin-dextran layer on the surface of Sensor Chip SA (Biacore). The 5′-biotinylated dsDNA were injected for 120 s, resulting in an immobilization corresponding to ∼600 resonance units. The protein were diluted in the same buffer and injected for 120 s. In all cases, at least nine different concentrations ranging from 10 nm to 10 μm protein were injected. The obtained sensograms were analyzed by the evaluation software (Biacore) to calculate the association constants on the basis of the simple 1:1 binding model. The crystallization was investigated with the wild type and some mutant enzymes, and a rod-shaped crystal was obtained with the R42E mutant. The crystal structure was solved by molecular replacement using the structure of FEN-1 from M. jannaschii and was refined at a resolution of 3.1 Å. The two independent molecules are related by the local 2-fold axis as shown in Fig. 1 A. The structure consists of 10 helices, A-J; five β-strands, A-E; and loop regions. The helices A, B, C, I, and J are separated from the other five helices by the sheet-like structure of the five β-strands. The arrangement of the helices and β-strands is similar to that observed in the FEN-1 structures of M. jannaschii andPyrococcus furiosus. The region of residues 80–128 between sheet B and helix C forms a large and flexible loop designated the large loop. The region 187–206 between sheet E and helix E forms another flexible loop (small loop 2). The two loops show marked structural differences among FEN-1s from P. horikoshii,P. furiosus, and M. jannaschii, as indicated in Fig. 1 B by the red and black arrows, respectively. The FEN-1 structure of M. jannaschii lacks small loop 2. Although in the amino acid sequence, the small loops ofP. horikoshii and P. furiosus differ little, just one replacement from methionine to leucine at position 196 (17Matsui E. Kawasaki S. Ishida H. Ishikawa K. Kosugi Y. Kikuchi H. Kawarwbayashi Y. Matsui I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18297-18309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), the folding structure of small loop 2 differs markedly between P. horikoshii and P. furiosus as shown in Fig.1 B. The structural flexibility of these two loop regions of phFEN-1 is also indicated by the superimposition of two independent subunit molecules from the dimer structure (data not shown). The two independent subunits form a dimer structure having a pseudo 2-fold symmetry as shown in Fig. 1 A. The concave sides of the molecules are facing each other, which produces a large cylindrical cavity. The molecular contacts are observed among small loops 1 and 3 and a part of the large loop as shown in Fig. 1 C. The regions 43–45 and 109–115 of one subunit are in contact with region 243–252 of the other subunit. The carboxyl group of Asp43has polar contacts with Lys249 and Glu252, but the mutated residue Glu42 has no direct intermolecular contact. The region 109–115 has the hydrophobic residues Leu109, Ala110, and Leu114 as shown in Fig. 1 C. These residues are in van der Waals contacts with the main chain peptide groups of region 243–246 of the other subunit. One large loop and four small loops (80–128, 39–55, 187–206, 234–249, and 257–263) were identified in the phFEN-1 molecule, as shown in Figs. 1and 2. Since several basic amino acids and their clusters were observed on these loops that were expected to be important for binding DNA, 45 mutant genes were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis to analyze the function of these positively charged clusters. The mutation points are summarized in Fig. 2. The expression level of each mutant in E. coli was ∼3-fold lower than that of the wild type. These mutants were purified using the same procedure as was used for the wild type. The molecular weight of each mutant was the same as for the wild type except R40E, which had a molecular weight half of that of the wild type, presumably due to proteolytic digestion. The R40E protein was not used in the subsequent experiment. The CD profiles of the mutant proteins were measured to confirm that no significant changes had occurred by site-directed mutagenesis. As shown in Fig. 3, the CD spectra of the mutants were the same as the spectrum of the wild type. Hence, the following kinetic analysis was performed using these mutant proteins. As shown in Fig. 2, two pairs of basic amino acids (Arg40 and Arg42, and Lys51 and Arg53) were observed typically on both edges of small loop 1 (39–55) with highly conserved amino acids (Leu47, Gly44, and Gly52) between the eukaryotes and archaea. Various mutations were introduced into this typical region to investigate the function of these residues. As shown in Fig. 4, the K m of the single mutants R40G and R42G both increased 7-fold, compared with that of the wild-type enzymes (WT). The K m value of the single mutant R40Q increased 10-fold, whereas that of R42Q was almost the same as the value for of WT. The K m andk cat/K m values of R42E were 19-fold higher and 25-fold lower than those of WT, respectively. These results indicate that the mutational effect was increased in the following order: no side chain < neutral side chain < negative side chain. The tendency was magnified for the double mutants. The K m value of R40G/R42G was elevated 26-fold compared with that of the wild type, as well as R40Q/R42Q. TheK m of R40E/R42E was increased 105-fold compared with WT, suggesting strong repulsion among these residues and DNA. Thek cat andk cat/K m values were also decreased 4- and 680-fold, respectively. On the other hand, the mutations of Lys51 and Arg53 showed little difference in the K m, k cat, and k cat/K m values compared with those of WT. Even the double mutant K51E/R53E retained 30% of the WT k cat/K m value. The K m value of L47G was increased 20-fold, whereas the values of a conservative mutant L47F was similar to that of WT. Thek cat values of both L47G and L47F were almost the same as that of WT. These findings indicated important hydrophobic interactions between Leu47 and other hydrophobic side chains to maintain the typical loop structure. The mutations at Gly44 and Gly52 had no significant effect on the K m, k cat, andk cat/K m values. Concerning small loop 2 (187–206), the basic cluster, Lys193, Arg194, and Lys195, is present on one side of the loop in which the conserved Lys199 is located in the middle as shown in Fig. 2. TheK m value of each of the single mutants K193A, R194A, and K195A was 4-, 5-, and 8-fold of WT, respectively, whereas thek cat values of these mutants were almost the same as for WT as shown in Fig. 4. For the triple mutant K193A/R194A/K195A, the K m value increased markedly and the k cat value decreased moderately. The negatively charged triple mutant K193E/R194E/K195E showed similar but more magnified effects on both parameters compared with the alanine triple mutant K193A/R194A/K195A, indicating ionic interactions of the positive cluster with DNA phosphate groups in an analogous manner to Arg40 and Arg42 on small loop 1. The values of K199A differed little from those of WT. One DNA binding motif was putatively identified at small loop 3 (234–249) in the molecular structure of FEN-1 from P. furiosus (19Hosfield D.J. Mol C.D. Shen B. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1998; 95: 135-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Small loop 4 (257–263) is also close to small loop 3. The positive residues, Lys243, Lys248, Lys249, and Lys263, and the conserved residue Tyr237 are located inside or close to the motif as shown in Fig. 2. Several mutants were made to investigate the function of these positive or conserved residues. However, the K m andk cat/K m values of the negative mutants (K243E and K263E) and the alanine mutants (K243A, K248A, K249A, K263A, and Y237A) did not change markedly compared with those of WT, indicating less significant roles for these positive residues compared with those on small loops 1 and 2. The large loop (80–128) is 49 amino acids in length, and contains many positive amino acids and positive clusters. The three clusters Lys87-Arg88-Lys89, Lys93-Arg94-Arg95, and Arg118-Lys119 are located in the upper region and at the side of the loop as shown in Fig. 2. For the first cluster, the K m and k cat values of R88A and K89A did not change markedly, compared with those of WT. Interestingly, the k cat value of K87A was decreased 400-fold, whereas the K m value was almost the same as that of WT, suggesting a significant role for Lys87 in the catalytic mechanism. Additive effects were observed for the triple mutant K87A/R88A/K89A in which theK m was 5-fold higher, although thek cat was 184-fold lower than that of WT due to the large contribution of K87A to the k catvalue. In the second cluster, the R94A mutation showed a 12-fold increase in the K m value and a 15-fold decrease in the k cat value, whereas the effects of the mutations K93A and R95A on both parameters were minor. TheK m and k cat values of the triple mutant K93A/R94A/R95A was increased by 17-fold and decreased by 96-fold, respectively, compared with those of WT, indicating the central role of Arg94 in binding the substrate in the middle of the positive cluster. In the third cluster, theK m value of the double mutant R118A/K119A was increased 10-fold, while the k cat value was almost the same as for WT. FEN-1 possesses 5′-flap endonuclea"

Standard abbreviations are used for amino acids Voltage-dependent sodium channels are integral plasma membrane proteins responsible for the rapidly rising phase of action potentials in most excitable tissues and are specifically targeted by many neurotoxins. These toxins bind to different receptor sites on the sodium channel and have facilitated its functional mapping and revealed its subtype diversity (reviewed by Catterall (1Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 953-985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Gray et al. (2Gray W.R. Olivera B.M. Cruz L.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 665-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar)). There are at least six reported neurotoxin receptor sites on the sodium channel. Five neurotoxin receptor sites were defined by Catterall (3Catterall W.A. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: S15-S48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and another new receptor site for the δ-conotoxins has been proposed by Fainzilber et al. (4Fainzilber M. Kofman O. Zlotkin E. Gordon D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2574-2580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,5Fainzilber M. Lodder J.C. Kits K.S. Kofman O. Vinnitsky I. Van Rietschoten J. Zlotkin E. Gordon D. J. Biol.

Several kinds of conotoxins have been found to bind to this new receptor site: δ-conotoxin TxVIA (δ-CTX TxVIA)1 from Conus textile (6Hillyard D. Olivera B. Woodward S. Corpuz G. Gray W. Ramilo C. Cruz L. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 358-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), δ-CTX GmVIA from Conus gloriamaris (7Shon K. Hasson A. Spira M. Cruz L. Gray W. Olivera B.

Among these conotoxins, δ-CTX TxVIA was originally found as a mollusk-specific conotoxin that slows sodium channel inactivation exclusively in mollusk neuronal membranes (9Hasson A. Fainzilber M. Gordon D. Zlotkin E. Spira M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1993; 5: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 10Lev-Ram V. Olivera B. Levitan I.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13201-13208Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, this peptide also exhibits high affinity binding to rat brain (silent binding) neuronal membranes, despite its lack of any toxic effect in vertebrates in vivo and in vitro(4Fainzilber M. Kofman O. Zlotkin E. Gordon D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2574-2580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding studies and electrophysiological tests with both vertebrate muscle and insect neuronal preparations have indicated that the silent binding sites of δ-CTX TxVIA are highly conserved among a wide range of distinct vertebrate and insect sodium channels. The latter finding indicates the existence of a pharmacological distinction between the silent and effective binding sites of δ-CTX TxVIA and highlights some structural differences that may be functionally important between the molluscan and rat brain sodium channels. δ-CTX TxVIA consists of 27 amino acid residues with three disulfide bonds. The cysteine topology of δ-CTX TxVIA is similar to those of ω-conotoxin MVIIA (ω-CTX MVIIA) obtained from Conus magus (12Olivera B.M. Cruz L.J. Santos V.d. LeCheminant G.W. Griffin D. Zeikus R. McIntosh J.M. Galyean R. Varga J. Gray W.R. Rivier J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2086-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) and ω-conotoxin GVIA (ω-CTX GVIA) from Conus geographus (13Olivera B.M. McIntosh J.M. Cruz L.J. Luque F.A. Gray W.R. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5087-5090Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), which are specific antagonists for N-type calcium channels (see Fig. 1). However, the amino acid residues of δ-CTX TxVIA are quite different from those of the other two peptides. For example, δ-CTX TxVIA has three negatively charged residues and a total charge of minus two, whereas ω-CTX MVIIA and ω-CTX GVIA have overall plus charges. Moreover, δ-CTX TxVIA has many hydrophobic residues, unlike in ω-CTX MVIIA and ω-CTX GVIA. Such differences in the amino acid sequences may play an important role in discriminating the specific target channel from the many other kinds of ion channels. In the present study, we determined for the first time the three-dimensional structure of one of the δ-conotoxins, δ-CTX TxVIA, in aqueous solutions by using two-dimensional NMR with simulated annealing. Based on analyses of the determined secondary and tertiary structure elements, the backbone conformation of δ-CTX TxVIA is similar to those of ω-CTX GVIA (14Davis J.H. Bradley E.K. Miljanich G.P.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10256-10265Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) reported previously. However, novel charge distribution and hydrophobic characteristics are present in δ-CTX TxVIA. A comparison of the δ-CTX TxVIA and other toxin structures and the structure-function relationships of calcium channel blockers are also discussed. δ-CTX TxVIA was chemically synthesized as described previously for TxVII (20Sasaki T. Feng Z.P. Scott R. Grigoriev N. Syed N.I. Fainzilber M. Sato K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12876-12884Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), except for a modification of the folding solution. Briefly, a linear precursor of δ-CTX TxVIA was assembled by Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) solid phase synthesis and was dissolved to a final concentration of 0.05 mm in 0.4 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.2) containing 20% methanol, 25% acetonitrile, EDTA (final 1 mm), and reduced and oxidized glutathione (each final 1.2 mm). The folding solution was stirred at 4 °C for 3 days and then acidified and filtrated. The peptides were concentrated on an ODS column by a medium pressure pump, and δ-CTX TxVIA was subsequently purified by chromatography on Sephadex G-50F and preparative reversed phase HPLC on an ODS column. The synthetic δ-CTX TxVIA was identified by coinjection with native δ-CTX TxVIA on reversed phase HPLC and by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy analysis. The disulfide bond pairings of δ-CTX TxVIA were determined by the same method as used for the determination of the disulfide bond pairings of ω-CTX TxVII (20Sasaki T. Feng Z.P. Scott R. Grigoriev N. Syed N.I. Fainzilber M. Sato K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12876-12884Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The authentic peptide, WCKQ/LDQNCCDG/VCT, which was connected by two definite disulfide bonds, was synthesized for the comparison with the fragment cut out from δ-CTX TxVIA by enzymatic digestions. The samples for NMR experiments were prepared at a concentration of ∼5 mm in either 99.96%2H2O or 90% H2O, 10%2H2O at pH 7.0. NMR measurements were performed using standard pulse sequences and phase cycling on either a Bruker AMX-500 or Avance-500 spectrometer operating at 500 MHz for the proton frequency. All two-dimensional NMR spectra were acquired in a phase-sensitive mode using the time-proportional phase incrementation (21Marion D. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 113: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (3523) Google Scholar) for quadrature detection in the t 1dimension. NOESY spectra (22Jeener J. Meier B.H. Bachmann P. Ernst R.R. J. Chem.

Reson. 1981; 43: 259-281Google Scholar) were recorded at temperatures of 15 and 25 °C with mixing times of 50, 100, 200, and 300 ms, respectively. TOCSY spectra were recorded using a MLEV-17 pulse scheme (24Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 65: 355-359Google Scholar) with isotropic mixing times of 50 and 80 ms. The suppression of the solvent resonance was achieved by using the WATERGATE scheme in both the NOESY and TOCSY spectra (25Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenár V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3518) Google Scholar). A DQF-COSY spectrum (26Rance M. Sørensen O.W. Bodenhausen G. Wagner G. Ernst R.R. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 117: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (2597) Google Scholar) was recorded to obtain the constraints for torsion angles. The suppression of the solvent resonance was achieved by using coherence selection with a gradient enhanced method (27Hurd R.E. J. Magn. Reson. 1990; 87: 422-428Google Scholar, 28von Kienlin M. Moonen C.T.W. van der Toorn A. van Zijl P.C.M. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 93: 423-429Google Scholar). No selective irradiation during the relaxation delay period was used to suppress the solvent resonance. A PE-COSY (29Mueller L. J. Magn. Reson. 1987; 72: 191-196Google Scholar) spectrum was recorded for stereospecific assignment in 99.96% 2H2O. The data processing was performed on either a Bruker X-32 UNIX work station with UXNMR software or a Silicon Graphics O2 work station with XWIN-NMR software. For the slowly exchanging backbone amide protons, the sample lyophilized from H2O was redissolved in2H2O and was identified by analyses of NOESY spectra recorded at time scales of 0.5, 3.0, 6.0, and 12 h. Chemical shifts were referenced to the methyl resonance of 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonic acid, used as an internal standard. Interproton distance restraints were obtained from the NOESY spectra with mixing times of either 100 or 300 ms. NOE data were divided into three classes, strong, medium, and weak, corresponding to upper limits of 2.5, 3.5, and 5.0 Å in the interproton distance restraints. Pseudo-atoms were used for non-stereospecifically assigned protons, and intra-residue and long range correcting factors were added to the distance restraints, respectively (30Wüthrich K. Billeter M. Braun W. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 169: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). In addition, 0.5 Å was added to the upper limits for distance restraints involving methyl protons (31Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Nilges M. Ryan C.A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8012-8023Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Nine additional constraints were added to define the three disulfide bonds involved in δ-CTX TxVIA. For each disulfide bond, there are three distance constraints, S(i)-S(j), S(i)-Cβ(j), and S(j)-Cβ(i), whose target values were set to 2.02 ± 0.02 Å, 2.99 ± 0.5 Å, and 2.99 ± 0.5 Å, respectively (32Nilges M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 229: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). After the initial calculation, 10 distance constraints for hydrogen bonds in the β-sheet, which were unambiguously defined, were added as target values of 1.8–2.3 Å for NH(i)-O(j) and 2.8–3.3 Å for N(i)-O(j), respectively. All calculations were carried out with the X-PLOR 3.1 program (33Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Manual, Version 3.1. Yale University, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structures were calculated on the basis of the experimentally derived distance and torsion angle constraints, using a dynamical simulated annealing protocol starting from a template structure with randomized backbone φ and ψ torsion angles. For a structural comparison, the coordinates of ω-CTX TxVII were obtained from the Protein Data Bank Entry 1F3K (34Kobayashi K. Sasaki T. Sato K. Kohno T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14761-14767Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). As an initial approach to the structural analysis, we determined the disulfide bonding pattern of δ-CTX TxVIA by an enzymatic fragmentation method (20Sasaki T. Feng Z.P. Scott R. Grigoriev N. Syed N.I. Fainzilber M. Sato K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12876-12884Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We confirmed that δ-CTX TxVIA has the same disulfide bonding pattern that is generally observed in other conotoxins, namely, Cys2–Cys17, Cys9–Cys21, and Cys16–Cys26. Sequence-specific resonance assignments were achieved according to the standard method established by Wüthrich and co-workers (35Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986: 125-127Google Scholar). The complete sequence-specific resonance assignments of δ-CTX TxVIA are summarized in the Supplementary Material. To determine the three-dimensional structure, we carried out the structural calculation using the X-PLOR-simulated annealing protocol (36Nilges M. Gronenborn A.M. Brünger A.T. Clore G.M. Protein Eng. 1988; 2: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). The input data of the NMR experimental constraints consisted of 387 distance and 28 dihedral constraints. Simulated annealing calculations were started from 100 initial random structures. We selected 20 final structures with lower energies. Structural statistics for the mean and 20 converged structures were evaluated in terms of structural parameters, as shown in TableI. The deviations from idealized covalent geometry were very small, and the Lennard-Jones van der Waals energy was large and negative, indicating that no distortions and no non-bonded bad contacts existed in the converged structures. The r.m.s. differences from the averaged coordinate positions were 0.35 ± 0.07 Å for the backbone atoms (N, Cα, and C) and 0.98 ± 0.14 Å for all heavy atoms (TableII).Table IStructural statistics for δ-CTX TxVIAStructural parameter20 converged structuresMean structureEnergetic statistics (kcal mol−1)E L–J−65.4 ± 11.6−83.1RMS deviations from idealized geometryBonds (Å)0.0029 ± 0.00020.0026Angles (degree)0.567 ± 0.0120.533Impropers (degree)0.405 ± 0.0170.381Ramachandran plot statisticsResidues in most favored region (%)51.3 Open table in a new tab Table IIRoot mean square differences for the 20 converged structures of δ-CTX TxVIAAtomic r.m.s. differences of 20 converged structures versus mean structure (Å)Residues 1–27Residues 7–9, 20–22, 25–27Backbone(N, Cα, C)0.35 ± 0.070.21 ± 0.09(N, Cα, C, O)0.42 ± 0.090.22 ± 0.09All heavy atoms0.98 ± 0.140.73 ± 0.11The r.m.s.d. values were obtained by best fitting the backbone atoms (N, Cα, C) coordinates for all of the residues of the 20 converged structures.

The numbers given for the backbone and all heavy atoms represent the mean values ± S.D. Fig.2, a and b, show stereopair representations of the best-fit superposition of the backbone atoms (N, Cα, C) for the 20 converged structures. An analysis of the 20 converged structures indicates that the molecular structure of δ-CTX TxVIA contains a β-sheet region composed of three short β-strands, i.e. β-strand 1 (Glu7 to Cys9), β-strand 2 (Tyr20to Ile22), and β-strand 3 (Val25 to Thr27). It can be classified as a triple-stranded antiparallel β-sheet of the topology +2x, −1 (37Richardson J.S. Adv. Protein Chem. 1981; 34: 167-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (3058) Google Scholar), as shown in Fig.2, a and b. The β-sheet is the best defined region through the entire molecule, as indicated by the small values of the corresponding backbone r.m.s.d. values (Table II), and the extent of each β-strand is limited by the presence of the characteristic turn structures. We identified the turns by using the standard definition, that the distance between Cα(i) and Cα(i+ 3) is less than 7 Å (38Lewis P.N. Momany F.A. Scherega H.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 303: 211-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar), and by evaluating the characteristic distance connectivities of the backbone protons (35Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986: 125-127Google Scholar) for the corresponding turn segments in the 20 final converged structures and their mean structure. These analyses led to the identification of four β-turns, which were classified according to Wilmot and Thornton (39Wilmot C.M. Thornton J.M. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 479-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The four β-turns involve residues Gln4 to Glu7 (type II), Asn10 to Asp13 (type I), Cys16 to Gly19(type I), and Ile22 to Val25 (type II′). These turns are stabilized by the hydrogen bonds between the carbonyl group (i) and the amide proton (i+ 3) of the peptide backbone. The hydrogen-deuterium exchange experiment led to the identification of the slowly exchanging amide protons originating from these four turns. The characteristic φ and ψ angle ranges of the β-turns are conserved in all 20 converged structures and show high convergence in a Ramachandran plot (not shown). As described above, the molecular architecture of δ-CTX TxVIA is composed of a number of intramolecular hydrogen bonds and three disulfide bonds, resulting in a compact, well defined structure over the entire molecule. The disulfide bonds between Cys2 and Cys17 and between Cys16 and Cys26constrain the peptide backbone into close spatial contact between the third β-turn (Cys16 to Gly19) and the N and C termini, respectively, and the disulfide bond between Cys9and Cys21 interconnects β-strands 1 and 2. Consequently, the disulfide bonds between Cys2 and Cys17 and between Cys9 and Cys21 are located at the surface, and the disulfide bond between Cys16 and Cys26 is buried within the molecule. In the present study, we have determined the three-dimensional structure of δ-CTX TxVIA in aqueous solution by using 1H NMR spectroscopy and simulated annealing calculations. δ-CTX TxVIA is composed of a short triple-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and several turns. The overall β-sheet topology is +2x, −1, which is the same as those reported for ω-CTX GVIA and ω-CTX MVIIA, N-type calcium channel blockers. As shown in Fig. 3, the global conformation of δ-CTX TxVIA is similar to those of the structurally well characterized ω-CTX GVIA (14Davis J.H. Bradley E.K. Miljanich G.P. Nadasdi L. Ramachandran J.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 19Kohno T. Kim J.-I. Kobayashi K. Kodera Y. Maeda T. Sato K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10256-10265Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Despite the relatively low amino acid sequence homology among the many conotoxins, the toxin structures exhibit similar locations and orientations of the secondary structure elements in their three-dimensional coordinates. In terms of the numbers of amino acids between Cys residues, δ-CTX TxVIA is the same as ω-CTX MVIIA. The numbers of amino acids between each Cys residue are identical, i.e. six, six, zero, three, and four for both peptides (see Fig. 1). Therefore, the backbone structures of both peptides can be estimated to be similar to each other. In fact, the backbone r.m.s.d. between residues 2 and 26 of δ-CTX TxVIA and residues 1 and 25 of ω-CTX MVIIA is 0.9 Å, indicating that the backbone architecture is almost the same between these two toxins. However, the types of side chains of both peptides are completely different between these two peptides, except for the six Cys residues, Lys3, and Gly18 (in δ-CTX TxVIA). These facts indicate that the cysteine knot motif, which is often seen among the conotoxins, is important for the backbone architecture formation, but not for the selectivity of channel types. This is supported by former studies. (i) It was reported that changes in the number and the pairings of disulfide bonds resulted in partial disruption of the biologically active structure, leading to a reduction of the channel-blocking activity in the case of ω-CTX GVIA (40Pennington M.W. Fetsin S.M. Maccecchini M.L. Kem W.R. Toxicon. 1992; 30: 755-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 41Sabo, T., Gilon, C., Shafferman, A., Elhanaty, E., Peptides: Chemistry and Biology, Proceedings of the 12th American Peptide Symposium, 1992, 159, 160, Dordrecht, The Netherlands.Google Scholar). (ii) Pallaghy et al. (15Pallaghy P.K. Duggan B.M. Pennington M.W. Norton R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 405-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) found that the structures of disulfide isomers of ω-CTX GVIA displayed some conformational heterogeneity in solution, with a significant loss of the structural features of the native molecule. (iii) Linear analogs of ω-CTX MVIIA and ω-CTX GVIA, with full deletions of the three disulfide bonds, showed a complete loss in their binding affinity for N-type calcium channels. We have recently determined the solution structure of ω-CTX TxVII, another toxin from Conus textile (34Kobayashi K. Sasaki T. Sato K. Kohno T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14761-14767Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This peptide is known to bind to mollusk L-type calcium channels. However, ω-CTX TxVII is similar to δ-CTX TxVIA, in that both peptides have many hydrophobic residues. Therefore, we compared the structure of δ-CTX TxVIA with that of ω-CTX TxVII. Fig. 4, a–d, show the positive, negative, and hydrophobic residue representations of δ-CTX TxVIA and ω-CTX TxVII. In these figures, both peptides have a hydrophobic patch on the bottom side of the molecules. However, the distributions of other hydrophobic residues are rather different between these two peptides. The residues corresponding to Ala4 and Met25 of ω-CTX TxVII are the hydrophilic (white color) Ser5 and Thr27 of δ-CTX TxVIA, respectively. Furthermore, ω-CTX TxVII has an extra hydrophobic residue, Trp26. These three hydrophobic residues of ω-CTX TxVII form another hydrophobic patch on the left side of the molecule in Fig. 4 c. However, there are hydrophilic residues on the left side of the δ-CTX TxVIA molecule in Fig. 4 a. Furthermore, the corresponding residues Trp1 of δ-CTX TxVIA and Leu13 of ω-CTX TxVII are not hydrophobic residues, respectively. As for charged residues, there is a prominent difference between these two peptides. ω-CTX TxVII has no counterpart of the negatively charged Asp18 in δ-CTX TxVIA (Fig. 4, a andc). These residues may cause the different specificity for ion channels between δ-CTX TxVIA and ω-CTX TxVII. δ-CTX TxVIA has many hydrophobic residues, i.e. Trp1, Met8, Leu11, Leu12, Tyr20, Ile22, Val23, Leu24, and Val25 (Fig. 1). This is characteristic of the δ-conotoxins, δ-CTX TxVIA, δ-CTX GmVIA δ-CTX PVIA, δ-CTX GmVIA, and NgVIA, which affect sodium current inactivation. Fig. 4 b shows the distribution of the hydrophobic residues on the three-dimensional structure. Although the hydrophobic residues are dispersed on the primary structure, they are clustered and form a hydrophobic patch (Fig. 4 b) on the three-dimensional structure. Some reasons why the hydrophobic residues are clustered on the three-dimensional structure may be as follows. (i) δ-CTX TxVIA may dimerize via the hydrophobic patch. (ii) δ-CTX TxVIA may bind to sodium channels via the hydrophobic patch. However, we did not observe the dimerization of δ-CTX TxVIA, as confirmed by gel filtration at a neutral pH and at an even higher concentration of the peptide (data not shown). Therefore, the hydrophobic patch of δ-CTX TxVIA may play an important role in binding to the sodium channels. The sodium channel from rat brain is a heterotrimeric protein with an αβ1β2 composition, but it is known that the α-subunit is sufficient to provide voltage-sensitive sodium gating in vitro (3Catterall W.A. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: S15-S48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Fozzard H.A. Hanck D.A. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 887-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The α-subunit contains four homologous transmembrane domains connected by cytoplasmic linkers. The intracellular linker between domains III and IV has been identified as the inactivation domain, as revealed by the following facts. (i) Antibodies directed against the III–IV linker completely block fast inactivation (43Vassilev P.M. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Science. 1988; 241: 1658-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 44Vassilev P. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8147-8151Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). (ii) Inactivation does not occur in channels in which this linker is clipped and domain IV is expressed independently of domains I–III (45Stühmer W. Conti F. Suzuki H. Wang X.D. Noda M. Yahagi N. Kubo H. Numa S. Nature. 1989; 339: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). (iii) Deletions or mutations in the III–IV linker show slow or no inactivation (46Kellenberger S. West J.W. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 589-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 47Patton D.E. West J.W. Catterall W.A. Goldin A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10905-10909Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). A hydrophobic triad of amino acids, IFM (residues 1488–1490), has been identified as a critical motif for inactivation (48Eaholtz G. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1041-1048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 49Eaholtz G. Zagotta W.N. Catterall W.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 50West J.W. Patton D.E. Scheuer T. Wang Y. Goldin A.L. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10910-10914Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Thiol modification experiments indicated that the III–IV linker undergoes a conformational change associated with inactivation that renders the phenylalanine in the IFM motif inaccessible, leading to the proposal that the III–IV linker functions as a hinged lid with the IFM motif serving as a hydrophobic latch that occludes the ion pore (51Kellenberger S. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30971-30979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Recently, the solution structure of the inactivation gate of the rat sodium channel was reported (52Rohl C.A. Boeckman F.A. Baker C. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Klevit R.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 855-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The structured region of the gate peptide includes the hydrophobic IFM motif and extends C-terminally to Ser1506, which is required for modulation of inactivation by protein kinase C (53West J.W. Numann R. Murphy B.J. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Science. 1991; 254: 866-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The backbone of the inactivation gate forms an α-helix capped at its N terminus by a turn structure, with the hydrophobic IFM motif immediately N-terminal to this turn. These residues are important for the inactivation of the sodium channel, as revealed by the fact that mutants in which these residues are modified by a bulky reagent did not show any inactivation (52Rohl C.A. Boeckman F.A. Baker C. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Klevit R.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 855-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Taken together, the mechanism of the slow inactivation of the sodium channels by δ-CTX TxVIA may be considered as follows (1Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 953-985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). δ-CTX TxVIA binds directly to the hydrophobic residues, such as the IFM motif, of the inactivation gate through its hydrophobic patch (2Gray W.R. Olivera B.M. Cruz L.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 665-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). δ-CTX TxVIA binds to the inactivation gate binding interface of the sodium channel (3Catterall W.A. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: S15-S48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). δ-CTX TxVIA binds to another hydrophobic region of the sodium channel and allosterically inhibits the inactivation. In each of these scenarios, the hydrophobic patch of δ-CTX TxVIA, found in this study, may play an important role in the binding with the sodium channels. There are several kinds of conotoxins that affect sodium current inactivation. These conotoxins may be classified in two categories: 1) conotoxins that affect the sodium channel inactivation in rat brain. (2Gray W.R. Olivera B.M. Cruz L.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 665-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Conotoxins that affect sodium channel inactivation in mollusks, but act as antagonists in the rat brain. δ-CTX PVIA and NgVIA are classified in the first category, and δ-CTX TxVIA and δ-CTX GmVIA are classified in the second category. What are the differences between these two categories? The amino acid sequences of δ-CTX PVIA and NgVIA are similar. Especially, both peptides have the same sequence between residues Hyp6 and Ser19. In these sequences a hydrophobic residue, Leu12, in δ-CTX TxVIA is replaced by a positively charged residue, Lys, in both δ-CTX PVIA and NgVIA. Moreover, the conserved residues, Gln14 and Asn15, in δ-CTX TxVIA and δ-CTX GmVIA are replaced by Gly and Leu in δ-CTX PVIA and NgVIA, respectively. All of these residues are in the proximity of the hydrophobic patch, the putative sodium channel binding site. Therefore, these residues may play an important role in discriminating the mollusk sodium channel from the rat brain sodium channel. To discuss this in more detail, the three-dimensional structure of a toxin in the first category, δ-CTX PVIA or NgVIA, should be determined. The solution structure of δ-CTX TxVIA reported here should contribute to our understanding of the structure and action of sodium channel agonists and antagonists and will be useful in designing synthetic organic compounds to control sodium current inactivation.

To characterize this post-translational modification and resolve individual molecular mass species, we subjected purified calsequestrin to mass spectrometry using electrospray ionization.

In heart, mass peaks indicated carbohydrate modifications characteristic of transit through Golgi compartments. Phosphorylation did not occur on every glycoform present, suggesting a far more complex movement of calsequestrin molecules in heart cells. Significant amounts of calsequestrin contained glycan with only a single mannose residue, indicative of a novel post-endoplasmic reticulum mannosidase activity.

Cardiac SR has been morphologically and biochemically characterized as consisting of two major compartments, free SR and junctional SR, which form terminal cisternae apposing tubular invaginations of the sarcolemma (1Meissner G.

Furthermore, cellular transport of cardiac CSQ is thought to be different from the fast-twitch protein (13Campbell K.P. MacLennan D.H. Jorgensen A.O. Mintzer M.C. J. Biol.

A function for CSQ phosphorylation by CK2 has not been determined; however, a mechanism for sorting of resident ER and Golgi proteins by CK2 phosphorylation on cytosolic sites has been characterized (24Mauxion F., Le Borgne R.

In this study, we report definitive structural findings for CSQ revealed by mass spectrometry, reflecting its cellular transport in heart and muscle cells. CSQ glycosylation and phosphorylation, although highly similar in nonmuscle cells as diverse as human embryonic kidney (HEK) and insect Sf21 cells, were distinctly different in muscle cells, reflecting a pathway in muscle not present or not accessible in nonmuscle, one in which phosphorylation on CK2 sites exists in a complex compartmental relationship with glycan-modifying reactions. HEK 293 cells were grown at 37 °C (5% CO2) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm HEPES, 25 mm glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B solution. Sf21 insect cells were incubated in ESF-921 serum-free medium (Expression Systems, LLC). Canine tissues were obtained from three separate mongrel dogs under anesthesia. Animals were obtained from authorized suppliers and maintained in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines. The Division of Laboratory Animal Resources of Wayne State University is fully equipped and licensed by the appropriate agencies. Replication-deficient adenoviruses containing wild-type canine cardiac CSQ cDNA (Ad.CSQ) or a triple point S378A,S382A,S386A mutant (Ad.nPP) that removed CK2 phosphorylation sites (16Cala S.E. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 391-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were amplified from the λgt10 clone IC3A (14Scott B.T. Simmerman H.K. Collins J.H. Nadal-Ginard B. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8958-8964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by PCR (31Saiki R.K. Bugawan T.L. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Erlich H.A. Nature. 1986; 324: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar) and primers containing restriction sites for directional cloning. The forward primer contained 63 bp of 5′-untranslated sequence, the reverse primer, 5 bp of 3′-untranslated sequence. The mutating reverse primer (67-mer) contained 3 single base changes necessary for Ser to Ala conversion. PCR products were cloned into pBluescript (Stratagene), sequenced by the dideoxy method (32Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar), and then subcloned into a transfer plasmid (pAbl.CMV) containing the cytomegolovirus major immediate-early promoter. Recombinant viruses were identified by restriction endonuclease digestion and isolated by CsCl density centrifugation, with titers of viral stocks determined by plaque assay using HEK 293 cells (33Graham F.L. Smiley J. Russell W.C. Nairn R. J. Gen. Virol. 1977; 36: 59-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (3512) Google Scholar). Plaque-purified clones were expanded in HEK 293 cells, and virus preparations were purified by CsCl density centrifugation. Titers of viral stocks were determined by plaque assay using HEK 293 cells. Recombinant baculovirus encoding canine cardiac was prepared as previously described (34Cala S.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1496: 296-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells were infected with recombinant adenoviruses at a multiplicity of infection of ∼1.0 for 4 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum, then incubated under our normal conditions for 48–72 h. Sf21 cells were infected with recombinant baculovirus for 48 h in ESF 921 medium. All recombinant adenovector work was carried out in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines for research involving recombinant DNA molecules and the policies of the Wayne State University Office of Environmental Health and Safety. Purification of CSQ from cultures of HEK 293 and Sf21 cells was carried out 2 d post-infection. Cell pellets were resuspended at 1 mg/ml in buffer A containing 20 mmMOPS, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 1% CHAPS, 0.5 mmEGTA, and 0.5% of a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). 10 mm NaF and 10 mm β-glycerophosphate were included in the buffer to inhibit protein phosphatases. Extracts were centrifuged at 50,000 × g × 20 min, bound to DEAE-Sephacel (Amersham Biosciences), and then washed extensively in buffer B (buffer A without CHAPS) until detergent was removed. CSQ was eluted in buffer B with 750 mm NaCl. Eluate was loaded onto phenyl-agarose and purification carried out as previously described (35Cala S.E. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11932-11936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with calsequestrin eluted in purified form by adding 20 mm CaCl2 to the elution buffer. SDS-PAGE was carried out according to Laemmli (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Protein assays were carried out using a Lowry protocol (37Lowry H.O. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Native CSQs from canine left ventricles and hind leg muscles were also purified as previously described (35Cala S.E. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11932-11936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Homogenization was carried out in a buffer containing 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and phosphatase inhibitors as described above. Membrane vesicles were isolated from homogenates following removal of only a 500 ×g pellet to recover a larger portion of CSQ-containing membranes. CSQ phosphorylation and dephosphorylation were carried out as previously described (16Cala S.E. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 391-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For phosphorylation, 0.2 μg of calsequestrin was incubated in 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20 μm [γ-32P]ATP, and 10 ng of purified CK2 (Promega). When samples were pretreated with acid phosphatase, 1 μg of calsequestrin was incubated for 20 min in 30 μl of 30 mm MES buffer, pH 5.8, 0.1 mm EGTA with or without the addition of 0.05 units of acid phosphatase (Sigma), determined to be the minimal amount capable of removing all radioactivity resulting from CK2. Phosphatase- or control-treated samples were diluted 10-fold to neutral pH in the presence of sufficient kinase to label calsequestrin to high stoichiometry. For mass spectrometry, salts and buffers were removed from calsequestrin samples by repeated centrifugations through a Centricon-30 concentrator (Amicon) after the addition of 20 mm EGTA to phenyl-agarose-purified samples to chelate Ca2+. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was carried out at the Biotechnology Resource Facility of the HHMI Biopolymer Facility/W. M. Keck Foundation, Yale University, using a Q-ToF mass spectrometer (Micromass, Altrincham, UK). Prior to analysis, samples were desalted using C-4 ZipTips (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The eluted samples in 50% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid were analyzed using the nanospray technique in positive ion mode. Masses were calculated using Q-Tof MassLynx software. Spectra were calibrated using either sodium iodide or the fragment ions from the MS/MS spectrum of (Glu)fibrinogen (Sigma). Cardiac CSQ purified from dog heart contains significant levels of phosphate (>1 mol/mol) on a carboxyl-terminal cluster of serine residues that are in vitro substrates of protein kinase CK2. To determine whether this reaction is unique to heart cells, we analyzed the purified CSQ from HEK and Sf21 cells, following heterologous expression in nonmuscle cells using a recombinant adenovirus or baculovirus. Cardiac CSQ was phosphorylated by purified CK2 either under control conditions or following treatment with acid phosphatase to remove endogenous phosphate. Pretreatment with phosphatase led to increases in32P incorporation into CSQ, showing that CK2 sites in CSQ existed predominantly in a phosphorylated form in nonmuscle cells. Levels of endogenous CSQ phosphorylation in ER were comparable with that observed in cardiac SR (Fig.1 A). Phosphatase treatments increased subsequent CK2 phosphorylation by 2–4-fold, depending upon the cell type. CSQ purification from canine skeletal muscle led to isolation of both CSQ isoforms, with the fast-twitch form (63 kDa) being the predominant one, as previously reported (38Damiani E. Volpe P. Margreth A. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1990; 11: 522-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Application of our phosphatase/CK2 kinase assay to the skeletal muscle preparation showed that, as in heart tissue, cardiac CSQ (55 kDa) was present mainly as the phosphoprotein (Fig. 1 B), whereas the canine fast-twitch isoform did not accumulate in a phosphorylated form (Fig.1 B, upper band). To try and resolve individual forms of phosphorylated CSQ, we subjected purified CSQ to mass spectrometry using electrospray ionization. Mass spectrometry of purified wild-type CSQ from HEK cells showed a series of mass peaks differing by about 81 Da, consistent with a mixture of molecules differing by a single phosphate moiety (Fig.2 A). In contrast, the phosphorylation site mutant nPP showed a series of mass peaks that differed by ∼162 Da, consistent with a mixture of glycoforms differing by a single mannose (Fig. 2 B). Mass peaks for CSQversus the nPP mutant also reflected the ∼47 Da difference between three serines and three alanines. The mass peaks for wild-type CSQ and the nPP mutant in Fig. 2 are offset by 47 Da to align equivalent mass peaks. Comparison of the aligned spectra for wild-type CSQ and the nPP mutant from HEK cells (compare Fig. 1, A and B) shows that wild-type CSQ consists of two glycoforms (Man8- and Man9GlcNAc) along with three additional phosphoforms. For example, the mass expected for unmodified cardiac CSQ transcript is 45,269 Da, and CSQ containing a single high mannose oligosaccharide is 47,135 Da (Man9GlcNAc2 = 1865 Da). As predicted, this exact mass peak (47,135 Da) appears in the CSQ spectrum along with 3 peaks of higher mass at 81-Da intervals, corresponding to protein molecules (with the oligosaccharide Man9GlcNAc2) in unphosphorylated, singly, doubly, and triply phosphorylated states. All CSQ phosphate resided on the cardiac-specific carboxyl-terminal serine cluster Ser378,382,386, because the latter three mass forms were absent from the nPP mutant. CSQ molecules in which the oligosaccharide has been trimmed to Man8GlcNAc2 (and contains no phosphate) have an expected mass of ∼46,974 Da, in agreement with the first mass peak observed in Fig.1 A. Peaks corresponding to phosphorylated Man8GlcNAc2 are obscured by the fact that the difference in mass due to a single mannose residue (162 Da) is very nearly the same as the mass change from two phosphates (2 × 81 Da). Thus, for example, the peak of 47,135 Da corresponds both to the Man8GlcNAc2 glycoform with two phosphates and Man9GlcNAc2 with no phosphates. Therefore, wild-type CSQ from HEK cells existed in only two glycoforms, and both glycoforms appeared to exist in each of four phosphoforms (0–3 sites occupied, summarized in Fig. 4). The nPP form of CSQ existed as five glycoforms, indicating more extensive glycan processing than occurred for the wild-type protein. The mass spectrum for wild-type CSQ overexpressed in Sf21 insect cells was very similar to that from HEK cells, yielding a spectrum containing the identical six peaks (data not shown, but see Fig. 4). To validate our interpretation of the spectra for CSQ and nPP in HEK cells, we analyzed CSQ and nPP from HEK cells treated with 0.5 μg/ml tunicamycin over the entire time course of overexpression, a treatment known to prevent N-linked glycosylation (39Struck D.K. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1007-1013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mass spectrum for CSQ treated with tunicamycin yielded a mass peak corresponding to the amino acid backbone (deduced mass = 45,269 Da) and three higher mass peaks separated by roughly 80 Da, corresponding to molecules having one, two, and three phosphates (Fig.2 C). The vast majority of CSQ molecules contained two or three phosphates, showing that glycosylation per se was not necessary for phosphorylation to occur. If CK2 phosphorylation sites were also removed, then all of the CSQ was synthesized as a single mass species of 45,269 (Fig. 2 D), which is the deduced mass of the expressed canine CSQ clone without any covalent modifications. Mass spectrometry of native CSQ purified from canine ventricular tissue gave a mass spectrum that was more complex than that from HEK and Sf21 cells (Fig. 3, upper panel). As for HEK cells, tissue CSQ showed a succession of mass peaks separated by 81 Da, representing a similar combination of glyco- and phosphoforms. The masses of native CSQ molecules, however, were lower by 70 Da than the recombinant protein from HEK and Sf21 cells. This difference may be because of a polymorphism within the animal source of our native CSQ sample, compared with the protein encoded by the well characterized cardiac CSQ cDNA IC3A (14Scott B.T. Simmerman H.K. Collins J.H. Nadal-Ginard B. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8958-8964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) used in both virus constructs (and from which the deduced mass was calculated). Thus, for example, assuming that the lowest peak seen for tissue CSQ corresponded to a glycoform with no phosphate, the peak of 45,916 Da represents the structure Man1GlcNAc2 but with an additional 79 Da moiety attached to the protein backbone. Therefore, it does not affect any of the differences in mass observed for CSQ isoforms. The nature of this mass discrepancy was not further investigated. Compared with nonmuscle, molecules of CSQ from heart tissue exhibited a greater degree of mannose trimming and a larger range of glycoforms (Man1 through Man6), and glycoforms were less uniformly phosphorylated. For example, for one of the highest mass peaks observed (46,559 Da, Man5), no protein peak was found having a mass 81 Da higher. A much smaller peak at 162 Da higher, therefore, represents an additional mannose (Man6), which also lacked additional phosphate-containing mass peaks. On the other hand, the lowest glycoform masses (45,916 and 46,238 Da, Man1,3) appeared to exist in all 4 phosphoforms (0–3 sites occupied). Again, glycoforms and phosphoforms are schematically shown in Fig. 4. The mass peak at 46,398 Da represents Man3 plus 2 phosphates but may also contain molecules of Man4 with no phosphate, in which case it appears that these molecules are also not phosphorylated in vivo, because there is no peak corresponding to Man4 plus 3 phosphates. In summary, Man1,3 are partially to fully phosphorylated in vivo, whereas Man4–6 remain unphosphorylated. To compare the mass spectrum for the fast-twitch isoform, we purified CSQ from canine hind leg muscle by a procedure identical to that for heart tissue. The mass spectrum for the skeletal muscle protein (Fig.3, lower panel) consisted of only two protein peaks, separated by 323 Da, a difference of two mannose residues. This pattern appears to be maintained in the cardiac isoform as well (comparearrowheads in both panels). Based upon a deduced mass of 42,216 for the canine fast-twitch skeletal muscle isoform, 2L. Jones, personal communication. the 2 peaks in the mass spectrum of 42,810 and 43,133 Da are likely to represent the Man1GlcNAc2 and Man3GlcNAc2 forms but with each population of molecules leaving an additional 25 Da unaccounted for (again most likely representing a polymorphism within the sample studied here, compared with that from which the cDNA clone was derived). Most notable in the fast-twitch isoform was the absence of phosphate in the two observed glycoforms, a finding in agreement with our in vitro phosphorylation data (Fig. 1 B). In Fig. 4, we have summarized the data from the mass spectra, providing a schematic view of the distributions of CSQ glyco- and phosphoforms. In cases where mass peaks probably contain contributions from more than one glycoform, we have approximated relative contributions, as detailed in the figure legend. Cellular trafficking of CSQ in muscle and nonmuscle cells is readily visualized by mass spectrometric analysis of intact CSQ molecules, which is unusually revealing given the nature of CSQ as a soluble ER/SR glycoprotein with a single oligosaccharide. Resolution of CSQ microheterogeneity yields important insights into its intracellular trafficking by charting the actions of intracellular mannosidases and yields insights into CSQ phosphorylation by revealing differences in the degree of phosphorylation among many CSQ glycoforms. Cardiac CSQ contained between 1.5 and 2.0 mol Pi/mol protein on CK2 sites, whether biosynthesized in canine heart or in nonmuscle cells. Phosphorylation of cardiac CSQ varied from non-phosphorylated to fully (3 mol/mol) phosphorylated. Interestingly, nonmuscle cells contained sufficient calsequestrin kinase to produce high steady levels of the phosphorylated protein, even upon overexpression to levels comparable with that of heart cells. Mass spectrometry showed similar patterns of phosphorylation on similar glycoforms in human and insect cells, indicating an extraordinary conservation of protein processing and suggesting that phosphorylation of lumenal ER/SR proteins may be a ubiquitous cellular reaction. Although the mechanism and precise cellular compartmentation remain uncertain, it appears that CSQ phosphorylation involves CK2 or a CK2-like protein kinase which co-localizes with CSQ, if only transiently. In all cells, CSQ glycosylation occurred on only one of its two potentialN-glycosylation sites, likely Asn316 because this site is highly conserved among species and isoforms (40Yano K. Zarain-Herzberg A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 135: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Prevention of glycosylation with tunicamycin did not prevent phosphorylation on CK2 sites, and besides N-glycosylation and phosphorylation on Ser378,382,386 no other modifications of CSQ occurred. Nonetheless, glycan processing was different in muscle and nonmuscle cells. The predominant glycoforms of cardiac CSQ in nonmuscle cells were Man9GlcNAc2 and Man8GlcNAc2, consistent with processing by ER α 1,2-mannosidase and indicative of a protein that does not leave the ER (41Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3779) Google Scholar, 42Herscovics A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 96-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 43Helenius A. Aebi M. Science. 2001; 291: 2364-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1999) Google Scholar). The mechanism for ER retention of CSQ is unknown, as has been previously been discussed (44Fliegel L. Burns K. Wlasichuk K. Michalak M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1989; 67: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 45Cala S.E. Scott B.T. Jones L.R. Semin. Cell Biol. 1990; 1: 265-275PubMed Google Scholar) and investigated (46Nori A. Nadalini K.A. Martini A. Rizzuto R. Villa A. Volpe P. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1420-C1428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Gatti G. Trifari S. Mesaeli N. Parker J.M. Michalak M. Meldolesi J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 525-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Although many resident ER proteins contain the carboxyl-terminal peptide retrieval signal -KDEL (48Munro S. Pelham H.R. Cell. 1987; 48: 899-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1590) Google Scholar), this sequence is absent from CSQ and other muscle-specific resident SR/ER proteins (44Fliegel L. Burns K. Wlasichuk K. Michalak M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1989; 67: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 45Cala S.E. Scott B.T. Jones L.R. Semin. Cell Biol. 1990; 1: 265-275PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to Man8 and 9 forms in nonmuscle ER, maturation of cardiac CSQ in heart led predominantly to Man1, 3, and 4 forms of the glycan with most present as Man1 or 3, indicative of transit through the Golgi and the actions of post-ER mannosidases (41Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3779) Google Scholar, 42Herscovics A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 96-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 43Helenius A. Aebi M. Science. 2001; 291: 2364-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1999) Google Scholar). These data are in agreement with previous biochemical analyses by Jorgensenet al. (21Jorgensen A.O. Kalnins V.I. Zubrzycka E. MacLennan D.H. J. Cell Biol. 1977; 74: 287-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), who reported that fast-twitch CSQ exists predominantly as the Man3GlcNAc2 glycoform. Golgi transit of CSQ was also reported by Thomas et al. (22Thomas K. Navarro J. Benson R.J. Campbell K.P. Rotundo R.L. Fine R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3140-3145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who showed that CSQ is transported to terminal cisternae of the SR junction in clathrin-coated vesicles in developing chick skeletal myotubes. A mechanism by which CSQ could move through the Golgi complex in muscle but could not move beyond the ER in nonmuscle represents an interesting area for future research. Cardiac CSQ exhibited a complex pattern of phosphorylation on molecules that are clearly processed within the secretory pathway, whereas the fast-twitch isoform was not phosphorylated, consistent with results of point mutants using this isoform (49Nori A. Gola E. Tosato S. Cantini M. Volpe P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C974-C981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 50Nori A. Furlan S. Patiri F. Cantini M. Volpe P. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 260: 40-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Cardiac CSQ existed in a broad range of glycoforms; those which contained phosphate (Man1,3) and those lacking phosphate (Man4–6). The pattern of phosphorylated glycoforms suggests that transit to specific compartments may require prior phosphorylation or that some compartments may contain a CSQ phosphatase. It could also be that phosphorylated glycoforms of cardiac CSQ do not co-localize with non-phosphorylated glycoforms, a possibility that is currently under investigation. Nevertheless, our data support the idea that there exists a cellular relationship between glycosylation, a modification generally viewed as a marker for cell transport, and the phosphorylation state of the molecule. Among CSQ glycoforms that do undergo phosphorylation (Man1,3), 10–20% of the molecules contained no phosphate. It is hypothesized that these phosphate-free molecules are part of a dynamic phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle. In nonmuscle cells, deletion of phosphorylation sites from CSQ resulted in a roughly 2-fold decrease in the Man9 glycoform in favor of a mannose-trimmed glycan, reflecting the actions of ER α 1,2-mannosidase and Golgi α 1,2-mannosidase I, the enzymes generally thought to reduce glycans to Man5 (41Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3779) Google Scholar, 42Herscovics A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 96-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 43Helenius A. Aebi M. Science. 2001; 291: 2364-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1999) Google Scholar). This divergence between glycosylation and phosphorylation of cardiac CSQ in nonmuscle as well as muscle cells may reflect divergent pathways that lead to differential glycosylation in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. A similar divergence of phosphorylation and glycosylation was previously reported for the lumenal ER glycoprotein GRP94 (34Cala S.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1496: 296-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), where CK2 phosphorylation in intact cells occurred for only one of two distinct pathways for glycoprotein processing. In conclusion, heart cells process CSQ through two primary processes within the secretory pathway on the way to retention by terminal cisternae, N-glycosylation, and phosphorylation on CK2 sites. The distribution of phosphate among CSQ glycoforms suggests that phosphorylation and glycosylation processes involve both a common and a distinct cellular compartmentation. Details of CSQ transit in cardiac cells may shed light on mechanisms that regulate calcium transients by maintaining levels of component proteins in terminal cisternae.

https://openalex.org/W2030929183,"Identification of the environmental triggers involved in the expression of virulence genes is a fundamental objective in studies of bacterial pathogens. For uropathogens, urea, found in the urinary tract at concentrations of up to 500 mm, functions as an environmental signal. Urea freely diffuses into the bacterium Providencia stuartii and activates UreR, a member of the AraC family of transcriptional activators. Active UreR promotes transcription of virulence-associated urease genes and alerts the organisms of its immediate milieu. Thus, the UreR·urea complex has a dual role, acting as both a transcriptional activator as well as an environmental sensor. Here, we describe the molecular events associated with activation of gene expression by urea-bound UreR. The K d of the urea·UreR binding reaction was measured as 0.2 mm by fluorescence quenching assays, and the shape of the binding curve indicated a single specific urea-binding site on UreR. Histidine residues are critical for urea binding in urease, and therefore to identify the urea-binding site in UreR, five mutant UreR forms were generated with histidine to alanine substitutions. Two of the mutants (UreRc) exhibited a constitutive phenotype by both activating transcription and binding to DNA with an increased affinity in the absence of urea. The UreRc bound urea with an affinity similar to that of wild-type UreR. We concluded, therefore, that the mutations resulting in constitutive activity were not involved in the UreR·urea interaction. UreR was activated, then, either by binding urea or by histidine to alanine substitutions at one of two positions. Circular dichroism indicated little change in the structure of UreR when activated, and size-exclusion chromatography demonstrated that both rUreR and rUreRc were dimers in both the presence and absence of urea. Thus, the structural changes associated with activation are subtle.

Circular dichroism indicated little change in the structure of UreR when activated, and size-exclusion chromatography demonstrated that both rUreR and rUreRc were dimers in both the presence and absence of urea. Thus, the structural changes associated with activation are subtle. recombinant UreR constitutive UreR, UreR that acts in the absence of urea 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol maltose binding protein electrophoretic mobility shift assay helix-turn-helix Bacterial pathogens transcribe genes necessary to establish an infection, proliferate, and overcome host defense mechanisms in response to environmental signals. The most well studied environmental sensing mechanisms involve signal transduction pathways that originate at the bacterial cell envelope and activate cytoplasmic response regulators (1Parkinson J.S. Hoch J.A. Silhavy T.J. Two-component Signal Transduction. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995: 9-23Google Scholar). Environmental signals alerting the organisms of the appropriate host niche include temperature, osmolarity, pH, and metal ions (2Mekalanos J.J. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). For the majority of virulence-associated genes, however, the sensing and signaling mechanisms and exact in vivo stimuli are not known. Upon colonization of the urinary tract, uropathogenic bacteria express a specific armament of proteins. These proteins include attachment factors or pili, hemolysin, the iron scavenger aerobactin, and the enzyme urease (3Collins C.M. D'Orazio S.E.F. Mobley H.L.T. Warren J.W.

In the urinary tract urease is an important contributor to the virulence of the organism (6Collins C.M. Gutman D.M. Laman H. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 7Braude A.I. Siemienski J. J. Bacteriol. 1960; 80: 171-179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Griffith D.P. Musher D.M. Itin C. Invest. Urol. 1976; 13: 346-350PubMed Google Scholar). Urease catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea to ammonia and carbon dioxide, and the resulting ammonium elevates urine pH. This results in a more favorable environment for bacterial growth and leads to an increase in bacterial proliferation. In addition, the elevated urine pH facilitates formation of urinary stones, comprised of magnesium ammonium phosphate salts (struvite) (7Braude A.I. Siemienski J. J. Bacteriol. 1960; 80: 171-179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Griffith D.P. Musher D.M. Itin C. Invest. Urol. 1976; 13: 346-350PubMed Google Scholar). The struvite precipitates can be found in the renal pelvis, the bladder, and encrusted on urinary catheters. Stone formation can cause urinary obstruction and interfere with voiding, thereby making it more difficult to clear the infecting organism from the urinary tract (9Mobley H.L.T. Warren J.W.J. Clin. Microbiol. 1987; 25: 2216-2217Crossref Google Scholar, 10Lerner S.P. Gleeson M.J. Griffith D.P. J. Urol. 1989; 141: 753-758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Stones can also harbor the infecting bacteria in a protected site (11Fowler J.E.J. J. Urol. 1984; 131: 213-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In addition to stone formation, the basic urine damages the uroepithelium, inhibits the action of complement, and reduces the efficiency of certain antibiotics. Providencia stuartii is one of the most frequently isolated ureolytic uropathogens (12MacLaren D.M. Peerbooms P.G.H. Brumfit A.W. Microbial Diseases in Nephrology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1986: 183-195Google Scholar, 13Warren J.W. Mobley H.L.T. Warren J.W. Urinary Tract Infections: Molecular Pathogenesis and Clinical Management. American Society of Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 3-27Google Scholar). In P. stuartii, the urease genes are found on large plasmids ranging from 82 to 230 kb in size and are termed the plasmid-encoded urease gene cluster (14Mobley H.L. Chippendale G.R. Fraiman M.H. Tenney J.H. Warren J.W. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1985; 22: 851-853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Collins C.M. Falkow S. J.

Similar plasmids are found in ureolytic Escherichia coli andSalmonella species. Seven tandem genes in this plasmid-encoded urease cluster code for urease subunits (ureABC) and accessory polypeptides (ureDEFG), which are needed to form the nickel metallocenter found in the active enzyme (17Lee M.H. Mulrooney S.B. Renner M.J. Markowicz Y. Hausinger R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4324-4330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18D'Orazio S.E.F. Collins C.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3459-3467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An eighth gene, termed ureR, is found 414 bp upstream and divergently transcribed from the ureDABCEFGcluster (19D'Orazio S.E.F. Collins C.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The ureR gene product, UreR (34.1 kDa), is a member of the AraC family of transcriptional activators and is required for transcription at ureDp, ureGp, andureRp (19D'Orazio S.E.F. Collins C.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 20D'Orazio S.E.F. Thomas V. Collins C.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 643-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition to UreR, transcription from each of these promoters is dependent upon the presence of urea. Previous studies indicate UreR binds upstream of ureRp and ureDp, and the affinity of UreR for the DNA-binding sites increases significantly in the presence of urea (21Thomas V.J. Collins C.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1417-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It is evident that UreR can take on one of two conformations, binding DNA with either high or low affinity. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for UreR activation have not been determined. In the urinary tract, urea is found at concentrations of up to 500 mm, and this concentration is at least 50-fold higher than urea concentrations found at other sites in the body. Urea is able to freely diffuse into P. stuartii and other enteric bacteria. Thus, in this system, urea is acting not only as an effector molecule but also as the environmental signal, alerting P. stuartii that it has entered the appropriate site to initiate infection. In fact, the urea·UreR interaction is one of the first signals to the uropathogen that it has entered a urinary tract. Studies reported here are aimed to better understand this signaling mechanism by characterizing the transcriptionally active UreR. Chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and Invitrogen, unless otherwise specified. Restriction enzymes and enzyme buffers were obtained from New England BioLabs, and custom synthesized oligonucleotides were purchased from the Great American Gene Company and Ransom Hill Bioscience, Inc. RNA polymerase was obtained fromAmersham Biosciences, and [32P]dCTP (3000 mCi/mmol and 10 mCi/ml) was purchased from ICN Pharmaceuticals. Bacterial strains used are listed in TableI. Bacteria were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth with aeration at 37 °C or on LB broth solidified with 1.5% agar.

Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar). Specifically, two partial ureR products were amplified from the urease encoding pSEF70 (20D'Orazio S.E.F. Thomas V. Collins C.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 643-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) with 20-bp oligonucleotides containing the desired mutation. The amplified products were purified and used as template for a second PCR amplification with external flanking primers to yield a full-length, mutated ureR-encoding fragment. The complete double-stranded DNA sequence of each resultant UreR-encoding fragment was determined to ensure that only the single desired mutation was present. Two plasmid constructs were generated for each ureR mutant. For in vivo studies, ureR and mutantureR DNA fragments were amplified such that they contained terminal HindIII and BamHI endonuclease recognition sites. The native ureRp was not present on these fragments. The ureR-encoding fragments were inserted in the low copy number pRK415 downstream of the lactose operon promoterlacZp, which controlled transcription of ureR and mutants. For in vitro studies, the ureR-encoding fragments were generated to contain terminal NdeI andBamHI restriction endonuclease recognition sites, to allow insertion into, and expression from, pET15b (Novagen). The complete list of recombinant plasmids used is presented in Table I. To determine the transcriptional activity of the mutant UreR, UreR-encoding pRK415 derivatives were transformed into Escherichia coli containing a single chromosomal copy of ureRp-lacZ (SF07-1) or containing a single chromosomal copy ofureDp-lacZ (SF15). Cultures were grown with aeration at 37 °C overnight in LB supplemented with tetracycline. Stationary phase cultures were diluted in 1× Christensen broth (0.1% peptone, 0.5% NaCl, 0.1% glucose, 0.2% KH2PO4, 10 mm MgCl2, and 10 nm NiCl2) supplemented with 1% urea when indicated. Cells were grown to mid-logarithmic phase and assayed for β-galactosidase activity as previously described (23Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Each sample was assayed in triplicate, a minimum of three independent times. Western blots were preformed by standard protocols. Cell cultures used for β-galactosidase activity determination were centrifuged, and cell pellets were resuspended at equal cell densities in 20 μl of water. An equal volume of 2× denaturing protein buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol) was added, and samples were boiled for 5 min, loaded onto 12% SDS-PAGE, and resolved at 120 V overnight. Proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane using Trans-Blot electrophoretic transfer cell (Bio-Rad). Western blotting was performed according to the ECL Western blotting analysis system protocol (Amersham Biosciences) using a 1:3000 dilution of polyclonal rabbit anti-UreR antibody and 1:5000 dilution of peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit antibody. The Novagen E. coliexpression system was used to generate recombinant UreR (rUreR).1 UreR-encoding sequences were inserted in-frame into pET15b, an expression plasmid that codes for an N-terminal leader peptide containing six histidine residues and a thrombin cleavage site. Expression from the plasmid and initial purification were as described by the manufacturer. E. coli BL21(DE3) containing wild-type and mutant ureRwere grown to mid-exponential phase in LB broth supplemented with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and lysed by passage through a French pressure cell. rUreR was separated from the cell lysate by affinity chromatography over the His-Bind affinity resin (Novagen). rUreR was eluted from the column with an imidazole gradient, and rUreR containing fractions were collected and dialyzed into a buffer of 50 mm Bis-Tris, pH 6.5, 100 mm EDTA, 300 mm NaCl, and 15% glycerol. A MBP-UreR fusion proteins was also purified. Wild-type UreR-encoding sequence was inserted in-frame into pMAL-c2E (New England BioLabs) expression plasmid, thereby generating a translational MBP-UreR fusion. Protein expression and purification were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. E. coli DH5α (pIG1.11) were grown in LB supplemented with glucose and 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and cells were pelleted and lysed as above. MBP-UreR was purified by affinity chromatography over Amylose resin (New England BioLabs) and eluted with buffer containing 10 mm maltose, 20 mmTris-HCl, 200 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. Fraction purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Total protein concentration was determined using the BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce) or Bradford protein assay. rUreR refers to the wild-type protein with an N-terminal histidine tag, and MBP-UreR refers to the N-terminal maltose binding protein fusion. Proteins were kept at 4 °C for immediate use and kept at −20 °C for long term storage. Plasmid DNA (30–50 μg) was linearized with either SpeI (pIG0.2, forureDp fragment) or XhoI (pVJT9, containing a 147-bp intergenic region) and radiolabeled by incubating with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (1.5 μl of 5 units/ml)(New England BioLabs), 2 mm cold NTPs (G, A, T), and 5 μl of [32P]dCTP (10 mCi/ml) in a final volume of 50 μl at 37 °C for 30 min. Enzymes were inactivated at 75–90 °C for 10 min. Fragments were released by digestion with either EcoRI (pIG0.1 and pIG0.2) or HindIII (pVJT9) and were separated on 4% native polyacrylamide gel (38:2 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) in TBE buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm boric acid, 5 mm EDTA) for 3–4 h at 120 V. Labeled fragments were localized by brief exposure to radiographic film, excised from the gel, and eluted overnight at 37 °C in two volumes of elution buffer (0.5m ammonium acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS). Eluted DNA was precipitated in two volumes of 95% ethanol and resuspended in 50 ml of 0.1× TE buffer (1 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). Typically, 5–10 ng of DNA was recovered, ranging from 1,000 to 50,000 cpm. Radiolabeled DNA (2000–5000 cpm or 0.5–1 ng) was incubated with varying concentration of rUreR in 25 μl of 10 mm Tris HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 90 mm KCl, 0.125 mmdithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, 12.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 12.5% glycerol, and 150–200 ng of poly(dI-dC) (Fluka BioChemika) for 30 min at room temperature. When indicated, 50 mm urea was present. Reactions were then loaded onto 5% native polyacrylamide gel and resolved in Tris-glycine buffer (50 mm Tris, 100 mm glycine, and 2 mm EDTA) for 3 h at 150 V. Gel was vacuum-dried and exposed to radiographic film overnight at −70 °C. rUreR (28 nm final concentration) was incubated with radiolabeled 88-bp ureDp fragment (1.6 nm, from pIG0.2) in the presence or absence of 50 mm urea for 30 min at room temperature, using the conditions described for EMSA. Total reaction volume was adjusted to accommodate the desired number of time points. All samples were loaded onto 5% native acrylamide gel under current to minimize rUreR·DNA dissociation in the well. Sample (25 μl) was loaded at the zero time point. Then 100-fold molar excess of plasmid containing both ureRp andureDp (pVJT9, 220 mm) was added to the reaction mixture, and samples were loaded onto the gel at 15-, 30-, and 60-s intervals. For calculations, 90 s were added to each time point to correct for the time required for the sample to migrate into the gel (24Hendrickson W. Schleif R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 178: 611-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Gel was analyzed as described for EMSA. Percentage of label remaining in the complex was determined by densitometry. The fraction of the DNA remaining in the complex was termed F. In a plot, where natural log of F was plotted as a function of time, the slope is equal to −k −1, wherek −1 is the dissociation rate constant (25Revzin A. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 346-355PubMed Google Scholar). The intrinsic fluorescence of rUreR, rUreRc, and MBP-UreR was measured using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS 50 luminescence spectrophotometer. Protein (5–20 mm) was excited at 280 nm, and emission from 310 to 400 nm was recorded. Each sample was scanned 8 to 10 times, and the emission signal was summed and averaged. Near and far CD spectra of UreR and mutants were measured with a JASCO J-710/720 spectropolarimeter. Each sample was scanned 40 times at a speed of 50 nm/min, and the signals were summed and averaged. Near UV spectra (240–320 nm) were determined using a cell path length of 1.0 cm, and far UV spectra (200–320 nm) were determined using a path length of 0.1 cm. Protein samples used were 0.5 mg/ml for near UV and 0.25 mg/ml for far UV spectra. The relative molecular weights of rUreR and rUreRc were predicted by size-exclusion chromatography using a Sephadex G-75 column with buffers either with or without 50 mm urea. Size standards were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. The presence of protein was determined by reading absorbance of the fractions at 280 nm. In the presence of urea, UreR obtains a transcriptionally active conformation with a high DNA binding affinity, whereas in the absence of urea, it is not an efficient activator of transcription and has a lower DNA binding affinity (21Thomas V.J. Collins C.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1417-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Because the urea·UreR interaction is critical for urease gene activation, we asked whether there is a specific urea-binding site on UreR necessary for a low to high DNA affinity conformational change. This binding site would differ from the relatively nonspecific binding responsible for urea denaturation of proteins. The UreR·urea interaction was assessed by measuring alterations in the intrinsic fluorescence of the protein as the consequence of ligand (urea) binding. UreR contains a number of fluorescent aromatic amino acids, including a single tryptophan residue at position 185 (Trp-185). Recombinant UreR (rUreR, UreR with an N-terminal 6-histidine tag attached, see “Experimental Procedures”) was excited at 280 nm, a wavelength that excites tryptophans, and to a lesser extent tyrosines, and the emission spectrum from 310 to 400 nm was recorded (Fig. 1 A). This spectrum peaked at 338.5 nm. In the presence of urea, the relative fluorescence of the sample decreased as a function of the urea concentration, while the emission peak remained at 338.5 nm. The fractional change of the decrease in fluorescence as a function of urea concentration is shown in Fig. 1 B. The shape of the plot indicates that the observed quenching was due to urea binding UreR at a single site. Total fluorescence for each peak was summed, and the change in the mean of this total fluorescence was analyzed using a curve-fitting algorithm (SigmaPlot). From this algorithm, a dissociation constant (K d) of the interaction was determined to be 0.23 mm (TableII).Table IIAffinity of wild-type and mutant rUreR for ureaProteinK dmmrUreR0.23 ± 0.04rUreR-H102A0.26 ± 0.06rUreR-H175A0.16 ± 0.03rUreR-22.00.20 ± 0.04Affinities were determined by the fluorescence quenching assay described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Affinities were determined by the fluorescence quenching assay described under “Experimental Procedures.” In an initial attempt to map the urea-binding site on UreR, an N-terminal 22-kDa truncate of the proteins was generated. Similar to other members of the AraC family, UreR contains two C-terminal helix-turn-helix (HTH) motifs that presumably mediate binding to DNA. rUreR22.0 is the N-terminal 22.0 kDa of the protein that lacks the second half of the predicted N-terminal HTH, the second C-terminal HTH, and the remainder of the protein. rUreR22.0 contains Trp-185, the chromophore likely responsible for the fluorescence change observed. The affinity of this truncate for urea was essentially identical to that of wild-type full-length rUreR (Table II). Therefore, the N-terminal 22 kDa of UreR contains a functional urea-binding site. Both rUreR and rUreR22.0 contain N-terminal histidine tag sequences. Because we postulate that histidines might be involved in urea binding to UreR (see below), it was necessary to determine that the protein, and not the histidine tag, was responsible for the observed high affinity urea binding. To do this a maltose binding protein UreR fusion protein was generated. A decrease in fluorescence was observed when urea was added to the MBP-UreR fusion, in a similar fashion as observed with rUreR (not shown). An approximate 0.5 mm K d value was predicted, indicating that the urea binding observed is not due to the recombinant N-terminal histidine tag sequence. To determine the conformational changes associated with urea binding and subsequent high DNA binding affinity, circular dichroism spectra of rUreR in the presence and absence of urea were obtained. Both far- and near-ultraviolet spectra for wild-type rUreR demonstrated little change when urea was added (Fig. 2). The far-ultraviolet spectra predicted the secondary structure of the protein as 56% α-helix, 10% β sheet, and 33% random coil (TableIII). There was no significant difference in these percentages when the spectra were obtained in the presence of urea. Thus, as determined by CD, there was not a detectable conformational change occurring upon binding urea. This suggests that the structural differences between activated and urea-free rUreR are subtle.Table IIIEstimates of percent α-helix in UreR and UreRcProteinα-Helixβ-SheetRandom coil%rUreR561033rUreR-H102A391760rUreR-H175A452331Estimates were determined from CD spectra as described. Open table in a new tab Estimates were determined from CD spectra as described. Mutant UreR forms were generated to identify amino acids comprising the urea-binding site. The urea-binding site on the enzyme urease is composed of four histidines, one arginine, and one lysine residue. To test the possibility that UreR contains a similar urea-binding site, UreR with alanine residues substituted at positions that normally contain histidine residues were produced. UreR has seven histidine residues found at positions 73, 102, 107, 175, 186, 205, and 240 (Fig. 3). These residues are conserved in the primary amino acid sequence of P. mirabilis UreR (27Nicholson E.B. Concaugh E.A. Foxall P.A. Island M.D. Mobley H.L. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 465-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), which is functionally interchangeable with the P. stuartii UreR (20D'Orazio S.E.F. Thomas V. Collins C.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 643-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). By site-directed mutagenesis, theureR codons for His-73, His-102, His-107, His-175, and His-240 were changed to code for alanines. His-186 and His-205 are found in the predicted N-terminal helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif and thus were not mutated. Two constructs of each mutant ureR were generated. To determine the transcriptional activity of each mutant form, the altered ureR were inserted downstream of the lactose operon promoter, lacZp, on the low copy number plasmid pRK415. For in vitro studies, each mutated gene was inserted into the pET15b expression plasmid, and the mutated rUreR were expressed and purified as described. There are four possible phenotypes for the mutant proteins: 1) mutant UreR could appear wild-type and dependent on urea for activity, 2) mutant protein might have little or no activity, due to loss of a critical urea binding residue, 3) the protein could be inactive due to loss of a DNA binding residue or a residue integral to overall stability and tertiary structure, or 4) the mutant UreR could be active independent of urea. The mutated UreR were tested for their ability to activate transcription at the ureD andureR promoters (ureDp and ureRp). Mutant constructs in pRK415 were placed in trans to a single copy chromosomal ureDp-lacZ andureRp-lacZ transcriptional fusions (Fig.4) (19D'Orazio S.E.F. Collins C.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and the activity of each mutant was determined by assaying for β-galactosidase (Fig.5). UreR-His73Ala and UreR-His107Ala exhibited similar activity to that of wild-type UreR. There was no β-galactosidase detected in either the presence or absence of urea with UreR-His240Ala. UreR-His102Ala and UreR-His175Ala exhibited activity similar to that of wild-type UreR in the presence of urea, but were almost as acti"
https://openalex.org/W1511635820,"Transcription from the B-myb(MybL2 gene) promoter is strictly cell cycle-regulated by repression mediated through an E2F site during G0/early G1. We report here the characterization of a corepressor site (downstream repression site (DRS)) required for this activity that is closely linked to the E2F site. Systematic mutagenesis of the DRS enabled a consensus to be derived, and it is notable that this sequence is compatible with cell cycle gene homology region sequences associated with cell cycle-dependent elements in the cyclin A,cdc2, and CDC25C promoters. The B-myb promoter is inappropriately active during G0 in mouse embryo fibroblasts lacking the p107 and p130 pocket proteins, and we show that the ability of transfected p107 and p130 to re-impose repression on the promoter is dependent on the DRS. In contrast, transfected Rb was unable to repress the B-myb promoter. Consistent with the notion that Rb·E2F complexes are unable to bind the B-myb promoter E2F site in vivo, footprinting showed that this site is unoccupied in cells lacking p107 and p130. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed a requirement for the DRS in recruiting p107 and p130 complexes to the B-myb promoter, indicating that in vivo the DRS governs the occupancy of the adjacent E2F site by transcriptional repressors. Transcription from the B-myb(MybL2 gene) promoter is strictly cell cycle-regulated by repression mediated through an E2F site during G0/early G1. We report here the characterization of a corepressor site (downstream repression site (DRS)) required for this activity that is closely linked to the E2F site. Systematic mutagenesis of the DRS enabled a consensus to be derived, and it is notable that this sequence is compatible with cell cycle gene homology region sequences associated with cell cycle-dependent elements in the cyclin A,cdc2, and CDC25C promoters. The B-myb promoter is inappropriately active during G0 in mouse embryo fibroblasts lacking the p107 and p130 pocket proteins, and we show that the ability of transfected p107 and p130 to re-impose repression on the promoter is dependent on the DRS. In contrast, transfected Rb was unable to repress the B-myb promoter. Consistent with the notion that Rb·E2F complexes are unable to bind the B-myb promoter E2F site in vivo, footprinting showed that this site is unoccupied in cells lacking p107 and p130. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed a requirement for the DRS in recruiting p107 and p130 complexes to the B-myb promoter, indicating that in vivo the DRS governs the occupancy of the adjacent E2F site by transcriptional repressors. mouse embryo fibroblasts downstream repression site cell cycle-dependent element cell cycle gene homology region mutant E2F site mutant downstream repression site chromatin immunoprecipitation non-phosphorylatable Rb electrophoretic mobility shift assays It has become well established that E2F transcription factor activity, through its interactions with the retinoblastoma family of pocket proteins, plays a major role in coordinating gene transcription during the mammalian cell cycle. E2F activity is a heterogeneous entity made up of heterodimers from two distantly related protein families, E2F and DP (1Girling R. Partridge J.F. Bandara L.R. Burden N. Totty N.F. Hsuan J.J. La Thangue N.B. Nature. 1993; 362: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 2Helin K., Wu, C.-L. Fattaey A.R. Lees J.A. Dynlacht B.D. Ngwu C. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1850-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Each component of the E2F protein family, E2F-1 through E2F-6, appears to be functional in association with either member of the related DP protein family, DP-1 and DP-2 (3Wu C.-L. Zukerberg L.R. Ngwu C. Harlow E. Lees J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2536-2546Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). E2F-1, E2F-2, and E2F-3 heterodimers form complexes preferentially with the retinoblastoma protein Rb, whereas the related pocket proteins p107 and p130 associate preferentially with E2F-4 and E2F-5. This demarcation is not absolute, however; and it has been reported that Rb·E2F-4 complexes are the predominant species in the nuclei of actively dividing cells during G1 (4Verona R. Moberg K. Estes S. Starz M. Vernon J.P. Lees J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7268-7282Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). E2F-6 lacks the C-terminal domain that, in the other species, has been implicated in transactivation function and interaction with the pocket proteins (5Morkel M. Wenkel J. Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Hagemeier C. Nature. 1997; 390: 567-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 6Cartwright P. Muller H. Wagener C. Holm K. Helin K.

The diversity present within the E2F and pocket protein families suggests that different E2F complexes may play distinct roles in cell cycle regulation of gene transcription. In support of this notion, it was found that “knockouts” of specific pocket protein genes by homologous recombination have quite different effects on mouse embryonic development. Whereas Rb−/− mice die in utero with defects in the liver, central nervous system, and ocular lens and a profound reduction in definitive erythropoiesis (9Jacks T. Fazeli A. Scmidtt E.M. Bronson R.T. Goodell M.A. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar), p107−/− and p130−/− mice develop normally (10Cobrinik D. Lee M.-H. Hannon G. Mulligan G. Bronson R.T. Dyson N. Harlow E. Beach D. Weinberg R.A. Jacks T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1633-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Inactivation of both p130 and p107 results, however, in neonatal lethality, with defects in bone and cartilage arising from hyperproliferation of chondrocytes (10Cobrinik D. Lee M.-H. Hannon G. Mulligan G. Bronson R.T. Dyson N. Harlow E. Beach D. Weinberg R.A. Jacks T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1633-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Differences in pocket protein function are also manifest at the level of cell cycle-regulated transcription in mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs)1 derived from mutant animals (11Hurford R.K. Cobrinik D. Lee M.-H. Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1447-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Whereas elimination of either p107 or p130 had no discernible effect on cell cycle-regulated transcription, knockout of both p107 and p130 genes resulted in deregulated expression of a set of genes (B-myb, cdc2, E2F-1, thymidylate synthase,RRM2, and cyclin A2) distinct from those deregulated in Rb−/− MEFs (cyclin E and p107). These phenotypic differences between Rb−/− and p107−/−/p130−/− MEFs are unlikely to be due to gene dosage effects, as studies with established knockout fibroblasts showed that deregulation of the B-myb promoter in p107−/−/p130−/− cells could not be recapitulated in either p107−/−/Rb−/− or p130−/−/Rb−/− cells (12Classon M. Salama S. Gorka C. Mulloy R. Braun P. Harlow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10820-10825Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It is therefore evident that p107 and p130 have a functionally redundant role in E2F-mediated gene regulation, which is distinct from that of Rb. It is currently unclear how different pocket protein·E2F complexes discriminate between the genes they regulate. One possibility is that they demonstrate some sequence specificity for the E2F binding site in the promoters of these genes. Although most in vitro binding studies have failed to show this, repetitive selection of redundant binding sites by the CASTing procedure (13Tao Y. Kassatly R.F. Cress W.D. Horowitz J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6994-7007Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) suggests that different E2F complexes do have inherent preferences for particular E2F sites. An additional possibility is that occupation of the E2F site in vivo is influenced by factors binding to adjacent sites or that the ability of E2F complexes to regulate transcription, whether by repression or activation, is dependent upon interactions with these accessory factors. The contribution of a putative accessory binding site to E2F-dependent transcription is exemplified by B-myb (the MybL2 gene), in which it was found that cell cycle regulation is influenced by a distinct promoter site located immediately downstream of the E2F site (17Liu N. Lucibello F. Engeland K. Müller R. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2957-2963Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 32Bennett J.D. Farlie P.G. Watson R.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1073-1082PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations in either the E2F site or the adjacent site (downstream repression site (DRS)) abolish transcriptional repression in G0/G1. Significantly, in vivofootprinting studies revealed that the B-myb promoter E2F site is occupied in quiescent cells, but becomes unoccupied in mid G1 preceding the induction of B-mybtranscription (14Zwicker J. Liu N. Engeland K. Lucibello F.C. Müller R. Science. 1996; 271: 1595-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). As E2F abundance actually increases at the G1/S boundary, it is possible that the role of the DRS is to stabilize interactions of repressor complexes at the adjacent E2F site specifically in G0/early G1. Transcriptional repression is a common mechanism to extinguish expression of periodically regulated genes during cell cycle arrest and quiescence (15–28); however, there is evidence that the regulation of certain of these genes is not directly dependent on E2F. Most notably, transcriptional repression of CDC25C in G0/early G1 involves bipartite elements termed CDE/CHR (23Lucibello F.C. Truss M. Zwicker J. Ehlert F. Beato M. Müller R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 132-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 29Liu N. Lucibello F.C. Körner K. Wolfraim L.A. Zwicker J. Müller R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4915-4920Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). TheCDC25C CDE/CHR elements are partially homologous to the B-myb E2F/DRS sites and, moreover, have an identical spatial relationship (30Lucibello F.C. Liu N. Zwicker J. Gross C. Müller R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4921-4925Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar); however, E2F binds weakly if at all to CDE/CHR. Compared with E2F/DRS, the CDE/CHR elements confer a subtly different cell cycle kinetics on promoters: both sets of elements permit derepression of transcription in the latter part of G1; however, induction is somewhat prolonged through S/G2 when regulated by CDE/CHR(30). To gain further understanding of the relationship between the downstream DRS and CDE elements, we have extensively characterized the B-myb DRS by mutagenesis. We have also studied the role played by B-myb E2F/DRS sites in transcriptional regulation in vivo and conclude that the DRS facilitates interaction of repressive p107·E2F and p130·E2F complexes with the adjacent E2F site. MEFs from control p107+/− and gene knockout p107−/−/p130−/− animals were kindly provided by Dr. Nick Dyson (Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Charlestown, MA) and were expanded and used at passage 4. MEFs and Swiss 3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Established 3T3 cell lines were derived from MEFs by splitting cultures every 3 days according to standard procedures. These established 3T3 and NIH 3T3 cells (obtained from Dr. René Bernards) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum. Flow cytometry was performed on ethanol-fixed cells stained with propidium iodide as described previously (22Le Cam L. Polanowska J. Fabrizzio E. Olivier M. Philips A., Ng Eaton E. Classon M. Geng Y. Sardet C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1878-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The mouse B-mybpromoter/reporter cassette was made using PCR with Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) to introduce AatII andBclI sites 5′ and 3′, respectively, of the B-mybpromoter E2F/DRS sites in the pGL2-(−536) luciferase reporter (15Lam E.W.-F. Watson R.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2705-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides containing 5′-AatII and 3′-BclI ends were then inserted using T4 DNA ligase to replace the wild-type sequence with variant transcriptional control sites. The sequences of these oligonucleotides (sense strand only) were as follows: mE2F,CCTTGTATGGAGATAGGAAAGT; mDRS,CCTTGGCGGGAGATAGGCCTGT; CDE/CHR,CGCTGGCGGAAGGTTTGAATGT; E2F/CHR,CCTTGGCGGGAGATTTGAATGT; CDE/DRS,CGCTGGCGGAAGGTAGGAAAGT; E2F/DRS+2,CCTTGGCGGGAGATATAGGAAAGT; and E2F/DRS+4,CCTTGGCGGGAGATATATAGGAAAGT). Additional mutations in the DRS were introduced as indicated in Fig.1 B. To insert wild-type, mE2F, and mDRS B-myb promoter sequences into the pAG/EluW luciferase reporter, which contains flanking scaffold/matrix attachment regions from the human interferon-β gene to attenuate positional effects in chromosomally integrated plasmids (31Klehr D. Maass K. Bode J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1264-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), fragments with terminal HindIII sites were generated by PCR with Pfu DNA polymerase using pGL2-(−536), pGL2-(−536)mut1, and pGL2-(−536)mut9 as templates (32Bennett J.D. Farlie P.G. Watson R.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1073-1082PubMed Google Scholar). The primers used (5′-AGCTAAGCTTCCAGTCTTTGCTATGTGTGTG and 3′-ACGTAAGCTTCGAGCCGCTCCGGGCCCCAGG) amplified promoter sequences from −533 to −88 with respect to the start of the protein coding sequence, and these HindIII fragments replaced the SV40 promoter in pAG/EluW. Plasmids were transfected into NIH 3T3 cells using calcium phosphate coprecipitation, and stable transfectants were selected with 0.5 μg/ml G418 using the conditions described to limit copy number (31Klehr D. Maass K. Bode J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1264-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Clones carrying approximately five copies of each transgene were selected for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis. An expression plasmid encoding untagged p107, pCMVp107, was kindly provided by Dr. Liang Zhu. pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) expression plasmids encoding Myc epitope-tagged wild-type Rb and non-phosphorylatable Rb (RbNP; in which 14 of 15 cyclin-dependent kinase sites were mutated to alanine) were kindly provided by Dr. Sybille Mittnacht (33Chew Y.P. Ellis M. Wilkie S. Mittnacht S. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2177-2186Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Expression vectors encoding Myc epitope-tagged p107 and p130 proteins were constructed by fusing p107 and p130 coding sequences lacking the initiating methionine codon, generated by a combination of PCR and restriction endonuclease digestion, downstream of the Myc epitope coding sequence in pcDNA3(9E10). A combination of PCR and restriction endonuclease digestion was also used to generate coding sequences specifying fragments of p130. These were cloned downstream of the Myc epitope coding sequence in pcDNA3(9E10): mutant N417 (amino acids 417–1139) contains the A and B pockets, the spacer region, and the entire C-terminal domain; mutant C793 (amino acids 2–793) is C-terminally truncated within the spacer; mutant C1065 (amino acids 2–1065) is C-terminally truncated immediately after the B pocket; and mutant dl622–818 contains a deletion of most of the spacer. PCR-generated sequences were checked by DNA sequencing. MEFs and 3T3 derivatives were transfected according to the manufacturer's instruction in 60-mm Petri dishes (105 cells) using 20 μl of LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) and 4 μg of DNA (3 μg of luciferase reporter + 1 μg of β-galactosidase plasmid). After 5 h, the LipofectAMINE was removed, and cells were allowed to recover in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum overnight before replacing the medium with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% fetal calf serum. Cell lysates were made 60 h later, and luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed as described (15Lam E.W.-F. Watson R.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2705-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Where cell extracts were prepared from transfected 3T3 derivatives, cells were transfected in 100-mm dishes using 60 μl of LipofectAMINE and a total of 12 μg of DNA. RNA was prepared from p107+/− and p107−/−/p130−/−3T3 cells using RNAzol B (Biogenesis) as described by the manufacturer and resolved on 1% agarose gels containing 2.2 mformaldehyde. Northern blots were probed with a 32P-labeled murine B-myb cDNA probe. Western blotting was performed under standard conditions using anti-c-Myc antibody 9E10 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-40) to detect the tagged pocket proteins. Nuclear and cytoplasmic protein fractions were prepared from MEFs and transfected 3T3 cell lines after lysing in a hypotonic buffer containing 0.4% Nonidet P-40 essentially as described (34Moberg K. Starz M.A. Lees J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1436-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Equivalent amounts of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions (∼10 μg) were used in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) using an oligonucleotide probe encompassing the mouse B-myb promoter E2F/DRS sites as described previously (15Lam E.W.-F. Watson R.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2705-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Where appropriate, antibodies to p107 (monoclonal antibody SD15; a gift of Dr. Nick Dyson), E2F-4 (polyclonal; a gift of Dr. Eric W.-F. Lam), p130 (polyclonal; a gift of Dr. Antonio Giordano), Rb (monoclonal antibody 21C9; a gift of Dr. Sybille Mittnacht), or c-Myc (monoclonal antibody 9E10) were added to supershift specific complexes. Whole cell extracts were prepared from NIH 3T3 cells stably transfected with the wild-type or mDRS B-myb promoter as described previously (15Lam E.W.-F. Watson R.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2705-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). These were used in EMSAs as described above; however, the antibodies used in supershifts were the same as those used in ChIP assays (rabbit anti-p107 polyclonal antibody, Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-318; rabbit anti-p130 polyclonal antibody, Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-317; and anti-Rb monoclonal antibody 21C9). Footprints were obtained by linker-mediated PCR on DNA alkylated in vivo by addition of 0.2% dimethyl sulfate to cell cultures as described previously (22Le Cam L. Polanowska J. Fabrizzio E. Olivier M. Philips A., Ng Eaton E. Classon M. Geng Y. Sardet C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1878-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The B-myb primers used were as published (14Zwicker J. Liu N. Engeland K. Lucibello F.C. Müller R. Science. 1996; 271: 1595-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). ChIP assays were performed using essentially the published method (35Weinmann A.S. Bartley S.M. Zhang T. Zhang M.Q. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6820-6832Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Sonicated chromatin from 107 cells treated in vivo with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at ambient temperature was immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of each antibody (control (normal rabbit serum), rabbit anti-p107 polyclonal, and rabbit anti-p130 polyclonal antibodies and anti-Rb monoclonal antibody 21C9) and collected by mixing for 1 h at 4 °C with 45 μl of protein A-Sepharose 4B beads (50% suspension in TE buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1) and 1 mm EDTA) preadsorbed with sonicated salmon sperm DNA (10 μg/ml). Rabbit anti-mouse IgG (2 μg; Sigma M7023) was added to monoclonal immunoprecipitations for 1 h before addition of protein A beads. The beads were collected by brief microcentrifugation, and the supernatant of the control antibody sample was retained for use as an input control. The beads were washed successively for 10 min at 4 °C with TSE buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 2 mmEDTA, and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1)); TSE buffer containing 150 mm NaCl; TSE buffer containing 500 mm NaCl; buffer containing 250 mm LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1); and TE buffer. Immunoprecipitated DNA was eluted by washing the beads three times with 150 μl of 1% SDS and 100 mmNaHCO3, and then 10 μg of salmon sperm DNA was added to the pooled eluates. The cross-links were reversed by heating at 65 °C for 4 h, and then the DNA was phenol-extracted twice and ethanol-precipitated. DNA was recovered by centrifugation and dissolved in 350 μl of buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), and 1 mm EDTA. After reprecipitation with ethanol, the final pellet was dissolved in 30 μl of TE buffer. PCR amplification was carried out for 25 or 26 cycles on 2-μl amounts using Taq polymerase. Separate reactions were carried out to detect the transgene and the endogenous B-mybgene; transgene reactions used a 5′-B-myb primer (CCTTCCGTATGCTCCGCCC) and a 3′-primer to the luciferase gene (TCATAGCCTTATGCAGTTGCTCTCC), whereas endogenous reactions used 5′- and 3′-B-myb primers (ATTGAATCCCTAAGGTAGGTGTATCTG and TGGTCGCACGTTCCCAG, respectively). PCR products were resolved on 1.5% agarose gels, Southern-blotted, and detected by hybridization with a 5′-32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe (TTCTGTGCGCTCCCTAGGCAGCTGCAGTTCCTGGGAACG). Hybridization was quantitated by phosphorimaging. To characterize the precise sequence requirement for transcriptional repression of the B-myb promoter, each nucleotide within the previously delimited DRS motif (GGAAA, nucleotides −198 to −194 relative to the start of the coding sequence) was mutated individually to each of the three alternatives. To facilitate this, AatII and BclI restriction sites were first introduced into the B-myb promoter at sequences immediately flanking the E2F/DRS elements by substituting 2 and 3 nucleotides, respectively (Fig.1 A). Previous studies have shown that the regions mutated do not influence cell cycle-regulated transcription (32Bennett J.D. Farlie P.G. Watson R.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1073-1082PubMed Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotides containing DRS mutations could then be quickly transferred into the modified reporter plasmid, the so-called B-myb promoter cassette, by direct ligation (see “Experimental Procedures”). The functions of the wild-type and mutant DRS elements were then assayed in transient transfection assays of NIH 3T3 cells. Following transfection, the cells were arrested in G0 by serum deprivation, and cell extracts were made from these cells and from duplicates that were induced to enter S phase by serum stimulation for 16 h. The results of a typical experiment (Fig. 1 B) show that the central 3 nucleotides in the DRS (GGAAA, nucleotides −197 to −195) are particularly critical for E2F-mediated transcriptional repression. Thus, mutation of either A residue to any other nucleotide resulted in a significant increase in promoter activity in both G0 and S phase cells. Mutation of the central G residue to A had no effect upon promoter activity, whereas either C or T at this position resulted in a very significant increase in promoter activity. It is pertinent that the equivalent DRS sequence in the human B-myb promoter is GAAAA, consistent with the evidence that either G or A at nucleotide −197 is permissive for repression function. In contrast, mutation of the first G residue of the DRS (nucleotide −198) had only a marginal effect on transcriptional derepression; mutation to A led to a slight loss of repression, whereas mutation to C actually resulted in a slight increase in repression. Mutation of the ultimate A residue (nucleotide −194) to C or T had little or no effect upon DRS function, whereas substitution by G led to a substantial loss of transcriptional repression (Fig. 1 B). Comparison of a DRS consensus sequence derived from this analysis with CHR sequences located downstream of the cyclin A2, cdc2, and CDC25C CDE sites (Fig.1 C) revealed that all three CHRs are actually compatible with the DRS sequence requirements. It is notable that promoters in which the critical GAA core of the DRS is mutated were substantially induced in S phase (Fig. 1 B), suggesting that the E2F site can mediate transcriptional activation in S phase when DRS function is compromised. To test this possibility, the activity of a promoter in which both sites have been mutated was compared with those of reporters containing single E2F or DRS mutations, and this assay confirmed that activation of the mDRS promoter was indeed abolished when the adjacent E2F site was also mutated (Fig. 2 A). As the mDRS promoter was significantly more active in S phase than the wild-type promoter, it appears that transactivating E2F complexes are able to bind to the B-myb E2F site only in the absence of the DRS. It may therefore be suggested that the DRS specifically prevents activating E2F species from binding to the adjacent E2F site while conversely facilitating binding of repressive E2F complexes. To determine whether the CDC25C CHR could indeed substitute for a functional B-myb DRS and, conversely, whether the B-myb DRS could substitute for the CDC25C CHR, the E2F/DRS sites in the B-myb promoter cassette were replaced with wild-type CDC25C CDE/CHR or hybrid E2F/CHR and CDE/DRS sites (Fig. 2 B). Transfection into NIH 3T3 cells showed that the CDC25C CDE/CHR conferred appropriate cell cycle regulation on the B-myb promoter in that the promoter was repressed in G0 cells and derepressed in S phase (Fig.2 B). Significantly, the hybrid E2F/CHR element conferred more rigorous regulation on the B-myb promoter than either E2F/DRS or CDE/CHR, whereas in contrast, substitution by the hybrid CDE/DRS element led to complete deregulation (Fig. 2 B). These findings indicate that the DRS and CHR are not absolutely equivalent. Whereas both elements are functional in the context of the E2F site, the CHR also has a specific function in the context of the CDE, which cannot be substituted by the DRS. To determine whether the relative positions of the B-mybE2F/DRS sites are important for their functional interaction, small iterations of 2 and 4 nucleotides were introduced between these sites in the reporter cassette, and transient transfections assays were performed as before. Displacing the DRS from the E2F site by 2 nucleotides resulted in significant transcriptional derepression in G0 (Fig. 2 C), and this effect was even more pronounced when the sites were displaced by 4 nucleotides. These results indicate that the spatial relationship between the E2F and DRS sites is essential for their cooperation. Repression of B-myb transcription is substantially deregulated in quiescent MEFs derived from embryos lacking both the p107 and p130 genes, although it is unaffected in MEFs lacking either of these pocket proteins alone or in MEFs lacking Rb (11Hurford R.K. Cobrinik D. Lee M.-H. Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1447-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). These data suggest that p107·E2F and p130·E2F complexes have a redundant function in repressing the B-myb promoter during G0, which cannot be compensated by Rb·E2F. Consistent with this notion, reintroduction of p107 and, to a lesser extent, p130 into p107−/−/p130−/− MEFs by transient transfection results in repression of a cotransfected B-mybpromoter (11Hurford R.K. Cobrinik D. Lee M.-H. Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1447-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), and this activity depends on an intact E2F site. The p107−/−/p130−/− cells therefore provide a convenient system in which to investigate further the interactions between pocket protein·E2F complexes and the bipartite E2F/DRS site. To determine first the contribution of the DRS in this system, we performed additional transient transfection experiments in p107−/−/p130−/− and control p107+/− MEFs. These studies confirmed that the wild-type B-myb promoter is significantly deregulated in quiescent p107−/−/p130−/− MEFs compared with control cells (Fig. 3 A). It is notable, however, that deregulation of the wild-type promoter was incomplete in the knockout cells compared with a mE2F site promoter, suggesting that quiescent p107−/−/p130−/−MEFs actually contain diminished rather than no E2F repressor activity. It is notable also that the DRS mutation had similar effects in both quiescent p107−/−/p130−/− and control MEFs, being somewhat derepressed compared with the wild-type promoter in control MEFs, but not further deregulated in p107−/−/p130−/− MEFs (Fig. 3 A). These findings suggest that residual E2F repressor activity in p107−/−/p130−/− MEFs is impervious to the influence of the DRS. As reported previously (11Hurford R.K. Cobrinik D. Lee M.-H. Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1447-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), we found that reintroducing p107 and p130 by transfection into quiescent p107−/−/p130−/− MEFs resulted in repression of the wild-type B-myb promoter (Fig. 3 B). Consistent with the previous study (11Hurford R.K. Cobrinik D. Lee M.-H. Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1447-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), we found that p107 repressed the wild-type B-myb promoter more strongly than p130, although this may simply reflect the relative expression levels of these proteins in these cells. Significantly, the ability of p107 and p130 to repress B-myb promoter activity was dependent upon both an intact E2F site and DRS (Fig. 3 B). Stimulation by p107 of both the mE2F site and mDRS promoters observed in this experiment presumably reflects an effect on constitutive activators binding to sites upstream of the cell cycle control elements. Overall, it is clear that the DRS is essential for the imposition of transcriptional repression mediated by p107·E2F complexes through the adjacent E2F site. Although it is clear from"

One compound, 4-deoxy-d-GlcNα1–6-d-myo-inositol-1-HPO4-sn-1,2-dipalmitoylglycerol, proved to be an inhibitor of both the trypanosomal and HeLa pathways, whereas 4-O-methyl-d-GlcNα1–6-d-myo-inositol-1-HPO4-sn-1,2-dipalmitoylglycerol and the 4′-epimer,d-GalN-α1–6-d-myo-inositol-1-HPO4-sn-1,2-dipalmitoylglycerol, were neither substrates nor inhibitors.

All of the various lipid analogues tested served as substrates in both the trypanosomal and HeLa cell-free systems, suggesting that a precise lipid structure and stereochemistry are not essential for substrate recognition. However, an analogue containing a single C18:0 alkyl chain in place ofsn-1,2-dipalmitoylglycerol proved to be a better substrate in the trypanosomal than in the HeLa cell-free system.

Protozoa tend to express significantly higher densities of cell-surface GPI-anchored proteins than do higher eukaryotes. For example,Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of African sleeping sickness, expresses a dense cell-surface coat consisting of ∼5 × 106 dimers of a GPI-anchored variant surface glycoprotein, whose principal purpose is to protect the parasite from the alternative complement pathway of the host and, through antigenic variation, from specific immune responses (6Cross G.A.M.

The lysate was sonicated briefly and added to dry GDP-[3H]Man (0.3 μCi/2.5 × 107 cell equivalents). After brief sonication, aliquots of 20 μl (2.5 × 107 cell equivalents) were added to reaction tubes containing an equal volume of the various GlcN-PI analogues in 10 mm n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside and incubated at 30 °C for 1 h.

After brief sonication, aliquots of 100 μl were added to reaction tubes containing the GlcN-PI analogues and incubated at 35 °C for 1.5 h. The glycolipid products were recovered and analyzed by HPTLC before and after enzymatic and chemical treatments. Inhibition studies were performed in exactly the same manner, except that the membranes were preincubated with candidate inhibitors for 5 min prior to being added to GlcN-PI or GlcNAc-PI. The HPTLC-purified radiolabeled glycolipids were delipidated, deaminated, reduced, dephosphorylated with aqueous hydrofluoric acid, and desalted by passage through AG50X12(H+) and AG3X4 (OH−) ion-exchange resins. The resulting neutral glycan headgroups were analyzed by Bio-Gel P4 gel filtration (21Güther M.L.S. Ferguson M.A.J.

Samples and glycolipid standards were applied to 10-cm aluminum-backed silica gel 60 HPTLC plates, which were developed using either solvent system A: chloroform/methanol/1 mNH4Ac/13 m NH4OH/water (180/140/9/9/23, v/v) or system B: chloroform/methanol/water (10/10/3, v/v). Radiolabeled components were detected by fluorography at −70 °C, after spraying with En3HanceTM, using Kodak XAR-5 film with an intensifying screen. Digestions with jack bean α-mannosidase (JBαM), glycosylphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase D (GPI-PLD) and phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) and base hydrolysis, deamination, andN-acetylation were performed as described previously (36Smith T.K.

The trypanosomal cell-free system was incubated withN-ethylmaleimide (NEM) to prevent the formation of endogenous GPI intermediates by inhibiting UDP-GlcNAc:PI α1–6 GlcNAc-transferase (49Milne K.G. Ferguson M.A.J. Masterson W.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, labeling with GDP-[3H]Man (Fig. 1 A, lane 1) leads only to the formation of endogenous dolichol-phosphate-[3H]mannose, allowing easy assessment of the effects of adding synthetic GlcN-PI analogues. The addition of synthetic GlcN-PI or GlcNAc-PI primed the production of GPI intermediates up to and including EtN-P-Man3GlcN-PI (glycolipid A′) (Fig.1 A, lanes 2 and 3), as described previously (46Smith T.K. Cottaz S. Brimacombe J.S. Ferguson M.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6476-6482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Various novel GlcN-PI and GlcNAc-PI analogues were tested as substrates (Fig. 1, A and B). The following analogues failed to stimulate the formation of3H-labeled mannosylated glycolipids and are therefore not substrates for MT-1 and/or the GlcNAc-PI de-N-acetylase: Glc-PI, 2-dGlc-PI, 3-dGlcN(Ac)-PI, 4-dGlcN(Ac)-PI, GlcN(Ac)4Me-PI, (Fig.1 A, lanes 4–11), GalN(Ac)-PI and ManN(Ac)-PI (Fig. 1 B, lanes 3, 4, 9, and 10). The only analogues that delivered3H-labeled mannosylated products were 6-dGlcN-PI and 6-dGlcNAc-PI (Fig. 1 B, lanes 5–8). The slightly higher Rf values of the 3H-labeled mannosylated glycolipids generated with 6-dGlcN(Ac)-PI (Fig. 1 B,lanes 5–8), compared with those of GlcN(Ac)-PI (Fig.1 B, lanes 1 and 2), are consistent with the lower polarity of the 6-deoxy compounds. Analysis of the 3H-labeled mannosylated glycolipids formed from 6-dGlcNAc-PI (Fig. 1 B, lanes 7 and8) showed they were all sensitive to deamination, GPI-PLD, and base treatment, indicating they are all GPI intermediates containing an amino sugar and a diacylglycerol lipid anchor (TableI). Glycolipids aM2(6-d), aM3(6-d), and C′(6-d) were resistant to PI-PLC, indicating that they are inositol acylated, and all glycolipids, except A′(6-d) and C′(6-d), were sensitive to JBαM, indicating the presence of at least one terminal αMan residue. The 3H-labeled mannosylated glycolipids obtained from 6-dGlcN-PI were also subjected to headgroup analysis. Neutral glycan headgroups were obtained from HPTLC-purified glycolipids by deacylation, deamination, reduction, and dephosphorylation. The desalted products were analyzed by Bio-Gel P4 Gel filtration (Table I). The headgroups are ∼0.2 glucose units smaller than those of authentic Man1–3(2,5-anydromannitol) (47Ferguson M.A.J. Fukuda M. Kobata A. Glycobiology: A Practical Approach. IRL Oxford University Press, Oxford1994: 349-383Google Scholar), presumably due to the presence of the 6-deoxy group, which would give rise to 2–5-anhydro-6-deoxymannnitol on deamination of the 6d-GlcN residue.Table ICharacterisation of the [3H]mannosylated glycolipids formed in the trypanosomal cell-free system with various analogues of GlcN-PIAbbreviations1-aSee Fig. 5 for corresponding bands.

Open table in a new tab Taken together, these findings suggest that the novel 6-dGlcNAc-PI analogue is a substrate for the de-N-acetylase, all three α-mannosyltransferases, the inositol acyltransferase, ethanolamine phosphate transferase, and ultimately, the inositol deacylase. The slight build up of the M2 species suggests that the third α-mannosyltransferase (MT-3) has a somewhat decreased affinity for Man26-dGlcN-PI compared with Man2GlcN-PI. We have noted previously that trypanosomal GlcNAc-PI de-N-acetylase will act on the β-(1–6)-linked GlcN[3H]Ac-PI as well as on the natural α-anomer (39Smith T.K. Crossman A. Borissow C.N.

https://openalex.org/W2088514801,"The role of the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump (PMCA) is to remove excess Ca2+from the cytosol to maintain low intracellular Ca2+ levels. Asp1080 lies within an acidic sequence between the C-terminal inhibitory region and the catalytic core of PMCAs and is part of the caspase-3 recognition site of isoform 4b. Caspase-3 cuts immediately after this residue and activates the pump by removing the inhibitory region (Pászty, K., Verma, A. K., Padányi, R., Filoteo, A. G., Penniston, J. T., and Enyedi, Á. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 6822–6829). Asp1080 had not been believed to have any other role, but here we show that it also plays a critical role in the autoinhibition and calmodulin activation of PMCA4b. Site-specific mutation of Asp1080 to Asn, Ala, or Lys in PMCA4b resulted in a substantial increase in the basal activity in the absence of calmodulin. All Asp1080 mutants exhibited an increased affinity for calmodulin because of an increase in the rate of activation by calmodulin. This rate was higher when the inhibition was weaker, showing that a strong inhibitory interaction slows the activation rate. In contrast, mutating the nearby Asp1077had no effect on basal activity or calmodulin activation. We propose that the conserved Asp1080, even though it is neither in the regulatory domain nor in the catalytic core, plays an essential role in inhibition by stabilizing the inhibited state of the enzyme.

Its role is to remove excess Ca2+ from the cell to maintain low cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations critical for cell survival and Ca2+ signaling. An increase in cellular Ca2+results in an increase in substrate Ca2+ at the transport site of the pump, as well as an increase in activator Ca2+-calmodulin complex. PMCAs are encoded by four genes, and alternative splicing of the primary transcripts produces many more isoform variants (1Strehler E.E. Zacharias D.A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 21-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Two of the four PMCA gene products (PMCA1 and PMCA4) are ubiquitous, whereas the expression of PMCA2 and PMCA3 appears to be more cell- and tissue-specific. PMCA4b has a low activity in the absence of calmodulin and thus a great stimulation by calmodulin (2Enyedi Á. Verma A.K. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10621-10626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A series of experiments using peptides and C-terminally truncated mutants of hPMCA4b showed that the high affinity calmodulin binding region lay within a 28-residue sequence between Leu1086 and Ser1113 (3Enyedi Á. Vorherr T. James P. McCormick D.J. Filoteo A.G. Carafoli E. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12313-12321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,4Verma A.K. Enyedi Á. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1687-1691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that the same region is responsible for most of the autoinhibition, but a downstream sequence (between Ser1113 and Asp1157) also contributes. Removal of the whole C terminus from Leu1086 to the end resulted in a constitutively active enzyme; it could not be further activated by addition of calmodulin (2Enyedi Á. Verma A.K. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10621-10626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cross-linking experiments with the calmodulin binding synthetic peptide C28 have revealed that C28 interacts with two sites within the catalytic core of PMCA; one is located downstream of the phosphoenzyme forming aspartic acid between residues 537–544, and the other is within the small cytoplasmic loop (transduction domain or activation domain) (5Carafoli E. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 993-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 6Falchetto R. Vorherr T. Brunner J. Carafoli E. J. Biol.

Although the contribution of the sequence between residues Leu1086 and Asp1157 to the regulation of the enzyme has been studied extensively, the role of the sequence between transmembrane domain 10 and Leu1086 is poorly understood. Because this region belongs neither to the autoinhibitory domain nor to the catalytic core of the enzyme, it may be considered as a connecting region or hinge. A highly acidic region is located just upstream of the calmodulin-binding/autoinhibitory sequence. This acidic region is rich in proline, aspartic/glutamic acid, and serine/threonine and has been suggested to play a role in calpain recognition (8Wang K.K.W. Villalobo A. Roufogalis B.D. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 693-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar); however, experiments using peptides from isoform 1 did not support this idea (9Molinari M. Anagli J. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2032-2035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Also, it has been suggested that this acidic region contains a high affinity Ca2+ binding site, but its role in the regulation of the pump has not been addressed (10Hofmann F. James P. Vorherr T. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10252-10259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, part of the upstream region (between Glu1067 and Arg1087) was suggested to encode a “masked” signal for endoplasmic reticulum retention that was functional only when the C terminus downstream of it was removed (11Zvaritch E. Vellani F. Guerini D. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2679-2688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In more recent experiments, we have demonstrated that Asp1080, located in this hinge region five residues upstream of the calmodulin binding domain of hPMCA4b, is a target for caspase-3 cleavage. hPMCA4b is cut by caspase-3 downstream of Asp1080 specifically upon the early phase of apoptosis, producing a single 120-kDa fragment (12Pászty K. Verma A.K. Padányi R. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. Enyedi Á. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6822-6829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This fragment showed the same characteristics as the constitutively active ct120, which is truncated at Glu 1085; it was fully active in the absence of calmodulin. In the previous paper (12Pászty K. Verma A.K. Padányi R. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. Enyedi Á. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6822-6829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) we also showed that mutation of Asp1080 to Ala in the Asp1077-Glu-Ile-Asp1080 caspase recognition sequence abolished the susceptibility of hPMCA4b to caspase-3. In the present paper we have analyzed the functional consequences of that mutation. When we tested the caspase-3-resistant Asp1080→ Ala mutant for Ca2+-transport activity, we found that it was almost fully active in the absence of calmodulin. This was the first evidence that the hinge region referred to above may be involved in the autoinhibitory interaction. Therefore, we have studied further the role of Asp1080 in the regulation of hPMCA4b. We have mutated Asp1080 to Ala, to Asn, and to Lys and found that these mutations not only activated the pump substantially but also increased its affinity for calmodulin. The increased affinity was because of an increased rate of activation by calmodulin. Our data indicate that Asp1080 plays an essential role in autoinhibition and that the rate of calmodulin activation of these mutants of hPMCA4b depends on the degree of autoinhibition. Calmodulin was obtained from Sigma. LipofectAMINE and OPTI-MEM were obtained from Invitrogen. All other chemicals used for this study were of reagent grade. Mutation at Asp1080 and Asp1077 was done by the double PCR method as described previously (12Pászty K. Verma A.K. Padányi R. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. Enyedi Á. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6822-6829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, the first PCR product was made by amplification of an hPMCA4b sequence using a primer containing the desired mutation and a primer including a unique restriction site (BamHI) already present in the sequence. The product of this PCR was then used as primer for a second round of PCR with the other primer including the second unique site (NsiI). The PCR products were cloned using the blunt PCR cloning kit from Invitrogen and sequenced by the Mayo Molecular Biology Core Facility. TheNsiI-BamHI piece was cut out and placed into the wild type hPMCA4b in pSP72. The full-lengthSalI-KpnI piece was then cut out of pSP72 and ligated into expression vector pMM2. COS-7 cells were grown at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine.

Briefly, cells were grown in 175-cm2 flasks to 70–80% confluence. Cells were incubated at 37 °C with DNA-LipofectAMINE complex (formed by incubating 8 μg of DNA and 100 μl of LipofectAMINE in 3.6 ml of serum-free OPTI-MEM medium for 30 min) in 14.5 ml of serum-free OPTI-MEM medium. After 5 h of incubation cells were supplemented with serum; 24 h later the incubation medium was replaced with fresh tissue culture medium, and cells were harvested after an additional 24 h. Crude microsomal membranes from COS-7 cells were prepared as described (2Enyedi Á. Verma A.K. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol.

Microsomes of 20 μg/ml concentration were added, and Ca2+ uptake was initiated by the addition of 5 mm ATP. The reaction was terminated by rapid filtration of the microsomes using Millipore membrane filters (0.45-μm pore size). Data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software Inc.).

Phosphorolysis of MESG was monitored by an increase in absorbance at 360 nm at 37 °C on a Beckman DU 70 spectrophotometer. Data were fitted to the following equation: Y(t) =Y0 − vc/k + (v0 + vc)t + (vc/k)exp(−kt), whereY0 is the absorbance at 360 nm at time zero,v0 is the steady state slope in the absence of calmodulin, and (v0 + vc) is the steady state slope in the presence of 235 nmcalmodulin (18Caride A.J.

In this paper we have made additional mutants (Asp1080 → Asn and Asp1080 → Lys) and studied further the effect of mutations in the1077DEID1080 sequence on the activity of the pump. The mutants made are shown in Fig.1 A. Fig. 1 B shows that the mutants have the expected size and are expressed equally well in COS cells. ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake by COS cell membrane vesicles was measured at a saturating Ca2+concentration in the presence and absence of calmodulin. Fig.2 shows that all Asp1080mutants had higher basal activity in the absence of calmodulin than the wild type. The Asp1080 → Ala and Asp1080 → Lys mutants were almost fully active in the absence of calmodulin. Although the Asp1080 → Asn mutant showed considerably lower basal activity than the alanine or lysine mutants, it still had about 2–3 times higher basal activity than the wild type enzyme. In contrast, the basal activity of the Asp1077 → Ala mutant did not differ substantially from the wild type and was between 20 and 30% of that of the maximum. The basal activity of the wild type hPMCA4b is typically between 15 and 20% of the maximal activity in the presence of calmodulin. Although surprising, these data pointed out that the sequence between transmembrane domain 10 and the calmodulin binding/autoinhibitory sequence can play an important role in autoinhibition and that Asp1080 must be one of the key residues of that region that are involved in stabilizing the inhibited conformation of the enzyme in the resting state (i.e. in the absence of calmodulin).Figure 2Mutation at Asp1080(Asp1080→Ala (DA), Asp1080→Lys (DK), and Asp1080→Asn (DN)) increased the basal activity of PMCA. Ca2+ transport by COS cell membrane vesicles was assayed at 8.1 μm free Ca2+ in the absence of calmodulin. Maximum Ca2+ uptake was also determined for each construct at 235 nm calmodulin, and the activities shown were expressed as a percentage of this maximum. In the presence of calmodulin the activities of the constructs were nearly identical but varied from one expression to another between 3 and 6 nmol Ca2+/(mg of membrane protein, in min). Thebars represent the means ± S.E. of three independent determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The curves in Fig. 3 show the activity of the mutants as a function of Ca2+ concentration. The activities were measured in both the presence and absence of calmodulin. In the presence of calmodulin the curves of all constructs were nearly identical as shown in Fig. 3 B and indicated by the parameters shown in Table I. This suggests that mutation of Asp1080 increased specifically the basal activity of the pump with no effect on the characteristics of the fully active form of the enzyme. In the absence of calmodulin the Asp1080 mutants all had substantially higher maximal velocity and Ca2+ affinity than the wild type (see Fig. 3 A and Table I). At saturating Ca2+ concentrations calmodulin increased the activity of the Asp1080 → Ala and Asp1080 → Lys mutants only by a factor of 1.2–1.3 whereas the Asp1080 → Asn mutant retained more autoinhibition. This latter mutant was stimulated by calmodulin about 2.5 times at saturating Ca2+concentrations. However, this is still much less than the 5–7-fold stimulation observed in the wild type. In all cases the affinity for Ca2+ was further increased by calmodulin.Table IKinetic characteristics of the Asp-1080 and Asp-1077 mutants as judged by steady state Ca2+ transport assaysK 1/2for Ca2+V max (% of maximum)K 1/2 for Calmodulin− Calmodulin+ Calmodulin− CalmodulinμmnmWild type1.49 ± 0.250.25 ± 0.0822 ± 663 ± 13D1077A0.57 ± 0.110.17 ± 0.0532 ± 660 ± 12DN0.62 ± 0.120.18 ± 0.0443 ± 335 ± 6DA0.52 ± 0.150.13 ± 0.0579 ± 814 ± 2DK0.58 ± 0.130.15 ± 0.0375 ± 617 ± 3Ca2+ transport assays for the mutants were done as described in the legends of Figs. 3 and 4.

Open table in a new tab Ca2+ transport assays for the mutants were done as described in the legends of Figs. 3 and 4. Maximal Ca2+ transport activities were determined for each mutant at saturating Ca2+ and calmodulin concentrations. Data of three independent determinations were fitted using the Hill equation as given in GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software Inc.). Then we tested the effect of mutation at Asp1080 on the calmodulin affinity. We measured the Ca2+ transport activity of the constructs as a function of calmodulin concentration at a relatively low (0.3 μm) Ca2+ concentration (Fig. 4). This low Ca2+concentration was chosen, because under these conditions the stimulation with calmodulin was greater than at saturating Ca2+ concentrations. To reach steady state or near steady state conditions, the membranes were preincubated with calmodulin for 5–10 min at 37 °C. Fig. 4 shows that each Asp1080mutant had higher affinity for calmodulin than the wild type. In contrast mutation at Asp1077 did not affect calmodulin affinity. The K 0.5s for calmodulin of the Asp1080 → Ala, Asp1080 → Lys, and Asp1080 → Asn mutants were 14 ± 2, 17 ± 3, and 29 ± 6 nm, respectively, compared with 65 ± 11 nm for the wild type hPMCA4b. It is apparent from TableI. that the increase in calmodulin affinity was greater for the mutants Asp1080 → Ala and Asp1080 → Lys, which had higher basal activity than for the mutant Asp1080 → Asn, which had lower basal activity. An increase in steady state calmodulin affinity could be because of an increase in the rate of activation by calmodulin (the product of conformational opening of PMCA and calmodulin association) or a decrease in the rate of inactivation by calmodulin removal (the product of calmodulin dissociation and conformational closing of PMCA). We have shown previously that activation of the wild type hPMCA4b by 235 nm calmodulin in the presence of 500 nm free Ca2+ has a half-time of about 40 to 60 s and that the rate of inactivation is much slower, with a half-time of about 20 min (18Caride A.J. Elwess N.L. Verma A.K. Filoteo A.G. Enyedi Á. Bajzer Z̆. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35227-35232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To measure the rate of activation, wild type, Asp1080→ Ala or Asp1080 → Asn pumps were allowed to reach steady state ATPase activity in the absence of calmodulin at 500 nm Ca2+ and then activation was initiated by the addition of 235 nm calmodulin. These Ca2+and calmodulin concentrations provide for a rate of activation that is slow enough to monitor by a conventional spectrophotometer yet yield a sufficient change in steady state activity. Fig.5 shows a typical experiment with the Asp1080 → Ala mutant. The activation rate constants were calculated from the change in the slopes using the equation described in the legend of Fig. 5. The values for k act for the Asp1080 → Asn and Asp1080 → Ala mutants were 2 and 3 times higher, respectively, than that of the wild type hPMCA4b (Table II).Table IIPre-steady state parameters of the Asp-1080 mutantsk act (s−1, M−1) ± S.E.k inact (s−1) ± S.E.K dnmWild type0.58 × 105 ± 0.09 × 1050.84 × 10−3 ± 0.13 × 10−314.5DN1.28 × 105 ± 0.14 × 1051.00 × 10−3 ± 0.19 × 10−37.9DA1.85 × 105 ± 0.12 × 105ND (assume 4b)2-aThe k inact for the D1080A mutant was not determined.

Open table in a new tab The parameters of the constructs were determined as described under “Materials and Methods” and in the legend of Fig. 5. Because the 2–3-fold increase in the rate of activation by calmodulin of both mutants fully accounted for the 2–4 times higher affinity for calmodulin observed in the steady state experiments we assumed that the mutation did not affect substantially the rate of inactivation by calmodulin removal. To test this assumption, the rate of inactivation was measured for one of the mutants. Inactivation measurements were performed by incubating wild type or mutant hPMCA4b with 500 nm free calcium and 235 nm calmodulin and allowing the reaction to reach a constant ATPase activity. Then a vast excess of calmodulin binding peptide from myosin light chain kinase was added to the reaction mixture (18Caride A.J. Elwess N.L. Verma A.K. Filoteo A.G. Enyedi Á. Bajzer Z̆. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35227-35232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The myosin light chain kinase peptide has no direct effect on PMCA but will sequester any calmodulin that dissociates from PMCA. The inactivation rate constant (k inact) was obtained by a fit to the equation for inactivation. Inactivation experiments were done only with the Asp1080 → Asn mutant, because its larger activation with calmodulin allowed an accurate determination of the inactivation rate constant. As expected, mutation at Asp1080 did not affect k inact. The rate constants of the mutant and the wild type were nearly identical within the range of the variability of the assay system (Table II). Based on the k act andk inact constants, we calculated theK ds for the mutants and the wild type. When compared with the wild type, the K ds for the mutants were 2–3-fold times lower, in good correlation with the steady state assays. In this study we analyzed the role of a conserved aspartic acid residue (Asp1080) between transmembrane domain 10 and the calmodulin binding/autoinhibitory domain of PMCAs in the regulation of the pump by calmodulin. We mutated this residue in hPMCA4b, which is one of the ubiquitously expressed isoforms of PMCA, and the effect of the mutation was tested by kinetic analysis. Because Asp1080 is highly conserved among PMCAs, our data should provide a more general information of how PMCAs are regulated by calmodulin. In the absence of Ca2+-calmodulin, the pump is in an inhibited or “closed” conformation. In isoform hPMCA4b the closed conformation has very low activity. It has been demonstrated that the calmodulin binding domain itself is responsible for most of the inhibition (4Verma A.K. Enyedi Á. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1687-1691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments using synthetic peptides have revealed that in the inhibited state the calmodulin binding domain interacts with both cytoplasmic loops (5Carafoli E. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 993-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 6Falchetto R. Vorherr T. Brunner J. Carafoli E. J. Biol.

This interaction makes the catalytic sites less accessible. Activation by Ca2+-calmodulin frees the catalytic sites from the autoinhibition and increases the apparent Ca2+ affinity and maximum activity of the enzyme. Truncation of hPMCA4b at the C terminus has shown that residues downstream of the calmodulin binding domain between Ser1113 and Asp1157 also contribute to inhibition, because removal of these contacts caused partial activation of the pump (4Verma A.K. Enyedi Á. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1687-1691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies showed that mutations and truncations in the calmodulin binding domain (4Verma A.K. Enyedi Á. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1687-1691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Penheiter A.R. Caride A.J. Enyedi Á. Penniston J.T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 32461-32467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and catalytic core (21Ba-Thein W. Caride A.J. Enyedi Á. Pászty K. Croy C.L. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) all affected the basal activity in the absence of calmodulin. Here we have shown that mutation of a residue outside of the three regions described previously also causes such a change. We have demonstrated that mutation of a single aspartate residue upstream of the conventional calmodulin binding/autoinhibitory domain of hPMCA4b increased the basal activity (i.e. the activity in the absence of calmodulin) substantially but did not affect the overall catalytic function of the enzyme. Calmodulin was still able to increase the activity of the mutants, however, to a much smaller extent at saturating Ca2+ concentrations 1.2–1.3 times in the case of the alanine and lysine mutants and about 2–2.5 times for the asparagine mutant as compared with a 5–7-times stimulation of the wild type. It is very unlikely that the higher basal activities of the mutants were because of a higher calmodulin content of the membrane, because 1) the microsomes were washed extensively with Ca2+chelators, and 2) the mutation did not affect the rate of calmodulin removal. All these data suggest that these mutants have their conformational equilibria shifted more toward the open, active conformation. The role of Asp1080 appears to be rather specific, because mutation of another aspartate (Asp1077) in close proximity to Asp1080 did not have any effect. The change in the basal activity was greatest when the acidic aspartate side chain was replaced by a non-polar alanine or a positively charged lysine side chain. These mutations affected the activity equally. The more conservative substitution of an amido group for the carboxyl group had less effect. These data indicate that the aspartate side chain plays an essential role in autoinhibition by stabilizing the autoinhibited closed conformation of the pump. Mutation at Asp1080 destabilized this conformation and caused activation of the protein as each mutant showed an increased basal activity and affinity for Ca2+ activation. Because no structural data are available for PMCAs, the nature of the interactions remains unclear. We may hypothesize that electrostatic interactions are involved; however, the greater inhibition retained in the asparagine mutant suggests that the oxygen atoms of the carboxylate group may form hydrogen bonds that are only partially perturbed in the asparagine mutant. In addition to the change in the basal activity, mutation at Asp1080 increased the apparent affinity of the pump for calmodulin. The increase in affinity was because of an increased rate of activation by calmodulin. The rate of inactivation by calmodulin removal was not affected by the mutation. This change in calmodulin affinity was greatest for the mutants that had the highest basal activity (alanine and lysine). Thus, the increase in calmodulin affinity was proportional to the increase observed in the basal activity of the mutants. A general property of calmodulin is that it is able to induce secondary structure in a peptide that is unstructured prior to binding (22Ikura M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Zhu G. Klee C.B. Bax A. Science. 1992; 256: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar, 23Vorherr T. James P. Krebs J. Enyedi Á. McCormick D.J. Penniston J.T. Carafoli E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 355-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Thus, the Asp1080 mutation, which is outside of the calmodulin binding domain, should not affect the structure of the final calmodulin-bound state of the pump. This is consistent with the observation that mutation at Asp1080 did not affect the rate of inactivation by calmodulin removal, i.e.dissociation of calmodulin from the calmodulin binding domain. Rather mutation at this residue seems to have an indirect effect on the interaction of the calmodulin binding/autoinhibitory domain with the catalytic core. We suggest that calmodulin activates the Asp1080 mutants faster because of a looser competing interaction of the calmodulin binding domain with the catalytic core of PMCA that is reflected in a higher basal activity. This appears to be a general property of PMCAs, because all mutations and truncations made so far that increased the basal activity of the pump (18Caride A.J. Elwess N.L. Verma A.K. Filoteo A.G.

It had been demonstrated that the free calmodulin binding peptide C28 representing the calmodulin binding domain of PMCA4b had a much higher affinity for calmodulin than intact hPMCA4b (3Enyedi Á.

R. Penheiter, A. G. Filoteo, K. Torok, and A. J. Caride, personal communication. showed that the rate of activation by calmodulin of the truncated mutant ct120 with bound C28 peptide was much slower than binding of calmodulin to the C28 peptide in solution. This indicates that association of the calmodulin binding domain with the cytoplasmic loops slows down the reaction with calmodulin. Moreover, the rate of activation of the ct120-C28 complex was about three times faster than the rate of activation of ct92 in which the C28 sequence is tethered to the enzyme. This is consistent with our present finding, which shows that an activating mutation in the hinge region also increases the rate of activation by calmodulin three times. In summary, our data suggest that Asp1080 serves as a contact point in the connecting region or hinge upstream of the calmodulin binding domain that assists in orienting the calmodulin binding domain to the catalytic sites to form stable autoinhibited conformation of the enzyme. Other contact points could be within the downstream inhibitory region, because ct92 still has higher basal activity than the wild type protein. We also conclude that weaker autoinhibitory interactions result in an increased rate of activation by calmodulin. We thank Krisztina Lór for skillful technical assistance."

The PGES enzymes are glutathione-dependent and involved in the conversion of PGH2 to PGE2. cPGES localizes to the cytosol and is a constitutively expressed enzyme, identical to p23, a chaperone for the hsp90/glucocorticoid receptor complex (8Tanioka T.

On the other hand, mPGES represents a microsomal protein, is inducible by cytokines, and glucocorticoid repressible (9Murakami M. Naraba H. Tanioka T. Semmyo N. Nakatani Y. Kojima F. Ikeda T.

A number of different cell types have been examined and found to express both mPGES and cPGES (7Jakobsson P.-J. Thorén S. Morgenstern R. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The authors of those earlier studies concluded that these associations yield efficient enzyme pairs. These initial findings have been extended subsequently to human synovial fibroblasts where treatment with IL-1β or tumor necrosis factor-α up-regulated mPGES mRNA and protein in a manner that is coordinated with an induction of PGHS-2 (11Stichtenoth D.O. Thorén S. Bian H. Peters-Golden M. Jakobsson P.-J. Crofford L.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 469-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). More recently, this relationship between PGHS-2 and mPGES has also been demonstrated in orbital fibroblasts (12Han R. Tsui S. Smith T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16355-16364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), cells that produce particularly high levels of PGE2 when provoked by inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, leukoregulin, and CD154 (13Wang H.-S. Cao H.J. Winn V.D. Rezanka L.J. Frobert Y. Evans C.H. Sciaky D. Young D.A. Smith T.J. J. Biol.

In those cells, an overlap in the signal transduction pathways utilized by IL-1β to induce both enzymes was demonstrated (12Han R. Tsui S. Smith T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16355-16364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). This signaling involved both p38 and ERK1/2 components of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways (12Han R. Tsui S. Smith T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16355-16364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Moreover, the induction by IL-1β of mPGES in orbital fibroblasts depends, at least in part, on the activity of PGHS-2. Glucocorticoids can block the up-regulation by IL-1β of both PGHS-2 and mPGES in synovial and orbital fibroblasts (11Stichtenoth D.O. Thorén S. Bian H. Peters-Golden M. Jakobsson P.-J. Crofford L.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 469-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 12Han R. Tsui S. Smith T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16355-16364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Because these fibroblasts are believed to play important roles in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis and Graves' ophthalmopathy, respectively, it is tempting to implicate both PGHS-2 and mPGES in these disease processes.KAT-50, an established line of human thyroid epithelial cells derived from non-neoplastic tissue, expresses high levels of constitutive PGHS-2 (16Smith T.J. Jennings T.A. Sciaky D. Cao H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15622-15632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 17Gianoukakis A.G. Cao H.J. Jennings T.A. Smith T.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C701-C708Crossref Google Scholar). Moreover, basal generation of PGE2 in these cells can be substantially diminished by treating them with PGHS-2 selective inhibitors, such as SC58125. In fact, several types of mammalian cells exhibit high levels of unstimulated PGHS-2 expression, including hepatic stellate cells (18Gallois C. Habib A. Tao J. Moulin S. Maclouf J. Mallat A. Lotersztajn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23183-23190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), bronchial epithelium (19Asano K. Lilly C.M. Drazen J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: L126-L131PubMed Google Scholar), pancreatic islet (20Sorli C.H. Zhang H.-J. Armstrong M.B. Rajotte R.V. Maclouf J. Robertson R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1788-1793Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and granulosa cells (21Narko K. Ritvos O. Ristimäki A. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3638-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). While the function of unprovoked PGHS-2 is uncertain, this enzyme may serve housekeeping roles under certain circumstances and therefore might replace the functions ordinarily ascribed to PGHS-1. In fact, PGHS-1 protein is undetectable in either un-stimulated or cytokine-activated KAT-50 cells. Moreover, most of the PGE2 production detected in KAT-50 cells derived from the action of PGHS-2 (16Smith T.J. Jennings T.A. Sciaky D. Cao H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15622-15632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Thus KAT-50 cells represent a growing list of cell types, both well differentiated and neoplastic, where PGHS-2 represents the dominant, constitutive cyclooxygenase. Of particular interest is the lack of up-regulation of PGHS-2 expression in KAT-50 cells by factors such as serum and IL-1β, agents that ordinarily enhance cyclooxygenase expression in most cell types. It was noted in the course of earlier studies that despite the high basal PGHS-2 levels, KAT-50 cells produce rather low levels of PGE2 (16Smith T.J. Jennings T.A. Sciaky D. Cao H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15622-15632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Even when treated with exogenous arachidonate, KAT-50 cultures were found to generate PGE2 levels substantially lower than those found in orbital fibroblasts when high PGHS-2 levels are induced. These observations suggested that some critical component(s) of the prostanoid synthetic machinery in KAT-50 might be suboptimally represented.In this paper, we report that KAT-50 cells, despite expressing high levels of PGHS-2, produce very low levels of PGE2 compared with orbital fibroblasts. The basis for this diminished prostanoid generation relates to an absence of detectable mPGES expression. Instead, KAT-50 cells express high levels of cPGES mRNA and protein. This disparity results from dramatically different activities of the respective PGES gene promoters. Thus, in these cells, PGHS-2 and cPGES are predominantly co-expressed, creating an inefficient enzyme pair. When mPGES expression was introduced by transiently transfecting KAT-50 cells, PGE2 production was enhanced substantially. These observations suggest that a collaboration of PGHS-2 and cPGES can occur naturally in some cells. This pairing results in relatively low levels of PGE2 generation.DISCUSSIONThyrocytes express high basal levels of PGHS-2 in culture andin situ (16Smith T.J. Jennings T.A. Sciaky D. Cao H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15622-15632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 17Gianoukakis A.G. Cao H.J. Jennings T.A. Smith T.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C701-C708Crossref Google Scholar). The cell line, KAT-50, retains the elevated PGHS-2 expression found in primary thyrocytes in vivo but the cells have lost their ability to express detectable PGHS-1 protein. These observations suggest that activities of PGHS-2 must, in some manner, suffice with regard to meeting the metabolic needs of the cell. Of note is the coincident expression in these cells of cPGES at relatively high levels but the absence of detectable mPGES mRNA or protein. This particular profile of enzyme expression results in considerably lower levels of PGE2 generation in KAT-50 cells than those observed in orbital fibroblasts which express both PGHS-2 and mPGES following cytokine treatment (Fig. 2) (12Han R. Tsui S. Smith T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16355-16364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). It is possible that the absence of an efficient pair of cyclooxygenase/PGES enzymes has resulted from adaptation to the high constitutive levels of PGHS-2, effectively protecting the cells from excess prostanoid concentrations. When the more efficient pair of enzymes is expressed, in this case by transfecting the cells with mPGES, PGE2synthesis is enhanced. This suggests strongly that the endogenously expressed PGHS-2 functions more efficiently when functionally coupled to mPGES. These results support the functional nature of the constitutively expressed PGHS-2 in KAT-50 cells. They indicate that abnormal compartmentalization of PGHS-2 protein has not rendered the enzyme inaccessible to critical pools of substrate. The current results indicate further that the disparity between mPGES and cPGES expression in KAT-50 cells is a consequence of vastly different levels of activity exhibited by the respective gene promoters. There exists no detectable activity of the mPGES promoter in these cells, in contrast to orbital fibroblasts where the promoter is active under both basal and IL-1β-treated conditions.The functional coupling between specific PGES and PGHS isoforms that leads to highly efficient PGE2 production was first demonstrated in HEK293 cells that had initially undergone stable transfections with PGHS-1 or PGHS-2 and then were transiently transfected with one of the PGES isoforms (8Tanioka T. Nakatani Y. Semmyo N. Murakami M. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32775-32782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 9Murakami M. Naraba H. Tanioka T. Semmyo N. Nakatani Y. Kojima F. Ikeda T. Fueki M. Ueno A. Oh-ishi S. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32783-32792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). mPGES co-localized with PGHS-2 and exhibited a marked enzymatic preference for PGHS-2 when arachidonate was supplied from endogenous or exogenous sources (9Murakami M. Naraba H. Tanioka T. Semmyo N. Nakatani Y. Kojima F. Ikeda T. Fueki M. Ueno A. Oh-ishi S. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32783-32792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). Likewise, cPGES and PGHS-1 formed a considerably more efficient pairing in these transfected cells (8Tanioka T. Nakatani Y. Semmyo N. Murakami M. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32775-32782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). It would seem that KAT-50 cells represent a naturally occurring example of cells expressing a pair of enzymes not optimized for efficient PGE2 production. Restoration of theoretically optimal fidelity between the cyclooxygenase and terminal prostaglandin synthase results in enhanced PGE2 synthesis.From the current studies, it would appear that IL-1β does not influence levels of cPGES expression in KAT-50 cells (Fig. 2). This finding is consistent with that in some cells types, such as HeLa, MKN45, HEK293, WI-38, CHO, and L929, but differs from the modest increase found in rat brain in vivo following treatment with lipopolysaccharide (8Tanioka T. Nakatani Y. Semmyo N. Murakami M. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32775-32782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). In previous studies, we also failed to observe a change in cPGES levels in orbital fibroblasts treated with a variety of cytokines (12Han R. Tsui S. Smith T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16355-16364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). mPGES was undetectable in KAT-50 by Western and Northern blot analysis, suggesting extremely low levels of expression of that enzyme. In contrast, the cells express high levels of cPGES. PGHS-1 constitutes the natural enzyme partner for cPGES (8Tanioka T. Nakatani Y. Semmyo N. Murakami M. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32775-32782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). While KAT-50 cells express high levels of PGHS-1 mRNA, the enzyme protein is undetectable under all culture conditions assessed. It is possible that, as a component of adaptation to culture, these cells have lost their ability to translate the mRNA. Further studies will be necessary to determine whether this transcript is competent to be translated.An important role for PGE2 in normal or pathological thyrocyte function has yet to be firmly established. High levels of PGHS-2 expression found in untreated KAT-50 cells and cultured primary thyrocytes suggest that this enzyme may predominate in prostanoid production found in thyroid. This possibility is supported by the finding of PGHS-2 protein in situ in thin-sectioned thyroid tissue from apparently healthy glands (16Smith T.J. Jennings T.A. Sciaky D. Cao H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15622-15632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The frequent involvement of the thyroid in inflammatory processes suggests that inherent properties of thyrocytes might underlie disease susceptibility. Likely participants in the tissue remodeling integral to inflammatory diseases of the thyroid include the arachidonate synthetic pathways. Limited numbers of observations have thus far been made concerning the capacity of thyrocytes to generate ecosanoids or the physiological implications of their synthesis in thyroid tissue. In FRTL-5 cells, thyrotropin can regulate arachidonate release from membrane phospholipids, the activity of PGHS, and influence the formation of prostaglandins (28Tahara K. Grollman E.F. Saji M. Kohn L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 440-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These actions were enhanced by insulin-like growth factor-1. Thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins from patients with Graves' disease activate phospholipase A2 in FRTL-5 cultures, promote the release of free arachidonate, and enhance 1,4,5-trisphosphate generation (29Atwa M.A. Smallridge R.C. Burch H.B. Gist I.D., Lu, R. Abo-Hashem E.M., El- Kannishy M.H. Burman K.D. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 135: 322-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 30Di Paola R. Menzaghi C., De Filippis V. Corda D. Di Cerbo A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 670-673PubMed Google Scholar). This action appears to be mediated through a different pathway from those effects that result in cAMP generation. Another study has shown that proliferation of FRTL-5 cells is accelerated by stimulating IgGs from patients with Graves' disease and that the inhibition of cyclooxygenase activity with indomethacin can block this effect of disease-specific immunoglobulins (31Di Cerbo A., Di Girolamo M. Guardabasso V., De Filippis V. Corda D. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1992; 74: 585-592PubMed Google Scholar). The net impact of PGE2 on many vascular beds often involves substantial vasodilatation (32Rankin J.H.G. Phernetton T.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1976; 231: 754-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Because the thyroid is extremely vascular, local production of the prostanoid may represent a key step in the regulation of perfusion patterns in this organ. PGE2 generated in thyroid tissue, regardless of the cell type generating it, can influence the immunity and condition the nature of inflammatory responses occurring in the gland. This prostanoid can bias the differentiation of naive T lymphocytes from TH1 to the TH2 phenotype (33Betz M. Fox B.S. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 108-113PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, PGE2 can influence B lymphocyte and mast cell development (34Fox B.S. Li T.-K. Immunomethods. 1993; 2: 255-260Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 35Roper R.L. Conrad D.H. Brown D.M. Warner G.L. Phipps R.P. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 2644-26251PubMed Google Scholar, 36Hu Z.-Q. Asano K. Seki H. Shimamura T. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2134-2142PubMed Google Scholar). Thus the profile of prostaglandin-generating enzymes expressed by thyrocytes can potentially influence the nature of immunocompetent cells infiltrating the gland in disease.Our findings identify, for the first time, a cell type that expresses constitutive PGHS-2 as a single, dominant cyclooxygenase isoform and yet fails to express detectable mPGES under basal or IL-1β-treated conditions. These results suggest that development of therapeutic agents selectively targeting mPGES might not interrupt the full spectrum of PGHS-2-dependent prostaglandin production. Coupling of PGHS-2 with cPGES may be more widespread than is currently appreciated. It will be of considerable interest to examine whether other cells expressing high constitutive levels of PGHS-2 exhibit similar patterns of PGES. Of particular potential importance is the high level of constitutive PGHS-2 found in the pancreatic islet (37Robertson R.P. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1379-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The inhibitory action by PGE2 on glucose-provoked insulin release suggests that the functional relationship between PGHS-2 and the PGE2 synthases could determine, at least in part, levels of glucose tolerance.The current observations are potentially important in helping to define the spectrum of relationships that exists between enzymes in the PGE2 biosynthetic pathway. They imply that, despite forming a more efficient pairing with mPGES, PGHS-2 can, under certain conditions, be co-expressed with cPGES. Whether such a “mismatch” represents a deliberate attempt by nature to limit the production of PGE2 and therefore offers some adaptive advantage is uncertain. It is possible that in the future, cells with this and potentially other suboptimal pairings of PGHS and PGES enzymes, such as PGHS-1 co-expressed with mPGES, may be identified. Examination of neoplastic cells may prove especially interesting, since overexpression of PGHS-2 dominates the phenotype and apparently influences the clinical behavior of some tumors, including colorectal adenocarcinomas (38Eberhart C.E. Coffey R.J. Radhika A. Giardiello F.M. Ferrenbach S. Dubois R.N. Gastroenterology. 1994; 107: 1183-1188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The field of prostaglandin biology has benefited enormously from the recent identification and cloning of two prostaglandin-endoperoxide H synthase (EC 1.14.99.1, PGHS)1 isoenzymes (1Funk C.D.

The activities of PGHS involve the conversion of arachidonate, first into PGG2 and subsequently into PGH2 in two rate-limiting steps, catalyzed by discrete active sites on these enzymes (10Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33157-33160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1835) Google Scholar). PGHS-1 is a constitutive enzyme involved in many “housekeeping” functions in most of the tissues and cell types thus far examined (1Funk C.D. Funk L.B. Kennedy M.E. Pong A.S. Fitzgerald G.A.

In contrast, PGHS-2, the inflammatory cyclooxygenase, is expressed at extremely low levels under basal conditions in most cell types but is highly inducible by cytokines and growth factors (3Hla T.

The PGES enzymes are glutathione-dependent and involved in the conversion of PGH2 to PGE2. cPGES localizes to the cytosol and is a constitutively expressed enzyme, identical to p23, a chaperone for the hsp90/glucocorticoid receptor complex (8Tanioka T.

It induced a greater reduction in the height of the mitochondrial and cytosolic Ca2+ transients in agonist-stimulated cells than would have been expected from the [Ca2+]er decrease. It also had a major effect on the sub-plasma membrane Ca2+concentration, [Ca2+]pm: after a transient [Ca2+]pm rise induced by the activation of capacitative Ca2+ influx, [Ca2+]pm settled to a value about 3-fold higher than in controls. The sustained [Ca2+]pm increase after the transient was due to the operation of the exchanger, either directly by operating in the Ca2+ entry mode, or indirectly by removing the Ca2+ inhibition on the capacitative Ca2+ influx channels.

It is ideally qualified for the task of rapidly removing large amounts of Ca2+ from the cytosol, because its transport capacity is very large. Normally, the system exchanges one intracellular Ca2+ for three extracellular Na+ but can also operate in the opposite direction, i.e. it can mediate Ca2+ influx, depending on the membrane potential and the gradients of Na+ and Ca2+. The physiological role of the exchanger and the mechanism of the transport reaction in the Ca2+ efflux mode are well understood. By contrast, the role and the mechanism of the Ca2+ influx mode are less well defined and still somewhat controversial. Another area of uncertainty is the regulation of the exchanger activity by Ca2+. Experiments on excised membrane patches indicate that half-maximal activity of the exchanger requires about 2 μm Ca2+ on the cytosolic side (1Matsuoka S. Hilgemann D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 963-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), but experiments in cardiac myocytes and transfected CHO1 cells indicate half-maximal activity in a lower cytosolic Ca2+concentration range, between 20 and 50 nm (2Miura Y. Kimura J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1989; 93: 1129-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 3Condrescu M. Chernaya G. Kalaria V. Reeves J.P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These differences are not trivial, because the former values would make the exchanger essentially inoperative in resting cells, whereas the latter would be compatible with exchanger activity in living cells at resting cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. It must also be considered that post-translational modifications, e.g. phosphorylations or other factors, could increase the Ca2+ affinity of the exchanger in vivo. Finally, it is likely that the Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]) sensed by the exchanger in the sub-plasma membrane zone is significantly higher than in the bulk cytoplasm. In this report we have used transiently transfected CHO cells that do not normally express Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity. After transfection with an expression vector coding for the dog cardiac exchanger (NCX1, 4), high levels of expression of the protein in the plasma membrane were achieved. To evaluate the role of the exchanger with respect to that of the other mechanisms for cellular Ca2+ transport, we have followed the procedure previously used to study the interplay of the two Ca2+-removing pumps, the plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase (PMCA) and the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) (5Brini M. Bano D. Manni S. Rizzuto R. Carafoli E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4926-4935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Targeted recombinant aequorins (6Brini M. Pinton P. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. Microsc. Res. Tec. 1999; 46: 380-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) were co-transfected with NCX1, and the handling of [Ca2+] was monitored in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), in the cytoplasm, in mitochondria, and in the restricted space beneath the plasma membrane. The results have shown that the transfected exchanger was active also in cells at rest, its activity contributing directly to the regulation of [Ca2+] in the intracellular stores. NCX1 drastically reduced the amplitude of the cytosolic and mitochondrial [Ca2+] transients generated by cell stimulation with an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3)-generating agonist. The expressed NCX1 had an unexpected effect on the homeostasis of [Ca2+] in the sub-plasma membrane domain. After the transient elicited by capacitative influx, [Ca2+] settled at a significantly higher level than in control cells, suggesting that the operation of NCX1 enhanced Ca2+ entry into the restricted space beneath the plasma membrane. CHO cells were grown in Ham's F-12 medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, in 75-cm2 Falcon flasks; before transfection, they were seeded onto 13 glass cover slips and allowed to grow to 50% confluence. At this stage transfection with 3 μg of plasmid DNA (or 1.5:1.5 μg in the case of co-transfection) was carried out as previously described (7Rizzuto R. Brini M. Bastianutto C. Marsault R. Pozzan T. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 417-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Aequorin measurements and immunocytochemistry were performed 36 h later. Cultures of cardiomyocytes were prepared from ventricles of 1- to 3-day-old rats as previously described (8Dostal D.E. Rothblum K.N. Conrad K.M. Cooper G.R. Baker K.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C851-C863Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The heart was removed and rapidly placed in saline containing 116 mm NaCl, 0.8 mm NaH2PO4, 5.3 mm KCl, 0.4 mm MgSO4, 5 mm glucose, and 20 mm HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.35. Ventricles were submitted to four digestions with 0.45 mg/ml collagenase and 5% pancreatin (20 min each). The first supernatant containing cell debris and blood cells was discarded. Cell suspensions from the three subsequent digestions were centrifuged, and the pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of newborn calf serum. Cells were pooled and resuspended in a complete medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Medium 199 (4:1), supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 mg/ml), 5% newborn calf serum, and 10% horse serum). They were then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, to permit a selective attachment of non-myocytes. The unattached cells were plated at a density of 0.35 × 106 cells/ml onto 24-well plates coated with laminin (1 μg/cm2). After the first day of culture, cells were washed and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Medium 199 (4:1) containing 5% horse serum and 0.5% newborn calf serum for 2 days. 36 h after transfection CHO cells were processed for immunofluorescence as follows: they were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 140 mmNaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, 8 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.4) for 20 min, washed three times with PBS and then incubated for 10 min in PBS supplemented with 50 mm NH4Cl. Permeabilization of membranes was obtained with a 5-min incubation with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, followed by 1 h wash with 1% gelatin (type IV, from calf skin) in PBS. Then the coverslip was processed for the NCX1 staining with a polyclonal antibody against the NCX cardiac isoform (9Li L. Guerini D. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20903-20910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) at a 1:100 dilution in PBS. Staining was then carried out with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:100 dilution in PBS, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Monza, Italy). Cells were then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in a wet chamber with monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) against the HA1 epitope tag of aequorin (6Brini M. Pinton P. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. Microsc. Res. Tec. 1999; 46: 380-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) at 1:100 dilution in PBS and consequently with a tetramethylrhodamine (TRITC)-labeled anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:50 dilution in PBS, Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). After each incubation, cells were washed four times with PBS. Fluorescence was analyzed with a Zeiss Axiovert microscope equipped with a 12-bit digital cooled camera (Micromax-1300Y, Princeton Instruments Inc., Trenton, NJ). Images were acquired using Metamorph software (Universal Imaging Corp., West Chester, PA). CHO cells and cardiomyocytes were resuspended in a solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and subjected to three cycles of freeze and thaw. The particulate fraction was sedimented at 11,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting proteins pellet was resuspended in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% sucrose. The concentration of proteins was determined with the Bradford reagent (Sigma), measuring the absorbance at 595 nm. The membrane protein samples were separated on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Eighty micrograms of total proteins was loaded onto each lane. The sheet was incubated for 1 h with a polyclonal antibody against NCX1 (9Li L. Guerini D. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20903-20910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) at a 1:500 dilution. After incubation with anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) the blot was developed with the ECL reagent (AmershamBioscience, Italy). Quantitative analysis was performed by densitometry using the Kodak 1D Image Analysis program (Kodak Scientific Imaging System, New Haven, CT). The Ca2+ content of the ER had to be drastically reduced before the reconstitution of functional erAEQ. To this end the cells were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C in KRB (Krebs-Ringer modified buffer: 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm Na3PO4, 1 mm MgSO4, 5.5 mm glucose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 37 °C), supplemented with 5 μm coelenterazine n, the Ca2+ionophore ionomycin (5 μm), and 600 μmEGTA. After this incubation, the cells were washed extensively with KRB supplemented with 2% bovine serum albumin and 1 mm EGTA and transferred to the chamber of a custom-built luminometer. Transfected cytAEQ and mtAEQ were reconstituted by incubating the cells for 1–3 h with 5 μm coelenterazine wt in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% fetal calf serum, at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Transfected low affinity pmAEQ was reconstituted by incubating the cells for 1–2 h with coelenterazine wt in KRB supplemented with 100 μm EGTA. The procedure was necessary to increase the efficiency of reconstitution of pmAEQ. The additions to the KRB (0.7–1 mm CaCl2, 100 μm ATP, 100 μm EGTA) were made as specified in the figure legends. The experiments were terminated by lysing the cells with 100 μm digitonin in a hypotonic Ca2+-rich solution (10 mm CaCl2 in H2O), to discharge the remaining aequorin pool. The light signal was collected and calibrated into [Ca2+] values as previously described (7Rizzuto R. Brini M. Bastianutto C. Marsault R. Pozzan T. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 417-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 10Brini M. Marsault R. Bastianutto C. Alvarez J. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 27694-27699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In brief, a 13-mm round coverslip with the transfected cells was placed in a perfused, thermostatted chamber placed in close proximity to a low noise photomultiplier, with a built-in amplifier discriminator. The output of the discriminator was captured by a Thorn-EMI photon counting board and stored in an IBM-compatible computer for further analyses. The aequorin luminescence data were calibrated off-line into [Ca2+] values, using a computer algorithm based on the Ca2+ response curve of wt and mutant aequorins as previously described (10Brini M. Marsault R. Bastianutto C. Alvarez J. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9896-9903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 11Montero M. Brini M. Marsault R. Alvarez J. Sitia R. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5467-5475Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Fura-2 loading was performed as previously described (13Malgaroli A. Milani D. Meldolesi J. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2145-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar): the coverslip was placed on the stage of an inverted fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axiovert 100TV) connected to a cooled charge-couple device camera (Micromax 1300Y, Princeton Instruments, Inc.). The sample was illuminated alternately at 340/380 nm, and the emitted light (filtered with an interference filter centered at 510 nm) was collected by the camera. Images were acquired using Metafluor software (Universal Imaging Corp.). The ratio values (1 ratio image/s) were calculated off-line, after background subtraction from each single image. Data are reported as means ± S.D. Statistical differences were evaluated by Student's two-tailedt test for impaired samples, with a p value 0.05 being considered statistically significant. Prior to analyzing Ca2+ homeostasis, the level of expression and the membrane distribution of recombinant NCX1 were verified. CHO cells were transfected with the cDNA of NCX1 cloned in the mammalian expression vector pSG5 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and analyzed 36 h later under the epifluorescence microscope. A polyclonal antibody specific for NCX1 (9Li L. Guerini D. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20903-20910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) yielded a strong signal, with a clear decoration of the cell surface. The pattern was that of cells expressing plasma membrane proteins, showing that the transfected exchanger had been correctly targeted. A weak reticular positivity throughout the cytoplasm was also visible, indicating that a (minor) portion of the transfected NCX was retained in the ER (Fig.1 A). The co-expression of NCX1 and the aequorin probe were demonstrated by dual labeling immunocytochemistry. (In the experiment shown in Fig. 1 A, NCX was revealed by FITC staining, and mitochondrially targeted aequorin, mtAEQ, by TRITC staining. As expected, the two stains did not overlap and showed the expected patterns.) The level of recombinant exchanger expression in CHO cells was compared with that of the endogenous NCX in primary cultures of rat ventricular cardiac myocytes by Western blotting and densitometric analysis (Fig.1 B). Crude membrane extracts were obtained from these samples (as described under “Experimental Procedures”) and loaded on SDS-PAGE. The nitrocellulose membrane was probed with the NCX isoform 1 specific antibody (9Li L. Guerini D. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20903-20910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 B shows that in NCX-transfected CHO cells (lane 1) and cardiac myocytes (lane 2) the antibody recognized mainly two proteins migrating with apparent molecular masses of about 160 and about 120 kDa. As expected, no signal was detected in lane 3corresponding to CHO cells transfected with the empty vector. The Na+/Ca2+ exchanger routinely appears on SDS-PAGE with main bands of about 120 and 160 kDa. A 70-kDa proteolytic product was also frequently present. The 120-kDa band corresponds to the mature protein (14Santacruz-Toloza L. Ottolia M. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 182-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The level of NCX expression (the 120- and 160-kDa bands) in CHO cells was estimated to be about 15- to 20-fold lower than in cardiac myocytes. Because the average transfection efficiency was in the 15–25% range, the amount of exogenous exchanger, corrected for the whole cell population, would be about 3- to 4-fold lower than that of cardiac myocytes. Endoplasmic reticulum-targeted aequorin, erAEQ, was used to measure the Ca2+ concentration in the ER lumen. Functional aequorin was reconstituted as previously described (11Montero M. Brini M. Marsault R. Alvarez J. Sitia R. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5467-5475Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) with a modified prosthetic group, coelenterazine n, to decrease the Ca2+ affinity of the photoprotein and thus permit the measurement of the high concentration of Ca2+ in the ER lumen (12Barrero M.J. Montero M. Alvarez J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27694-27699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). After aequorin reconstitution in a Ca2+-free medium, the cells were transferred to the luminometer chamber, and store refilling was initiated by supplementing the Krebs-Ringer buffer (KRB) perfusion medium with a concentration of Ca2+corresponding to that of the extracellular space (1 mm). The experiment in Fig. 2 Ashows parallel batches of CHO cells transfected with erAEQ alone or co-transfected with erAEQ and NCX1. Approximately 1 min after Ca2+ addition, [Ca2+]er reached a steady-state level in control cells, which, in agreement with previous reports, was about 600 μm (617.15 ± 65.35 μm, n = 13). In NCX-expressing cells [Ca2+]er was about 15% lower (523.54 ± 39.26 μm, n = 13). The rate of Ca2+ release from the ER store induced by the InsP3-generating agonist ATP was slightly slower in NCX-expressing cells. In principle, this could have been due to the activity of the fraction of NCX retained in the ER membrane, which could have counteracted the activity of the InsP3-sensitive channels by transporting Ca2+ back to the ER lumen from a microdomain of high [Ca2+] generated in its proximity. This, however, seems very unlikely. On one hand, proteins destined to a given membrane system are normally inactive when retained somewhere else. On the other hand, the transport of Ca2+ into the ER would demand a significant Na+ gradient across the membrane of the latter, which to our knowledge has never been reported. Because the differences in the [Ca2+]er level were presumably due to the reduction in the cytosolic [Ca2+], we decided to evaluate the latter in control and NCX-expressing cells. The steep response curve of aequorin makes it difficult to accurately estimate [Ca2+] at concentration <200–300 nm, thus computerized image analysis with Fura-2 was used instead in cells expressing the NCX, which were identified by co-transfection with the green fluorescent protein. The resting fluorescence values (i.e. the 340/380 nm fluorescence values minus the background) were slightly reduced in NCX-expressing cells: 0.357 ± 0.082 in NCX-expressing cells (121 cells) and 0.383 ± 0.078 in control cells (143 cells), p = 0.008. The effects of NCX on the cytosolic and mitochondrial [Ca2+] transients ([Ca2+]c and [Ca2+]m) were then studied following agonist stimulation. Fig. 2 B shows that the average peak value of 3.03 ± 0.30 μm (n = 17) for the [Ca2+]c transient (measured with cytosolic-targeted aequorin, cytAEQ), in control cells, was drastically reduced in the cells expressing NCX1 (to 0.93 ± 0.46 μm, n = 16). Similar results were also obtained in fura-2 experiments (data not shown). Fig. 2 Cshows a similar experiment on CHO cells co-transfected with the low affinity variant of mtAEQ (15Montero M. Alonso M.T. Carnicero E. Cuchillo-Ibanez I. Albillos A. Garcia A.C. Garcia-Sancho J. Alvarez J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) and mtAEQ/NCX plasmids. The [Ca2+]m peak induced by ATP was 63.07 ± 25.27 μm (n = 22) in control cells and much lower (17.00 ± 7.18 μm, n = 19) in NCX-expressing cells. The decrease of the cytosolic and mitochondrial [Ca2+] transients in NCX-expressing cells could either have been due to the approximate 15% reduction of [Ca2+] in the ER lumen, or, alternatively, to the direct removal of Ca2+ from the cytoplasm by the expressed NCX, which would reduce the [Ca2+] “hotspots” at the mouth of the InsP3-sensitive and the plasma membrane channels. To discriminate between the two alternatives, the degree of Ca2+ filling of the ER lumen was titrated-down. CHO cells transfected with erAEQ were re-exposed to KRB supplemented with 0.7 mm, instead of 1 mm CaCl2. Fig.3 A shows that the procedure lowered the plateau of [Ca2+]er to 526.05 ± 23.60 μm, n = 8 (as compared with 617.15 ± 65.35 μm, n= 13 in cells exposed to 1 mm Ca2+, see above), a value which was similar to that in cells expressing NCX in KRB supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2 (523.54 ± 39.26 μm, n = 13, see above). The same protocol of ER empting and refilling was applied to CHO cells transfected with cytAEQ and then challenged with ATP (Fig.3 B). The height of the [Ca2+]cpeak was similar in cells exposed to 0.7 (2.50 ± 0.46 μm, n = 6) or 1 mmCaCl2 (2.57 ± 0.28 μm,n = 5), showing that the 15–20% reduction of [Ca2+]er could not account for the 70% reduction in [Ca2+]c. Evidently, the activity of NCX directly affected the height of the peak transient. Accordingly, the replacement of extracellular Na+ with Li+during the generation of the Ca2+ transients with ATP abolished the effect (data not shown). One controversial issue on the exchanger is its activity at the resting cellular [Ca2+] values, which are well below its apparent K m for Ca2+, and thus in principle inadequate to significantly activate the exchanger. Fig.2 A had nevertheless shown that NCX was active in un-stimulated cells, because its expression modulated the level of [Ca2+] filling of the ER lumen. One convenient way to explain this paradoxical observation would be by postulating that the concentration of Ca2+ in the sub-plasma membrane region, which is in immediate contact with the exchanger, is significantly higher than in the bulk cytosol, as previously reported, for example, in A7r5 smooth muscle cells (16Marsault R. Murgia M. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1575-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). It was thus decided to measure directly [Ca2+]pm in CHO cells by co-expressing the NCX and a low affinity plasma membrane-targeted aequorin chimera, pmAEQ. The measurements were performed in monolayers of cells after 60 min of exposure to coelenterazine to reconstitute aequorin. To increase the efficiency of the reconstitution no Ca2+ was added to the KRB, which was supplemented with 100 μm EGTA. When added back to the medium, Ca2+entered into the cells through plasma membrane channels, generating a transient [Ca2+]pm rise (Fig.4 A), which peaked at 78.75 ± 37.63 μm (n = 17) in control cells and at 71.56 ± 31.15 μm(n = 23) in NCX-expressing cells. After the transient, resting [Ca2+] conditions were re-established in approximately 1 min, after which time [Ca2+]pm was maintained at a plateau of about 1.93 ± 0.89 μm (n = 17) in control cells. Surprisingly, resting [Ca2+]pm was maintained at a value that was about 3-fold higher (5.90 ± 1.16 μm, n = 23) in NCX-expressing cells. The unexpected difference suggested that, under the experimental conditions, there was an increase in Ca2+ entry related to NCX expression and function. The possibility of a direct effect of the exchanger, which would mediate Ca2+ entry, was tested by replacing Na+ in the KRB medium with Li+ (or with choline chloride, data not shown), which is not transported by the exchanger (17Blaustein M.P. Biophys. J. 1977; 20: 79-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In the presence of extracellular Ca2+, the switch from Na+ to Li+ was expected to favor the Ca2+ entry operation of the exchanger, whereas in its absence the operation of the NCX was expected to be blocked. Prior to performing the measurements of [Ca2+]pm, ER, cytosolic, and mitochondrial [Ca2+] measurements were carried out. As would have been expected from the reverse operation of the exchanger, when Na+ was rapidly replaced by Li+, the ER Ca2+ content indeed increased in NCX-expressing cells but not in control cells (from 523.54 ± 39.26 μm, n = 13, to 681.00 ± 79.36 μm, n = 8). The height of the cytosolic and mitochondrial [Ca2+] transients generated by agonist stimulation also increased (data not shown). The Li+ replacement experiment was thus repeated to measure [Ca2+]pm exactly under the conditions described for Fig. 4 A. Cells were incubated in the absence of external Na+ for about 4–5 min in an Li-KRB medium supplemented with EGTA, and then 1 mm CaCl2 was added back. As shown in Fig. 4 B (light gray trace), following Ca2+ re-addition, a [Ca2+]pm transient, in all likelihood occurring via the store-operated Ca2+ influx route, was generated. In NCX-expressing cells, the amplitude of this [Ca2+]pm transient was not affected by the Li+/Na+ replacement (69.83 ± 16.05 μm, n = 6, in Li-KRB, versus71.56 ± 31.15 μm, n = 23, in Na-KRB). Unexpectedly, however, and at variance with the results shown in Fig. 4 A (and reported for comparison also in Fig.4 B, dark gray trace) the post-transient [Ca2+]pm in NCX-expressing cells was unaffected: it returned to a level similar to that of control cells (1.77 ± 0.80 μm, n = 6). Because the only difference in the experiments of Fig. 4, A andB, carried out in NCX-expressing cells was the absence of extracellular Na+, the suggestion that NCX activity in the Ca2+ extrusion mode was involved in it was plausible. The difference between the experiment in Fig. 4 B and the results described in the text above could be rationalized by assuming that the prolonged exposition of the cells to a medium free of Na+, even if the exchanger was inoperative due to the absence of external Ca2+, could still have decreased the intracellular Na+ content, because Na+ could have left the cells by other means, e.g. the Na+/K+ pump. This, however, seems unlikely. A more likely possibility was that a slight increase of the resting [Ca2+]pm in cells incubated in the Li+-KRB (promoted by the reverse operation of the exchanger) could have gone undetected by the low affinity aequorin, which had been used to measure [Ca2+] that was expected to exceed 2–3 μm. A reasonable scenario would thus be the following: as a consequence of Ca2+ influx (through the capacitative channels) and in the presence of extracellular Na+, the exchanger would initially operate in the canonical Ca2+ export mode, generating a local Na+ gradient. This could reverse the NCX operating mode (or slow down the NCX activity), promoting the influx of Ca2+. Under the experimental conditions, the local Na+ gradient could perhaps be further augmented by Na+ entry through Ca2+ influx channels (18Yue L. Peng J.B. Hediger M.A. Clapham D.E.

Following the prolonged application of Li+, the exchanger could no longer operate in the Ca2+ extrusion mode, preventing the formation of the Na+ gradient, and thus lessening the driving force for the reverse operation of the NCX. Alternatively, the NCX working in the Ca2+ extrusion mode in the presence of extracellular Na+ would promptly remove the sub-plasma membrane Ca2+, protecting the capacitative channels from Ca2+-dependent inactivation (19Hoth M.

In the absence of extracellular Na+, the activation of the NCX in the Ca2+extrusion mode would become impossible, and NCX-transfected cells would behave as control cells.

The primitive endoderm cells and the derived parietal and visceral endoderm cells gain the capacity to produce collagen IV and laminin. The deposition of these components results in the formation of basement membrane and epithelium of the endoderm, with polarized cells covering the inner surface of the blastocoels. We used retinoic acid-induced endoderm differentiation of stem cell-like F9 embryonic carcinoma cells to study the role of the Ras pathway and its regulation in the formation of the visceral endoderm. Upon endoderm differentiation of F9 cells induced by retinoic acid, c-Fos expression, the downstream target of the Ras pathway, is suppressed by uncoupling Elk-1 phosphorylation/activation to MAPK activity. However, attachment to matrix gel greatly enhances the activation of MAPK in endoderm cells but not in undifferentiated F9 cells. Enhanced MAPK activation as a result of contact with basement membrane is able to compensate for reduced Elk-1 phosphorylation and c-Fos expression. We conclude that endoderm differentiation renders the activation of the Ras pathway basement membrane dependent, contributing to the epithelial organization of the visceral endoderm.

In multicellular organisms, individual cells communicate with each other to maintain the harmony and homeostasis of the organism. One means of communication is through the release of soluble and diffusible factors such as hormones and growth factors, which bind the cell surface or nuclear receptors and trigger intracellular signaling. Direct physical contact mediated by cell surface receptors between cell-cell and cell-matrix are another kind of communication. The cell surface events transmit into the cell interior through cascades of biochemical reactions known as signal transduction, leading to modification of cellular enzymatic activities and gene expression. In the multicell structure, depending on the positioning cues provided by cell-cell and cell-matrix contacts, a particular cell type may differentially interpret the signal of a diffusible factor, leading to the modification of the intracellular signaling pathway and resulting in an integrated cellular response.The Ras/MAPK 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK/Erk, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular-signal regulated kinase; MEK, MAPK/Erk kinase; Dab2, Disabled-2; E5, embryonic day 5; LRP, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein; est, expressed sequence tag; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; SPARC, secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine. 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK/Erk, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular-signal regulated kinase; MEK, MAPK/Erk kinase; Dab2, Disabled-2; E5, embryonic day 5; LRP, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein; est, expressed sequence tag; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; SPARC, secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine. pathway is a major intracellular signaling pathway involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and tumorigenicity (1Pawson T.

Investigation of mammalian cells in culture and model organisms have established the Ras/MAPK pathway; in responding to growth factor binding to cognate cell surface receptors, the small G protein, Ras, is activated by the exchange of bound GDP for GTP (2Egan S.E. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1993; 365: 781-783Google Scholar, 3Panaretto BA. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 747-752Google Scholar). Activated Ras binds and recruits Raf-1 to the cell surface. A cascade of kinases, Raf-1, MEK, and MAPK (or Erk), is sequentially phosphorylated and activated (4Johnson G.L. Vaillancourt R.R. Curr. Opin.

One common example is that MAPK phosphorylates and activates the transcription factor Elk-1 (7Yang S.H. Yates P.R. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell.

In epithelia, the cells are often organized by a sheet of basement membrane composed of a scaffold composed mainly of collagen IV and laminin (27Timpl R. Dziadek M. Int. Rev. Exp.

It has been found that NIH3T3 fibroblasts attached to a fibronectin substratum, compared with cells in suspension, are much more efficient in transmitting the Ras/MAPK signal (20Chen Q. Kinch M.S.

The regulated step in cell attachment is the activation of Raf-1 by Ras, because tyrosine phosphorylation and Ras activation are not affected, and Raf-1, MEK, and MAPK activation are much stronger in adherent than in suspended cells (21Lin T.H.

However, the profound effects of basement membrane contact on growth, death, and differentiation of epithelial cells have been recognized (27Timpl R. Dziadek M. Int. Rev. Exp. Pathol. 1986; 29: 1-112Google Scholar, 28Martin G.R. Rohrbach D.H. Terranova V.P. Liotta L.A. Monogr. Pathol. 1983; 24: 16-30Google Scholar, 29Adams J.C. Watt F.M.

Cell Sci. 1987; 8: 327-343Google Scholar). The presence and intactness of basement membrane are dynamically regulated by altering synthesis and degradation and have important roles in development (28Martin G.R. Rohrbach D.H. Terranova V.P.

Analysis of cell-basement membrane contact on cellular signaling is lacking, probably because of the lack of proper models for epithelial cells and basement membrane in cultures. Most of the established cell lines of epithelial origin have not been able to faithfully mimic the in vivo properties of interaction with basement membrane because they have already undergone changes to become independent of the basement membrane during the process of adapting to tissue culture conditions (38Capo-chichi C.D. Smith E.R. Yang D.H. Roland I.H. Vanderveer L. Cohen C. Hamilton T.C. Godwin A.K. Xu X.X. Cancer. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar).Here, we used the F9 embryonic carcinoma cells as a model to investigate the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway and its regulation by basement membrane. F9 cells are a well characterized teratocarcinoma line derived from tumors of the gonads (testes). F9 cells are undifferentiated, with characteristics resembling those of stem cells in early embryos, and have been widely used to study early embryonic development and retinoic acid regulation (39Gajovic S. Chowdhury K. Gruss P. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 138-143Google Scholar, 40Sherman M.I. Miller R.A. Dev. Biol. 1978; 63: 27-34Google Scholar, 41Grover A. Adamson E.D. Dev.

Cell. 1999; 30: 179-184Google Scholar). Induced by retinoic acid, F9 cells undergo differentiation into visceral endoderm cells, an epithelial cell type in the early embryo (40Sherman M.I. Miller R.A. Dev. Biol. 1978; 63: 27-34Google Scholar, 41Grover A. Adamson E.D. Dev. Biol. 1986; 114: 492-503Google Scholar). We found that, accompanying epithelial differentiation of the F9 cells, the regulation of the Ras/MAPK pathway is altered (46Smith E.R. Smedberg J.L. Rula M.E. Hamilton T.C. Xu X.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32094-32100Google Scholar, 47Smith E.R. Capo-Chichi C.D., He, J. Smedberg J.L. Yang D.H. Prowse A.H. Godwin A.K. Hamilton T.C. Xu X.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47303-47310Google Scholar); the activation of MAPK and Elk-1 is uncoupled, and MAPK activation is enhanced by contact with basement membrane to compensate for the inefficiency in Elk-1 activation and c-Fos expression. Thus, the Ras/MAPK pathway is altered in F9 cell differentiation so that the cells become basement membrane-dependent.DISCUSSIONThe retinoic acid-induced differentiation of F9 embryonic carcinoma cells from stromal cells of the inner cell mass to visceral endoderm cells with epithelial properties, can be used as a model for the analysis of epithelium-basement membrane interaction. It is anticipated that cellular signaling would be modified as a result of altered gene expression during F9 cell differentiation. Retinoic acid induces the expression of laminin, collagen IV, and Dab2 (Fig.8). The promoter of the laminin gene contains retinoic acid responsive element (52Vasios G.W. Gold J.D. Petkovich M. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9099-9103Google Scholar) and may be induced directly by retinoic acid. GATA-4 and GATA-6 factors induced in embryonic stem cells and embryonic carcinoma cells mediate the expression of collagen IV and Dab2 (50Morrisey E.E. Musco S. Chen M.Y., Lu, M.M. Leiden J.M. Parmacek M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19949-19954Google Scholar).In this study, we found that the regulation of Ras/MAPK is altered when F9 cells undergo retinoic acid-induced visceral endoderm differentiation (Fig. 8). Elk-1 phosphorylation and c-Fos expression are uncoupled from MAPK activation, which is mediated by Dab2 in differentiated cells (46Smith E.R. Smedberg J.L. Rula M.E. Hamilton T.C. Xu X.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32094-32100Google Scholar, 47Smith E.R. Capo-Chichi C.D., He, J. Smedberg J.L. Yang D.H. Prowse A.H. Godwin A.K. Hamilton T.C. Xu X.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47303-47310Google Scholar). Conversely, differentiation of F9 cells results in sensitization of MAPK activation to serum stimulation when the cells are in contact with basement membranes mimicked by Matrigel (Fig. 8). The property of basement membrane contact in enhanced MAPK activation is unique for differentiated, epithelium-like F9 cells and is not present in undifferentiated F9 cells. The combination of these two separate differentiation-associated alterations results in the activation of c-Fos expression, the downstream target of Ras/MAPK pathway, to become basement membrane-dependent. As a result, following visceral endoderm differentiation, the serum- and growth factor-activated Ras/MAPK/Elk-1/c-Fos pathway and cell growth depend on attachment to basement membrane (Fig. 8). Therefore, the Ras/MAPK pathway acts to ensure the growth advantage of epithelial cells attached to the basement membrane, contributing to the organization of visceral endoderm epithelium along a sheet of basement membrane.Presumably, Dab2 expression contributes to the growth-suppressive activity of retinoic acid in F9 cells in culture by suppressing c-Fos expression, disassociated from MAPK activation. Dab2 can suppress c-Fos expression in other epithelial cell types besides endoderm cells (53He J. Smith E.R. Xu X.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26814-26818Google Scholar). Uncoupling of MAPK activation and c-Fos expression was observed in other scenarios such as the expression of α-synuclein (54Iwata A. Miura S. Kanazawa I. Sawada M. Nukina N. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 239-252Google Scholar), KSR (kinase suppressor of Ras) (55Sugimoto T. Stewart S. Han M. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1717-1727Google Scholar, 56Sugimoto T. Stewart S. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29415-29418Google Scholar), and Gab2 (57Zhao C., Yu, D.H. Shen R. Feng G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19649-19654Google Scholar). The mechanism for the uncoupling of MAPK activation and Elk-1 phosphorylation by Dab2 is not yet clear. Cellular endocytic trafficking is likely to play a role in transporting and regulating the convergence and disassociation of the kinase MAPK and the substrate Elk-1, first because Dab2 is known to associate with megalin (58Oleinikov A.V. Zhao J. Makker S.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 613-621Google Scholar) and myosin VI (59Morris S.M. Arden S.D. Roberts R.C. Kendrick-Jones J. Cooper J.A. Luzio J.P. Buss F. Traffic. 2002; 3: 331-341Google Scholar,60Inoue A. Sato O. Homma K. Ikebe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 300-307Google Scholar), and additionally, all three proteins, Dab2 (61Morris S.M. Cooper J.A. Traffic. 2001; 2: 111-123Google Scholar), megalin (62Howell B.W. Herz J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 74-81Google Scholar), and myosin VI (63Buss F. Luzio J.P. Kendrick-Jones J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 295-299Google Scholar), are thought to participate in the endocytic transport of membrane vesicles and attached signaling molecules (including MAPK and Elk-1). Furthermore, endocytosis and cellular trafficking, are known to regulate cellular signaling (64Verhey K.J. Meyer D. Deehan R. Blenis J. Schnapp B.J. Rapoport T.A. Margolis B. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 959-970Google Scholar, 65Goldstein L.S. Science. 2001; 291: 2102-2103Google Scholar).The mechanism for the effect of basement membrane contact on MAPK activation presumably involves integrins. The engagement of integrin is known to activate the Ras/MAPK pathway in NIH3T3 fibroblasts (20Chen Q. Kinch M.S. Lin T.H. Burridge K. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26602-26605Google Scholar, 24Howe A.K. Aplin A.E. Juliano R.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 30-35Google Scholar,25Lin T.H. Aplin A.E. Shen Y. Chen Q. Schaller M. Romer L. Aukhil I. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1385-1395Google Scholar). In fibroblasts, attachment of the cells to a surface, as opposed to suspension, is sufficient for MAPK activation (20Chen Q. Kinch M.S. Lin T.H. Burridge K. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26602-26605Google Scholar, 21Lin T.H. Chen Q. Howe A. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8849-8852Google Scholar, 22Renshaw M.W. Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5592-5599Google Scholar, 23Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. Cell Struct. Funct. 1996; 21: 445-450Google Scholar, 24Howe A.K. Aplin A.E. Juliano R.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 30-35Google Scholar, 25Lin T.H. Aplin A.E. Shen Y. Chen Q. Schaller M. Romer L. Aukhil I. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1385-1395Google Scholar). Unlike fibroblasts, differentiated F9 cells appear to require contact with an intact basement membrane, rather than with just the surface or individual components of the basement membrane, to enhance MAPK activation. Possibly, the collaboration between subtypes of integrins specific for binding to collagen IV and laminin mediates the MAPK activation. Alternatively, other basement membrane-binding cell surface receptors such as megalin and LRP may be involved. We found that the activity to enhance MAPK activation can be mimicked by Matrigel but not by individual or a combination of purified components, including collagen IV, laminin, and fibronectin. It is possible that other minor basement membrane component(s) such as SPARC in Matrigel contributes to the activity in enhancing MAPK activation. Alternatively, the mixing of purified individual components in vivo is not able to mimic fully the biochemical structure; hence the activity of the basement membrane. Matrigel preparation, on the other hand, may be able to preserve basement membrane properties constituted by the components thereof.The uncoupling of c-Fos expression from MAPK activation is mediated by Dab2 in both visceral endoderm cells (46Smith E.R. Smedberg J.L. Rula M.E. Hamilton T.C. Xu X.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32094-32100Google Scholar, 47Smith E.R. Capo-Chichi C.D., He, J. Smedberg J.L. Yang D.H. Prowse A.H. Godwin A.K. Hamilton T.C. Xu X.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47303-47310Google Scholar) and other epithelial cells of adult tissues such as breast (53He J. Smith E.R. Xu X.X. J. Biol.

Thus, it is likely that the role of Dab2 regulation of the Ras/MAPK pathway in epithelial organization is not unique to visceral endoderm cells but is common to other epithelial cells. Dab2 is often lost in epithelial tumor cells (67Mok S.C. Chan W.Y. Wong K.K. Cheung K.K. Lau C.C., Ng, S.W. Baldini A. Colitti C.V. Rock C.O. Berkowitz R.S.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3104-3113Google Scholar), and its loss correlates with the transformation of the epithelial cells to become basement membrane-independent and disorganized (66Sheng Z. Sun W. Smith E. Cohen C. Sheng Z. Xu X.X. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4847-4854Google Scholar, 69Yang D.H. Smith E.R. Cohen C. Patriotis C. Godwin A.K. Hamilton T.C. Xu X.X. Cancer. 2002; 94: 2380-2392Google Scholar). Previously, Dab2 has been proposed to function in epithelial cell positional organization (51Yang D.H. Smith E.R. Roland I.H. Sheng Z. He J. Martin W.D. Hamilton T.C. Lambeth J.D. Xu X.X. Dev. Biol. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar, 66Sheng Z. Sun W. Smith E. Cohen C. Sheng Z. Xu X.X. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4847-4854Google Scholar). The current conclusion that Ras/MAPK signaling is basement membrane-dependent provides a mechanism for the role of Dab2 in epithelial cell positional organization and underlines the critical role of Dab2 expression loss in the epithelial cell transformation to become basement membrane-independent in tumorigenicity. In multicellular organisms, individual cells communicate with each other to maintain the harmony and homeostasis of the organism. One means of communication is through the release of soluble and diffusible factors such as hormones and growth factors, which bind the cell surface or nuclear receptors and trigger intracellular signaling. Direct physical contact mediated by cell surface receptors between cell-cell and cell-matrix are another kind of communication. The cell surface events transmit into the cell interior through cascades of biochemical reactions known as signal transduction, leading to modification of cellular enzymatic activities and gene expression. In the multicell structure, depending on the positioning cues provided by cell-cell and cell-matrix contacts, a particular cell type may differentially interpret the signal of a diffusible factor, leading to the modification of the intracellular signaling pathway and resulting in an integrated cellular response.

Investigation of mammalian cells in culture and model organisms have established the Ras/MAPK pathway; in responding to growth factor binding to cognate cell surface receptors, the small G protein, Ras, is activated by the exchange of bound GDP for GTP (2Egan S.E. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1993; 365: 781-783Google Scholar, 3Panaretto BA. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 747-752Google Scholar). Activated Ras binds and recruits Raf-1 to the cell surface. A cascade of kinases, Raf-1, MEK, and MAPK (or Erk), is sequentially phosphorylated and activated (4Johnson G.L. Vaillancourt R.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 230-238Google Scholar, 5Whitmarsh A.J. Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 269: 403-407Google Scholar, 6Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Google Scholar). Activated MAPK can then translocate into the nucleus to phosphorylate transcription factors to modulate gene expression. One common example is that MAPK phosphorylates and activates the transcription factor Elk-1 (7Yang S.H. Yates P.R. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 710-720Google Scholar, 8Yang S.H. Shore P. Willingham N. Lakey J.H. Sharrocks A.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5666-5674Google Scholar, 9Cruzalegui F.H. Cano E. Treisman R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7948-7957Google Scholar). Subsequently, phosphorylated/activated Elk-1 binds the c-fospromoter and allows transcriptional activation of c-fos, an immediate early response gene (10Muller R. Bravo R. Burckhardt J. Curran T.

In epithelia, the cells are often organized by a sheet of basement membrane composed of a scaffold composed mainly of collagen IV and laminin (27Timpl R. Dziadek M. Int. Rev. Exp.

The cells located in the stroma are in contact with an extracellular matrix composed of proteins such as fibronectin, collagen I, collagen III, etc. (26Couchman J.R. Austria M.R. Woods A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1990; 94 (suppl.): 7S-14SGoogle Scholar). It has been found that NIH3T3 fibroblasts attached to a fibronectin substratum, compared with cells in suspension, are much more efficient in transmitting the Ras/MAPK signal (20Chen Q. Kinch M.S.
