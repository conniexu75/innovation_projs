Models for this event indicate that the distribution of coseismic fault slip exceeded 50 meters in places. Sources of high-frequency seismic waves delineate the edges of the deepest portions of coseismic slip and do not simply correlate with the locations of peak slip. Relative to the M(w) 8.8 2010 Maule, Chile earthquake, the Tohoku-Oki earthquake was deficient in high-frequency seismic radiation--a difference that we attribute to its relatively shallow depth. Estimates of total fault slip and surface secular strain accumulation on millennial time scales suggest the need to consider the potential for a future large earthquake just south of this event."

Finite-source imaging reveals that the rupture consisted of a small initial phase, deep rupture for up to 40 seconds, extensive shallow rupture at 60 to 70 seconds, and continuing deep rupture lasting more than 100 seconds. A combination of a shallow dipping fault and a compliant hanging wall may have enabled large shallow slip near the trench. Normal faulting aftershocks in the area of high slip suggest dynamic overshoot on the fault. Despite prodigious total slip, shallower parts of the rupture weakly radiated at high frequencies, whereas deeper parts of the rupture radiated strongly at high frequencies."

Combining Global Positioning System (GPS) and acoustic data, we detected very large sea-floor movements associated with this event directly above the focal region. An area with more than 20 meters of horizontal displacement, that is, four times larger than those detected on land, stretches several tens of kilometers long along the trench; the largest amount reaches about 24 meters toward east-southeast just above the hypocenter.

We have fabricated superlattices of the paramagnetic metal LaNiO3 and the wide-gap insulator LaAlO3 with atomically precise layer sequences. Using optical ellipsometry and low-energy muon spin rotation, superlattices with LaNiO3 as thin as two unit cells are shown to undergo a sequence of collective metalinsulator and antiferromagnetic transitions as a function of decreasing temperature, whereas samples with thicker LaNiO3 layers remain metallic and paramagnetic at all temperatures. Metal-oxide superlattices thus allow control of the dimensionality and collective phase behavior of correlated-electron systems."

The second PHD finger of human BPTF is known to specifically recognize histone H3 when methylated on lysine 4 (H3K4me2/3). Here, we examine how additional heterotypic modifications influence BPTF binding. Using peptide surrogates, three acetyllysine ligands are indentified for a PHD-adjacent bromodomain in BPTF via systematic screening and biophysical characterization. Although the bromodomain displays limited discrimination among the three possible acetyllysines at the peptide level, marked selectivity is observed for only one of these sites, H4K16ac, in combination with H3K4me3 at the mononucleosome level. In support, these two histone marks constitute a unique trans-histone modification pattern that unambiguously resides within a single nucleosomal unit in human cells, and this module colocalizes with these marks in the genome.

Advances in understanding the role of chromatin modifications may be divided into two separate veins: (1) enumerating and characterizing chromatin modification-effector pairs (Taverna et al., 2007Taverna S.D. Li H. Ruthenburg A.J. Allis C.D. Patel D.J. How chromatin-binding modules interpret histone modifications: lessons from professional pocket pickers.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 1025-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar) and (2) discerning relative modification patterns at the genome level and correlating these patterns to function (Bernstein et al., 2005Bernstein B.E. Kamal M. Lindblad-Toh K. Bekiranov S. Bailey D.K. Huebert D.J. McMahon S. Karlsson E.K. Kulbokas III, E.J.

Genet. 2008; 40: 897-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar). However, the convergence of these two areas—how different chromatin binding modules simultaneously engage these modification patterns to transduce downstream function—remains poorly understood. We have recently proposed that multivalent engagement of nucleosomal units bearing distinct epigenetic signatures by chromatin modification complexes may be involved in many chromatin transactions (Ruthenburg et al., 2007bRuthenburg A.J. Li H. Patel D.J. Allis C.D. Multivalent engagement of chromatin modifications by linked binding modules.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 983-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Though compelling tests of the “multivalency hypothesis” have yet to occur, earlier studies have provided hints that this phenomenon may be more general than currently appreciated: (1) Greater net binding affinity and substrate specificity beyond the sum of constituent parts may arise in the binding of two proximal acetyllysines in the H4 tail by the bromodomain proteins hTaf1 and Brdt (Jacobson et al., 2000Jacobson R.H. Ladurner A.G. King D.S. Tjian R.

Hart D.J. et al.Cooperative binding of two acetylation marks on a histone tail by a single bromodomain.Nature. 2009; 461: 664-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar); (2) Multiple contact surfaces distributed over a number of subunits (some of which appear to be histone modification dependent) are required for Rpd3S histone deacetylase complex binding to a single nucleosome (Li et al., 2007Li B. Gogol M. Carey M. Lee D. Seidel C. Workman J.L. Combined action of PHD and chromo domains directs the Rpd3S HDAC to transcribed chromatin.Science. 2007; 316: 1050-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). However, the interplay between discrete histone modification-dependent interactions has not been well studied in a nucleosomal context, nor is there a clear example of a protein complex or single polypeptide that simultaneously engages two or more histone modifications on a nucleosome for which the discrete constituent interactions are clearly defined. Thus, several key questions posed in the histone code hypothesis (Strahl and Allis, 2000Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. The language of covalent histone modifications.Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6608) Google Scholar) still remain unresolved: how are combinations of histone modifications interpreted at the molecular level, are there units of recognition beyond single tails, and what are the functional consequences? Here, we sought to address how chromatin modification patterns may be simultaneously engaged on the nucleosome level using a PHD finger and adjacent bromodomain of the NURF chromatin remodeling complex subunit BPTF as a paradigm to provide insights into the above questions. We examine the biochemical, structural, and functional properties endowed by a bivalent configuration of these linked effector domains, the simplest case of multivalent histone modification-dependent nucleosomal engagement (Ruthenburg et al., 2007bRuthenburg A.J. Li H. Patel D.J. Allis C.D. Multivalent engagement of chromatin modifications by linked binding modules.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 983-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). BPTF in the context of the NURF complex is an essential regulator of chromatin structure in development (Badenhorst et al., 2002Badenhorst P. Voas M. Rebay I. Wu C.

The second PHD finger of BPTF, implicated in recruitment or stabilization of the NURF complex to active homeotic genes as a consequence of MLL1-mediated H3K4 trimethylation, is followed closely by a bromodomain whose mechanistic role is obscure (Wysocka et al., 2006Wysocka J. Swigut T. Xiao H. Milne T.A. Kwon S.Y. Landry J. Kauer M. Tackett A.J. Chait B.T. Badenhorst P. et al.A PHD finger of NURF couples histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation with chromatin remodelling.Nature. 2006; 442: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). The spatial coupling of these two domains is sufficiently tight to permit determination of the structure of the terminal PHD-bromodomain module spanned by an apparently rigid linker α helix (Li et al., 2006Li H. Ilin S. Wang W. Duncan E.M. Wysocka J. Allis C.D. Patel D.J. Molecular basis for site-specific read-out of histone H3K4me3 by the BPTF PHD finger of NURF.Nature. 2006; 442: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Though the molecular details of H3K4me3 binding by the PHD finger are known, the ligand for the associated bromodomain remains unclear. Given that the bromodomain is a well-established histone acetyllysine recognition domain (Dhalluin et al., 1999Dhalluin C. Carlson J.E. Zeng L. He C. Aggarwal A.K. Zhou M.M. Structure and ligand of a histone acetyltransferase bromodomain.Nature. 1999; 399: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar, Mujtaba et al., 2007Mujtaba S. Zeng L. Zhou M.M. Structure and acetyl-lysine recognition of the bromodomain.Oncogene. 2007; 26: 5521-5527Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), we envisioned that, together with the PHD finger, this bivalent structural element may bind two different classes of histone modifications generally associated with euchromatin and transcription initiation (Guenther et al., 2007Guenther M.G.

Histone H4-K16 acetylation controls chromatin structure and protein interactions.Science. 2006; 311: 844-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (1390) Google Scholar). In support, deletion of both the PHD finger and the adjacent bromodomain rescued BPTF knockdown in Xenopus less efficiently than a PHD finger mutation that completely abolishes H3K4me3 interactions (Wysocka et al., 2006Wysocka J. Swigut T. Xiao H. Milne T.A. Kwon S.Y. Landry J. Kauer M. Tackett A.J. Chait B.T. Badenhorst P. et al.A PHD finger of NURF couples histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation with chromatin remodelling.Nature. 2006; 442: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). To examine the nature of this putative bivalent nucleosomal recognition by the PHD-bromo module (Figure 1A ), we first sought to identify and characterize potential bromodomain binding partners. Using SPOT blotting (Nady et al., 2008Nady N. Min J. Kareta M.S. Chédin F. Arrowsmith C.H. A SPOT on the chromatin landscape? Histone peptide arrays as a tool for epigenetic research.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2008; 33: 305-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), we screened a spatially arrayed library of all known core histone acetylation marks (Basu et al., 2009Basu A. Rose K.L. Zhang J. Beavis R.C. Ueberheide B. Garcia B.A. Chait B. Zhao Y. Hunt D.F. Segal E. et al.Proteome-wide prediction of acetylation substrates.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 13785-13790Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This analysis revealed two acetylation marks that specifically bound recombinant BPTF bromodomain (Figure 1B). Peptides representing histone H4 acetylated lysines 16 and 20 (H4K16ac and H4K20ac) consistently displayed the strongest interaction with the BPTF bromodomain in this assay, whereas the unmodified counterpart displayed no detectable signal above background (Figure 1B and Figure S1C available online). Affinities for these two peptides and set of control peptides were validated by peptide pull-down and then examined more carefully via fluorescence polarization anisotropy (FPA) and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) (Figures 1C–1E). These additional experiments revealed affinity for H4K12ac, perhaps not apparent with SPOT analysis because the array peptide only included three residues N terminal to the K12ac mark. Quantitative binding measurements lend support to the apparent specificity for these three acetylation sites in the H4 tail, whereas other acetylated H4 peptides and unmodified H4 counterparts displayed only weak affinity outside of the experimentally quantifiable range (Figures 1D and 1E and Figures S1E, S1F, S1G, and S1H). These measurements are consistent with the promiscuity and affinity (H4K12ac [Kd, ITC = 69 ± 1 μM], H4K16ac [Kd, ITC = 99 ± 7 μM), and H4K20ac [Kd, ITC = 130 ± 10 μM]) reported for other bromodomains (Dhalluin et al., 1999Dhalluin C.

With a small set of bromodomain binding partners characterized, combined with the well-established PHD finger affinity for H3K4me2/3 (Li et al., 2006Li H. Ilin S. Wang W. Duncan E.M. Wysocka J. Allis C.D. Patel D.J.

Badenhorst P. et al.A PHD finger of NURF couples histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation with chromatin remodelling.Nature. 2006; 442: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar), we sought to examine the properties of bivalent ligand binding by these two linked binding domains. Simultaneous binding of the BPTF PHD-bromo cassette could have two nonexclusive consequences: allosteric cooperativity wherein the binding of a given peptide in one of the two modules may influence the binding of cognate peptide to the other by a conformational shift (Changeux and Edelstein, 2005Changeux J.P. Edelstein S.J. Allosteric mechanisms of signal transduction.Science. 2005; 308: 1424-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar) or a multivalent interaction wherein two coupled entities may bind with greater net affinity and specificity than their discrete constituent binding equilibria, largely as an entropic effect (Krishnamurthy et al., 2006Krishnamurthy V.M. Estroff L.M. Whitesides G.M. Multivalency in Ligand Design.in: Jahnke W. Erlanson D.A. Fragment-based Approaches in Drug Discovery. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim2006: 11-53Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar, Ruthenburg et al., 2007bRuthenburg A.J. Li H. Patel D.J. Allis C.D. Multivalent engagement of chromatin modifications by linked binding modules.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 983-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). We used peptide-level binding experiments with the PHD-bromo module exploiting the heterotypic ligand binding properties of each domain with one ligand at saturating concentration to query for possible allosteric enhancement. For simplicity, we restricted our initial experiments to H4K16ac in combination with H3K4me3. The binding of the PHD-bromo unit to a fluorescein-labeled H3K4me3 peptide was assessed by FPA in the presence of unlabeled H4K16ac peptide at a concentration 5-fold greater than its bromodomain binding Kd. This titration did not reveal any significant displacement of the binding curve relative to similar titrations with excess unmodified H4 peptide or without any H4 peptide (Figure 2A ). Moreover, the reciprocal experiment did not detect cooperativity (Figure 2B). Thus, we conclude that, at the peptide level, each binding event is free from detectable allostery. If the binding of both peptides is effectively bimolecular, as might be anticipated for the BPTF PHD-bromodomain engaging both marks within a nucleosome, a free energy enhancement in binding might occur due to multivalency (Krishnamurthy et al., 2006Krishnamurthy V.M. Estroff L.M. Whitesides G.M. Multivalency in Ligand Design.in: Jahnke W. Erlanson D.A. Fragment-based Approaches in Drug Discovery. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim2006: 11-53Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar, Ruthenburg et al., 2007bRuthenburg A.J. Li H. Patel D.J. Allis C.D. Multivalent engagement of chromatin modifications by linked binding modules.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 983-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). To test this possibility, we developed a novel biophysical assay with histone peptides attached to a rigid DNA duplex to assess the spatial requirements of cooperative and simultaneous histone tail binding. When the spacing between these two short peptides along one face of the B form DNA duplex is ∼71 Å (Figure S2A ), marked enhancement of PHD-bromodomain binding affinity is observed, relative to DNA-peptide conjugates bearing each single peptide annealed to an unmodified complementary DNA strand (Figure 2C). Given the distance spanned by the two peptide-binding pockets (∼70 Å), this result suggests simultaneous binding by both modules. That the H3K4me3 peptide-duplex conjugate displayed little binding affinity was unexpected because the Kd for the PHD finger binding this peptide is ∼100-fold tighter than that of the bromodomain binding H4K16ac (Li et al., 2006Li H. Ilin S. Wang W. Duncan E.M. Wysocka J. Allis C.D. Patel D.J. Molecular basis for site-specific read-out of histone H3K4me3 by the BPTF PHD finger of NURF.Nature. 2006; 442: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Our interpretation of this result is that the H3K4me3 peptide is sufficiently short such that the PHD finger incurs steric or electrostatic repulsion from the DNA conjugate upon binding, supported by the observation that this short peptide is bound effectively in the absence of DNA (Figure S2D). Remarkably, this impairment of PHD finger binding can be partially overcome by distal binding of the bromodomain to the same DNA ruler duplex. Encouraged that simultaneous binding of the PHD-bromodomain modules may provide an affinity enhancement, we sought to study these multivalent interactions on a more physiologically relevant substrate, the nucleosome. To assess the consequences of bivalent nucleosome engagement, we sought to construct nucleosomes bearing the desired combinations of posttranslational modifications. To this end, we employed a histone semisynthesis approach of expressed protein ligation (EPL) (Muir, 2003Muir T.W. Semisynthesis of proteins by expressed protein ligation.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 249-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, Shogren-Knaak and Peterson, 2004Shogren-Knaak M.A. Peterson C.L. Creating designer histones by native chemical ligation.Methods Enzymol. 2004; 375: 62-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) to afford homogenously modified histones that could be reconstituted with recombinant human core histones into octamers and then mononucleosomes on a strong positioning sequence (Figure S3 and Figure S4). GST-tagged BPTF PHD-bromodomain was immobilized on a glutathione resin and interrogated for binding to these radiolabeled mononucleosomes. A 2- to 3-fold enhancement of nucleosomal binding affinity was reproducibly observed for nucleosomes bearing both H4K4me3 and H4K16ac over mononucleosomes with only H3K4me3, whereas no binding was observed for the corresponding unmodified species (Figure 3A ). Importantly, there was little detectable binding in this assay for nucleosomes acetylated only at H4K16—as might be anticipated from the ∼100-fold Kd difference of the two discrete interactions extrapolated to an off-rate dominated binding measurement. To exclude GST-tag dimerization artifacts and surface effects, we performed a reciprocal experiment wherein nucleosomes are immobilized to a solid support and protein without the GST-tag is queried for nucleosome interaction by pull-down. The results are similar (Figure 3B and Figures S3K and S3L). We interpret the enhanced binding of doubly modified mononucleosomes to suggest that both marks may play a role in nucleosome-level binding, yet the PHD-H3K4me3 interaction is dominant.Figure S4Characterization of the EPL Produced Histones, Octamers, and Nucleosomes, Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A) ESI Mass spectrometry of H4K12ac purified ligation product.

Here, x-ray tomography of the Early Jurassic mammaliaforms Morganucodon and Hadrocodium sheds light on this history. We found that relative brain size expanded to mammalian levels, with enlarged olfactory bulbs, neocortex, olfactory (pyriform) cortex, and cerebellum, in two evolutionary pulses. The initial pulse was probably driven by increased resolution in olfaction and improvements in tactile sensitivity (from body hair) and neuromuscular coordination. A second pulse of olfactory enhancement then enlarged the brain to mammalian levels. The origin of crown Mammalia saw a third pulse of olfactory enhancement, with ossified ethmoid turbinals supporting an expansive olfactory epithelium in the nasal cavity, allowing full expression of a huge odorant receptor genome."

Signifying a disruption of these programs, expression profiling has revealed extensive miRNA dysregulation in tumors compared with healthy tissue.

However, the effects of the miR-200 family on transformation of normal mammary epithelial cells have yet to be fully characterized. By examining a TGF-β driven model of transformation of normal mammary epithelium, we demonstrate that the class III histone deacetylase silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1), a proposed oncogene in breast cancer, is overexpressed upon EMT-like transformation and that epigenetic silencing of miR-200a contributes at least in part to the overexpression of SIRT1. We have established the SIRT1 transcript as subject to regulation by miR-200a, through miR-200a targeting of SIRT1 3′-UTR. We also observed SIRT1 and miR-200a participation in a negative feedback regulatory loop. Restoration of miR-200a or the knockdown of SIRT1 prevented transformation of normal mammary epithelial cells evidenced by decreased anchorage-independent growth and decreased cell migration. Finally, we observed SIRT1 overexpression in association with decreased miR-200a in breast cancer patient samples. These observations provide further evidence for a critical tumor suppressive role of the miR-200 family in breast epithelium in addition to identifying a novel regulatory mechanism, which may contribute to SIRT1 up-regulation in breast cancer.

However, gene-editing methodologies described to date for human cells suffer from technical limitations including limited target gene size, low targeting efficiency at transcriptionally inactive loci, and off-target genetic effects that could hamper broad clinical application. To address these limitations, and as a proof of principle, we focused on homologous recombination-based gene correction of multiple mutations on lamin A (LMNA), which are associated with various degenerative diseases.

However, despite numerous efforts and recent advancements, major problems remain unresolved. First, the classical nonviral vectors and delivery approaches are associated with low efficiency of gene targeting in human pluripotent stem cells, especially for transcriptionally silenced genomic loci (Goulburn et al., 2011Goulburn A.L.

Second, the current technologies introduce DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) (Arnould et al., 2011Arnould S. Delenda C. Grizot S. Desseaux C. Pâques F. Silva G.H. Smith J.

Accordingly, the potential for off-target effects leading to unexpected mutations and chromosomal aberrations might not be acceptable for therapeutic applications. Moreover, for genes bearing mutational “hot spots” (Worman et al., 2010Worman H.J. Ostlund C. Wang Y. Diseases of the nuclear envelope.Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol. 2010; 2: a000760Crossref Scopus (165) Google Scholar), efficient tools targeting multiple sites spanning a large DNA sequence still need to be developed. In the present work we sought to address some of these issues by taking advantage of a recently established LMNA-based iPSC model of disease (Liu et al., 2011Liu G.H. Barkho B.Z. Ruiz S. Diep D. Qu J. Yang S.L. Panopoulos A.D. Suzuki K. Kurian L. Walsh C. et al.Recapitulation of premature ageing with iPSCs from Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome.Nature. 2011; 472: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). LMNA is a known transcriptionally inactive locus in pluripotent cells. Importantly, more than 400 different mutations of LMNA have been reported, with additional mutations continuously being discovered (Zaremba-Czogalla et al., 2011Zaremba-Czogalla M. Dubińska-Magiera M. Rzepecki R. Laminopathies: the molecular background of the disease and the prospects for its treatment.Cell. Mol. Biol. Lett. 2011; 16: 114-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, LMNA represents an ideal candidate locus for the study of hot-spot gene correction of silenced genes by using single vectors targeting large genomic regions. LMNA encodes lamin A, an architectural component of nuclear lamina in somatic cells indispensable for nuclear integrity (Dechat et al., 2008Dechat T. Pfleghaar K. Sengupta K. Shimi T. Shumaker D.K. Solimando L. Goldman R.D. Nuclear lamins: Major factors in the structural organization and function of the nucleus and chromatin.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 832-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Mutations on lamin A are associated with disruption of the nuclear structure, aberrant cellular function, and disease development, defining a group of human degenerative diseases referred to as laminopathies (Burke et al., 2001Burke B. Mounkes L.C. Stewart C.L. The nuclear envelope in muscular dystrophy and cardiovascular diseases.Traffic. 2001; 2: 675-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, Worman et al., 2010Worman H.J. Ostlund C. Wang Y. Diseases of the nuclear envelope.Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol. 2010; 2: a000760Crossref Scopus (165) Google Scholar, Zaremba-Czogalla et al., 2011Zaremba-Czogalla M. Dubińska-Magiera M. Rzepecki R. Laminopathies: the molecular background of the disease and the prospects for its treatment.Cell. Mol. Biol. Lett. 2011; 16: 114-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). One of the best-known laminopathies is Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS or progeria), a premature aging disorder associated with the presence of a specific mutation of the LMNA gene. Such mutation results in a truncated mRNA encoding the mutant protein progerin (Burtner and Kennedy, 2010Burtner C.R. Kennedy B.K. Progeria syndromes and ageing: What is the connection?.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 567-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Progerin plays a dominant role in the nucleus and its accumulation can result in a number of different nuclear defects, accelerated aging, and cellular senescence (Dechat et al., 2008Dechat T. Pfleghaar K. Sengupta K. Shimi T. Shumaker D.K. Solimando L. Goldman R.D. Nuclear lamins: Major factors in the structural organization and function of the nucleus and chromatin.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 832-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, Scaffidi and Misteli, 2005Scaffidi P. Misteli T. Reversal of the cellular phenotype in the premature aging disease Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome.Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 440-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Recently we and others have reported the generation of iPSCs (HGPS-iPSCs) from HGPS patient fibroblasts (Liu et al., 2011Liu G.H. Barkho B.Z. Ruiz S. Diep D. Qu J. Yang S.L. Panopoulos A.D. Suzuki K. Kurian L. Walsh C. et al.Recapitulation of premature ageing with iPSCs from Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome.Nature. 2011; 472: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, Zhang et al., 2011Zhang J. Lian Q. Zhu G. Zhou F. Sui L. Tan C. Mutalif R.A. Navasankari R. Zhang Y. Tse H.F. et al.A human iPSC model of Hutchinson Gilford Progeria reveals vascular smooth muscle and mesenchymal stem cell defects.Cell Stem Cell. 2011; 8: 31-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Here we report the establishment of an efficient and highly specific method for correction of a number of LMNA mutations. Indeed, the use of a single helper-dependent adenoviral vector (HDAdV) was sufficient for the correction of different mutations spanning a substantially large region of the LMNA gene. Targeted correction of LMNA led to the restored expression of wild-type lamin A and to the abolishment of progerin expression. Consequently, lack of progerin expression resulted in the correction of the disease-associated cellular phenotypes, including decelerated senescence and restoration of normal nuclear morphology. Furthermore, the use of HDAdV-based approaches demonstrated very high efficiencies in the absence of any observed genetic and epigenetic abnormality and led to indistinguishable cell genetic backgrounds before and after gene targeting. Thus, the method described here might represent a more efficient and safer alternative to other current technologies. Along the same line, HDAdV-based approaches can be used for the generation of genetically matched iPSCs serving as a more reliable control for disease modeling and drug discovery. Lastly, our methodologies demonstrate the use of HDAdV-based gene targeting as a reliable tool for the engineering of adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Of the 12 exons of the LMNA gene, exons 2 to 12 cluster closely together. This region covers around 80% of the whole LMNA coding sequence and accumulates up to 246 of the published mutations in the LMNA gene (http://www.umd.be/LMNA/). With the aim to develop a single method amenable for the correction of multiple LMNA mutations, we engineered a HDAd-based gene-correction vector (LMNA-c-HDAdV) (Figure 1A ). HDAdV has been proven to mediate efficient and precise gene editing in hESCs without the requirement for artificial DNA DSBs (Suzuki et al., 2008Suzuki K. Mitsui K. Aizawa E. Hasegawa K. Kawase E. Yamagishi T. Shimizu Y. Suemori H. Nakatsuji N. Mitani K. Highly efficient transient gene expression and gene targeting in primate embryonic stem cells with helper-dependent adenoviral vectors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 13781-13786Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Because of the complete removal of viral genes from the vector, HDAdVs show low cytotoxicity while displaying the major advantage of having a large cloning capacity (∼37 kb). Thus, HDAdVs permit the insertion of long homologous DNA regions that are designed to facilitate targeted integration via homologous recombination (HR) (Suzuki et al., 2008Suzuki K. Mitsui K. Aizawa E. Hasegawa K. Kawase E. Yamagishi T. Shimizu Y. Suemori H. Nakatsuji N. Mitani K. Highly efficient transient gene expression and gene targeting in primate embryonic stem cells with helper-dependent adenoviral vectors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 13781-13786Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In view of these advantages, we first evaluated the ability of LMNA-c-HDAdV to correct the HGPS-associated LMNA mutation C1824T in exon 11 in HGPS-iPSCs. We initially tested various viral infection conditions as well as different multiplicities of infection (MOIs). The system here employed includes a negative selection step by ganciclovir (GANC) resistance. If the vector randomly integrates into the genome, the integrated DNA will still include an HSVtk cassette leading to cell death by GANC selection. On the other hand, if the vector integrates at the targeted site by HR, the HSVtk cassette is removed and the cell displays GANC resistance (Mansour et al., 1988Mansour S.L. Thomas K.R. Capecchi M.R. Disruption of the proto-oncogene int-2 in mouse embryo-derived stem cells: A general strategy for targeting mutations to non-selectable genes.Nature. 1988; 336: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar). Thus, negative selection helps to minimize ectopic vector integration (Suzuki et al., 2008Suzuki K. Mitsui K. Aizawa E. Hasegawa K. Kawase E. Yamagishi T. Shimizu Y. Suemori H. Nakatsuji N. Mitani K. Highly efficient transient gene expression and gene targeting in primate embryonic stem cells with helper-dependent adenoviral vectors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 13781-13786Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Accordingly, after sequential positive (G418) and negative (GANC) selection (Mansour et al., 1988Mansour S.L. Thomas K.R. Capecchi M.R. Disruption of the proto-oncogene int-2 in mouse embryo-derived stem cells: A general strategy for targeting mutations to non-selectable genes.Nature. 1988; 336: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar), double-resistant colonies were expanded and maintained in hESC medium (Figure 1B). Effective gene targeting at the LMNA loci in drug-resistant clones was verified by PCR and Southern blot (Figures 1C–1E; Figure S1A available online). We speculated that because of the transcriptional inactivation of the LMNA locus in HGPS-iPSCs (Liu et al., 2011Liu G.H. Barkho B.Z. Ruiz S. Diep D. Qu J. Yang S.L. Panopoulos A.D. Suzuki K.

Surprisingly, efficient gene targeting of LMNA (78%–100%) was consistently obtained even with the lowest MOI used (Figure 1C). These results indicate that high-targeting efficiency might saturate the system, allowing for reduced number of viral particles. We arbitrarily selected the iPSC colonies that were infected as single cells with the lowest viral titer (MOI = 3) for further analysis. Since most laminopathy-associated mutations are heterozygous, we expected gene-correction efficiencies to be 50% of the total frequency of gene-targeting events. Accordingly, DNA sequencing showed that mutations in 46% of the drug-resistant colonies were successfully corrected (Figures 1C and 1F). In order to achieve genomic integrity in the corrected clones, we next excised the neomycin-resistant gene cassette, flanked by FRT sites, by transient expression of FLPe recombinase (Figure S1B). The neo-removed corrected HGPS-iPSC lines (hereafter referred to “cHGPS-iPSCs”) showed a normal karyotype, expressed pluripotent markers, and exhibited demethylation of the OCT4 promoter and pluripotency (Figures S1C–S1I; Movie S1). Genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping demonstrated that the genetic background of the cHGPS-iPSCs was the same as the parental HGPS fibroblasts, but distinct from H9 hESCs and the control BJ-iPSCs (Figure 2A ; Table S1). By copy number variation (CNV) of the SNP genotyping data, using the method described in Laurent et al. (2011)Laurent L.C. Ulitsky I. Slavin I. Tran H. Schork A. Morey R. Lynch C. Harness J.V. Lee S.

Although this result may appear to be at variance with a recent report by Hussein et al., 2011Hussein S.M. Batada N.N. Vuoristo S. Ching R.W. Autio R. Närvä E. Ng S. Sourour M. Hämäläinen R. Olsson C. et al.Copy number variation and selection during reprogramming to pluripotency.Nature. 2011; 471: 58-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, there were significant differences between the samples analyzed. Hussein et al., 2011Hussein S.M. Batada N.N. Vuoristo S. Ching R.W. Autio R. Närvä E. Ng S. Sourour M. Hämäläinen R. Olsson C. et al.Copy number variation and selection during reprogramming to pluripotency.Nature. 2011; 471: 58-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar reported a higher frequency of CNVs in very early passage (<10 passages) when compared to later-passage iPSCs and postulated that these CNVs occurred during the process of reprogramming and were negatively selected in culture. Thus, because our gene targeting experiments started with HGPS-iPSCs at passage 30, our corrected iPSCs (>passage 30) clearly surpassed that early window of high-frequency CNV. Both SNP arrays used in the two studies assayed ∼1 million SNPs, and the analyses required consistent calls for a minimum of ten adjacent markers to identify a CNV; therefore the controversies observed between Hussein's and our own results were not due to technical but to passage number differences. DNA microarray analysis revealed very similar expression profiles between cHGPS-iPSCs and their parental HGPS-iPSCs (Figure 2C), indicating that the targeting procedure did not alter global gene expression. To examine whether the gene-targeting procedure interfered with the global epigenetic state, we performed genome-wide DNA methylation analysis. An average of 12 million single-end 80 bp sequencing reads was generated for each sample, yielding an average read depth of >50× for all CpG sites called, which is roughly twice as high as the published whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data (Lister et al., 2011Lister R. Pelizzola M. Kida Y.S. Hawkins R.D. Nery J.R. Hon G. Antosiewicz-Bourget J. O'Malley R. Castanon R. Klugman S. et al.Hotspots of aberrant epigenomic reprogramming in human induced pluripotent stem cells.Nature. 2011; 471: 68-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar). The methylation levels measured on the Watson strand and the Crick strand were highly consistent for the same CpG sites (Pearson correlation coefficient r = 0.965 for site with read depth ≥ 10), indicating that the methylation measurements were very accurate. As shown in Figure 2D, the cHGPS-iPSCs showed a highly similar methylation profile as its parental iPSCs, in contrast to hESCs and wild-type iPSCs. Thus, our gene correction approach effectively maintained genetic and epigenetic cell integrity. To ascertain whether correction of the mutant LMNA in HGPS-iPSCs is able to prevent development of some of the disease-associated phenotypes, we differentiated the cHGPS-iPSCs into vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and fibroblasts, two known HGPS-affected cell types (Liu et al., 2011Liu G.H. Barkho B.Z. Ruiz S. Diep D. Qu J. Yang S.L. Panopoulos A.D. Suzuki K. Kurian L.

Immunoblotting and RT-PCR analysis did not detect progerin mRNA or protein in cHGPS-iPSCs-derived cells (Figures 2E–2G). These results correlated with a significant rescue of the senescence phenotype. Senescence-associated (SA)-β-gal staining was reduced from 21.3% in SMCs differentiated from the noncorrected HGPS-iPSCs to 6.8% in cHGPS-iPSCs-derived SMCs, compared to 11.4% observed in BJ-iPSC-derived SMCs (Figure 2H). In addition, cHGPS-iPSCs-derived fibroblasts showed more than 60% reduction in the number of abnormal nuclei as compared to noncorrected counterparts (Figure 2I). Altogether, our results show that genetic correction of HGPS-iPSCs completely abrogated expression of progerin and resulted in expression of wild-type lamin A, thus leading to restored nuclear architecture and a normal cell senescence program. Considering the large DNA-carrying capacity of our generated LMNA-c-HDAdV, we next decided to examine whether the same approach could be used to correct other LMNA mutations. We generated iPSCs from a patient with atypical Werner syndrome (AWS), a milder premature aging disease caused by a different LMNA mutation (A1733T in exon 11, E578V) (Csoka et al., 2004Csoka A.B. Cao H. Sammak P.J. Constantinescu D. Schatten G.P. Hegele R.A. Novel lamin A/C gene (LMNA) mutations in atypical progeroid syndromes.J. Med. Genet. 2004; 41: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). AWS-iPSCs demonstrated acquisition of the typical iPSC characteristics including expression of pluripotency markers, ability to differentiate in vitro, formation of teratomas, and pluripotent gene expression and DNA methylation signatures (Figures 2C, 2D, 3A, and 3B ; Figure S1G). In addition, AWS-iPSCs showed a normal karyotype and carried the disease-specific LMNA mutation (Figure 3F; Figure S1C). By employing the same approach used for the correction of HGPS-iPSCs, we obtained gene-targeting efficiencies ranging from 89% to 100% and specific gene correction of up to 35% (Figures 3C–3F; Figure S1J). The corrected AWS-iPSCs (cAWS-iPSCs) expressed pluripotent markers and showed a normal karyotype as well as a highly similar DNA methylation and gene expression profile as their parental AWS-iPSCs (Figures 2C and 2D; Figure S1C and S1E). These observations highlight the possibility of using a single LMNA-c-HDAdV vector for the correction of multiple mutations of the LMNA gene and thus for the treatment of different laminopathies. We next sought to determine the maximal region that LMNA-c-HDAdV covers. To this end, we sequenced the whole LMNA locus in HGPS- and AWS-iPSCs looking for specific SNP sites across the LMNA locus that are not present in the vector. Two AWS-specific SNP sites located downstream of exon 12 were found on the same chromosome as the AWS mutation in the noncorrected cells and were used as a read-out for our analysis (Figure 3G). These two SNP sites are located 3.3 and 4.4 kb downstream of the neo-insertion site, respectively. By examining the presence of these two SNPs in the corrected AWS-iPSCs, we found that both of them were effectively replaced by the wild-type LMNA-c-HDAdV sequence (60% of the gene-corrected clones) (Figure 3H), indicating that the majority of HR events occur outside of the second SNP site. Since exons 3–12 are also located within the 4.4 kb region from neo-insertion site (Figure 3I), our results suggest that LMNA-c-HDAdV can at least replace the whole exon 3–12 region. Thus, our method could potentially be used to correct more than 200 different mutations described in the LMNA locus. Finally, we evaluated the possibility of using HDAd-based vectors for gene editing in human adult stem cells. We focused on mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) because of their current and extensive use in regenerative medicine (Salem and Thiemermann, 2010Salem H.K. Thiemermann C. Mesenchymal stromal cells: Current understanding and clinical status.Stem Cells. 2010; 28: 585-596PubMed Google Scholar). LMNA mutations mainly affect mesoderm-derived tissues, such as muscle and adipocytes. Thus, LMNA correction on MSCs could represent an attractive alternative for therapeutic purposes (Zaremba-Czogalla et al., 2011Zaremba-Czogalla M. Dubińska-Magiera M. Rzepecki R. Laminopathies: the molecular background of the disease and the prospects for its treatment.Cell. Mol. Biol. Lett. 2011; 16: 114-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Because of their high cell-cycle kinetics which enables effective clonal expansion, we specifically focused on olfactory ectomesenchymal stem cells (OE-MSCs) (Delorme et al., 2010Delorme B. Nivet E. Gaillard J. Häupl T. Ringe J. Devèze A. Magnan J. Sohier J. Khrestchatisky M. Roman F.S. et al.The human nose harbors a niche of olfactory ectomesenchymal stem cells displaying neurogenic and osteogenic properties.Stem Cells Dev. 2010; 19: 853-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Furthermore, OE-MSCs are easily accessible by noninvasive biopsies and therefore represent an attractive cell population for clinical applications (Delorme et al., 2010Delorme B. Nivet E. Gaillard J. Häupl T. Ringe J. Devèze A. Magnan J. Sohier J. Khrestchatisky M. Roman F.S. et al.The human nose harbors a niche of olfactory ectomesenchymal stem cells displaying neurogenic and osteogenic properties.Stem Cells Dev. 2010; 19: 853-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 3J and Figures S1K and S1L, LMNA-c-HDAdV demonstrated gene-editing efficiency of 54% in wild-type OE-MSCs, without disruption of the normal lamin A/C expression. Although OE-MSCs from patients with laminopathies are not available at this stage, our study suggests in particular the possibility that LMNA-c-HDAdV could be used to genetically modify laminopathy-specific MSCs in the future, and more generally, the feasibility of targeting adult stem cells for gene correction. In summary, we report the successful correction of different laminopathy-associated LMNA mutations in patient-specific iPSCs with a single gene correction vector. Moreover, HDAdV-based approaches efficiently target specific genomic loci on adult stem cells, a scenario not previously addressed. Our results demonstrate that the long homology arms used in HDAdVs have the capability to edit the targeted genomic locus without off-target effects and/or introduction of additional mutations, thus presenting an advantageous alternative to the use of other gene-editing technologies (Hockemeyer et al., 2009Hockemeyer D. Soldner F. Beard C. Gao Q. Mitalipova M. DeKelver R.C. Katibah G.E. Amora R. Boydston E.A. Zeitler B. et al.Efficient targeting of expressed and silent genes in human ESCs and iPSCs using zinc-finger nucleases.Nat. Biotechnol. 2009; 27: 851-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). Although bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-mediated vectors also used long homology arms, their ability and efficiency to target the genome was restricted to transcriptionally active loci (Howden et al., 2011Howden S.E. Gore A. Li Z. Fung H.L. Nisler B.S. Nie J. Chen G. McIntosh B.E. Gulbranson D.R. Diol N.R. et al.Genetic correction and analysis of induced pluripotent stem cells from a patient with gyrate atrophy.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Modeling disease in human ESCs using an efficient BAC-based homologous recombination system.Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 6: 80-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Here we show that LMNA-c-HDAdV can specifically edit transcriptionally inactive loci with high efficiencies. Thus, the HDAdV represents a robust and versatile tool that could be applied toward the correction of multiple monogenic diseases. Finally, this approach could serve to generate appropriate genotype-matched iPSC lines in disease modeling and drug discovery studies. LMNA-c-HDAdV was generated with a BAC clone, containing the human LMNA loci (RP11-54H19, BACPAC resources), that were modified with BAC recombineering (Datsenko and Wanner, 2000Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. One-step inactivation of chromosomal genes in Escherichia coli K-12 using PCR products.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (10261) Google Scholar). In brief, the FRT-PGK-EM7-neo-bpA-FRT fragment was recombined into intron 10 of LMNA in the BAC clone. A total of 23.2 kb of LMNA homology, including the marker cassette, was subcloned into the HDAdV plasmid pAMHDAdGT8-4 (kindly provided by Dr. Kohnosuke Mitani). The generated LMNA-c-HDAdV was linearized by PmeI and then transfected into 116 cells (kindly provided by Dr. Philip Ng) in the presence of helper virus AdHPBGF35 (kindly provided by Dr. André M. Lieber) (Shayakhmetov et al., 2004Shayakhmetov D.M. Li Z.Y. Gaggar A. Gharwan H. Ternovoi V. Sandig V. Lieber A.

Virol. 2004; 78: 10009-10022Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Crude virus extracts were serially amplified in 116 cells and then purified according to the method previously described (Palmer and Ng, 2004Palmer D.J. Ng P. Physical and infectious titers of helper-dependent adenoviral vectors: a method of direct comparison to the adenovirus reference material.Mol. Ther. 2004; 10: 792-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). β-gal-transducing units (btu) were determined in 293 cells to define infectious vector titers. 4% formaldehyde in PBS was used to fix cells at room temperature (RT) for 20–30 min. After fixation, cells were exposed to 0.4% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at RT. Cells were blocked with 10% FBS in PBS for 30 min and incubated with primary antibody for 1 hr at RT or overnight at 4°C. Washing was conducted with PBS followed by incubation with a corresponding secondary antibody for 1 hr at RT. Hoechst 33342 or DAPI was used to stain nuclei. To test pluripotency in vivo, iPSC lines were injected into NOD-SCID IL2Rgammanull mice (Jackson Laboratories) and teratoma formation was assessed. In short, ∼106 iPSCs in ∼50 μl of hESC medium were injected into the kidney capsule or testis of anesthetized mice. Teratoma formation was monitored and animals were sacrificed ∼6–12 weeks after injection. Harvested teratomas were processed and analyzed by immunostaining and hematoxylin-eosin staining. All murine experiments were conducted with approval of The Salk Institute Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Results are presented as mean ± SD.

https://openalex.org/W1971273349,"Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are widely used to treat patients with leukaemia driven by BCR-ABL1 (ref. 1) and other oncogenic tyrosine kinases. Recent efforts have focused on developing more potent TKIs that also inhibit mutant tyrosine kinases. However, even effective TKIs typically fail to eradicate leukaemia-initiating cells (LICs), which often cause recurrence of leukaemia after initially successful treatment. Here we report the discovery of a novel mechanism of drug resistance, which is based on protective feedback signalling of leukaemia cells in response to treatment with TKI. We identify BCL6 as a central component of this drug-resistance pathway and demonstrate that targeted inhibition of BCL6 leads to eradication of drug-resistant and leukaemia-initiating subclones."

The blood group antigen-binding adhesin BabA mediates the adherence of H. pylori to ABO/Lewis b (Le(b)) blood group antigens in the gastric pit region of the human stomach mucosa. Here, we show both in vitro and in vivo that BabA-mediated binding of H. pylori to Le(b) on the epithelial surface augments TFSS-dependent H. pylori pathogenicity by triggering the production of proinflammatory cytokines and precancer-related factors. We successfully generated Le(b)-positive cell lineages by transfecting Le(b)-negative cells with several glycosyltransferase genes. Using these established cell lines, we found increased mRNA levels of proinflammatory cytokines (CCL5 and IL-8) as well as precancer-related factors (CDX2 and MUC2) after the infection of Le(b)-positive cells with WT H. pylori but not with babA or TFSS deletion mutants. This increased mRNA expression was abrogated when Le(b)-negative cells were infected with WT H. pylori. Thus, H. pylori can exploit BabA-Le(b) binding to trigger TFSS-dependent host cell signaling to induce the transcription of genes that enhance inflammation, development of intestinal metaplasia, and associated precancerous transformations."
https://openalex.org/W2043725345,"Iron deficiency is one of the major agricultural problems, as 30% of the arable land of the world is too alkaline for optimal crop production, rendering plants short of available iron despite its abundance. To take up apoplasmic precipitated iron, plants secrete phenolics such as protocatechuic acid (PCA) and caffeic acid. The molecular pathways and genes of iron uptake strategies are already characterized, whereas the molecular mechanisms of phenolics synthesis and secretion have not been clarified, and no phenolics efflux transporters have been identified in plants yet.Here we describe the identification of a phenolics efflux transporter in rice. We identified a cadmium-accumulating rice mutant in which the amount of PCA and caffeic acid in the xylem sap was dramatically reduced and hence named it phenolics efflux zero 1 (pez1). PEZ1 localized to the plasma membrane and transported PCA when expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. PEZ1 localized mainly in the stele of roots. In the roots of pez1, precipitated apoplasmic iron increased. The growth of PEZ1 overexpression lines was severely restricted, and these lines accumulated more iron as a result of the high solubilization of precipitated apoplasmic iron in the stele. We show that PEZ1 is responsible for an increase of PCA concentration in the xylem sap and is essential for the utilization of apoplasmic precipitated iron in the stele.

Increasing crop production is an important strategy to meet the increased demand for food resulting from the rapid population increase (1Tester M. Langridge P. Science. 2010; 327: 818-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (1552) Google Scholar). Agricultural productivity is severely affected by high soil pH, causing metal ions, especially iron (Fe), to become sparingly soluble and not available to plants (2Marschner H. Mineral Nutrition of Higher Plants. Academic Press, 1995: 313-324Crossref Google Scholar). Plants growing in high-pH soils develop Fe deficiency symptoms that are manifested as chlorosis (yellowing from partial failure to develop and stabilize chlorophyll), even though mineral soils contain >6% Fe (3Guerinot M.L. Yi Y. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 815-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). To take up apoplasmic precipitated Fe, non-graminaceous plants use Strategy I. They release protons, secrete phenolics, reduce Fe(III), and finally take up Fe(II) (4Römheld V. Marschner H. Plant Physiol. 1983; 71: 949-954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Jeong J. Guerinot M.L.

Plant Soil. 2010; 329: 1-25Crossref Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Protons are released via H+-ATPases to increase the solubility of Fe from the root plasma membrane. After solubilization, Fe(III) is reduced to Fe(II) by a membrane-bound Fe(III) reductase oxidase. Then Fe(II) is transported into the root by an iron-regulated transporter (IRT1). 3The abbreviations used are: IRTiron-regulated transporterPCAprotocatechuic acidGUSβ-glucuronidaseCAcaffeic acidOsIRTOryza sativa IRTT-DNAtransfer DNA. On the other hand, graminaceous plants take up Fe using the Strategy II system, which relies on a Fe(III) chelation system through the secretion of mugineic acid family phytosiderophores (4Römheld V.

These mugineic acids are secreted to the rhizosphere to chelate Fe(III), and the resulting complex is transported by the Yellow Stripe family transporters (5Jeong J. Guerinot M.L.

Besides using Strategy II, rice plants possess a direct ferrous Fe uptake system that uses the ferrous Fe transporter OsIRT1 but does not include functional Fe(III) chelate reductases (8Ishimaru Y.

In plants, Fe uptake from the apoplasm is well documented at the molecular level, with the exception of phenolics synthesis and efflux.

You G.Y. He Y.F. Tang C. Wu P. Zheng S.J. Plant Physiol. 2007; 144: 278-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Moreover, phenolics such as PCA are reported to chelate Fe(III), and solubilizing and reducing it to Fe(II) in vitro (10Yoshino M. Murakami K. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 257: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In this manner, phenolics can play a significant role for Fe solubilization, and understanding the molecular mechanism of phenolics efflux transport is crucial for developing strategies to reduce Fe deficiency. Here we show that a rice phenolic efflux transporter controls the concentration of PCA in the xylem sap and is essential for the utilization of apoplasmic precipitated Fe in stele. For the analysis of knockout or knockdown mutants, Oryza sativa cv. Hwayoung was grown in a 20-liter plastic container containing a nutrient solution of the following composition: 0.7 mm K2SO4, 0.1 mm KCl, 0.1 mm KH2PO4, 2.0 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.5 mm MgSO4, 10 μm H3BO3, 0.5 μm MnSO4, 0.2 μm CuSO4, 0.5 μm ZnSO4, 0.05 μm Na2MoO4, and 0.1 mm Fe-EDTA. The pH of the nutrient solution was adjusted daily to 5.5 with 1 m HCl (11Ishimaru Y. Suzuki M. Kobayashi T. Takahashi M. Nakanishi. H. Mori S. Nishizawa N.K. J. Exp. Bot. 2005; 56: 3207-3214Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). For cadmium (Cd) treatments, 4-week-old plants were transferred to a nutrient solution as described above with 10 μm Cd (CdCl2) and grown for 3 days. Seeds from overexpression lines were grown in a pot in a glasshouse under natural light conditions (12Ishimaru Y. Kim S. Tsukamoto T. Oki H. Kobayashi T. Watanabe S. Matsuhashi S. Takahashi M. Nakanishi H. Mori S. Nishizawa N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 7373-7378Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). For Fe deficiency experiments, 4-week-old plants were grown with or without 100 μm Fe for 1 week. In the excess Fe experiment, overexpression lines were grown on Fe-deficient Murashige and Skoog (MS) media for 2 weeks and then transferred to the media containing 1.0 mm Fe-EDTA for 1 week. For calcareous soil experiment, seeds from overexpression lines were grown under Fe-deficient conditions for a week, transferred to a pot containing 900 g of calcareous soil, and grown in a glasshouse under natural light conditions (12Ishimaru Y. Kim S. Tsukamoto T. Oki H. Kobayashi T. Watanabe S. Matsuhashi S. Takahashi M. Nakanishi H. Mori S. Nishizawa N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 7373-7378Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The PEZ1 internal primers 5′-GAAGCAAAAACTGAATCGGAAAA-3′ and 5′-GAGAGGAGGAGAGGCAGAGAGA-3′, located outside the transfer DNA (T-DNA) integration site, were used to confirm the T-DNA integration site and homozygous status of pez1-1. For pez1-2, the PEZ1 internal primers 5′-TTGTTTATCTCGTGTGCTCGTGT-3′ and 5′-GTGGCCCTCAGTGTTATGTTTG-3′ were used. The α-tubulin primers used for PCR were as follows: α-tubulin forward, 5′-TCTTCCACCCTGAGCAGCTC-3′ and α-tubulin reverse, 5′-AACCTTGGAGACCAGTGCAG-3′. PCR was performed with polymerase KOD plus (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). The annealing temperature was set to 66 °C for all PCR reactions. The full-length rice cDNA clone (1563 bp) of PEZ1 (Os03t0571900-01) was acquired from the rice full-length cDNA database Knowledge-based Oryza Molecular biological Encyclopedia (KOME), subcloned into pENTR/D-TOPO using the pENTRtm/D-TOPO® cloning kit (Invitrogen), and the sequence was confirmed. The information on the genomic structure of this clone was collected from the rice annotation project database (RAP-DB). Total RNA was isolated from pez1-1, pez1-2, and WT plants grown with or without Cd. Total RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase I (Takara Bio, Otsu, Japan) to remove contaminating genomic DNA. First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of RNA using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Toyobo) by priming with oligo-d(T)30, the final volume was adjusted to 100 μl, and 2 μl from each sample was used for subsequent reactions. Fragments were amplified by PCR in a SmartCycler (Takara Bio) with SYBR Green I and ExTaqtm real-time PCR version (Takara Bio). The PEZ1 primers used for RT-PCR were as follows: PEZ1 forward, 5′-GCTGTCGTTCTTTCTGTCGGTGGTAATCTC-3′ and PEZ1 reverse, 5′-CCCATTTCTTCTAGGCATGTAGGCTCTCAG-3′. For PEZ1 RT-PCR, the annealing temperature was set to 65 °C (20 s). The α-tubulin primers used for RT-PCR were as follows: α-tubulin forward, 5′-TCTTCCACCCTGAGCAGCTC-3′ and α-tubulin reverse, 5′-AACCTTGGAGACCAGTGCAG-3′. PCR was performed at an annealing temperature of 55 °C (30 s). The size and specificity of the amplified fragments were confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis and sequencing, respectively. Leaf or root samples were digested with 3 ml of 13 m HNO3 at 220 °C for 20 min using a MARS XPRESS microwave reaction system (CEM, Matthews, NC) in triplicate. For xylem sap collection, rice plants were detopped at a height of 3 cm from the root. The surface of the excised leaf sheath was wiped gently, and a tube filled with cellulose was placed on the cut end. The entire length of the tube was covered with aluminum foil, and the xylem sap was collected for 30 min. For Cd treatments, 4-week-old plants were transferred to a nutrient solution as described above with 10 μm Cd (CdCl2) and grown for 3 days. Forty-five rice plants were used for xylem sap collection. The xylem sap was collected in cellulose and filtered with a 0.65-μm filtering column (Millipore). The extracted xylem sap was stored at −20 °C until further analysis. Because the amount of xylem sap differed, 36 samples with median values of these xylem sap amounts were selected, and 12 individual samples each were pooled at random into three tubes for further analysis. Xylem samples were digested with 3 ml of 13 m HNO3 at 80 °C for 60 min. After digestion, samples were collected, diluted to 5 ml, and analyzed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) (SPS1200VR, Seiko, Tokyo, Japan) as described previously (12Ishimaru Y. Kim S. Tsukamoto T. Oki H. Kobayashi T. Watanabe S. Matsuhashi S. Takahashi M. Nakanishi H. Mori S. Nishizawa N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 7373-7378Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). 5 μl of xylem sap was added to 5 μl of water or 5 μl of 1 mm PCA (Tokyo Kasei, Tokyo, Japan) as described previously (13Kakei Y. Yamaguchi I. Kobayashi T. Takahashi M. Nakanishi H. Yamakawa T. Nishizawa N.K. Plant Cell Physiol. 2009; 50: 1988-1993Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). LC/MS analyses were performed using a JSM-T100LC “AccuTOF” (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) in electrospray ionization mode with a Synergi 4-μm Hydro RP 80A column (4 μm, 80 A, 150 × 2.0 mm; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). Then, 0.5% formic acid in water and 0.5% formic acid in methanol were used as mobile phases A and B, respectively. The flow rate was constant at 0.300 ml/min, and the mobile phase composition was as follows: 100% A for 3 min, linear increase over 8 min to 35% B, linear increase over 8 min to 100% B, 100% B for 10 min before returning linearly to 100% A over 1 min. Electrospray ionization was used with a desolvent chamber temperature of 300 °C, orifice 1 temperature of 120 °C, electrospray ionization needle voltage of 4000 V, ring lens voltage of 10 V, orifice 1 voltage of 35 V, and orifice 2 voltage of 8 V in negative-ion mode. The full-length open reading frame of PEZ1 was amplified from pENTR/D-TOPO-PEZ1 with forward and reverse primers as follows: PEZ1, 5′-GGGGGGGAATTCATGGGAAGCTCCGTCAAGGACGC-3′ and 5′-GGGGGGGGATCCTTATTCTGACAACAGAGGTGTCT-3′. The DNA containing PEZ1 was swapped in the modified pYES2 vector (Invitrogen) using EcoRI and BamHI under the control of the T7 promoter (14Kato Y. Sakaguchi M. Mori Y. Saito K. Nakamura T. Bakker E.P. Sato Y. Goshima S. Uozumi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 6488-6493Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Oocytes of Xenopus laevis frogs were injected with either capped complementary RNA encoding PEZ1 or water and then incubated at 17 °C (14Kato Y. Sakaguchi M. Mori Y. Saito K. Nakamura T. Bakker E.P. Sato Y. Goshima S. Uozumi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 6488-6493Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). After 1-day incubation, eight oocytes were each injected with 23 nl of 500 μm 14C-labeled PCA (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc., St. Louis, MO) in an Na Barth's buffer. After 60 min, 650 μl of the buffer was sampled to measure radioactivity. Radioactivity of the sampled external solutions and oocytes was measured using full-spectrum dpm counting in a liquid scintillation analyzer. PCA efflux was expressed as a percentage of the total PCA injected. The full-length open reading frame of PEZ1 (1563 bp) was amplified with forward and reverse primers as follows: PEZ1, 5′-CACCATGGGAAGCTCCGTCAAGGACGC-3′ and 5′-TTCTGACAACAGAGGTGTCTTAT-3′. The full-length PEZ1 ORF was cloned into pENTR/D-TOPO (Invitrogen) and then subcloned into pH7WGF2 (15Karimi M. Inzé D. Depicker A.

Onion epidermal cells were transformed using a Biolistic PDS-1000/He particle delivery system (Bio-Rad), and rice transformation was performed using the Agrobacterium method (16Ishimaru Y. Bashir K.

Transgenic plants were grown as described under “Plant Materials.” The GFP fluorescence was monitored as described previously (16Ishimaru Y. Bashir K. Fujimoto M. An G. Itai R.N. Tsutsumi N.

The PEZ1 ORF was subcloned into the expression vector pDR195 (17Rentsch D. Laloi M. Rouhara I. Schmelzer. E. Delrot S. Frommer W.B. FEBS Letters. 1995; 370: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) using LR recombinant reaction (Invitrogen) and then introduced by the Li acetate yeast transformation method as described previously (18Bashir K.

Commun. 2011; 2: 322Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) into a yeast strain defective in yeast Cd factor (ycf1, unable to sequester Cd to vacuole (19Li Z.S. Lu Y.P. Zhen R.G. Szczypka M. Thiele D.J. Rea P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar)) and selected for uracil on synthetic defined medium containing agar. Yeast ycf1 cells transformed with the empty pDR195 were used as a control. The transformed yeast cells were grown in liquid synthetic defined medium at 30 °C to an A600 of 1.0 and spotted onto synthetic defined agar medium containing 10 μm CdCl2. The 1-kb 5′ upstream region of the PEZ1 gene was amplified using KOD plus polymerase at an annealing temperature of 60 °C by the forward primer 5′-GGGGGGAAGCTTTTTTTTACGGAAACCTTG-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-GGGGGGTCTAGAGTGTGTCGTATGCGTGTC-3′, which contain HindIII and XbaI restriction sites, respectively. The amplified fragment was fused into the pBluescript II SK+ vector, and its sequence was confirmed. The PEZ1 promoter was digested with XbaI and HindIII, and the digested 1-kb fragment was subcloned upstream of the uidA ORF, which encodes β-glucuronidase, in the pIG121Hm vector. Oryza sativa L. cv. Tsukinohikari was transformed (8Ishimaru Y. Suzuki M. Tsukamoto T. Suzuki K. Nakazono M. Kobayashi T. Wada Y. Watanabe S. Matsuhashi S. Takahashi M. Nakanishi H. Mori S. Nishizawa N.K. Plant J. 2006; 45: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Rice plants were grown in a greenhouse for 6 weeks after germination on +Fe MS medium, and the histochemical localization was observed in three independent T2 plants. Roots and stems of transgenic plants were cut with a scalpel into ∼1-cm sections. The sections were embedded in 4% agar and then cut into sections of 80–130 μm using a DTK-100 vibrating microtome (Dosaka EM Co. Ltd, Kyoto, Japan). The sections were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in GUS reaction buffer (1 mm 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-b-d-glucuronide, 3 mm K4[Fe(CN)6], 0.5 mm K3[Fe(CN)6], 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), and 20% (v/v) methanol). Following staining, the sections were washed in 70% ethanol for 2 days to remove the chlorophyll and held in 70% ethanol until observation. GUS staining was observed using an Axiophoto microscope (Carl Zeiss), following the manufacturer's instructions. We focused on genes potentially related to Cd transport in rice. Cd uptake and translocation is partly mediated by the Fe uptake system (20Connolly E.L. Fett J.P. Guerinot M.L. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1347-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar, 21Vert G. Grotz N. Dédaldéchamp F. Gaymard F. Guerinot M.L. Briat J.F. Curie C. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar, 22Nakanishi N. Ogawa I. Ishimaru Y. Mori S. Nishizawa N.K. Soil Sci. Plant Nutr. 2006; 52: 464-469Crossref Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 23Ogawa I. Nakanishi H. Mori S. Nishizawa N.K. Plant Soil. 2009; 325: 97-108Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Microarray analysis revealed that several genes potentially related to Cd transport were up- or down-regulated in response to Cd (23Ogawa I. Nakanishi H. Mori S. Nishizawa N.K. Plant Soil. 2009; 325: 97-108Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar). We obtained ∼50 independent T-DNA mutants available from the Rice T-DNA Insertion Sequence Database, grew them in Cd-contaminated soil, and measured the Cd concentration in leaves and seeds. In this process, we isolated two Cd-accumulating mutants that were related to phenolic secretion and named them phenolics efflux zero1 (pez1) 1 and 2. When grown in soil, these mutants accumulated higher Cd amounts in leaves and seeds (Fig. 1, A and B), whereas no difference was observed for leaf dry weight per plant, soil-plant analysis development value (C and D), the concentration of other metals in seed (supplemental Fig. S1, A–D), as well as yield (supplemental Fig. S1E). PEZ1 belongs to the multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MatE) transporter family, a group of proteins with 12–14 transmembrane domains transporting small organic compounds (24Omote H. Hiasa M. Matsumoto T. Otsuka M. Moriyama Y. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2006; 27: 587-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). In the WT and in the pez mutants, PEZ1 was up-regulated in leaves and roots under 10 μm Cd conditions (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). When pez1-1 and pez1-2 plants were grown in the presence of 10 μm Cd, the expression was low in both roots and leaves compared with the WT (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). In pez1-1, T-DNA was integrated at 449 bp upstream from the ATG start codon of PEZ1 (supplemental Fig. S2C), and under control conditions a decreased expression was detected only in the roots (supplemental Fig. S2B). In pez1-2, T-DNA was integrated into the first intron of PEZ1 (supplemental Fig. S2C), and expression was decreased both in roots and leaves in the presence and absence of Cd (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). The integration of T-DNA in pez1-1 and pez1-2 was confirmed by using gene-specific primers (supplemental Fig. S2, D and E). When grown in hydroponic solution, pez1-1 and pez1-2 also showed higher Cd concentrations in roots and leaves compared with the WT (Fig. 1, E and F). To identify the substrates of PEZ1, LC/MS data profiles of the xylem sap of pez1-1 and pez1-2 mutants were compared with that of the WT. In pez1-1 and pez1-2, a peak at 22.8 min with m/z 153.03 was not detected in the xylem sap of the mutants (Fig. 2, A–D). We searched KNApSAcK, a comprehensive species-metabolite relationship database, and found that this peak corresponds to PCA. In addition to this peak, a peak at 22.7 min with m/z 179.04 was not detected in the xylem sap of both mutants, and a database search suggested that this corresponds to CA (Fig. 2, E–H). Spiking the xylem of pez1-2 with purified PCA and CA confirmed that these peaks correspond to PCA and CA (Fig. 2, I and J). The PCA efflux activity of PEZ1 was investigated in X. laevis oocytes with radiolabeled PCA as a substrate. Results confirmed that PEZ1 transports PCA (Fig. 3). PEZ1 was localized to the plasma membrane in rice root cells, rice root hairs, and onion epidermal cells (Fig. 4, A–G and supplemental Fig. S3, A and B). PEZ1 did not rescue the growth defect of a Cd-sensitive yeast mutant, confirming that PEZ1 does not transport Cd (supplemental Fig. S3, C and D). To further understand its role, the PEZ1 promoter was used to drive the expression of GUS in rice. Histochemical analysis revealed that PEZ1 was expressed in the stele at the base of roots (Fig. 5A). In root transverse sections taken from around 2.5 mm from the root tip, the expression was observed around the xylem vessels, whereas in transverse sections taken at a distance of 5 mm from the root tip, the expression was mainly observed in stele (Fig. 5, B and C).FIGURE 4Subcellular localization of 35Sp-PEZ1-GFP in the rice root.

There was no significant difference in Zn, Mn, and Cu concentration between the WT and pez1-2, both in roots and shoots, with or without Cd (supplemental Fig. S4, A–F). On the other hand, Fe concentration in the xylem sap was lower than in the WT, both with and without Cd, whereas there was no significant difference in xylem Cd and Mn concentration (Fig. 6, C–E). Moreover, the expression of OsIRT1 was up-regulated in the mutant roots compared with the control when grown with or without Cd (Fig. 6F). Leaf samples were stained with Perl's solution to check the localization of Fe, and significant differences were found between WT and the pez1-2 mutant for the localization of insoluble Fe(III) (Fig. 6, G and H). To further understand the role of PEZ1, the PEZ1 overexpression lines were developed and characterized for phenotype and metal concentration. Real-time RT-PCR analysis confirmed that the expression of PEZ1 was significantly high in the PEZ1 overexpression lines, both in roots and shoots (supplemental Fig. S5, A and B). In PEZ1 overexpression lines, the Fe concentration in roots and leaves was higher compared with WT plants under normal nutrient conditions (Fig. 7, A and B). The growth of overexpression lines was severely restricted in terms of plant height and root length, and many necrotic, dark brown spots were observed on old leaves (Fig. 7, C and D). Root and shoot dry weight was significantly reduced in PEZ1 overexpression lines (supplemental Fig. S5, C and D). Moreover, significant differences were observed for root Zn and leaf Mn concentrations, whereas there was no difference for the accumulation of other metals in roots and leaves (supplemental Fig. S5, E–J). Differences were also observed for the SPAD value between PEZ1 overexpression lines and the WT (supplemental Fig. S5K). In a medium containing higher concentrations of Fe, precipitated Fe(III) was not observed in PEZ1 overexpression lines, whereas Fe was precipitated at the WT root surface (supplemental Fig. S6). In a calcareous soil, where plants cannot absorb enough Fe from the rhizosphere because of high pH, PEZ1 overexpression lines grew better in terms of plant height and leaf chlorophyll content than the WT plants, and dark brown spots were not observed in PEZ1 overexpression lines (Fig. 7E and supplemental Fig. S7, A and B). We identified two pez1 mutants in which the amount of PCA and CA in the xylem sap were dramatically reduced and Cd accumulation in leaves and seeds was higher (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2). PEZ1 localized to the plasma membrane and transported PCA in X. laevis oocytes (FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4). PEZ1 was mainly localized to the stele in roots (Fig. 5). Fe concentrations increased in the roots of pez1 plants, whereas it decreased in the xylem sap, suggesting that the defect in PCA secretion increases precipitated apoplasmic Fe in the stele and reduces soluble Fe in the xylem (Fig. 6). Thus, rice seems to transport PCA through PEZ1 for the solubilization of precipitated apoplasmic Fe in the root xylem, which may contribute to the long-distance transport of Fe. Moreover, the PEZ1 overexpression lines accumulated more Fe in roots and leaves because of the high solubilization of precipitated apoplasmic stele Fe, and as a result, the growth of these lines was severely restricted (Fig. 7, A–D). Excess PCA secretion would strongly solubilize Fe precipitated in the stele, leading to the symptoms of Fe excess. On the other hand, the PEZ1 overexpression lines grew better than the WT in calcareous soil, showing that in these lines solubilized Fe by PCA would be available under Fe-limiting conditions (Fig. 7E). Furthermore, these data indicate that phenolics secretion affects Fe acquisition in rice. Reduced secretion of PCA in the pez1-2 mutant would impair the solubilization of precipitated apoplasmic Fe in the stele, and thereby, the low availability of Fe would lead to the induction of OsIRT1 (Fig. 6E). Moreover, both PEZ1 and OsIRT1 colocalize in stele under control conditions and are induced by Fe deficiency in rice roots (supplemental Fig. S8 (8Ishimaru Y. Suzuki M. Tsukamoto T. Suzuki K. Nakazono M. Kobayashi T. Wada Y. Watanabe S. Matsuhashi S. Takahashi M. Nakanishi H. Mori S. Nishizawa N.K. Plant J. 2006; 45: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 15Karimi M. Inzé D. Depicker A. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 193-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2748) Google Scholar). The PCA secretion by PEZ1 may complement Fe(II) uptake by OsIRT1 under Fe deficiency and seems to be an integral part of the Fe(II) uptake system in rice (Fig. 8). In red clover, removal of the secreted phenolics significantly enhances root Fe accumulation and triggers Fe deficiency responses because the solubilization and utilization of apoplasmic Fe is inhibited (9Jin C.W. You G.Y. He Y.F. Tang C. Wu P. Zheng S.J. Plant Physiol. 2007; 144: 278-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Therefore, the homologues of PEZ1 might also play an important role in PCA efflux and Fe solubilization in red clover. The reason why pez1 accumulate Cd is still unclear. A titration assay indicated that PCA has a much lower affinity for Cd compared with glutathione, suggesting that the amount of PCA·Cd complex is almost negligible in root cells and in the apoplasm (supplemental Fig. S9, A–C). A yeast complementation assay revealed that PEZ1 was not involved in Cd uptake (supplemental Fig. S3, C and D). In the pez1 mutant, Fe concentration in xylem sap was lower, but that in the leaf was not changed (Fig. 6, A and B). In the case of Cd concentration, there was no difference in the xylem, but a higher accumulation was observed in the leaf (Figs. 1C and 6D). These results may suggest that besides xylem transport, Fe and Cd in the mutant may also be transported through symplasmic pathways. OsIRT1 transports Cd in addition to Fe(II) (22Nakanishi N. Ogawa I. Ishimaru Y. Mori S. Nishizawa N.K. Soil Sci. Plant Nutr. 2006; 52: 464-469Crossref Scopus (361) Google Scholar). OsIRT1 localization in phloem, its substrate specificity, and increased expression in the pez1 mutant suggests that Fe and Cd uptake and translocation through OsIRT1 could be enhanced in pez1 mutants (Fig. 8) and that increased Cd accumulation in pez1 mutants may be due to the increase in IRT activity in a decreased Fe environment where Cd will have reduced competition. A study recently reported that plasma membrane-localized maize ZmMATE2, which shares 85% amino acid identity with PEZ1, seems to be involved in Al tolerance, although the substrate is not yet clarified (25Maron L.G. Piñeros M.A. Guimarães C.T. Magalhaes J.V. Pleiman J.K. Mao C. Shaff J. Belicuas S.N. Kochian L.V. Plant J. 2010; 61: 728-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Al was also suggested to activate the release of flavonoid-type phenolic compounds from maize roots, and phenolics were suggested to be effective chelators of Al (26Kidd P.S. Llugany M. Poschenrieder C. Gunsé B. Barceló J. J. Exp. Bot. 2001; 52: 1339-1352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Barcelo J. Poschenrieder C. Environ. Exp. Bot. 2002; 48: 75-92Crossref Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Therefore, PEZ1 might also play a major role in Al tolerance. Phenolics may have other roles apart from metal homeostasis. PCA and other phenolics act as antioxidants; free radical scavengers; and inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase, and lipoxygenase in various biological systems (28Ríos J.L. Recio M.C. Escandell J.M. Andújar I. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2009; 15: 1212-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 29Perron N.R. Brumaghim J.L. Cell Biochem.

FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1670-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Moreover, phenolics also serve as allelochemicals and precursors of lignin for microorganisms and plants (31Popa V.I. Mariana D. Irina V. Anghel N. Indust. Crops Products. 2008; 27: 144-149Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Therefore, the characterization of PEZ1 would also greatly increase our understanding of phenolic transport in other biological systems. The present results confirmed that PEZ1 transports PCA and possibly CA for the utilization of apoplasmic precipitated Fe in rice in stele. To our knowledge, this is the first identification of a phenolics efflux transporter in a biological system and provides a molecular basis for understanding the solubilization of precipitated apoplasmic Fe in higher plants. We thank Dr. E. Yoshimura for calculating the apparent binding constant of PCA to Cd, Dr. G. An for providing the T-DNA mutants, Dr. Y. Nagamura for supporting our time course analysis, Mr. I.

https://openalex.org/W2051835249,"The tropical plant <i>Clitoria ternatea</i> is a member of the Fabaceae family well known for its medicinal values. Heat extraction of <i>C. ternatea</i> revealed that the bioactive fractions contained heat-stable cysteine-rich peptides (CRPs). The CRP family of A1b (Albumin-1 chain b/leginsulins), which is a linear cystine knot CRP, has been shown to present abundantly in the Fabaceae. In contrast, the cyclotide family, which also belongs to the cystine knot CRPs but with a cyclic structure, is commonly found in the Rubiaceae, Violaceae, and Cucurbitaceae families. In this study, we report the discovery of a panel of 15 heat-stable CRPs, of which 12 sequences (cliotide T1–T12) are novel. We show unambiguously that the cliotides are cyclotides and not A1bs, as determined by their sequence homology, disulfide connectivity, and membrane active properties indicated by their antimicrobial activities against <i>Escherichia coli</i> and cytotoxicities to HeLa cells. We also show that cliotides are prevalent in <i>C. ternatea</i> and are found in every plant tissue examined, including flowers, seeds, and nodules. In addition, we demonstrate that their precursors are chimeras, half from cyclotide and the other half from Albumin-1, with the cyclotide domain displacing the A1b domain in the precursor. Their chimeric structures likely originate from either horizontal gene transfer or convergent evolution in plant nuclear genomes, which are exceedingly rare events. Such atypical genetic arrangement also implies a different mechanism of biosynthetic processing of cyclotides in the Fabaceae and provides new understanding of their evolution in plants."

Both steps were shown to share in the control of isotope flux in these cells. The kinetics of label exchange were well described by a kinetic model that employed rate constants for the lactate dehydrogenase reaction that had been determined previously from steady state kinetic studies. The enzyme showed pyruvate inhibition in steady state kinetic measurements, which the kinetic model predicted should also be observed in the isotope exchange measurements. However, no such pyruvate inhibition was observed in either intact cells or cell lysates and this could be explained by the much higher enzyme concentrations present in the isotope exchange experiments. The kinetic analysis presented here shows how lactate dehydrogenase activity can be determined from the isotope exchange measurements. The kinetic model should be useful for modeling the exchange reaction in vivo, particularly as this technique progresses to the clinic.

https://openalex.org/W2110793538,"Tumor necrosis factor-stimulated gene-6 (TSG-6) is a hyaluronan (HA)-binding protein that plays important roles in inflammation and ovulation. TSG-6-mediated cross-linking of HA has been proposed as a functional mechanism (e.g. for regulating leukocyte adhesion), but direct evidence for cross-linking is lacking, and we know very little about its impact on HA ultrastructure. Here we used films of polymeric and oligomeric HA chains, end-grafted to a solid support, and a combination of surface-sensitive biophysical techniques to quantify the binding of TSG-6 into HA films and to correlate binding to morphological changes. We find that full-length TSG-6 binds with pronounced positive cooperativity and demonstrate that it can cross-link HA at physiologically relevant concentrations. Our data indicate that cooperative binding of full-length TSG-6 arises from HA-induced protein oligomerization and that the TSG-6 oligomers act as cross-linkers. In contrast, the HA-binding domain of TSG-6 (the Link module) alone binds without positive cooperativity and weaker than the full-length protein. Both the Link module and full-length TSG-6 condensed and rigidified HA films, and the degree of condensation scaled with the affinity between the TSG-6 constructs and HA. We propose that condensation is the result of protein-mediated HA cross-linking. Our findings firmly establish that TSG-6 is a potent HA cross-linking agent and might hence have important implications for the mechanistic understanding of the biological function of TSG-6 (e.g. in inflammation)."
https://openalex.org/W2018432347,"Gossip is a form of affective information about who is friend and who is foe. We show that gossip does not influence only how a face is evaluated—it affects whether a face is seen in the first place. In two experiments, neutral faces were paired with negative, positive, or neutral gossip and were then presented alone in a binocular rivalry paradigm (faces were presented to one eye, houses to the other). In both studies, faces previously paired with negative (but not positive or neutral) gossip dominated longer in visual consciousness. These findings demonstrate that gossip, as a potent form of social affective learning, can influence vision in a completely top-down manner, independent of the basic structural features of a face."
https://openalex.org/W1972689397,"Flavodiiron (Flv) proteins are involved in detoxification of O(2) and NO in anaerobic bacteria and archaea. Cyanobacterial Flv proteins, on the contrary, function in oxygenic environment and possess an extra NAD(P)H:flavin oxidoreductase module. Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 has four genes (sll1521, sll0219, sll0550, and sll0217) encoding Flv proteins (Flv1, Flv2, Flv3, and Flv4). Previous in vitro studies with recombinant Flv3 protein from Synechocystis provided evidence that it functions as a NAD(P)H:oxygen oxidoreductase, and subsequent in vivo studies with Synechocystis confirmed the role of Flv1 and Flv3 proteins in the Mehler reaction (photoreduction of O(2) to H(2)O). Interestingly, homologous proteins to Flv1 and Flv3 can be found also in green algae, mosses, and Selaginella. Here, we addressed the function of Flv1 and Flv3 in Synechocystis using the Δflv1, Δflv3, and Δflv1/Δflv3 mutants and applying inorganic carbon (C(i))-deprivation conditions. We propose that only the Flv1/Flv3 heterodimer form is functional in the Mehler reaction in vivo. (18)O(2) labeling was used to discriminate between O(2) evolution in photosynthetic water splitting and O(2) consumption. In wild type, ∼20% of electrons originated from water was targeted to O(2) under air level CO(2) conditions but increased up to 60% in severe limitation of C(i). Gas exchange experiments with Δflv1, Δflv3, and Δflv1/Δflv3 mutants demonstrated that a considerable amount of electrons in these mutants is directed to photorespiration under C(i) deprivation. This assumption is in line with increased transcript abundance of photorespiratory genes and accumulation of photorespiratory intermediates in the WT and to a higher extent in mutant cells under C(i) deprivation."
https://openalex.org/W2041650871,"Endorepellin, the C-terminal module of perlecan, negatively regulates angiogenesis counter to its proangiogenic parental molecule. Endorepellin (the C-terminal domain V of perlecan) binds the α2β1 integrin on endothelial cells and triggers a signaling cascade that leads to disruption of the actin cytoskeleton. Here, we show that both perlecan and endorepellin bind directly and with high affinity to both VEGF receptors 1 and 2, in a region that differs from VEGFA-binding site. In both human and porcine endothelial cells, this interaction evokes a physical down-regulation of both the α2β1 integrin and VEGFR2, with concurrent activation of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 and downstream attenuation of VEGFA transcription. We demonstrate that endorepellin requires both the α2β1 integrin and VEGFR2 for its angiostatic activity. Endothelial cells that express α2β1 integrin but lack VEGFR2, do not respond to endorepellin treatment. Thus, we provide a new paradigm for the activity of an antiangiogenic protein and mechanistically explain the specificity of endorepellin for endothelial cells, the only cells that simultaneously express both receptors. We hypothesize that a mechanism such as dual receptor antagonism could operate for other angiostatic fragments.

Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 646-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Most of these activities are mediated by VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2), which is located at strategic domains of the endothelial plasma membrane. This specialized topology facilitates rapid and efficient signal transduction through receptor homodimerization and association with co-receptors leading to recruitment of downstream signaling molecules (4Ferrara N. Gerber H.P. LeCouter J. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (7141) Google Scholar). A central mechanism for modulating cellular responses to VEGFA occurs via activation of various integrin receptors (5Byzova T.V. Goldman C.K. Pampori N. Thomas K.A. Bett A. Shattil S.J. Plow E.F. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 851-860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which, by functionally coupling with VEGFR2, regulate developmental and pathological angiogenesis (6Humphries M.J. Travis M.A. Clark K. Mould A.P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2004; 32: 822-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). For example, endothelial cell binding to vitronectin through αvβ3 integrin positively regulates VEGFR2 (7Soldi R. Mitola S. Strasly M. Defilippi P. Tarone G. Bussolino F.

Moreover, activated αvβ3 co-localizes with VEGFR2 on tumor endothelial cells (10Mahabeleshwar G.H. Chen J. Feng W. Somanath P.R. Razorenova O.V. Byzova T.V. Cell Cycle. 2008; 7: 335-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and angiogenesis in transgenic mice expressing a phosphorylation-defective β3 integrin is impaired due to an inability of β3 integrin to form a functional bipartite complex with VEGFR2 (11Mahabeleshwar G.H.

These results demonstrate a functional interplay between αvβ3 integrin and VEGFR2 that leads to enhancement of ligand-induced activity of this receptor tyrosine kinase upon integrin engagement (12Somanath P.R.

In contrast, α1β1 integrin induces T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase that dephosphorylates and silences VEGFR2 (19Mattila E. Auvinen K. Salmi M. Ivaska J. J.

A functional interaction between β1 integrins and VEGFR2 plays a role in the pathogenesis of infantile hemangiomas (21Jinnin M. Medici D. Park L. Limaye N. Liu Y. Boscolo E. Bischoff J. Vikkula M.

Notably, VEGFR2 associates with two thrombospondin receptors, namely CD36 and β1 integrin, and activation of VEGFR2 by VEGFA is suppressed by antiangiogenic domains of thrombospondin (23Zhang X.

Genetic ablation studies have revealed specialized functions for several cell-associated heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) that depend on their ability to coordinate functional interactions between VEGFs and their cognate receptors (24Bishop J.R. Schuksz M. Esko J.D. Nature. 2007; 446: 1030-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar). The current view is that cell surface HSPGs potentiate the duration and magnitude of VEGFA signaling through VEGFR2, the main receptor of vascular endothelial cells, and these activities have been corroborated by studies focused on vasculogenesis and tumor angiogenesis (25Fuster M.M.

The concerted interaction of endorepellin, α2β1 integrin, and VEGFR2 leads to a transcriptional repression of VEGFA production, thereby contributing to the antiangiogenic activity of endorepellin. Our work provides a new paradigm for antiangiogenic fragments derived from large precursors, that is “a dual receptor” antagonism. We predict that a similar bioactivity could be operational for other processed forms of angiostatic matrix molecules. The following antibodies were used in this study: anti-GAPDH from Advanced Immunochemical (Long Beach, CA), anti-integrin α2 I-domain blocking monoclonal antibody (1998Z) from Millipore (Billerica, MA), monoclonal rabbit anti-human VEGFR2 and anti-phospho-VEGFR2 at Tyr-1175 from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA), polyclonal rabbit antibodies against VEGFR2, SHP-1, and α2 integrin from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), monoclonal mouse HRP-anti-phosphotyrosine (pTyr-20) from BD Biosciences (Franklin Lakes, NJ), and mouse anti-β-actin from Sigma-Aldrich. The rabbit anti-endorepellin antibody was described previously (58Bix G. Fu J. Gonzalez E.M. Macro L. Barker A. Campbell S. Zutter M.M. Santoro S.A. Kim J.K. Höök M. Reed C.C. Iozzo R.V. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Affinity purified goat anti-endorepellin antibody (AF2364) was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Secondary antibodies were as follows: HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA), and IR680 goat anti-mouse and IR800CW goat anti-rabbit IgG from LI-COR Biosciences (Lincoln, NE). Heparin from porcine intestinal mucosa, DAPI, SIGMAFASTTM O-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride and Na3VO4 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, NSC87877 from Calbiochem (Gibbstown, NJ), and rat tail collagen I from BD Biosciences. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were purchased from Lifeline Cell Technology (Walkersville, MD) and used only within the first five passages. Porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAE) and their transgenic cells expressing either VEGFR1 or VEGFR2 were described previously (65Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.H.

Low growth factor MatrigelTM was from BD Biosciences. Recombinant human endorepellin was produced as described previously (57Mongiat M. Sweeney S.M. San Antonio J.D. Fu J. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4238-4249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Recombinant human VEGFA (VEGF165) and recombinant placenta growth factor were purchased from R&D Systems. VEGFA was also obtained from the NIH repository (also made by R&D Systems). Recombinant bacterial VEGFE derived from the Orf parapoxvirus was purchased from Angio-Proteomie (Boston, MA). The following vascular endothelial growth factor receptors were used: VEGFR1-Fc (321-FL) and VEGFR2-Fc (357-KD) (R&D Systems), VEGFR1 containing Ig-like repeats 2–7 (Ig2–7, PF082) and VEGFR2 containing Ig-like repeats 1–7 (Ig1–7, 676490, Calbiochem). We utilized two sources of human perlecan. The first was human recombinant perlecan containing a His6 tag at its C terminus (like endorepellin), which was expressed in the FreeStyleTM 293 expression system from Invitrogen as described previously (67Li S. Shimono C. Norioka N. Nakano I. Okubo T. Yagi Y. Hayashi M. Sato Y. Fujisaki H. Hattori S. Sugiura N. Kimata K. Sekiguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 36645-36655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The second source was human perlecan immunopurified from media conditioned by coronary artery endothelial cells (68Chuang C.Y. Lord M.S. Melrose J. Rees M.D. Knox S.M. Freeman C. Iozzo R.V. Whitelock J.M. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 5524-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Perlecan was purified using an affinity column containing a monoclonal antibody against domain III (69Murdoch A.D. Liu B. Schwarting R. Tuan R.S. Iozzo R.V. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 42: 239-249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and using a protocol as described previously (70Whitelock J.M. Graham L.D. Melrose J. Murdoch A.D. Iozzo R.V. Underwood P.A. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 163-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Both preparations behaved identically in our binding assays. After each treatment, cells were washed three times for 5 min with PBS and then lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, and protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethanesulfonylfluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml Tosyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin)). Lysates were then spun at 15,000 rpm for 5 min in a 4 °C temperature-controlled centrifuge, and the protein in the supernatant was collected. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes from Bio-Rad. The blots were developed with IR-labeled secondary antibodies and detected using the Odyssey (version 2.1, LI-COR). The conditioned medium was also collected for slot blotting. The proteins on slot blot membranes were detected using HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies and chemiluminescence. ELISAs were performed following a standard protocol. The substrates, either VEGFR1 (100 ng/well) or VEGFR2 (100 ng/well), were allowed to adhere overnight at 4 °C in the presence of carbonate buffer, pH 9.6. Plates were washed with PBS, blocked with 1% BSA, and incubated for 2 h with serial dilutions of endorepellin or VEGFA. In the quantitative competition experiments, endorepellin was kept at constant concentration (20 nm) and incubated with increasing concentrations of VEGFA. In the qualitative competition experiments, endorepellin and VEGFA concentrations were varied (20 or 200 nm) to create a 10-fold excess of each ligand over the other ligand. After ligand incubation, plates were extensively washed with PBS, blocked with 1% BSA, and incubated with primary and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. The immune complexes were revealed using SIGMAFASTTM O-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride. Absorbance at 490 nm was measured in a Victor3TM (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For overlay assays, VEGFR1-Fc (100 ng), VEGFR2-Fc (100 ng) and VEGFA (100 ng) were either adsorbed directly onto the nitrocellulose membrane (for slot blot) or separated on SDS-PAGE (for overlay analysis). The membranes were then overlaid with endorepellin (1 μg) for 2–3 h at 25 °C. Endorepellin bound to the VEGF receptor chimera and/or to VEGFA was then detected by probing with an antibody against endorepellin. Endorepellin bound to progranulin (50 ng) was used as a positive control (71Gonzalez E.M. Mongiat M. Slater S.J. Baffa R. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38113-38116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Binding ability of adsorbed VEGFR chimera was assessed by overlaying the membranes (with adsorbed receptor chimera) with VEGFA followed by the detection of receptor-bound VEGFA. Following specified treatment, endothelial cells were rinsed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer for 20 min on ice. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Equivalent levels of protein, determined using the DC protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad), were used. For immunoprecipitation, protein A-Sepharose magnetic beads from GE Healthcare were absorbed with antibodies for 4 h at 4 °C, and precleared cell lysates were added to the beads for 18 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing, the beads were boiled in reducing buffer, and supernatants were separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were then transferred to nylon membranes (Bio-Rad), probed with indicated antibodies, and developed with either enhanced chemiluminescence technique from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA) or IR-labeled secondary antibodies and detected with the use of either image Quant LAS 4000 (GE Healthcare) or Odyssey (version 2.1, LI-COR). Purified endorepellin was labeled with the IR800 dye using IRDye® 800CW labeling kit (LI-COR) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, endorepellin was mixed with dye in a molar ratio of 1:1 and kept for 2 h at 20 °C while protecting the vial from light. IRDye 800CW dye bears an N-hydroxysuccinimide ester-reactive group that couples to aliphatic amines, especially lysine residues, thereby forming stable conjugates. Free dye was removed from the labeled endorepellin by using 0.5-ml Pierce Zeba Desalting spin columns. A 10% SDS-PAGE was run to check the labeled endorepellin. For pulldown assays, protein A-Sepharose magnetic beads (GE Healthcare) were washed with TBS and absorbed with 2 μg of VEGFR1-Fc or VEGFR2-Fc in 0.1% BSA-TBS (with protease inhibitors) for 18 h at 4 °C. The beads were blocked with 1% BSA-TBS for 1 h at 25 °C, washed, and incubated for 3 h with 1 μg of IR800-labeled endorepellin at 25 °C. Following extensive washing, the beads were boiled in reducing buffer, and supernatants were separated by SDS-PAGE and scanned using Odyssey (version 2.1, LI-COR). For in-cell binding assays, confluent wild-type and VEGFR1- or VEGFR2-expressing PAE cells were serum-starved for 3 h and incubated with IR800-endorepellin (50 nm) in 0.1% BSA/DMEM for 1 h on ice and in the dark. The cells were extensively washed, fixed in 10% formaldehyde, and scanned with the Odyssey Image system at 800 nm. The cells were then washed again and incubated with the far-red fluorescent DNA dye DRAQ5TM (1:10,000) from Biostatus Limited (Leicestershire, UK) in 0.1% BSA/PBS. After washing a further three times with PBS, the cells were scanned at 700 nm, and these values were used to normalize the data. For in-cell Western assays, HUVECs grown on collagen were treated with 1 μm NSC87877 (SHP-1 inhibitor) for various time intervals. After treatment, the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and fixed in 100% methanol at −20 °C for 15 min. The cells were washed a further three times with PBS and blocked at 4 °C for 2 h with 5% BSA/PBS. Once blocked, primary antibody (rabbit anti-VEGFA) was added for 2 h at a dilution of 1:200 in 1% BSA/PBS. The cells were then washed three times with PBS. Anti-rabbit IR800-labeled secondary antibody was added for 1 h and used to visualize VEGFA levels. The values were normalized using the far-red fluorescent DNA dye DRAQ5TM (1:10,000) in 0.1% BSA/PBS. After three washes with PBS, the cells were viewed using the LI-COR Odyssey. Gene expression analysis by qPCR was carried out as described previously (72Buraschi S. Pal N. Tyler-Rubinstein N. Owens R.T. Neill T. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 42075-42085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, subconfluent (∼3 × 105 cells) six-well plates of HUVECs or PAE-VEGFR2 cells were treated with PBS (mock) or with 200 nm endorepellin for 2 or 4 h. After incubation, cells were lysed directly in 500 μl of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Total RNA (1 μg) was annealed with oligo(dT)18–21 primers, and cDNA was synthesized utilizing the SuperScript Reverse Transcriptase II (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Gene-specific primers for VEGFA, FGF2, and firefly luciferase were verified before use. (See supplemental Table 1 for primer sequences.) The target genes and endogenous housekeeping gene, ACTB, were amplified via independent reactions using the Brilliant SYBR Green Master Mix II (Agilent Technologies, Cedar Creek, TX). All samples were run in quadruplicate on the Mx3005P real-time PCR platform (Agilent) and cycle number (Ct) was obtained for each independent amplicon reaction. Fold change determinations were made utilizing the comparative Ct method for gene expression analysis. Briefly, Delta Ct (ΔCt) values are representative of the normalized gene expression levels (VEGFA, FGF2, and luciferase) with respect to ACTB (β-actin, endogenous housekeeping control). ΔΔCt values represent the experimental cDNA (samples treated with 200 nm endorepellin at the indicated time points) minus the corresponding gene levels of the calibrator sample (samples treated with PBS). Finally, the reported fold change represents an average of the fold changes as calculated using the double ΔCt method (2−ΔΔCT). Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as described previously (61"
https://openalex.org/W1999746231,"Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common form of hereditary mental retardation, is caused by a loss-of-function mutation of the Fmr1 gene, which encodes fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). FMRP affects dendritic protein synthesis, thereby causing synaptic abnormalities. Here, we used a quantitative proteomics approach in an FXS mouse model to reveal changes in levels of hippocampal synapse proteins. Sixteen independent pools of Fmr1 knock-out mice and wild type mice were analyzed using two sets of 8-plex iTRAQ experiments. Of 205 proteins quantified with at least three distinct peptides in both iTRAQ series, the abundance of 23 proteins differed between Fmr1 knock-out and wild type synapses with a false discovery rate (q-value) <5%. Significant differences were confirmed by quantitative immunoblotting. A group of proteins that are known to be involved in cell differentiation and neurite outgrowth was regulated; they included Basp1 and Gap43, known PKC substrates, and Cend1. Basp1 and Gap43 are predominantly expressed in growth cones and presynaptic terminals. In line with this, ultrastructural analysis in developing hippocampal FXS synapses revealed smaller active zones with corresponding postsynaptic densities and smaller pools of clustered vesicles, indicative of immature presynaptic maturation. A second group of proteins involved in synaptic vesicle release was up-regulated in the FXS mouse model. In accordance, paired-pulse and short-term facilitation were significantly affected in these hippocampal synapses. Together, the altered regulation of presynaptically expressed proteins, immature synaptic ultrastructure, and compromised short-term plasticity points to presynaptic changes underlying glutamatergic transmission in FXS at this stage of development.

Patients suffer from multiple behavioral problems including cognitive impairments, impaired visuo-spatial processing, hyperactivity, anxiety, and in a number of cases, autism and/or epilepsy (1Garber K.B. Visootsak J. Warren S.T. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2008; 16: 666-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). FXS is caused by mutations in the Fmr1 gene resulting in the absence, significant down-regulation, or loss-of-function of the corresponding protein product, fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) (2Koukoui S.D. Chaudhuri A. Brain Res. Rev. 2007; 53: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In particular, aberrant synapse function caused by reduced FMRP expression is considered to be the major factor underlying FXS. fragile X syndrome fragile X mental retardation protein active zone postsynaptic density excitatory postsynaptic current miniature EPSC paired-pulse ratio wild type knock-out. FMRP is expressed abundantly in neurons and travels into dendritic spines in an activity-dependent manner (3Dictenberg J.B. Swanger S.A. Antar L.N. Singer R.H. Bassell G.J. Dev. Cell. 2008; 14: 926-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), where it affects local synaptic protein synthesis and plasticity. FMRP is an mRNA-binding protein, associated to many types of mRNAs, encoding both presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins (4Brown V. Jin P. Ceman S. Darnell J.C. O'Donnell W.T. Tenenbaum S.A. Jin X. Feng Y. Wilkinson K.D. Keene J.D. Darnell R.B. Warren S.T. Cell. 2001; 107: 477-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). By controlling several aspects of mRNA biology, e.g. transport, translation, and metabolism, FMRP may regulate synaptic structure and function (5Bagni C. Greenough W.T. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 376-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 6Bassell G.J. Warren S.T. Neuron. 2008; 60: 201-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). Indeed, both FXS patients and Fmr1 knock-out (KO) mice display an abnormal appearance of generally long and thin dendritic spines that resemble an immature postsynaptic phenotype (7Nimchinsky E.A. Oberlander A.M. Svoboda K. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5139-5146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Irwin S.A. Galvez R. Greenough W.T. Cereb. Cortex. 2000; 10: 1038-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Presynaptically, lack of FMRP significantly affects the motility and dynamics of axonal growth cone development in hippocampal neurons, and alterations in terminal branching of hippocampal mossy fibers are found in the Fmr1 KO mouse (9Antar L.N. Li C. Zhang H. Carroll R.C. Bassell G.J. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2006; 32: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 10Ivanco T.L. Greenough W.T. Hippocampus. 2002; 12: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, the effects of FMRP upon both presynaptic and postsynaptic structure are likely to alter functional aspects of glutamatergic signaling during synaptic development in Fmr1 KO mice. Recent studies of molecular mechanisms underlying reduced cognitive function in FXS have focused on glutamatergic synapse function in several brain regions including hippocampus, cortex, and cerebellum. In these brain areas, long-term synaptic plasticity is strongly affected. The relationship between impaired FMRP expression and synaptic plasticity is complex (11Meredith R.M. de Jong R. Mansvelder H.D. Neurobiol. Dis. 2011; 41: 104-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 12Meredith R.M. Mansvelder H.D. Front. Synaptic Neurosci. 2010; 10: 2-10Google Scholar). In the cortex, the absence of FMRP results in reduced long-term potentiation (13Wilson B.M. Cox C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 2454-2459Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 14Li J. Pelletier M.R. Perez Velazquez J.L. Carlen P.L. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 19: 138-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In the hippocampus and cerebellum, enhanced metabotropic glutamate receptor-dependent long-term depression via an increased internalization of membrane-localized AMPA receptors is observed in Fmr1 KO mice (15Nosyreva E.D. Huber K.M. J. Neurophysiol. 2006; 95: 3291-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 16Pilpel Y. Kolleker A. Berberich S. Ginger M. Frick A. Mientjes E. Oostra B.A. Seeburg P.H. J. Physiol. 2009; 587: 787-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Activity-dependent changes of synaptic efficacy are encoded by sequential molecular events at the synapse, including FMRP-mediated de novo protein synthesis during the late phase of long-term potentiation and long-term depression (17Costa-Mattioli M. Sossin W.S. Klann E. Sonenberg N. Neuron. 2009; 61: 10-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in addition, Gq-coupled M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor-dependent long-term depression requires protein synthesis and is enhanced in Fmr1 KO mice (18Massey P.V. Bhabra G. Cho K. Brown M.W. Bashir Z.I. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 14: 145-152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Volk L.J. Pfeiffer B.E. Gibson J.R. Huber K.M. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 11624-11634Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). However, an overview of synaptic proteins that are affected by the lack of FMRP and to what extent their expression levels are altered is largely unknown. Many forms of short-term plasticity, such as synaptic facilitation, are affected by rapid changes occurring at the presynaptic terminal. FMRP is expressed at presynaptic sites (20Christie S.B. Akins M.R. Schwob J.E. Fallon J.R. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 1514-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), where it may regulate establishment and/or maintenance of synaptic connections (21Bureau I. Shepherd G.M. Svoboda K. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 5178-5188Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 22Gibson J.R. Bartley A.F. Hays S.A. Huber K.M. J. Neurophysiol. 2008; 100: 2615-2626Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). A direct relation between the absence of FMRP and its regulated proteins upon synaptic ultrastructure and fast presynaptic-mediated forms of synapse function in Fmr1 KO mice has not been fully investigated in mammalian neurons. To address these issues, we have taken a quantitative proteomics approach to reveal changes in the hippocampal synaptic membrane proteome in Fmr1 KO mice as compared with the wild type (WT) mice during an early developmental period of synapse formation and refinement. We observed changes in a group consisting of known regulators of cell differentiation, filopodia protrusion, and neurite outgrowth by remodeling the actin cytoskeleton. Increase in their expression may retain synapses in an immature state, as we confirmed for Fmr1 KO synapses at the ultrastructural level. In addition, a second group of presynaptic vesicle-associated proteins was dysregulated, in line with our observed functional changes in presynaptic plasticity. Our findings show that changes in the expression levels of synaptic proteins in the Fmr1 KO mice correlate to changes in both excitatory synapse structure and excitatory synapse function, demonstrating a presynaptic locus for mechanisms underlying FXS. Fmr1 KO1 mice on a background of C57Bl/6J from Harlan Netherlands (23Dutch-Belgian Fragile X Consortium Cell. 1994; 78: 23-33PubMed Google Scholar), a kind gift of Dr. B. Oostra and Dr. R. Willemsen, were bred in our facility. Pregnant WT mice C57Bl/6JOlaHsd were obtained from Harlan Netherlands, and pups were born in our facility. For the proteomics experiment, 16 Fmr1 KO mice and 16 WT mice were used. Synaptic membranes from predominately glutamatergic synapses were isolated from PN14 Fmr1 KO and WT mice as described previously (24Li K.W. Miller S. Klychnikov O. Loos M. Stahl-Zeng J. Spijker S.

A short overview of the experimental setup is represented in Fig. 1. In brief, for each sample, hippocampi from two mice were pooled and homogenized in a glass Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer containing 5 ml of ice-cold homogenization buffer (320 mm sucrose in 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) at 900 rpm with 12 up and down strokes of the piston. The lysate was centrifuged at 1000 × g, 4 °C, for 10 min. Supernatant was loaded on top of a sucrose step gradient consisting of 0.85 and 1.2 m sucrose. After ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g, 4 °C for 2 h, the synaptosome fraction at the interface of 0.85/1.2 m sucrose was collected, diluted six times with 5 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4), and centrifuged at 80,000 × g, 4 °C for 40 min. The osmotic shock of synaptosomes was done by resuspending the pellet in HEPES buffer and stirring slowly over ice for 15 min. The resulting synaptic membrane fraction was recovered by ultracentrifugation using the sucrose step gradient as outlined above. Protein concentration was determined by Bradford measurement. The obtained synaptic membranes were subjected to trypsin digestion and iTRAQ reagent tagging or quantitative immunoblotting. In two independent 8-plex iTRAQ experiments, we have compared eight WT samples with eight Fmr1 KO samples. The relatively high number of biological replicas (n = 8) facilitates subsequent statistical analysis. The digestion and iTRAQ labeling of the synaptic membranes have been described in previous studies (24Li K.W. Miller S. Klychnikov O. Loos M. Stahl-Zeng J. Spijker S. Mayford M. Smit A.B. J. Proteome Res. 2007; 6: 3127-3133Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 25Klychnikov O.I. Li K.W. Sidorov I.A. Loos M. Spijker S. Broos L.A. Frants R.R. Ferrari M.D. Mayboroda O.A. Deelder A.M. Smit A.B. van den Maagdenberg A.M. Proteomics. 2010; 10: 2531-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In short, for each sample, 75 μg of membrane proteins was solubilized in 28 μl of 0.85% RapiGest (Waters Corp.) reconstituted with dissolution buffer (iTRAQ reagent kit, AB Sciex). A 2-μl cleavage reagent (iTRAQ reagent kit, AB Sciex) was added and incubated at 55 °C for 1 h, after which 1 μl of Cys blocking reagent (iTRAQ reagent kit, AB Sciex) was added and samples were vortexed for 10 min. Subsequently, 5 μg of trypsin (sequencing grade, Promega) was added and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The trypsinized peptides were then tagged with iTRAQ reagents dissolved in 85 μl of ethanol. After incubation for 3 h, the samples were pooled and acidified with 10% trifluoroacetic acid to pH 2.5–3. After 1 h, the sample was centrifuged, and the supernatant was dried in a SpeedVac. We performed two 8-plex iTRAQ experiments to cover the 16 samples. In each iTRAQ experiment, four WT samples were labeled respectively with iTRAQ reagents 113–116 and four Fmr1 KO mice samples were labeled respectively with iTRAQ reagents 117–119 and 121 (Fig. 1). The dried iTRAQ labeled sample was dissolved in 250 μl of loading buffer (20% acetonitrile, 10 mm KH2PO4, pH 2.9), whereas 200 μl was injected into a strong cation exchange column (2.1 × 150-mm PolySULFOETHYL A column, PolyLC Inc.). Peptides were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–500 mm KCl in 20% acetonitrile, 10 mm KH2PO4, pH 2.9, over 25 min at a flow rate of 200 μl/min. Fractions were collected at 1-min intervals and dried in a SpeedVac. The peptides were redissolved in 20 μl of 0.1% TFA, delivered with a FAMOS autosampler at 30 μl/min to a reverse phase C18 trap column (1 mm × 300-μm inner diameter column), and separated on an analytical capillary reverse phase C18 column (150 mm × 100 μm-inner diameter column) at 400 nl/min using the LC-Packing Ultimate system. The peptides were separated using a linear increase in concentration of acetonitrile from 6 to 45% in 50 min and to 90% in 1 min. The eluent was mixed with matrix (7 mg of recrystallized α-cyano-hydroxycinnamic acid in 1 ml of 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA, 10 mm ammonium dicitrate) delivered at a flow rate of 1.5 μl/min and deposited off-line to an Applied Biosystems metal target every 15 s using an automatic robot (Probot, Dionex). The sample was analyzed on an ABI 4800 proteomics analyzer (AB Sciex). Peptide collision induced dissociation was performed at 2 kV; the collision gas was air. MS/MS spectra were each collected from 2500 laser shots. Peptides with signal-to-noise ratio above 50 at the MS mode were selected for an MS/MS experiment; a maximum of 25 MS/MS was allowed per spot. The precursor mass window was 200 relative to resolution (full width at half maximum). To annotate spectra, Mascot (MatrixScience) searches were performed against the SwissProt database (release 12.6) and the larger but more redundant National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database (release 081003) using the GPS Explorer (AB Sciex version 3.6). MS/MS spectra were searched against mouse databases with trypsin specificity and fixed iTRAQ modifications at lysine residues and N termini of the peptides. Mass tolerance was 150 ppm for precursor ions and 0.5 Da for fragment ions; one missed cleavage was allowed. The false discovery rate (percentage) for peptide identification was calculated using a randomized database. Protein redundancy in the result files was removed by clustering the precursor protein sequences at a threshold of 90% sequence similarity over 85% of the sequence length (blastclust, version 20041205). Subsequently, all peptides were matched against the protein clusters; those that were matched to more than one protein cluster were not considered for protein identification and quantification, leaving only “unique” peptides in the analysis. Only proteins identified with at least two peptides with a confidence interval ≥95% (AB Sciex CI, percentage) were considered identified, and of these proteins, only those with three or more quantifiable peptides in both iTRAQ experiments were included in subsequent quantitative analyses. Peak areas for each iTRAQ signature peak (m/z 113.1, 114.1, 115.1, 116.1, 117.1, 118.1, 119.1, 121.1) were obtained and corrected according to the manufacturers' instructions to account for the differences in isotopic overlap. To compensate for the possible variations in the starting amounts of the samples, the individual peak areas of each iTRAQ signature peak were log 2-transformed and normalized to the total peak area of the signature peak. Peptides with iTRAQ signature peaks of less than 2000 were not considered for quantification. Within each experiment, for each peptide, the peak area in each sample was mean-centered. Protein averages were calculated from these mean-centered peak areas of multiple peptides. Finally, the eight mutant and eight wild type protein means of both experiments were used to calculate the average difference between WT and Fmr1 KO mice. To assess whether this difference had occurred by chance due to the multiple testing problem or could be deemed significant, we calculated the permutation-derived false discovery rate (q-value) using the Excel plug-in of the Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) program (26Tusher V.G. Tibshirani R. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (9648) Google Scholar, 27Roxas B.A. Li Q. BMC Bioinformatics. 2008; 9: 187Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The settings for the SAM program were: two class unpaired, log 2-scaled, t-statistic, 1000 permutations, automatic estimation of s0 factor, 10 k-nearest neighbors. Samples were mixed with SDS sample buffer and heated to 90 °C for 5 min. Proteins were separated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel in a Mini-PROTEAN electrophoresis system (Bio-Rad) and electroblotted onto the PVDF membrane overnight at 40 V. Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies followed by an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (Dako; 1:1000). The signal was developed with ECF substrate (GE Healthcare); the image was scanned with an FLA 5000 instrument (Fujifilm) and analyzed with Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). The following antibodies were used: mouse anti-calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II subunit β (Zymed Laboratories Inc.; 1:1000), mouse anti-PSD-95 (Abcam; 1:1000), mouse anti-glutamate receptor (NMDAR1) (BD Biosciences; 1:1000), rabbit anti-syntaxin 1B (gift from M. Verhage; 1:1000), rabbit anti-synaptophysin (gift from M. Verhage; 1:2000), rabbit anti-synapsin I and II (gift from M. Verhage; 1:1000), rabbit anti-NAP-22 (Basp1) (Chemicon; 1:1000), rabbit anti-BM88 (Cend1; gift from R. Matsas; 1:2000), and mouse anti-β-catenin (BD Biosciences; 1:1000). Mice (n = 3/genotype) were subjected to transcardiac perfusion with a mixture of glutaraldehyde (2.5%) and paraformaldehyde (4%) in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4. From the fixed brain, 50-μm-thick coronal slices containing the stratum radiatum were post-fixed (1% OsO4) and stained with 1% uranyl acetate. After embedding in Epon, ultrathin sections (∼90 nm) were collected on 400-mesh copper grids and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. For each condition, docked vesicles, total vesicle number, postsynaptic density (PSD), active zone (AZ) length, and vesicle cluster surface (nm2) were measured on digital images taken at 100,000× magnification using software in individual electron micrographs, in which a single synapse was counted from each of the three perfusion-fixed mice per genotype using a Jeol (Peabody, MA) 1010 electron microscope. The observer was blind to genotype during the procedure. Horizontal hippocampal brain slices (300 μm thick) were prepared from 13–15-day-old WT and Fmr1 KO mice. Brains were rapidly removed and dissected in ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid containing (in mm): 125 NaCl; 3 KCl; 1.25 NaH2PO4; 3 MgSO4; 1 CaCl2; 26 NaHCO3; 10 glucose (∼300 mosm). Slices were cut on a vibrating microtome and placed in artificial cerebrospinal fluid in a submerged-style holding chamber, bubbled with carbogen (95% O2, 5% CO2) containing the following (in mm): 125 NaCl; 3 KCl; 1.25 NaH2PO4; 1 MgSO4; 2 CaCl2; 26 NaHCO3; 10 glucose. Slices were left for 1 h to recover before recording began. Tetrodotoxin (1 μm) was added to the recording artificial cerebrospinal fluid (same as holding chamber), and slices were perfused in a submerged recording chamber at 28–32 °C. SR-95531 (gabazine, 10 μm, Tocris) was added to the bath to block GABAA receptor-mediated synaptic currents. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were made from pyramidal cells in the CA1 region under visual guidance by differential interference contrast microscopy. Patch pipettes (3–5 megaohms) were pulled from standard-wall borosilicate tubing and were filled with intracellular solution containing the following (in mm): 140 potassium gluconate; 9 KCl; 10 HEPES; 4 K2-phosphocreatine; 4 ATP (magnesium salt); 0.4 GTP (pH 7.2–7.3, pH adjusted with KOH; 290–300 mosm). For recording mEPSCs, cells were held in a voltage clamp and recorded for on average 8 min at −70 mV. Events were analyzed using Mini Analysis (Synaptosoft, NJ) with event detection levels for synaptic currents set at 8 pA. Rise and decay times were calculated from average event fits. Statistical comparisons were made using analyses of variance with post hoc t tests and Levene's analysis of variance as appropriate in SPSS software with p values < 0.05 being considered statistically significant. Synaptic current parameters are reported as mean ± S.E. Horizontal hippocampal brain slices (300 μm thick) were prepared from 14–18-day-old WT and Fmr1 KO mice, and CA1 pyramidal cells were selected and recorded as described previously for mEPSCs but without the addition of tetrodotoxin to artificial cerebrospinal fluid. Patch pipettes were filled with intracellular solution containing the following (in mm): 129 cesium gluconate; 1 CsCl; 10 HEPES; 4 K2-phosphocreatine; 10 tetraethylammonium; 4 ATP (magnesium salt); and 0.4 GTP (pH 7.2–7.3, pH adjusted to 7.3 with CsOH; 290–300 mosm). After whole-cell configuration, the membrane potential was held at −70 mV, and the internal solution was allowed to diffuse for 5 min into the cell prior to the onset of recording. The low intracellular chloride concentration in the pipette allowed identification and exclusion of experiments in which inhibitory events occurred close to the EPSCs measured. Schaffer collateral fibers were stimulated using an extracellular electrode positioned in the stratum radiatum on the CA3 side. Moderate stimulation was used to measure synaptic facilitation or depression in response to presynaptic trains (of up to 10 pulses) over a range of frequencies (5–50 Hz). For each frequency, the stimulus train was repeated 20 times, with a 15-s delay between each sweep. Sweeps at each frequency were equally divided into two groups, one at the start and one at the end of the experiment, allowing time-dependent changes in the responses to be identified. Synaptic currents sampled at intervals of 100 μs were digitized and analyzed off-line as described previously (28Meredith R.M. Holmgren C.D. Weidum M. Burnashev N. Mansvelder H.D. Neuron. 2007; 54: 627-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). To assess significance, analysis of variance with repeated measures was used (for within subjects effect test, Huynh-Feldt was used after Mauchly's test for sphericity) as well as post hoc unpaired Student's t test. Data are given as mean ± S.E., with p < 0.05 indicating significance. To reveal the molecular basis of synapse dysfunction that underlies the FXS phenotype, we compared the proteomes of the synaptic membrane fractions of hippocampus from Fmr1 KO and WT mice. In previous studies, we showed the robustness of the synaptic proteome to resist perturbation, which argues for the use of a large sample size to detect subtle changes (24Li K.W. Miller S.

Therefore, we analyzed eight independent pools of both Fmr1 KO and WT mice. Altogether ∼50,000 MS/MS analyses were performed, and 347 proteins were identified with at least two distinct peptides with a confidence of ≥95% present in both iTRAQ experiments. The false discovery rate (percentage) for peptide identification using randomized database from NCBI and SwissProt was about 2% (the false discovery rate from the first iTRAQ experiment is 1.6% for NCBI and 2.1% for SwissProt; for the second iTRAQ experiment, it is 1.9 and 2.1%, respectively). As iTRAQ-based quantitation relies on the iTRAQ signature peak intensities generated from MS/MS analysis of a single selected parent ion, the presence of a co-eluting but distinct peptide of similar mass would contribute to the noise depending on the intensity and mass difference of the interfering peptide. For the sake of increased reliability of quantification of protein abundance, we focused on proteins with ≥3 distinct peptides in both iTRAQ experiments (n = 205, supplemental Table 1). The observed -fold changes were low with the largest difference of 1.24-fold (Table 1; log 2 = 0.31), but these were similar as observed previously for relevant biological changes (29Van den Oever M.C.

BMC Bioinformatics. 2008; 9: 187Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) with false discovery rate <5%, 23 proteins were considered to be significantly different between KO and WT mice. Among them, several presynaptic proteins were present, including syntaxin, synapsin, synaptophysin, piccolo, Rab3A, and vacuolar proton pump subunit E, as well as proteins involved in cell differentiation/neurite outgrowth including Cend1, Basp1, and Gap43.TABLE 1Proteins with significant changes in the hippocampal synaptic membrane fraction of Fmr1 KO miceUniProt accession numberProtein name% of coverage of the proteinNo. of peptides CI ≥ 95%Difference KO-WT (log 2 scale)Standard deviation KO-WT (log 2 scale)q-value (%) using SAMCell differentiation/neurite outgrowthQ91XV3Brain acid-soluble protein 158.1110.310.200.00Q9JKC6Cell cycle exit and neuronal differentiation protein 161.370.270.180.00Q02248Catenin β-131.119−0.160.120.00P18760Cofilin-155.770.130.110.00P06837Gap4386.8140.230.230.00Presynaptic transmissionP61264Syntaxin-1B252.6110.160.140.00P63011Ras-related protein Rab-3A30.350.150.130.00Q9QYX7Protein piccolo8.1170.130.121.80O88935Synapsin-146.1220.110.123.50Q62277Synaptophysin21.050.120.143.50Q9DBG3AP-2 complex subunit β-18.650.150.193.50P50518Vacuolar ATP synthase subunit E47.690.180.140.00Mitochondrial/metabolic proteinsQ9CR68Ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase iron-sulfur subunit30.270.150.120.00O35143ATPase inhibitor, mitochondrial precursor28.030.190.150.00Q9WUA36-Phosphofructokinase type C16.980.130.100.00Q9CQ69Ubiquinone-binding protein QP-C54.250.170.170.00P17182α-Enolase29.2100.140.151.80P05064Fructose-bisphosphate aldolase A74.2190.130.141.80P16858Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase43.4110.120.111.80Q9CPQ8ATP synthase subunit g, mitochondrial59.640.140.131.80OtherP17742Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase A81.2110.170.140.00P05132cAMP-dependent protein kinase, α-catalytic subunit15.330.180.180.00P58252Elongation factor 215.050.180.150.00 Open table in a new tab Quantitati"

Cholesterol promotes the formation and endocytosis of NPC1L1-flotillin-cholesterol membrane microdomains, which is an early step in cholesterol uptake. How cholesterol is sensed in this step is unknown. Here, we find that the N-terminal domain (NTD) of NPC1L1 binds cholesterol. Mutation of residue Leu-216 in NPC1L1-NTD eliminates cholesterol binding, decreases the formation of NPC1L1-flotillin-cholesterol membrane microdomains, and prevents NPC1L1-mediated cholesterol uptake in culture cells and mice livers. NPC1L1-NTD specifically binds cholesterol but not plant sterols, which may account for the selective cholesterol absorption in intestine. Furthermore, 25- or 27-hydroxycholesterol competes with cholesterol to bind NPC1L1-NTD and inhibits the cholesterol induced endocytosis of NPC1L1. Together, these results demonstrate that plasma membrane-localized NPC1L1 binds exogenous cholesterol via its NTD, and facilitates the formation of NPC1L1-flotillin-cholesterol membrane microdomains that are then internalized into cells through the clathrin-AP2 pathway.

In the current study, we report that the NPC1L1-NTD binds cholesterol. This cholesterol-binding activity is crucial for NPC1L1-mediated cholesterol uptake, biliary cholesterol reabsorption, and the formation of NPC1L1-flotillin-cholesterol membrane microdomains. Moreover, plant sterols, including β-sitosterol and stigmasterol, cannot bind to NPC1L1-NTD, providing a mechanism for the preferential absorption of cholesterol in intestine over plant sterols. In addition, 25- and 27-hydroxycholesterol compete with cholesterol to bind NPC1L1-NTD and inhibit the endocytosis of NPC1L1 by preventing the formation of cholesterol-enriched membrane microdomains, suggesting a possible role of oxysterols in the regulation of cholesterol absorption.

The plasmids encoding the mutated version of NPC1L1-EGFP and the plasmid of NPC1L1ΔNTD (Δaa 18–260)-EGFP were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange II XL, Stratagene). The NTD (aa 1–280; aa 1–17 comprise the signal peptide sequence) of human NPC1L1 was constructed by standard PCR amplified from the plasmid encoding the full-length NPC1L1-EGFP. Eight histidine residues were linked to the C terminus of NPC1L1-NTD during the PCR. The DNA fragments encoding NPC1L1-NTD-His8 were ligated into the pCMV-3×FLAG-14 vector (Sigma). The plasmid encodes the NPC1L1-NTD followed by eight histidines and three FLAGs at the C terminus. Mutants of the NTD were produced by site-directed mutagenesis from NPC1L1-NTD-His8-FLAG. For generation of the GST-NTD-His6-encoding plasmids, pGEX-4T-3 vector (Amersham Biosciences) was modified by inserting the DNA sequence encoding six histidines. Then the DNA fragments encoding the wild-type human NPC1L1 (20–280 aa) were amplified and inserted between the GST and the six histidines of the modified pGEX-4T-3 vector; so the expressed protein has a GST tag at the N terminus and six histidines at the C terminus. All the constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Buffer A contained PBS plus 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 0.5% (w/v) digitonin. Buffer B contained 0.2 m glycine-HAc (pH2.9). Buffer C contained 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 9.5). Buffer D contained PBS plus 0.001% (w/v) Nonidet P-40. Buffer E contained PBS plus 0.002% (w/v) Nonidet P-40. Buffer F contained PBS plus 0.001% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, and 250 mm imidazole. Medium A contained DMEM containing 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. Medium B contained medium A supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Medium C contained medium A supplemented with 5% lipoprotein-deficient serum, 10 μm compactin, and 50 μm mevalonate. Cholesterol-depleting medium was medium C supplemented with 1.5% (w/v) methyl-β-cyclodextrin. Cholesterol-replenishing medium contained medium C supplemented with 37.5 μm cholesterol/methyl-β-cyclodextrin. The cholesterol/methyl-β-cyclodextrin inclusion complexes were prepared as described previously (4Ge L. Wang J. Qi W. Miao H.H. Cao J. Qu Y.X. Li B.L. Song B.L.

HEK293T and CRL1601 were maintained in medium B, and CRL1601-NPC1L1-EGFP and CRL1601-NPC1L1ΔNTD-EGFP were maintained in medium B supplemented with 200 μg/ml G418. Transfection of cells with FuGENE HD was performed according to the manufacturer's manual. All animals were maintained and used in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences.

The proteins of GST-NPC1L1-NTD-His6, GST-NPC1L1-NTD(L216A)-His6, or GST-His6 were produced in Escherichia coli (BL21, Invitrogen) and purified under non-denaturing conditions, using glutathione-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow affinity chromatography (GE Healthcare), as recommended by the manufacturer (22Chen H.Y.

For examination of [3H]cholesterol binding to recombinant NPC1L1-NTDs (WT or L216A), a final volume of 100 μl of buffer D containing 4 pmol of purified proteins, 1 μg of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and indicated concentrations of [3H]cholesterol delivered in ethanol were incubated for 24 h at 4 °C. Then the protein was precipitated by Ni-NTA spin column (Qiagen), and washed with 6 ml of Buffer D. The bound [3H]cholesterol was eluted with buffer F, and then quantified by scintillation counting. Binding background was determined by incubating the proteins with the indicated concentrations [3H]cholesterol in the presence of a large excess of unlabeled cholesterol. In each experiment, all tubes received the same amount of ethanol. For determination of 25-hydroxycholesterol binding, similar procedures were carried out. The procedure of purification of the secreted NPC1L1-NTD variants was similar to previous report (15Kwon H.J. Abi-Mosleh L. Wang M.L. Deisenhofer J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Infante R.E.

On day 0, the cells were plated at a density of 6 × 106 cells per 100-mm dish in medium B. On day 2, each dish was transfected with 5 μg of plasmids encoding NPC1L1-NTDs (WT or mutant versions) with the N-terminal signal peptide and His8-FLAG tags at the C terminus. On day 3, each dish was washed with PBS twice, and then switched to 7 ml of medium A containing 1% (v/v) Cellgro ITS (Fisher Scientific) followed by medium collection after 24 h. The procedure was then repeated twice. Then, the media collected from 3 consecutive days were subjected to centrifugation at 2,500 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were concentrated to 1 ml using a 10-kDa Amicon Ultracel filter module (Millipore). The concentrated media was stored at 4 °C. The amount of secreted NPC1L1-NTDs was estimated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis with monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody. A cholesterol binding assay was performed according to previous reports (15Kwon H.J. Abi-Mosleh L. Wang M.L. Deisenhofer J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Infante R.E.

Briefly, 80 μl of Buffer E and 1.6 μg of BSA were mixed with 80 μl of concentrated culture medium from transfected cells and the indicated concentrations of [3H]cholesterol delivered in ethanol. After incubation for 24 h at 4 °C, the bound [3H]cholesterol was quantified the same as that for binding to the GST fusions. Sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation was performed as previously described (7Ge L. Qi W. Wang L.J. Miao H.H. Qu Y.X. Li B.L. Song B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were homogenized in 0.5 m Na2CO3 (pH 11.0) and sonicated. The 2-ml post-nuclear fractions were collected and mixed 1:1 (v/v) with 90% sucrose (90% sucrose, 25 mm Mes, pH 6.5, and 0.15 m NaCl) and then layered with 2 ml of 35% sucrose, 3 ml of 22% sucrose, and 3 ml of 5% sucrose in 25 mm Mes, 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.25 m Na2CO3 (pH 11.0). After centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 20 h, 24 fractions containing 0.5 ml per sample were collected from the top. The gradient fractions were subjected to immunoblot analysis and cholesterol assay. A cholesterol assay was carried out using the Amplex Red Cholesterol Assay Kit (Invitrogen). The immunofluorescence or filipin staining were performed as previously described (4Ge L. Wang J. Qi W. Miao H.H. Cao J. Qu Y.X. Li B.L. Song B.L. Cell Metab. 2008; 7: 508-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Images were obtained with a Leica TCS SP5 laser confocal scanning microscope. Filipin signals were obtained from the same confocal microscope equipped with a two-photon laser using an excitatory wavelength of 720 nm. Fluorescence quantification was calculated using Image-Pro Plus 5.02, and the detailed procedure was as described previously (4Ge L. Wang J. Qi W. Miao H.H. Cao J. Qu Y.X. Li B.L. Song B.L.

The NPC1L1-NTD (aa 18–287; aa 1–17 comprise the signal peptide sequence) shows 47% homology with NPC1-NTD. To directly assess whether the NPC1L1-NTD binds cholesterol, we prepared recombinant NPC1L1-NTD protein from E. coli (Fig. 1A) and performed in vitro [3H]cholesterol binding assay. The binding of [3H]cholesterol to NPC1L1-NTD was saturable with a Kd of ∼170 nm (Fig. 1B), which is comparable to the Kd of NPC1-NTD-cholesterol binding (14Infante R.E. Radhakrishnan A. Abi-Mosleh L. Kinch L.N. Wang M.L. Grishin N.V. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1064-1075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the binding curve is sigmoidal with a calculated Hill coefficient of 1.8, suggesting a positive cooperative association between NPC1L1-NTD and cholesterol. We further performed cross-linking experiments, and the results showed that NPC1L1-NTD forms a species with the molecular mass of ∼130 kDa, which is 4-fold of the NTD itself (32 kDa) (supplemental Fig. S1). Thus, these data indicate that, in our experimental conditions, the NPC1L1-NTD predominantly forms a tetramer and cholesterol binding to the tetramer shows a positive cooperative effect. To gain more insight into the NPC1L1-NTD-cholesterol interaction, homology modeling of the human NPC1L1-NTD based on the established crystal structure of human NPC1-NTD (PDB: 3GKI) was performed (supplemental Fig. S2, A–C) (15Kwon H.J. Abi-Mosleh L. Wang M.L. Deisenhofer J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Infante R.E. Cell. 2009; 137: 1213-1224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). The predicted structure of NPC1L1-NTD with cholesterol revealed the enclosure of the cholesterol tetracyclic ring in the binding pocket analogous to that of NPC1-NTD. In the modeling structure, there are 15 residues surrounding the cholesterol binding pocket, which may contribute to the cholesterol binding (supplemental Fig. S2A, blue asterisks, and supplemental Fig. S2D). To investigate the importance of these residues, 13 single-point mutations and one double mutation of Gly-210 to Asn-211 to alanine were introduced individually into the full-length NPC1L1. Eight of these mutations (supplemental Fig. S2, gray dots) showed endoplasmic reticulum co-localization with calnexin (an endoplasmic reticulum marker) and could not be targeted to the ERC (not co-localized with ERC marker rab11a) (24Ullrich O. Reinsch S. Urbé S. Zerial M. Parton R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar), suggesting that they are misfolded (supplemental Figs. S3 and S4). However, the other six mutants (I105A, T128A, F205A, G210A-N211A, P215A, and L216A) could correctly fold and be transported to the ERC, the compartment where mature NPC1L1 arrives (25Wang L.J. Wang J. Li N. Ge L. Li B.L. Song B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 7397-7408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) (supplemental Figs. S3 and S4). So these six mutants of NPC1L1-NTD were individually generated, and their cholesterol-binding activities were examined. Five of the six NPC1L1-NTD mutants, including I105A, F205A, G210A-N211A, P215A, and L216A showed dramatically decreased cholesterol binding to <50% of that of WT (Fig. 1C). Only the NPC1L1-NTD (T128A) bound [3H]cholesterol similarly to NPC1L1-NTD (WT) (Fig. 1C). Because L216A showed the lowest cholesterol-binding activity, we used it as a representative mutation in the following experiments. A detailed binding assay with increasing concentrations of [3H]cholesterol confirmed that Leu-216 is critical for cholesterol binding (Fig. 1E). To examine the role of cholesterol binding by NTD in NPC1L1-mediated cholesterol uptake, EGFP-fused NPC1L1, NPC1L1ΔNTD, and the six NPC1L1 mutants were expressed in CRL1601 cells. After cholesterol depletion, they all localized to the PM, suggesting the transport of NPC1L1 from ERC to PM is not affected by deletion of NTD or point mutations (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, after cholesterol replenishment, NPC1L1ΔNTD and the five cholesterol binding-deficient mutants (I105A, F205A, G210A-N211A, P215A, and L216A) were unable to be internalized or promote cholesterol uptake comparing with wild-type NPC1L1 (Fig. 2). On the contrary, the T128A mutant that retains cholesterol-binding ability showed normal endocytosis and promotion of cholesterol uptake (Fig. 2). Thus, these data suggest that the cholesterol binding by NTD is required for NPC1L1 endocytosis and it mediated cholesterol uptake. In mice, NPC1L1 is mainly expressed in the small intestine, whereas it is highly expressed in both liver and intestine in humans (3Altmann S.W. Davis Jr., H.R. Zhu L.J. Yao X. Hoos L.M. Tetzloff G.

Previous studies have shown that the exogenously expressed NPC1L1-EGFP in mice liver facilitates biliary cholesterol reabsorption (2Temel R.E. Tang W. Ma Y. Rudel L.L. Willingham M.C. Ioannou Y.A. Davies J.P. Nilsson L.M. Yu L. J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 1968-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 7Ge L. Qi W. Wang L.J. Miao H.H. Qu Y.X. Li B.L. Song B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To determine the role of NTD in NPC1L1-mediated cholesterol uptake in vivo, we expressed EGFP, NPC1L1(WT)-EGFP, NPC1L1ΔNTD-EGFP, and NPC1L1(L216A)-EGFP in mice liver using an adenovirus system (Fig. 3A). The NPC1L1-EGFP co-localized with Mrp2 (Fig. 3B), a liver apical membrane marker, indicating it localizes on the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes in liver (27Nies A.T. Cantz T. Brom M. Leier I. Keppler D. Hepatology. 1998; 28: 1332-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Deletion of NTD (NPC1L1ΔNTD) or L216A mutation did not affect the canalicular membrane targeting of NPC1L1 (Fig. 3B). Comparing with EGFP overexpression mice, the biliary cholesterol from NPC1L1-EGFP overexpression mice was greatly decreased, whereas liver and plasma cholesterol was increased. For mice expressing NPC1L1ΔNTD-EGFP or NPC1L1(L216A)-EGFP, their biliary cholesterol was higher and their liver and plasma cholesterol was lower than those of NPC1L1(WT)-EGFP expression mice (Fig. 3, C, F, and H). As controls, the biliary phospholipids, bile acids, liver phospholipids, or plasma triglycerides (Fig. 3, D, E, G, and I) of different groups were not changed. These data indicate that deletion or mutation of NTD hampers the cholesterol binding and impairs NPC1L1-mediated cholesterol reabsorption in mice liver. Our previous work has shown that NPC1L1 associates with flotillins to form cholesterol-enriched membrane microdomains (NPC1L1-flotillin-cholesterol membrane microdomains), and they are essential for efficient cholesterol uptake. These membrane microdomains are characterized by their distribution in low density fractions (LDFs) in the sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation assay. Formation of these microdomains occurs upstream of clathrin recruitment and is required for the endocytosis of NPC1L1 (7Ge L. Qi W. Wang L.J. Miao H.H. Qu Y.X. Li B.L. Song B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To understand the role of cholesterol binding in this process, we investigated whether cholesterol binding of NTD affects the formation of NPC1L1-flotillin-cholesterol membrane microdomains by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. The NPC1L1(WT) mainly distributed in LDF, and its expression led to the increased LDF distribution of both flotillins and cholesterol compared with control cells, indicating the formation of NPC1L1-flotillin-cholesterol membrane microdomains (Fig. 4, A–C). In contrast, NPC1L1ΔNTD and NPC1L1(L216A) were mainly present in high density fractions (HDFs) and failed to increase the distribution of flotillins or cholesterol in LDF (Fig. 4, A–C). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that NPC1L1ΔNTD barely associated with clathrin heavy chain, although it still bound flotillins similarly to NPC1L1 (Fig. 4D), suggesting NTD is not involved in the association between NPC1L1 and flotillins but is required for the formation of cholesterol-enriched membrane microdomain. These data indicate that loss of the cholesterol-binding ability of NTD impairs the formation of NPC1L1-flotillin-cholesterol membrane microdomains and, therefore, impedes the NPC1L1 endocytosis and cholesterol uptake. We next performed competition experiments to test the sterol-binding specificity of NPC1L1-NTD (Fig. 5A). In the sterols tested, 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC) and 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-HC) but not β-sitosterol or stigmasterol competed with [3H]cholesterol for the binding to NPC1L1-NTD (Fig. 5B), suggesting that 25-HC and 27-HC may bind to NPC1L1-NTD, whereas β-sitosterol and stigmasterol may not. Meanwhile, the cholesterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe, which has been shown to bind the second large luminal loop of NPC1L1 (28Weinglass A.B. Kohler M. Schulte U. Liu J. Nketiah E.O. Thomas A. Schmalhofer W. Williams B. Bildl W. McMasters D.R. Dai K. Beers L. McCann M.E. Kaczorowski G.J. Garcia M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Kohler M. Schulte U. Liu J. Nketiah E.O. Thomas A. Schmalhofer W. Williams B. Bildl W. McMasters D.R. Dai K. Beers L. McCann M.E. Kaczorowski G.J. Garcia M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 8132-8137Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). β-Sitosterol and stigmasterol lacked the activity to promote the endocytosis of NPC1L1 (Fig. 5C) similar to a previous report (4Ge L. Wang J. Qi W. Miao H.H. Cao J. Qu Y.X. Li B.L. Song B.L. Cell Metab. 2008; 7: 508-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Because mammals selectively absorb cholesterol but not plant sterols from diet (30Schoenheimer R. Science. 1931; 74: 579-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 31Glover J. Morton R.A. Br. Med. Bull. 1958; 14: 226-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), the cholesterol-binding specificity by NPC1L1-NTD may account for the cholesterol absorption specificity. Although both 25-HC and 27-HC bound to NPC1L1-NTD (Fig. 5B), neither of them could efficiently induce the endocytosis of NPC1L1 (Fig. 5C). This is probably because the hydroxyl group on the isooctyl chain of 25-HC and 27-HC interferes with their insertion into the membrane to form the functional membrane microdomain. In co-immunoprecipitation experiments, cholesterol, but not 25-HC or β-sitosterol, could induce the interaction between NPC1L1 and clathrin-AP2 (Fig. 5E). A detailed [3H]25-HC binding assay and a competition assay confirmed that 25-HC bound NPC1L1-NTD and competed off cholesterol binding to NPC1L1-NTD (Fig. 6, A and B). Similar to that of cholesterol binding, the binding curve of 25-HC is sigmoidal with a Hill coefficient of 2.5, suggesting a positive cooperativity. We next sought to determine whether competing with cholesterol binding to NPC1L1-NTD could interfere with the endocytosis of NPC1L1 induced by cholesterol. As shown in Fig. 6C, cholesterol replenishment promoted NPC1L1 endocytosis, which could be blocked by 25-HC or 27-HC but not β-sitosterol or stigmasterol. As a control, ezetimibe also inhibited the NPC1L1 endocytosis that has been shown before (4Ge L. Wang J. Qi W. Miao H.H. Cao J. Qu Y.X. Li B.L. Song B.L. Cell Metab. 2008; 7: 508-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). 25-HC but not β-sitosterol abolished cholesterol-induced interaction between NPC1L1 and clathrin-AP2 (Fig. 6E). But none of them had effect on NPC1L1-flotillin interaction (Fig. 6E). Moreover, 25-HC interfered with the formation of NPC1L1-flotillin-cholesterol membrane microdomains (Fig. 6, F–H). In summary, these data suggest that 25-HC or 27-HC competes with cholesterol to bind NPC1L1-NTD and impairs the formation of NPC1L1-flotillin-cholesterol membrane microdomains, thereby inhibiting NPC1L1 internalization. In the current study, we found that the NTD of NPC1L1 binds cholesterol. Homology modeling and alanine scanning followed by an in vitro cholesterol binding assay suggested the structural basis for the cholesterol binding of NPC1L1-NTD. We also demonstrated that cholesterol binding by NPC1L1-NTD is essential for NPC1L1-mediated cholesterol uptake in culture cells and mice livers. It has been known for a long time that mammals absorb cholesterol specifically. About 50% of cholesterol passing the intestine is absorbed, whereas only <5% of plant sterols is taken up (30Schoenheimer R. Science. 1931; 74: 579-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 31Glover J. Morton R.A. Br. Med. Bull. 1958; 14: 226-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Our previous studies showed that NPC1L1 prefers to mediate cholesterol uptake rather than plant sterols (4Ge L. Wang J. Qi W. Miao H.H. Cao J. Qu Y.X. Li B.L. Song B.L. Cell Metab. 2008; 7: 508-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The molecular basis on the sterol selectivity is unknown. Here we found that the binding of [3H]cholesterol to NPC1L1-NTD is efficiently competed by oxysterols but not plant sterols (Fig. 5B), indicating that NPC1L1-NTD binds plant sterols poorly. This binding specificity may contribute to the selective cholesterol absorption in mammals. The efficiency of cholesterol absorption is ensured by formation and endocytosis of NPC1L1-flotillin-cholesterol membrane microdomains (7Ge L. Qi W. Wang L.J. Miao H.H. Qu Y.X. Li B.L. Song B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). How is cholesterol enriched in the local membrane around NPC1L1-flotillin to form the cholesterol-enriched microdomains? Here we showed that NPC1L1-NTD binds cholesterol, which is crucial for the formation of cholesterol-enriched membrane microdomains, although the NTD is dispensable for NPC1L1-flotillin interaction (Fig. 4). Given the recent finding that NPC1 binds cholesterol via its NTD and transfers cholesterol to liposome membrane (14Infante R.E. Radhakrishnan A. Abi-Mosleh L. Kinch L.N. Wang M.L. Grishin N.V.

NPC1L1 may bind cholesterol through its own NTD and then transfer cholesterol to the local membrane where NPC1L1 and flotillins reside. Alternatively, the binding of cholesterol to NTD may alter the conformation of NPC1L1 protein to allow the increased cholesterol-loading capacity in the local membrane. In the latter case, other domains of NPC1L1, such as the sterol-sensing domain, may be responsible for holding large amounts of cholesterol together with flotillins. Further studies are necessary to examine these possibilities. An interesting discovery in our study is that 25- and 27-HC can compete with cholesterol to bind NPC1L1-NTD. Although the competitive binding of 25- and 27-HC against cholesterol to NPC1-NTD has been reported (14Infante R.E. Radhakrishnan A. Abi-Mosleh L. Kinch L.N. Wang M.L. Grishin N.V. Goldstein J.L.

Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2980) Google Scholar, 33Cheng D. Chang C.C. Qu X. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 685-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). On the other hand, here we show that 25- and 27-HC block the endocytosis of NPC1L1 and inhibit the formation of NPC1L1-flotillin-cholesterol membrane microdomains (Fig. 6). These cellular effects are consistent with their in vitro competition with cholesterol in NPC1L1-NTD binding (Fig. 6). In the future, the possibility that 25- and 27-HC may inhibit cholesterol absorption in vivo can be further verified. It is well known that oxysterols mediate the feedback inhibition of cholesterol synthesis by blocking the cleavage of sterol regulatory element-binding protein and promoting the degradation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (34Goldstein J.L. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Brown M.S. Cell. 2006; 124: 35-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar). Our current data implicate another regulatory role of oxysterols in cholesterol metabolism, i.e. feedback inhibition of cholesterol absorption by competing with cholesterol to bind NPC1L1-NTD. During the review of this study, a report just came out on the crystal structure of NPC1L1-NTD. The authors also showed that [3H]cholesterol efficiently binds NPC1L1-NTD that could be competed by 25-HC (35Kwon H.J. Palnitkar M. Deisenhofer J. PLoS One. 2011; 6: e18722Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This is consistent with our study. Although both 25-HC (or 27-HC) and ezetimibe inhibit the formation of NPC1L1-flotillin-cholesterol membrane microdomains and NPC1L1 endocytosis (Fig. 6) (7Ge L. Qi W. Wang L.J. Miao H.H. Qu Y.X. Li B.L. Song B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), they act through different mechanisms. 25-HC (or 27-HC) competes with cholesterol to bind NPC1L1-NTD (the first large luminal loop), thereby preventing the cholesterol-enriched membrane microdomain formation (Fig. 6). However, ezetimibe binds to the second large luminal loop of NPC1L1, dissociates the interaction between NPC1L1 and flotillins, and therefore blocks NPC1L1-flotillin-cholesterol membrane microdomains assembly (7Ge L.

This finding provides a new way to develop cholesterol absorption inhibitors by searching for compounds binding NPC1L1-NTD, similar to 25-HC and 27-HC. In summary, our study reveal that NPC1L1 senses cholesterol through direct binding by its NTD, then cholesterol may be transferred to local membrane to form the NPC1L1-flotillin-cholesterol membrane microdomain, which is internalized via the clathrin-AP2 pathway. The cholesterol-binding specificity may serve as a molecular basis for selective cholesterol absorption in intestine. Oxysterols may regulate cholesterol uptake by competing cholesterol binding.

Interestingly, G2 peptide isolated against 3-OS HS displayed wider ability to inhibit entry of clinically relevant strains of HSV-1 and some divergent members of herpesvirus family including cytomegalovirus and human herpesvirus-8. To identify functional residues within G1 and G2, we performed point mutations and alanine-scanning mutagenesis.

These factors are involved in diverse processes in many tissues, including development and differentiation. We report here the characterization of the zinc finger protein ZNF638 as a novel regulator of adipogenesis. ZNF638 is induced early during adipocyte differentiation. Ectopic expression of ZNF638 increases adipogenesis in vitro, whereas its knockdown inhibits differentiation and decreases the expression of adipocyte-specific genes. ZNF638 physically interacts and transcriptionally cooperates with CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) β and C/EBPδ. This interaction leads to the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, which is the key regulator of adipocyte differentiation. In summary, ZNF638 is a novel and early regulator of adipogenesis that works as a transcription cofactor of C/EBPs."

https://openalex.org/W2170502829,"Mechanical ventilation (MV) is a life-saving measure in many critically ill patients. However, prolonged MV results in diaphragm dysfunction that contributes to the frequent difficulty in weaning patients from the ventilator. The molecular mechanisms underlying ventilator-induced diaphragm dysfunction (VIDD) remain poorly understood. We report here that MV induces myonuclear DNA fragmentation (3-fold increase; P<0.01) and selective activation of caspase 9 (P<0.05) and Bcl2-interacting mediator of cell death (Bim; 2- to 7-fold increase; P<0.05) in human diaphragm. MV also statistically significantly down-regulates mitochondrial gene expression and induces oxidative stress. In cultured muscle cells, we show that oxidative stress activates each of the catabolic pathways thought to underlie VIDD: apoptotic (P<0.05), proteasomal (P<0.05), and autophagic (P<0.01). Further, silencing Bim expression blocks (P<0.05) oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. Overlapping the gene expression profiles of MV human diaphragm and H2O2-treated muscle cells, we identify Fos, FoxO1, and Stat3 as regulators of Bim expression as well as of expression of the catabolic markers atrogin and LC3. We thus identify a novel Fos/FoxO1/Stat3-Bim intrinsic apoptotic pathway and establish the centrality of oxidative stress in the development of VIDD.

Therefore, it is possible that AMPK promotes LPA-induced cell migration by regulating dynamic cytoskeletal rearrangement in cancer cells. In this study, we investigated the role of AMPK in LPA-induced cell migration in ovarian cancer cells. We found that LPA activates AMPK through Ca2+-dependent signaling, including PLC-β3 and CaMKKβ. The activation of AMPK is essential for LPA-induced cell migration by modulating the activation of ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) proteins, which are involved in actin filament/plasma membrane interactions, through the Rho pathway. Therefore, these findings provided new insight into the molecular mechanism of AMPK activation in cell migration and indicated that AMPK may be a potential therapeutic target in ovarian cancer. Lysophosphatidic acid (1-oleoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate) was purchased from Avanti Lipid (Alabaster, AL). Anti-phospho-acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) (Ser-79), anti-phospho-AMPK (Thr-172), anti-phospho-ERM, anti-AMPKα1, anti-ACC, and anti-ERM antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Anti-PLC-β3, anti-Rac1, and anti-RhoA antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), and a β-actin antibody and rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from the Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratory (Gaithersburg, MD). Compound C, U73122, STO-609, pertussis toxin, PD98059, and Y27632 were obtained from Calbiochem. Human ovarian cancer SKOV3 and OVCAR3 cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. Human ovarian surface epithelial cell line HIO-80 (immortalized by SV40 large T) was obtained from Dr. Andrew K. Godwin (Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA). SKOV3 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin. OVCAR3 cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS and antibiotics. HIO-80 cells were cultured in a 1:1 mixture of medium 199 (Earle's salts, l-glutamine, 2.2 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 25 mm HEPES) and MCDB-105 (l-glutamine, 25 mm HEPES) with 4% FBS, 0.2 units/ml pork insulin, and antibiotics. All cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Cells were serum-starved overnight prior to treatment with the indicated agents. Whole cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer, as described previously (32Lim S. Jang H.J. Kim J.K. Kim J.M. Park E.H. Yang J.H. Kim Y.H. Yea K. Ryu S.H. Suh P.G. Stem Cells Dev. 2010; PubMed Google Scholar). Lysates were then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE (8%) gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies and then washed three times in Tris-buffered saline/0.1% Tween 20 prior to 1 h incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies at room temperature. Proteins were then detected via ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). siRNA duplexes directed against LPA2 (nucleotides 867–885), PLC-β3 (nucleotides 483–501), AMPKα1, and CaMKKβ were synthesized or purchased from Dharmacon, Inc. (Lafayette, CO). The presynthesized control siRNA duplexes (luciferase GL3 duplex) were also purchased and used as control oligonucleotides. The cells were transfected with 20 nm siRNA using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) in serum-free conditions. After 4 h of transfection, the cells were washed and supplemented with fresh medium containing 10% FBS. The cells were incubated for 48 h prior to use. Chemotactic directional migration was evaluated using a modified Boyden chamber (Neuroprobe, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Porous filters (8 μm) were coated by passive adsorption of type I collagen (Sigma) by incubation with 20 μg/ml collagen in 0.1 m acetic acid overnight at 4 °C. Cells (2 × 104) were plated in the upper chamber in medium containing 1 μm LPA with or without agents (pertussis toxin, U73122, STO-609, compound C, PD98059, or Y27632) as indicated and allowed to migrate for 4 h. Non-migrating cells were removed from the upper chamber with a cotton swab, whereas migrating cells adherent to the underside of the filter were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeated with 0.2% Triton X-100, and stained with Hoechst 33342 solution. The migrated cells were photographed and quantified by fluorescent microscopy at a magnification of 100× by counting the stained cells from three randomly chosen high power fields. The mean values obtained from vehicle-treated cells were expressed as 1.0, and others were relative values. Each value is expressed as the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments performed in triplicate. Control or AMPKα1 siRNA-transfected SKOV3 or OVCAR3 cells (2 × 105) were seeded on a type I collagen-coated 35-mm dish and incubated for 24 h until a confluent monolayer was formed. Cells were incubated overnight in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 0.1% (w/v) BSA. The cell monolayer was then scratched with a pipette tip. Subsequently, cells were washed twice with PBS, and the migration of cells into the wound area was induced by treatment of 1 μm LPA. For kinetic analysis, two individual fields of the wound area on a 35-mm dish were photographed at 12 h post-wounding. The assay was performed as described previously (33Choi J.W. Lim S. Oh Y.S. Kim E.K. Kim S.H. Kim Y.H. Heo K. Kim J. Kim J.K. Yang Y.R. Ryu S.H. Suh P.G. Cell. Signal. 2010; 22: 1153-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Control or LPA2 siRNA-transfected SKOV3 cells were seeded into six-well plates at 2 × 105 cells/well for 24 h. Upon serum deprivation for 24 h to reach quiescence, the cells were treated with LPA. After 18 h incubation, cells were pulse-labeled with [3H]thymidine (0.8 μCi/ml) for 6 h. The pulse-labeled cells were followed by three quick washes with PBS to remove the remaining unincorporated labels and then fixed with ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid for 15 min at 4 °C. The fixed cells were then lysed with 0.4 N NaOH with 1% SDS, and the radioactivity was counted by a scintillation counter. The activation of RhoA or Rac1 was measured using the GST-Rho binding domain of Rhotekin or GST-Rac binding domain of Pak bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 m NaC1, and 1% Triton X-100), and the lysates were incubated with GST-Rho binding domain of Rhotekin or GST-Rac binding domain of Pak beads at 4 °C for 40 min. The beads were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with washing buffer (25 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mm DTT, 30 mm MgCl2, 40 mm NaCl, and 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40). Proteins were eluted from beads by boiling in 2× sample buffer for 5 min. The precipitates were analyzed with antibodies specific for RhoA or Rac1. To equalize the cellular proteins in each sample, total cell lysates were also run on gels and subjected to Western blot analysis. cDNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed from 3 μg of total cellular RNA prepared using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's method, using oligo(dT) primers and murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI). Amplification parameters were as follows: 30 s at 94 °C for denaturation, 30 s at 58 °C for primer annealing, and 30 s at 72 °C for polymerization. PCRs were performed for 35 cycles. The same amount of cDNA was amplified for 25 cycles using the following specific GAPDH primers. Primer sequences were as follows: LPA1, 5′-ATGGCTGGGAGTTGATTGAG-3′ and 5′-GAAGTTGGTGTCCCGTGTCT-3′; LPA2, 5′-TTGTCTTCCTGCTCATGGTG-3′ and 5′-CTCGGCAAGAGTACACAGCA-3′; LPA3, 5′-CTCATGGCCTTCCTCATCAT-3′ and 5′-GCCATACATGTCCTCGTCCT-3′; GAPDH, 5′-CCATGACAACTTTGGCATTG-3′ and 5′-CCTGCTTCACCACCTTCTTG-3′; CaMKKβ, 5′-GCAGGTGTACCAGGAAATTG-3′ and 5′-CTTCCCAGAGAAGATCTTGCG-′3. For real-time quantitative RT-PCR, total RNA (100 ng) was amplified with a One Step SYBR RT-PCR kit using a LightCycler 2.0 PCR system (Roche). PCR conditions consisted of a 10-min hot start at 95 °C, followed by 45 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C, 10 s at 60 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C. Expression levels of each mRNA were compared after normalization against the expression of GAPDH. This experiment was repeated three times. Control or AMPKα1 knockdown cells were cultured overnight on 20 μg/ml collagen I-coated coverslips and then treated with 1 μm LPA for 5 min. The cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. The coverslips were washed twice with PBS and blocked with BSA (5%) in tris-buffered saline with tween-20 and permeabilized with PBS containing 1% horse serum and 0.2% Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature. To visualize F-actin, the cells were incubated with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin for 1 h at room temperature and washed four times with PBS. To visualize focal adhesions, permeabilized cells were incubated with p-ERM antibody (1/100) diluted in PBS containing 1% horse serum overnight at 4 °C. The cells were then washed four times with PBS and incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1/500) for 1 h at room temperature. After being washed four times with PBS, cells were then analyzed with a laser-scanning confocal microscope imaging system (Olympus, FV 1000). 293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding control or AMPKα1 shRNA (sequence: CCGGCCTGGAAGTCACACAATAGAACTCGAGTTCTATTGTGTGACTTCCAGGTTTTT) in pLKO vectors (Sigma-Aldrich), vesicular stomatitis virus G and Δ 8.9 for 16 h, after which the medium was replaced. Following 48-h culture, media containing lentiviruses were harvested and used for transduction of target cells for 24 h. Stable cell lines were selected in the presence of 3 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich) and then used for xenograft models. All mice were bred and maintained in specific pathogen-free conditions at the animal facility of the Seoul National University College of Medicine. All animal experiments were performed with the approval of the institutional animal care and use committee of Seoul National University. To assess tumor metastasis of the cancer cells, control knockdown SKOV3 (SKOV3shControl) or AMPKα1 knockdown SKOV3 cells (SKOV3shAMPKα1, 3 × 105) were injected intraperitoneally into 8-week-old NOD/scid/IL-2Rγ−/−(NOG) mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). Eight weeks after the injection, the mice were euthanized, and primary tumor masses in the peritoneum for ovarian cancer, liver, and lung were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h. Sections (4 μm) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The number of tumor masses in the liver and lung was counted under a dissecting microscope. Student's t test was used to compare data between two groups. Values are expressed as means ± S.D. of at least triplicate samples. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Several studies have recently reported that elevated activation of AMPK occurs in human cancer tissues (34Natsuizaka M. Ozasa M. Darmanin S. Miyamoto M. Kondo S. Kamada S. Shindoh M. Higashino F. Suhara W. Koide H. Aita K. Nakagawa K. Kondo T. Asaka M. Okada F. Kobayashi M. Exp. Cell Res. 2007; 313: 3337-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and the molecular mechanisms linking agonist-mediated AMPK regulation are important for cell motility (28Levine Y.C. Li G.K.

Thus, we sought to characterize the phosphorylation of AMPK by LPA known as the chemotatic factor (1Mills G.B. Moolenaar W.H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 582-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar) in SKOV3 ovarian cancer cell lines. The phosphorylation of AMPK was gradually increased and peaked at 2 min after LPA treatment. After 20 min it had returned to basal levels. Consistent with the increase in AMPK activation, the phosphorylation of its substrate, ACC, was also increased in SKOV3 cells (Fig. 1A). Next, we examined whether this phosphorylation of AMPK was cancer-specific. Three different cell lines (SKOV3, OVCAR3, and HIO-80) were prepared, and different doses of LPA (0–10 μm) were applied for 2 min. Both ovarian cancer cell lines, SKOV3 and OVCAR3, showed gradually increased phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC (Fig. 1B). However, HIO-80, a non-cancer ovarian surface epithelial cell line, was not affected by LPA (Fig. 1B). These data showed that LPA increases the phosphorylation of AMPK and its substrate, ACC, in both SKOV3 and OVCAR3 cells. Different responses to LPA for normal and cancer cells might be caused by differential expression of LPA receptors (8Nakamoto T. Yasuda K. Yasuhara M. Yoshimura T. Kinoshita T. Nakajima T. Okada H. Ikuta A. Kanzaki H. J. Obstet. Gynaecol. Res. 2005; 31: 344-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 9Wang P. Wu X. Chen W. Liu J. Wang X. Gynecol. Oncol. 2007; 104: 714-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus, we sought to confirm mRNA expression of LPA receptor subtypes using quantitative real-time PCR. LPA2 and LPA3, but not LPA1, are aberrantly up-regulated in ovarian cancer cells (Fig. 1C). To identify which LPA receptor subtypes is involved in phosphorylation of AMPK, we explored the activation of AMPK in LPA2 or LPA3 knockdown cells. The phosphorylation of AMPK in response to LPA was significantly attenuated by knockdown of LPA2 but not by knockdown of LPA3 (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, to verify the role of LPA2, we assessed the effects of LPA2 knockdown on LPA-induced cell migration and proliferation. Interestingly, the knockdown of LPA2 suppressed LPA-induced cell migration but not cell proliferation (Fig. 1, E and F). These results indicated that phosphorylation of AMPK by LPA is associated with LPA2 activation in ovarian cancer cell migration. Considering the result in Fig. 1, activation of AMPK by LPA might be involved in changes of ovarian cancer cell motility. To define the specific relevance in LPA-induced cell migration, the chemotactic migration assay after transfection with control or AMPKα1 siRNA was accomplished in SKOV3 cells. AMPKα1 siRNA-transfected cells significantly attenuated LPA-induced cell migration compared with control siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 2A) and suppressed LPA-induced phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC (B). In addition, a wound healing assay was used to assess the potential effects of constant doses of LPA on cell migration in vitro. When a confluent monolayer was scratched, the migration of AMPKα1 siRNA-transfected cells into the wounded area was significantly reduced in the presence of LPA compared with control siRNA-transfected cells. We also confirmed that the LPA-induced cell migration was reduced by knockdown of AMPKα1 in OVCAR3 cells, another ovarian cancer cell line, using the wound healing assay (Fig. 2C). These data demonstrated that AMPK acts as a key regulator in LPA-induced cell migration. It has been reported that LPA increases the intracellular calcium concentration in ovarian cancer cells (35Xu Y. Fang X.J. Casey G. Mills G.B. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 933-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) and induces cell migration through Ca2+-dependent Pyk2 activation (16Park S.Y. Schinkmann K.A. Avraham S. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 1063-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Additionally, activation of AMPK is triggered by an increase in the intracellular calcium concentration without detectable changes in the AMP-to-ATP ratio (24Hawley S.A. Pan D.A. Mustard K.J. Ross L. Bain J. Edelman A.M. Frenguelli B.G. Hardie D.G. Cell Metab. 2005; 2: 9-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar). Thus, we wished to characterize a possible Ca2+-dependent signaling pathway responsible for the LPA-induced phosphorylation of AMPK. SKOV3 cells that were incubated with the Gi/o inhibitor pertussis toxin, a PLC inhibitor (U73122), or a specific CaMKK inhibitor (STO-609) were suppressed in the LPA-stimulated phosphorylation of AMPK. This effect was not observed with a selective MEK inhibitor (PD98059) (Fig. 3A). In addition, these inhibitors significantly reduced LPA-induced cell migration (Fig. 3B). Consistent with our results, previous report revealed that PD98059 did not affect LPA-induced cell migration in ovarian cancer cells (17Sawada K. Morishige K. Tahara M. Ikebuchi Y. Kawagishi R. Tasaka K. Murata Y. Gynecol. Oncol. 2002; 87: 252-259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that a ternary complex consisting of the LPA2 receptor NHERF2 and PLC-β3 may play a key role in the LPA-mediated Ca2+ signaling pathway (36Oh Y.S. Jo N.W. Choi J.W. Kim H.S. Seo S.W. Kang K.O. Hwang J.I. Heo K. Kim S.H. Kim Y.H. Kim I.H. Kim J.H. Banno Y. Ryu S.H. Suh P.G. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 5069-5079Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Therefore, AMPK might be regulated by intracellular Ca2+ induced through PLC-β3 activation. To understand the role of PLC-β3 in the LPA-induced activation of AMPK, we explored the activation of AMPK and cell migration in PLC-β3 knockdown cells upon LPA treatment. Knockdown of PLC-β3 abolished the activation of AMPK and cell migration upon LPA treatment (Fig. 3, C and D). In addition, knockdown of CaMKKβ, an upstream AMPK kinase in Ca2+ signaling, severely impaired the LPA-induced activation of AMPK and cell migration (Fig. 3, E and F). These results suggested that Ca2+-dependent signaling, including PLC-β3 and CaMKKβ, is the upstream pathway of LPA-induced AMPK phosphorylation and increases LPA-induced cell migration through the activation of AMPK. Cell migration begins with an initial protrusion or extension of the plasma membrane via cytoskeletal rearrangement. The cytoskeleton is regulated by activation of Rho-GTPases (37Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3875) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2064636251,"Zinc ion (Zn(2+)) is an endogenous allosteric modulator that regulates the activity of a wide variety of ion channels in a reversible and concentration-dependent fashion. Here we used patch clamp recording to study the effects of Zn(2+) on the melastatin transient receptor potential 2 (TRPM2) channel. Zn(2+) inhibited the human (h) TRPM2 channel currents, and the steady-state inhibition was largely not reversed upon washout and concentration-independent in the range of 30-1000 μM, suggesting that Zn(2+) induces channel inactivation. Zn(2+) inactivated the channels fully when they conducted inward currents, but only by half when they passed outward currents, indicating profound influence of the permeant ion on Zn(2+) inactivation. Alanine substitution scanning mutagenesis of 20 Zn(2+)-interacting candidate residues in the outer pore region of the hTRPM2 channel showed that mutation of Lys(952) in the extracellular end of the fifth transmembrane segment and Asp(1002) in the large turret strongly attenuated or abolished Zn(2+) inactivation, and mutation of several other residues dramatically changed the inactivation kinetics. The mouse (m) TRPM2 channels were also inactivated by Zn(2+), but the kinetics were remarkably slower. Reciprocal mutation of His(995) in the hTRPM2 channel and the equivalent Gln(992) in the mTRPM2 channel completely swapped the kinetics, but no such opposing effects resulted from exchanging another pair of species-specific residues, Arg(961)/Ser(958). We conclude from these results that Zn(2+) inactivates the TRPM2 channels and that residues in the outer pore are critical determinants of the inactivation."
https://openalex.org/W2075914256,"Several missense mutations in the von Willebrand Factor (VWF) gene of von Willebrand disease (VWD) patients have been shown to cause impaired constitutive secretion and intracellular retention of VWF. However, the effects of those mutations on the intracellular storage in Weibel-Palade bodies (WPBs) of endothelial cells and regulated secretion of VWF remain unknown. We demonstrate, by expression of quantitative VWF mutants in HEK293 cells, that four missense mutations in the D3 and CK-domain of VWF diminished the storage in pseudo-WPBs, and led to retention of VWF within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy data showed that the pseudo-WPBs formed by missense mutant C1060Y are indistinguishable from those formed by normal VWF. C1149R, C2739Y, and C2754W formed relatively few pseudo-WPBs, which were often short and sometimes round rather than cigar-shaped. The regulated secretion of VWF was impaired slightly for C1060Y but severely for C1149R, C2739Y, and C2754W. Upon co-transfection with wild-type VWF, both intracellular storage and regulated secretion of all mutants were (partly) corrected. In conclusion, defects in the intracellular storage and regulated secretion of VWF following ER retention may be a common mechanism underlying VWD with a quantitative deficiency of VWF."

In plant pathogenic bacteria, lipopolysaccharides are important virulence factors, and they are being increasingly recognized as major pathogen-associated molecular patterns for plants. In general, three domains are recognized in a lipopolysaccharide: the hydrophobic lipid A, the hydrophilic O-antigen polysaccharide, and the core oligosaccharide, connecting lipid A and O-antigen. In this work, we have determined the structure of purified lipopolysaccharides obtained from Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri wild type and a mutant of the O-antigen ABC transporter encoded by the wzt gene. High pH anion exchange chromatography and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrum analysis were performed, enabling determination of the structure not only of the released oligosaccharides and lipid A moieties but also the intact lipopolysaccharides. The results demonstrate that Xac wild type and Xacwzt LPSs are composed mainly of a penta- or tetra-acylated diglucosamine backbone attached to either two pyrophosphorylethanolamine groups or to one pyrophosphorylethanolamine group and one phosphorylethanolamine group. The core region consists of a branched oligosaccharide formed by Kdo2Hex6GalA3Fuc3NAcRha4 and two phosphate groups. As expected, the presence of a rhamnose homo-oligosaccharide as O-antigen was determined only in the Xac wild type lipopolysaccharide. In addition, we have examined how lipopolysaccharides from Xac function in the pathogenesis process. We analyzed the response of the different lipopolysaccharides during the stomata aperture closure cycle, the callose deposition, the expression of defense-related genes, and reactive oxygen species production in citrus leaves, suggesting a functional role of the O-antigen from Xac lipopolysaccharides in the basal response.

https://openalex.org/W2019152840,"Precise localization of axonal ion channels is crucial for proper electrical and chemical functions of axons. In myelinated axons, Kv1 (Shaker) voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels are clustered in the juxtaparanodal regions flanking the node of Ranvier. The clustering can be disrupted by deletion of various proteins in mice, including contactin-associated protein-like 2 (Caspr2) and transient axonal glycoprotein-1 (TAG-1), a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell adhesion molecule. However, the mechanism and function of Kv1 juxtaparanodal clustering remain unclear. Here, using a new myelin coculture of hippocampal neurons and oligodendrocytes, we report that tyrosine phosphorylation plays a critical role in TAG-1-mediated clustering of axonal Kv1.2 channels. In the coculture, myelin specifically ensheathed axons but not dendrites of hippocampal neurons and clustered endogenous axonal Kv1.2 into internodes. The trans-homophilic interaction of TAG-1 was sufficient to position Kv1.2 clusters on axonal membranes in a neuron/HEK293 coculture. Mutating a tyrosine residue (Tyr458) in the Kv1.2 C terminus or blocking tyrosine phosphorylation disrupted myelin- and TAG-1-mediated clustering of axonal Kv1.2. Furthermore, Kv1.2 voltage dependence and activation threshold were reduced by TAG-1 coexpression. This effect was eliminated by the Tyr458 mutation or by cholesterol depletion. Taken together, our studies suggest that myelin regulates both trafficking and activity of Kv1 channels along hippocampal axons through TAG-1. Precise localization of axonal ion channels is crucial for proper electrical and chemical functions of axons. In myelinated axons, Kv1 (Shaker) voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels are clustered in the juxtaparanodal regions flanking the node of Ranvier. The clustering can be disrupted by deletion of various proteins in mice, including contactin-associated protein-like 2 (Caspr2) and transient axonal glycoprotein-1 (TAG-1), a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell adhesion molecule.

However, the pathways by which dysregulation of lipid and mineral metabolism simultaneously occur in this particular population remain unclear. We have shown that activation of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) blocks mineralization of bovine calcifying vascular cells (CVCs) and in ApoE knock-out mice with 5/6 nephrectomy. In contrast to FXR, this study showed that liver X receptor (LXR) activation by LXR agonists and adenovirus-mediated LXR overexpression by VP16-LXRα and VP16-LXRβ accelerated mineralization of CVCs. Conversely, LXR inhibition by dominant negative (DN) forms of LXRα and LXRβ reduced calcium content in CVCs. The regulation of mineralization by FXR and LXR agonists was highly correlated with changes in lipid accumulation, fatty acid synthesis, and the expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (SREBP-1). The rate of lipogenesis in CVCs through the SREBP-1c dependent pathway was reduced by FXR activation, but increased by LXR activation. SREBP-1c overexpression augmented mineralization in CVCs, whereas SREBP-1c DN inhibited alkaline phosphatase activity and mineralization induced by LXR agonists. LXR and SREBP-1c activations increased, whereas FXR activation decreased, saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids derived from lipogenesis. In addition, we found that stearate markedly promoted mineralization of CVCs as compared with other fatty acids. Furthermore, inhibition of either acetyl-CoA carboxylase or acyl-CoA synthetase reduced mineralization of CVCs, whereas inhibition of stearoyl-CoA desaturase induced mineralization. Therefore, a stearate metabolite derived from lipogenesis might be a risk factor for the development of vascular calcification.

A crucial issue is to identify mechanisms that trigger hMSC osteoblast differentiation to promote osteogenic potential. Casitas B lineage lymphoma (Cbl) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that ubiquitinates and targets several molecules for degradation. We hypothesized that attenuation of Cbl-mediated degradation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) may promote osteogenic differentiation in hMSCs. We show here that specific inhibition of Cbl interaction with RTKs using a Cbl mutant (G306E) promotes expression of osteoblast markers (Runx2, alkaline phosphatase, type 1 collagen, osteocalcin) and increases osteogenic differentiation in clonal bone marrow-derived hMSCs and primary hMSCs. Analysis of molecular mechanisms revealed that the Cbl mutant increased PDGF receptor α and FGF receptor 2 but not EGF receptor expression in hMSCs, resulting in increased ERK1/2 and PI3K signaling. Pharmacological inhibition of FGFR or PDGFR abrogated in vitro osteogenesis induced by the Cbl mutant. The data reveal that specific inhibition of Cbl interaction with RTKs promotes the osteogenic differentiation program in hMSCs in part by decreased Cbl-mediated PDGFRα and FGFR2 ubiquitination, providing a novel mechanistic approach targeting Cbl to promote the osteogenic capacity of hMSCs.

https://openalex.org/W2113309691,"γ-Secretase inhibitors (GSIs) are drugs used in research to inhibit production of Aβ and in clinical trials to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD). They inhibit proteolytic activities of γ-secretase noncompetitively by unknown mechanisms. Here, we used cortical neuronal cultures expressing endogenous levels of enzymes and substrates to study the effects of GSIs on the structure and function of γ-secretase. We show that GSIs stabilize the interactions between the C-terminal fragment of presenilin (PS-CTF), the central component of the γ-secretase complex, and its partners the APH-1/nicastrin and PS1-NTF/PEN-2 subcomplexes. This stabilization dose-dependently correlates with inhibition of N-cadherin cleavage, a process limited by enzyme availability. In contrast, production of amyloid precursor protein (APP) intracellular domain (AICD) is insensitive to low concentrations of GSIs and is limited by substrate availability. Interestingly, APP is processed by both PS1- and PS2-containing γ-secretase complexes, while N-cadherin and ephrinB1 are processed only by PS1-containing complexes. Paradoxically, low concentrations of GSIs specifically increased the levels of Aβ without affecting its catabolism, indicating increased Aβ production. Our data reveal a mechanism of γ-secretase inhibition by GSIs and provide evidence that distinct γ-secretase complexes process specific substrates. Furthermore, our observations have implications for GSIs as therapeutics because processing of functionally important substrates may be inhibited at lower concentrations than Aβ."
https://openalex.org/W2056460980,"Certain ritonavir resistance mutations impair HIV infectivity through incomplete Gag processing by the mutant viral protease. Analysis of the mutant virus phenotype indicates that accumulation of capsid-spacer peptide 1 precursor protein in virus particles impairs HIV infectivity and that the protease mutant virus is arrested during the early postentry stage of HIV infection before proviral DNA synthesis. However, activation of the target cell can rescue this defect, implying that specific host factors expressed in activated cells can compensate for the defect in ritonavir-resistant HIV. This ability to rescue impaired HIV replication presented a unique opportunity to identify host factors involved in postentry HIV replication, and we designed a functional genetic screen so that expression of a given host factor extracted from activated T cells would lead directly to its discovery by rescuing mutant virus replication in nonactivated T cells. We identified the cellular heat shock protein 90 kDa α (cytosolic), class B member 1 (HSP90AB1) as a host factor that can rescue impaired replication of ritonavir-resistant HIV. Moreover, we show that pharmacologic inhibition of HSP90AB1 with 17-(allylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (tanespimycin) has potent in vitro anti-HIV activity and that ritonavir-resistant HIV is hypersensitive to the drug. These results suggest a possible role for HSP90AB1 in postentry HIV replication and may provide an attractive target for therapeutic intervention."

Four of six nonsense mutations occurred between Gly-65 and Gln-68, whereas 40% of the missense mutations occurred at two Arg residues (Arg-113 and Arg-376).Detailed studies of three residues, Arg-113, Arg-376, and Asp-156, that were mutated in HFM patients provided valuable information on PCFT structure-function. Arg-113 is essential with only a low level of residual activity when it was replaced with like-charged histidine or lysine (R113H and R113K) (14Lasry I. Berman B. Glaser F. Jansen G. Assaraf Y.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 386: 426-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Although R376W was completely inactive despite the presence of protein accessible at the cell membrane, R376Q retained residual activity, in a substrate-specific manner, with less loss of activity for the antifolate pemetrexed than the reduced folates and folic acid (6Mahadeo K. Diop-Bove N. Shin D. Unal E.S. Teo J. Zhao R. Chang M.H. Fulterer A. Romero M.F. Goldman I.D. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2010; 299: C1153-C1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The Asp-156 residue appears to play a key role in protein stability; many mutations at this site resulted in the absence of protein. However, when a mutant protein was expressed, the transporter was fully functional (7Shin D.S. Min S.H. Russell L. Zhao R. Fiser A. Goldman I.D. Blood. 2010; 116: 5162-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).The current study was designed to identify additional residues required for PCFT function, and vulnerable regions of the carrier, using a random mutagenesis strategy. The mutagenesis rate was adjusted to generate clones with less than an average of 4 mutations per pcft open reading frame following which the specific mutations responsible for the loss-of-function were identified. Using this approach, 144 PCFT mutants were generated; 25 lost function completely or had markedly reduced function. Twenty-six loss-of-function mutations were identified, at least one in each PCFT mutant. Seventeen were nonsense mutations. Molecular mechanisms underlying nine missense mutations ranged from the lack of protein expression, decreased binding of the mutated PCFT to folate substrate, to a reduced rate of conformational change associated with substrate translocation.DISCUSSIONRandom mutagenesis has been employed to identify important residues in membrane transporters and channels (21Penado K.M. Rudnick G. Stephan M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28098-28106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 22Shibagaki N. Grossman A.R. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4817-4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Any part of a gene, or an entire gene, can be subjected to mutagenesis. The hallmark of this method is the generation of mutations in an unbiased manner. A library of mutants can be readily generated; subsequent screening and characterization of the mutant proteins are the limiting steps. In the current study, 144 PCFT mutant clones generated by random mutagenesis were screened. However, in only 25 (17%) was PCFT activity decreased or abolished. Based upon an average of four pcft mutations per clone, as indicated in TABLE 2, TABLE 3, a total of 576 pcft mutations would be generated in 144 clones. Yet, only 26 mutations (4.5%) were identified that impacted on PCFT function. The actual percentage may be higher because a second loss-of-function mutation could have been present, but not characterized once the first loss-of-function mutation was identified in a clone. These results indicate that a random mutation in the pcft gene has a very low chance (∼5%) of inactivating PCFT. This finding is consistent with the fact that HFM is a rare autosomal recessive disorder in which both pcft gene copies must be mutated to produce sufficient folate deficiency to result in the clinical syndrome.Four pcft mutations identified in the current study were the same as found in patients with HFM. This represents 15% of the mutations identified in the current study and 25% of all HFM mutations reported to date. p.G65Afs was identified in a male child of African-American parents (2Zhao R.

The other missense mutation, p.R376Q, was identified in a child of consanguineous Chinese parents living in Australia (6Mahadeo K. Diop-Bove N. Shin D. Unal E.S. Teo J. Zhao R. Chang M.H. Fulterer A. Romero M.F. Goldman I.D. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2010; 299: C1153-C1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The significant overlap between mutations found in the current study and subjects with HFM indicates a high mutation susceptibility at these sites raising the possibility that mutations identified in the current study may be found associated with HFM as more cases are identified and characterized in the future.With the addition of nine new base deletion or insertion mutations, it is possible to re-examine whether there are mutational hot spots in the pcft gene. Deletion or insertion of bases with a number other than three always leads to a frameshift in translation, independent of the composition of flanking nucleotides. However, 11 of 13 deletion or insertion mutations were localized in the first 335 of 1350 bases subjected to random mutagenesis, clearly indicating a non-random event. There were two regions dense in these mutations (Fig. 5). One is between bases 177 and 205 (c.177–205 region), which contains four such mutations and one base substitution. The other is an even narrower region between bases 4 and 10 (c.4–17 region), which contains five deletion or insertion mutations and is next to the two-base substitution mutations at the initiation codon. Repetitive DNA sequences may play an important role in the propensity of base deletions or insertions (24Lovett S.T. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Hence, c. 4delG, c. 4–5insG, c. 9–10insG, and c. 10delA mutations are located in a region rich in G (GGAGGGGAG), whereas c. 17–18insC occurs in a poly(C)6 stretch. Similarly, both c. 194delG and c. 194–195insG take place at a poly(G) (7Shin D.S. Min S.H. Russell L. Zhao R. Fiser A. Goldman I.D. Blood. 2010; 116: 5162-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) sequence. However, a repetitive sequence is unlikely to be the only factor because there are two five-base repeats, GGGGG (c.495–499) and TTTTT (c.395–399), in the other part of the pcft gene, and neither a deletion nor insertion mutation was identified at these spots.Under normal circumstances, translation of proteins starts at the first ATG codon (AUG in mRNA) of the open reading frame. However, a growing number of mammalian genes have been characterized that initiate translation at non-ATG sites (19Touriol C. Bornes S. Bonnal S. Audigier S. Prats H. Prats A.C. Vagner S. Biol. Cell. 2003; 95: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). One example is another folate-related protein, the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase. When one nucleotide of the ATG-codon was substituted, translation still started at the same site, although at lower efficiency, with methionine incorporated at the first amino acid (25Peabody D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5031-5035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Very low protein expression, but comparably low function, in the case of ATA initiation of transcription suggests that wild-type PCFT has been synthesized under these conditions, similar to what has been observed for dihydrofolate reductase. It is interesting to note that non-ATG translation did not take place at all when the ATG initiation codon was replaced with a stop codon TGA (Fig. 2A). However, it is unclear as to why the second or downstream ATG codon of pcft was not utilized in this situation since no protein at lower molecular weight was detected (Fig. 2B). Only when the nucleotides upstream of the second AUG (including the first ATG codon) were deleted was the second AUG initiation codon used. However, the encoded protein lacking the first 74 amino acid residues was not functional. These results suggest that translational machinery of the pcft gene can recognize a slightly mutated ATG codon (to ATA or CTG in clone 1–70) but stops at this location if ATG is replaced with a stop codon (TGA).A spectrum of molecular mechanisms underlying loss-of-function missense mutations were elucidated in the current study. Three mutant PCFTs, M222R, V134E, and L31P resulted in the lack of, or markedly decreased, protein expression. Among the mutants that were expressed and trafficked to the plasma membrane, E232G appeared to have a defect in the ability of the carrier to undergo the required conformational changes associated with substrate transport. In fact, the affinity of this mutant for MTX was markedly increased, a pattern that has been observed with other mutant PCFTs usually accompanied by a fall in Vmax (20Unal E.S. Zhao R. Chang M.H. Fiser A. Romero M.F. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 17846-17857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The I304F mutant had a defect in MTX binding (slightly decreased influx Vmax and a larger increase in influx Kt). L161R PCFT had an even greater defect in binding and also a substantial reduction in influx Vmax. The double mutants, F426V/L432H, represent a unique case in which each single mutation was functional but the double mutation resulted in the loss of protein. Based upon the location of Phe-426 and Leu-432 within the helical structure of the 12th transmembrane domain, it is unlikely that these residues are in proximity or interact. More likely, a single mutation results in a transporter that, whereas fully functional, lacks the capacity to sustain the stress of a second mutation. This is similar to what is observed for the Cys-less PCFT, which is also fully functional, but is vulnerable to an additional mutation that, alone, is silent (26Zhao R. Shin D.S. Goldman I.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2011; 1808: 1140-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).Results obtained in the current study provide a basis for further analysis of PCFT structure-function relationships. For example, when all the missense mutations are indicated on the topological structure of PCFT (27Zhao R. Unal E.S. Shin D.S. Goldman I.D. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 2925-2931Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar)(Fig. 5B), it can be seen that the fourth and ninth transmembrane domains contain the most (three) mutations. This suggests that these regions play an important role in PCFT transport function and warrant further structure-function analyses. PCFT mutants, E232G, L161R, and I304F, were all expressed on the plasma membrane and have altered affinity for MTX. Future studies will determine whether the Glu-232, Leu-161, and Ile-304 residues are in, or near, the folate binding pocket. IntroductionThe proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT) 2The abbreviations used are: PCFTproton-coupled folate transporterHFMhereditary folate malabsorptionMTXmethotrexate.

Five mutations occurred at charged resides (p.R113C, p.R113S, p.R376W, p.R376Q, and p.D156Y) (2Zhao R. Min S.H. Qiu A. Sakaris A. Goldberg G.L. Sandoval C. Malatack J.J. Rosenblatt D.S. Goldman I.D.

Four of six nonsense mutations occurred between Gly-65 and Gln-68, whereas 40% of the missense mutations occurred at two Arg residues (Arg-113 and Arg-376).Detailed studies of three residues, Arg-113, Arg-376, and Asp-156, that were mutated in HFM patients provided valuable information on PCFT structure-function. Arg-113 is essential with only a low level of residual activity when it was replaced with like-charged histidine or lysine (R113H and R113K) (14Lasry I. Berman B. Glaser F. Jansen G. Assaraf Y.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 386: 426-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Although R376W was completely inactive despite the presence of protein accessible at the cell membrane, R376Q retained residual activity, in a substrate-specific manner, with less loss of activity for the antifolate pemetrexed than the reduced folates and folic acid (6Mahadeo K. Diop-Bove N. Shin D. Unal E.S. Teo J. Zhao R. Chang M.H. Fulterer A. Romero M.F. Goldman I.D. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2010; 299: C1153-C1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The Asp-156 residue appears to play a key role in protein stability; many mutations at this site resulted in the absence of protein. However, when a mutant protein was expressed, the transporter was fully functional (7Shin D.S. Min S.H. Russell L. Zhao R. Fiser A. Goldman I.D. Blood. 2010; 116: 5162-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).The current study was designed to identify additional residues required for PCFT function, and vulnerable regions of the carrier, using a random mutagenesis strategy. The mutagenesis rate was adjusted to generate clones with less than an average of 4 mutations per pcft open reading frame following which the specific mutations responsible for the loss-of-function were identified. Using this approach, 144 PCFT mutants were generated; 25 lost function completely or had markedly reduced function. Twenty-six loss-of-function mutations were identified, at least one in each PCFT mutant. Seventeen were nonsense mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2043150990,"Serum coagulation factor X (FX) is proposed to play a major role in adenovirus tropism, promoting transduction by bridging the virus to cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). Both murine FX and human FX increased transduction by Ad.CMVfLuc, an adenovirus vector, in murine hepatocyte-like cells and human hepatocarcinoma cells. In contrast, only hFX increased transduction of several non-hepatic cancer cell lines and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Not only was mFX unable to promote transduction in these cells, it competitively blocked hFX-enhanced transduction. Competition and HSPG digestion experiments suggested mFX- and hFX-enhanced transduction in hepatocyte-derived cells, and hFX-enhanced transduction in epithelial cancer cells were dependent on HSPGs. Ad·hFX-mediated transduction of CHO mutants unable to produce HSPGs was also curtailed. Hepatocyte-derived cells expressed substantially more HSPGs than the cancer cell lines. Dose-response curves and heparin-Sepharose binding suggested Ad·hFX has greater affinity for HSPGs than does Ad·mFX. In coagulation factor-depleted mice hFX also had enhanced ability, compared with mFX, to reconstitute hepatic adenovirus transduction. The results suggest that differences in Ad·hFX and Ad·mFX affinity to HSPGs may result in differences in their ability to enhance adenovirus transduction of many cells. These findings may have implications for murine models of adenovirus vector targeting."

This finding opens the door to new types of posttranslational modifications, and it demonstrates new catalytic potential of diiron centers."
https://openalex.org/W1994369551,"The normal expression, cell surface localization, and function of the murine high density lipoprotein receptor scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) in hepatocytes in vivo, and thus normal lipoprotein metabolism, depend on its four PDZ domain (PDZ1-PDZ4) containing cytoplasmic adaptor protein PDZK1. Previous studies showed that the C terminus of SR-BI (""target peptide"") binds directly to PDZ1 and influences hepatic SR-BI protein expression. Unexpectedly an inactivating mutation in PDZ1 (Tyr(20) → Ala) only partially, rather than completely, suppresses the ability of PDZK1 to control hepatic SR-BI. We used isothermal titration calorimetry to show that PDZ3, but not PDZ2 or PDZ4, can also bind the target peptide (K(d) = 37.0 μm), albeit with ∼10-fold lower affinity than PDZ1. This binding is abrogated by a Tyr(253) → Ala substitution. Comparison of the 1.5-Å resolution crystal structure of PDZ3 with its bound target peptide ((505)QEAKL(509)) to that of peptide-bound PDZ1 indicated fewer target peptide stabilizing atomic interactions (hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions) in PDZ3. A double (Tyr(20) → Ala (PDZ1) + Tyr(253) → Ala (PDZ3)) substitution abrogated all target peptide binding to PDZK1. In vivo hepatic expression of a singly substituted (Tyr(253) → Ala (PDZ3)) PDZK1 transgene (Tg) was able to correct all of the SR-BI-related defects in PDZK1 knock-out mice, whereas the doubly substituted [Tyr(20) → Ala (PDZ1) + Tyr(253) → Ala (PDZ3)]Tg was unable to correct these defects. Thus, we conclude that PDZK1-mediated control of hepatic SR-BI requires direct binding of the SR-BI C terminus to either the PDZ1 or PDZ3 domains, and that binding to both domains simultaneously is not required for PDZK1 control of hepatic SR-BI."
https://openalex.org/W2031202488,"Tropomyosin (Tm) plays a critical role in regulating the contraction of striated muscle. The three-state model of activation posits that Tm exists in three positions on the thin filament: “blocked” in the absence of calcium when myosin cannot bind, “closed” when calcium binds troponin and Tm partially covers the myosin binding site, and “open” after myosin binding forces Tm completely off neighboring sites. However, we recently showed that actin filaments decorated with phosphorylated Tm are driven by myosin with greater force than bare actin filaments. This result cannot be explained by simple steric hindrance and suggests that Tm may have additional effects on actin-myosin interactions. We therefore tested the hypothesis that Tm and its phosphorylation state affect the rate at which single actin-myosin bonds form and rupture. Using a laser trap, we measured the time necessary for the first bond to form between actin and rigor heavy meromyosin and the load-dependent durations of those bonds. Measurements were repeated in the presence of subsaturating myosin-S1 to force Tm from the closed to the open state. Maximum bond lifetimes increased in the open state, but only when Tm was phosphorylated. While the frequency with which bonds formed was extremely low in the closed state, when a bond did form it took significantly less time to do so than with bare actin.
