https://openalex.org/W2163838718,"Ci/Gli zinc finger proteins mediate the transcriptional effects of Hedgehog protein signals. In Drosophila, Ci action as transcriptional repressor or activator is contingent upon Hedgehog-regulated, PKA-dependent proteolytic processing. We demonstrate that PKA-dependent processing of vertebrate Gli3 in developing limb similarly generates a potent repressor in a manner antagonized by apparent long-range signaling from posteriorly localized Sonic hedgehog protein. The resulting anterior/posterior Gli3 repressor gradient can be perturbed by mutations of Gli3 in human genetic syndromes or by misregulation of Gli3 processing in the chicken mutant talpid2, producing a range of limb patterning malformations. The high relative abundance and potency of Gli3 repressor suggest specialization of Gli3 and its products for negative Hedgehog pathway regulation."

Substituting a single impurity atom for a copper atom strongly perturbs the surrounding electronic environment and can therefore be used to probe high-temperature superconductivity at the atomic scale. This has provided the motivation for several experimental and theoretical studies. Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) is an ideal technique for the study of such effects at the atomic scale, as it has been used very successfully to probe individual impurity atoms in several other systems. Here we use STM to investigate the effects of individual zinc impurity atoms in the high-temperature superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+delta. We find intense quasiparticle scattering resonances at the Zn sites, coincident with strong suppression of superconductivity within approximately 15 A of the scattering sites. Imaging of the spatial dependence of the quasiparticle density of states in the vicinity of the impurity atoms reveals the long-sought four-fold symmetric quasiparticle 'cloud' aligned with the nodes of the d-wave superconducting gap which is believed to characterize superconductivity in these materials."

We have cloned PID and find that it is transiently expressed in the embryo and in initiating floral anlagen, demonstrating a specific role for PID in promoting primordium development. Constitutive expression of PID causes a phenotype in both shoots and roots that is similar to that of auxin-insensitive plants, implying that PID, which encodes a serine-threonine protein kinase, negatively regulates auxin signaling."

https://openalex.org/W1978291154,"For an accurate assessment of the relative roles of natural variability and anthropogenic influence in the Earth's climate, reconstructions of past temperatures from the pre-industrial as well as the industrial period are essential. But instrumental records are typically available for no more than the past 150 years. Therefore reconstructions of pre-industrial climate rely principally on traditional climate proxy records, each with particular strengths and limitations in representing climatic variability. Subsurface temperatures comprise an independent archive of past surface temperature changes that is complementary to both the instrumental record and the climate proxies. Here we use present-day temperatures in 616 boreholes from all continents except Antarctica to reconstruct century-long trends in temperatures over the past 500 years at global, hemispheric and continental scales. The results confirm the unusual warming of the twentieth century revealed by the instrumental record, but suggest that the cumulative change over the past five centuries amounts to about 1 K, exceeding recent estimates from conventional climate proxies. The strength of temperature reconstructions from boreholes lies in the detection of long-term trends, complementary to conventional climate proxies, but to obtain a complete picture of past warming, the differences between the approaches need to be investigated in detail."

https://openalex.org/W2036355011,"Asymmetric localization is a prerequisite for inscuteable (insc) to function in coordinating and mediating asymmetric cell divisions in Drosophila. We show here that Partner of Inscuteable (Pins), a new component of asymmetric divisions, is required for Inscuteable to asymmetrically localize. In the absence of pins, Inscuteable becomes cytoplasmic and asymmetric divisions of neuroblasts and mitotic domain 9 cells show defects reminiscent of insc mutants. Pins colocalizes with Insc and interacts with the region necessary and sufficient for directing its asymmetric localization. Analyses of pins function in neuroblasts reveal two distinct steps for Insc apical cortical localization: A pins-independent, bazooka-dependent initiation step during delamination (interphase) and a later maintenance step during which Baz, Pins, and Insc localization are interdependent."

https://openalex.org/W2050771413,"The Ras GTPase links extracellular mitogens to intracellular mechanisms that control cell proliferation. To understand how Ras regulates proliferation in vivo, we activated or inactivated Ras in cell clones in the developing Drosophila wing. Cells lacking Ras were smaller, had reduced growth rates, accumulated in G1, and underwent apoptosis due to cell competition. Conversely, activation of Ras increased cell size and growth rates and promoted G1/S transitions. Ras upregulated the growth driver dMyc, and both Ras and dMyc increased levels of cyclin E posttranscriptionally. We propose that Ras primarily promotes growth and that growth is coupled to G1/S progression via cyclin E. Interestingly, upregulation of growth by Ras did not deregulate G2/M progression or a developmentally regulated cell cycle exit."
https://openalex.org/W2053259460,"Replication of Saccharomyces ribosomal DNA (rDNA) proceeds bidirectionally from origins in a subset of the ∼150 tandem repeats, but the leftward-moving fork stops when it encounters the replication fork barrier (RFB). The Pif1p helicase and the highly related Rrm3p were rDNA associated in vivo. Both proteins affected rDNA replication but had opposing effects on fork progression. Pif1p helped maintain the RFB. Rrm3p appears to be the replicative helicase for rDNA as it acted catalytically to promote fork progression throughout the rDNA. Loss of Rrm3p increased rDNA breakage and accumulation of rDNA circles, whereas breakage and circles were less common in pif1 cells. These data support a model in which replication fork pausing causes breakage and recombination in the rDNA."

https://openalex.org/W2038368872,"ETS1 is a member of the evolutionarily conserved family of ets genes, which are transcription factors that bind to unique DNA sequences, either alone or by association with other proteins. In this study, we have used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify an ETS1 interacting protein. The ETS1 N-terminal amino acid region was used as bait and an interaction was identified with the Daxx protein, referred to as EAP1 (ETS1 Associated Protein 1)/Daxx. This interactin has been shown to exist in yeast and in vitro. EAP1/Daxx and ETS1 are co-localized in the nucleus of mammalian cells. The region in EAP1/Daxx which specifically binds to ETS1 is located within its carboxy terminal 173 amino acid region. The ETS1 interaction region is located within its N-terminal 139 amino acids and is referred as the Daxx Interaction Domain (DID). The DID appears to be conserved in several other ets family members, as well as in other proteins known to interact with Daxx. The EAP1/Daxx interacts with both isoforms of ETS1, p51-ETS1 and p42-ETS1. Interaction of EAP1/Daxx with ETS1 causes the repression of transcriptional activation of the MMP1 and BCL2 genes. The interaction domains of both ETS1 and EAP1/Daxx are required for this repression and deletion of either domain abolishes this activity."
https://openalex.org/W2094807146,"We have determined the 2 Å X-ray structure of the 219-residue N-terminal VHS and FYVE tandem domain unit of Drosophila Hrs. The unit assumes a pyramidal structure in which the much larger VHS domain (residues 1–153) forms a rectangular base and the FYVE domain occupies the apical end. The VHS domain is comprised of an unusual “superhelix” of eight α helices, and the FYVE domain is mainly built of loops, two double-stranded antiparallel sheets, and a helix stabilized by two tetrahedrally coordinated zinc atoms. The two-domain structure forms an exact 2-fold-related homodimer through antiparallel association of mainly FYVE domains. Dimerization creates two identical pockets designed for binding ligands with multiple negative charges such as citrate or phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate."

https://openalex.org/W2046490342,"The wing imaginal disc is subdivided into two nonintermingling sets of cells, the anterior (A) and posterior (P) compartments. Anterior cells require reception of the Hedgehog (Hh) signal to segregate from P cells. We provide evidence that Hh signaling controls A/P cell segregation not by directly modifying structural components but by a Cubitus interruptus (Ci)-mediated transcriptional response. A shift in the balance between repressor and activator forms of Ci toward the activator form is necessary and sufficient to define ""A-type"" cell sorting behavior. Moreover, we show that Engrailed (En), in the absence of Ci, is sufficient to specify ""P-type"" sorting. We propose that the opposing transcriptional activities of Ci and En control cell segregation at the A/P boundary by regulating a single cell adhesion molecule."
https://openalex.org/W2326639001,"The tumor suppressor gene p53 is a potent transcriptional regulator of genes which are involved in many cellular activities including cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. Recent studies have demonstrated that the activation of the transcriptional factor nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) plays an essential role in preventing apoptotic cell death. In this study, to better understand the mechanism reponsible for the p53-mediated apoptosis, the effect of wild-type p53 (wt-p53) gene transfer on nuclear expression of NF-κB was determined in human colon cancer cell lines. A Western blot analysis of nuclear extracts demonstrated that NF-κB protein levels in the nuclei were suppressed by the transient expression of the wt-p53 in a dose-dependent manner. Transduced wt-p53 expression increased the cytoplasmic expression of IκBα as well as its binding ability to NF-κB, thus markedly reducing the amount of NF-κB that translocated to the nucleus. The decrease in nuclear NF-κB protein correlated with the decreased NF-κB constitutive activity measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Furthermore, parental cells transfected with NF-κB were better protected from cell death induced by the wt-p53 gene transfer. We also found that the wt-p53 gene transfer was synergistic with aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) in inhibiting NF-κB constitutive activity, resulting in enhanced apoptotic cell death. These results suggest that the inhibition of NF-κB activity is a plausible mechanism for apoptosis induced by the wt-p53 gene transfer in human colon cancer cells and that anti-NF-κB reagent aspirin could make these cells more susceptible to apoptosis."

https://openalex.org/W2108806708,"In order to study the role of calcium/calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) in T cells, we generated transgenic mice expressing CaMKIIgammaB* (T287D), a partially calcium-independent mutant of CaMKIIgammaB. In these mice, the size of the thymus was increased 1.5- to 2-fold, at least in part due to an increase in the lifespan of double-positive (DP) thymocytes. More importantly, there was an increase in the number of T cells in the secondary lymphoid organs that had acquired an antigen-dependent memory phenotype. These T cells were bonafide memory cells as assessed by a variety of criteria. In addition, T cells from wild-type mice acquired calcium-independent CaMKII activity after several rounds of antigen-stimulated division. We propose that CaMKII controls a distinct process of activation-induced cellular differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1981432908,"The Wilms' tumor 1 gene (WT1) encodes a transcription factor of the zinc-finger family and is homozygously mutated or deleted in a subset of Wilms' tumors. Through alternative mRNA splicing, the gene is expressed as four main polypeptides that differ by a stretch of 17 amino acids just N-terminal of the four zinc-fingers and three amino acids between zinc fingers 3 and 4. We have previously shown that expression of the WT1(-/-) isoform, lacking both inserts, increases the tumor growth rate of the adenovirus-transformed baby rat kidney (AdBRK) cell line 7C3H2, whereas expression of the WT1(-/+) isoform, lacking the 17aa insert, strongly suppresses the tumorigenic phenotype. In the present study we show that expression of these splice variants does not affect the tumorigenic potential of the similar AdBRK cell line, 7C1T1. In contrast to the 7C3H2 cell line, this AdBRK cell line expresses high endogenous levels of EGR-1 (early growth response-1) protein, a transcription factor structurally related to WT1. Ectopic expression of EGR-1 in the 7C3H2 AdBRK cells significantly increases their in vivo growth rate and nullifies the tumor suppressor activity of the WT1(-/+) protein. Furthermore, we find that EGR-1 levels are elevated in some Wilms' tumors. These data are the first to show that EGR-1 overexpression causes enhanced tumor growth and that WT1 and EGR-1 exert antagonizing effects on growth regulation in baby rat kidney cells, which might reflect the situation in some Wilms' tumors."

https://openalex.org/W1988357057,"Unlike trypsins, chymotrypsins have not until now been found in fungi. Expressed sequence tag analysis of the deuteromycete Metarhizium anisopliae identified two trypsins (family S1) and a novel chymotrypsin (CHY1). CHY1 resembles actinomycete (bacterial) chymotrypsins (family S2) rather than other eukaryote enzymes (family S1) in being synthesized as a precursor species (374 amino acids, pI/MW: 5.07/38,279) containing a large N-terminal fragment (186 amino acids). Chy1 was expressed in Pichia pastoris yielding an enzyme with a chymotrypsin specificity for branched aliphatic and aromatic C-terminal amino acids. This is predictable as key catalytic residues determining the specificity of Streptomyces griseus chymotrypsins are conserved with CHY1. Mature (secreted) CHY1 (pI/MW: 8.29/18,499) shows closest overall amino acid identity to S. griseus protease C (55%) and clustered with other secreted bacterial S2 chymotrypsins that diverged widely from animal and endocellular bacterial enzymes in phylogenetic trees of the chymotrypsin superfamily. Conversely, actinomycete chymotrypsins are much more closely related to fungal proteases than to other eubacterial sequences. Complete genomes of yeast, gram eubacteria, archaebacteria, and mitochondria do not contain paralogous genes. Expressed sequence tag data bases from other fungi also lack chymotrypsin homologs. In light of this patchy distribution, we conclude that chy1 probably arose by lateral gene transfer from an actinomycete bacterium.

In light of this patchy distribution, we conclude that chy1 probably arose by lateral gene transfer from an actinomycete bacterium. chymotrypsin trypsin, bp, base pair(s) S. griseus protease C nitroanilide Proteases of the chymotrypsin superfamily, which includes the pancreatic chymotrypsins, trypsins, and elastases (chymotrypsin family S1) and the bacterial lytic endopeptidases (chymotrypsin family S2) possess an active site serine that attacks the scissile peptide bond (1.Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Such stereotypical chymotrypsin superfamily proteases as chymotrypsin itself and protease A (Streptomyces griseus) are synthesized as preproenzymes and are secreted to act extracellularly, although endocellular forms are also known. They play a role in cancer and other diseases, and they have a diverse array of important functions, including digestion and degradative processes, blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, cellular and humoral immunity, embryonic development, and fertilization (2.Lesk A.M. Fordham W.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 501-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), that underscore the need to better understand how these enzymes have become adapted to diverse activities. Most chymotrypsin-like enzymes and their associated functions are confined to animals, which suggests that the responsible enzymes arose in the ancestor of that lineage. However there are a few prokaryotic systems and lower eukaryotes in which to study the evolution and divergence of the chymotrypsin superfamily.Microbial members of the family are principally digestive proteases. The bacterial and fungal trypsins are included within the chymotrypsin family S1 that contains the digestive pancreatic proteases, indicating a continuity of function since their common ancestor. The bacterial and animal trypsins were considered to have sequences too similar to be consistent with the prokaryote/eukaryote divergence 3500 million years ago. Hartley (3.Hartley B.S Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1979; 205: 443-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) attempted to explain this apparent anomaly in terms of gene transfer from higher organism to the bacterium. Conversely, the calculated time of divergence between mammalian trypsin andStreptomyces trypsin (1.3 billions years ago) led Barrett and Rawlings (1.Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) to suggest an endosymbiont (protomitochondrian) origin for the chymotrypsin family in eukaryotes. An alternative explanation came from structural comparisons, which suggested that tryptic specificity imposes stricter structural requirements than does specificity of related enzymes (4.Read R.J. James M.N.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 523-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), so conservation of sequences will not necessarily reflect time of divergence. Obtaining sequence data from a trypsin from a lower eukaryote, the fungus Fusarium oxysporum, made it possible to reassess the relationship between the microbial and mammalian trypsins. Finding that the fungal sequence falls between the two classes of organisms, Rypniewski et al. (5.Rypniewski W.R Hastrup S. Betzel C. Dauler M Dauter Z. Pependorf G. Branne S. Wilson K.S. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 6.Rypniewski W.R. Perrakis A. Vorgais C.E Wilson K.S. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) suggested that no interspecies gene transfer is necessary to explain the homology between trypsins and posited a continuos evolutionary divergence from a common ancestor of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. However, recently we cloned a class of metallocarboxypeptidase from Metarhizium anisopliae, not found previously in fungi, that also fell betweenStreptomyces and animal sequences and had only distant homologs in other bacteria (7.Joshi L. St. Leger R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 274: 9803-9811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We now report the cloning of a chymotrypsin from M. anisopliae that also closely resembles the Streptomyces sequences.Until the present study, members of the chymotrypsin family S2 (the lytic endopeptidase family) were known only from eubacteria (1.Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and plant chloroplasts (8.Itzhaki H. Naveh L. Lindahl M. Cook M. Adam Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7094-7098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), although they are derived from a common ancestor with the S1 family (1.Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). As M. anisopliae does not share a common evolutionary history with Streptomyces sp. we consider two possibilities to account for the anomalous distribution of at least three classes of proteases: (i) lateral gene transfer between actinomycetes and fungi and (ii) ancient gene divergence. We conclude that lateral gene transfer from bacteria that actively secrete proteases may have played a major role in the evolution of secreted (digestive) proteases of some fungi and perhaps higher eukaryotes.DISCUSSIONHere we describe isolation of a M. anisopliae cDNA and genomic sequence encoding a protease with a catalytic triad in the order His, Asp, and Ser and other sequence similarities with members of the chymotrypsin superfamily. Aside from the M. anisopliaeS2 chymotrypsin, only the bacterial members of the chymotrypsin superfamily possess large propeptide regions (25.Sidhu S.S. Kalmar G.B. Willis L.G. Borgford T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7594-7600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The microbial trypsins and related mammalian enzymes possess small propeptides amounting to a few amino acids. Notably, the M. anisopliaegene encodes a methionine residue at the N-terminal side of the promature junction, strongly suggesting that CHY1 is a self-processing enzyme. This contrasts with mammalian enzymes but resembles several bacterial chymotrypsins (25.Sidhu S.S. Kalmar G.B. Willis L.G. Borgford T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7594-7600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).M. anisopliae produces a very large number of isoforms of different peptidases that often hinders the rapid purification of the correct protein (26.St. Leger R.J. Can. J. Bot. 1995; 73 Suppl. 1: 1119-1125Crossref Google Scholar). Consequently, Pro-CHY1 was expressed in P. pastoris to produce soluble catalytically active protein in quantities amenable to functional analysis and free of any possible fungal contaminants. The expressed protease exhibits a chymotrypsin primary specificity for large hydrophobic amino acids including phenylalanine and methionine. The specificity closely resembles the multiple secreted subtilisin-like serine proteases produced by M. anisopliae (27.Doolittle W.F. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 307-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Evidently, M. anisopliae retains a large number of secreted proteases that apparently duplicate the same task. This raises the following questions: under what conditions didM. anisopliae obtain these genes and why is it a selective advantage for the fungus to retain them?Possible functional reasons for proteolytic diversity remain to be explored. It has not been determined whether different enzymes play different roles in pathogenesis, increase adaptability and host range, or if they have different functions in survival in various ecological habitats outside the host; this would be consistent with the opportunistic nature of M. anisopliae. Retaining multiple kinds of proteases may also provide backup systems in the presence of the numerous proteolytic inhibitors in insect cuticles. Use of P. pastoris as an expression system will provide valuable information on the properties of individual enzymes and may open the way for more definitive work on the mechanism of synergistic interactions between the various fungal proteinases and host cuticle solubilization.The trypsins and chymotrypsins from M. anisopliae andStreptomyces sp. are about 55% identical. On average, homologous enzymes from prokaryotes and eukaryotes are 37% identical; the entire range encompassing 20–57% with proteins at the upper limit possibly deriving from horizontal gene transfer (27.Doolittle W.F. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 307-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that bacterial proteases and nicotine oxidase were acquired from animals (2.Lesk A.M. Fordham W.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 501-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 3.Hartley B.S Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1979; 205: 443-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 28.Schenk S. Decker K. J. Mol. Evol. 1999; 48: 178-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The close sequence similarity between the prokaryotic and fungal enzymes would seem to preclude this possibility, at least for the proteases, unless fungi and bacteria acquired these genes independently from a higher organism. In addition, S2 proteases are very widespread in prokaryotes and diverged early in their evolution into endocellular and secreted forms, with the endocellular forms being basal, so it is unlikely that both groups could have derived from the secreted form of the only known eukaryotic source,M. anisopliae. Comparison of the primary sequence and organization of genes encoding β-lactam biosynthesis in fungi andStreptomyces suggests that the lateral transfer may have been in the opposite direction, from bacteria to fungi (29.Miller J.R. Ingolia T.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 30.Peñalva M.A. Moya A. Dopazo J. Ramón D. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol.

Barrett and Rawlings (1.Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) have suggested that the entire chymotrypsin superfamily were inherited by eukaryotes via the protomitochondrian. Mitochondria are probably descended from the rickettsial group of α-proteobacteria (31.Gray M.W. Lang B.F. Cedergren R. Golding G.B. Lemieux C. Sankoff D. Turmel M. Brossard N. Delage E.

Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 545-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, examination of all available data bases, including those of the most gene-rich mitochondrial DNA known (62 protein-encoding genes in Reclinomonas americana) (33.Lang B.F. Burger G.

Nature. 1997; 29: 493-497Crossref Scopus (484) Google Scholar), the Rickettsiagenome, the Rhodobacter (free living α-proteobacteria) genome, the Bacillus subtilis (gram-positive bacteria) genome, and various archaeobacterium genomes revealed no non-actinomycete eubacterial or archaeobacterium genes that could be paralogous to the metallocarboxypeptidase (7.Joshi L. St. Leger R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 274: 9803-9811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (38) Google Scholar), chymotrypsins, and trypsins found in actinomycetes and eukaryotes. The argument of Rypniewski et al. (5.Rypniewski W.R Hastrup S. Betzel C. Dauler M Dauter Z. Pependorf G. Branne S. Wilson K.S.

Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) that animal, fungal, andStreptomyces trypsins are derived from gene divergence predating the prokaryote/eukaryote split does not explain the patchy and very narrow distribution of these enzymes among fungi and bacteria. Plant and insect pathogenic members of the Ascomycotina and actinomycete bacteria are the only known microbial sources of S1 trypsins. Likewise, the Streptomyces-like β-lactam antibiotics (30.Peñalva M.A. Moya A. Dopazo J. Ramón D. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1990; 241: 164-169Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and the M. anisopliae CHY1 are limited to representatives of the Ascomycotina among eukaryotes. These genes are lacking from the ascomycete yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome, which diverged 240 million years ago from the various lineages of filamentous ascomycetes (34.Berbee M.L. Taylor J.W. Can. J. Bot. 1993; 71: 1114-1127Crossref Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Extensive screening of the manyAspergillus sp. proteases has never identified S1 or S2 homologs (35.Monod M. Fatih A. Jaton-Ogay K. Paris S. Latge J.P. Can. J. Bot. 1995; 73 Suppl. 1: 1081-1086Crossref Google Scholar). Expressed sequence tag data bases (A. nidulans, N. crassa, and M. grisea) also lack S1 or S2 homologs while containing numerous other proteases. If one postulates gene duplication, then the last common ancestor of Streptomycesand M. anisopliae would have to have had duplicate divergent copies of trypsins and chymotrypsins. Furthermore, their current narrow distribution would require that nearly identical sets of proteases were lost many times in the lineages leading to the different eubacterial and fungal groups that currently lack them. As the actinomycetes are not ancestral to the eukaryotes, ancient gene duplication events would not otherwise account for actinomycete and eukaryote genes sharing common ancestors, whereas other prokaryotes, including sources of organellar genes, lack them. The simplest explanation for actinomycetes containing the only known eubacterial homologs of multiple genes is that their presence in eukaryotes derives from one or more lateral gene transfer events from the actinomycetes. This is a feasible notion given that opportunities for gene transfer would be provided by the common soil habitat of actinomycetes, including Streptomycetes, and many fungi, including M. anisopliae. Parasitism might also have been a factor as Streptomyces sp. periodically infect fungi (36.Lechevalier M.P. Goodfellow M. Williams S.T. Mordarski M. Actinomycetes in Bio/Technology. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1988: 327-358Google Scholar).Eukaryotic genomes are believed to be a chimera of informational genes (transcription, translation, and related processes) from the Archaebacteria and Gram-negative housekeeping genes (37.Lake J.A. Jain R. Rivera M.C. Science. 1999; 283: 2027-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To date all the fungal genes postulated to derive from Gram-positive bacteria encode specific environmental adaptations, e.g. scavenging nutrients and penetration of host barriers (proteases) or elimination of competing microbes (antibiotics). This suggests a possible division of labor between three functional superclasses of genes with essential physiological and genetic processes deriving from Gram-negative bacteria and Archaebacteria, respectively, and at least some niche activities deriving from Gram-positive bacteria. This working hypothesis provides us with several testable predictions. Among these, we would expect that further analyses of secreted gene products of actinomycete bacteria should reveal true orthologues of fungal and higher eukaryote activities. Proteases of the chymotrypsin superfamily, which includes the pancreatic chymotrypsins, trypsins, and elastases (chymotrypsin family S1) and the bacterial lytic endopeptidases (chymotrypsin family S2) possess an active site serine that attacks the scissile peptide bond (1.Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Such stereotypical chymotrypsin superfamily proteases as chymotrypsin itself and protease A (Streptomyces griseus) are synthesized as preproenzymes and are secreted to act extracellularly, although endocellular forms are also known. They play a role in cancer and other diseases, and they have a diverse array of important functions, including digestion and degradative processes, blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, cellular and humoral immunity, embryonic development, and fertilization (2.Lesk A.M. Fordham W.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 501-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), that underscore the need to better understand how these enzymes have become adapted to diverse activities. Most chymotrypsin-like enzymes and their associated functions are confined to animals, which suggests that the responsible enzymes arose in the ancestor of that lineage. However there are a few prokaryotic systems and lower eukaryotes in which to study the evolution and divergence of the chymotrypsin superfamily. Microbial members of the family are principally digestive proteases. The bacterial and fungal trypsins are included within the chymotrypsin family S1 that contains the digestive pancreatic proteases, indicating a continuity of function since their common ancestor. The bacterial and animal trypsins were considered to have sequences too similar to be consistent with the prokaryote/eukaryote divergence 3500 million years ago. Hartley (3.Hartley B.S Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1979; 205: 443-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) attempted to explain this apparent anomaly in terms of gene transfer from higher organism to the bacterium. Conversely, the calculated time of divergence between mammalian trypsin andStreptomyces trypsin (1.3 billions years ago) led Barrett and Rawlings (1.Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) to suggest an endosymbiont (protomitochondrian) origin for the chymotrypsin family in eukaryotes. An alternative explanation came from structural comparisons, which suggested that tryptic specificity imposes stricter structural requirements than does specificity of related enzymes (4.Read R.J. James M.N.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 523-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), so conservation of sequences will not necessarily reflect time of divergence. Obtaining sequence data from a trypsin from a lower eukaryote, the fungus Fusarium oxysporum, made it possible to reassess the relationship between the microbial and mammalian trypsins. Finding that the fungal sequence falls between the two classes of organisms, Rypniewski et al. (5.Rypniewski W.R Hastrup S. Betzel C. Dauler M Dauter Z. Pependorf G. Branne S. Wilson K.S. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 6.Rypniewski W.R. Perrakis A. Vorgais C.E Wilson K.S. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) suggested that no interspecies gene transfer is necessary to explain the homology between trypsins and posited a continuos evolutionary divergence from a common ancestor of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. However, recently we cloned a class of metallocarboxypeptidase from Metarhizium anisopliae, not found previously in fungi, that also fell betweenStreptomyces and animal sequences and had only distant homologs in other bacteria (7.Joshi L. St. Leger R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 274: 9803-9811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We now report the cloning of a chymotrypsin from M. anisopliae that also closely resembles the Streptomyces sequences. Until the present study, members of the chymotrypsin family S2 (the lytic endopeptidase family) were known only from eubacteria (1.Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and plant chloroplasts (8.Itzhaki H. Naveh L. Lindahl M. Cook M. Adam Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7094-7098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), although they are derived from a common ancestor with the S1 family (1.Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). As M. anisopliae does not share a common evolutionary history with Streptomyces sp. we consider two possibilities to account for the anomalous distribution of at least three classes of proteases: (i) lateral gene transfer between actinomycetes and fungi and (ii) ancient gene divergence. We conclude that lateral gene transfer from bacteria that actively secrete proteases may have played a major role in the evolution of secreted (digestive) proteases of some fungi and perhaps higher eukaryotes. DISCUSSIONHere we describe isolation of a M. anisopliae cDNA and genomic sequence encoding a protease with a catalytic triad in the order His, Asp, and Ser and other sequence similarities with members of the chymotrypsin superfamily. Aside from the M. anisopliaeS2 chymotrypsin, only the bacterial members of the chymotrypsin superfamily possess large propeptide regions (25.Sidhu S.S. Kalmar G.B. Willis L.G. Borgford T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7594-7600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The microbial trypsins and related mammalian enzymes possess small propeptides amounting to a few amino acids. Notably, the M. anisopliaegene encodes a methionine residue at the N-terminal side of the promature junction, strongly suggesting that CHY1 is a self-processing enzyme. This contrasts with mammalian enzymes but resembles several bacterial chymotrypsins (25.Sidhu S.S. Kalmar G.B. Willis L.G. Borgford T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7594-7600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).M. anisopliae produces a very large number of isoforms of different peptidases that often hinders the rapid purification of the correct protein (26.St. Leger R.J. Can. J. Bot. 1995; 73 Suppl. 1: 1119-1125Crossref Google Scholar). Consequently, Pro-CHY1 was expressed in P. pastoris to produce soluble catalytically active protein in quantities amenable to functional analysis and free of any possible fungal contaminants. The expressed protease exhibits a chymotrypsin primary specificity for large hydrophobic amino acids including phenylalanine and methionine. The specificity closely resembles the multiple secreted subtilisin-like serine proteases produced by M. anisopliae (27.Doolittle W.F. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 307-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Evidently, M. anisopliae retains a large number of secreted proteases that apparently duplicate the same task. This raises the following questions: under what conditions didM. anisopliae obtain these genes and why is it a selective advantage for the fungus to retain them?Possible functional reasons for proteolytic diversity remain to be explored. It has not been determined whether different enzymes play different roles in pathogenesis, increase adaptability and host range, or if they have different functions in survival in various ecological habitats outside the host; this would be consistent with the opportunistic nature of M. anisopliae. Retaining multiple kinds of proteases may also provide backup systems in the presence of the numerous proteolytic inhibitors in insect cuticles. Use of P. pastoris as an expression system will provide valuable information on the properties of individual enzymes and may open the way for more definitive work on the mechanism of synergistic interactions between the various fungal proteinases and host cuticle solubilization.The trypsins and chymotrypsins from M. anisopliae andStreptomyces sp. are about 55% identical. On average, homologous enzymes from prokaryotes and eukaryotes are 37% identical; the entire range encompassing 20–57% with proteins at the upper limit possibly deriving from horizontal gene transfer (27.Doolittle W.F. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 307-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that bacterial proteases and nicotine oxidase were acquired from animals (2.Lesk A.M. Fordham W.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 501-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 3.Hartley B.S Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1979; 205: 443-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 28.Schenk S. Decker K. J. Mol. Evol. 1999; 48: 178-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The close sequence similarity between the prokaryotic and fungal enzymes would seem to preclude this possibility, at least for the proteases, unless fungi and bacteria acquired these genes independently from a higher organism. In addition, S2 proteases are very widespread in prokaryotes and diverged early in their evolution into endocellular and secreted forms, with the endocellular forms being basal, so it is unlikely that both groups could have derived from the secreted form of the only known eukaryotic source,M. anisopliae. Comparison of the primary sequence and organization of genes encoding β-lactam biosynthesis in fungi andStreptomyces suggests that the lateral transfer may have been in the opposite direction, from bacteria to fungi (29.Miller J.R. Ingolia T.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 30.Peñalva M.A. Moya A. Dopazo J. Ramón D. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol.

Plant and insect pathogenic members of the Ascomycotina and actinomycete bacteria are the only known microbial sources of S1 trypsins. Likewise, the Streptomyces-like β-lactam antibiotics (30.Peñalva M.A. Moya A. Dopazo J. Ramón D. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol.

We have refined the location of the overlapping region to the junction of the subbands 7q31.2 and 7q31.3 by reverse painting with two differently labelled probes prepared from the small chromosome 7 derivatives microdissected from the cells of two distinct tumours. This small region was shown to contain the MET proto-oncogene, present at three to four copies per cell as determined by Southern blot analysis. The increased copy number of the MET gene was found to be associated with its overexpression at the mRNA level. However, no change in MET copy number or expression level was observed in the cells from two xenografted tumours serially transplanted into immunodeficient mice, as compared to those from the corresponding initial tumours. Our results indicate that expression of the MET proto-oncogene above a critical threshold is required for the maintenance of the tumorigenic phenotype of at least some papillary renal cell carcinomas, but does not further increase during tumour progression."
https://openalex.org/W2334825352,"A number of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) deletion mutants have been identified in gliomas, in which the EGFR gene is frequently amplified and rearranged. We have previously characterized the structure of a gene in A-172 human glioma cells that encodes a 190-kDa EGFR mutant with tandem duplication of the tyrosine kinase (TK) and calcium-mediated internalization (CAIN) domains. Here we describe a 185-kDa tandem duplication mutant (TDM) that is expressed in KE and A-1235 glioma cells, along with certain functional characteristics of the mutants. The corresponding transcripts in KE and A-1235 cells contain 1053 additional nucleotides representing an in-frame duplication of exons 18 through 25 which encode the entire TK region and a portion of the CAIN domain. As with duplication of the entire TK/CAIN region (exons 18-26) in A-172 cells, duplication of exons 18-25 is associated with a specific genomic rearrangement between flanking introns. Involved introns contain homology to recombination signal sequence (RSS) heptamers present in the V(D)J region of the T lymphocyte receptor gene. In defined medium, both oncogenic TDM are constitutively autophosphorylated and inefficiently downregulated. High-affinity binding is reduced in EGFR.TDM/18-26, although the t1/2 of receptor internalization is not prolonged."

Chimeras that replaced all four calcium binding domains, replaced all but the second calcium binding domain of αIIb with those of α5, or deleted all four calcium binding domains were synthesized but not expressed on the cell surface. Additional chimeras exchanged subsets or all of the variant amino acids in the second calcium binding domain, a region implicated in ligand binding. Cell surface expression of each second calcium binding domain mutant complexed with β3 was observed. Each second calcium binding domain mutant was able to 1) bind to immobilized fibrinogen, 2) form fibrinogen-dependent aggregates after treatment with dithiothreitol, and 3) bind the activation-dependent antibody PAC1 after LIBS 6 treatment. Soluble fibrinogen binding studies suggested that there were only small changes in either the K d orB max of any mutant. We conclude that chimeras of αIIb containing the second calcium binding domain sequences of α5 are capable of complexing with β3, that the complexes are expressed on the cell surface, and that mutant complexes are capable of binding both immobilized and soluble fibrinogen, suggesting that the second calcium binding domain does not determine ligand binding specificity.

Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9013) Google Scholar). The platelet integrin αIIbβ3 (membrane glycoprotein IIb-IIIa) functions to mediate platelet-platelet and platelet-subendothelial matrix interactions through the binding of its ligands: fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, thrombospondin, fibronectin, and vitronectin (2.Phillips D.R. Charo I.F. Parise L.V. Fitzgerald L.A. Blood. 1988; 71: 831-843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H. Prog. Hemostasis Thromb. 1989; 9: 117-156PubMed Google Scholar). Although progress has been made in elucidating ligand structure and potential ligand binding sites in integrins, questions regarding areas that determine both ligand binding and ligand binding specificity in αIIbβ3 remain. While integrins bind diverse ligands, three themes are apparent in ligand binding. First, many ligands have an acidic amino acid, usually aspartic acid, in the recognition sequence (4.Ginsberg M.H. Xiaoping D. O'Toole T.E. Loftus J.C. Plow E.F. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 5.Loftus J.C. Smith J.W. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25235-25238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Certain integrins, including αIIbβ3 and α5β1, bind ligands that contain the tripeptide sequence arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) (6.Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1984; 309: 30-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (2882) Google Scholar), while the recognition motif of others is more varied (7.Humphries M.J. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 97: 585-592Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, the ligand recognition sequence is usually a short peptide presented on an extended loop containing a β-turn (5.Loftus J.C. Smith J.W. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25235-25238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, the crystal and NMR structures of the ligand recognition sequence of fibronectin have been determined (8.Dickinson C.D. Veerapandian B. Dai X.P. Hamlin R.C. Xuong N.H. Ruoslahti E. Ely K.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 1079-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 9.Main A.L. Harvey T.S. Baron M. Boyd J. Campbell I.D. Cell. 1992; 71: 671-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), revealing the RGD sequence to be present on an extended loop with a β-turn. Although not as well defined, NMR studies have shown that the fibrinogen C-terminal γ-chain peptide assumes a helical conformation in solution with a β-turn centered at residues 408 and 409 (10.Mayo K.H. Burke C. Lindon J.N. Kloczewiak M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3277-3286Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 11.Blumenstein M. Matsueda G.R. Timmons S. Hawiger J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10692-10698Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Third, ligand binding specificity is varied. For example, while α5β1 binds primarily to fibronectin, αIIbβ3 is a more promiscuous receptor and binds to multiple ligands. Much work has been done to determine areas of αIIbβ3 involved in ligand binding. Previous studies have implicated multiple ligand interaction areas on both subunits, leading to models in which the ligand binding pocket is proposed to be formed by amino acids contributed by both subunits (12.Rocco M. Spotorno B. Hantgan R.R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 2154-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar,13.Calvete J.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 72: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The αIIbβ3 complex must undergo a conformational change before it is capable of high affinity binding of fibrinogen, but the resting complex is still capable of binding small peptide ligands.

Recently, a third area, amino acids 274–368, has been reported to bind fibrinogen (24.Alemany M. Concord E. Garin J. Vincon M. Giles A. Marguerie G. Gulino D. Blood. 1996; 87: 592-601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Multiple areas of αIIb appear to be important in ligand binding. A recombinant truncated fragment, amino acids 171–464, has been shown to bind fibrinogen in a calcium-dependent manner (25.Gulino D. Boudignon C. Zhang L.Y. Concord E. Rabiet M.J. Marguerie G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1001-1007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while ligand binding specificity has been localized to the first 334 amino acids of αIIb using αIIbαv chimeras (26.Loftus J.C.

Site-directed mutagenesis of residues in a predicted β-turn in the third N-terminal repeat of αIIb, α4, and α5(amino acids 184–193 of αIIb) has shown the region to be critical for ligand binding (27.Kamata T.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5550-5556Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). A synthetic peptide corresponding to αIIb-(656–667) has been demonstrated to bind to soluble fibrinogen, and both the peptide and antibodies to the peptide inhibit platelet aggregation (29.Calvete J.J. Rivas G. Schafer W. McLane M.A. Niewiarowski S. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 132-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Only one area of the αIIbβ3 has been shown to bind the fibrinogen γ-chain HHLGGAKQAGDV (H12) peptide in a calcium-dependent manner. Chemical cross-linking of the H12 peptide followed by proteolysis identified the second calcium binding domain of αIIb, amino acids 296–314, as a critical region for binding the fibrinogen carboxyl-terminal γ-chain peptide (30.D'Souza S.E. Ginsberg M.H. Burke T.A. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3440-3446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). High affinity binding of the H12 peptide requires calcium and αIIbβ3 to be in the activated conformation (31.Andrieux A. Hudry-Clergeon G. Ryckewaert J.J. Chapel A. Ginsberg M.H. Plow E.F. Marguerie G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9258-9265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Peptides corresponding to amino acids 296–306 or 300–312 blocked platelet aggregation and bound directly to fibrinogen. Antibodies against αIIb-(296–306) blocked binding of fibrinogen to either the peptide or αIIbβ3(32.D'Souza S.E. Ginsberg M.H. Matsueda G.R. Plow E.F. Nature. 1991; 350: 66-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 33.Taylor D.B. Gartner T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11729-11733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Amino acids 296–312 in αIIb define one of four calcium binding domains of αIIb. The integrin calcium binding domains are homologous with the “EF-hand” helix-loop-helix motif found in calmodulin and other proteins (34.Tuckwell D.S. Brass A. Humphries M.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 35.Tuckwell D.S. Humphries M.J. Brass A. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1994; 2: 385-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, integrin cation binding domains are missing the flanking helices and one of six divalent cation coordination sites. These coordination sites are presented as a linear array of amino acids having precisely spaced oxygenated side chains at positions 1, 3, 5, 9, and (in true EF-hands) 12. Position 7 contributes a coordination site through its main chain carbonyl. The divalent cation binding domains in integrins are missing the oxygenated, nearly invariant, glutamic acid residue at position 12, having a small hydrophobic residue instead. It has been postulated that the acidic residue in the ligand contributes the final coordination site (4.Ginsberg M.H. Xiaoping D. O'Toole T.E. Loftus J.C. Plow E.F. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and that the metal ion, the ligand, and the receptor form a transient ternary complex before the metal ion dissociates (36.D'Souza S.E. Haas T.A. Piotrowicz R.S. Byers-Ward V. McGrath D.E. Soule H.R. Cierniewski C. Plow E.F. Smith J.W. Cell. 1994; 79: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The second calcium binding domain of αIIb and α5 occur in a region of high homology, having 80% sequence identity over 35 amino acids. In this paper, we examine the expression, complex formation, and function of a series of chimeric αIIbα5β3 molecules in which we substituted clusters of the divergent α5 amino acids into the second calcium binding domain of αIIb. The mutations were made as chimeras in order to preserve both calcium and RGD binding, while probing ligand binding specificity. The results indicate that these mutants are expressed on the cell surface, complex with β3 but not β1, and function in a manner indistinguishable from wild type αIIbβ3, indicating that the second calcium binding domain of αIIbβ3 does not determine ligand binding specificity.

A full-length αIIb cDNA clone was isolated from a λ-gt11 liver cDNA library using restriction fragments of a partial-length αIIb clone as probes. Partial-length cDNA clones of β3 were isolated from both the liver cDNA library and an EA.hy 926, endothelial-adenocarcinoma hybrid cell, λ-gt11 cDNA library. All cDNA isolates were subcloned into Bluescript KS. Full-length β3 was constructed from two partial clones that overlapped at the internal EcoRI site. The β3clone isolated had a G2069A mutation encoding a C655Y substitution. The mutation was repaired by subcloning a SapI–MluI fragment containing the correct sequence from an EA.hy926 partial clone. All clones were constructed using standard mutagenic and subcloning techniques. A cDNA encoding β3 with a silent mutation destroying the internalEcoRI site, β3ΔE, was prepared using the T7-GEN In Vitro Mutagenesis Kit. Silent mutations in αIIb creating BstBI and NdeI sites at nucleotides 771 and 1411, respectively, were made simultaneously using the dut-, ung- method (48.Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar). This clone, named BN, was used to make IIbα5, a chimeric cDNA where all four calcium binding domains of αIIb were replaced with the calcium binding domains of α5 (amino acids 230–436), and ΔCa, an in-frame deletion of all four calcium binding domains of αIIb (amino acids 234–438) (Fig. 1 A). To construct IIbα5, the calcium binding domains of α5 were amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides that contained BstBI and NdeI sites, respectively, and that reconstructed the αIIb sequence from the restriction site up to the start of the calcium binding domains. ΔCa was made by annealing oligonucleotides CGAACCCAGAGTACTTCGACGGCGCA and TATGCGCCGTCGAAGTACTCTGGGTT and ligating into BN digested withBstBI and NdeI. The mutant D2 was made by subcloning the second calcium binding domain of αIIb into IIbα5 using a subcloning and PCR strategy that precisely transferred αIIb-(286–315) into IIbα5. Second calcium binding domain mutants YAVAA, LD, and LMD were made using the dut-, ung- method after subcloning the cDNA into M13mp18. YAVAA-LD, YAVAA-LMD, and LD-LMD were made by using the appropriate second mutagenic oligonucleotide after isolating the first mutant. YAVAA-LD-LMD was made by using the YAVAA and LMD oligonucleotides simultaneously with the LD cDNA. The sequence of the second calcium binding domain of the mutant constructs is shown in Fig. 1 B. The cDNAs were isolated from double-stranded M13mp18 by digestion withEcoRI and subcloned into Bluescript KS. αIIbwas subcloned into the expression vector pcDNAI/AMP by digestion with EcoRV and XbaI. αIIb was also transferred into pRc/CMV, an expression vector containing theneo gene, by digesting the vector with HindIII, blunting with Klenow, and digesting with XbaI. The vector was then ligated with the EcoRV–XbaI fragment of αIIb. Mutant constructs were transferred to the expression vectors by subcloning the NotI–NruI fragment of each mutant into similarly digested αIIb. β3ΔE and β3ΔEG2069A were subcloned into pcDNAI/Amp and pRc/CMV by digestion with EcoRV andXbaI. The sequence of all clones was confirmed using dideoxy nucleotide sequencing (49.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52655) Google Scholar). Chinese hamster ovary K1 (CHO) cells were maintained and transfected as described previously (50.Lyman S. Gilmore A. Burridge K.

COS-7 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin and streptomycin. Wild type or mutant constructs were co-transfected with β3ΔE into COS-7 cells using LipofectAMINE. Cells were plated at 1.3 × 105cells/cm2 in 25-cm2 flasks. One day after plating, cells were washed with serum-free DMEM and incubated with 2.75 ml of serum-free DMEM and 0.5 ml of Opti-MEM I containing a total of 2.5 μg of β3ΔE and αIIb construct, each in pcDNAI/Amp, and 24 μl of LipofectAMINE. After 5 h at 37 °C, 2.5 ml of DMEM containing 20% FBS was added. Twenty-four h later, the medium was replaced with DMEM containing 10% FBS. Cells were assayed 72 h after the start of transfection. Flow cytometry was performed as described previously (50.Lyman S. Gilmore A. Burridge K. Gidwitz S. White G.C., II J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22538-22547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) except that for PAC1 studies, cells were incubated with a 1:100 dilution of LIBS 6 ascites with or without 1 mmGRGDSP peptide for 15 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed and stained with FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgM. For studies of subunit dissociation, cells were harvested and washed and then resuspended in PBS containing 2% BSA. Immediately before the start of the experiment, EDTA was added to a final concentration of 5 mm. Cells were incubated at the indicated temperature for the indicated times and then immediately diluted 10-fold with PBS, centrifuged, and resuspended in PBC (PBS containing 2% BSA, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 0.1 mm MgCl2) containing the αIIbβ3 complex-specific mAb AP2 and processed as above. Surface labeling and immunoprecipitation were performed essentially as described previously (50.Lyman S. Gilmore A. Burridge K. Gidwitz S. White G.C., II J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22538-22547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). One mg of mAb AP2 (IgG fraction) was iodinated with 2 mCi of Na125I using 2 mmchloramine T for 5 min at 22 °C, quenched with 2.3 mmNa2S2O5, and separated from free Na125I by gel filtration. Cells were harvested with EDTA and trypsin as described above for flow cytometry and resuspended in Tris-buffered saline plus 0.5% BSA. Typically, 5 × 105 cells were incubated with varying concentrations of [125I]AP2 for 30 min at 22 °C in a total volume of 0.5 ml. Triplicate 50-μl aliquots were layered over 0.4 ml of 20% sucrose, 0.5% BSA in Tris-buffered saline and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 2 min. The samples were aspirated to dryness, and the radioactivity associated with the cell pellets was measured in a γ-spectrometer. Total radioactivity in the sample was determined by counting triplicate 50-μl aliquots of the reaction mixture. Nonspecific binding was defined as the radioactivity associated with the cell pellets of mock-transfected cells and was subtracted from that of αIIbβ3-expressing cells. The data were fit to equilibrium binding models (51.McPherson G.A. Computer Prog. Biomed. 1983; 17: 107-114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested as above for flow cytometry and resuspended in PBC. Flat bottomed immunoassay 96-well polystyrene plates were incubated with either 2.5 μg/ml fibronectin or 4 μg/ml fibrinogen in PBS for 16 h at 4 °C. Plates were then incubated with PBS with 2% BSA for 2 h at 37 °C to block nonspecific binding sites on the plates. Typically, 2 × 106cells/ml were incubated with PBC or PBC plus 1 mm GRGDSP for 30 min at 22 °C prior to plating 1 × 105cells/well. Cells were allowed to adhere to the plates for 2 h at 37 °C. Plates were washed three times with PBS to remove nonadherent cells. Adherent cells were stained with 0.5% crystal violet in PBS containing 20% methanol for 30 min at 22 °C. Excess dye was removed by three washes with water, and cells were solubilized in 1% SDS for 16 h at 22 °C. Adhesion was quantified by measuring the absorbance at 540 nm in a BIO-TEK EL 340 microplate reader (BIO-TEK Instruments, Winooski, VT). Nonspecific binding was defined as the absorbance of cells binding to BSA-coated wells and was subtracted from the absorbance of cells binding to ligand-coated wells. All assays were performed in triplicate. All operations were performed at 22 °C. Cells were harvested as above for flow cytometry and resuspended in HEPES-Tyrode's buffer, pH 7.5, at 2 × 107 cells/ml. Cells were incubated with 10 mm DTT for 20 min, pelleted, and resuspended at the same concentration in HEPES-Tyrode's buffer with or without inhibitors. Cells were incubated for 30 min, and then CaCl2 was added to 0.4 mm. One hundred μl of cells was placed in wells of a 48-well tissue culture plate and incubated with or without 0.25 mg/ml fibrinogen for 30 min at 75 rpm on a gyrotory shaker. Cells were analyzed for aggregation by bright field microscopy. Fibrinogen was passed over a gelatin-agarose column two times to deplete the fibrinogen of fibronectin. Fibrinogen and AP2 were labeled using FITC-Celite essentially as described by Xia et al. (52.Xia Z. Wong T. Liu Q. Kasirer-Friede A. Brown E. Frojmovic M.M. Br. J. Haematol. 1996; 93: 204-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The fluorescein:protein ratio for fibrinogen ranged from 3 to 5, while the AP2 had a fluorescein:protein ratio of 3. Cells were harvested as above for flow cytometry and resuspended at a final concentration of 3 × 106 cells/ml in DMEM containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, LIBS 6 ascites at a 1:100 dilution, and either 0.25 mm ligand-blocking peptide RGDW or buffer. Cells were incubated at room temperature for 15 min, and then FITC-fibrinogen was added at the indicated final concentration. Cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature, washed with PBS, fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4 °C, and analyzed by flow cytometry. For both fibrinogen and AP2 binding, cytometry was scrupulously gated to analyze only single cells. In an effort to exclude cells lying outside the normal range, only the central 98% of the fluorescent signal (as determined by minimizing the coefficient of variance) was averaged to determine mean fluorescent intensity. Specific binding was defined as the difference in mean fluorescent intensity between cells incubated in the presence and absence of RGDW. Data was fitted to the one-site ligand binding equation y =a 0 *x/(a 1 + x) using the iterative nonlinear curve fitting function of SlideWrite®Plus (Advanced Graphics Software, Inc., Carlsbad, CA). To test the effect of the anti-N-terminal and anti-C-terminal fibrinogen Aα RGD motif and anti-γ-chain antibodies, cells were resuspended in HEPES-Tyrode's buffer without calcium or magnesium that had been treated with Chelex 100. Cells were incubated with 2 mm Ca2+ and LIBS 6 or with 1 mmMn2+ in the presence or absence of 1 mm GRGDSP for 15 min at 22 °C. Fibrinogen and control or anti-fibrinogen peptide IgG were added to final concentrations of 50 nm and 10 μg/ml, respectively. Cells were incubated at 22 °C for 30 min, washed with HEPES-Tyrode's buffer, and then incubated at 22 °C for 30 min with a 1:10 dilution of FITC-chicken anti-human fibrinogen in HEPES-Tyrode's buffer. Cells were washed, fixed, and analyzed by flow cytometry as above. To determine if the various αIIb calcium binding domain mutants were expressed on the cell surface, CHO cells co-transfected with the mutants and wild type β3 were analyzed by flow cytometry using Tab, a murine monoclo"

https://openalex.org/W2953438216,"Group theory is the mathematics of symmetry, and symmetry is fundamental to many areas of science, including quantum mechanics. Much is already known about the basic building blocks of the so-called finite groups, but mathematicians have now finished the gargantuan task of listing almost everything that can be built with them. The results highlight the striking irregularity of the group-theory landscape."
