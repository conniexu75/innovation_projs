Brahney et al. show that even the most isolated areas in the United States—national parks and national wilderness areas—accumulate microplastic particles after they are transported there by wind and rain (see the Perspective by Rochman and Hoellein). They estimate that more than 1000 metric tons per year fall within south and central western U.S. protected areas. Most of these plastic particles are synthetic microfibers used for making clothing. These findings should underline the importance of reducing pollution from such materials. Science , this issue p. 1257 ; see also p. 1184"

We recruited n = 1,002 twins and unrelated healthy adults in the United Kingdom to the PREDICT 1 study and assessed postprandial metabolic responses in a clinical setting and at home. We observed large inter-individual variability (as measured by the population coefficient of variation (s.d./mean, %)) in postprandial responses of blood triglyceride (103%), glucose (68%) and insulin (59%) following identical meals. Person-specific factors, such as gut microbiome, had a greater influence (7.1% of variance) than did meal macronutrients (3.6%) for postprandial lipemia, but not for postprandial glycemia (6.0% and 15.4%, respectively); genetic variants had a modest impact on predictions (9.5% for glucose, 0.8% for triglyceride, 0.2% for C-peptide). Findings were independently validated in a US cohort (n = 100 people). We developed a machine-learning model that predicted both triglyceride (r = 0.47) and glycemic (r = 0.77) responses to food intake. These findings may be informative for developing personalized diet strategies. The ClinicalTrials.gov registration identifier is NCT03479866."

Here, we demonstrate how analogous principles, combined with large anisotropy, enable extreme control and manipulation of the photonic dispersion of phonon polaritons (PhPs) in van der Waals (vdW) bi-layers. We experimentally observe tunable topological transitions from open (hyperbolic) to closed (elliptic) dispersion contours in twisted bi-layered {\alpha}-MoO3 at photonic magic angles, induced by polariton hybridization and robustly controlled by a topological quantity. At these transitions the bilayer dispersion flattens, exhibiting low-loss tunable polariton canalization and diffractionless propagation with resolution below {\lambda}0/40. Our findings extend twistronics and moir\'e physics to nanophotonics and polaritonics, with great potential for nano-imaging, nanoscale light propagation, energy transfer and quantum applications."
https://openalex.org/W3035343971,"Excessive cytokine signaling frequently exacerbates lung tissue damage during respiratory viral infection. Type I (IFN-α and IFN-β) and III (IFN-λ) interferons are host-produced antiviral cytokines. Prolonged IFN-α and IFN-β responses can lead to harmful proinflammatory effects, whereas IFN-λ mainly signals in epithelia, thereby inducing localized antiviral immunity. In this work, we show that IFN signaling interferes with lung repair during influenza recovery in mice, with IFN-λ driving these effects most potently. IFN-induced protein p53 directly reduces epithelial proliferation and differentiation, which increases disease severity and susceptibility to bacterial superinfections. Thus, excessive or prolonged IFN production aggravates viral infection by impairing lung epithelial regeneration. Timing and duration are therefore critical parameters of endogenous IFN action and should be considered carefully for IFN therapeutic strategies against viral infections such as influenza and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)."
https://openalex.org/W3101433345,"Twisted bilayer graphene near the magic angle exhibits remarkably rich electron correlation physics, displaying insulating, magnetic, and superconducting phases. Here, using measurements of the local electronic compressibility, we reveal that these phases originate from a high-energy state with an unusual sequence of band populations. As carriers are added to the system, rather than filling all the four spin and valley flavors equally, we find that the population occurs through a sequence of sharp phase transitions, which appear as strong asymmetric jumps of the electronic compressibility near integer fillings of the moire lattice. At each transition, a single spin/valley flavor takes all the carriers from its partially filled peers, ""resetting"" them back to the vicinity of the charge neutrality point. As a result, the Dirac-like character observed near the charge neutrality reappears after each integer filling. Measurement of the in-plane magnetic field dependence of the chemical potential near filling factor one reveals a large spontaneous magnetization, further substantiating this picture of a cascade of symmetry breakings. The sequence of phase transitions and Dirac revivals is observed at temperatures well above the onset of the superconducting and correlated insulating states. This indicates that the state we reveal here, with its strongly broken electronic flavor symmetry and revived Dirac-like electronic character, is a key player in the physics of magic angle graphene, forming the parent state out of which the more fragile superconducting and correlated insulating ground states emerge."
https://openalex.org/W3034873991,"Interferons interfere with lung repair Interferons (IFNs) are central to antiviral immunity. Viral recognition elicits IFN production, which in turn triggers the transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), which engage in various antiviral functions. Type I IFNs (IFN-α and IFN-β) are widely expressed and can result in immunopathology during viral infections. By contrast, type III IFN (IFN-λ) responses are primarily restricted to mucosal surfaces and are thought to confer antiviral protection without driving damaging proinflammatory responses. Accordingly, IFN-λ has been proposed as a therapeutic in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and other such viral respiratory diseases (see the Perspective by Grajales-Reyes and Colonna). Broggi et al. report that COVID-19 patient morbidity correlates with the high expression of type I and III IFNs in the lung. Furthermore, IFN-λ secreted by dendritic cells in the lungs of mice exposed to synthetic viral RNA causes damage to the lung epithelium, which increases susceptibility to lethal bacterial superinfections. Similarly, using a mouse model of influenza infection, Major et al. found that IFN signaling (especially IFN-λ) hampers lung repair by inducing p53 and inhibiting epithelial proliferation and differentiation. Complicating this picture, Hadjadj et al. observed that peripheral blood immune cells from severe and critical COVID-19 patients have diminished type I IFN and enhanced proinflammatory interleukin-6– and tumor necrosis factor-α–fueled responses. This suggests that in contrast to local production, systemic production of IFNs may be beneficial. The results of this trio of studies suggest that the location, timing, and duration of IFN exposure are critical parameters underlying the success or failure of therapeutics for viral respiratory infections.

Here, we developed a caged RNA strategy that allows Cas9 to bind DNA but not cleave until light-induced activation. This approach, referred to as very fast CRISPR (vfCRISPR), creates double-strand breaks (DSBs) at the submicrometer and second scales. Synchronized cleavage improved kinetic analysis of DNA repair, revealing that cells respond to Cas9-induced DSBs within minutes and can retain MRE11 after DNA ligation. Phosphorylation of H2AX after DNA damage propagated more than 100 kilobases per minute, reaching up to 30 megabases. Using single-cell fluorescence imaging, we characterized multiple cycles of 53BP1 repair foci formation and dissolution, with the first cycle taking longer than subsequent cycles and its duration modulated by inhibition of repair. Imaging-guided subcellular Cas9 activation further facilitated genomic manipulation with single-allele resolution. vfCRISPR enables DNA-repair studies at high resolution in space, time, and genomic coordinates."

Medically, biofilms are problematic because they protect resident cells from antibiotics. Although biofilms have been intensively studied, we do not understand how they develop cell by cell. Micron-sized bacteria are densely packed within biofilms, making it exceptionally challenging to track their movements. Qin et al. studied biofilm formation in the pathogen and model biofilm former Vibrio cholerae (see the Perspective by Dal Co and Brenner). The authors combined light-sheet microscopy with cell labeling to map the trajectories of a biofilm founder cell and its descendants in space and time as they built a biofilm. The findings revealed that as the bacteria reproduce, a bacterial “fountain” drives biofilm expansion and dictates the final positions of the offspring. Science , this issue p. 71 ; see also p. 30"

Expansion in synapse diversity produces differentiation of brain regions until early adulthood, and compositional changes cause dedifferentiation in old age.

https://openalex.org/W3034202131,"Actin cortex controls cell migration Cell migration is mainly controlled by local actin polymerization–driven membrane protrusion. However, a second structural mechanism might also regulate membrane protrusions and directed migration: changes in the density of the attachment between the plasma membrane and the underlying F-actin cortex, a parameter related to membrane tension. Many types of attachment and signaling mechanisms are known to alter the density of membrane-proximal cortical actin. Bisaria et al. designed a membrane-proximal F-actin (MPA) reporter that could directly measure local changes in the density of MPA in living cells. Levels of MPA were surprisingly low toward the front of migrating cells despite an opposing high overall concentration of F-actin in the same front region. The researchers propose that MPA density can integrate different signaling processes to direct local membrane protrusions and stabilize cell polarity during cell migration.

Although such variation in coloration among the sexes is common, particularly in birds, there are few candidate genes known to be involved.

https://openalex.org/W3103821894,"Encoding Archimedean and non-regular tessellations in self-assembled colloidal crystals promises unprecedented structure-dependent properties for applications ranging from low-friction coatings to optoelectronic metamaterials1-7. Yet, despite numerous computational studies predicting exotic structures even from simple interparticle interactions8-12, the realization of complex non-hexagonal crystals remains experimentally challenging13-18. Here we show that two hexagonally packed monolayers of identical spherical soft microparticles adsorbed at a liquid-liquid interface can assemble into a vast array of two-dimensional micropatterns, provided that they are immobilized onto a solid substrate one after the other. The first monolayer retains its lowest-energy hexagonal structure and acts as a template onto which the particles of the second monolayer are forced to rearrange. The frustration between the two lattices elicits symmetries that would not otherwise emerge if all the particles were assembled in a single step. Simply by varying the packing fraction of the two monolayers, we obtain not only low-coordinated structures such as rectangular and honeycomb lattices, but also rhomboidal, hexagonal and herringbone superlattices encoding non-regular tessellations. This is achieved without directional bonding, and the structures formed are equilibrium structures: molecular dynamics simulations show that these structures are thermodynamically stable and develop from short-range repulsive interactions, making them easy to predict, and thus suggesting avenues towards the rational design of complex micropatterns."

Gregr et al. looked at the costs and benefits of this shift and found that for key trade-offs, the value of kelp forest–associated features such as tourism, fin fish fisheries, and carbon capture outweighed the losses to economies (see the Perspective by Estes and Carswell).

To identify genes that confer susceptibility to this drug in gliomas, we performed a genome-scale CRISPR knockout screen with etoposide. Genes involved in protein synthesis and DNA damage were implicated in etoposide susceptibility. To define potential biomarkers for TOP2 poisons, CRISPR hits were overlapped with genes whose expression correlates with susceptibility to this drug across glioma cell lines, revealing ribosomal protein subunit RPS11, 16, and 18 as putative biomarkers for response to TOP2 poisons. Loss of RPS11 led to resistance to etoposide and doxorubicin and impaired the induction of proapoptotic gene APAF1 following treatment. The expression of these ribosomal subunits was also associated with susceptibility to TOP2 poisons across cell lines from gliomas and multiple other cancers."

The first opportunity for a protein to fold occurs during translation, when the ribosome and surrounding environment can affect the nascent chain energy landscape. However, quantifying these environmental effects is challenging because ribosomal proteins and rRNA preclude most spectroscopic measurements of protein energetics. Here, we have applied two gel-based approaches, pulse proteolysis and force-profile analysis, to probe the folding and unfolding pathways of RNase H (RNH) nascent chains stalled on the prokaryotic ribosome in vitro. We found that ribosome-stalled RNH has an increased unfolding rate compared with free RNH. Because protein stability is related to the ratio of the unfolding and folding rates, this increase completely accounts for the observed change in protein stability and indicates that the folding rate is unchanged. Using arrest peptide–based force-profile analysis, we assayed the force generated during the folding of RNH on the ribosome. Surprisingly, we found that population of the RNH folding intermediate is required to generate sufficient force to release a stall induced by the SecM stalling sequence and that readthrough of SecM directly correlates with the stability of the RNH folding intermediate. Together, these results imply that the folding pathway of RNH is unchanged on the ribosome. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the ribosome promotes RNH unfolding while the nascent chain is proximal to the ribosome, which may limit the deleterious effects of RNH misfolding and assist in folding fidelity.

Historically, the kinetics of protein folding have been monitored with spectroscopic techniques, such as CD or fluorescence; structural features of the folding trajectory can be further probed by hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX) and by comparing stabilities and folding rates among site-specific variants of the protein of interest (φ-value analysis) (12Ozkan S.B.

Thus, it is hard to know whether findings using these techniques are generally applicable to the entire proteome. An alternative technique to measure folding kinetics and energetics in a complex mixture is pulse proteolysis. Under appropriate conditions, a short pulse of proteolysis degrades unfolded proteins, leaving the population of folded proteins intact. Unlike limited proteolysis, which reports on the relative proteolytic susceptibility of a protein, pulse proteolysis can be used to measure the fraction of folded protein in a given mixture quantitatively. Pulse proteolysis has been applied under equilibrium conditions to determine protein stability (ΔGunf) or in a kinetic experiment to assess unfolding kinetics (kunf) and requires very little protein relative to spectroscopic approaches (17Park C.

Because the fraction of folded protein is quantified by following a specific band on the gel, it can be carried out in complex mixtures, making it ideally suited for the study of RNCs. We recently used pulse proteolysis to monitor the thermodynamic stability of proteins off and on the ribosome with varying linker lengths (or distances) from the peptidyl-transferase center (PTC) (20Samelson A.J. Jensen M.K. Soto R.A. Cate J.H.D. Marqusee S. Quantitative determination of ribosome nascent chain stability.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

For all proteins studied, the ribosome destabilizes nascent chains compared with free protein, and this destabilization depends on the distance from the PTC (20Samelson A.J. Jensen M.K. Soto R.A. Cate J.H.D. Marqusee S. Quantitative determination of ribosome nascent chain stability.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Is the destabilization rooted in the folding and/or unfolding kinetics of the nascent chains? Pulse proteolysis applied to RNCs during a time course under nonequilibrium conditions can assess how the ribosome affects nascent chain folding and unfolding. Another approach recently developed to explore the folding of RNCs is arrest peptide–based force-profile analysis (FPA) (21Nilsson O.B. Hedman R. Marino J. Wickles S. Bischoff L. Johansson M.

FPA monitors the release of a stalled nascent chain, which has been shown to correlate with folding near the exit tunnel (5Tian P. Steward A. Kudva R. Su T. Shilling P.J. Nickson A.A. Hollins J.J.

Despite several publications using this technique, details about the types of folding events required to release a stall are unclear. Release is usually attributed to global folding; however, force profiles of HemK and dihydrofolate reductase suggest that formation of an intermediate structure can also trigger release, resulting in bimodal or multimodal force profiles (23Kemp G. Kudva R. de la Rosa A. von Heijne G. Force-profile analysis of the cotranslational folding of HemK and filamin domains: comparison of biochemical and biophysical folding assays.J. Mol.

Here, we apply pulse proteolysis to determine the unfolding rate of RNase H RNCs and combine this technique with FPA to understand how the ribosome modulates the folding and unfolding of RNase H (RNH). All work presented on RNH here refers to the cysteine-free variant (27Dabora J.M. Marqusee S. Equilibrium unfolding of Escherichia coli ribonuclease H: characterization of a partially folded state.Protein Sci. 1994; 3 (7833802): 1401-140810.1002/pro.5560030906Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 28Kanaya S.

For ribosome-stalled RNH I53D (a two-state folding variant of RNH), the thermodynamic destabilization can be attributed to an increase in the unfolding rate, indicating that the folding rate is unaltered on the ribosome. Force-profile studies on two-state and three-state folding variants of RNH show that both the presence and the stability of the folding intermediate are critical for force generation and readthrough of the stall sequence. Together, these results suggest that the folding pathway for RNH is the same on and off the ribosome and indicate that folding to a stable native state does not necessarily cause arrest-peptide release, whereas formation of a transiently populated intermediate is sufficient for release. These results have implications for understanding the fundamental principles of both co-translational folding and membrane protein translocation. The protein RNH has been extensively characterized in bulk by both CD and tryptophan fluorescence. The detail with which we understand its energy landscape make it a prime candidate for further studies on the ribosome (29Spudich G.M. Miller E.J. Marqusee S. Destabilization of the Escherichia coli RNase H kinetic intermediate: switching between a two-state and three-state folding mechanism.J. Mol.

These data, however, were all obtained in a buffered solution at pH 5.5, not the pH 7.4 buffer conditions (with divalent cations) required for on-the-ribosome studies. Therefore, we measured the stability and unfolding kinetics of RNH I53D by CD in a buffer that both more closely approximates physiological conditions and is suitable for ribosome-bound experiments (pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 15 mm Mg(OAc)2, 0.1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine). Compared with the previous studies at pH 5.5, RNH I53D is slightly destabilized (ΔGunf = 4.71 ± 0.32 kcal/mol versus 5.6 ± 0.4 kcal/mol) (Fig. 1A and Table 1). The extrapolated unfolding rate in the absence of denaturant is slightly higher (2.0 (± 0.5) × 10−5 s−1 at pH 7.4 compared with 6.3 (± 5) × 10−6 s−1 at pH 5.5) (Fig. 1B and Table 1), and m‡unf = 0.45 ± 0.02 kcal mol−1m−1 at pH 7.4, within error of the m‡unf measured previously for RNH I53D (0.5 ± 0.1 kcal mol−1m−1, pH 5.5) (29Spudich G.M.

The observed destabilization on the ribosome implies an underlying change in the folding and/or unfolding kinetics. If the two-state folding mechanism of RNH I53D holds true as an RNC, measurements of the unfolding rate via pulse proteolysis will allow us to infer changes in the folding rate (Keq = kunf/kfold). Unfolding kinetics were monitored using pulse proteolysis by rapidly diluting a protein or RNC sample to a specific final urea concentration and following the fraction folded as a function of time by assaying with a pulse of thermolysin-based proteolysis (see “Experimental procedures”). Nascent chains with a C-terminal 10-residue glycine-serine (GS) linker and the well-characterized SecM stalling sequence were tagged by incorporating BODIPY-FL-LysineAAA-tRNA (Promega) during in vitro transcription/translation (IVT) (20Samelson A.J. Jensen M.K. Soto R.A. Cate J.H.D. Marqusee S. Quantitative determination of ribosome nascent chain stability.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Our pulse length of 1 min allows us to measure unfolding rates on the order of ∼10−2 s−1 or less, which partially dictates the urea concentrations accessible for these measurements. For studies on RNCs, the experiments were also limited to below 3.5 m urea to maintain the integrity of the ribosome, which dissociates above 3.5 m urea (20Samelson A.J. Jensen M.K. Soto R.A. Cate J.H.D. Marqusee S. Quantitative determination of ribosome nascent chain stability.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Although the observed unfolding rates are reproducible across experiments, the final amplitudes of these kinetic traces vary and cannot be directly compared with equilibrium pulse proteolysis and CD data (Fig. 2, B and C). Off the ribosome, RNH I53D-(GS)5-SecM unfolds with kunf0M urea = 4.6 (± 2.6) × 10−5 s−1 and m‡unf = 0.34 ± 0.09 kcal mol−1m−1 (Fig. 2, B and D, and Table 1), within error of that determined by CD (Table 1). On the ribosome, we measured kunf0M urea to be 3.8 × 10−4 s−1 ± 1.0 × 10−3, an order of magnitude greater than off the ribosome (Fig. 2, C and D, and Table 1). The m‡ values are comparable on and off the ribosome, with m‡unf = 0.43 ± 0.65 kcal mol−1m−1 for the RNC (Fig. 2D and Table 1). Assuming that RNH I53D is two-state on the ribosome, kfold = 0.2 s−1, similar to that obtained by pulse proteolysis off the ribosome (kfold = 0.1 s−1, pH 7.4) and from bulk CD experiments (0.1 s−1, pH 5.5) (29Spudich G.M. Miller E.J. Marqusee S. Destabilization of the Escherichia coli RNase H kinetic intermediate: switching between a two-state and three-state folding mechanism.J. Mol.

The folding trajectory of ribosome-bound nascent chains can be interrogated directly using arrest peptide–based force-profile analysis (23Kemp G. Kudva R. de la Rosa A. von Heijne G.

FPA measures the fraction readthrough of the SecM stall (fFL) as a function of linker length between the protein of interest and the PTC. At each linker length, the fFL is a readout of the fraction of nascent chains that release the stall. The connection between the biophysical properties of the nascent chain and the fFL remains unclear. The stability of the nascent chain, its topology, and its folding rate have all been linked to the amplitude of the fFL (24Farías-Rico J.A. Ruud Selin F. Myronidi I. Frühauf M. von Heijne G.

Thus, a comparison of FPA on the well-characterized protein RNH with the on-ribosome energetics and kinetics obtained by pulse proteolysis should help to decipher these effects, in addition to reporting on the RNH folding trajectory on the ribosome.

A flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO) produced by A. sativum (AsFMO) was previously proposed to oxidize S-allyl-l-cysteine (SAC) to alliin, an allicin precursor. Here, we present a kinetic and structural characterization of AsFMO that suggests a possible contradiction to this proposal. Results of steady-state kinetic analyses revealed that AsFMO exhibited negligible activity with SAC; however, the enzyme was highly active with l-cysteine, N-acetyl-l-cysteine, and allyl mercaptan. We found that allyl mercaptan with NADPH was the preferred substrate-cofactor combination. Rapid-reaction kinetic analyses showed that NADPH binds tightly (KD of ∼2 μm) to AsFMO and that the hydride transfer occurs with pro-R stereospecificity. We detected the formation of a long-wavelength band when AsFMO was reduced by NADPH, probably representing the formation of a charge-transfer complex. In the absence of substrate, the reduced enzyme, in complex with NADP+, reacted with oxygen and formed an intermediate with a spectrum characteristic of C4a-hydroperoxyflavin, which decays several orders of magnitude more slowly than the kcat. The presence of substrate enhanced C4a-hydroperoxyflavin formation and, upon hydroxylation, oxidation occurred with a rate constant similar to the kcat. The structure of AsFMO complexed with FAD at 2.08-Å resolution features two domains for binding of FAD and NADPH, representative of class B flavin monooxygenases.

Garlic (Allium sativum) is one of the best known and most consumed spices worldwide, serving as a key ingredient in many dishes. In addition to being used for its flavor and aroma, garlic has been utilized as a nutraceutical for thousands of years. Records, dating as far back as 2700 BC in Asia, indicate that garlic was used in remedies for treating skin infections, gastrointestinal diseases, bronchitis, and cardiovascular illness (1Petrovska B.B.

Garlic's distinct taste is due, in part, to the production of organosulfur compounds, specifically allicin (S-allyl prop-2-ene-1-sulfinothioate) and its allyl sulfide derivatives, such as diallyl disulfide, diallyl trisulfide, and ajoene. Extensive experimentation has shown that these compounds exhibit numerous health properties, including antimicrobial, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and cardiovascular benefits (2Hann G.

Garlic.Herbal Medicine. American Botanical Council, Austin, TX2000: 130-133Google Scholar). Agricultural benefits from allicin have also been described, showing potential application in organic farming (9Slusarenko A. Patel A. Portz D. Control of Plant Diseases by Natural Products: Allicin from Garlic as a Case Dtudy.Sustainable Disease Management in a European Context. Springer, New York, NY2020: 313-322Google Scholar). One of the main issues with using these compounds is that they are very reactive and organosulfur production varies greatly between garlic plants, depending on soil, temperature, season, and other factors, making standardization of allicin production through agricultural means a challenging task (10Block E. Naganathan S. Putman D. Zhao S. Organosulfur chemistry of garlic and onion: recent results.Pure Appl. Chem. 1993; 65: 625-63210.1351/pac199365040625Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 11Lanzotti V.

Therefore, a better understanding of the enzymes involved in this pathway would make it possible to engineer allicin biosynthesis for flavor and medicinal applications. In garlic, allicin plays a role in the defense mechanism that is initiated after damage to the plant tissue. Radiolabeling studies have led to the proposal that there are two allicin biosynthetic pathways, starting with either l-serine or l-GSH (5Borlinghaus J. Albrecht F. Gruhlke M. Nwachukwu I. Slusarenko A. Allicin: chemistry and biological properties.Molecules. 2014; 19 (25153873): 12591-1261810.3390/molecules190812591Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 13Granroth B.

Bot. 2019; 70: 4121-413710.1093/jxb/erz243Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Both pathways involve the incorporation of an allyl donor from an unknown source, ultimately leading to the synthesis of the stable sulfoxide alliin (Scheme 1). In response to plant injury, alliin is hydrolyzed by alliinase into allyl sulfenic acid and pyruvate, with the consecutive nonenzymatic reaction of two allyl sulfenic acids producing allicin. A key enzyme involved in allicin biosynthesis is a flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO), which has been proposed to convert S-allyl-l-cysteine (SAC) into alliin through a chiral sulfoxidation reaction (Scheme 1) (15Yoshimoto Y. Onuma M. Mizuno S. Sugino Y. Nakabayashi R. Imai S. Tsuneyoshi T. Sumi S. Saito K. Identification of a flavin-containing S-oxygenating monooxygenase involved in alliin biosynthesis in garlic.Plant J. 2015; 83 (26345717): 941-95110.1111/tpj.12954Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). FMOs belong to the large family of flavin-dependent monooxygenases, specifically to the subclass B monooxygenases, which are important players in many biosynthetic pathways due to their ability to oxygenate a range of substrates, including aromatic carbons, ketones, and soft nucleophilic heteroatoms (16Reeder R. Sobrado P. Flavin-dependent monooxygenases in siderophore biosynthesis.in: Handbook of Flavoproteins. 2. De Gruyter, Berlin, Germany2013: 29-72Google Scholar, 17Huijbers M. Montersino S. Westphal A.

The general reaction of members of this class is divided into reductive and oxidative half-reactions. The reductive half-reaction involves binding of NAD(P)H, hydride transfer to FAD, and formation of the reduced enzyme in complex with NADP+. Retention of NADP+ by the reduced enzyme is important for the oxidative half-reaction, as it is essential for the formation and stabilization of the C4a-hydroxyflavin species, which is the intermediate that performs the hydroxylation of the aromatic, N- and S-containing compounds.

These reactions are highly stereospecific, which makes FMOs attractive targets for industrial applications (21Catucci G. Gao C. Sadeghi S. Gilardi G. Chemical applications of class B flavoprotein monooxygenases.Rend. Lincei. 2017; 28: 195-20610.1007/s12210-016-0583-xCrossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). FMOs from plants contain the largest number of enzymes and have been shown to be involved in cell signaling, defense, and detoxification (22Schlaich N. Flavin-containing monooxygenases in plants: looking beyond detox.Trends Plant Sci. 2007; 12 (17765596): 412-41810.1016/j.tplants.2007.08.009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). FMOs from this kingdom are separated into three clades according to sequence homology. Clade I FMOs are involved in plant defense, as represented by the recently characterized enzyme from Arabidopsis thaliana, which catalyzes N-hydroxylation of pipecolic acid (23Hartman M. Zeier T. Bernsdorff F. Reichel-Deland V. Kim D. Hohmann M. Scholten N. Schuck S. Bräutigam A. Hölzel T. Ganter C. Zeier J.

Clade II includes YUCCA enzymes, which are involved in auxin biosynthesis (24Dai X. Mashiguchi K. Chen Q. Kasahara H. Kamiya Y. Ojha S. DuBois J. Ballou D. Zhao Y. The biochemical mechanism of auxin biosynthesis by an arabidopsis YUCCA flavin-containing monooxygenase.J. Biol.

Clade III can be best described as FMOGS-OX1-5, which is involved in the S-oxidation of the anticarcinogenic compounds glucosinolates (25Wojcieszyńska D. Hupert-Kocurek K. Guzik U. Flavin-dependent enzymes in cancer prevention.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2012; 13 (23222680): 16751-1676810.3390/ijms131216751Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Previous work by Yoshimoto and Saito suggested that the A. sativum FMO (AsFMO) and similar FMOs from other Allium plants belong to Clade III and are involved in the biosynthesis of S-alk(en)yl-l-cysteine sulfoxides, including alliin and similar sulfur compounds, methiin, propiin, and ethiin (14Yoshimoto Y. Saito K. S-Alk(en)ylcysteine sulfoxides in the genus Allium: proposed biosynthesis, chemical conversion, and bioactivities.J. Exp.

While there have been some reports of AsFMO activity in yeast cell extracts, as well as in vivo activity of similar enzymes (15Yoshimoto Y. Onuma M. Mizuno S. Sugino Y. Nakabayashi R. Imai S.

In this work, we present the biochemical and structural characterization of AsFMO, as well as a detailed understanding of the function of this enzyme, providing biochemical evidence of its role in the biosynthetic pathway for allicin production in plants. Recombinant AsFMO was initially expressed as an N terminus-His6 fusion protein; however, this form of the protein was highly insoluble. To overcome this problem, the protein was then expressed as a fusion with His6-maltose-binding protein (MBP) and purified using immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). The MBP-AsFMO fusion protein was treated with tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease and the free AsFMO was stable and could be isolated to >95% homogeneity, as determined by SDS-PAGE (Fig. S1). The protein yield was 1.3 ± 0.2 mg protein/1 g of cell pellet. It was determined by MS that the protein contained FAD (data not shown) and ∼50% of the protein contained flavin. The absorbance spectrum of bound flavin was very similar to that of free FAD (Fig. S2). The extinction coefficient of FAD bound to AsFMO at pH 7.5 was determined to be 12.8 mm−1 cm−1 at 450 nm. The activity under steady-state conditions was monitored by following oxygen consumption. AsFMO showed an initial velocity of 0.06 ± 0.005 s−1 when SAC was used as the substrate, which resembled the background activity with no substrate (Fig. 1A). These results were also obtained when the buffer conditions were changed to sodium phosphate pH 7.5 or Tris-Cl pH 8.0. Even when a reaction mixture of 0.5 μm enzyme, 15 mm SAC, and 5 mm NADPH was incubated for 5 h, there were still no observable changes in SAC concentration (Fig. S3A). To identify potential substrates for AsFMO, the allicin biosynthetic pathway and other thiol-containing compounds were reviewed. S-Methyl-l-cysteine, GSH, l-cysteine (Cys), N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), allyl mercaptan (AM), thiopropane, thioethane, and thiomethoxide were selected and tested as potential substrates. Of these, Cys, NAC, and AM exhibited significant activity (Fig. 1A), whereas the others showed negligible or no activity. We also monitored the levels of Cys and showed that they decreased as a function of time (Fig. S3B). The kinetic parameters obtained from the oxygen consumption assays are summarized in Table 1. The results show a 2–3-fold higher kcat value with Cys, compared with AM and NAC; however, the Km value is 5–10-fold lower for AM, resulting in a 2–9-fold higher kcat/Km value. AsFMO exhibited a 2–7-fold higher kcat/Km value with NADPH, compared with NADH, originating from a lower Km value for NADPH. Substrate inhibition was observed only with excess NADPH, with a Ki value of 4 mm (Fig. 2B).Table 1Steady-state kinetic parameters for AsFMO with different substrates, determined by oxygen consumption assayVariable substrateaConditions were 50 mm HEPES pH 7.5, with fixed concentrations of 0.25 mm NADPH, 0.5 mm NADH, or 150 mm Cys.Fixed substratekcat (s−1)Km (mm)kcat/Km (mm−1 s−1)Ki (mm)bN.A., not applicable.AMNADPH0.75 ± 0.011 ± 0.10.75 ± 0.08N.A.CysNADPH1.3 ± 0.0511 ± 0.50.11 ± 0.007N.A.l-CysteineNADH1.7 ± 0.035 ± 0.40.34 ± 0.03N.A.NACNADPH0.57 ± 0.0047 ± 0.40.08 ± 0.005N.A.NADPHCys1.5 ± 0.020.019 ± 0.000279 ± 14 ± 0.2NADHCys1.5 ± 0.010.056 ± 0.000227 ± 0.2N.A.a Conditions were 50 mm HEPES pH 7.5, with fixed concentrations of 0.25 mm NADPH, 0.5 mm NADH, or 150 mm Cys.b N.A., not applicable. Open table in a new tab The product of the enzyme reaction with Cys was determined by MS (Fig. S4). Cys was identified in the reaction mixture with an m/z value of 122.027, which matches the values observed for Cys in the control samples. A peak at m/z 241.033 was observed in the reaction mixture, consistent with formation of l-cystine. Control experiments with a l-cystine standard supported this assignment. The peak was present only in the reaction mixture and was not observed in the nonenzyme control (Fig. S4). From these observations, it is likely that AsFMO hydroxylates the thiol group on Cys, forming Cys sulfenic acid. The product then reacts nonenzymatically with excess Cys to form l-cystine (Scheme S1). Sulfenic acid detection was attempted using the derivatization agents 5,5-dimethyl-1,3-cyclohexanedione (dimedone) and cis-5-norbornene-endo-2,3-dicarboxylic acid, with no success (data not shown). It is possible that the reactivity of Cys sulfenic acid with excess free Cys prevented derivatization. While FMOs commonly perform hydroxylation reactions, they are also known to produce hydrogen peroxide as part of an unproductive or uncoupled reaction (29Franceschini S. Fedkenheuer M. Vogelaar N. Robinson R. Sobrado P. Mattevi A. Structural insight into the mechanism of oxygen activation and substrate selectivity of flavin-dependent N-hydroxylating monooxygenases.Biochemistry. 2012; 51 (22928747): 7043-704510.1021/bi301072wCrossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 30Binda C.

This usually occurs very slowly when there is no substrate or when an inhibitor or nonoptimal substrate binds to the active site. If H2O2 is produced, it is possible that it will nonenzymatically react with Cys, producing Cys sulfenic acid and, subsequently, l-cystine (33Hill J. Coy R. Lewandowski P. Oxidation of cysteine to cystine using hydrogen peroxide.J. Chem. Educ. 1990; 67: 17210.1021/ed067p172Crossref Google Scholar). Therefore, determining the rate of the uncoupled reaction was essential in determining whether the observed activity was enzymatically produced or was a byproduct of uncoupling. This was accomplished by comparing the change in the rate of oxygen consumption of AsFMO in the presence of catalase. Catalase was selected for this experiment because it converts H2O2 into water and oxygen, which can be directly measured as a decrease in the initial rate in oxygen consumption assays. By monitoring NADPH oxidation, it was determined that 1 mg/ml catalase did not inhibit the enzyme activity; however, there was a decrease in the activity measured by monitoring oxygen consumption (Fig. S5). The percentage of the enzymatic reaction of Cys, NAC, and AM that was uncoupled with NADPH under saturated conditions (Fig. 2) was much lower than that with NADH, suggesting that NADPH is the preferred cofactor. The reaction with NADPH and AM was the least uncoupled at ∼1%, compared with 23% with Cys and 35% with NAC. Size exclusion chromatography was used to determine that recombinant AsFMO exists in two oligomeric states, 151,000 ± 4000 Da and 57,000 ± 2000 Da, which correspond to trimeric and monomeric forms, respectively (the predicted mass based on the amino acid composition is 51,700 Da) (Fig. S6 and Table S1). These two forms were observed using different enzyme preparations, with 12 ± 2% being trimeric and the rest being monomeric. When the enzyme was incubated with Cys prior to separation based on size exclusion, the trimeric form was no longer observed. When the same experiment was repeated with NADP+, no changes were noticed (data not shown). The reaction of oxidized AsFMO with NAD(P)H was monitored using a stopped-flow spectrophotometer under anaerobic conditions. With NADPH in the absence of Cys, bleaching of the peak at 450 nm occurred in two phases. In addition, we observed that a stable broad band formed between 520 and 650 nm (Fig. 3), which correlated with the slow phase of reduction at 450 nm. The fast phase (kfast) corresponded to 82% of the amplitude change. The rate constants of the slow phase (kslow) and the formation of the broad band (k570) were much lower than the kcat with Cys (Table 2). The value for kfast was constant even at 20 μm NADPH; thus, we estimate that the dissociation constant (Kd) for NADPH for this enzyme population is much lower (at least 10 times lower). The kslow depended on the NADPH concentration, and a KD of 15 μm was determined for this enzyme form. Formation of the long-wavelength band also exhibited dependence on the NADPH concentration, with a KD of 33 μm. When AsFMO was incubated with Cys prior to mixing with NADPH, reduction occurred as a single phase and the formation of the long-wavelength band was observable only at low concentrations of NADPH. When AsFMO was reduced with NADH without Cys, the reaction was also biphasic, however, the formation of the long-wavelength band was not observed (Fig. S7). The values for both rate constants were lower than observed with NADPH. In addition, the KD for NADH was much higher than that for NADPH (Table 2).Table 2Reductive half-reaction kinetic parameters for AsFMO in the absence or presence of 100 mm CysRate constantCofactoraConditions were 50 mm HEPES pH 7.5.Without CysWith Cyskfast (s−1)NADPH7.6 ± 0.34.8 ± 0.1kslow (s−1)NADPH0.13 ± 0.003N.A.bN.A., not applicable.k570 (s−1)NADPH0.050 ± 0.003N.A.KD,fast, (μm)NADPH<2<2KD,slow (μm)NADPH15 ± 2N.A.KD,570 (μm)NADPH33 ± 2N.A.kred,fast (s−1)NADH4.3 ± 0.03N.A.kred,fast (s−1)NADH0.70 ± 0.10N.A.KD,fast (μm)NADH84 ± 4N.A.KD,slow (μm)NADH77 ± 5N.A.a Conditions were 50 mm HEPES pH 7.5.b N.A., not applicable. Open table in a new tab The stereospecificity of hydride transfer was probed using pro-R-[4-2H]NADPH or pro-S-[4-2H]NAPDH to reduce AsFMO when no substrate was present. From this experiment, it was observed that AsFMO exhibited kinetic isotope effects of 5.4 ± 0.1 with pro-R-[4-2H]NADPH and 2.2 ± 0.05 with pro-S-[4-2H]NADPH, demonstrating stereospecificity for pro-R-hydrogen. Formation of the long-wavelength band (k570) and the second phase of reduction (kslow) were not affected by isotopic substitution (Fig. S8 and Table S2). During the oxidative half-reaction, a peak rapidly formed at 370 nm, consistent with formation of the C4a-hydroperoxyflavin intermediate (Fig. 4). This peak was most prominent in the absence of substrate, decaying after ∼7 s into the fully oxidized enzyme. The rate of C4a-hydroperoxyflavin intermediate formation (kOOH) was enhanced in the presence of Cys. The rate of oxidation in the absence of Cys (kH2O2), which reports on H2O2 elimination, was several orders of magnitude lower than kOOH. In the presence of Cys, turnover occurs and the observed change in absorbance corresponds to substrate hydroxylation (kox) (Table 3). This process occurs in two phases, with the kox,slow having a value similar to kcat with Cys. Decay of the long-wavelength band from 520 to 650 nm was ∼1–2 s−1, with or without Cys.Table 3Oxidative half-reaction kinetic parameters for AsFMO in the absence or presence of 100 mm CysRate constantCofactoraConditions were 50 mm HEPES pH 7.5.Without CysWith CyskOOH (m−1 s−1)NADPH5500 ± 4003400 ± 200kH2O2 (s−1)NADPH0.002 ± 0.0005N.A.bN.A., not applicable.kox,slow (s−1)NADPHN.A.1.20 ± 0.08kox,fast (s−1)NADPHN.A.3.1 ± 0.01a Conditions were 50 mm HEPES pH 7.5.b N.A., not applicable. Open table in a new tab Depending on the protein batch, the oxidation of AsFMO varied. Some preparations exhibited a two-phase oxidation without Cys, instead of a single-phase oxidation (Fig. S9). The fast phase of this experiment was 3.3 ± 0.3 s−1, which was very similar to the kox,fast observed during oxidation with Cys. Both rates are much higher than the kcat value. The structure of AsFMO complexed with FAD was determined at 2.08-Å resolution using selenomethionine (Se-Met) single-wavelength anomalous diffraction phasing (Fig. 5A). The structure exhibits the expected fold for an FMO, consisting of large and small, 3-layer ββα domains. The larger domain binds FAD, while the smaller one presumably binds NADPH. The FAD binds with its ADP moiety mainly interacting with the larger domain and the isoalloxazine located in the space between the two domains (Fig. 5A). The si face of the isoalloxazine is buried, while the re face is available for catalysis; this is expected for FMOs.

https://openalex.org/W3034249483,"The Nem1-Spo7 complex in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a protein phosphatase that catalyzes the dephosphory-lation of Pah1 phosphatidate phosphatase, required for its translocation to the nuclear/endoplasmic reticulum membrane. The Nem1–Spo7/Pah1 phosphatase cascade plays a major role in triacylglycerol synthesis and in the regulation of phospholipid synthesis. In this work, we examined Spo7, a regulatory subunit required for Nem1 catalytic function, to identify residues that govern formation of the Nem1-Spo7 complex. By deletion analysis of Spo7, we identified a hydrophobic Leu-Leu-Ile (LLI) sequence comprising residues 54–56 as being required for the protein to complement the temperature-sensitive phenotype of an spo7Δ mutant strain. Mutational analysis of the LLI sequence with alanine and arginine substitutions showed that its overall hydrophobicity is crucial for the formation of the Nem1-Spo7 complex as well as for the Nem1 catalytic function on its substrate, Pah1, in vivo. Consistent with the role of the Nem1–Spo7 complex in activating the function of Pah1, we found that the mutational effects of the Spo7 LLI sequence were on the Nem1–Spo7/Pah1 axis that controls lipid synthesis and related cellular processes (e.g. triacylglycerol/phospholipid synthesis, lipid droplet formation, nuclear/endoplasmic reticulum membrane morphology, vacuole fusion, and growth on glycerol medium). These findings advance the understanding of Nem1-Spo7 complex formation and its role in the phosphatase cascade that regulates the function of Pah1 phosphatidate phosphatase.

Pah1 is a peripheral membrane protein that translocates to the ER membrane via its dephosphorylation by the Nem1-Spo7 complex.

In the present work, we examined the structural requirement of Spo7 in regulating the function of the Nem1-Spo7/Pah1 phosphatase cascade. Deletion analysis of Spo7 indicated that its amino acid region 46–65 is required for Nem1-Spo7/Pah1 axis function, and the N-terminal region contains the hydrophobic sequence Leu-Leu-Ile (LLI) (residues 54–56), conserved in fungi. Mutational analysis showed that the overall hydrophobicity of the LLI sequence is required for the complex formation of Spo7 with Nem1, and its defect causes a significant loss of the phosphatase complex-controlled Pah1 function (e.g. TAG synthesis and lipid droplet formation, the nuclear/ER membrane morphology, vacuole fusion, and growth at elevated temperature and on glycerol as a carbon source).

Enzymes are indispensable for living cells, as they are required to catalyze the reactions that serve physiological needs. Most enzymes catalyze a single specific reaction with the ability to use a certain set of compounds as substrates that are compatible with the binding and catalytic machinery. However, enzymes that employ a single active site to catalyze two types of reactions also exist. Their origin and the principles underlying their ability to accommodate dual activities are currently not well-understood. Nevertheless, the existence of these enzymes in nature is becoming more recognized. Understanding the general principles dictating their activities is useful for enzyme engineering or protein evolution to devise biocatalysts relevant for future industrial and biotechnology applications (1Copley S.D.

The characteristics of enzymes with dual activities in a single active site are diverse and can be found in a wide range of enzyme classes. Tetrachlorohydroquinone dehalogenase from Sphingomonas chlorophenolica catalyzes dehalogenation and isomerization of maleylactone and its analogues within a single active site (5Anandarajah K. Kiefer Jr., P.M. Donohoe B.S. Copley S.D.

Acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS) from Thermotoga maritime catalyzes dual reactions with a major activity (∼90%) of converting pyruvate to acetoacetate and a minor (10%) pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) activity that can convert pyruvate to acetaldehyde. Understanding how the PDC activity in AHAS is controlled is useful for the biofuel industry (6Eram M.S. Ma K. Pyruvate decarboxylase activity of the acetohydroxyacid synthase of Thermotoga maritima.Biochem. Biophys. Rep. 2016; 7 (28955930): 394-39910.1016/j.bbrep.2016.07.008PubMed Google Scholar). Dual activities in a single active site have also been recognized in many flavoenzyme oxidases. However, insights into the mechanisms of these flavoenzymes and the factors dictating their activities are still lacking. Flavoenzyme oxidases generally catalyze oxidation of substrates with reduction of O2 to generate H2O2. Their reactions are useful for a wide range of applications, such as the production of valuable chemicals (7Dijkman W.P. de Gonzalo G. Mattevi A. Fraaije M.W. Flavoprotein oxidases: classification and applications.Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2013; 97 (23640366): 5177-518810.1007/s00253-013-4925-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).

Despite catalyzing the same conversion of amino acids to keto acids and H2O2, d-amino acid oxidases and l-amino acid oxidases (l-AAO) are classified into different structural families, with d-AAO in the d-AAO structural family and l-AAO in the MAO family (7Dijkman W.P. de Gonzalo G.

For some enzymes, such as LMO and TMO, which have structural characteristics classifying them as l-AAOs, their native major activity is monooxygenation of l-amino acid substrates (decarboxylation of imino acids) (Scheme 1) (26Flashner M.I.

Although the reactions of flavin-dependent oxidases also involve an initial step of oxygen activation, most oxidases cannot facilitate the formation of a kinetically stable C4a-(hydro)peroxyflavin. The only exception is found in the reaction of pyranose 2-oxidase, which belongs to the class of glucose-methanol-choline oxidases in which C4a-hydroperoxyflavin first forms before H2O2 elimination takes place (37Chuaboon L. Wongnate T. Punthong P. Kiattisewee C. Lawan N. Hsu C.Y. Lin C.H. Bornscheuer U.T. Chaiyen P. One-pot bioconversion of l-arabinose to l-ribulose in an enzymatic cascade.Angew.

For l-AAOs mentioned above, which can catalyze decarboxylation in addition to oxidation, their ability to form the C4a-hydroperoxyflavin intermediate is not clear. l-Amino acid oxidase/monooxygenase (l-AAO/MOG) from Pseudomonas sp. AIU 813 is an FAD-dependent oxidase that displays dual activities of oxidase and monooxygenase. l-Lysine is the most preferred substrate and is considered a native substrate for this enzyme. l-AAO/MOG showed significant oxidase activity (19%) and it is a different enzyme from the previously explored LMO, which displayed only monooxygenation activity (27Takeda H. Yamamoto S. Kojima Y. Hayaishi O. Studies on monooxygenases. I. General properties of crystalline l-lysine monooxygenase.J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244 (5772467): 2935-2941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To avoid confusion, in this report, we will refer to l-AAO/MOG from Pseudomonas sp. AIU 813 as l-lysine oxidase/monooxygenase (l-LOX/MOG). l-LOX/MOG is an ideal system for investigating the mechanism controlling the dual activities of a flavoenzyme oxidase. l-LOX/MOG catalyzes the minority reaction of oxidative deamination of l-lysine to produce ammonia, H2O2, and 2-keto-6-aminohexanoic acid (KH) and the majority reaction (81%) of oxidative decarboxylation of l-lysine to form CO2, H2O, and 5-aminopentanamide (5-APNM) (Fig. 1, gray panel). The oxidase activity of l-LOX/MOG could be increased by treating the enzyme with p-chloromercuribenzoate or by site-directed mutagenesis of C254I (38Matsui D. Im D.H. Sugawara A. Fukuta Y. Fushinobu S. Isobe K. Asano Y. Mutational and crystallographic analysis of l-amino acid oxidase/monooxygenase from Pseudomonas sp.

However, rather than direct detection of product, the previous reports measured only the formation of ammonium in the presence and absence of amidase as a readout for the first liberation of ammonia or for the cleavage of the amide product (Fig. 1) (38Matsui D. Im D.H. Sugawara A. Fukuta Y. Fushinobu S. Isobe K. Asano Y. Mutational and crystallographic analysis of l-amino acid oxidase/monooxygenase from Pseudomonas sp.

Recently, new X-ray structures of l-LOX/MOG in complex with l-lysine, l-ornithine, and l-arginine have been reported (40Im D. Matsui D. Arakawa T. Isobe K. Asano Y. Fushinobu S. Ligand complex structures of l-amino acid oxidase/monooxygenase from Pseudomonas sp. AIU 813 and its conformational change.FEBS Open Bio. 2018; 8 (29511608): 314-32410.1002/2211-5463.12387Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, how l-LOX/MOG controls the two oxidase and monooxygenase activities, structurally and mechanistically, is unclear. In this study, we investigated the mechanistic features controlling the dual activities of l-LOX/MOG from Pseudomonas sp. AIU 813 by analyzing the products from the reactions of l-lysine and l-ornithine using high-resolution MS and monitoring the transient kinetics of the reactions using stopped-flow spectrophotometry. The single-turnover reactions performed under anaerobic conditions were added H2O2 under various setups to identify key catalytic features enabling decarboxylation of 5-APNM and 5-aminopentanoic acid (5-APNA). Binding interactions of l-lysine and l-ornithine with the enzyme were explored by quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and by detection of charge transfer of the reduced FAD and the oxidized l-lysine complex by stopped-flow spectrophotometry. The common structural feature that facilitates decarboxylation of imino acids and allows the oxidases to catalyze apparent monooxygenation was also explored. To identify amino acids that can reduce the enzyme-bound oxidized FAD, a solution of l-LOX/MOG–bound oxidized FAD was added to various types of l-amino acids under anaerobic conditions. The results (Fig. S1) showed that only three l-amino acids (l-lysine, l-ornithine, and l-arginine) could reduce the enzyme-bound oxidized FAD to generate reduced FAD, which could be detected by the decrease in absorbance at 462 nm. Among the three amino acids, only the reactions of l-lysine showed complete reduction after 20 min. In contrast, l-ornithine and l-arginine showed significantly slower flavin reduction rates. Previous studies of l-LOX/MOG reported KH and 5-APNM as products from l-LOX/MOG with l-lysine and 2-keto-5-aminovaleric acid (KV) and 4-aminobutanamide (4-ABNM) as products from the reaction with l-ornithine. These data were based on HPLC identification of products and a combination of enzyme assays for both activities that measured free NH4+ before and after deamination by amide hydrolase (38Matsui D. Im D.H. Sugawara A. Fukuta Y. Fushinobu S. Isobe K. Asano Y. Mutational and crystallographic analysis of l-amino acid oxidase/monooxygenase from Pseudomonas sp. AIU 813: Interconversion between oxidase and monooxygenase activities.FEBS Open Bio. 2014; 4 (24693490): 220-22810.1016/j.fob.2014.02.002Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In this work, we wanted to establish and clarify whether the enzyme can generate other products in addition to these compounds and determine the ratios of compounds produced from the dual activities of l-LOX/MOG. Therefore, products from the multiple-turnover reactions of l-LOX/MOG with l-lysine and l-ornithine were identified by HPLC coupled with high-resolution MS quadrupole-time-of-flight (HPLC/QTOF-MS). Quantitative measurements were carried out by HPLC coupled with triple-quadrupole or single-quadrupole MS. Control reactions without enzyme added were also carried out to verify that the stability of the substrates was constant. Multiple-turnover reactions of l-LOX/MOG and l-lysine were carried out for 24 h, and the resulting products were analyzed. Results (Table 1) showed that all l-lysine was completely consumed, and three compounds were detected with the major product being 5-APNM (85 ± 1%), consistent with previous reports (38Matsui D. Im D.H. Sugawara A. Fukuta Y. Fushinobu S. Isobe K. Asano Y. Mutational and crystallographic analysis of l-amino acid oxidase/monooxygenase from Pseudomonas sp.

However, we did not detect the expected product, KH, but detected the dehydrated form of KH (DKH) instead. Unexpectedly, we also detected a very small amount of 5-APNA (0.32 ± 0.02%). This newly detected 5-APNA may be derived from decarboxylation of KH generated in the deamination path (Figure 1, Figure 2 and Table 1). Mass spectra of all these compounds are shown in Table S1 and Fig. S2. Based on these data, it can be firmly established that l-LOX/MOG catalyzes the decarboxylation of imino lysine as a major reaction (85%) and deamination of imino lysine as a minor reaction (14.7%). HPLC chromatograms of the control and turnover reactions and all standard compounds are shown in Figs. S3–S5.Table 1Percentage of utilized substrates and product yields from multiple-turnover reactionsSubstrateCompoundsPercentagel-Lysinel-Lysine100.0 ± 0.1 (utilized)5-APNM85 ± 15-APNA0.32 ± 0.02KHDetectedDKHDetectedl-Ornithinel-Ornithine100 ± 2 (utilized)4-ABNM0.021 ± 0.0024-ABNA32.8 ± 0.2KVDetectedDKVDetected Open table in a new tab Multiple-turnover reactions of l-LOX/MOG and l-ornithine were dramatically slower than that of l-lysine (data not shown). For 24 h, all l-ornithine was consumed, and unlike the reaction of l-lysine, only 0.021 ± 0.002% of 4-ABNM from the decarboxylation of imino ornithine was detected, whereas a majority of the compounds produced was KV, as expected. Different from the previously reported data (38Matsui D. Im D.H. Sugawara A. Fukuta Y. Fushinobu S. Isobe K. Asano Y. Mutational and crystallographic analysis of l-amino acid oxidase/monooxygenase from Pseudomonas sp. AIU 813: Interconversion between oxidase and monooxygenase activities.FEBS Open Bio. 2014; 4 (24693490): 220-22810.1016/j.fob.2014.02.002Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) but consistent with the reaction of l-lysine discussed above, a new product, 4-aminobutanoic acid (4-ABNA), resulting from decarboxylation of KV, was also detected (in significant amount, 32.8 ± 0.2%) (Fig. 3 and Table 1). Interestingly, the ratio of products from the l-ornithine reaction was different from that of l-lysine. The reaction of l-ornithine prefers to proceed via deamination to form KV and 4-ABNA more than to proceed via direct decarboxylation of imino ornithine to form 4-ABNM. Nevertheless, the decarboxylation of KV also exists. HPLC chromatograms and mass spectra of all compounds are shown in Figs. S6–S9 and Table S2. The kinetics of the l-LOX/MOG–bound oxidized FAD reduction by l-lysine and l-ornithine were investigated by monitoring absorbance changes at 462 nm (see “Experimental procedures”). The resultant kinetic traces showed that the flavin reduction by l-lysine started much quicker (0.02 s) than the reduction by l-ornithine (2 s). The enzyme-bound oxidized FAD could be completely reduced by l-lysine after 0.6 h, whereas 1.6 h was required for the reaction with l-ornithine. The kinetic traces were triphasic in both reactions of l-lysine and l-ornithine. Observed rate constants (kobs) for the reactions of l-lysine and l-ornithine are shown in Table 2. For l-lysine, kobs of the first phase is 0.540 ± 0.002 s−1, which is 22-fold greater than that of l-ornithine (0.025 ± 0.002 s−1). Therefore, the flavin reduction of l-LOX/MOG with l-lysine was dramatically faster than that of l-ornithine (Fig. 4). This indicates that l-LOX/MOG clearly prefers to use l-lysine rather than l-ornithine.Table 2kobs of the reduction of l-LOX/MOG–bound FAD by 16 mm l-lysine and l-ornithine monitored by stopped-flow spectrophotometrykobs1st phase2nd phase3rd phases−1l-Lysine0.540 ± 0.00253.2 ± 0.4 × 10−37.78 ± 0.05 × 10−3l-Ornithine0.025 ± 0.0023.18 ± 0.03 × 10−36.5 ± 0.5 × 10−4 Open table in a new tab As C4a-(hydro)peroxyflavin is a reactive intermediate commonly found in all flavin-dependent monooxygenases (32Chaiyen P.

These mutations in cancer genomes occur due to internal and external mutagenesis forces. Decoding the mutational processes by examining their unique patterns has successfully revealed many known and novel signatures from whole exome data, but many still remain undiscovered. Here, we developed a deep learning approach, DeepMS, to decompose mutational signatures using 52,671,908 somatic mutations from 2780 highly curated cancer genomes with whole genome sequencing (WGS) in 37 cancer types/subtypes. With rigorous model training and comparison, we characterized 54 signatures for single base substitutions (SBSs), 11 for doublet base substitutions (DBSs) and 16 for small insertions and deletions (Indels). Compared to the previous methods, DeepMS could discover 37 SBS, 5 DBS, and 9 Indel new signatures, many of which represent associations with DNA mismatch or base excision repair and cisplatin therapy mechanisms. We further developed a regression-based model to estimate the correlation between signatures and clinical and demographical phenotypes. The first deep learning model DeepMS on WGS somatic mutational profiles enable us identify more comprehensive context-based mutational signatures than traditional NMF approaches. Our work substantially expands the landscape of the naturally occurring mutational signatures in cancer genomes, and provides new insights into cancer biology."
https://openalex.org/W3035328121,"Introduction Maximal oxygen uptake () is a measure of cardiorespiratory fitness often used to monitor changes in fitness during and after treatment in cancer patients. There is, however, limited knowledge in how criteria verifying work for patients newly diagnosed with cancer. Therefore, the aim of this study was to describe the prevalence of fulfillment of typical criteria verifying and to investigate the associations between the criteria and the test leader’s evaluation whether a test was performed “to exhaustion”. An additional aim was to establish new cut-points within the associated criteria. Methods From the Phys-Can randomized controlled trial, 535 patients (59 ±12 years) newly diagnosed with breast (79%), prostate (17%) or colorectal cancer (4%) performed an incremental test on a treadmill. The test was performed before starting (neo-)adjuvant treatment and an exercise intervention. Fulfillment of different cut-points within typical criteria verifying was described. The dependent key variables included in the initial bivariate analysis were achievement of a plateau, peak values for maximal heart rate, respiratory exchange ratio (RER), the patients’ rating of perceived exertion on Borg’s scale6-20 and peak breathing frequency (fR). A receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to establish cut-points for variables associated with the test leader’s evaluation. Last, a cross-validation of the cut-points found in the receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed on a comparable sample of cancer patients (n = 80). Results The criteria RERpeak (<0.001), Borg’s RPE (<0.001) and fR peak (p = 0.018) were associated with the test leader’s evaluation of whether a test was defined as “to exhaustion”. The cut-points that best predicted the test leader’s evaluation were RER ≥ 1.14, RPE ≥ 18 and fR ≥ 40. Maximal heart rate and plateau was not associated with the test leader’s evaluation. Conclusion We recommend a focus on RER (in the range between ≥1.1 and ≥1.15) and RPE (≥17 or ≥18) in addition to the test leader’s evaluation. Additionally, a fR peak of ≥40 breaths/min may be a cut-point to help the test leader evaluate the degree of exhaustion. However, more research is needed to verify our findings, and to investigate how these criteria will work within a population that are undergoing or finished with cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3035726173,"The current paradigm holds that the inhibition of Rho guanosine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), the enzymes that stimulate Rho GTPases, can be a valuable therapeutic strategy to treat Rho-dependent tumors. However, formal validation of this idea using in vivo models is still missing. In this context, it is worth remembering that many Rho GEFs can mediate both catalysis-dependent and independent responses, thus raising the possibility that the inhibition of their catalytic activities might not be sufficient per se to block tumorigenic processes. On the other hand, the inhibition of these enzymes can trigger collateral side effects that could preclude the practical implementation of anti-GEF therapies. To address those issues, we have generated mouse models to mimic the effect of the systemic application of an inhibitor for the catalytic activity of the Rho GEF Vav2 at the organismal level. Our results indicate that lowering the catalytic activity of Vav2 below specific thresholds is sufficient to block skin tumor initiation, promotion, and progression. They also reveal that the negative side effects typically induced by the loss of Vav2 can be bypassed depending on the overall level of Vav2 inhibition achieved in vivo. These data underscore the pros and cons of anti-Rho GEF therapies for cancer treatment. They also support the idea that Vav2 could represent a viable drug target."

The nAChR transmembrane α-helix, M4, is positioned at the perimeter of each subunit in direct contact with lipids and likely plays a central role in lipid sensing. To gain insight into the mechanisms underlying nAChR lipid sensing, we used homology modeling, coevolutionary analyses, site-directed mutagenesis, and electrophysiology to examine the role of the α-subunit M4 (αM4) in the function of the adult muscle nAChR. Ala substitutions for most αM4 residues, including those in clusters of polar residues at both the N and C termini, and deletion of up to 11 C-terminal residues had little impact on the agonist-induced response. Even Ala substitutions for coevolved pairs of residues at the interface between αM4 and the adjacent helices, αM1 and αM3, had little effect, although some impaired nAChR expression. On the other hand, Ala substitutions for Thr422 and Arg429 caused relatively large losses of function, suggesting functional roles for these specific residues. Ala substitutions for aromatic residues at the αM4-αM1/αM3 interface generally led to gains of function, as previously reported for the prokaryotic homolog, the Erwinia chrysanthemi ligand-gated ion channel (ELIC). The functional effects of individual Ala substitutions in αM4 were found to be additive, although not in a completely independent manner.

On the other hand, specific interactions between M4 and the β6-β7 loop/Cys loop are not critical to function in the Erwinia chrysanthemi ligand gated ion channel, ELIC, suggesting that distinct mechanisms underlie lipid sensing in different pLGICs (see, for example, reference 43Domville J.A.

Whereas these studies have been informative, they have all focused on homomeric pLGICs. An intriguing question that remains to be addressed is how the M4 α-helix from different subunits of a heteromeric pLGIC influences channel function and, thus, participates in lipid sensing. As a first step to addressing this question, we use here a combination of mutagenesis, evolutionary couplings, and two-electrode voltage clamp electrophysiology to explore the functional role of M4 from the α subunit (αM4) of the human adult muscle nAChR (α2βεδ). Our data reveal several unique features regarding the role of αM4 in function and provide a structural basis for understanding the lipid sensitivity of the muscle-type nAChR. To properly interpret functional data derived from mutations in αM4 of the human adult muscle nAChR, a 3D structure that accurately defines the interactions that occur between αM4 and both αM1/αM3 and lipids is required. In the absence of such a structure, we first generated homology models based on the 4-Å-resolution apo structure of the Torpedo muscle-like nAChR (referred to as the 2BG9 Torpedo model), a revised Torpedo nAChR structure with a corrected sequence register in αM2/αM3, and a 3.3-Å-resolution nicotine-bound structure of the neuronal α3β4 nAChR (28Gharpure A.

The new 6UWZ Torpedo structure reveals several novel features relevant here, including a corrected register in the fitting of the amino acid sequence into αM2/αM3 (50Mnatsakanyan N. Jansen M. Experimental determination of the vertical alignment between the second and third transmembrane segments of muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.J.

The rotation of αM4 is surprising, because five residues (Cys412, Met415, Cys418, Thr422, and Val425) that are labeled by the lipophilic photoreactive probe 3-trifluoromethyl-3-(m-[125I]iodophenyl)diazirine ([125I]-TID) and that define the αM4-lipid interface in the Torpedo 2BG9 structure (Fig. S1) (51Blanton M.P. Cohen J.B. Mapping the lipid-exposed regions in the Torpedo californica nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.Biochemistry. 1992; 31 (1567828): 3738-375010.1021/bi00130a003Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) now project toward αM1/αM3. Whereas the positions of these residues in the new 6UWZ Torpedo structure are difficult to reconcile with the [125I]-TID labeling, they are supported by the structures of other neuronal nAChRs (52Morales-Perez C.L. Noviello C.M. Hibbs R.E. X-ray structure of the human 42 nicotinic receptor.Nature. 2016; 538 (27698419): 411-41510.1038/nature19785Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 53Walsh R.M. Roh S.-H.

Barrantes F. Sine S.M. Nicotinic receptor fourth transmembrane domain: hydrogen bonding by conserved threonine contributes to channel gating kinetics.J. Gen.

The hydrogen bond donor/acceptor distances between Ser226 and Thr422 are 11.1 and 7.1 Å in the 2BG9 and 6UWZ Torpedo structures, respectively. Thus, the new 6UWZ Torpedo structure requires a smaller reorientation of αM1/αM4 upon channel gating to bring Ser226 and Thr422 in close contact. Note that the 2BG9 Torpedo structure was solved from cryoelectron microscopic images obtained from native Torpedo synaptosomes, whereas the 6UWZ Torpedo structure was solved from images obtained using nAChRs that were detergent solubilized from native Torpedo membranes, affinity purified, and then reconstituted into lipid nanodiscs. Given the high resolution of the 6UWZ Torpedo structure and structures of other neuronal nAChRs, we reinterpreted our mutagenesis data primarily in terms of a homology model based on the 6UWZ Torpedo structure (referred to as the 6UWZ Torpedo model), as shown in Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4. Given the strength of the [125I]-TID labeling data, however, we considered a speculative possibility that αM4 undergoes a reorientation during solubilization/affinity purification/nanodisc reconstitution and, thus, have taken into account the orientation of αM4 defined in the 2BG9 Torpedo model.Figure 2Coevolved residues on αM4 and αM1 or αM3.

For many biochemists and molecular cell biologists, the foundations driving interests in biology were immediately experiential. Most young children watch seeds sprout, plant a small garden, or conduct the celery experiment with colored water; some may make a pH indicator from purple cabbage or help deliver a calf or a litter of puppies. With such experiences, I always had questions about natural things—mostly biology, many not immediately answered—and thus required a visit to the local library or taking a dusty college book off the shelf in the living room. By middle school, interests grew, and learning about and drawing atomic orbitals was nothing short of fantastic. The subsequent foundations in math, chemistry, physics, and biology in high school were routine and lacked the excitement from earlier instructors with one exception. As a senior and taking now what would be called AP Biology or AP Chemistry, there was immersion with hands-on activities that included everything from pH curves and enzyme assays to animal dissections coupled with active discussions by teams of students of how and why. This was the foundation that established interests, thus setting the stage for my decisions and programs of study in college. As an undergraduate student in the mid-1970s, I immediately realized that basic research was fundamental in driving education in biochemistry and cell and molecular biology. The journal Cell had been established in 1974 and, along with more established journals including the Journal of Biological Chemistry, Journal of Cell Biology, and Biochemistry, served as a platform linking cutting-edge research with teaching a sophomore-level cell biology course and extending to biochemistry and biophysical chemistry in subsequent years. The use of primary literature, while tough, provided real-time information that was being integrated into foundational concepts. As so, following my sophomore year, it was time to join a research laboratory, which was initially daunting, yet in time, an independent research project was developed that along with a rigorous course of study in biology and chemistry was foundational for advanced studies. Graduate school offered the opportunity to deploy many of the same strategies using primary literature while teaching cell and molecular biology laboratory and learning the value of teamwork. There was an immediate realization that one's passion for cutting-edge science was not universal, and thus it was essential to develop strategies demonstrating how the use of a research article in a laboratory setting was approachable. It became important to ask: How do you teach a sophomore to read a primary research paper? Where does data come from, and how can it be interpreted? How can a team be more effective that a single individual in addressing a specific question? And how does that data yield new information to drive the field forward? What came from this two-year period was a basic understanding of balancing the need to understand a concept and coupling that information with cutting-edge research to further advance that concept. One of the highlights of being a postdoctoral research fellow in the early 1980s was working with undergraduate students with a keen interest in biochemistry and molecular biology. My research was addressing the mechanistic basis of fatty acid transport and linkages to fatty acid activation and oxidation in Escherichia coli. It was during this period that the real importance of teamwork in science at the bench became apparent and that undergraduate students were effective members of a team given the proper mentoring. The undergraduate students were involved in key aspects of the work that included cloning the gene required for fatty acid transport (fadL), defining both patterns of complementation and expression, and culminating with purifying the protein FadL and showing that it was localized to the outer membrane. Three of the five papers published as a postdoc included undergraduate authors (1Spratt S.K. Black P.N. Ragozzino M. Nunn W.D. Cloning mapping, and expression of the genes involved in the fatty acid degradative complex of Escherichia coli.J.

They did however, guide my passion to link research with teaching and learning with the firm belief that biochemistry and molecular biology education is informed by basic research. These linkages are coincident with science (and, more broadly, STEM) education research addressing the importance of asking questions, designing and conducting experiments, collecting data, drawing conclusions, participating in scientific discourse, developing novel pedagogical tools, and communicating findings to advance the field. This experiential learning, as informed by science education research, also requires creating rubrics to establish goals and outcomes and to assess learning (4Manduca C.A. Iverson E.R. Luxenberg M. Macdonald R.H. McConnell D.A. Mogk D.W. Tewksbury B.J. Improving undergraduate STEM education: the efficacy of discipline-based professional development.Sci.

The Morrill Act of 1862 establishing land grant universities, including the University of Nebraska–Lincoln (UNL), was profound by promoting “without excluding other scientific and classical studies…the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes in the several pursuits and professions in life” (7The Morrill Act (1862) United States Statutes at Large, 12, 503.Google Scholar). The training in biochemistry at UNL embraces the importance of broader practical instruction and the training of scientifically literate graduates, which is consistent with the view that higher education is the major engine for socio-economic development. The transformation of our programs of study in biochemistry began in earnest in 2010, beginning with the recommendations from the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the National Science Foundation, and the National Education Council found in seminal documents, including Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action (8Brewer C.A. Leshner A.I. Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action. American Association for the Advancement of Science and National Science Foundation, Washington, D.C2009Google Scholar) and Rising Above the Gathering Storm: Energizing and Employing America for a Brighter Economic Future (9National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Engineering, and Institute of Medicine (2007) Rising Above the Gathering Storm: Energizing and Employing America for a Brighter Economic Future, National Academies Press, Washington, D.C.Google Scholar). This transformation was also informed by pioneering faculty at the university, in particular that of the botanist Charles Bessey. Bessey was known for innovative teaching methods that followed his belief that education was to be informed by research (10Bessey Faculty Positions (Pamphlet), Charles E. Bessey Records, Box 40, Folder 8, Department of Archives and Special Collections, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, Nebraska.Google Scholar). His teaching and research were experiential and included establishing the classification system for flowering plants that has become standard. The impact of his efforts continues to resonate in the Nebraska National Forest, the first artificial forest that began with his tree-planting experiments with his students and in the establishment of federal programs that funded modern agricultural experiment stations. The efforts to fully integrate the undergraduate and graduate education and research missions in the Department of Biochemistry began with the development of guiding principles, which were founded with the understanding that what we do in research and teaching is to improve the human condition. •Commit to an uncompromising pursuit of excellence. Commitment to excellence is the firm ethos in teaching and research and is reflected by excellence in undergraduate and graduate education, cutting-edge research, and the generation of knowledge that is world class.•Stimulate research and creative work that fosters discovery, pushes frontiers, and advances society. The highest standards for advancing research must be sustained through extramural funds and publications in the highest-quality journals in biochemistry and the molecular life sciences.•Establish research and creative work as the foundation for teaching and learning. Students pursing a biochemistry and molecular biology degree must be afforded every opportunity to conduct high-impact research in faculty laboratories with funding from individual grants and institutional programs that support such research efforts.•Prepare students for life through learner-centered education. Students must be guided and challenged in classrooms and laboratories to become independent in seeking the knowledge and skills required to become successful professionals in biochemistry, molecular biology, biomedicine, and related fields.•Engage with academic, business, and civic communities throughout the state and the world. Interactions and collaborations in biochemistry extend beyond the walls of the university to colleges and universities within the state and around the world, and through engagement with the private sector it is essential to bring the products of research and teaching to consumers as a benefit to society.•Create an academic environment that values diversity of ideas and people. The faculty and staff of the Department of Biochemistry at UNL embrace diversity and inclusive excellence as a fundamental core value. The Department of Biochemistry at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln was formally established in its current structure in 1995. The major immediately became popular, especially for students wanting to pursue medical school. By 2006, the department had a number of high-impact and established research programs, yet as a small research-intensive unit, teaching was seen as secondary. I joined the department as Chair in 2008 with a highly productive and externally supported research program, continuing our efforts to understand the mechanistic basis of fatty acid transport. Our work had progressed from a bacterial model and over a 23-year period had progressed to yeast, mammalian cell culture, and animal models (e.g. see Refs. 11Zou Z. DiRusso C.C. Ctrnacta V.

The attraction of leading biochemistry at UNL was that all fundamentals were in place; the challenge was to move the department into the 21st century by linking research and teaching in proactive ways through engagement and new faculty recruitment. At the time, the department had a robust graduate program with high-caliber students conducting cutting-edge research. Three members of the biochemistry faculty were working in the biochemistry education research space at that time, but their efforts were not integrated with the traditionally research-intensive faculty (16Bailey C. Markwell J. Overcome inertia and publish your science education scholarship.Biochem. Mol. Biol. Educ. 2008; 36 (21591171): 95-9810.1002/bmb.20162Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 17Soundararajan M. Bailey C.P. Markwell J.

This situation was not unique to UNL, as there are comparable challenges in the STEM fields throughout the country, many of which have resulted into two-tiered departments. To this end, there was a significant uphill battle that had to occur in moving faculty from the “talking head” in course delivery to active learning with full integration of teaching and learning with research. I had seen this in play out as an undergraduate student and knew the value of this linkage and how basic research informed teaching. Further, during the 22 years prior to assuming the leadership of biochemistry at UNL, my teaching was in both medical and graduate education, where integrating foundational research into teaching, including medical biochemistry, was an essential part of my approach. A number of issues at UNL began to coalesce, including the opportunity to hire a significant number of faculty and build a modern, high-impact Department of Biochemistry with strong research programs linked to teaching and learning and meeting the demands of 21st century career paths. This included hiring 19 new faculty members (2 joint) since 2010 to advance the biochemistry research and teaching missions. The challenges were to hire both strategically and deliberately to strengthen research and teaching and to establish a faculty with demographics that were shared by the student population. A central tenant in all of these efforts was one of inclusive excellence. The initial challenge was to convince the “traditionalists” that teaching 21st century biochemistry and molecular biology the way they were taught was inconsistent with training a modern workforce with a biochemistry education at the core. Part of this first challenge was eliminated with retirements. The second challenge was to identify strategic needs within the unit that worked collectively to advance both research and teaching. I likened this challenge to being the conductor of an orchestra, where all parts are essential and where the whole was greater than the sum of the parts. If the violins were not in synchrony with the brass, the result would be catastrophic. If there were weaknesses in the percussion or woodwinds that needed to be addressed, this became the priority. As a department chair, I did not need to tell the faculty what to do but, like a conductor, had to establish the environment to achieve optimal collaboration and integration among the existing and newly recruited faculty, professional and technical staff, and students. This challenge was also mindful of linking research areas and programs both within biochemistry and with other programs for added strength and impact. It was also mindful of the changing face of modern biochemistry and molecular biology to be more quantitative, especially with the emergence of high-throughout data and systems biology. A final and important challenge was to make biochemistry a true academic home for nearly 400 undergraduate majors. This necessitated a careful review of the curriculum and the establishment of practices where students were engaged and mentored in their progression through the program over four years. This also required building a faculty that valued basic research in biochemistry and molecular biology that extended to teaching and learning. The result was a broad appreciation of the interplay between research that advanced teaching and learning and the development of novel pedagogical tools and basic research that generated new knowledge. The environment that was established over a 10-year period was one of inclusive excellence and one that allowed the best ideas to come forward and be discussed and refined with many being implemented. During this same period, the research programs with highly talented graduate students and postdoctoral research fellows flourished, advancing programs in plant biochemistry, metabolic biochemistry, biomedical biochemistry, biophysical chemistry, and biochemical informatics. One key outcome of this excellence was the development of a graduate training program, supported by the National Institutes of Health, in the Molecular Mechanisms of Disease. The breadth of research in combination with changes in the teaching culture established a landscape required to advance the training of students for existing and emerging career paths. Leadership in any academic department requires a long-term vision, not simply maintaining the status quo and steering the unit. Like a conductor and their orchestra, academic leadership requires a clear understanding of the team, the measures of success, and how that fuels the vision. In biochemistry, the excitement of basic research and the generation of new knowledge is foundational. The hum of active research programs is contagious and spills into the hallways and seminar rooms where there is experimental planning, the sharing of data, and active discussions. As members of a biochemistry department not associated with a medical school, the graduate and undergraduate students in the laboratories and classrooms become part of the fabric and through a fully engaged learning environment, gain the requisite foundations for their chosen career paths. A central component of leadership in biochemistry, especially in a research-intensive institution, is to lead by example and embrace the missions of the department. At UNL, this was the clear expectation of the faculty—in essence, leadership that understood the details of the interrelated academic missions by being in and coming from the trenches. Academic leadership in a research-intensive department cannot be equated with just being a unit administrator. Leading by example was crucial in building biochemistry and required maintaining a robust research program with undergraduate and graduate students (e.g. see Refs. 18Ahowesso C. Black P.N. Saini N. Montefusco D. Chekal J. Malosh C. Lindsley C.W. Stauffer S.R. DiRusso C.C. Inhibition of fatty acid uptake by Lipofermata/CB16.2 prevents lipotoxic cellular dysfunction and death.Biochem.

It also required continual engagement with the faculty, staff, and students and proactive discussions with the deans and upper university administration. The balancing required was much like walking on a floor of marbles and meeting the needs and vision of the faculty using the resources available through the university. In 2010-11 and again in 2016-17, the Department of Biochemistry had to complete formal academic program reviews. As is the case for most academic departments, both were initiated with a self-study, which culminated with guiding principles and strategic visions. My resolve was that these reviews be faculty-driven, and indeed this was the case. Both occurred at the right time in moving the department forward. The first was significant as it identified the challenges and gaps required to advance the research and teaching missions into the 21st century. The second built on the outcomes of the first and included a number of new faculty hires that were crucial in developing the Vision of Excellence 2017–2022 document that, while dynamic, has proven highly successful in meeting the challenges of a 21st century Department of Biochemistry. Following the first academic program review, key faculty hires were made that were largely directed to strengthening the research programs in redox biochemistry, biophysical chemistry, metabolic biochemistry, plant biochemistry, and systems biology and biochemical informatics. It became important at the time that a significant effort be made to advance biochemistry in teaching and learning. During this period and as noted above, the interplay between research that advanced teaching and the development of novel pedagogical tools and basic research that generated new knowledge became part of the departmental culture. The 2016-17 academic program review was able to highlight the successes of the previous years and set the stage for the continued growth of the department with the understanding that research and teaching are interdependent and that strength in one provides strength to the other. During this period, the four-year curriculum had been modified to include biochemistry courses in each academic year, thus creating an academic home for the undergraduate students. There were expanded efforts to engage as many students as possible in basic research laboratory work in biochemistry and across campus in the larger molecular life sciences. In concert with these efforts, internal and external grants were awarded to members of the faculty to strengthen biochemistry teaching and learning—these grants were given the same high level of recognition as those supporting basic research. These efforts were coincident with strengthening a strong graduate program to include increased emphasis on the diversity of career paths. All of this was occurring in an environment that was driven by the faculty and from team building that was coming from within. The outcomes have been remarkable, with a level of faculty interaction in both research and teaching and, more specifically, a level of excitement linking the two. In addition to grants being awarded to support teaching and learning, four members of the faculty were awarded National Science Foundation CAREER grants in 2018 and 2019. These grants require outreach and education as central pillars of a cutting-edge research program. I remain convinced that these awards were successful in large part because of the environment established in the department that values research and teaching at the same level—this is an environment of inclusive excellence. As the University of Nebraska celebrated the 150th year since its founding and the Department of Biochemistry its 25th year, the department was awarded the 2019 University-wide Departmental Teaching Award as one of the President's Faculty Excellence Awards. The University of Nebraska system specifically recognized the tradition of pedagogical excellence through faculty engagement and innovation. There was praise for the department's innovative educational programs that emphasize critical thinking, experimental testing, and molecular and computational modeling that are directly linked to excellence in basic research in redox biochemistry, biophysical chemistry, metabolic biochemistry, plant biochemistry, and systems biology and biochemical informatics. The department was recognized for transforming biochemistry education and developing life-long learners, leading to a number of high-impact career paths. The linkage between research that advanced teaching and the development of novel pedagogical tools and basic research that generated new knowledge was the common thread creating synergy leading to strength. With the modernization of the biochemistry undergraduate curriculum to meet 21st century career paths, as is the case in many programs throughout the country, student engagement in their learning through critical thinking has become an expectation. It is now the tradition of biochemistry at UNL to present a body of information in concert with asking where it came from and how it advanced the field. As noted above, the biochemistry program has been modified to cover all four years. These changes in the undergraduate biochemistry curriculum have been driven by the faculty and supported by grants from the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, an"

We created mSCD1-Y104G to test the hypothesis that eliminating this bulky side chain would create an opening and permit the substrate's methyl end to protrude through the enzyme into the lipid bilayer, facilitating the desaturation of very-long-chain (VLC) substrates. Consistent with this hypothesis, Y104G acquired the ability to desaturate 24C and 26C acyl-CoAs while maintaining its Δ9-regioselectivity. We also investigated two distantly related very-long-chain fatty acyl (VLCFA) desaturases from Arabidopsis, ADS1.2 and ADS1.4, which have Ala and Gly, respectively, in place of the gatekeeping Tyr found in mSCD1. Substitution of Tyr for Ala and Gly in ADS1.2 and ADS1.4, respectively, blocked their ability to desaturate VLCFAs. Further, we identified a pair of fungal desaturase homologs which contained either an Ile or a Gly at this location and showed that only the Gly-containing desaturase was capable of very-long-chain desaturation. The conserved desaturase architecture wherein a surface residue with a single bulky side chain forms the end of the substrate binding cavity predisposes them to single amino acid substitutions that enable a switch between long- and very-long-chain selectivity.

There are two classes of evolutionarily unrelated fatty acyl desaturases, i.e. soluble and integral membrane-bound desaturases (1Shanklin J. Cahoon E.B. Desaturation and related modifications of fatty acids.Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49 (15012248): 611-64110.1146/annurev.arplant.49.1.611Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Both classes contain di-iron center active sites that bind and activate molecular oxygen to abstract two hydrogens from the acyl chain to introduce a double bond. Soluble desaturases are mainly found in the plastids of higher plants, whereas the integral membrane desaturases are distributed more widely in the endomembrane systems of most eukaryotes and some prokaryotes (1Shanklin J. Cahoon E.B. Desaturation and related modifications of fatty acids.Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol.

Desaturases typically act on acyl chains that are esterified to a carrier moiety. For example, soluble desaturases act on acyl chains esterified to acyl carrier protein (ACP), whereas integral membrane desaturases act on acyl chains esterified to either CoA or lipid head groups. Mammalian stearoyl-CoA desaturases are located within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where they convert stearoyl-CoA to oleoyl-CoA. Mutations associated with stearoyl-CoA desaturases (SCDs) in humans have been associated with cancer, obesity, diabetes, and other cellular disorders (5Liu X.Q. Strable M.S. Ntambi J.M. Stearoyl CoA desaturase 1: Role in cellular inflammation and stress.Adv. Nutr. 2011; 2 (22211186): 15-2210.3945/an.110.000125Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 6ALjohani A.M. Syed D.N.

The early availability of crystal structures of several soluble desaturases facilitated detailed studies of their substrate chain-length specificity and regioselectivity (7Guy J.E. Whittle E.

For example, mutation of two amino acids within the substrate-binding channel of the castor Δ9-18:0-ACP desaturase was sufficient to alter the chain-length specificity from C18 to C16 (9Cahoon E.B. Lindqvist Y. Schneider G. Shanklin J. Redesign of soluble fatty acid desaturases from plants for altered substrate specificity and double bond position.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94 (9144157): 4872-487710.1073/pnas.94.10.4872Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In follow-up work comparing structural models of acyl-ACP desaturases from cat claw and castor bean, a single amino acid located at the end of the substrate-binding channel was identified as the prime determinant of chain-length specificity by Cahoon et al. (10Cahoon E.B. Shah S. Shanklin J. Browse J. A determinant of substrate specificity predicted from the acyl-acyl carrier protein desaturase of developing cat's claw seed.Plant Physiol. 1998; 117 (9625712): 593-59810.1104/pp.117.2.593Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The lack of crystal structures of integral membrane desaturases has long hampered progress toward understanding the factors governing their specificity. Indeed, the structures of members of the integral membrane class lagged behind those of soluble desaturases by almost two decades, when two mammalian SCD1 structures were published almost simultaneously (11Bai Y. McCoy J.G. Levin E.J. Sobrado P. Rajashankar K.R. Fox B.G. Zhou M. X-ray structure of a mammalian stearoyl-CoA desaturase.Nature. 2015; 524 (26098370): 252-25610.1038/nature14549Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 12Wang H. Klein M.G. Zou H. Lane W.

In addition to providing clues as to their own substrate selectivity, homology between desaturases allows them to be used to model others for which structures are not currently available. Their architecture consists of four transmembrane helices with a cytosolic “cap” domain containing the catalytic di-metal center. Although the iron ions shown to be biochemically essential for function (13Enoch H.G. Catala A. Strittmatter P. Mechanism of rat liver microsomal stearyl-CoA desaturase. Studies of the substrate specificity, enzyme-substrate interactions, and the function of lipid.J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251 (8453): 5095-5103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were absent from these structures, a di-zinc site was identified adjacent to the substrate-binding cavity that was coordinated by a set of conserved histidine residues that coordinate the di-iron center (1Shanklin J. Cahoon E.B. Desaturation and related modifications of fatty acids.Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49 (15012248): 611-64110.1146/annurev.arplant.49.1.611Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). The crystallized di-zinc form was catalytically inactive but is useful for framing testable hypotheses regarding specificity determinants (14Cai Y. Yu X.H. Liu Q. Liu C.J. Shanklin J. Two clusters of residues contribute to the activity and substrate specificity of Fm1, a bifunctional oleate and linoleate desaturase of fungal origin.J. Biol.

The substrate-binding cavities of mammalian SCD1s are boomerang-shaped blind-ending cavities like those previously reported for soluble acyl-ACP desaturases. Bai et al. (11Bai Y. McCoy J.G. Levin E.J. Sobrado P. Rajashankar K.R. Fox B.G. Zhou M. X-ray structure of a mammalian stearoyl-CoA desaturase.Nature. 2015; 524 (26098370): 252-25610.1038/nature14549Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) proposed that the acyl carbonyl of the substrate forms a hydrogen bond with the Trp-258 at the opening of the cavity of the mouse SCD1, precisely positioning the C9 and C10 of the acyl chain in the vicinity of the catalytic di-metal center, thereby predisposing Δ9-regioselective desaturation. Moreover, the di-metal center is located at the apex of the bend in the channel, forcing the substrate to adopt an eclipsed conformation, orienting the two pro-R hydrogens toward the di-metal site facilitating the introduction of a cis–double bond. Acyl-CoA desaturases are commonly responsible for producing monounsaturated fatty acids in animal and fungal species, whereas the bulk of monounsaturated fatty acids produced in plants is formed by acyl-ACP desaturases in the plastid (15Harwood J.

However, Arabidopsis has a family of integral membrane desaturases, i.e. acyl-CoA desaturases–like enzymes annotated as Arabidopsis desaturases (ADS) that are also capable of converting saturated fatty acyl lipids to their monounsaturated equivalents (16Smith M.A. Dauk M.

They are principally involved in the biosynthesis of very-long-chain monounsaturated fatty acids in the cytoplasm (16Smith M.A. Dauk M. Ramadan H. Yang H. Seamons L.E. Haslam R.P. Beaudoin F.

Zhao H.Y. Kosma D.K. Tomasi P. Dyer J.M. Li R.J. Liu X.L. Wang Z.Y. Parsons E.P. Jenks M.A. Lü S.Y. The acyl desaturase CER17 is involved in producing wax unsaturated primary alcohols and cutin monomers.Plant Physiol. 2017; 173 (28069670): 1109-112410.1104/pp.16.01956Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Members in this family have a broad spectrum of substrate specificity. Heterologous expression of ADS1 in Brassica juncea reduced the levels of total saturated fatty acids (20Yao K.N. Bacchetto R.G. Lockhart K.M. Friesen L.J. Potts D.A. Covello P.S. Taylor D.C. Expression of the Arabidopsis ADS1 gene in Brassica juncea results in a decreased level of total saturated fatty acids.Plant Biotechnol.

The specificity of ADSs were experimentally evaluated by their heterologous expression in baker's yeast (16Smith M.A. Dauk M. Ramadan H. Yang H. Seamons L.E. Haslam R.P. Beaudoin F. Ramirez-Erosa I. Forseille L. Involvement of Arabidopsis ACYL-COENZYME A DESATURASE-LIKE2 (At2g31360) in the biosynthesis of the very-long-chain monounsaturated fatty acid components of membrane lipids.Plant Physiol. 2013; 161 (23175755): 81-9610.1104/pp.112.202325Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that the head group to which the saturated fatty acid is esterified can affect desaturase regioselectivity and that targeting ADS enzymes to either the ER or plastid can affect their specificity because each compartment contains its own characteristic head groups (17Heilmann I. Pidkowich M.S. Girke T. Shanklin J. Switching desaturase enzyme specificity by alternate subcellular targeting.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101 (15240892): 10266-1027110.1073/pnas.0402200101Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Bioinformatic analyses of membrane desaturases have also correlated the presence or absence of charged residues close to the opening of substrate-binding channels to various head group specificities (18Li D. Moorman R. Vanhercke T. Petrie J. Singh S. Jackson C.J. Classification and substrate head-group specificity of membrane fatty acid desaturases.Comput. Struct. Biotechnol. J. 2016; 14 (27708750): 341-34910.1016/j.csbj.2016.08.003Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Although these enzymes are biochemically or physiologically characterized, the detailed structural factors for determining the specificity are still unclear. Particularly, whether the structural determinant proposed from mammalian stearoyl-CoA desaturases can be experimentally validated and if so whether it is a general mechanism shared by distantly related desaturase homologs that use lipid head groups in place of CoA. In this work, we used a mammalian SCD crystal structure to empirically test the proposed chain-length specificity hypothesis. We then used homology modeling to test the chain-length specificity determinants of ADS and fungal acyl-CoA desaturases and show that mechanisms governing specificity appear to be conserved across these architecturally conserved, but evolutionarily diverged enzymes. Mammalian SCD1 belongs to a class of desaturases that insert a double bond at defined number of carbons from the carboxyl moiety. The availability of mammalian SCD1 structures allows us to test predictions of structure–function relationships by constructing and expressing mutants in bakers' yeast and investigating their biochemical consequences. The mSCD1 has a mushroom-shaped architecture (Fig. 1A) consisting of four transmembrane helices capped by a soluble substrate-binding domain containing a di-iron active site which activates molecular oxygen to effect catalysis (11Bai Y. McCoy J.G. Levin E.J. Sobrado P. Rajashankar K.R. Fox B.G. Zhou M. X-ray structure of a mammalian stearoyl-CoA desaturase.Nature. 2015; 524 (26098370): 252-25610.1038/nature14549Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The substrate-binding pocket consists of a blind ending, boomerang-shaped channel that can accommodate a linear fatty acyl chain. The distal end of the channel is sealed by a highly conserved large hydrophobic residue, Tyr-104 (Fig. 1B) that has been proposed to specify C18/C16 chain-length specificity. An exception is an SCD from Calanus hyperboreus with a Thr at the corresponding location, which can desaturate very-long-chain fatty acyl CoA (21Meesapyodsuk D. Qiu X. Structure determinants for the substrate specificity of acyl-CoA Δ9 desaturases from a marine copepod.ACS Chem. Biol. 2014; 9 (24475735): 922-93410.1021/cb400675dCrossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Tyr-104 is a surface residue located within the membrane-spanning domain of the desaturase on the opposite face of the desaturase relative to the opening of the substrate-binding channel. We therefore set out to test the hypothesis that SCD Tyr-104 determines its C18 specificity. We substituted Tyr-104 in mSCD1 for Gly to create an opening at the end of the channel, to test the hypothesis that it could acquire the ability to desaturate chain lengths greater than C18 by allowing the methyl end of the fatty acyl chain to protrude through the newly formed opening. Yeast deletion strain fat1Δ was used as a host for heterologous expression because it accumulates substantial amounts of VLCFAs, of C24 and C26 chain length (Fig. 2C) that could serve as potential substrates if the mutant were to acquire the ability to desaturate chains longer than C18 (22Zou Z.

The portion of chromatograms corresponding to the elution times for VLCFA methyl esters from cells expressing mSCD1-Y104G reveal the accumulation of some 24:1 and 26:1 fatty acids (Fig. 2A) in addition to 16:1 and 18:1, indicating that mSCD1-Y104G can desaturate 16:0 and 18:0 in addition to C24 and C26 substrates. In control experiments, cells expressing native mSCD1 (Fig. 2B) showed no detectable desaturation with the VLCFA substrates, nor did cells transformed with an empty vector (Fig. 2C). In all cases, the major unsaturated fatty acid species are 16:1 and 18:1, which likely arise from the native yeast Δ9 desaturase. These experiments support the hypothesis that Tyr-104 can be considered to be a gatekeeping site with respect to chain-length specificity. SCDs are responsible for introducing the first double bond into fatty acyl chain. The double bond is exclusively introduced at Δ9 position. It is proposed that the regioselectivity of mSCD1 is determined by the hydrogen bond formed between the carbonyl group of the substrate fatty acyl chain and the secondary amine group Nε1 of Trp-258 (11Bai Y. McCoy J.G. Levin E.J. Sobrado P. Rajashankar K.R. Fox B.G. Zhou M. X-ray structure of a mammalian stearoyl-CoA desaturase.Nature. 2015; 524 (26098370): 252-25610.1038/nature14549Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Therefore, the above mutations should not affect the regiospecificity of the native and mutant enzymes. To test this, we performed double bond positional analysis by derivatization with dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) and evaluated the fragmentation pattern by GC-MS. DMDS analysis shows that the mutant enzyme (mSCD1-Y104G) desaturates its substrates at Δ9 position (Fig. 2, D and E), i.e. the same as its parental enzyme, indicating the mutagenesis of the chain-length specificity determining residue only influenced the enzyme's chain-length specificity without changing regioselectivity. Unlike mammals, plants do not have SCDs to desaturate fatty acyl–CoA. Instead, Arabidopsis has an eight-member family of membrane-bound acyl lipid desaturases. Two members, i.e. AtADS1.2 (At1g06090) and AtADS1.4 (At1g06120), can perform Δ9 desaturation. They share limited homology with mSCD1 (i.e. 23% identity, 39% similarity and 23% identity, 38% similarity, respectively). However, multiple sequence alignment shows that the nine histidine residues that are proposed to coordinate the catalytic iron ions are well conserved (Fig. S1). We used the crystal structure of the mouse stearoyl-CoA desaturase to construct structural models for AtADS1.2 and AtADS1.4. Like mSCD1, the models for AtADS1.2 and AtADS1.4 are mushroom shaped and contain a boomerang-shaped substrate-binding channel (Fig. 3, A and B, respectively). In contrast to the blind-ending substrate-binding cavity of mSCD1, the substrate-binding channels of AtADS1.2 and AtADS1.4 are channels with openings on both sides of the proteins (Fig. 3, C and D, respectively), consistent with their reported ability to use VLC fatty acyl lipid substrates (16Smith M.A. Dauk M. Ramadan H. Yang H. Seamons L.E. Haslam R.P. Beaudoin F. Ramirez-Erosa I. Forseille L. Involvement of Arabidopsis ACYL-COENZYME A DESATURASE-LIKE2 (At2g31360) in the biosynthesis of the very-long-chain monounsaturated fatty acid components of membrane lipids.Plant Physiol. 2013; 161 (23175755): 81-9610.1104/pp.112.202325Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To test this experimentally, we expressed AtADS1.2 and AtADS1.4 in the fat1Δ yeast strain. In both cases, substantial quantities of 24:1 and 26:1 accumulated (Fig. 4, A, C and E). These monounsaturated fatty acids have Δ9 double bonds as confirmed by DMDS analysis (Fig. 4, F and G). Multiple sequence alignment shows that at the position corresponding to mSCD1–Tyr-104, AtADS1.2 and AtADS1.4 contain Ala and Gly, respectively (Fig. S1). Therefore, these two enzymes have an open conformation at the end of their substrate-binding channels, which enables them to accept fatty acyl chains longer than 18 carbons. We tested the effects of mutating these residues to Tyr and challenged them with VLC substrates. As expected, this mutation occludes the methyl end of the substrate-binding channel and prevents the enzymes from desaturating fatty acyl chains longer than C18 (Fig. 4, B and D). In addition, closing of the gatekeeping site in plant fatty acyl desaturase did not inactivate the enzyme. For instance, AtADS1.2-A65Y expressing oleΔ yeast can accumulate 18:1Δ9 (Fig. S2 and Table S4), whereas oleΔ with empty vector cannot produce Δ9 mono-unsaturated fatty acid.Figure 4Fatty acid methyl ester and dimethyl sulfide derivative analyses of S. cereviciae fat1Δ expressing ADS1.2 and ADS1.4 and variants thereof.

We next tested if this mechanism is common to fungal fatty acyl desaturases. Using AtADS1.4 amino acid sequence as a query, we searched into the nonredundant protein database of fungal fatty acyl desaturases and identified several candidate enzymes with a Gly at their gatekeeping sites. We selected the enzyme from Paxillus involutus ATCC 200175 with accession number KIJ06932.1 (hereafter 6932) for further test (Fig. 5A and B). We synthesized the encoding gene, expressed it in yeast and tested its activity. As shown in Fig. 5C, 6932 clearly showed the activity to desaturate VLCFAs to produce its cognate mono-unsaturated products up to 26C (Fig. 5, D–F), suggesting the consensus of opening the gatekeeping residue to desaturate VLC in fungal fatty acyl desaturases. Interestingly, in P. involutus genome, there are several other fatty acyl desaturases that are homologous to 6932, among which an enzyme with accession number KIJ05921.1 (abbreviated as 5921 hereafter) shares 91% sequence identity with 6932 and has an Ile at its gatekeeping site (Fig. 5A). Like Tyr, Ile is a much bulkier residue than Gly. To test if possessing an Ile or Tyr at this position could affect the enzyme's substrate chain-length specificity, we mutated 6932 gatekeeping residue to Ile and Tyr. The 6932-G85I and 6932-G85Y mutants lost their abilities to desaturate VLCFA, while they retained the activity to desaturate 16:0 (Fig. S3, A–D). In addition, DMDS analysis showed that 6932 is a Δ6 desaturase (Fig. 5, D–F), suggesting the gatekeeping chain-length specificity determination mechanism is conserved among front-end desaturases. Moreover, the mutations did not affect the Δ6 regiospecificity of the enzyme (Fig. S3, E and F). Collectively, these data demonstrated that the mechanism for determining substrate chain-length specificity is widely conserved for front-end desaturases from different species and across different kingdoms. In the structural model of mSCD1, Trp-258 forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl group of oleoyl-CoA, which was hypothesized to position the fatty acyl–CoA for Δ9 regioselective desaturation (11Bai Y. McCoy J.G. Levin E.J. Sobrado P. Rajashankar K.R. Fox B.G. Zhou M. X-ray structure of a mammalian stearoyl-CoA desaturase.Nature. 2015; 524 (26098370): 252-25610.1038/nature14549Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Interestingly, AtADS1.2 and AtADS1.4 also have a Trp at the corresponding position, suggesting that AtADS1.2, AtADS1.4 and/or other Δ9 fatty acyl–CoA desaturases may use a similar mechanism for Δ9-specific desaturation. Although from a structural view it appeared that mSCD1 Trp-258 plays an important role as a reference point for positioning the acyl chain, there was no empirical evidence to support this view. Because VLCFA desaturation products do not naturally occur in yeast cells, we took advantage of the ability of mSCD-Y104G to desaturate very-long-chain fatty acyl chains. Into this mutant we combined a series of mutations at position 258 to investigate the influence on regioselectivity of Trp at this position. Mutations of Trp-258 to most other residues, such as Arg, Gln, His, Ile, Leu, Lys, Met and Glu, resulted in a total loss of mSCD1-Y104G activity (data not shown), validating the importance of this residue. Interestingly, mutants in which Trp-258 was substituted by Phe or Tyr (Fig. 6, A–E) partially retained desaturation activity and maintained Δ9 regioselectivity (Fig. 6, F and G). In this work we have tested hypotheses that were proposed from inspection of the crystal structure of the mSCD1. Specifically, we provide experimental evidence to support the hypothesis that Tyr-104 is key to specifying C18 substrate chain-length specificity to mSCD1. Substituting a small residue in place of the Tyr allows VLCFA to bind to the desaturase and insert a Δ9 double bond. That this is possible is related to two features that are observable from the crystal structure. First, Tyr-104 forms not only the end of the substrate-binding cavity, but also a surface residue located within a hydrophobic domain which is predicted to be positioned within the lipid bilayer.

https://openalex.org/W3034245025,"During my first year of grad school, a faculty member asked whether I'd be interested in analyzing data for one of his projects. I enjoyed new computational challenges, so I agreed to do the analyses on top of my normal Ph.D. work. Then, 1 year later, the same faculty member met with me and asked a series of questions posed by reviewers of the paper he had written. I was flustered—I had no idea that a manuscript had even been submitted to a journal—but I answered his questions. Later, though, I got up the courage to drop by his office and find out whether I was listed as a co-author, or even acknowledged, on the manuscript. He said no, acting as though the question itself was inappropriate. The experience led me to rethink my approach to collaborations.



> “If you invest time in a project, then you deserve to have your efforts acknowledged.” 

I started to develop my computational skills when I was working as a pharmacist in Egypt. I had grown tired of my day job, and I was looking for a new challenge. In my spare time, I took online courses that taught me how to write computer code, and I realized that I enjoy programming. Eventually, I decided to quit my pharmacist job and move to the United States, where I started a Ph.D. program in biology.

In grad school, I continued to develop my computational skills. Colleagues noticed my expertise and started to ask for help. My dad was always lending a hand to those in need when I was growing up, and he taught me to do the same. So during my first years of grad school, I always said yes when I was asked to assist with data analyses.

Once, a fellow grad student came to me with an urgent request. She was leaving for a conference the following week and hadn't analyzed the data for her poster. “Could you help me?” she asked in a desperate tone. Feeling bad for her, I agreed to do some analyses—which took 2 days of my time.

My friends often criticized me for saying yes to these requests, pointing out I needed to focus on my own work. They also worried that I was giving people the benefit of my expertise without getting anything substantive, such as authorship or acknowledgment, in return. I understood my friends' concerns. The grad student who needed help with her poster said she'd return the favor someday and buy me a meal, but she never did. And the faculty member I did analyses for never did put my name on his manuscript.

In time I realized that although it's OK to lend a helping hand, it's also important to speak up for myself. In the years since, I've made a point of having a conversation about authorship as soon as possible in a collaboration if I'm being asked for a significant contribution to a project. These can be awkward conversations, especially when the collaborator is more senior than I am. But I've learned that they are necessary, because if you invest time in a project, then you deserve to have your efforts acknowledged.

These discussions pay off in other ways, too. Ensuring that everyone involved is on the same page alleviates stress during the collaborative process. That frees me to focus on the science, which is the truly fun part. The conversations have also resulted in accomplishments that I could add to my CV. I defended my Ph.D. 3 months ago, and I left grad school as a co-author on 10 manuscripts—with a few more on the horizon.

The collaborations I participated in during my time as a Ph.D. student enriched my grad school experience, giving me an opportunity to learn about and contribute to projects apart from my own. I particularly enjoyed helping fellow grad students who were interested in honing their quantitative skills. It was rewarding to see their skills blossom, often to the point where they didn't need my help anymore.

But along the way, I learned that in order to maintain my sanity during the collaborative process, I need to be transparent about my expectations. Collaborators can't read my mind, and they may not automatically appreciate how much time it takes to analyze data. So it's my responsibility to tell them."
